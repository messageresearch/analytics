We want to thank you for what you are for us, for what you are doing for us. Oh God, we are gathered tonight to dedicate this time for prayer because your prophet said in order to grow spiritually we have to listen to the word of God and we have to pray. Father, we have heard a lot now we are coming to pray so that that thing all that there was preached could be materialized. We commit therefore this gathering into your hands. Bless your people. Touch each and every one of us and incline your ears to every prayer. [Music] We ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated as I greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus. We had a wonderful meetings uh not only just for the Easter but uh we have been having a lot of good meetings and uh if you will notice most of the meetings are centered around revival, divine healing, deliverance which is wonderful, but uh I don't know if you pay attention when uh Pastor Gideon was preaching, he said something about maintaining your healing and uh that really touched my heart. I remember it has been maybe two three years. Uh I think I was uh teaching on uh the principles of God but there was a chapter that I did not speak on. It was on how to maintain your healing. And I think after all that we have heard I have to remind you about these things. We don't want to be living from service to service. We don't want to be leaving from coming to church going home and uh in that uh But we want to come. What we receive, we keep it and we maintain it. Otherwise, it will be a certain cycle and we need to get out of that cycle. So for tonight, uh I'm going to exhort on how to maintain your healing. and for inspiration. Thy faith has healed you. So we are going to take uh Luke chapter 18 vers 1-7 Luke 18 because we need to understand one thing. Divine healing works only by faith. It's not by your church. Either you believe or you don't believe are a believer or you are not a believer. But if you believe and you take God by his word, he is under obligation to heal you. And uh we need also to be perseverant. So this parable said and he spake a parable unto unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint. [Music] saying, "There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man. widow in that city. And she came unto him, saying, "Avenge me of mine adversary." And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard men, Yet because this widow troubled me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge said?" And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them. Amen. Amen. Think about this parable. That unjust judge was fear not God. She had no consideration for nobody. But because the widow, that widow who always come insisting, insisting Finally he said I have to avenge her so that she cannot continually come to bother me. We are going to close with Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11 verse one. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. the reading of his word. I want to say this. We have just to continue praying. We have always to continue to persevere in prayer and in faith. Not to have this kind of faith when uh you are always looking for something to lift you up which is not bad but as soon as I think is stopped and we go back to the normal but the real faith is to continue we don't need to put ourself in a position that uh we come to church when they say, "Oh, you have to be healed." Oh, you jump. Oh, and and really I believe at that time. When you have faith to grasp it on the spot, you are healed. But after a while, do we maintain that or we need just us to come every day? We are going to have a twins triplex. It's wonderful. But what has been said, what has been received, keep it up. Amen. Amen. Because in the way God does things, brother told us there is a difference between miracle and divine healing. Miracle will happen on the spot. Boom. A blind eyes open and start walking. A people stand up. Wonderful. But miracle are less than divine healing. Divine healing it is something that we have to fight and maintain and keep it up. Amen. Amen. Brother said in the message of faith preached August 15, 1956. Uh this is just for introduction. Paragraph five. I know that uh sometimes you can go into a teaching of just how to maintain a divine healing. uh you have to look at uh many aspect and touch on demonology because Satan knows that when you come to church you receive it. He knows that and he's filled is when you go out and you see little symptoms and you start doubting and this is where he's going to knock you down. And if we are not taught enough, we don't know what to do, how to react, we will be praying sometimes in vain. Listen to brother, but then it's like a little animal run over in the street, a little dog or something, but leave him lay there for about 72 hours and watch what takes place. He's way bigger than he was the first time. See, it shrinks, then it goes to swelling. For as soon as that growth begin to swell and the patient thinks that, oh, I'm so sick. Oh, I'm so sick. [Music] I lost my healing. You know that you can lose your healing. You come to church, they pray for you, you are healed and after you lose completely that healing and you and I believe sometimes we are living in this kind of uh uh [Music] routine. You come to church, they preach the word, you feel good, you praise God. As soon as the service is over, What you receive is gone. That's a sign you got your healing. You got just it vice versa and I believe without any doubt that the word of God is true. Every time it has been brought to action. It must produce this effect. The effects people are healed all the time. But the question is, are they maintaining that healing? That's why brother Bam give the example of the little dog when it killed after a while it start growing and then and then in strength but when it's growing it the sign that when you are sick for example or you may have a tumor or a cancer when they pray for you or any sickness. If you feel like it's becoming to hurt more, that's a sign of healing, but it's not a sign to be discouraged. And that's the step where the devil come on. See, they pray for you. They anointed you with oil. But look at now it start hurting more. If it hurts more say praise the Lord because I am healed. And at that time it's a time to testify and maintain that testimony. Brham said and I suppose in the afternoon service they are teaching those things anyhow. So in the big campaigns we try to get that in and in my tent. I am going to try to do it myself in the afternoon service. Listen to what he saying. what he's going to do in the service afternoon. Give the instructions on how to approach, how to maintain your healing. Amen. Amen. It's a it's an instruction on how to maintain your healing just as much as to know how to maintain it. But try to repeat what I'm saying. Don't try to go ahead just as much to know how to maintain it. And it is to receive it. So if you receive it, you have to maintain it. If you maintain it, you have to believe that you have received it. And that should be coming in your mind all the time. Otherwise brother we will have uh services after services turning around on the same thing and result is not materialized. Are you with me we want to come to a spot they pray for you and you say you believe you maintain that prayer. They anoint you with oil. You maintain it. It's not service after service. You know my bottle of oil will end. No. No. Are you with me? So if it leave it a little bit if it's a new case then they can pray for you. But if it in existing, let me ask you, how many times shall we pray for the same thing? Are you with me? Is it the truth? We We have to move forward. We have to make a step forward. Oh, brother, I get this. Pray for me. I believe with all my faith and you pray, I take it and I start moving. I've been prayed for God is going to enter into action based on that prayer of faith and my faith. That's why Brham said we have to give instructions. I will give you a few example even in the Bible. Do you know that Jesus he prayed for the people he never said I have healed you? He always said thy faith has healed you. Amen. Thy faith, thy faith, thy faith. If you don't have faith, then you can come. Pray for me to have a faith but not pray for me to be healed for that. Pastor, am pray for it, pastor. Uh vent where is the faith unless God has put that desire again but it's not it should not be a routine because Our faith does not depend on anyone. Amen. Amen. Our faith is once we take it and we move forward. Let me give you a few scriptures here. Jesus never said, "I made thee whole. When they say I make thee whole, that mean Yeah, that's how he said. Jesus never said that. He always said thy faith and if a pagan come he believes with faith God is also under obligation to heal him. That's why in Pentecost they have things. It's a matter of faith, but as we have the faith of the age, the faith of William Brham. Amen. Amen. Bless my faith. Bless your faith. Let us move on. Let us take the Bible. Mark chapter 10. Let us get to from verse 50 to 52. talking about the blind Baptist. And he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What will thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, "Lord, that I might receive my sight." Amen. [Music] Listen to what Jesus said. And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way. My faith has made you." Huh? That's what Jesus said. What did he said? Whose faith? blind batimus. He Jesus said, "Thy faith has made thee whole." And immediately he receive his sight and follow Jesus in the way. Amen. Amen. I want you to pay attention closer to attention to the scripture. Matthew chapter 9, let us take verse 20 to 22. This is about the woman with blood issue. And behold, a woman which was deceased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment. For she said within herself, "If I may but touch his garment, I shall behold." But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, "Daughter, be of good comfort. My faith has made thee whole." Are you with the Bible? It's thy faith. Thy faith has made thee whole. And a woman was made whole for that hour. Luke chapter 17 from verse 15. This is the 10 lepers that uh Jesus pray for them. And one of them when he saw that Jesus that he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God. [Music] And fell down on his face, face at his feet, giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, "Were there not 10 cleans? But where are the nine? found that return to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, "Arise, go thy way, thy faith has made thee whole." Amen. Amen brother everywhere dealing with Jesus or brother or any minister it's all about your faith and if you don't have such faith then continue to come back and forth brother don't take me wrong if you have to come come because you have little faith until your faith is going to Pastor Gon was telling me last time I pray for the people but you know some people they need the touch the contact which is true. They need just to put them the vest or put oil. This is how if it's going to help somebody's faith, let us do it. But we are talking about that kind of faith. I'm prayed for and I'm persevering and I have no doubt. what they prayed me for, even 20 years ago, God will never forget that prayer. Amen. Amen. Matthew chapter 15, you know that story of that woman. She came asking, begging to show you brother faith it's not something maybe you must be convinced that woman was sure that this Jesus this is he I my healing is there now Even if Jesus tried to push her back, faith is a conviction. He Jesus said, you know, I'm not sent to the uh lost sheep for the Isra the people of Israel. It doesn't matter. Have mercy. And you know the food I have this precious message is not for the dog. Lord dogs they don't deserve to eat on the table. I don't need a seven course menu but I just stay on the under the table for the little crown. He was a perseverance. Perseverance. Brother Bam said faith and perseverance they are brothers. You cannot have faith and not perseverance. If you see somebody say I have faith but doesn't persevere that's not faith. They are brothers. Amen. Amen. So they continue. Let's go to the end maybe verse 28. You know the story of this verse 28. Then Jesus answer and said unto her, oh woman, great is thy faith. Amen. That means a real faith must be tested. Jesus testing that woman. If they fight a woman, that woman did not have faith like some church members. If the pastor said, you know, I cannot waste my time to preach to you race of dogs to the door. Amen. Amen. But that woman, she had faith. Amen. Amen. That's what really we call faith. It's not a hope. Peter said, "Oh master, to whom shall we go?" Again, Jesus was casting them away. 70 left. And he said, "I don't need a big church. The rest of you, what are you doing here?" Some say, "Did you hear that? I won't be here anymore." They walk away. But Peter, master, where else? To whom else? faith, perseverance. Jesus told that woman, "Oh woman, great is thy faith, not great is my faith." Brother, faith is also a gift. Amen. Be it unto thee, even at thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. Amen. Amen. Let me review my examples here. Beside blind the Bimus and the 10 lepers, probably they were men. and they pray. But the woman with the blood issue, that was a woman. This one was a woman. And the last one I'm taking is the woman who wash Jesus feet. And woman always typify a church. I for problem with all your problems. You must have faith to go over that. Not be cry baby all the time. Luke 7, Luke chapter 7 verse 48. And he said unto her, "Thy sins are forgiven." Stop there. even the forgiveness of your sins. It's by faith. It's not I did something or I committed adultery which cannot finish. Amen. Amen. I did a mistake. I know I did wrong. The Holy Ghost convinced me and I look at the scripture. What does the scripture recommend to fix it? I'm a married man. I take my wife. I confess with all my heart. Forgive me. And I keep questioning. Did you really forgive me? Let us fulfill what the prophet said. Let us go see. That woman. I did that with this woman. And you woman, you are not my wife. Look at my wife. She's beautiful. That was a mistake. Would you also forgive me? I forgive you, brother. Confess his sin is forgiven. Now the battle is going to come in your mind. When the pastor is going to preach, oh he's he's not talking to me, he's talking to those people who have never confessed. But don't you keep talking about it? Which position are you putting yourself? about me all the time. You are not in that context. Unless you put yourself in that context, this is why they say that's your problem. Amen. Amen. I am not concerned if they say people who who steal. Did you see me stealing at your house? That's not me. So even the forgiveness of sins, it's by faith that all that I have done is in the sea of forgetfulness. If the devil try to remind you that it's easy, Satan, you see the water I went to in the baptism. Okay. Okay, it's already gone. If you are a warrior, go get my sin in that world. Bring it here, then I will believe that I'm a sinner. If you cannot bring it, it's in the sea of God forgetfulness. And that's how faith must kick in. I'm not saying go do it and I'm not saying that but I'm showing you another face. Amen. Amen. So then thy sins are forgiven. Next verse and they they that sat at the meat with him began to say within themselves, who is this that forgive sin also? And he said unto the woman, "My faith," this can be a good teaching, not just thy faith has saved you, thy thy faith has forgiven you, thy faith has healed you. Amen. Amen. So all it's all about thy faith. Amen. Amen. Let's take brother Barnam here in the message the living Jesus Christ. The living Jesus Christ paragraph 39. And I will assure you If the believer will come and believe, right here, presently, no matter what's wrong with it, it will take place right here. But if the word of God is preached with all the anointing and your faith is anointed, and you accept it, it's a done deal. You have never seen it fail and it won't. But now if you go out of here and disbelief or just with a little weak faith, it will come right back on you even worse than that what it was in the first place. So when the word is preached, you may not say don't say amen, say maybe. I'm not sure if you don't have faith. But if you believe it's the word of God and you say amen to it, stay with it. Because if you don't, those spirit they are casting casted out. When a bad spirit leaves, he will come back with seven more. And your condition will be worse than the the state before. For the unclean spirit goes out of a man, he walks in dry places. Is that right? Then he returns back. And if the good man of the house, the good man of the house is faith. So that mean when it leaves with faith. So that when he try to come, he looks faith. He look here faith, faith, faith, faith. There is no way. But if he saw the faith only here when he goes out there is no faith. He will say this person kicked me out once. But now I need seven moreh so that we can resist. Brother don't put yourself in that position. I don't know if there are people here who are always they kick out and the the devil goes and get seven more they stay they kick them maybe they kick only one six stay and the one who went bring seven more and they are 13 and they kick one the 12 you Seven more. Some may have 20. Doing that exercise. You come. You believe, they kick out, they come back. You have you have you have been surrounded with a lot of demons. Branam continued to tell us. Then he returned back. And if the good man of the house isn't there to keep him away, you must take God at his word, not your feelings, but take God at his word. Your faith keeps him away. Just refuse it. But when the the devil want to come, refuse it. Amen. Amen. Brother, it must be an exercise. You refuse it. Are you see something? I start talking to you. Oh, you know this kind of sickness. No, not that simple prayer and you can see most of the cases. you. Jesus did not even pray. He was just telling them your faith go your faith go. We we ended we ran out all the water that pastor bought from Israel. Believe we don't believe I will keep my downstairs. Brother sometimes we have done everything we could. I have the tissues on which brother prays. I keep it secretly and jealously it's for hard cases but the rest of the case you can't just believe and move on one time I was preaching in South Africa. I was preaching. Uh when I mention about that tissue after service, it was a line of people. I cut I start cutting even little little until it was finished. I have always a reserve somewhere hidden. Don't come ask unless very very critical. Amen. Amen. He will torment and peck at your door and hound at your windows, but just turn your head and keep on looking forward toward Christ and going on. Amen. Amen. If you believe how long the then how long the healing will last. Brother said in the message try to search for me. Uh, how long does healing last? Vanam said, "As long as faith last." Amen. Amen. How long healing will last? So if I'm healed today, I'm going to be healed for how long? I will be healed until long as my faith last. Amen. If you fail then you are going to lost lose your faith. I don't know if uh somebody can help them. Yeah, it's I don't know it it should be in the message diseases and affliction. Uh it's yes diseases and afflict. I don't know how I cut it. So someone said, "Does the healings last?" Someone said, "Does the healing last?" They last as long as faith lasts. That's the settlement. That's it. You come, you say you believe, they pray for you, you say you believe, keep believing. The day you are going to stop believing, your healing is going to stop and we have been in a cycle of stopping the healing. But when faith fails, then your healing will fail. Would you say every person that came to the altar and got converted will be a Christian all their days? He could be tonight a child of God and tomorrow be a child of the devil. Oh, don't say, "Oh, brother, I'm safe for Yes, you are save forever. As long as you believe you are saved." And if you come to say I'm not sure if I will save then you are lost. And when he loses faith in God what sent him back in uh paragraph 28 disease and afflictions. paragraph 28. And any power that could heal you here at this platform can keep you well. If that power that heals you in which you had faith, the same power must keep you. If you have confidence and you have faith, that's the reason I made this statement that nothing comes here but what is delivered here. Amen. When we come to church, nothing but what is delivered outside here outside here. It's according to your faith whether it stays. I have seen people come to the platform totally blind and read the same Bible. He came blind. They pray for him. Eyes open. He read the Bible. In less than five days, come back again just as blind as they ever was. Why did they read here? The power of the devil recognized the that gift of God and he had to leave. I know that's a real statement to make, but I know where I stand. I know who I have believed and I know his power to heal. Amen. Amen. So therefore, don't have this kind of faith that move, shift, etc. Even to the extent to think oh my case only if brother could be here. There were so many people in Braham meetings who are not healed. The principle of divine healing paragraph 24. No man can take credit for healing. Not even to a doctor. There is no doctor can heal you. Now doctors give you a and they will operate and thinks that necessary. But you never heard a doctor said that he could heal you because he can't. There's only one healer and that is God. Paragraph 36. Now, no man can heal you. When a preacher comes or anybody else and says, "Well, he has got healing power." That's error. Healing power lays in Calvary, not in man. In Calvary. Amen. Amen. One in a million ed. I went to pastor D's birthday. He turned 60. I was making joke with him. I say you the French people. Why you have to say you have 5010? Everything is by convention, right? The day they will agree, they will say it and like like what you you have created here. One in a million. Paragraph 80. Now healing is in the reach of every person. Remember healing is in you. It's in you. You just believe. that I am healed. Brother refuse those things even going to the medical exam. You go claiming your healing or they are going to check this. My blood pressure is normal. My blood sugar is normal. My everything is normal. Doctor say something. Doctor, you are mistaken. This is how faith will work. I have to close up here. You have to be perseverant in the message. Perseverance perseverance. If you believe we have organized all these meetings for the sake of the people. Now we want to see the result. Then I got to thinking on perseverance and I thought yes many man is perseverant before you can be perseverant. You have to have faith in what you are trying to achieve. You have got first to have faith before you can be persevered. So faith and perseverance works end in end together. They are brothers. You must believe or you will not have confidence. You won't you won't know whether you are right or wrong. But when you have reached that place that you have faith in what you are trying to do then you can be persevering. That's the concluding statement. We will need to draw a lesson tonight. I have to reach that place. the place of faith to believe the word of God and nothing else. And when you reach that level of faith, then you will be persever. We are going to pray that God help us maintain the victory. Don't pray for something else. Pray for you to maintain the [Music] victory. You can have a victory over a cigarette. Victory on pornography. You have to maintain that victory. My faith looks up to thee, thou lamb of [Music] Calary, saveior divine. [Music] Now hear me while I pray. Call my king the way. Oh, let me Lord this day behold. He died rich grace in power.
