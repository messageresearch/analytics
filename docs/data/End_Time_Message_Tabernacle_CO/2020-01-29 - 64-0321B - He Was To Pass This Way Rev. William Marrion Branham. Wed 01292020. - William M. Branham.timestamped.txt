[24:15] bringing the book of st. Luke the
[24:17] nineteenth chapter I want to read just a
[24:20] portion of the scripture the first five
[24:21] verses and Jesus entered and passed
[24:24] through Jericho and the whole there was
[24:27] a man named Zacchaeus which had was the
[24:30] chief among the publicans and he was
[24:33] rich and he sought to see
[24:35] Jesus who he was and he could not for
[24:39] the press because he was little of
[24:41] statue and he ran before and climbed up
[24:45] into a sycamore tree to seen for he was
[24:49] to pass that way and when Jesus came to
[24:53] the place he looked up and saw him and
[24:56] studied him Zacchaeus
[24:58] make haste come down for today I must
[25:01] abide at thy house and he made haste and
[25:05] came down and received him joyfully
[25:07] and when they saw it all murmured sin
[25:11] that he was going to be the guest of a
[25:15] man which was a sinner zach is stood and
[25:18] said unto the Lord the Oh Lord the half
[25:22] of my goods I give to the poor and if I
[25:25] have taken anything from any man by
[25:27] false accusation I restore am fourfold
[25:32] and jesus said unto him this day is
[25:35] salvation come to this house or so much
[25:38] as he also is a son of Abraham for the
[25:41] Son of Man is come to seek and to save
[25:44] that which was lost as praying our
[25:48] Heavenly Father we are grateful to thee
[25:52] this morning the closet you are still
[25:54] seeking to save the sons of Abraham that
[25:59] which is lost we pray Heavenly Father
[26:02] that you will receive our humble prayer
[26:04] and bless our gathering together here
[26:06] today and may it not be in vain but may
[26:10] the great Holy Spirit teach us the way
[26:12] of life knowing this that we must stand
[26:15] in his presence some day to give an
[26:18] account of what we've done with this
[26:19] life blessed us together now as we
[26:22] further await on thee in Jesus name Amen
[26:29] I am sure happy to have good friends
[26:38] people who believe and believe the
[26:42] efforts that you're trying to put forth
[26:44] I had any other objective just merely to
[26:50] be different why I would be a real
[26:53] sinner but my objective is to magnify
[26:59] Jesus Christ and something that's in a
[27:03] man when you have a message from God you
[27:06] cannot stop yourself there's something
[27:09] in you pulsating it goes on anyhow you
[27:12] can't slow it up stop it or start it it
[27:15] stops and starts and slows up you see
[27:19] it's the one that has control
[27:21] thanks fine brethren for their testimony
[27:24] of our Lord Jesus they wouldn't speaking
[27:27] of me of course on him I was reading a
[27:30] little article here not long ago about
[27:32] mr. moody said Chicago was colder
[27:37] newspapers go write an editorial on me
[27:39] and they scented him someone happened to
[27:41] find out why people gathered to hear it
[27:43] mr. Moody the editorial mr. moody is
[27:46] like myself he didn't have enough
[27:48] education to read the editorials so his
[27:51] manager had to read it mr. moody was a
[27:53] shoe cobbler formerly and he was called
[27:56] of God for a message of his an hour and
[27:59] so the manager was reading the editorial
[28:02] that said why would anybody go to here
[28:04] the white moody said in the first place
[28:06] he's a ugliest man I ever seen and said
[28:09] he's bald-headed and long whiskers and
[28:11] so forth and said and he he whines when
[28:15] he talks his grammars worst I ever heard
[28:17] and and always just carrying on like
[28:20] that and said mr. Moody just shook his
[28:22] shorts that's certainly not to come to
[28:24] see Christ so that's it I think that's
[28:26] us the answer
[28:28] it's Christ that we want to see if I be
[28:30] lifted up I'll draw all men unto me I
[28:33] was thinking extra visiting here in them
[28:36] the city and finding it the people how
[28:41] nicely been what a nice meeting we're
[28:43] having him here at the Denham Springs
[28:45] High School or School Auditorium I was
[28:48] thinking that people here something like
[28:50] the coffee it's a not quantity but it's
[28:59] quality a lot more uncut I remember my
[29:09] first time landing at the airport out
[29:11] here the brothers coming to get me
[29:14] sitting here and a little french girl
[29:16] there I asked for a hamburger a cup of
[29:18] coffee I never drink it to all that was
[29:20] 38 years old all to know better
[29:22] but and brother brown oh yes he's here
[29:25] this morning somewhere who's sitting
[29:27] right here you like it so well he got me
[29:28] I'd have a minister Oh breakfast at 7
[29:30] o'clock one at eight o'clock one at nine
[29:32] o'clock
[29:33] you couldn't eat all that so they pour
[29:34] coffee and I got this occipital got to
[29:36] drink so I asked this girl before I want
[29:39] a hamburger in a cup of coffee when they
[29:41] brought the little cup out of my my
[29:43] shirt ID on her coffee right
[29:46] the first drink first swallow I took all
[29:49] my had to fight for bread the lanes that
[29:53] you must be a Yankee she's gonna be a
[29:57] Yankee catcher so that's why behind the
[30:00] people maybe not the greatest crowds
[30:01] I've ever spoke to but real genuine
[30:04] quality I'm grateful for them a
[30:07] listening audience somebody who sets and
[30:09] pays attention and what you're saying
[30:11] what's what I want you to do examine
[30:14] what a man says for the word of God
[30:16] and if it isn't right than it isn't
[30:18] right that's all if it is the word of
[30:20] God then God's got to testify his word
[30:22] cause he promised to so that's why we
[30:26] like to examine these things too to find
[30:29] out I understood this morning and this
[30:32] was a be a business man's breakfast and
[30:36] for gospel businessman which I'm a
[30:39] member of their chapter think this they
[30:43] said some of them was here some of them
[30:45] didn't get out maybe their business man
[30:47] he got their business he had to tend to
[30:50] go to give him excuse anything so that's
[30:54] how I said many of their people were
[30:55] here anyhow so that's very funny not
[30:59] just a little joke I've told it but
[31:02] maybe it's not a place to joke of course
[31:04] it's just a little sense of humor
[31:05] you talk like we've been a while ago it
[31:08] maybe get people back on some sense of
[31:11] humor I remember one time the friend and
[31:15] I were school together
[31:16] it was Wilmer Snyder's brothers a
[31:19] Baptist minister knee he writes in this
[31:22] Upper Room a column in the upper room we
[31:25] were schoolboys together not studied the
[31:28] ministry and he had become an insurance
[31:30] agent and so uh he come to my house one
[31:35] day to visit me and maybe some insurance
[31:38] agents shared hypotheses about insurance
[31:40] now I don't think wrong with this but it
[31:43] catched a little hang of what I said it
[31:45] so my brother also is has the Prudential
[31:50] and he sells Prudential Insurance so one
[31:53] time I had a little something done by
[31:56] surance company that I'm I guess not
[31:59] knowing very much I I read the policy
[32:01] took me wrong and it's misrepresented to
[32:03] me and I just never did take it out so
[32:05] one day Wilmer come up to see me he said
[32:09] I get long Billy I said fine so here
[32:12] he's been out in the meetings I said yes
[32:14] time out means I was telling him about a
[32:16] fella said it me and said say you're a
[32:18] preacher what are you doing hanging
[32:19] around these businessmen I said I am a
[32:22] businessman and they said oh my business
[32:26] union I said assurance business and
[32:30] saying didn't get it I understand
[32:31] insurance I said uh sure assurance
[32:35] business I want the what insurance do
[32:40] you sell I said I sell eternal life for
[32:43] sure and I'm still selling so on I'd be
[32:50] in if any of you interested I like to
[32:52] talk to policy with you and the medium
[32:54] it's all right so he he said he said I
[32:58] eternal life said I don't mean by ever
[33:01] heard of the company I saw you know it's
[33:07] an old establishment he said where's the
[33:10] headquarters that's nothing glory Wilbur
[33:16] said to me he said Billy I thought I'd
[33:18] come up sell you some insurance that I
[33:20] hear that they don't have any insurance
[33:22] and I said oh yes I have assurance oh
[33:25] I'm sorry I guess your brother you have
[33:29] it with him I said no not exactly then
[33:31] my wide looking isn't that what you must
[33:34] be telling a story shioda didn't have
[33:36] any insurance but she did you later I
[33:38] said assurance
[33:39] I'm not insurance he said what in
[33:42] Kjersti aunt Billie I said blessed
[33:44] assurance Jesus is mine all what a
[33:47] foretaste of glory divine I'm an heir of
[33:50] salvation purchase of God born down his
[33:53] spirit washed in his blood he said Billy
[33:56] that's very nice
[33:57] that's very nice nothing against that
[33:59] but so that will punch if you're in this
[34:01] graveyard you're going I said he'll get
[34:02] me
[34:08] I'm not bothered by getting in is
[34:10] getting out so this is only under we'll
[34:13] get you out so if you're interesting
[34:14] getting out let us talk to you about it
[34:16] looking up on the audience this morning
[34:18] I won't keep you just a little bit and
[34:21] I've had a text let's go to preach from
[34:23] so then I
[34:24] oh wow they're not do that I just go to
[34:26] have a little drama of something in a
[34:29] character in the Bible and thinking hero
[34:32] under serious manners but while we're
[34:36] sitting here as Christians I suppose
[34:37] most of us did you know this may be the
[34:41] last time they will ever eat breakfast
[34:44] together
[34:44] did you ever think of that and you
[34:47] realize what little words that I have to
[34:49] stay here God's gonna make me answer
[34:51] fart out there at the day of judgment
[34:53] now I have soul journal nerves a smaller
[34:56] group but yet I have it's the word did I
[35:00] say I have to answer for them out there
[35:03] so we may never eat another breakfast
[35:07] together but I hope we get a separate
[35:09] again Sunday that's the light supper tea
[35:11] up there with him it'll be the first one
[35:14] there and then as we set here this
[35:16] morning and look up on these man here
[35:18] some of them great ministers who studied
[35:22] and me here just Bushmen come out no
[35:27] education set your man is qualified to
[35:29] preach and doctors in divinity feel very
[35:32] little stand tall or man like then but
[35:34] yeah I got to express what I feel and
[35:37] their great gratitude and kindness to
[35:41] let me stand and do this I appreciated
[35:43] brothers cooperating in the meeting and
[35:45] getting together I'm here to help you
[35:48] I'm going to do everything I can for
[35:50] each one of you by the grace of God man
[35:52] once all over some me I don't get to eat
[35:55] breakfast with you again it's all over
[35:58] studying across the table for one
[36:00] another
[36:03] no doubt what little tears run down our
[36:05] cheeks look across the table and get
[36:07] each other to the hand it means
[36:09] something named s work was time to work
[36:12] while the Sun's up it'll be down a tree
[36:14] logs getting very low then to think that
[36:17] while we're sitting here holding each
[36:18] other's hands and waiting a little then
[36:20] the great king you come out all of his
[36:22] great rollers come down along the line
[36:25] wipe all tears away Ferran says well
[36:28] done my good and faithful servants
[36:29] entering to the joys of the Lord has
[36:32] been prepared for you since the
[36:33] foundation of the world while the Sun's
[36:36] up it's light enough to labor that's
[36:38] labor
[36:39] now this little texture may seem kinda
[36:44] ridiculous but we're going to talk on
[36:47] this subject he was to pass this way it
[36:52] must have been a an awful night on the
[36:55] little fella he couldn't sleep at all it
[36:58] is rolled and tossed all night long he's
[37:02] breaking day and we all know what those
[37:05] restless nights mean it can't sleep got
[37:08] someone you're not or something he's got
[37:11] your nerves all upset this little fellow
[37:13] was a business man maybe in a city
[37:17] Jericho which is something like you
[37:21] businessmen and women here and he he no
[37:26] doubt had a growing business he's stood
[37:28] in good with all the clubs and so forth
[37:30] and was a member of the church Sanhedrin
[37:34] Council and had a fine priest and he
[37:37] believed this priest and a strange thing
[37:40] about this case always his wife will
[37:42] color Rebecca she had strayed off on the
[37:47] wrong side he thought so did the priest
[37:49] she was following a man that was
[37:52] supposed to be a prophet of Nazareth man
[37:56] named Jesus for the people the poor
[38:00] class of people believed him to be a
[38:02] prophet our Messiah that was promised
[38:07] but it didn't meet just the
[38:08] qualifications of the Sanhedrin strange
[38:12] sometimes God does things all of the
[38:15] color
[38:16] we think it ought to be in this fella
[38:18] you see was born to their opinion
[38:21] illegitimate birth his mother gave birth
[38:25] to him before her and her husband was
[38:27] married another thing he had no
[38:29] schooling it had no record he ever going
[38:32] to school he was not a priest
[38:35] it was he a rabbi he just had claims
[38:38] like of his own but a Don's a great
[38:42] estate this morning it was a turning the
[38:43] corner they didn't recognize it it
[38:47] usually happens that way come to that
[38:50] corner time but somehow another his wife
[38:53] had been persuaded that he was that
[38:57] prophet that was to come and she had
[39:00] followed him believing and she tried to
[39:03] tell her husband but he was so carried
[39:06] away in his business and with the Blanca
[39:09] Church isn't that good enough something
[39:11] like the rich young ruler you know he
[39:13] had a business also but he realized and
[39:16] he was a member the church but he didn't
[39:18] have eternal life and he has he's seen
[39:20] something in Jesus that other man didn't
[39:22] have and he said come to him and said
[39:24] I'd you wanted to know what he could do
[39:27] to have eternal lines and Jesus told him
[39:28] keep the commandments he said I've done
[39:30] this fence it was he used since showing
[39:32] he was a believer but he knew that Jesus
[39:35] had something that those priests and
[39:37] rabbis didn't have and when a man ever
[39:39] comes in contact with Jesus Christ he's
[39:41] different from me you're never the same
[39:44] when he once seen if there's any spark
[39:47] of God about you so Rebecca had found
[39:50] this Jesus and he he was to her exactly
[39:55] the full filling of the promise that the
[39:57] Jews had been looking for or their day
[40:00] so the news that got around that he was
[40:03] going to have a breakfast or some kind
[40:06] of a dinner or something down in Jericho
[40:08] so it she had got busy to bring about
[40:12] her businessmen husband
[40:14] we need more Rebecca's everywhere and so
[40:18] you see prayer changes things
[40:21] if you lay your husband or your unsaved
[40:23] one before God and then pray God will
[40:26] make a way somewhere cause he promised
[40:28] to so that's what Rebecca being a
[40:31] staunch believer and a follower of the
[40:34] Lord Jesus and a very fine sweet person
[40:37] she must have been she had interested in
[40:42] her household I think if that reflects
[40:45] again that if a person every meets Jesus
[40:49] and finds him really in your heart
[40:51] you're interested not only in your own
[40:54] household but the household of God
[40:55] everywhere you're interested if they
[40:58] know me and to know him is life know him
[41:03] you not know how to read the word or so
[41:07] but know him his life so she prayed hard
[41:12] and that they grew close to when Jesus
[41:16] was forced to enter the city no doubt
[41:19] but the day before she might have seen
[41:22] if his attitude to change Danny
[41:24] so she said maybe Zacchaeus are are you
[41:28] going to that breakfast in the morning
[41:30] why certainly not while that bunch of
[41:35] people would you respect me I've got the
[41:37] best restaurant in town they hold it
[41:40] over the Vince keys I hope there's not a
[41:41] Levinsky here but then anyhow over the
[41:44] other places seeing why I got the best
[41:47] place in town they picked that place
[41:48] down there where they ought to come to
[41:50] my place the whole this he wasn't going
[41:52] then she got the brain really
[41:55] desperately so then that night the
[41:58] little fella couldn't rest at all you
[41:59] know is something about it if you go to
[42:02] really desperately praying about
[42:04] something God works on both ends no
[42:06] [Music]
[42:07] answers so the little fella must have
[42:10] got to thinking that night wonder if I
[42:12] should go down and and and hear this man
[42:15] now Rebecca says that he's a prophet now
[42:19] we know we haven't had meat prophets for
[42:21] hundreds of years and I asked the priest
[42:23] that body said nothing but just the
[42:25] nonsense if there be a prophet raised up
[42:28] when we come through the church that's
[42:30] the way it had to come he had come to us
[42:32] Pharisees
[42:33] badges Caesar our group rate wouldn't be
[42:35] a problem you know that attitude still
[42:37] holds so they think it has to come that
[42:41] way or isn't right
[42:42] so they said holdout in this great time
[42:46] and she believed it anyhow he discussed
[42:49] it with the priest the priest sent up
[42:50] here damn days of profits have been many
[42:53] many years ago we've got the law we've
[42:55] got the whole Road out The Situation's
[42:57] under control and we got in our hands
[42:59] and we know about these things but then
[43:02] scores Zacchaeus not looking into it
[43:04] just absolutely just pursue me taking it
[43:07] for granted the word pursue mr. venture
[43:10] without authority well he he thought
[43:13] that that was all right as long as he's
[43:14] going to the church that's all he had to
[43:16] do but then his night begin to come on
[43:19] there come a sudden desire in his heart
[43:22] maybe if this person is in town he may
[43:25] never be here again I should go and
[43:28] investigate that the situation see for
[43:31] myself that's a good idea look at over
[43:34] yourself don't go to criticize take the
[43:36] word examine the word
[43:38] so she Rebecca had tried as a woman
[43:41] could to explain that what the prophets
[43:44] had said what Moses had said this person
[43:47] would be when he comes so she must have
[43:49] thought try to explain it to him again
[43:50] the priest had much more influence over
[43:53] him and what Rebecca his wife did then
[43:56] morning began to dawn want the little
[44:00] fella was Rebecca I can imagine her seen
[44:03] her punching said Zacchaeus you mean to
[44:06] say you don't want you to go down
[44:07] followed all nothing to do with it you
[44:10] know and don't be ready don't be
[44:12] disgusted read back at some time that's
[44:13] a good science he did this when he get
[44:15] so discouraged to talk about it and
[44:17] everything else that's a pretty good
[44:18] sign somehow so hey while Rebecca act
[44:23] like she's asleep only she was pretty
[44:25] and she finds Zacchaeus slips out of bed
[44:28] real easy and goes over and grooms he
[44:32] self all up and combs his hair just
[44:35] right and puts on his best garment and
[44:37] she peeped over out of one eye to see
[44:40] what he was doing she knew right then
[44:41] god of answered prayer she knew
[44:43] something's go to take place so exact
[44:45] his tip told I'm not letting Rebecca no
[44:48] worries are going you know he slips out
[44:50] it's outside and looks back she raises
[44:52] up the curtain looks like steam going on
[44:54] so thank you Lord it's alright now they
[44:57] like Elijah did when he said I've seen
[44:59] that the cloud the size of a man's hand
[45:01] just the first little evidence
[45:03] something's fixed the hand in it so he
[45:05] goes out and down the street she said I
[45:07] understand he's going to enter in by the
[45:09] south gate so I better go over there and
[45:11] stand said I'll get me a place and I'll
[45:13] stand right there and when he comes in
[45:15] I'll see how much profit that fella is
[45:17] me and I'm going to walk right out and
[45:19] put my finger under his nose and I'm
[45:21] going to give him a piece of my mind and
[45:24] when he comes and I'm going to tell him
[45:25] that all his nonsense is closed my wife
[45:28] and these prayer meetings and things I'm
[45:30] getting sick and tired of it I'm going
[45:32] I'm going to say something about this
[45:33] I'll tell him and I don't know rabbi or
[45:37] certainly pat me on the back you say
[45:39] Zach is your a good member of the church
[45:41] sir a fine fella it's always said I'll
[45:45] get out of there early so you got down
[45:48] when he got about a block or two of the
[45:51] gate come to find out the place was
[45:53] jammed it was hanging on the walls
[45:55] everywhere somehow another even though
[45:59] he was talked about there's somebody
[46:01] still like to hear he somebody would
[46:03] listen so he said now how am I gonna
[46:06] ever seen come in the gate remember the
[46:08] Bible said he was small expansion and he
[46:12] said I'm too little so he pushed around
[46:14] her give me a little room you can tell
[46:17] he isn't the Christian yet is he acting
[46:19] like that Christians don't have that
[46:21] attitude stand back you know my mom
[46:24] Zacchaeus I own the restaurant up here
[46:26] said on my way that even the Christian
[46:29] everybody know what he wasn't maybe
[46:31] someone knew that Rebecca was praying
[46:33] well they said you just stand back and
[46:35] so he know what he never get to see man
[46:37] all that crowd so he wouldn't be able to
[46:39] express these thoughts to me so he
[46:41] thought well now while I do maybe I'll
[46:44] go back home and just forget the whole
[46:46] matter but you know there's something
[46:47] about it that when you make up your mind
[46:51] that you
[46:51] see there's nothing gonna stop
[46:54] interesting care what it is your your
[46:57] persistence and like the little Greek
[47:01] woman was persistent to get to Jesus and
[47:03] there's something about it that whenever
[47:05] you make up your mind that you're going
[47:07] to seeing there is nothing going to stop
[47:09] it but remember when you make up your
[47:10] mind then the devil is gonna do
[47:13] everything he can to stop
[47:14] he's determinate you're not going to
[47:16] understand it you're not going to see it
[47:18] you'll throw ever black sheet across he
[47:21] can to keep you from spinning so there
[47:23] was his first barricade right there so
[47:25] then you start off said well I guess and
[47:28] looked over there and there stood
[47:29] Sonny's competitors and they he knew the
[47:33] end that some of the folks from the
[47:34] church so there he had made so much fun
[47:37] of this Jesus of Nazareth of being a
[47:38] prophet then your studies some of his
[47:41] members look at he might down they're
[47:42] the same group he just couldn't be here
[47:44] he was identified that gets here already
[47:48] identified you know if there happened to
[47:51] be one here you're already mixed up in
[47:54] the group so they already know it over
[47:56] here so we just might as well get
[47:57] acquainted here you look around seen one
[48:03] standing here you know after all they're
[48:05] all about like you and they they want to
[48:07] find out something a man knows that he
[48:09] come from somewhere from the beyond and
[48:12] when he leaves he goes back somewhere
[48:14] and he's always trying to find something
[48:17] to find out where he come from and where
[48:19] is he going
[48:20] there's only one has that answer that's
[48:22] gone every man wants to look over that
[48:25] curtain when you see anything that can
[48:29] show you what's over the curtain where
[48:30] you been who you are and where you're
[48:32] going there's only one book of all the

[49:34] and tell him what I think of him I'll
[49:37] give him a piece of my mind
[49:39] so you took off weak the crowd went down
[49:41] I thought now which way will he go well
[49:44] he went down halleluja Avenue that's
[49:47] usually weight travels and went onto a
[49:50] man corner where it turns there to go
[49:52] down to the the eating place that's
[49:54] where you go you know hallelujah I
[49:56] haven't do an Amen Corner then you're
[49:58] ready to work so you went down to this
[50:01] corner stood there on the corner said
[50:02] now there's nobody here and when I ought
[50:05] oh it sounds ridiculous so then first
[50:09] thing you know he got onto this corner

[50:13] stand here when he comes by I'll find
[50:15] out how much profit he is I'll walk
[50:18] right out the street now how telling
[50:20] something so it's 10:30 how to get to
[50:22] thinking out just a minute you know if I
[50:25] was too small down there that crowd will
[50:28] probably go wherever he's going
[50:30] I don't know why harder when I talk to
[50:32] you I want to tell you so he'll hear me
[50:34] and I'm hollering amen hallelujah glory
[50:37] to God Hosanna to the earth to the
[50:40] Prophet it comes in the name of the Lord
[50:41] all they'll ever hear me all that noisy
[50:43] bunch so there's only one thing that
[50:46] they have crowd all around me and then I
[50:47] can't even seem at all so we have to
[50:50] look stand on the corner and there was
[50:51] an old familiar sycamore tree that's a
[50:55] good indiana tree so standing on the
[50:58] corner you go well if I could get up
[51:00] there on that limb and sit down then I'd
[51:02] be up there then I could really tell him
[51:05] when he comes back so he come to run or
[51:07] he's too small he couldn't get up to the
[51:08] land so I said well now there's only one
[51:11] thing I can do and there's that
[51:13] city garbage can sitting on the corner
[51:17] so he thought well now if I go over and
[51:19] get that garbage can and pick it up
[51:22] bring it over here then I can get the
[51:24] rest way up the tree from that that will
[51:25] help me so he goes over and the garbage
[51:29] disposal hadn't come by yet that morning
[51:31] is pretty heavy
[51:31] sorry eating small and he couldn't pick
[51:33] it up don't have one way to do it that's
[51:36] wrap his arms around it and he had on
[51:38] his best garment so you know it's always
[51:40] hindrance this when you're trying to see
[51:42] jeans especially that didn't make any
[51:44] difference when good garment or not he
[51:45] want to see Jesus yeah so he's going his
[51:48] arm around the garbage can so he could
[51:50] get over there so he scooted it over and
[51:53] there he had garbage all over he well
[51:55] that make a difference he he wanted to
[51:57] see him anyhow so while he was pushing
[51:59] the can over with his arms around he
[52:01] heard somebody laughing and he looked
[52:03] around if it wasn't a little bit see
[52:05] standing here his competitor said well
[52:07] why do you know exact is has because I
[52:10] got him a new job from his resident he's
[52:12] working for the garbage disposal you
[52:15] know the devil just wants to see what he
[52:17] can do to throw everything in your way
[52:19] and he can they keep you from seeing
[52:22] Jesus he'll tell you they're a bunch of
[52:24] holy rollers they'll tell you they're a
[52:26] bunch of idiots you say there there's
[52:29] nothing to they're just a poor trash of
[52:31] the city anything you can do but if
[52:33] you're determined to seen God will make
[52:36] a way to your mind something go take
[52:40] place if that hunger begins to break
[52:42] into your heart something you'll go see
[52:46] him anyhow so didn't make any difference
[52:49] little face turned red he was
[52:51] embarrassed but he just push the cannon
[52:53] over anyhow and got a hold of it and
[52:55] shut it up the tree
[52:56] that's all right shitty you southerners
[52:59] know what it is that climbed up the
[53:01] tree got up the tree and he got a
[53:03] 30-pound were two limbs come together
[53:05] and met in the trunk of the tree and
[53:08] there he set down now that's a good
[53:10] place to set or two ways meets
[53:13] yours and God your idea is that's a good
[53:17] time to sit down and think it over your
[53:20] own thoughts about it and what he's word
[53:22] says he is what you think he is and what
[53:26] the word
[53:26] says he is what the message of the hour
[53:29] is - you're thinking what the message of
[53:31] the hour is to his word that's the
[53:34] difference
[53:34] sit there and think it over a little
[53:36] while no doubt Satan got on one of these
[53:39] shoulders said you know what
[53:42] here are a pretty look inside sitting up
[53:45] here picking spinners out here thinking
[53:48] and with your best garment on and it all
[53:51] garbage all over and now your name will
[53:54] be published all through the city the
[53:56] jerk should be all on you because look
[53:58] what a racial thing you have done
[54:01] sitting see Satan when you make a start
[54:04] and he'll try to tell you made of era
[54:06] Mary said that condition he said well
[54:10] Rebecca said he was a prophet
[54:12] I'll give him a try I'm Steve he's a
[54:15] prophet now he said when he comes by
[54:19] here and I'll just disguise myself
[54:22] he'll never know I'm up here first I'll
[54:24] get a look at him and then when I seen
[54:27] then I'm gonna jump out of this tree and
[54:29] then I'll go down there and tell him I
[54:32] said now if he if he is a prophet or as
[54:36] Rebecca said that he was he might know I
[54:40] was up in this tree if that's true so
[54:44] I'll tell you I'll fix him up so he
[54:46] pulled all the leaves around him and
[54:48] disguised himself all over so he
[54:49] couldn't be seen him at one leap to look
[54:51] out it seemed as he turned the corner
[54:53] and then sitting there thinking it all
[54:56] over
[54:57] Edgar wali heard a noise coming around
[54:59] the corner strange wherever he's at he's
[55:02] always a lot of noise you know noise
[55:05] it's one block never the high priest
[55:09] when he dressed and went into the holy
[55:10] Savoy on the end of his garment he had a
[55:13] pomegranate and a panel and that noise
[55:16] in the holiest of Holies was the only
[55:19] way the waiters knew that he was alive
[55:21] or not it made a noise and whether you
[55:25] ain't no noise and mighty might be david
[55:27] i thinkit's watched a whole lot of other
[55:29] churches and hey
[55:30] there's not enough noise about it not
[55:32] look enthusiasm not enough something and
[55:36] so where Jesus is there's always the
[55:39] noise one time when he would come into
[55:41] Jerusalem they were screaming and
[55:43] hollering and whole Santa to the King
[55:45] that cometh in the name of the Lord and
[55:47] some of those priests and there said why
[55:49] make them keep still holder peace he
[55:51] said if they hold their peace the raxil
[55:53] trial
[55:53] something has to move no worse and then
[55:57] the old should believe and then he heard
[56:00] this noise that coming around the corner
[56:02] and screaming and going on so he thought
[56:05] well he must be approaching so he pulled
[56:08] up his lead and raised up look over
[56:10] I've got him all now we'll find out how
[56:13] much profit he is so I won he was
[56:16] sitting there with his leap up looking
[56:17] in and up in this tree way up of other
[56:19] heads where they had made the tree so
[56:22] when he noticed the first man coming
[56:24] around the corner must have been the
[56:26] Apostle Peter because he was a big
[56:28] strong burly sort of a man I can see
[56:30] pushing the crowds back soon friends I'm
[56:32] sorry
[56:33] our master had a great service last
[56:35] night much virtue is gone from me you
[56:38] all won't understand would you just
[56:40] stand aside so master can pass by please
[56:43] do that you're come Matthew Mark and M
[56:45] alone said nah we don't want to be rude
[56:47] we're not here for that purpose but our
[56:50] master is awfully tired he hasn't had
[56:52] his breakfast so we're we want you to
[56:54] stand aside if you will there was a man
[56:57] standing there that maybe his Anka's
[56:59] took a look at a few days before that at
[57:01] a one of the meeting business place a
[57:05] doctor had been there and told this
[57:08] little fella that had a little girl that
[57:10] was really sick of a fever and she
[57:13] wasn't want to live Sonny had done all
[57:15] he could do it for and Zacchaeus when he
[57:17] raised this leaf up look he's seen this
[57:21] man with this baby wrapped in this
[57:22] blanket coming around the corner you
[57:24] felt what a rational thing that that
[57:27] father would do trying to follow that
[57:30] that's so-called prophet hearing coming
[57:34] around the corner this baby in it with a
[57:35] fever sending out this wind but you know
[57:38] just Assange's when you really believe
[57:42] there's nothing go to hinder it and she
[57:45] boarded get that baby to you and every
[57:47] time did make it a corner change he'd be
[57:50] pushed back but he he was persistent he
[57:52] was going on bond at this corner the
[57:55] little mother run out with a baby in her
[57:57] arms that she must have fell down and
[57:59] she said Lord be merciful to my child
[58:02] there stood the father of the baby
[58:04] crying - which was a brand of Zacchaeus
[58:07] he said what's changed his attitude so
[58:12] he couldn't make out who the man was and
[58:14] he was down in the crowd all that
[58:16] watched he seized a hand stretch out and
[58:18] touched over the top this little blanket
[58:19] and the little girl was unwrapped went
[58:22] skipping down the street now there's got
[58:24] to be something to that Zacchaeus they
[58:25] finally come into view one who look at
[58:29] him Zacchaeus have done changed his
[58:31] opinion just one girl inside there he
[58:36] was he didn't look like me there was
[58:38] something different about me
[58:41] gentle kind yet the blanket means to
[58:43] speak the world would come to an end it
[58:46] was a different character from what he
[58:48] had his attitude began that all of his
[58:51] starched began to wash out what he's
[58:53] seen comes walking on down the street he
[58:58] thought over this little leaf looking
[58:59] over see what was taking place and he
[59:02] said walked he got right under to where
[59:04] he was he said you know that man could
[59:06] be a prophet maybe Rebecca was right she
[59:10] might know more about the scriptures
[59:11] than I did so he walked that on down we
[59:14] said head down walking along humble
[59:17] gentle as he always did the disciples
[59:19] keeping the people out of his way and
[59:21] he's being guarded a dream
[59:22] he stopped does that case looking over
[59:25] the lead something like that he looked
[59:27] up in the tree Zacchaeus come on
[59:34] not only did he know is is up in the
[59:37] tree but he know what his name yeah
[59:42] let's couple get down out of the trees
[59:48] he told him the America was done on him
[59:52] scene he said Lord I've been wrong I'm
[59:59] ready to confess it wrong if I took
[1:00:01] anything wrong I'll pay it back I'll
[1:00:04] give asthma good to poor jesus said
[1:00:06] today salvation has come what changed
[1:00:11] what was a change brother and sister
[1:00:13] think just for a moment but change was
[1:00:16] he had seen something real it heard all
[1:00:19] the promises have been made the priest
[1:00:22] talked about what was great prophet
[1:00:25] Moses great this stand the other
[1:00:27] promising too great something in the
[1:00:30] future but ignoring what's being done
[1:00:32] now that's the way of man he saw
[1:00:35] something genuine something that he can
[1:00:39] see himself the American happened to him
[1:00:41] he was that prophet because he didn't
[1:00:45] know him neither would he ever seen him
[1:00:47] up in the tree but when he got right
[1:00:48] under the tree he stopped and looked up
[1:00:51] and said Zacchaeus come down but they
[1:00:54] salvations come to your house brethren
[1:00:56] it's the real thing
[1:00:59] it changes man's mind changes their
[1:01:02] energy sometimes it's oppressed surely
[1:01:04] to get to it but if you're going to
[1:01:06] proach Christ this morning with with the
[1:01:09] the thought in your heart that I will
[1:01:12] not be critical but I'll study the
[1:01:14] scripture in see what he was if he come
[1:01:18] to the meeting tonight before you come
[1:01:20] study and see what he wants whatever he
[1:01:23] was he has to be the same today
[1:01:25] his as I spoke last I have many of you
[1:01:28] were there he has God identify himself
[1:01:30] by his characteristic he always must
[1:01:34] remain that way because he's the same
[1:01:36] yesterday today forever
[1:01:37] man's hearts are our soul a real
[1:01:42] god-fearing man or woman businessman or
[1:01:45] whatever it is he's always is something
[1:01:49] in his heart if there's any God fear
[1:01:51] about him to know something about God
[1:01:53] say I never told you what happened to
[1:01:56] Zacchaeus he'd become a member of the
[1:01:58] Full Gospel businessman chapter Jericho
[1:02:00] they done I wanted to tell you about him
[1:02:02] first
[1:02:03] well sure he would be nothing that's
[1:02:04] before gospel of course not that's all
[1:02:05] Jesus a priest so he become a member
[1:02:08] there you are to be a member of the same
[1:02:10] now notice but he wanted to see
[1:02:13] something real and when he saw something
[1:02:15] real himself that was scripturally
[1:02:17] identified then he was ready it's a real
[1:02:21] things that meant there's a little story
[1:02:24] for closer how many in here's hunters I
[1:02:27] see your hands my brother need here I
[1:02:30] know it wasn't lonely so I loved it
[1:02:34] and I I used to go up in the North Woods
[1:02:38] up and New Hampshire's the home of the
[1:02:41] white-tailed deer
[1:02:42] how I loved to hunt them now used to go
[1:02:45] up every year and I had a partner of
[1:02:47] their name Berta call upon the finest
[1:02:50] man I ever hunted with and my nature has

[1:02:56] woods and I just seem like is raised up
[1:02:58] there even my conversion never took it
[1:03:00] out not so much to get the game but just
[1:03:02] to be in the woods I think God is there
[1:03:04] seem high moves and the nature how it
[1:03:08] dies and goes down comes back again and
[1:03:11] resurrection the Sun comes up of the
[1:03:13] morning a little baby barn and then

[1:06:50] some hot chocolate and because it's got
[1:06:53] fuel to it children and then ever
[1:06:55] sandwich now we separate was getting up
[1:06:57] high towards Timberline so I thought
[1:06:59] maybe that Burt was going to have me
[1:07:00] sandwiches we sit down pull out this
[1:07:02] thermos and the authorities going to
[1:07:04] pull it out
[1:07:05] and I just let set my gun down against a
[1:07:07] tree and start at your mind but what he
[1:07:09] was he was getting that a little whistle
[1:07:11] out so when he got this little whistle
[1:07:13] out he blew it and anyone ever heard a
[1:07:15] little old baby fawn cries kind of
[1:07:17] pitiful anyhow and when he blew that
[1:07:19] whistle
[1:07:19] to my surprise rod across a great big
[1:07:24] mother daughter student now the dog is a
[1:07:26] mother deer so she stood up there was
[1:07:29] her big brown eyes the big ears pointed
[1:07:32] rod up like that see her baby was in
[1:07:36] trouble and he blew it again and she
[1:07:39] looked around and she walked right out
[1:07:42] into that opening now that's unusual any
[1:07:44] new hunters and all that for a deer to
[1:07:46] do that she walked out there I could see
[1:07:48] her big eyes she once spent over 20
[1:07:50] yards from me and I thought oh bird you
[1:07:54] can't do that and it kill that poor
[1:07:57] precious mother her looking for her baby
[1:07:59] and you deceiving her like that and this
[1:08:02] whistle had lowered and she was
[1:08:04] she walked out there and the hunter
[1:08:07] raised that labor on his 3006 rifle or
[1:08:10] dropped it down that cocked the gun you
[1:08:12] know if it's a jail and she heard that
[1:08:14] and she looked around and she saw the
[1:08:17] hunter her ears speech right down
[1:08:20] usually they'd been gone and she would
[1:08:23] walked out there to first place at that
[1:08:24] time of day but you see she was a mother
[1:08:28] there was something in her she had
[1:08:31] something genuine something she wasn't
[1:08:34] putting on no show she was a mother she
[1:08:38] was borned another and her baby was in
[1:08:41] trouble that was to her interest and he
[1:08:46] looked up at me and those lizard looking
[1:08:48] eyes and his green I said Burt don't do
[1:08:50] it to her
[1:08:51] he just grew him turned her out that
[1:08:54] rifle oh my he's a dead shot now know
[1:08:57] when that scope air come across her
[1:08:59] loyal motherly heart you know what
[1:09:02] playing through her see she was 10 in 20
[1:09:04] yards a big 180 grand Green hundred
[1:09:07] eighty grain mushroom bullet and there
[1:09:10] he would just build her heart plum
[1:09:11] through both sides I thought how can you
[1:09:14] be so cruel as the blow had precious
[1:09:18] mothers are out of her and her sinking
[1:09:20] her baby how can you do that bird
[1:09:23] I just thinking to myself I've seen his
[1:09:26] arms study down I couldn't look at it I
[1:09:28] just couldn't turn my back I couldn't
[1:09:32] see that that genuine loyal mother
[1:09:35] standing there
[1:09:36] she wasn't hypocrite she was just
[1:09:38] putting it on for a sideshow she was a
[1:09:41] mother that's what she's doing death it
[1:09:45] mean nothing to her the baby was in
[1:09:48] trouble she thought more of her baby she
[1:09:50] never alone live let the murder shoot
[1:09:52] whatever it was her loyal heart was
[1:09:54] beatin her mother hood that motherhood
[1:09:57] in ER was calling her baby was crying
[1:10:00] there was something inside of her
[1:10:03] pulsating was real how could that cruel
[1:10:07] hunter
[1:10:07] blow that law hard I just couldn't see
[1:10:11] it I turn my head Lord God don't do it
[1:10:15] I stayed like this I couldn't hear that
[1:10:16] I didn't hear the gunfire this is too
[1:10:19] much
[1:10:20] I'll wait the gun number five I turned
[1:10:25] around looking this going like this he
[1:10:29] couldn't do it you turn around I looked
[1:10:31] at me in those big eyes have changed
[1:10:34] tears I was running down his cheeks he
[1:10:37] looked at me two lips quivering he told
[1:10:38] the girl in the snowbank and grabbed me
[1:10:40] the trouser leg he said Billie I've had
[1:10:42] enough of it lead me to that Jesus
[1:10:45] you're talking about there on that
[1:10:48] snowdrift I led him to the Lord Jesus
[1:10:51] why he saw something really he'd been
[1:10:55] all kinds of churches he's seen
[1:10:57] something that wasn't put on you've seen
[1:11:01] something it was genuine friends we
[1:11:07] might have Church rules and Church
[1:11:09] regulations and theologies and
[1:11:10] everything else but there's a real
[1:11:12] genuine Jesus let's look between you
[1:11:16] just now as we go with your heads bowed
[1:11:20] or like to ask you a question your
[1:11:22] hearts bound to how many in here not do
[1:11:28] who profess Christian
[1:11:31] if a profession is all you have but how
[1:11:35] many of you would like to be as much
[1:11:37] Christian as that dare was a mother or
[1:11:42] something so genuine in you it seemed
[1:11:46] more than your life or anything at your
[1:11:48] hand you say it may say this brother
[1:11:50] Brennan I belong to church I'm a
[1:11:52] businessman businesswoman or one more
[1:11:54] housewife but really to be that type of
[1:11:58] a Christian and I could lay the whole
[1:12:00] world aside span the criticism or
[1:12:03] anything I'd like to be as much I'd like
[1:12:08] to be in my heart a Christian is that
[1:12:10] dear was a mother with your heads bowed
[1:12:14] on your eyes closed before God I ask you
[1:12:18] in Christ's name at the ending of the
[1:12:21] age would you just put up your hand
[1:12:23] take Megan Oliver call because there's
[1:12:25] no room but just say pray for me brother
[1:12:27] branham that automobile type of a
[1:12:29] Christian and that there was another
[1:12:31] cognition just pans everywhere that
[1:12:36] maybe as much Christian Zack is when you
[1:12:42] put your hand up that shows he's found
[1:12:43] you now horns just slide about how the
[1:12:46] tree here go home with you today for
[1:12:49] dinner he'll stay with you the rest of
[1:12:51] your days Heavenly Father we are
[1:12:55] grateful for the Lord Jesus his presence
[1:12:58] we're aware that there's something here
[1:13:01] that made man and women some of them
[1:13:03] even profess to be Christians for years
[1:13:07] but there was there something present
[1:13:12] that calls them even though they need
[1:13:15] professed even as Zacchaeus was but once
[1:13:18] the touch from Christ they lived in
[1:13:21] their hand as a testimony that something
[1:13:25] inside of him told them to do it let
[1:13:28] them know just now that's Jesus he was
[1:13:31] to pass this way this morning and he had
[1:13:37] there was I guess some 150 hands of Lord
[1:13:42] I pray that you'll visit each one and
[1:13:45] give to them the reality that it is to
[1:13:49] be a real Christian no matter how much
[1:13:53] the world tries to discourage and how
[1:13:57] much the others try to discourage us let
[1:14:00] us know that it's a fight to get there
[1:14:02] it's an effort we have to put forth but
[1:14:05] when connecting with something that's
[1:14:07] genuine real it changes us then I pray
[1:14:13] that you'll change every heart Lord and
[1:14:15] make everyone in divine presence at this
[1:14:17] time but the Holy Spirit in their life
[1:14:20] to be as much Christian as mother dear
[1:14:25] was a mother she was born a mother and
[1:14:28] may they be born of the Spirit of God
[1:14:31] and become a real follower of Jesus
[1:14:34] strike they they come from their
[1:14:36] sycamore trees today Granite Lord may
[1:14:40] you go home with each one of us and
