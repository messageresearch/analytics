work this way listen what is the end of it let me tell you the power of what you very top of the camera if it's not the way of the church [Music] are you with me when we are guarded there's no walls of separation of very differences it's the true brothers brother has shown us by many examples of an example but let us follow his example as i was a model for his age is the elder fault the bible is giving us advice of the elders that i have brought to you because it's the prophet he gave money with the easy way [Music] with your life the way where you have hatred selfishness you don't want to see the the happiness of christ you are destroying [Music] dead to go astray from the community of the beginning is death jericho are you a christian christian you're a christian and men in bethesda

seconds everything we say are you like it's here that was the creation the security officer it's here are you with me my testimony before those great men of god testimony he will give his own testimony god after listening the word of god god will condemn you to keep your spirit you keep your nature keep going in the direction in your life after receiving this preaching that's how you're going to sign your own condemnation fellowship make your choice prerequisites because we have a lot of false revivals just uh second event every revival producer i don't want to keep the class as brother i'm saying authentic but this revival genuinely revival that's none of this other twins will happen when people will go back to the world of daytime the word of the age many people with ghosts to see the pastor a second one shows this which is good but because when i'm sitting if you need the holy ghost have worked on personal go see the pastor it will help you i know a lot of people don't have it but listen to the power and they came you're gonna have the true revival now in your souls it's very simple pressure value to receive the true genuine revival to receive first the word the word of your age is that are you with salaam the prophet that's when the prophet says he doesn't you receive that power in the world come first to transform you amen and afterwards set with also preferred ultra shows that power can do something else by yourself you're not transformed you're the same person the simplest man oh i received the word from my hatred i received the holy ghost you're lying to yourself power has the said the word to transform read to another square footage the earth was filled transformed it was filled transformed by the words that is [Applause] radical transformation just surrender to my message the love for the souls dying for the hungry man the dying souls listen to the soul for which god has given you that gift for which you have that calling [Music] um us up today amen amen revolution they have to wake us up all believers of the word amen giving to my message i pray the truth his message if you believe the prophet is absolute look what he's saying are you with me he's the prophet who told you i have given you all the advice of god why would you go seek counsel in internet why are you going to seek in a console in the internet why you have to go back to your system to your choice to your nation to do certain things the prophet the prophet is there who is the message that declares the truth you need an advice you need something then put a beer to the company even the way you dress you control yourself [Music] you don't need your husband to be behind you you have to do the opportunity anyway you want to make me sure excuse me

secular the church has become what it has become the holy ghost has become rare there's a lot of faults there's a lot of foster christ there's a false preacher the classes william branham declares imitation the christianity nation of passage paragraph 82. observe the spiritual bride but because we have a corner right she's still colonel the bride was getting away from the line the puss the bride was going straight from the lion she exposed herself you get in the church secretary you want to see what is going on look at the sisters the sisters give a testimony but just be careful if you give a false testimony be careful because of the false testimony remember even your appealing matters it in the inside remember the prophet i do you love the prophet continuing would you continue to love me too okay shall continue oh my god i'm carrying on upset when opposed to spirituality observe the spiritual right what does it mean what venus an epiphany to come doesn't mean [Applause] like a celebrity of hollywood to style i personate the world to have their feelings of the world she went away forgotten look at the world when the message came spirit came in the message [Applause] those demons look at the spiritual bride when she started having the revival it's when she started going back second jeffy to what god wants amen amen the man comes back amen amen communicating up his hands their hands lifted up it means i give up i surrender amen [Applause] the message the church you have a great baby in paris as she was playing uh going going home going home i was wondering [Applause] [Applause] there's no repentance no dry eyes [Music] and she's lining up with the word of god and the prophet says if you live in a series of adoptions you have to line up one to another brothers and sisters i was invited he greeted the brother was on the side and then he came before me he just looked at me he jumped and then he went to school greetings the other people i checked myself i never had a problem with him secretary what kind of attitude is that prayer brother look what the prophet says if you cannot respect the man respect at least respect his office commander to speak people do it and others the holy ghost can lead the man divine so act like that before the man of god it forever but brother venom says before the restriction you got to respect that if the public is not there juventus you want to be the beast if the public was nothing beast because he's fulfilling the scripture even if he's the first one just respect himself because we know that we will be forced to also doing the work so that the word of god might be fulfilled if you cannot respect a man at least respect his office respect yourself respect to the servant of god commander said this without saying no why don't you just say the man you see we can the truth destroy everything we declare to be experienced start from scratch from the justification it's very important to find the truth or negatively i have to destroy your refuse that spirit and prove it to a member of the spirit and check your own spirit officially and refuse it and seek the genuine word and it's there you're going to have it amen amen amen the church all beloved brothers what could we say amen amen what could we say that is why the prophet said submission before anything there's no it can be in the man of god that is unfounded don't you look at the group god is speaking to you god once comes up as i started talking here the series of adoptions it says we have to line up double first with one another getting refresher brothers and sisters to become one are you with me when you meet your brother it's really your breakfast do second doesn't come he's like in a couple in front complicated a complicated wife she doesn't want to listen it's not the reason for the husband to prevent the food the security the the security you will give an account to god that's how we have to be are you with me to line up with one another with the word of god as long do you you can take your decisions be sincere be sincere it's your life what does it cost you refuse that experience just refuse that experience refuse that
