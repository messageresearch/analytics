behold I come quickly and May and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be [Music] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last May the Lord add blessing in the reading of his word you may be seated so I think there was one announcement left behind here uh the pastor want to let you know that on Friday the 25th 25th October right of this month we're going to have a meeting in the afternoon like from 6 as usual as we we have on Wednesday so it's going to be for Friday the 25th October because we're going to have a a a visitor a visiting minister to preach us the word amen amen so Wednesday we still going to have our regular service and Friday we're going to have also a meeting and a visitor a preacher going to preach us amen so please keep the date and prepare accordingly amen so we thank God also to have Papa Greg among us God bless you Papa we are happy to have you amen I see our Mama she's happy right yeah because most of the time she she sit alone but now papa is there amen God bless you mama here is your shirt I'm I'm wearing your shirt God bless you we love you and we ask God to give you a long life amen and today you can tell God you can ask God everything you want as long as I'm preaching with you ask God everything you want and I believe he's going to give it to you amen amen amen so as we still sitting let turn again our Bible in Luke Luke we're going to read in Luke chapter 17 from verse 26 to wow the time is flying and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did itat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and Brin Stone from heaven and destroyed them all [Music] even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen amen amen amen so we may say because if even in the churches people read this but they don't understand what as we do understand but when you read you said they were eating they were marrying they were giving their children to marriage what is wrong with that there is nothing wrong with that because even us we doing the same but there was something and there is something which is the main thing that them they neglect that it was the presence of Noah amen with a message here is come here enter in because the rain fall and you going to perish amen amen that's the details and today as the Bible says it's going to be the same thing if the same thing if we are eating if we are drinking if we are marrying if we giving our children to marriage if that has to be the same thing it means Noah has to be also somewhere warning people for the to come are you there church are you there because eating is not bad marrying is not bad giving our children to marriage is not bad amen but one details is they miss to see the message amen yes sir which was supposed to prepare them to give them the Hiding Place against the and today we have Noah in the camp amen if it has to be the same Noah has to be in the camp but remember that side that side that side in that time it was about the water it was about the rain but now it's about the fire we are not getting in the AR but we are going up in the Rapture right so we have a Noah who Noah yeah the Noah of the age is brother Bram William Mar [Music] Bram is's not around the message is there because the angel told you I'm sending you with the message the message of preparation Amen brother amen amen sister amen sir so as you eat as you drinking as you marry as you giving your children to marriage you have also to give your ears to Noah if you don't want to be surprised like that day amen amen so if we can give the subject our subject going to be wake up clean our life and get ready amen Church wake up wake up clean our lives and get ready amen amen but Richard since they've been telling us you know that that started even since Noah even when Jesus came they were telling us the world is at the end the end of the world is there but tell me how many years we still living on Earth we are closer now than sir that reason we are coming to church amen amen so brothers and sister this morning I want you to be like you are in front of the mirror amen amen maybe today we not going to jump but today we need to face our reality are you there with me look it's good to come to church but for what end it's good to say I am a Christian yes it's good but for what end there is two persons that you cannot lie yourself and God so this morning I want you to put yourself like in front of the mirror but this time here the mirror of the word let us examine Our Lives am I ready are you ready you know last time I preached I preached here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come and I've been talking about how our beloves brothers and sisters are leaving us they are going ahead of [Music] us amen amen but brother let the question be asked this morning because we are facing we may face two things to meet God we might face two things death or Rapture talking about death if it comes as you sitting there are you ready are you ready sister are you ready brother I like the way you staying quiet that means it getting in let see ourself true through the mirror of the word you know be sincere about yourself as you cannot lie yourself you cannot likee God either but now are you really a Christian if they speak or they Count Christian as we sitting here can you really be counted among those there is still time you know there is still time I'm still young let me enjoy and at the last minute at the last minute tomorrow does not belong to you that's right tomorrow does not belong to you that's right get ready brother get ready sister brothers and sisters if you never been baptized in water let me be straight with you you you never start the journey as yet brother I was baptized when I was in the Pentecostal Church what seed were you feeding with now you know the light why are you pushing for tomorrow what you no I've been baptized brother I cannot do it the second time I can Pro to you in the Bible act 19 there was people who were already baptized but when Paul meet them and asked them have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe no we we we didn't even hear about such so which way were you baptized ah you you are still young you young preacher you don't know nothing me it was a journey himself the one who baptized Jesus that you preaching is the one who bz but Paul instructed them to be reaped why are you waiting for why even if you are in the message but your life is always up up and down ups and down no Victory Che your life maybe your decision was not taken correctly you can be reaped brothers and sisters let us be serious about ourselves amen amen because one of these days this it's going to be closed you going to be sitting there for the last time let me tell you let me preach like I am preaching my last sermon because tomorrow does not belong to us I'm already baptized you know check your life which way way are you living how are you living amen amen our young sister sitting here in the I want you to look at me don't face down look at me if today God decides to take your life are you sure you're going to be the other side because you know the problem today when somebody pass our brother pass the pastor won't say anything evil he will say now our brother is now in heaven our brother is the other side yeah he will never come and say this one is pass is in hell I I never heard that but the reality it maybe something else God there you will look at and say he's where since I've been waiting for him where is he he never came here Pastor for but that sister that brother that you seeing is here is is not even here but you let me tell you something when you are ready to cross the Jordan God will develop your s you going to know where you going and that time is going to be late for you as you still have the breath of life now you now in good health it's time to make your decision wake up Brothers wake up sister let clean our lives and be ready that's why you see when somebody want to die he start screaming remember that sister that is talking [Applause] about Darkness Darkness you will see where you going no way coming back it now it now are you there with me Church amen you know God's way sometimes we we we don't understand it and we don't have to understand it you can plan things you can meditate you can sacrifice the entire night but when you stand here every changes amen and then you know it's God's leading but sometimes us preacher we get mads let take our Bible in Ephesian chapter 5 May the Lord help us so seeing what's happening in the world oh brother we are nearing home we are nearing home Ephesians 5 ver 15 see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise you get what the Bible saying see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as Redeeming the time because the days are evil redeeming time because the days are wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is are you there with me Church redeeming time see what's happening in the world with the world and the rumors of wars everywhere see what is happening in Israel isra fighting for his it survival fighting in every front is there with eson with ir there with Syria everywhere Israel is fighting and remember isra is our clock nations are breaking Israel are working brothers and sister sir I don't know how to tell you this but I'm trying only to give you a push most of the time we are becoming so negligent so we are getting used to church we are coming to church as a tradition but we still okay with all those bad life which is attached to us am I ready are you ready we have to be ready brother we have to be ready but I know that the Lord is going to keep me because I want to be life amen amen but we never know we don't have control over our lives since brother as we have a breath of life what I want you to do this morning is to think on your ways blessings are good we need them blessings are good good we need them money I am the first one I need it amen but remember that not all if that was all then the president of this world they have some Advantage comparing to us there are stuff that you can never buy with money and the greatest blessing is eternal life reason why we are sitting here today get our hypocrisy outside let us face the reality where am I standing at with this message amen amen and you parent remember Noah had entered with his family Amen brother amen amen amen amen amen I I remember the Pastor said the other time I'm I'm I'm trying to get in my subject I'm trying my way to get in the Pastor said last time that uh if you can call it what the thing that we used to to bze people I don't know he said he said that has to stay there we kept that here no one came in you see now we remove it it's not no longer but it's still somewhere why are you waiting why are you waiting look to be baptized in water that the first step of Salvation justification amen amen if you didn't decide yourself since then you never start Christian Journey so what we are talking about here it doesn't even concern you because you know the truth but you don't want to do it so you are closing the door to yourself are you there with me church are you there with me Church brother I have a gift of Prophecy I even see things I was in the Pentecostal Church one of the the mighty Vel that people come to consult here we have the truth which can change your life that the very same thing the message that you are hearing and if you are so serious you know yourself that these people are different this message is different I've been in churches but the way they present the word the order in the church the way people wear clo the way they behave it's different so why can't you take your decision we will be more than happy to baptize you here forget about the what what what you had today in those churches it doesn't count doesn't count look when Noah was building the AR if you two you come you said no I'm also going to build the ark no the AR of Noah had the instruction from God but if you said I don't know come on brother I don't know I want to build my own ar your Ark going to sink don't don't talk to me about about about your baptism iard my baptism your one is not going to stand comparing to the know as one you know what happen to people it's only Pride it's only Pride these days those small debor goodness Anna they getting baptized and you see me Big Mama to put me the same level look let me tell for the kingdom of God you have to be like a baby what are you going to waste what am I going to waste my pride going to bring me to the but if I humble myself I take the word of God I get baptized in water god promise in the Bible to give you the true Holy Spirit me too I have the Holy Spirit I have the Holy Spirit brother I don't need yours look the one you had before it was only the anointing it was here in your spirit only Church there is a fire too because we proph it's only in the spirit level but for you to be sa you need the seed of God in your soul and the Noah is here for that don't try to make your own way today we we went so low amen amen to help those who are still in that level because we need them we need them amen amen that the first step of Salvation look God has sent the prophet his name is William Amen to do what to prepare us for the Rapture and God has given to him as Noah all the instructions which is in the message get us ready for the Rapture that's right we not asking you stop wearing your pants then come we're not asking you stop stealing and come we ask you to come as you are and see if this message has not power to change your life some of us here we were like this some of our sisters here maybe some if there was not about God's grace some will be maybe prostitute but look at the grace of God today because of this message that you see them the way they are that's why sister don't neglect yourself so those ladies of the world that you see if you want to be like them you going to you you can be like them in a second but for them to be like you it's not easy so you don't have to copy them they have nothing good to give to you for them to be like you they have a long journey but for you to be like going be am if you never take your decision we are calling up on you today today might be the last call God is still saving amen am amen and in the Bible when they heard this when they heard this they ask Peter what shall we do told them repent and get baptized in water the genuine baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why for the remission of your sin and then when we preach you count yourself also among the righteous are you there church maybe today is going to be the last call why are you postponing tomorrow what you can do today ah those are small things you know yes we need those small things amen how can you have the big things when you don't know or you you you don't do the small things that's the beginning the St point I don't know how I took that road I don't know but remember the preacher who are preaching you the word we going to be the judges to those that we preach [Music] to those that we preach amen amen amen amen so it's on your hand because we say but those people Jesus really Jesus they ask them between Jesus and Barabas which want to release they really sayas the instead of Jesus oh if I was there that choice was easy to be done even if my eyes was closed only shouted Jesus but Jesus is the word that you are hearing now you listen to me Jesus is the same is the same yesterday today and forever don't see the physical body Jesus is the word the one is telling you you have to take your decision to be baptized in water that Jesus and when you reject it you're doing the same as those people back there are you there with me we love you so much and we want to be with you in heaven but this is the way this is the way and the key has been given to Peter and when Peter has to open what he said repent get baptized in water for the remission of your sin and then God he will give you the Holy Spirit just speak I don't care one day you're going to hear this for the last time remember we are going one by one maybe tomorrow might be I don't wish that it might be your to go and then they're going to show you all the videos of the men of God telling you about to be baptized then you start crying and it's going to be too late amen church amen church amen Church somebody have to take his decision amen amen am amen amen nations are breaking Israel working and remember the Rapture that we are talking see what's happening in the Middle East even the gulf countries they have gathered together you see Saudi Arabia you see you see Iraq they gather together they said we are neutral we don't want to be interfere interfering in the war between isra and Iran but you USA and all other powerful count those who have uh the bases in our land military

the bride we're not going to be here on the Earth but what's going to take you out of the Earth today we are going so slow because what we realize is we are neglecting the small things but which are powerful on which the big things has to lay brother I'm already baptized yes you have done good but where are you at in your Christian experience you have to be born again are you there with me Church look we are human beings we make mistakes but if you are Christian you're going to know that you are a Christian can woman give birth and she's ignorant about the baby so how can you say I'm born again but if they put you in the corner you start thinking I'm not sure maybe no you have to make sure that that experience is real and genuine because that the only thing which going to bring you to the adoption my young sisters and brother don't rely on your parent experience if also those parent they have one I wish they have one because you child you can rely on them but ifs they didn't have one if so you see it's about the individual what I said in the beginning is let us see ourself through the mirror of the word with your checklist your checklist list you know I am nowhere with God and if you are nowhere there is an opportunity today because we are at the closing of the world history brother you came boring today you know you came so [Music] boring we like when it's fire you know where that fire is going to take us if there is nothing within us where that fire going to take us to and beside that fire maybe come from the preacher but when the preacher is not there how you most of us here if they we we they follow us at work most of us here you you sleeping most of us here if they follow us work then they check are we really Christian at work are we Christian at work are we

details missing here here are the details which were missing what told him it feel that ah what I said there was something missing so to be free so that when I go to pray I pray straight to God I have

time is at end nations are breaking Israel Awakening every sign that the Bible for told is coming to pass you promised all these things and you and you said it will happen we know what is true I pray father that you'll be merciful today and will save the Lost Grant it and may they be sealed with the Holy Ghost and not turn the Sai from Grant it in Jesus name say Amen oh my I know I've told the truth as I'm telling you about baptism here I know I told the truth I know my sheep will hear my Jesus said like he said there how do you know is here listen the Holy Ghost is right here now I hear him speak with tongues and interpret I see him do signs and wonders and I see him even the last sign was to be Messianic sign Jesus said what was the last sign that Abraham had just before Sodom B that the angel stood there himself in the flesh thaten to Abraham called him Elohim God stood there stranger and watch what he called Abraham called Abraham his new name he just got it a few days before his [Music] de was for Abram was Abraham called s a princess name Abraham where is your wife sah how did he know he's married how did he know he had a wife how did he know this name is his name was son said she is in the tent behind you said I'm going to I personal pron I'm going to visit you according to the time of life you know I'm going to do this I promise you you've waited for it 25 years and Sarah in her heart laughed and said will I ever have joy with my Lord seeing I'm old and past years of buring is old the to and the angel said why did Sarah laugh saying in her heart it just can't happen Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man what happen in the days of Sodom we see God in the human flesh what happened God himself he created a body out of the S why because the Earth was not redeemed as yet God has to create a body and he has entered in amen and the god this is how you understand the Bible what happened the time of Lord because some people read what happened the time of Lord and you stop by there no they were gay in L's time were lesbian in Lord's time yes but that is not the mejor thing there the major thing was God in human flesh amen God has created a body as he hased him and he went to visit Abraham there were three when they reached there Abraham Sarah sah gave him some bad time Sarah gave Abraham bad time because she was seeing how the wife of lot was wearing all the the super waxes and her living in the dry land he gave Abraham hard time and Abraham was sitting in the shadow of the day and see three people but look at Abraham three people came to him instead of calling them my Lord Abraham call my Lord why as a prophet Abraham as a prophet eloh in the human flesh Abraham the revelation that this is God in the human flesh and this came before The Promised son amen am that the me thing when you know what happened the time of Lord amen and what this man has done remember the F the f was not redeemed as yet that's why God had to create a body and enter in and when God was there he pretended that you was passing then Abraham said oh my Lord here sah sah go prepare something you wives you wives be careful be careful be careful be careful by receiving people in your house by re people in your house some have received Angels don't close your doors to people don't be selfish and greedy look at here and let me tell you straight there are some sisters when visitor comes the husband said give them this give them this do this do this why are you telling me in front of visitors you you want to make them known like I'm selfish hey Abraham is the he has the Revelation he say s prepare some food never said what are you going to show so what are you going to to show to them that you are the one who sending me like me I don't share with people no sometimes you have to follow the leading of the spirit are you there for me you see the way God does things I don't know why I get in there amen and when Sarah has done that Elohim the god of Heaven he at he drank milk he he took the tooth stick he took the tooth stick after eating he was a fool he was happy and one a man of God is happy you have wait for blessing when you receive a child of God not only a minister any child of God you feed him is Happy blessing will have to follow Abraham take the truth Gabriel sah she knows how to cook Abraham where is Sarah th wife she she is be the tent you see this is another good example not your husband receive visitors they talking you come out of your chair what are you talking about you open your eyes big S was in the tent amen unless the husband call you come here no we are in the USA we don't we cannot do that no no you have your place we are Christians amen you still have to be a feminine exact F don't follow my English sometimes so your English from South Africa is is Sister Shar sister Shar Hey Brother your English from South Africa water I said no I'm going to correct this because of sister Shar so when I see no more water you see sah was beyond the T when Abraham ask not a kind of woman you want to be involved in everything what are you talking about what are you talking about no no no no no sometimes be aside follow amen it's not bad too if sometimes you sit but most of the time there are maybe some other topics that men are talking don't put words all the time trying to to show your presence Sarah was behind the tent amen amen sister do you still love me amen then when he asked s behind the tent Abraham this time I will come back when I'll be back SAR your wife will bear a son s be the tent brother you know no I'm talking to you you brother sometimes I want to say something in lingala to feel it but you killing me she said Pap not when you eat you talk too much just just you can just eat eat what most especially in con you see Mama how Fu can make people talk he at already in hising we are breaking it down for you to see the picture me really old woman like me am I going to have pleasure with my husband and he's old too to have a child look at what I wanted to learn where I wanted to here after after talking sah the Bible we read said in her heart hallu fuu can make somebody talk I this man was hungry really look now become hey look sister sometimes keep your tongue shut who was there that was Elohim s was lucky because of ab because the promise the son had to come had to come through S but you you don't have that promise careful you don't know who's there don't know keep our tongue shut Abraham why s laughed El kill SAR at this SP sir kill because s called him a liar but because of the promise sah was protected is there anything difficult to God you see how did the man knew what Sarah said in her heart the discernment of the heart the discernment of the inner things and who can see that beside God Only God himself that's what happened in Abraham's time that's what happened in the Lord's time and the Bible say the very same thing going to happen again before the coming of the son of man and for it to be the same for it to be the same God had to come in the human flesh and let me tell you this day this scripture was already fulfilled God came down but this time God didn't create a body why because with the shed of blood of Jesus the world the world was already Sanctified God didn't have to create a body he just took one amen am he just took one and he said don't smoke don't drink don't defy your body when you going to behold you have a work what happened there has to happen here and it happened amen this man this man this man enveed God amen amen amen I see you you are sister Nomi for examp you are from Colorado you are mowing your your your loan your loan mowing cutting grass cutting grass and you fell down you break your back you stay from for example Chamber Street SE number SE number go you are healed who can see all those things who can see all those things he can give you your name he can tells you what happened while nobody saw you has to be God that's what happen in lot time are you there brothers and sisters and when you see these things open your eyes the sun is's about there are you there church yes are you there with me Church did we see all these things that the Bible is talking about so what left what left brother what left sister so why can't you take your own decision amen we're going to heaven soon and very soon this world is going to be destroyed get ready when you see these things it changes your life why it has changed Abraham's body that has to change our lives from a prostitute to the daughter of God from to the son of God come as you are the message of the hour God in the human flesh amen designing the thought as he has done with s if that has changed their life the same thing has to change your life what is difficult come and as you are amen all of us if it was not about the message especially myself when I see all my friends where we grow up in B when I see all my friends when I check all their lives today they are a way and I am the only one who received this message what Grace tell what Grace what Grace what Grace such Grace such Grace so when you sitting there when your brother is bringing you to church when your parent bringing you to church when somebody's inviting you to church don't come just to sit there and go back let me tell you we are going to heaven it's not about those churches that you see foret about them Pentecostal Church forget about them it's only about Noah it's only about Noah the word God gave the instruction was Noah and Noah today is brother and the ACT today the ACT today is this message it's preparing us not to get in the physical AR but to be caught [Applause] up so you are coming to sit for your own judgment if you don't believe what's going to take you what is difficult for you to believe this message if you sit by yourself can't you see that despite these people they are human beings they might have mistakes like other people there is something different so why can't you take your own decision are you there with me church are you me Church the very same sign we've seen it today amen amen amen amen amen amen and this man here has seen the angel of the Lord this pel of fire on top the P of fire that you see on the head for you people of why do you put the the picture of a man it's a man you can't put the picture of a man in the church what about that one what about him is not a man no that's Jesus who told you that Jesus who told you that was Jesus was camera in Jesus time who told you that was Jesus look the light that you see on the head very real than the picture that you [Applause] see did did I Stumble somebody this light you see on the head it's so real that image there that image is a paint that somebody has paint by the inspiration the person has paint and when saw it he said it really looks like it why because saw Jesus you you playing with him now he saw the Jesus that you you worshiping he saw him he saw him that's why he said this off man p looks like you can put that in your house so when you were putting it in your house who told you to do that but the light even the FBI they check it they check it they check it they check it they came to the statement never never from the human history a supernatural being was captured in the camera the very same God who led the children of Israel is the very same God who is with us now that's why we are telling you only in the message so when you come sit there don't come to accompany people it's time to take your own decision we want to be with you in heaven and the god want to be with you in heaven that's why he allowed somebody to bring you here so when you hear attention when you hear take your own decision it's going to be too late soon brother Richard what shall I do that the same thing they ask Peter let us make the Bible real what they heard there what them they heard there what you are hearing now very same Jesus is the pill of fire amen is the very same Jesus who met who met Paul in the way of Damascus who are you I am the Lord and the very same light the Lord is with us today is the very same one who brought this message amen now do the same thing after hearing this Brother Richard what shall I do brother what shall I do you heard it and look at brother answer you as a Peter repent forget about your Pentecostal about your your your Protestant about your prayer group forget about those things only Peter has the key Peter had the key repent in for the remission of and God will give you the Holy Spirit when you receive it you are also part of those who going to go in Rapture are you there with me church are you there with me church are you there with me church now if you don't take your decision now if you die in that condition you only waiting for judgment are you there me Church [Music] simple is uh when you came when you touch it better for you to be away it could be better for you to be but when you come you sit there you hear it two things salvation or judgment you already heard better for somebody who didn't hear anything my brothers and sisters take your own decision if you already baptized in water and you never leave a Christian experience there is a Christian experience it really exists God is willing to give you the Holy Spirit and that the ticket for rapture today no faith at all no faith is still there amen am but faith without works nothing I've got faith brother I've got faith but you got faith your faith you have to put it in action when you hear the word don't Heen your heart let me be straight beside the message beside the message that brought brother no Rapture no Rapture Please interpret correctly in English please when Jesus will come we will take Believers today is going to hit like the trumpet trp chur chur now the trumpet is sounding you don't know about it it's not going to be the way them they think them they think the heavens going to be open trumpet will sound I am a Jesus I am here so who's going to get lost even the drun in the when Hees that is going to cast out his beer you see it's a secret SEC it a secret going away and the preparation only Noah knew the secret and Noah today is this man the message you you these people here just you are you are you are a baby just make your noise and let go home your St is too low you doing as s has done but remember it could be better for you to don't sit there and hear what I'm saying because as you heard to things salvation if you take your own decision or death but my sister my brother why do you have to choose death are we you are living with us here are we certain you know the life of your daughter you knew her before she believes the message you knew the life of your son before he believes the message is that life the same today no you are really sure that something has changed but what makes that thing change is this message it's going to change you too if you only open your heart you said Lord here I am I am opening my heart today I'm deciding to take my decision I'm going to be counted myself among Christians here is the water I am doing what uniop has done no no what Philip has done to theop after explaining all this said here is water amen my brothers and sisters let me be honest I never planned this all this I never it for you sometimes we are misunderstood we preachers we are misunderstood I realize that sometimes you preach then you you go back you see people attitude somebody can think then you only prepare stuff to to against him sometimes yes maybe some does that but sometimes it's not always the case that's why sometimes let Lord help us to not take it personal but to take it as the warning from the Lord you understand me church I said today we are getting low why we want to take everyone brother you can't take everyone there is three kind of Believers you know that do you know who believer who do you know that nobody knows we all do our best to help everyone but the Lord himself know who's going to be saved and who not while you hear his voice don't hearken your heart the fles ing red light of the sign of his coming preaching 63 June 23 in the evening the flashing red light of the son of his coming paragraph 172 let R oh brothers and sisters you know sometimes God hide some stuff even from his servant it took me all night while you were sleeping on your bed somebody maybe took two hours to sleep on the carpet praying how am I going to approach this but I really understand God is not a man he has his own way I don't understand the way things is going I didn't plan it this way please take it it's going to help you don't sleep don't sleep it's going to help you 17 our friend can you ever turn down something like that seeing that there is no hopes in the world outside of Jesus Christ the red light are flashing nations are breaking Israel Awakening the signs that the Bible for told women cutting their hair wearing shorts the red light is on days our days are numbered I'm young let me let me enjoy my life young are not D are young not dying who told you tomorrow belongs to today if you go out of this door without taking into consideration it might be your last warning you see what Pap has done he never plan it when the Lord has burned his heart he humbled himself if you humble yourself the Lord is going to raise you up he didn't even plan it he said once he get in I think he missed the accident and he said wowow as he came that day on Sunday said I'm not going back today I'm taking my decision to be counted among those who fulfill the word and the preacher will not say no we are not ready we are not ready what if he goes out then pass away what you you preacher you going to do you see please I am begging you this is the truth take your decision amen amen be baptized in water that the first step of Salvation our days are numbered be filled with the spirit have your lamp trimmed and clear look up your Redemption is near a por amen amen why you why why you say about Papa narcis papis why because you think if you come and get [Music] baptized humble me that the way the wise way to save yourself then hell the Lord is under the obligation to lift him up I'm talking about Pap to lift him up but you are like this like this I'm old people see me seeing me this is for little children yes the kingdom of God is for those who are like little children because the children doesn't think the child can stay at home for a month they never see a bread but if the dad who is unable to buy the bread comes and tell the child tomorrow I'm going to buy you the airplane the child will believe how the dad who cannot even buy a brain can buy you the airplan but the child will believe and when tomorrow comes though there is no even milk to drink he will ask Dad why where is my airplan faith like a children if you put yourself in that stage you humble yourself the Lord is going to lift you take your decision today this might be your last warning I do believe the Lord is speaking to somebody's heart now 181 look at yourself just imagine a mirror before you you are looking at yourself am I honest am I sincere sincere do I really in my heart do I serve the Lord that question only you can answer amen amen 185 while there is a Mery while there is a Mery and someone standing in the Gap Jesus Christ and open the door this afternoon won't you receive him my friend won't you receive him my friend no no and if 197 and now if you've never been baptized in amazing water amazing water in the name of Jesus CH let me as his servant if God has proven to you by signs and wonders and by his way that I tell you the truth I commend you as a s Paul did in act who found a bunch of Baptist they had been baptized in John the Baptist he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they say we know whether there be any Holy Ghost he say then to what was your baptized what was you baptized they said we've been baptized already by John the Baptist out in the [Applause] Jordan the same men that baptized Jesus 198 that will be a wonderful baptism but Paul said it's not good now he commanded them they will have to be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ where was it written I don't care about youram stuff read the Bible for me act 19 verse 5 we don't have time go read by yourself look don't know let people lie to you they believe they believe who was Moses who was Moses the Bible says people they they believed Moses and they preached Moses in the synagogue but now today why you preaching Bram but Moses his name is is in the Bible but show show us I can ask you show me the name of Jesus in the entire Old Testament until the angel pronounced that name the Bible was saying the child will be born Emmanuel the Son of God but they never they never say Jesus there oh but it it in the New Testament because Jesus was there already do you want us to write another Bible no no if it was possible with everything that Jesus has done in our time the B could be written are you there church don't blame us it our you talk about the man you talk about why why because the children of the LA children of isra when they were mming against Moses they said why only God has to talk to you why God has to talk to he's a prophet Propet 37 that's your Bible they said to Moses we want God to speak to to ourselves we don't want somebody in between we don't want a man Moses you are a man we want God himself to talk to us Moses went to God he said your people they want you to talk to them God said they said the right thing God tell them to sanctify them for three days be aware of their woman wash their clothes and they come then the people were happy we going to see God then when the third day come when they were there God came down he was speaking when God speak it was standers Bo Bo behind the boo it was I am the Lord but only Moses hear I am the Lord for the other people it was and they run away Moses Mo Moses oh but you said you don't want a man no Moses we don't want to go to speak anymore if he speak will die Moses you go let God talk to you and you bring to us as we ask that ask ourself we ask that we did ask that then you ask why why cuz they say you go because we can't bear God's language you go hear from him because the prophet is built the way to understand God's language then you see children of Israel Moses said Moses said that's why today we saying you see don't be stumbl amen church because for most of people they afraid to engage themselves because they said it's a man they worshiping a man we we we not worshiping a man our Lord our savior is the Lord Jesus chist is the one who save Bram is a sinner saved by grace like you like I God has given him a Grace to be his Prophet that's all we don't worshiping him so don't be afraid take your decision we are Christians we are not bramis people give us that name hey even in the Bible today you are I'm a Christian a Christian do you know that there was a people who gave them that name of Christian same thing today people gave us the name of Bram our Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ We Believe Lord Jesus Christ that's why we get baptized in his name never save us himself is saved like us now why are you afraid of take your decision when you start eating you start eating then you start understanding it's like this I was afraid for no reason start the Lord's going to help you is somebody going to take his decision today we love you we want you to be with us no way went in the ark with his family amen amen if I had my mother here I would like to be saved with my mother if I had my daddy here I would like my daddy to be saved like I if I have my cousin here my nephew here my wife here my husband here i' would like to be safe like him that's why God has given you the opportunity to come sit it not by chance it's not by chance your mistake you don't want to see it that way amen amen if you don't take if you don't take your decision you will hear my voice talking you will hear my voice said as preacher we are
