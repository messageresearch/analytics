TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] so many times i've questioned certain [Music] many times weakness blurs my vision and my frustrations get so out of hand but it's then i am reminded i've never been forsaken and i've never had to stand alone that's when i look at all the victories then the spirit rises through the up my weakness is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh he never offered our victories just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and when the adversary says giving [Music] just you through the fire again [Music] i know within myself perish but if i trust the mighty hand of god he'll shield the flames again again [Music] he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the year would [Music] without fighting but he said hell would always just remember when you're standing [Music] says just hold [Music] again [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] again
