[0:00] Pastor today we want to honor
[0:03] you because we
[0:08] know Moses could not do the work by
[0:12] himself he had the people of Israel
[0:14] behind
[0:17] him and every time they had a
[0:22] war and the people were
[0:27] defeated it was because the hand of
[0:29] Moses was
[0:33] down but God has allowed two
[0:37] people to have the
[0:41] vision that if the hand of Moses is
[0:46] down isra will be
[0:49] defeated and Aaron and
[0:53] Ur they were supporting
[0:57] Moses during good or bad time
[1:01] and we pray the end time message
[1:05] Tabernacle ESS that the Lord has given
[1:09] you will be supporting
[1:13] you during good and bad
[1:17] times because we know by supporting you
[1:22] that's how we're going to be we're going
[1:24] to be
[1:26] blessed and that's
[1:28] United that's how we're going to be
