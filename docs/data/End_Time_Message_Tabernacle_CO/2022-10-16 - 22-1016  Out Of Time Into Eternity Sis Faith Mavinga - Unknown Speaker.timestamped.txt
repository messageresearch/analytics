[0:01] God bless you
[0:09] [Music]
[0:32] storms alive
[0:39] [Music]
[0:54] [Applause]
[0:57] [Music]
[1:15] but the words of Our Lord
[1:21] reveals a place of Refuge
[1:26] where the righteous can run and be safe
[1:36] when we're all under the blood
[1:41] the dead Angel can't slay us we'll be
[1:47] saved till we're taken away
[1:52] [Music]
[1:54] okay
[1:56] in a moment we'll be gone we'll be taken
[2:03] from this world out of time into
[2:11] eternity
[2:16] Darkness
[2:18] [Music]
[2:41] hearts are filled with
[2:45] fear
[2:47] as terror strikes around them
[2:55] despite all the destruction
[2:59] yet they still cling to worldly
[3:05] cares they keep living
[3:09] in
[3:10] despair
[3:13] but the children of God
[3:18] [Music]
[3:20] abiding peace and safety far away from
[3:26] that
[3:28] uncommon storms
[3:31] [Music]
[3:38] we are completely sheltered as we wait
[3:44] for our lives
[3:51] [Music]
[4:10] out of Darkness into light out of dance
[4:18] [Music]
[4:30] see there comes time when the spirit of
[4:35] God
[4:36] will
[4:37] depart
[4:40] then None Shall be healed and none shall
[4:44] be saved
[4:45] [Music]
[4:49] this world is again
[4:52] falling apart as our Prophet said
[4:58] so you enter it now before it's too late
[5:06] in a moment we'll be gone we'll be taken
[5:13] from this world out of time into
[5:20] eternity
[5:24] out of Darkness
[5:26] [Music]
[5:43] spread your wings prepare for flight
[5:48] faster than the speed of light out of
[5:53] time into
[5:57] eternity
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] there'll be no more Darkness
[6:04] [Music]
[6:06] No More Death only life out of time into
[6:16] eternity
[6:20] this world is not for me my Jesus face I
[6:27] long to see out of time into
[6:34] eternity
[6:38] out of time into
[6:44] eternity
[6:45] God bless you
[6:51] hey man God bless your sister Faith
