[0:01] May God bless you.
[0:03] [Music]
[0:18] [Laughter]
[0:22] I pray into the atmosphere.
[0:27] Spirit of God, you're here. You have
[0:32] all authority.
[0:38] I pray over my heart and mind.
[0:43] I am healed by your stripes. Your blood
[0:48] declares that I am free
[0:52] in the body and name of Jesus.
[0:57] I pray
[1:00] on the power of heaven.
[1:04] I proclaim
[1:07] everyone for
[1:10] me
[1:12] must pray
[1:14] in the mighty name of Jesus.

[1:22] In the mighty name of Jesus
[1:26] [Music]
[1:27] I pray
[1:30] calling on the power of heaven.

[1:37] every weapon
[1:39] against me.
[1:43] I pray
[1:45] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[1:49] [Music]
[1:54] I draw a permanent boundary line.
[1:59] The enemy has no right to come
[2:04] near my family.
[2:07] [Music]
[2:09] No scheme could ever undo God's will.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; No matter the circumstance of the cross,
[2:19] I seal my destiny.
[2:23] In the mighty name of Jesus,
[2:28] I pray.
[2:30] Calling on the power of heaven.
[2:35] I proclaim
[2:38] everywhere that fall against me
[2:43] must
[2:45] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:53] In the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:57] Oh, I know
[3:00] all the power of fear and darkness.
[3:05] My
[3:07] go every key to every victory.
[3:11] [Music]
[3:12] I hope
[3:15] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[3:24] I will not fear. I will not fear when
[3:28] the enemy becomes near
[3:31] the door of my life is the God of Jesus
[3:37] Christ. I will not fear. I will not
[3:41] fear. When the enemy becomes
[3:46] under of my life is the blood of Jesus
[3:51] Christ
[3:53] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[3:58] I pray
[4:00] [Music]
[4:01] the power of heaven.
[4:05] I proclaim
[4:07] that everyone can fall against me.
[4:13] I pray
[4:15] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[4:21] Yes. In the mighty name of Jesus.
[4:26] [Music]
[4:28] My go
[4:30] on the power of fear and darkness
[4:34] in my soul.
[4:37] Who's every key to every victory
[4:42] I
[4:44] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[4:52] is every key to every victory
[4:57] I hold
[4:59] in the mighty name of Jesus.
[5:06] [Music]
[5:07] Amen.
