city or the capital of that part of Macedonia velocity la capitale de cette parcel Adela Macedonia and a woman colony is a day in colony Roman if you can excuse me for a minute if we can turn to the book of at a loss of the lemon squeeze and to keep another one from early leave the desert keeping your philippians still and I don't deserve what her give her the Philippi equity as I said you read the writing to one of the group Philippian hope the solonian novel is a learned a secret you I let work get a dressier and a group the Philippian would dissolution and you will see what really took place in action all over the living room of God is a person action act to chapter 16 at the Chabot racism let's take verse 12 when only there said news showing our Paul travel from Thomas Capel of where he let me start with verse eleven instead they say more common sailor sailor the city owns widow at the 16th verse eleven at the cesspools o therefore losing from tours we came with a straight

Roman colony a la Habana Mykonos eighteen colonial men and we were in that city abiding certain days Allah is Asian he knew Poisson can corrode onset vino so here the Bible the book of act is saying Paul actually went to the city of a philip i all all ability curvy Polly partied and said ville de Filippo and they stayed they abide certain time he saw her step on uncle kazoo what happened during this day a casket arrived upon us at all so you will notice during that time Valera barking upon Osito Paul stay in the Philip I a polyester Filippo and then that was a time that Paul brought his very first convert a loss to Philip I say there's a moment like a pole operation premiere convert ela Filippo and their first convert of paul le premier converted apollo was Lydia city Lydia and when Paul brought the message kampala patella massage Lydia accepted the message Lydia poor occipital a massage and was the baptized with her entire family hated by T's affected suffer me so Lydia was one of the key converted in a Philip I Allah Lydia a taken convert seek Leila Filippo so the name of Philip I alone derma Filippo game was named after the King of Macedonia it a annuity no Marilyn no no harm della macedonian king philip ii the Kiowas philip do and he was the father of Alexander the Great he lit a a lowly paired Alexandra Li Gong so that the King to Philip a notion was Filippo went to

Kasai you know if he lives and the paleography limpo now in the lexicon Greg when I don't the lexicon record that we have in the terrible message canoes award on the massage table it says Philip I means lover of horses filippova dear and a medieval was a city in Macedonia the day in a villa Macedonia about nine miles from the seat Makita passcode is Ricky Roma tour de la Mer to the northwest of island houses a logical Oh No Wester the trousers they Philip I which Paul visited in Philippa Coppola visit a was a Roman colony founded by August's today in colony herrmann ET k APPA August's so the Church of Philip I alone English the Filipino was where Paul founded he is the first congregation in Eastern Europe allow paula.ka somtum you convert II who I used on from a confetti and hope or founded his the first congregation who a KS up a mere eglise yeah so this is just to give you a quick overview of what we are going to talk about the Philippians my losses register pou human have open and paleta blue ii owes an apology Oh Philip among the different places of Paul visited family difference on worker policy a Philip I Philippa was one of the city that were all added the greatest challenge the tail and a veil of polygons defeat the biggest resistance lagoon resistance and that was the place where Christianity directly brought in conflict with a pagan ISM was the Philip I a loss allow allocation dat Vermont miss on first Japan velocity velocity a Philippe so that this is very important because as we have this in our background in a local peasant Porter communist IV&V not passing this is important to understand now how and why Paul wrote this to the Philip I who are in kukuczka Paul a sec awfully bro so Philip I was a place of biggest challenge for the Apostle Paul enough ellipse had done on what if harmonic grande they bowed at the honk intestine and if you can recall when we spoke we read the book of Thessalonians and awesome Buddha souvenir columns I believe and it is our witness here this is Bible studies we want to take our time to search through the scriptures I love the section it would be bleak another lump on another Tampopo where he got a little yes but the Bible study is a very important we've lived it will be bleak shiver matras important many denominations beaucoup de denomination they don't have the books from the Prophet in one nor the Prophet in on Polly liver the Prophet Enoch honest event they study really the Bible in a certain way is it reliever malady pledge insulting money so therefore you cannot challenge them with the Bible a lot of room to vapor formally Divya vac libel but I believe we can because we have the Bible plus a cannula proven Pascal news I won't lose a lab develop political control so in our first test alone Ian's allowed on intensive initia we read the chapter two novel Alicia Peter verse 1 and 2 verse a and Paul was saying Polly DJ for yourself brother oh no our entrance into you that it was not in vain not on humility Runa by Deven but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as you know at Phillip I oppressive work OPA so fairy of wa ato Putrajaya Filippo so you see here dissing onions I love worship Allah keep aren t seven easier he's telling them or we enter to you Nakano some veneer vu but we were shamefully entreated as you know at Philip our main news evolve Rama idiot Regina Filippo we were we we suffered at Filipinos evolve Rama Saphira Filippo so Philip I was a place where Paul received the biggest challenge and say a syllable a loophole as commercial on TV what happened in Philippi and cascade are either Philippe when Paul went to preach the gospel and Polly party Priscilla Vaughn she faced resistance in labor in FFA salary system of the Jews the river and many religious and traditions who could a religion a tradition and even witchcraft mmm Adela so celery sources dissociate all these people came and the challenge appalled at Philip I a lot to say Johnson when UFA on feed Afiya policy leap that's what Paul is referring say brother you know how painful we've suffered not Philip pylori deserves every comments canoes are used to failure Filippo so I want you to I want to tell you what was the suffering of Paul at Philippi a large everybody say - koalas response the Paula Filippo let us take the Bible in the book of Acts chapter 16 elope Enola me be delivered exact shape it racism act chapter 16 at the shop it was a zoo at the top sixteen anticipate versus going to a long favor verse 12 verse a do ya verse 12 was saying about solidify being a colony by land if he lived it in colony but if you care to verse 14 as he was another thing Kotoko the Bible I will let you I can I'll let you go read the Bible book of Acts chapter 16 you should probably see a linearly live what the artist repeater says but I'm gonna tell you the story continues 12 so at the chapter 16 from verse 12 that was when Paul went to Philip I at the shop it was says foo ketosis allow Polly party a fillable so when Paul entered Philip I accompanied entre Filippo as I said there was a lot of resistance of the lady as a beaucoup de déu de resistance he started preaching in la cama supply chain and there was only one lady mania Vega insolent farmer called Lydia apple led who pay attention to the sermon of pork yet irritancy olefinic ass on the pole and he became the she became the first converted a ladies vanilla premier convert II and if we find one of the verse media was the baptize with her entire family I think verse 14 and 6:15 hello say don't if
