[59:25] a little bit
[59:34] [Music]

[1:00:21] i think what will be in this direction
[1:00:24] what will be more
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:32] so talking about baptism what a baptism
[1:00:38] it's a god requirement selection
[1:00:43] we all have to go through
[1:00:47] allah because this is the first
[1:00:50] principle
[1:00:50] vasquez we came to this world
[1:00:54] knew
[1:01:03] that we suppose not to do suppose yeah
[1:01:07] in his love has opened up a way for
[1:01:11] us and this is a god
[1:01:14] provided way this is about you and we
[1:01:17] have to do it
[1:01:18] in the correct way in the volume correct
[1:01:21] before it's too late
[1:01:24] uh god giving the opportunity
[1:01:27] opportunity
[1:01:32] don't say that what about the one who
[1:01:34] died at the course
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:50] you have to consider this would they be
[1:01:52] considered and uh
[1:01:55] even those who have been already
[1:01:58] baptized a meme say
[1:01:59] undersea and we know sometimes some
[1:02:02] baptisms have been done
[1:02:04] wrong
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:16] oh you have been struggling
[1:02:21] ah it doesn't hurt uh
[1:02:24] to make sure that you have done it the
[1:02:28] correct way
[1:02:30] the way god wants
[1:02:40] people have baptized in many ways
[1:02:44] i know in a long time people have been
[1:02:47] arguing
[1:02:51] who should baptize the minister
[1:02:54] the minister should baptize himself
[1:02:58] you get in the water down low you're
[1:03:00] dipping in
[1:03:14] need to be pronounced in the correct
[1:03:18] name
[1:03:21] the name of the lord jesus christ they
[1:03:23] know the senior of jesus christ and if
[1:03:25] you are not
[1:03:26] sure steven is passionate make sure when
[1:03:29] they still there is
[1:03:30] still an opportunity called opportunity
[1:03:33] amen so this is
[1:03:36] the way to heaven
[1:03:40] don't despise it
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:48] take hold of you ever say this oh he has
[1:03:51] been a long
[1:03:52] time oh sorry he has been in the message
[1:03:55] for a long time
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:05] where you stand with your own baptism
[1:04:07] experience
[1:04:08] would they never experienced about them
[1:04:10] and every time the water is
[1:04:13] filled hey grandpa it should
[1:04:16] give
[1:04:17] us an opportunity so i don't need the
[1:04:19] opportunity to think about
[1:04:21] the ponzi schedule and after this
[1:04:24] yeah you see there is a promise your
[1:04:27] information
[1:04:28] to be filled with the baptism of the
[1:04:29] holy ghost directly
[1:04:32] and sometimes we may wonder why i don't
[1:04:36] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:37] because your neighbor but them just
[1:04:39] was your confession correct ask about
[1:04:41] the confession to correct because we
[1:04:43] don't just take the people and put them
[1:04:45] in their words
[1:04:46] only trumpet down low i spoke with uh
[1:04:49] sister sarah
[1:04:51] to explain to her what is baptism uh you
[1:04:54] speak
[1:04:55] about them and to encourage her
[1:04:59] to make confessions
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:02] wherever she thinks you have done
[1:05:04] something that was not appropriate
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:30] in jesus christ and whatever we do
[1:05:33] later just kidding
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:46] if you can go and catch the water i went
[1:05:48] in
[1:05:52] all the water too low and bring it to me
[1:05:55] then i will believe you i love you that
[1:05:58] my sins are still here give me
[1:06:00] but if you cannot
[1:06:09] you ask me why i am happy
[1:06:13] to give her that song
