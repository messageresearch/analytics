[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] my mom [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is foreign [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen is the water warm enough it's good enough so we are going to read the scripture for the baptism uh i'm going to take ephesians chapter four pancreatic faith from verse 4 about university card um baptism is one of the key things to go to heaven um should not be done by your influence it's a lonely paper etc influence but by conviction and if for some reason you have been baptized the simple certain reason and then you look at your work and you feel like no something did not work the way it should ever been you can be re-baptized and uh sister julian willa sergilian she received the message i believe in 1977. elaborate message on his nephew said when she was baptized for the first time kindly but is a polar premiere for and i did not believe at that time after a while they apparently she decided to be re-baptized to start a closed walk with god in 2022. this is to say brother sister if you question somewhere your baptism [Music] don't look at anyone regard a person a person just make sure that you and god may revoke you to be very very convinced with a treatment on vancouver because the going away of the bride is very close you know i told you last sunday of the day that the age of leo this year if you look at all the seven church ages come from garden today so far efficient is the shortest the two seller large defenses starting from year 53 ending at 170 in sacramento singapore is giving 117 years it's a failure to tell the sun the satan and that's the shortest that's it so far and branham told us here will be shorter than all of them if i can just show the numbers on the board ephesians start at 53. and at 170. afternoon giving a total of 117 years to tell the sunday saturn when leo this year started brother rene can't escape if you don't know no baptism you failed them along the catechism uh when leo this year started ah and 2002 20 2022 will be how many sanji said sun says 116 116. if ephesus is so far the shortest with 117 52 53 to 170 which 2022 um david the midfielder we'll have 116 vapor totalization as we said where are we at this is the time to make everything you have to write celebrand shows if for some reason you have been a negligent somewhere simple certain results you have to think twice would ever pass you therefore you have not been baptized navigate but easy we have a water you have the law there will be no excuse in your apartheid excuse if your baptism was not really really sure see what happened the performance issue we you can make it right now ephesian ephesians chapter 4 verse 4. the bible said there is one body yeah instead called and one spirit yes even as ye are called in one hope of your calling [Music] there is only one baptism fairness about them which is correct here correct you can have hundred thousand of baptisms the butter i see i don't want to be critical if you buy it at all critic i've seen people even baptizing others but baptism is a symbol mainly by themselves of dying they love more buried philosophically small and resurrection in the resurrection have you seen somebody dying like this come see i don't know so what i'm saying is jda there are so many forms of baptism yeah they formed about them the catholic they have their baptism the catholic protestant they have the baptisms but if those baptisms are correct you may see see but some correct then ours is wrong and loudly not if a foe if ours is right not foreign make sure that your baptism is correct as you revoke your vote correct and to take the baptism at them it means you have to make your confession as paul as peter said in act chapter 2. don't go to the gate nearly and then they tell you no your baptism [Music] just be sure that whatever cost let me get in the water and we cannot was telling me pastor we were coming quickly i forgot my clothes no we were coming to church last there is no way go get something somewhere and then uh just to put it on so baptism about is something very critical the second question is that critique jesus said go preach the word allah those who will believe just the key is on the faith but la clay says four because that's the bible one lord a celtic one faith in that lord himself fourth ancestor and one baptism he answered them that's the key therefore you cannot baptize people in three lords one lord ancestor remember one faith in cell four and faith cometh by the hearing of the word which word did you hear to know that there is one word and one baptism one i want you to go slowly what which kind of word did you hear to have faith in brother sister sir if you receive this this this this it's not sure if it was a very successful let's pass you just dump it seller and get to the water because the baptism asking you about them is belief say la croix let me read you this quote here in the message expectations uh expectative program 14 the fact that you don't believe you are living in sin the left even now here it is get it um you see uh he that believeth not is condemned already because you're still passing like smoke drink commit adultery because have a female that's the attribute of sin success attribute you perceive you do that because you don't believe the rest the rest is attributes it's always attributed it's like jesus said you will recognize them by their food so sometimes we try to look at oh you know they smoke they do this they do this yes those are just attributes that's a song you will not do this amen amen so brother and sister do you believe that sister julian do you believe i said what are you gonna do believe see we are going to baptize them amen amen [Music] who's going to go first you okay [Music] [Music] i think you made your confession as we spoke did you speak to everybody you needed even the last minute person you told me yesterday okay now you can get in the water confession person come [Music] here is this young man young boy his sinus avon brother irene he has heard the word of god and this day is a journey he has make up his mind he loves dcd and he wants to serve you he converted and we are coming in front of this congregation and

of harakabad and speak unto them bring them in the house of the lord into the chambers and give them wine to drink then i took jasanya the son of jeremiah the son of ab bazimna and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of jerichobi and i brought them into the house of the lord into the chambers of the sons of anand the son of igad idablya a man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of messiah the son of jesus the kip of the daw and i said before the sons of the sons of the house of the recovered pots full of wine and cups and i say unto them drinky wine but they say we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rakab our father commanded us saying you shall know wine you shall not drink wine neither ye nor your son forever neither shall he build houses no soul seed no plant vineyard no heavy have any but all your days you shall draw on tents he may live many days in the land where he be strangers does have thus have we obeyed the voice of jonah that the son of rakab our father in all that he has charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons not our daughters now to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard no field no seed but we have to dwell in tents and have obey and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us but it came to pass when nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon came up into the land and we said come and let us go to jerusalem for the fear of the army of kalden and the fear of the harmony of sinning so we will draw in jerusalem then came the word of the law unto jeremiah saying that says the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitant of jerusalem will they now receive instruction to earthen the my to my words says the lord

the son of jonadab the son of recap have performed the commandment of the fathers which he commanded them but these people has not hurricaned my hearken unto me therefore that says the lord of god the lord god of hosts the god of israel behold i'll bring upon judah and upon the inhabitant of jerusalem all the evil that has pronounced against them because i spoken unto them but they have not heard have called answer them but they have not answered and jeremiah said unto the house of the recobyte that said the lord of hosts the god of israel because you have obeyed the commandment of jonah dubbed your father and kept all his precept and done accordingly unto all that he has commanded you therefore that said the law of host the god of israel jonathan the son of recap shall not want a man
