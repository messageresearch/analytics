of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground machias matthew chapter 22 versus you while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them saying what think ye of christ whose whose whose son is he they said unto him the son of david he said unto them how then doth davids in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand till i make thy enemies thy full stool if david then called him lord how is he his law his son and no man was able to answer him a word neither does any man from that day fourth ask him any more questions tonight's message i'm going to title it who is jesus we are listening here let's pray the lord beloved god created this is the latter creator of heaven on earth the man alone cannot do anything but if he's uh led by the spirit of god colon defeat the great pillar of fire there's assurance for this man almighty god [Music] if you do not come to open the understanding of your children we shall go out to empty vessels but we do not want that to me but far away from this housing the angel of the lord that worked with uh brothers may walk with also with us because i'm saying jew remember god himself if you put this under may you come there and control the sentence may you take control of all your spirit jesus christ in the name of jesus christ thank you for thy word thank you for this church thank you for all the children that came tonight and bless them above all thank you zombies give them all that they have neither do we are your children our lord and savior amen amen may the lord bless you once again thank you pastor for the opportunity by the grace of god news alone you know yesterday i was talking to a mother el medici capital talking to me on a capital thing after getting back home my mama i thought on what the mother told outside with brethren brother martin said something sorry you know many times afterwards you know when you get home you have to look into yourself and to try to meditate upon whatever day and try to comment on it if you notice today this is what is missing us yeah there was a time when the pastor were preaching we were going back home before you to go people would sit around the table they were talking around the world and tried to uh straighten up things that didn't work out but today those things are missing out and i was saying that to the pastor spoke about it i didn't think that the god would bring to speak of things in that way and he said something that really helped me along the way i'll ask you one thing during this time of preaching on consecrations you'll try to bring your pencils with your papers take notes i'm fine we have a little children it was observancy they observe you know how can you come to school without the pen without the book this is the school that will go all the way until we leave the earth you know many times when the person asks us questions even myself when i get home i but every time this is being repeated that becomes like a repetition the scientists say that that repetition is perfect but you come to church during this time without any paper pens and you're unable to take notes how are you going to meditate with your children at home that's why people have hard times seeing the second coming summer for my day that really helped me a lot and got angry to see the second coming in the night now he listened to what brother martin said he said brother martin oh nice brother with us we have had the grace we have to come where we have come on paper condensation we cannot condemn them because we're the stars but girls we've come upstairs and i see that's what it's missing that's the really the hardest thing and i'm saying you have margin i really love random stories a lot in it requires that you're the parents yeah do you have a chance to have children shows are fair if they're really there's really a good thing to do is to tell your brothers your children's stories especially the bible stories you know what i'm saying before receiving his grace he says that every time that thomas was this is the only person that's always next to me question what can i do you'll buy this senior you said lord god see together my feet if you uh my daughter i'll take my dog and i'm going to offer them my team but you may commence ourselves too and one morning baltimore's went out he got somewhere and they said the high priest he said where you going [Laughter] daughter because of the healing of his wife he said lo se la selle person que maida la vie this is the only person that helped me whole life she's sick sitting if you don't heal her you put me down who can help me again because the daughter could uh suffer because the daughter could not wash him [Applause] remember there are times that god gives you some problems just to get you to help you to be always on your knees yeah like yeah there are always other people on there they can get easily something but there in the leg except maladies stayed a long time a long time with that disease and god left his servant like they remember the same god there is and what i'm going to ask you tonight is also to love him who is jesus program 55. there was sometimes and i was going with a very known doctor in anthology in theology the famous doctor of divinity many of you might know him william buff klimbo uh william both for clipboard elephant evangel asset lung and he preaches the gospel in seven languages and we were talking about god and his attributes and i was speaking about he said and i spoke about it i said it's like a diamond that is vivo si jedi i said hello then say don't don't then these gifts that you speak of i said they reflect they are just uh just reflection of god's love for example an african and i said like in africa the president of the mine in kimberley there was one offer my ashes in the line that i mean you've taken me through the diamond mines the kimberly in kimberley you are well you can find them laying on the streets but you dare instead to keep one unless it's kind of associated it has to be cut by by the pool and sea donk so then and ghost german a great a great big guy when you find it illinois clown he doesn't have a fire yeah i set the faith it's got to be cut for that he is you that will reflect seven colors and looking red through red looks right did you know that that's right legendary [Music] is as it is the great word of god reflects what god is hey and this mr clayborn said that's the most important thing on paper connected not a bibliography a week might not know our bible we might not know our books but we know the author celestia you didn't but god wanted to ask him what is your responsibility therefore responsibility befalls us in every field of life attention pay attention you can be charged of course that's why in genesis where we just read it genesis chapter four verse nf verse nine genesis genesis chapter four verse nine let you know and the he knew what he had done to his brother but he started denying the thing april and uh also being arrogant la pir de shows the worst thing it's somebody being arrogant in this switch you say my my brother's keeper eddie and he said what has doubt done you a man may not defense a pop conscience now he's brave facing him before his own conscience you know there's something that touched me i went to see the pastors by his office while we were talking he was a little late asking if who could go somewhere he said that he was going to visit somebody ask myself i asked her if i was the pastor's duty today i brought it out obj application then i applied it to everyone i asked myself the work that the ushers and the the job that others could say until they fail that's what the past is doing now it's april 6 okay give me the opportunity to speak from there i didn't prepare the subject when the person asked me that crossed my mind he comes in this is available i had said that since it's april 6th because have become japan visited farm out there i'll go to visit borah martial company i'll always be with my wife if i have an opportunity with the children foreign and give solutions because you have a responsibility in the church souvenirs you remember what i told you foreign that brought me to think so much here's a message and i told myself if i have to schmidt because some responsibilities before me because they also said let everyone take his part of the responsibility regardless in in my own life i don't like to uh measure this sense but i'm telling you truthfully and then when the one is fresher the other one if one is called the other one can hit him we want that everyone can take the part of the responsibility what i was thinking i i will do it jeff offend i'm asking you let me minister the city please the ministers from this church they have need of your prayers set eglise this church have need of your prayers the pastor descent eglise the pastor of this church have need of your prayers what the mother your husband is on devote upon you you have need of your prayers cephein pedestrian [Music] zacharias and he didn't go with her views ella and jesus because she had believed on jesus she believed him to be just what he was the messiah manifested because she had seen him to do the sign of him speaking about rebecca she knew she wanted him to be to be brought face to face and a man ever standing face to face because it does something to you he's not like the other man he is different although the priest and them had said there's nothing to say it's just a bogus oaks but she believed it so she was praying now rebecca rebecca rebecca is calling you now rebecca give me foreign you'll that's the thing that is missing today the mothers have turned the book somewhere the bible don't even speak about it i love take this man before the lord jesus and put us in prayer no more rebecca our mother's rebellion please so the time had drawn so close so the next morning jesus jesus has to pass away so all night he twisted in the bed and he was miserable and uh she was laying there praying and no doubt that in the night when they would work out she would say thank you the rebecca was praying away from that don't go down there no more sell our footage there is nothing to it my passion just be patient i live god is working forever you sing second success that's the way it does when you go to praying for something some somebody commands a producer something just goes to take him please there is women friends not praying prayer is the keynote shows the principles prayer is the kingdom asking you shall be received we have sisters who have not believed this message probably we have parents who have not believed the message but it is the promise of the bible the god said everyone that have loved you and shall serve the lord city and alfred if you probably have a delinquent children probably zacchaeus who does not listen tell god lord i in my house i'm going to show you guys in four layers along the jeans john chapter eight peter with john chapter 8 verse 24 john 8 24 i said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sin for if you believe not that i am down you shall i have many things to say and to judge yourself to judge of you when you have lifted up the son of man allah ever talked to me i speak these things the father have not left him before i do always those those things are that please him say look if you say like the one who have sent you on earth he will not always leave you alone if you do all that pleases him the bible says everything that is good it should be always the subject of your meditation if you continue in my word then you are truly my disciples and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free capital that's the main thing say they connect and relocate is to know him the author of the word of god then they answered him they answered him we are abraham seed and i have never been under the bondage of anyone see how say yes now jesus said answered to them everyone that practices he is the bond man of sin oh let's stop now the bond abides not in the house the sun abides forever sit down if therefore the sun shall set you free you shall be really free i know that you're if there's something to avoid in life [Applause] it's when the word of god is praised that that doesn't have any entrance in you hello [Applause] if you were abraham's children he would do the works of abraham selamat shows that's the same way if we are abraham's sins [Applause] we have to do abraham's word deeds maintenance but now you seek to kill me a man who has spoken the truth which i have heard from god we are not born of our fornication we have one father god jesus jesus said to them [Music] if god were to your father who may make it you would have loved it are he was a murderer from the beginning this is kane's nature jesus he was a murderer from the beginning he said that today killing that's just killing somebody [Applause] when somebody cannot listen to the word of god a god can speak through a language a coded language but if you cannot listen to his words it's a very hard for you to understand what is between the last because for the word of god to take place in somebody said demanding humility it requires humility but look at kane's nature and my a liar and a hogan in arrogant sizzle hey my brother's keeper illness they didn't know until before whom they were standing because therefore replica jesus answered genes i have not admitted but i honor my father and you dishonor me but i do not seek my own glory you shall never see death it didn't maintain now it said now luigi relative the jew therefore saying now we know that that has a demon abraham has died le prophet ocean and the prophet at the secret can guard my parents and thou sayest if anyone wants to give him a letter you shall never taste death cannot appear abraham are thou greater

him that now remember abram abraham elohim elohim god in made flesh how abraham saw god jesus who is jesus abraham was ahead by the day by the heat of the day wasn't the problem abraham said that let me go sit under the tree on the roadway of memory teller while he was seated meditative abraham was meditating they're thinking on jesus every time that [Music] from the beginning the earth was avoided jesus christ and the spirit of god was moving upon this everyone and i'm saying before that just created what was because and abraham gave him a uh a kick of me of course and brother what i'm saying for me the wife and he just went into a vessel of welfare avec moyes with moses said la promesque it was the promise i shall come down for this year to take the children of israel out out of israel but jesus didn't come to come down you in the scriptures there was no problem to free the children but read between the lord that's the most important thing say like actually you read between
