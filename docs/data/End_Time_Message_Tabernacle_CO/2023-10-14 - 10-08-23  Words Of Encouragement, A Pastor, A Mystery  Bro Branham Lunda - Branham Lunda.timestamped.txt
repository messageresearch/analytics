[0:02] may the Lord bless
[0:05] you may God bless
[0:13] you I wanted to take this
[0:19] opportunity to read this uh words of of
[0:25] encouragement that has been sent to
[0:28] me
[0:31] I think two years ago or a year or
[0:34] so by a
[0:39] pastor and upon that
[0:44] basis I wanted to read that
[0:49] today as we wish to honor our
[0:53] pastor that can comfort
[0:57] him and that can also Comfort us all
[1:03] a
[1:07] pastor a very hard
[1:12] work nobody
[1:16] knows what a pastor
[1:20] hears what he
[1:24] sees the secret he must
[1:28] keep Temptation he
[1:33] encounters the tears he
[1:37] shed the sorrow he
[1:41] endures the loness he deals
[1:45] with the grievance he
[1:53] experiences it's sometime not being
[1:56] understood by his biological family
[2:04] sometime he's not being understood by
[2:06] the church he
[2:13] leadth the lies told against him by some
[2:17] of the people he
[2:25] serves how he welcomes those that claim
[2:28] to love him by being hand them they
[2:30] destroy
[2:34] him how he tries to live more than
[2:39] [Music]
[2:41] human the lack he suffers
[2:48] from the Discrimination to which he must
[2:51] not
[2:54] react the accusation
[2:58] silence the expectation he strives to
[3:07] face even if fellow Pastor doesn't know
[3:10] what he the other is going
[3:17] through he lives for God and yet he
[3:20] lives for
[3:27] us a pastor and the Pastoral Care is
[3:32] what no one can fully
[3:36] understand the word Pastor is a
[3:42] mystery the pastor himself is also a
[3:47] mystery and a
[3:51] mystery is an comprehens Inc
[3:54] comprehensible and intelligibility and
[3:59] therefore
[4:06] so all you can do for
[4:09] him is to pray for
[4:17] him a day must not go by without him
[4:22] being in the
[4:28] gap wish him luck and try to understand
[4:35] him at least pleased
[4:45] him because an unhappy Pastor is a
[4:48] disaster for the Church of
[4:52] God respect your
[4:56] pastor pray for your pastor
[5:01] encourage your
[5:05] pastor honor and celebrate your
[5:10] pastor and
[5:19] therefore stop judging pastors because
[5:22] of what you have heard or
[5:27] seen may God bless you all
[5:30] in this
[5:32] day for all your
[5:35] prayers for all your
[5:37] sacrif and your
[5:41] support as you honor your pastor amen
