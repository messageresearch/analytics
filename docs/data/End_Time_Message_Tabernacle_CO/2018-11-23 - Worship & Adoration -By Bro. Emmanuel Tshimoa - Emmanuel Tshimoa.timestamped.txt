[1:00:19] see the word where the bottom is using a
[1:00:21] scope of a demographer but absolutely
[1:00:24] absolutely more essential sincere
[1:00:26] necessary necessary compelling up along
[1:00:30] may God bless you you could never be
[1:00:32] nice
[1:00:40] oh god bless you so the announcement I
[1:00:47] wanted to make was because we decided
[1:00:51] given the fact that but before we go
[1:00:54] there how many people will be available
[1:00:56] tomorrow to have a fellowship with us
[1:01:01] tomorrow here and where's your hand if
[1:01:03] you will be available to attend if we
[1:01:05] have a fellowship here our church if you
[1:01:08] can raise your hand please before we can
[1:01:09] see
[1:01:19] well well that's over I was the whole
[1:01:21] point so we decided I mean we wanted to
[1:01:23] have a fellowship for the majority of
[1:01:25] the church and since he appeared at the
[1:01:27] major of the church was not going to be
[1:01:28] available we decided to have a opinion
[1:01:32] share on the Sunday
[1:01:33] I'll bring insurance and a pretty
[1:01:35] much--it's I mean whatever you have
[1:01:38] whatever you can bring from your house
[1:01:39] we can all bring it together and how the
[1:01:41] fellowship downstairs on Sunday because
[1:01:43] just the fact that we had a short notice
[1:01:45] we didn't make announcement last Sunday
[1:01:47] and a lot of people had you know a lot
[1:01:49] of complication and everything so we
[1:01:51] didn't want to just have a fellowship
[1:01:53] with a few numbers but if for any reason
[1:01:56] you have something else in mind some of
[1:01:58] you want to still gather I'm I'm totally
[1:02:00] open but I don't know anybody if you
[1:02:02] you're welcome to maybe give an opinion
[1:02:04] if you I think that we should still you
[1:02:07] know have a fellowship tomorrow I'm
[1:02:08] working well I mean we welcome to do
[1:02:10] that anybody
[1:02:13] I think but it's clear if there is no
[1:02:16] majority people can still FDR's
[1:02:19] Thanksgiving at or home via to three
[1:02:21] family the way they feel and Sunday you
[1:02:26] can have a fellowship together because
[1:02:28] the purpose to have a fellowship is to
[1:02:30] have the group together but if it's just
[1:02:32] a small group we should have been
[1:02:36] prepared for it is a long time so anyway
[1:02:40] Happy Thanksgiving a La Manga - bonne
[1:02:43] fête Thanksgiving
