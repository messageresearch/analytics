[4:19] hello hello kids we're back again with
[4:23] another Sunday School lesson I hope you
[4:26] guys had a great week we all know that
[4:29] today is a special day today is Mother's
[4:32] Day and I hope you all showed in some
[4:34] way or form how much you appreciate your
[4:37] mother brother Brennan says that
[4:39] Mother's Day should be every day so it's
[4:41] not just on Mother's Day that you wake
[4:43] up and give your mom a big hug or you
[4:46] tell her I love you or you bring her
[4:48] flowers or gifts no it should be every
[4:51] day that you should appreciate your
[4:52] mom's and even your dice too but since
[4:55] today's Mother's Day were going to have
[4:56] a special lesson on the mothers how
[5:00] about this you guys if you haven't done
[5:02] it already even like right now wherever
[5:04] your mom is just go out to her give her
[5:07] a big hug you can even possibly but
[5:11] anyways just go over to her give her a
[5:13] big hug tell her how much you love her
[5:15] and appreciate her because mothers are
[5:18] like the best thing in the world brother
[5:20] Branham says that she is the fifth
[5:21] gospel and we know in the Bible we have
[5:23] Matthew Mark Luke dawn right and those
[5:26] are only four but brother Branham says
[5:28] that she's a fifth because she's the one
[5:31] that's gonna be teaching you she's the
[5:32] one that's gonna be raising you ever
[5:33] since you were a little baby she was the
[5:35] first one that was with you and until
[5:37] now whatever age you guys are your
[5:40] mother is always gonna be there for you
[5:41] so once you learn to love and respect
[5:44] our mothers I should appreciate them
[5:45] help them out whenever they tell you to
[5:47] do something you know you want to listen
[5:49] and you want to obey to what they're
[5:50] telling you as mothers do a lot of work
[5:52] a lot of sacrifices that you may at this
[5:55] moment may not really understand but get
[5:57] older you will start to understand so
[6:00] wherever she is right now if you want to
[6:02] just give her a big hug a big kiss tell
[6:04] her you how much you love her and
[6:05] appreciate her and then we will just
[6:07] start into our sentence blessing
[6:09] all right so I will just open up with a
[6:13] word of Prayer and then we'll just jump
[6:15] into our list all right dear Heavenly
[6:19] Father God we thank you again for this
[6:21] lovely morning that you gave it to us O
[6:22] God for keeping us safe O God we think
[6:25] before the mothers that you've given to
[6:26] us so by we just pray that you give them
[6:28] a long life of God and strength to
[6:30] continue raising their children that
[6:32] you've given to them Oh father but and
[6:34] as we're doing this Sunday School lesson
[6:36] or father that I pray that you'll just
[6:38] speak to each of each of the kids over
[6:40] that are there that are listening in
[6:41] their rooms and made being near to them
[6:42] putting everything into your hands in
[6:44] Jesus name we pray amen amen
[6:47] all right so today I just wanted to
[6:51] bring out a little story that brother
[6:53] Branham talked about gays but mother
[6:55] dear and you know that brother Branham
[6:58] as a prophet as he was when he wasn't
[7:00] preaching or out doing his he'll uh the
[7:04] the miracle services he was hunting
[7:08] that's what brother Branham loved to do
[7:09] he loved the hunt he loved to go out in
[7:11] the woods in the mountains or wherever
[7:13] he could where he could just relax his
[7:15] mind because when he was at home or
[7:17] wherever he was in the healing services
[7:20] people were always asked to come up to
[7:22] brother Brennaman as for the man please
[7:23] pray for me or brother Bennett I have a
[7:25] question about this right because he was
[7:27] the prophet of buck and everybody knew
[7:29] that brother Bentham had a special gift
[7:30] in his life so everybody wanted a chance
[7:33] to be with brother Bennett so in order
[7:35] for brother Branham to relax and just
[7:37] kind of get away and get rested he would
[7:40] go out and do the filling hunt for the
[7:42] venom love nature he always said that he
[7:44] saw God in nature that's where he always
[7:46] wanted to be always loved hunting you
[7:50] know being with his friends up in the
[7:52] mountains well one day brother Branham
[7:54] went out hunting with one of the friends
[7:57] who was also a hunter but the different
[8:01] thing about this hunter was this hunter
[8:03] was a very mean man it was a very mean
[8:06] hunter he was a good man for the benefit
[8:08] he was a very nice man to be with but
[8:10] the thing that he did is when he went
[8:12] hunting he would just hunt or fine you
[8:15] know not not in a way up to get game or
[8:18] food to take home and eat but he would
[8:20] just kill the animals just to kill them
[8:22] for fun and leave the
[8:23] their walk away right and we know that's
[8:26] wrong because you're not supposed to do
[8:27] that well brother branham didn't like
[8:29] that about that hunter and that
[8:31] country's name was Bert or the Benham
[8:33] say she was a real rule hearted man when
[8:35] he came to hunting he was a good hunter
[8:37] oh he could hunt really good but he was
[8:39] very cool and he liked the hunt deer
[8:42] that we all know the big deers that we
[8:43] might see where maybe when were driving
[8:45] we see the deer they got their big horn
[8:47] so they have a mother dear mother deer
[8:49] is called a doe and a baby deer is all
[8:51] the fun and that hunter his name was
[8:53] Bert he loved to hunt those little fawns
[8:56] and just killed them and just go away
[8:58] you know just be like well I'd shot one
[9:00] and I did a good job and I would just go
[9:02] away for the Benham didn't like that
[9:04] brother Bennett says he's so pro his
[9:06] eyes even look like lizard I'm not sure
[9:08] if you guys seen a lizard but lizard
[9:10] they're very these really slimy animals
[9:12] and they have the weird-looking eyes
[9:13] right so the Bennett says his eyes was
[9:15] almost like a lizard right so one day
[9:18] they weren't hunting and this this man
[9:20] Bert's he used to call brother branham a
[9:22] chicken hearted preacher why because he
[9:23] thought brother branham such a chicken
[9:26] hearted preacher he doesn't like
[9:27] shooting he doesn't like hunting just
[9:29] for fun you know he only should so he
[9:31] can get food bring back to his family
[9:33] he's too calm a chicken hearted feels
[9:35] like all you preachers you guys you guys
[9:37] you guys are just so soft-hearted that's
[9:39] what he's gonna Brennan brother Brennan
[9:41] would tell Bert you don't have to do
[9:43] that that's wrong that's really rough it
[9:45] so remember we're talking about Mother's
[9:47] Day okay and this is a story about
[9:49] mother okay so they're out hunting and
[9:52] when they were hunting he told her the
[9:54] better guess what guess what I brought
[9:56] today and he brought out a little
[9:58] whistle and this little whistle what he
[10:00] would do with these he would blow into
[10:03] that whistle and that whistle would blow
[10:05] a sound that sounded like a baby deer
[10:07] crying so that's why he bought me sure
[10:10] it's a brother Brennaman brother Brenham
[10:11] said oh man bert why would you do this
[10:14] right so they start hunting and they
[10:16] couldn't find any animals they couldn't
[10:18] find any meat so what they decided to do
[10:20] they said well we're gonna just stop by
[10:23] little blog somewhere by a tree we're
[10:25] just gonna sit down maybe have lunch and
[10:27] we'll wait so but the venom and the man
[10:30] bird they just sat down and they started
[10:32] to maybe take out their lunches or
[10:34] whatever and brother branham you notice
[10:36] out of the corner
[10:37] his eyes that worked was taking
[10:38] something out of his oh maybe
[10:40] he's just taking out a little thermos
[10:42] maybe sick now his sandwich before he
[10:45] knows it
[10:45] if Burt takes out that little whistle
[10:47] and starts blowing into my defenses oh
[10:50] no Burt why are good you gonna do that
[10:54] that's so cool of you and he said oh
[10:55] whatever you chicken hearted preacher
[10:57] mr. Benham started to rebuke you Missy
[11:00] you know you're gonna put you're gonna
[11:02] kill some poor little fun out there that
[11:04] is innocent for no reason he said oh
[11:06] it's nothing so what he did is he blew
[11:09] into that whistle and that whistle blew
[11:12] out a really pitiful cry of a little fun
[11:14] I was crying brother branham is so
[11:18] heartbroken and he doesn't know what to
[11:19] do and all of a sudden right in the into
[11:22] the clear remember how I said before
[11:24] they were trying to hunt they couldn't
[11:25] find any animals and all of a sudden
[11:27] there came up big mother dear she just
[11:32] stood right there right in the front of
[11:34] them both of them are sitting and she
[11:36] comes up right in front of them maybe
[11:38] she was just laying there hiding from
[11:39] the hunters but when she heard that
[11:41] little part of the whistle she thought
[11:44] oh that must be a little fun out there
[11:46] that's Craig that doesn't have a mother
[11:48] well she stood up she started to look
[11:50] around mother Brennan said she started
[11:51] to look around and she saw brother
[11:53] Brennan and she's called Burt he thought
[11:55] of them sitting there and Burt was ready
[11:57] to fire cuz he already brought out his
[11:59] Benny who's gonna kill the deer or the
[12:02] Ben and said Oh Burt don't do that
[12:04] you're not gonna kill this poor mother
[12:06] this poor mother is such a strong mother
[12:08] does she heard a cry of a faun maybe it
[12:10] was not her pond she didn't know but she
[12:13] was a mother so she wanted to find out
[12:15] where that omelet or where that on was
[12:17] that was in trouble and the deer looked
[12:20] and saw Burt and he saw for the Benham
[12:22] but the deer didn't run away they dared
[12:24] just kept looking and then Burt would
[12:26] probably like whistle though the whistle
[12:28] again and she would just look around
[12:29] wondering where and where did the sound
[12:32] come from and Burt raised his gun he was
[12:35] getting ready to shoot other Brennan
[12:37] said I can't look at this and he turned
[12:40] his head away and he started inside
[12:42] inside up in Christ I don't know did you
[12:44] do this why would you kill this or a
[12:46] loyal mother that wants to take care and
[12:50] skew her fun Burt is getting ready to
[12:53] shoot brother branham just waited and he
[12:56] waited and he waited and or didn't shoot
[13:00] look like the the the the gunshot and he
[13:02] looked over at Burt and what was bird
[13:05] doing he was crying he was cribbing he
[13:08] couldn't even shoot the gun anymore
[13:10] or who the gun down on the floor and he
[13:13] said brother branham lead me to this
[13:15] Jesus that you serve because before Burt
[13:18] was very skeptical about you know with
[13:20] this religion and what brother Bret
[13:22] Baier with Brenda being as a preacher he
[13:24] did understand it but when he saw the
[13:27] Loyalists of the mother in fact of the
[13:29] loyalists that characteristic of a
[13:31] mother it's a good deer that was not
[13:33] even a human being but a deer
[13:35] she saw something special and brother
[13:37] Bennett said that day right there in the
[13:39] middle of the wood Burton gave his heart
[13:41] to the Lord so now what did the deer do
[13:44] the deer didn't do anything the deer did
[13:46] not say anything
[13:47] all she did was just did that she didn't
[13:50] run she didn't back off and hide no she
[13:53] just stood there and what Burt saw he
[13:56] saw something that was different this
[13:57] was not a hood on that the deer said oh
[14:00] you know I'm a mother and I'm gonna go
[14:01] up and search but no it was something
[14:04] that was real inside of her it was not
[14:06] something that she faked it was not
[14:08] something that she pretended so this is
[14:10] the same thing as us as Christian right
[14:12] we don't want to pretend like we're
[14:14] Christians we don't want to fake as a
[14:16] christian right be hypocrite one place
[14:18] we are one thing and another place learn
[14:20] anything right because it doesn't come
[14:22] from debris from the inside of our
[14:23] hearts and people can tell sometimes
[14:25] when you're faking it or when you're not
[14:27] being real or being the real person that
[14:30] God made you so my little lesson that
[14:34] you can take out of this is be who God
[14:37] made you to be right you don't want to
[14:39] try to be someone else or something else
[14:41] that you're not right because when you
[14:43] try to express it to other people
[14:45] it won't come out as real and as
[14:47] Christians we're here we are the light
[14:49] of the world we are a little alike a
[14:52] little candle and they hear that song
[14:53] that we always think I'm gonna let my
[14:54] little light shine right we don't want
[14:56] to hide it but we want to be a true
[14:58] example of what a real Christian is and
[15:01] even there are some good there are
[15:04] bake Christians out there that pretend
[15:06] but on the inside they don't have a part
[15:08] on the inside but when you have God on
[15:10] the inside and you have a true real
[15:12] experience with that and you live a
[15:14] right life with God then it will express
[15:17] it will come out real and true and
[15:20] people will be able to see that and they
[15:22] will be impacted by it then if you were
[15:24] just to be a fake person maybe one day
[15:26] they see you act a certain way the next
[15:29] day they see what church and they say I
[15:30] thought I thought I didn't know you were
[15:32] Christian or maybe they see you at
[15:34] church and then they see you another
[15:36] place and they said oh I thought you
[15:38] were arrested right we want to be
[15:40] genuine want to be real Christian we
[15:42] want to have that real bad experience in
[15:45] our hearts for then it will be able to
[15:47] express itself to others when other
[15:49] people will see you they'll say oh
[15:50] that's a real Christian I like that girl
[15:53] I like that boy I want to be like that
[15:55] boy I want to be like that girl and you
[15:57] never know maybe just by your life he
[16:00] may not even maybe witnessed them maybe
[16:02] just by your life you might be able to
[16:04] touch somebody or maybe bring someone
[16:06] else to the Lord so that's my little
[16:08] lesson I would see me I wanted to bring
[16:10] out to you guys and Sharon if she has
[16:12] something else as they will this right
[16:14] now okay hi kids thing questions be back
[16:21] in front of you today and thank you
[16:24] Shalom for that lesson I'm I hope that
[16:26] was a blessing for you
[16:27] the lesson on Mother's Day as Billy
[16:31] venom said Mother's Day should be every
[16:34] day you should celebrate our mother
[16:35] every day because a mother is the best
[16:38] gift that God had given to us just as
[16:41] Shalom said and I'm just gonna read a
[16:43] short quote from brother Brennan it says
[16:46] in the message called Mother's Day it
[16:49] said but I believe such as such as
[16:53] Mother's Day like this is Iraqi it make
[16:55] a lot of money out of flowers and things
[16:58] but Mother's Day should be every day not
[17:02] to send her a bunch of flowers on
[17:04] Mother's Day but to love her and care
[17:06] for her 365 days and nights all
[17:10] throughout the year so this is assuring
[17:13] that you know maybe the world might look
[17:15] at Mother's Day
[17:18] like oh let's just buy flowers or that's
[17:20] just by candy and cards and give it but
[17:24] mothers they should be a thing that
[17:25] every single day to really show your
[17:27] mother that you love her you have to
[17:29] tell her that you love her you have to
[17:31] be there for her hey mom I see you're
[17:34] kind of tired today what can I do to
[17:36] help you can I clean up for you or
[17:39] depending how old you are mom you might
[17:41] cook for you can I can I do this man
[17:44] take care of the of my other siblings
[17:45] for you that shows your mom that you
[17:48] that you care and you really do love her
[17:51] because mothers do a lot for us since we
[17:54] were born as babies they carried us they
[17:57] fed us they taught us all that we know
[18:01] and mothers deserve also a me grow up
[18:04] and when we're able to help them out to
[18:06] do that as much as possible a mother is
[18:08] someone who can do so many sacrifices
[18:10] for you just like we heard in the story
[18:12] of the deer the mother knew that maybe
[18:15] know there could be a hunter out there
[18:18] to kill her but Iceland is she really
[18:19] cried she was ready to risk her own life
[18:22] just to come out and they save a baby
[18:24] that's what mothers do and butter brown
[18:27] talks about another story of a woman who
[18:32] she had her baby under house caught on
[18:35] fire the mother knew that her baby was
[18:38] in the house and she knew that the house
[18:40] is on fire I go in there I'll probably
[18:42] burn and but she was like she don't
[18:43] think here all that mattered to her at
[18:45] that noise for the baby so she went into
[18:47] the house full of fire and she got burnt
[18:51] even if she got to protect your baby the
[18:53] baby didn't get burnt the baby was
[18:55] covered up in blankets but she got
[18:57] burned and all her face was scarred and
[18:59] she got hurt and she looked ugly so
[19:02] that's what mothers do for they're ready
[19:04] to with their own eyes and be knowing
[19:06] that they can die something bad can
[19:09] happen to them that they can do that for
[19:10] us so in return this Mother's Day I'm
[19:13] gonna talk to all of you guys it's good
[19:16] to tell your mother to hug her to give
[19:18] her flowers and that's what you should
[19:20] be doing every day and also to do that
[19:22] extra step of showing your mom that you
[19:24] up there by doing something extra and
[19:26] maybe you never clean up you saying no
[19:28] mom you know what I'm old enough today
[19:30] I'm gonna start
[19:31] I play I'm gonna start putting my own
[19:32] clothes away or instead of think I'm
[19:34] gonna just use his pen to clean up my
[19:36] own you're not here for always a high
[19:38] time to talk you know because the older
[19:41] we get the more responsible we have to
[19:43] become so make sure you're telling your
[19:48] mom that you love her and enjoying this
[19:50] Mother's Day as well as praying for her
[19:52] always and giving her as much help as
[19:55] you can because she has done she's done
[19:57] also a lot for you during the whole life
[19:59] and so I hope that you guys are also
[20:04] doing well and you are able to follow
[20:07] this lesson but gonna say a word of
