[20:36] seated a prayer
[20:40] night I'm going to speak a few
[20:46] words uh just to build our faith to what
[20:51] we want to ask God
[21:00] so as I think I announced last uh Sunday
[21:09] also Sunday after service God willing I
[21:13] will have a
[21:18] meeting with the girls 13 years and
[21:30] with uh their respective
[21:37] mothers so let us uh stand and take the
[21:45] scripture we are going to read in the
[21:47] Book of James chapter 4
[21:59] versus uh I mean you
[22:02] can take
[22:05] uh the reading from wherever you want
[22:10] once you go
[22:13] [Music]
[22:17] home yeah just chapter 4 of the book of
[22:22] James
[22:28] because on the verse one he
[22:32] said from whence come Wars and fightings
[22:37] among
[22:41] you come they not hence even of your
[22:45] last that were in your
[22:52] members so if you
[22:55] read uh it's very very important to to
[22:58] show that we are
[23:06] fighting uh just to save time I'm going
[23:09] to take verse
[23:12] [Music]
[23:15] S submit yourselves therefore to
[23:21] God resist the devil and he will flee
[23:25] from you
[23:29] and I'm taking the thought of resist the
[23:31] devil and he will flee from
[23:37] you may the Lord bless the reading of
[23:40] the
[23:42] scripture may be
[23:45] seated uh this is
[23:48] verse brother Bram
[23:52] said resist the
[23:56] devil he's not going to walk away from
[24:02] you he will not run away walk
[24:07] away but he's going to
[24:11] flee amen amen resist the
[24:17] devil he will not walk
[24:23] away but he will
[24:26] flee so this is a very serious
[24:31] fight so as we are building our
[24:41] prayer
[24:43] um we are not on a
[24:48] picnic we are on the
[24:52] battlefield uh if you look at yourself
[24:55] through the circle I show you
[25:01] you will know that it's a serious
[25:05] battle and you are not going to
[25:10] relax so Christian
[25:13] Life it's
[25:15] not that we are on a picnic to
[25:23] relax brother Bram said in the message a
[25:27] deceive the church by the
[25:33] world paragraph
[25:36] 8 and I want you as I'm reading the quot
[25:45] tonight I have always selected the word
[25:49] remember and highlighted in red
[25:59] in
[26:01] Red so when brother is saying
[26:05] remember that means it's just a
[26:11] reminder
[26:13] remember we are not on a
[26:18] picnic but we are in a
[26:22] battlefield many people just think that
[26:25] when they become a Christian
[26:30] that that's all they need to
[26:33] do that settles it
[26:39] forever as they are a Christian and
[26:43] every is going to come
[26:50] easy don't never get that in your head
[26:59] for I become a Christian to
[27:04] fight fight the good fight of
[27:09] faith I become a Christian to get in the
[27:13] battle
[27:17] lines we are Christian
[27:21] Soldiers and we got to be
[27:25] trained and brought up
[27:32] and know all the techniques of the
[27:37] enemy to know how to
[27:42] fortify to know how to fight the
[27:49] fight and we can only do that as the
[27:53] holy spirit will reveal it to us
[28:01] we cannot take what some other Nation
[28:04] tells
[28:07] us when we go to
[28:11] war some of their
[28:16] ideas but we got to take our own
[28:22] ideas the way the Holy Spirit would
[28:25] direct us
[28:29] so it's to you as
[28:33] individual you must have the Holy
[28:36] Spirit to direct you on your own
[28:42] fight we are not the
[28:45] same some people are fighting over
[28:48] lasting over
[28:52] women some are fighting against negative
[28:56] thought
[29:01] against
[29:03] imaginations against
[29:08] affections and many many other
[29:12] things so you must
[29:16] know your
[29:20] weaknesses and what things you are here
[29:22] to
[29:26] overcome amen amen the way the Holy
[29:29] Spirit Will direct
[29:32] us and what ideas he would give
[29:38] us because he is the commanding
[29:44] chief of the army of the
[29:48] Christian amen amen hallelujah amen and
[29:52] the Holy
[29:53] Spirit in you will tell you that you
[29:58] with the word of God don't look at the
[30:03] circles there is
[30:05] this there is this how can I
[30:09] overcome the holy spirit in you is

[38:23] and God is under obligation
[38:28] to see that you get

[38:46] God because let me tell you this before
[38:51] God could have made a
[38:54] promise he already see this
[38:59] solution so you just take the
[39:03] promise and you have the
[39:05] solution if you don't want to take the
[39:10] promise and take the correct mental
[39:17] attitude then you cannot see
[39:21] anything Bram said in the message the
[39:25] greatest battle ever fought
[39:36] 394 God's
[39:39] Army close up your
[39:44] mind close up your
[39:47] mind don't stop for a
[39:53] minute to think of anything the devil
[39:56] has got to offer
[40:04] you through your
[40:07] senses so Satan can come through your
[40:12] senses five of the
[40:16] body five of the
[40:19] spirit Satan comes always to
[40:24] offer would you look at this
[40:28] would you think like
[40:30] this would you remember this in your
[40:34] memory and in your
[40:37] affections oh you know you know you
[40:40] don't have to love
[40:42] everybody can you hate this
[40:44] one look at this one what he got can you
[40:48] be a little bit
[40:50] jealous those are offers from
[40:55] satanam said
[40:57] don't stop for a
[41:01] minute remember minute to think of
[41:10] anything the devil has to offer you
[41:12] through your
[41:16] senses but
[41:19] remember God's
[41:21] word can never
[41:25] fail amen amen regardless of his
[41:31] offers his
[41:35] offers word uh God's
[41:38] word already
[41:41] promised can never
[41:44] fail these two great
[41:49] armies when the enemy comes in like a
[41:52] flood
[41:58] what is the correct word in
[42:00] French
[42:06] come as is coming
[42:10] today what did God say he will
[42:14] do the spirit of
[42:17] God would raise up a stander against
[42:24] it amen amen if Satan come with many
[42:27] many many
[42:31] attacks whatever whatsoever
[42:35] kind the spirit of
[42:38] God will rise
[42:42] up Stander against
[42:45] it are you one of
[42:48] them yes sir so this age we are living
[42:53] in it's the most evil age never existed
[43:01] because Satan is on the earth
[43:06] physically trying to challenge
[43:11] anyone he come with the
[43:14] physical make you get
[43:17] sick he make you sick also in your
[43:22] spirit by corrupting your mind
[43:27] are giving you all the
[43:29] things when I'm talking about the thing
[43:31] always remember those two those three
[43:40] circles locate where your
[43:47] problems regardless of how how the devil
[43:50] is going to raise
[43:53] up even if he has conquered this Earth
[43:59] in these last
[44:00] days the whole Heaven
[44:04] also is on the
[44:07] earth to fight for
[44:11] you amen amen so therefore my brothers
[44:17] sisters with all that we have
[44:21] spoken don't be
[44:24] afraid you are a son and daughter of
[44:28] God you have the word of
[44:31] God that's the sword God has given to
[44:35] you use
[44:37] it and you have the victory
[44:41] already you know the technique of the
[44:46] devil is trying to disbelieve you the
[44:49] efficiency of your
[44:55] weapon no no no no no he's trying
[44:59] to sometimes you lost me with the ideas
[45:02] also uh what did I
[45:04] say uh it may make you disbelieve your
[45:08] own
[45:16] weapon yeah that's what Satan is trying
[45:18] to
[45:19] do but it's the most powerful
[45:24] weapon and say Satan
[45:28] you cannot make me
[45:30] disbel I have full
[45:33] confidence in my
[45:36] weapon amen amen amen amen
[45:40] now let me tell you let the key now we
[45:45] are saying you have to resist we have to
[45:49] resist how to
[45:52] resist how to
[45:55] resist because if if you try to resist
[45:58] by
[46:01] yourself you are going to
[46:04] fail if you try to resist by
[46:08] yourself I'm not going to think
[46:12] evil
[46:17] this I can tell you it was for
[46:23] myself God has given me tremendous
[46:30] things I was wondering one of the
[46:37] day say Lord and he gave me a
[46:43] dream in that
[46:45] dream I was in
[46:49] jail I was
[46:52] wondering I have a lot of things to
[46:55] do I have to go to church
[47:01] and
[47:02] then I got the message mess Paul Paul a
[47:11] prisoner that's the tape I have been
[47:13] listening
[47:18] to in that
[47:20] tape I got
[47:25] something said
[47:27] you know even the thing we are trying to
[47:31] do I have been pushing the church you
[47:35] know we have to see all those uh uh
[47:39] Supernatural
[47:50] things which is
[47:52] good but God told
[47:54] me all the things
[47:57] is his
[48:00] sovereignty it's his
[48:03] sovereignty yes don't try to force
[48:07] God you just believe the
[48:10] word move on if it has to
[48:14] happen it will happen according to God's
[48:17] Own
[48:19] plan because when we try to
[48:23] force we are going to fall in another
[48:26] trap
[48:29] which is
[48:31] pride ah you see we preach the things
[48:35] look at
[48:36] this it is
[48:38] wonderful but who is going to get the
[48:45] glory if what we are trying to
[48:51] obtain is not for his
[48:54] glory we better stop
[49:01] God deals with people in a different
[49:07] way he can talk to you in
[49:11] dream listening of the
[49:15] word it's
[49:17] wonderful and since I'm feeling like I'm
[49:21] a
[49:24] prisoner you cannot think think on your
[49:29] own you cannot do on your
[49:33] own act like a
[49:36] prisoner you have no more Liberty of
[49:39] your
[49:41] own that's what God is looking
[49:44] for don't let your
[49:48] body let your
[49:50] body your mind your
[49:53] spirit let everything
[49:57] be at the control of
[50:01] God amen amen so how do you
[50:06] resist brother Bram
[50:09] said in order for you to
[50:16] succeed resisting the
[50:20] devil put the
[50:24] word put the word in your
[50:29] that means you must be reading
[50:34] enough you must be listening to the word
[50:37] all the
[50:38] time that your mind is loaded with the
[50:46] word the devil will have no room where
[50:49] to
[50:52] say it will always be loaded
[50:57] it is
[50:58] written it is written because
[51:02] Satan will spare
[51:05] nobody even
[51:07] Jesus on the earth Satan
[51:11] went this
[51:13] guy he did not eat 40
[51:17] days he must be
[51:20] hungry he
[51:22] said can you turn this thing into bread
[51:26] for two feed
[51:32] yourself do you know that Jesus could do
[51:37] that but he did not do
[51:40] it we have to watch our motive and
[51:46] objective even something you can
[51:50] do what's the
[51:53] purpose Jesus said it is written
[51:57] mat
[52:01] 4 men shall not leave by bread
[52:07] alone brother our life is not about
[52:13] bread if we are
[52:15] living it's not about job to make
[52:20] money you know this is another trap of
[52:23] the devil
[52:27] uh give me those
[52:31] Circle those things we are
[52:35] doing in our
[52:38] life there are a lot of
[52:43] influences influence to the extent
[52:46] sometimes we don't
[52:51] know but we think like we are fighting
[52:53] how are we fighting
[52:59] you see I was uh all the time watching
[53:04] this circle I go in I go
[53:12] out you see all the
[53:16] thing is
[53:18] there and all the
[53:21] things they are outer influences
[53:27] exterior
[53:29] influences influence we got influences
[53:32] even think we don't
[53:37] know that's
[53:39] why our only
[53:43] influence should be the word of
[53:46] God what the word of God
[53:49] say not the influence of the pastor
[53:52] influence the P not the influence even
[53:55] of your dad and
[53:58] mom because if it's not the word of
[54:03] God your dad will tell
[54:05] you like uh
[54:09] son
[54:10] daughter uh you are
[54:13] married but don't forget
[54:16] me it's an influence on
[54:19] you and if you are not
[54:24] prudent the pastor will say
[54:27] the place of the woman in the
[54:31] kitchen the
[54:41] family it's going
[54:43] to move
[54:45] you it's going to shake
[54:47] you I don't say don't help a parent I
[54:50] like also my
[54:53] kids but your influence must be the word
[54:57] of
[55:01] God amen amen because as human
[55:06] being we have
[55:09] needs which is normal if you look
[55:14] here there is no
[55:16] need because we have need we have to to
[55:20] to
[55:21] dress we have to eat those thing are
[55:25] there to help our body
[55:28] but the problem is not about
[55:31] needs it's about
[55:35] want
[55:37] want I want this I want this I want this
[55:42] and if you
[55:44] give that
[55:46] person can be an influence of your
[55:53] life and even prevent you from Liv the
[55:56] word
[56:00] God the pastor need
[56:03] money can he send you to go steal to
[56:06] bring him
[56:10] money no your discernment must stop
[56:17] it in a normal
[56:21] life I have the obligation to feed and
[56:25] raise my
[56:30] children but I have no
[56:33] obligation for
[56:35] myom can
[56:43] help if you don't feed your
[56:47] children they can sue
[56:51] you but if I don't do with my brother or
[56:54] my mother
[57:03] nowhere even if you do there is no
[57:07] consideration we have to be aware of our
[57:14] being and stand as a
[57:18] Christian and resist because we are in a
[57:24] fight amen amen it's fight we need to be
[57:27] aware of
[57:31] everything at work the
[57:34] boss can intimidate
[57:37] you it's also an influence over
[57:41] you you have to work on
[57:44] Sunday you must work and will fire you
[57:49] it's influence but we have to
[57:52] resist because they fight
[57:56] let me tell
[57:58] you a little bit hard here let us take
[58:01] the Bible
[58:03] now let's take uh
[58:08] Ephesians
[58:15] because
[58:17] Ephesians chapter
[58:20] 6 listen to the Bible Ephesians 6
[58:24] Ephesians

[58:45] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[58:49] the power of this might his might

[59:30] devil listen to this verse
[59:34] 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and
[59:42] blood sometimes we don't understand what
[59:45] are we fighting
[59:49] for we think we are fighting the
[59:54] flesh no no the word of God has been
[59:58] given to protect us in the
[1:00:03] fight even against thing we don't
[1:00:09] see that's how we have to preach the
[1:00:14] gospel don't you always
[1:00:17] think you are preaching the people
[1:00:21] here the people here are nice people
[1:00:27] but they are evil
[1:00:32] spirit which is not flesh and
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:38] blood maybe you see
[1:00:42] something there is nobody concerned
[1:00:46] here it's not about
[1:00:49] that you don't see the invisible enemies
[1:00:56] said but against
[1:01:03] principalities against
[1:01:07] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:01:10] darkness of this
[1:01:14] world you see the rulers of the darkness
[1:01:18] of this
[1:01:21] world where are they they come to church
[1:01:26] you can walk in the
[1:01:28] church and be visited by certain
[1:01:32] spirit and Paul said the fight we are
[1:01:37] wrestling
[1:01:39] with is not flesh and
[1:01:42] blood against spiritual wickedness in
[1:01:45] high
[1:01:53] places amen amen amen
[1:01:58] therefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:02:01] of
[1:02:04] God that he may be able to withstand in
[1:02:08] the evil
[1:02:13] day and having done all to
[1:02:19] stand stand
[1:02:22] therefore having your loins G about the
[1:02:29] truth so you have to
[1:02:32] have uh the truth for
[1:02:39] B and every on the breast plate of
[1:02:49] righteousness you have to when the enemy
[1:02:52] send his attack you have to have the
[1:02:55] breast plate
[1:02:56] of
[1:03:02] righteousness and your feet sh with the
[1:03:05] preparation of the gospel of
[1:03:13] peace amen amen you have to put your
[1:03:16] feet because your feet is wherever you
[1:03:18] are
[1:03:22] going and your feet can step on the
[1:03:25] enemy's missile under
[1:03:32] ground amen amen when Paul was defining
[1:03:36] the
[1:03:39] things he had in mind a big battle than
[1:03:42] the physical you
[1:03:48] see amen amen you will see that why the
[1:03:54] battle
[1:03:56] we waste our
[1:03:58] time this
[1:04:00] this that's
[1:04:02] flesh that's the flesh the battle is not
[1:04:06] about the
[1:04:08] flesh but the
[1:04:11] devil but the devil has come to this
[1:04:20] temple in a spiritual way
[1:04:26] that he's saying
[1:04:28] something and you if you don't go beyond
[1:04:32] to discern Satan
[1:04:35] behind you will have a problem with
[1:04:38] flesh and
[1:04:41] blood have you seen
[1:04:45] people husband and
[1:04:50] wife they marry for a certain time
[1:04:55] know each other but have you
[1:04:59] seen brother you have a nice suit I

[1:05:06] but I pretend like this is what you are
[1:05:08] wearing uh somebody come huh do you know
[1:05:13] me do you know me but the problem is
[1:05:17] where is the
[1:05:19] problem in the normal
[1:05:23] condition you will never ask wife do you
[1:05:26] know
[1:05:28] me but when you get
[1:05:32] anointed the devil
[1:05:34] enter he's asking you the
[1:05:39] question do you know me do you remember
[1:05:42] me do you know what I
[1:05:45] did are you understanding what I'm
[1:05:48] saying Therefore your
[1:05:51] battle is not against flesh and blood
[1:05:57] just look
[1:05:59] at Satan get out my
[1:06:03] wife you are the old
[1:06:06] enemy you cannot ask me those
[1:06:10] questions my Lord overcame
[1:06:13] you in Jesus
[1:06:15] name but very often the husband do you
[1:06:21] know
[1:06:22] me the wife also so
[1:06:30] where are
[1:06:38] you you are in the B which
[1:06:49] you what did I Doone
[1:06:55] forgive me because it was a
[1:07:00] visitation because your
[1:07:03] battle is not flesh and
[1:07:09] blood if we can understand
[1:07:13] that we will be
[1:07:16] overcoming we will know how to
[1:07:20] resist if you don't know the
[1:07:23] enemy you cannot fight
[1:07:26] so brother Bram said I was reading the
[1:07:28] Bible now I read verse 15 let's go to
[1:07:31] verse
[1:07:33] 16 above

[1:08:16] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:08:25] ing there unto
[1:08:27] with with all perseverance and
[1:08:30] supplication for All
[1:08:37] Saint if you want to
[1:08:40] resist two
[1:08:42] things the
[1:08:44] word
[1:08:47] prayer say the message the greatest
[1:08:50] battle ever fought
[1:08:56] brother paragraph
[1:09:01] 396 we are taught in James
[1:09:09] 47 I don't have time to read
[1:09:12] it James
[1:09:15] 4:7 to resist the
[1:09:19] devil and he won't walk away
[1:09:26] but he will
[1:09:30] flee that means your level of
[1:09:36] resistance must be so
[1:09:40] strong that the
[1:09:42] devil is not going to walk a little
[1:09:46] bit to come
[1:09:48] back but your
[1:09:51] resistance should be in the way
[1:09:55] that he was so
[1:09:57] strong that the devil is going
[1:10:02] to do you understand this step of
[1:10:06] resistance that means don't resist
[1:10:15] weakly
[1:10:18] alol we don't drink in the in our
[1:10:22] church but inside
[1:10:26] you like
[1:10:28] it the Pastor said not to
[1:10:33] drink the devil is not going to
[1:10:37] care but if he give you the
[1:10:41] alcohol you kick
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:48] it he's going
[1:10:50] far this is how we need to stand and
[1:10:53] resist
[1:10:56] Bram
[1:10:58] said but he will
[1:11:01] flee resist the
[1:11:04] devil how do you resist the
[1:11:10] devil the same way our chief Captain
[1:11:13] told us to do
[1:11:17] it take the word of God it is written it
[1:11:22] is written a young girl
[1:11:26] shall not defile her body before
[1:11:29] marriage that's
[1:11:32] resistance and you confess it you
[1:11:35] believe it you act
[1:11:39] upon being
[1:11:42] firm that's how you resist the
[1:11:46] devil is by the word of
[1:11:49] God the chief
[1:11:51] Captain told us just how it was done
[1:11:58] how it was
[1:12:00] done change this Stone into
[1:12:06] bread it is
[1:12:09] written oh come here on the top of the
[1:12:14] mountain and show
[1:12:16] him this is the United
[1:12:19] States jump over
[1:12:21] there and tell the
[1:12:24] angel to receive you it is
[1:12:28] written three times back to
[1:12:32] back and
[1:12:34] then Satan get
[1:12:39] away amen amen that's the real
[1:12:44] resistance in the
[1:12:47] closing to
[1:12:49] resist res to do the is to do the
[1:12:53] opposite
[1:12:57] amen amen he want you to do
[1:13:00] this I'm going to do
[1:13:03] this you know I did not have a chance to
[1:13:06] speak on the
[1:13:10] affections I think by God's
[1:13:14] grace I wanted to speak on
[1:13:17] the the nature of the the soul being the
[1:13:20] nature of the spirit on Sunday
[1:13:28] the soul is the nature of the
[1:13:33] spirit but I think I will take some of
[1:13:36] the affection so that we can be on the
[1:13:38] same because in order to
[1:13:44] resist even when we are praying
[1:13:48] tonight what are those
[1:13:52] affections affection means affection
[1:13:55] your
[1:13:56] love
[1:13:58] compassion
[1:14:00] Etc we have to love one
[1:14:03] another that's what affection is
[1:14:08] about but the
[1:14:10] devil he instead of willing you to do
[1:14:14] that he's bringing
[1:14:19] hatred jealousy
[1:14:23] jealy bitterness
[1:14:27] to the
[1:14:29] extend he will put the thing in
[1:14:33] you and if you don't know you don't
[1:14:36] recognize
[1:14:41] those you will say I will overcome
[1:14:50] imagination all the
[1:14:52] things affections
[1:14:55] you don't have
[1:14:57] any when somebody's
[1:15:00] suffering you are
[1:15:04] happy imagine when you
[1:15:09] suffer Jesus being
[1:15:12] happy those are
[1:15:17] affections what is that thing that you
[1:15:20] cannot forgive anyone
[1:15:26] that's why as we pray
[1:15:29] tonight those
[1:15:32] things negative
[1:15:35] imagination
[1:15:38] conscience
[1:15:40] imagination all the things we have to
[1:15:44] resist amen Amen brother bam said in the
[1:15:49] message United under one
[1:15:53] head in is so in
[1:15:56] paragraph brother bam said everything
[1:15:59] that you see that's
[1:16:03] wrong just do
[1:16:07] opposite and you will be
[1:16:13] right do the
[1:16:17] opposite in question and answer number
[1:16:21] four paragraph 71
[1:16:25] it was a when a person realized he has
[1:16:28] an inferior complex or some sort of
[1:16:39] complex should it be if he was the only
[1:16:42] child caused this in his early youth
[1:16:56] uh you know some people those
[1:17:01] influences the way they have been
[1:17:05] treated or you are born by
[1:17:08] yourself maybe the only boy with a lot
[1:17:10] of
[1:17:12] girls the only girls among many
[1:17:16] boys that can impact
[1:17:20] you and the family the dad the mom
[1:17:25] and they treat you in a certain
[1:17:28] way you will go like
[1:17:31] that and sometimes even in
[1:17:36] marriage you will expect your wife or
[1:17:39] your husband to treat you the way they
[1:17:40] treated
[1:17:46] you because it's a certain influence
[1:17:48] coming
[1:17:52] outside only boy only girl fight and
[1:18:01] resist amen there are
[1:18:04] influences you have to resist to those
[1:18:07] things that's the question that was
[1:18:09] asked to brother
[1:18:11] Bram brother said take exactly the
[1:18:18] opposite if you are always wanting your
[1:18:21] wayen
[1:18:26] and that one little BR that want to
[1:18:30] always have everything your
[1:18:39] way turn right back
[1:18:43] around and give everything to get to God
[1:18:47] the other
[1:18:53] way we to do the
[1:18:56] contrary if you are
[1:18:59] selfish and you want to hold
[1:19:03] everything then start giving away what
[1:19:06] you
[1:19:09] got
[1:19:11] whatever just go the vice
[1:19:18] versa Vera that's the way to overcome
[1:19:22] anything is an antidote amen
[1:19:33] cont amen amen closing
[1:19:37] thought even if you have been
[1:19:42] attacked don't give
[1:19:47] up fight
[1:19:50] back brother BR was telling a story here
