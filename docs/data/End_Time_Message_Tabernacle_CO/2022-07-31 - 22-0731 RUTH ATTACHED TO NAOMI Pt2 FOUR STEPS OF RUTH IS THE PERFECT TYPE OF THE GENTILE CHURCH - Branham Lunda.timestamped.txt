[5:33] [Applause]
[5:36] amen amen

[5:42] welcome brother
[5:44] nathan lubacky
[5:46] [Music]
[5:50] [Applause]
[6:02] uh
[6:11] uh i really believe that's a privilege
[6:13] for me to be in your midst
[6:17] and this is made by god's foreknowledge
[6:21] [Music]
[6:23] daddy is my
[6:25] uncle is the little brother of my father
[6:31] we have not seen
[6:32] each other almost 15 years now
[6:37] but uh god knew that we will meet one
[6:39] day
[6:42] i believe that if our
[6:44] earthly program can be accomplished what
[6:47] about the rapture then
[6:50] complicated
[6:52] and i believe that one day we will meet
[6:53] jesus on the years
[6:57] and also may god bless pastor foster
[6:59] yeah
[7:02] we have been in touch uh actually almost
[7:04] one year
[7:05] contact
[7:08] he's a good pastor
[7:10] and he's so humble
[7:12] you can feel that when he's speaking
[7:14] professional his voice is like a
[7:17] catholic priest
[7:22] so may god bless you
[7:25] i'm going to just say something very
[7:27] short
[7:30] you know the greatest revelation
[7:33] is to know who's god
[7:35] what kid you who's your brother
[7:38] and who is satan
[7:41] often in the message
[7:43] people believe in their experiences
[7:46] but they don't believe in others
[7:49] i want you this morning to believe that
[7:51] the same holy spirit that you have
[7:53] mentioned
[7:56] your
[7:59] you will notice that when judah betrayed
[8:02] jesus
[8:04] [Applause]
[8:06] the holy spirit could not drop down
[8:08] unless there will be twelve listen
[8:24] and they say
[8:38] then the body was completed
[8:40] completely because the twelfth camp
[8:42] pascal
[8:44] and they went up to the harper
[8:47] praying god he created you and the holy
[8:49] ghost dropped down they sent his freedom
[8:51] in other ways
[9:05] but because your brother is
[9:20] amen may not bless you thank you very
[9:22] much
[9:24] uh there is also a
[9:27] death in the community yeah
[9:33] it was a sister celine bombo
[9:37] celine bombo
[9:38] the wife of
[9:41] pastor bombo
[9:43] bastian bombos
[9:44] many of you may not know pastor bombo
[9:47] don't
[9:48] revolutionize that's the first pastor
[9:51] i knew in this message
[9:56] under whose ministry i believe this
[9:59] message is
[10:01] a crucial message
[10:03] whose ministry i started preaching
[10:07] ministers
[10:08] say i appreciate that was a mighty
[10:10] humble man of god
[10:13] did you puss
[10:18] uh
[10:20] she the pastor passed away i think uh 20
[10:23] some years ago
[10:30] maybe 25 years
[10:33] 25 years right because i remember that
[10:35] was the year probably i had the sharing
[10:41] and uh the pastor passed away then
[10:47] the
[10:49] memory i
[10:50] kept from that pastor souvenir
[10:55] ah he was a very very very humble
[10:58] minister
[11:00] minister
[11:04] i remember one time there was a trouble
[11:06] in the church
[11:10] a big intention
[11:13] which even led to the
[11:15] big separation between
[11:19] the church and the creation of chicano
[11:24] [Music]
[11:26] at
[11:28] you know sometimes believers they want
[11:30] to say anything they want to say to the
[11:33] ministers
[11:38] one of the believers want to see the
[11:40] pastor and the queen taliban pastor you
[11:42] don't even have the holy ghost what you
[11:44] now mentally said to speak
[11:47] that man of god see dumb did you he went
[11:50] down on his knees you see
[11:52] and he said brother
[11:54] come
[12:08] probably myself i will not do it
[12:14] but that was really something that
[12:17] marked my life
[12:20] but after he is passing away a press on
[12:24] the pubs some more
[12:26] his wife stayed
[12:28] safa mirristi
[12:30] travel to south africa
[12:34] and
[12:35] it was time for him for her to go back
[12:38] home
[12:41] she has a daughter married to brother
[12:44] cherry in virginia uh elaine marie of
[12:47] africa
[12:49] virginia
[12:50] and uh
[12:52] another daughter married by uh pastor
[12:54] zakola for those who know him you know
[12:57] mario pasteur zakola for success and
[13:00] another daughter who is now who is also
[13:02] married by uh pastor paul who took
[13:06] tabernacles
[13:07] as a pastor now uh
[13:16] so we wish we presented our condolences
[13:19] to the family
[13:23] and i want to also let you know about
[13:25] the event
[13:29] and i want also to take the opportunity
[13:32] to thank you again
[13:45] i think
[13:46] you have done a tremendous work in our
[13:48] preparation
[13:53] and the behavior during the meeting was
[13:55] also wonderful
[14:00] um and uh i think it's time for god to
[14:06] accomplish what he has promised for each
[14:08] one of you
[14:13] the only thing for you is to hold your
[14:16] faith
[14:19] and keep believing you continue your
[14:21] acquire and keep moving you continue
[14:23] advancing and uh also during the time i
[14:27] was in uh europe yeah
[14:30] europe i met with a lot of ministers a
[14:33] lot of people
[14:37] brother sister you don't know how they
[14:40] look at you as an example here
[14:56] a lot of people from different places
[14:59] have their eyes on you pleasure person
[15:01] they plus different owners you fix your
[15:04] voo and we want to keep the quality up
[15:11] not only
[15:12] the quality for
[15:14] what they see
[15:16] from the outside person
[15:19] exterior but to really have the good
[15:22] christian quality inside our
[15:27] and a little mistake that you and i can
[15:31] do
[15:34] you may not realize how many people will
[15:36] be impacted
[15:52] just keep it at the higher level
[15:55] standard garden standard
[15:59] especially musicians special musician
[16:03] technology
[16:05] technology song leaders
[16:17] the little thing you do you say
[16:19] many many people are watching
[16:25] personally
[16:27] and a little mistake you can not imagine
[16:30] how many people will be impacted
[16:34] by
[16:38] i have seen many churches in europe jv
[16:40] preachers
[16:41] on europa
[16:42] they don't have a room of their own
[16:46] proposal by the technology group
[16:49] technology they have always to be there
[16:52] very earlier
[16:54] to plug
[16:56] equipment on the machine and after
[16:58] service they have to unplug them
[17:00] services do have debunks oh if we could
[17:03] only realize the privilege we have
[17:06] imagined
[17:08] brother you don't know the value of what
[17:10] you have
[17:12] seen
[17:14] until you see
[17:16] elsewhere
[17:19] amen
[17:20] people who are
[17:22] coming to unplug and try to fix and try
[17:26] to
[17:27] all these things
[17:40] to continue and to keep up with a
[17:42] wonderful job
[17:45] we have a wonderful job i know continue
[17:50] the meeting i have in france
[17:55] it was pretty much the copy of
[17:57] everything we have done here
[18:05] i had a question we did not see the
[18:08] question and answer from your youth and
[18:11] your couple online in
[18:22] this is to tell you how detailed they
[18:24] are following
[18:28] and some of the people they say we want
[18:30] also to have a banquet
[18:36] we want also to have a couple meetings
[18:41] but the schedule was already filled up
[18:43] with the young people meetings
[18:49] it was uh
[18:51] a lot of young people you have a book
[18:53] with shenzhen
[18:54] some coming from belgium
[18:57] other parts of france
[19:01] oh germany
[19:03] and uh
[19:05] even some pastors they were there with
[19:07] their sheep members
[19:12] and we also had a session for questions
[19:15] and answers
[19:19] and you know some of the questions and
[19:21] answers are very very tricky certain
[19:24] questions
[19:27] okay one asked me if
[19:30] a brother beat his wife
[19:36] uh is he gonna divorce ask her if i
[19:39] divorce it
[19:41] i did not have anything in mind imagine
[19:43] a very end upon but i just gave them the
[19:46] answer
[19:49] marriage is for good and worse
[19:54] so if you get beaten a sea of kappa ah
[19:57] pray the lord so that he can't stop
[20:01] but you cannot divorce because of that
[20:04] divorce
[20:08] the word doesn't give you permission to
[20:10] marry another one anyway
[20:14] but you know in the meetings like that
[20:18] with people coming from different places
[20:28] we were very very cautious
[20:31] when we collected all the questions
[20:36] the one i could find answers directly
[20:39] from the message
[20:42] director
[20:43] i would give them the answer from there
[20:52] [Music]
[20:55] to consult
[20:57] the head deacon and
[20:59] ministers the pastors from
[21:06] just to avoid giving my own opinion and
[21:09] stuff
[21:11] is opinion personnel and create some
[21:14] trouble among the believers
[21:18] which uh
[21:19] we are not allowed to do in some
[21:22] papillary affairs issues consola amen
[21:25] so i thank you for your prayers
[21:29] because going to the mission missionary
[21:32] field
[21:34] it's a lot of a lot of challenges
[21:39] i left here on
[21:40] tuesday
[21:43] and i arrived there on wednesday
[21:47] and uh the meetings started
[21:50] thursday morning and afternoon
[21:55] friday morning and
[21:56] afternoon di martin sua and they even
[21:59] requested a special service in addition
[22:06] so i have uh
[22:08] for three days i had six services
[22:13] and uh then i preach on a sunday april
[22:18] after sunday april
[22:21] i was really terribly hit by sickness
[22:28] i did not know what happened
[22:30] [Music]
[22:32] i was so tired
[22:34] and
[22:37] the pastor there did not know what to
[22:39] say what to do
[22:42] and in the meantime here my wife also
[22:45] was very very sick
[22:47] my family was she tripped him
[22:49] and she could tell from my voice and i
[22:52] could tell from her voice
[22:57] i think that would be due to an
[23:00] accumulation of fatigue i see
[23:03] an accumulation of fatigue i was so
[23:06] tired
[23:08] but i believe because of your prayers
[23:12] even if you did not know what was going
[23:14] on
[23:17] i was sick monday
[23:18] tuesday
[23:20] my life
[23:22] and uh on the next wednesday i was
[23:25] supposed to preach
[23:26] this song
[23:29] i did not know what to do
[23:32] but uh somebody told me i can't get
[23:34] maddie you know with the work you have
[23:36] done avec travis
[23:38] satan
[23:39] uh feels a little bit attacked uh he was
[23:42] really attacked
[23:46] okay so here to react hello
[24:03] and friday they had a watch service all
[24:06] night
[24:09] [Music]
[24:10] and i preached
[24:12] and i finished on last sunday
[24:16] and i want to thank you for your prayers
[24:19] and uh keep this in mind regardless as
[24:22] the prophet said come the prophet you
[24:25] preach on sunday you practically
[24:26] demonstrate all the demons that you are
[24:28] casting out to let the monkey was it on
[24:30] trending they will be turned loose
[24:32] against you you say only be
[24:34] controversial sometimes the preacher
[24:35] they don't have a nice sleep after
[24:37] sunday service on monday
[24:44] because all those spirits being cast
[24:46] asking this is speaking onto this
[24:47] chassis they turn against you
[24:51] and uh something we need to know
[24:56] so therefore i think really i need a big
[24:59] rest
[25:03] and i'm going to take some days of rest
[25:08] and uh the services the meeting i have
[25:12] i was invited again
[25:17] dedication in congo
[25:20] i have just
[25:22] cancelled that
[25:23] meeting
[25:25] i could not make it
[25:27] super measured
[25:29] and i think i will take some uh time off
[25:34] and uh on my way back
[25:38] i lost all my luggage
[25:42] but i thank god they brought them
[25:44] yesterday morning
[25:51] but i believe god is on our side to give
[25:54] us the victories
[25:58] amen and
[25:59] people have requested
[26:02] the same repetition of
[26:04] special meetings like that
[26:11] even from people who came here memphis
[26:14] uh we want to see how the lord will
[26:17] guide marion
[26:20] if it is something that will uh
[26:23] bring us closer to god all the time
[26:28] knowing the time is at the end
[26:33] we will try to do even on a small scale
[26:36] etc
[26:40] amen amen so we want also to thank our
[26:44] brother richard for bringing the word
[26:46] all these services
[26:55] and i think god was wonderful
[27:00] and we will continue with the same
[27:04] series

[27:16] on the book of ruth
[27:18] yes

[27:23] decision i believe yes
[27:28] and uh we want god to
[27:31] take
[27:32] his leadership to see until he will uh
[27:36] be satisfied on what he want to deliver
[27:43] and uh i want also to
[27:46] rest

[40:33] but he likes uh to guide
[40:46] without any further delay we are in the
[40:48] book of ruth yeah

[57:01] in the decision she had to make a
[57:02] decision that's the end this that's
[57:04] first
[57:05] in foreign
[57:10] after she got there the next thing she
[57:12] had to do

[59:02] baptism of the holy
[59:16] there
[59:27] sanctification level daughters others
[59:30] only bottom the sentence they have the
[59:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[59:36] and others
[59:38] they have adoption affects the
[59:40] difference
[59:42] and with this each level that everyone
[59:48] we are all in the body of christ

[1:01:20] it's not that the one
[1:01:23] he in
[1:01:23] not the son of god
[1:01:26] he is still a son of god
[1:01:28] but he is not mature
[1:01:31] you want under sanctification
[1:01:33] he's still a struggle
[1:01:36] but he's still a summoner

[1:17:21] like paul paul

[1:33:37] go to i'm going to heaven that's true
[1:33:41] but i have a situation that i forgot
[1:33:43] where my bed did uh william branham says
[1:33:45] let's see
[1:33:47] if he said that your heaven is not a
[1:33:49] suspect
[1:33:50] will drop everything over it's just a
[1:33:53] deposit too
[1:33:55] therefore hello come see the person for
[1:33:57] safety come say since he's not assessed
[1:34:00] therefore
[1:34:16] since i've received this message
[1:34:19] i cannot start all over again
[1:34:24] i can start all over
[1:34:26] i'll probably have started
[1:34:30] i just followed somebody that's not yet
[1:34:33] because there are people coming oh no
[1:34:36] i want to believe the message basically
[1:34:38] because i know that one day
[1:34:40] probably i will be married
[1:34:43] if i marry somebody from the message
[1:34:47] it's a people who are always obedient
[1:34:49] she's a certain objective if that's your
[1:34:52] goal retrograde you that's a lie
[1:34:55] foreign
[1:35:06] probably you was born again with long
[1:35:08] skirts long jeep
[1:35:09] long skirts
[1:35:11] exterior when you look at her outside oh
[1:35:14] she has the holy ghost
[1:35:16] but once you marry her
[1:35:20] then you'll be surprised
[1:35:22] objectively because your goals
[1:35:25] it was not to be saved
[1:35:29] but i believe this message excel
[1:35:31] objective one goal separate level is for
[1:35:33] the rapture
[1:35:37] that's why we lose it
[1:35:39] i feel that i can preach
[1:35:46] when ruth took the decision
[1:35:50] she started facing obstacles
[1:35:53] lessons
[1:35:54] obstacles
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:36] of the foundation of the world secular
[1:36:39] which is true i pray and afterwards in a

[1:36:48] our trials to come

[1:51:13] that this consultancy
[1:51:14] going out
[1:51:16] we have decided
[1:51:18] to say for instance
[1:51:20] for our christian life william branagh
[1:51:23] william branham prophetically
[1:51:25] is the prophet that god has sent us
[1:51:29] to preach us the bible
[1:51:32] that everything that
[1:51:47] leave though to not believe the message
[1:51:54] oh we could believe the whole thing
[1:51:58] we don't want to be like scribes and
[1:52:00] pharisees
[1:52:14] they start finding mistakes in jesus
[1:52:16] poorly crucified to crucify crucified
[1:52:19] electricity and they want to crucify him
[1:52:22] and if we accept it
[1:52:25] and if we hear senate papers
[1:52:28] it's not because we didn't know the
[1:52:30] bible before believing the message
[1:52:32] we read the bible

[1:54:15] i accept it as a life or death
[1:54:19] despite of what branham says since i
[1:54:22] have the revelation
[1:54:24] that this bible

[2:24:22] marriage
[2:24:24] because i want you to save me
[2:24:26] or
[2:25:06] as soon as it sees your decisions
[2:25:19] i didn't want to speak on this side just
[2:25:21] take it such a demand to come in and say
[2:25:23] because i know that this requires a
[2:25:25] teacher
[2:25:26] as a minister in the church
[2:25:29] i don't know see how i'm going to say
[2:25:32] teaching is for the pastor
[2:25:36] i tried to
[2:26:01] [Applause]
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:27:15] decision
[2:27:16] if your decision is clear
[2:27:19] if you have already taken the decision
[2:27:20] yesterday
[2:27:23] probably it was just a really low-key
[2:27:26] decision say my time but this morning
[2:27:28] less sentiment
[2:27:44] [Applause]
[2:27:57] he will say
[2:27:59] the message that i have praised
[2:28:02] the places in people's houses
[2:28:04] when god looks at me
[2:28:06] you say like a true way
[2:28:08] with my weakness
[2:28:10] mistakes but
[2:28:24] that is
[2:28:41] [Applause]
[2:28:52] the devil will not resist
[2:28:54] that's what i wanted to tell you this
[2:28:56] morning may god bless you
[2:29:12] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:29:15] let us give that one
[2:29:18] [Applause]
[2:29:23] i believe god has been speaking to you
[2:29:26] brothers
[2:29:27] [Music]
[2:29:32] i don't know how i can express myself
[2:29:37] but very often i look back at uh
[2:29:41] how god is leading things uh
[2:29:44] then i command you to turn the control
[2:29:46] issues all the things that you see
[2:29:49] happening here
[2:29:50] over here
[2:29:52] on our complete sea even messages that
[2:29:55] has been preached here memory massage
[2:29:57] question
[2:30:01] i cannot explain how it's coming
[2:30:07] but i believe god is working measure
[2:30:12] god is doing big work in simplicity
[2:30:30] he did not know the plan i had in my
[2:30:32] heart
[2:30:36] it was just for me to take maybe few
[2:30:39] weeks to rest
[2:30:43] and i'm still thinking to find a place
[2:30:46] to go a little bit out uh
[2:30:50] uh
[2:30:52] but when i heard him preach
[2:30:56] on wednesday le mercedes he did not know
[2:30:59] that it was one of the subjects i have
[2:31:01] been planning to talk about redemption
[2:31:07] redemption initially i said brother you
[2:31:10] take maybe until the following week
[2:31:26] [Music]
[2:31:29] but i felt that for me it was like a god
[2:31:32] leading to that series
[2:31:39] just uh
[2:31:41] move forward
[2:31:45] i don't think that when it's time maybe
[2:31:47] you feel the pressure i heard brother
[2:31:49] richard talking about how he felt about
[2:31:52] bringing the word
[2:32:10] but i believe god is speaking in
[2:32:14] simplicity measures
[2:32:17] simplicity uh all the preachers that we
[2:32:20] have for a long time we had
[2:32:29] [Music]
[2:32:34] there is something that god is preparing
[2:32:40] so we need to
[2:32:43] take the word of god
[2:32:59] because night will start in pascal and
[2:33:02] where nobody will be able to work
[2:33:07] i remember one time i was preaching on
[2:33:09] the book of roots
[2:33:15] was working with humility rude
[2:33:21] and let us do the work of god with a lot
[2:33:24] of humility there's only travis did you
[2:33:26] have a boku dhimi thing in order for it
[2:33:29] to get to the reward i think
[2:33:32] attend the recompense it's a humble work
[2:33:35] scent
[2:33:36] humility the dirty work and convey son
[2:33:40] but i feel like i don't know what to say
[2:33:45] try to do the work that everybody is
[2:33:48] despising
[2:33:50] i say different travail
[2:33:52] me please but you do that type of work
[2:33:54] with god revelation
[2:33:59] this is where the secret of the big
[2:34:02] reward is
[2:34:05] so i want to exhort each one of you this
[2:34:08] morning
[2:34:10] there is a lot of work that needs to be
[2:34:12] done
[2:34:14] we need a lot of hoots here
[2:34:20] we
[2:34:21] find a job to do with humility
[2:34:28] and do it with humility
[2:34:32] god is going to certainly lift you up
[2:34:36] and this is where the church is slacking
[2:34:42] because we don't want we don't have that
[2:34:45] love to serve god anymore
[2:34:50] maybe the simple thing that's supposed
[2:34:52] to be done
[2:34:56] you always push yourself out
[2:35:00] and i want somebody to do
[2:35:03] it
[2:35:04] what about you
[2:35:06] what's the portion of the work god has
[2:35:09] called you to do sequoia
[2:35:19] that was the characteristic of roots
[2:35:21] cellar lucas they stick the root that
[2:35:24] should be the characteristic of the
[2:35:25] church
[2:35:28] it's not the church it's a building
[2:35:30] glistening but you as individuals
