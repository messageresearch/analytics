Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen may the Lord bless you God bless [Music] you oh we going directly to open the word of God we are going to read in the Book of Leviticus chapter 12 16 ltic Leviticus chapter 16 from 11th verse to the 10th verse we are reading in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] AR AEL amen am Leviticus chapter 16 you it shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and Aaron shall cast lot upon the two goats and one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the escape goat and Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord uh the Lord's Lord fell and offer him for a sign offering but the goat on which the Lord fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to make an atonment with him and to let him go for escapegoat Into the Wilderness amen amen thank you may be seated may the Lord bless you greet your brother and your sister shalom shalom God bless you God bless you I hope you're feeling better you're feeling good amen amen it's always a privilege to be in the presence of the Lord because we don't come in the presence of God and leave empty-handed amen amen the same way you go you leave home you go to work look for money you get work and after you done you get you get back home it's not in vain maybe you are being uh taxed or you are being uh paid by hours and you get paid [Music] and we uh together we saw the quotes that Pastor Gideon read where he said and God pays with a lot of interest and that's the truth when we come to church maybe there's some that they don't understand but the fact that you come to drive to give your offering and all that God is obligated to pay you back and I pray this morning God pays you back amen amen I thank the lord for keeping us alive also like to thank our pastor uh to give us the opportunity to speak to his church when he's not around we thank you we thank him so much we also like to to thank you for coming in the house of God I was meditating upon this scripture you know when the preacher is asked to preach uh he meditating upon a lot of scriptures here and there but but only God knows the needs of his people that is why we like to wait upon the Lord in the prayer to know in the midst of all the scriptures coming what does he want us to say when I was down there and I I heard the song that the song leader uh sang in the beginning of the service I said this is the confirmation of my message amen amen we always have to be under expectation and you the one preaching in another term another word it's your preparation that will make God to anoint the preacher no matter who preaching it all depend of what you are looking for amen amen and this morning I would like to exalt about the scap goat the scap goat says we read in the book in The Book of Leviticus chapter 16 this is the Old Testament that's God speaking to Moses he said to Moses for the atonement of the people let them come and you going to take two goats tellon to take two goats the Two Goats will serve as an an atonement for the people one goat will be killed and they will take the blood of that goat will be uh poured on another goat and the second goat will be the es it will be freed in the wilderness away from the people are you with me while he will be wandering in the wilderness he will be the scapegoat and that will be the Forgiveness of your sins amen amen therefore there's one goat that is considered as a goat of guilt the goat that is guilty that represents sin there's another goat that is AAP goat to make the atonement of the other goats when I tried to compare the version of the Bible [Music] I'm using uh the other version called l in French the one I'm using another version is theames King King James James King James he's talking about the skap goat or the the sending goats the the messenger goats or the scap goats it's the same thing [Music] it's a synonym word it's a Escape it's a goat that has been taken to make the atonment for the sin and we are going to see together the Bible and the prophet and that go scap goat it's nothing less than the Lord Jesus Christ do you love the Lord amen amen amen we know that the go it's a ill Fame animal if you read in the Book of Matthew chapter five this is how Jesus is speaking about the goat is considering the the the goats as a people that don't don't do good they're not Believers Matthew chapter 25 if you can only take verse 32 or 33 listen what the Bible is telling us and before him shall be gaed all nations and listen will it shall separate them one from the other as the shepherd divides his sheep from the goat he shall set the sheep on on his right hands but the goat on the left why the goat on the left because they are lost they are condemed now the Bible is explaining us that God in the end time in the time of judgment them people that don't want to receive Christ [Music] them that have no faith good faith God considers them as goats Sinners God takes them as goat and takes the True Believers and consider them as sheep are you with me therefore a goat it's something that is not good but here we find out God is telling Moses take take two goats and the goats he could say take a Ram or something but he said take the goat why the goat that represent everything that we just saw and why Jesus Christ has to identify himself as a scapegoat oh I really love the prophet he said in reality the Lord Jesus Christ is the more righteous is the holiest person on the earth is the person that never committed any sin that is why when he was on the earth he could tell the Pharisees who will convince me of sin no one therefore Jesus has not to be considered as a goat amen amen he's considered as a perfect he was 100% a man and 100% God but the reason why here is considered as a goat escap goat it's because him being the Lamb of God being the righteous of God to save me and to save you he had to leave that position of he had to leave that perfect position and to become a goat because goat represents when he becomes sin he becomes God hallelujah hallelujah when he become a God then is escap goat the one that at the sin hallelujah hallelujah bham said message living and dying 1959 uh 29th March 29th in the evening he's saying this in the scripture in the Old Testament are the sin offering when they got two and got and Jesus represented both of them and one God was killed and the other was the sin of the nation was placed upon the god called the scarpet god and that God said book had excuse me okay that God it's a book had to go out on the willness and to be out there alone among the best and so Jesus had to be that God I want you to notice he was the lamb he was for but he was made God for you and I that we being got might become shape that we being God may become shap we being sin guilty subject to death and all sof out under the condation yet become me that I taught his grace may become him a son of God sitting at at the right hand of God in glory amen amen amen amen explains he became the the goat why because of the Judgment all the sins of the world had to lay upon him in that time he's no longer now he's considered as a goat to take your place and to take mine amen amen do you understand this I'm other message I will go quickly even if I have a lot to say while I was thinking about these things when I saw how brother was explaining them I said oh wow this message this message is so wonderful in the same message living dying preach April 3rd parag 38 in that uh [Applause] bearing it was represented in the Old Testament whether what they were doing in the Old Testament where go when God ordained to Aaron to take two [Applause] goats it was the preview of for Redemption of the New Testament you know the Old Testament is the shadow of the New Testament that means it was just the shadow but the true reality will happen in the New Testament amen amen the Old Testament that go despite that he was doing the atonment but the sin was not taken away the sin was just covered that's right it was not cleansed taken away it was just covered why because the Old Testament was the shadow he was foring he was just showing later on there will be a reality that will come for the Forgiveness of the sin and the Forgiveness will not be just a cover will be wiped away amen amen that is say here in the Old Testament there was The Bu that represented in the Old Testament they had two they had a sin offering at the cleansing of the sanctuary and that sin offering was that they taken two goat and one goat was killed and the other and the other goat had sin that was placed upon the dead boat put upon the Lov one or the living one do you follow me my young people do you follow sisters you good you're the people that Pastor always ask questions because he knows us better I want to make sure everybody gets it because if you understand this you know the Bible says Jesus was the one saying I praise you father because you have hidden these things to the wise and the prant and Jesus had it and it happens that they can preach and and people don't understand it why it's the devil that makes people not understand because Jesus said because if they understand they will repent and if they repent and God will be obligated to bless them and God the the devil doesn't want you to be blessed that is why when we come to [Music] church we try to understand why God is telling to tell us because that's where the secret of our blessings amen amen therefore in the Old Testament what was happening if you sinned uh the the the Lord uh the Lord acquired the blood for the Forgiveness therefore if I sinned normally I had to give up my own life then how was I going to give my own blood if I was going to die and God said in this case the children of Israel let them come with animals and very specific case he said the worshippers will be represented by Two Goats so the Sinners comes with the books and the goats represent the Sinner and when they were killing theat the animal had to be washed which is the type of the baptism of water are you with me and the worshiper will touch the animal and they will slow the animal that means the animal was making the atonment for you because the blood the law requires the blood Hallelujah then the blood the blood of that animal that kind of the blood that will bring they were they were bringing in the sanctuary and in this case of the goats The Sinner that comes with his goat that represent himself The Sinner they will take the blood of that goat and they take another goat alive are you with me the other goat is not dead but they take the blood of the Dead one and they'll put it on the live one let's go slowly this keep the quat remember Jesus was a sheep he was a lamb but in this case he became a goat he was rightousness because he was God the Sheep but he came a goat he became sin that he might be the sin offering for me and you from a sheep to a goat and Jesus was represented in both the animals do you follow Bram now listen both go for one he died the first one died uh-huh he died for the atonement and the sin from the atonement was put on the second the second one on the scap goat and the skip go took the sins of the people and went far in the wilderness and with the bearing the sins of the people what was it it was the death our Lord Jesus amen amen live dying he saved me mared carrying my sin away he took the sin of the people upon himself Carri them plumed down into the lowest of idas amen amen the two gods of the Old Testament is telling us represented the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah the book The first one the one that was being SL that was the the go of the atonment who was that the Lord Jesus Christ they take the blood of the atonement and they pour it on the living one and they let him going far away and that go become the scap goat which is still the Lord Jesus Christ dying at the cross he takes your sin while he's going down in hell it takes far away your sins it takes your sins far away if you have the Holy Spirit you can say I'm holy because of this hallelujah hallelujah somebody has to be encourage this morning said you see he went far away he carried our sin far away as far as God cannot even see it said think about it think of it oh Hallelujah the church could scream Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the church could scream Hallelujah for such a savior our sin are just not forgiven but all also buried in the sea of forgetfulness Hallelujah to be not to be remembered in the the mind of God oh bless the Savior Jesus Christ I don't know why I can give it to you our sin are not just forgiven but it cannot even be remembered even in the mind of [Music] Jesus continues buried he carried our sins away no more can they be remembered for they are gone they out of the sight of they out of the eyes of God they are paralyzed they are divorced they are put [Applause] away God don't remember them no more amen the church had to Rejoice this morning Amen to know he will never remember our sins hallelujah hallelujah they put SE of forgiveness in the grave Beyond any Resurrection they are dead forever and forgotten listen the sins they are like if they've never happened that's what justification does when God justify you other will see in you a lot of sins we know this one but now listen if he a Son of God keep on criticizing him for God is as if he's never done it amen amen continues dying saved me carried my sin far away he carried them so far till they went into the sea of forg oh we know that those things are most surely [Music] true and the most surely the truth said these things are the truth of God all those great things were Beyond human Expressions amen amen that produ forg forg that's the reason why beloved if you see in your life you still a liar today you repent tomorrow it comes back today you li ask yourself that [Music] question have you really received the scapegoat is Jesus a scap goat for you because if it's a scap goat he will deliver you there's nothing that will be in your life without God deliver now there's a theory of Seventh Day Adventist with the leader Dr Smith he misinterpreted the Bible say if there's an Adventist here for me I'm not here to speak evil against that man [Music] but I just want to express what I feel or what I believe the doctor John Smith he's teaching people that the goat of the atonement he said the goat that goat was the Lord Jesus and the escapegoat is the devil because he's going in the wilderness and Dr John Smith is saying according to his understanding said that's the devil the devil that's a mistake I thank the prophet some of us here we don't even know the Bible this Bible even people going in the Seminary they're trying to to place calendar in the Bible but but it happens when they don't even get to understand what it means by calendar but the Bible itself says God does not do anything before revealing his secret to his servant the prophet that means the Bible it's the Great Wilderness of forest or if you don't know the forest you can be lost it takes the guide who's used to live in the forest jungle and the prophet is the guide that is used with the atmosphere of God he's the one that interpret what God said said in this message question answer number one 23rd uh August 64 it says this or paragra paragraph 105 Prophet says no more than Dr Smith on the Seventh Day Adventist on the sacrifice goats he said one goat that was uh there was they killed one two goats on the day of sacrifice the day of the atonement one goat was killed and the other were turned loose and then and then he said the God that was killed represented Jesus our sin Bearer you [Music] see that died but the goat that was turned loose represented the devil that bears our sins and goes away into eternity with when you don't have the prophet you won't understand this Bible amen amen for him he said the the the God that was turn loose in the wilderness it's the devil that went away with our sins if the devil is running away with our sins that means we don't have forgiveness are we are you with me joh Smith for the do John Smith he said and the sacrifice represented Jesus and the scapat represented the devil say no you see you see to my opinion if this ever gets back to Adventist brother I'm not saying nothing about this that great man Dr Smith we are not here to criticize men of no matter who he is Catholic or not we are not against them people we are just against the spirit after them am amen say say the same thing here he was he was a smart Christian a intelligent fine culture man believer but you see to [Music] me it doesn't make sense when you do that you are sacrificing to the devil amen you see for the prophet prophet he said they both represented CHR burial and the resurrection of Christ am amen the B God in the oldest represented death resurrection of Christ Contin say he also died for our sins and carried our sins far away both of them was Christ we see Christ in the Old Testament we see Christ in the New Testament both of them New and Old Testament speak of the same God that is why say Jehovah of the Old Testament Jehovah Jesus in the New Testament it's just the god that changes his form he doesn't change his ways Hallelujah may his name be blessed our scapegoat it's the Lord Jesus Christ is the one who died for my sin is's the one who died for your sin now you know the sin it's unbelief and you see the devil with that there's a lot of things attached to the curse is attached to sin is it true C if they can there's a curse it's because of sin if we can say there's sickness it's because of sin if we can say there's a poverty it's because of sin but the scapegoat when he comes he swall all that to free you he goes into the Wilderness it's to give you Victory Deliverance amen amen oh may his name be blessed now listen in them time in the Old Testament the goat the attonement that that was done that couldn't take away the sin look what men were capable of doing back then I'm in this message God is hiding and reveal himself in Simplicity he said paragraph uh 41 said Moses under the blood of bulls and goat with his confession in the word of God and God could take that simple man and put his word in his mouth I want the church to understand this and God had to take his own word put it to put it in a mortal being like you and I in them days where the cleansing of sin were done with bulls and goats then Pro he had proven that he was the servant of Jehovah for he could walk there and Je spoke to him by vision and he walked out there and stretch his hands toward the east and stretch his button his Ro toward the East and he said now remember God spoke to him God that's God's thoughts God uses man God spoke to him it's right he said go straight that road in your hands toward the east and say flies and mes under the blood of the sheep walked out there and took that stick reached toward the East and said thus say the Lord let be flies while Moses was speaking they never heard any fly now listen is taking us somewhere to lift up our faith so that you understand that you're not just anybody and he said the Lord Let There Be flies never heard a fly Moses pronounced the word he said he take his stick he look to the east say the Lord let it be flies the next minute not even a mosquito not even a fly you think when he said that got Den act now listen when he pronounced the word Moses left he was sure about who he was and then he said and he left it's already spoken it's already been spoken for Moses it's done deal but for the people nothing happening they pray for me I don't see anything hallelujah hallelujah I forgot to tell the pastor this dream I'm expecting I'm hallelujah hallelujah amen amen Moses left and then he said spoke it's a thought now that it's been spoken it's expressed now it's the word of God it came into a human lips a simp for man under the blood of the b or goat and then first thing you know a green begin a green fly begin to fly around the next thing you know there were 5 pounds perod what was it was the word of God spoken through Moses am amen the Creator I'm just responsible of repeating what the word says therefore under the blood the blood of the goats don't forget the blood of the goat doesn't wipe away our sins just covering our sins wiping away means when you see here I'm writing you know you see all this in the Old Testament our Prophet says the blood of the goats or the BS God will just cover but with the blood of the man Jesus when he comes he wipes [Applause] away there's nothing left when a sin is confessed for God it's as if you've never done in the first place and then if there sin coming back to your memory there's two things it's either you never repented according to the word said if a Believer does not repent according to the word the devil has the legal right to stay there but if you fix it according to the word and you see and it's still coming back to your memory and it's the Devil with the spirit of the it's trying to weak you to remind you you will never be saved you see with what You' have done despite your repentance brother it's done for you that's the devil your scapegoat went away with your sin in the wilderness Hallelujah Moes under the blood that was not whing away but he was able Moses was a man human being like you and I amen amen but he pronounced the word and the thing Contin saying oh he said under the blood was standing in the presence of God and his own word wasn't his this word under the blood of a goat but Moses knowing his position who knows his position here as long as you will not know your position the devil will mess up with you it will come time by time telling you nothing but let me tell you this morning but you worth more than great I always said the Lord Jesus Christ between the blood of Jesus and you who who's worth the most you you you helping mej amen you helping me preach yes you are the you one worth the most because if you you're hungry you want to eat bread and you have $50 between the $50 bill and the the the bread where do you need the most even if you have $50 bill the the the $50 bill of purchasing power but but the most valuable thing for you to break is that the truth you have more value let let not the dev lie to you Hallelujah you are the the Bride of God you are the Bride of the Lord Jesus he shed his blood when he's shedding his blood because he found out that you w the most amen amen hallelujah hallelujah says Moses under the blood he pronounced the word [Music] continues paragraph 415 in the same message if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be given to you willham [Applause] says where is the church standing it for Moses he said Let It Be frog F and there wasn't there wasn't any frog in the country when he said let Let It Be frogs there were no frog everywhere upon the word of the human being as Moses under the blood of the goat and the when he pronounced the word there were frogs everywhere about an hour there were 10 Deep what was it it was God the Creator hiding himself in a simple man now I want to ask you something are you ready if the blood of the BS and the goats be used as a bleach which can only cover [Music] [Applause] could put a man in a position to speak the creative word of God to bring flies into existence why would you [Music] stumble at the blood the bleach of the Jesus Christ blood could speak a squirel and something into the existence hallelujah hallelujah if Moses under the blood of the he said Let It Be frogs and there were a bunch of frogs everywhere why people are stumbling with the blood of Jesus Christ because God is capable of creating squirrel the blood of Jesus to create squirrel or something else the blood of Jesus could through the blood a mortal being was capable to give eternal life to another mortal hallelujah hallelujah why people will doubt and that that will stumble people oh let

that he still remains God oh my pardon of sins oh I wish I could Mark 11 the Bible says if you say to this mountain be thou removed and doubt in your heart the Bible doesn't say if God doesn't doubt but if you say yourself yourself what you said what you said you don't doubt about what you said amen you will see that fulfilled now listen deare declare again somebody was already being healed he

goat took away that trouble you can be free you can you can say glory to God because the mighty conqu [Applause] overcame sickness all that the the mighty conquer hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah now listen said men what hindering them to see the glory of God is that they expecting great Mysteries said God is hiding himself and reveals in Simplicity said I will probably close by here there was somewhere they took a young boy and he he was taken in the SL y he was taken in slavery when he was taken in slavery that man that little young man he was lifted up it was raised in a Christian family oh we used to say it happens to me sometime some of you that born in the message your father and mother in the message you are born in the message sometime you don't understand the importance of the message but let me tell you here let me take your defense that little [Music] boy he was born of the parent in the message his father and mother gave their life to Jesus Christ and the mother was teaching to the child the mother was teaching him Bible stoies there was one scripture she loved to read that was Isaiah Isaiah 53 and the the child that led a foundation in that child is to encourage you when you have your child speak to them about God because even if you think they don't understand it it's the word of God it's not your word the word that you keep repeating to your child let me tell you that the same word that created the world even if the child seems to be stubborn stubborn job just repeat it is written the Bible says hallelujah hallelujah and one day that word will create something in him in this message the the pardon says and one day I was told this a certain story that really helped me me too that really helped me a lot you know this message is in such a way that even if you read a scripture it's been a while and you read it again I don't know what happens with God it's it's like the day you're reading it you have the impression that you never read it before why because the word of God is God will never fail the holy scriptures always have life and that really helped me and I believe that will help you too and beginning of my first days a boy was taken away all of you had taken Bible stories history and taken the history of the church I believe it was the fox it wasn't it was the N fathers stri or the life of St Patrick St patri or St Patrick that was just a man the name given to him his name was suat he was kidnapped by a bunch of sea Rovers and was hired out as a o Razer and this story goes that this k was kidnapped and taken aboard on the ship and he was working his way amen amen he was working his way in the boat where he was taken while he was working as a slave one day the old Captain the the the captain he fell sick when he fell sick he was about to die and then he said what am I going to do here way far in the sea maybe I don't know there's no physician around here but he realized that he was about to get to die when he realized that he called all the the crew all two members come here come here they came along he said listen up I'm dying maybe in a few minutes in a few seconds I will certainly die but now I need the word of God beloved maybe for you the fact that you just came to church you feel like it's very annoying the fact that you you listening the word you feel you you feel like it's very annoying the pastor may ask you to do something I'm busy I got a lot of things to do oh brother the day you get you get close to death that's where you will realize if I really had time it will be late then but while we have time let's work for the glory of God while you have the Breath of Life young Brothers young sisters the Bible says rejoice in your youth enjoy whatever you feel like is comfortable but knowing the end of it God will hold you responsible while we have the Breath of Life that work for the master if we have to do something for God let us do it correctly or don't do it at all amen amen if I have to play music I have to consecrate myself in such a way that when I play I know the anointing and that can heal somebody hallelujah hallelujah if I have to preach if I have to stay on night the let me do it for the glory of God if I have to do whatsoever let me do it with all my heart the captain was dying he stood there oh I need God don't seek God then when you're about to die this morning seek him when he's still around if you know he's not in your heart if you know your dad and your mother has God in him and you don't have God in you can save you oh the the old man said nobody anybody anybody that can have a bible let him come I I just want him to read something for me oh it's it's amazing to see men always seek God when they are cornered somewhere maybe sickness is being cornered by Si now you see somebody becom he wants to fix his life becoming more serious maybe you're about to die close to death and you see somebody you start realizing I I I play somebody out there I did see say this and then he start calling that can be late now while God is speaking to you it's the opportunity for you to fix let somebody say Amen while the captain was dying he started looking for God I don't want to die like this because if you want to die you will know where you going even if you come to church every day that will save you the day you will die before you cross you will know and you will realize what they're preaching use the truth while now you are thinking they always say that it's always like this and the the captain ACC calling his crew member and the crew member didn't have the Bible and they said we don't have the Bible Captain then and the young boy there that was kidnapped while he was kidnapped he had his Bible

Captain said call him up and they call him when they called the young man and the old Captain told him I just need I just want you to read what just open uh whatever your heart will lead you you to
