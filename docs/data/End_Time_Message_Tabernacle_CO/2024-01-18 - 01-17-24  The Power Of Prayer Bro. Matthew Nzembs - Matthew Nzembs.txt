didn't come here to to hear from a man they came here to hear something from you bless also our pastor where he is give him some good [Music] time and then the step of the righteousness of Guided by the Lord may you guide him as we ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior and Lord amen amen we can go straight to the word of God Luke take Luke chap 11 verse 5 until 10 Luke 11 5-10 let's read and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine in this journey is come to me and I have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give Thee I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his opportunity it will rise and give him as many as needed and I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that ask receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knowth it shall be open Lord Our God once again we thank you for the opportunity given to us to read your word and to keep that as well help us now Lord we just want to listen to those those words and forget after hearing those words that's not going to help us but you open open our spiritual understanding may you give us wisdom so that we can keep those things we know there's no more time left that's why we want to get near to your word as you said to your disciple you tell them to watch and pray because you don't know when the master will appear when the time will be or when the the angel will appear nobody knows when the Master of the House will come that's the reason why you ask us to watch and pray father that's what the disciples said one day teach us how to pray as John taught his disciple how to pray and you taught them how to pray andam ask we don't have to pray like pagans just repeat words ask us when you go praying will we addressing our prayer to and that he is able to answer your children came to your house tonight you know what they need tonight may you give them according to the heart desire you circumcise the mouth that will be talking and the hear the the the hearings that will be hearing and I ask with faith angel of God descend may they take this service under the control and I cast away all distractions in the name of Jesus Christ may that be amen amen may God bless you tonight I thank the pastor for the opportunity uh the pastor called me the day before and he asked me if I can bring the word of God tonight even though I'm a little bit weak in my body but for the service of our Master even during tough time even when we sick we always going to serve him amen the Apostle Paul said nothing can take us away from the love of God he say even famine sickness death nothing shall separate me from the love of God are you have to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen and tonight I just want to share with you a little subject and I want to title that the power of prayer we are in a time where we need prayer than ever before dece during the month of December I was coming from work and when I reach home and something told me you have to pray I was uh you know getting something ready to eat and there's a voice inside of me say you need to pray and that voice told me take three days of prayers as I was fixing something to eat and I told myself I'm already cooking something to to bring to uh to work tomorrow morning and I there's a voice inside of me say you need to stop praying tomorrow and I just say you know let me obey to the voice inside of me and I told myself I'm going to go three days of prayer without you know eating so fasting I'm just going to you know just eat just something small at night you know every single time when there's a little voice inside of you that talk to you pay attention to it and I told myself since the voice talked to me I'm really going to pray as old time I remember back a day back in the mom was bringing us to church we didn't have any bed and we didn't have any pillow we were just spending nights in the pews of the Church we've done those things you know for five years and I just told myself I'm going to do it as I was doing before I remember the first day God talked to me about something I asked him and he even gave to me with a sign and the second day of prayer God also answered me on something I ask him and he gave me also another sign and the third day I told myself since God answered me now I can just eat as usual and I know that God already answered and after five days there's no snow there I just little bit like a little bit of snow and I was supposed to go to work early at 5:00 a.m. I almost reach uh my workplace like from nowhere and then my car started to you know go you know like back andth and then there's a track that was just next to me and in front of me there's a car that was there and my car was going back and forth and I couldn't control it and I was uh driving 35 miles an hour but the way my car was taking me it's like I was driving above 65 jesuses and I started screaming Jesus J and my car just suddenly and I told myself oh Lord what's going on and three days before that there's a guy at work that really uh you know attacked me he was insulting me I was saying Lord what's going on with me and the first January 1 as we had prayer here after the 3rd of January uh you know I got sick three days I was just sleeping I wasn't eating I was forcing myself you know trying to eat something I couldn't eat anything I was only sleeping I asked myself Lord what's going on with me is it a time for me to go or what's going on if there's something you want me to do just tell tell me brother John is here he's there I even share a few things with him and few days the pastor I didn't want to talk to anybody you know outside of people where I live and when the pastor called called me he told him uh he told me that someone told me told him that he was I was sick said yes Pastor I was very sick almost three days but I'm feeling better now I just bought some medication and I'm going to be taking it and the pastors told me that don't take it now if you want to take medication you have to wait at least a night and I already know that God has healed you and then I say amen I went home and I just put the medication on the table I said I'm not going to touch it if I want to go I will go why am I sharing in this with you don't try to look God only when things are not going well for you and don't just wait to pray when things are not going right you have to pray even though you're in good health amen even though good things are going well with you you just have to pray brother said you can do much you can do you can sing a lot you can preach a lot you can read a lot but says something that you will never do enough a lot is prayer you won't be able to pray a lot and to also pray you also need to persevere because if you don't persevere you're going to pray like [Music] pagans they pray and they're just waiting for the right then and our God doesn't do things that way that's why in Luke chapter 11 where we read remember I'm going to talk about the power of prayer just give me your divided attention for a few minutes Luke 115 where we read that was a parable that Jesus talked to his disciple he told them again if someone has a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend L me three laws for a friend of mine in his journey to and I have nothing to set before him vers s the Bible says and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee but Jesus say I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his opportunity he will rise and give him as many as needed and I say unto you ask and it shall be given to you seek you shall find look and it shall be open unto you for everyone that ask receive and he that Seth find and to him that knth it shall be open Luke 18 Jesus Christ talk about another Parable saying the same kind of ideas Jesus Christ told them this parable to show them that you always need to pray and you cannot cease to pray remember that guy that went to ask for three loaves of bread he knocked two or three times they didn't open the door he knocked for the third the the third time and they didn't open the door and Jesus say It was in the middle of the night when he came he insisted and knocked on the door and his friend said what are you looking for don't you know I'm already in bed with my children he say I have a friend that came from uh can you can you can you give me three loaves of bread he say it's impossible this is midnight maybe can say you don't have respect why can't you come that L I'm already here with my wife and children and that friend was still importuna him and insisting and 18 Luke 182 Jesus saying there was in the city a judge which fear not God neither regarded [Music] man and there was a widow in that City she came him saying avenge me of my adversary and Jesus said that for many many years he refused and he talked to himself even though I fear not God no regard any man yet because this Widow troubled me listen very carefully Jesus said this Widow was coming every single day and she was traveling the judge and Jesus said the judge said to himself although I fear not God no regard man yet because this Widow trouble me I will avenge her unless by a continual coming she worried me and the Lord said he what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect which C day and night him that means that it's not something that you just do for one for a few days and it's something that you continuously do you come in the morning you come in the evening you pray for the same thing in other words Jesus Christ it's not something that will be given to you at the same time you ask he also uh requires PA or perseverance and shall not guard avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he faith on the [Music] earth just to say that prayer works with faith if you don't have faith you won't be able to receive the thing that you're asking for Luke Chapter 20 uh 22 verse 31st listen to something good that Jesus Christ is saying here Luke [Music] 22 verse 31st and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you but I prayed for the thy faith fail not and when thou are converted strengthen thy bre amen just to say even though you believe to this message even though you live in the pastor's house even though you were daughter or son of a servant of God you're not uh uh you're not under the protection of the devil you always come after you he's trying to uh to do something but the only thing you can do is to go to prayer that's what Jesus told Peter I pray I pray for [Music] you amen verse 33 and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell the Peter the shall not cwl this [Music] day before that thou sh twice deny that th me verse 35 and he said unto them when I sent you without purse and SCP and shoes like anything and they said nothing Jesus was talking to his disciple and he told them now he that has a purse let him take it and likewise his strip and he that has no and he that has no sword let him sell His Garment and buy one I just want you to pay attention here can you listen very carefully while they were with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ never asked them for anything while Jesus was going toward the end of his journey he said I never ask you to bring something but now is the time to G up if someone doesn't have K sword let it even sell his so that he can buy a sword listen carefully now I say to you that this that is written must you be accomplished in me and it was reckon among the [Music] transgressors for the thing concerning me have an end and they say Lo behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough they presented two sword to Jesus chist and Jesus Christ answered them said it is enough and brother said the sword represent the word of God and here when they presented two swords and Jesus Christ told them that that that was enough in other words and some people said that reading the the the U the quotes [Music] or reading the quotes I think it's really uh I'm very tired of it when I read the Bible I feel good but that doesn't have to work that way we need both the Bible and we also need the Cod from the prophet but if you don't have those and you only have the Bible with you won't be able to understand what Jesus Christ was talking about because Jesus Christ was talking in Parable even the disciple couldn't understand him some people say no I don't like to pray a lot I just like to pray for five minutes I don't want to multip many words but also say if you also see a Christian that praying enough that means that it doesn't read enough because if you read enough you'll be able to say things to PR you don't have to pray like Pharisees didn't say that say in the mark of the beast paragraph 138 he said Jesus Christ was talking to his disciples don't be like pagans they always multiply words in the prayers now brother says how do they do when they pray they come with little words that were taught to them in and brother says I I salute you maryy you you listen to those prayers he said full of grace and blessed are thou he said that's not prayer says he said don't be like hiddens using V repetition he say I H Mary say how Father in Heaven that's not prayer said he said and I am a member of a church I'm going to a certain Church they taught me how to pray since I was a child in the Catholic but you find the Christian that cannot spend one hour in prayer listen to what the prophet says I am a Protestant yes sir I am member of this church yes sir and on Sunday it's only if you respect it uh if you respect to go in when it's raining outside he say yeah instead of going to prayer meetings you closing the church and you're sitting in your home watching TV and they go and they drink and they do many kind of things and they're behaving like other people in the world while they are members of church remember that's the mark of sin a Christian that only comes to church Su when when it's when they say let me just stay at home let me just listen to those at home let me just do this at home what says that's the mark of sin say if I am a Christian I go to a city and I find that they don't have a says I will go somewhere where to preach the word of God I will listen to the word of God I will say Amen to what I can say say that a Christian cannot be home I really uh in my life when I when I I even though I'm sick I always go to church if I'm not at church I probably somewhere traveling you can ask the when I'm very sick I ask to stay in the back I don't have any interest to stay at home but the Bible said those who are coming they have to believe that God is reward for those who are seeking him it's just because the Christian don't understand who is their God let me go here a little bit here further and Jesus asked them to find two and in other words God told them to love the word but said the word of God we we have Victory against the devil everywhere any circum in any other circumstances the word of God will have victory over the devil the Bible says after they went and he came out and went as he was to the Mount of Olives even Jesus Christ was spending more time in the mountain to pray he said to the Mount of Olives and his disciple also followed him yes verse 40 and when he was at that place he said unto them pray that you enter not into temptation Jesus asking his disciple to pray how about you and me he said pray that you enter not into temptation amen and he was withdraw from them about a stonecast and kneel down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will by be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven to strengthen him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as he were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he prayed and when he rose up from prayer and came to his disciples he found them sleeping from sorrow listen 46 and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray L you enter into temptation and while he SP behold the multitude and he that was called Judas one of the 12 went before them and Drew near Jesus to kiss him listen if you read in other uh book of the Bible even in Matthew Jesus Christ when he was getting near to his [Music] journey he took Peter and two other disciples they went to the mountain and Jesus Christ praying and when he came back find all of them sleeping and Jesus told you couldn't even pray with me one hour you already tired and Jesus Christ told said not even one hour and you already tired You Soldiers of Jesus of God the soldier of God are not like soldier of the world and listen brother says something about [Music] prayer question answer one 165 say [Music] yes you have to accept the person of Jesus Christ and this other things they will just adjust perfectly every member of this body this morning let this little group of people if we could pull the curtain if you could pull the curtains down along on each [Music] side and every person here receive the person of Jesus there would never be there will never be no just be a perfect love [Music] yet you still believe this and believe that but it just be so full of love you just see now Jesus said by the fruit you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness now my estimation of what I think say I'm going to present you my [Music] estimation of what I think that the is thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian listen very carefully what I think that the closest things to in evidence that a man is a Christian that anything that you know you know what it is it's travel of [Music] soul a person that's always so hungry and thirsting for God they just simply day and night for them they they just can't stand it they got to do something for God they're full of love and they just and they're just just traveling traveling all the time the Bible says he that goes forth amen will doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him precious sh is that right all those things now listen if this church if I said this morning in this little group of people of this group of people tonight and God will say now look William Bram I'm going to make you answer for the group of people what you tell them now do you want them all to shout now listen to what says bam says I will do you want them all to uh to speak with Tong I want every one of them to do you want them all to dance in the spirit I want everyone of them all right well that's very good but what will rather have them to do what would you rather have them to do ah huh I'd rather have a church I'd rather have a church that has such a burden on their hearts for prayer that they just stay at the alt and will be here day and night say if God what would you rather have for your church do you do you want people in your church to shout prefer them to shout do you want them to dance in spirit said I would love them to dance in spirit do you want them to prophesy I will prefer that among all those things you ready have the church to do says the things that I would love my church to do is to pray a lot they come to the altar day at night spending time in prayer said that's what I prefer for my church brother prefer that we prefer that as well and said I want them to be humble and trying to get people to God to come to God and making calls at the hospital and visiting the and visiting the sick and trying to get people to come to church and do right have done all the other put together although the other is right it belongs in the church but among all of them the prophet prer prayer is to see people going to prayer that's what I prefer the most Mark 11 Mark Chapter 14 verse 26 listen what the Bible says after singing song they went to the Mount olives and Jesus told them you will be [Music] Mark Mark Mark 14 sorry Jesus Christ answered them you will be because is it written I will Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and after I will be Resurrected I will go before you into Galilee and Peter told them although all shall be offended yet will not I 32 you know the story and they came to a place which was named G and he said to his disciples here while I shall pray and take with me Peter and James [Music] and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy say unto them my soul is exceeding s unto death T here and watch look to what Jesus Christ is talking to his disciple te you here and watch watch what does it mean you're actually watching over someone will say watching so that something bad won happen that Jesus Christ told to disciple he said watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he say AB father all thing are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what thou will and he cometh in front of his disciples and find them sleeping and said unto Peter Simon sleepest thou now that watch one hour he was already tired this is the kind of Christian today you come to church you even forget the purpose for which you come to church when they say just stand up and let's pray you see a Christian with that position sleeping snoring are you a soldier you are not a soldier a real Soldier even though he has many things going on he always watch so that he won't be sleeping amen Jesus Christ told him that you couldn't even watch one hour with me and you already sleeping you found a Christian many years in the message he doesn't know that to pray you have to stand up he doesn't know to to pray you probably kneel down you have to kneel down it's like a soldier he's a soldier to go to war and you see he's actually wearing a a police a policeman is not a soldier a policeman if you send him to war he probably won't handle it but a soldier is good different even though it's very sunny he always pray God so that God will protect him there a real Soldier someone who's a disciple of Jesus Christ a soldier even though it hurts he say I'm still going to go forward amen a soldier even though it's paining it's even though it's very hard for him to to wear all those he is still a sold he's still going to go forward even though it's heavy on him when you look at him he's very tired but inside of him he always encourag himself he encouraged himself he encourag himself that's what a so is when I go to church I know this is a this is a PO this is someone like that a soldier you cannot teach him how to pray a real Soldier knows who he is a real Soldier he knows if I'm I cannot wear stuff like anybody else or someone who just recruit you won't find a general with a big a real so he said I have to know how to wear my my clothes until here a soldier with a tight what kind of soldier are you a real to present myself in front of God I have to close properly a soldier with a Min SC and you know they're going to find something to cover you are not a soldier you are not called to go to the a soldier you find a soldier with nails what kind of soldier are you tonight I'm just speaking to soldiers if you are not a soldier don't put yourself in that category a soldier with namil what kind of soldiers are you are you an animal or a soldier says there's a person someone will let his nails grow in the Bible when he was with a spirit of animal say he he said that was Nebuchadnezzar he left where God put him he didn't have a place of God and said that he now so his hair grew so long he was a soldier before how would you overcome the devil say he went to the restaurant one day eat and he found woman I said I don't like to eat those kind of that kind of place I went to the am he said like a woman with long nails is like eagles he said especially those one who pain those nails with he say you know when eag he said that those nail almost red the children are are crying because of soers sometime you see a soldier coming to so that so that his marriage can be blessed by his laugh like uh black m and a soldier in the message because you don't have prayer life that's why PR say what we need today is to bring back prayer in our homes he said a real family it's a family that pray together mother is there on the table father on the table children on the table they all praying together that's why brother said don't forget PR God want to meet you there family prayer restore alar you Reed the message of restoration if you don't believe that this message is a message of restoration I have a good news for you tonight the message ofam the message of restoration it will change your life it will change the in man amen this message has the power of transformation why we need bring back life to become soldiers amen sometime said Jesus Sanctified why did he sanctify himself it was because of you Jesus Christ could get married he didn't get married because of you a priest is someone who sacrifice himself for others amen he's a human being like anybody else but God built him differently a soldier amen sometime he really hurts you see the the level of a big man a long long time in you see a disciple no they really there down and the level doesn't really reflect a soldier oh Lord Jesus where B say that's why

verse 38 say Watch and Pray L you enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready oh wow wow but the flesh is weak but the flesh is weak amen proud won't take us anywhere put it in your mind that that's why Jesus was teaching his disciples to pray I'm just watching the time verse 39 and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words and returned and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither was there what to answer him and he comes the third time and said unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is coming behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go L he that betrayed me is a hand toward the end of the Journey of Jesus he was teaching his disciple to pray he said the flesh is weak yes the spirit is is ready but the spirit needs prayer you need sometimes people don't know that the prayer that you do today or you make today that's you spend maybe two or three hours what maybe during tough time when
