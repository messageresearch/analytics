[5:35] our lord and savior amen amen
[5:40] may the lord bless you once again
[5:45] thank you pastor for the opportunity
[5:48] by the grace of god news alone
[6:05] you know yesterday i was talking to a
[6:06] mother el medici
[6:09] capital talking to me on a capital thing
[6:14] after getting back home
[6:16] my mama i thought on what the mother
[6:18] told
[6:32] outside with brethren
[6:37] brother martin said something sorry
[6:41] you know many times afterwards
[6:46] you know when you get home you have to
[6:47] look into yourself
[6:49] and to try to meditate upon whatever
[6:52] day and try to comment on it
[6:55] if you notice today
[6:58] this is what is missing us
[7:02] yeah there was a time when the pastor
[7:04] were preaching
[7:06] we were going back home
[7:08] before you to go
[7:11] people would sit around the table
[7:14] they were talking around the world
[7:17] and tried to uh straighten up things
[7:19] that didn't work out
[7:21] but today those things are missing out
[7:26] and i was saying that to the pastor
[7:28] spoke about it
[7:40] i didn't think that the god would bring
[7:43] to speak of things in that way
[7:46] and he said something that really helped
[7:48] me along the way
[7:50] i'll ask you one thing
[7:56] during this time of preaching on
[7:57] consecrations
[8:00] you'll try to bring your pencils
[8:03] with your papers
[8:05] take notes
[8:08] i'm fine we have a little children it
[8:10] was observancy they observe you
[8:13] know
[8:14] how can you come to school
[8:17] without the pen without the book
[8:23] this is the school that will go all the
[8:25] way until we leave the earth
[8:30] you know many times when the person asks
[8:32] us questions
[8:34] even myself when i get home
[8:38] i
[8:52] but every time this is being repeated
[8:55] that becomes like a repetition
[9:01] the scientists say that that repetition
[9:03] is perfect
[9:05] but you come to church during this time
[9:07] without
[9:08] any paper pens
[9:11] and you're unable to take notes
[9:14] how are you going to meditate
[9:16] with your children at home
[9:52] that's why people have hard times seeing
[9:54] the second coming
[9:57] summer for my day that really helped me
[9:59] a lot
[10:01] and got angry to see the second coming
[10:04] in the night
[10:07] now he listened to what brother martin
[10:08] said
[10:09] he said brother martin oh nice brother
[10:11] with us we have had the grace
[10:14] we have to come where we have come on
[10:17] paper condensation we cannot condemn
[10:19] them
[10:21] because we're the stars
[10:24] but girls
[10:26] we've come upstairs
[10:30] and i see
[10:44] that's what it's missing
[10:58] that's the really the hardest thing
[11:03] and i'm saying
[11:05] you have margin
[11:07] i really love random stories a lot in
[11:12] it requires that you're the parents yeah
[11:16] do you have a chance to have children
[11:19] shows are fair if they're really there's
[11:21] really a good thing to do
[11:23] is to tell your brothers your children's
[11:26] stories especially the bible stories
[11:30] you know what i'm saying
[11:37] before receiving his grace
[11:52] he says that every time that
[11:54] thomas was
[12:23] this is the only person that's always
[12:24] next to me question
[12:26] what can i do you'll buy this senior you
[12:29] said lord god see together my feet if
[12:31] you uh
[12:34] my daughter i'll take my dog
[12:36] and i'm going to offer them my team but
[12:38] you may commence ourselves too and one
[12:40] morning baltimore's went out
[12:43] he got somewhere
[12:45] and they said the high priest
[12:49] he said where you going
[13:18] [Laughter]
[13:32] daughter
[13:45] because of the healing of his wife
[13:48] he said lo se la selle person que maida
[13:51] la vie this is the only person that
[13:53] helped me whole life
[13:55] she's sick sitting
[13:58] if you don't heal her you put me down
[14:00] who can help me again
[14:04] because the daughter could uh
[14:07] suffer
[14:09] because the
[14:10] daughter could not wash him
[15:10] [Applause]
[16:06] remember
[16:20] there are times that god gives you some
[16:22] problems
[16:24] just to get you to help you to be always
[16:26] on your knees yeah
[16:28] like yeah there are always other people
[16:29] on there
[16:31] they can get easily something
[16:34] but there
[16:49] in the leg
[16:51] except maladies
[16:52] stayed a long time a long time with that
[16:54] disease
[16:57] and god left his servant like they
[16:58] remember
[16:59] the same god there
[17:02] is
[17:16] and what i'm going to ask you tonight
[17:19] is also to love him
[17:24] who is jesus program 55.
[17:29] there was sometimes
[17:33] and i was going with a very
[17:36] known
[17:37] doctor in
[17:39] anthology in theology the famous doctor
[17:42] of divinity

[17:47] klimbo uh william both for clipboard
[17:50] elephant evangel asset lung and he
[17:53] preaches the gospel in seven languages
[17:58] and we were talking about god and his
[18:00] attributes
[18:04] and i was speaking about he said
[18:08] and i spoke about it i said
[18:12] it's like a diamond that is vivo si jedi
[18:16] i said hello
[18:17] then say don't don't
[18:20] then these gifts that you speak of i
[18:22] said
[18:24] they reflect
[18:26] they are just uh just reflection of
[18:28] god's love
[18:29] for example an african and i said like
[18:32] in africa
[18:35] the president of the mine in kimberley
[18:39] there was one offer my ashes in the line
[18:43] that i mean

[18:46] mines the kimberly in kimberley
[18:49] you are well
[18:53] you can find them laying on the streets
[19:00] but you dare instead to keep one unless
[19:03] it's kind of
[19:05] associated it has to be cut by by the
[19:07] pool and sea donk so then and ghost
[19:10] german a great a great big guy
[19:14] when you find it illinois clown he
[19:16] doesn't have a fire yeah
[19:19] i set the faith it's got to be cut for
[19:22] that
[19:36] he is
[19:50] you
[20:04] that will reflect seven colors
[20:11] and looking red through red
[20:14] looks right
[20:16] did you know that
[20:18] that's right legendary
[20:52] [Music]
[21:00] is as it is the great word of god
[21:05] reflects what god is
[21:09] hey
[21:11] and this mr clayborn said
[21:29] that's the most important thing on paper
[21:31] connected not a bibliography a week
[21:33] might not know our bible
[21:36] we might not know our books
[21:41] but we know the author celestia
[22:52] you didn't
[23:47] but god wanted to ask him what is your
[23:49] responsibility
[23:53] therefore responsibility befalls us in
[23:56] every field of life attention
[23:58] pay attention
[24:00] you can be charged of course
[24:15] that's why in genesis where we just read
[24:17] it
[24:18] genesis chapter four verse nf verse nine
[24:25] genesis
[24:27] genesis chapter four verse nine let you
[24:29] know
[24:30] and the
[24:43] he knew what he had done to his brother
[24:47] but he started denying the thing
[24:51] april
[24:53] and uh also being arrogant la pir de
[24:56] shows the worst thing
[25:05] it's somebody being arrogant in this
[25:07] switch
[25:08] you say my my brother's keeper
[25:11] eddie and he said
[25:15] what has doubt done
[25:16] you a man may not defense a pop
[25:18] conscience now he's brave facing him
[25:20] before his own conscience
[25:24] you know there's something that touched
[25:25] me
[25:39] i went to see the pastors by his office
[25:44] while we were talking
[25:47] he was a little late
[25:53] asking if who could go somewhere
[26:07] he said that he was going to visit
[26:09] somebody
[26:13] ask myself
[26:16] i asked her if i was the pastor's duty
[26:18] today
[26:21] i brought it out obj application
[26:25] then i applied it to everyone
[26:28] i asked myself
[26:32] the work that the
[26:34] ushers
[26:36] and the
[26:50] the job that others could say
[26:52] until they fail that's what the past is
[26:54] doing
[26:56] now it's april 6
[27:01] okay give me the opportunity to speak
[27:03] from there
[27:21] i didn't prepare the subject
[27:25] when the person asked me that crossed my
[27:27] mind he comes in this is available i had
[27:30] said that since it's april 6th because
[27:45] have become
[28:00] japan visited farm out there i'll go to
[28:02] visit borah martial
[28:04] company
[28:05] i'll always be with my wife
[28:07] if i have an opportunity with the
[28:09] children
[28:11] foreign
[28:26] and give solutions
[29:03] because you have a responsibility in the
[29:05] church
[29:06] souvenirs
[29:07] you remember what i told you foreign
[29:23] that brought me to think so much here's
[29:25] a message and i told myself
[29:29] if i have to schmidt
[29:34] because some responsibilities before me
[29:37] because they also said
[30:21] let everyone take his part of the
[30:23] responsibility regardless
[30:26] in in my own life
[30:29] i don't like to uh measure this sense
[30:32] but i'm telling you truthfully
[30:48] and then when the one is fresher
[30:51] the other one if one is called the other
[30:53] one can hit him
[30:54] we want that everyone
[30:57] can take the part of the responsibility
[31:00] what i was thinking
[31:02] i
[31:17] i will do it

[32:41] zacharias
[32:45] and he didn't go with her views ella and
[32:47] jesus because she had believed on jesus
[32:53] she believed him to be just what he was
[32:56] the messiah
[32:58] manifested
[33:01] because she had seen him to do the sign
[33:03] of him
[33:08] speaking about rebecca
[33:50] she knew
[34:05] she wanted him to be to be brought face
[34:07] to face
[34:10] and a man ever standing face to face
[34:12] because
[34:13] it does something to you
[34:15] he's not like the other man
[34:18] he is different
[34:32] although the priest and them had said
[34:36] there's nothing to say
[34:38] it's just a bogus
[34:43] oaks
[34:46] but she believed it
[34:49] so she was praying
[34:51] now rebecca rebecca
[34:55] rebecca
[34:56] is calling you now rebecca give me
[34:57] foreign
[35:14] you'll
[35:32] that's the thing that is missing today
[35:37] the mothers have turned the book
[35:39] somewhere
[35:41] the bible don't even speak about it i
[35:42] love
[35:56] take this man before the lord jesus
[36:01] and put us in prayer no more rebecca our
[36:04] mother's rebellion
[36:06] please
[36:09] so the time had drawn so close
[36:13] so the next morning jesus
[36:15] jesus has to pass away
[36:18] so all night
[36:21] he twisted in the bed
[36:24] and he was miserable
[36:27] and uh she was laying there
[36:30] praying
[36:32] and no doubt that in the night
[36:34] when they would work out
[36:36] she would say

[36:50] the rebecca was praying
[37:48] away from that

[37:52] footage there is nothing to it

[39:31] something just goes to take him please
[39:34] there is women
[39:36] friends

[39:40] prayer is the keynote
[39:44] shows the principles
[39:45] prayer is the kingdom
[39:49] asking you shall be received
[40:22] we have sisters who have not believed
[40:23] this message
[40:26] probably we have parents who have not
[40:27] believed the message
[40:30] but it is the promise of the bible
[40:34] the god said everyone that have loved
[40:36] you and
[40:49] shall serve the lord city
[40:52] and alfred
[40:53] if you probably have a delinquent
[40:54] children

[41:02] lord i in my house
[41:21] i'm going to show you guys in four
[41:23] layers
[41:26] along the jeans

[41:33] peter with john chapter 8
[41:39] verse 24
[41:44] john 8 24
[41:51] i said therefore unto you that you shall
[41:54] die in your sin
[41:57] for if you believe not that i am
[41:59] down
[42:00] you shall
[42:22] i have many things to say and to judge
[42:24] yourself
[42:26] to judge of you
[42:54] when you have lifted up the son of man
[42:56] allah
[43:11] ever talked to me
[43:13] i speak these things
[43:17] the father have not left him
[43:21] before i do always those those things
[43:23] are that please him say look if you say
[43:27] like the one who have sent you on earth
[43:31] he will not always leave you alone
[43:35] if you do all that pleases him
[43:38] the bible says
[43:47] everything that is good it should be
[43:48] always the subject of your meditation
[44:06] if you continue in my word
[44:10] then you are truly my disciples
[44:14] and you shall know the truth
[44:17] and the truth shall set you free
[44:21] capital that's the main thing
[44:24] say they connect and relocate
[44:26] is to know him the author of the word of
[44:29] god
[44:33] then they answered him
[44:36] they answered him
[44:39] we are abraham seed
[44:44] and i have never been under the bondage
[44:46] of anyone see how say yes now
[45:03] jesus said answered to them
[45:07] everyone that practices
[45:10] he is the bond man of sin oh let's stop
[45:13] now the bond
[45:16] abides not in the house
[45:19] the sun abides forever sit down
[45:23] if therefore the sun shall set you free
[45:26] you shall be really free
[45:30] i know that you're
[45:44] if there's something to avoid in life
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:48] it's when the word of god is praised
[45:52] that that doesn't have any entrance in
[45:54] you
[45:58] hello
[46:31] [Applause]
[46:40] if you were abraham's children
[46:44] he would do the works of abraham selamat
[46:46] shows that's the same way
[46:50] if we are abraham's sins
[46:52] [Applause]
[46:53] we have to do abraham's word deeds
[46:57] maintenance
[47:00] but now you seek to kill me
[47:03] a man who has spoken the truth
[47:06] which i have heard from god
[47:21] we are not born of our fornication
[47:25] we have one father god jesus jesus said
[47:28] to them
[47:29] [Music]
[47:31] if god were to your father who may make
[47:34] it you would have loved it
[48:04] are
[48:13] he was a murderer from the beginning
[48:18] this is kane's nature
[48:21] jesus
[48:24] he was a murderer
[48:26] from the beginning
[48:31] he said that today killing
[48:43] that's just killing somebody
[49:24] [Applause]
[49:25] when somebody cannot listen to the word
[49:27] of god
[49:41] a god can speak through a language a
[49:43] coded language
[49:48] but if you cannot listen to his words
[49:53] it's a very hard for you to understand
[49:55] what is between the last
[50:10] because
[50:50] for the word of god to take place in
[50:52] somebody said demanding humility it
[50:54] requires humility
[50:58] but look at kane's nature and my
[51:01] a liar and a hogan in arrogant sizzle
[51:05] hey my brother's keeper illness
[51:09] they didn't know until before whom they
[51:11] were standing
[51:18] because therefore
[51:35] replica jesus answered genes
[51:38] i have not admitted
[51:40] but i honor my father
[51:42] and you dishonor me
[51:46] but i do not seek my own glory
[52:01] you shall never see death
[52:06] it didn't maintain now
[52:08] it said now luigi relative the jew
[52:11] therefore saying
[52:13] now we know that that has a demon
[52:16] abraham has died
[52:18] le prophet ocean and the prophet at the
[52:21] secret can guard my parents and thou
[52:23] sayest if anyone wants to give him a
[52:25] letter you shall never taste death
[52:28] cannot appear abraham are thou greater
[52:30] than our father abraham who has died the
[52:33] prophet will see some more and the
[52:35] prophets have died
[52:37] who make us doubt thyself jesus
[52:40] and jesus answered
[52:42] me
[52:43] if i glorify myself
[53:54] you
[54:05] the jew therefore said to him
[54:08] that
[54:36] now remember abram abraham
[54:40] elohim
[54:41] elohim
[54:43] god in made flesh
[54:50] how abraham saw god jesus who is jesus
[55:02] abraham was ahead by the day by the heat
[55:04] of the day
[55:06] wasn't the problem
[55:16] abraham said that let me go sit under
[55:18] the tree on the roadway of memory
[55:21] teller while he was seated
[55:24] meditative abraham was meditating
[55:27] they're thinking on jesus
[55:32] every time that
[56:08] [Music]
[56:15] from the beginning the earth was avoided
[56:17] jesus
[56:18] christ and the spirit of god was moving
[56:20] upon this everyone
[56:22] and i'm saying
[56:25] before that just created what was
[56:27] because
[56:56] and abraham gave him a uh a
[56:59] kick of me of course
[57:03] and brother what i'm saying
[57:06] for me

[57:43] i shall come down
[57:46] for this year to take the children of
[57:48] israel out out of israel
[57:51] but jesus didn't come to come down
[58:20] you
[58:22] in the scriptures
[58:24] there was no problem
[58:28] to free the children
[58:30] but read between the lord
[58:33] that's the most important thing say like
[58:35] actually you read between the lines
[58:38] of shows it's a good thing man please
[58:40] landed the shows but the greatest thing
[58:43] but it's uh divine revelation
[58:47] that's what jesus asked the disciples
[58:49] the key electricity and who is the
[58:51] christ
[58:52] the davis is the son of david
