many have heard brother banham saying like last night i could not sleep i changed three sermons you can have your own desire your own guidance i'm going to preach on this water condition but because of the prey of somebody but your prayer changes things for prayer so when you come tired you make the preacher tired of fatigue fatigue when you are on fire the preacher is on fire yesterday it was

worked with you bro really good god bless you too is everybody happy to be in the house of the lord [Music] i believe that worship is pleasing unto the lord i believe that when songs are saying and it's not just words that are coming off of our lives and it's real praise coming from our hearts and administrators they've been praying for these meetings and they told me ben i've prayed for those meetings god is going to do great things so we believe that god is going to do great shows have we been blessed so far amen but there is more for us so we're just very privileged and thankful if you would uh we'll go ahead and we'll jump into the scripture reading and we'll let you be seated you have your scriptures and you would turn with me to john chapter three it would be god's perfect plan of redemption that's john chapter 3 starting with verse 1. if you don't mind brother i'll read a verse and then you can read a verse and we'll go back and forth you got it and there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews jeff yeah the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him give your punishment jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of god nicodemus sayeth unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born nicodem jesus answered verily verily i say unto you except a man be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god jesus that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spiritual marvel not that i say unto you you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hears the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life amen i for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen do you understand your gracious heavenly father celeste lord we just come before you yet lord we come with humble hearts but we're coming with great expectations lord we're not gathering out of tradition but we're lord we're expecting lord we've sang the songs of zion lord we believe your spirit is here lord we just ask that you would have full preeminence lord we just ask that you would get the speaker out of the way lord that you would get the hearer out of the way but lord our spirits might hear directly from heaven lord we just ask that you would come together that there wouldn't be anything said that's that's displeasing unto you lord amen you may be seated and superfly so again we're just very privileged and thankful to be here this morning again we want to say thank you to our our pastor faustin for the opportunity to speak to the young people because i myself i'm a young person so in in preparing for this service i was thinking to myself i was uh going what can i say that would help the young people deletion and the lord just said well what what helps you what helps you in your walk so that's just what we'll share this morning and understanding god's perfect plan of redemption because we understand there are very many of us here and each one of us is at a different phase in life many of our influences are put there by our parents all of our standards are put there by our parents but as we begin to grow we must learn to create those standards for ourselves a wise man once told me a a wise man told me when i was very young he said then you must study he might adventure dwight and you study that you might show yourself approved you need it you need to study the words so that when you get older you are anchored in the words no you're no longer tossed about and when by how the world would like to push us that's why you see so many young people when they get to be our age they start to question the message because they never studied for themselves but it must go further than just brother brennan and it must be a direct word from god and it must rest in your heart if i could say it this way we must have the scientific world the monster thought that the bible had messed up somewhere when the scripture says the man's heart he thinks don't care because all the mental faculties are in the mind [Music] that's not just something that you think in your mind but it's something that you truly believe do we understand so we must must bathe ourselves in the god's words and as soon as they enter that little seat of doubt what may feel good out of the word of god so if we don't study now as young people when are we going to study we're at a crossroads of our life muslim doesn't care for the novi many of us here a year from now may be married we'll have families and responsibilities but as of now no you're gonna have the least amount of responsibility in your life now so through this message god has showed us the perfect plan of redemption is nature [Music] so the prophet tells us god often works through numbers and we can see that he works in threes and sevens and 12. and brother branham talks many times about the number 3. and he instructs us and says that god is made complete in the number 3. he is made perfect in 3. and we are also made perfect in the number three antoine god as your element we know him look at his song is father son holy spirit us as a human so we know even that the natural life shows the same thing whenever a new baby is born first there is water and it is through this that god has been showing us the perfect come and some of us are going to go on to the holy ghost so if you have your scriptures and you would turn over with me we're going to read from revelations and we'll we'll read a little bit of scripture here you see revelations chapter 21 this is john speaking this is jean paul he says and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more see and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared like a bride adorned for her her husband amen i will send an evil but we are heavenly creatures this world is not our home we're just a passing throne verse 3. and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and the god and god himself shall be with them and be their god amen so we can uh illustrate some of these things because god's plan of redemption is perfect and it's the same plan from the beginning of history throughout so if we were to draw the tabernacle this is you are all going to be familiar with this it was familiar the tabernacle in the wilderness had an outer court it also had an inner court and then it also had the holy of holies and we had a prophet come and tell us what each of these phases are [Music] and as we said the other night the light in this area is from the earthly sun so you are affected by all of the earthly elements had the same manner it is in the outer court as what was in the holiest of holies but all of the manna that the children of israel would eat methuselah and that's what happens with many young christians right now they go to a camp meeting they go to a banquet evol doesn't banquet they go to special meetings and the manna for them christians in past ages could only walk that far but that's why it was so important that this message came in that god didn't block us out and keep us in so then we come into the inner courts the light there is a manufactured light fabric it's a light of golden candlesticks and brother branham said that they will smoke they will fume he said why do i feel like i love the lord so much on one day and then the next day i feel like i love the world it's because you're on this phase of your christians we're at a crossroads right now don't give up but continue your walk with the [Applause] our pastor god and one eye on the world and when you do that you because you're questioning your eyes get crossed then you see more than one many times we see the god head like this comes to see god the father almost unreachable we've never seen him i'm not saying this is how it is this is how he says and then here's the holy spirit and that's what we have access to but that is only because we're looking at it on the earthly horizontal view basically but this is not how god looks god looks at it from a heavenly view of celeste and when you look at it from the heavens celeste then it looks just like how brother branham put it but you see the rings like this so now this is the father so these these are not three different persons but it is one person in three we have a soul so when you only accept the word of god out here on the flesh that will only take you so far if you only take it to the the uh the second layer of the minister then you become legalistic and you're following the rules of god only because they're lost hello those same temptations may come but now the believer is at rest they're no longer struggling but they have the true revelation of faith and they're at total rest that's why you can see some christians it seems like thing after thing happens but they never wavered and that is because they're living in the holiest of holy see basketball don't send their son okay and i just want to point out how this even even the world itself goes through the same process so by these scriptures that we just read in revelations 21. don't know he says by these passages one might think earth see that the heavens will be gone and the earth will be gone completely annihilated but he says and with the help of the holy spirit we can see the truth of this that it's what we're going into it's only the atmospheres around it says and he says every two thousand years something will happen so the first 2 000 years purged just like the first earth was covered in water it annihilated all the sin in that day with fire that will return it back to its original state so we can see here and brother mentions this in the future that john and peter both saw the same thing and hopefully this isn't too slow and methodical for you but you can follow me because when we see the big plan of god start to see how much god cares about you hey and god didn't just do all of this for happenstance but it's a pattern because he loves you and we'll get to that in a minute second peter 3. let's start with verse verse 3. knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming emotion since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation and brother branham uses that scripture right there to prove to us that we are living on the second earth not a different earth is in framework it has been purged by the waters verse six this is cease whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished a this is a perfect type of the believer this is now when he is purged with water parlor when he is baptized in the correct now it is purged [Applause] hopefully this is all right just because if i preach anything that's different than what you know your pastor preaches then you follow what your pastor said but this is just something that helped me make more when i could see the big picture of what god is trying to lose and see that he's doing it just for me he put me in this age he made me don't sit down after the seventh messenger has come apart so that i could catch the revelation [Applause] to cover me in his blood i bet so soon that all those things all things are coming and that he's going to destroy this entire earth do you see how much god loves them so the anilusian world was purged by water purging it from all the sin that was on the earth now the framework of the earth was not destroyed but it was only cleansed on the outside we're still here then the blood comes and silos so we can enter into the inner corner and then the fire comes it looks dissolved and and and you can come into aloe vera the holiest of holdings this is why god had to die it's a book this is why he had to send his son because that veil had to be read and once that the veil is written that allows but i believe there is a difference between being anointed with the holy spirit your working defense on earth when you sent us plea as being uh filled and sealed with the holy spirit yes sir brother branham said that you can have the holy spirit every day of your life and you can still go to heaven but once you are seated that [Applause] amen that's right but before that we have not come into the manifestations of the sons of god i know i put it in my hand is your message to my man i can feel the water until low i can see the water now my body is wet i am affected by the water hey man praise god picture brother but when i drink the water one may make me feel good look for my family when i go swimming it may be fun it may [Applause] [Music] if we do not take the holy spirit within ourselves then you will not fully overcome this world but this is why god sent the message do not be ashamed [Applause] so [Applause] but i'm supposed to be able to overcome this people out of the land [Applause] we have to read the rules of this world are not our absolutes absolutely we don't only not kill people because the law of this land says it's wrong but you look out into the world many many people are upset about that oh you're taking away a constitutional right [Applause] is you're always going to struggle with all these worldly things because you have not been washed by the fire of god you've never paid the love about the food you have not been purged you have not been transferred from me that's right with the fire of god battlefield ye transform me thrust for me by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect then we would have a different love for ourselves then forgiveness wouldn't be so hard in our lives and all this brother wrongs me well this person did that too or he said something wrong to me about some uh to someone else and start harboring bitterness so far to say [Applause] forgave we are being transformed for me amen so i like how the scripture says in revelations 21. the tabernacle of god the tabernacle of the jew is that god thought enough of you let me tell you a little bit about this tabernacle listen this tabernacle the holy of holies you had to be a high priest that we might be able to live together could be some people every day and if god be for you is it if god before you did your vote then who can be against you so the next time the devil comes to you man you allah love the things of the world oh touch him it shows demon no no i don't no you're not much embarrassed that's called a temptation it's a position it's not a desire that's a temptation so we see how those diagrams all line up one come on don't say croqueta the the big picture of the even the earth itself water low blood the sun spirit said it foreign md he drew two hearts he said if the heart of man has a snake in it then it's going to be perverted but if that heart of man this is a curd alone gets transformed and closed for me and now it has a dove in colombia then it will start to change the man not from [Applause] so before we get into the holy of holies we keep trying to change ourselves like this who says something should they want to the next day yeah i'm going to try to quit cussing quit looking at pornography because the inside man is not changed [Applause] just like brother branham says they come from an embled if you take an orange tree and you graft in another life [Applause] is going to be born on that branch will be the same exact fruit that was in the original trees [Applause] so now we can see how the church of our age is i don't want to put on that dress one should vape it's going to be too much work oh it's just good i can't do all the things that i want to do in there the inner man has not been changed hey man where was i second peter 3 and verse 6 where whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now which brother branham said is the earth we're living in foreign by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment that one day is what the lord is a thousand years in a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise not willing that any should perish but that all should come into repentance amen so god died for the world and she dreamed of democracy he would that none would perish but man we have free moral agents it's your choice it's your choice which road you take he didn't start working for the lord when he was 16 17 years old can you imagine he brought thousands and thousands to the lord given millions to the lord and that was in his time imagine the millions that are in the message of those rubies and jewels that will be in his group and he said i have one regret that i didn't start serving the lord i know that there are many temptations but we must serve the lord now they can't do as much affair many times you can see when a revival breaks out in a church it breaks out among the young people first of all when a new fire is stirred up and those young people have a burning desire and that fire doesn't just stay inside but that fire begins to smile they'll start witnessing all those things and that [Applause] we've seen what the devil can do with them [Applause] but in the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night. in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise up and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up this fire that's going to purge the earth [Applause] brother branham said even all of the water that's on the earth think of how deep the sea is imaginable many of you have never been overseas many have traveled overseas flying in an airplane [Applause] hmm it will completely change what is on the face and god is doing that for yourself that is how much change we feel [Applause] thank you lord came out second peter 1-1 uh simon peter a servant and a possible of an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ christmas grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus christ our lord amen according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us unto glory and virtue amen to contribute you said this is a buddha but he said that salvation is for all that would be like and all that would accept it by faith he said if you had enough faith you could create a world and go live amen so now we see that we are amateur gods and we have the right to change the atmosphere in our life [Applause] that's right so because you have the power of god living inside of it creating a world and going and living on it is not out of the question but you are now living in that godly atmosphere not on a different world on the same earth in a different world do you many times we just try to put things out into the future oh we will have the faith to go create a world said you already have whereby are given unto us exceeding great you might be partakers of the divine nature praise god this is our nature when we are born again brother branham says we receive a new nature without a new nature we can't get along with our neighbors we can't get along with our pastors you can't even that's what peter is telling us are they done downstairs okay we'll we'll we'll wrap this up real quick that you might be partakers of the divine nature africa having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust existing wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure i got so pointless then it's no longer up down up down instead of what about what about about but you can take rest you can rest you have faith in him yes we may struggle amen thank you lord so i hope that we can see that even from the beginning god had you in his mind and throughout this great portrait that he is painting he had you on his mind for your salvation all the things that happened throughout history just for you sit this simply if christ had to come again and die all over again just for you because we would do it just for you it's time we quit living below our privileges but we step and we start to take our place as the bride of jesus christ there's many young people in here yeah and we realize we're all at different phases of the first difference if some of you are justified and you're in the sanctification phase she said to respond now we don't have to come up to the altar no no no if you want to we can pray for you but i believe even in your seat lost [Music] baptisms of water about them do in baptisms of the fire of the holy ghost if you have a desire in your heart brother branham said that god wants to give it to you probably [Music] the bottom is less than the pressure that god wants to give you everyone could a person could give up think about it that's why he painted this picture he didn't want to live in paradise all by himself that he wants a bride he wants a beautiful bride that's dressed just like he wants it that talks just like he wants her to talk [Music] bring them to the redemption bring them to the fountain of life they might drink of the fountain of ever living waters lord those that are searching for the holy spirit your spirit [Music] [Music] before we hear those chains [Music] just pour your amen amen amen [Music] [Music] if there's anybody that needs salvation [Music] is [Music] from thy presence [Music] holy spirit from me [Music] me [Music] salvation [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] within me [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
