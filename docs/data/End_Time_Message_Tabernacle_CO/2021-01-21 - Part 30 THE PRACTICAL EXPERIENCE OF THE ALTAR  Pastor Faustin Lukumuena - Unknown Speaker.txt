christ's name amen amen you may be seated did you in the name of the lord jesus christ i want also to request a prayer request for myself i think my god grace i will be traveling to new york this weekend upon new york i say weekend many of you you have heard me talking about my uh cousin who lived in new york yeah one time i went to new york to visit him he was sick in for the departure new york visited malad so he passed away the funeral will be this saturday in new york city and new york if you can remember me in the prayers that would be appreciated he was almost uh he was 79 years old yeah he has uh suffered for many years ila suffered but uh he's the one who he saved me in new york when i came here new york country and i i stayed at his place for almost four or five months you should establish some more uh he was a very closer to me [Music] but it was time for him to go to the party amen amen and also i believe today there was everybody who was sending quotes of uber banham about the inauguration of the new president but let me tell you it's not about the court yeah it's how do we view that quote and how we get prepared in connection with what we are seeing brother sister time is seriously advanced afraid is serious we don't know what is going to take place they give us a passing one of these day i read to you the quote on the leodison church age george situation it's not a matter of just uh to know what is taking place in a personal problem this was a world secret past but it's a matter of to be to be prepared about what is taking place man this is a pass god doesn't do anything in the vein journey in town when he can show those things 16 uh maybe 70 or even almost 100 years from the vision he gave to his servant in 1933 it's god's grace philanthropy here brother bonham said in the message leo the syrian church age degrees paragraph 332 222 paragraph two vendor she said can anyone approve any of those visions wrong yes well they not all fulfilled yes can this complete yes we each one has been fulfilled [Music] at the end of that paragraph melathon is a paragraph he's talking about the catholic church in parliament catholic he said the catholic church is on the rise we have had one catholic president president catholic and will not i will no doubt have another you know some dude and uh today you should be it's a great big day in satan gonzo they have to do the inauguration of the new presidency in the very first inauguration de la nova president with the new vice president david novo vis president uh all the prophecy about catholic church dude the prophet israeli woman vice president for former vice president president president et cetera et cetera has been the fulfilled it's something complete now and now to the more detail down the plea this the daytime uh i receive i don't know how many caught generation the same it's not just kamala in purpose in a person ma kamala um the important if you lay but i want to read you something here major revolution let me take the what the court that people have been sending all over the seventy the seventieth week of daniel that's what's on this jim samantha danian probably some people did not receive it a certain person but this is what brother bonham said was the secret foreign no no i predicted and he said i saw a great woman stand up you know dressed in a real highly royals like a purple coma of your lane and i got like uh i i got little parenthesis down here she was a great ruler in the united states a woman in a farm some woman infamous i don't know her to be the catholic church is a reality i don't know i can't say the only thing i've seen i seen the woman je villa farmer that was all rosetta too and then he went on the pre-lady sunday but this is a woman nation mercedes nation feminine in a revelation chapter 13 apocalypse chapter 3 13 stars to teen colony et cetera et cetera there's a dualist colonial suite but we are more familiar with the scripture on revelation 17. the son plus families apocalypse descent are the great prostitutes la grande prostitutes the big harlot the lagrande and if we take that message yes you know pronounce a message oh let us read the bible first revelation chapter 17 you may be still seated that's not what i want to talk about tonight revelation 17 apocalypse you see it's talking about the big outlook on prostitutes but i want to read verses 4 3 and 4. so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and they say and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast in a farm i see this so colors have something to do with something uh scarlet colored beast green better full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns plunder blasphemy and the woman was a red in the purple yellow [Music] so it's talking about uh the woman sitting on the scarlet color beast [Music] indeed exactly the scripture we had exactly so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness the lord made transport on his feet only they say and i saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet colored beast what does the word scarlett detect because [Music] it has to do with royalty yes so this woman we see here aloha said from kenobo you see i mean if we put it in the big picture see your messenger he is talking about the catholic church he powerless catholic but in the meantime there is another woman associated with a catholic president associated uniform president catholic so it's almost the same the same they say the moment the man so the color they are wearing is it's a symbol symbol kamala was uh what did they do the last thing was what when they did uh i don't know she was dressed in white letter b on blonde but now she's in the purple manor alien violet cat purple color has to do with royalty i have work evacuate so this woman can be like a queen the lord said from petra coming hen and the brother obama continue this is what you want to pay more attention he said the beast was scarlet but the woman was a rey in purple man la fermi dabier on violet do you get the difference who says no but no have i not warned you especially the other day especially i know carton is uh rideau [Music] cotton said silly dough but i don't think really he's he wants he's talking about just the curtain like with this week nothing we have in the parliament but probably in a sense what's the purpose of recording my sequel look beautiful is to cover something because when he's talking about the three cartons here cotton one the premiere is russia said larry the second curtain talking about the china parlance and i have warned you about the three curtains in other words the three maybe the three powers with songs i don't know how long i will live in london but remember this mess with an evil decision there is the iron curtain and there is a bamboo carton red china and so on [Music] and there is the purple cotton violet you watch that accountant observation you do that's the deceiver so when we are dealing with calculus we have to examine what we are looking at examination went on it's wonderful shows me over here but what is this what this means the united states listed as uni we for the catholic church avec le gris catholic which represent the purple curtains represented in the message conference down the message conference you see brother i was talking about the iron curtain i love your wife and this is in reference with kuchev allah says reference chef he was a ex-president of the of russia he said now did you know this did you know what the name means in russia he was a heading up of the of them kingdoms you know what ancient howard means one of the the previous united states president the ancient highway telling them and you know ivan and clay and they couldn't mix together i don't want to go into the detail i talk about the things that the type of ladies show but as we skip listen just said the lord and silly senior repent i predicted three curtains in the name of the lord don't you know do senior there is one called the iron curtain yeah not the united uh uh republic soviets whatever it is yeah which will be russia what you read in china there will be a bamboo carton the bamboo they are horrible but man watch the purple cotton observer that's rising in the united states he is a level of zetas union and over the world a perspective the roman empire lambie roman the cruelest of all of them don't produce this woman she said father brother when i saw her in the vision she was the cruel equivalent woman uniform cruel amen amen so those who did not uh when we see those things issues what upon them continue but i'm continuing remember in the name of the lord su venevo don le non designer get away don't be happy about the democrat democrat by then kamala nevu democrat democrat biden kamala it's a deceiving time satan town the monsoon the deception the coming of the lord is at hand lavender senior reproduction we need a conference news available i need a conference to talk the thing over with god in conference the church is at the end of her order like lisa amen amen so i want i wanted just to highlight a few things like this of religious personnel certain shows come south but uh my message or my inspiration is mehmon inspiration we want to have a practical experience of the altar my knowledge of bombay but i want to have a practical experience tonight a measure of worrying experience practicua to give each one of us the opportunity for donation the new opportunity either to come to the altar so that you can die to yourself and have that experience they have worse experience because we can read the quote we can see the picture photo those who did not see the picture sister if you can uh show how kamala was dressed in purple if it was she's seeking a pavilion with the right hand on a vehicular man dwight levy and the left hand probably on the bible and the constitution a man gosh probably biblical constitution swearing as the vice president of the united states for the next four years like this year and those visions they say they don't lie in the mountain people can search in such settings but for me it's not about knowledge it's in a bad luck these things should bring you and i on our knees for the preparations amen amen so let us take the text i love cannoli text where i left off on uh sunday now italy dimash i want to read in the book of exodus exodus the third chapter i will just go first and read it in uh in english and you can follow with your friends says now moses kept the flock of jito he is the father-in-law the priest of media and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to orb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and he said moses moses and he said here am i and he said do not night higher put off thy shoes form off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their task masters masters for i know their souls may the lord add the blessing to the reading of the scripture and i want also to look at the first corinthians chapter 15. unconventional corinthians chapter 15 unconventional peter kansas verse 30 verse 8 christ and why stand away in jeopardy every hour i protest by your by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily i die daily that was the apostle paul says paul may the lord add the blessing to the reading okay listen so we are going to speak a little bit along parliament and uh have maybe 30 minutes they have a debt account minute where each person will give himself or herself the life can't come from it unless a man dies and hurts in his own thoughts christ can't get into his heart christ when you are trying to think for yourself can we say the possible woman now if i walk up to the altar and say yes lord yes i'm a fine fellow just reasonable miss you i will take you yo i i will pay my tithes i will do this that's not the purpose of the altar amen amen this is to say people can come at the altar or make ultra where they are who fell the lord we is to come and to give yourself in sacrifice lord i want to die to my own representative i want to die to my thoughts i want to die to myself the new birth competition but we have to go through that mess and i want to invite you to that mess tonight brother continued [Music] you got to die and hurt right there to your thoughts [Music] that's the reason why you come to the altar is also faith is the substance i skip to court and i will go back people up around the altar they didn't do that in the bible time in illinois that's a tradition of our people la silla traditions formerly in the methodist church original modern ligasement to distance but look marigold it's a good thing certain born shows i don't like this dry eyed repentance repentance i like to see somebody get up and really be sorry for what they've done amen amen so what is he trying to say here yes he don't try to say the deal you see in the bible there is no altar called amen amen so the bottom line is to do it the way the uh god's way say the first did you that's why brother bonham said in the message god's a provided way message 11 11 of owns brother bottom said and you are bound to be backsliding constantly [Music] so it takes a constant prayer to god a loss is a demand in prayer constantly so dying daily means constant prayers and my purpose is lemon beauty to rebuild [Music] family altar for me to rebuild church although believers although how much more i i am going i commemorate foreign amen amen so that is something that we cannot overlook this is a passion per se that's something that will become a part of our life and let me tell you listen he knew that as a part of our life he should have a starting point sadduce and i want tonight to be the starting point the death hold upon the departure that was really my inspiration sensitive vermont inspiration and i will read what brother bonham said from this meeting they said they said let this altar be rebuilt so that we can know how to die daily pogan opposition and give ourselves to the lord you know dunya and the brother brother said yes and if you have to die daily and see to have to stay there dead is still about more all the time at two more more amen amen a place where you die you see a spirit affecting your life for maybe many years speaking is altars to be dying every day continue and i'm continuing if paul had to die daily to stay right with god so we will all have to do that just die out to ourselves [Music] and that's getting god's way see the policy of what they do god has a provided way that you are in vapor to die to yourself there is only two ways of anything inaudible that's the right way and the wrong way and the damn ways are your ways and god's way and you can't be in your way and god's way at the same time so you have to die either your own way um oh god's way who saluted you and the god has provided a way you know what is the altar hotel you have got to forget your own way to get in god's way and you've got to get out of your own way to get in god's way resorted to voters but our own way not of war is to be it's almost what we said last sunday a classical way let's see you know or you come you sit down with veneer moves i say yay you put your glasses you read your bible to be blessed and that's it but as we write the book of exodus a communist only liver disorder we need a personal experience with a guy who's a woman didn't experience personnel and that to experience come with the altar experience when you welcome that thing in your you have to start with doctrine 101. [Applause] you are out of his way visit all this world and now look at the word forsake forsake forsaken so forsake your way abandoned forsake your thoughts forsake everything listen if you don't you are not born again you will not panic nouveau you are not dead to yourself you cannot see the kingdom of god that's the only way because that's the lasso of one and that the dust said the lord lassen and that's what we want tonight amen amen and the form tonight hey this is what we want to build and rebuild altars [Music] hotel and the altar a hotel is in your heart sedan girl you will see brother branham preaching [Music] he said oh now it's an altar call me la pelo hotel we want to give his life even we want to be remembered hotel abel abell they offer sacrifice on our sacrifice jesus jesus was given in sacrifice sacrifice and the sacrifice in the sacrifice man as you you build the altar they come who comes from hotel you will tell who's the lady lord senior here i am and what did they do with the lamb at the and this is what alta means there's a secret lotel vd is you to die to yourself brother sister referencer are you ready to pray to die we can read about moses our moses heading experience is a very experience moses did not search for that experience paul did not search for that experience the excision experience and my question is hey my question a do you want to have that experience revolutionary experience we can preach we can wait unbelievable and preparation people will say amen amen but sometimes they don't take the the opportunity they perform in a prime passage opportunity and that's what i want to do tonight it's a secretary of the fair to swear to build an altar the bruval comes to your hotel and say lord a dear senior i'm offering myself is your move from woman i want to die i don't want to be the same any longer it's invisible and that's [Music] are you ready to establish an altar in your home in your house [Music] take that television out of this television not only television but selma television but there are so many things a bokudo's daughter shows that have taken the family out of this kind of uh music on the music it's playing 24 hours a juventus people feel good they just sound they don't even pay attention to which kind of spirit that is bringing in the altar displeased in order to rebuild the altar bobo reconcile hotel not only

program 42. foreign so that way of the altar the allah said what the lotel they are men's ways and they are also god's way what did you he come up man's way and that way is jesus he said jesus and when you come by jesus jesus you take on jesus by a spiritual baptism and you are dead and take on christ by the new birth christ and you are born again and filled with his spirit complete this on the spree and how you know a commercial survey because that your life would compare with those of the bible those apostles who was robbed in his righteousness and wonders divine healing quite on the scene
