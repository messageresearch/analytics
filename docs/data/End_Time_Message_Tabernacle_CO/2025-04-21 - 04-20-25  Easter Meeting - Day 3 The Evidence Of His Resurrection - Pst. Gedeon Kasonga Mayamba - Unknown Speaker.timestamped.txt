[1:07:29] one of you to this uh special Easter
[1:07:33] services and this is going to be the
[1:07:36] last
[1:07:37] round and I think God has given all
[1:07:43] and we have to receive all.
[1:07:47] Uh don't uh think
[1:07:51] what about the devil is going to tell
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:55] it's
[1:07:57] finished. Everything has been paid.
[1:08:01] It's up to you
[1:08:03] now. Amen. Amen. So I want to take a
[1:08:07] moment to thank each one of you.
[1:08:11] Especially those who came here at 6 a.m.
[1:08:17] I know it's a great sacrifice.
[1:08:21] May God bless you.
[1:08:25] uh leaving home maybe 5 in the
[1:08:29] morning the service
[1:08:33] uh going through the service

[1:08:40] for another service
[1:08:43] and want to God to bless you.
[1:08:47] Amen. Amen. I was reading a quote in the
[1:08:52] meantime. Brother Bernham preached a
[1:08:55] message for six hours. How many know
[1:08:57] that?
[1:09:01] Six hours.
[1:09:06] Yes. The spoken word is the
[1:09:09] original. And then you blame me for my
[1:09:14] two himself. He said it.
[1:09:18] uh he said on the with the disciple
[1:09:21] on the way to Emmeris
[1:09:25] Jesus was with them.
[1:09:28] He preached to them for six hours
[1:09:33] from Jerusalem to
[1:09:37] Emirus 6 hours. So don't blame any
[1:09:42] preacher if we don't go beyond six
[1:09:44] hours.
[1:09:48] Brother Richard, get it. Take it.
[1:09:52] We have a quote.
[1:09:55] Amen. Amen. And also I want to thank all
[1:09:59] of you, the sisters, the brothers for
[1:10:01] the
[1:10:03] breakfast. For the breakfast,
[1:10:07] did you enjoy it? I was telling the
[1:10:10] people don't eat too much
[1:10:14] so that you cannot come and sleep in the
[1:10:17] service now.
[1:10:20] Yes. Thank you for the
[1:10:23] breakfast and also I want to thank the
[1:10:28] people who have done this big sacrifice.
[1:10:35] They painted
[1:10:39] the building,
[1:10:41] downstairs,
[1:10:43] all the Sunday school classes and
[1:10:46] also outside.
[1:10:56] Uh it was with their own money.
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:06] And they don't want me to mention the
[1:11:09] name but we know
[1:11:12] God richly bless
[1:11:17] them and give them the deepest heart
[1:11:25] desire. You know God always pay back the
[1:11:30] debt. Anything you do for
[1:11:33] God, it's not in vain. He sees even the
[1:11:38] little sacrifices that human being could
[1:11:40] not
[1:11:42] see. And I believe as a
[1:11:45] Christian, we have to do some extra
[1:11:48] miles in order to get extra
[1:11:55] blessings. Amen. Amen. And uh we are
[1:11:58] also happy
[1:12:00] that uh sister Christina found her
[1:12:03] driver license.
[1:12:08] Now you can drive
[1:12:11] and make sure you respect the speed
[1:12:13] limit.
[1:12:17] Amen. Amen. So now it's uh Pastor Gideon
[1:12:21] last service.
[1:12:24] It seems like it was a very short
[1:12:27] period.
[1:12:30] I think he is following me now
[1:12:32] downstairs.
[1:12:36] Uh this time he could not come with his
[1:12:39] wife
[1:12:42] because their daughter who lives in uh
[1:12:45] France had a
[1:12:49] child but uh before the end of the year
[1:12:52] they will come back.
[1:12:54] [Music]

[1:13:48] welcome from the church after six months
[1:13:52] of absence
[1:13:55] and we thank God for it.
[1:13:58] Amen. Amen. So, as uh Pastor Gideon is
[1:14:02] going to leave tomorrow, God willing,
[1:14:07] do you want him to transmit the greeting
[1:14:10] wherever he
[1:14:13] [Applause]
[1:14:15] will? So, we thank God. So he is going
[1:14:18] to come to bring forth the
[1:14:21] word and in the meantime if there is
[1:14:24] anyone else who are thinking about what
[1:14:27] a baptism in this day of
[1:14:33] Easter we have brought the
[1:14:38] baptistry. So let us stand to welcome
[1:14:41] pastor Gideon

[1:17:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:30] Christ. It has been a great pleasure for
[1:17:35] me to have a great beautiful fellowship
[1:17:38] with you all.

[1:18:39] Anie. We are twins with the wives that
[1:18:42] Annie,
[1:18:46] she really took care of
[1:18:48] me. I did not like
[1:18:53] anything. I had everything at the the
[1:18:55] right time. May God bless her.
[1:19:06] As it was announced, tomorrow I will be
[1:19:08] leaving.
[1:19:11] I will have meetings uh pastor David in
[1:19:17] Boston. It will be uh Friday, Saturday,
[1:19:21] uh Sunday morning and evening.
[1:19:26] I will also need all your prayers.
[1:19:33] I'll also bring your greetings uh to the
[1:19:36] brothers over there.
[1:19:40] Since you want me to come back,
[1:19:43] you should wish also him to come to see
[1:19:47] [Laughter]
[1:19:51] us. Do you
[1:19:53] agree? When I need him,
[1:19:56] you got to send me.
[1:19:58] May God bless
[1:20:02] you. Before reading my scripture of this
[1:20:05] morning, let read uh the rising of the
[1:20:09] sun. I want us to read paragraph 31.
[1:20:14] before we take the message of this
[1:20:19] morning who was here at
[1:20:24] 6:00. I I already took part of this
[1:20:27] service in many
[1:20:30] occasions but this morning was
[1:20:35] wonderful for me. I thought it was
[1:20:39] over but he wanted us to come back. I
[1:20:42] don't know why.
[1:20:44] While everything was already said,
[1:20:47] wonderful. Are we ready? Back there. The
[1:20:49] rising of the sun. Paragraph 31. I
[1:20:52] wanted to
[1:20:54] read.
[1:20:57] Therefore, if God raised up Jesus from
[1:21:00] the
[1:21:04] dead, did he raise him up for a
[1:21:06] memorial? Just a memorial.
[1:21:09] Just a th and then it's over.
[1:21:12] resurrection. And this resurrection
[1:21:14] morning,
[1:21:19] is it just a certain year day of a
[1:21:23] year or a certain day that we celebrate
[1:21:30] this? Or are we beneficiary of his
[1:21:33] resurrection?
[1:21:37] What does he mean to me? Resurrection.
[1:21:41] What does he mean to you?
[1:21:45] It has to have a meaning for me and for
[1:21:47] you.
[1:21:50] Now you believe by
[1:21:54] faith that he raised from the
[1:21:59] dead. What has that got to do with
[1:22:04] me that went 2,000 years ago?
[1:22:11] What has that got to do with
[1:22:15] me? That day has to have something with
[1:22:18] youirect,
[1:22:20] a direct meaning to you. Amen. Amen. Do
[1:22:24] you believe
[1:22:26] it? Then we're going to stand and take
[1:22:29] Act chapter
[1:22:32] 1 from verse one to verse three.
[1:22:40] Luke, the one who wrote this
[1:22:53] book, the former trees have I done, oh
[1:22:56] theophilus, of all that Jesus began both
[1:22:59] to do and teach.
[1:23:08] until the day in which he was taken up
[1:23:11] after that he through the Holy Ghost had
[1:23:13] given commandments unto the apostles he
[1:23:16] had chosen.
[1:23:32] to whom also he showed himself alive
[1:23:35] after his passion by many infallible
[1:23:38] proof being seen of them 40 days again
[1:23:41] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[1:23:44] kingdom of
[1:23:45] God our father our king
[1:23:50] I commit these scriptures unto your
[1:23:51] hands
[1:23:54] as few bread and few fishes that were
[1:23:56] given to you. Bless them,
[1:23:59] Father, so that they can feed your
[1:24:03] people. Let everybody live
[1:24:07] full and be full of uh basket as
[1:24:12] testimonies. Anoint us, Father, in the
[1:24:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your
[1:24:17] own glory. Amen. Amen. You may be
[1:24:20] seated.
[1:24:25] I would like to speak about the proof of
[1:24:27] the or the evidence of his resurrection.
[1:24:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:35] In the two books of uh
[1:24:41] Luke because there's a gospel of Luke
[1:24:43] and the the book that he
[1:24:47] wrote. Those two books I sent to a
[1:24:51] certain person.
[1:24:53] He was sending to Theophilus. To
[1:24:55] Theophilus. Are we together?
[1:24:59] And to means a friend of
[1:25:02] God or he that loves
[1:25:06] God. He sent to
[1:25:09] you. If you love
[1:25:11] God, Luke is talking to you. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:18] Luke start by reminding them that love
[1:25:22] God the the content of his
[1:25:26] first for what what Jesus started
[1:25:33] teaching and insisting by the fact that
[1:25:35] Jesus was a savior resurrected
[1:25:39] savior is
[1:25:44] precising Jesus gave to apostles the
[1:25:47] evidence that he was alive. Are we
[1:25:50] together?
[1:25:52] And the terms
[1:25:56] alive is the key of success of his the
[1:26:00] resurrection. Being
[1:26:04] alive. On Friday the apostles were
[1:26:07] witnesses of his
[1:26:10] death. Everybody was witnesses of the
[1:26:12] death of death of Jesus.
[1:26:15] But the Sunday
[1:26:17] morning, they have to go tell people
[1:26:19] that he was
[1:26:21] resurrected, the people that saw him
[1:26:25] dying. They saw him how he was
[1:26:27] buried. Jesus
[1:26:31] said, they will be in
[1:26:35] trouble. I need to give them evidence.
[1:26:38] Are we still together?
[1:26:40] They will not just go to say he that
[1:26:43] died is risen. No.
[1:26:52] That is why it took care of telling them
[1:26:54] showing them many evidence that is
[1:26:58] resurrected. They had to have a
[1:27:00] convinced
[1:27:02] evidence. the evident
[1:27:07] evidence to prove people that saw him
[1:27:11] dying proving them that he's not dead
[1:27:14] but is alive. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:19] They need uh convince evidence or
[1:27:23] proof of this extraordinary event.
[1:27:28] We saw that the death of Christ brought
[1:27:30] us salvation.
[1:27:32] That was a great thing.
[1:27:34] When we were speaking of death on
[1:27:37] Friday, we have the impression that
[1:27:39] death was
[1:27:41] enough. But Saturday, we saw
[1:27:44] that if the the body was not
[1:27:48] buried, his death wouldn't mean
[1:27:51] anything because it's when he was
[1:27:55] buried that our sin were carried away
[1:27:58] from the sight of
[1:27:59] God. But this morning, I want to tell
[1:28:01] you
[1:28:03] If he was
[1:28:05] dead and stay in the
[1:28:07] tomb, his death wouldn't mean anything.
[1:28:12] It wouldn't be an ordinary death.
[1:28:17] If you stay in the
[1:28:19] tomb, even in wouldn't mean
[1:28:24] anything. What seal everything
[1:28:27] was the
[1:28:28] resurrection. Resurrection. The
[1:28:30] resurrection.
[1:28:32] prove that
[1:28:36] he could fulfill what he said. He said,
[1:28:41] destroy this temple. And in three days,
[1:28:44] I will rebuild it again. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:49] And his
[1:28:51] resurrection was the greatest event.
[1:28:56] The greatest victory that I ever fought
[1:28:59] in in this world.
[1:29:01] It's the
[1:29:02] resurrection that gives strength to
[1:29:05] death because even the
[1:29:08] day many people were dying or are we
[1:29:12] together when he was
[1:29:14] buried many were buried with him. You
[1:29:17] will tell me Lazarus was resurrected but
[1:29:21] I will tell you he went he died again
[1:29:24] but Christ since he was
[1:29:27] resurrected he's alive forever. Amen.
[1:29:31] Amen.
[1:29:33] Yes, my brothers and sisters, this is
[1:29:35] the exact truth.
[1:29:37] Living. He loved me. Dying, he saved me.
[1:29:42] Buried, he carried my sin far away.
[1:29:46] I
[1:29:49] resurrected. Justify me freely forever.
[1:29:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:55] living
[1:29:57] living
[1:29:58] Christ and the and the message and their
[1:30:01] eyes all were opened
[1:30:03] and they recognized him.
[1:30:07] uh
[1:30:08] April
[1:30:11] 57 says
[1:30:16] this in in virtue of the authority of
[1:30:18] the word of
[1:30:21] God and according to what I feel in my
[1:30:24] soul I declare
[1:30:27] the same spirit the Holy
[1:30:30] Spirit is right here in this
[1:30:34] time in the virtue of the word of God.
[1:30:37] Amen. Amen. I declare, the same spirit,
[1:30:42] the Holy Spirit
[1:30:45] is right here in this side among his
[1:30:48] people.
[1:30:50] Are we
[1:30:51] together now?
[1:30:53] I
[1:30:55] declare he's risen from dead. I declare
[1:31:00] he's
[1:31:01] alive forever.
[1:31:04] I declare he's the same yesterday, today
[1:31:07] and
[1:31:09] forever, the same in principle,
[1:31:12] the same in
[1:31:14] power, the same in everything
[1:31:18] except his physical
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:21] body who is seated in glory in the right
[1:31:24] hand of God.
[1:31:26] The Holy Spirit is way here
[1:31:30] opening working, accomplishing,
[1:31:37] doing the very exact thing, the work
[1:31:39] that Jesus was doing
[1:31:44] when this is the evidence of his
[1:31:46] resurrection.
[1:31:48] When the Holy Ghost
[1:31:50] that he released on the cross comes back
[1:31:53] in the church and does the same thing
[1:31:57] That's the evidence that he's
[1:31:58] resurrected. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:32:00] Hallelujah. Yes, my beloved brothers.
[1:32:04] It shows us the father. Show us what
[1:32:07] says our paragraph 18.
[1:32:11] I'm talking about the evidence of his
[1:32:12] resurrection.
[1:32:15] I know I won't be
[1:32:17] long. I don't even feel like taking
[1:32:20] long.
[1:32:22] I look just seeking a place where God
[1:32:24] will take
[1:32:26] over and leave the meeting and that will
[1:32:28] be over. I
[1:32:32] believe when you can see the power of
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] God sweeping through a
[1:32:40] meeting. Are we in a meeting? I repeat,
[1:32:45] I believe I
[1:32:46] think when you can see the power of
[1:32:50] God through a meeting,
[1:32:54] it means this
[1:32:56] that Jesus is living somewhere.
[1:32:59] Hallelujah. It says
[1:33:01] hallelujah. The same godly ghost power
[1:33:07] that raised them up on the day of
[1:33:08] Pentecost
[1:33:11] and give them the blessing of God.
[1:33:13] That
[1:33:15] power is still in existence
[1:33:20] somewhere when you can see a church that
[1:33:23] is together with God. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:27] What a marvelous thing. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:32] When you see a spirit of God pouring out
[1:33:34] in the
[1:33:35] meeting because the spirit of God will
[1:33:37] pour. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:40] He was with us this morning.
[1:33:43] He never left. He's here.
[1:33:45] I know he's here.
[1:33:48] And you know that as well. When you see
[1:33:51] that,
[1:33:52] that means Jesus Christ is alive.
[1:33:55] He appeared to them alive.
[1:33:58] And gave them many
[1:34:00] evidence that he was a Christ
[1:34:02] resurrected Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:06] Yes. My beloved brothers,
[1:34:09] in the message there,
[1:34:12] the greatest red flesh,
[1:34:16] he said the paragraph
[1:34:21] 96. No matter what the man says.
[1:34:25] Only what God says that what matters.
[1:34:29] Are we
[1:34:30] together? Man still a manipl.
[1:34:33] No matter how many diploma he has,
[1:34:37] though he's a prophecy all the
[1:34:39] specialist he remains a man what it says
[1:34:42] a man doesn't
[1:34:46] matter only what God says matter
[1:34:52] amen tell me it's not a word see where
[1:34:56] we
[1:34:57] are look around you and you see how we
[1:35:01] dying say wake up and shake yourself
[1:35:09] go back to the Easter exper experience.
[1:35:12] My prayer this
[1:35:15] morning, let let Easter not be just
[1:35:19] coach. Let Easter not be just a
[1:35:21] teachinger.
[1:35:24] Let Easter be an experience,
[1:35:27] an experience, a personal experience.
[1:35:31] Easter in your
[1:35:33] heart, Easter in your life. Whatever
[1:35:36] says,
[1:35:38] go back to Easter experience
[1:35:41] of the resurrection,
[1:35:44] showing that Jesus
[1:35:45] Christ lives today.
[1:35:50] He's alive now forever
[1:35:52] more. He's the same yesterday, today.
[1:35:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:57] Certain people
[1:36:01] as if Easter was just a history.
[1:36:05] Easter is just
[1:36:08] history. Easter is a living
[1:36:12] reality. Easter is an experience. Amen.
[1:36:18] Amen. It's just a me. It's not just a
[1:36:21] memorial that we have to
[1:36:23] celebrate. It's not an affair that we
[1:36:26] saw this morning.
[1:36:28] Easter is more than
[1:36:31] that. Easter is the manifestation of the
[1:36:34] Lord Jesus Christ. Let somebody say with
[1:36:36] me, amen. Amen. Amen. Easter,
[1:36:42] the resurrection.
[1:36:44] It's not a historical affair.
[1:36:46] It's an experience,
[1:36:49] a reality. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:53] And the weakest men of the
[1:36:55] city says paragraph uh 89 96. He says
[1:37:01] this,
[1:37:03] let it be white or black, yellow or
[1:37:07] brown, poor or rich, slave or free or
[1:37:12] men and women.
[1:37:16] God is seeking somebody that will serve
[1:37:17] him. Let me repeat.
[1:37:21] letting me black or white, yellow or
[1:37:23] brown, poor and rich, slave or free, men
[1:37:27] and
[1:37:29] women that is looking for a man that
[1:37:31] will serve him.
[1:37:35] Why?
[1:37:41] Because is in need today. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:46] He needs to be washed.
[1:37:50] No matter the organization that we
[1:37:52] got, no matter the man that we are
[1:37:56] training, the the school that we
[1:38:00] building, God needs somebody to serve
[1:38:04] him, somebody that will live a
[1:38:09] life, somebody that will testify that he
[1:38:12] got the Holy
[1:38:14] Ghost to live a clean life.
[1:38:18] said that's
[1:38:21] true that someone that can live a life
[1:38:23] that can produce. Now listen, he needs
[1:38:30] people that speak of Jesus and then
[1:38:34] that produce
[1:38:39] Jesus. God is looking for somebody that
[1:38:41] speak of Jesus
[1:38:43] and that can produce Jesus, that
[1:38:46] manifest Jesus.
[1:38:48] that's speaking of him and they can
[1:38:50] manifest it and they can produce it. Not
[1:38:54] just speaking of him, but you have to
[1:38:56] produce it
[1:39:00] because this is the very evidence of his
[1:39:02] resurrection. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:05] Yes, my brothers and sisters.
[1:39:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:09] I'm just placing
[1:39:11] foundation. The expert of
[1:39:14] faith paragraph 81 second part he says
[1:39:22] in remembering of our lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:27] who is risen from
[1:39:31] dead who standing here among
[1:39:36] us he's saying among us am
[1:39:40] us means amand
[1:39:43] us. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:49] who standing right now among us
[1:39:53] manifesting miracles
[1:39:56] and wonders of his resurrection.
[1:40:01] The infalluable
[1:40:04] evidence that is risen from
[1:40:07] death that is not
[1:40:11] dead is alive in his
[1:40:14] church by miracles and pro
[1:40:19] wonders. Christ is giving infallible
[1:40:23] evidence that is not a dead
[1:40:26] Jesus. He's a living Christ this
[1:40:29] morning.
[1:40:31] We are not worshiping in
[1:40:34] history. We are not here in the name of
[1:40:38] history. We are not here to remember
[1:40:41] history.
[1:40:43] But we are here to worship a living one,
[1:40:46] the resurrected one,
[1:40:49] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:53] We infallible evidence of his
[1:40:57] resurrection. I'm speaking about an
[1:40:59] infallible
[1:41:01] evidence. I'm not just going to speak of
[1:41:04] it. The morning of the first Easter when
[1:41:07] he was
[1:41:09] risen, he is the only one who gave the
[1:41:12] evidence that he was
[1:41:14] resurrected this
[1:41:17] morning because he's the same yesterday,
[1:41:19] today, and forever.
[1:41:22] He will come in this building.
[1:41:26] Your eyes will see it
[1:41:29] this morning.
[1:41:31] Your eyes will see him
[1:41:36] and will give evidence that is risen.
[1:41:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:42] Yes, my brothers and
[1:41:43] sisters, I know my redeemer
[1:41:46] liveth paragraph uh 72
[1:41:50] and
[1:41:51] 73. And he said
[1:41:55] now while he was having their
[1:41:59] conversation what a great
[1:42:02] feeling what a great
[1:42:05] fellowship and I believe with all my
[1:42:07] hearts
[1:42:10] that's little
[1:42:12] tabernacle are we
[1:42:16] together we'll see
[1:42:20] today the direct
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:24] evidence that Jesus Christ is risen from
[1:42:30] dead is
[1:42:32] visible is visible before
[1:42:35] them. That's healing the
[1:42:39] sick and fulfilling great miracles and
[1:42:44] wonders which is part of the great
[1:42:47] commission. I will repeat
[1:42:49] this and I believe with all my
[1:42:52] heart it's better when I'm believing
[1:42:54] with all my heart and I believe with
[1:42:56] you. I believe with all my
[1:42:59] heart that this little old tabernacle
[1:43:02] here will sit today
[1:43:07] the direct evidence
[1:43:11] that Jesus Christ raised from the
[1:43:15] dead visible before their
[1:43:18] eyes. Your eyes will
[1:43:21] see somebody else eyes.
[1:43:26] Oh my brothers and sisters,
[1:43:28] Uh
[1:43:29] 73 them things,
[1:43:33] miracles and
[1:43:39] wonders was including the great
[1:43:41] atonement that was made at
[1:43:43] Calvary and to me the healing, the
[1:43:48] miracles, the wonders and for
[1:43:54] me it's the infallible proof of his
[1:43:57] resurrection.
[1:43:59] And after his resurrection, he
[1:44:02] said, "You must go into the whole
[1:44:06] world and preach this gospel to every
[1:44:13] creature. This son shall accompany them
[1:44:16] that
[1:44:18] believe in my name." They will cast out
[1:44:20] evil
[1:44:21] spirits. They
[1:44:24] speak. Somebody will speak in tong
[1:44:28] today. Somebody will speak in tong this
[1:44:30] morning. Amen.
[1:44:31] Amen. They will speak tongues. Amen.
[1:44:36] They will touch stupid and it will not
[1:44:39] harm them. They will take it will not
[1:44:42] hurt them. Amen.
[1:44:44] Amen. They will lay hands on the sick
[1:44:47] and they will heal.
[1:44:49] I come from Winnipeg. There was a
[1:44:51] brother, brother boss.
[1:44:54] He was
[1:44:55] poisoning. It's been two
[1:44:58] years. He was under treatment in
[1:45:00] Winnipeg, Canada. Nothing was
[1:45:03] changing. If he eats
[1:45:05] something, he goes back to the hospital.
[1:45:08] If he eats something else in the
[1:45:10] hospital, he eats
[1:45:12] something. There were many things that
[1:45:14] he could do because of the
[1:45:17] poison one day as this one. And I was
[1:45:21] speaking as I'm speaking right now. The
[1:45:23] same
[1:45:24] God in whom I gave all my life, the same
[1:45:28] God came
[1:45:30] down. The same evening, the brother
[1:45:34] left, he ate everything. He was
[1:45:37] completely healed and delivered.
[1:45:39] Yes, my brothers and sisters again in
[1:45:42] Winnipeg.
[1:45:44] Your sister was sick
[1:45:45] and since
[1:45:48] January he she had high fever that
[1:45:50] couldn't go down. They did all the exam.
[1:45:54] They did it again and
[1:45:55] again. Fever was not going down.
[1:45:59] And the pastor called me pastor Morris
[1:46:01] called Boris Boris Boris. He took me. We
[1:46:05] went to the hospital and I prayed for
[1:46:07] the
[1:46:08] system. the the the the flesh the skin
[1:46:11] was hurting was not going down. They
[1:46:14] called they took all the medication they
[1:46:16] did all the
[1:46:17] exams. You know what you do here?
[1:46:21] Everything nothing could happen. I pray
[1:46:23] for the sister at the
[1:46:26] spot. The fever stopped. We left the
[1:46:29] next
[1:46:30] day. She didn't feel any uh tickling on
[1:46:34] the on the skin.
[1:46:36] She was completely healed before he ging
[1:46:40] out. She was the one praying for the
[1:46:43] sick. She was praying for the ones in
[1:46:45] her room.
[1:46:48] Amen. She never walked
[1:46:50] since few days
[1:46:52] after since she was a
[1:46:55] teacher. She walked to
[1:46:57] school 3 kilometers on foot.
[1:47:01] The same God is here. He will do the
[1:47:05] same thing.
[1:47:08] The infallible evidence of his
[1:47:09] resurrection, the direct evidence.
[1:47:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] Yes, my brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:47:19] Amen.
[1:47:20] Says, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:24] Expectation.
[1:47:28] Paragraph 80.
[1:47:30] Oh my
[1:47:31] friends, somebody still with me.
[1:47:35] Listen. He says,
[1:47:39] "Father, now
[1:47:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:47:45] after the
[1:47:48] resurrection, the helpers and his
[1:47:50] friends went walking down to the
[1:47:52] city and on the road down there, a
[1:47:56] [Laughter]
[1:47:58] stranger. Do you know that
[1:48:00] stranger? Stranger stepped out.
[1:48:04] They begin talk to them.
[1:48:07] They talk all day long. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:12] Oh my beloved
[1:48:13] brothers and explain the scripture to
[1:48:16] them. Now
[1:48:19] listen, they didn't know he was
[1:48:23] he. I will explain it. The Bible
[1:48:27] says starting with
[1:48:29] Moses through
[1:48:31] Psalms and all the
[1:48:34] prophets. He was explaining them in the
[1:48:36] scripture everything about
[1:48:38] him. He wanted them to recognize him by
[1:48:42] scriptures. But they did not recognize
[1:48:46] him by the
[1:48:49] scriptures. Amen.
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:54] They did not recognize him by the
[1:48:57] scriptures. He tried to explain
[1:49:00] to recognize him by
[1:49:04] explanation. That is why I won't explain
[1:49:06] too much. So that he has to come and do
[1:49:09] what he has to do. I believe with all my
[1:49:12] heart. Are you
[1:49:14] ready? Let me continue. Brother says,
[1:49:17] they did not recognize
[1:49:19] him. When he got near the city,
[1:49:23] He made as he will go
[1:49:26] far. This is all the strategy of all
[1:49:29] time. When he comes for
[1:49:32] you, he it seems like he's going far
[1:49:37] because he wants
[1:49:38] something. He likes to be invited.
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:45] Amen. He left the glory to go to
[1:49:48] Abraham. He saw Abraham sitting there.
[1:49:51] He was just uh he appeared like he was
[1:49:53] passing by
[1:49:56] so that Abraham could say Lord
[1:50:00] don't pass by.
[1:50:03] He was walking with the disciples.
[1:50:06] They got to the
[1:50:07] destination while he when he wanted to
[1:50:09] reveal something. He it seems like he
[1:50:12] was passing by so that they can say stay
[1:50:15] with us.
[1:50:18] Say that with me. Stay with us.
[1:50:21] Amen.
[1:50:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:25] If you have a
[1:50:27] problem and it seems like he's going
[1:50:29] far,
[1:50:31] tell him I know you. That's how you do.
[1:50:34] You always do. Don't go far. You came
[1:50:38] for me for my problem.
[1:50:41] Amen. Praise God.
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:46] Just tell him that like that.
[1:50:48] I know you came for me. It's for this
[1:50:51] problem. Now you you you pretend that
[1:50:54] you want to go.
[1:50:56] I know you want you like to be invited.
[1:50:58] Just come, Lord. Come. Hallelujah.
[1:51:02] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:06] Amen.
[1:51:08] Says he seems like he was going on,
[1:51:13] but they beat him to come in and abide
[1:51:15] with them.
[1:51:18] And when once in the
[1:51:21] house and the door was shut behind them,
[1:51:26] listen here. It's everybody on his
[1:51:30] own. Just isolate yourself from
[1:51:34] anybody. Get inside in a little cabin.
[1:51:37] You are only with
[1:51:39] him. Ignore your
[1:51:41] neighbor. Ignore your wife. Ignore your
[1:51:44] husband.
[1:51:46] Get inside the cabin where you isolated
[1:51:49] with him. Close the
[1:51:52] door with all
[1:51:54] unbelief. Close the door. All the
[1:51:57] doubts. Close the door from all the
[1:52:01] reasoning. Shut the door. From all
[1:52:04] knowledge, stay with him. Hallelujah.
[1:52:07] Hallelujah.
[1:52:09] Yes, my brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:52:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:52:14] They shut the door and he
[1:52:17] says it did something
[1:52:21] here. He did not
[1:52:23] explain when he was explaining they did
[1:52:26] not understand not recognize it. Now
[1:52:29] he's not
[1:52:30] explaining. He's doing
[1:52:33] something as what he's going to do in a
[1:52:35] few minutes. You are going to be witness
[1:52:38] with your own
[1:52:39] eyes. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:44] Yes, my beloved brother. Hallelujah.
[1:52:46] Hallelujah.
[1:52:48] He did something.
[1:52:50] Oh, God.
[1:52:52] If you are the same,
[1:52:55] do against
[1:52:57] something so that their eyes may be
[1:52:59] open and they recognize it to you. Now
[1:53:03] listen, the procedure, it did
[1:53:08] something. He was different from what an
[1:53:11] ordinary man
[1:53:12] done. He does
[1:53:16] something, different from what an
[1:53:18] ordinary man can do.
[1:53:20] So that when he's doing it, you can see
[1:53:23] yourself
[1:53:25] this. The pastor cannot do
[1:53:28] this. Pastor Gideon cannot do this. My
[1:53:31] husband cannot do
[1:53:33] this. Nothing else can do
[1:53:35] this. This can only be him.
[1:53:40] because he does not share his glory with
[1:53:42] no
[1:53:43] one. He will do
[1:53:47] something that no ordinary man can do.
[1:53:51] Yes, my brothers and
[1:53:53] sisters if he heals you through
[1:53:56] surgery, the doctor can glorify
[1:53:59] themselves.
[1:54:01] I'm asking him this morning to do
[1:54:06] something. Not even doctors cannot do
[1:54:08] anything. I'm asking him to do something
[1:54:11] to do something.
[1:54:14] Only him can
[1:54:15] do. You look at yourself. You say only
[1:54:20] him can do this. It's only him. Amen.
[1:54:24] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:29] Hallelujah.
[1:54:31] This is exact truth. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:35] Says he did it in his way. And when he
[1:54:39] did
[1:54:40] it and they knew it was
[1:54:44] him what the explanation cannot
[1:54:48] do, a miracle got it.
[1:54:53] Oh, how they ran from
[1:54:56] Emaris all the way back to
[1:55:00] Jerusalem to tell the
[1:55:02] others the
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:05] Lord has risen
[1:55:09] indeed because we seen
[1:55:11] him. No, we heard him but we seen him.

[1:55:24] Jerusalem to
[1:55:26] emerge? They spend all day
[1:55:29] long from the morning until the evening
[1:55:33] as he was explaining. Moses said, David
[1:55:37] said, he's been said, he's been said
[1:55:41] to
[1:55:43] the not recognize him.
[1:55:46] When he they did that thing and they
[1:55:49] recognized him, he said,
[1:55:52] the same distance. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:56] They did the same distance in 20
[1:55:58] minutes. Are we together? Amen.
[1:56:02] They spend all day long.
[1:56:04] with all the explanation with all the
[1:56:08] teaching quotation
[1:56:10] quotation all day long. One
[1:56:14] miracle the same distance they spend 20
[1:56:17] minutes this morning what God will
[1:56:21] do. We accelerate all the procedures.
[1:56:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:56:46] long where it took you all day long. It
[1:56:50] will take you 20
[1:56:52] minutes. Where it took you years with

[1:57:21] weakness account. I take care of every
[1:57:25] words." He didn't say is risen.
[1:57:31] is risen indeed.
[1:57:36] That gives them a profound conviction.
[1:57:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:57:42] A deep conviction. Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] Now brother Benam
[1:57:48] says
[1:57:52] Jesus bam is speaking. He said,
[1:57:56] "Jesus, will you come? Will you come in

[2:05:56] meeting. Are we
[2:06:00] together? Myself and the pastor. Nobody
[2:06:03] will control. Are we
[2:06:05] together? Are we going to say this? It's

[2:06:28] else, in your life, in your home, in
[2:06:32] your soul, in your heart, in your at
[2:06:35] work.

[2:06:40] something that will be the infallible
[2:06:43] evidence of his
[2:06:45] resurrection and you will say this can
[2:06:49] only be

[2:49:27] Dear heavenly father,
[2:49:32] we want to be grateful to you.
[2:49:38] for these wonderful meetings.
[2:49:43] True Lord.
[2:49:45] Two Lord. It's two when we say special
[2:49:49] meetings.
[2:49:51] It's because you the special God is was
[2:49:56] present and if you
[2:49:59] came
[2:50:00] father we are praying now
[2:50:04] so that we can
[2:50:06] see with our own
[2:50:09] eyes the
[2:50:12] evidence of your
[2:50:14] resurrection for which we are
[2:50:19] beneficiaries. Father, we don't have
[2:50:21] much
[2:50:23] word, but we want just to ask one
[2:50:27] thing for the situation of each one of
[2:50:32] us that you do something
[2:50:37] special where each one will
[2:50:43] remember and
[2:50:45] say this only can be God. Especially
[2:50:53] those who have report
[2:50:58] from the medical doctors.
[2:51:02] Father, if I can know some
[2:51:07] cases, you know all the cases.
[2:51:12] We are inviting you on the scene.
[2:51:16] It's not important
[2:51:20] or necessary necessary to talk about the
[2:51:23] god of history.
[2:51:27] It's good to lift up people
[2:51:30] [Music]
[2:51:31] face. But once the faith has reached the
[2:51:37] top, it must release the
[2:51:42] supernatural and let the supernatural
[2:51:46] be produced
[2:51:49] and we go from testimony meeting to
[2:51:52] testimony meeting.
[2:51:56] Yes, Lord.
[2:51:58] As the
[2:52:00] shepherd, I
[2:52:03] know things that I cannot do.
[2:52:08] I know what the doctors have declared
[2:52:12] and have faith.
[2:52:16] Father, I have seen you
[2:52:19] when the doctor
[2:52:22] declared that we could not have
[2:52:26] children. But today you came on the
[2:52:30] scene and we can look
[2:52:33] back. This was only
[2:52:37] God. But you are not the God of
[2:52:40] yesterday.
[2:52:43] You are the same. If you could have done
[2:52:46] it for one
[2:52:49] person and the next person
[2:52:53] who could approach
[2:52:55] you in the same
[2:52:58] condition they are here.
[2:53:01] Father, let the same result
[2:53:04] [Music]
[2:53:06] be manifested.
[2:53:08] [Music]
[2:53:11] Testimony that has been given,
[2:53:15] let more to
[2:53:18] come. I commit them into your
[2:53:22] hands. And I'm asking
[2:53:25] again that when the word of God is
[2:53:29] preached, people may be
[2:53:32] excited, faith can be
[2:53:35] boosted. But if it's not
[2:53:38] maintained to go and continue to testify
[2:53:42] and believe the same
[2:53:44] way, the devil will come and rob
[2:53:49] it. and we will come
[2:53:52] back to the same
[2:53:55] condition. I ask Lord that you do
[2:54:00] something that faith could be
[2:54:04] maintained
[2:54:06] until result will be
[2:54:10] seen. I pray for many
[2:54:14] cases of
[2:54:17] sicknesses from the youth to the
[2:54:20] adults from the babies,
[2:54:24] teenagers, all
[2:54:26] ages, father, any
[2:54:29] disease for which you pay the price on
[2:54:34] Calvary, let it
[2:54:38] go. and every sick
[2:54:41] person to hold on to the promise of
[2:54:45] healing.
[2:54:48] Grant it,
[2:54:49] Lord. And we want to remember that
[2:54:53] time and confess it. Only
[2:54:57] God has done it.
[2:55:01] Bless your servant,
[2:55:05] the rest of his dream.
[2:55:09] his family,
[2:55:12] his churches,
[2:55:14] his
[2:55:15] plans keeping keep him in good
[2:55:19] health so that he can be a
[2:55:22] blessing if there will be tomorrow and
[2:55:26] wherever he will be, let him be always a
[2:55:30] blessing.
[2:55:33] We pray
[2:55:34] also for his traveling
[2:55:38] mercies and also those who came out of
[2:55:42] state to visit
[2:55:45] us. Give them their heart
[2:55:48] desires and bless their trip going
[2:55:54] back. If there is
[2:55:57] anyone who is not yet saved,
[2:56:02] father
[2:56:03] Let this season
[2:56:06] bring salvation to their household.
[2:56:11] We thank you above all the words we
[2:56:15] could
[2:56:17] express in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:56:21] Amen. Amen.
[2:56:24] [Music]
[2:56:28] [Applause]
[2:56:31] You may be seated.
[2:56:35] Uh we want to do a baptism service.
[2:56:46] If also there is anyone
[2:56:50] maybe you did not think
[2:56:52] about taking the
[2:56:56] Baptist you don't have any
[2:56:59] schedule. You don't know what tomorrow
[2:57:02] is reserving for you.
[2:57:06] The word of God said,
[2:57:08] I believe in the book of uh Hebrews,
[2:57:19] I believe, Hebrew 3:15.
[2:57:25] If you hear his voice,
[2:57:32] while it is said
[2:57:36] today, if you will hear his
[2:57:39] voice, harden not your heart as in the
[2:57:43] provocation.
[2:57:51] tomorrow does not believe uh belong to
[2:57:54] you.
[2:57:56] And also in the book of Matthew
[2:58:01] after the disciple walk with Jesus to
[2:58:04] the
[2:58:07] end of the supernatural sign he
[2:58:11] operated.
[2:58:15] He broke the bread.
[2:58:19] It was the sign of breaking the seven
[2:58:24] seals. But that sign he did, he did it
[2:58:29] before before the crucifixion.
[2:58:33] You remember
[2:58:35] Thursday he had
[2:58:37] communion and Sunday when he resurrected
[2:58:42] he walked with the disciples and coming
[2:58:45] somewhere as pastor Gideon was
[2:58:48] beautifully explained
[2:58:50] it. He wanted to
[2:58:52] continue but they hold him master come.
[2:58:57] When he came, he broke the bread.
[2:59:01] And that's only one
[2:59:03] sign reminded the disciple,
[2:59:07] the sign that was done before
[2:59:12] crucifixion and that was the thing that
[2:59:14] opened up their
[2:59:16] eyes and they
[2:59:18] recognized that was
[2:59:20] him. Now in your condition,
[2:59:24] you know what you have heard.
[2:59:28] what you have seen him doing for other
[2:59:30] people.
[2:59:33] Maybe let another sign be
[2:59:37] done for you your eyes to
[2:59:41] open and
[2:59:43] recognize it him. So after he done this,
[2:59:49] I'm in Matthew
[2:59:51] 28 verse 16.
[2:59:54] [Music]
[2:59:59] Then the 11 disciples went away into
[3:00:02] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[3:00:05] appointed them.
[3:00:13] And when they saw him, they worshiped
[3:00:15] him, but some
[3:00:27] doubted. saying, "All power is given
[3:00:31] unto me in heaven and in
[3:00:36] [Music]
[3:00:41] earth. Go ye therefore and teach all
[3:00:45] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[3:00:49] the Father, and of the Son, and of the
[3:00:52] Holy Ghost.
[3:01:02] teaching them to observe all things
[3:01:05] whatsoever I have commanded you. And
[3:01:08] Lord, I am with you always, even unto
[3:01:11] the end of the world. Amen.
[3:01:22] So I want you to notice verse 19.
[3:01:29] He said, "Go ye therefore
[3:01:32] and teach all the nations,
[3:01:35] baptizing them in the name of the
[3:01:38] father."
[3:01:41] And I want you to notice the name is
[3:01:46] singular. You know, after
[3:01:49] Easter, he gave a commandment to the
[3:01:52] church.
[3:01:55] Go ye therefore
[3:01:58] and teach all nations,
[3:02:02] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[3:02:05] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
[3:02:11] [Music]
[3:02:13] And here you know if you follow the
[3:02:16] story in the
[3:02:18] Bible, it was Jesus
[3:02:21] speaking. He said the name in singular
[3:02:26] the name that name is valid for the
[3:02:30] father
[3:02:32] for the son and for the holy ghost. But
[3:02:36] he did not disclose that
[3:02:39] name. And the
[3:02:41] disciple have to
[3:02:43] wait until
[3:02:46] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[3:02:49] fell to
[3:02:51] understand what that name was.
[3:02:55] But in the
[3:02:56] meantime, from the time Jesus spoke
[3:02:59] these
[3:03:01] words, no one was ever baptized in the
[3:03:05] Bible in the name of the Father, the
[3:03:07] Son, and the Holy
[3:03:12] Ghost until when the Holy Ghost
[3:03:16] fall. And then Peter was the first one
[3:03:21] to tell the people which name that was.
[3:03:26] And 3,000
[3:03:28] people were baptized
[3:03:31] thereafter. And this is what we see the
[3:03:35] continuation of the scripture. And
[3:03:39] today, brother Bam told us don't baptize
[3:03:43] the
[3:03:44] people just in the name of Jesus
[3:03:47] Christ because there are so many people
[3:03:50] called
[3:03:53] Jesus. But there is only one who get the
[3:03:57] name of Jesus
[3:04:00] Christ and who is the Lord. In other
[3:04:04] words, who is the boss?
[3:04:08] And is that in that name that the real
[3:04:11] baptism need to be performed?
[3:04:17] So brother and
[3:04:19] sister take he this opportunity
[3:04:23] in this uh Easter morning.
[3:04:29] If you are not
[3:04:33] ready to consider the water of
[3:04:37] baptism, if you are
[3:04:41] questioning about the baptism you have
[3:04:45] received, don't be
[3:04:48] ashamed and say, you know, I've been
[3:04:52] baptized, but I'm not sure which kind of
[3:04:55] baptism that was.
[3:04:57] the water is ready.
[3:05:00] You don't want to cross on the other
[3:05:02] side and find out that you did not do
[3:05:06] the right
[3:05:08] thing. Even if you have been baptized
[3:05:12] somehow, if the word of God, if God the
[3:05:17] boss is speaking to
[3:05:20] you saying you have to reactivate your
[3:05:24] baptism,
[3:05:26] Don't hesitate
[3:05:29] anyone
[3:05:34] candidate anyone. I'm not pushing anyone
[3:05:39] but I'm just giving the
[3:05:42] opportunity. So we have brother
[3:05:47] Joseph who want to redo his water
[3:05:51] baptism.
[3:05:54] I don't know how long he has been
[3:05:57] baptized but he feel like I have to be
[3:06:00] do
[3:06:01] it and uh anyone among
[3:06:04] us don't just uh say well I'm okay
[3:06:10] uh if something is speaking to
[3:06:12] you we have a spare
[3:06:17] closes so in the meantime though you
[3:06:20] have already changed

[3:12:18] responsibility responsibility especially
[3:12:21] in the country we are living
[3:12:25] in
[3:12:27] where America with the
[3:12:31] children has a lot of problems.
[3:12:35] Uh sometimes we are so tough on our
[3:12:39] children but they are the
[3:12:42] best. Many are in the
[3:12:45] world reaching just age of
[3:12:50] 18. Uh they rent their own
[3:12:53] apartments living with girlfriend,
[3:12:55] boyfriend, doing anything.
[3:12:58] It is grace to see you all of you
[3:13:04] uh serving the
[3:13:06] Lord. My own personal
[3:13:09] experience when I came here in America
[3:13:13] uh more than 30 years ago, the church I
[3:13:16] was uh going
[3:13:19] to, I was teaching Sunday school for
[3:13:22] teenagers.
[3:13:25] But among all the people for my
[3:13:29] class, I heard them
[3:13:31] saying, "Oh, this thing I'm not there.
[3:13:36] I'm just waiting once I turn
[3:13:40] 18. I will get my social security
[3:13:44] card and I go
[3:13:46] work and done with the church."
[3:13:50] I was telling the pastor and the parent
[3:13:54] today there is only one child
[3:13:58] [Music]
[3:14:02] who is married who is still in the
[3:14:06] faith and serving God. When I ask what
[3:14:11] about this one he is in
[3:14:14] jail. What about this one? She had
[3:14:18] uh a certain number of babies
[3:14:22] and she's in the world
[3:14:25] brother.
[3:14:26] A lot of things but we want to

[3:15:02] [Music]
[3:15:04] thank is brother
[3:15:07] Neville for the job he has
[3:15:09] done with the interpretation.
[3:15:15] [Music]
[3:15:18] He was the mouth the mouthpiece for
[3:15:21] brother Caleb
[3:15:24] and all those who don't understand
[3:15:28] our Spanish.
[3:15:32] So God bless you.
[3:15:34] Where is Sharon? Where?
[3:15:37] Oh, go tell Sharon to be to give you a
[3:15:40] big fufu.

[3:15:52] God willing I have another guest
[3:15:55] speaker.
