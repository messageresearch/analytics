[57:31] amen you may be seated may God bless
[57:44] you there's been a
[57:48] month since Israel was a war the
[57:52] president Benjamin Premier Minister
[57:54] Benjamin
[57:55] the Prime Minister Benjamin
[57:57] [Music]
[57:59] n said that the war will be
[58:03] long but it won't be easy
[58:09] War I remember before the 7th of
[58:15] October
[58:17] Minister when the Prime
[58:21] Minister came here in United Nation
[58:27] with the President Joe
[58:31] Biden in their
[58:37] speech they were praising the the AI the
[58:41] intelligent artificial
[58:45] intelligence they were speaking as they
[58:48] were doing great
[58:52] things how the artificial intelligence
[58:55] came into
[58:56] sin I said to myself
[59:00] well Joe
[59:02] Biden he's coming and doing a
[59:06] speech speaking of uh artificial
[59:11] intelligence prime minister Benjamin
[59:16] nany he came as well and speaking about
[59:18] the same thing artificial
[59:22] intelligence as if you go to Israel
[59:26] they built a great
[59:29] wall they put hidden
[59:34] cameras surveillance of high uh high
[59:37] tech
[59:41] surveillance if you follow the
[59:46] news they said that they are amazed
[59:49] about
[59:50] it
[59:52] is couldn't see the enemy
[59:57] coming how the the safety the the the
[1:00:00] Serv secet of Israel can
[1:00:06] fail the the journalist was saying
[1:00:09] Israel is the the best uh in terms of
[1:00:13] security there's something that
[1:00:19] happened Israel as they were counting on
[1:00:22] intelligence artificial intelligence
[1:00:27] they forgot that their strength doesn't
[1:00:29] depend on those things but their
[1:00:31] strength it's in
[1:00:36] God when they going through
[1:00:40] hardship when he's surrendered by its
[1:00:44] enemy it's not their own
[1:00:46] strength or the
[1:00:49] Chariots or the
[1:00:53] weapons that gives them Victory
[1:00:56] no it's the god of
[1:01:02] Israel and when they put the trust in
[1:01:04] artificial
[1:01:06] intelligence they
[1:01:09] failed they said in that
[1:01:12] City in that
[1:01:16] kib they they killed of one 1,400
[1:01:21] people see alloc Co of Shah
[1:01:26] something never happened S as
[1:01:29] such that has to wake us up as
[1:01:35] Believers when we put our trust in the
[1:01:37] things of the
[1:01:39] world that's where we
[1:01:43] fail but when we put our trust in the
[1:01:46] god of
[1:01:48] Israel that is where we're going to have
[1:01:53] victory if you remember during the the
[1:01:56] war of six
[1:01:58] days Israel didn't
[1:02:02] fight Israel was surrendered by its
[1:02:05] enemy all them Arab
[1:02:08] countries they said they will destroy
[1:02:12] Israel they will wipe away Israel from
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:17] map all of a sudden something
[1:02:20] happened and the enemies of
[1:02:23] Israel
[1:02:25] they were seeking the war against
[1:02:28] Israel they were
[1:02:31] defeated what strength Israel
[1:02:33] had what weapon Israel was
[1:02:38] using because they trusted in the
[1:02:44] God and today if you look those
[1:02:47] countries Arab
[1:02:50] countries they know themselves
[1:02:52] Israel is powerful
[1:02:56] look at
[1:02:58] Yemen
[1:03:00] Lian look at
[1:03:02] Egypt
[1:03:04] Syria all them countries
[1:03:09] Iraq the people that the country that
[1:03:11] were trying to wipe away Israel from the
[1:03:14] map today we don't speak about them
[1:03:17] anymore but we speak of
[1:03:20] Israel remember brother says you are
[1:03:23] Israel spiritual
[1:03:27] Israel what is happening with Israel in
[1:03:31] natural it's the same that happening in
[1:03:33] Israel in the
[1:03:35] spiritual
[1:03:39] then that gave Israel the
[1:03:41] strength
[1:03:43] victory is the same
[1:03:46] God that will give us strength over our
[1:03:50] enemies and the
[1:03:53] victory but then you have to
[1:03:56] know what is God expecting from
[1:04:01] me did I came on the earth just by
[1:04:06] chance am I coming to church just by
[1:04:11] chance am I useful for God in
[1:04:18] something if at that time somebody is
[1:04:20] asking himself that
[1:04:23] question
[1:04:25] he has to know he has more value to
[1:04:28] God but what when we don't ask ourselves
[1:04:32] that
[1:04:36] question that is the reason why we don't
[1:04:38] fulfill the purpose for which God has
[1:04:40] sent us on the earth God is counting on
[1:04:45] us if you notice in Mark chapter
[1:04:49] 11 where we
[1:04:53] read Jesus Christ needed
[1:04:59] something when Jesus Christ came to
[1:05:03] Bey say he was
[1:05:08] hungry the day after when he came out
[1:05:11] from
[1:05:12] Bethany Jesus was
[1:05:16] angry looking
[1:05:19] from a tree that didn't
[1:05:23] have he was seeking if he could find
[1:05:27] something and coming
[1:05:30] near he only found uh
[1:05:33] leaves in other
[1:05:35] words the the the the tree was
[1:05:39] sterile didn't have
[1:05:42] fruit though it was his
[1:05:45] season the tree was good
[1:05:50] beautiful you see when you look at the
[1:05:52] tree from afar with the leaves
[1:05:55] you think that there probably something
[1:05:58] there but when Jesus got
[1:06:01] there he thought he would find
[1:06:04] something he thought he would find
[1:06:07] fruit but unfortunately he couldn't find
[1:06:10] any fruit the says that was not the
[1:06:15] season but Jesus God was conning to have
[1:06:19] something the Bible says Jesus take the
[1:06:23] word and said and said
[1:06:27] it no man eat fruits of
[1:06:31] thee what did the the TRU
[1:06:35] do was it his
[1:06:40] fault Jesus was expecting something from
[1:06:43] the
[1:06:45] tree and then he said no man eat fruit
[1:06:48] of
[1:06:53] the Jesus Christ was showing the power
[1:06:55] that he
[1:06:57] hold though it was not the season of the
[1:07:01] tree but he was showing to the
[1:07:05] disciples
[1:07:08] though even though you need
[1:07:11] something even if the thing is not
[1:07:14] there but if you speak
[1:07:17] it if you believe in the power that is
[1:07:20] inside of you the thing will happen
[1:07:27] that's the same thing that Jesus Christ
[1:07:29] is saying he's saying the same thing in
[1:07:32] Luke Luke Chapter
[1:07:36] 13 but in Luke it's speaking of uh in
[1:07:39] terms of
[1:07:41] parable the Bible says he spake also
[1:07:45] this
[1:07:47] Parable a certain man had a fig tree
[1:07:50] planted in his
[1:07:52] vineard remember Christian are the types
[1:07:56] of the the
[1:08:00] vine a man a certain man had a fig tree
[1:08:03] planted in his
[1:08:05] vard he came and sld fruit there and
[1:08:09] found
[1:08:13] none when somebody has a tree or in his
[1:08:18] Vineyard he's hoping to find
[1:08:22] something he's expecting the fruit the
[1:08:26] tree to bear fruit so that he can
[1:08:30] heat and the Bible says when Jesus
[1:08:33] Christ got
[1:08:35] there the tree didn't have any
[1:08:38] fruit Jesus Christ cursed the
[1:08:42] tree and here Jesus Christ is telling us
[1:08:45] the
[1:08:47] parable and then he's saying to the V
[1:08:49] the vine
[1:08:51] man therefore three years
[1:08:56] I came to seek for the the the vine in
[1:08:58] this V tree but I can't find none cut it
[1:09:06] down what is he going to occupy the
[1:09:10] land the Christian are the type of the
[1:09:13] tree
[1:09:15] words they are like
[1:09:18] Vine
[1:09:19] then your
[1:09:22] creator expecting something from
[1:09:26] you what can you produce for your
[1:09:32] creator are you just occupying the
[1:09:34] ground for no no
[1:09:36] reason no it's for a
[1:09:38] purpose that God placed you on the
[1:09:42] earth and Jesus Contin by
[1:09:46] saying and the V man said
[1:09:51] Lord let it again
[1:09:54] let it alone this year verse
[1:09:58] eight let it alone this
[1:10:01] year till I shall dig about
[1:10:07] it D
[1:10:09] it and maybe in the
[1:10:12] future if he bear fruit or else then he
[1:10:17] that shall cut
[1:10:21] down you know in Africa there
[1:10:26] we see how people were uh tilling the
[1:10:29] ground when somebody plant the tree in
[1:10:33] his
[1:10:35] Vineyard he's expecting to see
[1:10:39] avocados or
[1:10:42] mangoes but if he finds
[1:10:46] after the tree is not producing what he
[1:10:49] was
[1:10:50] expecting he will dig around the
[1:10:55] he will take the the
[1:10:57] dong and place around the the
[1:11:01] tree expecting to find
[1:11:04] something and the the dong for us is the
[1:11:08] word of
[1:11:09] God we are the
[1:11:12] tree without the
[1:11:14] fruit but the creator of Heaven and
[1:11:17] Earth the almighty God in his
[1:11:22] patience is coming to look for the fruit
[1:11:25] and he can't find any
[1:11:27] fruit the Lord Jesus Christ he said oh
[1:11:31] Master my
[1:11:33] Lord instead of cutting it down let it
[1:11:37] alone time let me about
[1:11:41] it let me D it maybe in the future it
[1:11:47] will bear
[1:11:50] fruit the word of God that you eat every
[1:11:53] day
[1:11:55] that will make in the
[1:11:57] future that you bear
[1:12:00] fruit even if now you don't have any
[1:12:03] fruits just hope that in the
[1:12:07] future grace to the word that you listen
[1:12:10] you bear
[1:12:13] fruit he's also saying something in
[1:12:16] Isaiah Isaiah chapter
[1:12:22] 5
[1:12:24] verse first
[1:12:32] verse listen
[1:12:36] carefully the Bible

[1:39:19] down to get in human
[1:39:22] flesh to save to bring the people of
[1:39:25] Israel
[1:39:27] out while God himself promised them he
[1:39:30] will come
[1:39:31] down but when you read in the Bible the
[1:39:33] Bible says God is in
[1:39:36] spirit and the true
[1:39:39] worshipers will worship the father in
[1:39:41] the spirit and the truth now a

[1:42:31] Jacob the same yesterday today and
[1:42:33] forever to change
[1:42:36] us if he comes in the heart of a
[1:42:40] man how much more
[1:42:47] today
[1:42:49] says
[1:42:52] paragraph
[1:42:58] 53 he's speaking of the children of
[1:43:02] Israel they they applied the blood that
[1:43:04] was
[1:43:06] applied which was a very beautiful
[1:43:11] type of the Believers that when he had
[1:43:14] accepted the death of Christ
[1:43:17] in then he becomes a child of God
[1:43:22] he start his
[1:43:24] journey
[1:43:28] down the death for the innocent lamb
[1:43:30] provided life to the guilty
[1:43:33] Believers is not the perfect type now
[1:43:37] the the church says
[1:43:38] amen the death of
[1:43:41] innocent providing life for the
[1:43:44] guilty and the death of the innocent
[1:43:48] Christ provides life
[1:43:51] for we the
[1:43:54] guilty
[1:43:58] says after God gave them life through
[1:44:01] the
[1:44:05] blood and pro that death passed over
[1:44:10] them he started them in their Journey
[1:44:13] now notice
[1:44:16] then the next thing God
[1:44:19] did
[1:44:22] as soon as they were become Believers
[1:44:23] and children and accepted
[1:44:26] God the enemy of the physical death took
[1:44:30] after
[1:44:32] them and he had them
[1:44:34] cornered right up the desert on the side
[1:44:37] the Red Sea on the side
[1:44:41] mountains says on the other
[1:44:45] side Pharaoh's Army coming up pursuing
[1:44:49] them milons
[1:44:52] of coming in to match
[1:44:56] them now God has already
[1:44:59] manifested that he gave them
[1:45:02] life when if God gave you life nobody
[1:45:06] will take it
[1:45:08] away
[1:45:10] says to the death of
[1:45:15] the now he's going to show them physical
[1:45:19] Redemption
[1:45:21] that is what we
[1:45:22] need to be
[1:45:25] transformed the physical
[1:45:28] red I have high high and
[1:45:32] D I'm always in the
[1:45:35] world I'm always make I always make
[1:45:38] mistakes says it's
[1:45:41] normal because the body hasn't been
[1:45:45] red when the the body will be
[1:45:49] redeemed
[1:45:51] God will put the devil under your
[1:45:55] feet I already believe the devil is
[1:45:57] under your
[1:45:58] feet says
[1:46:01] hallelujah do you see
[1:46:04] that for the Salvation oh for the you
[1:46:09] see for the natural
[1:46:11] man and for the spiritual
[1:46:14] man
[1:46:17] says the death angel passed over
[1:46:22] proving that God has made a way of
[1:46:25] Escape through the offering of the blood
[1:46:28] and they accepted it now he's going to
[1:46:32] make a way of escape from the physical
[1:46:38] death
[1:46:39] says like the
[1:46:42] Believers as soon as they get
[1:46:46] saved maybe cancer has
[1:46:48] hidden or some
[1:46:53] disease God has Redemption also through
[1:46:56] the
[1:46:59] power the same as he has Redemption for
[1:47:02] the
[1:47:04] soul he has Redemption for the body your
[1:47:08] body there a certain
[1:47:11] time will bear
[1:47:14] fruit of
[1:47:16] itself I believe you will not force
[1:47:19] anything

[1:48:37] this is to sacrifice the desire of the

[1:57:15] there would have massacred them right
[1:57:18] there in the wilderness
[1:57:21] if God hadn't stood between
[1:57:24] them
[1:57:26] says when the children of Israel was
[1:57:28] coming out of the
[1:57:31] Wilderness or when they came out of
[1:57:35] Egypt they stood between before the the

[1:59:04] Christ it's not the blood of a
[1:59:08] man it's not the blood of the
[1:59:12] animal the blood of the animal just
[1:59:14] cover the
[1:59:16] sin but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:59:20] that doesn't just cover the
[1:59:22] sin but divorce us from
[1:59:25] sin takes away the sin not the blood of
[1:59:29] a man but the blood of
[1:59:32] Christ

[1:59:54] shed the sin was no longer
[1:59:58] covered but was
[2:00:01] divorced and cancelled
[2:00:07] deler and the Believers stepping into
[2:00:10] the presence of his
[2:00:12] creator to dwell in
[2:00:14] it what a
[2:00:17] promise the Bible says
[2:00:20] be therefore patience
[2:00:23] brother until the coming of the

[2:00:32] signs that the prophet
[2:00:35] foretold are being
[2:00:38] fulfilled the problem with the
[2:00:42] unbeliever problem with
[2:00:47] unbeliever is to seek for Det
[2:00:52] details they always find great the big
[2:00:59] picture they want things to happen the

[2:08:55] Christ we bring forth the message of
[2:08:57] Moses at the second ex nothing would
[2:09:00] have happened

[2:17:07] forever and that's the reason
[2:17:10] why the Bible says in John chapter
[2:17:14] 14 L to what the Bible says John chapter
[2:17:16] 14
[2:17:19] Jesus said to
[2:17:21] disciple and to us as
[2:17:24] well let not your heart be
[2:17:27] troubled believe in me in
[2:17:31] God I
[2:17:33] repeat let not your heart be
[2:17:36] trouble you believe in God believe also
[2:17:38] in
[2:17:40] me in my father many
[2:17:43] mans if it were not I would have told
[2:17:46] you
[2:17:48] I go to prepare a place for
[2:17:50] you and if I
[2:17:54] go and prepare a place for you I will
[2:17:58] come and receive you unto
[2:18:02] myself so that where I am that you may
[2:18:06] be
[2:18:07] [Music]
[2:18:10] also what a
[2:18:13] promise therefore when you have the
[2:18:15] revelation of that promise
[2:18:20] you care more about your souls than your
[2:18:23] body in the
[2:18:25] fellowship by
[2:18:28] Redemption
[2:18:31] says a man in the
[2:18:33] beginning was
[2:18:36] created even in his
[2:18:38] condition or Fallen
[2:18:41] decision
[2:18:44] position paragraph 24
[2:18:50] says but
[2:18:54] today the Man was created to serve
[2:18:57] God the tree that is there on the
[2:19:01] earth it has a one
[2:19:04] purpose is to serve
[2:19:06] God
[2:19:09] says Man was created to serve
[2:19:12] God that is has what he has to do
[2:19:15] absolutely on the Earth but
[2:19:18] notice John chapter
[2:19:20] 14 he went to prepare a place for us
[2:19:25] says now listen this great
[2:19:27] man the wise man of all the men
[2:19:33] Solomon oh he speaking of in ecclesiast
[2:19:37] said he said all of them he
[2:19:41] said let's hear the conclusion of the
[2:19:43] whole
[2:19:45] matter fear God and keep his command
[2:19:49] for this
[2:19:50] is the full duty of men fear God and
[2:19:56] keep his
[2:19:59] commandment that's very
[2:20:02] important
[2:20:06] says that's the full duty of a man we
[2:20:11] wonder why we running along here men and
[2:20:16] women where that we wear clothes and
[2:20:19] have to
[2:20:21] strive and the animals
[2:20:25] don't
[2:20:27] says God feed his little old b birds and
[2:20:31] take care of everything else but
[2:20:33] us we have to shift for
[2:20:37] ourselves it's because sin separate us
[2:20:40] from our maker that's why we did that no
[2:20:45] man is moving
[2:20:48] along you don't see an animal embeding
[2:20:52] themselves it
[2:20:56] can't if he gets any better
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:00] treatment it got to come from the other
[2:21:04] source the inner Source the
[2:21:06] animal
[2:21:08] says if he has to Bear
[2:21:12] himself he has to come from other
[2:21:16] source say
[2:21:20] he doesn't build himself a better
[2:21:23] house that's
[2:21:26] animal he doesn't make himself fry
[2:21:30] his where he used to eat it
[2:21:33] ra it has to be done because he's an
[2:21:37] animal
[2:21:42] says there there's nothing in him to
[2:21:45] give a an animal doesn't have a
[2:21:48] soul but a man has a
[2:21:51] soul
[2:21:53] says
[2:21:57] therefore is a part of
[2:22:00] God what a
[2:22:03] promise even in Fallen
[2:22:07] States even in your Fallen
[2:22:09] States even in your
[2:22:13] mistakes you have a part of God your
[2:22:16] maker
[2:22:17] even in your
[2:22:19] Fallen he knows you by your
[2:22:22] name
[2:22:28] says yet it's the most greatest species
[2:22:32] all of what a consideration God has for
[2:22:40] you and when he get him in connection
[2:22:42] with his
[2:22:44] maker super he becomes a
[2:22:48] Superman what is the
[2:22:51] problem is to get in connection with
[2:22:53] your
[2:22:57] maker the only thing that can make you
[2:22:59] get in contact with
[2:23:01] your is the baptism of the Holy
[2:23:04] Ghost
[2:23:06] says with the creator of all
[2:23:11] things let me repeat so that it can sink
[2:23:14] well in
[2:23:15] you says
[2:23:22] yet the man is the most greatest species
[2:23:24] of all the species of the earth
[2:23:29] therefore and when you get him in
[2:23:31] connection with his
[2:23:34] maker he becomes a Superman
[2:23:37] almost because he's a Son of
[2:23:41] God with the creator of all
[2:23:44] things
[2:23:46] then
[2:23:48] when he make acquainted with his
[2:23:52] maker becomes a part of his
[2:23:55] maker not a part of a
[2:23:58] man not a part of William
[2:24:02] Bram William bham is a man born in
[2:24:07] sin came in this world by grace of
[2:24:12] God he said he said himself when I get
[2:24:15] there I sing aming
[2:24:17] saved by by the Creator God the Lord
[2:24:21] Jesus
[2:24:23] Christ when you get in connection with
[2:24:26] him you become part of him he becomes
[2:24:32] you what a
[2:24:35] revelation
[2:24:39] says and he refine the fellowship with
[2:24:42] his
[2:24:45] maker every Divine word becomes a living
[2:24:48] reality to him and he believes
[2:24:54] it no no wonder people can't believe
[2:24:57] Divine Healing
[2:24:59] today P doesn't don't believe in
[2:25:03] theal they are in
[2:25:06] error because if you don't believe in
[2:25:09] Divine
[2:25:11] Healing how can you believe in the
[2:25:15] Rapture divine
[2:25:18] is a part of the
[2:25:22] Rapture because the body has to be in
[2:25:25] good because the body has to be
[2:25:29] changed that's the same thing that
[2:25:32] people that to the
[2:25:34] rupture said this flesh will not go to
[2:25:37] the rupture this thing has to be
[2:25:42] changed that is why there's some people
[2:25:43] that say we all
[2:25:45] go
[2:25:47] we shall not all
[2:25:49] die they have to be a type
[2:25:52] of how did Enoch went to the
[2:25:57] Rapture through the death he was
[2:26:00] changed div healing is to change
[2:26:03] something in your flesh in your body the
[2:26:05] Rapture
[2:26:07] also before going there we going to be
[2:26:11] changed to be as
[2:26:14] himam says
[2:26:18] put him in connection with his
[2:26:21] maker he will recover the
[2:26:25] fellow every Divine word becomes a
[2:26:27] living reality and he believes
[2:26:30] it
[2:26:33] says there's nothing they got nothing in
[2:26:36] them to believe
[2:26:38] it until God comes into the human heart
[2:26:42] a human
[2:26:43] heart a man is much better than BR much
[2:26:48] better
[2:26:49] than his
[2:26:52] reason he will think it out all
[2:26:55] out how can this
[2:26:58] be
[2:27:01] says and explain it all
[2:27:07] way but when God ever takes
[2:27:10] position in the human heart all the
[2:27:13] reasoning goes away God comes first amen
[2:27:19] in the
[2:27:19] beginning when God created a
[2:27:22] man to worship Him and
[2:27:26] leave God taking care of him Fe
[2:27:32] him man had perfect fellowship with God
[2:27:36] there was nothing
[2:27:37] wrong God came down in the evening and
[2:27:41] talk to Adam and Eve what a beautiful
[2:27:44] picture no arm

[2:27:57] was they didn't they didn't know what
[2:28:00] old age
[2:28:01] was they didn't know what being
[2:28:04] hurt nothing could hurt
[2:28:08] them they were in the presence of the
[2:28:10] omnipotent powers of
[2:28:12] God which had them in control gued them
[2:28:19] there was nothing could harm
[2:28:21] them
[2:28:24] says bring the man in the presence of
[2:28:26] the
[2:28:29] omnipotent when the omnipotent
[2:28:32] speaking always
[2:28:34] happen what a
[2:28:36] promise

[2:28:42] this
[2:28:45] morning little group of Believers could
[2:28:47] take away put aside the
[2:28:51] thought and get down to the
[2:28:54] fact to know that the great Jehovah

[2:29:58] Eden he was a mature
[2:30:02] God he had everything under his

[2:33:04] troubled do not be troubled he
[2:33:07] said believe in God believe also in
[2:33:13] me believe in God believe also in Jesus
[2:33:17] Christ he

[2:33:24] manions if it were not St I would have
[2:33:27] told
[2:33:28] you I go to prepare a place for you if I
[2:33:34] go and prepare a place for

[2:33:45] be as
[2:33:48] says
[2:33:50] now now fasten your seat
[2:33:53] belt
[2:33:55] says I never
[2:34:00] believe that heaven was somewhere where
[2:34:02] there's much
[2:34:05] buildings or
[2:34:07] many menion of hous is built with brick
[2:34:12] or where the walls are
[2:34:14] tappered where the that pain I never
[2:34:19] believed supernatural
[2:34:23] being we live in literal house or
[2:34:27] literal
[2:34:29] house I believe when
[2:34:31] Jesus was speaking John 14
[2:34:35] saying in my father's house there are
[2:34:38] many manions he will
[2:34:41] me a
[2:34:44] body says
[2:34:47] I don't believe they In
[2:34:49] Heaven There are many houses built with
[2:34:52] bricks painted with
[2:34:54] colors with Tails and all kind of
[2:34:58] things
[2:35:00] says I believe when he was saying John
[2:35:03] In My Father's House many
[2:35:06] mentions
[2:35:07] says he meant a
[2:35:10] body
[2:35:12] says this is
[2:35:15] deep I want this to
[2:35:17] sink
[2:35:19] says he meant a
[2:35:22] body a dwelling
[2:35:26] place for the scriptures verifies the
[2:35:28] same
[2:35:29] thing if this healthy
[2:35:32] tab we have one already Wai you see
[2:35:36] it mortal
[2:35:40] beings he's the only one who lives in
[2:35:43] the moral habitation Immortal beings
[2:35:48] live in Immortal habitation
[2:35:51] therefore the
[2:35:53] place that we
[2:35:55] go into until we return back it's not a
[2:35:59] place of brick moral
[2:36:03] clay precious
[2:36:06] stones it's a place a
[2:36:10] condition a
[2:36:13] condition that we move out of this
[2:36:18] that we live into into another
[2:36:21] dimension it's a
[2:36:23] house a
[2:36:25] tabernacle a dwelling place that is not
[2:36:28] made of human hands that is not made by
[2:36:33] Architects that was not drawn by the God
[2:36:37] himself the creator of Heaven and Earth
[2:36:40] went to
[2:36:42] build says Jesus said destroy this
[2:36:47] Temple and I will raise it up in three
[2:36:49] days and they
[2:36:51] thought he was speaking
[2:36:54] of while Jesus was not even speaking
[2:36:56] about Temple but he was speaking of his
[2:36:59] own
[2:37:03] body he's going to prepare a place for
[2:37:06] every
[2:37:07] believer that's at the
[2:37:11] time that the very moment we step out of
[2:37:14] this moral region we don't
[2:37:18] go we don't go out of into a
[2:37:21] myth or some Supernatural
[2:37:25] Spirit but we go into a tabernacle a
[2:37:28] dwelling
[2:37:30] place that might be right here in this
[2:37:35] Tac right
[2:37:38] now in the
[2:37:43] dimension radio acity or nothing can
[2:37:46] touch me what is that
[2:37:49] Dimension that is right here in this
[2:37:52] Tabernacle that is in this church this
[2:37:55] church there no radio
[2:37:58] activity or nothing can touch it says
[2:38:03] it's a
[2:38:04] state that was not made by human hands
[2:38:08] to get into that
[2:38:09] state you need to be born again because
[2:38:13] this
[2:38:14] body says is heavy to get into
[2:38:18] that we have to leave the he body to get
[2:38:23] in the body that will be mixed with
[2:38:27] everybody you be in the glorified body
[2:38:30] if you went your in the glorified body
[2:38:33] we as
[2:38:34] well will be like him we will be changed
[2:38:39] in the twinkling of an
[2:38:41] eye in a
[2:38:43] moment to get into that body
[2:38:49] says that
[2:38:52] promise it's a true
[2:38:56] promise have that
[2:39:00] hope work so that you can be much fruit
[2:39:03] even if hard work hard the Bible
[2:39:10] sayri to get into the promise because
[2:39:12] they still have a
[2:39:14] promise
[2:39:17] says
[2:39:20] listen it's prepared by God
[2:39:25] itself say he's not prepared by himself
[2:39:28] William
[2:39:30] bham didn't go to prepare a place for
[2:39:33] us but it's the Lord Jesus
[2:39:36] Christ the creator of heavens and
[2:39:39] earth

[2:40:23] say that we are looking at some mythical
[2:40:28] something way off under a million
[2:40:33] years that's the reason why I'm
[2:40:36] saying oh we are going we are going
[2:40:39] we're all going to die this is
[2:40:43] wrong

[2:40:47] there will be people that will be the
[2:40:48] type of
[2:40:51] Moses there will also be people that
[2:40:53] will be as a
