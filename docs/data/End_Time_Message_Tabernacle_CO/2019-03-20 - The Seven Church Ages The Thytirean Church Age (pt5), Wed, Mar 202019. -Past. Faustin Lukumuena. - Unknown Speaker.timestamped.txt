[11:10] profit import latesh was also taking
[11:13] control of the media renews you control
[11:16] the media but for tonight I want mainly
[11:20] to insist on last Sunday I put on what
[11:24] was the title
[11:30] strategic and political marriage
[11:33] political parties so tonight I'm gonna
[11:36] speak on a set and strategy of killing
[11:39] all marriages strategy certainly
[11:44] tripolymer yes we see that
[11:46] Damaso was a marriage epigrams Italy
[11:49] multi Terra we see also married Rosalie
[11:54] marriage like what we are doing is come
[12:00] second phase oh but look at marriage in
[12:03] a different perspective many synonyms
[12:06] annatto perspective that it's a strategy
[12:09] that Satan has taken advantage for
[12:12] killing people in strategically diabla
[12:15] usually spoke to watch villager so for
[12:17] my inspiration Allah permanence penis
[12:20] you political and strategic marriages
[12:23] are not from God
[12:24] my political strategy Libyan partying so
[12:28] if you want to get married you will ever
[12:31] marry don't have any strategy nepeta
[12:35] strategy don't have any political mind
[12:37] nearby ensures political as soon as you
[12:40] have such one of the things in front of
[12:43] the region deserves its attention be
[12:45] sure it's not from God
[12:46] Rajeev of a salon even parity and I can
[12:49] give you an example of many marriages
[12:51] repeal example the beaucoup de Mirage
[12:53] Jezebel with a hab Jezebel America was a
[12:56] strategical political the deeper
[12:59] strategic political Jezebel daughter
[13:01] Italia with jo harvelle Italia Vikram it
[13:06] was not from God save anybody here and
[13:10] what we want to emphasize tonight is the
[13:15] marriage between Samsung and de la la my
[13:19] agent assumption a Dalila so we are
[13:21] going to read again in the book of
[13:23] Judges chapter 16 we know the story but
[13:26] we have always to remind
[13:34] judges 16 1 to 7
[13:41] judge is 16 1 to 7 then when Samson to
[13:48] Gaza and so there are lot and went into
[13:51] her some some party book and it was
[13:58] toward the Gaza I'd saying Samsung is
[14:00] come higher and they come pass him in
[14:04] and laid wait for him all night in the
[14:08] gate of the city and were quiet all the
[14:10] night saying in the morning when it is
[14:13] day we shall kill him it is awesome so
[14:18] even in see a long to her to me isla
[14:22] partida live in listen kill to learn me
[14:28] and Sam son late till midnight and a
[14:31] horse at midnight and it took the doors
[14:34] of the gate of the city and a to post
[14:37] and went away with them Bob and all and
[14:40] put them upon his shoulders and carried
[14:42] them up to the top of a near that is
[14:45] before even in some sort of Cusco
[14:49] Melanie lapatin de la parte de la ville
[14:54] in the dough puto el arish avec la ba le
[14:59] mis hijos de paul le port also medellin
[15:01] turnkey of us
[15:03] and it came to pass afterward that he
[15:06] loved a woman in the valley of Sorek
[15:09] whose name was de la la la
[15:13] luckily my confirm de la vallee this
[15:16] erect a sunnah and the lords of the
[15:19] Philistine came up to her and to her and
[15:23] said unto her entice him and see where
[15:27] in his great strength night and by what
[15:31] means we may prevail against him that we
[15:35] may bind him to afflict him and we will
[15:39] give thee every one of us 1,100 pieces

[15:46] l VD / sadly if one consists a grant for
[15:50] a kimono poyo event le ly ly upon you
[15:54] mediate a new Tanaka all the sons PS
[15:58] dojo so we see here they finished and
[16:01] were very concerned by the strength of
[16:05] Samsung you know voyeuristically Phyllis
[16:07] native no more concern s universalism so
[16:09] they try to bind them whatever they try
[16:13] to do to success a defense always the
[16:15] Samsung had to prevail and Samsung are
[16:18] they - Jahnavi - uh so they kind of
[16:21] think what can we do is the demand a
[16:23] kiss can approval fail because if we
[16:26] don't come up with a good strategy but
[16:28] Scecina vampire in bond strategy is
[16:30] gonna finish all of us see what - Luda
[16:32] tree and their strategy the last mataji

[17:04] money popularity of popularity and women
[17:09] and in this case it was the case of de
[17:14] la la Villa so we go to verse 6 and

[19:52] Philistines saying come up this one's
[19:55] for he has shown me all his heart
[19:58] then the Lord of the Philistine came up
[20:00] unto her and brought money in the hand
[20:03] I will continue to eat people can read
[20:05] in French because in order story and she
[20:10] made him sleep upon her knees and she

[20:19] and she began to afflict him and his
[20:22] legs went from him and she said they
[20:25] Philistine be upon this samsung and he I
[20:28] walked out of his sleep and said I will
[20:31] go out as at other times before and
[20:34] shake myself and he wist not that the
[20:39] Lord was departed from him but the
[20:42] Philistine took him and put out his eyes
[20:45] and brought him down to Gaza and bound
[20:48] him with fetters of brass and he did
[20:51] grind in the prison house may the Lord
[20:55] are the blessing to the reading of the
[20:56] scripture he listening as I said I'm
[21:02] talking about certain strategy of
[21:05] killing two marriages led the Polish
[21:08] village last night adjacent on the
[21:10] geopolymer yard so for our people young
[21:14] people grown up alone don't take
[21:21] marriage as a light thing when a
[21:23] palomino always look at the advice from
[21:27] the Prophet regarded to Julie consider
[21:30] perfetto
[21:33] he told us so many things regarding
[21:36] marriages Maria he showed us marriage
[21:43] steps in vanilla the table Mirage
[21:46] he talked to us what not to do if you
[21:50] are not in the position to be involved
[21:53] in people's marriage and he told us if
[22:01] you want to succeed
[22:03] start with the word so just a quick
[22:09] recap from last Sunday in the master
[22:14] date Italian Church
[22:15] age paragraph 227 - tree dissolving the
[22:24] Bible just say that Arab married Jezebel
[22:26] ladies a macabre but Branham is telling
[22:31] us their main reason Mary Jezebel and he
[22:37] did it as a political maneuver to
[22:40] strengthen his kingdom and secure and
[22:51] this is the fourth age coming from the
[22:55] Third Age is linking them together by
[23:01] saying that is exactly what the church
[23:04] did when it married and it was not for a
[23:12] good reason
[23:14] it was a strategy to kill the faith so
[23:20] many times when there is marriage
[23:23] there is a strategy behind and that
[23:27] strategies leading always to death he
[23:29] said to you alimony but they got
[23:33] together for political reasons though
[23:37] they put a spiritual heir to see people
[23:44] get married pastor we follow all these
[23:47] steps we did all be good trying to put a
[23:50] good head a good impression and to each
[23:54] member named Priscilla but the reason
[23:57] was not right and what a Bonham said
[24:01] also when Ahab married Jezebel for
[24:05] political reasons
[24:09] he sold his birthright she loved on this
[24:12] body nation see sometimes the political
[24:16] marriage polomoche political it's just
[24:19] leading people to sell their birthright
[24:21] condition Miranda
[24:24] paragraph 229 - one this is just a recap
[24:28] from last Sunday now when Ahab married
[24:33] Jezebel he allowed her to take the state
[24:39] money and erect two huge houses of
[24:41] worship allah permit approval hundred
[24:44] large majorities of biblical considered
[24:47] tombliboo
[24:50] pakistan table so we see here through
[24:55] marriage you know why anything at all
[24:57] you marry i people also take advantage
[24:59] of finances I'm gonna marry this one
[25:05] because he is worldly financially this
[25:11] one even if he is a spiritual if he
[25:15] doesn't have money in Apollo the way I
[25:17] see it
[25:18] Lamia don't you look I will not accept
[25:20] you in the parts of this lab all of
[25:22] those are strategy people are building
[25:24] the Sadducees only statistically don't
[25:27] want to constrict but God is looking at
[25:29] your motive always and your objective
[25:32] regarded to JoVE automotive objective
[25:35] every couple starting without money
[25:39] akeem akio isono and god will visit them
[25:43] down the whole valley visit osama then
[25:46] those looking for money without even
[25:50] knowing where the money's coming from
[25:51] some do ask anima
[25:53] even among the believers today and
[25:55] familiar people are associated with
[25:58] witchcraft in is also a very magic and
[26:01] so forth they can give you an impression
[26:04] they have money
[26:05] LM fishing when they really don't part
[26:07] nachiappan you will find yourself in the
[26:10] trap of the devil with allegory to
[26:12] Vitali PhD and in order to avoid those
[26:14] things
[26:15] elevated to the show you have to depend
[26:17] only on your God would've listened
[26:19] multiple have your own personal
[26:21] experience simple experience and when
[26:25] Constantine and the church married he
[26:30] gave the church buildings and set up
[26:32] altars and images and organized a
[26:35] hierarchy
[26:36] that had already been shaping up Aladdin
[26:39] led Batman Lisa he had confidence Oh
[26:43] tell a DiMaggio organ is Ileana she aquí
[26:47] la Vida job um prepare a when Jezebel
[26:50] got the power of the state behind her
[26:55] you see you go into marriage wanted all
[26:59] Yuma yes
[26:59] powerless but when you get in marriage
[27:03] you get the power of what you want in a
[27:07] marriage for Bullock L visited on
[27:09] Somalia that's how when Jezebel get the
[27:12] power of the state behind she forced now
[27:18] her religion on the people and kill the
[27:23] Prophet and the priests of God what
[27:28] caused it it was a marriage then they
[27:33] gave her the opportunity to impose her
[27:35] religion operated before him possess an
[27:38] illusion in the master date Italian
[27:41] Church age paragraph 65 what upon him
[27:46] said now what did he say over here to
[27:51] this tonight the same thing that I have
[27:56] did Aqaba they say I have to strengthen
[27:59] his kingdom before T fearsome why you
[28:02] married Jezebel this idolatrous
[28:06] to strengthen his kingdom what if you're
[28:09] someone who get more strength into
[28:11] Israel
[28:12] and that's what the church is it trying
[28:15] is the same you see where they are
[28:19] trying to make a Bible way Lois aunt
[28:21] Elyssa de ferran be blue every out next
[28:24] year in 1962 that it's a Bible that will
[28:32] please the Jews in biblical it will
[28:35] please the Catholic and the place the
[28:38] protesters and that's what the results
[28:43] of the nice ian council you can say
[28:49] anything
[28:50] this is how even people try to find in
[28:53] the message becomes a commemoration I
[28:54] said it will be done put aside some
[28:56] codes and the preach only what is gonna
[29:00] please everybody we thank God for His
[29:06] Prophet because when he was oppressed to
[29:10] pull out some tapes he said I'm not
[29:16] gonna pull back any paragraph 75 when
[29:23] I'm called a hypocrite anybody who gets
[29:29] into political marriage with political
[29:33] strategy it's a hypocrite selling his
[29:38] very birth right so part of 82 and she
[29:47] an Israelite bowing before an idol
[29:53] that's exactly what Constantine did when
[29:56] he formed the Catholic Church he brought
[30:02] paganism over in the Christian church
[30:09] and the Christian bowing to idols that's
[30:16] exactly the duck age again duck age of
[30:22] Israel duck age of the church bowing to
[30:29] idols so that's pretty much what in big
[30:37] lines what we spoke on Sunday and we end
[30:45] up with the coat that brother one I'm
[30:49] Savannah moody in the message the spoken
[30:52] word is the original seed only massage
[30:55] novel panelists most original of a

[31:03] you start with the word come on this is
[31:07] really the key to it this is Eva Marie
[31:10] Lachlan Ursula and I can even say this
