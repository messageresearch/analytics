of God you're gonna read in Luke chapter 19. verse 1 to 10. in the name of Jesus Christ foreign foreign foreign foreign there was a name a man named zakash which was a chief among the publicans and it was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was he could not for the Press because it was leader of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him the case make haste and come down for today I must buy at that house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all remember saying that he was gone to be guessed with a man that is thinner in the case too then said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold and Jesus say unto him this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he also is the son of Abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to serve that which was lost amen I you may be seated may God bless you if you can create your brother God bless you amen good to see you too amen tell your brother I love you goodbye tell your brother I love you tell your sister I love you amen let that come from from the bottom of your heart amen are you happy this morning amen foreign from Lexington [Music] [Applause] thank you so much your brother be welcome and be among your brothers the house of the Lord amen how many people love the word of God this morning amen foreign because God being the word we were in him before the foundation of the world we were still in him and as we are here on Earth we're identifying ourselves with the word amen amen I thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity also thank our pastor who gave us the opportunity to speak to this church he went for the funeral of his brother little brother he has asked us to help a little bit as he's gone I always consider that as an honor may God bless him amen uh uh abundance before to go into this subject I have a scripture that I wanted to read the tower that I will be preaching this morning the K is the businessman in English just support my English with many mistakes now but not to not hold you very long uh [Music] usually I very sat down when I performed he didn't finish his thought if I was going to preach ER or I'd be I will be sure to get you out within six hours [Music] energy if I was going to preacher I will be sure to get you out within six hours that's a short sermon amen huh yes on purpose six hours who are ready for six hours business here knocking the song Bad playing yeah something I don't really don't say significance that means we don't have to go beyond that no this is the Lisa I just read this because you see yeah there's a lot of people complaining it is why are they preaching so long you know the preaching or the sermon is only to last for 45 minutes [Music] it's true the preaching or the sermon can last for 45 minutes what about what the prophet said [Music] [Music] dog is we are here we are here in the highest businessman that's our title for today I'll do my best to not keep you for long for so long I really suffer to find this subject when the pastor asked me to preachers what am I going to preach I didn't find anything to preach at the church I want you to sleep and I couldn't sleep properly yeah and uh early in the morning I was convinced that I will talk about this little subject my prayer and I pray this is the prayer of each one of you amen amen foreign [Music] [Music] you won't find the name Rebecca in the Bible amen amen all that is just to tell us he is the glasses to really understand the Bible amen amen is the glasses because the prophet says a prophet is is built in a way that you can go 10 million years back you can go way back in the beginning you see Moses wrote The Genesis Genesis and he wasn't even living in that time he was able to go beyond the times and everything that the prophet says foreign how the the sick was getting healed how the blind the cripples could walk Rebecca and Rebecca in the scripture Israel was waiting for a prophet he was waiting for a messiah and when the Messiah will come Elizabeth it will do exactly the work that Jesus was doing foreign [Music] [Music] verse 8. Justice they did not Devastation stood and said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor is and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold I restore him foreign [Music] and he was very busy with his own businesses and for him conscious depression according to him when Jesus and he was listening or the miracle was taking place was getting fulfilled in pregnancy foreign foreign as you and one day Lamar conference was the Fulfillment of the scriptures they were waiting foreign amen amen who knows may this message for our mothers and our sisters may this message revolutionize our home you will see that in our Bible offered the show's extraordinary you see women have done extraordinary things if we have to talk about Sarah still for parlay if you have to talk about roots if we talk about rehab if you have to talk about all those women has something to do as well even though they can't preach but with the gift that God is even by the prayers listen to what the prophet says I won't leave my husband keep living the same way I'm just gonna pray she really prayed and then she was praying forever the prophet said that the Christians realized the power they have when they start praying says [Music] when the weakest Hallelujah I know this morning this morning they pray for situation in their lives maybe your husband maybe you're praying for a brother may you praying for yourself the children what Abraham says there's something that God has done for Rebecca God is able to do it for you as well amen because if he's God he cannot change his ways God is not a man so that he can forget things am I sorry amen amen and what happened and the the night before as Rebecca was praying around five maybe five a.m maybe Rebecca was tired she wanted to go sleep a little bit absolutely [Music] she saw her husband standing up somebody still living your husband's standing up around six somewhere it came and we talk about it himself and perfume himself but today what's going on and she didn't know and something was starting to talk inside of him eh yeah told himself I've heard that Jesus is coming this way I also want to go and see him I don't want to miss you yes he's going to go through this way I don't want to let him go and you may conclude yourself says in this sermon the cast businessman or paragraph then to a fibonometry uh paragraph 23 the Brotherhood says [Applause] and Rebecca was persuaded when she saw Jesus Christ talking to the people about their heart's problem [Music] s and that was happening exactly as he said himself without failing even one time and truly that's a bad thing to try to judgment before you hear him he will never do that amen many times you are still guilty of that we're here talk to him not the appropriate opinion we don't pass our opinion on him by somebody hurts his opinions and it's not a good thing how to go see for ourselves listen for yourself yeah and you see [Music] he's okay uh [Music] what am I gonna do I have a chance to see him important members are not paying attention to you he knows he knows what you what you have need of amen amen and once the car was walking he reach a certain places and you see that business somewhere what's going to happen on the street people who come to take Trashies are not there yeah oh my those are things that have to happen amen amen and when he arrived he was thinking that his wife because his wife what's gonna happen what is it going to happen today is paying attention without knowing it was the answer for the prayer that a night of prayer that we used to do that disappeared in our homes that's not astonished and destroy the house [Music] he was going to Samaria because he was supposed to go through America and Israel only received the message I was going to Samaria why forever because there are three races [Music] [Applause] it is before they were also waiting for the Messiah and when they reached there he saw that woman said family mother [Music] and she was taking one yeah give me water yes at the formula prostitute where the world there are no relationships between him and uh Elizabeth we have segregation the head segregation and the wife how you would you mind and ask me worried as a Samaritan Jesus answers that we don't donate you will be the first person to give water and the time is coming when it's not gonna be about this in that state [Music] in amen as the the gentles but those who were waiting for the coming of the Lord he was the Jew and the Samaritans they're waiting for the first coming we as the general [Music] just to have more time it's almost 11 30. amen amen do you love Jesus after that foreign what did you see she said she's so high God was Discerning she really wanted her husband to stand in front of Jesus and he believed that he was going to Jericho there is something taking place basketball [Music] [Music] and Rebecca after praying through the night just remember God is answering prayer amen amen amen foreign when I ask you how are you feeling still it is a pray foreign [Music] my dear you know usually son develops these are the complex people build up that kind of complexes you know just on hearing something it's a second and that's what's the case about what he heard about it he went there to tell him something oh foreign [Music] we can pray for you [Music] [Music] the word foreign amen [Music] praise God this morning you never change why [Music] uh the Bible said that Jesus was born was died uh poor so that you can

and if she did all those to Speed on may I pray for this girl it said no problem s but unfortunately it didn't happen and when people noticed that brother Brandon was there lessons they started making

another problem with the cash it's a case his problem was he had a lot of money he had a lot of relationships let me just read Brother Bruno paragraph transition paragraph 34 with that uh before I read the other scriptures [Applause] he had favor with the churches and the Kiwanis foreign if something goes down he could have favorite to Men of God and all those people my friends says to have
