[4:27] [Music]
[4:41] amen
[4:43] it has read
[4:45] ecclesiastes
[4:47] [Music]
[4:49] eight
[4:51] one to eight
[5:06] ecclesiastes 8
[5:09] who is as the wise man
[5:14] and who knoweth
[5:16] the interpretation of a thing
[5:20] a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine
[5:26] and the boldness of his face
[5:29] shall be changed
[5:32] i counsel thee to keep the king's
[5:35] commandment
[5:38] and that
[5:39] in regard of the oath of god
[5:47] be not hasty to go out
[5:49] of his sight
[5:52] stand not
[5:54] in an evil thing
[5:57] for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth
[6:04] him where the word of the king is
[6:08] there is power
[6:12] and who
[6:13] may say unto him
[6:15] what doest thou
[6:20] whoso keepeth
[6:22] the commandment shall feel no evil thing
[6:27] and a wise man's heart
[6:30] discerneth both time
[6:32] and judgment
[6:36] because to every purpose
[6:39] there is time
[6:41] and judgment
[6:44] therefore the misery of man is great
[6:47] upon him
[6:51] for he knoweth not
[6:53] that which shall be
[6:56] for who can tell him
[6:58] when it shall be
[7:03] there is no man
[7:05] that hath power over the spirit
[7:09] to retain the spirit
[7:13] neither hath he power in the day of
[7:16] death
[7:19] and there is no discharge in that war
[7:26] neither shall wickedness
[7:28] deliver those that are given to it
[7:32] amen
