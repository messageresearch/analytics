[30:58] by himself
[31:02] [Music]
[31:05] just for the introduction of my thoughts
[31:11] I'm referring to the scripture of the
[31:13] prophet
[31:14] churches
[31:22] the prophet says this
[31:29] is the largely please defense in a a
[31:32] church ages of uh Ephesus
[31:42] he says this
[31:44] luckily
[31:47] is
[31:52] given me of the law whereby I was able
[31:55] to determine the messenger for each age
[32:00] is most scriptural one
[32:04] it's a tunicles
[32:06] is the scriptural key
[32:13] is
[32:16] in fact it might be the it might be
[32:19] called the Keystone of the Bible
[32:24] the Keystone
[32:43] it's like the whole Bible is based upon
[32:47] that key
[32:48] a sequestered clay what is the key
[32:52] salary
[32:57] it's the Revelation that God never
[33:01] changes
[33:07] and that is ways are as unchangeable at
[33:12] least
[33:18] the whole Bible based upon that
[33:21] Foundation
[33:24] God never changes
[33:30] ways of doing things doesn't change
[33:37] gives true scripture according to that
[33:42] says in Hebrew 13 8
[33:45] it says Jesus
[33:51] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[33:55] forever
[33:57] and the second scripture says
[34:00] upon this scripture that I will speak on
[34:03] say Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes
[34:07] against 14 to 15.
[34:13] I know
