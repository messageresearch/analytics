[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] so we look to you
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:10:55] it has been quite some time since we've
[1:10:57] been here
[1:11:00] but we are still striving to continue
[1:11:04] pressing the battle ain't no continuing
[1:11:07] still looking for the rapture
[1:11:10] believing
[1:11:44] amen i want to turn today into the
[1:11:47] scripture to the book of romans chapter
[1:11:48] twelve
[1:12:01] i want to go to the book of romans
[1:12:03] chapter 12 verse 1.
[1:12:06] and i want to speak from verses one and
[1:12:08] two today
[1:12:12] this is paul speaking to the roman
[1:12:14] church
[1:12:17] and he said i beseech you therefore
[1:12:19] brethren
[1:12:36] they would bring a lamb and that lamb
[1:12:37] would die
[1:12:40] and that would be a dead sacrifice
[1:12:45] but when paul comes to the new testament
[1:13:00] holy and acceptable unto god
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:30] it means not to
[1:13:57] do not be conformed
[1:14:40] acceptable
[1:14:45] amen god bless you this morning
[1:14:48] you may be seated today
[1:14:51] praise the lord
[1:14:53] i want to speak to you this morning
[1:15:07] and the only way that we can present
[1:15:09] ourselves
[1:15:12] as a living sacrifice
[1:15:15] we must be willing to do it
[1:15:19] i want to start with this statement out
[1:15:21] of the message the lamb and the dove is
[1:15:51] to anchor
[1:15:52] he said but you've got to read the bible
[1:15:54] in the spirits
[1:15:57] you've got to be in the mood
[1:16:01] and you've got to love to read it
[1:16:31] and jesus thanked god and said father
[1:16:38] i thank thee that thou has hit these
[1:16:39] things
[1:16:41] through the wise and the prudence
[1:16:46] has revealed them
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:58] you don't have to be somebody in this
[1:17:00] world to know god
[1:17:04] you just have to have a willing heart
[1:17:08] you don't have to be rich
[1:17:10] you don't have to be educated
[1:17:13] you just need a willing heart
[1:17:28] we look at this scripture that we read
[1:17:30] this morning
[1:17:33] paul is coming to the conclusion
[1:17:36] that he's proven beyond all doubts
[1:17:41] that because of jesus christ
[1:17:45] that our sacrifice has been brought to
[1:17:47] us under grace
[1:17:52] and paul is using an allegory
[1:18:24] he
[1:18:35] that we are only righteous in jesus
[1:18:37] christ
[1:18:49] i don't care what preacher someone
[1:18:51] bought the book
[1:19:20] but that is not what appeases to justice
[1:19:25] for a god counted inequity
[1:19:33] today
[1:20:02] jesus christ
[1:20:04] just given back to the church
[1:20:08] amen now i want to say this today
[1:20:11] paul tells us that we are only righteous
[1:20:13] in jesus christ
[1:20:16] and
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:48] but because of what christ is
[1:23:04] is
[1:24:10] [Applause]
[1:24:42] is
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:06] the church
[1:26:10] that god never fills a man with a desire
[1:26:12] to sin
[1:26:13] it is the power
[1:26:15] of the desert god never gives a man a
[1:26:17] desire it can't journal
[1:26:19] to make grace a disgrace
[1:26:23] but it gives you a desire to present
[1:26:25] your body
[1:26:27] privilege
[1:26:29] it's a living sacrifice
[1:26:32] we understand in the old testament
[1:26:48] is
[1:27:15] but now when it comes to the new
[1:27:17] testament
[1:27:20] is bringing us into the news
[1:27:24] and he's saying that you need to be
[1:27:25] included into this

[1:29:48] sacrifice i love donkey vice

[1:30:03] as your soul presents
[1:30:33] it could not be a lame
[1:30:37] sacrifice
[1:30:40] god didn't want a living sacrifice

[2:35:36] for the arrest

[2:35:51] of longer this allows unto
[2:35:59] so as uh the couple are still having
[2:36:01] their meeting downstairs
[2:36:05] please don't make noise between the two
[2:36:08] doors because it will go downstairs
[2:36:16] quietly dismiss
[2:36:19] it
[2:36:20] or wait
[2:36:29] because the couple will be preparing to
[2:36:31] come back at the tree
[2:36:34] prepared
[2:36:36] [Music]
[2:36:47] so please take a moment to wait for
[2:36:50] lunch to be served
