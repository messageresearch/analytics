and after that we're going to read uh act chapter 2 verse 3839 at at the end we're going to read Mark chapter uh Mark chapter 16: 17 to 18 let's start Romans chapter 8 verse 28 we bless the name of the Lord we because we noticed the song leader we was really under when he was singing everything works for good works together it's in not a way this is our topic glory to God Romans chter 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us I'm going to try to uh read again verse 31 what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us spare not his own son but delivering him up for us all as shall he not with him also fely give us all things who shall lay anything to the church of the God's elect it is God that justified glory to God let's take act chapter 2 to go quickly verse 38-39 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Mark 16 mark Mark chapter 16:1 17 this son shall follow them that believe me in my name they shall lay hands they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover glory to God you may be SE it may God add the blessing to the reading of his word our little topic tonight it's nothing can destroy the purpose of God if you don't want to say uh the purpose we can say the goal or the objective of God nothing can destroy the purpose of God glory to God thank you Lord if you ask this question why do you come to church tonight we are sure that you come to church tonight expence is to find to discover new experiences New Hope because we believe life itself is a burden that is why in life you have to help each other glory to God but we come to church as David said I'm glad when they said let us go to the house of the Lord It's sure God is here but God cannot lie it's written the word of the Lord where two or three are my name I will among them I'm very sure that Jesus Christ is among us tonight glory to God if Jesus Christ is not here tonight we are gathered in vain but we are very certain he's here when Jesus Christ is here he here to deliver he's here to save he's here to comfort that is why we coming to church to find New Hope glory to God thank you Lord thank you Lord I'm going to take a little uh story to illustrate something we can ask this question what makes us different from the world what makes us different from Christian in the denomination to answer that little question we're going to give a little Legend glory to God but I'm speaking of it of it in this uh book I know my redeemer liveth preached in 1958 April 6 April paragraph 13 glory to God thank you Lord It's a little leg I was told a little Robin glory to God I'm going to read when you know that little legend of the robin it was a little brown bird according to the legend until G Friday it means it happened that Good Friday there was a man one man dying alone and we all know it was the Lord Jesus Christ there was no one else to help him he was all alone he was nail in to to the cross and it was told and the little brown bird was trying to free him from the cross ding back and forth to the nail to the thones that on his head he got his little breast all red with blood and since then it's been read glory to God this is a little Shield that I want to know I want to have if you notice that little Robin when is will pick pick picking himself just beneath that little red layer of feather is Blackness is the rest of his feathers no matter how good we trying to be we are still Sinners but just little red shield is that all to to T to make him different from other birds glory to God that little Shield red shield is the grace of God we are nothing brothers and sister it's the grace of God that protect us to God to all the glory goes to God glory to God thank you Lord we should not forget our topic nothing can destroy the purpose of God we can say the purpose glory to God thank you Lord paragraph 11 the purpose of God am we have we live for a purpose let's read all together if you drove your God to come here tonight this Auto automobile was not made just to see if you could he didn't waste the materials it was put here for a purpose to serve a purpose the clothing that you wear was not just to see if somebody could fashion something it was for a purpose the food and the trees glory to God no matter how little you are no matter how big you are how important you are how less important you are you are here to serve a purpose just as just as my finger is here for a purpose my nail on the fingers for my ey and every part of my body is here to ser he was just not push here to see what it will look like but it was the plan of God to put it this way amen we are placed here for a purpose and nothing can defeat that purpose if I ask you this question we uh here jally this there's God and there's Satan that we know Satan is is powerful but the god that we serve is allmighty all powerful we know here in this earth there's sickness but the Healer and the sickness who existed before he was the Healer glory to God thank you Lord the purpose of God has to be fulfilled God has a purpose for us glory to God for God to fulfill that purpose God has a plan God has a program God has his way of doing things glory to God it's written in the word love is corrective for God to correct us he had a whep to God and we don't we we don't we we we know that the plan of God the attitude of God the program of God it his word glory to God thank you Lord is's wonderful deserve our Glory he deserve all glory worship amen I want you to notice to record this in your heart tonight pay attention paragraph 10 now we want to bring in our spirit that nothing can destroy until the purpose for for who has created us is not fulfilled can you say Amen to this now we want to bring something in our Spirits nothing can harm us until the purpose of God that God has put nothing that can happen we are being we have been created for a purpose this church was built here for a purpose this Foundation was not dark like that but for a purpose what is the purpose of God for the church it is written by the Lord God wants a church without wrinkle without nothing like that that's the purpose of God that is the objective of God as we read in act 2:39 the purpose of God is to fill us with the Holy Spirit and nothing can destroy us God will fill us with the Holy Spirit to God thank you Lord the purpose of God he wants to show us Mir Mark 16 Miracles wonders God will do it amen nothing can stop God the purpose of God will be fulfilled God is requires Perfection it's written by the word be perfect as your father's heavenly father is perfect if you look at the church today we can say can God will be able to fulfill that purpose but God will do it but not without inurance we have an enemy our enemy is not a brother our enemy is not a sister our enemy is the devil Satan amen I want to tell you Satan the Devil is is mighty there's only one being can fight the devil it's God himself a pastor cannot do it brother K cannot do it man cannot do it but God can do it that's the reason why God has a purpose the purpose of God is to fill us the Holy Spirit there's the only way to overcome the devil is to have the Holy Spirit in you that is why that's the objective of God for us that's the purpose of God glory to God thank you Lord how God can do to bring his church to Perfection you got to explain it in the Bible we I know that a pagan somebody who never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ in some way he has a Stony heart God said in his word this is how I'm going to do it to bring my church to Perfection to bring every brother to Perfection I will take away the ston ARs that's the first thing I will do who will do it the almighty God glory to God thank you Lord and secondly I will put a fleshly heart a flexible heart to the word and inside of the hearts of Flesh God said will bring a new spirit glory to God thank you Lord It's not over yet after the new spirit God said I will continue because my people has to reach Perfection I will bring the Holy Spirit on them inside that new spirit God will fulfill it my brothers and sisters glory to God but us we are uh we can fail but God can not fair that's why I'm advising you don't touch the hands of God but ask God to hold us because we are but [Applause] isable glory to God the objective of God God want us to be Warriors God want us to be Warriors glory to God is explaining in this book glory to God you can say well I have to become a warrior a warrior how can you do that is explaining it he said what is a warrior is somebody when is wrong when he's fallen he doesn't stay down he will stand let me tell you my brothers and sisters I'll Trust more somebody who make a mistake and fix it instead of a person that never made a mistake because somebody who never made a mistake in in such in another way hypocrite because somewhere the Bible says we fail one one way or another we are all failable there's only one thing that protect us is The Shield is the blood of Jesus Christ let tell you something even if you live good if you don't accept the blood of Jesus Christ you are nothing because outside of Jesus Christ we are nothing we are here with God here with Christ here with Christ without Jesus Christ we are nothing the Lord Jesus Christ is our priority glory to God thank you Lord the Lord is deserve our praise God showed it in Genesis because Genesis means beginning how you going to do it let me read it for you Genesis paragraph 49 in Genesis the first chapter the spirit of God was moving over the the Earth the world the the world was void there was nothing but darkness and Chaos that was horrible but God transform it toen glory to God that's the objective of God that's the purpose of God God took this great chaos in Genesis he changed it into a Garden of Eden by his word that is why we are being formed by the word of God when we were in the world we were living whatsoever but God called us God transformed us God purifi us he had Justified Us by his word it change our life to a good Eden glory to God thank you Lord but God want to give us something the objective of God for his church the objective of God for every Believers of the god want us to be Christians true Christian no simple Christian no just Christian by name because a Christian is a life being a Christian is a way of walking being a Christian is a way of talking being a Christian is a way of acting is a way of reacting glory to God thank you Lord because Christian means is like somebody who lives The Life of Christ glory to God thank you Lord a Christian brother sisters when you accept the Lord Jesus Christ certainly you're Christian but it's just by name because it's a process brothers and sisters there's three steps justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have to keep on walking glory to God to be a true Christian because there something that makes a difference a simple Christian and a true Christian and genuine Christian and a Christian filled with the Holy Spirit what makes the difference there's only one thing was making the difference we're going to read it Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 phy Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the g of Hell will not Prevail against it amen what makes the difference between a simple Christian and a Christian filled with the holy spirit it's the Revelation you can have your Bible that's good but it's the re that give light but K cannot give you that Revelation the pastor cannot give you that Revelation but there's only one person that can give you that revelation God reveal his word to whosoever it's God himself glory to God thank you Lord and that Revelation it's shelter a shelter sh shelter glory to God God has a shelter for his children like he was doing in the Garden of Eden when he was creating Eden Eve he placed them behind the Fortress and that Fortress was nothing less than the word of God the word of God is his Fortress glory to God but God is a god of paradox glory to God the the the Shir of God is made of f f furthers God is an eagle we are safe under his further God is very sure of his shelter he was making a declaration St PSM 91 it's just to show you the tress of this shelter he that dwell under the shadow of the almighty dwell under the the F of the Almighty I I'll say to the Lord he's my refuge and my Fortress is your the Lord is your Refuge tonight he's a sure Fortress is's the Lord glory to God my God in him will I trust surely shall deliver thee From The Snare of the flowers and from the Nome of Pence the the the sh is made of he will cover you with his feathers and you will find Refuge under his feathers Wings his fness is a shield and the buckler thou shall not be afraid for the not for the arrow that F day for the pestilent that walks in the darkness for the destrction that wasted at the FEA that sh thousand shall fall at your and 10,000 at your right that shall not come near With Thine Eyes will you will lose and see the reward of the wicked what a sure shelter we can tell the devil don't look at the appearance because the feather The Shield is made of feather glory to the Lord Jesus Christ the lord is worthy of the praise worthy of all Praises glory to God thank you Lord amen but the devil always triy to make to bring inur inurance to the word of the plan of God he always trying to imit God by unbelief but nothing can destroy the plan of God the plan of God the purpose of God the objective of God is to have a church without spot without wrinkle without anything like that there's no enough demon in hell that can stop it truly the devil is mighty but our God is Almighty the objective of God is for us to have good health that is the reason why you can claim your good house tonight because that's the will of God for you to to be to be in good health GL to God thank you Lord the Lord is worthy of Our Praise amen glory to God the devil always tried to hinder the the purpose of God but God always try to do something I know well taught here well taught the servant Jacob had a vision it was the vision of a later of Jacob a rout from the Earth to heaven was saying the part the bottom part of that letter on the earth we found Christ to show you how sure is the shelter how the Christian is is safe is the letter that brings you to heaven Jacob was saying glory to God it means when the enemy comes on the earth he will meet Christ thank you Lord heaven in glory it's God but all along the hill they are angels we are truly secure to God thank you Lord the Lord is worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of Our Praise Oh Glory to God now we can ask a question I out come brother Ken when I was not believer I didn't have all these problem after accepting the Lord Jesus I started having a lot of problems let me tell you this little answer God is in us not the way I think not the way you think but God is in US according to his word God Is Love by his word it's written in the word of God the righteous many always come to the right many are the Affliction of the righteous many are the Affliction of the righteous why for God to keep his purpose God has a purpose God has his way glory to God I know you up because was saying this since you a child of [Music] God if you do something wrong God will whip you because love is corrective God has weeps but say the weeps of God are demons are demons that's some say was a servant of God because God so loved you God can talk to you and you don't want to listen God can allow a demon to stke you it's for your own good glory to God thank you Lord because you are a son of God of God to God but the devil always try to hind the plan of God glory to God I want to read something glory to God I'll take the example of servant Moses God had a purpose for Moses it was a deliverer of the people of Israel Satan was trying to hinder the plan of God glory to God thank you Lord and joed trying to preserve Moses but when they get to a certain time he gave up Moses to his creator paragraph 31 they place that little baby in the little 31 glory to God friends and sir brothers and sisters the the the believer of the Gospel believer of a gospel is under the control of the Holy Ghost why was saying if you have something that is not working correctly you find yourself in uh hardship you have to do something you have to make sure are you in the in the right path if you have something to fix fix it but if you notice you realize that you're in a good path stay there God will do something because brother was saying at the Crossing of the road when you meet a mountain on your way you cannot go left and right stay there because God will do something God can do something let me tell you something brother let's take an example the Sun the shadow can hide the light of the Sun the cloud can hide the light of the Sun but it cannot quen or stop the sun will continue to shine hallelujah hallelujah if in your life you have CL don't worry God is God he can do anything he the Jehovah Miracle what can you do don't forget that the cloud can hide the the light of the Sun but it cannot destroy the light of the Sun a good morning God will send the wind and he will take away and you have to highlight brother and sisters the sun will continue to shine amen glory to God thank you Lord the Lord is worthy all praise worth of our glory glory to God yes glory to God on there was a lot of uh waves glory to God a lot of waves in this life my brother but when if God called angels to watch over it don't worry he will get you out of it amen amen notice that little thing was there with made off of hood I can not I can imagine why they put that little material around it glory to God it was pitched now notice with me my brothers and sisters Moses on the River where there was two crocodiles that was heating the the the bodies of those babies when Moses was in the water old crocodile start to stick his noise up there oh what a smell he backed off and we watch him and all at once he becomes frustrated and he go goes away why am there was a crocodile coming to smell the little Moses when says I can see it what what said I can see it God gives him the ability to see amen glory to God he got frustrated and he went away why why why brothers and sisters God always respect his word is written in the word of God the angel of the Lord Camp around them that fears and keep them away from danger that's the truth look at Moses on the water if you look at with your caral eyes Moses was all alone glory to God glory to God say why why the crocodile went away Gabriel sitting up on the top of the AR floating down the river that's the reason that they couldn't touch it he will be give back to the ones that gave it paragraph 32 that is the way it is tonight God let his Angel have watch over us Believers of the Gospel the redeemers the angel of the Lord Camp about I want to highlight for you the angel of God about to God Gabriel was at the Riverside Gabriel was asking God where are you going to be standing yourself glory to God the Lord deserve our Glory God answered I'm going to be standing at the receiving end at the receiving end to reing end God was at the end of the road to receive Moses god thank you Lord we are in the Journey of Life on this shaky River we are surrendered by Angels they don't go back and forth to protect us sometime when you drive on the road something happened and you see that God SP you from an accident i' would like to tell you tonight those are angels of God sometimes the angel taking the wheel there's a supernatural things but God cannot lie they are there with you every time when you walk you you're not conscious the angel are there when you sleep the angel are there brothers and sisters God is great nobody can destroy the purpose of God glory to God thank you Lord the Lord deserve our Glory he deserve Our Praise nothing can destroy the plan of God to God you can ask a question certainly brother K nothing can twk the Plan of God why what happened in the life of Moses then glory to God God had a purpose God had a purpose for Moses he wanted to show that he is controlling the crocodiles and everything even Pharaoh the devil was using to destroy the plan of God to destroy the purpose of God God wanted to show his might his power God takes his child he put him in the world of pharaoh to to to raise him up not just that he allowed that his own mother to be paid God is wonderful it's God of paradox it's something that you cannot believe but is true then don't worry Don't Be Afraid God is more than able to take you to the Rapture because God is God he's the most powerful he's the most powerful he's the most Mighty nothing can stop his plan he takes Moses he say say you want to kill him he placed Moses in the hands of the devil God is the mighty one can you believe that brother s when I'm explaining I don't want to talk about Moses I'm talking about you Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever am don't be afraid because God is there amen glory to God thank you Lord Lord is worthy Our Praise amen glory to God we're going to take some other examples if you take the example of Jonah he was a true servant of God God had a purpose for him to go preach there in Neva glory to God Jonas took a boat to go to Tes brothers and sisters it's good to have a prophet let me tell you something if brother did not come with this message they wouldn't have any Rapture outside of this message because to go to the Rapture you have to have the faith of the Rapture and to have the faith of the Rapture you have to have the spirit of God in you as was saying this is the way to do it enough word enough spirit for it that is why time God had revealed all the word seven tunders everything is revealed it's not for nothing to give us the rupture faith that is why outside of this message there's no Rapture if you are in this message take the message seriously there will not be a second turn either you go to the Rapture or you going to hell because you'll be part of the foolish virgin they won't be part of the Bride the fish version in the denomination that's the reason why the very serious thing it's the gospel take it seriously don't content Yourself by saying in the message I'm in the message but look at your life through the mirror of the word the mirror of the word is not a church it's not brother Ken it's not the old sister but the mirror of the word the word look at your life every day in the word to see how you can dress if you're a brother don't dress like the world don't dress like the world as the word is asking you to do speak the word act according to the word as the word said it glory to God thank you Lord yes brothers and sisters nothing can destroy the purpose of God for you what is the purpose of God for you is to fill us the Holy Spirit saying God has no will to fill us the Holy Spirit rewarded ourselves to be filled God is is more willing to do it what you have to do you sanc yourself because they brought himself to prepare that is tonight consecrate yourself because there's a secret in God if there sin a burden that beset you so easily come to the altar not just the church but even in your room cry out to the Lord I cannot do it Lord I try but I cannot do it because God is sending the invitation come here here I heavy laden I'll give you rest come and plead with me I the Lord I will sanctify you I will justify you I can do it don't speak the language of the devil you always say that's the devil that's a devil all the time that can solve that problem because he's a specialist in the difficult cases not just difficult cases impossible cases as well because he a Jehovah of Miracles brothers and sisters I don't know about you I feel good and I'm proud of this message amen glory to God story of Jonas Jon taking the boat to go to tus you know what our Prophet was saying William Bram but look at with the caral eyes Jonah took the boat to go to Tes we can say oh Jonah is no longer in the will of God that's how our Prophet was saying Jonah in the boat to go to T he was still in the plan of God amen you need to have a prophet he was still in the will of God God asked him to go to but he took the to go to but he was still in the we of God God is God am God is omnipotent he provided everything he's omnicient he knows everything he's omes but in adoption somebody was asking a question brother is really God omnipresent but he was asking brother a question stop him brother said God is Not omnipresent God is Not omnipresent the way you think is omnipresent because God is not in every H he not in heav hes but God is omes because he knows everything he knows the end before the beginning amen you think is by chance you are here Denver in the church God has a purpose for you that the reason why in the Church of God they shouldn't be use useless members every members let me tell you is important there's no less important member what I can do you cannot do it what you can do I cannot do it we are all important for God Amen because in the body everything is there for a purpose the fingers the eyes their ears they are there for a purpose and for a purpose and that's the reason why you have to consecrate yourself to find the will of God what I have to do in this church amen it's maybe you might not come be beond the to preach the mothers can say I have nothing to do for God our Prophet was saying it might be God you on the earth in this church to raise good child children so that they can be preachers tomorrow they can be deons tomorrow that was the purpose of for you you can say I'm a daughter I'm a girl I cannot preach the gospel God can place you in the church to clap your hands to worship Him you are very important don't neglect yourself brother and sister seek the face of God God needs you amen let me tell you according to the plan of God according to the plan of God Joel 2 verse 28 the young the young people will have Vision the old one will have dreams don't think it's something extraordinary all these people they in the church at the birth of every one of you there's something it's called conscience and there's something that called subconscious God is placing it in a certain distance from each other the people that God created to have dreams is placing a conscience away from sub that is why was saying somebody's dreaming he's not sleeping deeply because now I'm conscious when I'm sleeping I'm getting into a subconscious being in a subconscious we can see things let me open a little paresis when you sleep to wake up it's a miracle potentially it's death it's conscience you leave your conscience subconscious you in the subconscious it's a miracle it's a miracle every time you sleep and you wake up the first thing you got to do is to give glory to God you Rose me up again can you say Amen to that because that's the TR and when you say Amen you not say Amen you say Amen to the word because is nothing what is important is the word he's the almighty God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the word was made fles and dwell Among Us the word is nothing than the Lord Jesus Christ best brothers and sisters say look it carefully there are people they don't dream you might think oh I'm not a Christian I don't dream God let it be like that God created this person he places subconscious away from the subconscious when the person sleep he gets into his subconscious to wake up he forgets everything God made him that way but God creates some people to have VIs the example of the Prophet can place the consci and subconscious together the prophet can speak to you while still awake he enters in the sub I see this I see that you were there being in conscious he can talk to you he means when it comes to young people old Visions dreams them people they are there you just have to consecrate yourself so that God can use your gift that's the way brother resisters I want to tell you like Joshua the crossing of the Jord he invit his people to sanctify them sanctify yourself God needs you want to do something we are getting into the Promised Land and our Prophet is saying the promised land is nothing that the B of the Holy Spirit but he was saying it but he was saying in another way because brothers and sisters say we there's two seasons the season of mortal life in which we're living right now in the season of mortal life we die every age but there's a season of immortal it's a season to come but you have to prepare yourself while you still in the Mortal life to get into into Immortal Life Like A th oh the four is crucifixion is crucifiction four is getting old because the winter will come but the life in this s will not die before winter he will leave the the that is why you see the Lea falling it's it's it's a life leaving the the leaves so that we cannot destroy it where is that life that that was in the the leaves it goes back to the orig it goes back to the roots because after that after the fall there will be there will be after the winter there will be a the spring the same life that left the leaves to hide in the roots in the origin to for that represent death do not kill him that life will come back again that life will come back again do you understand that life will come back but highlight something like the leaves that fell the life that will come back it's not in the original it's not in original Le but it's in the new le now glory to God thank you Lord it will come back in a new I want you to understand this very carefully when Abraham over there was old about 90 years old God visited him God told Abraham the next year you will have a son with Sarah you say today there were ordinary man let me tell you brothers and sisters God can do anything nothing can hinder the purpose of God purpose of God God can do anything there were there were ordinary man that came to Abraham there were like ordinary men when you look at eyes but the prophet was saying between those among those three men one of them was the Eternal God and the two others were Angels God can do anything let me tell you God is the one who gives you that body God gives you that body that is the reason why because disease are demons dises are from the devil that's what prop says if that demon comes in the body it's your body it's your Poss you can go to God this is my body you to leave this body because it's my body get to position because God has given you that body God is taking that chemicals elements he builds a body he get into that he made another body for war Abraham he was in under the tree tree he show three men now you ask your a question AB knew that one of them was eternal God we have a prophet two day before that happened God met Abraham he did not call him ABR he called him Abraham God Called to Abram you will not be called ABR now you be called Abraham the way Abraham recognized that was the Lord because only Abraham the Lord knew the name was changed when that man stood before AB even if he looked like an ordinary man he said Abraham Sarah your wife ABR recogn quickly that was the Lord amen glory to God Abraham was married when he was young when they were still 16 they they got married Abraham was not sterile but Sarah was sterile or baren at that age what can they do what can they do to have babies when they were 19 said God was doing something God made them young again God made them young again they became young again you can say again it's it's your Prophet saying that I'll tell you Sarah became so young the young king ABC saw a old lady of 0 he fell in love God made her young again I want to tell you with this body we cannot go to the Rapture even if God make us young again we cannot go to the Rapture not only God made them young you cannot forget Sarah was bar God took away the barness not just God will make us young he will change his body to a new heavly body glorify to go to the rupture in the wedding supper I want to have to stop after 5 minutes it looks like I haven't started preaching yet there's a lot of things to say Amen because the word is unable SCE I love this message this is my only Pride amen glory to God thank you Lord yes servant Jonah it was there brothers and sisters glory to God there was something on the sea the cast a lot and Jonah said I'm the problem problem you can bind me and throw me in the water in the sea he was confident in the Lord you can ask yourself why Jonah asked that he can be bound but don't don't forget the the topic the purpose of God the purpose of God for Jonah Jonah had to go to n Jonah had to go to n they took Jonah they bound Jonah they cast him in the sea God is God of Miracle God is God of miracle and there was a there was a fish that swallow Jonah brought about prec very important and the the the the the the Fisher took the shock and at that time there that time there was an unbeliever that was there he said well the Bible is explaining there was the fish that swallow Jonah even a little uh piece of meat cannot go through this but I'm believer was saying it was true it was true right was there I cannot stay quiet I have to stand up for the word I came forward I said man sir there's something that you miss to see the Bible said the the fish that swallow Jonah it was a fish created by God it was a fish that was created right there brothers and sister nothing can stop the purpose of God for Jonah to go to n to Proclaim this message needed a special anointing he had to go away from people God has to prepare boat a boat that's SW Jonah and he going down in the bottom of the sea with Jonah then Jonah will have time to there was nobody to knock Jonah I need you of the the fish show you God was still God in the belly of this fish there's no possibility in the belly of the fish and you start thinking about something he thought about prayer a prayer of Solomon when they were dedicating the temple when the Israel was in trouble when they turned their face oh to the temple the prayer Lord Jon prayed naturally Bell of the fish there's no Oxygen say Jonah used to breathe but in the belly of the sea Jonah breathe a good hair a good oxygen brothers and sister that was the purpose of God nothing can destroy God will not fail you will get to Perfection the sin in your life cry out to God God is more than able to give you the
