[5:24] let us read and it came to pass
[5:28] that as he was praying in a certain
[5:30] place
[5:32] when he ceased one of his disciples
[5:36] said unto him lord
[5:39] teach us to pray
[5:43] as john also taught his disciples
[5:49] and he said unto them
[5:52] when ye pray say
[5:55] our father which art in heaven
[5:58] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[6:03] thy will be done as in heaven
[6:07] so in earth
[6:11] give us day by day
[6:14] our daily bread
[6:18] and forgive us our sins for we
[6:21] also forgive everyone
[6:24] that is indebted to us
[6:28] and lead us not into temptation
[6:32] but deliver us from evil
[6:40] and he said unto them which of you
[6:44] shall have a friend and shall go unto
[6:47] him at midnight
[6:48] and say unto him friend lend me three
[6:52] loaves
[6:55] for a friend of mine in his journey has
[6:58] come to me
[7:00] and i have nothing to set before him
[7:05] and he from within shall answer and say
[7:08] trouble me not the door is now shut
[7:12] and my children are with me in bed.
[7:16] i cannot rise and give thee
[7:20] i say unto you though he will not
[7:24] rise and give him because he is his
[7:28] friend
[7:29] yet because of his importunity
[7:33] he will rise and give him as many
[7:36] as he needed
[7:41] and i say unto you ask
[7:45] and it shall be given you seek
[7:48] and ye shall find knock
[7:52] and it shall be opened unto you
[7:58] for every one that asketh
[8:01] receiveth and he that seeketh
[8:06] find it and to him that knocketh
[8:10] it shall be opened
[8:15] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[8:18] that is a father will he give him a
[8:22] stone
[8:24] or if you ask a fish
[8:27] will he for a fish give him a serpent
[8:33] or if he shall ask an egg
[8:37] will he offer him a scorpion
[8:43] if he then
[8:47] being evil know
[8:50] how to give good gifts unto your
[8:52] children
[8:54] how much more shall your heavenly father
[8:59] give the holy spirit to them
