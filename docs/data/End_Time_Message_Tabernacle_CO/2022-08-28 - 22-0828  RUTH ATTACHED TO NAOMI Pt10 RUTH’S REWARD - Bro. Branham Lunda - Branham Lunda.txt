love and full of patience for the people that you have placed my may you be with them wherever they found them we don't know how to express things that are not supplemented but we're just waiting on you the holy ghost if they are your people my lord say mata that's sick this morning they haven't come to see a man veneer twice but they have to come to you the kingsmen redeem it give them the good health don't only let saliva give may you come and inspire these christians to give us the context of that as we pray with faith let everybody says amen amen as we're still standing as a long video we are going to open our bible read ruth chapter four la versawitt from verse 8 8. ruth chapter 4 from verse 8. to verse 13. celebrate therefore the king's men said unto boaz buy for thee so he drew off his shoes and boas said unto the elders and unto all the people they are witnesses this day that have bought all that was eliminated and all that chilean and macleon of the hands of naomi moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of matalon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead didn't be not cut off from among these people and from the gate of his place he witnesses this day that all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into that house like rachel in like leia which to did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephratus and be famous in the bethlehem and let that house be like the house of pharisees from tamar bay unto judah and seed which the lord shall give thee of this young men so young woman so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went he went in unto her and lord gave her a conception and she bears son amen amen you may be seated senior vuben is travishman may god bless you richly call us may god bless you everybody and you may reach each other hey yo venice god bless you are you happy merci beaucoup thank you very much we are so grateful for this day the fact that you're alive it's a grace because soon they're in the hospital or sick if for giving us all this time to give this little teachings honestly i wasn't expecting this and i didn't want it [Music] now i know for sure somebody will be blessed that somebody was blessed amen just the faith just to be positioned as ruth and you will see your reward certainly suddenly you will see your reward amen amen this is the truth this is not the man saying jesus a general idea jessica's i like the pastor to be asking questions call me leffe as he always does it he goes very deep with it last sunday i was discouraged when he asked the question people didn't want the person to be asking questions today we're going to talk about the reward of ruth amen amen just to rewind a little bit this is young the decision the service of work repo the rests recompense and the reward recompense and the reward justification decision is the justification sanctification service sanctification the rest is the baptism of the holy ghost adoption and the reward is the adoption doc we have seen all within many phases come as the steps of root is the step that god is doing with the gentile church to lead them in the full steps of redemption rita comacilla said this day ruth started by deciding after her decision that took her to work [Music] that typified the church being at the feet of jesus after doing a great work in humility and at the end of the the same thing that god does with the gentile church after we had the whole testament and we all know uh god sent down the baptism of the holy ghost in jerusalem elizabeth that was the jews amen amen god had to lose and when we're talking about the church edges this is the bright gentle bride amen amen oh he said martin you're saying all these people said god sent the reformers like martin to preach about justification why basket le diablo because the devil counts when he saw the church at the peninsula that church was acting like jesus himself the the devil was down what did the devil do he wanted to kill all the apostles apart thinking by killing all the opposition he will kill the power of god but he did not succeed memphis apart that is why if somebody has the holy ghost certainly combat it's useless to fight the first converter if you're fighting that person it's like fighting the wind son of a permanent it won't work el diablo fully combat or traffic legally catholic and the devil wanted to fight through the catholic church you had two lesser particular deaths recently he killed all the apostles then he destroyed all the churches what god said in joel i will restore man [Music] so that the capstone will capture the church so that this right you know here celebrate and jesus christ for him to take his bride for his right to reflect his image she has to go through all these steps as ruth justification justification last sanctification sanctification of the respect the baptism of the holy ghost then the adoption basket so when the church reaches the adoption hello [Music] because the past already preached a great series about adoption insulted maturity the adoption is some sort of maturity somebody who's mature foreign it's like a home and pair a father calila des alfa when he has children the father wants to see what he's doing the children should do the same thing objective his objectives if he has to have it here [Applause] [Music] this is the way you listen to the world and the holy ghost maybe i'm showing you something straight maybe he has a little boob he's taking notes giving point great until now she doesn't dress well forever and i'm a dude but the branham says dude sessions all these things the holy ghost will not adopt you amen amen man he says the holy ghost is [Music] he are you with me is the fact that you are convinced that this message is definitely about jesus you were baptized now it's the prophet kevin martin secular biblical that shows you what the bible is seminar it's not seminary yeah that examination god will examine god are you moving forward with your prayer life maybe god has giving him a grace he doesn't smoke no more man he left only critique but when it comes to criticism very strongly but when the holy ghost check that he went he goes to the father and then when it comes to criticisms he keeps doing it he never went i am god wants him to preach a silly prayer if he preaches he's there for your salvation god can anoint him to preach about something maybe that's the thing that you like because the holy ghost he knows the thing that you like for you to be adopted basket dance at us because in this age we have yes we [Music] how are we born therefore we are born when we have the holy ghost continue and the work continues that is why you know somebody can have the holy ghost but it doesn't have patience get capable second peter chapter one according as as his divine power has given us unto all things that pertains through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue [Music] had given unto us exceeding great and precious promises participants that by this you may be partakers of this divine nature existed having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust across the cellar man and beside giving all diligence at your fifth virtue virtue if you don't meditate correct if you don't have the right faith hey i don't drive it let's go first la connect knowledge you i know you know these things patience [Music] and after the goldenness affects you brotherly kindness you see i pray la flexion for turner after the broadly kindness sase hear love it's christ himself hey and select christ is also the holy ghost christ is also the word it's a genuine man it's amazing god himself you see that this one if we say brothers why is i believe many people are not adopted because if somebody is adopted the first thing the adoption for the peripheral defect the the adoption goes along with the capstone you cannot say somebody's adopted an unavoidable scene but we don't see the sign of this capstone the lord the effect is the capstone here let me signify divine divine love divine love a ceremony this divine love secrets christ himself you remember how christ's behaving when he was invited in the party letter negligence but he was neglected necessary christ never complained he messaged but he knew that he was the one who can make them listen he never complained about it man but a vaccine objective with his objective pressure a sinner who god baptize us amen we are hiding faith that is why in many messages god is insisting on what i have to face virtue today i have a lot of things positioned good words to position the process it's very complicated this knowledge helps a lot it's true that the knowledge when they are not born this to place every word at his place this is the knowledge that helped martin luther to write the bible amen don't say through these fruits so let fruity [Music] know bananamedia brother branham says convoy let us see let's get calculated let somebody slap you it's an apparent fool it's not a crazy message let god that's where we're going to see your color if you have patience temperance or not amen amen temperance it's very important if somebody doesn't have temperatures since you work correctly one day because they said existence because of this righteousness he was working and the force that attract things to the ground anyway virtual i have i've been a pastor for 17 years for this church to be in this state he is now he took patience this patience moses was lacking it to all the people that is what moses knows we have to be patients from one another especially as men of jail [Applause] keep praying for the same people add the patience la piete the goldenness la please godliness say say it become a christian it's like being like christ a proper community your clean mind it's been a while but today when we step out second season if i'm used to brother uh branham it's always brother branham if i'm used to better [Music] those are demonic spirits but when people bring that to you check your family that's what weakens the church message you should do good to your brother but today is the contrary when you help you hear people oh he's from congo oh it's between for me you are my family that's it amen in heaven do we have tribes in heaven no in heaven we're only going to have to be able to tell you [Music] our master is the holy ghost and the holy ghost [Applause] can somebody say amen today because brother burnham says since god created the stars respected every star's respect is ordered progress man doesn't understand the order that god has given amen amen i don't know why i'm going there we have brotherly candice jeremiah i rather [Music] when i'm saved if there's no church there's no love please it's the church that is messed up the sacrifice that's what brother burnham says give me a church people love really from the heart without paying attention to no injustice you see the ever benefited god we bless the children they will lack nothing why this is what we have when we are born in the family the second grandfather i know it's my second petition [Music] [Music] after receiving the baptism of the holy spirit we're having faith we're hiding virtues and this virtue says this is the power that god is giving him of his to cast our evil many don't have this virtue they can pray for mourinho they can fast but there's no virtue yeah there are people that fast in vain illusion illegitimate they can fast fast fast man but just to destroy his death do you know why men because himself he doesn't leave the world [Music] because just few of them received many of them you know why because they like before the perfect laptop doesn't match with the word depending on can you imagine a sister elect she has been crucial she knows the paper protester a woman cannot wear paint motivation sir why you see a sister ellis button she feels good to pray even wearing paint a preservative sacrifice after knowing the truth there is no sacrifice for saying the teleprompter i will not answer that prayer because when you walk in and a sinner that looks to you kyle when she looks at you as a destiny and he sees how he is showing how much more it was very difficult to see a woman wearing a pantalon that's not a problem [Applause] isaiah said come on fellas why you how are you fasting can you parliament but you you can't talk to another person you can't even listen to the word of god divine it doesn't come and the capstone okay that's good let's send this regard the holy ghost is checking he replaced him he pays his time we succumb to the enemy the wheels come back because brother venom was asked a question the holy ghost but she pays but she works hard amen amen says second sentence prepared that's what the holy ghost does he's the one telling the father every time that the report has been given [Applause] [Music] you inspire the preaching mayor negligence by his negligence in a considerable remember he doesn't even consider it don't adopt him he's still a lot of workers what would happen give the holy ghost heal the truth he found can no sovereignty there that we are faithful when the holy ghost sees your prayer right now he left from the father is really strong he loves the prayers yes yeah that would be lemon satisfies the word him amen amen the word he is this child yeah i adopted christ [Applause] i believe it it was the preview of his company jesus had to come back in the clouds that is why god took him transformed it was transformed to show that okay because at will say lemond the word lemon the world they put them here listen to brothers listen to brendan everybody he was the the devil left was empty-ended but god was looking sick delivered and the to redeem the one lost for that person to be worthy called kingsman redeemer he has to be a kings a kingsman he has to be upright antagonist upright just he has to be enough wealthy amen amen and that man our president [Music] when god took the book that gave the authority to abraham he looked personal nobody could meet all the requirements amen amen the one who's meeting all the requirements when we have to talk about the one who has to be outright sex he doesn't have to be born by sex must be vaguely are you with me the church don't get too personal the only one who was born with sex a television everyone who was born with sex was disqualified then adam himself discussed until now abraham from the prophet abraham more years since god didn't find anybody yesterday god said make commercial ffa hi my what am i going to do tell them the only way to do it what's your choice in history i'm in spirit they are human beings it is so physical they are physical they're my proper lord exists and my own law fire they want to have to reduce he has to be a man like this is fairness but i'm in spirits god left the form of spirits he went to mary creating the body of jesus christ when jesus was born our lord satan [Applause] without any sex amen amen all the rest of the prophets yeah they refer god who had to do yes said prophet his prophet he will commit desire to make mistakes because that was a teaching for amen amen i thank god so that no comprehension so we should understand yes those are the channels that god has used but they are now worshippers that's why they make mistakes by [Music] [Applause] [Applause] before three days electricity he was resurrected he had what to prove today he had what to prove to the devil that he was worthless they're in but why to lose the sale it's because in the seniors there were secrets they missed their mysteries things that belong to the bride says for these people who was full across the perspective because of the original scene for these people to come back our friends to take back the authority as adam it was connected they have to know let appropriate work their own rights knowing your own rights your rights was written in the book of seven december is he is the one found out when they saw it they saw the lamb of god before the foundation he's going to the throne apparently he took the book element [Applause] amen hallelujah because there were that is what daniel said them people at the end times sessions them that we read they will understand this amen there will be watchers there will be clean healing adam has his family on the earth and we are the family of adam amen amen i may be black jesus i may be raised we are the family of heaven we that is why i'm telling you this book do not miss it at home amen amen is the book of rejection when it's coming down in a truth he found jeffrey through the boy return and go go back illegally he gives the book remember himself he comes in bro because he wasn't a man prisoner he took jesus i will not preach the is giving to william he enters forever now that's why every time he wanted to open the book he would go in his office before coming to the property he wanted to be ashore that the angel was there to tell him everything concerning amen the message that we have received [Music] the seventh are you with me christian the son of god christ descending when it is coming down that's the seventh day that is why the bible says when he opens the seven seals guinevere where is he going he'll get some he's coming down panda killing while he's coming down he lost silence nothing selling mister the savage this is the mystery of his coming where the burnham says he says the silence that's usually dominated because if it was written fred branham edward branham says let diabla refer the dagger the devil [Music] [Applause] guide them lost are you with me two seconds wherever you think the item lost something good was kenyan dancer live in this book when you believe it the good half [Music] adam was always like a god only exactly everything that i was doing was the nature of the adam and daughter in other words you the nature you don't have to listen to god comedy wanted my brother says he hasn't he was god come here and told him you came to look for schools yes yes of course i didn't find anything [Music] because he was a prophet a panda can really matter while it was working because i was probably thinking when he was working telling him to speak the word probably took off his let him be there he's ability and now i will kill you as i was still speaking and i saw the struggle that's exactly the way with their people exactly and that came exactly until the third one came along by the word of brenham are you and the things happen it's what adam was doing avalanche before the fall forever would say okay don't you pay attention to what my wife said kitten be thou removed sir and when adam says he doesn't worry to say is he moving or is he the tree was uh being rooted physically maybe by the pronunciation happened already it's the same way why are [Applause] since let me read something yeah initials there's something ugly the pose church the bride quinoa block that is hindering us that doesn't take us the foundation of of faith preached january 13 1955. paragraph [Music] no matter how let's go to paragraph nine no continue with [Music] he gave him the juridiction of everything on the earth to control everything he looked controlled he controlled the animal life you look controlled volatility he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth adam was he became unconscious they set a reality of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship essa communion fellowship with the father then he lost christ has redeemed thinking is to live for [Applause] authority we have more knowledge than people that came before us but god wanted us to go back as adams [Applause] a redeemer to redeem and adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never jammed he never had the worry oh oh he never made a change he never had a headache brother branham says i may pray he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father jesus just like a child do we apartheid everything was his oh my god because he was a god child a [Applause] has come to redeem us have you ever stopped to think what christ has redeemed us foreign [Applause] for my redeemer to restore back adam lost in the fall amen amen why are you tiring why are you tiring me right [Music] and there was god there holy ghost in brenham he said tell to that woman kelly demanded two second one let her husk everything whatever she will get a letter let her husky [Applause] the god of heaven give it to you give it to you amen why second adam what adam [Applause] telling you i give it to you right there the sons that was less than converted and converted they were saved why [Applause] but the problem is it's the church the devil is perverted when we get here but you we take all the churches and they will christian the bride press your hand pressure the bride can i never fail our president when they pressure the bride to not happen you won't have time to decide to go by is but those channels to be prepared for the rapture said you left that day when the pressure will come over what they will say personally nobody can sell you nobody can buy you and they never travel to go to work need to do anything but that's the greatest commercial would be so great as i have nothing to eat there's no annuity i want food in and i will blast islam will gather the redeemed church amen even now people don't want to may of course they set up each other but because of that pressure the i don't know what it has you have to go back to that person set the personality the person secular what it says until he's going to take it back i remember always okay it's it's not pointless oh today listen to what brothers before closing let me read this i will see the continent let me before continuing this down same message we said yesterday in this message god is hiding himself in simplicity paragraph 2 paragraph 31. when the preacher got to a church where people are in prayer they prayed up when we come answer my prayers this is you are so confused a less creativity and the spirit is grieved when i see let's pray if the spirit is grieved now let's get vegas how are you going to receive what are you going to receive let us avoid to [Music] you haven't come to see if this one is preaching to show up you are a daughter thank god no matter who is preaching god will speak to you soon if you have the good right you will not leave i repeat what says he's taking this cell our powers give history the word of god say amen holy ghost it's the way to say if you say amen to me the more you bring in your holy ghost in your life the more you become the word i want you to become the word prepared amen amen even [Music] you say lord you if the holy ghost condemned criticism don't be those kind of people condemn something are you conscious of what you're doing when you leave you start saying [Applause] hey they love their job help the men of god the preachers that vote in your prayers a devotee pastor help your pastor in your prayers amen amen when things are not going to work you don't say that much we'll give you that maturity normally epic don't you forget when somebody's in justification in a paper comprehensive you cannot understand the one who is adopted as any vote but the one even if there's only one or two yes yes i said the person god is seeking for that person to have the rest of our revenue amen if those people are known may god give you the desire of your heart amen amen oh one minute keep praise oh in my self preaching yes your spirit and adoption oh i want to wish that you guys may have seen it the hypocrisy hallelujah hallelujah can't yet evolve when god sees it he is secret to her he knows that really your prayer life it's okay you're a human being it's not adopted even being at the hole hindering us from oh william oh remember when i'm speaking now fundamental i'm going back to my preaching
