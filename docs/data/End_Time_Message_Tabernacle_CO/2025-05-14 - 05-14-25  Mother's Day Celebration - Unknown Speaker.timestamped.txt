[0:04] Welcome the visitors.
[0:17] John
[0:21] and Chris.
[0:24] May God bless you.
[0:42] Oh.
[0:51] He's coming from
[1:04] Welcome.
[1:06] [Music]
[1:10] We have also greetings from Sister Keta
[1:14] from South Africa.
[1:25] request
[1:29] for myself.
[1:33] So, brother Caleb want to ask the church
[1:36] for their prayers as I'm going out of
[1:40] town. God bless you.
[1:46] That's Caleb Gonzalez.
[1:53] And uh today is a special day for the
[1:56] mother.
[1:59] How we appreciate the mother.
[2:04] Every life that came on earth is through
[2:07] the mother.
[2:11] And mothers are a big asset in God.
[2:18] And we want the mother to realize their
[2:22] level of responsibility.
[2:28] As the world is celebrating Mother's
[2:33] Day, we don't want this to be a
[2:38] tradition that they bring
[2:41] flowers, they cook for us like we
[2:46] did. Really, uh, God put this in my
[2:50] heart. prepare those meals for our
[2:58] sisters so that they can cook
[3:01] 364 days.
[3:08] I say
[3:09] 364 days.
[3:12] Yeah. For one day like today, we are
[3:15] going to cook for them.
[3:18] And we did and I want really to
[3:22] appreciate all the
[3:26] brothers. So each one of them they were
[3:30] in the cooking team.
[3:35] They spent all day yesterday
[3:40] cooking on the
[3:44] plantin and all these
[3:46] things. Sister, where is brother?
[3:53] Huh?
[3:58] What? In the kitchen cooking
[4:04] today. So that sister Mali,
[4:09] God bless you, sister.
[4:19] So Uh sister just bear with us.
[4:26] We did not we are not perfect
[4:30] but take it as a act of appreciation for
[4:37] you an act of love.
[4:40] So the rest of the brothers
[4:43] who did not
[4:45] cook when we go
[4:48] downstairs try to serve
[4:52] I don't want to see a sister touching
[4:57] anything they are going to sit like a
[5:07] queen they are saying if the pastor was
[5:09] like every day the church will be
[5:15] better. So it's not going to be a
[5:19] habit, but we did something special for
[5:22] you on your special day.
[5:28] But I believe the brothers have done a
[5:32] wonderful job.
[5:40] to the extent I saw a lot of food
[5:44] and I'm going to apologize for not
[5:46] cooking the food because we have already
[5:48] a lot of
[5:56] food. Seems like really they like me to
[5:59] cook.
[6:02] But I did cook what you are going to eat
[6:04] soon.
[6:07] Which one you prefer? Natural or
[6:10] spiritual?
[6:14] Both.
[6:17] I was assisting brother Caleb in the
[6:19] kitchen yesterday.
[6:24] So it's just a act of appreciation.
[6:29] And uh also as men living in
[6:34] America, is not too late to try to to
[6:37] learn how to fix something.
[6:43] It's not too
[6:50] late on some
[6:53] days. Brother, we can also wake up
[6:57] earlier and fix the breakfast and bring
[7:00] to your wife in the bedroom.
[7:08] No. Amen.
[7:12] Yeah. We can do those things just to
[7:15] show our appreciation.
[7:20] Amen. Amen.
[7:22] Sometimes I take for granted the
[7:25] Christian mother who is there. The
[7:28] mother who has raised me, who gave her
[7:31] love and care. The mother who helped me
[7:34] grow in a fine Christian home. The
[7:38] mother who has taught me with God, we're
[7:40] not alone. Amen. The mother who has
[7:44] laughed with me when all was going well.
[7:47] The mother who w has picked me up the
[7:53] the times that I have failed. A mother I
[7:57] didn't appreciate until I was fully
[8:00] grown. The sacrifices she made for me as
[8:04] time quickly moved along. The mother was
[8:08] with such crest and faith that helped me
[8:11] from the start. The mother who I love
[8:14] and cherish and treasure my
[8:24] heart. Life is of surprises. There a lot
[8:28] in store. We only have one mother, one I
[8:32] adore. You gave me lots. You help me
[8:36] out. Step in when things went wrong. Oh,
[8:39] mother dear. I have to cheer. I'm so
[8:43] happy I could sing you a song. There was
[8:47] only one on this earth. You deserve
[8:50] first prize. You brought me up, gave me
[8:53] love. You held me when I cry. Now it's
[8:56] your turn, dear. This is just to say I
[9:00] will always love you, mother. My love
[9:03] grows more each day.
[9:05] [Applause]
[9:17] This is a quote from um Willin Mavian
[9:20] Bunham um um from the the invasion of
[9:24] the United States
[9:29] 1954. Respect and honor you there with
[9:33] your your red roses on your mother. If
[9:36] you want your mother, if you want to do
[9:39] anything for her, do
[9:44] it, do it 365 days a year. Go to her
[9:49] house and offer and offer her a prayer
[9:52] and live for God. That's the thing to
[9:55] do. And bring your child children. And
[9:59] when your children come up, they'll call
[10:01] you blessed. Amen. After you have passed
[10:05] on beyond the veil that the real spirit
[10:08] of motherhood, the real spirit of
[10:10] Mother's Day. Mother's Day is 365 days a
[10:14] year.
[10:18] Don't forget Mother's Day should be
[10:19] every single day.
[10:23] Happy Mother's Day. Thank you.
[10:32] Certainly when we see the children
[10:34] saying those kind of
[10:37] words that make us feel good.
[10:41] So that means in return
[10:45] we have to take care of the little ones
[10:49] in the Lord
[10:54] and to the mothers.
[10:57] Uh I don't want to preach on uh a sermon
[11:00] on the mothers like I did last year.
[11:07] But I want just to say one thing here.
[11:11] In the Mother's Day message,
[11:17] 89,
[11:20] brother dedicated a whole sermon for the
[11:25] mother on that mother.
[11:37] He said this
[11:39] then we shall see him.
[11:43] Then we shall be like him.
[11:46] Then we shall worship him.
[11:50] Then we shall see mother as God wants
[11:57] her. How does God want to see mother?
[12:04] Amen. Amen. Then we shall see mother as
[12:08] God wants
[12:15] her. Mother would not be complete there
[12:19] without her
[12:23] family. No
[12:31] mother. So do you understand this? If
[12:34] you mother,
[12:36] you are planning to be in heaven,
[12:39] which is a wonderful thing. But said,
[12:44] you will not be
[12:46] complete without your family.
[12:53] What a
[12:55] statement. So that means as a mother we
[12:58] should not taking the children lightly.
[13:06] Every child of
[13:10] yours over there when we will sit at the
[13:15] table a mother will be
[13:18] happy. God you gave me
[13:21] 10. I count all the 10 around the
[13:26] table and they say without her
[13:30] family. That means
[13:33] You have to have also your husband.
[13:38] What a responsibility.
[13:41] So
[13:42] mother is the backbone of the
[13:46] family. Brother said if there is a
[13:49] credit you should give to the braham
[13:54] family don't give it to me give it to
[13:58] me.
[14:00] So even
[14:01] Brham gave all credit to his
[14:06] wife. And this morning as
[14:09] men we have to give credit to our
[14:14] spouses. Even as
[14:17] ministers without a wife, the ministry
[14:20] is
[14:22] down. How important women
[14:26] are. Amen. Amen.
[14:30] And continue
[14:32] cause the greatest time of all of her
[14:36] life is to see the children around the
[14:39] table.
[14:43] [Music]
[14:51] And to see her pour the
[14:55] coffee and whatever she
[14:59] does and fix his
[15:02] supper and her and dad sit
[15:07] down. Why that's the happiest time in
[15:12] mama's life?
[15:20] see her
[15:21] kitties all at home.
[15:27] Even though this is America,
[15:31] as a mother, try to direct your
[15:36] prayers to keep your children home
[15:40] despise of their ages.
[15:46] Oh no, I'm 18. I'm out.
[15:51] Responsibility of the mother.
[15:53] And brother Bam said now don't
[15:57] miss don't be missing that day.
[16:03] Mother don't miss
[16:06] and your
[16:07] children your family to be present.
[16:11] Let the great chain of your family be
[16:14] hooked together link by link.
[16:23] Amen. Amen. That's the responsibility of
[16:25] mother.
[16:27] Let every spoke be in the will.
[16:34] And then when we sit down with our
[16:38] families and groups across the canopies
[16:41] of
[16:47] eternity, what a day that will
[16:51] be. Then we will understand
[16:57] So I think this is summarize everything
[17:00] I could have preached
[17:05] for the
[17:07] mothers. There is an appointment
[17:10] somewhere.
[17:13] Mother, you must be there.
[17:17] Don't miss
[17:19] and be there with your family.
[17:22] And uh may God richly bless you
[17:32] mothers. That's my sincere prayer.
[17:36] I love you all. Appreciate you for the
[17:41] way you are taking care of your
[17:46] families. Not only
[17:48] that, each one of
[17:50] you has spent more than nine months with
[17:55] a child
[18:01] inside. You go through hard times.
[18:06] Sometimes you could not
[18:08] eat, you could not
[18:11] sleep because of that life that is
[18:13] inside you.
[18:16] Pain after pain. But there is a joy once
[18:21] you
[18:23] deliver. But the joy is not going to
[18:26] stop
[18:27] there. Is to see that child growing and
[18:31] taking responsibilities.
[18:35] And for the
[18:37] children as we speak for the pain of the
[18:40] mother,
[18:43] honor your
[18:46] mother, you may not realize the pain
[18:49] they endured for
[18:53] you. But I'm always talk about the
[18:57] story.
[18:59] Uh the heart of the mother is on the
[19:02] babies.
[19:06] even on
[19:10] animals. You see, you
[19:12] see a gorilla,
[19:16] with a baby and a hunter come with a
[19:21] gun, want to shoot
[19:24] gorilla will save.
[19:30] Look at the baby. You
[19:33] hunter, you don't have a
[19:39] heart. If an animal can think like
[19:43] that, but today, mothers, we have
[19:47] babies. What do we do with them? We
[19:50] leave them
[19:51] somewhere even
[19:55] unattended, unattended, such
[19:59] supervision to go look for money.
[20:04] said in one of the
[20:05] message what those dollars are going to
[20:09] do for you.
[20:12] And tomorrow we talk about juvenile
[20:14] delinquency.
[20:18] So that come also a responsibility for
[20:21] us
[20:23] men to make sure that we work
[20:26] hard to take care of the need of the
[20:30] family without necessary to see the
[20:33] mother going to look for
[20:37] money. So all of these come together as
[20:40] a family that want to see in heaven.
[20:50] Amen. Amen. Uh he also talk about a
[20:54] story.
[20:56] A mother was uh outside
[21:00] and left the babies in the
[21:03] bedroom and suddenly the house start
[21:07] burning. But there can be a lot of
[21:10] wives, women,
[21:13] they will just stand outside.
[21:16] to see how the house Oh god. Oh god. Oh
[21:21] god. Because that baby that is
[21:25] inside is not
[21:28] there. But the the
[21:30] mother who the baby was
[21:34] inside flame after
[21:38] flame, she could not stand.
[21:42] me standing
[21:43] here looking at the house
[21:46] burning and then after going collect to
[21:49] collect the ashes of my
[21:53] baby I will not
[21:55] tolerate if I have to die I have to die
[21:59] so that mother went
[22:02] inside everywhere the flame burning
[22:07] her and then she found the baby she took
[22:10] a blanket
[22:12] wrapped up the
[22:13] baby and tried to find her way
[22:17] out. She was burned
[22:20] everywhere but for the sake of
[22:24] one a baby and that can be you, you and
[22:29] I, many women they conceive but they
[22:34] could not keep the
[22:36] pregnancy. They could abol
[22:40] and you could not be here.
[22:42] But look at the sacrifice.
[22:44] And then she came out with the
[22:47] baby burn everywhere. They have to take
[22:50] the piece of her skin to patch the
[22:55] [Music]
[22:58] face. She was a very beautiful
[23:01] woman but she came she became
[23:05] ugly. Few years
[23:08] later, the child went to school and say,
[23:12] "Mama, I'm coming on
[23:15] vacation." When the mother was waiting
[23:18] for the baby at the train
[23:27] station at her friends,
[23:31] they say, "Oh, look at that ugly woman.
[23:35] But that child,
[23:37] she knew the
[23:38] story and the train uh driver don't know
[23:42] how they call
[23:44] that who knew the story. She saw the
[23:48] behavior of the baby, the
[23:51] child. When the mother was coming, oh,
[23:53] welcome, welcome. Do I know
[23:57] you? And the train driver said,
[24:02] shame on you.
[24:04] You can never deny that mother.
[24:08] If she's ugly,
[24:10] it's because she did a sacrifice to save
[24:13] you.
[24:16] So brother,
[24:18] sisters, we are children.
[24:22] We have to respect.
[24:24] Respect mean respect.
[24:28] No one time your mother tell you to do
[24:30] this. Never. Never.
[24:35] Unless it's against the word of
[24:39] God. Amen. Amen. As she is getting
[24:43] older, help the
[24:47] mother. I always tell this to my
[24:50] children. Did you see what they've done
[24:52] for my mother?
[24:56] for more than I don't know almost 25
[24:59] years
[25:00] now she
[25:06] that's why it takes
[25:09] young
[25:10] boys who you are going to marry
[25:18] because some
[25:20] women they will stand and tell
[25:24] in this house. You have to choose
[25:28] between me and her
[25:31] and you know what the mother the man
[25:33] cannot do otherwise.
[25:37] But if you have a wife who can accept
[25:40] your mother
[25:43] give more credit.
[25:47] Amen. Amen.
[25:49] So I have to stop here for the
[25:50] motherwise I will give Amen. So, the
[25:54] sisters have a special song,
[25:59] right? Yeah. I wanted them to sing when
[26:02] I'm on the platform if they can help.
