amen [Music] starting from Verse 18 come on Jeremiah 8. when when I would comfort myself against the soul my heart is faint in me oh my consolations behold the voice of the guy of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the Lord in Zion is not her King in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and weave strange vanities this summer is ended and we are not safe for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black astonished has taken Hold On Me is there no bomb in galid in gilit is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovery applications Lord are the blessing to them this is a question and I believe sometimes as Believers we have also questions why this is taking place I was here he preached it was a sermon several times but my thoughts tonight is to give to help somebody find the answer to this question is there no bomb in Gillette is there no physician there yeah is there no promise in the Bible about Divine Healing yeah is there no prophet in the last days your condition is still important conditioning to you why there is no answer in the message there is no answer in the Bible don't you read the message and I believe you the answer should be with each one of us the event connection as we move forward we have questions from time to time the communication detention even the little kids namely pleasure was telling a story of a little kids she was afraid when he goes to the bedroom to sleep and especially when it was raining it is there was lightnings and he put a blanket over the mom I'm not comfortable are the kids and the mother wanted to go I'm gonna pray for people and then God will be with you the baby said I don't want that invisible guys shame amen amen and sometimes as Believers we don't want to talk about imaginary guide but you want to talk about a god who's lead the present tense of God not God all you know when I came to the message I was on fire yes but where is that fire where is that God was it you now you are sometimes in big difficulties [Music] said in this message he starts talking about the Prophet Jeremiah foreign [Music] 14. of the same message [Music] then why is the daughter of my people so sick what's gonna feed them on purpose in my life isn't there a physician there to minister this is to minister this foreign foreign bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name is bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits amen give us of thy diseases in the department he is the Lord who heals all your Jesus so therefore there is no disease for which there is so when the Prophet Jeremiah [Music] was speaking to the people of Israel it was the time that Israel beautiful sake God and that was the time the trouble was set in the Lord and one of the daughter was sick the question was why why why because if you eat the entire chapter of Germany before we get to the conclusion of verse 22. you will notice that it was really a time where and I'm not about the daughter of the Goddess people The Zone but I'm talking about you and I tonight why my prayers are not answers why my petition or my requests don't find Solutions I have said so many prayers but it seems like some of those prayers there is no answer and I'm going to ask to ask where is God because he never changed yesterday today and forever there is another person coming under the same circumstances under the same conditions [Music] God is under obligation to give the solution the problem is the problem is why [Music] coming back to the message [Music] [Music] the conditions [Music] with the condition of the people in the church they are they have the medicine is on the medicama they have the perfect they have the Bible they have everything they don't do but why there is no solution is going to tell us today yeah it's just like this circumcision a man dying on the door steps of of a a doctor's office enormous experience and you know the doctors I don't see that here usually but in the Congo medical doctors the doctor they have a sign his own thing of the separate you say boom they get that from the Bible showing that in the Bible when the children of Israel said God is a serpent is only under the disappointed and once you are beaten by the serpent do you said multiple you don't need to go to the hospital you are just to turn your look at the judge the serpenters regardless of your sickness if you come to my office [Music] doctors in the world can do that see the doctor don't remove how much more the doctor in the spirituality the greatest regular medicine the compassionate Jesus [Music] I have a ble to hear and today he was hungry whether we can give many testimonies of many many cases and when God heals he comes you again it's a perfect it's a buffet my own mother here my papa mama is he she came here about 18 years or 19 years ago this is one of the biggest killers again what a world in the back he had cancer on the news God healed him again through prayer all the cancer dried out we don't have a god of History we have a living God which case God cannot resolve this is the hardest cases two people they don't ever maybe what if it is but they ever born to fall for children you don't you cannot lie to me the only thing is still alive but let us ask ourselves which kind of approach we are taking against Holy Ghost also for you foreign [Music] [Music] deliver y bondage of a certain Spirits please [Music] the woman is more than able to set you free agents is there no problem there is no Prophet yes he's not the going back he said you know there's the people today it's just like this circumcision a man dying on the step of a doctor is the cure for his disease foreign you know when you do you see the doctor they give you a prescription prescription the dosage must be correct if you take more it can damage your kidneys if you don't take enough they don't kill the bacterials and that's the reason why is medically speaking they when they do medical research they don't rush and try it on human being because it can have side effects they try on the animals they study the dosage if it works then we know it's gonna work but the medicine we are talking about tonight they try it on their own human beings and he came back [Applause] into working celebration destroy this body every three days [Music] that's why he made this statement he said Isaiah 55 century but he was wounded for our transcription do you already to get your Solutions [Music] [Music] but if he refuses refused take his medicine he will die on the doorstep because he has done everything for you but now where is the problem is that with the prescription prepared [Music] they will be baptized that prescription you can take that question you are foreign stubborn to take him along and the problem is using the word you can go see the best physician here in America he gave you the prescription but the doctor May the doctor will not come to your home to say in the morning unless you are in intensive care units so you don't understand unconscious that he will and especially those with mental disease which in our case is called spiritual Amnesia spiritual only those with mental disease they don't accept to take medicine in acceptance you have lost your mind no I've received in uh Center of uh with people with mental diseases everybody get it pathology those people with a mental disease they can confuse you evil doctor you know what they are saying that I'm sick it is am I sick no but doctors say no military when somebody start talking like that yes why don't you know the medicine as effects this is how it works apply it in our spiritual applications we have a people with spirit ual amnition spiritually that's why well they even forget who they are is soon when you see a man come where you know forgetting his wife go hug another wife here is that right foreign people foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] correct you will see the results you know back in the combo Congo yeah I did not like too much at a certain time my mom has a son some kind of a traditional stuff is and uh to the blade but you know what happened when you go there you are freezing when you get out there he was sweating when you swear before you know many people call and call yourself when you go and you do something wrong you used to work like this come on temperature I don't know if you say it is [Music] [Music] how can you see the results where they made that medicine you can know the chemical formulas H2O plus this is you know on every medicine they put the ingredients that's why some medicine come on also aren't you pregnant yes on Center consent they're bright come on you have to be careful so everybody medicine regardless you can be a pharmacist you know all the ingredients you know everything but if you don't take it you can recite oh you know this medicine [Music] you put everything in the head you can know all your Bibles you know all the cause of the message that is not gonna heal you know that is the three major components [Music] that's the mighty Mighty angel coming down that's Christ [Music] opher verses 11 messages [Music] [Applause] [Music] if he came back descendants [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] you start having a problem [Music] disability is coming from the medicine I cannot do this with paper faces amen amen so it is today that many people die in front of the church survey you are just dying inside of the church that you used to it you bring the same symptoms with my stethoscope telescope status quo is the thing that the doctor put here they describe get it that's the preaching when the message they are taking foreign foreign foreign [Music] did you okay they die in their seal the love machine they had to take something first instead it's not because there is not a death because there is no but man and woman just refuse to take it he feels to the power and they die hey it's a man die die that's not what he's gonna say so you can spend many years but you know nature is Not Gonna Change you are listening but it's not affecting you message because you are listening with this naturalness when you really hear the gospel this is when you hear that with the ears of okay fearlessly and lays it out he must be born again [Music] foreign God is getting whatever you can't even care for yourself once one risky woman so don't worry about yourself he cares for you even before you were aborted for you yeah [Music] through the night and remember most of us Brothers [Music] without education [Music] look at the stupid thing you did certain shows it's not the thing we'd see today 19 I believe 1960 63 1 Avenue the president president everyone promotions I think I was five years old he was the president stopped president he was not the president United it was not impressed the paper the president yeah the way he said emoji anything that's moving a goat so so a chicken bigger massage no I just shoot it up even innocent who will die but there are so many things God has done in our life showing that he cares and at the stage of the journey God is still caring for you he wanted to be filled amen amen whatever what I'm saying [Music] unless the world repents and confession is what the world needs names his honest confessions that's what we cover on Sundays and we are going to go forward now but if you get you did your confession God is at the obligation to heal you is an obligation to field and the obligation to do anything that your heart is like medicine for disease what kind of medicine it is and what disease I'm going to apply that light to the Bible just read in the directions he used to be in this church I was a Sunday School teacher back home I have read the Bible from the beginning so that was just knowledge unless it is instead of each episode in our case we don't take what the remedy says sincerely and you are making sure there is response the trouble is that in our case we don't take the remedy what the Emily says we we got the remedies they do notice all his Capital was they do notice his Capital which remedies we got the remedies but we won't take it and you say it also you see it with the capital look I think I thank God as much as good we say we do because we can read it but to really take it hello hello but to really take it we don't do it the gospel is the same way in this case if they're patient and the rest the family has been proven to cure the patience and a patient is all about the discovery of this drug is and they know every ounce of medicine that is the scientist name that found this certain black International vaccine and so forth if we know only worry about it you know but refuse to take it 77. and then how we say but we took it and if you say you took it is now we are talking about results this message must produce results [Applause] this message to massage has the power to do it Allah and the message mainly massage does it within a supernatural way you know everybody knows against smoking control but there was somebody smoking now yeah he continues that's his type of smoking is off okay take the cigarettes he took the medicine can still work for you I used to last regarding Batman when you take the medicine you see the way you remember the conference [Music] mystical no you still have the same symptoms if you do she will obey that means amen it's all about results [Music] how can a person read the scriptures about women with bob hair and wearing shorts and so forth like that how can they call themselves Christians when they're very medicine itself says that you didn't there is why the daughter of my people is not the book was four you still you you still are showing all this all the dogs that the medicine is supposed to cure okay and the medicine is [Music] foreign [Music] then you have to have to believe what about no praise God right here it's got to be it's a lot different now you see it you got to show results amen amen skipping paragraph 82. in the same message talking about the medicine showing result Etc tonight we are not speaking but we are moving towards results each one of us [Music] if we don't see results and we cannot question the doctors but we have to question your name [Music] without you and again a God in the same message and the church playing tapes is will just do this do that this morning that's going to be paid for us if you are going to be prayed for tonight that's what you need to do okay and your people Evolution that here the state give this a bond all over the world back to the moon and after this day prayer blessed born this place is way and the minister in the minister that means in the church [Music] or the person that's playing it in congregation groups is you we're the first to make your confession Clearwater confession clay and then if we come with nothing in your heart at all we are good are you the prophet with nothing in your heart at all you do what is nothing without haters again without the Genesis foreign foreign man Divine Healing sacred the secret is the preparation of human heart still a preparation you will see in many messages a message to lift up the faith of the people foreign foreign okay we don't think we've overhead that's intellect Faith that's enough foreign amen but uh many things with his head is foreign and when you get to Faith it comes available you have to divide healing who's available but they say that in the human heart is indicated man it isn't in a animal Hut isn't in air in any other hearts in ibadan to talk to girl but right in the human heart is a little compartment we are amputee in the middle of the human human that doesn't it is where even there is no even even blood cells which is there is nothing and there is where God do I see now with you the man and the big mystery to the government said I cannot explain we have brothers and sisters a message they have a hard transplant ation but they still believe the neighbors you need to quality massage hello hello I can be sick they take my heart they give me a new heart I still preach the message who can explain there is some Supreme intelligence to show that wherever you are whatever is despite example the real you is somehow amen amen where there is no bloody self in it the song it is the occupation of the souls so many really thinks with his heart a long responsible not with his head which heart kill the girl hello hello this is to tell you okay the gospel healing like Arizona it's a supernatural is your naturality and you are a supernatural amen amen that's good they got the head explained now but no that is if you will just not jump at conclusions foreign the people they don't know I believe that Divine Healing is the best upon a principle there is Divine Healing there's not even as a privacy are you ready to hear that principle is based upon a principle that you ought to come to God first okay and give your heart to him and wash up your lives in the blood of Jesus Christ that God will go to work with foreign foreign foreign I'm a fool but anyways you never think that you are smarter matter oh God know that you are playing Church ill the principle to divide healing yes say give your heart to him first donations I love it so much hypocrisy how many times but once you receive it they forgot everything before foreign [Music] if they can give up foreign [Music] [Music] of God's day [Music]
