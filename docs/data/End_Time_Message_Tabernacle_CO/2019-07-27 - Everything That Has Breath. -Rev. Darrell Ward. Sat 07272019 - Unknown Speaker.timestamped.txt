[25:49] there clean it by mom they said he was a
[25:51] god daddy cuz attention but what did
[25:58] Paul do because go benefit Paul just the
[26:00] Word of God and appear below the jury
[26:02] the poison snake in a pointless up
[26:05] imposing their venom ooh
[26:07] God said judgy you're going to road to
[26:10] valve oh you can't go to wrong about our
[26:13] died from a snake died new here but
[26:15] guess what God change the buzick
[26:18] adjusted snake back this up a little my
[26:20] mother's God's obligated to his work the
[26:23] gym or be jessebella
[26:26] well I tell you brother Darrell I lost
[26:28] you buddy Fred Darrell if I was healthy
[26:30] but my stubborn son Todd price gosh
[26:32] Shalu I just a flop I had no worries and
[26:35] everybody catch it I praise God Lord you
[26:38] if I was wealthy sit-downs not praise
[26:41] God Shalu all that you that's good but I
[26:44] said yeah I'd not be our eyes appears
[26:46] every that yeah but you see the problem
[26:47] is who seven who put them in the Bible
[26:49] ability let everything good - that
[26:53] means I spend hot breath till I speak
[26:56] praise ye the Lord
[26:57] you lay down Ellen let the sad man just
[27:00] a happy man look specifically our poor
[27:04] little bull let the rich Maori sure that
[27:07] the black man let's go silly kid like me
[27:09] love let the red man for the woods at
[27:11] the Richmond healthy man on the moon the
[27:20] ballet everything to change
[27:27] [Applause]
[27:35] amen let everything good - amen
[27:40] but you know there is a reason maybe
[27:42] Rizzo a lot of people don't know this
[27:44] person is pastor but there is a reason
[27:46] in the Bible there's no black I don't
[27:49] know be blue not to give God praise then
[27:50] upon Luigi so if you don't want to
[27:52] praise God and I see we will evaluate
[27:54] justice or if you're looking for a
[27:56] racist solution it is open upon what
[27:58] your worship God anybody overture
[28:00] you can find it in the Bible the twist I
[28:02] don't know be blue it's their degree
[28:05] having no sister who come in from the
[28:07] South case a turkey not sure when a
[28:09] person is far it's their say thickly so
[28:13] anybody a law student so it fits this
[28:15] category as inhabited category you're
[28:18] excused
[28:19] who's that excuse it the Bible said
[28:21] ability and Psalms 115 dumb some
[28:24] something called verse 17

[28:29] said one son can study said the dead
[28:32] limb or price not the loop a little
[28:36] neither no plea that goes down in
[28:40] silence a couple dollars in front of the
[28:42] salon so if you're dead shall I see was
[28:44] that Marxist wha your Excuse who's that
[28:47] excuse a double eternal if you're not
[28:54] dead
