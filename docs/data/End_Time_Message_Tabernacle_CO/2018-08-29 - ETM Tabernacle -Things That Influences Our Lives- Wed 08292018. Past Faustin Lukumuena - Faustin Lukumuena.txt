about your kingdom that's the reason why we have come tonight Oh God to give ourselves to you so that you can have the portion of the day for our soul Lord as we live these last days father we know they're going away and the sacred of the bride is very close does the reason why Lord we don't want to be left behind under the influence of Laodicea but to be completely under the influence of heaven as we live the last days father the two powers hell and heaven ever visited the earth so father to influence human being politics religion social and everything we are coming under the blood that you did shed on the course so that father you can cover each one of your children with your precious blood so that that blood can stand between each one of us and the influence of the world or the influence of the world is so powerful even closer to your influence but only for the sake of the elected father heaven will not let us be destroyed with the world we thank you for your message we thank you for your prophet we thank you for giving us a shelter where we can come under and be influenced by the word coming from above bless your children tonight be with us father guide and direct us in whatever you want Astrid speak take control of our mouth take on to all of our feeling take control of your people's and heels so that we can hear from above all for your Glory's sake we ask and pay in Jesus mighty name amen you may be seated may God bless you we are gonna continue with what we started on Sunday I don't want to make it like a long serie of teaching on influence because I have in mind something different to start teaching on I know we can preach but also teaching is something special so we will be looking for the days to come to have a teaching on the 7 church ages that will be God willing the coming month the month of September October toward the end God willing we will resume and go without the seven church ages which I believe is gonna be like a starting bridge for may be deeper teachings such as these seals the seven seals I realize also there are some people who have been in the message they can just hear preachers touching here touching there about the seals but without a complete understanding of what those seals are about and not only to have the knowledge what these seals are about but to see what was the promise for the aged and out of the seal when I have impact on the life of the believers so that the reason why as I said I'm gonna be brief on this subject of influence there are so many tapes brought up on um preach on influences even though it's the same subject but you know you can take the same subject called ten preachers you will hear different aspect of it so even from the same preacher you ask him to preach the same thing tomorrow certainly there will be input and output so that like the same with the Prophet when he preached influences you will see some tapes just 70 minutes some tapes over 100 minutes so that's how the spirit leads and based on the need of the audience so from last Sunday I did Title II they thinks that influence our life going with this summary from last Sunday we outline three major things the first category are regarding the things we are born with and those are things that influence our everything our way of thinking our way of acting our behavior our character that those things don't depend on you and on me it's just what God has said that's the reason why everyone has different fingerprint everyone is born on a certain date everyone has a different name everyone as a is born under different sign and people studying the zodiac they will tell you they are 12 signs in the zodiac we compared with the 12 months of the year showing that every month every day every hour people being born people also dying so depending on which day under which sign you were born you may have the influence from just that nature and we say that the name that was given to us at the time of birth as brother Bonham said regarding the Evo's mother he said notice those it was murder in their labor in their pain when they start giving delivery giving birth to the child each one was giving a during their labor screaming and whatever they have speak was determining where the child will be whether this tribe will be but all of this it's not because it's by chance but it's a defense preordained by God himself so beside the thing we are born with we being born we inherit and the thing that we inherit is not only coming from your dad and your mom because your dad and your mom is coming also from your grandpa grandma and they have siblings like sisters and brothers so all of these things being a part of a certain family also have influence on human being a character so that's why you can see a child may not be looking like his biologic dad or biologic mom but may be looking like a relative in the family and not only the physical look but also the impact of the character so that's showing us it's a very very big when you get into the understanding of a personality so we are very very different and that's even the reason you can have two people from the same dad and the same mom you will see one looking like my dad and the other one looking like more mom and maybe another one looking like a grandpa grandma or uncle auntie etc so about all these things the two first categories there is nothing really we can do about now the third category is the category of environment so depending on where you will be growing up the type of school you will be doing the type of profession you take one certain person like myself if I was a medical doctor just the fact that I will go to medical school studying there maybe the human being it will change have impact on my personality being an accountant it will change also your personality because it will be more sensitive to numbers and so forth and that's how we see all this character if I want to blend them with marriage it will bring another aspect because this is how even a man and a woman are supposed to be put together because when God in his economy has predestinated a wife for him and God ever both of them in his mind and the way marriage is bringing them to become one God is looking perfection in marriage so that they can be happy so what the man doesn't have God will put it in the husband and vice versa that's why you see certain couple the life is a very smooth because when they come to recognize each one's a position each one what they need to do you will see their life is going to be easier and you take this couple compared with another couple things may not work exactly the same way are you with me so this is really very very deep subject to go because that resort the the character that will put the people together to live I sometimes look at my own relationship with my wife even though you don't say much but you can see in a reality that without her I will not be complete because there are things that I'm a man but I have a lot of limitations I'm the kind of man I don't know how to cook I don't know how even to fix a bedroom if it only depends on me my bedroom the position of the bed can stay there for use I will not bother to change it to but God has given me a wife who after certain time Sammy Jo come here let's put they change the position here the only thing I come I notice I feel it good but to have the initiative to do it brother I have more in my head than that and I believe in every couple that's the way it works regardless of how I can be busy her own bills if I say you pay the bills on time it will be a disaster she will skip oh I forgot you find out penalty and so forth but certain people they are very very organized in the way when I know I have a bill when I know I have to travel blood I don't sleep just I cannot sleep I can set an alarm clock but I work better than an alarm clock sometimes I travel I'm in the hotel home I have to catch a flight earlier and sometimes they hotel they forgot to set up the alarm clock and but I am always up maybe two o'clock in the morning to be ready etc so learning all this aspect of life brother it's not something that you should take lightly because you have to know yourself to know your strengths to know your weakness and those things will help you also to interact with others if you don't know you will always have a problem conflict why I expected you to do this I expected you to do that and the same way we have to come to learn the same aspect with our children and I have a five children they are completely completely different different regardless of how you deal with them whatever you do you will notice that this one can approach you in a way fearless the other one you know a little bit reserved the other one careless so all of these they are part of God's economy and we praise God as also his children being in the century being in the church this is how God want to see us when we some among us when they have needs they cry some they do this some day first we cannot copy one another and it will never work exactly with their children sometimes I give my own testimony I talk to myself today I can be with julia julia has been very very helpful to me think that he/she does no one else can do in the family I work with Julia in the office sometimes we don't have papers for the business we don't have with food with no evidence she can even take her own money to go buy but don't talk about hope hope come to the office to eat and you have to buy for her and hope will tell you daddy don't pay me this much I need this much which Julia never all this time never it's my own discretion I say Julia here your paycheck ah that you would have increased this much thank you she bows they are all the same parent but different personalities and this is how even ourselves as a children of God we need to know where we stand and even when you get to marriage you have to understand how to interact with the spouse and even in the church how to deal with one another because all these things are very important to influence one character your character depends when we talk what a bottom talk about environment environment is everything everyday we interact with not knowing all this detail will point you to a lot of troubles you will be complaining you will be dissatisfied you cannot be happy why because you have the lack of understanding of the people of the environment you are facing so I will leave it up to you to go a little bit more if you want to spend time or to play God so that God can help you assess your own better understanding of your environment so for tonight I will just continue from where we left off so last Sunday I talked about the three things the things that influence our lives and I did not have a chance to get into the specific world of spirit so tonight I'm going to talk about the influence of the Spirit so each person has a spirit if each person has a spirit each house has a spirit each couple has a spirit the church as a spirit the nation has a spirit the world has a spirit so if we don't pay attention we don't under ten they spirit under which we are under we are not going to know how to react and out walk so as we stand for the sake of respect for the reading of the word opening our Bibles in the Book of Amos chapter three reading the first three verses a most three the Bible says this here this word that the Lord has spoken against you O children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth God said I don't know only families but you you defeat my people I know you and I want to emphasize everything I have based on you therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed can two walk together except they be agreed may the Lord are the blessings to the reading of the scripture may be seated so based on this scripture are speaking about different type of influence I want to take the first coat I'm a skit that just to go slowly but for the sake that these things can enter so I want to stack the first coat from the message first thing for life testing for life going to paragraph 29 and this is very important because dealing with one another dealing with responsive dealing with a child dealing with a brother sisters to come to realize how your life your character can be influenced by others you have to have the understanding of the other person spirit that's very very helpful from paragraph 29 brother Bonham said I was saying this the other day and my wife sitting back here listening at me we are going to a store to get some groceries a few weeks ago and right in that winter time we seen a lady with them little bitty clothes on so during the middle of the winter where people are supposed to cover themselves but they notice there is a lady with little bitty clothes on short clothes with little sweater around her my wife said you know she cannot be comfortable like that because of the season well we got to talking about it I said honey when I go when I go to Germany I find I said she is just an American that's all and I said when I go to Germany they have the German spirit national spirit brother you can even assess yourself every country you ever visited there is a different spirit so even the country we are in it's a different spirit and the problem sometimes in dealing with different spirit us believers we don't understand each other there is a saying in our culture Lingala or French they said when you go to a country you find the people dancing with one leg dance also with one leg that's a literal translation Manappuram of dopamine a local one so that make it sound like this is the way to act but it is not anything that is not the Word of God is not gonna succeed they don't they say you go you find us the acting like this you must act like us so that we cannot be in conflict that's all they are worried about but prophet Branham said well do the walls come from because every nation has a spirit every country has a spirit now was arise when one country is not accepting the culture or the spirit of the other nation and that's the same way we are going to end up with a lot of wars in the house if the husband doesn't accept the spirit of the wife and the wife doesn't accept the spirit of the husband and the same way in the church that's why Jesus said Branham said Jesus first doctrine he must be born again once you are born again we all become under the same spirit so let's continue just so natural spirit when I got to fill it they have the finished spirit when I going to see them they have the sweetest spirit when we go to Africa ah they have the African spirit when we come to America they have the American spirit so to say that everywhere they have their own spirit and let me tell you all the spirits of the nations is from the devil there is no nation that can be set as an example with its politic its socialized its economy there is none so therefore we have to look for a nation we have to look for a country where there is the best example of influence of the people in the message Victory Day what a bottom continue paragraph 88 Victory Day Park of 88 so therefore brother we came from Africa either you born here from an America there is no spirit to take you have to die to your spirit and you have to die to the American spirit and take the Christian spirit and after you take that spirit let the rest of your life be under that only Ghost spirit because you can now in summary regardless of our they think we are born with distinct we inherit and the things of our development we have to remain either under the influence of heaven or the influence of him both of 88 now we find that it breaks up the fellowship of whom it breaks up the fellowship of churches it breaks up the fellowship of nation that same things now but I am now getting to detail what is it nations wants to see their own way not only nation people people I want thing to be conducted the way I see it to the extent they don't want to have the influence of the Holy Spirit the way the Holy Spirit wanted but they want their own way I want to enter if this I want this to be done this way I want you to be like this brother no one is the maker of another one so nations want to see their own way Germany want to see their way alone Russia wants to see the way alone America wants to see her way alone see dancy that's it it's the spirit of the nations you find it wherever you go you find a national spirit when I went to I left the Congo before I came to America I spent a whole year in another African country boondi I was the preaching in the church I don't want to go in more detail but when I came there I find the pastor say pastor where are we going to church on Sunday we say no there is no more church to go I say what's going on now I add a church but finally all the believers they were hypocrite and we shut down the church it was a powerful statement sometimes brother with the behavior of the people you can push a minister to do certain action so the pastor was so tired and he said finish I say no but we cannot go like this he told me I know you were a pastor in Congo if you want to take over take over but I'm done I say I'm not gonna do anything but I want you to reopen the church whatever it takes so with him we went to visit all the believers talking to them talking to them afterward they came back and the pastor said you take the church in Chad I said no I did not come here to Pastor your church you remain the pastor if you want me to help you with the preaching that's what I'm gonna do and so we said that how we did I was helping him but the national spirit the people from Burundi they are not like Congolese when you deal with them they tell you you come beliefs you are not smart why do you express your emotion easily here we don't express emotions you know Congolese when there is somebody dead in the family I can come I cry publicly I've all over over there they don't do that you have to show our strong personality you have so my husband I might also ever die when people come I want to show them my personality that I'm a strong person by not crying but it's hard but it's national and you lose you see them they don't if really they want to cry they go on a side maybe in the bedroom they cry they come up like nothing happened therefore that have a impact even in the church you preach there I don't know if things have changed you push that nobody says Amen when it's get into more detail digested my messages started on I preached them a serie of the national spirit it was really breaking breaking breaking until you see the nature of the Christian being different from the nation and when I was living to come to America one cyst I never forget he said brother you helped us so much we were like bananas without identity but we thank God but this is to say every nation has a spirit we can talk even not only nation within the nation like the Congolese you can see the communist when a boon diem does something hey I'm going to beat you I'm gonna beat you don't talk just look at this these guys is stupid why do you expose yourself so if the enemy can know how you think damn they don't do that they are just quiet you inserted him but the day he got you that's your death at a spot where you cannot move so that's a national spirit but the Congolese beside that Congolese is about showing off normally in the pocket deep we turn like they have a lot the way they talk the way they show of international spirit therefore when the gospel the message come is as to every impact influence on your life but you cannot have influence over you if you don't recognize and accept your mistakes that there is a spirit over me but if you don't recognize that there is a spirit you anything that you have the word you have the Holy Ghost now the only ghost has gone to make us one people one spirit one Accord and that's why you see sometimes brother branham preaching you know what abana used to use a certain natural example he said when we go to the restaurant you can eat this I can it is this when we come to the bones what do we do we just eat the meat and put the meat aside the bones inside this is how to show that we have to tolerate one another to accept one another but us that's not the case if I eat this kind of food everybody has to eat it that's where the problems come and breaks our families breaks our churches breaks everything so to continue if a brother branham here he said you find it wherever you go you'll find a national spirit I went in and they have different ways it's strange if I had the time I would just like to skip through some of the nations and show you so they are he can show you by nation what is really dominating paragraph 90 when you go in you go into Germany you find a military spirit everything is military you know the history of Germany with Adolf Hitler the only thing he had in mind was to make Germany very strong and dominate over everybody and he went to conquer every country etc and during their conquer they went to fight France they fight they weren't even to Belgium this is where they got the expression media cut OSA the Germany the German army was a Belgium in two hours belch Belgium did not fight and they caused it from noon to two media ketosis when they say sheriff is the media ketosis that's exactly what the German have done to the Belgium to our it's a small country to our foreign or - to Belgium Finnish they went on so that's based on that on the spirit that was on the leader that has impacted the entire nation you have a leader based on corruption no wonder Congo is under what they are and they call corruption cooperation and in the spirit of the nation you put somebody with a certain logical plan to put the thing in order the Salem vicuna um Tobin sambucol that'd national spirit intensive really a revival from the Holy Ghost to change those people so that's the military spirit you have to stand straight walk straight cut your corners and everything it's a military bog of 91 you go into face you find any immoral spirit just women and wine and liquor and stuff like that see you go into Finland you find a lawyer' spirit kind of like everything is honest we must pay off everything for their nation the national spirit not paying your debt is a shame so everybody respect they think of the the government etc everything is in order our people who have been in the Congo recently I was surprised in Kinshasa people also lining up to get into the bus I was looking as it does not scream just I knew Contessa everybody in the corner just the Basques up if I can grab the window I get him catch my seat and so forth but you know a country like this one everything was line up and you know when even if you have the Holy Ghost now let me pause it here even if you have the Holy Ghost your only ghost must help you realize and recognize the spirit of the country if it's a tool only ghost otherwise you will see people with the Holy Ghost but because of the influence of the place they are living in you will not be surprised somebody with the Holy Ghost is student going to university the bus stops he jump on the way to sit quietly he did not insult anybody he did not do anything wrong but that's national spirit it's not a problem because he was born and found the habit he's that doing this mom doing this everybody doing it so it's not a shame anymore paragraph 93 you go into America you find a big hahahahahaha what that's what it is yay that's American spirit somebody tells a dirty joke on the radio and everybody loves edit Ernie for those are the people from the time or some of them cracking jokes that they have you know everywhere Arthur Godfrey and that group like that that's American spirit you find that you find it that way now paragraph 94 Burnham now say and then does spirit get jealous of another spirit so now everybody has a spirit not only nation but the people each individual each church each group each person under as a certain spirit and does the spirit they become also jealous with another spirit that's where the problems are they husband spirit may be jealous against the wife and vice versa etcetera you go to church you find everybody getting in a certain way then a certain spirit that we come the spirit dominant of the church and what do they do they cause war that's right now you see every nation is controlled by Satan so all the national spirit the bottom line is certain behind that's why as I'm upbringing this the purpose is not just to know what the spirit are doing but to be born again until you get really born again whether those things will always have impact over your life and weave the things whether it's going to draw you down and you cannot overcome you cannot live a good Christian life because of influences skipping to powder of 96 let me finish 95 the Bible said so he's the god of the nation's talking about Satan Satan took Jesus up top the mountain and said show him all the kingdoms was in the world or the kingdom in a moment of time said these are mine I do with them anything I want to and brother Bonham said somewhere well Satan said all of this is mine brother Branham said Jesus never contradict him read the Bible Jesus never said no say that it's not you it's mine jesus knew that he can claim this until my kingdom with the new world people will be established when he will be tied up but love 96 Jesus said get behind me Satan he knew he was going to fall he'll to them in the Millennium see so he didn't have to bow down to him he knowed they was going 97 now when God comes again and tech makes his kingdom here see there will be not there will not be any kind of spirit a German spirit and the French spirit and no venture spirit an American spirit an African spirit they won't be that there will be one spirit amen the Spirit of God living in every heart hallelujah so that's the purpose of studying those influence so that we can get his spirit and be born again this way we will be one people under one headship the Spirit of God living in every heart that's right and there will be one flag one nation one people one Brotherhood a Fatherhood of God and a brotherhood of man sonship yes amen toward the end of bag of 98 but a bottom said also there is a national spirit here a national spirit here it's Devils so we cannot be proud saying whether this is how people and the different influences they don't even know and you'll see an African person we coming from Africa maybe with the African spirit they come here easily they don't want to do nothing with Africa they want everything to be America it's just changing spirit it's not taking you any further you are just changing the place of acting from an African mentality to an American mentality American mentality is not superior to African mentality they are both the same because they are from the devil so they think - do you see an African person coming from Africa you come here even a young boys they want to dress in a certain way sag their paint poke their ears knows and so forth it's just stupidity under the same devil even the woman man Christian time to add and impersonate the world because of influence but we thank God there is one word one message to bring us in in the message God identifying himself by his characteristics now we are getting those are the broad picture now we get into the church the Spirit of God can be identified by its characteristics by well characteristic see the Spirit of God and the spirit of the church there is a church spirit and a spirit of God that's absolutely not like the church spirit at all so it's not because you are in the church that you get a spirit of God no not necessary because in the church they are many individual this individual has a spirit if the spirit of individual can influence your spirit even being in the church you are under the same nation under the same devil that's why brother you come to church to look for your personal relationship with God not relationship with one another and that's the problem with the people they find a favour of people I want to do like so-and-so I want to act like so and so when so-and-so as an issue like this I'm going to follow and when showing so say I don't like this I don't like that also if they say I like it I like it also that's where all this cause of problems are because people have come to church they did not get the Spirit of God they have get a spirit of people in the church and what is leading them now you get a spirit of a man in a church it's going to take you to hell let the nation's until you come to be born again die to your spirit and receive the spirit of christ the way jesus said he must be born again not even the spirit of the pastor not even the spirit of the bishop not-not-not know you are called to receive the Spirit of Christ but that's why on this subject of influence we can go on and on and on you see the people in the church even ladies she can be a nice lady dressing in a certain way but let there be a certain woman dressing fashion in a certain way they look they look they look after why they copy where this is coming from this is just the spirit getting one another spirit no wonder you can see you can watch people the way they live the people to the extent the people in the church become more comfortable we've seen because it's part of so-and-so life as government survey said directors important people become to the extent they become very comfortable you are preventing me from doing this but you did not see sister so and so she's the pastor's wife she's the pastor's daughter she's the minister's she's even going with men the same way brother we are not coming to get one another spirit each person as a spirit but your duty is to be under the influence of heaven this way you detect the spirit of other people and if you have the Holy Ghost the only boss is gonna lead you always under they need the influence of God you see some people they have no backbone at all I call it no backbone at all wake up in the morning it's a Sunday and then their husband saying I'm a little bit tired I'm not going to go oh you are not going to go me also I mean it's so simple very simple those little stupid example but it means a lot do those means just the influence under which people are living Delhi Delhi every decision under influence I have to keep some of these to push it a little bit on Sunday people are copying one another spirit brother if you study with your method you study yourself I rather be myself and my own influence either I'm wrong all right but never to impersonate anybody never to copy one another spirit because brother if I go more in depth you will be surprised maybe the person you are paddling after do you know that person really can be a magician a sorcerer witchcraft and that's what you are serving yourself as an example you are fooling yourself that's why my prayer is I want each one of us to recognize they think that influence your personality your character and staying with God and God alone God is not in the spirit of groups oh my group my group our group and sometimes the group get also a certain spirit and they have somebody in the group who is more influence was more influenced to influence others one day you can set up and say I don't like the pastor I don't like that the preacher I don't like the butcher and everybody will do the same oh man God have mercy that's why but when I'm said in the message God is your life worthy of the gospel he said the Holy Ghost is not accessible where everybody come and dump the garbage they stuff in and you see people taking it easily somebody can know that my I'm not a Christian I am NOT going to go to heaven they know and our purpose now is to pull as many people as they can that's why you watch their behavior their action their conversation nothing positive always negative about somebody always negative about something and they will never come to appreciate anything regardless of what and that as a significant influence if you don't come to recognize it you are going to perish that's why the Word of God has called us to be more mature Christian under the influence of heaven with the Holy Ghost so Branham said there is a church spirit and the Spirit of God that's absolutely not like the church spirit at all and then he said there is a denominational spirit what is a denominational spirit the denominational spirit in the last day there is a denominational spirit denominational spirit is not because you ever put the name on the church you know when the message came first we were calling or if you notice all the churches in the past we used to call them assembly with the name of the city assembly the beginning assembly the básico assembly day it was assembly assembly why the first conception of the people it was to avoid denomination when you put a certain era that's denomination that's a name until people start realizing that there is a church called the Branham Tabernacle when I'm tabernacle and then they change from assemblies to everything now until today is doubly job Anaka until we ever finished all the name in the message we finish all the name in the Bible and recently when I was in the Congo I found out there is a tabernacle call Branham and meda tabernacle I tell brother obeyed take me I want to see the tabernacle to show you that better people have gone far with tabernacle there is no name left you will called Zoe Tabernacle they will say so a table a map in which my Zoe dominating just a suitable dragon face so in the same name you talk about shallow tabernacle Shalom to vinegar Shalom to vinegar shalom Davina and time acceptable and demonstrably anti-missile everywhere so therefore people are tired now let's go to something new maida and Branham Tabernacle something different below basically though this is to show that brother it's not the spirit of denomination is not by the name you can call yourself whatever big Tabernacle you know Zoe Israel Goshen good name in the message but it's not what make you special it's not what is going to prevent the denominational spirit what is the denomination spirit the spirit where you have one person having influence over others so you come into the message church and then you have your little group it within the church and with that group you have one person who have more influence over other that's just a denomination spirit and the denomination spirit is always against the word and they will never okay with the word they will always try to look you see you see this is not this is not its spirit Branham continue there is a national spirit there is a spirit of the nation every nation where I go into you walk in there you find a different spirit I think we read this I'm gonna skip it a little bit so if every nation has a spirit each person has a spirit each person and the people forming the church the church is form with many people with many spirit that's why when we pray we have to pray for the church pray that God you keep this church under your influence and you are alone otherwise brother if you don't have that understanding tomorrow the church all the church they will end up getting the spirit even of the pastor that's it and people to a certain extent they will turn and start worshiping the pastor they don't say we worship the pastor but that's exactly what they are doing and which spirit is that it's a death that's why I want to love the pasta I want to pay for the pasta but I want the spirit to be the Spirit of God over my life over my influence but what I'm said in the message God keeps his word part of 79 skipping toward where I have highlighted random said I have went in the churches and I say this we've referenced now I find that many times in the church in the churches I believe people get one another spirit is dead of the Holy Spirit I will the Prophet Branham said he fighted many times in the churches people going to the church instead of getting the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit they get one another spirit and that one another spirit is communicating someone with a certain spirit come always trying to influence you in the not even word but action and that's what you see sometimes people in the church they started finding coming late is not a problem hello but anything contrary to the word it's what denominations are doing is the spirit of the denomination but God sent a prophet telling us 30 minutes before we have to be there as simple as that why people don't do that I know people may have a valid excuses where is God for it but there are also people to the other extreme say ah 7 o'clock this is a time they decide to leave home then there will be there around seven five seven time depending on where they are coming for and to the a certain extent that become normal and you add one abbot upon another abbot laying it's become so simple so in social is like and you see it's just that spirit become so common and popular among the people to the extent people start grading the level of lies they start grading the level of sin or if somebody commits adultery that pastor has to sit down he has to sit down he's not worthy but when the pastor is taking all the advantage of the money it's not a sin even though Branham said watch those three things money women and people emphasize only woman if the pastor goes with a woman the board will be every bidding and say well what a bottom said in the sale of a booze if a deacon commits adultery they memorize even the paragraph that night the past is going to tell a dick and not to come to church and they will present a problem to the church and they will vote him out and design appoint another one no Scott we know but when it come to this people start grading level it's not about level it's not about how you perceive it it's not what is more important to your site but it's what is the spirit behind if it's not crisis with it everything else is wrong continue to read Burnham so I believe people get one another spirit is in the stead of the Holy Spirit you go into a church and watch where the pastor may be judge his head the whole congregation will do it whether it's what bottom is saying is a spiritual there are not many people as pastors reject their head but what is saying is is certain happy to form the pastor and everybody will copy the pastor is a human being but let his action that is only goes to lead influence your life but if he does something that is not the word you don't need to take it you go into the church where the pastor says he has got all running from his hand the first thing you know the whole company believes that and they have it go into a church where there is a lot of dancing and jumping and running around amen if the posture like this type of they will do but you know that in general but sometimes the same people even if the pastor does doesn't like a certain music that will sell people they will like that music and when there is a constant in town you will find them still hello did I say something go into a church oh no I'm not condemning these things I am just speaking from an observation to present a point to you is that what the Prophet said he's not condemning or you go to dance or you have done this I'm not condemning but I'm just making a point if you will get a posture that's very emotional the whole congregation will be emotional you get a posture that starch and stiff and the whole congregation will be starchy and stiff I believe you receive each other's spirit now two can walk together unless they agree when I'm saying it Ferg of 82 take a good man and a bad woman and put them together one will go to the other a man this is the absolute truth you take a believer you marry them with a non-believer one will go the other way that's why Branham said under no circumstance a believer cannot marry an unbeliever because of that scripture he will go one way or another way and you know very often young people they take they simplify the scripture everybody going into the marriage I know the man I know the woman and they say within themselves oh no don't worry I'm gonna change him as you are thinking you are gonna change him the other person also he's thinking about changing you and nobody says it openly but you go like that and then when you get there they're changing battle will start and then he will start wondering that the brother was a very spiritual brother until until he got married that sister that's why taking precautions is safe Branham said marry somebody who believe exactly like you to avoid all these things but very often we have other motives other influence it's an influence because so-and-so has been married I have to be married but is it the time everybody was born under Saturday but everybody must be married a certain time everybody will get a car and certain time everybody will buy a house a certain day but under influence everybody's looking this one came here they told me ah inner houses are cheaper I'm going brother have you look are you under the influence of God or are you under the influence of housing material in flu that's the killer and you will die under that influence so he said one will go to the other it will either become a bad man a good woman see to cannot work together except they be agreed that the scripture we read to cannot work together unless they agree when you see people with different spirit they will not work together very often you say when this person come I know already in advance the purpose is coming to visit me is to tell me they were doing of somebody go read a message I will read it God willing sunday is your life worship of the gospel but a bottom said you know there are some people you don't want to be around because every time they are there regardless of what you do what you say they will always try to bring somebody on the scene even though what they are bringing is true but that's their spirit everywhere that's what it is everywhere and there are also people under the same anointing but is functioning on the opposite one one to talk the other one cannot stop him but another one want also to listen to know everything it's also the same spirit they want to know I want to know I want to know this way I control everything but we have I will read the rest of those things later on where was it so crime escapees so it's very very important because Branham said what really the influence is I will be deported winning Sunday he said if we can have only two real believers in our congregation it can change also the whole congregation that the people who can help really others the people who are really have influence of others they don't copy one another because you have a body car but I we know in America all the car most of the car it's as a note we know that some with a two percent interest up to thirty nine percent interest but they are on the same Road if you don't know they spirit leading you to get it you are gonna get yourself in a lot of mess a lot of miss is not so on so as one time you can see somebody buying a car maybe a brand new car his monthly payment is four hundred dollars but you go buy a old car your monthly payment is six hundred dollars but where are we going this is a spirit of the nation to paralyze those who are suffering and to lessen the burden of those who are good going everywhere even the insurance go get the car insurance for maybe my jaw here they will charge you maybe eight hundred dollars because of his age but the older you come more mature if it was only for myself I can pay insurance for fifty dollars all these elements are very important in making your life in determining your character every influence over your life it's very important brother don't copy one another don't look at one another what they are doing because God has called you separately don't do things because other people are doing don't buy because sir Sir is buying you can see somebody you know he does well he dressed well but if they tell you the secret maybe most of them are gift it's a position it's a situation but some others you have to scratch them the food skip meals for the children just to show that you are somebody so as a bottom said you take a good person you put him a bank they bad that's why they said you take a good Apple you put it among bad apples it's going to affect the rest of the Apple so each person has to take precaution measure we have to take precaution measure discerning spirit in the method they chose aim of a bride how to choose a bride the choosing of a bride para 52 Burnham said the same applies by choosing a church now you must pray over the church that you are going you are fellowshiping in remember churches carry a spirit it's not because there is a name or there are a lot of people or there are few people I want to go oh no because John goes there and who goes there because we came from the same family so I go the choosing of a church is the same as the choosing of a bride if God reveals to you that your wife is in Congo I'm not going to marry anybody here I'm gonna do my best until I get to Congo get my citizenship go marry this year that's how people are doing now right you got this here you set an order traditional and a civil marriage and you get the marriage license you come back quickly and you schedule a marriage in a year knowing that within a year if I'm a citizen I will have all the paper by next year when I go I do the religious I take my wife to go it's a pattern everybody's copying one another but we have got to a lot in the message we have gone to a lot and all of this is influenced and that there can be the influence of a church over another church that's also in influence our church is influenced by the auditors but Branham says watch out churches every spirit why you want to take the spirit of another church to another church and people traveling all over they come from a church they go to another Church they carry the spirit they want to impose that Judge spirit to the new church are you with me all of this is influence that we have to pay attention we have to open our eyes and play God God help the pastor and the minister so that yourself regardless of what they do in the right of world but we want them to be under you and the worst part is to copy one another's influence there was a time we did not hear a lot of dedication in the message everybody was building the church under a certain tree and put some roof that's it and then we start worshipping myself I have a build I don't know how many churches back in the Congo never done the dedication but as the lights come we started to doing and understanding what dedication this one study further education the next door it is next dedication I don't say it's wrong but I'm just showing you how people how every as words if they have them dedication dedication they have a builder church so we have to build our church and you go after the people you bring this one you just graduate you make this much money therefore you have to contribute this much you for which purpose what is the purpose when it's time where is there is need God will lead you and open up a way but we are not waiting upon the Lord to lead and guide us we are forcing things on our own and sometimes even the believers putting pressure on the pastor pastor you know we are I think we have to build a new sanctuary I have a $10,000 I can give ten thousand gonna be enough you don't believe God will provide the rest let us just that and you start with the foundation and it doesn't go nowhere and you start going to businesses downtown collecting money for the church for it really this feed for us as a Christian all of this is a problem of influence of spirits over people Bonham said remember churches carry a spirit now I don't want to be critical that's exactly why brother missing I am NOT critical either but it making the point for whosoever can grasp it from now on to study what is your influence otherwise brother we are going far not talking about the influence of the parent the influence of the family and you see even people the part of the father come say you know my dad used to tell me regardless of what you will do if I come to your house I will open your fridge take whatever I want and I can beat you before your children I mean that's African mentality but if we are Christian we have to learn to do things according to the Word of God everything should be after the word and you see some people some family even you see my son is married already tomorrow I come because my daughter-in-law has done something I'm not pleased I start putting influence of a match my son you see that daughter your wife she did not come from a good family anyway you are the tailor she is a bunda therefore we are going to look for you a good detailer wife and you see a brother sitting there in the church buying that idea and then with that idea you will not tolerate your wife any longer everything will become bad why because it's not you acting but it's the influence of the seed you have been receiving you know she's not from our country Jesus won our time she's not from our language therefore we can get you a good one we can get you a good one we can get you a good one until that desert will settle in your heart and therefore tomorrow let's go see the pastor tomorrow the pastor until the past is tired don't know what to do and tomorrow we go to the court the judge is going to ask certain believers don't you have a pastor why you cannot serve this when the pastor can oh brother they were not believer in the first place if they were believers they will bring their matter to their pastor but in the personal servant which kind of people are they they are not believers therefore we leave them into the end of the court let's Cesar handle their case it's unfortunate but that's the truth I don't want to be critical but I realize that I'm a old man and I got to live here one of these days Alleluia which year was it Branham it was April 65 hey what are you talking about panel I am a prophet so when I'm telling you about this influence I'm about to leave the scene and I wanted to stay with this message one of these days I'm going to leave the scene but I wanted to make sure that the message about influence is working like the choosing of a bride I have I've got to answer at the day of the judgement for what I say tonight or any other time and I therefore got to be dead earnest and truly convicted April 1965 December 1965 sir this day this scripture was fulfilled but for which purpose Branham said it for which purpose God allowed Branum to sell it it was not for him to go with it it was for us the future generation that's why he said those tape will go all over and us today with the privilege to lead these things we have to realize that brother I refuse anybody's influence I refuse any Church influence I we will cooperate we are brothers we are sisters we will cooperate but as far as like sharing a headquarter when I'm said this is the characteristic of a denomination go to the Catholic Church Sunday they all read from the same scripture because they get the order from their schedule from everywhere whether it's the sad part even today you will hear people saying you know we listen to brother branham tapes we listen to brother branham tapes in our church but sometimes they will get to a spot the same church is being played to many many churches at the same time we are pushing the Holy Ghost out Branham said for a local congregation there is nobody between the elder who's the pastor and God nobody in there you put somebody that's a denomination spirit para 54 but you go into a church and if you will watch the behavior of that church you just watch the pastor a while and you will usually find that the church arts like the pastor it's all more the same you know in faith we used to say tell pear tell me that's how it is sometimes I wonder if we just don't get one another spirit in the stead of the Holy Spirit you get to a place where a pastor is real radical and carrying on you will find out the congregation is the same way I will bring you to a church where I see the pastor stand jerk their heads back and forth you want the congregation they do the same thing you take a pastor just gulp down anything usually the church will do the same thing oh brother so if I was choosing a church I would choose a genuine fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church I was choosing one to put my family in EM I usually now people are not looking at what the church represent they go in the church because they have certain thing they want to be in the church I have to choose the church because it's located closer to my house because driving thirty minutes to go to church it become far Burnham told us the choosing of a church is not about the business the choosing of the church is not about the pastor is for my family or my country but I have to watch and study with the world and depending on what you are looking for then the Holy Spirit will guide you otherwise brother there will be so many many kills in the churches because of influence and you see somebody find it himself oh brother move come over here because here the event is here is and even to the extent they will tell you you know here the pastor is a liberal and you will not see the pastor trying to find out your life they don't pay attached they don't even know you they don't even care about you you want to get married their past is not even involved the only thing you do you find a girl just go talk to a girl even if you make an already pregnant just go see the pastor say pastor we did a mistake bless us tomorrow and then it will be done and that's what people are choosing to be the pastor of the pastor and with the knowledge they have accumulated over the years they said this one is doesn't know much brother we are just here because we have to be here he's a cool guy but as far as a sermon he's nowhere and we like that we want the freedom but let me tell you a good ship will look for the best shepherd to guide him and get his family blessed be the name of the Lord let us stand with God I really want you to really study the things of influence and make sure that you understand it and you stay under God influence probably God willing I'm gonna close this on Sunday and for those we're here Sunday I did our schedule by a meeting next week on Wednesday and Friday but I did not know there was a certain program that will not allow us to be able to do it on Friday so God willing Wednesday only we will have a prayer and now the Friday has been postponed to future time you [Music] a side [Music] they won't be [Music] [Music] [Music] yes bye [Music] [Music] we've been [Music] you
