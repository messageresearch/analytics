[1:19:59] thing when a child is born is to try to
[1:20:01] teach them how to sit then to try to
[1:20:03] make him walk and so it is that we doing

[1:20:15] properly then they started teaching me
[1:20:17] how to walk again by God's grace you
[1:20:24] know when that happened to me and one
[1:20:32] time I was sitting and head in my ears
[1:20:39] brother branham's and in that message
[1:20:45] that bourbon was preaching the dip he
[1:20:47] said something that really touched me

[1:20:58] a loose and I'll never lose and
[1:21:03] overcoming a voluma kind of a solid
[1:21:06] appear and in a prayer line he said
[1:21:13] and I see I see you put me between you

[1:22:41] bit of additional reading and since I
[1:22:44] couldn't walk anymore is because that
