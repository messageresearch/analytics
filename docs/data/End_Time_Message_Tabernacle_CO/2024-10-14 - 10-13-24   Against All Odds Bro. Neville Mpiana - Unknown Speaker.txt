God bless you all are you happy to be back in the house of the Lord uh let's quickly open our Bible before you see um in the Book of Judges uh chapter 3 verse 31st Jud judges chter 3: 31st after a came Shamar son of Anna who struck down 600 Philistine with the Oaks goat it to he to save [Music] Israel uh let's also read judge 56 and then we going to read Romans 4:8 in the in the days of Shamar son of Anna in the days of jail the highway were abandoned Travelers took the winding winding path in Israel will not fight they held back until I de arose Roman 4 verse 18 uh I would like also to read and there's a translation that I like but let's start with the King James version King James who against hope believed in hope that they might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall that uh the version that I was talking about uh it's the passion translation uh it says it says against whole OD when looked hopeless Abraham believed the promise and expected God to fulfill it he he took God at his word as a result he became the fathers of the father of many nations God's declaration over him came to pass amen uh you may be seated are you happy to be back in the house of God um I just I like to remind you few announcement that we uh that was done last Sunday there will be a church service on Friday 25th on Friday evening uh at the evening usually 6:50 p.m. something like that so the the pastor is asking us to make a necessary adjustment to attend the service and also uh brother Matthew got married on Friday we would like to send our best wishes and blessings uh we stream the the blessings the wedding it was wonderful and a beautiful ceremony and uh we thank God for the the brothers that went to support him there and I believe we were well represented and we pray that God will bring them safe amen amen uh just to clean some hair and turn around check someone's hand I feel like there's a lot of tension in the air right now amen God bless you brother bless you brother God bless you my sister feel free in the presence of God Amen the Bible says where the spirit of God is there is liberty so feel free this morning I'm going to be preaching with you amen amen because the prophet says the people that the one pulling amen amen so that's why I say feel [Music] free there's one story I remember in s Africa there was one brother used to be very active in the church he would say Amen to the word he was responding to the word but that day he came along with his wife and the wife told him don't embarrass me today don't embarrass me today I want you to keep quiet don't be yelling don't be shouting since the brother was not working it was not working and the the wife was working the brother came to church he was listening to the word the pastor noticed that the brother that day was quiet the pastor was what's going on okay as the preach preaching was going on the Golden Nugget was kept on coming and the brother couldn't hold himself the wife told him first if you embarrass me today I'm going to take your shoes and then the brother since he couldn't hold himself he stood up he said shoes or no shoes that's the truth morning shoes or no shoes you respond to the word money or no money you will respond to the word praise God Amen Hallelujah am that's why we're so happy to be back in the house of the Lord because when you say Amen it's not to flatter the minister ego no no you're just reinforcing our camp because we only have two we we have the army of the Living God and we have the army of the devil so when you responding you're just enforcing your Camp just enforcing your side you telling the preacher let's finish the deviling it let's finish him today so if you're staying quiet I don't know what side you on amen amen just bring it on we thank the pastor for such an order for for giving us this opportunity to stand before you and um I'm kind of like the sa you know uh you know the sub they only put the sub at the end of the game right who is Brother Joshua is's my athlete so you put you put the sub at the end at the end of the game because the game is about to end the first you pull like the starters they make sure to win the game because you're putting your best players amen amen so they started the St just come at the end the the sub comes at the end and then uh to just to you know just to to rest the the status they've been playing well they've been playing for a long time and then they want to rest them and the Holy Ghost through the pastor allow us to be at the end so we're just hopping we're just like a spray Tire you know as a sub if you messed up since the game at the end we're not going to lose the game anyway we're not going to lose anyway you know why even if it happens I lost the I lose I lose the ball and then the enemy they about to score have the referee on our camp we have the referee on our camp just when the enemy wants to score the ref will stop the game so anyway we know how the story hand will not lose this battle we will not lose this game regardless of what comes regardless your ups and down you will not lose this battle you will not lose this game it's good to know the end of the story I love happy ending I don't know how you watch a drummer the way I watch my drummer I like to see the end of it to see how it's going to end then I can start from the beginning if I know it's ending it's now ending well I'm not going to watch it I don't want to end up crying so I want to make sure I want to make sure the story ends well our story will always end well so we are fighting a battle that Jesus already won we are fighting a battle that Jesus already won you will never lose this battle anyway no matter comes your way your sickness actually is temporary you going to be healed that's the end of the story it will not be Eternal it will never be Eternal praise God amen amen amen let's go to our uh preaching today if I keep talking I might not preach amen amen so today I was going to talk about just I will try also to be sure today again was so happy last Wednesday because I was extremely short I will try to keep short today so today I I entitled my topic my sermon Against All Odds Against All Odds what is the odds the odds it's the probability or How likely it is a particular thing will or will not happen the chance of the or the possibility of something or the impossibility or or when you says the ODS are in someone's favor you mean uh the they are likely to succeed they are likely to succeed in what they doing in sport it mean when you say that the old are in favor of that team they usually base the ODS on fact based on the strength the way they play the strength and the weakness techniques the coach they probably have the best player in the team therefore they have more chance to win are in the favor on fact like when the United State went to the Olympic game the basketball team had the best players they have Sten Curry all the best players in the team so the St statistic were showing they will win the gold the golden medal so it's based on fact scientific fact or when also you say the ODS are against you simply means they unlikely to succeed they don't have many chance it's based on fact it's based on medical reports it's based on history it's based on science experience amen amen so they are less likely to succeed legally so if they say the odds against you legally so you're you're less likely to to win that case I'm trying to be place the foundation to explain what is the art if they say you going to the Arts against you legally you will be IND inducted you'll be condemned based on evidence based on evidence you stole or you cheated you lied you did this and you are destined to to jail all the against you I don't know if you remember this hisory the story Brother Richard uh told us last Sunday about brother with his Pastor so all the evidence shown that he was guilty there was a video to prove it they had a strong K against him and tonight I want to tell you God loves when the odds are against you when all the odds are against you when all the medical reports are against you when all the doctors says it's done is an expert when it comes to Impossible cases with the expert when it comes to Impossible cases it's the god of impossible situation he likes when the odds are against you Abraham the prophet says let's read it in the book The Message identification of Christ in all the identification of Christ in all ages paragra 91 the prophet Abraham he was persuaded that God was able to keep anything that he promised called anything contrary to the word wasn't he just went on on just the same against scientific the scientific proofs against reasons against hope against all the OD against everything there was against all the ODS God words came first Abraham said let everything else be wrong he was going to have the baby and he had it see because he believed it so imagine an old man 100 years old with a 80 years old wife waiting expecting to have a baby it's insane it's even to think about shocking you having imagine old man 100 years old he can barely walk expecting to have a baby all the odds were piling against him first of all the prophet says they couldn't even have pleasure together even if they had pleasure abam lost all his manhood Sarah was too whole handle giving birth I've been in a delivery room H it's it's unbearable you know uh excuse me but I think we should congratulate our we should respect and congratulate our mothers because that's a painful things to see I don't want to talk about my wife because she made a whole scene because I'm going to be in trouble if I talk about her but it's veryable to see that but imagine old old old woman going through that that was going to be impossible she didn't even have milk to breastfeed the baby back in the day they didn't have formula all the odds was against Abraham the Bible says Abraham considered not his body as being dead his own body was dead but Abraham still believed just think of it but he said as long as God promised it he will do it it doesn't matter how long it takes a matter of fact the longer it takes the great is the Miracles the longer it takes the greater will be the miracle then they went to start buying clothes for the baby diapers the doctor could have said this old men SN like they said today he lost his mind snapped his age is going to buy diapers what is he waiting for but as long as God said it I don't I don't have to reason I don't have to question it I don't have to go to school to question it I just believe the way it is crazy as it can sound I just believe it that way all the Abraham received the son God loves to beat [Music] the god lovees to beat the ODS I want to tell somebody tonight no matter what the science said like I said on Wednesday no matter what the city said no matter what the scanner says no matter all the specialist of the world says as long as God said it it that can beat all the ODS amen the evidence can be against you every eye witness is against you it is impossible to win that case you don't even have a chance everything seems impossible even in your own conscience your own conscience condemns you you know you are guilty you have no argument to attack done you have to just to plead guilty go to hell go to the jail that's the case God loves to take he's the best lawyer he likes to take that kind of case amen he's the only lawyer who has 100% winning case he never lost a case you never lost a case if it stand for you you have more than 100% to win that case amen Daniel Curry Daniel Curry Daniel Curry Daniel Curry they were showing all the evidence did he ever lie when you were on the Earth looked I lied yes I lied did you ever take somebody stuff when you on the earth I did then you are condemned you see yourself you are condemned that is why we got to be careful because the prophet says every move everything that we do being recorded and one day it's going to be played for you watch your step watch your action everything that you do is being recorded amen amen you are being CCTV you are being CCTV your move it's going to be play before you but Daniel Curry you are condemned he thought he was righteous he thought he was righteous he thought he was somebody on the earth up there at the throne there was nothing the Bible says our own righteousness government before God our righteousness cannot stand before God he was going to H he was going to H he was condemned but he turn you heard the voice he the sweetest voice I ever heard the sweetest voice he turn saw the sweetest face he never seen Minute father wait a minute wait a minute I'm Daniel lawyer I'm Daniel lawyer wait a minute it's not just going to hell like that wait a minute I'm going to submit an appeal going to submit the appe I'm taking this case I'm taking this case praise God God when he was on the earth when Daniel was on the earth he stood for me stood for me when he was he stood for me inan age the filthiest of age stood for me he believed this message I'm standing for him I'm also standing for him put all his SE on put all his put all his lies put all his adulteries all is last put down me put down me but is innocent like he's never done it in the first place you've never done in the first place he never lost a case that's why you need to take him as a lawyer tonight this morning a physician amen he never lost a patient he never lost a patient he never lost a patient he's that kind of physician he never lost a patient I remember a woman brother bam was talking about a woman that woman he didn't have a nose he didn't have a nose Hallelujah one day she came in the prayer line she had an anchi cing covering her nose covering her nose didn't have a nose all a nose was eating off saw her in the prayer line on Wednesday he said the Lord you are healed that said the Lord never missed that said the Lord never missed amen and she turned she was heal she went back to a specialist her she was rejected to from all the Physicians all the specialist they didn't want to take a case they said your case is done every time she go to the specialist they will kick her out your Cas is impossible go away but when she was healed she went back to see all the specialist she went back to specialist looked at them she told she told them look at me go back to your enemies tell them look at me now Look at me now the doctor said what happened to you what happened to you he said she said I changed the doctor she said I changed the doctor the doctor said who did you see I know all the specialist I know your case it's impossible who did you see she said I seen do Jesus I seen doctor Jesus there's a doctor Jesus this morning change your doctor if the doctor said it's impossible change the doctor the greatest physician is here now God he he had one prescription he had one prescription he I the Lord I am the Lord who Health who heal who Health all all all not some of the disease cancer TB diabetes oh do all all all your diseases for all your diseases there's no one disease that he cannot heal is a doctor his cabinet I don't know if you call it office his office is always open he never closed he never closed he never closed he works 24 hours service 24 hours 7 he never closed his office amen go see that doctor your case will be solved against all the ODS amen amen amen amen amen the prophet says in the message sir we will see Jesus now there's something in the Bible that God want us to challenge God is all powerful God and he gives his servant a commission to do great things and we mustn't be afraid to ask God to do great things because he's ask us to do impossible without him did you get that God is asking us to do impossible without we always say everything is possible but brother vham say everything is is possible not just God to you God is asking us to do impossible things without him amen am amen if ask us to do impossible amen am we want us to have the omnipotent God those impossible that's what I said don't be afraid when the odds against you no chance of survival listen you can have you can never have a testimony until you face the art you cannot have a testimony until you face the Earth many people like to be in a comfort zone comfort zone they like to be comfortable in a comfort zone God allow trials to come God allow trouble to come Tri to come to take you out of the comfort zone you can face the Arts allows sickness to strike come into your life so we can face the oh that's why we can call the name of the Lord that's I the Bible says that's what I said on Wednesday is a very present help in a time of trouble God loves actually when you're in trouble that is am appointment that is meeting place if you want to meet God just get in trouble because very present in a time of trouble amen amen oh let's go to our story let's our story and then we're going to close and as we read the Bible talked about Shamar the Bible says in the days of Shamar the son of an in the days of jail judges 5: 6 the highways were abandoned Travelers took the winding path villages in Israel would not fight they held back that was a terrible time for Israel the first thing with the Enemy when he come in in the country he destroy the the highways he destroy the ways because he's making sure after destroying you after the land cannot follow him you cannot be after him so he's destroying the land the ways he's destroying all the ways all the roads just to make sure you're not coming after him and then Israel they were taking the winding path yeah the winding path is a long way and on the way you can meet TGs you can meet criminals because they couldn't take the highways the highs destroy because of their sin because the Bible says in judges because there was no King no Prophet everybody was doing what pleases him what it was good in their eyes they had to take a winding path we know in the message we know as a Christian we know ways to do it we know how to get married like I said under no circumstance we know how to behave we know the prophet told us how to behave is we don't drink in Israel we don't drink we don't drink in Israel we don't smoke we don't Sho that's the way but what Israel was doing they were taking the winning path they couldn't take the way God provided in Israel we have a prophet we all obey the prophets the of God taking the the winding the the Bible says The Villages could not fight taking the winding path what have we done with the message today as as as young people or we uh we don't have any boundaries we remove our boundaries we don't have any boundaries everything is questionable now we respecting the adults respect even respect the adults not even talk about men of God today just see as young people talking about his Pastor can be ashamed of your his father mother or you should be ashamed of yourself respect at all what have we done with the message I remember back in the days when we were still kid they used to say I used to hear people saying the message they love the pastor the way they love the pastor am done today today loving the past if you talk about loving the past in the church everybody everybody's looking it's like to say they love the pastor what have we done with the message we lost our boundaries coming to church it's a big deal now no remorse at all stay at home for any kind of reason we stay at home for any kind of reason I'm not I'm tired brother church is that really the reason being tired not coming to church no remor at all no condemnation you do something wrong we don't repent anymore I'm not talking please I don't have a Ministry of talking I'm just showing you the wining path theth they were Tak let the preacher talk about something it's a personal attack oh no why you attacking the prophet says to the point where the ministers have the hands tied they can't talk about anything anymore because if you touch this you're touching my person attacking me when you were home you pray God to talk to you you came to church God spoke to you God is speaking to you getting mad what have we done personal attack amen one day I was listening to pastor pastor preached after his sermon he went to his office brother follow him the pastor follow him the brother follow him in his office Pastor today all your sermon all the service You Preach against me wrong with you says brother if it happens that the Holy Spirit spoke to you God loves you the the brother got mad stood up he rais his fist he was about to punch the pastor the Deacon had to intervene Christian we still Christian and we still call ourselves Christians done the message phes they were not fighting amen they were not fighting anymore they gave up they surrendered is that what you feeling you feeling like the enemy is greater you feel like the enemy is bigger you can't fight anymore you can't fight feel like this battle already lost the battle that's what the villages were doing they were not fighting anymore the philistin were coming and killing destroying taking the goods taking the kids anymore they just surrendered take whatever you want but I want to tell you this morning but I want to tell you this morning that is you is greater is in the worlder than in you you don't have to fight this battle you don't have to fight this battle God is fighting for you amen God is still have young people that will stand in this evil age they will not surrender they will not surrender they will not surrender to the fashion God will have young people in fact those young people they here in the church if you are here you are one of them you will stand because the prophet says the fact that you came the fact that you came you could have been somewhere you could have have fun somewhere but you accepted to come to hear the word you you're a daughter of God Son of God a young man of God Young of God you will stand you will stand in this evil age as they were taking the the winding path long path amen the Bible says everybody was do what it pleases them they were getting too comfortable amen they were getting too comfortable in the scene today we even see G in the message think it's normal it's not normal let's stop being comfortable with that it doesn't mean we hate them it doesn't mean we hate them but we the spirit that is in there we don't have ha the person we ha that Spirit God is capable to deliver you God is able to change your life God is able to transform your life surrender to him and in the midst of that there was that one man called Shema oh I love this man the prophet says he was not a preacher you don't have to be a preacher to do something you don't have to be a minister to do something you don't have to be a king to do something was a farmer he was unknown person actually in the Bible you only have one or two verses about him many people don't even know about him that's what the prophet says the little old sh there was no king who was he he was just a lay member he was just a lay member he was just a member of a church am not a preacher a firmer Israel will work hard Israel work hard they would go and go in the field and to the ground and so and then the Philistine will just wait when they about to harvest when it was time to harvest that's when they were coming to take the good the devil will not come when you're working hard when you're working hard that's not when he comes when he comes when you're about to harest what you've been your your work of your labor that's when it's coming when you're about to whap what you saw that's when coming that's what the prophet says in the message preparation that's the way the devil does just about the time you get the church fixed to a place you say well now I'm just getting I'm getting a long fine having real old Revival oh May that's why we thinking and I believe we're having something Revival in the church spirit of God is moving the Bible say the prophet says the devil will sleep in all crazy ideas you know them people they're just crazy there's no such a thing to it cuz doctor so and so said when you pray for the Revival you you fasted then you just think the church is in a good standing a good position brother this days the atmosphere is really good in the church can you see all the way we worship can you see the love in the church just about that time careful careful St Focus that's when the devil attacked the devil won't strike you when praying he just attack you when you're getting comfortable when get comfortable stop praying feel I'm enjoying the moment Slumber don't Slumber the devil is coming the devil is coming when you just building your spiritual life bu in your spiritual life you working hard but the moment you just get comfortable that's when the devil stri I speak to many young people they feel brother I was I was praying I feel like my life was getting in a good shape all of a sudden I relaxed because you got too comfortable you got too comfortable you didn't stay alerted stay focused amen the devil is coming but sham stood there after the crop after the crop realized that he had a lot of crops this year and he told his wife his wife looked old because last year they didn't have any crop the enemy took everything that year turn to his wife she told she he told he told her oh baby this year hone this year I'll buy a new dress this year you look at the kid

everything that he had but he was prophesying he said this year year I will get my dream job this year I will get my dream house this year things will be different this year will see my husband this year see my wife while he was speaking you know the devil likes to come in a moment like that while you speaking you testify he look at the window heard the noise he opened the window 600 men six trained men well dressed trained that's what the devil likes to do when you are testifying opening your mind don't you see your symptoms don't to see what's going on around you how you going to be able to do it how you going to be able to do it he's opening the curtain for you while you speaking he wants to challenge your faith he wants to challenge your Fai to see you really believe but since he was he prophesied already sh didn't turn back that's why when speak some of the thing out loud Bound by those promises promised my wife I already promised my wife I already promised my kids this year will be different should I come back and explain to my kids my the Phil took away not this year not this year the prophet says he started getting upset he started getting upset the prophet is Holy in the nation not being angry at your brother not being angry at your brother not being angry at your pastor not being angry at the church but angry against yourself be angry by yourself when until when how long keep on coming taking my crops go away still when the enemy will keep robbing me will keep robbing me I'm not going to take this year year not this year when how long we going to have peace in the church but why can we have peace in the church why can I have a baby those are the question he was asking that's when you're getting really upset the prophet says he was getting angry holy ination don't be satisfied with your condition satisfy with your condition don't settle for less sett L don't be happy with your condition if you think good you are not good your condition is not good just going to give you one example we struggling to pay this building you can't say we good we struggling to pay this building P they are billions they pay for the church cash but we still

sickness he promised you healing he promised you healing that's the promise sickness is not the promise is not the promise healing is the promise the problem is you superce with the devil destroying your family still smiling with him destroying sickness sin in the camp you still fine you still comfortable but be jealous for God be jealous for God there was one man in the Bible one day he saw one Israelite man going in a hotel with a woman unbeliever got mad the Bible says he pull out p and he the both of them and the Bible says that day that stopped the wrath of God be jealous for God you are responsible when you see sin do something about it it's not just for the pastor it's not just for the ministers it's not just for the ashers it's your responsibility you the prophet don't you know your behavior someone Behavior can cause someone not to be healed in the church you are responsible for your unconfessed sin you have a sin that you you didn't you don't want to confess a blessing for someone so you are responsible you are resp responsible you see something like they say you see something say something I would say you see something do something you don't have to say it out loud you see something do something about it go see your brother talk to him you see a young man you see a young girl go talk to him go try to help him oh amen sh got mad he couldn't get comfortable with his situation he went to his chamber he went to his room he took his clothes off he took his clothes off he examined himself that's why the prophet says he turned every stone he looked he said I have a family Mark I have a family Mark I have a family Mark I'm Different I am different I got a covenant I got a covenant I got a covenant I know who I am I know who I am I'm circumcised I'm a Jew I got a covenant I got a covenant I got a covenant I'm circumcised he recognized who he was the problem is you don't know who you are the the problem is you don't know who you are when you see that problem go back to yourself check your life make sure you got a covenant the prophet says the greatest problem with the Pentecostals because they don't know who they are you are Sons and Daughters of God a lot of time you are looking for something to come that's why Prophet say you are looking for something great to come you already got it the Propet you already got that the greatest that can be given to you the greatest thing that can be given to you the prophet says now we are sons of God not that we will be we are now that's the greatest things that's the greatest things that you have don't wait for something great to come the greatest thing that God has given you you are a son of God know who you are amen that's the greatest T of Christians they don't know who they are you believe in the prophet or you believe in God that's good you believe inam that's good you believe in a pastor you believe in the ministers that's good but that's not enough that's not enough God wants you to believe in yourself God want you to believe in yourself believe that you are a son of God not that you will be but you are now a son of God amen Samson the prophet says he had Seven Locks he have his hair he have his hair that was the Covenant that was the Covenant as long he had that Covenant he was invincible he was invincible no matter how many Philistine would even when Samson was sleeping as long he had the Covenant where he could fill the Covenant he was invisible no matter the prophet say no matter the Gat of Gaza the prophet said they meant nothing to him me nothing to him persever as long as he could feel those Seven Locks that was the Covenant listen to this like this one paragraph 90 the perseverance said as long as the Christian can feel that Covenant what is that Covenant all things are possible to him that believe [Music] God as long you can feel that Covenant when you can feel that faith in you that you are God's job when you can have that faith in you that you are a child of God and of everyone of his promised blessings don't care what comes up you are more than a much for it you are more than a match for it I think I read it somewh it means you are more than it you are greater than it your problem is not a match for you your problem is not at your level you are more than a much for it as long as you can feel that in everything is possible to them that believes that's the Covenant of Faith as long as you can feel that I can can do all things I can do all things through Christ through Christ who streng Invincible like I said after believing in God beli God good believing in brother Bram that's good believing in a pastor that's the right thing to do believing in the ministers that's good but God wants you believe in yourself if you don't believe in yourself there's no Rapture because the prophet says the day the bride will recognize who she is the rapture will take place so as long as you don't know who you are no Rapture amen once you believe that regardless of the numbers of philistine don't care what comes up you know today there might be people that can look at you and think that you are not a child of God they think you're not a child of God that's your own judgment that's not God judgment that's not God judgment who can believe who can believe a serious Jew serious Israelite look at the thief at the cross and call him a saint imagine that man will be in a paradise hallelu he never went to church he never went to church all his life he was robbing people not just robbing he was killing people he probably killed one of his family member who could believe a serious who could believe a serious person could believe that of God it doesn't matter what people think that's their own judgment I don't care what they think let me give you another example who could believe RAB The Prostitute prostit The Prostitute prostit the prostitute prostit daughter of God who could believe that nobody could believe that a person with a white mind could never believe that a prostitute on the street making her money out of prostitution could never believed that but he was a Son of God that's why I said believe in yourself it doesn't matter what people think who could believe Hallelujah it doesn't matter what people thinkself what God what God said about you you said how do I know I'm a Son of God how do I know I'm a Son of God the Bible says the Bible says the light came to his own the light came to his own own rece but to them that have received the light he has given them the power to become sons of God once you receive this life the message of the hour you are Son of God it doesn't matter what somebody thinks it doesn't matter what mean to think it doesn't matter what the person think that's why many people will be surprised because we have always our own judgment no you got to walk this way you got to walk this way you got to this way you got talk this way many will be surprised many will be surprised as they were surprised when they saw the thief at the cross you he you he you just killed somebody yesterday that was even the reason you were hang at the cross at the last minute of his life the last minute of his life you are Son of God I don't you don't deserve you don't deserve to be here I deserve to be here he confess his sin the last minute of his life touch Jesus Jesus was dying but that was the last Soul before he died you probably the last one before the Rapture you probably the last one before the Rapture amen many will be surprised amen believe in yourself amen that's why sh you turn
