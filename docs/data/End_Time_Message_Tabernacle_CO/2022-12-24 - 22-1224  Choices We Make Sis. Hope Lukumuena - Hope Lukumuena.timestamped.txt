[0:30] you'll never leave you you won't forsake
[0:35] you
[0:37] if you'll be there for you
[0:42] and though you never prayed for God to
[0:46] show you the way

[2:08] by the Lord
[2:11] my own choices put me there
[2:15] most of my words have been
[2:19] self-inflicted and after time
[2:27] pray for God's will
[2:30] every step we take enough the choices
[2:39] [Music]
[2:45] you can live with this voice
[2:49] [Music]
[3:13] the choices
[3:19] we made
[3:21] [Music]
[3:25] we take
[3:28] you can live
[3:32] [Music]

[3:53] that we take
[3:55] choices
[3:57] [Music]
