[Music] simply worship if you are crying worship in your trials worship if you are hurting worship nothing matters were cuz he will hear y'all God is before you say [Music] [Music] why [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hello hello kids we're back again with another Sunday School lesson I hope you guys had a great week we all know that today is a special day today is Mother's Day and I hope you all showed in some way or form how much you appreciate your mother brother Brennan says that Mother's Day should be every day so it's not just on Mother's Day that you wake up and give your mom a big hug or you tell her I love you or you bring her flowers or gifts no it should be every day that you should appreciate your mom's and even your dice too but since today's Mother's Day were going to have a special lesson on the mothers how about this you guys if you haven't done it already even like right now wherever your mom is just go out to her give her a big hug you can even possibly but anyways just go over to her give her a big hug tell her how much you love her and appreciate her because mothers are like the best thing in the world brother Branham says that she is the fifth gospel and we know in the Bible we have Matthew Mark Luke dawn right and those are only four but brother Branham says that she's a fifth because she's the one that's gonna be teaching you she's the one that's gonna be raising you ever since you were a little baby she was the first one that was with you and until now whatever age you guys are your mother is always gonna be there for you so once you learn to love and respect our mothers I should appreciate them help them out whenever they tell you to do something you know you want to listen and you want to obey to what they're telling you as mothers do a lot of work a lot of sacrifices that you may at this moment may not really understand but get older you will start to understand so wherever she is right now if you want to just give her a big hug a big kiss tell her you how much you love her and appreciate her and then we will just start into our sentence blessing all right so I will just open up with a word of Prayer and then we'll just jump into our list all right dear Heavenly Father God we thank you again for this lovely morning that you gave it to us O God for keeping us safe O God we think before the mothers that you've given to us so by we just pray that you give them a long life of God and strength to continue raising their children that you've given to them Oh father but and as we're doing this Sunday School lesson or father that I pray that you'll just speak to each of each of the kids over that are there that are listening in their rooms and made being near to them putting everything into your hands in Jesus name we pray amen amen all right so today I just wanted to bring out a little story that brother Branham talked about gays but mother dear and you know that brother Branham as a prophet as he was when he wasn't preaching or out doing his he'll uh the the miracle services he was hunting that's what brother Branham loved to do he loved the hunt he loved to go out in the woods in the mountains or wherever he could where he could just relax his mind because when he was at home or wherever he was in the healing services people were always asked to come up to brother Brennaman as for the man please pray for me or brother Bennett I have a question about this right because he was the prophet of buck and everybody knew that brother Bentham had a special gift in his life so everybody wanted a chance to be with brother Bennett so in order for brother Branham to relax and just kind of get away and get rested he would go out and do the filling hunt for the venom love nature he always said that he saw God in nature that's where he always wanted to be always loved hunting you know being with his friends up in the mountains well one day brother Branham went out hunting with one of the friends who was also a hunter but the different thing about this hunter was this hunter was a very mean man it was a very mean hunter he was a good man for the benefit he was a very nice man to be with but the thing that he did is when he went hunting he would just hunt or fine you know not not in a way up to get game or food to take home and eat but he would just kill the animals just to kill them for fun and leave the their walk away right and we know that's wrong because you're not supposed to do that well brother branham didn't like that about that hunter and that country's name was Bert or the Benham say she was a real rule hearted man when he came to hunting he was a good hunter oh he could hunt really good but he was very cool and he liked the hunt deer that we all know the big deers that we might see where maybe when were driving we see the deer they got their big horn so they have a mother dear mother deer is called a doe and a baby deer is all the fun and that hunter his name was Bert he loved to hunt those little fawns and just killed them and just go away you know just be like well I'd shot one and I did a good job and I would just go away for the Benham didn't like that brother Bennett says he's so pro his eyes even look like lizard I'm not sure if you guys seen a lizard but lizard they're very these really slimy animals and they have the weird-looking eyes right so the Bennett says his eyes was almost like a lizard right so one day they weren't hunting and this this man Bert's he used to call brother branham a chicken hearted preacher why because he thought brother branham such a chicken hearted preacher he doesn't like shooting he doesn't like hunting just for fun you know he only should so he can get food bring back to his family he's too calm a chicken hearted feels like all you preachers you guys you guys you guys are just so soft-hearted that's what he's gonna Brennan brother Brennan would tell Bert you don't have to do that that's wrong that's really rough it so remember we're talking about Mother's Day okay and this is a story about mother okay so they're out hunting and when they were hunting he told her the better guess what guess what I brought today and he brought out a little whistle and this little whistle what he would do with these he would blow into that whistle and that whistle would blow a sound that sounded like a baby deer crying so that's why he bought me sure it's a brother Brennaman brother Brenham said oh man bert why would you do this right so they start hunting and they couldn't find any animals they couldn't find any meat so what they decided to do they said well we're gonna just stop by little blog somewhere by a tree we're just gonna sit down maybe have lunch and we'll wait so but the venom and the man bird they just sat down and they started to maybe take out their lunches or whatever and brother branham you notice out of the corner his eyes that worked was taking something out of his oh maybe he's just taking out a little thermos maybe sick now his sandwich before he knows it if Burt takes out that little whistle and starts blowing into my defenses oh no Burt why are good you gonna do that that's so cool of you and he said oh whatever you chicken hearted preacher mr. Benham started to rebuke you Missy you know you're gonna put you're gonna kill some poor little fun out there that is innocent for no reason he said oh it's nothing so what he did is he blew into that whistle and that whistle blew out a really pitiful cry of a little fun I was crying brother branham is so heartbroken and he doesn't know what to do and all of a sudden right in the into the clear remember how I said before they were trying to hunt they couldn't find any animals and all of a sudden there came up big mother dear she just stood right there right in the front of them both of them are sitting and she comes up right in front of them maybe she was just laying there hiding from the hunters but when she heard that little part of the whistle she thought oh that must be a little fun out there that's Craig that doesn't have a mother well she stood up she started to look around mother Brennan said she started to look around and she saw brother Brennan and she's called Burt he thought of them sitting there and Burt was ready to fire cuz he already brought out his Benny who's gonna kill the deer or the Ben and said Oh Burt don't do that you're not gonna kill this poor mother this poor mother is such a strong mother does she heard a cry of a faun maybe it was not her pond she didn't know but she was a mother so she wanted to find out where that omelet or where that on was that was in trouble and the deer looked and saw Burt and he saw for the Benham but the deer didn't run away they dared just kept looking and then Burt would probably like whistle though the whistle again and she would just look around wondering where and where did the sound come from and Burt raised his gun he was getting ready to shoot other Brennan said I can't look at this and he turned his head away and he started inside inside up in Christ I don't know did you do this why would you kill this or a loyal mother that wants to take care and skew her fun Burt is getting ready to shoot brother branham just waited and he waited and he waited and or didn't shoot look like the the the the gunshot and he looked over at Burt and what was bird doing he was crying he was cribbing he couldn't even shoot the gun anymore or who the gun down on the floor and he said brother branham lead me to this Jesus that you serve because before Burt was very skeptical about you know with this religion and what brother Bret Baier with Brenda being as a preacher he did understand it but when he saw the Loyalists of the mother in fact of the loyalists that characteristic of a mother it's a good deer that was not even a human being but a deer she saw something special and brother Bennett said that day right there in the middle of the wood Burton gave his heart to the Lord so now what did the deer do the deer didn't do anything the deer did not say anything all she did was just did that she didn't run she didn't back off and hide no she just stood there and what Burt saw he saw something that was different this was not a hood on that the deer said oh you know I'm a mother and I'm gonna go up and search but no it was something that was real inside of her it was not something that she faked it was not something that she pretended so this is the same thing as us as Christian right we don't want to pretend like we're Christians we don't want to fake as a christian right be hypocrite one place we are one thing and another place learn anything right because it doesn't come from debris from the inside of our hearts and people can tell sometimes when you're faking it or when you're not being real or being the real person that God made you so my little lesson that you can take out of this is be who God made you to be right you don't want to try to be someone else or something else that you're not right because when you try to express it to other people it won't come out as real and as Christians we're here we are the light of the world we are a little alike a little candle and they hear that song that we always think I'm gonna let my little light shine right we don't want to hide it but we want to be a true example of what a real Christian is and even there are some good there are bake Christians out there that pretend but on the inside they don't have a part on the inside but when you have God on the inside and you have a true real experience with that and you live a right life with God then it will express it will come out real and true and people will be able to see that and they will be impacted by it then if you were just to be a fake person maybe one day they see you act a certain way the next day they see what church and they say I thought I thought I didn't know you were Christian or maybe they see you at church and then they see you another place and they said oh I thought you were arrested right we want to be genuine want to be real Christian we want to have that real bad experience in our hearts for then it will be able to express itself to others when other people will see you they'll say oh that's a real Christian I like that girl I like that boy I want to be like that boy I want to be like that girl and you never know maybe just by your life he may not even maybe witnessed them maybe just by your life you might be able to touch somebody or maybe bring someone else to the Lord so that's my little lesson I would see me I wanted to bring out to you guys and Sharon if she has something else as they will this right now okay hi kids thing questions be back in front of you today and thank you Shalom for that lesson I'm I hope that was a blessing for you the lesson on Mother's Day as Billy venom said Mother's Day should be every day you should celebrate our mother every day because a mother is the best gift that God had given to us just as Shalom said and I'm just gonna read a short quote from brother Brennan it says in the message called Mother's Day it said but I believe such as such as Mother's Day like this is Iraqi it make a lot of money out of flowers and things but Mother's Day should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on Mother's Day but to love her and care for her 365 days and nights all throughout the year so this is assuring that you know maybe the world might look at Mother's Day like oh let's just buy flowers or that's just by candy and cards and give it but mothers they should be a thing that every single day to really show your mother that you love her you have to tell her that you love her you have to be there for her hey mom I see you're kind of tired today what can I do to help you can I clean up for you or depending how old you are mom you might cook for you can I can I do this man take care of the of my other siblings for you that shows your mom that you that you care and you really do love her because mothers do a lot for us since we were born as babies they carried us they fed us they taught us all that we know and mothers deserve also a me grow up and when we're able to help them out to do that as much as possible a mother is someone who can do so many sacrifices for you just like we heard in the story of the deer the mother knew that maybe know there could be a hunter out there to kill her but Iceland is she really cried she was ready to risk her own life just to come out and they save a baby that's what mothers do and butter brown talks about another story of a woman who she had her baby under house caught on fire the mother knew that her baby was in the house and she knew that the house is on fire I go in there I'll probably burn and but she was like she don't think here all that mattered to her at that noise for the baby so she went into the house full of fire and she got burnt even if she got to protect your baby the baby didn't get burnt the baby was covered up in blankets but she got burned and all her face was scarred and she got hurt and she looked ugly so that's what mothers do for they're ready to with their own eyes and be knowing that they can die something bad can happen to them that they can do that for us so in return this Mother's Day I'm gonna talk to all of you guys it's good to tell your mother to hug her to give her flowers and that's what you should be doing every day and also to do that extra step of showing your mom that you up there by doing something extra and maybe you never clean up you saying no mom you know what I'm old enough today I'm gonna start I play I'm gonna start putting my own clothes away or instead of think I'm gonna just use his pen to clean up my own you're not here for always a high time to talk you know because the older we get the more responsible we have to become so make sure you're telling your mom that you love her and enjoying this Mother's Day as well as praying for her always and giving her as much help as you can because she has done she's done also a lot for you during the whole life and so I hope that you guys are also doing well and you are able to follow this lesson but gonna say a word of prayer and let's show them had something bad just wrap it up you know okay alrighty so everyone let's close our eyes and bow our heads we're gonna sing with a prayer to close Joe Heavenly Father we just think you once again for this time this opportunity that you allowed us to be alive and to to speak up to speak a lot your
