[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:40] this is the truth this is not the man
[1:03:42] saying jesus
[1:04:08] a general idea
[1:04:10] jessica's
[1:04:53] i like the pastor to be asking questions
[1:04:56] call me leffe as he always does it
[1:05:01] he goes very deep with it
[1:05:11] last sunday i was discouraged when he
[1:05:13] asked the question people didn't want
[1:05:14] the person to be asking questions
[1:05:22] today we're going to talk about the
[1:05:23] reward of ruth amen amen
[1:05:28] just to rewind a little bit
[1:05:32] this is young the decision
[1:05:37] the service of work
[1:05:46] repo the rests
[1:05:52] recompense and the reward
[1:05:59] recompense and the reward
[1:06:05] justification
[1:06:07] decision is the justification
[1:06:11] sanctification service
[1:06:14] sanctification
[1:06:19] the rest is the baptism of the holy
[1:06:21] ghost
[1:06:32] adoption and the reward is the adoption
[1:06:37] doc
[1:06:40] we have seen all within many phases
[1:06:44] come
[1:06:54] as the steps of root is the step that
[1:06:56] god is doing with the gentile church to
[1:06:58] lead them in the full steps of
[1:06:59] redemption rita comacilla said this day
[1:07:02] ruth started by deciding
[1:07:09] after her decision that took her to work
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:41] that typified the church being at the
[1:07:44] feet of jesus
[1:07:47] after doing a great work in humility
[1:07:51] and at the end
[1:07:53] of
[1:08:08] the
[1:08:13] the same thing that god does with the
[1:08:15] gentile church
[1:08:19] after we had the whole testament and we
[1:08:21] all know uh
[1:08:26] god sent down the baptism of the holy
[1:08:27] ghost in jerusalem
[1:08:29] elizabeth that was the jews amen amen
[1:08:35] god had to lose
[1:08:47] and when we're talking about the church
[1:08:49] edges this is the bright gentle bride
[1:08:52] amen amen
[1:08:58] oh he said martin you're saying all
[1:09:00] these people
[1:09:02] said
[1:09:07] god sent the reformers like martin to
[1:09:09] preach about justification why basket
[1:09:13] le diablo because the devil counts
[1:09:16] when he saw the church at the peninsula
[1:09:22] that church was acting like jesus
[1:09:23] himself
[1:09:27] the the devil was
[1:09:28] down
[1:09:30] what did the devil do
[1:09:34] he wanted to kill all the apostles
[1:09:37] apart thinking by killing all the
[1:09:39] opposition
[1:09:41] he will kill the power of god
[1:09:43] but he did not succeed memphis
[1:09:46] apart
[1:09:58] that is why if somebody has the holy
[1:10:00] ghost certainly combat it's useless to
[1:10:02] fight the first converter if you're
[1:10:04] fighting that person
[1:10:06] it's like fighting the wind son of a
[1:10:07] permanent it won't work el diablo fully
[1:10:10] combat or traffic legally

[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:11:30] so that the capstone will capture the

[1:13:15] great series about adoption
[1:13:18] insulted maturity the adoption is some
[1:13:21] sort of maturity
[1:13:24] somebody who's mature
[1:13:27] foreign it's like a home and pair a
[1:13:30] father calila des alfa when he has
[1:13:33] children
[1:13:35] the father wants to see what he's doing
[1:13:38] the children should do the same thing
[1:13:40] objective his objectives
[1:13:43] if he has to have it here
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:14:40] this is the way you listen to the world
[1:14:43] and the holy ghost
[1:14:46] maybe i'm showing you something
[1:14:47] straight maybe he has a little boob
[1:14:50] he's taking notes
[1:14:53] giving point great
[1:15:23] until now she doesn't dress well forever
[1:15:24] and i'm a dude but the branham says dude
[1:15:26] sessions all these things
[1:15:30] the holy ghost will not adopt you amen
[1:15:33] amen man
[1:15:35] he says
[1:16:04] the holy ghost is
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:32] he
[1:16:45] are you with me
[1:17:23] is the fact that you are convinced that
[1:17:25] this message is definitely about jesus
[1:17:26] you were baptized
[1:17:28] now
[1:18:10] it's the prophet kevin martin secular
[1:18:12] biblical that shows you what the bible
[1:18:14] is seminar it's not seminary yeah that
[1:18:17] examination god will examine god
[1:18:21] are you moving forward
[1:18:23] with your prayer life
[1:18:37] maybe god has giving him a grace
[1:18:41] he doesn't smoke no more man he left
[1:18:43] only critique but when it comes to
[1:18:45] criticism very strongly
[1:18:47] but when the holy ghost
[1:18:50] check that he went he goes to the father
[1:18:52] and then
[1:19:01] when it comes to criticisms
[1:19:04] he keeps doing it he never went i am
[1:19:34] god wants him to preach a silly prayer
[1:19:37] if he preaches
[1:19:39] he's there for your salvation
[1:19:42] god can anoint him
[1:19:44] to preach about something
[1:19:48] maybe
[1:19:49] that's the thing that you like
[1:19:51] because the holy ghost
[1:19:53] he knows the thing that you like
[1:19:56] for you to be adopted basket dance at us
[1:19:59] because in this age
[1:20:02] we have

[1:21:04] continue and the work continues
[1:21:07] that is why you know
[1:21:08] somebody can have the holy ghost
[1:21:10] but it doesn't have patience get capable
[1:21:42] second peter chapter one
[1:22:06] according as as his divine power has
[1:22:08] given us unto all things that pertains
[1:22:15] through the knowledge of him that has
[1:22:17] called us to glory and virtue

[1:22:29] precious promises
[1:22:33] participants
[1:22:35] that by this you may be partakers of
[1:22:38] this divine nature
[1:22:42] existed
[1:22:44] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:22:46] the world through lust
[1:22:48] across the cellar man and beside
[1:22:57] giving all diligence at your fifth
[1:23:00] virtue
[1:24:15] virtue if you don't meditate
[1:24:17] correct if you don't have the right
[1:24:19] faith hey i don't drive it let's go
[1:24:21] first la connect knowledge

[1:26:22] man it's amazing god himself

[1:26:29] this
[1:26:31] one if we say
[1:26:33] brothers why is
[1:26:36] i believe many people are not adopted
[1:26:44] because if somebody is adopted
[1:26:47] the first thing the adoption for the
[1:26:49] peripheral defect the the adoption goes
[1:26:53] along with the capstone
[1:26:59] you cannot say somebody's adopted an
[1:27:02] unavoidable scene
[1:27:04] but we don't see the sign of this
[1:27:06] capstone the lord the effect is
[1:27:08] the capstone here

[1:27:17] divine divine love
[1:27:23] divine love a ceremony this divine love
[1:27:27] secrets

[1:28:01] christ's behaving
[1:28:04] when he was invited in the party letter
[1:28:06] negligence but he was neglected
[1:28:09] necessary
[1:28:10] christ never complained he messaged
[1:28:39] but he knew that he was the one who can
[1:28:41] make them listen
[1:28:44] he never complained about it man but a
[1:28:47] vaccine objective with his objective
[1:28:50] pressure
[1:28:52] a sinner
[1:28:54] who
[1:29:09] god
[1:29:10] baptize us
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:15] we are hiding
[1:29:17] faith
[1:29:19] that is why in many messages
[1:29:21] god is insisting on what i have to face
[1:29:25] virtue
[1:29:28] today i have a lot of things
[1:29:32] positioned
[1:29:33] good words to position the process
[1:30:19] it's very complicated
[1:30:22] this knowledge helps a lot
[1:30:25] it's true that the knowledge
[1:30:30] when they are not born
[1:30:46] this
[1:31:01] to place every word at his place
[1:31:06] this is the knowledge that helped martin
[1:31:08] luther to write the bible amen don't say
[1:31:11] through these fruits
[1:31:14] so let fruity

[1:31:58] color if you have patience temperance or

[1:42:26] when i'm saved
[1:42:40] if there's no church there's no love
[1:42:42] please
[1:42:43] it's the church that is messed up
[1:42:45] the sacrifice
[1:42:47] that's what brother burnham says
[1:42:50] give me a church
[1:42:53] people love really from the heart
[1:42:56] without paying attention to no injustice
[1:43:01] you see the ever benefited god we bless
[1:43:03] the children
[1:43:05] they will lack nothing
[1:43:22] why
[1:43:45] this is what we have when we are born in
[1:43:47] the family the second grandfather i know
[1:43:48] it's my
[1:43:49] second petition
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:31] after receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:44:33] spirit
[1:44:34] we're having faith
[1:44:36] we're hiding virtues
[1:44:39] and this virtue says
[1:44:42] this is the power that god is giving
[1:44:45] him of his to cast our evil
[1:44:48] many don't have this virtue
[1:44:53] they can pray for mourinho
[1:44:55] they can fast
[1:44:57] but there's no virtue yeah
[1:44:59] there are people that fast in vain
[1:45:01] illusion illegitimate they can fast fast
[1:45:04] fast man
[1:45:07] but just to destroy his death
[1:45:09] do you know why
[1:45:11] men because himself
[1:45:13] he doesn't leave the world
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:11] because
[1:46:13] just few of them received
[1:46:16] many of them
[1:46:17] you know why
[1:46:19] because they like before the perfect
[1:46:21] laptop doesn't match with the word

[1:47:41] when she looks at you as a destiny and
[1:47:44] he sees how he is

[1:58:52] that is why god took him
[1:58:54] transformed it was transformed
