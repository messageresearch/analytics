[6:14] quotes of uber banham about
[6:19] the inauguration of the new president
[6:32] but let me tell you it's not about
[6:35] the court yeah
[6:40] it's how do we view that

[6:48] and how we get prepared
[6:52] in connection with what we are seeing
[6:59] brother sister time is seriously
[7:02] advanced afraid is serious
[7:07] we don't know what is going to take
[7:11] place

[7:18] one of these day i read to you the
[7:21] quote on the leodison church age
[7:25] george situation
[7:28] it's not a matter of just uh
[7:31] to know what is taking place in a
[7:34] personal
[7:34] problem this was a world secret past but
[7:37] it's a matter of
[7:39] to be to be prepared about what is
[7:42] taking place
[7:43] man this is a pass
[7:46] god doesn't do anything in the vein
[7:49] journey in town when he can show those
[7:53] things
[7:54] 16 uh maybe
[7:57] 70 or even almost 100
[8:01] years
[8:06] from the vision he gave to his servant
[8:09] in 1933
[8:19] it's god's grace philanthropy here
[8:22] brother bonham said in the message leo
[8:24] the syrian church age

[9:04] [Music]
[9:06] at the end of that paragraph melathon is
[9:08] a paragraph he's talking about
[9:10] the catholic church in parliament
[9:12] catholic he said the catholic church
[9:15] is on the rise
[9:18] we have had one catholic president
[9:22] president catholic and will not

[9:59] president et cetera et cetera
[10:02] has been the fulfilled it's something
[10:04] complete
[10:06] now and now to the more detail
[10:10] down the plea this the daytime uh
[10:13] i receive i don't know how many caught
[10:16] generation
[10:16] the same
[10:29] it's not just kamala in purpose in a
[10:31] person ma
[10:32] kamala um the important if you lay
[10:38] but i want to read you something here
[10:41] major revolution
[10:45] let me take the what the court that
[10:48] people have been sending all over the
[10:50] seventy the seventieth week of daniel
[10:53] that's what's on this jim samantha
[10:54] danian probably some people did not
[10:57] receive it a certain person
[11:00] but this is what brother bonham said was
[11:02] the secret foreign
[11:03] no no i predicted and he said
[11:08] i saw a great woman stand up
[11:12] you know
[11:17] dressed in a real highly
[11:21] royals
[11:26] like a purple coma of your lane
[11:30] and i got like uh i i got little
[11:32] parenthesis down here
[11:37] she was a great ruler in the united
[11:40] states
[11:47] a woman in a farm some woman infamous i
[11:50] don't know her to be the catholic church
[11:53] is a reality i don't know i can't say
[11:57] the only thing i've seen i seen the
[12:01] woman
[12:01] je villa farmer that was all rosetta too
[12:06] and then he went on the pre-lady sunday
[12:08] but this is a woman nation mercedes
[12:11] nation feminine in a revelation chapter
[12:14] 13
[12:15] apocalypse chapter 3 13 stars to teen
[12:18] colony et cetera et cetera there's a
[12:19] dualist
[12:20] colonial suite but we are more familiar
[12:23] with the scripture
[12:24] on revelation 17.
[12:28] the son plus families apocalypse descent
[12:31] are the great prostitutes la grande
[12:34] prostitutes the big harlot
[12:36] the lagrande and if we take that message
[12:39] yes you know pronounce a message oh let
[12:40] us
[12:41] read the bible first revelation chapter
[12:45] 17 you may be still
[12:46] seated that's not what i want to talk
[12:49] about tonight
[13:02] revelation 17 apocalypse
[13:06] you see it's talking about the big
[13:08] outlook
[13:09] on prostitutes but i want to read verses
[13:12] 4 3 and 4.
[13:17] so he carried me away in the spirit
[13:21] into the wilderness
[13:24] and they say and i saw a woman sit upon
[13:28] a scarlet colored beast in a farm i see
[13:32] this
[13:34] so colors have something to do with
[13:38] something
[13:42] uh scarlet colored beast
[13:45] green better full of names
[13:49] of blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[13:52] horns
[13:53] plunder blasphemy
[13:57] and the woman was a red in the purple
[14:00] yellow
[14:03] [Music]
[14:07] so it's talking about uh
[14:12] the woman sitting on the scarlet color
[14:14] beast
[14:36] [Music]
[14:42] indeed exactly the scripture we had
[14:45] exactly
[14:47] so he carried me away in the spirit into
[14:50] the wilderness the lord made transport
[14:52] on his feet only they say
[14:53] and i saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet
[14:56] colored beast
[15:06] what does the word scarlett detect
[15:09] because
[15:11] [Music]
[15:25] it has to do with royalty yes
[15:30] so this woman we see here aloha said
[15:33] from kenobo
[15:34] you see i mean if we put it in the big
[15:37] picture
[15:38] see your messenger he is talking about
[15:41] the catholic church he powerless
[15:43] catholic but in the meantime there is
[15:46] another woman
[15:48] associated with a catholic president
[15:50] associated
[15:51] uniform president catholic so it's
[15:55] almost the same the same they say the
[15:57] moment
[15:58] the man so the color they are wearing
[16:02] is it's a symbol symbol
[16:08] kamala was uh
[16:11] what did they do the last thing was what
[16:14] when they did uh
[16:18] i don't know she was dressed in white
[16:21] letter b
[16:22] on blonde but now she's in the purple
[16:25] manor alien violet
[16:26] cat purple color
[16:30] has to do with royalty i have work
[16:34] evacuate
[16:36] so this woman can be like a queen the
[16:39] lord said from petra coming hen
[16:41] and the brother obama continue this is
[16:44] what you want to pay more attention
[16:58] he said the beast was scarlet
[17:03] but the woman was a rey in purple man
[17:06] la fermi dabier on violet
[17:09] do you get the difference who says no
[17:12] but no
[17:13] have i not warned you especially the
[17:16] other day
[17:16] especially
[17:30] i know carton is uh rideau
[17:32] [Music]
[17:34] cotton said silly dough but i don't
[17:37] think really he's he wants he's talking
[17:40] about just the curtain like with this
[17:42] week nothing we have in the parliament
[17:47] but probably in a sense what's the
[17:50] purpose of recording
[17:51] my sequel look beautiful is to cover
[17:54] something
[17:57] because when he's talking about the
[17:58] three cartons here
[18:02] cotton one the premiere is russia
[18:05] said larry the second curtain
[18:10] talking about the china parlance and
[18:22] i have warned you about the three
[18:24] curtains
[18:27] in other words the three maybe the three
[18:30] powers
[18:32] with songs i don't know how long i will
[18:36] live
[18:37] in london but remember this mess with an
[18:40] evil decision
[18:53] there is the iron curtain
[18:58] and there is a bamboo carton red china
[19:01] and so on
[19:02] [Music]
[19:07] and there is the purple cotton
[19:12] violet you watch that accountant
[19:14] observation you do
[19:16] that's the deceiver
[19:23] so when we are dealing with calculus
[19:28] we have to examine what we are looking
[19:30] at examination
[19:32] went on
[19:36] it's wonderful shows me over here but
[19:38] what is this
[19:39] what this means the united states
[19:43] listed as uni we for the catholic church
[19:46] avec le gris catholic
[19:47] which represent the purple curtains
[19:50] represented
[20:14] in the message conference down the
[20:16] message conference
[20:18] you see brother i was talking about the
[20:20] iron curtain i love your wife
[20:25] and this is in reference with kuchev
[20:28] allah says reference chef

[20:41] did you know what the name
[20:45] means in russia
[20:58] he was a heading up of the of them
[21:01] kingdoms

[21:09] one of the the previous united states
[21:12] president
[21:13] the ancient highway telling them
[21:20] and you know ivan and clay and they
[21:23] couldn't mix together
[21:30] i don't want to go into the detail i
[21:32] talk about the things
[21:34] that the type of ladies show but as we
[21:36] skip listen
[21:39] just said the lord and silly senior
[21:41] repent
[21:44] i predicted three curtains
[21:50] in the name of the lord don't you know
[21:52] do senior
[21:53] there is one called the iron curtain
[21:56] yeah
[22:04] not the united uh uh
[22:08] republic soviets whatever it is
[22:12] yeah which will be russia
[22:19] what you read in china
[22:24] there will be a bamboo carton
[22:29] the bamboo they are horrible
[22:33] but man watch the purple cotton
[22:38] observer
[22:40] that's rising in the united states he is
[22:43] a level of zetas union

[24:57] highlight a few things like this of
[24:59] religious personnel
[25:00] certain shows come south but uh my
[25:03] message or my inspiration
[25:04] is mehmon inspiration we want to have a
[25:08] practical
[25:08] experience of the altar
[25:12] my knowledge of bombay
[25:26] but i want to have a practical
[25:29] experience tonight a measure of
[25:31] worrying experience practicua to give
[25:34] each one of us the opportunity
[25:36] for donation the new opportunity either
[25:39] to come to the altar
[25:45] so that you can die to yourself
[25:50] and have that experience they have worse
[25:53] experience because we can
[25:55] read the quote
[25:58] we can see the picture photo those who
[26:02] did not see the picture sister if you
[26:03] can uh
[26:04] show how kamala was dressed in purple if
[26:07] it was
[26:07] she's seeking a pavilion
[26:18] with the right hand on a vehicular man
[26:20] dwight levy
[26:21] and the left hand probably on the bible
[26:24] and the constitution a
[26:25] man gosh probably biblical constitution
[26:28] swearing as the vice president of the
[26:32] united states
[26:33] for the next four years
[26:51] like this year and those visions they
[26:52] say they don't lie
[26:54] in the mountain
[26:58] people can search in such settings
[27:01] but for me it's
[27:04] not about knowledge it's in a bad luck
[27:11] these things should bring you and i on
[27:14] our knees for the preparations
[27:20] amen amen so let us take the text i love
[27:23] cannoli text
[27:25] where i left off on uh sunday now
[27:29] italy dimash i want to read in the book
[27:32] of
[27:32] exodus
[27:35] exodus the third chapter
[27:40] i will just go first and read it in uh
[27:42] in english
[27:45] and you can follow with your friends
[27:50] says now moses kept the flock of jito
[27:54] he is the father-in-law the priest of
[27:56] media
[27:57] and he led the flock to the backside
[28:01] of the desert and came to the mountain
[28:04] of god even to orb
[28:08] and the angel of the lord appeared
[28:12] unto him in a flame of fire out of the
[28:15] midst
[28:16] of the bush of a bush and he looked and
[28:20] behold the bush
[28:21] burned with fire and the bush was not
[28:24] consumed
[28:26] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[28:30] see this great sight why the bush
[28:33] is not burned and when the lord
[28:36] saw that he turned aside to see god
[28:39] called
[28:40] unto him out of the midst of the bush
[28:42] and he said moses moses
[28:44] and he said here am i
[28:48] and he said do not night
[28:52] higher put off thy shoes
[28:55] form off thy feet for the place whereon
[28:59] thou standest is holy ground
[29:05] moreover he said i am the god
[29:08] of thy father the god of abraham the god
[29:11] of isaac
[29:12] and the god of jacob and moses hid his
[29:15] face
[29:16] for he was afraid to look upon god
[29:21] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[29:24] affliction
[29:25] of my people which are in egypt
[29:28] and have heard their cry by reason
[29:31] of their task masters masters for
[29:35] i know their souls
[29:39] may the lord add the blessing to the
[29:41] reading of the scripture
[29:45] and i want also to look at the first
[29:47] corinthians chapter 15.
[29:52] unconventional
[29:54] corinthians chapter 15 unconventional
[29:56] peter kansas
[29:58] verse 30 verse 8 christ
[30:05] and why stand away in jeopardy every
[30:08] hour
[30:11] i protest by your by your rejoicing
[30:15] which i have in christ jesus our lord
[30:18] i die daily
[30:22] i die daily
[30:26] that was the apostle paul says
[30:29] paul may the lord add the blessing to
[30:32] the reading okay listen
[30:35] so we are going to speak a little bit
[30:38] along
[30:39] parliament and uh have maybe 30 minutes
[30:42] they have a debt account minute where
[30:45] each person will
[30:46] give himself or herself the
[31:16] life can't come from it
[31:21] unless a man dies and hurts in his
[31:24] own thoughts
[31:29] christ can't get into his heart christ
[31:38] when you are trying to think for
[31:40] yourself can we say the possible woman
[31:43] now if i walk up to the altar and say
[31:46] yes lord yes
[31:50] i'm a fine fellow just reasonable miss
[31:52] you i will take you
[31:53] yo i i will pay my tithes
[31:58] i will do this that's not the purpose of
[32:01] the altar
[32:04] amen amen this is to say people can come
[32:08] at the altar or make ultra where they
[32:11] are who fell the lord
[32:12] we
[32:24] is to come and to give yourself in
[32:26] sacrifice
[32:30] lord i want to die to my own
[32:34] representative i want to die to my
[32:36] thoughts
[32:38] i want to die to myself
[32:54] the new birth competition but we have to
[32:58] go through that mess
[33:01] and i want to invite you to that mess
[33:03] tonight
[33:07] brother continued
[33:09] [Music]
[33:12] you got to die and hurt right there to
[33:15] your thoughts
[33:17] [Music]
[33:19] that's the reason why you come to the
[33:22] altar
[33:36] is also
[33:46] faith is the substance i skip to court
[33:49] and i will go back
[34:05] people up around the altar
[34:10] they didn't do that in the bible time in
[34:13] illinois
[34:14] that's a tradition of our people la
[34:17] silla traditions
[34:20] formerly in the methodist church
[34:25] original modern ligasement to distance
[34:27] but look
[34:28] marigold it's a good thing certain born
[34:31] shows
[34:31] i don't like this dry eyed
[34:34] repentance repentance
[34:38] i like to see somebody get up and really
[34:41] be sorry for what they've done
[34:52] amen amen so what is he trying to say
[34:56] here
[34:56] yes he don't try to say the deal you see
[34:58] in the bible
[35:00] there is no altar called
[35:51] amen amen so the bottom line
[35:56] is to do it the way the uh god's way
[36:00] say the first did you that's why brother
[36:03] bonham said
[36:05] in the message god's a provided way
[36:08] message
[36:11] 11 11 of owns brother bottom said
[36:14] and you are bound to be backsliding
[36:18] constantly
[36:19] [Music]
[36:24] so it takes a constant prayer to god
[36:28] a loss is a demand in prayer constantly
[36:32] so dying daily means constant prayers
[36:51] and my purpose is lemon beauty to
[36:54] rebuild
[36:55] [Music]

[37:00] church although
[37:04] believers although
[37:20] how much more i i am going i commemorate
[37:24] foreign
[37:26] amen amen so that is something that we
[37:29] cannot
[37:30] overlook this is a passion per se
[37:33] that's something that will become a part
[37:37] of our life
[37:40] and let me tell you listen he knew that
[37:44] as a part of our life
[37:48] he should have a starting point sadduce
[37:52] and i want tonight to be the starting
[37:55] point the death hold upon the departure
[37:57] that was really my inspiration sensitive
[38:00] vermont
[38:00] inspiration and i will read what brother
[38:04] bonham said
[38:06] from this meeting they said they said
[38:09] let this altar be rebuilt
[38:16] so that we can know how to die daily
[38:19] pogan opposition
[38:22] and give ourselves to the lord you know
[38:24] dunya
[38:26] and the brother brother said yes and
[38:29] if you have to die daily and see
[39:11] to have to stay there dead is still
[39:15] about more
[39:16] all the time at two more more amen amen
[39:19] a place where you die you see a spirit
[39:23] affecting your life for maybe many years
[39:26] speaking
[39:40] is altars
[39:45] to be dying every day
[39:51] continue and i'm continuing if paul had
[39:54] to die daily to stay right with god
[40:00] so we will all have to do that
[40:04] just die out to ourselves
[40:08] [Music]
[40:09] and that's getting god's way see the
[40:12] policy
[40:13] of what they do god has a provided way
[40:18] that you are in vapor
[40:20] to die to yourself
[40:24] there is only two ways of anything
[40:27] inaudible
[40:30] that's the right way and the wrong way
[40:35] and the damn ways are your ways and
[40:38] god's way
[40:42] and you can't be in your way and god's
[40:45] way
[40:45] at the same time
[40:50] so you have to die either your own way
[40:54] um oh god's way
[40:57] who saluted you and the god has provided
[41:00] a way
[41:02] you know what is the altar hotel
[41:06] you have got to forget your own way to
[41:09] get in god's way
[41:14] and you've got to get out of your own
[41:16] way to get in god's way resorted to
[41:19] voters
[41:22] but our own way not of war is to be
[41:25] it's almost what we said last sunday a
[41:27] classical way let's see
[41:30] you know or you come you sit down with
[41:33] veneer moves i say yay
[41:35] you put your glasses you read your bible
[41:40] to be blessed and that's it but as we
[41:43] write the book of
[41:44] exodus a communist only liver disorder
[41:47] we need a personal experience with a guy
[41:50] who's a woman
[41:51] didn't experience personnel and that to
[41:53] experience
[41:54] come with the altar experience
[41:58] when you welcome that thing in your
[42:24] you have to start with doctrine 101.
[42:41] [Applause]
[42:45] you are out of his way visit all this
[42:49] world and now
[42:54] look at the word forsake forsake
[42:56] forsaken
[43:00] so forsake your way abandoned
[43:04] forsake your thoughts
[43:08] forsake everything
[43:25] listen if you don't you are not born
[43:27] again you will not panic
[43:28] nouveau you are not dead to yourself
[43:32] you cannot see the kingdom of god
[43:38] that's the only way because that's the
[43:39] lasso of one
[43:41] and that the dust said the lord lassen
[43:44] and that's what we want tonight
