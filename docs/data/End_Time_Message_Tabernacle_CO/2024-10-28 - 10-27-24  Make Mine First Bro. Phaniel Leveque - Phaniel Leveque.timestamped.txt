[1:01:19] Jesus amen
[1:01:22] amen and we are all happy
[1:01:31] we are
[1:01:32] all we are all happy to be in the house
[1:01:35] of the
[1:01:36] Lord and uh this is where the
[1:01:40] blessings are falling upon the
[1:01:44] people amen amen thank you
[1:01:49] musicians uh song
[1:01:52] leader the worship was fantabulous you
[1:01:56] remember that
[1:01:59] word
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:03] amen when we put a new word we have to
[1:02:05] use
[1:02:08] it it's very very important when you
[1:02:11] come to church to praise
[1:02:16] God uh let's take first
[1:02:20] Samuel as you are
[1:02:23] sitting first Samuel
[1:02:28] 16 verse
[1:02:34] 23 listen to what the Bible
[1:02:39] say and it came to pass when the evil
[1:02:44] spirit from God was upon Saul that David
[1:02:49] took a hop and play with his hand so
[1:02:54] Saul was refreshed
[1:02:56] and was well and the evil spirit
[1:03:00] departed from him
[1:03:16] am Soul was
[1:03:22] refreshed and was well
[1:03:28] so when you come with heaviness and many
[1:03:33] things maybe
[1:03:36] sicknesses
[1:03:38] worries and you cannot really get into
[1:03:40] the spirit of
[1:03:43] worship just
[1:03:45] tell David tell
[1:03:50] David take the
[1:03:52] har play some courses
[1:03:56] and the bad evil
[1:03:59] spirit are going to
[1:04:01] leave in the
[1:04:03] message the mighty

[1:04:50] to interpret the Bible
[1:04:56] and he is interpreting the scripture we
[1:05:03] read no no did I write it wrong
[1:05:07] paragraph
[1:05:13] 366 no it was another
[1:05:16] scripture

[1:06:00] 1955 paragraph
[1:06:04] 20 is interpreting that
[1:06:07] scripture and the Bible the message
[1:06:11] say pay close
[1:06:13] attention shame on you people don't
[1:06:17] believe in string
[1:06:24] music that's the
[1:06:27] interpretation when you come to
[1:06:29] church you feel
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:33] heavy instead of worshiping the
[1:06:37] king you feel like uh no if I do it
[1:06:41] somebody's going to
[1:06:44] see it's not for me I'm a very important
[1:06:49] man let me tell you about the
[1:06:52] David David was a king
[1:06:58] a
[1:06:59] King when he came in the presence of the
[1:07:03] Lord he forgot he wear
[1:07:07] suit he forgot he has a body
[1:07:12] guard he just take the guitar or the
[1:07:16] har he was
[1:07:19] playing with all his mind all his being
[1:07:24] his mind was in the worship of the
[1:07:28] Lord to the extent the evil spirit could
[1:07:33] not
[1:07:34] stand that's why brother sister whoever
[1:07:38] you are when you come time to
[1:07:41] worship even young people stand up don't
[1:07:46] you think if I
[1:07:48] stand my

[1:08:08] said shame on
[1:08:11] you people don't believe in string
[1:08:18] music no
[1:08:21] wonder evil spirits never like it
[1:08:27] they have to get
[1:08:30] away David cast out
[1:08:36] Devil by playing on his string
[1:08:41] instrument that's what the scripture
[1:08:46] says that's right and when David will
[1:08:50] begin to
[1:08:51] play the evil spirit
[1:08:55] leave

[1:31:57] again we simply want to be a blessing
[1:32:00] for one
[1:32:03] another we are living in a very special
[1:32:06] time a very extraordinary
[1:32:14] time and I think one of the preaching
[1:32:17] that we hear in this
[1:32:19] message is the getting ready of this
[1:32:22] little bride
[1:32:25] and I believe we have reach a
[1:32:29] time where we have to speed
[1:32:33] up uh based on our
[1:32:37] preparation the day of marriage is
[1:32:40] waiting is
[1:32:41] coming do you agree with that this
[1:32:45] morning we can uh notice around
[1:32:51] us that the prophecy is being fulfilled
[1:32:56] we can see the falling down of the
[1:32:58] world everything is
[1:33:01] ready everything is ready at this very
[1:33:04] time God is waiting from
[1:33:07] us God is expecting is waiting for
[1:33:12] us it's now the time to go
[1:33:18] back it's not the time as a Lord's wife
[1:33:21] to ask more time
[1:33:23] it's
[1:33:28] death that's why that's how was the
[1:33:31] plane don't look
[1:33:35] back when you are living
[1:33:40] s that's how there was the
[1:33:43] instructions very
[1:33:46] severe and we want to emphasize on
[1:33:51] that have your eyes fixed on Jesus
[1:33:55] Jus everything that the word is telling
[1:33:58] us is the
[1:34:00] type to prepare us
[1:34:03] today don't look
[1:34:06] back it seems to be uh
[1:34:13] little we say we made a decision to
[1:34:15] leave Sodom
[1:34:17] Andor but we're not going
[1:34:21] back but just allow my eyes to see
[1:34:26] but why God asked them not to turn
[1:34:30] around because he know exactly what's
[1:34:33] going to
[1:34:34] happen that's how was the instructions
[1:34:37] and this
[1:34:40] morning we are going to title our word
[1:34:43] our
[1:34:46] preaching make me first amen
[1:34:51] amen make mine first

[2:20:40] Bing and had faith
[2:20:43] in and he have faith in everything that
[2:20:46] he
[2:20:47] did because Jehovah required it
[2:20:51] if you can just do
[2:20:54] that Jehovah requireed a burnt offering
[2:20:57] for his sin and
[2:20:58] job not only for

[2:21:34] have to keep on
[2:21:36] walking yes
[2:21:38] again it's less than
[2:21:41] that just have faith in his
[2:21:45] word and if you make his word your
[2:21:48] absolute
[2:21:52] any Divine promise in the
[2:21:55] Bible you can tie your soul to
[2:21:59] it no matter how much the waves
[2:22:02] with you still
[2:22:04] TI to your
[2:22:07] absolute
[2:22:11] 55
[2:22:13] amen Pro God's promises are always
[2:22:17] uncondition they are always condition
[2:22:21] sometime we have to jump over conditions
[2:22:24] there are
[2:22:26] conditions you must first accept the
[2:22:30] conditions that's mistakes when we we
[2:22:32] have our eyes
[2:22:34] closed and the word is asking us to do
[2:22:38] something with things
[2:22:41] difficult but when the woman believe the
[2:22:43] word listen to the
[2:22:46] word she had the revelation of the word
[2:22:52] she knew that there will be a change of
[2:23:03] dispensation she knew that the food will
[2:23:05] not lack in the natural they said it
[2:23:07] will not be enough amen
[2:23:10] amen hallelujah
[2:23:14] hallelujah you have to
[2:23:21] no matter how fundamental you are with
[2:23:23] the
[2:23:24] promise it's under
[2:23:27] condition if we can just stop
[2:23:32] here and turn this
[2:23:34] scripture hours and
[2:23:41] see that the condition is what means
[2:23:48] something you can just be as as
[2:23:50] fundamental as you want
[2:23:52] to but it's under
[2:23:55] condition by the
[2:23:57] promise
[2:24:02] predestination
[2:24:04] Abraham believed
[2:24:06] God and it was imputed unto him for
[2:24:14] righteousness what orble things it will
[2:24:16] be to meet the Civilized world
[2:24:20] man of 75 years

[2:24:43] absolute there was nothing going to move
[2:24:48] him when the first month he didn't
[2:24:52] happen is absolute held that's the
[2:24:56] key there's no
[2:24:58] [Music]
[2:24:59] time God is never
[2:25:03] late the absolute is always
[2:25:06] present the absolute always
[2:25:10] stands is absolute
[2:25:13] held because he know that he had talked
[2:25:16] to God the second month the second year
[2:25:20] year 10
[2:25:22] years 25 years
[2:25:27] later when he was 100 and Sarah was

[2:26:03] got to be a problem you said this but
[2:26:07] no the way God
[2:26:09] works is different from the thinking of
[2:26:12] a
[2:26:13] man people were started talking about
[2:26:16] Joseph but the word of God stands the
[2:26:18] same

[2:42:33] mistake that we do we don't read the
[2:42:36] condition the rules
[2:42:38] condition we don't argue to have a good
[2:42:41] interest
[2:42:43] rate andtime then we wonder why we keep
[2:42:46] paying it doesn't stop
[2:42:49] because you're paying a lot of interest
[2:42:51] you're paying a lot of
[2:42:54] interest you have to read the condition
[2:42:57] first don't be excited to get a loan I I
[2:43:01] got a
[2:43:02] loan but read the
[2:43:06] condition after reading the rules and
[2:43:08] the

[2:43:35] lawyer because you don't have much
[2:43:39] knowledge and then you ask the
[2:43:42] lawyer to check double check every
[2:43:45] lines and it will double check every
[2:43:47] lines
