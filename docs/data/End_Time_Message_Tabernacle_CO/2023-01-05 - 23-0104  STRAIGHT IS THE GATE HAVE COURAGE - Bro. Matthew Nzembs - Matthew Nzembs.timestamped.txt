[37:48] and God looked upon the Earth and behold
[37:51] he was corrupt for all the flesh had
[37:54] corrupted his way upon the earth that is
[37:59] and God looked upon the Earth and behold
[38:01] he was corrupted for all the flesh had
[38:04] corrupted his way upon the Earth

[38:44] chapter 7 verse 16.
[38:55] and they that went in went in the male
[38:58] and female of all the Flesh and God had
[39:01] commended him and the Lord shut him in
[39:05] you may be seated
[39:10] thank you our pastor for the opportunity
[39:16] and I greet you all in the name of the
[39:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[39:21] and my best wishes to all of you

[39:35] foreign
[40:05] was appeased he remember vachi and what
[40:09] she had done and what was decreed
[40:12] against her
[40:15] then said the king's servant that
[40:18] ministered unto him let there be fair
[40:20] young virgin sought for the king
[40:24] and let the king appoint officers in all
[40:27] the provinces of the kingdom and they
[40:29] may gather together all the fair young
[40:31] virgins onto the shushen the past to the
[40:35] house of the woman unto the custody of
[40:37] the age a guy the king's Chamberlain
[40:40] Keeper of the women and Lady things for
[40:44] purification be given to them
[40:47] and let the maiden which please the king
[40:50] the Queen instead of vachi and the thing
[40:52] please
[40:54] uh the king and he did so
[40:57] now in shushing the palace there was a
[41:00] certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the
[41:04] son of jair the son of shimei the son of
[41:07] Kish and benjamite
[41:10] who had been carried away from Jerusalem
[41:13] with the Captivity which had been
[41:16] carried away with jokonia king of Judah
[41:19] whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[41:22] had carried away
[41:24] and he brought up others that is Esther
[41:27] his uncle's daughter for she had neither
[41:31] father no matter
[41:32] and the maid was fair and beautiful whom
[41:36] Mordecai when he her father and mother
[41:39] were dead took for his own daughter
[41:43] so he came to pass when the king's
[41:45] commandment and his degree decree Was
[41:48] Heard and when many men were gathered
[41:50] together onto the shushing the palace to
[41:53] the custody of a guy that Esther was

[41:58] the custody of a guy Keeper of the woman
[42:01] and the Maiden pleased him and she
[42:04] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[42:07] gave her her things for purification
[42:10] which suches belonged to her and seven
[42:13] men which were made to be given her
[42:16] out of the King's house and you prefer
[42:18] her and are made unto the best place of
[42:22] of the House of the woman
[42:25] Esther had not shown or people know her
[42:29] Kindred or or for Mordecai her charger
[42:32] that she should not shoot
[42:35] and Mordecai walked every day before the
[42:38] courts of the women's house to know how
[42:41] Esther did and what should become of her
[42:45] now when Every Man's turn was to come to
[42:50] go in the king's azuris after she had
[42:53] been 12 months according to the manner
[42:55] of the women for so with the days of the
[42:58] purification accomplished to wait six
[43:01] months with all of myrrh and six months
[43:04] with sweet orders and with other things

[43:11] then thus came every Maiden unto the
[43:14] King was who whatsoever she desired was
[43:17] given her to go with her out of the
[43:20] house of the women and to the King's
[43:21] house

[43:25] morrow she returned in the second house
[43:28] of the woman to the custody of
[43:31] the king's Chamberlain which kept the
[43:34] concubine she came she came in unto the
[43:37] king no more except the king delighted
[43:40] in her that she was called by name
[43:44] now when the the turn of Esther the
[43:47] daughter of the
[43:48] uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for
[43:51] his daughter was come to go into onto
[43:55] the Kings she required nothing but what
[43:57] a guy the king's Chamberlain The Keeper
[44:00] of the woman appointed and Esther
