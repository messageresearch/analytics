[1:04:23] of his disciples
[1:04:25] 8
[1:04:29] and not and and said unto him i'll doubt
[1:04:32] he

[1:04:49] things which
[1:04:50] ye do hear and see levoir
[1:05:07] the gospel preached to them
[1:05:11] are you the one or we have to wait for
[1:05:12] another one about the same one jesus
[1:05:14] didn't say it's me
[1:05:16] it's not me
[1:05:20] what you have
[1:05:34] and the gospel is preached
[1:05:38] this is the way of god to identify
[1:05:40] himself second psychiatry
[1:05:42] it is the way he writes no nonsense
[1:05:45] our names as mysteries amen amen y'all
[1:05:49] now today
[1:05:52] said grand promise daily god has given
[1:05:55] unto us this big promise of elijah
[1:05:58] now these many people say i
[1:06:01] i agree a little bit later
[1:06:11] but jesus gave us a precision here that
[1:06:13] might be
[1:06:14] the same matthew's chapter 17.
[1:06:19] revision we know all these things we are
[1:06:21] just you know revising
[1:06:23] i said descent matthew 17
[1:06:28] versus this set this turn
[1:06:33] they said this matthew 17 the verse 10
[1:06:37] the disciples said question and the
[1:06:40] disciple asked him this question asking
[1:06:42] to jesus
[1:06:43] let's keep this till
[1:06:47] and saying why them say the script
[1:06:49] described that
[1:06:50] a lie must first come equity listen
[1:06:53] jesus commander upon
[1:06:55] jesus the word jesus and jesus answered
[1:06:58] unto them
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:46] then the disciple understood that he
[1:07:49] speak unto them
[1:07:50] of john the baptist electrically
[1:07:53] it's true that elijah has to come
[1:08:23] amen amen and if you read the difference
[1:08:29] john was supposed to prepare the way for
[1:08:31] the lord
[1:08:33] of management
[1:08:36] before the judgment's day john can
[1:08:38] revenge when john was coming he lived
[1:08:42] he was coming from the grace of jesus
[1:08:44] because jesus was the greatest
[1:08:46] preacher that was coming after john you
[1:08:48] done the last time
[1:08:49] elijah from the handcuffs yeah
[1:09:04] now listen

[1:10:27] they have blinded the people
[1:10:42] he wants to blind the people a
[1:10:44] civilization
[1:10:48] the truth of this world
[1:10:52] ask god to to to to to help you to give
[1:10:55] you his grace
[1:10:56] jesus didn't show
[1:11:10] jesus
[1:11:37] we have moses a zombie avexa and
[1:11:42] they they were there with that

[1:12:17] branham everything listen
[1:12:20] when god comes he brings the lord to
[1:12:23] moses
[1:12:24] he gives them his eye present so moses

[1:12:31] and when moses brought the lord they lay
[1:12:33] feet delivered
[1:13:04] when they were saying moses
[1:13:10] god said into moses and today
[1:13:15] why do we say brothers

[1:13:34] unfounded you the children of god you
[1:13:37] complain you will understand

[2:38:26] of malachi
[2:38:27] [Music]
[2:38:34] [Music]
[2:38:39] maybe it was the need of somebody
[2:38:55] you have to believe the prophet
[2:39:00] we have so many sermons
[2:39:05] if we can spend more time listening to
[2:39:08] those
[2:39:14] but knowing that this is a question of
[2:39:16] life or death
[2:39:18] message
[2:39:21] never neglect anything from what the
[2:39:23] prophet said
[2:39:24] jeremiah shows the secular prophet they
[2:39:27] think
[2:39:28] that is different from us the gentiles
[2:39:31] and the jews
[2:39:31] the kingdom deferred they choose
[2:39:35] they know the value of a word coming off
[2:39:38] the map
[2:39:43] when a prophet said call it prophet d
[2:39:47] you know they even come to the point to
[2:39:50] say jesus who are you here is you see
[2:39:54] killed you see
[2:39:54] we need moses but they forgot
[2:39:58] my zombie he was the god of moses
[2:40:02] amen but how many things we have heard
[2:40:05] from the message
[2:40:08] to the extent today they tell you
[2:40:14] we don't pay attention they show you
[2:40:17] brother
[2:40:17] said
[2:40:29] [Music]
[2:40:33] those abc's say are they saying of the
[2:40:36] message
[2:40:36] to message amen with things like

[2:40:51] god remains god he arrested you amen
[2:40:55] and that will bring this success in our
[2:40:57] families
[2:41:01] he spoke about the relationship between
[2:41:03] husband and wife
[2:41:08] but in the spiritual way also it's
[2:41:10] applicable
[2:41:12] spirituality relationship between christ
[2:41:15] and the church
[2:41:19] relationship between the pastor and the
[2:41:21] church
[2:41:25] sometimes the church can write five
[2:41:27] pages against the pastor
[2:41:48] [Music]
[2:41:55] [Music]
[2:41:57] davos uh my prayer is god to strengthen
