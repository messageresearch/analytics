[59:12] afternoon Lord what a gracious God you
[59:15] are Lord as we listen to the service
[59:18] this
[59:22] morning Lord we just thank you for the
[59:24] Revelation that you've poured out upon
[59:26] your
[59:26] [Music]
[59:29] bride because without those Thunders
[59:31] that have come
[59:34] forth Lord we don't know where we would
[59:39] be Lord we know it's only a love affair
[59:41] between you and
[59:44] us it's your grace that you've given us
[59:47] those
[59:50] Revelations Lord help us not to take
[59:52] these things lightly
[59:55] [Music]
[59:56] but as your Prophet said in in that
[59:58] message a bless blushing
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:01] Prophet that if we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ then we should be
[1:00:08] fruitful Lord we don't want to be a
[1:00:09] Barren
[1:00:12] bride but this message was to gather the
[1:00:15] bride
[1:00:17] together help us to be fruitful
[1:00:21] Lord those people that are lost help us
[1:00:23] to reach those lost souls
[1:00:27] Lord your Prophet reached a million
[1:00:31] [Music]
[1:00:32] souls he told us he ought have had 10
[1:00:36] million Lord then I look at
[1:00:39] myself and I think to myself how many
[1:00:41] Souls have I
[1:00:44] won Lord as the prophet said we're so
[1:00:46] far
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:48] behind extend your mercy and Grace Upon
[1:00:51] Us
[1:00:54] father give us courage give us
[1:00:57] strength help us to be a testimony to
[1:01:00] everyone we come in contact
[1:01:04] with Lord we know your rapture is coming
[1:01:08] soon but the scripture says you won't
[1:01:10] lose
[1:01:12] one and if this message is to spread
[1:01:15] Lord whose lips are you going to use but
[1:01:19] mine if the works of God are going to be
[1:01:21] done Lord whose hands are you going to
[1:01:23] use
[1:01:27] Lord we just ask that you would help us
[1:01:29] to be fully surrendered to
[1:01:34] you we just ask that you would bless the
[1:01:38] pastor bless him in all of his
[1:01:41] efforts Lord we just ask that you would
[1:01:43] bless this
[1:01:45] church Lord that it might be a
[1:01:47] lighthouse in the on the land from a
[1:01:49] stormy
[1:01:53] sea that even those that are lost in the
[1:01:56] storm can look at this church and
[1:01:57] receive the
[1:01:59] light because as your Prophet
[1:02:02] said if we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ he has shed his blood for
[1:02:09] us and that blood was shed so it could
[1:02:12] live inside our
[1:02:16] lives and therefore the very works that
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:21] did will be living through our lives
[1:02:25] just ask that you would be with
[1:02:28] us bring us back
[1:02:31] safe until you're coming we ask in Jesus
