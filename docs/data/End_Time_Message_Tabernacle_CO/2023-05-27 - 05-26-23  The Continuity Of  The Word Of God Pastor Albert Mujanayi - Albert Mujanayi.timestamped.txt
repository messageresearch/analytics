[35:28] Christ
[35:31] as we stand up
[35:33] you can take our Bibles don't leave the
[35:36] Machu in the Book of Matthew
[35:39] 27.
[35:46] the system can do is verse 52 53.
[35:58] ie
[36:08] it is
[36:13] the person
[36:16] and the Gravely opened and many bodies
[36:19] of the Saints which slap a rose and came
[36:21] out of the Grave after his resurrection
[36:24] and went into the body in the holy city
[36:27] and appear unto many
[36:44] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[36:48] maybe see it
[36:54] is
[36:58] I try to speak about the law of
[37:01] continuity
[37:03] continuity
[37:04] see
[37:10] it's a law of God through which he
[37:14] directs the universe
[37:19] existence because it's God who created
[37:22] the universe
[37:28] and it's working with all the laws that
[37:32] is he established
[37:37] and when job saw the law of the nature
[37:41] foreign
[37:43] [Music]
[37:56] everything that God has done
[37:58] the man will still be
[38:04] the Twins
[38:06] and nothing can destroy or annihilate
[38:09] that
[38:11] [Music]
[38:16] that's why Solomon say I recognize and I
[38:19] know that everything that God has made
[38:21] will be forever
[38:28] and then that law of continuity brother
[38:31] Branham broke down in three parts
[38:36] continuity
[38:40] is talking about the continuity of the
[38:42] law of nature
[38:47] so that you can have an image about what
[38:49] I'm talking about
[38:52] it's when you see the nature for example
[38:55] when you see the sun in the celebs
[38:58] unless he always Rises at the East
[39:02] and then set at the west
[39:06] and that's the same routine every day
[39:11] he always rises from the East
[39:16] and always fits at the west
[39:21] and that's the continuity in the nature
[39:25] [Music]
[39:26] it's God who placed it for example
[39:29] example
[39:33] and they were Birds who are called
[39:36] migrated Birds they all migrate every
[39:38] time
[39:40] every time winter is coming
[39:45] they migrate
[39:47] is
[39:54] and every years every time when winter
[39:56] is coming they always migrate
[40:01] and God has given their intelligence
[40:08] you're not going to see them fighting
[40:10] each other
[40:12] there's gonna be one
[40:15] Chef who's gonna be the chief
[40:18] is
[40:21] and then the other ones will just come
[40:23] along without even uh discussing or
[40:26] disturbing each other
[40:28] before flying is
[40:33] they all gathered together among the one
[40:36] Chief a man is
[40:39] and those the person the bird the bird
[40:43] uh in which all those uh virtual
[40:46] gathering around him
[40:48] particularly he has some kind of
[40:50] personality
[40:52] and when he's uh he's acting a certain
[40:54] ways
[40:56] all the spirits understands
[40:59] that he is the leader only just get
[41:02] forward through the Sun and then you
[41:04] don't get to discuss or say you know to
[41:07] argue about it it's a law if we come in
[41:09] and when they fly to the group
[41:35] God has given him wisdom to understand
[41:38] or to uh to feel or where is a safe
[41:41] place
[41:43] and when he comes down and all the other
[41:46] birds comes down as well with him it
[41:48] can't be very past and when the winter
[41:50] is gone
[41:53] they understand that the winter is gone
[41:55] and they go backwards
[41:58] and that's Harmony in nature amen
[42:02] and continuity and there is where the
[42:05] continuity is
[42:13] all Gatherings done upon strategy in
[42:17] God's Minds
[42:19] it's always around one leader amen
[42:22] says
[42:27] in the curtains beyond the corner of
[42:29] times
[42:32] Believers will be gathering around their
[42:35] leaders
[42:36] and the Shepherds trying to say just
[42:39] kiddo you can't argue about it
[42:43] God gives him a particular thing
[42:47] and everybody else comes along
[42:54] [Music]
[43:12] because of his weight
[43:17] and God has given him an ability to
[43:20] protect himself who can just adopt a
[43:22] universe so that he can attack so that
[43:26] he can adapt to the winter Ros can leave
[43:28] when winter comes
[43:31] he uh they get together with uh the
[43:33] female elephant and the female is
[43:37] pregnant
[43:40] and they'll even sleep deeply
[43:44] and they can even sleep for months
[43:46] remember
[43:48] Empire
[43:49] [Music]
[43:51] through October and until the winter
[43:54] goes on they're still sleeping
[43:58] and it's still happening that way it's a
[44:01] routine
[44:02] I want to say I want to say to somebody
[44:07] don't compare yourself to somebody who
[44:10] uh flying or going where our system the
[44:14] protection amen God is always a system
[44:17] to protect you I want to tell you
[44:20] a person we don't want to compare
[44:23] ourselves with somebody else
[44:25] God Knows
[44:28] by your name
[44:30] he knows your life
[44:33] he is the one that's directing you amen
[44:38] the mistake is to compare yourself to
[44:41] someone else
[44:44] the other one flies when a winter comes
[44:47] imagery
[44:50] because he doesn't have something to
[44:52] protect him against winter
[44:54] but the other one is so uh it's uh it's
[44:57] so heavy group it doesn't migrate but
[45:01] it's protected amen hallelujah
[45:07] hello
