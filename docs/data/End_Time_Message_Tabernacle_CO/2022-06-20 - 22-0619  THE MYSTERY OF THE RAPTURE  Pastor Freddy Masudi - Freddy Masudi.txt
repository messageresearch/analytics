attention to the scripture because this is where your prosperity dwell the bible said proverb 1 8. my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother next verse for there shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck and i'm not talking only about the little children generally personally but all of us we are children of god founded you and if you have a living biological father an uncle an uncle etc this scripture also applies to us son listen to the instruction of thy father the bible never said son give your instruction to your father but you have to listen to the instructions of thy father the devil who is turning the thing upside down and also the same way to the congregation don't let your ears become so high neglect and where you cannot listen to anything a person when you start believing i'm on the top comfort pancakes you see what they should do that's a sign that sooner you are going to fall down god resists the proud resistance give grace to the house amen amen and give you another scripture ephesians chapter six ephesians four verse one about you the premier university oh good to see you brother just mokito god bless you amen so ephesians six ephesians verse one said verses this is a father's day si si and we want to remind the people the value of a father la value of the emperor and the father also hello perusia must know their own responsibility what survivor sees a proper responsibility why god made me a father my hundred years my god gave me children look what you might donate is unfortunate there is a purpose amen amen and the main purpose for the father for empire is to lead your children to salvation second season you can close them close to them close if they don't have christ sin not by christians you have not done much faith so that make us give us a big responsibility in grand responsibility and the more children you have the priesthood you are not a pastor this morning i want to thank god so my thank you very much for all the father's day messages you uh people have sent to me but one of them just made me cry he said dad papa happy father's day uh i know you should say with

coming out man javy de la museum a father remains a father emperor regardless of how much you can mess be important in your mind listen foreign if those who have read the brotherhood i'm talking about the casket of the father the casket casket yeah the day you will see your father in the casket okay it's gonna be too late that's your abstain you are not going to blame the body usually but you are going to have a good remembrance of at least something good he has done for you and this is how god wants us to have a heart like that do something good to somebody when that person is still alive your father vote even if he punishes you memphis always be positive rest positive just say it's for my benefit if you start looking at a thing like that you are on your own to progress that's what the bible promises in ephesians chapter 6 verse 1 verse 2 premiere the bible said the bibliography children are formed obey your parents in the lord will be here what is the promise that it may be well with thee and i may just live long on the earth if it's my word don't take it but if it's god's word my sister's only parody give it right to value exactly so father's day hello [Music] who shall come

[Music] i find that you're a very good church nancy grant in this great country open for certain zeglez refrades where many churches get of course there are civilizations because of the greatness of civilization because barbara was forsaken long time ago we have heard people say that he has never been our absolute party i believe that we shouldn't say such a thing those are really blasphemous it is really lack of respect important i don't see anybody that will take us to heaven if it's not brother brother and it's his message that takes us to heaven amen amen everything that he can tell us everything that he can say we have to believe it therefore i'd like to ask to keep that respect very toward him and there's a parody toward his word or siam versa family also toward his family therefore it's very important felicity and i wanted to congratulate you for that right yes hello the pastor already said everything it's good the children must have all that respect toward the fathers and mothers already said it oh no honor the father mother paul says that that's the first commandment with a promise [Music] somebody honors the father and mother hello therefore the lord will grant them to live longer amen amen and those of us he depends on the spiritual and we also have fathers in spirit in the spiritual pastor than the spiritual our pastor is our father spiritually therefore we have to respect him we have to pray for him that the person happened to hit something really hard this is uh it's uh actually to keep you on the line i thank you so you do not stray pascal because he's been a father every person a true father is not somebody that babysits the children they say [Music] [Music] you truly have to know that the past is that's truly your father uh you have to know that that's our father lele v to lift him up and to honor him that's very important to avoid pastor uh as a pastor i know many mistakes that the ship may do foreign but you don't want to say it to your pastor therefore understand that you're making a great mistake i've been a pastor a long time ago let me speak like that because i know how to deal with this but say to your pastor even things that you may feel ashamed about it's good it's not good to speak evil about the pastor it's a popular it's not good don't say the grizzler never progressing therefore that church will not move forward i didn't bring my quotation that is in the uh question and answer on the hebrews 8 chapter three but rome says counting for me respect but i'm saying when a family lacks respect toward the father said familiar emote but that family is dead most because the father is the blessing of the house man amen america the mother too pastor but here i'm talking about the pastor and say empty massage

take all them children and do everything else that them children receive the holy ghost said that you don't have to receive the holy ghost come later just like their fathers you do have a fair inexperience they have to have an experience it's not you see that there only there's a creature we're reading the scriptures yes sure yes of course but that's gonna count on pressure probably when we preach completely that will give them the baptism of the holy ghost because the bible said then they are pressured then while peter was preaching listen that the holy ghost came in do you understand that by the foreign ghost you have to be prepared to receive it you have to repent to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen to be sanctified believe the lord jesus christ as your savior you say amen today a prayer and then amen amen who is that you are justified circumcision it's as if you have never done anything but [Music] [Music] for the holy ghost to come and dwell with

holy ghost who understood that they say i'm available let me read it to you for pop and second don't think that uh pastor freddie he was just saying no no no let me see [Music] uh december 17 1959 paragraph paragraphy we're going to say that for the rest of the dead leave not for the space of a thousand years severe that's right in the rapture it's only those who are filled with the holy ghost all my friends are from this town wait yes from denver here and for this whole country cj proves selma avec my voicemail if i could only with my human voice bless into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost it would be the most wonderful revelation that you ever had in your life hand amen it's very very important if you die in the church you don't seek the holy ghost no you're just wasting your time on the center because god will only rupture those who are spirit or who the holy ghost is fulfilled please john thunder was a man can i hear you amen can i hear your amen amen amen you know the show is a victim therefore another thing with the rapture amen amen because where we at no some less than foundation we accept sons of god you have already told our names were written in the before the foundation of the world in the lamb's book live amen amen allah therefore sent down only those who are elected his life on earth was coming to the end amen amen therefore he preaches on the mystery of the rapture basketball that's what all he could give to the people because then people have to end up going into the rapture two lesser for us you say chairman from the like the seventh-day adventists it's from the first age jesus to the last age said they pulled up from your veins from the larger the master at the mountain stage that's the third watch larger the columbus columbus that's the fourth watch larger the litter litters that's the day william and wicked to the william branham rapture has to take place in this age luke is so messy we shall not all sleep no no more wrong person we shall not all sleep but we shall not be changed in the voice of the archangel they are also the last trumpet we shall sound right incorruptibly incorruptible this body will change come to let you laugh when all of them days they're not pastel pressures that the person were preaching something is getting in us say that's that pill of fire it's the power when they get into it changes your life [Applause] listen carefully because for us the plan of redemption is over amen but what ends up the plan of redemption is the opening of the seals coming of the lord himself himself to close the plan of redemption he comes to honor us amen oh jesus has never come no he let's sell my apartment no he has just appeared no no there is a clown no sell the sentence he is the holy ghost i don't know he's going to say oh god likes to get married gems gems universal money yeah james will get married first we followed by pastor foster hello family then the wife comes but we don't is [Applause] [Applause] you didn't know [Applause] but for [Applause] you want to go with this man and connie hallelujah therefore there's two mysteries it's coming let me sell the servants coming and also rebecca rebecca is the bride and it goes with it people because they don't understand the things i told them the coming of the lord is a tied to the plan of redemption celie you have to listen to him the one that shall not listen to him and there you shall be cast out may i pray but then it says it's isaiah who gives the precision virgin shall conceal enough and shall bring forth a son amen and jesus came amen amen amen amen but that child came from god amen did you understand it very well hallelujah hallelujah rejoice did you read the quotations only you only paid the price of the ramen who's there to send him into that amen but then when he left he went with the sins of the old testament that's right and there was a really even us we'll was interested interesting it was interceding interceding is interceding you say it man and god is somebody who plans things out yeah william there's william branham on earth hello and then god understands that everything is over let's get in can you say today hello therefore it means that the intersection is completely over completely completely over pasquetto he was interceding for the ignorance the second the prophet that's what the prophet says and the intercession was over can you say amen today you say amen to them therefore the mighty angels who's worthy to take the book because that's redemption 11 especially he had the holy ghost right of that time but why was he crying russia that's the redemption that's redemption your sister and when john turns around to luke and you he doesn't see the lion you know enough what he says with his blood [Applause] [Music] he had [Music] as a mighty angel [Applause] when we are redeemed by putting the lord jesus christ tell me that the covenant is over with da la mountain sunset on the mountain something seventeenth every year you have the february twenty eighth million of sunshine in 1963 and when the mighty engines with it [Applause] [Applause]
