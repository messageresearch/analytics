the way we ask those blessings in Jesus mighty name amen amen so once again tonight we have a privilege to have Pastor Gideon from DRC I think those who were here on Wednesday it was a blessing and I think again tonight it's going to be more and more to come so we need to be just under [Music] expectation and God is going to not only meet your expectation but he's going to exceed it yeah because he Jehovah he is Jehovah Rafa nobody can come into His presence and return amen am blessed be the name of the Lord so we will continue to sing as I think something has been delayed back there let's sing Mercy REO my life oh God Mercy REO my heart where I should have fall and my soul cast down by Mery [Music] God bless you GRE you on the name of Jesus Christ you may be seated it for a little bit before I take the scripture tonight I want to remind the vision that Willam bam saw about the bride was in 1964 he saw the bride going to in front of him see that bride was perfect she was going with uh you know the uh the steps of the word and then she was going in front of him and after after the bride he also saw the he saw other people coming as well he said that those people were horrible or they resemble to prostitute and he started to cry he said his heart almost stopped he said Lord is this the result of my work and my colleagues work to prepare the bride as he was weeping a voice told him and I'm going to say to the birth pain January 24 1965 and the voice told him the bride will come again I like the word to come again again you know the churches when they walked in they didn't go back again when dation fall it will never rise up again amen when the church went the bride went she had to go back again the second time he said paragraph 143 and 144 and suddenly I heard that sweet music that was coming back I I like the word coming back and see the same little bride was coming back it's not another it's the same bride that was going in front of him who went the first first time he was she was followed by churches that were they were horrible and the same bride that went forth the first time she had to come back again and the voice told him and here's what came from it who came from those denominations from those churches that went forth and never came back so when the bride came back amen she's exactly like the one was in the first place walking to the steps of the music of God's word amen she's marching on and when I saw it I stood there with both out there amen now he wasn't crying because of sadness because of joy and when I came back to myself I was standing on my porch out there looking right out across the field what she's to be the same bride the same kind build out the same kind of material that she was in the first place he said now read Malachi 4 and see if you're not supposed to have a message in the last days a message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers [Music] back to the original Pentecostal message words by word he said Brothers we are here amen now I understand here that the elah of Malachi 4 was not just sent for the the first coming of the Lord but also for the coming back of the Bride for the return of the Bride am amen am amen that's the truth brother now please let's stand and we're going to take Luke chapter 2 verse 42 to 4 remember it's the same church that has to come back with the ministry of Malachi 4 L Luke 2: 44-46 [Music] [Music] amen and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they turn the Child Jesus stried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they suppos they supposing him to have been in the company when a day uh a Day's Journey and they sought him among the king's folk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him I want I want to tell in re uh researching Jesus or looking for Jesus you may be seated looking for Jesus but just keep the vision that in your in your mind the Revival start when you notice that you are not with Jesus Anymore are we together I repeat the Revival starts when you begin to notice that you don't have Jesus with you you can walk without him without knowing or notic that the Bible says the day was long gone and Mary and Joseph didn't see him amen you know days went by they thought they had Jesus with them and Jesus was not with them and at least they noce that you know it wasn't with them amen it was the grace of God for them to notice that they didn't have Jesus with them because if you don't have him and you think you have him you're not going to look for him but when you know is that you don't have him you're going to look for him and what's good with Jesus when you living somewhere it's not going to go anywhere else it's still going to be at the same place if you go back where you found him amen that's why we we talking about looking for Jesus we cannot find him somewhere [Music] else you're going to find him when you left him they went to the uh the Feast of Pentecost were in the P Pentecost feast and they went then left him behind and they came back and they found exactly where they left him when take the scriptures in the message the sign the voice of the sign [Music] of February uh 1964 14 uh paragraph 145 as I as I I talked about it last [Music] day one of the remarkable scripture it's when Jesus was 12 years [Music] old when they left him for the Feast of the Pentecost [Music] it's one it's one of the remarkable scripture it's very important amen amen when they went with him to the P the Feast of the Pentecost they left himom in the message Shalom uh December 12th 1964 paragraph 95 he says this you know brave men I'm not talking about you know people who are not serious said brave men or good people caught in these things good people sincere people amen amen like Mary and Joseph they were very sincere see thinking he was with them he thought Jesus was with them while Jesus was not someone can be very sincere thinking that he is with Jesus while he's not with them amen amen if Jesus can help you to stop to verify and to notice that you're not with him you're going to go and look for him that's why they had to go back to go look for him they thought they had him I'm telling someone tonight don't think that you are with Jesus be sure that you are with Him amen my brother and sisters he said Mary and Joseph you know when they was up to the feast Jesus had 12 years old they thought presuming he was with them but he wasn't do you understand what I mean don't presume that you are with him be sure and certain that you are with Him [Music] amen he said good people today think the same thing they think they have Jesus while they don't have him these people that organized in this Council of churches these people in this organization they think they're good they're doing good [Music] thing they presuming is with them when they're not see many people think that he was with them when they shook hands with the preacher and put the name on the book when they counting among the members when they go and Sh the hands of the pastor thought they had Jesus they didn't many people thought when they were sprinkled confirmed baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost they thought they they had him said the good people Mary and Joseph was good people but the fact was he wasn't there said do not presume anything amen I imagine Joseph and Mary they were talking since the scripture talk in Matthew 18 verse 20 whatever two or three are Gather in my name I shall be in the me he say since we are together we believe according to the scripture he is with us I want someone to notice something that the presence of Jesus Christ it's very it's way far than the Scripture it is a reality there were two as the scripture said and Jesus was not with them do you understand what I mean just the fact to be two or according to the scripture it's not the fact that Jesus is with you you only have the the scripture you're just repeating the script that is not with you and many times we say or we are Jesus is with us I want us to understand another another way I don't want us to just repeat the scripture Jesus was not with them while they were two as the scripture say amen amen his presence is a reality it's more than a scripture oh listen to what the prophet say if God is with us where are all those Miracles paragraph 67 69 says how can you be in front of the wind without having wind blowing even though you don't see the wind but you can feel the wind amen amen how can you be in front of the wind without having the wind blowing he says how can you get in water without being wet the water what is wet that's the chemical of it amen it's the proof that that's water is the chemical of water what the water is it's wet and when you get in water you going to get wet there's nothing around it when you go inside you're going to get wet am amen you are not just in water because you you have to you are inside of the water because you are wet being wet that's the proof that you went inside of the water I have a story and met a doctor will treat uh crazy people or fo and and a crazy man told him hey doctor I'm Healed and the doctor told him are you here he said okay we're going to do a test and the doctor brought that crazy man to a big uh uh pool and the pool was empty and they didn't have any water inside of the pool and the doctor told the crazy man since you heal okay now you're going to uh swim here and the crazy man went inside the PO starting to do it's like it was acting like he was swimming while they didn't have water and the doctor said you swim very well you can come out he said did you did you notice your your clothes are wet no and he said no he said that means that you are not healed yet go back to the hospital because you cannot go inside the water without getting wet amen amen he said that's true says and when you get in the presence of God the supernatural there's going to be Supernatural sign and Supernatural working of a supernatural God yes my brothers and sisters when you go into his presence when Jesus is there things happens amen when Jesus is there all the sinner is convinced about his sin when Jesus is there all the sickness healed when Jesus is there things will happen there's nothing about separating those thing with God Amen says when you go inside the water you know wet that's impossible and Jesus is among you and nothing happens you come into church and go back the same way but he was there no no Joseph and Mary were in a good condition they walked for a good amount of time days went by Jesus was not with them but they thought he was there with them because the scripture says whatever two or three being two or three that doesn't be anything to convince you that Jesus is there there are things that go with his presence it's a supernatural God am when he's there things happen and I pray that he give us Grace tonight that his presence or leave the scripture and become so real that someone is going to be work amen wa of his presence yes my brothers and sisters amen amen amen that's why who where are the works where are the Miracles if God is with us where two or three are Gather in the name where are the Miracles am amen where are those signs where the new birth why the new the good repentance in his presence oh my brother and sisters are we just repeating scriptures when you are there in his presence all the fear got to hold of you when you are there in his presence I'm give you an example Isaiah was a good man what say he was well educated he had a good moral but one day he was there in the temple he said I was watching saw the Lord sitting in the Higher Throne and his Rob was filling all the throne and Isaiah was not preach about it all this time he thought he was a good man he had a good moral he had a good education he was good but when isah went into his presence he notice about his wellbeing his his being and he started to say he say oh sh me I am a man with unpure lips who told him that the presence of Jesus Amen in front of that Holiness in front of that Purity you notice about your real stakes and things will happen when Jesus is there I want tonight if someone notice that is done with Jesus let us do like Mary and Joseph we have to go and look for him I'm talking about looking for Jesus we can look for him only when you notice that you don't have him along with you amen amen amen amen my friend yes my brother and sister after this long journey they finally noticed that they only had the scripture do you understand only had the scripture but they didn't have Jesus amen Jesus was not with them and they sted to look for him am amen and today the church there are good people they start presuming or convince themselves that they have Jesus don't try to convince yourself that you are with him let him convince you amen because those are the sign that go along with him you know a piece of wood that was brought into his presence man one night that uh BL Blossom and he had flowers and fruit came out of it that's what his presence does Amen am amen his presence our sin are exposed Amen in his presence you receive the the uh the the for in his presence things happens amen amen I wanted to help somebody don't just talk tell yourself Jesus is with me no there are things that showing that Jesus is with you he cannot be with you and you're doing you're still doing the thing that you're doing because the pastor is not here because the Deacon can't see me because brothers and sister are not here even though no one is there but Jesus is there amen amen Jesus is there amen amen that's why it's good to walk with him I always tell my church it's the same thing here as well in a country like yours here how will the pastor how how can you uh watch over everyone what mechanism does he have to watch over all of us it's impossible but there's a eye that observing you amen there's a eye that observe you if you go into that presence and you you abide and he come comes inside of you am amen you don't have someone you don't need someone to watch over you he's still someone who's watching you am amen yes my brothers and sisters it's good because he's watching you and protect you amen that's the truth brother says this in the beginning he was it so November 2 Pap that reminds me of a father and mother or Foster Father Joseph and Mary the Virgin when they had went up to the Pentecostal Feast at [Music] Jerusalem they took the precious son the Lord Jesus and I guess the gospel took up among the people you can be too C among you know talking and doing different [Music] things the the regular routine till they went three days journey before they ever missed him they were just talking they were doing different things and they didn't even notice that Jesus went was left back he said I think the church has got caught up in that thing in that kind of condition more than a three days journey it's called about 2,000 years Journey amen amen from the first church in the Pentecost until here the end and now in the hour of Crisis you begin to wonder where he is it amen amen because you always need Jesus some some brother was talking to me here in United States He said brother Gideon here United States I don't have to pray to have a car I don't have to pray to have a a house if I have a job I will have a house if I have a job I will buy a I don't pray for the the food we still have it I say yes but one day you will need God amen amen even if you have insurance medical insurance one day insurance medical will be there and the doctor will be looking at it and we looking at you he say I can't do anything and the insurance can do anything for you you will need Jesus Christ then then be with him already amen am amen yes my brothers and sisters you will need Jesus there's no one that can say he doesn't need him never yes my brothers and sisters when I see people here you see those homeless people were they born like that they had sh they had a house before amen amen when they somewhere to stay they didn't need Jesus then need you need Jesus even if you have a shelter [Music] now you need Jesus even though you have medical insurance you need Jesus even though you have a job always need Jesus because when those things can help you Jesus will be your help amen now be sure to walk with him if you left him somewhere in a Bad Company you left him somewhere you know with B the bad Fellowship go back and start looking for him again amen amen and in the critical time you say where is he is where is amen you have to walk with him tonight when someone realize even after many years am amen Joseph and Mary did it they were good people said very sincere people but they work so many many days without him I want to help somebody to realize if you don't have Jesus with you start looking for him amen amen parag 36 he said the same the only way for you to find them is the way Mary and Joseph did to find them amen amen they found him where they left him that's where you will find him where did they leave him at the Pentecost to fistu say hallelujah that's where the church will find him at the Pentecost amen and today people don't don't they think they don't need that experience two kind of Christians there's a a Christian like a short chrisan and there's also a Christian who's filled with the Holy Ghost those two Christian are different you can just call yourself a Christian when the Temptation is there when the trials are coming you're going to fall he say oh no the the the flesh is weak but the one who filled with the Holy Ghost when the Temptation is coming so hard on when the flesh is weak the Holy Ghost will take over am amen amen my brothers and sister that's where you will find him at the Pentecost you have to go back to the Feast of Pentecost you have to go back to the pouring out of the Holy Ghost there you find the power of the almighty God you find the Risen Christ amen at the Pentecost oh at the P of the Holy Ghost that experience amen amen we have rejected you said we just we just need the word oh my brother and sister Joseph and Mary they had the word of God but they didn't have Jesus with them are we together amen oh people say we just but Mary and Joseph had words they didn't have no word with [Music] them the word say whatever two of three are Gather in my name I be the me there were two but Jesus was not with them they said oh we only did the word we don't need the power of the Holy Ghost but you have to go back to the Ping of the Holy Ghost that's where you found the power of the almighty God the power that will help us to detach ourself with the things of the world you will find the Risen Christ you will find sign and wonders of him just exactly like he said go back to where you find him go back to the beginning remember the vision of the Bride when the bride he was exactly how she she was in the beginning are we together she had that experience amen amen yes my brother and sisters if you don't have that experience you just repeating the scriptures amen amen you're just repeating the word of God but you are not a a witness of it nothing happened in your life says the message believe thou this ail 19 I'm just going to take a short he say when we go out of that Pentecostal experience when we go uh uh away from it we going away from Jesus this is exactly true my friend going away from the power of the Pentecost is to going away from [Music] Jesus and we live under our privileges amen amen that's why we have to go back to the Pentecost the vision show that we have to go back the some brothers to come back she had the same appearance she was made with the same type of thing uh uh word material amen yes my brother and sister she had the same F pentecost's experience now to go away from P PC Den P I'm not talking about the Pentecostal denomination P I'm talking about the experience of Pentecost I'm not even talking about the rural street but the Pentecost the original Pentecost Elijah Malachi came back with a message to turn back the hearts of children the faith of Pentecost bring about the same church at the end time says the church is Alpha and Omega not something between those two amen she's Alpha and Omega what she was at the beginning it's what she has to be at the end and when people went fall from it God in his love in his Mercy he say here I will send you Elijah the prophet to take the hearts of the children bring to the Pentecostal experience amen that's why Elijah came is to bring back the church in the end time am amen yes my brother and sisters as the bridegroom is the same yesterday today and forever the bride is also the same in the exception of the physical body we're not going to wear robs or with long beard by The Same Spirit will be here the end time in this church doing the same thing amen with the same experience yes my beloved Brothers says again he wasn't so at the beginning March 6 I'm going to take this he said that's exactly where the church left him they left him at the Pentecost now listen to what he saying he said the only way what what kind of way the only way for them to receive the true message is to go back to the Pentecost where they left him if you want to receive the true message the message are just not words or letters because I believe the message is more than those scriptures it's more than those uh uh uh tipes the message is the spirit and life Jesus say my words our life and spirit am amen yes my brothers and sisters the message is a message without being printed am amen I believe that day when B say the unveiling God he wasn't preaching the the the scripture we are the one reading the scripture when he was talking about the unveiling God he was truly the unveiling God he was paragraph this and that God being unveiled the the Mighty God showing in front of us he wasn't preaching a a book if they take this book they didn't steal my my message amen amen the message has to become a life in you they told John eat the book what you eating that's what you're becoming amen amen eat the book hallelujah praise God Amen that's the message amen praise God yes my brothers and sisters you have to be able to say said Peter said Andrew said and then we close the Bible you said paragraph paragraph paragraph this and that and then we close the book but we will never close God you can't close God God is still alive amen amen is talking about the Revival of the the country then in whale when people left your country here to go there and see the Revival in the and they saw a policeman they said little man we heard that there's a great Revival here what is the building that a Revival Tak he said you're looking for theing you looking for the address of the the Revival of the look at me look at me I'm here amen he became himself a Revival become the word yes my brother and sister become the message amen amen God want to see the same church at the beginning here in the end time that's why he sent this message amen what say go back where the the the the Holy Spirit came down as A Mighty Wind it came down on the church and when the the Holy Spirit went oh the heart were rejoicing for the power of God they went Healing The Sick casting all the bad spirits prophesying oh speaking fulfilling signs and wonders says brothers and [Music] sisters the only way for us to find God inside of the church is to go back to the Pentecost is to go back where we left him at the beginning amen it's the only way for us to see God in the church amen amen yes my beloved Brothers the only way to receive the true message the only way brother is really careful with the words the choing of words he's not just talking like that he really careful with when he says the only way it's truly the only way to find God in the church the only way to receive the true message amen because the true message it's not what's been written it's what you leave amen and for that go back to the experience of P go back to the uh the upper room or we neglected those things amen amen and we just thought that God was with us oh no God is still waiting for us where we left him oh we we we call it Pentecostal oh no my brother and sister says this he said from the beginning it wasn't so he preaching many times April 5th 59 25 this kind of cre that we have today his

but don't you go home look for him ask God I remember like Samson once I had your power that I could pray in the midst of the night I was speaking the word and I think come to [Music] pass I could go to bed and dream spiritual things since a certain time I lost that thing I'm coming tonight by your grace that you can show me where I left you and by your grace to give me the courage to turn and go where I left Jesus he is a merciful god he's there waiting for you he want that power that you had once to be restored is there anyone who feel that way in your sincerity just to raise your hand this is the absolute [Music] truth I have left you somewhere through the sacrifice I've made tonight not anyone called me but you did and if it's you hear my [Music] prayer restore me again the dream and vision I used to have that faith I used to have that confidence I had may God bless you God bless each one of you as we bow our head precious Heavenly Father what a message it was a due a message in a due season very simple talking about Joseph and Mary like a little story they went not paying attention to Jesus but it was your grace to bring that to their attention that after three days journey where is Jesus and Jesus is nowhere else but exactly where you left they left him we are not Joseph we are not Mary we are who we are let the lesson of Joseph and Mary Inspire some to examine own life we don't want to have a historical [Music] God oh back then we did this we felt this we saw this our prayers were so powerful going to the throne of Mercy but today even when I pray in my deep conscience I realize that my prayer is going nowhere because Jesus is not present Lord in this time of restoration speak to somebody tonight even where we are [Music] standing to indicate what happened where we left him and go back he's always [Music] available and when each one of us will do that we will have a restor church an Apostolic [Music] church every time we will be gathering each one of us will bring him in this [Music] Temple and we will be United with him together and where he is the supernatural will be forgiveness of [Music] sin Deliverance healing repentance feeling and
