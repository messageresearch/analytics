[19:51] offering you Heavenly Father we want to
[19:53] thank you this evening for your grace
[19:55] and your mercy we thank you Father God
[19:57] for bringing us into your house tonight
[19:59] Lord we know now many people have this
[20:02] opportunity father God but you allows us
[20:04] you allowed us to meet here just because
[20:06] of your love and because of your grace I
[20:08] want to thank you for that Lord your
[20:10] children have brought Titan offerings
[20:12] into your house my prayers father guys
[20:15] that you bless them with father God you
[20:17] bless their jobs whether you bless
[20:18] everything that they're doing Lord and
[20:20] those that couldn't bring anything
[20:22] father God that you bless them so that
[20:24] next time they can be able to do so they
[20:26] will ask father God at this moment as we
[20:28] live everything into holy hand in Jesus
[20:31] Christ's name we pray amen
[20:35] [Music]
[20:38] just a slab of God
[20:41] [Music]
[21:10] you watch man
[21:15] [Music]
[21:21] [Music]
[21:43] [Music]
[21:51] [Music]
[22:45] my sin
[22:48] [Music]
[22:57] [Music]
[23:50] we're not going to listen to the Word of
[23:52] God shall we stand everything old time
[23:55] religion
[23:59] [Music]
[26:13] [Music]
[27:21] yes Father we just sing we want to
[27:26] continue talking about your kingdom
[27:28] that's the reason why we have come
[27:31] tonight Oh God
[27:33] to give ourselves to you so that you can
[27:36] have the portion of the day for our soul
[27:39] Lord as we live these last days father
[27:43] we know they're going away and the
[27:46] sacred of the bride is very close does
[27:50] the reason why Lord we don't want to be
[27:53] left behind under the influence of
[27:56] Laodicea but to be completely under the
[27:59] influence of heaven as we live the last
[28:03] days father the two powers hell and
[28:07] heaven ever visited the earth so father
[28:10] to influence human being politics
[28:14] religion social and everything we are
[28:19] coming under the blood that you did shed
[28:22] on the course so that father you can
[28:25] cover each one of your children with
[28:29] your precious blood so that that blood
[28:32] can stand between each one of us and the
[28:36] influence of the world or the influence
[28:39] of the world is so powerful even closer
[28:43] to your influence but only for the sake
[28:48] of the elected father heaven will not
[28:52] let us be destroyed with the world we
[28:55] thank you for your message
[28:57] we thank you for your prophet we thank
[29:01] you for giving us a shelter where we can
[29:04] come under and be influenced by the word
[29:09] coming from above bless your children
[29:11] tonight be with us father guide and
[29:15] direct us in whatever you want Astrid
[29:17] speak take control of our mouth take on
[29:21] to all of our feeling take control of
[29:24] your people's
[29:25] and heels so that we can hear from above
[29:28] all for your Glory's sake we ask and pay
[29:31] in Jesus mighty name amen you may be
[29:36] seated
[29:37] may God bless you we are gonna continue
[29:42] with what we started on Sunday I don't
[29:49] want to make it like a long serie of
[29:55] teaching on influence because I have in
[30:02] mind something different to start
[30:06] teaching on I know we can preach but
[30:13] also teaching is something special so we
[30:21] will be looking for the days to come to
[30:25] have a teaching on the 7 church ages
[30:31] that will be God willing the coming
[30:36] month the month of September October
[30:40] toward the end God willing we will
[30:44] resume and go without the seven church
[30:48] ages which I believe is gonna be like a
[30:53] starting bridge for may be deeper
[31:00] teachings such as these seals the seven
[31:04] seals
[31:04] I realize also there are some people who
[31:08] have been in the message they can just
[31:11] hear preachers touching here touching
[31:15] there about the seals but without a
[31:20] complete understanding of what those
[31:23] seals are about and not only to have the
[31:27] knowledge what these seals are about but
[31:30] to see what was the promise for the aged
[31:34] and out of the seal
[31:36] when I have impact on the life of the
[31:40] believers so that the reason why as I
[31:43] said I'm gonna be brief on this subject
[31:47] of influence there are so many tapes
[31:52] brought up on um preach on influences
[31:57] even though it's the same subject but
[32:00] you know you can take the same subject
[32:03] called
[32:04] ten preachers you will hear different
[32:06] aspect of it so even from the same
[32:09] preacher you ask him to preach the same
[32:11] thing tomorrow certainly there will be
[32:16] input and output so that like the same
[32:20] with the Prophet when he preached
[32:23] influences you will see some tapes just
[32:27] 70 minutes some tapes over 100 minutes
[32:31] so that's how the spirit leads and based
[32:39] on the need of the audience so from last
[32:44] Sunday I did Title II they thinks that
[32:49] influence our life going with this
[32:54] summary from last Sunday we outline
[32:58] three major things the first category
[33:01] are regarding the things we are born
[33:04] with and those are things that influence
[33:07] our everything our way of thinking our
[33:12] way of acting our behavior our character
[33:17] that those things don't depend on you
[33:21] and on me
[33:23] it's just what God has said that's the
[33:26] reason why everyone has different
[33:28] fingerprint everyone is born on a
[33:32] certain date everyone has a different
[33:35] name everyone as a is born under
[33:39] different sign and people studying the
[33:43] zodiac they will tell you they are 12
[33:46] signs in the zodiac we
[33:49] compared with the 12 months of the year
[33:52] showing that every month every day every
[33:55] hour people being born people also dying
[33:59] so depending on which day under which
[34:05] sign you were born you may have the
[34:09] influence from just that nature and we
[34:13] say that the name that was given to us
[34:16] at the time of birth as brother Bonham
[34:19] said regarding the Evo's mother he said
[34:22] notice those it was murder in their
[34:25] labor in their pain when they start
[34:27] giving delivery giving birth to the
[34:30] child each one was giving a during their
[34:34] labor screaming and whatever they have
[34:37] speak was determining where the child
[34:40] will be whether this tribe will be but
[34:44] all of this it's not because it's by
[34:48] chance but it's a defense preordained by
[34:51] God himself so beside the thing we are
[34:55] born with we being born we inherit and
[35:00] the thing that we inherit is not only
[35:03] coming from your dad and your mom
[35:06] because your dad and your mom is coming
[35:09] also from your grandpa grandma and they
[35:12] have siblings like sisters and brothers
[35:16] so all of these things being a part of a
[35:20] certain family also have influence on
[35:24] human being a character so that's why
[35:27] you can see a child may not be looking
[35:31] like his biologic dad or biologic mom
[35:34] but may be looking like a relative in
[35:37] the family and not only the physical
[35:40] look but also the impact of the
[35:43] character so that's showing us it's a
[35:45] very very big when you get into the
[35:49] understanding of a personality so we are
[35:53] very very different and that's even the
[35:56] reason you can have two people from the
[36:00] same dad and the same mom you will see
[36:02] one looking like my dad and the other
[36:05] one looking like more mom and maybe
[36:08] another one looking like a grandpa
[36:10] grandma or uncle auntie etc so about all
[36:16] these things the two first categories
[36:18] there is nothing really we can do about
[36:21] now the third category is the category
[36:24] of environment so depending on where you
[36:29] will be growing up the type of school
[36:32] you will be doing the type of profession
[36:36] you take one certain person like myself
[36:39] if I was a medical doctor just the fact
[36:46] that I will go to medical school
[36:48] studying there maybe the human being it
[36:51] will change have impact on my
[36:54] personality being an accountant
[36:57] it will change also your personality
[37:00] because it will be more sensitive to
[37:03] numbers and so forth and that's how we
[37:07] see all this character if I want to
[37:12] blend them with marriage it will bring
[37:15] another aspect because this is how even
[37:18] a man and a woman are supposed to be put
[37:22] together because when God in his economy
[37:26] has predestinated a wife for him and God
[37:30] ever both of them in his mind and the
[37:34] way marriage is bringing them to become
[37:37] one God is looking perfection in
[37:40] marriage so that they can be happy so
[37:43] what the man doesn't have God will put
[37:46] it in the husband and vice versa that's
[37:49] why you see certain couple the life is a
[37:54] very smooth because when they come to
[37:57] recognize each one's a position each one
[38:01] what they need to do you will see their
[38:03] life is going to be easier and you take
[38:06] this couple compared with another couple
[38:08] things may not work exactly the same way
[38:12] are you with me
[38:16] so this is really very very deep subject
[38:20] to go because that resort the the
[38:24] character that will put the people
[38:27] together to live I sometimes look at my
[38:30] own relationship with my wife even
[38:35] though you don't say much but you can
[38:39] see in a reality that without her I will
[38:44] not be complete because there are things
[38:47] that I'm a man but I have a lot of
[38:50] limitations I'm the kind of man I don't
[38:53] know how to cook I don't know how even
[39:00] to fix a bedroom if it only depends on
[39:05] me my bedroom the position of the bed
[39:10] can stay there for use I will not bother
[39:15] to change it to but God has given me a
[39:18] wife who after certain time Sammy Jo
[39:21] come here let's put they change the
[39:23] position here the only thing I come I
[39:25] notice I feel it good but to have the
[39:29] initiative to do it brother I have more
[39:32] in my head than that and I believe in
[39:35] every couple that's the way it works
[39:37] regardless of how I can be busy her own
[39:41] bills if I say you pay the bills on time
[39:46] it will be a disaster
[39:48] she will skip oh I forgot you find out
[39:51] penalty and so forth but certain people
[39:54] they are very very organized in the way
[39:58] when I know I have a bill when I know I
[40:01] have to travel blood I don't sleep just
[40:04] I cannot sleep I can set an alarm clock
[40:07] but I work better than an alarm clock
[40:10] sometimes I travel I'm in the hotel home
[40:13] I have to catch a flight earlier and
[40:15] sometimes they hotel they forgot to set
[40:19] up the alarm clock and but I am always
[40:22] up maybe two o'clock in the morning to
[40:25] be ready etc so
[40:27] learning all this aspect of life brother
[40:30] it's not something that you should take
[40:33] lightly
[40:34] because you have to know yourself to
[40:37] know your strengths to know your
[40:39] weakness and those things will help you
[40:42] also to interact with others if you
[40:46] don't know you will always have a
[40:48] problem conflict why I expected you to
[40:51] do this I expected you to do that and
[40:53] the same way we have to come to learn
[40:56] the same aspect with our children and I
[41:00] have a five children they are completely
[41:02] completely different different
[41:06] regardless of how you deal with them
[41:09] whatever you do you will notice that
[41:11] this one can approach you in a way
[41:14] fearless the other one you know a little
[41:18] bit reserved the other one careless so
[41:21] all of these they are part of God's
[41:25] economy and we praise God as also his
[41:28] children being in the century being in
[41:31] the church this is how God want to see
[41:34] us when we some among us when they have
[41:38] needs they cry some they do this some
[41:42] day first we cannot copy one another and
[41:46] it will never work exactly with their
[41:49] children sometimes I give my own
[41:51] testimony I talk to myself today I can
[41:57] be with julia julia has been very very
[42:00] helpful to me think that he/she does no
[42:04] one else can do in the family I work
[42:07] with Julia in the office sometimes we
[42:10] don't have papers for the business we
[42:13] don't have with food with no evidence
[42:15] she can even take her own money to go
[42:18] buy but don't talk about hope hope come
[42:22] to the office to eat and you have to buy
[42:26] for her and hope will tell you daddy
[42:29] don't pay me this much I need this much
[42:31] which Julia never all this time
[42:36] never it's my own discretion
[42:39] I say Julia here your paycheck ah that
[42:42] you would have increased this much thank
[42:44] you she bows they are all the same
[42:48] parent but different personalities and
[42:51] this is how even ourselves as a children
[42:54] of God we need to know where we stand
[42:58] and even when you get to marriage you
[43:01] have to understand how to interact with
[43:03] the spouse and even in the church how to
[43:07] deal with one another because all these
[43:09] things are very important to influence
[43:13] one character your character depends
[43:16] when we talk what a bottom talk about
[43:18] environment environment is everything
[43:21] everyday we interact with not knowing
[43:24] all this detail will point you to a lot
[43:27] of troubles you will be complaining you
[43:30] will be dissatisfied you cannot be happy
[43:33] why because you have the lack of
[43:37] understanding of the people of the
[43:40] environment you are facing so I will
[43:44] leave it up to you to go a little bit
[43:49] more if you want to spend time or to
[43:51] play God so that God can help you assess
[43:54] your own better understanding of your
[43:57] environment so for tonight I will just
[44:03] continue from where we left off so last
[44:06] Sunday I talked about the three things
[44:08] the things that influence our lives and
[44:10] I did not have a chance to get into the
[44:14] specific world of spirit so tonight I'm
[44:18] going to talk about the influence of the
[44:20] Spirit so each person has a spirit if
[44:30] each person has a spirit each house has
[44:33] a spirit each couple has a spirit the
[44:38] church as a spirit the nation has a
[44:41] spirit the world has a spirit so if we
[44:46] don't pay attention
[44:48] we don't under
[44:49] ten they spirit under which we are under
[44:53] we are not going to know how to react
[44:56] and out walk so as we stand for the sake
[45:00] of respect for the reading of the word
[45:05] opening our Bibles in the Book of Amos
[45:09] chapter three reading the first three
[45:15] verses a most three the Bible says this
[45:24] here this word that the Lord has spoken
[45:28] against you O children of Israel against
[45:32] the whole family which I brought up from
[45:35] the land of Egypt saying you only have I
[45:41] known of all the families of the earth
[45:44] God said I don't know only families but
[45:47] you you defeat my people I know you and
[45:51] I want to emphasize everything I have
[45:55] based on you therefore I will punish you
[45:59] for all your iniquities can two walk
[46:05] together except they be agreed can two
[46:10] walk together except they be agreed
[46:14] may the Lord are the blessings to the
[46:16] reading of the scripture may be seated
[46:20] so based on this scripture are speaking
[46:25] about different type of influence I want
[46:33] to take the first coat
[46:43] I'm a skit that just to go slowly but
[46:50] for the sake that these things can enter
[46:52] so I want to stack the first coat from
[46:56] the message first thing for life testing
[47:05] for life going to paragraph 29 and this
[47:13] is very important because dealing with
[47:16] one another dealing with responsive
[47:19] dealing with a child dealing with a
[47:21] brother sisters to come to realize how
[47:26] your life your character can be
[47:30] influenced by others you have to have
[47:33] the understanding of the other person
[47:37] spirit that's very very helpful from
[47:44] paragraph 29 brother Bonham said I was
[47:49] saying this the other day and my wife
[47:53] sitting back here listening at me we are
[47:57] going to a store to get some groceries a
[48:00] few weeks ago and right in that winter
[48:05] time we seen a lady with them little
[48:08] bitty clothes on so during the middle of
[48:12] the winter where people are supposed to
[48:15] cover themselves but they notice there
[48:17] is a lady with little bitty clothes on
[48:22] short clothes with little sweater around
[48:25] her my wife said you know she cannot be
[48:29] comfortable like that because of the
[48:32] season well we got to talking about it I
[48:37] said honey when I go when I go to
[48:42] Germany I find I said she is just an
[48:46] American that's all and I said when I go
[48:49] to Germany they have the German spirit
[48:54] national spirit brother you can even
[48:58] assess yourself every country you ever
[49:01] visited there is a different spirit so
[49:07] even the country we are in it's a
[49:10] different spirit and the problem
[49:13] sometimes in dealing with different
[49:15] spirit us believers we don't understand
[49:18] each other there is a saying in our
[49:25] culture Lingala or French they said when
[49:28] you go to a country you find the people
[49:31] dancing with one leg dance also with one
[49:33] leg that's a literal translation
[49:37] Manappuram of dopamine a local one so
[49:40] that make it sound like this is the way
[49:44] to act but it is not anything that is
[49:48] not the Word of God is not gonna succeed
[49:51] they don't they say you go you find us
[49:54] the acting like this you must act like
[49:57] us so that we cannot be in conflict
[50:00] that's all they are worried about but
[50:03] prophet Branham said well do the walls
[50:06] come from because every nation has a
[50:10] spirit every country has a spirit now
[50:13] was arise when one country is not
[50:17] accepting the culture or the spirit of
[50:21] the other nation and that's the same way
[50:24] we are going to end up with a lot of
[50:27] wars in the house if the husband doesn't
[50:30] accept the spirit of the wife and the
[50:32] wife doesn't accept the spirit of the
[50:34] husband and the same way in the church
[50:38] that's why Jesus said Branham said Jesus
[50:43] first doctrine he must be born again
[50:47] once you are born again we all become
[50:51] under the same spirit so let's continue
[50:56] just so natural spirit when I got to
[51:00] fill it they have the finished spirit
[51:03] when I going to see them they have the
[51:06] sweetest spirit
[51:07] when we go to Africa ah they have the
[51:13] African spirit when we come to America
[51:15] they have the American spirit so to say
[51:19] that everywhere they have their own
[51:22] spirit and let me tell you all the
[51:25] spirits of the nations is from the devil
[51:30] there is no nation that can be set as an
[51:35] example with its politic its socialized
[51:39] its economy
[51:40] there is none so therefore we have to
[51:45] look for a nation we have to look for a
[51:49] country where there is the best example
[51:53] of influence of the people in the
[51:58] message Victory Day what a bottom
[52:03] continue paragraph 88 Victory Day Park
[52:13] of 88 so therefore brother we came from
[52:17] Africa either you born here from an
[52:20] America there is no spirit to take you
[52:25] have to die to your spirit and you have
[52:28] to die to the American spirit and take
[52:31] the Christian spirit and after you take
[52:34] that spirit let the rest of your life be
[52:37] under that only Ghost spirit because you
[52:41] can now in summary regardless of our
[52:45] they think we are born with distinct we
[52:48] inherit and the things of our
[52:50] development we have to remain either
[52:53] under the influence of heaven or the
[52:56] influence of him both of 88 now we find
[53:02] that it breaks up the fellowship of whom
[53:05] it breaks up the fellowship of churches
[53:09] it breaks up the fellowship of nation
[53:12] that same things now but I am now
[53:16] getting to detail what is it nations
[53:19] wants to see
[53:21] their own way not only nation people
[53:26] people I want thing to be conducted the
[53:30] way I see it to the extent they don't
[53:35] want to have the influence of the Holy
[53:38] Spirit the way the Holy Spirit wanted
[53:41] but they want their own way I want to
[53:45] enter if this I want this to be done
[53:48] this way I want you to be like this
[53:51] brother no one is the maker of another
[53:54] one so nations want to see their own way
[54:01] Germany want to see their way alone
[54:04] Russia wants to see the way alone
[54:08] America wants to see her way alone see
[54:12] dancy that's it it's the spirit of the
[54:16] nations you find it wherever you go you
[54:21] find a national spirit when I went to I
[54:25] left the Congo before I came to America
[54:28] I spent a whole year in another African
[54:32] country boondi I was the preaching in
[54:37] the church I don't want to go in more
[54:42] detail but when I came there I find the
[54:45] pastor say pastor where are we going to
[54:50] church on Sunday we say no there is no
[54:53] more church to go I say what's going on
[54:56] now I add a church but finally all the
[55:01] believers they were hypocrite and we
[55:04] shut down the church it was a powerful
[55:08] statement sometimes brother with the
[55:13] behavior of the people you can push a
[55:16] minister to do certain action so the
[55:20] pastor was so tired and he said finish I
[55:23] say no but we cannot go like this he
[55:28] told me I know you were a pastor in
[55:30] Congo if you want to take over take over
[55:33] but I'm done
[55:34] I say I'm not gonna do anything but I
[55:37] want you to reopen the church whatever
[55:41] it takes
[55:41] so with him we went to visit all the
[55:45] believers talking to them talking to
[55:47] them afterward they came back and the
[55:51] pastor said you take the church in Chad
[55:53] I said no I did not come here to Pastor
[55:55] your church you remain the pastor if you
[55:58] want me to help you with the preaching
[55:59] that's what I'm gonna do and so we said
[56:03] that how we did I was helping him but
[56:10] the national spirit the people from
[56:16] Burundi they are not like Congolese when
[56:20] you deal with them they tell you you
[56:21] come beliefs you are not smart
[56:23] why do you express your emotion easily
[56:27] here we don't express emotions you know
[56:31] Congolese when there is somebody dead in
[56:34] the family I can come I cry publicly
[56:36] I've all over over there they don't do
[56:39] that
[56:40] you have to show our strong personality
[56:44] you have so my husband I might also ever
[56:49] die when people come I want to show them
[56:53] my personality that I'm a strong person
[56:55] by not crying but it's hard but it's
[57:00] national and you lose you see them they
[57:04] don't if really they want to cry they go
[57:06] on a side maybe in the bedroom they cry
[57:07] they come up like nothing happened
[57:10] therefore that have a impact even in the
[57:14] church
[57:15] you preach there I don't know if things
[57:17] have changed you push that nobody says
[57:19] Amen when it's get into more detail
[57:22] digested my messages started on I
[57:28] preached them a serie of the national
[57:32] spirit it was really breaking breaking
[57:36] breaking until you see the nature of the
[57:41] Christian being different from the
[57:42] nation and when I was living to come to
[57:46] America one cyst I never
[57:48] forget he said brother you helped us so
[57:52] much we were like bananas without
[57:57] identity but we thank God but this is to
[58:01] say every nation has a spirit we can
[58:05] talk even not only nation within the
[58:08] nation like the Congolese you can see
[58:12] the communist when a boon diem does
[58:14] something hey I'm going to beat you I'm
[58:16] gonna beat you don't talk just look at
[58:20] this these guys is stupid
[58:22] why do you expose yourself so if the
[58:24] enemy can know how you think
[58:26] damn they don't do that they are just
[58:30] quiet you inserted him but the day he
[58:33] got you that's your death at a spot
[58:37] where you cannot move so that's a
[58:40] national spirit but the Congolese beside
[58:43] that Congolese is about showing off
[58:47] normally in the pocket deep we turn like
[58:49] they have a lot the way they talk the
[58:52] way they show of international spirit
[58:54] therefore when the gospel the message
[58:57] come is as to every impact influence on
[59:01] your life but you cannot have influence
[59:05] over you if you don't recognize and
[59:07] accept your mistakes that there is a
[59:12] spirit over me but if you don't
[59:14] recognize that there is a spirit you
[59:17] anything that you have the word you have
[59:19] the Holy Ghost now the only ghost has
[59:21] gone to make us one people one spirit
[59:25] one Accord and that's why you see
[59:30] sometimes brother branham preaching you
[59:34] know what abana used to use a certain
[59:37] natural example he said when we go to
[59:40] the restaurant you can eat this I can it
[59:43] is this when we come to the bones what
[59:46] do we do we just eat the meat and put
[59:49] the meat aside the bones inside this is
[59:53] how to show that we have to tolerate one
[59:56] another to accept one another but us
[59:59] that's not the case
[1:00:01] if I eat this kind of food everybody has
[1:00:05] to eat it that's where the problems come
[1:00:09] and breaks our families breaks our
[1:00:13] churches breaks everything so to
[1:00:15] continue if a brother branham here
[1:00:17] he said you find it wherever you go
[1:00:21] you'll find a national spirit I went in
[1:00:24] and they have different ways it's
[1:00:26] strange
[1:00:28] if I had the time I would just like to
[1:00:31] skip through some of the nations and
[1:00:33] show you so they are he can show you by
[1:00:37] nation what is really dominating
[1:00:42] paragraph 90 when you go in you go into
[1:00:47] Germany you find a military spirit
[1:00:50] everything is military you know the
[1:00:55] history of Germany with Adolf Hitler the
[1:00:59] only thing he had in mind was to make
[1:01:02] Germany very strong and dominate over
[1:01:07] everybody and he went to conquer every
[1:01:11] country etc and during their conquer
[1:01:14] they went to fight
[1:01:16] France they fight they weren't even to
[1:01:19] Belgium this is where they got the
[1:01:21] expression media cut OSA the Germany the
[1:01:25] German army was a Belgium in two hours
[1:01:29] belch Belgium did not fight and they
[1:01:31] caused it from noon to two media ketosis
[1:01:35] when they say sheriff is the media
[1:01:37] ketosis that's exactly what the German
[1:01:40] have done to the Belgium to our it's a
[1:01:44] small country to our foreign or - to
[1:01:47] Belgium Finnish they went on so that's
[1:01:52] based on that on the spirit that was on
[1:01:55] the leader that has impacted the entire
[1:01:59] nation you have a leader based on
[1:02:03] corruption no wonder Congo is under what
[1:02:10] they are and they call corruption
[1:02:12] cooperation
[1:02:14] and in the spirit of the nation you put
[1:02:17] somebody with a certain logical plan to
[1:02:20] put the thing in order
[1:02:22] the Salem vicuna um Tobin sambucol
[1:02:25] that'd national spirit intensive really
[1:02:29] a revival from the Holy Ghost to change
[1:02:32] those people so that's the military
[1:02:36] spirit you have to stand straight walk
[1:02:40] straight cut your corners and everything
[1:02:43] it's a military bog of 91 you go into
[1:02:47] face you find any immoral spirit just
[1:02:51] women and wine and liquor and stuff like
[1:02:55] that see you go into Finland you find a
[1:03:00] lawyer' spirit kind of like everything
[1:03:04] is honest we must pay off everything for
[1:03:10] their nation the national spirit not
[1:03:13] paying your debt is a shame so everybody
[1:03:17] respect they think of the the government
[1:03:21] etc everything is in order
[1:03:23] our people who have been in the Congo
[1:03:25] recently I was surprised in Kinshasa
[1:03:29] people also lining up to get into the
[1:03:32] bus I was looking as it does not scream
[1:03:34] just I knew Contessa everybody in the
[1:03:37] corner just the Basques up if I can grab
[1:03:40] the window I get him catch my seat and
[1:03:43] so forth but you know a country like
[1:03:48] this one
[1:03:50] everything was line up and you know when
[1:03:54] even if you have the Holy Ghost now let
[1:03:58] me pause it here even if you have the
[1:04:01] Holy Ghost your only ghost must help you
[1:04:05] realize and recognize the spirit of the
[1:04:08] country if it's a tool only ghost
[1:04:10] otherwise you will see people with the
[1:04:14] Holy Ghost but because of the influence
[1:04:16] of the place they are living in you will
[1:04:20] not be surprised somebody with the Holy
[1:04:22] Ghost is student going to university the
[1:04:25] bus stops he jump on the way
[1:04:28] to sit quietly he did not insult anybody
[1:04:32] he did not do anything wrong but that's
[1:04:34] national spirit it's not a problem
[1:04:36] because he was born and found the habit
[1:04:39] he's that doing this mom doing this
[1:04:41] everybody doing it so it's not a shame
[1:04:43] anymore
[1:04:47] paragraph 93 you go into America you
[1:04:53] find a big hahahahahaha what that's what
[1:04:58] it is
[1:04:59] yay that's American spirit somebody
[1:05:03] tells a dirty joke on the radio and
[1:05:06] everybody loves edit Ernie for those are
[1:05:10] the people from the time or some of them
[1:05:12] cracking jokes that they have you know
[1:05:15] everywhere Arthur Godfrey and that group
[1:05:21] like that that's American spirit you
[1:05:24] find that you find it that way now
[1:05:28] paragraph 94 Burnham now say and then
[1:05:34] does spirit get jealous of another
[1:05:38] spirit so now everybody has a spirit not
[1:05:44] only nation but the people each
[1:05:47] individual each church each group each
[1:05:50] person under as a certain spirit and
[1:05:54] does the spirit they become also jealous
[1:05:57] with another spirit that's where the
[1:06:00] problems are they husband spirit may be
[1:06:04] jealous against the wife and vice versa
[1:06:06] etcetera you go to church you find
[1:06:08] everybody getting in a certain way then
[1:06:11] a certain spirit that we come the spirit
[1:06:14] dominant of the church and what do they
[1:06:20] do they cause war that's right now you
[1:06:26] see every nation is controlled by Satan
[1:06:33] so all the national spirit the bottom
[1:06:37] line is certain behind
[1:06:41] that's why as I'm upbringing this the
[1:06:46] purpose is not just to know what the
[1:06:49] spirit are doing but to be born again
[1:06:55] until you get really born again whether
[1:06:58] those things will always have impact
[1:07:02] over your life and weave the things
[1:07:05] whether it's going to draw you down and
[1:07:08] you cannot overcome you cannot live a
[1:07:11] good Christian life because of
[1:07:13] influences skipping to powder of 96 let
[1:07:27] me finish 95 the Bible said so he's the
[1:07:31] god of the nation's talking about Satan
[1:07:34] Satan took Jesus up top the mountain and
[1:07:37] said show him all the kingdoms was in
[1:07:41] the world or the kingdom in a moment of
[1:07:44] time said these are mine I do with them
[1:07:51] anything I want to and brother Bonham
[1:07:54] said somewhere well Satan said all of
[1:07:57] this is mine
[1:07:58] brother Branham said Jesus never
[1:08:00] contradict him read the Bible Jesus
[1:08:06] never said no say that it's not you it's
[1:08:08] mine
[1:08:09] jesus knew that he can claim this until
[1:08:14] my kingdom with the new world people
[1:08:17] will be established when he will be tied
[1:08:20] up but love 96 Jesus said get behind me
[1:08:27] Satan he knew he was going to fall he'll
[1:08:30] to them in the Millennium see so he
[1:08:33] didn't have to bow down to him he knowed
[1:08:36] they was going 97 now when God comes
[1:08:42] again and tech makes his kingdom here
[1:08:46] see there will be not there will not be
[1:08:51] any kind of spirit
[1:08:54] a German spirit and the French spirit
[1:08:57] and no venture spirit an American spirit
[1:09:00] an African spirit they won't be that
[1:09:04] there will be one spirit amen the Spirit
[1:09:08] of God living in every heart
[1:09:11] hallelujah so that's the purpose of
[1:09:14] studying those influence so that we can
[1:09:17] get his spirit and be born again this
[1:09:21] way we will be one people under one
[1:09:25] headship the Spirit of God living in
[1:09:31] every heart that's right and there will
[1:09:33] be one flag one nation one people one
[1:09:38] Brotherhood a Fatherhood of God and a
[1:09:42] brotherhood of man sonship yes amen
[1:09:48] toward the end of bag of 98 but a bottom
[1:09:52] said also there is a national spirit
[1:09:55] here a national spirit here
[1:09:58] it's Devils so we cannot be proud saying
[1:10:03] whether this is how people and the
[1:10:07] different influences they don't even
[1:10:10] know and you'll see an African person we
[1:10:14] coming from Africa maybe with the
[1:10:17] African spirit they come here easily
[1:10:20] they don't want to do nothing with
[1:10:23] Africa they want everything to be
[1:10:25] America it's just changing spirit it's
[1:10:30] not taking you any further you are just
[1:10:33] changing the place of acting from an
[1:10:40] African mentality to an American
[1:10:42] mentality American mentality is not
[1:10:45] superior to African mentality they are
[1:10:48] both the same because they are from the
[1:10:51] devil so they think - do you see an
[1:10:55] African person coming from Africa you
[1:10:58] come here even a young boys they want to
[1:11:00] dress in a certain way sag their paint
[1:11:05] poke their ears
[1:11:07] knows and so forth it's just stupidity
[1:11:09] under the same devil even the woman man
[1:11:13] Christian time to add and impersonate
[1:11:16] the world because of influence but we
[1:11:21] thank God there is one word one message
[1:11:25] to bring us in in the message God
[1:11:29] identifying himself by his
[1:11:32] characteristics now we are getting those
[1:11:42] are the broad picture now we get into
[1:11:45] the church the Spirit of God can be
[1:11:52] identified by its characteristics by
[1:11:55] well characteristic see the Spirit of
[1:11:58] God and the spirit of the church there
[1:12:01] is a church spirit and a spirit of God
[1:12:06] that's absolutely not like the church
[1:12:09] spirit at all so it's not because you
[1:12:13] are in the church that you get a spirit
[1:12:15] of God no not necessary because in the
[1:12:19] church they are many individual this
[1:12:22] individual has a spirit if the spirit of
[1:12:25] individual can influence your spirit
[1:12:29] even being in the church you are under
[1:12:32] the same nation under the same devil
[1:12:35] that's why brother you come to church to
[1:12:39] look for your personal relationship with
[1:12:43] God not relationship with one another
[1:12:47] and that's the problem with the people
[1:12:50] they find a favour of people I want to
[1:12:54] do like so-and-so I want to act like so
[1:12:57] and so when so-and-so as an issue like
[1:12:59] this I'm going to follow and when
[1:13:01] showing so say I don't like this I don't
[1:13:03] like that also if they say I like it I
[1:13:06] like it also that's where all this cause
[1:13:09] of problems are because people have come
[1:13:12] to church they did not get the Spirit of
[1:13:16] God they have get a spirit of people in
[1:13:18] the church and
[1:13:19] what is leading them now you get a
[1:13:22] spirit of a man in a church it's going
[1:13:25] to take you to hell let the nation's
[1:13:28] until you come to be born again die to
[1:13:32] your spirit and receive the spirit of
[1:13:34] christ the way jesus said he must be
[1:13:38] born again
[1:13:40] not even the spirit of the pastor not
[1:13:43] even the spirit of the bishop
[1:13:45] not-not-not know you are called to
[1:13:48] receive the Spirit of Christ but that's
[1:13:55] why on this subject of influence we can
[1:13:59] go on and on and on you see the people
[1:14:02] in the church even ladies she can be a
[1:14:06] nice lady dressing in a certain way but
[1:14:09] let there be a certain woman dressing
[1:14:14] fashion in a certain way they look they
[1:14:17] look they look after why they copy where
[1:14:23] this is coming from this is just the
[1:14:27] spirit getting one another spirit no
[1:14:31] wonder you can see you can watch people
[1:14:37] the way they live the people to the
[1:14:40] extent the people in the church become
[1:14:42] more comfortable we've seen because it's
[1:14:46] part of so-and-so life as government
[1:14:49] survey said directors important people
[1:14:57] become to the extent they become very
[1:14:59] comfortable you are preventing me from
[1:15:03] doing this
[1:15:04] but you did not see sister so and so
[1:15:07] she's the pastor's wife she's the
[1:15:10] pastor's daughter she's the minister's
[1:15:12] she's even going with men the same way
[1:15:15] brother we are not coming to get one
[1:15:19] another spirit each person as a spirit
[1:15:23] but your duty is to be under the
[1:15:26] influence of heaven this way you detect
[1:15:29] the spirit of other people and
[1:15:32] if you have the Holy Ghost the only boss
[1:15:34] is gonna lead you always under they need
[1:15:36] the influence of God you see some people
[1:15:41] they have no backbone at all I call it
[1:15:45] no backbone at all wake up in the
[1:15:50] morning it's a Sunday and then their
[1:15:54] husband saying I'm a little bit tired
[1:15:55] I'm not going to go oh you are not going
[1:15:57] to go me also I mean it's so simple very
[1:16:01] simple those little stupid example but
[1:16:05] it means a lot
[1:16:07] do those means just the influence under
[1:16:09] which people are living Delhi Delhi
[1:16:13] every decision under influence I have to
[1:16:22] keep some of these to push it a little
[1:16:26] bit on Sunday people are copying one
[1:16:31] another spirit brother if you study with
[1:16:34] your method you study yourself I rather
[1:16:37] be myself and my own influence either
[1:16:42] I'm wrong all right but never to
[1:16:44] impersonate anybody never to copy one
[1:16:48] another spirit because brother if I go
[1:16:52] more in depth you will be surprised
[1:16:55] maybe the person you are paddling after
[1:16:58] do you know that person really can be a
[1:17:03] magician a sorcerer witchcraft and
[1:17:07] that's what you are serving yourself as
[1:17:09] an example you are fooling yourself
[1:17:14] that's why my prayer is I want each one
[1:17:18] of us to recognize they think that
[1:17:22] influence your personality your
[1:17:25] character and staying with God and God
[1:17:28] alone God is not in the spirit of groups
[1:17:32] oh my group my group our group and
[1:17:37] sometimes the group get also a certain
[1:17:41] spirit
[1:17:43] and they have somebody in the group who
[1:17:47] is more influence was more influenced to
[1:17:50] influence others one day you can set up
[1:17:53] and say I don't like the pastor I don't
[1:17:56] like that the preacher I don't like the
[1:17:57] butcher and everybody will do the same
[1:17:59] oh man
[1:18:01] God have mercy that's why but when I'm
[1:18:07] said in the message God is your life
[1:18:12] worthy of the gospel he said the Holy
[1:18:14] Ghost is not accessible where everybody
[1:18:18] come and dump the garbage they stuff in
[1:18:22] and you see people taking it easily
[1:18:26] somebody can know that my I'm not a
[1:18:30] Christian I am NOT going to go to heaven
[1:18:33] they know and our purpose now is to pull
[1:18:37] as many people as they can that's why
[1:18:40] you watch their behavior their action
[1:18:42] their conversation nothing positive
[1:18:45] always negative about somebody always
[1:18:49] negative about something and they will
[1:18:53] never come to appreciate anything
[1:18:55] regardless of what and that as a
[1:18:58] significant influence if you don't come
[1:19:04] to recognize it you are going to perish
[1:19:07] that's why the Word of God has called us
[1:19:10] to be more mature Christian under the
[1:19:14] influence of heaven with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:22] so Branham said there is a church spirit
[1:19:27] and the Spirit of God that's absolutely
[1:19:31] not like the church spirit at all and
[1:19:34] then he said there is a denominational
[1:19:38] spirit what is a denominational spirit
[1:19:44] the denominational spirit in the last
[1:19:47] day there is a denominational spirit
[1:19:51] denominational spirit is not because you
[1:19:54] ever put the name
[1:19:56] on the church you know when the message
[1:19:59] came first we were calling or if you
[1:20:03] notice all the churches in the past we
[1:20:06] used to call them assembly with the name
[1:20:09] of the city assembly the beginning
[1:20:13] assembly the básico assembly day it was
[1:20:17] assembly assembly why the first
[1:20:20] conception of the people it was to avoid
[1:20:23] denomination when you put a certain era
[1:20:27] that's denomination that's a name until
[1:20:30] people start realizing that there is a
[1:20:32] church called the Branham Tabernacle
[1:20:36] when I'm tabernacle and then they change
[1:20:41] from assemblies to everything now until
[1:20:44] today is doubly job Anaka
[1:20:52] until we ever finished all the name in
[1:20:56] the message we finish all the name in
[1:20:59] the Bible and recently when I was in the
[1:21:02] Congo I found out there is a tabernacle
[1:21:05] call Branham and meda tabernacle
[1:21:08] I tell brother obeyed take me I want to
[1:21:10] see the tabernacle to show you that
[1:21:15] better people have gone far with
[1:21:17] tabernacle there is no name left you
[1:21:22] will called Zoe Tabernacle they will say
[1:21:24] so a table a map in which my Zoe
[1:21:26] dominating just a suitable dragon face
[1:21:28] so in the same name you talk about
[1:21:31] shallow tabernacle Shalom to vinegar
[1:21:34] Shalom to vinegar shalom Davina and time
[1:21:36] acceptable and demonstrably anti-missile
[1:21:39] everywhere so therefore people are tired
[1:21:41] now let's go to something new
[1:21:44] maida and Branham Tabernacle something
[1:21:49] different
[1:21:50] below basically though this is to show
[1:21:53] that brother it's not the spirit of
[1:21:57] denomination is not by the name you can
[1:22:01] call yourself whatever big Tabernacle
[1:22:04] you know Zoe Israel Goshen
[1:22:07] good name
[1:22:09] in the message but it's not what make
[1:22:11] you special it's not what is going to
[1:22:15] prevent the denominational spirit what
[1:22:18] is the denomination spirit the spirit
[1:22:23] where you have one person having
[1:22:28] influence over others so you come into
[1:22:31] the message church and then you have
[1:22:34] your little group it within the church
[1:22:37] and with that group you have one person
[1:22:39] who have more influence over other
[1:22:42] that's just a denomination spirit and
[1:22:44] the denomination spirit is always
[1:22:48] against the word and they will never
[1:22:53] okay with the word they will always try
[1:22:56] to look you see you see this is not this
[1:22:59] is not its spirit Branham continue there
[1:23:05] is a national spirit there is a spirit
[1:23:08] of the nation every nation where I go
[1:23:13] into you walk in there you find a
[1:23:15] different spirit I think we read this
[1:23:17] I'm gonna skip it a little bit so if
[1:23:25] every nation has a spirit each person
[1:23:28] has a spirit each person and the people
[1:23:32] forming the church the church is form
[1:23:34] with many people with many spirit that's
[1:23:37] why when we pray we have to pray for the
[1:23:41] church pray that God you keep this
[1:23:46] church under your influence and you are
[1:23:50] alone otherwise brother if you don't
[1:23:53] have that understanding tomorrow the
[1:23:57] church all the church they will end up
[1:24:00] getting the spirit even of the pastor
[1:24:02] that's it
[1:24:04] and people to a certain extent they will
[1:24:08] turn and start worshiping the pastor
[1:24:11] they don't say we worship the pastor but
[1:24:13] that's exactly what they are doing and
[1:24:15] which spirit is that it's a death
[1:24:20] that's why I want to love the pasta I
[1:24:23] want to pay for the pasta but I want the
[1:24:26] spirit to be the Spirit of God over my
[1:24:29] life over my influence but what I'm said
[1:24:34] in the message God keeps his word
[1:24:39] part of 79 skipping toward where I have
[1:24:47] highlighted random said I have went in
[1:24:52] the churches and I say this we've
[1:24:55] referenced now I find that many times in
[1:25:00] the church in the churches I believe
[1:25:02] people get one another spirit is dead of
[1:25:07] the Holy Spirit I will the Prophet
[1:25:10] Branham said he fighted many times in
[1:25:13] the churches people going to the church
[1:25:16] instead of getting the Spirit of God the
[1:25:19] Holy Spirit they get one another spirit
[1:25:22] and that one another spirit is
[1:25:24] communicating someone with a certain
[1:25:27] spirit come always trying to influence
[1:25:30] you in the not even word but action and
[1:25:35] that's what you see sometimes people in
[1:25:39] the church they started finding coming
[1:25:42] late is not a problem
[1:25:47] hello
[1:25:51] but anything contrary to the word
[1:25:55] it's what denominations are doing is the
[1:25:58] spirit of the denomination but God sent
[1:26:03] a prophet telling us 30 minutes before
[1:26:06] we have to be there as simple as that
[1:26:11] why people don't do that I know people
[1:26:13] may have a valid excuses where is God
[1:26:15] for it but there are also people to the
[1:26:18] other extreme say ah 7 o'clock this is a
[1:26:22] time they decide to leave home then
[1:26:24] there will be there around seven five
[1:26:27] seven time depending on where they are
[1:26:29] coming for
[1:26:31] and to the a certain extent that become
[1:26:34] normal and you add one abbot upon
[1:26:38] another abbot laying it's become so
[1:26:41] simple so in social is like and you see
[1:26:44] it's just that spirit become so common
[1:26:48] and popular among the people to the
[1:26:51] extent people start grading the level of
[1:26:55] lies they start grading the level of sin
[1:26:59] or if somebody commits adultery that
[1:27:03] pastor has to sit down he has to sit
[1:27:07] down he's not worthy but when the pastor
[1:27:09] is taking all the advantage of the money
[1:27:14] it's not a sin even though Branham said
[1:27:17] watch those three things money women and
[1:27:20] people emphasize only woman if the
[1:27:23] pastor goes with a woman the board will
[1:27:26] be every bidding and say well what a
[1:27:28] bottom said in the sale of a booze if a
[1:27:31] deacon commits adultery they memorize
[1:27:35] even the paragraph that night the past
[1:27:38] is going to tell a dick and not to come
[1:27:40] to church and they will present a
[1:27:42] problem to the church and they will vote
[1:27:44] him out and design appoint another one
[1:27:48] no Scott we know but when it come to
[1:27:51] this people start grading level
[1:27:54] it's not about level it's not about how
[1:27:57] you perceive it it's not what is more
[1:28:00] important to your site but it's what is
[1:28:03] the spirit behind if it's not crisis
[1:28:07] with it everything else is wrong
[1:28:13] continue to read Burnham so I believe
[1:28:16] people get one another spirit is in the
[1:28:19] stead of the Holy Spirit you go into a
[1:28:22] church and watch where the pastor may be
[1:28:26] judge his head the whole congregation
[1:28:28] will do it whether it's what bottom is
[1:28:36] saying is a spiritual there are not many
[1:28:40] people as pastors reject their head but
[1:28:43] what is saying is
[1:28:44] is certain happy to form the pastor and
[1:28:48] everybody will copy the pastor is a
[1:28:53] human being but let his action that is
[1:28:59] only goes to lead influence your life
[1:29:02] but if he does something that is not the
[1:29:05] word you don't need to take it you go
[1:29:12] into the church where the pastor says he
[1:29:15] has got all running from his hand the
[1:29:20] first thing you know the whole company
[1:29:22] believes that and they have it go into a
[1:29:25] church where there is a lot of dancing
[1:29:28] and jumping and running around amen
[1:29:32] if the posture like this type of they
[1:29:37] will do but you know that in general but
[1:29:42] sometimes the same people even if the
[1:29:45] pastor does doesn't like a certain music
[1:29:48] that will sell people they will like
[1:29:49] that music and when there is a constant
[1:29:52] in town you will find them still hello
[1:29:58] did I say something go into a church oh
[1:30:05] no I'm not condemning these things I am
[1:30:08] just speaking from an observation to
[1:30:11] present a point to you is that what the
[1:30:13] Prophet said he's not condemning or you
[1:30:16] go to dance or you have done this I'm
[1:30:18] not condemning but I'm just making a
[1:30:20] point if you will get a posture that's
[1:30:25] very emotional the whole congregation
[1:30:28] will be emotional you get a posture that
[1:30:32] starch and stiff and the whole
[1:30:34] congregation will be starchy and stiff I
[1:30:37] believe you receive each other's spirit
[1:30:43] now two can walk together unless they
[1:30:48] agree when I'm saying it Ferg of 82 take
[1:30:52] a good man
[1:30:54] and a bad woman and put them together
[1:30:57] one will go to the other a man this is
[1:31:03] the absolute truth you take a believer
[1:31:06] you marry them with a non-believer one
[1:31:10] will go the other way
[1:31:12] that's why Branham said under no
[1:31:15] circumstance a believer cannot marry an
[1:31:19] unbeliever because of that scripture he
[1:31:23] will go one way or another way and you
[1:31:27] know very often young people they take
[1:31:30] they simplify the scripture everybody
[1:31:34] going into the marriage I know the man I
[1:31:37] know the woman and they say within
[1:31:39] themselves oh no don't worry I'm gonna
[1:31:42] change him as you are thinking you are
[1:31:44] gonna change him the other person also
[1:31:46] he's thinking about changing you and
[1:31:48] nobody says it openly but you go like
[1:31:51] that and then when you get there they're
[1:31:54] changing battle will start and then he
[1:31:58] will start wondering that the brother
[1:32:01] was a very spiritual brother until until
[1:32:04] he got married that sister that's why
[1:32:09] taking precautions is safe Branham said
[1:32:14] marry somebody who believe exactly like
[1:32:17] you to avoid all these things but very
[1:32:21] often we have other motives other
[1:32:26] influence
[1:32:27] it's an influence because so-and-so has
[1:32:31] been married I have to be married but is
[1:32:34] it the time everybody was born under
[1:32:37] Saturday but everybody must be married a
[1:32:40] certain time everybody will get a car
[1:32:42] and certain time everybody will buy a
[1:32:44] house a certain day but under influence
[1:32:47] everybody's looking this one came here
[1:32:50] they told me ah inner houses are cheaper
[1:32:54] I'm going brother
[1:32:56] have you look are you under the
[1:32:59] influence of God or are you under the
[1:33:02] influence of housing material in flu
[1:33:08] that's the killer and you will die under
[1:33:12] that influence so he said one will go to
[1:33:18] the other it will either become a bad
[1:33:22] man a good woman see to cannot work
[1:33:28] together except they be agreed that the
[1:33:32] scripture we read to cannot work
[1:33:35] together unless they agree when you see
[1:33:39] people with different spirit they will
[1:33:41] not work together very often you say
[1:33:46] when this person come I know already in
[1:33:49] advance
[1:33:50] the purpose is coming to visit me is to
[1:33:53] tell me they were doing of somebody go
[1:33:59] read a message I will read it God
[1:34:01] willing sunday is your life worship of
[1:34:04] the gospel but a bottom said you know
[1:34:06] there are some people you don't want to
[1:34:08] be around because every time they are
[1:34:12] there regardless of what you do what you
[1:34:15] say they will always try to bring
[1:34:17] somebody on the scene even though what
[1:34:20] they are bringing is true but that's
[1:34:24] their spirit everywhere
[1:34:26] that's what it is everywhere and there
[1:34:28] are also people under the same anointing
[1:34:30] but is functioning on the opposite one
[1:34:34] one to talk the other one cannot stop
[1:34:37] him but another one want also to listen
[1:34:39] to know everything it's also the same
[1:34:43] spirit they want to know I want to know
[1:34:47] I want to know this way I control
[1:34:50] everything but we have I will read the
[1:34:54] rest of those things later on where was
[1:35:00] it
[1:35:05] so crime escapees so it's very very
[1:35:08] important because Branham said what
[1:35:12] really the influence is I will be
[1:35:15] deported winning Sunday he said if we
[1:35:18] can have only two real believers in our
[1:35:24] congregation
[1:35:26] it can change also the whole
[1:35:28] congregation that the people who can
[1:35:35] help really others the people who are
[1:35:38] really have influence of others they
[1:35:43] don't copy one another because you have
[1:35:46] a body car but I we know in America all
[1:35:50] the car most of the car it's as a note
[1:35:53] we know that some with a two percent
[1:35:56] interest up to thirty nine percent
[1:35:59] interest but they are on the same Road
[1:36:03] if you don't know they spirit leading
[1:36:06] you to get it you are gonna get yourself
[1:36:08] in a lot of mess a lot of miss is not so
[1:36:14] on so as one time you can see somebody
[1:36:19] buying a car maybe a brand new car his
[1:36:25] monthly payment is four hundred dollars
[1:36:27] but you go buy a old car your monthly
[1:36:30] payment is six hundred dollars but where
[1:36:33] are we going this is a spirit of the
[1:36:35] nation to paralyze those who are
[1:36:38] suffering and to lessen the burden of
[1:36:42] those who are good going everywhere even
[1:36:45] the insurance
[1:36:46] go get the car insurance for maybe my
[1:36:50] jaw here they will charge you maybe
[1:36:52] eight hundred dollars because of his age
[1:36:54] but the older you come more mature if it
[1:37:00] was only for myself I can pay insurance
[1:37:02] for fifty dollars
[1:37:08] all these elements are very important in
[1:37:11] making your life in determining your
[1:37:14] character every influence over your life
[1:37:18] it's very important brother don't copy
[1:37:20] one another don't look at one another
[1:37:25] what they are doing because God has
[1:37:28] called you separately don't do things
[1:37:31] because other people are doing
[1:37:33] don't buy because sir Sir is buying you
[1:37:37] can see somebody you know he does well
[1:37:40] he dressed well but if they tell you the
[1:37:43] secret maybe most of them are gift it's
[1:37:48] a position it's a situation but some
[1:37:53] others you have to scratch them the food
[1:37:56] skip meals for the children just to show
[1:37:59] that you are somebody
[1:38:12] so as a bottom said you take a good
[1:38:15] person you put him a bank they bad
[1:38:17] that's why they said you take a good
[1:38:19] Apple you put it among bad apples it's
[1:38:23] going to affect the rest of the Apple so
[1:38:25] each person has to take precaution
[1:38:27] measure we have to take precaution
[1:38:30] measure discerning spirit in the method
[1:38:35] they chose aim of a bride how to choose
[1:38:41] a bride the choosing of a bride para 52
[1:38:53] Burnham said the same applies by
[1:38:57] choosing a church
[1:38:59] now you must pray over the church that
[1:39:02] you are going you are fellowshiping in
[1:39:05] remember churches carry a spirit it's
[1:39:10] not because there is a name or there are
[1:39:13] a lot of people or there are few people
[1:39:15] I want to go oh no because John goes
[1:39:18] there and who goes there because we came
[1:39:20] from the same family so I go the
[1:39:25] choosing of a church is the same as the
[1:39:29] choosing of
[1:39:30] a bride if God reveals to you that your
[1:39:36] wife is in Congo I'm not going to marry
[1:39:39] anybody here I'm gonna do my best until
[1:39:42] I get to Congo get my citizenship go
[1:39:45] marry this year that's how people are
[1:39:48] doing now right you got this here you
[1:39:51] set an order traditional and a civil
[1:39:55] marriage and you get the marriage
[1:39:57] license you come back quickly and you
[1:39:59] schedule a marriage in a year knowing
[1:40:02] that within a year if I'm a citizen I
[1:40:04] will have all the paper by next year
[1:40:06] when I go I do the religious I take my
[1:40:09] wife to go it's a pattern
[1:40:11] everybody's copying one another but we
[1:40:17] have got to a lot in the message we have
[1:40:21] gone to a lot
[1:40:24] and all of this is influenced and that
[1:40:27] there can be the influence of a church
[1:40:30] over another church that's also in
[1:40:34] influence our church is influenced by
[1:40:39] the auditors but Branham says watch out
[1:40:42] churches every spirit why you want to
[1:40:45] take the spirit of another church to
[1:40:46] another church and people traveling all
[1:40:50] over they come from a church they go to
[1:40:53] another Church they carry the spirit
[1:40:54] they want to impose that Judge spirit to
[1:40:57] the new church are you with me all of
[1:41:02] this is influence that we have to pay
[1:41:05] attention we have to open our eyes and
[1:41:08] play God God help the pastor and the
[1:41:12] minister so that yourself regardless of
[1:41:15] what they do in the right of world but
[1:41:18] we want them to be under you and the
[1:41:22] worst part is to copy one another's
[1:41:25] influence there was a time we did not
[1:41:33] hear a lot of dedication in the message
[1:41:36] everybody was building the church under
[1:41:40] a certain tree and put some roof that's
[1:41:46] it and then we start worshipping myself
[1:41:49] I have a build I don't know how many
[1:41:50] churches back in the Congo never done
[1:41:53] the dedication but as the lights come we
[1:41:56] started to doing and understanding what
[1:41:58] dedication this one study further
[1:42:00] education the next door it is next
[1:42:02] dedication I don't say it's wrong but
[1:42:03] I'm just showing you how people how
[1:42:06] every as words if they have them
[1:42:10] dedication dedication they have a
[1:42:12] builder church so we have to build our
[1:42:15] church and you go after the people you
[1:42:19] bring this one you just graduate you
[1:42:21] make this much money therefore you have
[1:42:23] to contribute this much you for which
[1:42:26] purpose what is the purpose when it's
[1:42:30] time where is there is need God will
[1:42:32] lead you and open up a way but we are
[1:42:35] not
[1:42:36] waiting upon the Lord to lead and guide
[1:42:38] us we are forcing things on our own and
[1:42:41] sometimes even the believers putting
[1:42:44] pressure on the pastor pastor you know
[1:42:48] we are I think we have to build a new
[1:42:50] sanctuary I have a $10,000 I can give
[1:42:54] ten thousand gonna be enough
[1:42:57] you don't believe God will provide the
[1:42:59] rest let us just that and you start with
[1:43:01] the foundation and it doesn't go nowhere
[1:43:04] and you start going to businesses
[1:43:07] downtown collecting money for the church
[1:43:10] for it really this feed for us as a
[1:43:13] Christian all of this is a problem of
[1:43:18] influence of spirits over people Bonham
[1:43:23] said remember churches carry a spirit
[1:43:26] now I don't want to be critical that's
[1:43:29] exactly why brother missing I am NOT
[1:43:32] critical either but it making the point
[1:43:34] for whosoever can grasp it from now on
[1:43:39] to study what is your influence
[1:43:42] otherwise brother we are going far not
[1:43:47] talking about the influence of the
[1:43:48] parent the influence of the family and
[1:43:51] you see even people the part of the
[1:43:54] father come say you know my dad used to
[1:43:58] tell me regardless of what you will do
[1:44:00] if I come to your house I will open your
[1:44:04] fridge take whatever I want and I can
[1:44:07] beat you before your children I mean
[1:44:09] that's African mentality
[1:44:16] but if we are Christian we have to learn
[1:44:20] to do things according to the Word of
[1:44:22] God
[1:44:23] everything should be after the word and
[1:44:26] you see some people some family even you
[1:44:29] see my son is married already
[1:44:31] tomorrow I come because my
[1:44:35] daughter-in-law has done something I'm
[1:44:37] not pleased I start putting influence of
[1:44:39] a match my son you see that daughter
[1:44:42] your wife she did not come from a good
[1:44:45] family
[1:44:46] anyway you are the tailor she is a bunda
[1:44:51] therefore we are going to look for you a
[1:44:55] good detailer wife and you see a brother
[1:45:00] sitting there in the church buying that
[1:45:05] idea and then with that idea
[1:45:09] you will not tolerate your wife any
[1:45:12] longer
[1:45:13] everything will become bad why because
[1:45:17] it's not you acting but it's the
[1:45:20] influence of the seed you have been
[1:45:22] receiving you know she's not from our
[1:45:25] country Jesus won our time she's not
[1:45:28] from our language therefore we can get
[1:45:31] you a good one we can get you a good one
[1:45:34] we can get you a good one until that
[1:45:36] desert will settle in your heart and
[1:45:39] therefore tomorrow let's go see the
[1:45:44] pastor tomorrow
[1:45:46] the pastor until the past is tired don't
[1:45:49] know what to do and tomorrow we go to
[1:45:51] the court the judge is going to ask
[1:45:55] certain believers don't you have a
[1:45:57] pastor why you cannot serve this when
[1:46:00] the pastor can oh brother
[1:46:01] they were not believer in the first
[1:46:03] place if they were believers they will
[1:46:08] bring their matter to their pastor but
[1:46:11] in the personal servant which kind of
[1:46:13] people are they they are not believers
[1:46:15] therefore we leave them into the end of
[1:46:19] the court
[1:46:25] let's Cesar handle their case it's
[1:46:28] unfortunate but that's the truth I don't
[1:46:35] want to be critical but I realize that
[1:46:37] I'm a old man and I got to live here one
[1:46:42] of these days
[1:46:42] Alleluia which year was it Branham
[1:46:46] it was April 65 hey what are you talking
[1:46:50] about panel I am a prophet so when I'm
[1:46:55] telling you about this influence I'm
[1:46:57] about to leave the scene and I wanted to
[1:47:00] stay with this message one of these days
[1:47:03] I'm going to leave the scene but I
[1:47:05] wanted to make sure that the message
[1:47:07] about influence is working like the
[1:47:10] choosing of a bride I have I've got to
[1:47:17] answer at the day of the judgement for
[1:47:20] what I say tonight or any other time and
[1:47:24] I therefore got to be dead earnest and
[1:47:29] truly convicted April 1965 December 1965
[1:47:39] sir this day this scripture was
[1:47:42] fulfilled but for which purpose Branham
[1:47:47] said it for which purpose God allowed
[1:47:50] Branum to sell it it was not for him to
[1:47:53] go with it it was for us the future
[1:47:56] generation that's why he said those tape
[1:47:58] will go all over and us today with the
[1:48:01] privilege to lead these things we have
[1:48:04] to realize that brother I refuse
[1:48:07] anybody's influence I refuse any Church
[1:48:11] influence I we will cooperate we are
[1:48:15] brothers we are sisters we will
[1:48:17] cooperate but as far as like sharing a
[1:48:21] headquarter when I'm said this is the
[1:48:25] characteristic of a denomination go to
[1:48:28] the Catholic Church Sunday they all read
[1:48:31] from the same scripture because they get
[1:48:33] the order from their schedule from
[1:48:35] everywhere
[1:48:36] whether it's the sad part even today you
[1:48:44] will hear people saying you know we
[1:48:47] listen to brother branham tapes we
[1:48:49] listen to brother branham tapes in our
[1:48:50] church but sometimes they will get to a
[1:48:53] spot the same church is being played to
[1:48:56] many many churches at the same time we
[1:49:02] are pushing the Holy Ghost out Branham
[1:49:05] said for a local congregation there is
[1:49:08] nobody between the elder who's the
[1:49:11] pastor and God nobody in there you put
[1:49:17] somebody that's a denomination spirit
[1:49:21] para 54 but you go into a church and if
[1:49:28] you will watch the behavior of that
[1:49:30] church you just watch the pastor a while
[1:49:33] and you will usually find that the
[1:49:36] church arts like the pastor it's all
[1:49:40] more the same you know in faith we used
[1:49:42] to say tell pear tell me that's how it
[1:49:48] is sometimes I wonder if we just don't
[1:49:54] get one another spirit in the stead of
[1:49:58] the Holy Spirit you get to a place where
[1:50:01] a pastor is real radical and carrying on
[1:50:05] you will find out the congregation is
[1:50:07] the same way I will bring you to a
[1:50:10] church where I see the pastor stand jerk
[1:50:13] their heads back and forth you want the
[1:50:16] congregation they do the same thing you
[1:50:20] take a pastor just gulp down anything
[1:50:23] usually the church will do the same
[1:50:25] thing oh brother
[1:50:27] so if I was choosing a church I would
[1:50:32] choose a genuine fundamental Full Gospel
[1:50:37] Bible Church I was choosing one to put
[1:50:41] my family in EM I usually now people are
[1:50:49] not looking at what the church represent
[1:50:53] they go in the church because they have
[1:50:56] certain thing they want to be in the
[1:50:58] church I have to choose the church
[1:51:01] because it's located closer to my house
[1:51:06] because driving thirty minutes to go to
[1:51:10] church it become far Burnham told us the
[1:51:16] choosing of a church is not about the
[1:51:18] business the choosing of the church is
[1:51:22] not about the pastor is for my family or
[1:51:27] my country but I have to watch and study
[1:51:33] with the world and depending on what you
[1:51:36] are looking for then the Holy Spirit
[1:51:38] will guide you otherwise brother there
[1:51:44] will be so many many kills in the
[1:51:47] churches because of influence and you
[1:51:51] see somebody find it himself
[1:51:53] oh brother move come over here because
[1:51:56] here the event is here is and even to
[1:52:00] the extent they will tell you you know
[1:52:02] here the pastor is a liberal and you
[1:52:05] will not see the pastor trying to find
[1:52:09] out your life
[1:52:10] they don't pay attached they don't even
[1:52:12] know you they don't even care about you
[1:52:16] you want to get married their past is
[1:52:19] not even involved the only thing you do
[1:52:23] you find a girl just go talk to a girl
[1:52:27] even if you make an already pregnant
[1:52:30] just go see the pastor say pastor we did
[1:52:32] a mistake
[1:52:33] bless us tomorrow and then it will be
[1:52:36] done and that's what people are choosing
[1:52:38] to be the pastor of the pastor and with
[1:52:42] the knowledge they have accumulated over
[1:52:44] the years they said this one is doesn't
[1:52:47] know much brother
[1:52:48] we are just here because we have to be
[1:52:51] here he's a cool guy but as far as a
[1:52:54] sermon he's nowhere and we like that
[1:52:58] we want the freedom but let me tell you
[1:53:00] a good ship will look for the best
[1:53:03] shepherd to guide him and get his family
[1:53:07] blessed be the name of the Lord let us
[1:53:09] stand with God I really want you to
[1:53:27] really study the things of influence and
[1:53:32] make sure that you understand it and you
[1:53:36] stay under God influence probably God
[1:53:41] willing I'm gonna close this on Sunday
[1:53:48] and for those we're here Sunday I did
[1:53:51] our schedule by a meeting next week on
[1:53:54] Wednesday and Friday but I did not know
[1:54:00] there was a certain program that will
[1:54:03] not allow us to be able to do it on
[1:54:06] Friday so God willing Wednesday only we
[1:54:11] will have a prayer
