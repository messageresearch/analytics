[46:12] let your blood i get done let you shed
[46:15] yourself on the course
[46:17] cleanse each one of us with nature i
[46:20] shall condemn you
[46:21] so that we can be able even to speak to
[46:24] you
[46:24] afraid confusion remains coming you have
[46:27] heard
[46:28] our request john don't you know like the
[46:30] requests coming from
[46:32] your servant tonight father we want to
[46:36] be better christians
[46:38] better husbands
[46:43] [Music]
[46:54] saying but we totally mean it
[46:59] and before even we express it further
[47:03] you knew you service and that's why
[47:07] i believe from
[47:14] [Music]
[47:30] and those who are planning to travel
[47:32] during this week
[47:34] and those who have already traveled
[47:51] for his family who suffer me that you
[47:53] bless them
[47:55] bless the wife then you'll have fun
[47:57] bless the children
[47:58] and the blessed all our sisters and
[48:01] bless also our brothers
[48:05] very often us as men
[48:08] no i don't get this song we want always
[48:10] to comment
[48:12] sometimes we don't even recognize our
[48:15] hong kong
[48:16] reconnaissance in even our little things
[48:19] i'm done the pretty jews
[48:21] father give us more grace because in the
[48:24] marriage vows
[48:26] you said we have to cherish them
[48:30] we have to we are understanding
[48:45] like your prophet did count on prophet
[48:47] lafayette to assist
[48:48] them i'll assist you sometimes to fix
[48:51] the bed
[48:52] or performance when they are overwhelmed
[48:55] alcohol is unsupervised
[48:56] some of the sisters certainly said we
[48:58] have kids crying around
[49:00] deputies on funky crazy many jobs to do
[49:02] uh please you have to vote
[49:04] au pair this is the perfect job or
[49:06] sister the mail cover you know every
[49:08] work
[49:09] she said we want always to know how much
[49:12] they pay per
[49:13] hour how much they pay per hour
[49:17] on paper and what's the work schedule
[49:19] it's a common locality but for the real
[49:22] woman house housewife the farm in
[49:26] nigeria they are they are 24 hours
[49:36] [Music]
[49:53] that will be a blessing but sometimes
[49:57] we become even so selfish
[50:00] we see our wives carrying a baby in the
[50:03] front keep our place down from the van
[50:05] a baby in the front and baby another
[50:07] baby on the back
[50:09] and washing the dishes is cleaning
[50:11] everything
[50:13] and we remain indifferent
[50:17] put us in the position where we need to
[50:20] place an opposition divided
[50:21] as we heard comes about married couples
[50:25] le coupler this is where the strength of
[50:28] the church resides
[50:33] help us edna and those also planning for
[50:36] marriages
[50:38] let them also come to the understanding
[50:42] of marriage it is not for other people
[50:45] to see never poke a result of why
[50:47] it's not for sex nepal police says it's
[50:49] not for whatever people think neighbor
[50:51] john paul is to make the other person
[50:53] happy people want a lot of personalities
[50:57] and give us troubling messages and the
[51:00] blessing
[51:01] of your congregation the congregation in
[51:04] jesus christ
[51:04] and jesus christ amen amen
