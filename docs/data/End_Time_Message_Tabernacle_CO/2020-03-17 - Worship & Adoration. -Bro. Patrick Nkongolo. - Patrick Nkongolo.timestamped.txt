[17:37] for you lord help us do prepare our
[17:40] hearts to be fertile ground for your
[17:42] word this morning Lord that we wouldn't
[17:44] be concerned about other things that are
[17:45] going on in the world today Lord but

[18:06] this service that you would just be with
[18:08] the songs in the singing or that it
[18:09] wouldn't be just words falling off of
[18:12] human lips but it would be praise coming
[18:14] from our heart more and we know that the
[18:17] praise that that comes from our heart
[18:19] would just overflow to You Lord we just
[18:21] ask that you would be with the preacher

[18:24] of the way Lord we didn't come to hear
[18:26] from a man but we came to hear from you
[18:28] Lord so we just asked that you would be
[18:30] with us as even as the congregation to
[18:32] look past the bodily flesh of the
[18:33] preacher bore that but that we might be
[18:35] able to get into the channel of the Holy
[18:37] Spirit Lord that we might be able to
[18:38] receive from you we know that the coming
[18:41] of the Lord is nigh and we have a very
[18:42] short time here on earth Lord and we're
[18:44] just gathering ourselves together Lord
[18:47] to hear from you because we know it's
[18:48] that final hour and we have a little bit
[18:51] more growing to do to in your word to
[18:54] just ground our feet on that solid rock
[18:56] of faith though that we might be able to
[18:58] step into that other body Lord we know
[19:00] that that rapture is coming soon Lord
