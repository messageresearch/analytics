[54:50] isis
[54:54] so the baptism of the holy ghost never
[54:56] turned the sentence free is the main
[54:59] thing that we need for our journey
[55:04] of voyage and brother bonham said in the
[55:07] message what is the holy ghost probably
[55:10] on the message question spring because
[55:12] there is we said that the holy ghost
[55:14] that's convicted the sentence praying is
[55:16] the wedding robe e la hope de
[55:19] is our uniform another uniform is the
[55:23] thing that will allow us to enter into
[55:26] the wedding supper
[55:31] amen amen because in there everybody
[55:34] will be
[55:35] dressed alike pascal tulmon
[55:40] and the holy ghost is our white hope
[55:43] is free and not blanche and the brother
[55:45] brahman said in the message what is the
[55:47] holy ghost
[55:48] on the message security sentence 27.
[55:52] said he said now there is a vast
[55:54] difference between just a christian and
[55:57] a holy ghost field christian a yeah
[56:13] but we'll never receive the baptism of
[56:15] the holy ghost
[56:18] that's the difference he says
[56:20] a christian
[56:22] somebody who claimed to be a christian
[56:25] is it different from somebody who have
[56:28] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:32] and tonight you are here to make the
[56:34] difference um
[56:37] with the rest of the so-called
[56:39] christians
[56:42] and now we are going to get this from
[56:44] the scripture and place it just exactly
[56:47] in the scriptures
[56:53] the first place
[56:55] there is a
[56:57] ian christian profess to be a christian
[57:00] professor
[57:02] but if this christian has not yet been
[57:05] filled with the holy ghost message
[57:08] completely sentenced me he is only in
[57:11] the process of being a christian
[57:17] he is professed to believe it
[57:20] confess
[57:21] he is working to it yeah
[57:24] martial of versailles so there may be
[57:26] people tonight who are working to it
[57:29] better today
[57:31] and this is
[57:33] an opportunity you are seeing
[57:35] opportunity but god has not yet given
[57:38] him his this spirit of the holy ghost
[57:44] is praying he has not yet reached that
[57:46] goal with god my inner pancreatic
[57:49] disease affect you that god recognize
[57:55] so the baptism of the holy ghost the
[57:57] time the sentence pray is a seal satan's
[58:01] soul oh that god has accepted you
[58:06] amen amen so in the message the things
[58:09] that ought to be
[58:11] drafted
[58:15] paragraph 107.
[58:19] did you
[58:21] have a reservation

[1:01:03] but it's a pardon
[1:01:06] it is salvation that freedom from sin
[1:01:11] uh
[1:01:13] liberty
[1:01:16] it's a ticket to heaven
[1:01:22] said the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:25] and the spring is a ticket to heaven you
[1:01:28] say antiques
[1:01:30] it's also healing for the sick they say
[1:01:32] we'll see la guerrez on paulo mallard to
[1:01:34] those who will receive it as a pardon
[1:01:40] amen amen so brother branham continues
[1:01:45] in the message what is the holy ghost
[1:01:47] okay
[1:01:48] listen to me
[1:01:51] he said on paragraph 22 idiographer
[1:01:53] vendor
[1:01:55] upon this place that's your second word
[1:01:57] we wish to approach the subject
[1:02:02] which i think is the outstanding subject
[1:02:17] the reason i have taken this subject
[1:02:24] in a line like this
[1:02:26] comes to see because the brother
[1:02:30] on the holy ghost
[1:02:32] is
[1:02:34] he said the reason i have taken this
[1:02:36] subject in line like this
[1:02:41] you see because number one
[1:02:44] you cannot come and receive the holy
[1:02:47] ghost of the holy spirit
[1:02:51] unless you know what it is
[1:02:56] and you cannot receive it
[1:02:59] if you know what it is
[1:03:02] i could say unless you believe it's
[1:03:04] given to you
[1:03:08] and it's for you
[1:03:11] if you know what it is yes
[1:03:14] and you know it was
[1:03:28] you cannot know whether you have got it
[1:03:31] or not
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:34] unless you know what results it brings
[1:03:37] up
[1:03:40] amen amen sometimes we have a doubt i do
[1:03:42] have it i don't number four
[1:03:45] yes
[1:03:47] but look at you have to know what does
[1:03:50] what the holy spirit does when it comes
[1:03:53] to work
[1:03:56] so if you know what it is
[1:04:03] and what action it brings when it comes
[1:04:08] then you will know what you have got
[1:04:11] when you get it
[1:04:18] that
[1:04:19] just would settle it
[1:04:23] and in the
[1:04:24] message what is the holy ghost given
[1:04:27] foreign
[1:04:50] one more scripture i'll call him
[1:04:52] if you want to write it down like here
[1:04:55] john 12 24. john dusovan
[1:04:58] let me cut it to you right quick
[1:05:03] rapid more jesus said
[1:05:05] if a corn of wheat falls into the ground
[1:05:10] except he dies
[1:05:12] he cannot bring forth another life
[1:05:16] now look
[1:05:18] at one closing remark now
[1:05:32] it's absolutely essential
[1:05:34] absolument
[1:05:48] that you receive the holy ghost now
[1:05:54] for if you don't
[1:05:59] you can't come in the resurrection
[1:06:07] so the baptism of the holy ghost hello
[1:06:10] but i'm the center spring it's not
[1:06:12] something to play with
[1:06:17] because sometimes we are looking for the
[1:06:19] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:06:21] only by them the center is praying and
[1:06:22] we don't know how to get into a new
[1:06:25] servant
[1:06:27] i don't have time tonight to go through
[1:06:29] certain things
[1:06:35] that the people who are looking for the
[1:06:37] baptism of the holy ghost the secular
[1:06:39] shall about them do you sent us pray
[1:06:41] they have to go meet with people who
[1:06:43] have the baptism of the holy
[1:06:59] i am looking for the baptism of the holy
[1:07:00] ghost
[1:07:02] but somehow
[1:07:04] i realized
[1:07:06] it's not yet it's in a pan call what
[1:07:09] else shall i do my quadrature
[1:07:17] what else shall i do what daughter the
[1:07:20] fresh faith and as you go into
[1:07:22] conversation a conversation
[1:07:24] sometimes you realize that oh it's
[1:07:27] because of these things i'm lacking to
[1:07:29] do yes
[1:07:31] they say
[1:07:33] that's why i'm delaying the baptism of
[1:07:35] the holy spirit
[1:07:39] therefore
[1:07:40] i have to do something
[1:07:43] this is to say tonight about the sisters
[1:07:45] specifically for sir
[1:07:48] we have to
[1:07:49] advise you the wrong advantage
[1:07:52] as brother branham said comfort
[1:07:55] it is absolutely
[1:07:57] absolute essential
[1:08:00] and necessary necessary and compelling
[1:08:04] obligatory and compulsory if ramon in
[1:08:08] existence that you receive the holy
[1:08:11] ghost now
[1:08:14] for if you don't but
[1:08:17] now means tonight
[1:08:21] and if you don't receive you can't come
[1:08:25] in the resurrection
[1:08:27] resurrection so the baptism of the holy
[1:08:30] ghost to the bottom of the sentence free
[1:08:32] is your ticket for heaven
[1:08:47] i'm not saying prayers oh god i pray to
[1:08:49] give me the holy ghost
[1:08:58] you have a promise the holy ghost you
[1:09:00] are promising
[1:09:01] look at what i have done regardless of
[1:09:04] your faith according to what you have a
[1:09:06] promise
[1:09:09] and you show god
[1:09:10] what god has a promise sacred you have
[1:09:13] for me and you said god he said we did
[1:09:15] it you have to repent
[1:09:18] and you start showing god your
[1:09:20] repentance
[1:09:24] are you with me
[1:09:26] it's not just a recital prayers
[1:09:31] but a prayer where you mention
[1:09:34] god's promise
[1:09:39] to you
[1:09:40] you tell him you said if i i repent
[1:09:45] and i get baptized hey joshua tj
[1:09:48] you will give me giveaway
[1:09:51] and you show him your baptisms
[1:09:54] and you show him your repentance he used
[1:09:56] to demonstrate totally pantones maybe
[1:09:59] the day you went into the world of
[1:10:00] baptisms
[1:10:04] that's not the day you completely
[1:10:06] repented yes
[1:10:10] you did some good repentance
[1:10:13] no question by yourself
[1:10:18] depending on your own level of sincerity
[1:10:22] the pandemonium divorce and say what
[1:10:24] sincerity but brother sister
[1:10:27] even if we become
[1:10:43] from getting the baptism
[1:10:48] and that's the reason why we come to
[1:10:49] church
[1:10:51] we listen to the sermon
[1:10:55] sometimes we despise what we hear
[1:11:21] that's where i start my work of the
[1:11:23] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:11:38] there is something that needs to be done
[1:11:42] and the god is still visiting people do
[1:11:44] you continue to visit
[1:11:46] and the god is still baptizing
[1:11:50] my burden is to see some testimony of
[1:11:54] people getting to that experience
[1:12:01] you know people came to the prayer lines
[1:12:06] had a lot of discernment
[1:12:21] to listen to this quote
[1:12:25] it was in the message
[1:12:33] i seen the brother bosworth
[1:12:40] he was praying for a little boy or a
[1:12:43] young man that
[1:12:55] and he's prayed for a little boy with
[1:12:58] one eye that's blind elaborate
[1:13:02] on a
[1:13:11] that's the father sitting next to the
[1:13:13] boy
[1:13:16] so brother
[1:13:27] there is something wrong with either a
[1:13:29] child or a grandchild
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:36] it's a little girl or something
[1:13:39] it's
[1:13:40] born a of something
[1:13:51] but also the spiritual needs
[1:13:53] of spirit if he was here
[1:13:56] later you see the same god was with
[1:13:58] brother branham
[1:14:07] the father is the seeking the baptism of
[1:14:09] the holy ghost the perishable time the
[1:14:11] sentence pray
[1:14:13] if you are in that condition see what's
[1:14:15] that downside condition god knows with
[1:14:17] your name
[1:14:20] and branham said
[1:14:22] he has got some troubles to give up some
[1:14:26] habits
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:58] and god is revealing to us
[1:15:02] that there are certain habits okay yes
[1:15:04] certainty
[1:15:05] brother you know if i would survive
[1:15:07] sister you know
[1:15:09] some of the habits certainly that if you
[1:15:12] don't get rid of okay
[1:15:15] i say power god will never give you the
[1:15:17] baptism
[1:15:19] because brother said
[1:15:22] there is an inspector yeah an inspector
[1:15:25] before he can seal
[1:15:27] vancouver
[1:15:28] he has to inspect it
[1:15:31] and he has to look at some of the old
[1:15:33] habits
[1:15:49] you say today it's over
[1:15:52] no some you say today it's over
[1:15:56] but some mess up you don't want to say
[1:15:58] that
[1:16:01] you still
[1:16:02] find like it's not a problem
[1:16:18] i know it's wrong
[1:16:21] to a certain extent
[1:16:23] when i get into conscientious i like it
[1:16:27] it's a habit satan with such habits as i
[1:16:30] can tell about the inspector inspector
[1:16:32] cannot be pleased the paper is satisfied
[1:16:35] you have to decide you would have this
[1:16:38] day that today
[1:16:40] it's forever say
[1:16:42] and brandon said
[1:16:44] he has got some troubles
[1:17:15] not only that pastel mercedes but that
[1:17:17] father was in the meeting
[1:17:20] with a boy who was uh
[1:17:22] one eye basket
[1:17:26] maybe a girl who was a creeper
[1:17:32] if you give up some of the habits he was
[1:17:34] abandoned
[1:17:36] god will give you the baptism for the
[1:17:38] holy ghost
[1:17:39] the sentence praying not only the
[1:17:41] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:53] and he's gonna heal also your daughter
[1:17:56] who is the creeper
[1:18:09] they don't allow healings in san diego
[1:18:12] lagerizon of our family members they
[1:18:15] don't member the family or for ourselves
[1:18:17] the number
[1:18:19] those habits they say between can be the
[1:18:22] cause
[1:18:24] for the failure even of the church
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:30] those habits this is attitude can you
[1:18:33] prevent yourself from perv
[1:18:36] to have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:39] while you attempt to understand so as we
[1:18:41] want to go to prayers
[1:18:43] we are not going to pray in the air now
[1:18:47] no we are going to
[1:18:49] take our habits into prayers
[1:19:06] some of the habits satan's attitude it's
[1:19:08] because of the environment you go in
[1:19:12] motherland
[1:19:14] or the circumstance you find yourself in
[1:19:16] lucio constance
[1:19:19] some of those habits
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:44] are preventing you from
[1:19:46] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:07] talking about pharaoh when he wanted to
[1:20:09] go with the children of israel
[1:20:13] israel of moses when he wanted to go
[1:20:15] with the children of israel he is a
[1:20:17] convoluted part of elizabeth
[1:20:19] want him to compromise yes
[1:20:23] now
[1:20:25] i will let you go man
[1:20:27] but before he let them go
[1:20:44] not just one single day of prayer
[1:20:48] but you have to be persistent
[1:20:51] lord you know this habits

[1:21:57] cattle back there
[1:22:01] you see
[1:22:02] people want to compromise
[1:22:05] but when we want a deliverance
[1:22:18] i'm not going to say i'm going to leave
[1:22:20] a certain habitat
[1:22:26] that's the way the devil wants a
[1:22:28] christian to come second circle
[1:22:32] to come with some compromise
[1:22:35] and he will tell you
[1:22:37] it will be all right for you to join the
[1:22:40] church
[1:22:43] but don't you never forgive john's many
[1:22:46] pardons

[2:16:37] and to as many as the lord our god shall
[2:16:39] cause
[2:16:41] lord understanding lord jesus christ the

[2:16:54] revealed in his own church
[2:16:58] throughout
[2:17:01] in our earthly journey
[2:17:04] we have seen the father god the spirit
[2:17:06] moving lord father god throughout the
[2:17:08] earth
[2:17:10] taking love for the god from the god

[2:18:11] and lord jesus christ there in john 14.
[2:18:14] well father god you say when this holy
[2:18:16] spirit shall come
[2:18:19] shall teach you all things
[2:18:21] bring all things to your remembrance
[2:18:25] and show us things to come forward
[2:18:28] as the prophet would show father god
[2:18:30] this same holy spirit came to paul

[2:18:36] that were passed
[2:18:38] [Music]

[2:18:47] spirit
[2:18:49] [Music]
[2:18:50] and said that the lord shall judge the
[2:18:52] world by my gospel
[2:18:57] and whereby he says
[2:18:59] to the galatians that if any angel comes
[2:19:02] from heaven with another gospel lord let
[2:19:04] it be lord father
[2:19:15] and the things that
[2:19:17] does
[2:19:18] when the holy spirit comes no father got
[2:19:20] into a man
[2:19:24] in humility
[2:19:26] in simplicity
[2:19:28] because lord you hide and reveal
[2:19:31] yourself in simplicity

[2:20:00] that's
[2:20:11] the greatest revelation of all time

[2:20:28] but it was the bride in the end-time
[2:20:30] father

[2:20:38] to see god in this program
[2:20:41] and
[2:20:42] station of it in our lives
[2:20:46] who could do this
[2:20:48] by the holy spirit
[2:20:51] that's why we desire it
[2:20:54] that's why i love father god we come to
[2:20:55] father we lay aside anything that be
[2:20:58] easily be satisfied
[2:21:03] father we're standing and we're looking
[2:21:04] father god away unto you
[2:21:08] because you say that the e flow for the
[2:21:10] evil
[2:21:15] that you give to your children the
[2:21:16] things that they desire
[2:21:20] [Music]

[2:22:30] came down
[2:22:32] in joshua 5 14 father and we
[2:22:48] that's what we want to see moving in our
[2:22:50] hearts
