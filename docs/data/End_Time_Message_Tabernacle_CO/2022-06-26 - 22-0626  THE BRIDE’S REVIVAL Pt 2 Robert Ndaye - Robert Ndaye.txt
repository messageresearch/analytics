don't we will not get the full maximum of benefit of what we are trying to do no we will try to start on time and uh break uh shortly there will not be long worship service so that we can give time to the guest speakers [Music] and among the visitors we will have our pastor david seiler from tennessee a family visited david silent giving the tennessee some of you have had the opportunity to listen to him when he preached here a few years ago he is a very good speaker he has done all those different banquets with the youth and also with the couple and i heard the testimony when he preached in south africa arizona and elsewhere here in the states he can really draw the attention especially with any category of people especially young people special mavic and important category because he

in various of ways so the job we have uh we don't have much time but i believe god willing next sunday uh we will spend some time together praying for those meetings as well you can keep those meetings in the prayers that will be a blessing we are trying to do our best to prepare for those meetings and i would like to have a quick meeting after service today here we have our in your private services with uh the group of coordination so that we i can know where we are standing how much money we need to spend and what needs to be done eventually but i think you have to get already the report from all the commissions okay okay but uh still if we can have a quick meeting uh like that after service maybe 20 minutes uh to make sure that we put the dot where we need to be and also we have received some calls from people who have registered but they don't have a place to to stay so i will ask anyone who would be open to that to receive depending on your capacity that will be

uh not reflecting good it's very good alexa you know since this year i did not want to make any announcement for the cleaning but i think the adoption need to put us where we belong i think people in the community they say this is a very rich church um but when they look at the property because regardless of property it doesn't reflect really christianity it's an um reflect passover that created to the extent they said i don't want to be labeled african african but i want to be labeled christian so next sunday at 10 we need to do deep cleaning saturday sunday dessert today we did not allow
