[4:32] [Music]
[4:39] dear heavenly father we want to thank
[4:42] you for the privilege and opportunity
[4:44] you have given to us tonight
[4:47] to come into your presence lord
[4:50] with a desire in our heart
[4:53] to comply with your word we pray father
[4:57] that you give us
[4:59] a special grace as we are speaking
[5:03] your word so that something come
[5:08] and reveal unto us
[5:11] what we need to do for
[5:14] our hearing for our deliverance
[5:20] so that we can know because you are the
[5:22] holy god
[5:24] you are the creator of heaven and earth
[5:27] there is no demon that can stand into
[5:29] your presence
[5:31] you know exactly what each one of us has
[5:34] to do
[5:35] in order to obtain the healing we have
[5:38] seen many many examples in the bible
[5:42] some place you have just to spill on the
[5:45] count
[5:46] and take the mud and anoint eyes
[5:50] for the eyes to be opened we have seen
[5:52] incident
[5:53] instances where you will allow just a
[5:56] person
[5:57] to come and touch your garment and be
[5:59] healed
[6:00] father you have made a lot of
[6:02] circumstances
[6:03] and we pray for us to tonight
[6:07] that you create something in the faith
[6:11] that can touch you in a special way
[6:14] bless the reading of thy word and bless
[6:17] what will be said
[6:18] all for your own glory and honor we are
[6:21] asking in jesus mighty name
[6:24] amen amen may god bless you you may see
[6:32] it
[6:38] we are going to
[6:42] continue with our principles the
[6:46] principles of god
[6:50] and last sunday we spoke
[6:57] about the principle of confession
[7:04] showing that confession
[7:08] is something very important
[7:14] bonham has shown us many examples
[7:21] that you can cry
[7:26] you can scream
[7:31] but if your life doesn't lie
[7:34] doesn't line up with the word review
[7:53] and i believe during this series
[8:08] everything that every example every case
[8:12] just take it personally to the example
[8:16] and the claim in that principle
[8:20] because god cannot work outside of his
[8:23] principles
[8:29] [Music]
[8:35] he could see a vision for my case
[8:40] god could show him something for my case
[8:46] can be possible that possible would not
[8:48] be possible also
[8:50] because if you listen to brother
[8:52] barnabas
[8:54] he will say you know
[8:58] i only do what god showed me
[9:02] jesus himself said the same thing jesus
[9:05] i only do what the father showed me
[9:09] and you will see brother when i'm
[9:10] skipping many people see that person
[9:12] over there
[9:13] [Music]
[9:17] i think in one of the message record and
[9:20] learn the massage
[9:21] i just give you messages to go listen
[9:23] you have done some of the message
[9:25] because as a human being
[9:29] i cannot tell you everything that i come
[9:32] across
[9:34] in hong kong
[9:48] that means there is somewhere where
[9:51] you need the faith faith will kick in
[9:56] and that will come by the hearing of the
[9:58] word
[10:00] as you give yourself one
[10:14] and you will have what you are looking
[10:16] for
[10:18] and you see brother panama was uh
[10:21] listening
[10:22] uh this morning the tape diseases
[10:26] disease and afflictions
[10:42] but as he come to criticize the
[10:44] community
[11:11] but just come believing
[11:22] and just say lord if it did not happen
[11:25] yesterday
[11:26] it's a new
[11:35] amen amen so from uh sunday message
[11:39] the message we said we saw that uh
[11:43] brother banam saying that don't even
[11:45] come into the prayer line
[11:46] of wife
[11:49] if see you don't have faith to believe
[11:53] stephen have a palace if you have
[11:57] you don't have condemnation in your
[11:59] heart you even have a party condemnation
[12:02] just come believing just as they need
[12:04] quiet all things
[12:06] are possible and uh from uh
[12:10] what brother bonham which what we spoke
[12:13] about
[12:13] last sunday
[12:17] i think we closed up with uh the case of
[12:20] that
[12:20] woman called
[12:25] she was a married woman in from marie
[12:28] she was a sunday school teacher
[12:31] and uh he was going
[12:34] insane over 10 years
[12:40] and uh nothing could have done to help
[12:42] her
[12:43] vienna
[12:46] and uh we saw that even brother branham
[12:49] came
[13:04] and they met that woman somewhere again
[13:06] on the streets
[13:13] there was no result why
[13:17] why because there was to sin basketball
[13:21] confessing that god principles as the
[13:24] concept that year you can say oh if i
[13:26] could be in the william branham
[13:28] meeting i cannot believe
[13:31] even if you could be in jesus meetings
[13:35] with your unconfessed scene confessing
[13:38] you will stay with it
[13:43] how many were resurrected in the jesus
[13:46] ministry combined
[13:59] the bible said multitude in the military
[14:02] and abraham told us
[14:04] multitudes over two thousand
[14:07] say depleted jesus came talk just to one
[14:11] person
[14:11] like one person heal that person
[14:14] and so the
[14:18] important thing is important is for you
[14:22] individually individual to
[14:25] follow the principles
[14:28] god will not act outside of his
[14:31] principles
[14:33] so speaking about that woman they said
[14:36] to them brother
[14:37] came and prayed a second time
[14:41] nothing yeah and that woman he said
[14:44] foreign spend a lot of money in the
[14:46] psychiatrist in louisville
[14:53] she could have traveled everywhere
[14:56] changing
[15:03] [Music]
[15:11] patient confesses your situation will be
[15:13] worse what a situation for some period
[15:15] and that woman could go
[15:16] until she will be completely crazy
[15:22] somewhere but i'm asking you about your
[15:33] which level is that i can lick my voice
[15:37] she has to try everything they are like
[15:39] 2a but she was still feeling something
[15:42] is missing
[15:45] i'm no longer me what
[15:48] do i need to do but i'm even praying
[16:04] saying here in the message faith without
[16:06] works
[16:20] for
[16:34] to
[16:47] regardless of the case malgrelica but
[16:50] there is that
[16:51] sparking things yes it shows that you do
[16:53] have
[16:54] me and that's why we are preaching the
[16:57] way we are doing it
[17:00] to help someone
[17:14] god in his mercy you don't have misery
[17:18] has revealed what your trouble is
[17:23] amen amen and that's what we want really
[17:26] to see say second
[17:28] form of war god in his mercy you don't
[17:43] god came in his mercy then
[17:46] he's recorded and he should give a
[17:48] vision he had the name vision
[17:50] and in that vision he don't say division
[17:55] god show brother branham
[17:58] on what the unconfessed scene was
[18:04] say and as soon as that woman fix
[18:07] it okay said before miscellaneous and
[18:10] she fixed it the way the word said you
[18:13] should
[18:14] fix it
[18:18] and if you fix it otherwise
[18:23] you will say i fix it mr but
[18:28] if that doesn't meet the principle of
[18:30] god my sis
[18:33] because if you follow that story
[18:36] when brother told her to go fix it
[18:43] [Music]
[19:03] and when you follow that principle
[19:06] then it will work allah
[19:11] after he told her a picky lady and she
[19:13] went and fixed it with the husband
[19:16] and the husband was also in the same
[19:18] case
[19:21] he also fixed his condition he knows he
[19:24] missed our condition
[19:25] they come together with one mind
[19:30] one accord if we agree
[19:33] with some of that then god will act
[19:35] hello because
[19:50] there is
[20:03] between you and somebody don't
[20:07] continue with your offering continue
[20:09] perfect leave
[20:10] it less less go first and fix it
[20:13] then come here otherwise god will not
[20:16] accept your sacrifice
[20:22] among many principles of god that may
[20:24] please your precipitate
[20:25] so after confession
[20:29] then we brother had a prayer of
[20:33] faith that was that
[20:36] prayer of faith that
[20:40] delivered that woman he had delivered
[20:42] that to produce the healing
[20:46] so for tonight as we continue along
[20:48] those is welcome to continue
[20:50] for title the principle of a prayer of
[20:54] faith
[20:57] after confession appella confess you in
[20:59] the divine healing
[21:09] [Music]
[21:13] yeah there is a principle of a prayer
[21:15] yeah i'm conceived
[21:17] yet we cannot dis uh um despise the
[21:20] prayer on a paper denigral up here
[21:22] but which prayer prayer it's a prayer of
[21:25] faith and you cannot ever pray of
[21:28] faith if
[21:31] there is a condemnation in your
[21:33] condemnation about the girl
[21:36] if there is a condemnation you see a
[21:38] condemnation

[23:57] principal appearance
[23:59] after confession a prayer confession in
[24:01] divine healing not like arizona
[24:04] and we are going to take our texts
[24:05] tonight
[24:08] in second kings yes second kings
[24:12] chapter 20. i know that uh
[24:16] we have read this scripture in many ways
[24:22] uh that's the same scripture also that
[24:24] the brotherhood
[24:25] used very often uh from the book of
[24:28] isaiah 38. i say we'll see
[24:30] under
[24:35] but i want to use the one in second king
[24:38] chapter 20.
[24:42] regarding hezekiah concerning
[24:47] second king chapter 20.
[24:50] we read verses one to seven verses
[24:56] in those days was hezekiah sick unto
[24:59] death
[25:01] and the prophet isaiah the son of amos
[25:04] came to him and said unto him
[25:07] just say the lord set thine house in
[25:11] order
[25:12] for thou shalt die and not leave
[25:15] your life
[25:26] done
[25:31] then he turned his face to the wall and
[25:34] prayed
[25:35] unto the lord saying he is
[25:43] i beseech thee oh lord
[25:46] remember now how i have walked
[25:50] before thee in the truth and with a
[25:52] perfect
[25:53] heart and have done that which
[25:56] is good in thy sight and ezekiel
[26:00] wept
[26:08] as
[26:15] and it came to pass before isaiah
[26:18] was gone out into the middle court
[26:22] that the lord of the word of the lord
[26:25] came
[26:25] to him saying
[26:36] turn again and tell hezekiah the captain
[26:40] of my people
[26:42] just said the lord the god of david thy
[26:45] father
[26:46] i have heard thy prayer i have seen
[26:49] thy tears behold i will heal
[26:52] thee on the third day thou shalt
[26:56] go up and to the house of the lord
[27:04] and say the letter
[27:16] and i will add unto thy days
[27:20] 15 years and i will deliver thee
[27:24] and this city out of the hand of the
[27:28] king
[27:28] of assyria and i will defend the city
[27:31] for
[27:32] my own sake and for my servant
[27:35] david's sake
[27:42] [Music]
[27:46] foreign
[27:53] and isaiah said take a lamp of
[27:56] figs and they took and laid it
[28:00] on the boil and he recovered
[28:06] [Music]
[28:12] and before we go further
[28:16] i want you to notice the solution
[28:20] the solution
[28:23] and that's the reason why i prefer to
[28:25] read in the second king then
[28:27] in isaiah
[28:32] because in uh isaiah they said it
[28:34] towards the end it will be a long
[28:36] reading
[28:41] but i want you to know this javed
[28:52] just take a lump of figs
[28:57] in a mass defeat and they took it
[29:01] and laid it on the boil
[29:06] and he recovered he
[29:11] the is of what need to be done for your
[29:14] problem
[29:17] and here the bible i heard the bottom
[29:19] out and saying you'd say
[29:21] yeah in a friendship of hamart and
[29:25] in english they call it boil an angle on
[29:27] a pencil
[29:29] boil but brother bonham said
[29:33] it was not a boy
[29:47] but if you go back to the first verse
[29:51] the bible said
[30:12] just uh something swollen who was just
[30:15] in grocery because something that's just
[30:17] a swollen basket
[30:19] yeah they just
[30:31] that could have been started like a
[30:33] simple buoyancy
[30:36] and then it progressed if we say and it
[30:39] become like a cancer
[30:41] it's a divine command can say so
[30:44] that was the case as the kaya was
[30:46] dealing with
[31:01] so that was not something uh a simple
[31:04] disease sente by in malady symbol
[31:08] i mean we can talk about the blind
[31:10] bartimaeus
[31:12] we can talk about the other blind the
[31:14] born blind but
[31:18] those were not sicknesses leading to
[31:20] death messenger
[31:23] but when we are dealing with cases today
[31:26] mechanus returns like the kawajordu
[31:28] of divine healing de la garison living
[31:30] we are going to the extreme nozzle
[31:32] extreme disease touching death
[31:37] like uh cancer can say
[31:40] like uh uh maybe in the time of the
[31:43] bible
[31:44] leprosy
[31:54] we want to know to read the first
[31:56] brother because what i said
[31:57] is what exactly what he said
[32:01] this exactly in the message god doesn't
[32:04] call men to judgment without first
[32:06] warning
[32:12] paragraph 41.
[32:27] as a king maybe he was uh walking around
[32:29] his palace
[32:33] maybe he fell around the fence
[32:37] and then uh he got a cat he better
[32:41] and uh it's swollen a little bit it's a
[32:43] loud conflict
[32:45] and uh it continued continuing
[32:48] until it becomes like a cancer
[32:50] illegitimately the new command can say
[32:52] and then he realized that his life was
[32:55] threatening to death
[33:00] but in that condition maidan said
[33:02] condition
[33:03] as we said about principles
[33:06] maybe he started taking the medicine in
[33:09] his uh
[33:10] house of pharmacy
[33:16] and then he went to see the doctors if
[33:19] we live while the doctor
[33:21] by the way somebody was telling me you
[33:23] know when trump got the virus
[33:28] they looked the entire floor is all
[33:32] made to turn it alive the entire floor
[33:35] in the hospital
[33:36] is on
[33:46] the best doctors the major doctor and
[33:49] they say he's a treatment cost
[33:51] we don't know how much money in this
[33:53] zone
[33:59] that was the president of the united
[34:04] states
[34:06] and i was also yesterday looking on the
[34:08] internet
[34:10] internet i saw the air force one larger
[34:13] view living
[34:14] presidency air force one air force one i
[34:17] was going through
[34:19] they have a hospital in the
[34:22] in the airplane lopita
[34:29] the president of the united states the
[34:31] president is unique they have
[34:33] the best equipment it's only mayor's
[34:35] equipment i saw the operating room
[34:40] in the plane down last year with the
[34:43] best
[34:43] doctors i think the mayor doctor best is
[34:46] uh
[34:47] uh surgeon avec le mayo
[34:50] so the trump is traveling i know trump
[34:53] can't even
[34:54] it's not only about the trump it's all
[34:56] the president
[34:58] so when they are traveling
[35:07] i look at the picture the operating
[35:10] table i look at the monitors
[35:29] you can travel with the president all
[35:31] the places
[35:32] president if the president is not sick
[35:35] philip is done upon my life you have
[35:37] nothing to do with a very nice look at
[35:39] the paycheck
[35:42] paycheck
[35:46] probably we are in the wrong job so
[35:48] probably some examples
[35:52] but that's what it is message can say
[35:54] with the virus
[35:56] i think trump was five days in the
[35:57] hospital that was it
[36:01] somebody at that age he received the
[36:04] best
[36:05] treatment now what the criticism are
[36:08] not secular critics the virus killed a
[36:12] lot of americans
[36:13] research america they never tried all
[36:17] those diseases how does the treatment
[36:19] operate oh that treatment is not yet
[36:22] approved oh no say that
[36:24] is not yet approved
[36:34] so i'm saying this rejecting to show you
[36:37] the case
[36:38] of ezekiel
[36:44] when his sickness was getting worse
[36:46] constantly
[36:48] the bodyguard le garduko
[36:51] was saying dizzy because pascal
[36:57] you know some of the presidents
[36:58] certainly the president they have
[37:00] religious councillors is on the
[37:02] conservative
[37:04] ah so ezekiel is
[37:21] a dialect of them prophet and
[37:24] at that time yesterday it was the
[37:26] prophet elisha
[37:28] prophet ely oh no he was the prophet
[37:31] uh isaiah
[37:34] prophet
[37:38] one of the greatest prophets learn the
[37:40] pluton prophet who wrote the 66th
[37:42] book of the bible et cetera
[37:46] so they said a.d isaiah
[37:49] you're the big prophet oregon prophet
[37:52] go tell us what the matter is
[37:56] so when they saw isaiah everybody
[38:00] was running isaiah isaiah
[38:12] they wanted to know the condition of uh
[38:43] maybe uh the chief of staff
[38:48] chef the cabinet prophet prophet
[38:51] what about the president just say the
[38:54] lord
[38:56] you know when you know everything that
[38:57] said the lord's a villain
[39:06] and for the prophet isaiah hello the
[39:09] prophet is
[39:10] there was no doubt did you ever do he
[39:12] got the
[39:26] yes
[39:38] he was halfway illegal
[39:54] god
[40:19] did not look at how long his sickness
[40:22] has been in
[40:37] lady hezekiah turned against the world
[40:41] and he made his confession confession
[40:45] and he the tears came down
[40:49] you see the impact of sincere repentance
[40:52] who will impact the unconfessional
[40:54] senses
[40:56] the impact of confession impacted the
[40:59] confession that will produce a prayer of
[41:02] faith
[41:32] and that's
[42:42] and you move if which your power maybe a
[42:43] few minutes
[42:45] you were still in the court called like
[42:47] that question in the prayers
[42:49] this is what the prayer does the second
[42:51] second fellow prayer
[42:53] doesn't change that said the lord strong
[43:23] i have seen his prayers the views of the
[43:25] year
[43:26] go back again because i cannot send
[43:29] somebody
[43:31] through because if i send somebody a
[43:33] decision
[43:36] this one is right
[43:52] after
[44:06] there is no big authority in your power
[44:09] plug
[44:11] no big authority in uh the word
[44:15] plugin
[44:20] if
[44:34] all the curses
[44:38] [Music]
[44:48] is
[44:50] [Applause]
[45:02] after confession
[45:14] [Applause]
[45:29] amen amen that's what we are here
[45:33] because it's a principle and at the end
[45:36] we will outline in the case of ezekiel
[45:41] which principle was used
[45:44] to
[45:59] [Music]
[46:25] when the prophet told him godly prophet
[47:08] you
[47:50] he cried
[48:05] prophet was going el prophet the
[48:08] bodyguard
[48:10] prophet prophet they called you antapel
[48:13] what is the condition of our president
[48:16] condescending god said the lord is
[49:00] was halfway
[49:03] maybe two hours if not less
[49:07] that prayer changed god's mind
[49:12] the prayer of faith
[49:28] this
[49:38] and i'm a god of princesses
[49:41] i have to follow my own principles
[49:44] because the king basically have to
[49:46] follow the principles that's revealed
[49:49] therefore i am obligated this was
[49:52] obligated
[49:53] to respond and then he went to the
[49:57] prophet
[49:58] prophet isaiah
[50:02] isaiah said the lord and see the
[50:04] listener he's gonna leave
[50:06] aviva isaiah is the prophet
[50:19] a prophet and prophet he's just the
[50:22] mouth of god
[50:23] what god put second
[50:35] you ready what do you want me to do
[50:37] let's get your vacation first
[50:52] we
[51:07] some people they didn't want even to
[51:09] create a person
[51:11] when he came to the king
[51:15] the king knowing what he has been going
[51:17] through
[51:20] that i've been praying for yeah
[51:23] i have done all that i needed your faith
[51:26] two seconds i will follow
[51:27] every principle as soon as he saw the
[51:31] prophet
[51:32] prophet something stole him like that's
[51:35] it
[51:36] and the prophet is looking prophetic
[51:39] just say the lord receding
[51:41] you are gonna leave you have evil and in
[51:44] three days they don't wash you you will
[51:46] even be in church worship you say
[51:48] remember
[51:55] god doesn't call men to judgment without
[51:58] first warning
[52:02] 41.
[52:05] i was told to make ready and get ready
[52:07] because
[52:08] that he had to meet his maker
[52:16] now
[52:22] did you notice his plea here hey market
[52:25] supplies are
[52:26] so supple you see
[52:29] lord i beseech you to consider me
[52:33] please consider hey i have a work before
[52:36] you with a perfect
[52:37] heart eventually
[52:40] rather to get to a divine healing
[52:43] divine your heart
[52:58] is
[53:02] and the brother said when he said it and
[53:05] he like this he was telling god he
[53:06] decided
[53:07] i've walked before you with a perfect
[53:10] heart
[53:11] god did not blame
[53:39] and yet god changed his mind about him
[53:48] he wanted to do something and god
[53:52] said he would give us the desires
[54:09] quality just
[54:12] do i want to be healed because
[54:17] that i have a big face no
[54:20] no there should be a right motive is
[54:22] that objective
[54:36] if
[54:51] lord you know when you have to say with
[54:53] my sickness condition
[54:55] like conditions sometimes it's hard to
[54:58] go
[54:58] even to church but for some difficulties
[55:01] sometimes it's
[55:02] hard to go even do something for you
[55:03] perform difficult
[55:10] if that motive is correct system motif
[55:13] correct
[55:13] god will quickly help you would you ever
[55:15] happy tomorrow's a day but if your
[55:17] motive is
[55:18] save automotive
[55:46] he said he got a cancer on him a lady
[55:49] like you the conceptually
[55:51] or something another okay and they call
[55:54] it a boy on a pencil
[55:58] in that day but we know
[56:02] boys don't regularly kill you
[56:07] they just get well they say
[56:10] this but it was perhaps a cancer
[56:14] and it opened up like a boy
[56:18] is it a sort of communion pool because
[56:20] the bible said that's gonna be blessed
[56:21] hezekiah was
[56:23] sick and to death
[56:25] [Music]
[56:28] because a
[56:40] thank god for the prophet
[56:45] but it was perhaps a cancer veteran
[56:49] and it opened up like a boy
[56:52] and the guy told isaiah said hey judea
[56:54] is go up
[56:56] there
[57:03] [Music]
[57:18] you got to be a you got to be a reason
[57:22] for it
[57:24] it's just like this scripture that i so
[57:27] often referred to
[57:31] if you say to this mountain mountain be
[57:34] removed
[57:35] and they don't doubt but believe
[57:38] me
[57:48] that's all together controlled
[57:50] automotive and objectives
[58:20] you are
[58:24] god don't give you gift just to play
[58:26] with it you know if we don't palate
[58:27] don't just
[58:28] oppose you avec amen amen brother the
[58:31] gift
[58:32] that god has given to each one of us if
[58:35] you are do not shake it down tonight
[58:36] it is not for sure and spectacular it is
[58:39] not for myself
[58:40] one member is not for me to you know you
[58:43] are against my gifts
[58:45] that contraband no no a real gift
[58:55] amen amen so parker for the fight
[59:00] as i was saying a while ago
[59:15] that's the secret says
[59:20] before god can use you mightily
[59:24] be a prisoner to him
[59:28] why are you looking for divine healing
[59:59] objectives why do you go to the church i
[1:00:02] go to church
[1:00:03] i can't find a husband or a wife
[1:00:07] and if i don't find it i'm gonna leave
[1:00:11] yes we more
[1:00:27] no matter no matter how much you want to
[1:00:30] tell
[1:00:30] that guy he's wrong because you say
[1:00:35] and what this that or the other who says
[1:00:38] he will say love
[1:00:39] you hold this deal till god says
[1:00:45] there are some things you don't have to
[1:00:47] say there are certain shows
[1:00:50] you have to say it until god allows you
[1:00:52] to develop
[1:00:54] then when god says so he can't do a
[1:00:56] decency
[1:00:57] then you can come with that said the
[1:00:59] lord
[1:01:02] until that jesus just godzilla just
[1:01:04] forget about it
[1:01:07] amen amen so my
[1:01:23] patience and confessing therefore
[1:01:25] brothers
[1:01:26] don't affair what i told you sunday
[1:01:29] because of zadie demons with a lot of
[1:01:31] pain in my heart
[1:01:33] it's the truth celebrity wave and
[1:01:35] confess to see
[1:01:37] the patient confessing you cannot have
[1:01:39] the prayer of faith
[1:01:44] is what changed the will of god
[1:01:47] so if you don't want to confess you
[1:01:50] cannot
[1:02:23] the effectual fervent prayer of
[1:02:25] righteous men
[1:02:26] a violent match
[1:02:31] oh if you only knew
[1:02:35] she said that in your hand
[1:02:38] because christ gave
[1:02:41] us the authority
[1:02:45] with his name by by being a christian
[1:02:50] the most powerful weapon
[1:02:54] the world has ever known
[1:03:00] it even changes everything sasha's
[1:03:03] mammoth ii
[1:03:04] and you see every time brother branham
[1:03:06] said
[1:03:09] that a prior change he thinks he's
[1:03:12] always
[1:03:12] going back to hezekiah
[1:03:17] he is one of the strongest type in the
[1:03:20] bible they learn the typical plus
[1:03:22] of a prayer of faith
[1:03:26] that can't even change the plan of god
[1:03:28] change
[1:03:31] he said it will change the mind of god
[1:03:34] it is a challenge
[1:03:36] it did do it after death was pronounced
[1:03:40] to a man
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:56] in the message expectation expectative
[1:04:02] the one preaching 1961. celebration on
[1:04:04] these nerf sounds for something yeah
[1:04:06] paragraph nine paragraph nerf brother
[1:04:10] what man calls great god calls the
[1:04:13] foolish ezekiel my pelegrant you are
[1:04:15] pencil of fuller and what
[1:04:16] man called the foolish god calls great
[1:04:18] the secret lord
[1:04:19] loma pele follicular pellegrino so what
[1:04:22] we have
[1:04:22] got to do second or something fair
[1:05:15] we have promoted our own wishes and all
[1:05:18] the plans
[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:48] that was ever put in the control of
[1:05:50] human beings
[1:05:59] there is no atomic bomb
[1:06:02] oh no hydrogen bomb as powerful as the
[1:06:05] prayers

[1:06:16] it talk about the prayer of faith
[1:06:20] after confession well there is no
[1:06:24] condemnation
[1:06:25] in the heart allowing you to
[1:06:26] condemnation
[1:06:30] if you'll be
[1:06:56] that will change even god said the lord
[1:06:59] jesus

[1:08:40] that statute you put somewhere this is
[1:08:42] that you get your medical just check it
[1:08:43] out
[1:08:50] brother sometimes we pray a lot
[1:08:54] but we have to have the approach of the
[1:08:56] prayers
[1:08:59] the prayer that god can reveal
[1:09:02] to gift or whatever
[1:09:19] there was a brother
[1:09:22] those who know him he's the one who sold
[1:09:24] his uh
[1:09:25] uh plot to shekinata bernanke
[1:09:31] he was uh one of the brothers
[1:09:36] affair went with me when i went to pay
[1:09:38] the dowry for my marriage
[1:09:46] i call him always
[1:09:54] there was a somebody expert in the
[1:09:57] witchcraft
[1:09:57] yeah they could think it experience of
[1:09:59] ciliary
[1:10:43] that you never james it always states
[1:10:47] and maybe people didn't pay attention by
[1:10:50] himself he knew
[1:10:50] maybe what was going on
[1:10:54] one day that brother i told you papa
[1:10:56] francois
[1:11:24] stay
[1:11:39] brother did not get it completely
[1:11:42] until just a second he revealed himself
[1:11:45] this is statutes that you see nobody
[1:11:47] nobody personally
[1:11:48] that means you must have power
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:35] amen amen so let's go back here and
[1:12:38] close it
[1:12:40] let us read here so prayer
[1:12:45] every day you pray of faith
[1:12:48] it's like more than an atomic bomb it's
[1:12:51] a blue scalable but to make that bomb
[1:12:53] that wasn't said in japan
[1:12:57] 1945 it is never sunken until today
[1:13:00] it is still effective
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:42] and confess your sister a confession for
[1:13:59] come is on the prayer lines
[1:14:03] attached i was just not just the past
[1:14:05] just the perspective
[1:14:08] because you believe what the problem
[1:14:12] says
[1:15:08] and look at the testimony but when you
[1:15:10] come they come with any i'm not saying
[1:15:12] that the praying is wrong
[1:15:15] but the word of god is a two-edged sword
[1:15:20] today we tell you this shows
[1:15:36] amen amen so now brother burnham
[1:15:38] continues
[1:15:42] i'm gonna skip here a little bit and i
[1:15:44] can't imagine
[1:15:45] imagining that i'm saying i can't
[1:15:48] imagine
[1:15:51] all the celebrity at the gate dude
[1:15:56] the peasants out at the outer court
[1:16:02] when they went in said they consumed
[1:16:08] what will become of our king they cannot
[1:16:12] do nothing i said a lot and see the
[1:16:14] lesson here he's going to die if our
[1:16:16] movie
[1:16:18] went out to the soldiers the party
[1:16:20] valley soldiers oh great prophet oh god
[1:16:22] prophet
[1:16:22] what does the lord say about our kingdom
[1:16:27] that said a lot because he did the same
[1:16:28] year he's gonna die
[1:16:30] amen amen he got it that said the lord
[1:16:34] he has nothing else to say there is no
[1:16:37] negotiation
[1:16:40] i know i'm the perfect prophet
[1:17:00] lord listen here lord god senior dear
[1:17:03] ibc to you
[1:17:05] to consider me i walked before you with
[1:17:08] a perfect heart
[1:17:11] i need 15 years longer to get my kingdom
[1:17:15] in conditions
[1:17:20] he was a king he knew that if i die like
[1:17:23] this
[1:17:25] could have happened to my kingdom
[1:17:42] a prayer
[1:17:53] looks like that god would have wanted to
[1:17:56] say
[1:17:57] anything they come see jovule with
[1:17:59] director
[1:18:00] he would have told him while he was
[1:18:03] talking to him
[1:18:07] but god has ways of doing this
[1:18:12] you have to come god's way would have
[1:18:14] had veneer of what they do
[1:18:17] and god's means of doing things
[1:18:21] don't do fellow shows as long as we try
[1:18:24] to get it
[1:18:26] ourselves
[1:18:30] then it won't work we have to try maybe
[1:18:36] in many ways
[1:18:51] and we just can't pardon after one
[1:18:54] another
[1:18:57] oh because that brother did this
[1:19:02] we can't pardon after one another
[1:19:06] we have god to live individually before
[1:19:09] god no they want vivid individual
[1:19:10] mothers
[1:19:11] and very often that's our common
[1:19:13] mistakes they say results
[1:19:15] are not true because that's why that did
[1:19:17] this come jesus christ
[1:19:33] amen amen brandon continue when i'm
[1:19:36] continuing now
[1:19:37] the greatest man in the land legally
[1:19:41] that was the king facing the greatest
[1:19:45] person in heaven which was god so please
[1:19:59] that was his prophet and he said
[1:20:03] go tell him every day that i've heard
[1:20:06] his
[1:20:06] prayers and i'm going to spare
[1:20:10] him uh him them 15 years
[1:20:14] i call the second zone he's the one who
[1:20:16] asked for 15 years look at the monday
[1:20:19] and god promised to give us the desire
[1:20:20] of our hearts
[1:20:25] whatever your heart desires
[1:20:28] is what god promised to give us
[1:20:42] that the prophet must have been
[1:20:44] embarrassed because the prophet
[1:20:47] saying coming right back
[1:20:50] what are you coming back for prophet
[1:20:54] prophet it was not him it isn't he was
[1:20:57] nobody
[1:20:58] was the
[1:21:12] you
[1:21:26] he's going

[1:22:11] that's the principle the sally principle
[1:22:14] the principle of
[1:22:15] prayer of faith
[1:22:19] after confession confession in the
[1:22:21] divine healing allah
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:47] [Music]

[1:22:52] god said the lord he's gonna die because
[1:22:53] he didn't send you
[1:22:54] the lord he's gonna die but the prayer

[1:26:50] and if you take your bible in isaiah uh
[1:26:53] isaiah 38.
[1:26:57] and after he was healed what does
[1:27:01] ezekiel do
[1:27:02] is a casa
[1:27:27] the writing of hezekiah king of judah
[1:27:30] when he had been sick and was recovered
[1:27:33] of his sickness
[1:27:41] in other versions they said the praises
[1:27:44] of hezekiah
[1:27:45] [Music]
[1:27:48] and what is a character doing
[1:27:51] let us escape to verse 18 verse is
[1:27:54] written he started saying
[1:27:55] god said those people who are in the
[1:27:59] grave say john like
[1:28:01] they cannot come and worship you right
[1:28:04] there is somebody to worship you
[1:28:05] can't do it for whom you have done a
[1:28:09] word
[1:28:12] let me worship you yes for the grave
[1:28:15] cannot praise thee
[1:28:21] death cannot be celebrated
[1:28:25] to celebrate that go down into their
[1:28:27] peace cannot hope for thy truth
[1:28:35] they're living living they're living
[1:28:37] living
[1:28:38] he shall preside
[1:28:47] amen amen
[1:28:50] the father to the children shall make
[1:28:52] known thy truth
[1:29:02] therefore a we will sing my songs
[1:29:06] to the single instruments
[1:29:17] amen amen for isaiah as he said he is
[1:29:40] what is the sign that i shall go up to
[1:29:43] the house of the lord
[1:29:47] if you read uh uh isaiah 38 the
[1:29:50] manchester
[1:30:02] is say that the lamp
[1:30:06] of fig they say the fig
[1:30:09] lamas the fig that was the only thing
[1:30:14] as he prayed he said can you pray yes he
[1:30:16] pray come and please he prayed
[1:30:33] raw in a must defeat just take it use
[1:30:36] the process
[1:30:37] put it where there is the boy
[1:30:41] that's it what produced that yes
[1:30:45] he was the faith of isaac
[1:30:49] yes maybe brother sister with that fairy
[1:30:51] sir you can
[1:30:52] go to see doctors you can go see all
[1:30:55] the witchcraft
[1:30:59] they will tell you drinking
[1:31:15] shows go do this go do this
[1:31:20] that's it a very simple thing he's just
[1:31:22] doing so
[1:31:23] and my point is we have to look for that
[1:31:26] little thing
[1:31:28] but
[1:31:44] in our need we have to ask god under the
[1:31:47] monday
[1:31:48] we have to change different ways
[1:31:52] yeah what shall i do
[1:31:56] what shall i do and if your faith
[1:31:59] is anchored a okay
[1:32:02] and god shows you what you have to do if
[1:32:04] you ever want to sacrifice something
[1:32:06] even if it's hard to say difficile just
[1:32:09] do it it's just a settler why because
[1:32:12] it's the provided way
[1:32:14] of god here
[1:32:18] just go get a lump of figs just a
[1:32:20] laypress defeat
[1:32:23] just a lump of fish just to must the
[1:32:25] figure
[1:32:26] if that's still valid yes it's elected
[1:32:29] to jova leader we will
[1:32:30] we have a found remedy for cancer
[1:32:33] remedy for the medical policy
[1:32:37] but somebody mckelkin
[1:32:43] all the principles through the principle

[1:33:11] margarita
[1:33:15] amen amen so therefore my brothers the
[1:33:18] uncomfortable
[1:33:19] what principle we draw here
[1:33:32] it was a positive attitude in the
[1:33:34] sickness
[1:33:36] in attitude positive malady in your
[1:33:39] condition now what a condition don't
[1:33:42] envy nobody now the young person don't
[1:33:44] blame
[1:33:45] nobody person just have a right mental
[1:33:48] attitude he ain't multitude mental
[1:33:50] correct
[1:33:51] all the time that's the principle
[1:33:54] withdrawal in this case
[1:33:58] yes and they keep that again regardless
[1:34:02] of
[1:34:02] who may be the cause the important
[1:34:04] keypad
[1:34:05] they can say to your auntie cannot

[1:34:09] always the right mental attitude toward
[1:34:11] that auntie
[1:34:14] on their side don't hate that person
[1:34:27] it doesn't matter that's an important
[1:34:28] part of always the right mental attitude
[1:34:38] somebody who doesn't want always to
[1:34:40] discourage you okay give it to you
[1:34:43] negativity important negativity
[1:34:58] confession with tears the confessions
[1:35:00] like the lamb lord what i have
[1:35:02] done in your second your faith was wrong

[1:36:33] principles they are simple if i had the
[1:36:35] principle
