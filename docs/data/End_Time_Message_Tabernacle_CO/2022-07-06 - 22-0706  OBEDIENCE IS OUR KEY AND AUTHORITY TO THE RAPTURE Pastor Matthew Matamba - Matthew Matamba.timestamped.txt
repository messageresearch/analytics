[33:38] [Music]
[33:50] thank you very much sister sharon
[33:52] matamba may god bless you
[33:57] and i want to welcome each and every one
[34:00] of you tonight in the name of the lord
[34:02] jesus christ
[34:11] i don't want to acknowledge each and
[34:13] every one of you i know that um
[34:21] wish you the best and
[34:23] a warm welcome
[34:26] [Music]
[34:29] and i know you some of you have made a
[34:31] lot of sacrifices
[34:37] coming from a different state
[34:43] spend your money for
[34:45] traveling hotel food etc
[34:54] and but i i'm expecting what you are
[34:57] going to receive
[34:58] will be more than what you have spent
[35:10] because even in the bible they are
[35:12] talking about the queen of sheba members
[35:17] when he heard about a special meeting
[35:19] somewhere
[35:20] don't you parliament
[35:23] special gift
[35:25] then don't special
[35:27] she did not stay quiet and nepal stayed
[35:30] from killer
[35:31] she took a lot of risks
[35:34] going through the desert the travis
[35:36] desire where the children of ishmael
[35:39] were there laurie javilison found ismael
[35:42] but let me tell you when god is calling
[35:44] for you for something
[35:48] faith we don't see any obstacles
[35:53] and if it's a real faith it constitutes
[35:55] even foreign
[36:07] that's why the queen of sheba was under
[36:09] such a great expectation
[36:12] grand expectative she went a little
[36:15] party regardless of the risk very
[36:17] importantly she was there elitilla
[36:21] and the brother banham said she did not
[36:23] sleep during the meeting
[36:27] the first night a bastard solomon did
[36:30] not address her needs
[36:36] but she was not discouraged
[36:40] [Music]
[36:52] he
[36:59] [Music]
[37:06] but i
[37:06] guarantee you
[37:07] before the meeting finish
[37:10] god will address your condition
[37:13] condition and that expectation he said
[37:15] that we'll put you under preparation
[37:18] vavvu susan preparation did you come
[37:26] that will bring the manifestation give
[37:28] up
[37:29] manifestation so we thank god for all
[37:32] your sacrifices
[37:35] and this is special services
[37:38] special there should be a special guard
[37:41] a dwarf
[37:42] ngo special to address every special
[37:45] need for a ponder
[37:47] special because he's always a special
[37:49] man
[37:51] amen
[37:52] so
[37:55] during the meetings
[37:58] we will uh have
[38:00] two boxes back there new zealand
[38:11] [Music]
[38:17] so if you came with any question
[38:20] on your heart
[38:23] occur write it down
[38:26] if you want to sign your name that's
[38:29] fine
[38:31] if you don't that's fine also
[38:35] so the way we will do
[38:37] today tomorrow
[38:39] today there will be a
[38:42] pastor matamba
[38:44] from north
[38:54] [Music]
[38:59] ben shamil uh they got a little delay on
[39:02] their way but i think they should be
[39:04] here tomorrow morning god willing
[39:09] with uh pastor david silo
[39:12] pastor david sagar so each one of the
[39:14] speakers checking this writer certainly
[39:17] will
[39:18] say something
[39:20] you may question or you may want a
[39:22] little bit more of light certainly
[39:25] certain choices
[39:38] during the banquet
[39:42] speakers will be addressing the
[39:44] questions
[39:47] because if we will let everybody speak
[39:49] during the banquet with a lot of
[39:51] questions
[39:56] maybe we will not be able to address all
[39:59] the needs
[40:02] but still during the banquet we will be
[40:04] open for some questions
[40:11] but if you can address your question up
[40:13] front i see who will you see uh
[40:17] this way those repetitive questions we
[40:19] will uh eliminate them and address one
[40:27] so the boxes are not here tonight but
[40:30] i'm expecting them to arrive tomorrow

[48:10] v and samuel chapter 15.
[48:13] kenza
[48:26] and we can begin at verse 13.
[48:31] but before we read the bible
[48:34] let's just pray a little
[48:37] eternal god
[48:39] we come before you humbly this afternoon
[48:43] lord in this lovely place
[48:46] where your children have left their
[48:48] homes
[48:50] and many have left their states
[48:53] to come and fellowship around the things
[48:55] of christ
[48:58] and lord it's following my lord to be
[48:59] here this evening
[49:12] and may you prepare the hearts to
[49:14] receive the word
[49:17] [Applause]
[49:19] all the sacrifices that have been put
[49:21] forth to the sacrifice
[49:24] may you reward every child of god a
[49:26] hundred percent
[49:28] conform some people that
[49:30] maybe when we look back to this these
[49:32] services later on
[49:36] we can say it has been good to have been
[49:38] at denver
[49:42] for the services
[49:44] and so lord we commit the reading of the
[49:46] word into your hands
[49:49] may you help us lord adeno we depend on
[49:52] you one hundred percent
[49:55] and we ask this blessing
[49:57] benediction in that great magnificent
[49:59] name of the lord jesus christ
[50:02] amen and amen amen amen
[50:04] so we read from first uh samuel chapter
[50:07] 15.
[50:11] beginning at verse 13
[50:14] and samuel came to saul and saul said
[50:16] unto him blessed be thou of the lord i
[50:19] have performed the commandment of the
[50:21] lord
[50:28] and samuel said what meaneth then this
[50:31] bleeding of the sheep in mine ears
[50:34] and the lowing of the oxen which i hear
[50:37] is
[50:43] and saul said they have brought them
[50:45] from the amalekites for the people
[50:48] spared the best of the sheep and of the
[50:50] oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god
[50:54] and the rest we have utterly destroyed
[50:59] this
[51:04] sacrifice
[51:08] then samuel said unto saul
[51:10] stay and i will tell thee what the lord
[51:13] have said to me this night and he said
[51:16] unto him say on islam
[51:25] and samuel said when thou was little in
[51:28] thine own sight
[51:30] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[51:32] of israel and the lord anointed the king
[51:35] over israel
[51:44] israel
[51:45] and the lord sent thee on a journey and
[51:47] said go and utterly destroy the sinners
[51:49] the amalekites and fight against them
[51:51] until they be consumed
[52:03] where for then did thou not obey the
[52:06] voice of the lord but did fly upon the
[52:10] spoil and its evil in the sight of the
[52:12] lord
[52:20] and saul said unto samuel yea i have
[52:23] obeyed the voice of the lord
[52:26] and have gone the way which the lord
[52:28] sent me and have brought agg the king of
[52:32] amalek and have utterly destroyed their
[52:34] malachites
[52:47] but the people took of the spoiled sheep
[52:50] and oxen the chief of the things which
[52:53] should have been utterly destroyed to
[52:55] sacrifice unto the lord thy god in
[52:58] gilgal
[53:08] and samuel said hath the lord as great
[53:11] delight in burnt offerings and
[53:14] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[53:17] the lord
[53:18] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[53:22] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[53:25] summer d letter
[53:37] may the lord bless the reading of his
[53:39] word you may be seated
[53:52] our key to adoption and authority notre
[53:55] claire paula dobson

[54:18] making the rapture
[54:21] praise the name of the
[54:22] lord see when this thought came to me
[54:27] i was going to title it
[54:30] obedience
[54:33] your key to adoption authority and the
[54:36] rapture voter
[54:40] but then the holy spirit said
[54:42] you have to change that
[54:45] don't say your key need pervertedly say
[54:48] our ki
[54:54] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[54:56] lord
[54:58] so obedience
[55:00] we're talking about family
[55:02] for me now family and family was
[55:04] instituted by god institute about you
[55:07] and family
[55:09] is really the nucleus
[55:13] that's where
[55:14] everything is learned
[55:18] that's where children are conceived
[55:23] that's where children are born
[55:26] that's where children are raised
[55:31] that's where children learn
[55:34] are you with me
[55:36] and so in order to have a strong church
[55:41] in bonnie gleason
[55:43] we need to have strong families
[55:46] [Applause]
[55:47] and in order to have a strong family
[55:49] people avoid the family up we
[55:51] need strong churches
[55:54] see they are interdependent
[55:58] are you with me
[56:00] the prophet says when you see the
[56:01] confusion amongst the people
[56:05] it's weak pulpits
[56:09] is that right
[56:10] and when you see
[56:12] the the people the prophet says a man of
[56:14] god comes there
[56:18] and has the word of the lord
[56:21] and the people neglect to pay attention
[56:26] it's not juvenile delinquency
[56:57] you have an absolute is that right
[57:00] he said the absolute of the nation is
[57:02] the supreme court
[57:06] we may not like their decision
[57:10] but we have to abide by it
[57:14] because that's the nation's absolute
[57:16] best question
[57:18] are you with me
[57:20] and the prophet says
[57:22] because when a nation coincides losers
[57:25] faith and respect in their constitution
[57:31] constitution that nation is gone
[57:36] he says if a church did he see
[57:38] negligence loses respect for its pastor
[57:44] that church is gone
[57:47] if a family sin for me loses respect for
[57:51] the parent spell respect
[58:01] these are key elements in a family so
[58:04] it's only
[58:05] associated with the name of the lawyer
[58:32] [Music]
[58:33] in first corinthians chapter 11.
[58:37] the bible says that the hair is a
[58:39] covering
[58:43] to a woman is that right
[58:46] now listen to the prophet
[58:48] he says
[59:15] be your followers of me so i am as
[59:18] imitator even as i am of christ come
[59:21] jesus
[59:23] amen amen now there had to be obedience
[59:28] to the apostles
[59:30] some people in the days of paul certain
[59:32] person
[59:34] did not recognize the authority the
[59:36] apostolic authority of powell
[59:41] who is the guy
[59:43] he's in jail
[59:58] see
[1:00:12] the word of god
[1:00:14] not as the word of a man comely
[1:00:17] hallelujah hallelujah god is a mystery
[1:00:21] and god is so great
[1:00:24] but he can humble himself maybe
[1:00:38] then he can't make him small anymore
[1:00:43] he can make himself small anymore
[1:00:47] he stays big he'll let the god he want
[1:00:49] to sit like this
[1:00:51] he wants when he walks in for everybody
[1:01:08] speak to the name of the lord
[1:01:11] he says the man that was just converted
[1:01:13] last night
[1:01:17] a drunkard that was just converted
[1:01:21] in the sight of god he is just the same
[1:01:25] as the greatest minister
[1:01:28] [Applause]
[1:01:31] are you with me
[1:01:32] so man gets big and can't get back
[1:01:36] but god can get himself so small
[1:01:40] oh hallelujah hallelujah he says be
[1:01:42] followers of me
[1:01:45] as i am of christ
[1:01:48] so you see paul was under the authority
[1:01:50] of christ
[1:01:54] then he was requiring for the church to
[1:01:57] obey the word
[1:02:01] because he himself must remember was
[1:02:03] obedient to the to the word of christ
[1:02:08] and so now the prophet says this prophet
[1:02:10] this is he says no i praise you brethren
[1:02:15] i praise you because you remember me in
[1:02:17] all things
[1:02:32] is christ
[1:02:36] the head of every man is christ
[1:02:40] a christian
[1:02:41] and the head of the woman is the man
[1:02:44] he'll accept the affair
[1:02:47] the head of christ is god hey
[1:02:51] this is a jew
[1:02:52] amen amen the head of every man is
[1:02:55] christ
[1:02:58] the head of every woman is the man
[1:03:03] he says see how it is
[1:03:06] god dear
[1:03:08] christ
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:13] amen amen god you
[1:03:16] christ easter
[1:03:18] men lumber woman elopham
[1:03:22] amen amen oh we want these things to
[1:03:24] sink deep
[1:03:28] i've talked to people
[1:03:31] they live in africa in viva africa and
[1:03:34] they want to send their daughter to
[1:03:37] america
[1:03:39] on america and they want to send her to
[1:03:42] france
[1:03:56] but they want to send this young lady
[1:03:58] villa voices
[1:04:01] and she has no authority
[1:04:06] says i got enough money
[1:04:09] you go and find an apartment
[1:04:12] and you live in that apartment
[1:04:17] that is lack of wisdom
[1:04:20] now these things that i say and they
[1:04:22] show
[1:04:23] brother neville
[1:04:24] i just speak as they come to me
[1:04:27] and uh i know maybe somebody following
[1:04:29] the tape might say who is the guy
[1:04:35] let me say that
[1:04:37] because they might help someone
[1:04:40] who is humble enough to pick it up
[1:04:44] it's not right
[1:04:47] to send a daughter alone
[1:04:51] away no
[1:05:02] may god help us get you said because
[1:05:06] no woman basket or kunufam
[1:05:09] can live without a head bow vivre so's
[1:05:12] in detail
[1:05:13] she has to have a head el dora avoir
[1:05:16] dead
[1:05:17] her head
[1:05:20] is her father ceson pere is that right
[1:05:23] correct
[1:05:24] when she leaves that house kyle kitty
[1:05:27] said
[1:05:28] and is married elle maria her head
[1:05:33] is her husband says so marie we just had
[1:05:35] a wedding in charlotte
[1:05:39] and after the ceremony was said
[1:05:43] the veil was taken off and the lady put
[1:05:45] the veil over the man
[1:06:07] is that right it's correct but if a
[1:06:09] child has to go to america
[1:06:13] then you know there is a man in denver
[1:06:30] but could you advise me what to do where
[1:06:32] she could live
[1:06:36] and and papa foster will say hey papa
[1:06:38] foster

[1:06:41] house

[1:07:02] the one to decide get your vote
[1:07:07] obey him the way you would operate
[1:07:11] hallelujah
[1:07:13] the church of the living god
[1:07:15] hallelujah needs to know these things
[1:07:17] legally
[1:07:19] there is something connected if there is
[1:07:21] a responsible man in town see i ain't
[1:07:23] not responsible for fostering will say
[1:07:26] brother
[1:07:53] is going to have that temporary
[1:07:55] authority or headship over here
[1:08:00] hallelujah hallelujah what are we
[1:08:03] looking for
[1:08:05] we send kids anywhere
[1:08:08] and we don't even monitor what happens
[1:08:10] there
[1:08:12] are they even attending church we don't
[1:08:14] know
[1:08:16] oh god help us
[1:08:18] there's got to be authority
[1:08:21] you've got to be hatred
[1:08:34] does that mean that the woman is
[1:08:35] inferior to a man
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:50] my
[1:09:03] because the prophet said that
[1:09:06] if you say that means the woman is
[1:09:08] inferior to man
[1:09:12] then you would have to say that christ
[1:09:14] is inferior to god
[1:09:19] are you with me
[1:09:21] it has nothing to do with inferiorities
[1:09:25] it has to do
[1:09:27] with the great eternal wisdom of god
[1:09:34] and we will see god and christ are one
[1:09:37] jail
[1:09:40] a man and his wife are one the lord may
[1:09:42] suffer
[1:09:43] now in two different bodies don't do it
[1:09:46] god defeat christ and god are one
[1:09:49] christian
[1:09:51] in one body
[1:09:53] a man and his wife are one lord made a
[1:09:55] firm son uh in two different bodies
[1:09:58] hallelujah hallelujah no no
[1:10:13] he said the glory that i had with you
[1:10:15] before
[1:10:19] he prayed that that glory would be with
[1:10:21] us
[1:10:24] the oneness that he had with the father
[1:10:28] that's the same oneness he wants to have
[1:10:29] with us
[1:10:32] and in saint john 14 20
[1:10:36] he said at that day
[1:10:38] you'll know
[1:10:40] i am in the father
[1:10:42] father it means
[1:10:56] hallelujah
[1:11:24] my god separated the the
[1:11:26] the he he took a rib off of the man
[1:11:31] made another body here
[1:11:33] and he took the feminist part of the
[1:11:35] spirit of the man in the woman
[1:11:41] and all that was portraying christ and
[1:11:43] the church
[1:11:45] the majestic paul says it's a mystery

[1:55:44] finally he was there
[1:55:47] and the prophet says
[1:55:48] isaac was about 16.

[1:55:55] kill him
[1:55:56] oh brother sister sir
[1:56:38] he lives by his eternal life
[1:56:55] we ought to stop and think
[1:56:58] abraham loved god abraham i met you
[1:57:01] he was going to sacrifice his begotten
[1:57:04] son
[1:57:09] because he loved god
[1:57:11] he limits you above all things
[1:57:16] produces obedience
[1:57:19] amen amen if a woman really loves her
[1:57:21] husband
[1:57:31] i wouldn't want my wife to obey me on
[1:57:33] that kind of ground
[1:57:34] pakistan
[1:57:36] no no no no no no no i'd rather live
[1:57:38] alone in some places
[1:57:41] i have to beg for something
[1:57:46] to do i'm going to tell you the pastor
[1:57:47] is your daughter
[1:57:48] my wife she has to say but i still dear
[1:57:50] my family
[1:58:02] follow her example swiss an example she
[1:58:05] loved her husband ella miso marie she
[1:58:07] called him milo
[1:58:10] who told sarah to do that
[1:58:14] hey man amen who told her where did she
[1:58:17] read that
[1:58:18] question but you have read it
[1:58:21] metwatchulalu
[1:58:23] you have been told that on that diesel
[1:58:25] you have been preached that on that
[1:58:27] priscilla but you don't want to do it
[1:58:30] remember
[1:58:32] obedience
[1:58:46] god never puts a word in his bible in
[1:58:48] his message that's idle and every word
[1:58:50] is important
[1:58:57] brother told me
[1:58:58] oh brother matamba you know
[1:59:08] this particular sister came to see me
[1:59:10] said uh
[1:59:12] and she was speaking in lingala
[1:59:14] you can interpret
[1:59:26] my lord
[1:59:27] lies a lot
[1:59:30] now you see me
[1:59:33] the prophet says
[1:59:41] if a man lives the life
[1:59:57] that man
[2:00:00] because god asked you the reason he
[2:00:02] requires obedience
[2:00:05] god is a god of order
[2:00:10] a friend told me and
[2:00:12] at one time the dictator mubutu he had
[2:00:14] all the university students to go to the
[2:00:16] army
[2:00:21] amen
[2:00:22] and he said to them
[2:00:24] said
[2:00:27] you become soldiers who defended the
[2:00:28] soldier
[2:00:29] and uh my friend was telling me he must
[2:00:31] have me
[2:00:32] then the commandment would come down
[2:00:37] move this way
[2:00:53] in the army
[2:00:55] orders are not argued about on a
[2:00:58] discrete passion
[2:00:59] orders are executed
[2:01:04] but we want to understand why
[2:01:12] all the thinking has already been done
[2:01:15] for you
[2:01:19] all you have to do is execute this
[2:01:21] question
[2:01:23] and all the thinking about the word has
[2:01:25] already been done
[2:01:28] [Applause]
[2:01:30] and when god speaks
[2:01:33] it's to execute
[2:01:48] [Applause]
[2:01:52] and so in that symphony in that harmony
[2:01:54] and she doesn't sit simply don't say
[2:01:56] termini
[2:01:57] god has a man
[2:02:00] to give instruction to his family
[2:02:16] god gave a little
[2:02:18] discernment a little extra discernment
[2:02:20] to men than to the wife
