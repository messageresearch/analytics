[25:03] i would like to speak now atua group
[25:05] there are two three groups no petition
[25:07] for our little children no pagan our
[25:10] mothers in the mail um our mothers
[25:21] now the first steps you probably have
[25:23] taken in your life
[25:26] speaking of leadership
[25:40] tonight
[25:43] tonight
[25:48] are they out here some cemetery
[25:50] somewhere
[25:56] but that was the hand that held you to
[25:59] make the first step
[26:04] then after mother taught you how to walk
[26:08] and you make you a few steps
[26:10] and then you fall down
[26:12] and get up evo
[26:16] la grande shoes and you thought you were
[26:18] doing great things
[26:20] then
[26:22] alameda
[26:39] and what you must learn how sweet the
[26:41] sweet comes up and so forth like that
[26:44] what i'm saying
[26:46] remember
[26:49] the first step that you ever made in
[26:51] life
[26:53] it's probably because of the mother
[26:55] that was holding your hand
[26:57] of course they said mama and because of
[27:00] their mothers
[27:02] then you learn how to walk
[27:18] and remember
[27:40] if somebody could just be breeding bro
[27:42] branham i caused the surveillance
[27:46] because of
[28:00] and the god of glory were granted
[28:02] in the leadership
[28:04] the
[28:05] minister of sanctions 1965.
[28:09] uh 31st of october 31st
[28:14] listen to what brother branham says
[28:34] paragraph paragraph 27
[28:42] is
[28:53] let's start from paragraph nine
[29:02] listen carefully to what the prophet
[29:03] says
[29:10] paragraph 10
[29:16] [Music]
[29:24] he does
[29:27] and there was a little boy in the fandom
[29:29] memories one time a name
[29:33] we're going to talk about him in just a
[29:35] little bit
[29:36] and it was a very fine
[29:45] you know what made him help him uh
[29:47] him a fine boy
[29:52] he had a good mother to raise him
[29:54] you seen cesar and that's what an
[29:57] alliance with she taught him see the
[30:00] lesson here about the lord amen
[30:34] to teach you about the lord
[30:36] just listen to them
[30:39] they could the children are you
[30:41] listening
[30:44] that's the greater the great prophet
[30:46] advice
[30:50] you have the same kind of mothers uh
[30:52] like onto moses
[30:55] but the key is
[30:57] just mind them or listen to them effort
[31:01] i'm saying
[31:45] is to the children they suffer from did
[31:48] you know that
[31:50] elijah anfa you say the children
[31:54] obey your parents
[31:57] which may lengthen the days upon you
[32:00] upon the earth
[32:03] that the lord thy god
[32:05] has given thee
[32:08] that to mind your parents their first
[32:10] sacrifice
[32:12] and to do what you're doing
[32:15] in the
[32:16] longest
[32:18] and it may give you
[32:20] it may give you longer life upon the
[32:22] earth
[32:24] that the lord has given you more time to
[32:26] on earth to serve him
[32:31] and that's the reason why you always
[32:33] need to bring your children to church in
[32:35] the tribe on the shows it is a good
[32:37] thing
[32:39] i'm saying
[32:54] but church cannot fail

[33:00] home education can fail
[33:03] i know a lot of people
[33:06] are born without their parents
[33:36] the marty the folks and the book of my
[33:39] matter of facts
[33:44] what your children are listening finally
[33:46] what your children are reading
[33:50] influences the character
[33:55] today
