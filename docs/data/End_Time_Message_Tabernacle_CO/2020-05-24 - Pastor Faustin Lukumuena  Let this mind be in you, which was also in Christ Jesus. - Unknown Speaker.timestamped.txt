[1:25:31] Philip I which Paul visited in Philippa
[1:25:34] Coppola visit a was a Roman colony
[1:25:37] founded by August's today in colony
[1:25:40] herrmann ET k APPA August's so the

[1:26:00] founded his the first congregation who a
[1:26:02] KS up a mere eglise yeah so this is just
[1:26:05] to give you a quick overview of what we
[1:26:08] are going to talk about the Philippians
[1:26:11] my losses register pou human have open
[1:26:13] and paleta blue ii owes an apology Oh
[1:26:15] Philip among the different places of
[1:26:18] Paul visited family difference on worker
[1:26:20] policy a Philip I Philippa was one of
[1:26:24] the city that were all added the
[1:26:27] greatest challenge the tail and a veil
[1:26:30] of polygons defeat the biggest
[1:26:33] resistance lagoon resistance and that
[1:26:36] was the place where Christianity
[1:26:40] directly brought in conflict with a
[1:26:42] pagan ISM was the Philip I a loss allow
[1:26:45] allocation dat Vermont miss on first
[1:26:47] Japan
[1:26:48] velocity velocity a Philippe so that
[1:26:52] this is very important because as we
[1:26:56] have this in our background in a local
[1:26:58] peasant Porter communist IV&V not
[1:27:00] passing this is important to understand
[1:27:04] now how and why Paul wrote this to the
[1:27:08] Philip I who are in kukuczka Paul a sec
[1:27:12] awfully bro
[1:27:13] so Philip I was a place of biggest
[1:27:15] challenge for the Apostle Paul enough
[1:27:18] ellipse had done on what if harmonic
[1:27:20] grande they bowed at the honk intestine
[1:27:22] and if you can recall when we spoke we
[1:27:27] read the book of Thessalonians and
[1:27:30] awesome Buddha souvenir columns I
[1:27:31] believe and it is our witness here this
[1:27:35] is Bible studies we want to take our
[1:27:38] time to search through the scriptures
[1:27:41] I love the section it would be bleak
[1:27:43] another lump on another Tampopo where he
[1:27:45] got a little yes but the Bible study is
[1:27:47] a very important we've lived it will be
[1:27:50] bleak shiver matras important many
[1:27:53] denominations beaucoup de denomination
[1:27:55] they don't have the books from the
[1:27:58] Prophet in one nor the Prophet in on
[1:28:00] Polly liver the Prophet Enoch honest
[1:28:02] event they study really the
[1:28:04] Bible in a certain way is it reliever
[1:28:07] malady pledge insulting money so
[1:28:09] therefore you cannot challenge them with
[1:28:11] the Bible a lot of room to vapor
[1:28:13] formally Divya vac libel but I believe
[1:28:15] we can because we have the Bible plus a
[1:28:19] cannula proven Pascal news I won't lose
[1:28:21] a lab develop political control so in
[1:28:24] our first test alone Ian's allowed on
[1:28:26] intensive initia we read the chapter two
[1:28:29] novel Alicia Peter verse 1 and 2 verse a
[1:28:33] and Paul was saying Polly DJ for
[1:28:37] yourself brother
[1:28:38] oh no our entrance into you that it was
[1:28:44] not in vain not on humility Runa by
[1:28:48] Deven but even after that we had
[1:28:52] suffered before and were shamefully
[1:28:57] entreated as you know at Phillip I
[1:29:00] oppressive work OPA
[1:29:02] so fairy of wa ato Putrajaya Filippo
[1:29:05] so you see here dissing onions I love
[1:29:09] worship Allah keep aren t seven easier
[1:29:12] he's telling them or we enter to you
[1:29:15] Nakano some veneer vu but we were
[1:29:18] shamefully entreated as you know at
[1:29:21] Philip our main news evolve Rama idiot
[1:29:24] Regina Filippo we were we we suffered at
[1:29:29] Filipinos evolve Rama Saphira Filippo so
[1:29:32] Philip I was a place where Paul received
[1:29:35] the biggest challenge and say a syllable
[1:29:38] a loophole as commercial on TV what
[1:29:40] happened in Philippi and cascade are
[1:29:43] either Philippe when Paul went to preach
[1:29:45] the gospel and Polly party Priscilla
[1:29:47] Vaughn she faced resistance in labor in
[1:29:50] FFA salary system of the Jews the river
[1:29:53] and many religious and traditions who
[1:29:55] could a religion a tradition and even
[1:29:58] witchcraft
[1:29:59] mmm Adela so celery sources dissociate
[1:30:03] all these people came and the challenge
[1:30:05] appalled at Philip I a lot to say
[1:30:07] Johnson when UFA on feed Afiya policy
[1:30:09] leap that's what Paul is referring say
[1:30:12] brother you know how painful we've
[1:30:14] suffered not Philip pylori deserves
[1:30:16] every comments canoes are used to
[1:30:18] failure Filippo
[1:30:19] so I want you to I want to tell you what
[1:30:22] was the suffering of Paul at Philippi a
[1:30:24] large everybody say - koalas response
[1:30:26] the Paula Filippo let us take the Bible
