[0:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[0:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[0:03] sound the mystery of God should be
[0:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[0:08] servants the
[0:14] prophets but I tell you one thing when
[0:16] you're born again you birds of a
[0:21] feather Hall someone asked said brother
[0:25] R you told them people going back to
[0:26] Method Church I said sure let them throw
[0:28] them out they had no place to go
[0:31] so so go on back won't be very long you
[0:34] see won't be they'll be right back again
[0:38] you know one time in the ark a place of
[0:41] safety Noah there was a big flood come
[0:43] and so Noah turned the crow out of the
[0:46] Ark and he just went off calling and
[0:48] looking around well he was satisfied cuz
[0:50] he was a vulture to begin with he could
[0:52] fly from one old dead carcus need a
[0:54] belly full off of this mule and go down
[0:56] this this old sheep need a belly full
[0:59] off of him and something else was just
[1:00] all kind of old dead carcasses laying
[1:02] around so the crow just sit down there
[1:04] car around boy I'm having me a jubilee
[1:07] all by myself just calling away but when
[1:09] they turn the little Dove out he's a
[1:12] different
[1:13] nature that stink he couldn't
[1:16] stand why a dove hasn't got any Gall
[1:19] he's the only bird that doesn't have a
[1:21] gall he couldn't digest it so the only
[1:23] thing he can do get right back to the
[1:25] ark and beat on the
[1:28] door it's going anywhere you want to
[1:31] only thing I'm asking you to do is just
[1:32] come into the
[1:33] kingdom I know where you'll
[1:36] go you won't be able to stand it anymore
[1:39] brother you're say I've crossed a
[1:41] separating line I've left this world
[1:43] behind
