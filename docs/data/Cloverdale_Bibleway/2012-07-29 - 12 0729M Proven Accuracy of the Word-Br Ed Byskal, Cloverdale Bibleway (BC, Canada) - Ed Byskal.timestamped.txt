[15:11] that the Lord would be a strength and a
[15:12] comfort to them during this time. Why
[15:15] don't we just lift them up as if we were
[15:18] in their shoes. Amen. And I appreciate
[15:20] our brother Dersonson. There's something

[24:21] up here. I pray that you'll worship with
[24:23] us. It's one thing that um we start
[24:26] here.
[24:27] Worship take it right into eternity.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Crosses over to both sides.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; So we might as well get started now.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; This song is called Worship is Forever.
[25:15] Worship is free.
[25:19] Worship is everlasting.
[25:22] Worship will cross from this life to
[25:27] eternity.
[25:29] Mountains may crumble
[25:32] and fall into the sea,
[25:36] but worship
[25:39] forever.
[25:43] Wonderful
[25:46] to worship.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Counselor
[25:53] worship the Lord.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Mighty God
[26:00] everlasting father
[26:04] worship
[26:05] is
[26:07] forever.
[26:10] Worship is right.
[26:14] Worship is complete.
[26:17] Worship will pass through the veil to
[26:22] eternity. He cast off your shackles
[26:27] and set your spirit free
[26:30] for you were born
[26:33] to worship.
[26:37] Prince of peace.
[26:39] Want to worship
[26:42] worship
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; I want to worship the Lord.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; So we just rose
[26:52] &gt;&gt; praise him
[26:54] of the valley.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Worship his
[27:00] forever.
[27:02] And it would take forever to start to
[27:06] find the words to tell one part of just
[27:10] the least of what he's done for you and
[27:13] me.
[27:16] And I would find a million times too few
[27:19] to sing the half of all the praise he's
[27:22] due. Though twice of every word of it
[27:26] were true.
[27:33] Worship is free.
[27:46] Mountains may crumble and fall into the
[27:51] sea,
[27:52] but worship
[27:54] is forever.
[28:01] It's in your soul. It's in your hands.
[28:04] It's in your hopes. Your dreams are
[28:07] planned. It's in your heart. It's in
[28:10] your mind. It's in the things you leave
[28:13] behind. It's in your eyes. It's on your
[28:16] face. It's what you shine and you
[28:19] embrace. The atmosphere your life
[28:23] creates. Everything communicates.
[28:27] It's how you work. It's how you play.
[28:30] It's how you live. From day to day, it's
[28:33] what you see. It's what you hear. It's
[28:36] what you let your heart come here. It's
[28:40] what you show. It's what you see. It's
[28:43] in and out and
[28:46] you dress. It's what you wear. Even how
[28:50] you wear your heads. Every look, every
[28:54] phrase showing something should be
[28:58] praised.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Every word, every deed, shine a light.
[29:03] And so,
[29:05] it's how you serve. It's how you pray.
[29:08] It's how you give your life away. It's
[29:12] how you talk. It's how you sing. Worship
[29:16] covers everything. covers everything.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Worship covers everything.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Worship is forever.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Worship covers everything.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Worship is
[29:35] forever.

[34:47] completely.
[34:50] I'll serve you ally
[34:56] with all my
[34:59] heart.
[35:14] You faithfully supply my needs.
[35:19] according to your plan.
[35:23] So help me Lord to seek your face before
[35:28] I seek your help
[35:32] and trust you know what's best for me
[35:37] when I don't understand
[35:47] and follow in obedience
[35:51] in every circumstance.
[36:04] With all my
[36:07] heart
[36:10] I want to love you, Lord,
[36:14] and live my life
[36:18] each day to know you more.
[36:23] All that is in me
[36:27] is yours
[36:29] completely.
[36:32] I'll serve you holy
[36:37] with all my heart.
[36:43] I want to love you, Lord, and give my
[36:49] life
[36:51] each day to know you more.
[36:56] All that is in me
[37:00] is yours
[37:02] completely.
[37:05] I'll serve you all
[37:15] with all my
[37:19] heart.
[37:36] too.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Wonderful day.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Sun is shining.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; To all you visitors, we want you to see
[37:47] the sun shines here on occasion.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; We've been enjoying it. Thank you,
[37:51] Father.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Shine on.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a good day whenever we
[37:58] can come into his presence and come to
[38:00] worship as the a whole family sang. I'm
[38:04] going to have you stand and uh I I want
[38:08] to sing that chorus, brother Ryan. Uh
[38:11] you are my everything. I thought of
[38:14] something that should just express
[38:16] what's in our hearts this morning. And I
[38:19] trusted something that's in your heart.
[38:21] Sister Biscll and I were just speaking
[38:23] on the way to the service this morning.
[38:27] She was just commenting. It's amazing
[38:29] how one thing, one
[38:34] event, one happening, just one
[38:37] occurrence in a person's life and
[38:40] there's something about it. You don't
[38:41] know exactly why, but it it it registers
[38:45] with you so profoundly
[38:48] that it's there for the rest of your
[38:50] life. And and Sister Biscll was just
[38:54] relating when she was a girl,
[38:58] uh perhaps 12 or 13 years old. She
[39:01] doesn't even recall exactly, but she
[39:04] remembers exactly the church. It was a
[39:07] Lutheran church, a little church in
[39:10] Dawson Creek. And a pastor, a minister's
[39:13] wife sang a special.
[39:16] And she said that special just
[39:20] uh it was as though it was indelibly
[39:23] marked upon her her own heart and mind.
[39:27] And whenever she sings it and sings it,
[39:30] I suppose to herself. said, "Whenever I
[39:33] sing those words," is that I see that
[39:35] woman. I can remember her just as clear
[39:38] as it was yesterday. I see the glory of
[39:41] God shining on her face. We don't know
[39:44] anything about her. All we know is she
[39:47] was certainly a daughter of God. And she
[39:49] conveyed something and she sang
[39:52] something of uh the I believe that
[39:55] you're all the all all the world to me
[39:57] or something like that. I just forget
[39:59] the song, but it's a song that's
[40:02] remembered forever. And I have been
[40:04] thinking the last few days because uh we
[40:09] were invited to
[40:11] Joseph Hildbrand's
[40:13] uh gathering, had a gathering for his
[40:15] birthday, 16th birthday. God bless you,
[40:18] brother Joseph. And it's wonderful to be
[40:21] 16.
[40:22] I wish I was there. I'd have a whole
[40:25] life. I'd just say, "Follow me, Joseph.
[40:27] if I'm on my way here to serve God. Now,
[40:30] I've had a few years experience and uh
[40:34] so I wrote in this card the scripture
[40:37] and I've written it in perhaps many of
[40:39] your Bibles.
[40:41] I received many letters from my father.
[40:44] He would write me generally once a
[40:46] month. We were apart for much of our
[40:49] lives and I was just a boy. Uh, and
[40:54] whenever f father wanted my attention,
[40:57] he would use my full name, Edward.
[41:00] And he was a great handwriter and he
[41:03] wrote in my this letter to me and he he
[41:07] said, "Edward,
[41:09] always pray that God will reveal himself
[41:13] to you." And he put John 14:21.
[41:19] He that hath my commandments and loveth
[41:22] me, he will be loved of my father, and
[41:26] we will come and I'll manifest myself to
[41:28] him." And I tell you what, I never
[41:30] forgot the truth of that. That was
[41:33] branded, that one event branded my
[41:35] heart. So I prayed just before I stood
[41:37] up here. I said, "Lord, let something of
[41:41] the songs that have been sung, let
[41:44] something of the word that will now be
[41:47] preached, let it brand somebody's life.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Let it be eternally there. Let it be
[41:53] something born on the wings of a dove.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Spirit bring it to you.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let it be lifechanging.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it be me. Hallelujah.
[42:05] Hallelujah. Just before we sing, I want
[42:08] to also remind you that this la next
[42:11] Friday will be the last prayer meeting
[42:13] before the camp. And brother Kyle has
[42:16] had it on his heart uh and sent me an
[42:19] email and I just felt a real witness.
[42:21] Brother Kyle, you had the mind of God.
[42:24] We'll have the prayer service in the in
[42:26] the fellowship room to make room for
[42:29] everyone. I think that all young people
[42:32] as well that are going to participate in
[42:34] the camp and everyone because we're
[42:37] we're in great expectation and I believe
[42:40] that God is going to not move just
[42:43] because it's camp but we because we set
[42:45] ourselves aside we're giving these days
[42:48] we're giving this time forget all the
[42:50] world and all the other activities that
[42:52] we have to be engaged in and let's join
[42:56] together in prayer and I believe that
[42:57] God will honor that so we'll have it so
[43:00] we have sufficient room in the
[43:02] fellowship room 7:30 on Friday evening
[43:07] and God bless you also
[43:11] uh nice to see brother Mike and sister
[43:14] Debbie Gier Satan has really given
[43:16] brother Mike a real uh difficult time
[43:20] for the last little while uh we want to
[43:24] talk about battles we also want to talk
[43:27] about victories
[43:28] &gt;&gt; and Brother Mike even had some
[43:30] pneumonia, but we're glad he's here this
[43:32] morning. They missed a number of
[43:34] meetings, but I just felt uh I would
[43:36] have had sister Debbie give this
[43:38] testimony. I don't know all the details,
[43:40] but there were a number of things and v
[43:43] various tests that she's had recently.
[43:45] And one of them was her liver. And her
[43:48] liver was had a very very high count,
[43:51] very high count, 150ome, I believe,
[43:54] orund right up around 150. and and from
[43:59] the one test to the next test, it went
[44:02] down 90 points. And that was
[44:04] supernatural. So, Sister Debbie, we're
[44:07] going to talk about victories and we're
[44:09] going to thank God. It's one thing to
[44:12] have requests and have prayers. It's the
[44:14] next thing to say, "He's done something
[44:15] for me." And we're going to give him all
[44:18] the glory.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, we went to a doctor."
[44:21] That's your That's irrelevant. Doctors
[44:24] don't heal. God heals. Hallelujah. Isn't
[44:27] that the right? Isn't that the truth?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; And you certainly can clap, Brother
[44:33] Gonzalez. Hallelujah.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Ricardo, Sister Buffy.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:44] Cancer's gone.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; I read another testimony this morning
[44:50] which I just read. Some of you people
[44:52] are visiting this morning. A brother's
[44:54] in a serious car accident just a few
[44:57] months ago in Switzerland. He's from
[44:59] Germany and they put a pin in his leg
[45:03] and his leg was short, substantially
[45:05] short. I think about 2.9
[45:08] cm or something and God healed him
[45:12] instantly and his leg is exactly the
[45:14] same length as the other one. And he
[45:16] just said, "I don't know how that rod
[45:19] lengthened, but it's the same length."
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We give all the glory
[45:24] to our Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[45:27] You are my everything. Lead it out for
[45:30] us.
[45:34] You are all
[45:37] lifted up.
[45:40] Everything
[45:43] both great and small.
[45:47] He gave himself for me.
[45:52] Everything.
[45:55] He is my everything.
[46:00] My will.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear everyone now.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; He is my everything.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; He is my
[46:12] Lord. He
[46:13] &gt;&gt; is my everything.
[46:17] both great and small.
[46:22] He did himself for me.
[46:30] He is my everything.
[46:38] Let's just tell him about it.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Oh lovely Lord Jesus, you are our
[46:44] everything. Not only for those that are
[46:47] gathered here within the sanctuary and
[46:48] within this building, but those that are
[46:50] streaming and there are many of them
[46:52] from the different countries, whether it
[46:54] be Germany or Switzerland or Norway or
[46:56] New Zealand or over in Singapore. Lord,
[46:59] how we love the people and they write in
[47:02] and encourage us. We bless them in the
[47:04] name of Jesus Christ. We have them join
[47:07] with us and not only in song, but now as
[47:10] we turn to the word. And we are lovers
[47:12] of your word. Lord, we love your word.
[47:15] We love this message. You sent it to us.
[47:18] You called us to it. You called us by
[47:20] it. And now we just pray that you'll
[47:22] bless this group of people that are
[47:24] here. How I thank you for each one of
[47:26] them. Y Let your bride, the bride of
[47:29] Jesus Christ, which your word has
[47:32] declared through the mighty Apostle
[47:33] Paul, it's one bread. We are one bread.
[47:37] Hallelujah. We are one bread. And we
[47:40] will profess that and claim that. Oh
[47:42] God, not only within this building, but
[47:44] the bride of Jesus Christ, wherever they
[47:47] are gathered, we give testimony that the
[47:50] bride of Jesus Christ is one bread.
[47:52] Glory to God. And we've been called
[47:55] under a ministry as your prophet has
[47:57] declared his ministry was to bring the
[48:00] people together. Father, I just pray in
[48:02] the name of Jesus Christ, there'll be
[48:04] such a baptism of the Holy Spirit and a
[48:07] refilling of the Holy Ghost and a
[48:09] rededication and a commitment, oh God,
[48:12] such as we've never experienced. We
[48:14] thank you, Father. Now, come and let
[48:16] your word be spoken as you would have it
[48:18] spoken. In Jesus' name we ask it and for
[48:22] his glory alone we pray. Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bible,
[48:27] please, to John the first chapter.
[48:38] And we'll read from verse one to verse
[48:41] four.
[48:43] A very familiar chapter and very
[48:45] familiar verses. In the beginning was
[48:47] the word and the word was with God and
[48:51] the word was God. The same was in the
[48:54] beginning with God.
[48:57] All things were made by him.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And without him was not was not
[49:02] anything made that was made. In him was
[49:06] life, and the life was the light of man.
[49:10] Amen. You may be seated.
[49:19] I really appreciate you giving me your
[49:22] all and full attention
[49:25] and have just as little movement as
[49:27] possible.
[49:29] so it doesn't distract others.
[49:34] Sometimes we have something on our heart
[49:36] that is
[49:38] uh really ponderous and I think perhaps
[49:41] this is perhaps ponderous. I'm going to
[49:44] pray that God will give you
[49:47] mature
[49:48] spiritual minds. I just don't know how
[49:51] deep I'm going to go and it'll largely
[49:54] depend on on the congregation.
[49:57] And so I just pray that God will help
[49:59] us. Um,
[50:03] and I'm going to read give a couple
[50:04] quotes and then make some statements.
[50:07] In the message, the Palmer worm, a
[50:10] locust, locust and cankerworm
[50:13] caterpillar.
[50:15] Brother Brandham said, "The church was
[50:17] established on the day of Pentecost.
[50:21] Peter preached the inauguration sermon
[50:24] at the baloreate service when the church
[50:27] was born.
[50:30] And if God is infinite, infinite and
[50:33] cannot change
[50:35] &gt;&gt; his church must remain as it was at the
[50:38] beginning.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; And he said, do you admit that
[50:42] &gt;&gt; the church must ever remain the same as
[50:45] it was? But he said, "But man has," and
[50:49] notice closely, "Man has tinkered with
[50:52] it."
[50:54] Put their own interpretation
[50:57] in it. He says, "Don't you never try to
[51:01] interpret the word of God.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Say just what it says
[51:06] &gt;&gt; and don't care how it is."
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You just line up with it. That's all.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Don't change the word. The Bible said
[51:16] that the scripture is not of any private
[51:18] interpretation.
[51:20] We have no right to say these things. We
[51:22] just got to read it and say it just
[51:25] exactly like it says and believe it the
[51:28] same way.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care how ridiculous it seems.
[51:32] Believe it anyhow.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And the me in the message but from the
[51:41] beginning it was not so. He said, "And
[51:44] he he does not change."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Though men may try to change the word,
[51:51] &gt;&gt; they may try to change the word, but he
[51:54] is the unchangeable God that said it
[51:58] that said it wasn't so from the
[52:00] beginning.
[52:02] The two trees in Eden, we know there
[52:04] were two trees. The one is the tree of
[52:06] life and the other is the tree of
[52:08] knowledge of good and evil.
[52:11] One was Christ and one was Satan. Well,
[52:14] we don't. You might be visiting. You
[52:16] don't understand that. Just believe it.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; There were two trees.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; The two trees appear in the middle of
[52:23] the Bible also.
[52:26] When uh Satan approached Jesus, those
[52:30] are the same two trees. And there they
[52:33] are, the two of them. In Matthew, I
[52:36] think the fourth chapter,
[52:38] it says uh
[52:41] in Ephesians church age, we start with
[52:43] the fact that there were two trees in
[52:46] the midst of the garden. The tree of
[52:48] life was Jesus and the other tree is
[52:54] definitely Satan.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; It has to be because one produced death
[52:58] &gt;&gt; and one produced life.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That's just simple.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; That's a simple person. We don't have to
[53:04] try to figure things out.
[53:06] And because of what came forth of the
[53:09] fruit of that tree, we know it was of
[53:11] Satan because of the fruit of the tree.
[53:14] And he says, "Now then we know that both
[53:18] of those trees had a relationship with
[53:21] man or they would never have been placed
[53:24] there."
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. They must have had a
[53:28] part in the sovereign plan and purpose
[53:32] of God in their relationship to mankind
[53:36] and to himself or we would never we
[53:40] could never impute omniscience unto God.
[53:45] This is all true so far, is it not? Now
[53:49] he says, "The word most definitely sets
[53:52] forth that before the foundation of the
[53:55] earth, the purpose of God was to share
[53:58] his eternal life with man." So in spite
[54:02] of the tree of knowledge and in spite of
[54:05] death being right accessible in the in
[54:09] the Garden of Eden, yet God's plan and
[54:13] program was to share his eternal life
[54:17] &gt;&gt; with man.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the scripture says, "In him was
[54:22] life." In him was life. Didn't say it
[54:27] was anywhere else, but in him was life.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "Faith, life is
[54:36] the healer and life is God."
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Another message, the absolute life is
[54:43] the greatest treasure that man can have.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now friends, everyone here,
[54:50] everyone on the internet or all who will
[54:54] ever hear this, we're only here for a
[54:55] very short time.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And I have a very uh heavy message in in
[55:02] a sense of the word.
[55:05] I want to speak on the supreme
[55:07] importance
[55:09] of maintaining the absolute integrity
[55:14] of the word of God. the supreme
[55:17] importance.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Of maintaining the absolute integrity,
[55:23] &gt;&gt; the truth, the truthfulness,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; the integrity
[55:28] &gt;&gt; of the word of God.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; God is duty bound.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; He's duty bound to vindicate or to prove
[55:38] his word.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; If it's his word, he's duty bound. Would
[55:41] we agree to that?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's duty bound to prove it.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And once he has proved it,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; you and I are duty bound to believe
[55:52] that.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Even though we may never understand it,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; we may not even understand how or why
[55:59] God vindicates or proves that word. But
[56:02] once he proves it,
[56:04] &gt;&gt; we're duty bound.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; To believe it.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in all likelihood, we will not
[56:13] be able to figure it out.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; We may ponder it. We'll be filled with
[56:17] questions, but we're duty bound to
[56:18] believe it and at least confess and say,
[56:21] "That is God."
[56:24] &gt;&gt; That presence is God.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have to conjure it up in my
[56:29] mind. I don't have to imagine it. He has
[56:31] just made it abundantly clear that this
[56:34] is God. It's God because it's
[56:36] supernatural and no man could do it.
[56:38] Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; It's not hit and miss.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; That's where we're going to be going.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; And the doors in the in the doors in a
[56:48] door.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "But to me, it's still the word
[56:52] of God. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[56:55] today, and forever. And he's duty bound
[56:58] to stay by that word." Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham is standing in
[57:06] front of the people
[57:09] and he said, "But now I'm saying now
[57:13] this is a public meeting and he's just
[57:15] speaking." He said, and he's and he's
[57:18] got, I believe, a people in front of him
[57:20] and he says, "But now I'm saying that
[57:23] waiting to see if he will give me the
[57:26] anointing."
[57:30] He said, "If he doesn't give the
[57:32] anointing, then there's only one thing I
[57:35] can do, friends, is to apologize
[57:39] that he hasn't met me tonight. And then
[57:42] we'll just lay hands on the sick and
[57:45] pray for them
[57:47] and ask the benediction,
[57:50] make the altar call, and go home.
[57:54] That's all we can do." and that's all I
[57:58] know to do.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Now, we surely must admire that honesty.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; But he said, "If he does come,
[58:09] &gt;&gt; then I think every each one of you that
[58:11] raised your hands and you wanted to see
[58:14] Christ, I think it's your duty just as
[58:17] soon as this is over to come right down
[58:20] here and kneel down and say, "Lord
[58:22] Jesus, I now surrender myself to you."
[58:24] Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; I think that's reasonable.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "If I'm a liar,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; he will never vindicate a liar."
[58:38] &gt;&gt; And I don't think there's any mystery
[58:39] about that.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; If I'm a liar, he will never vindicate a
[58:43] liar.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; He will have nothing to do with sin. God
[58:49] won't. But if I've told you the truth,
[58:55] then he's duty bound by his word to
[58:59] prove that it's the truth.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; But if it's the word, then God's duty
[59:07] bound to back that word up and vindicate
[59:11] it and to make it truth because he
[59:14] promised to do it.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I want to speak about I'm just going to
[59:22] leave that there for a moment. We'll
[59:24] come back.
[59:26] I want to speak on that the accuracy
[59:30] the accuracy of the word. To be accurate
[59:33] is conforming exactly to truth or to the
[59:38] standard without error.
[59:40] Right. Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Accuracy is critical in so many areas of
[59:47] our lives and I just want to speak of a
[59:50] few.
[59:53] I always think of whenever I get on a
[59:55] plane,
[59:57] you know, I got a private pilot's
[1:00:00] license years ago and they make you go
[1:00:02] through a checklist
[1:00:05] and you have to check everything and you
[1:00:08] try out your various instruments and
[1:00:09] make sure the flaps are working and you
[1:00:12] look at your instruments and so on so
[1:00:14] forth. And this is just visual flying by
[1:00:18] visual. It's not even uh instrument
[1:00:20] flying, but I've been in the cockpits of
[1:00:22] those 747s and you see all those
[1:00:24] instruments all up and down the ceiling
[1:00:26] and all over the place and I just marvel
[1:00:29] that anybody has the intelligence to
[1:00:31] know what they mean.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I have been in the cockpit of a 747
[1:00:36] Singapore Airlines and I walked in cuz a
[1:00:39] bunch of believers are staff and so I
[1:00:42] walked in and sat down. Uh pilot got his
[1:00:45] foot kind of up on the edge there and he
[1:00:47] got a cup of coffee in his hand and I
[1:00:49] said kind of nice life. Yeah. He said
[1:00:52] it's it's good life.
[1:00:54] Whole thing's on automatic pilot. Well,
[1:00:58] I'm glad that somebody knows how to wire
[1:01:01] it right. I I don't know how much
[1:01:03] confidence I have in it. But you know,
[1:01:06] whenever I did a did a check on the
[1:01:08] plane, the one thing you you want to
[1:01:10] check the fuel and you kick the tires
[1:01:13] and you walk around the plane. That's
[1:01:15] the pilot's job. You know, in a car, you
[1:01:18] don't do that. I don't go around kick my
[1:01:20] tires. I don't check every last thing.
[1:01:23] So, you run out of gas, just pull over.
[1:01:31] But like the like the man said, he said
[1:01:34] about flying, he wasn't going to go on a
[1:01:36] plane. He said, "When you're in the car
[1:01:39] and the car stops, you're there. And if
[1:01:42] you're in a train and the train stops,
[1:01:44] he says, there you are. But when you're
[1:01:46] in a plane and the plane stops, where
[1:01:48] are you?"
[1:01:53] You have to be more accurate.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you agree? You have to have a lot
[1:01:58] of confidence in that fellow sitting up
[1:02:00] in the front.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother James. Where'd you
[1:02:04] just fly from? Tokyo or Argentina.
[1:02:07] We got a brother that's more in the air,
[1:02:08] I think, than he's on the ground.
[1:02:12] But I know that they you would agree
[1:02:14] with that. You have to be more specific.
[1:02:17] I don't check all the instruments in the
[1:02:18] car when I get into you. I just get in,
[1:02:21] turn the key on, and drive away. And if
[1:02:23] something happens, get a flat tire. So
[1:02:26] there it is. You're not so concerned
[1:02:28] about accuracy
[1:02:30] in the diagnosis of health or sickness.
[1:02:39] I was reading about a doctor in the
[1:02:42] states the other day. I won't go into it
[1:02:43] as I don't want to spend much time on
[1:02:45] it. But they said in by using using the
[1:02:49] wrong antibiotic
[1:02:52] can actually cause certain infections to
[1:02:55] even grow more
[1:02:58] and prolonging your sickness and
[1:03:00] affecting your family.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the anti antibiotic.
[1:03:06] It's the wrong antibiotic
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; and can actually prolong the sickness or
[1:03:12] cause the infection virus to grow.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Sister Biscll and I just have a nephew
[1:03:21] and he just arrived home I believe
[1:03:24] yesterday.
[1:03:26] Flew him out by airvac
[1:03:29] in a terrible condition.
[1:03:32] He's terribly afflicted with sugar
[1:03:34] diabetes. He has a pump and he's got a
[1:03:37] stent in his head and all kinds of
[1:03:39] things and he has been in incredible
[1:03:42] pain and into unconsciousness and
[1:03:45] whatever more and they flew him from
[1:03:47] Dawson Creek to Edmonton last week
[1:03:52] and we didn't know whether he's going to
[1:03:54] live or not
[1:03:56] and mother and family went out wife and
[1:04:00] another sister went out to be there and
[1:04:03] and the doctors ers who had been
[1:04:06] attending him seemed they couldn't get
[1:04:08] things balanced and and the pain and the
[1:04:11] sickness is just beyond description.
[1:04:14] Incredible. Just out of his mind and off
[1:04:18] balance and everything else. got to a
[1:04:20] doctor in Edmonton and they just did
[1:04:23] changed something with the stent and
[1:04:26] made a couple adjustments and I don't
[1:04:28] know what all and he got up right away
[1:04:31] and he was going to make himself
[1:04:32] something to eat
[1:04:34] and he's on his way home. He's going
[1:04:36] home right now. Maybe arrived home.
[1:04:38] That's what happened. I just read also
[1:04:41] where another doctor and he said that a
[1:04:43] man fell down is actually happening. a
[1:04:46] man fell down and and he went into a
[1:04:50] seizure
[1:04:52] and I can't take time with it, but they
[1:04:54] went into the seizure and uh his I
[1:04:57] believe his son and his wife was there
[1:04:59] and they rushed him by ambulance to the
[1:05:01] hospital and they they diagnosed the
[1:05:05] case and whatever more and and and said
[1:05:08] he needs more help than we can give him
[1:05:09] here. They took him to another help,
[1:05:11] another hospital, I believe in Kansas
[1:05:13] City. And uh and this doctor who wrote
[1:05:16] the article, he said that he he said
[1:05:18] that one thing troubled him. He asked uh
[1:05:21] he asked the one member of the family
[1:05:23] that was there exactly what happened. He
[1:05:25] asked the other member of the family
[1:05:27] exactly what happened and he asked him
[1:05:31] to relate what happened to him. And his
[1:05:33] story was exactly the same as the
[1:05:35] others. And they said if he went into a
[1:05:37] seizure, he wouldn't have remembered all
[1:05:39] of that. So something is wrong. It's not
[1:05:42] a seizure. And yet they put him through
[1:05:44] a CAT scan and said it it must be a
[1:05:46] seizure because uh because of what
[1:05:49] they're uh the diagnosis that they had
[1:05:51] made. And he just had a he said
[1:05:53] sometimes you have to have a hunch. 50%
[1:05:56] of it's medicine but 50% of it is you
[1:05:58] just got to have a a a hunch. The doctor
[1:06:01] has to have an inner voice. And he said
[1:06:04] he said it wasn't matching. If he had a
[1:06:08] seizure, he wouldn't remember it. His
[1:06:10] story would have been different than the
[1:06:12] other two. And he said, "I want to have
[1:06:14] another CAT scan. Only this time, I want
[1:06:17] to have a CAT scan of his chest, not his
[1:06:19] head." And even the nurses said,
[1:06:21] "Doctor, he just had a CAT scan. He just
[1:06:23] had a CAT scan and and and and it and it
[1:06:27] shows that he's not having a a bleed in
[1:06:29] his head." He said, "I want another CAT
[1:06:32] scan." He said they just had one. They
[1:06:34] had a a discussion over it. Sounded like
[1:06:36] it had even dissension amongst the
[1:06:39] medical team. He said, "I want another
[1:06:41] cat scan. I want it of his chest.
[1:06:45] Something's not sounding right. If
[1:06:48] there's anything wrong with his brain,
[1:06:50] he wouldn't have remembered. I want
[1:06:51] another CAT scan." And a main artery had
[1:06:55] had broke in him. Had broke and
[1:06:58] ruptured. And they found exactly what
[1:07:01] was wrong. He said he only had 50/50
[1:07:04] chance to live right then. They operated
[1:07:06] immediately and and and fix that artery
[1:07:09] and whatever was necessary and the man
[1:07:12] continued to live and was perfectly
[1:07:13] healthy. So he was just talking about
[1:07:16] the right diagnosis. We've had brother
[1:07:18] Otto I've talked to brother Otto many
[1:07:20] times and he said the medical profession
[1:07:22] today doesn't have time doesn't have the
[1:07:26] time because of the pressure and the and
[1:07:28] the pressure on the time for the doctors
[1:07:30] and medical people don't have time he
[1:07:33] said I have spent four and five hours to
[1:07:36] get the right diagnosis and he just
[1:07:38] simply said in his in his precise German
[1:07:41] way how can you give the right uh
[1:07:45] antibiotic or how can you give the right
[1:07:48] uh the right response if you don't know
[1:07:51] what the problem is. You've got to know
[1:07:54] what the problem is. My point is when
[1:07:57] you're sick, you're afflicted. You want
[1:08:01] accuracy.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And you want a doctor who knows what
[1:08:06] he's doing and knows what he's saying.
[1:08:08] You want accuracy. That's just in life.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; You want accuracy.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You're determined. Well, maybe he
[1:08:15] doesn't know. I want a second opinion. I
[1:08:18] want to go to a specialist because you
[1:08:20] want accuracy.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; We just have and we could talk about
[1:08:25] accuracy and prescription. We talk about
[1:08:27] accuracy. They just had the world
[1:08:30] Olympics are on and the first gold medal
[1:08:32] that was won I understand was won by a a
[1:08:35] Chinese young lady and and she was a
[1:08:38] sharpshooter and she got a 10.5 out of a
[1:08:42] possible 11 and won the first gold
[1:08:45] medal. She was and and and all of the
[1:08:48] athletes are there. They're there for
[1:08:50] accuracy. They're there for stamina.
[1:08:52] They're there to uh to uphold their
[1:08:55] nation. They're not there to slough off.
[1:08:57] Right.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; They're not there to take this thing
[1:09:00] casual.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; There's nobody over there in London
[1:09:03] taking this week casual.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; They have spent years getting ready and
[1:09:09] practicing to be accurate
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; with everything that they do. Is that
[1:09:14] not right?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; I want to say something.
[1:09:22] I am speechless
[1:09:25] and dumbfounded
[1:09:27] at how casual people want to be
[1:09:31] with the word of God
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; and eternal life.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:09:40] that's what they said. That's what my
[1:09:42] church is. That's what this church does.
[1:09:44] Who gives a care what somebody else
[1:09:47] does? what another doctor does or
[1:09:50] another preacher does or something else.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Let's find out. Say, well, God, uh, if
[1:09:58] there is a word of God,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; it's up to you to prove who it is.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; And you're supernatural, so it's not
[1:10:06] going to be some natural reasoning that
[1:10:09] we got to figure out. I don't have to
[1:10:11] figure it out. You figured it out.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not obliged to send it or produce
[1:10:17] it. Right?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's your word.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You want to share eternal life with us.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Where is that word?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; And then what are we going to do with it
[1:10:29] when he does present it and say, "Here
[1:10:31] it is."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Now you see where I'm going.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; To sin. The word sin in the Bible simply
[1:10:46] means to miss the mark.
[1:10:53] To miss the way or to go the wrong way
[1:10:55] or to miss the goal. You don't have to
[1:10:58] miss it by six feet. You don't have to
[1:11:00] miss it by three feet. You don't have to
[1:11:01] miss it by you just miss it by an inch
[1:11:04] or two.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; And a miss is a miss.
[1:11:08] That's right.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in things that
[1:11:14] wasn't so from the beginning. He said
[1:11:16] their churches is gone today. They're
[1:11:19] off on a tantrum somewhere.
[1:11:23] Making organizations, making
[1:11:25] denominations, bringing people after
[1:11:27] creeds instead of after Christ. Says, "I
[1:11:30] don't want no creed but Christ, no law
[1:11:32] but love, and no book but the Bible."
[1:11:36] That's exactly what we've got. God's
[1:11:38] creed.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; It's God's prescription.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's an accurate prescription.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God knew what sin needed
[1:11:50] and gave exactly what it needed.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And sin was simply going off of the
[1:11:55] word, tampering with the word.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's what he did. He tampered with the
[1:12:02] word
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; and got Eve to accept a tampered word
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; and all of death happened. You'll never
[1:12:09] figure out how come every hospital bed,
[1:12:11] every prison cell, every insane
[1:12:13] institution, every drug addict,
[1:12:16] everything else, it's been produced by
[1:12:18] that one. We can't understand it. God
[1:12:21] understands it.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; And because he understands it, he's
[1:12:25] given the he's given the antidote for
[1:12:28] it. Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; He's given the solution for it. He's
[1:12:32] given the prescription for it. Does
[1:12:34] everyone agree with that?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I'm giving it in short statements today.
[1:12:42] But I hope that when I'm done, there
[1:12:43] isn't very much room to move.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's God's creed and it's
[1:12:56] God's prescription. It's God's antidote
[1:12:58] for sin. It's God's antidote for our
[1:13:01] healing. And it's God's power made
[1:13:04] manifest to us as we take the word in
[1:13:08] our lives. It's God's
[1:13:11] power made manifest
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; to us as we take the word in our lives.
[1:13:19] Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He said Peter, James, and John hit the
[1:13:24] mark every time because they followed
[1:13:27] the word.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Said they didn't hit the mark every time
[1:13:30] because they understood the word. They
[1:13:33] hit the mark every time because they
[1:13:35] followed the word.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; So we're called on some sometimes to
[1:13:40] follow something we don't understand. I
[1:13:42] don't know exactly why I'm doing this. I
[1:13:46] only know that it is God and I know that
[1:13:49] it works
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; in the message key to the key to the
[1:13:57] door.
[1:14:00] He said Hebrews 12. He's referring to
[1:14:02] Hebrews 12. Seeing that we're compassed
[1:14:05] about with so great a cloud of
[1:14:07] witnesses, let us lay aside every weight
[1:14:09] and the unbelief and the unbelief that
[1:14:11] does so easily set us. The sin that does
[1:14:14] so easily beset us. Which sin, he said,
[1:14:16] is unbelief. Only one sin. That's
[1:14:19] unbelief. And sin means miss the mark.
[1:14:22] Like you're shooting, you miss the mark.
[1:14:25] Better adjust your gun because there's
[1:14:28] something wrong. You missed the mark.
[1:14:31] See, he says, "Come back and try over."
[1:14:34] See, it means to turn around. You've
[1:14:37] missed the mark. And when you want to be
[1:14:39] a Christian and you join a church,
[1:14:41] you've missed the mark. When you want to
[1:14:44] be a Christian and you've been sprinkled
[1:14:46] in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
[1:14:48] Ghost, you've missed the mark. Better
[1:14:51] come back. You'll not be on the target.
[1:14:58] If this says in the name of the Lord
[1:15:00] Jesus Christ, repent, not just be
[1:15:03] baptized, repent and be baptized. Turn
[1:15:06] around and be baptized in the name of
[1:15:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:15:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:15:14] preacher doesn't give it to you. The
[1:15:16] water doesn't give it to you. No one
[1:15:18] else, no, no, no amount of emotion gives
[1:15:21] it to you. You shall receive it. That's
[1:15:24] the prescription
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; and that's what you need to believe. A
[1:15:29] lot of people I think they only believe
[1:15:31] that I will go to the water and be
[1:15:33] baptized. That isn't where the believing
[1:15:35] ends. That's just where it starts.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So there's only one way.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; However, people, you know, tend to lean
[1:15:47] to their own understanding.
[1:15:50] He says, "Brother Brandham talks about
[1:15:53] dreams.
[1:15:55] I've heard a lot of people. I've had
[1:15:56] dreams. Most people have dreams. Good
[1:16:00] ones, bad ones. Some that mean
[1:16:03] something. Some that are just total
[1:16:04] nonsense.
[1:16:06] Some that are full of hookie spooks.
[1:16:10] And some of them that need
[1:16:11] interpretation and bio.
[1:16:14] She never gets some wild
[1:16:16] interpretations."
[1:16:18] Uh, and the prophet says God can deal in
[1:16:22] dreams, but it's not too accurate.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; So, let's not put a whole lot of
[1:16:29] emphasis on on the dreams.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; So, now I'm speaking on the maintaining
[1:16:38] and the believing in the accuracy now of
[1:16:42] the message. Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm accuracy of the word of God.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Maintaining
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; maintaining the accuracy, maintaining
[1:16:52] the belief in the accuracy
[1:16:55] accuracy to obtain the prize,
[1:16:59] not a gold medal at the Olympics.
[1:17:03] You might take this with a grain of
[1:17:05] salt, but I don't want you to. I can I
[1:17:08] can tell you that the Olympians
[1:17:12] that are in London
[1:17:14] have nothing
[1:17:16] nothing. They're not even in the same
[1:17:18] ballpark with the people that are
[1:17:20] sitting right here.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Not even in the same ballpark.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And they for uh uh um just some human
[1:17:30] glory,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And are you going to compare that? We
[1:17:35] could never compare that with hearing a
[1:17:38] blessed voice saying, "Enter in
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; thou blessed of the Lord."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Into the things that have been prepared
[1:17:48] for you from before the foundation of
[1:17:50] the world. You want a galaxy, here it
[1:17:53] is. You want eternal life. We're talking
[1:17:56] about eternal life, friends.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not talking about
[1:18:03] standing on a podium.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I'm bronze. I'm silver. I'm gold.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm not belittling that. They But
[1:18:11] look how they how they uh strive for how
[1:18:17] the accuracy and perfection and
[1:18:19] precision
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; in their run and in their step and
[1:18:23] everything.
[1:18:25] How much more
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; should we concern ourselves about the
[1:18:31] accuracy of the word of God?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You don't mind if I just take my time a
[1:18:42] little bit?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; I'm conscious about being long- winded,
[1:18:45] so please help me.
[1:18:53] God has made himself abundantly clear
[1:18:58] and left man with no excuse.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; In Romans, we read,
[1:19:06] "Because that which may be known of God
[1:19:09] is manifest is Romans 1:19.
[1:19:12] Because that which may be known of God
[1:19:15] is manifest in them.
[1:19:18] For God hath showed it unto them.
[1:19:23] For the invisible things of him from the
[1:19:27] creation of the world are clearly seen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Being understood by the things that are
[1:19:35] made. We see the things that are made.
[1:19:37] So we understand that even his eternal
[1:19:40] power and godhead so that they are
[1:19:42] without excuse. God is saying through
[1:19:45] the mighty Apostle Paul that these
[1:19:47] things are so clear.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; The invisible God has made those things
[1:19:51] so visible and so manifested that
[1:19:54] they're without excuse. They're right
[1:19:55] here in front of them. Now he continues
[1:19:57] on with that.
[1:20:00] And the seed, we speak of the seed now
[1:20:04] in the beginning. The seed
[1:20:06] life
[1:20:09] seed is central to the entire Bible. Now
[1:20:14] I'm starting to get into some fairly
[1:20:16] heavy things.
[1:20:20] The seed life is absolutely central to
[1:20:25] the entire scripture.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Every seed after his own kind.
[1:20:34] So just pay real strict attention.
[1:20:38] In the beginning we read was the word.
[1:20:44] The spoken word
[1:20:47] and this will cover another messages
[1:20:49] I've tried to convey here but the spoken
[1:20:51] word is infused
[1:20:54] or pervaded or permeated
[1:20:59] with seed life. It's
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; number one.
[1:21:04] And the carrier of that seed even in the
[1:21:07] animal world
[1:21:10] has is driven by a compulsion.
[1:21:17] Must give that seed
[1:21:20] for the
[1:21:22] for the procreation of life.
[1:21:28] And the prophet took back to the animal
[1:21:31] kingdom and how the animal kingdom
[1:21:34] amongst the uh animals when they come
[1:21:38] into season for breeding
[1:21:44] it it is incredible. You know you take
[1:21:47] those of you that are acquainted with
[1:21:48] the animals in this country a moose for
[1:21:50] example he goes crazy. He'll take on
[1:21:53] anything in Alaska if you can believe
[1:21:56] it. a moose when he's when he's in the
[1:21:59] rut, they call it the rut. When he's in
[1:22:02] the rut, he'll stand in the middle of
[1:22:04] the train tracks and take on an engine
[1:22:06] coming at him at 50 m an hour. And it's
[1:22:09] a big problem up there because so many
[1:22:11] of them are killed. But there's
[1:22:13] something within him. He just he's so
[1:22:16] supercharged.
[1:22:18] He He's supercharged. Remember now, it's
[1:22:22] it's life.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] He is interested only in one thing that
[1:22:27] is producing another one like himself
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; and he's so intent on that he's ready to
[1:22:34] take on a tree or take on the woods or
[1:22:37] take on any other animal he meets or
[1:22:40] take on a train if necessary. That is
[1:22:45] now that's just in the animal kingdom.
[1:22:51] Then when that becomes perverted in the
[1:22:54] human kingdom,
[1:22:57] then in the end time we end up with a
[1:22:59] complete perversion
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; where men don't want to give the seed to
[1:23:05] women and women don't want to receive it
[1:23:07] from the man.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And for that, come on, folks.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; You're not babies.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; You understand? And that's exactly what
[1:23:17] the world is.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And the world's infested with it.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; The world is corrupted with it.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the reasons God's
[1:23:28] going to destroy it.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that if God didn't
[1:23:31] destroy it, he'd have to raise up Sodom
[1:23:33] and Gomorrah. Who's Sodom and Gomorrah?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; What are the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah?
[1:23:39] and apologize
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; for destroying them because this age has
[1:23:44] exactly gone full full scale
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; the same direction
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and it's tampering with the seed
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; and that is only at a natural level
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; because that is indicative of what Satan
[1:24:07] is on the rampage to do with the message
[1:24:10] of the hour.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; It's the message of the hour that he
[1:24:14] hates.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; It's the lifegiving seed that he hates.
[1:24:18] He wants to tamper with it or get
[1:24:21] anybody with their in their minds or or
[1:24:24] their philosophy or whatever more and
[1:24:27] and maybe they're not going right away.
[1:24:29] So, the message is not of God. Oh, no.
[1:24:31] The message of God, but it needs to be
[1:24:34] tingled with. It needs to be tampered
[1:24:36] with. It needs to be, you know, it needs
[1:24:37] to be explained.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; We don't have to have it explained. You
[1:24:43] need to believe it.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Do I hear an amen on that?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; And you young people especially the
[1:24:56] same. You've got minds and you've got
[1:24:58] retention and you've got energy. And if
[1:25:01] there is a time yet to remain, there is
[1:25:04] some future. You're the ones that really
[1:25:06] need to take a hold of this thing with
[1:25:08] real fervor and zeal.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; And you should look up what the zeal and
[1:25:13] the fervor meant in the scripture. It is
[1:25:15] right exactly comes back to the same
[1:25:17] thing. It is the passion.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; It's a passion and the zeal
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; to bring forth
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; after their kind
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; because that's the word of God.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to form another
[1:25:33] church. There's churches everywhere.
[1:25:35] We're here to bring forth after our
[1:25:37] kind.
[1:25:39] And as long as we're here, there's
[1:25:41] another one that needs to be brought
[1:25:43] forth after our kind. That's another
[1:25:45] word believer.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; That's a bornagain son of God, daughter
[1:25:54] of God, separated from the world
[1:25:58] to live the expression of Jesus Christ,
[1:26:00] to carry his seed.
[1:26:03] and to bring forth another one.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; And we're driven by a zeal, by a fervor,
[1:26:09] by a passion.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; We're not lukewarm.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; We're not lukewarm. We're not casual
[1:26:18] about this thing. We want an accurate
[1:26:21] word and we want it preached accurately.
[1:26:26] We want the full strength of the word
[1:26:28] delivered to us.
[1:26:34] Hallelujah.
[1:26:37] Hallelujah.
[1:26:39] And it's only that word that has life in
[1:26:41] it. And this isn't life just to extend
[1:26:44] life. This isn't healing. This is
[1:26:46] eternal life.
[1:26:56] And God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[1:27:00] grass,
[1:27:02] the herb yielding seed, and the fruit
[1:27:05] tree yielding fruit after his kind,
[1:27:08] whose seed is in itself upon the earth."
[1:27:12] And it was so. Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; And the next verse, and the earth
[1:27:18] brought forth grass.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said it.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And it brought forth grass, and the herb
[1:27:25] yielding seed after his kind, and the
[1:27:28] tree yielding fruit after uh whose seed
[1:27:32] is in itself, after his kind. That
[1:27:35] happens to be the text for the spoken
[1:27:38] words, the original seed.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And God saw that it
[1:27:43] was good.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Christ come forth. The fruit tree came
[1:27:52] forth.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; And then God said, "Let us make man
[1:27:58] in our image."
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Let's have one of our kind.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; After our likeness.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Let them have dominion. We have
[1:28:10] dominion. Let them have dominion
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; over the fish, over the sea. I got an
[1:28:16] email, a text this morning from a
[1:28:19] brother in Uganda. He's streaming right
[1:28:22] now. He said he'll be streaming the
[1:28:24] service. So, we say, "God bless you,
[1:28:26] brother Bus."
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:29] and he just was spoke on a radio
[1:28:31] broadcast and God opened the door with
[1:28:35] the uh leader of the Pentecostals
[1:28:38] and he got on a trinity
[1:28:40] and uh and the trinitarians and I'm
[1:28:43] saying this for brother Bus's behalf is
[1:28:45] right it's easier than for me texting at
[1:28:47] all but when they say let us the
[1:28:50] emphasis is on us I say I go with you
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; well who is us I don't know do you No.
[1:28:58] Well, it's a trinity. Oh, is it? That
[1:29:01] doesn't say so.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Let us make man. So, I go with them.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And then I say, did do you agree that
[1:29:09] they made man in their image when they
[1:29:12] were done? Did they have one? Did they
[1:29:14] have their image?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Well, yeah. How many did
[1:29:19] they have?"
[1:29:26] Well, now we have a real problem
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; because we say, "Well, no. Well, uh,
[1:29:31] yeah, they only had one." Then it wasn't
[1:29:33] in their image.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Wasn't in their image.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; When they had it in their image and they
[1:29:39] ended up with one
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; and yet it was a plurality because in
[1:29:43] him was his wife. Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Eve was still in him.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And he says they called their plural
[1:29:53] name Adam singular.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; So when he was finished with his image,
[1:30:03] he only had one.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And so God created man in his in his own
[1:30:08] image.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; In the image of God created he him.
[1:30:13] Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Male and female created he them.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Just read
[1:30:23] it.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And God bless them plural. And God said
[1:30:30] unto them, plural, "Be fruitful, and
[1:30:33] multiply, and replenish the earth, and
[1:30:36] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[1:30:38] fish of the sea, and over the fowl over
[1:30:40] the air, and over every living thing
[1:30:43] that moved upon the earth." Adam hadn't
[1:30:46] even been put to sleep yet.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Eve hadn't even come forth yet.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; She wasn't even made till chapter two.
[1:30:54] And then you get into chapter two and
[1:30:56] and God hasn't even formed Adam out of
[1:30:59] the dust of the ground yet.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Have dominion and control just like the
[1:31:09] original
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; does male and female created he them
[1:31:15] just like the original.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; The bride was in God.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; He was alone.
[1:31:24] He was absolutely alone
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; and he made one in his own image.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And the reason why he could say it's
[1:31:30] it's not Adam who said it's not good for
[1:31:32] man to be alone.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; No, it's God who said it's not good for
[1:31:36] man to be alone because he was
[1:31:38] expressing himself.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; I'll make a helpmate for you.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And what was the helpmate? Listen now,
[1:31:50] adults. The helpmate was a place for his
[1:31:53] seed.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That was a weak amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; It was a place for his seed
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; so he could reproduce himself and have
[1:32:02] another one of his kind.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly why God created you
[1:32:07] and I. So he could implant his seed in
[1:32:10] you, pregnantate you and bring forth
[1:32:12] after his kind.
[1:32:15] Not after the world, not after a church,
[1:32:18] not after a denomination, not after any
[1:32:20] other creed, not even a tradition of the
[1:32:23] message. His kind.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; From this point rises two things.
[1:32:41] Number one, the determination to bring
[1:32:44] forth.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Now, when you read the Old Testament,
[1:32:54] when you folks read the Old Testament, I
[1:32:56] guarantee you there's all kinds of it
[1:32:59] that you don't understand.
[1:33:04] There were people in the whole nations
[1:33:06] that were slain
[1:33:08] and you don't understand that.
[1:33:11] But I can tell you one thing. There's
[1:33:13] one thing in the mind of God and that is
[1:33:16] that he's going to bring forth of his
[1:33:18] own kind.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; And when anything got in the way that
[1:33:21] the seed line might get cut, hindered
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; or prevented,
[1:33:28] God moved nations. He moved nations and
[1:33:32] he eliminated them.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; If they tried to stand withstand Israel
[1:33:37] and God raised up a people and and and
[1:33:40] and
[1:33:42] now you have to help me.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; There's a passion within God where the
[1:33:46] same God that says we should be zealous,
[1:33:49] we should be redot, we should be
[1:33:50] fervent, that's because there's that
[1:33:53] characteristic of God. Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why Tamar wasn't
[1:33:59] destroyed when she when she had a
[1:34:01] husband and couldn't bring forth and
[1:34:04] then it was to have her her his brother
[1:34:07] to bring forth and he spilled his seed
[1:34:09] and God slew him.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he wouldn't bring forth on
[1:34:14] honor on his brother's head
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and she had something in her. Now it's
[1:34:20] not only the male but it was a female.
[1:34:22] the woman there and you even know in the
[1:34:24] animal kingdom it is so and I'm hesitant
[1:34:27] to speak these things but nevertheless
[1:34:29] it is true the animal kingdom is God's
[1:34:31] kingdom
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; and sometimes there's something even
[1:34:35] within uh within uh uh the the females
[1:34:38] of of the animals that they're selective
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; about who is going to uh which one will
[1:34:44] be give them a strong cub or a strong
[1:34:49] offspring
[1:34:52] And there was something selective in
[1:34:54] Tamar. She knew she must bring forth the
[1:34:58] the seed of the lion of the tribe of
[1:35:00] Judah.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; This tribe must not die.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And if it means my reputation, it means
[1:35:10] my reputation. If it means they're going
[1:35:11] to cut me off even at the threat of
[1:35:14] being burned at the stake, this seed
[1:35:17] must not die.
[1:35:19] Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And transferred herself from Genesis
[1:35:24] over into Matthew 1:1 as one of the
[1:35:27] mothers of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You can never figure that out. Don't try
[1:35:34] to figure it out. It's God's
[1:35:36] determination. He must be He must be uh
[1:35:40] the lion of the tribe of Judah. Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And it caused her even to dress in a as
[1:35:49] a harlot.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; And to lay with her own father-in-law.
[1:35:54] You'll never figure that one out.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And she should have been burned for it.
[1:36:00] Judas says, "Bring her here and I'll
[1:36:02] burn her."
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; And she had some tokens that he had
[1:36:07] given her. And
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; he said, "This is the man
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; that I'm carrying this child with."
[1:36:16] And she gave him his own items
[1:36:19] and he just said, "You're more righteous
[1:36:20] than I am."
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; God didn't have her destroyed. Has God
[1:36:26] got a double standard? No. The standard
[1:36:28] is the standard is every seed must bring
[1:36:32] forth after his own kind.
[1:36:36] And God is the first one that
[1:36:38] prophesied. He gave a prophecy.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; God actually prophesied. And the
[1:36:44] prophecy is concerning seed.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And he comes to the serpent and he says,
[1:36:48] "I'll put enmity between you and the
[1:36:50] woman
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and between your seed
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; and her seed."
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And her seed was going to be nothing
[1:36:58] other than the new created seed of
[1:37:00] almighty God. God was God was speaking
[1:37:03] and prophesying again that he's going to
[1:37:05] create a new seed and Jesus Christ would
[1:37:08] be the beginning of a new creation.
[1:37:11] Hallelujah. And I say to you today, he
[1:37:15] transformed himself into spoken word and
[1:37:18] uttered his word and spoke in this
[1:37:20] generation. The spoken word is the
[1:37:24] original seed
[1:37:26] and has brought forth original children
[1:37:29] after his kind. And there's a great
[1:37:32] struggle going on for us to to dilute
[1:37:35] and to water down and to take away from
[1:37:39] the emphasis and the importance of it. I
[1:37:42] resist the spirit of this leisia with
[1:37:45] everything that's in me. I resist it in
[1:37:48] the name of Jesus Christ. It is the
[1:37:51] enemy of God.
[1:37:53] And I want that this church rise up
[1:37:57] because this is your time to shine.
[1:38:00] This is your time to make yourself
[1:38:02] known. This is your time to be able to
[1:38:05] tell the world, "We're not just a
[1:38:07] church.
[1:38:09] We're sons and daughters of the living
[1:38:11] God. We've been birthed by the eternal
[1:38:14] seed of Almighty God. And I refuse to be
[1:38:17] reduced down to a nominal Christian to a
[1:38:22] lukewarm generation.
[1:38:24] Hallelujah. I refuse it in the name of
[1:38:28] Jesus Christ. And as a servant of Christ
[1:38:31] today, I say, Satan, you're defeated.
[1:38:35] Hallelujah. You perverter of the seed of
[1:38:37] God. You cannot pervert this seed.
[1:38:44] Hallelujah.
[1:38:46] Hallelujah.
[1:38:49] Hallelujah.
[1:38:58] He's filled our streets with filth of
[1:39:01] vile things and you rub shoulders with
[1:39:04] it every day. I deny it
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. With
[1:39:08] everything that's in me, I deny it. This
[1:39:11] perverted spirit will have no part of
[1:39:13] the message. I'm not talking about the
[1:39:15] perversion of the flesh. I'm talking
[1:39:17] about the perversion of the word of God.
[1:39:37] The evidences of this
[1:39:40] loss of desire to reproduce
[1:39:43] in both men and women,
[1:39:46] loss of natural affection
[1:39:48] for the offspring.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Don't be afflicted with that.
[1:40:02] The sexual perversion of this age
[1:40:07] all has to do with seed.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; People are talking about sexual
[1:40:13] orientation. Has nothing to do with
[1:40:14] that.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Has to do with the perversion of seed.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:25] Men, the scripture says, leave leaving
[1:40:27] the natural use of the women. And even
[1:40:30] women did change the natural use
[1:40:34] into that which is against nature.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says,
[1:40:42] and I'm going to give it very precise.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; It's all in Romans 1. Won't turn to it.
[1:40:52] Verse 24. and God gave them up.
[1:40:58] And verse 26, and God gave them up.
[1:41:03] And verse 28,
[1:41:06] and God gave them over to a reprobate
[1:41:10] mind.
[1:41:12] The only place in the Bible you'll find
[1:41:14] it like that.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Doesn't make me happy.
[1:41:20] Gives me sadness. And God gave them up.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; God
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; gave them up.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; And God gave them up.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And God gave them over to a reprobate
[1:41:40] mind. God the fountain of mercy, the m
[1:41:43] fountain of longsuffering.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; And he gave them up.
[1:41:52] That spirit which is in the world is
[1:41:56] only an indication
[1:41:58] of what that demon wants to do
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; with the seed of God,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, my friends, this is to put an
[1:42:09] emphasis on. We haven't just, you know,
[1:42:11] well, I'm I'm I'm in the message.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Just a second.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You know what you're talking about?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; You're saying I've got the seed.
[1:42:20] of Almighty God.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; I've been pregnantated.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; However you want to put it. I've been
[1:42:29] pregnantated
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; by God's own instrument.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; With the living eternal seed of eternal
[1:42:38] life into my soul. and I've been given
[1:42:41] it that I might express my part of him,
[1:42:44] my allotment that I have been given.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; And that I shall portray Jesus Christ
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; in this only chance you have.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You only got a few short years and
[1:42:56] you're going to be gone out of here.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; And if God, if the rapture doesn't take
[1:43:02] place, be laying under some dirt here
[1:43:05] someplace. So let if this is your time
[1:43:07] to shine,
[1:43:09] rise and shine. Hallelujah. For your
[1:43:12] light has come.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; The seed has been sown.
[1:43:28] Paul said to Timothy,
[1:43:30] "Is this all right?"
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; If you've never listened, listen this
[1:43:37] time.
[1:43:39] I won't preach this again here.
[1:43:44] without natural affection,
[1:43:48] put with truth breakers, false accusers,
[1:43:50] incontinent, fierce despisers of those
[1:43:53] that are good
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; without natural affection.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:02] men and women today.
[1:44:05] This is so far out of my even my
[1:44:07] capacity to
[1:44:09] imagine
[1:44:12] actually leave
[1:44:15] their offspring.
[1:44:17] Not talking about the offspring leaving
[1:44:18] them. I'm talking about them leave their
[1:44:21] offspring.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Just abandon them.
[1:44:41] Romans again Paul says without
[1:44:43] understanding covenant breakers
[1:44:46] without natural affection
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; implacable
[1:44:51] unmerciful
[1:44:55] the determination of God to keep his
[1:44:57] lineage going.
[1:45:00] One of the outstanding places. Is this
[1:45:02] all right, friends?
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; I don't mind if you ship me off to
[1:45:07] Timbuktu after this service. It'd be
[1:45:09] fine with me. How's Timbuktu? Somebody
[1:45:12] knows something about Timbuktu. That's
[1:45:13] in Molly.
[1:45:22] You know, sometimes we say things not
[1:45:24] because we have answers, because we have
[1:45:26] questions.
[1:45:28] There's all kinds of questions. I don't
[1:45:30] figure that I'm going to get all the
[1:45:31] answers. I just And you don't mind if I
[1:45:33] tell you about some of the questions
[1:45:37] because people want to tinker with the
[1:45:39] message.
[1:45:41] we if we get this and we just we can fit
[1:45:43] all of this together and then finally we
[1:45:45] can consummate in kind of a a doctrine
[1:45:47] that I love. That's not what the message
[1:45:50] came for.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; We're not here to tinker with the
[1:45:54] message.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; We're here to take it as it was unfolded
[1:45:57] and it was it unfolded. We know it was
[1:45:59] an everinccreasing revelation. And what
[1:46:02] is a revelation? It's an unfolding of
[1:46:04] who? Jesus Christ.
[1:46:08] And if you don't find Jesus Christ, and
[1:46:10] I, as I said to the people over in
[1:46:12] Europe, they end up with some of these
[1:46:14] specialty doctrines, and by the time you
[1:46:16] get to the bottom of the doctrine, you
[1:46:17] find a man there.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; A personality there. That's not the
[1:46:21] message. Didn't come to raise up
[1:46:23] personalities.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Personalities is what corrupted
[1:46:26] Pentecost.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm following this person. I'm
[1:46:29] following this person. I'm following
[1:46:31] this. There's no great ones in this
[1:46:33] message. We're just preachers of the
[1:46:35] gospel declaring the truth of the word.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; And that's where this church stands.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And I despise I actually despise even
[1:46:46] the even the thought of the concept,
[1:46:48] well, brother Ed Bisl this or brother Ed
[1:46:50] Bisl that or or whoever else.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with that.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; That's not what this is all about.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; We're here just for a short time and
[1:47:01] then we're going to leave.
[1:47:04] we're going to be dispensed with. And if
[1:47:06] time goes on, many of you folks will be
[1:47:08] gone. And some of these younger ones and
[1:47:10] those that are just children in BCA,
[1:47:12] they're going to take positions. They're
[1:47:14] going to be deacons and trustees and
[1:47:15] whatever more.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; The mission and the vision will still be
[1:47:20] the same vision.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; It has to be.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; I'm really laying it on you young men
[1:47:28] and you young ladies. tell you what,
[1:47:31] you've got a huge mission,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; a huge call,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; this is not something that is supposed
[1:47:37] to atrophy
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; and diminish down into just some kind of
[1:47:42] social churchgoing thing. I abhore that.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I came out of that. I was delivered from
[1:47:49] that. I'm not going to give up this
[1:47:51] flame and fire. I was born in the fire
[1:47:54] and I can't stand the smoke,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; if you know what I mean.
[1:48:04] Now we read about Samson and Delilah and
[1:48:06] Samson and the different women and
[1:48:09] everybody figured out Hollywood got
[1:48:11] their idea about it just is rotten and
[1:48:14] corrupted. They couldn't think straight
[1:48:16] if they tried.
[1:48:18] They couldn't get a picture and a count
[1:48:20] and they always like to they go to the
[1:48:21] Bible to get a spiritual side because
[1:48:23] they know it appeals to a lot of people
[1:48:25] and then a lot of ignorant people out
[1:48:27] there and they get kind of their
[1:48:28] emotion. Isn't that wonderful? You know
[1:48:31] the passion of Jesus. No, they don't
[1:48:32] nothing but the passion of Jesus.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I might be hurting somebody's feelings.
[1:48:42] They might be saying, "Well, well, I saw
[1:48:43] it and I was hurt. I I I was moved. I I
[1:48:46] don't know that I cried. Maybe you did.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean a thing to me.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; He gave his life blood.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; A bride came out of him. Hollywood knows
[1:49:01] nothing about that.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Seed life came out of him
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit fell upon a church
[1:49:08] and we were born again by the spirit of
[1:49:11] God.
[1:49:16] Hallelujah.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Samson went down to the Philistines and
[1:49:20] he saw a woman of Timnath
[1:49:24] and he liked her.
[1:49:27] She pleased him.
[1:49:29] And he goes to his mother and father and
[1:49:31] says, "This girl down here, I like her.
[1:49:36] Get her for me." And they were
[1:49:39] distraught.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Is there no Is
[1:49:44] there no young women in Israel?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You have to go to the Philistines, our
[1:49:48] enemies.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "But I, you know, she pleases
[1:49:54] me. Get her for me."
[1:49:57] And the Bible says, your Bible says,
[1:50:02] now this is where you really need to be
[1:50:04] adult.
[1:50:06] Your Bible says
[1:50:08] that his mother and father did not
[1:50:12] understand that it was of God.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; For God, not Samson, loving a woman. God
[1:50:20] sought an occasion and go and click on
[1:50:23] occasion and you'll find out
[1:50:27] in the meaning of the occasion.
[1:50:30] God was
[1:50:32] in the heat, in the compulsion
[1:50:36] of continuing to bring forth his seed.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; And the Philistines
[1:50:42] were a prime enemy and target against
[1:50:44] it.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; And God was seeking an opportunity to
[1:50:48] bring destruction to them.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; And it even has a sexual connotation
[1:50:59] as as as uh a as an animal or as a human
[1:51:03] or as a person in the heat.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; To bring forth
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; God was going to bring forth.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't care about Philistines.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't care about Hitler.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care about any of these that
[1:51:18] try to What? What do you think the demon
[1:51:20] is that possessed Mr. Hitler?
[1:51:24] It's seed.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Why do you think Herod had the children?
[1:51:29] All the male children. Seed.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Why did Pharaoh want to destroy the male
[1:51:34] children? It's seed. It's the same demon
[1:51:37] that was in the beginning. And God will
[1:51:40] not allow that spirit to overcome. He's
[1:51:43] going to bring forth his children.
[1:51:46] And in the midst of this age, you were
[1:51:49] seated in the most darkened, most
[1:51:51] confused, most perverted age of all the
[1:51:54] ages. And God God concluded, I'm not
[1:51:58] going to send a reformer. I'm going to
[1:52:00] send a prophet.
[1:52:03] I'm going to vindicate him.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; And the accuracy will be perfection.
[1:52:11] There will not be a single time that he
[1:52:14] will error.
[1:52:21] Yeah. Just say, did he say it this way
[1:52:23] or did he say it that way? And he said
[1:52:25] 700 and he meant 10 7,000. Oh, nonsense.
[1:52:29] That doesn't change the truth of the
[1:52:31] word. The purpose of the message is to
[1:52:34] reveal Jesus Christ in the scripture.
[1:52:39] The scripture doesn't change.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; The man was a human.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; He got weary like we did. He got hungry
[1:52:47] like you do. He got tired like we did.
[1:52:49] So did Jesus.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, I
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I am I'm burning up, friends.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I got an incredible zeal.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I have to deliver this to
[1:53:06] you.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the passion of almighty
[1:53:10] God.
[1:53:12] I can say with Apostle Paul, I'm jealous
[1:53:14] over you. It's with a godly jealousy.
[1:53:18] We have no natural thing that we're
[1:53:20] interested in. Not interested in your
[1:53:22] money. Not interested in your homes. Not
[1:53:24] in We're interested in your soul. I have
[1:53:27] a godly jealousy over your soul. And I
[1:53:31] want to announce to Satan and all the
[1:53:33] demons and hordes of hell, they shall
[1:53:35] have no part of the bloodbought throne.
[1:53:43] They shall have no part of these that
[1:53:45] have been birthed as sons and daughters
[1:53:47] of God. You have not been introduced to
[1:53:50] a church. You've been introduced into
[1:53:52] the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:57] Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] the chosen elected bride of Jesus
[1:54:01] Christ, chosen to bear his seed,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; chosen to bring forth of his likeness,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; his image,
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; and the gentile bride will bring forth
[1:54:14] the son of David,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; into the millennium,
[1:54:32] Through the dark ages,
[1:54:36] the martyrs that gave their lives,
[1:54:40] it was to see that the word seed of God
[1:54:44] would be passed on.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; He said, uh, can I have a few more
[1:54:55] minutes? I mean,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I need a little more time.
[1:54:59] I'm quoting. He said in Abraham and his
[1:55:01] seed, he said, this one, he's speaking
[1:55:04] about this one,
[1:55:06] Elohim, that stayed back behind to the
[1:55:09] elected church. Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, Abraham, where's your wife
[1:55:14] Sarah?
[1:55:16] How did he know that he had? He said
[1:55:18] that he was a stranger. Now watch. He's
[1:55:21] talking to the elected seed now of
[1:55:24] Abraham.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; He's talking to the elected seed.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm bypassing centuries.
[1:55:32] This one that stood with Abraham is here
[1:55:34] this morning talking to you.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Not me, him.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; I don't even know your individual
[1:55:42] situation. He does. Amen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; But he was when he was talking to
[1:55:46] Abraham and probably saying he was
[1:55:48] talking to his elected seed.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell you this morning.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; That was me back there and that's me
[1:56:00] here.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; And if you could believe that
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; I confess to you, I have a hard time.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I have a difficult time. And I'm also
[1:56:12] challenged at times. Do you believe
[1:56:15] exactly what he said?
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; And I and and I'm not talking about
[1:56:19] doctrine now. I'm talking about him
[1:56:22] producing forth
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; and saying this one is here at the
[1:56:26] platform.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; And friends, if I'm going to believe the
[1:56:30] message and believe everything that
[1:56:31] prophet of God said, you have to
[1:56:33] believe. And I have to believe that that
[1:56:34] same one, that same angel that was in
[1:56:37] the burning bush and stood before Moses,
[1:56:39] that same one that stood over the Holy
[1:56:41] of Holies in the Old Testament, that
[1:56:43] same one that was none other than the
[1:56:45] spirit of Jesus Christ, that same one
[1:56:47] that spoke to Paul on the road to
[1:56:48] Damascus all the way through, that's the
[1:56:51] same one that was with William Brandom
[1:56:52] was photographed. And that same one is
[1:56:55] still here right now. I am not saying
[1:56:57] that as some words to excite you. I'm
[1:56:59] saying that that is the truth of this
[1:57:02] word
[1:57:05] and we must not water it down. We must
[1:57:08] not well don't get casual with it.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I'm urging you to become believers,
[1:57:14] strong believers.
[1:57:18] You say, "Well, that tends towards
[1:57:19] fanaticism." Then go there.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Go there. I'll be a fanatic if I need
[1:57:24] to, but that's what I believe.
[1:57:27] I cannot water it down. I cannot
[1:57:29] diminish it.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; That same Jesus that stood there
[1:57:34] creating bread is the same one walking
[1:57:36] in this aisle today. The same one
[1:57:39] speaking to your heart. I know he's
[1:57:41] speaking to your heart.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Speaking to the elected seed.
[1:57:57] like there was in the days of Jesus.
[1:58:00] When the light flashes, that seed will
[1:58:03] come to life like that.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; They'll know it. They'll it'll
[1:58:07] understand it, and it won't have to say
[1:58:09] a word about it.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Revelation 22:17 said, "And the spirit
[1:58:13] and the bride say, "Come." The spirit
[1:58:15] and the bride say the same thing, and it
[1:58:18] is come. And let him that heareth say,
[1:58:20] "Come." Do you hear? I say come.
[1:58:23] I'm going to say what the spirit says.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Spirit of Jesus Christ, come.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And he that is a thirst, let him come.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And whosoever will, let him take the
[1:58:34] water of life freely.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Whoever heareth my voice today, let him
[1:58:39] be transformed from a nominal casual
[1:58:42] Christian into a Holy Ghost burning
[1:58:44] flame.
[1:58:46] In this hour of darkness, this is your
[1:58:49] time. I felt so impressed yesterday.
[1:58:52] This is your hour. Shine. Rise and
[1:58:55] shine. While others are dimming out.
[1:58:59] It's time for you to shine.
[1:59:02] Others say, "Well, we can do this. Well,
[1:59:04] we're just having a social nonsense. I
[1:59:06] don't want anything to do with that
[1:59:07] social thing. I turn aside from it. I
[1:59:11] announce to you, this is not merely a
[1:59:13] church."
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; We say CBW. That's just the name of a
[1:59:17] building. Has nothing to do. This is the
[1:59:20] church.
[1:59:21] God's not interested in these lights or
[1:59:24] all this sound equipment. He's not
[1:59:25] interested in that. He's interested in
[1:59:27] you as an individual. And that's all
[1:59:30] he's interested in. You are his own
[1:59:32] seed. You're his own elected seed.
[1:59:36] You're his own son and his own daughter.
[1:59:39] You think he's going to leave that? He
[1:59:42] who said without natural affection, you
[1:59:44] think he's going to leave those without
[1:59:45] spiritual affection.
[1:59:49] You're spiritually connected to him.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; You came out of his loins.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; You young people that have heard it and
[2:00:03] you've heard it in your church. This
[2:00:04] isn't this isn't even the message that
[2:00:06] you've heard at home.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; You haven't even picked it up the way it
[2:00:10] really is.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Meet the author.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You'll be changed forever.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:17] Hallelujah.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Won't take much. And I'm going to do a
[2:00:24] dance up here
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; because I'm so happy about it.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; For I testify unto every man that
[2:00:37] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[2:00:39] this book. If any man shall add
[2:00:43] unto these things, God shall add unto
[2:00:46] him the plagues that are written in this
[2:00:47] book. I have a ways to go. Say, hang on,
[2:00:50] friends.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; And if any man shall take away from the
[2:00:54] words of this book, of this prophecy,
[2:00:57] God shall take away his part out of the
[2:00:59] book of life, out of the holy city, and
[2:01:02] from the things which are written in
[2:01:03] this book. See, it's not just down here.
[2:01:06] It's over there in the holy city.
[2:01:10] This is your eternal. We're not here for
[2:01:12] the accuracy of uh you know, did you
[2:01:15] miss going to Sunday school? So on and
[2:01:17] so that's fine. That may be fine. That's
[2:01:19] just down here. We're not interested in
[2:01:21] that kind of accuracy. We're interested
[2:01:23] in hitting the mark.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; The prize of the high calling in Christ
[2:01:28] Jesus, eternal life.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. He which testifith these
[2:01:38] things saith, surely I come quickly.
[2:01:40] Amen. Even so come, Lord Jesus, and the
[2:01:43] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[2:01:45] you all.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; The accuracy of the scripture.
[2:02:00] Now I I must I must I cannot end this
[2:02:02] service without coming to the accuracy.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Of the vindication.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Now we've driven the nail, but now we're
[2:02:18] going to clinch it
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; so that nobody can pull it out. Nobody
[2:02:23] can go out this door and pull it out.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First of all, he says in
[2:02:29] Leodysian church age,
[2:02:32] first of all, that messenger is going to
[2:02:35] be a prophet.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; He will have he will have the office of
[2:02:40] a prophet.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; He will have the prophetic ministry.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; It will be based solidly on the word.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Because when he prophesies or has a
[2:02:51] vision, it will always be word oriented.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:58] and will always come to pass.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; He will be vindicated as a prophet
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; because of his accuracy.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; You might say, well,
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; and I I know I know I know of many.
[2:03:22] Well, I've been on the internet and
[2:03:23] there's all kinds of people that found
[2:03:25] all kinds of things wrong with brother
[2:03:26] Brandham's message. Well, go on the
[2:03:29] internet and find how many found things
[2:03:30] wrong with Jesus message.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; He said the proof that he is a prophet
[2:03:48] is found in Revelation 10:7. Amen.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; This is the proof of it.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[2:03:54] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[2:03:56] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:03:58] finished as he hath declared it to his
[2:03:59] servants, the prophets.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Who else has said, "Thus says the Lord,
[2:04:03] the church doesn't go through the
[2:04:04] tribulation."
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Who else has said that how the rapture
[2:04:08] and the change of the body and the
[2:04:09] change of these Adams? Who said that
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; in those words?
[2:04:14] Amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Who has said that this message is the
[2:04:18] power to transform?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; And do we see it? We do see it.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look what you got out there.
[2:04:25] If you don't think you have it, go and
[2:04:26] attend some of these churches. Help
[2:04:28] yourself.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Help yourself.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; To all the show and the Hollywood and
[2:04:33] the presentations and all these things.
[2:04:35] To me, it's just a it's a sham.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; When I say it to the world, I'm saying
[2:04:41] to the church, it's a sham. and to
[2:04:43] preach a trinitarian doctrine when it's
[2:04:45] not in the Bible,
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; not in the word of God. Can't find the
[2:04:49] trinity in the word of God and baptizing
[2:04:52] people in titles when there is no such a
[2:04:54] thing in all of the scripture. And
[2:04:56] everyone that was in the book of Acts
[2:04:58] was baptized in the name of the Lord. In
[2:05:00] the name of Jesus, in the name of the
[2:05:01] Lord Jesus Christ. And the same people,
[2:05:04] even ministers, shame on you,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; refuse to go to the water and be
[2:05:08] baptized in the precious name of Jesus
[2:05:10] Christ.
[2:05:12] What a shame.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; And you
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; you see it. Say, "Well, I don't
[2:05:19] understand." You see it.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; You've been brought up in it.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; You've been elected of God to hear it.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Not because you're some special person.
[2:05:28] You were born into a special family. God
[2:05:30] did that
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. God
[2:05:33] brought you into
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "I believe the Bible is
[2:05:44] accurate."
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus completely authenticated the Old
[2:05:48] Testament
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; when he was here on earth and it was
[2:05:51] compiled exactly
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; as was our New Testament.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Makes no mistake about it. We have the
[2:05:57] infallible word of God today and no man
[2:05:59] dares take from it or add to it. But we
[2:06:02] need the same spirit that gave it to
[2:06:04] teach it to us.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you're here tonight and
[2:06:16] thus sayith the Lord, the spirit of God
[2:06:18] that's within me, I tell the truth, I
[2:06:20] lie not." The very thing that vindicates
[2:06:22] it is is a returning of that prophetic
[2:06:26] spirit. The very thing that vindicates
[2:06:28] it is the returning of that prophetic
[2:06:30] spirit. It's the prophetic spirit that
[2:06:32] did the vindicating because it's God's
[2:06:35] spirit.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't think I'm off the my
[2:06:39] rocker.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; If I am, I'll just say, "Leave me that
[2:06:44] way."
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:48] He said that discerns the thoughts,
[2:06:50] tells you what you have done, what you
[2:06:53] will do, what will happen to you, every
[2:06:56] predicament, every time perfectly
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; for year after year.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I want everybody under 25 to say amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Everybody under 25.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Everybody over 25.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:14] year after year after year with
[2:07:17] perfection, vindication.
[2:07:20] Absolutely everything was true. What is
[2:07:22] it that is true? The spirit of prophecy
[2:07:26] fulfilling the prophecy. In that day,
[2:07:30] the mystery will be revealed. It's no
[2:07:32] mystery who the messenger is.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; One of you young people in school, this
[2:07:39] is a class you'll never get in school.
[2:07:42] All honors to brother Mr. Tatch and his
[2:07:45] wife, Sister Shelley, and all the
[2:07:46] teachers that are here.
[2:07:49] Maybe you'll take up some of this and
[2:07:52] incorporate it.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Every predicament year after year, he
[2:08:01] says, "That's the vindication
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; that I have told you the truth."
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; The truth. Yes.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Really?
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Now we've come down to you actually have
[2:08:16] heard the truth.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Not only that, you've heard God prove
[2:08:22] its truth.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Now, with all of that, I say, what have
[2:08:26] you done with the truth?
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Have you taken it as serious as your
[2:08:34] diet?
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Have you taken it as serious as your
[2:08:39] profession?
[2:08:42] or accuracy when you that are measuring
[2:08:44] a board or you that are cutting
[2:08:46] something and I know brother Sam Walner
[2:08:48] I worked with him he's a perfectionist
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; I said that tile looks good enough it
[2:08:53] just fits in no I said it's not good
[2:08:55] enough tear it up again have to tear
[2:08:57] that up oh I hate doing that we work so
[2:08:59] hard putting down no we got to put it in
[2:09:04] use all the strength and I just lean
[2:09:07] against him because he's the man with
[2:09:08] the muscles
[2:09:11] Got it all laid in there. Yeah, now
[2:09:14] that's good. Okay. Yeah, that's right.
[2:09:16] We're perfectionist, brother Sam. I said
[2:09:18] we're perfectionist. I was heavy on
[2:09:20] where we're where. We we I and you
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; and we have that kind of accuracy to lay
[2:09:30] a floor,
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; that kind of accuracy to cut a board and
[2:09:34] get it on the 45, Brother Nathan, or on
[2:09:36] some other angle.
[2:09:38] No, there's a spacer 16 of inch. That's
[2:09:40] no good. Cut it again. What do we do?
[2:09:44] Waste that whole board. Yeah, we got to
[2:09:46] cut it again.
[2:09:48] Going to go shooting. I went shooting
[2:09:51] with brother Brandham.
[2:09:54] I said I went out to an old elder who
[2:09:57] old elder brother. He was elder in our
[2:09:59] church. We knew nothing about the
[2:10:00] message. We'd heard that there were some
[2:10:02] tapes and we were in some brother
[2:10:03] Brandham's meetings and so on, but there
[2:10:05] was no messages such yet.
[2:10:08] And it was our first hunt. So just
[2:10:10] before we were getting ready to go, I
[2:10:12] said, "Brother Van, think you'd like to
[2:10:13] try your gun out and, you know, see how
[2:10:16] shooting?" Yeah. He said, "I think
[2:10:17] that'd be good, good idea." So went out
[2:10:19] to Brother Haney's farm and he got
[2:10:21] sitting down beside this little log
[2:10:24] building, you know, the logs come out on
[2:10:25] the ends and so he could rest his gun
[2:10:28] there. And and we got a big old piece of
[2:10:30] cardboard and drew some circles on it
[2:10:32] and had it about 100 120 yards away. And
[2:10:35] uh and he had shells in this and shells
[2:10:39] in this. I'd never been with the person,
[2:10:41] you know, he knew how many grains were
[2:10:43] in this shell and how many grains were
[2:10:44] in that shell and and you know how many
[2:10:46] grains of powder and you know what kind
[2:10:48] of powder it was and I just you know I
[2:10:52] never heard of all that scientific stuff
[2:10:54] before.
[2:10:56] But then he he he got down there and he
[2:10:59] said, "Now this should be about a half
[2:11:01] inch high at at 1:00." can do.
[2:11:04] We all run over there and there it was.
[2:11:07] And then he said, "Now this should be
[2:11:09] probably 2 in high at 12:00." Boom.
[2:11:11] There it was. And he kept firing. I I
[2:11:14] finally quit going.
[2:11:17] I just quit going. I I knew that's where
[2:11:19] it was. After about three times, I quit
[2:11:21] running down there.
[2:11:24] And uh when it was all over, he said,
[2:11:26] "Uh,
[2:11:27] would you like to try a shot, Brother
[2:11:29] Eddie?" And I thought, "Yeah, maybe I
[2:11:31] should." Cuz when we went out, you know,
[2:11:32] we'd just throw a gun in the backseat of
[2:11:34] the car, the truck, and and along the
[2:11:36] way, we'd find a tin can in the off in
[2:11:38] the ditch someplace and just shooting if
[2:11:40] we're anywhere near the tin can. Good
[2:11:42] enough for us.
[2:11:47] So he says, "Would you like to try a
[2:11:48] shot, brother?" I Yeah, probably I
[2:11:50] should. So I sat down. Now he says,
[2:11:52] "Now, how how do you like to shoot?"
[2:11:53] "Well, I like to pull the trigger."
[2:11:59] And he he was he was checking for the
[2:12:01] wind, you know. And wow, it's almost
[2:12:05] like shooting with a wind wind sock, you
[2:12:07] know. And so I I I got lined up with my
[2:12:10] gun. And he said, "Now, brother Eddie,"
[2:12:12] he said, "If you breathe, you breathe
[2:12:14] twice, you know, and on the second
[2:12:16] breath, you just breathe breathe out
[2:12:17] like that. On the second breath, just
[2:12:19] stop halfway." And he says, "That's when
[2:12:22] your heart kind of misses a misses a
[2:12:24] beat or something and you're dead still
[2:12:26] and fire." Then said, "Okay." you know,
[2:12:29] I'm going to try that. And so anyway, I
[2:12:32] I did my best and I think I hit the
[2:12:34] paper just to this big. So I I I didn't
[2:12:37] I don't think I don't even remember
[2:12:38] going to see whether I hit it or not.
[2:12:42] And Brother Brandham said, "Well, well,
[2:12:43] how do you like to shoot, Brother
[2:12:44] Eddie?" And I laughed. I said, "Brother
[2:12:47] Brandom,"
[2:12:49] I said, "If I see a moose, I I throw so
[2:12:52] much lead in the general direction, he
[2:12:54] can't get out of it."
[2:12:57] and he just laughed. Then he knew he was
[2:12:59] with some northerners.
[2:13:02] I know a lot of you folks, you can say
[2:13:05] amen to that.
[2:13:10] Now, can I conclude with something? It's
[2:13:13] maybe a little bit humorous, but it's
[2:13:15] very serious
[2:13:18] because I'm preaching a great burden
[2:13:20] about this message.
[2:13:23] And brother Bram talks about after a
[2:13:26] messenger comes
[2:13:28] and then within about three years they
[2:13:32] denominate.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; What is that? Tamper with the word.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; And he said now this has been going on
[2:13:40] for 15 years but now it's been going on
[2:13:43] a lot more than 15 years. And he talks
[2:13:45] about the messenger coming and then
[2:13:47] after the messenger comes people take a
[2:13:49] hold of his life and events and Make a
[2:13:54] tradition out of it.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; In questions and answers, we read the
[2:14:08] scripture. When that which is perfect
[2:14:10] has come, then that which is in part
[2:14:12] will be done away with. He says, "And we
[2:14:14] do have today
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; by God's help the perfect interpretation
[2:14:20] of the word with divine vindication."
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Don't forget the vindication with divine
[2:14:27] vindication.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Science he said about 35 years ago and
[2:14:40] that's a lot longer now. It goes back to
[2:14:42] about the 1919 1920. I timed it from
[2:14:45] where he was was about 1919 1920.
[2:14:49] He said they could they could only
[2:14:52] measure in 10,000th of an inch.
[2:14:56] In that they could make a model T Ford
[2:15:01] and with 10,000 of an inch piston ring
[2:15:05] which could give it the terrific speed
[2:15:07] of about 25 miles an hour.
[2:15:13] He said, "Did they stop there?" No,
[2:15:17] they're cutting in their rule. They're
[2:15:20] cutting in their ruler, their
[2:15:21] measurement, and measuring closer.
[2:15:25] Now, he says they can take the same
[2:15:27] piston in a jet plane and almost drive
[2:15:29] it 600 m an hour.
[2:15:33] He says they can even take that
[2:15:35] 100,000th of an inch and split an atom
[2:15:38] with it. Are they stopping? No, they're
[2:15:42] going on.
[2:15:44] But us, oh well, we're satisfied with
[2:15:48] what Moody said,
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; With what Finny said,
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; those men are all right.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; They're Christians,
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; brothers. That's in glory.
[2:16:04] The first time the rule was ever laid
[2:16:06] across the word of God, how do you
[2:16:09] measure it tonight? Said Martin Luther,
[2:16:12] come out and laid across Catholicism and
[2:16:16] found out that the just shall live by
[2:16:17] faith.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; John Wesley, he measured to the people a
[2:16:21] little closer.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; He cut to the ruler in a little closer,
[2:16:26] sanctification as they called it in them
[2:16:28] days. And and second work of grace. And
[2:16:31] look what he done. He introduced
[2:16:33] holiness to the church.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Along came Pentecost.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; And measured down to the gifts of the
[2:16:40] Holy Spirit, speaking with tongues and
[2:16:43] signs. And let us let us tonight lay the
[2:16:45] measure of God down and measure the
[2:16:48] whole word of God.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Who's saying it?
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Vindicated prophet. Let's lay it down.
[2:16:58] He's not saying it to himself. He's
[2:17:00] saying it to the people. I'm saying the
[2:17:03] same word to the people. Let us lay the
[2:17:05] measure down. We're We've been given the
[2:17:08] whole council of the word of God.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, it'll You'll never be
[2:17:13] the same after this service. You'll say,
[2:17:15] "What am I doing with that message?"
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:24] used to go out of this meeting saying,
[2:17:25] "I can never be the same again
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; because what I read, I'm going to
[2:17:30] absorb. I'm going to receive it and it
[2:17:34] will bring an accurate revelation of
[2:17:37] Jesus Christ." Amen.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Many of us you go down the road and in
[2:17:46] life and maybe your home, your
[2:17:49] individual life, your home, your family,
[2:17:52] your financial situation or whatever
[2:17:54] more may be in in in disarray.
[2:17:58] I can tell you
[2:18:01] thus sayith the Lord.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; This message has the answer.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. for every single need because it's
[2:18:09] Christ who has the answer
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; for every need.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; And I realize we have things that maybe
[2:18:18] seem impossible. Don't let that change
[2:18:20] your posture.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Your posture is I am a believer.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; God has sent me this word.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Live, die, sink, swim. Whether they go
[2:18:32] out in the world or whether my family
[2:18:33] does this, if they cast me off, whatever
[2:18:36] they say, that's irrelevant. This is
[2:18:38] what I believe.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; This church, this that church, that
[2:18:44] something down in Arizona or something
[2:18:46] up in the Arctic or something in
[2:18:48] Edmonton or something. We're not We're
[2:18:50] That's not our guide. That's not our
[2:18:53] standard. It's already been spoken.
[2:18:56] It's been delivered to us.
[2:18:59] And Satan wants to tamper with it.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; He wants to tinker with what you
[2:19:05] believe. And you have to say, "I'm not
[2:19:07] going to permit you to tinker with this
[2:19:10] word."
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Please, please, I'm trying I'm trying to
[2:19:19] I'm trying to stop.
[2:19:23] We're satisfied with what these other
[2:19:24] brothers, Martin Luther, Wesley,
[2:19:26] Pentecost, whatever more, but the whole
[2:19:27] word. And the same Holy Ghost that fired
[2:19:30] the piston back there and brought them
[2:19:33] out by faith and justification, the same
[2:19:36] one that gave sanctification, the one
[2:19:38] that gave the baptism to the Holy Ghost,
[2:19:40] the same power and the same Holy Ghost
[2:19:42] can move the church to perfection. And
[2:19:44] it will do it.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; And I have my confidence. I nail my
[2:19:49] confidence by faith right there. And it
[2:19:51] will do it.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Not me, not these brothers, not you, not
[2:19:57] anybody else. The word will do it. It's
[2:20:00] the life that's in the seed.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; It will do it.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; We just have to be obedient to it. And
[2:20:08] when he speaks to you, and today he is
[2:20:10] speaking to you and you say, "Yes."
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; I say, "Yay."
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; I'll say yes to you, Lord.
[2:20:17] I'm going to absorb that word
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; that the accuracy of the word might
[2:20:21] manifest itself in me
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; please do it
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; and it will do it to everything that God
[2:20:32] has promised in his word God will do it
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; he says and they're always trying to
[2:20:37] bring back the old thing back
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; listen friends
[2:20:45] what's all these
[2:20:46] you know, antique and
[2:20:49] uh flea markets. It's a good name. So
[2:20:53] that my fleas can become your fleas.
[2:20:56] It's the way I got it figured out. Just
[2:20:58] a transfer of fleas.
[2:21:02] My old junk can be your junk. And
[2:21:04] finally, somebody gets tired of the junk
[2:21:06] and hauls it where it belonged in the
[2:21:07] garbage in the first place. Go down to
[2:21:10] be recycled so it can come back and be
[2:21:12] new junk.
[2:21:17] always trying to bring it back. And now
[2:21:20] listen friends, are you tired?
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I go just a few minutes and
[2:21:24] then I'm done?
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; And now keep he says, "And now keep the
[2:21:29] horse and buggy. It's just a relic.
[2:21:32] It's history.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; It was all right in its day, but it's
[2:21:36] it's past that day. Shake hands with the
[2:21:38] preacher." And the day of Billy Billy
[2:21:40] Sunday, that was the common thing. and
[2:21:42] they shook hands with him and they lined
[2:21:43] up to shake hands with the preacher. And
[2:21:45] that's the first time I understood that
[2:21:47] phrase, shake hands with the preacher.
[2:21:50] And he says, "All right, a long time
[2:21:52] ago." He said, "But that's past.
[2:21:55] Denomination lived its day out and we're
[2:21:57] past that now.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; We're in the astronaut age.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; We're in the astronaut age."
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Hello, young people. We're in the
[2:22:03] astronaut age.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:09] That's what has got the people all
[2:22:12] turned around. They don't know what to
[2:22:14] think about these things. They don't
[2:22:16] know how to get it.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; They don't know what to think about
[2:22:19] these things. This kind of meetings that
[2:22:21] he was having the the two worlds. You
[2:22:23] don't understand. He says, "I'm standing
[2:22:25] in another world right now."
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; He just said it. I was just listening.
[2:22:28] He says, "I'm in two worlds."
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; That world, as I was saying to the
[2:22:33] brothers, I think yesterday, that world
[2:22:36] doesn't know anything about time. Amen.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; There's no yesterday and no tomorrow
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; and there's no thousand years ago and a
[2:22:44] thousand years in the future. It's
[2:22:46] timeless.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; You can't even understand that. So I
[2:22:49] can't even understand the dimension he
[2:22:51] was in. How are we going to understand
[2:22:52] what he says from that dimension?
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is? I'm going
[2:23:03] to cut things short. You know what the
[2:23:05] problem is? And the reason why I'm
[2:23:07] preaching so with such fervor and zeal
[2:23:11] is because I see things that perhaps you
[2:23:13] don't see, but you might live
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; beyond my time. I don't know. But don't
[2:23:18] let yourself ever be reduced to model T
[2:23:21] technology in the message.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; This is not a model T religion.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; This isn't even an airplane religion.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; This isn't some little rocket religion.
[2:23:32] This is an astronaut age. And you are
[2:23:35] here for the simple purpose that this
[2:23:37] word will have power over your life and
[2:23:40] over your substance. That you will
[2:23:42] actually change from this world into
[2:23:44] another world by the power of this word
[2:23:47] and by the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:23:49] that's here right now present
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; and of God so will that we could vanish
[2:23:55] into another world into another place.
[2:23:57] That's the word of God.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as Jesus resurrected, came
[2:24:03] back and walked with the disciples,
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; I expect it,
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; I expect,
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; the resurrected in Christ,
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; to come up alongside of me someday.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; I've watched for it. I've looked for it.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; And you might not even recognize them
[2:24:21] because they're going to be young,
[2:24:22] youthful. Maybe not the way you saw them
[2:24:24] when they left.
[2:24:27] Jesus saw Mary saw Jesus thought he was
[2:24:30] a gardener.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I've done this a time or two, but
[2:24:41] now in the context of this message and
[2:24:43] I'm closing,
[2:24:48] we hear everything. We hear so much and
[2:24:50] you have heard so much. I'm appealing to
[2:24:52] you that maybe just gone over your head
[2:24:55] or you know just oh I've heard it so
[2:24:56] much the word the word the word. No I
[2:24:59] bring it down
[2:25:01] right down where you're living.
[2:25:04] If there is a word of God
[2:25:08] and he's the author of it, he's under
[2:25:11] obligation
[2:25:14] to prove it.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; And once he has proved it, then we know
[2:25:19] that that is his word. Amen.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; And once we determine yes
[2:25:26] and you can go out of this service and
[2:25:28] you're going to sit in your seat and
[2:25:29] you're going to have to say yes,
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; that is the word because that is perfect
[2:25:35] vindication.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; And that is supernatural and no human
[2:25:40] knew that.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Then you must believe it.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that is really is you're
[2:25:55] really pressing it down, brother
[2:25:56] Biscll." I am because we're not talking
[2:25:58] about health or being healed. We're not
[2:26:00] talking about finances. We're not
[2:26:02] talking about marital situations being
[2:26:05] corrected. We're talking about eternal
[2:26:06] life.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; I want to go on the other side and I
[2:26:11] want to meet you on the other side.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; And listen, friends, I I examine myself
[2:26:16] continually.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; God, forgive me. Help me. Help me not to
[2:26:20] make error. Help me not to go the wrong
[2:26:22] direction. Help me to have the right
[2:26:24] attitude.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Help me. I need help all the time, don't
[2:26:28] you?
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; I don't want to miss the mark.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; So, he has a person. Now, we have what
[2:26:42] he said. It will be a prophet.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; He'll reveal the mystery. Amen.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Of God in the word.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Now he's going to reveal the mystery in
[2:26:52] the lives of not a hundred, not a
[2:26:54] thousand, thousands.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; You could have been there. It so
[2:26:58] happened it was another woman that was
[2:27:00] there.
[2:27:02] He says, "You're shook a little because
[2:27:05] I'm trying to get you quiet."
[2:27:08] So the woman was shook
[2:27:10] and nervous because he's trying to get
[2:27:13] her quiet
[2:27:15] for that which is on you now isn't isn't
[2:27:19] isn't to hurt you.
[2:27:22] So he's explaining it. It's to help you.
[2:27:26] It's his presence.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; You're getting dim to me.
[2:27:33] Why?
[2:27:35] because he's passing from this realm
[2:27:37] into another one.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; You're getting dim to me and that's his
[2:27:42] presence.
[2:27:45] Number one,
[2:27:48] you're doing some kind of mercy work.
[2:27:53] Number two,
[2:27:56] you are a nurse.
[2:27:59] Number three, and you suffer with a
[2:28:02] stomach trouble.
[2:28:04] Number four,
[2:28:06] you can't eat.
[2:28:10] It's a condition of the stomach that's
[2:28:12] causing you trouble.
[2:28:14] Number five, and you've got a place that
[2:28:17] troubles you in your back. Number six,
[2:28:21] and it was caused by lifting a patient
[2:28:24] one time and you strained your back.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Those things are true. Amen.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Now, if God is present to say what is
[2:28:35] true,
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; you know whether that's right or not,
[2:28:39] ever what he told you because he doesn't
[2:28:42] even know what he told him.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Ever what he told you is in your is in
[2:28:47] your back life.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Will you believe me as his prophet
[2:28:52] tonight?
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Now, surely everything six things he
[2:28:56] just told her true. actually more than
[2:28:58] six. Just told her was true. Surely you
[2:29:00] wouldn't ask her to believe something
[2:29:02] that was a lie.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; So now will you believe me as this
[2:29:05] prophet?
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Tonight you're healed.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; You can go. God bless you
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; for I see you in the time after.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; You're healed.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; I saw you before. I saw you. I see what
[2:29:26] you're doing. I see what kind of
[2:29:28] profession you have. You've lifted a
[2:29:30] patient. You've strained your back. All
[2:29:32] of these things. That's what you're here
[2:29:34] for. And now I see you after.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the kind of God I
[2:29:40] want to serve.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; He sees you when you leave out of here.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; He knows what's going to be this
[2:29:48] afternoon and when you go home. Isn't he
[2:29:50] wonderful?
[2:29:54] Amen.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; That kind of accuracy,
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; I want to trust my soul to
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; And now you may hear in your lifetime or
[2:30:09] encounter. And with this, I'm closing
[2:30:12] and I'm going to give you some sound
[2:30:15] advice.
[2:30:17] advice that I have used many times
[2:30:21] and it silences the critics
[2:30:30] when someone comes and they say, "Well,
[2:30:32] uh, you know, I've heard all kinds of
[2:30:36] stuff. February 28th, Brother Brandon
[2:30:38] was out hog hunting. There wasn't even
[2:30:40] any uh any uh there wasn't any season
[2:30:43] open at that one fellow said to me,
[2:30:45] "Does your prophet hunt out a season?"
[2:30:48] No, he doesn't hunt out a season.
[2:30:51] Says, "Well, I know that he wasn't there
[2:30:53] on that time because of March the March
[2:30:55] the uh March the 4th, he was down in
[2:30:57] Texas appealing for that boy who was on
[2:31:00] death row, appealing for his release,
[2:31:03] the boy that was on death row so he
[2:31:05] wouldn't go and be put to death.
[2:31:09] So he wasn't there on February 28th. I
[2:31:13] just looked at him. I thought, "You're
[2:31:16] so ignorant.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; You're so ignorant."
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; I lived in the north.
[2:31:23] I I I worked Wednesday morning in my
[2:31:26] wife's dad's store
[2:31:29] and it closed Wednesday afternoon.
[2:31:32] Wednesday afternoon, I just borrowed a
[2:31:35] gun. I didn't even own a gun. And I just
[2:31:37] borrowed a gun, threw it in the backseat
[2:31:38] of the car, and went out and got my
[2:31:40] first deer. And I was back for supper.
[2:31:43] And here's a guy trying to tell me.
[2:31:45] Well, he couldn't have been there
[2:31:46] February 24th because he went down there
[2:31:48] and in March he was down in Texas. And
[2:31:50] then he came back and he said, "I was
[2:31:52] hunting with the brothers after I came
[2:31:54] back." Well, that's fine.
[2:31:56] There's no mystery. I could be hunting
[2:31:59] with the brothers and say after I come
[2:32:00] back, you know. So, I went out. It
[2:32:03] didn't take me a whole day. Didn't take
[2:32:04] me three, four days. I just went out in
[2:32:06] the afternoon and got a deer. I went out
[2:32:07] in the afternoon little two three weeks
[2:32:09] later and shot a moose and was back the
[2:32:12] same night
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; back home and got up the next morning
[2:32:15] went to work. He says, "Well, it
[2:32:18] couldn't have been that.
[2:32:20] We're not here to try to satisfy
[2:32:22] critics."
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; And when I hear one, I just say this,
[2:32:27] and here's my conclusion.
[2:32:32] When you produce
[2:32:35] the kind of vindication
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; that followed this message, you come
[2:32:40] back to me when you have that
[2:32:42] vindication. And then I will listen to
[2:32:44] you.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Until then, you have nothing to say. You
[2:32:48] have nothing to offer. And furthermore,
[2:32:50] I don't want to hear anything from you.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; And you know what? They don't come back.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Why don't they come back? Cuz I haven't
[2:32:59] got the vindication. I want the kind of
[2:33:02] indication that says you're you're
[2:33:04] working in mercy.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; You're a mercy worker.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; You're a nurse.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; And you got a back stomach trouble and
[2:33:13] you can't eat and this is your problem.
[2:33:16] But they have another problem. I like I
[2:33:19] like the one that says he says uh I see
[2:33:22] another woman beside you. Another woman.
[2:33:25] It's your sister. No, it's your
[2:33:27] sister-in-law.
[2:33:29] That's the kind of indication I have.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Until those critics come back with that,
[2:33:34] let them go their own way.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; And they'll be damned by it
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; because they're following a lie.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; They're following the same one who told
[2:33:43] the lie in Eden.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Is that too strong?
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; No. That's what you want to hear.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; You want to hear it because you're
[2:33:53] elected seed.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Why you want to hear it? Amen.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; And I didn't preach this morning just to
[2:34:00] make people feel good. Even though I
[2:34:01] feel wonderful,
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; I spoke that you might be uh further uh
[2:34:07] uh s such an affirmation.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; And and that I would like to see within
[2:34:13] this congregation a commitment
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; far beyond what we have.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to be more attentive. I'm
[2:34:20] going to be more fanatical. I'm going to
[2:34:22] be more supportive. I'm going to support
[2:34:24] this work. I'm going to support the
[2:34:26] mission. going to support the ministry.
[2:34:28] I'm going to be there with my presence.
[2:34:30] I'm going to support the bride of Jesus
[2:34:32] Christ.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the young man is sitting
[2:34:40] listening to me right now
[2:34:42] that last Sunday I appreciated very much
[2:34:47] and he will forgive me if when I repeat
[2:34:49] this
[2:34:53] but he met me because he wanted to say
[2:34:55] something.
[2:34:58] said, "Brother Biscoll, I
[2:35:00] I used to be in involved quite a bit
[2:35:05] and and the things everything was
[2:35:06] happening, you know, in the church. I
[2:35:08] wanted to make myself available. I
[2:35:09] wanted to He said,
[2:35:13] and I kind of laid the vision down,
[2:35:17] but he said, I'm not fulfilled
[2:35:20] and I'm picking it up again.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; And I wanted you to know what can I do
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; you? Whatever my talents, whatever I can
[2:35:27] do for God, that's what I want to do.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; I say, God bless that attitude.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; That's the way we all want to be. Just
[2:35:36] do what we can do for the body of Jesus
[2:35:38] Christ. This is our only only
[2:35:40] opportunity to run and we're going to
[2:35:42] run it with everything that's in us.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians.
[2:35:55] God bless you.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:17] What should we sing?
[2:36:20] I had a one or two written down here.
[2:36:22] Let's sing. Uh,
[2:36:25] I'm amazed
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; that he loved me.
[2:36:29] All right. Would you stand with me,
[2:36:31] please?
[2:36:33] Can we say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; I hope that there's a sense within you.
[2:36:42] Don't Don't go back just to the same
[2:36:44] level. Just say, "I heard something. I
[2:36:47] want to reach out to it. I want to reach
[2:36:49] out to a whole new level of energy,
[2:36:53] a whole new call. Friends, preachers
[2:36:56] don't preach for their own health or
[2:36:58] just to make people happy. That's not
[2:37:00] it. And let's not have this service end
[2:37:03] just as another service. Say, God, what
[2:37:06] is it that you're saying to me? Praise
[2:37:09] the Lord.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you want prayer,
[2:37:13] there's brothers here to pray for you.
[2:37:15] You don't even have to come forward. You
[2:37:17] can have it right there where you're at.
[2:37:19] And it's not an alter call. We're not
[2:37:21] having an altar call. I just want people
[2:37:24] I I take you as a real mature
[2:37:26] congregation. But I want to nail I want
[2:37:30] to nail shut any possibility for Satan,
[2:37:35] this slicker, to creep in with his lies.
[2:37:38] I've heard enough and it just brings a
[2:37:41] heaviness upon my own soul. And so I'm
[2:37:43] saying that to you and I think I was
[2:37:46] very clear this morning, was I not?
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; If it's God's word,
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; he's duty bound
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; to prove it.
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; And he does prove it
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; with a supernatural
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; so that we know whatever you hear of the
[2:38:01] prophet's message. That's irrelevant
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; because you go right back to the
[2:38:06] vindication say he vindicated it.
[2:38:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, dear friends, I don't know how
[2:38:15] long I'm going to be around. I don't
[2:38:17] know how long you're going to be around.
[2:38:19] One thing's absolutely certain. There's
[2:38:21] never been a people.
[2:38:23] There's never been a people. You can
[2:38:25] just say your name, your age. There's
[2:38:27] never been a people that has been given
[2:38:29] such vindication.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; That has such a message.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; No one's heard tapes like that.
[2:38:36] No other generation heard it
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; where they could hear hear him uh hear
[2:38:41] this prophet of God. It's not even his
[2:38:43] voice.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; He says just it's my voice, but he he's
[2:38:47] the one who's speaking. Someone else is
[2:38:49] speaking. No one's ever had that.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; And that this is what's eating me up.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; How anybody comes without even a trace
[2:38:57] of vindication. You talk about a brazen.
[2:39:00] That's the same devil that could come to
[2:39:03] Jesus and say, "It's written." Who's
[2:39:06] speaking?
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Who's speaking?
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's written talking to the very word
[2:39:14] himself. That friend, that same demon,
[2:39:18] that same spirit is present in the world
[2:39:20] today
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; and ready to talk to you. It's second
[2:39:24] you'll give an ear to it.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; I say my ear has no room for that stuff
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; whatsoever.
[2:39:34] Hallelujah.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed.
[2:39:46] I'm amazed. I'm amazed.
[2:39:53] To your precious blood. I
[2:40:00] found
[2:40:01] and I see the
[2:40:07] heart
[2:40:14] away.
[2:40:24] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:40:37] I
[2:40:41] am
[2:40:46] all wash away. All I see
[2:41:00] want to turn around and shake hands with
[2:41:01] another redeemed one.
[2:41:04] What a joy it is. Glory. What a joy it
[2:41:08] is. Another redeemed one. God bless you,
[2:41:10] brother Timothy. Amen.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and
[2:41:32] all that is within me. Bless his holy
[2:41:34] name. Let's sing it together. I just
[2:41:37] want to worship. We haven't got another
[2:41:38] meeting tonight. I know the brothers
[2:41:40] have from Tacoma. God bless you, Brother
[2:41:43] Daniel. Brother Joseph, so happy to have
[2:41:45] you. Amen. All the others. Ah,
[2:41:50] hallelujah.
[2:41:54] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. All right.
[2:42:01] Bless
[2:42:04] my soul
[2:42:06] and all that is within.
[2:42:10] Bless his
[2:42:17] name.
[2:42:22] Bless the Lord,
[2:42:25] oh my soul, and
[2:42:30] me. Bless his holy
[2:42:37] name, holy name.
[2:42:41] For he has done great things. Great
[2:42:46] things. Yes, he has done great things.
[2:42:52] He has done great things. Bless his holy
[2:42:59] name.
[2:43:01] For he has done great things.
[2:43:06] He has done great things.
[2:43:11] He has done great.
[2:43:15] Bless his glory.
[2:43:20] Hallelujah.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; Praise his holy name.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Bless God.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you for this word,
[2:43:38] Lord. Thank you for this message. Today
[2:43:42] I stand behind this pulpit and before
[2:43:44] these people to declare, Father, my
[2:43:48] thanksgiving, my worship to you for such
[2:43:51] accuracy, for a vindication that was
[2:43:54] perfect. Perfect. Oh God, I just want to
[2:43:59] give you all the glory. You're just so
[2:44:02] glorious and so wonderful. Fill our
[2:44:05] hearts with the splendor of heaven. I
[2:44:07] pray. Oh God, I pray there will not be
[2:44:10] one that will be stooped over. I pray
[2:44:13] not one that will be burdened down, but
[2:44:14] they will cast their burdens quickly at
[2:44:17] the feet. Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the
[2:44:20] Lord. Oh my soul, Father, it is as
[2:44:23] though we're just ready to ready to
[2:44:25] enter into that realm. The word is here.
[2:44:28] The message is here. The Holy Spirit is
[2:44:31] present. Oh God, cause this congregation
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; to be ignited with a flame,
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; with a fire
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; that will catch the catch the catch
[2:44:44] others on fire.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God, stir, I pray, fill with your
[2:44:49] spirit.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll slay the enemy, oh God, at
[2:44:54] every point. Make these people to be
[2:44:56] mighty mighty warriors in a very dark
[2:44:59] time in a very confused time. You'll
[2:45:03] give them such stability. Oh God, bless
[2:45:06] every person. Father, I pray all the
[2:45:09] difficulties may vanish.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Oh,
[2:45:18] glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to
[2:45:23] God.

[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question in this song?
[2:45:35] Do you hear them coming, brother,
[2:45:37] climbing up the steeps of light? Clad
[2:45:40] and glorious shining garments, bloodwash
[2:45:43] garments, pure and white. Hallelujah.
[2:45:48] Join me.
[2:45:56] Let me hear it
[2:45:59] all my
[2:46:02] Oh,
[2:46:04] glorious shining garments.
[2:46:08] Watch pure and
[2:46:13] glorious
[2:46:19] in the blood of the lamb
[2:46:23] in the glorious
[2:46:27] farmer.
[2:46:39] till we all
[2:46:45] see the grand
[2:47:02] blood of the lamb.
[2:47:04] I am the glorious
[2:47:16] glory
[2:47:18] and I am
[2:47:21] walking in the blood of the lamb
[2:47:27] and your spirit might go and your spirit
[2:47:31] might upon Because
[2:47:35] again,
[2:48:03] Glory to God.
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; I send you from this place with the
[2:48:08] blessings of the Almighty
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; upon you
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; and ask you
[2:48:16] that you'll claim a different life in
[2:48:18] Christ.
[2:48:19] You walk out of this place and shine
[2:48:23] with a light.
[2:48:25] I felt I felt to tell you
[2:48:29] it's your time to shine. Amen.
[2:48:33] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet many, many people
[2:48:35] this week and they don't have this
[2:48:37] light.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; They don't have this hope.
[2:48:41] They don't have this promise. They don't
[2:48:43] have this Christ.
[2:48:45] You shine.
[2:48:47] You'll just shine with the glory of God.
[2:48:50] If a woman back in her denominational
[2:48:52] days, or I don't even know if she was in
[2:48:54] the denomination, sat and sang
[2:48:58] here, what was the name of that song?
[2:49:14] Come up here, Joel.
[2:49:29] We've got new we we've got new uh
[2:49:31] microphones also.
[2:49:34] But uh I wouldn't dare ask my wife to
[2:49:37] sing it. But
[2:49:40] you get the get the title. You know,
[2:49:42] this is an experience. This something
[2:49:44] God did.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; This something the woman I'm living
[2:49:47] with, she it was this before we were
[2:49:50] married.
[2:49:51] She's just a girl.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't we give glory to God?
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; And in that realm, there wasn't even
[2:49:56] empty yesterday,
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe that woman, the the sound is still
[2:50:02] there in another realm.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going to think I went
[2:50:07] right off my rocker. Tell you what, you
[2:50:10] just want to listen to that prophet
[2:50:12] enough times and see the realm that he
[2:50:14] was in, the world he was in, the realm
[2:50:16] he was in. That's where I'm headed.
[2:50:20] Glory to God.
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; What was the name of it?
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; I'll let you know the words. I won't
[2:50:31] sing it
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; real loud.
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:50:36] I wandered far in sin's dark shame with
[2:50:40] doubts and fears oppressed. I heard the
[2:50:43] voice of Jesus say, "Come unto me and
[2:50:46] rest."
[2:50:48] Jesus hath saved me. Jesus doth hold me.
[2:50:54] Faithful and true is he. He Jesus is
[2:50:59] nearer.
[2:51:01] Jesus is dearer than the whole wide
[2:51:04] world to me.
[2:51:10] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you can't doubt that that
[2:51:12] impressed a girl's mind.
[2:51:15] Here we are 60 years later. More than 60
[2:51:19] years later, she can tell you exactly
[2:51:21] what it was. Jesus is nearer. Jesus is
[2:51:26] dearer. Hallelujah. Go with those
[2:51:28] blessings. God bless you. You're
[2:51:30] dismissed in Jesus name. Thank you for
[2:51:32] being here today.
[2:52:18] Love.
