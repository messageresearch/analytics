and we worship you we love you we thank you thank you for what you're doing Lord open our eyes in our years to what you're doing and tonight what your spirit would say to the church we just want to be sensitive and yielded say yes Lord to your Holy Spirit in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you tonight can we turn to the book of Hebrews Thank You musicians and all that serve the Lord behind the scenes and labor so we can gather like this it's a blessing I just wrote a note in the back room and I was thinking this week there's not a lot of things in life that really bring peace and gratification and comfort to the believer like the present of the Lord just to be where he can touch us where his spirit can work and where his word is speaking there's nothing like it do we agree tonight I think that's why we're here and to hear this morning both of the specials and then tonight speaking about prayer and drawing close to the Lord that's good hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 2 3 if it's okay hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 2 3 these are their scriptures brother Branham used in a message Christ is identified the same in all generations 1964 Hebrews 1 verse 1 God who at sundry times and in divers manners or that means in many parts and many places spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image Amen of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high praise the Lord and can we turn to chapter 13 Jesus Christ is the same in all generations and Hebrews chapter 13 Paul speaking in verse 5 Hebrews 13 verse 5 let your conversation or your behavior be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee praise the Lord then the Lord is with us tonight for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me remember them this is good counsel remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever our last verses verse 9 be not carried away with divers are many strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein thank you Lord for your word god bless you can have your seats tonight it's good to be able to worship the Lord with you tonight and amen be able to be together so much more as we see the Day approaching tonight we'd like to speak on recognizing this day and in my notes I I capitalized this thi s this day recognizing this day and what to do and what to do recognizing this day and what to do most of you are familiar with brother Branham preaching 1964 in July recognizing your day and it's message that would be a good message to hear this week recognizing your day and its message but for tonight I'd I'd like to speak on recognizing this day and what to do so as we look into the scripture and then into the message it's it's good for us not just to look back but to look to our day this season we're speaking about this day or this time that we're at even 2020 or 2022 earth this very day to recognize it as an individual to recognize this day and then what you're supposed to do and as we look at this tonight we'll just fellowship for a while on this recognizing means to know and to identify so you're recognizing your day the hour that we're living in and to distinguish it from a past day it's it's to know the difference between what God did in your life maybe years ago maybe months ago and to be able to say but this is today Lord and I need your leadership for today and it's going beyond just the Bible days it's going on just beyond what brother Branham lived his life that was his day and to know his part and we could preach whole sermons and have weekends on recognizing the message and I believe the bride has received our message can we all agree on that there is not another message there's not another age and there's not another prophet to come Christ has already came so the bride has recognized her day and its message but tonight I'm taking it further we're bringing it up to this year and to what you're going through now it's important for us to recognize or understand to where you actually see it it's not the preacher it's not the pastor or the teacher or the visiting evangelist now it's you as a person recognizing and experiencing God in your own life are we all together so let's not push it out there shove it out there it's recognizing our day and it includes both parts and what to do so what to do Lord and and what where are you going in your life and what does the Lord have for you that word and what to do it's the second part of the message it's to know what he wants done with his word in your life amen now we're focusing in tonight I know it's Sunday night and and busyness and things but now it's knowing what you should do knowing what the word would be for your life it's to have his mind for your individual situation so it's not just globally bringing it locally and then honing in down on you recognizing what is the mind of the Lord for your situation it's for you and I to walk in a oneness with God just listen real closely for you to walk in such a oneness with him to wear him and you become a one where it's not just a quote out of it is the rising of the Sun she is him but it's now Christ in you you recognizing that it's another life and that there's such a oneness now between you and him and you're walking together that's that invisible union that is between Christ and the bride that produces the perfect will of God so now we're bringing all these messages and all the accumulations of of even what the Lord has done in our pastor's life and what we heard this morning and what God did for him and made himself real in his life but this generation this is your season to recognize God in your own life now we're taking it further than just coming to church and recognizing that he's here or he's in the ministers on the platform but now it's looking in your own life as a housewife as a teenager as a father now it's you getting ahold of God yourself it's you wrestling it out with the angel yourself it's you having God in your own life and having confidence that there has been an invisible union don't you desire that tonight it it's not a feeling it's not just my friends it's it's more than just my family it's more than just the group now it's God and you it's you recognizing your part in God so tonight I know it's Sunday night but it's where our actions and our moves are him where we recognize he is working in your life he is walking in your life God is dealing in your life and he's leading a people that's what we need to recognize so we have received the message of the hour let's just make it clear tonight not speaking about recognizing our day and the message God seen in a prophet I believe most of us here would say amen to that but now what we're really looking to the question tonight is where do you stand in this great cycle of life where do you as an individual where the Holy Spirit has been faithful to spread this message around the world fulfilling the Great Commission but now we're bringing it down to where you and God are one two where our life reflects that where our character reflects that from a true heart I'm not being so concerned about what happens on Sunday or Wednesday night I believe you have good ministry but we're speaking about Monday and Tuesday after the Sunday we're speaking about Thursday and Friday and Saturday after the Wednesday what's going on in our private life what's happening in our families where are we really living at in our character that's where we're honing in down where God can get a people that's so in one with him where she is him hallelujah is that okay tonight now in the beginning of this message Christ is identified in all generations he was talking about the words and how we've got to know when we come to him we've got to come with an understanding that's the way Christ wants us to come he said you have to have faith and what you're doing if you don't you just gonna kind of be haphazard and people begin to pray well I hope so he said it'll never happen well well I hope I have the Holy Ghost I hope that everything's under the blood I hope that when I get there I'm accepted that he said it'll never happen it can happen you can't have faith if you're going like that you must thoroughly know what you're going and know that it's going to happen and you're positive then it's gonna happen so tonight we're moving on a person just trying to intellectually trying to reach out and grasp for this or grass for their healing or grass for their loved ones it's to where it's a revelation it's where God Himself gets inside of you and you're thinking his thoughts your acting his life it's no longer you and him or Twain but now it's one that is the faith that the message has brought to us and now the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever brother Branham says and we want to know how he could be and how we would recognize him if he's here just as he was in any other time then we'd like to know how he is recognized among us he said we've got to have something that we can come to to some conclusion or we won't know where we're going I think he said that's the thing that would settle that would be the Word of God and regardless of our Creed's or our thoughts the Word of God ought to settle it amen the Word of God ought to just settle it for us amen so when we look at this our life now it reflects our seat when we hear the word and we go out to live our lives our walk reflects our seed now we're living in a very time of great trouble whether Derek sang the song that we there's nervousness in the land there's fear in the land its global where people are turning to this and turning to that and we just turn to Christ you know back in Israel I'm just quoting brother Branham preached in Phoenix in 63 about how Israel needed a way out of Egypt and they wanted some way some military strength or something to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians and God provided a prophet with the vindicated original word Moses so they were thinking one thing they were thinking one way and God sent him a prophet he said they wanted an army to raise up and take them out and beat the Egyptians down but God sent them the word the Prophet what The Vindicator word that God had spoke to Abraham thy seed so sojourn in a strange land but I'll visit them with a mighty hand let's not look back tonight God has visited us in our day he's brought us out with a mighty hand but we're not in Egypt and were not wandering in the wilderness we've got to be a people that's possessing our land we came out for a purpose that's to go into so it's not recognizing our day and what we need to do he's continuing on to say they were crying for a deliverer and God sent them a prophet with the word God had a provided way to tell the difference between the believer and the unbeliever today it's the same that's why I made that statement our walk reflects our seed God has provided a message to tell the difference between the believer and the unbeliever do you remember back in Egypt's day how God was singing plagues I'm going to remember that God was sending plagues out there and brother Branham said some of them said well if the plague Falls we'll just go to the hospital if the plague happens to fall you know what we'll do we'll go get dr. Jones and he'll know how to take care of it but the Branham said it didn't work yet they were very smart and they said well if the plague falls we'll just go down beneath the ground in a cave and shut the door down brother bottom said that won't do it one bit of good they said will stay in the house and put a mask over our face and put some disinfect on it he said it didn't do a bit of good God made a provided way and it was the blood tonight the bride has the blood here's a prophet coming right down in 1963 it was like he could have said that tonight we need that blood we have that blood we've got to recognize our day and now what to do and we're not under fear tonight the bride isn't operate by phobia we operate by what the word has said so sometimes we need services just to blow out all the flus because what the world is telling us and what's going on out there it's a whole nother realm in the presence of God this is where faith is this is where anything can happen and last Sunday we spoke on Ananias and Sapphira and about how the young men had to carry out a a brother and a sister we would have called them in the message in the church they physically took them out and buried them but today it's not so much natural death we're seeing it's spiritual death let's get our minds right away on spiritual things it's spiritual death where men and women can hear the word be under the atmosphere the Holy Ghost and walk in and walk L walk in and walk out and yet death has already gripped over their soul I'm thankful for a message and for a blood and for a repentance are we thankful for a token that is the blood that is our provided way God provided it I'm just continuing on as simple as it seemed to take the blood of a lamb and sprinkle the door yet God said that was his way and he honored it all out from under the blood died the firstborn in desperation when brother Branham talked about the father looking out the window and just perspiring and and we would say maybe nervous and what are you all burdened about and maybe the children asking why it wasn't because he was just humanly nervous he wasn't being controlled by fear but he just wanted to make sure everything was right and tonight that's where the bride's focus are to be on a Sunday night Lord we're just making everything ready because we're about to leave this world but let's take all of these things down personal it's important that we recognize or know or understand this day our time personally and what to do personally within our lives now in recognizing your day in its message this was a morning service in 1964 brother Branham is speaking and the Sunday before he had spoken on the Feast of the trumpets just settle into the word tonight as brother Marco said we're here to feast off the word just the Sunday before he had spoke on the Feast of the trumpets and he said I want to call your attention about this and the time of Israel as God's timepiece and I want you to realize and recognize the time that we're living we were just about to run out as you see and then by this you should know the very hour and time and sign and message that you are to receive then he starts talking about last Sunday feast of the trumpets and how we'd been speaking of the last trumpets of the Bible and me and myself I thought they would break forth just like the seven seals do you remember he was actually went down with Billy to try to get the part v junior high so they could go day after day after day but then he said he went into his room and the Holy Spirit revealed to him that he had already preached the trumpets under the seals so he wasn't going to have seven days in a row like the seven seven seals and he talks about the seven church ages and how they were so perfectly the Holy Spirit he said came down among us and vindicated it put it on the papers throwed it out across the nation throwed it in the moon and the heavens and proved it to us weeks and months before it happened and just the way it would be perfectly and here in the tabernacle he made it knowing do you remember he came down in the Branham tabernacle and and the Lord wrote on the back wall well exactly what brother Branham had on the chart on the platform that the hand came out and wrote it out on the back wall literally before hundreds of witnesses he said how in the tabernacle he made it known in the time and he made it known in the moon and son he made it known in the position of the nation's he made it known in the hierarchy of Rome left and went back to Palestine supposedly had been the first pope since they claim he goes on to talk about this then we see before the seven seals hid all the mysteries watch brother branham me not knowing what I was drawing on the board for the church ages I never God knows just by vision I drawed it not knowing that God a year and six months later was going to vindicate it in the skies by the moon and slip it across the national papers I didn't know that here's a prophet being honest but now the Lord Jesus was saying this is the time I'm gonna reveal it it was just step after step step after step and he admitted me not knowing and in he goes on to say I didn't know that I didn't know that there will be a mysterious blackout on the moon to represent this Laodicea age and he says he goes on to talk about if you would notice the spiritual application God said it in the heavens and there I said said it here on earth I left just a little bitty space as you see just a little tiny bit of light now if you have your church age book or want to look at it brother Branham made the last age with just a little sliver of light there how many remember that but he said that was just before the very elected was to be called from the earth is the reason I placed it there for the seventh age that this is what he says but when God put it in the heavens it was totally blacked out I'm gonna repeat that when God put it in the heavens it was totally blacked out it means maybe the last one is called from that laid will see an age we don't know so brother Branham put a little sliver of Gration there but when God put it in the heavens it was totally blacked out friends everything outside of this message is just blacked out tonight we unequivocally we should be able to say we have recognized our day and it's message but now God's honing it down closer for our young people for the middle age for the older we must recognize our day our individual day and our season and what to do and how to do it now as we speak about this tonight just to maybe bring it into focus tonight when we speak about our day I'm not going to speak about 1906 or 1907 though we could or 1956 when America rejected the word we're not going to speak about 1963 and 1965 and just just point on that tonight we've recognized God sent a message I'm not going to speak about 1970 or 1977 which was huge in the message people that had heard the word 1977 was huge because they thought the Lord was going to come and so many that had sold their houses or went out and bought things and they even married people thinking all the Lord's going to come and when 1978 rolled around they realized we got to go on are we all together they didn't recognize so but tonight I'm not focusing in on that or 1980 what was happening in the message or 1990 or 2000 and y2k who here remembers where you were in 2000 you that are 2030 older absolutely huh I remember where I was and you know people thinking of everything's going to end and it's all going to be over and planes are gonna crash and computers are gonna crash and 2000 y2k I'm not going to speak about 2005 2009 what happened even locally or 2010 that was another day I'm not going to speak about 2015 or even 2019 we must recognize in 2020 this is our day this is our season and it's very important that we catch what God is doing now what is the of God for now how should we handle ourselves now and what we're gonna look at a little later is brother bottom talked about people living in the glare of another age they can so describe and so bring to the people another time a past age another season and even make it so real but we're in this season we've got to leave this encounter tonight and say lord help me to know what you want done in my life to recognize our season and our day and what does the Lord want to do in your life you say what you should do that's the last part of our service title some would answer well what should you do and we could take whole services on that you say just surrender you know you just need to recognize your day and just surrender or just yield just yield to the Lord or some would say we'll just feed off of the word that's what you need to do brother just stay in a godly atmosphere and all these things are true we've got to find our place and our season and what to do you say we'll be under a good ministry well that's why we're here read your Bible pray every day eat the book eat the messages say that's what we need to do be filled with the holy spirit but I'm taking it beyond that tonight it is what does god one in this harmony with you and him what does he want to do now all of these things are important in as believers that we should do them every day but it's focusing on here's the head we are the body and walking together with him let's turn to Psalm 71 some 71 don't have a lot of scriptures tonight in fact this is our last one that we like to turn to have us turn to so when I read it this week I thought it would be good to share this as we recognize this day and what to do say what should I do in the situation we'll go to the Lord and ask him you say well I think that's what the ministry is supposed to do they're supposed to tell me now that's not what we're called to do we're here to preach the word we're here to feed off the word and go into the land and bring back fruits and as the believers feed off for that and the believer if we believe the message and the word even that we heard this morning there's a body that's operating so you feed off for the word you feed off of Christ then you go do what God is leading you to do and if it is the Holy Spirit it won't be contrary to the word that's what's very serious Psalms chapter 71 are we doing okay tonight in VO Lord do I put my trust let me never be put to confusion now if you were in your private devotion you might just stop there and say yes Lord I put my trust in you take this confusion out of my heart I don't mind my whole situation I commit to you deliver me and my righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me be thou my strong habitation we run - I'm a continually resort thou has given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress deliver me O my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man verse 5 for thou art my hope Oh Lord God thou art my trust from my youth it was like David was giving this testimony thou art my trust from my youth by thee have I been holding up from the womb thou are he that took me out of my mother's bowels my prey shall be continually of thee what wonderful scriptures praise His name I am as a wonder among unto many thou art my strong refuge let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honor all the day cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth is that what the Bible says I want to bring your attention to verse 5 how David was speaking about the hope of the Lord and his trust from my youth and then verse 9 says cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth the Word of God has something for all of us from our youth middle-aged or old age God is with us and I just thought it was so wonderful how David could identify with his youth but he also was coming in verse 9 and didn't want to be cast off in the time of old age or feel worthless or it's like I have nothing to do and I need to fulfill something I need to be active David was recognizing Lord don't cast me off in the time of old age and forsake me not when my strength faileth because there will come a time when our strength begins to fail and David had a desire and I think it's good for us tonight whether you're young or whether you're old to know that our strength cometh from the Lord but it's important to recognize our day whether we're a youth middle-aged or older to recognize our day and what to do let's just skip down to save some time in verse 16 Psalm 71 verse 16 I will go in the strength of the Lord God I will make mention of thy righteousness even of Vine only Oh God thou hast been thou has taught me from my youth and here - have I declared thy wondrous works now also when I am old and grey-headed oh God forsake me not until I have showed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to everyone that is to come here's David knowing that from a youth from a little shepherd boy God was with him and he was saying in verse 17 God thou has taught me from my youth and verse 18 now also when I am old and grey-headed O God forsake me not that is the same thought Lord don't cast me aside don't forsake me you are my inspiration you are my comfort you are my health you know when people are young they can almost out I'm gonna say this lightly but seriously it's almost like they don't need God they got their health they got their strength they can make decisions they can go places but as they begin to walk through life and mature they find out very quickly people need to lure it and that's general but it's got to come down I need the Lord we need the Lord our family our marriage our church now you're honing in you're recognizing this day you know we're reading out of Psalm 71 but it's 20/20 he's still our God and I was when I was reading this I thought for all of us and verse 17 God has taught us from our youth hasn't he been so wonderful even this morning as brother Bisco just said kindly and it's nice to see a sister Debra I was thinking of you this morning brother Bisco was mentioning brother brother branham and how he spoke so kindly of the natives and and of that that group of people it speaks of leadership and how those under our message ought to have the same kindness toward every culture we're not prejudice we're not against people for this and just because of this this message has come for a global revival in fact I wrote in my notes lord help us to be more kind you say that's not deep in this generation that's very deep the world is so cruel and against an opposite the Lord is our kindness David was saying from a youth you have taught me to be this certain way but then he said in verse 18 I hope this is OK now also when I am old and grey-headed Oh God forsake me not he recognized his day and where he was living and where he needed to go he wasn't manic making an excuse for his age he was standing and saying we had the Lord and we have the Lord when I am old and grey-headed O God forsake me not until I have showed thy strength unto this generation I believe it's in every son or daughter of God to just keep pushing keep serving God you want to do as much as you can for God that's why it's very difficult to ask a soldier to lay down his sword it's like we'd rather die with the sword in our hand than give it up but it's important to recognize our day and what we need to do now brother Branham preached several other messages and I'm just going to move along because of Sunday night and people's tiredness but he also spoke hearing recognizing and acting on the Word of God it's another good message and in this message this is important for tonight he's speaking out of Romans nine eleven where the children not being yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth now how many believe the word of God I'm gonna speak about Jacob and Esau but I'm gonna bring it quickly into the token I'm gonna bring it quickly into how we ought to be believing today recognizing this day and what we need to do but the brennaman hearing recognizing and acting is quoting Romans nine eleven and twelve it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated and and brother branham goes on to give his title hearing recognizing and acting on the Word of God now he's just opening the service he said we see in these two sons Jacob and Esau that when they before they were even born they were at war with one another even though their virgin mother how many remember Rebekah married Isaac let me remember that then you have then you have Jacob and Esau even though their virgin mother and brother Bram said she was a virgin the beautiful Rebekah that married the righteous seed of God's promise Isaac they were two consecrated spirit filled believers on God for ordained to the very marriage that they United together by God foreknew it and how could such a thing come through that one mother and one father one a very evil person and another a very good person how that the good person looked to be the evil and the evil looked to be the good he said that always has been and always will be God's program God cannot change his program because he makes his program perfect it's a part of him and we believe that tonight how out of a righteous father and mother could you have an evil person and a righteous person he goes on to say these two sons it is strange to know that when they were born of the same seed from Isaac which was the promise and the first son Esau that was born we found out that not only were they fussing and fighting in the womb of their mother but they came out fighting Esau coming forth and Jacob grabbing ahold of his heel and they are still fighting he says how that it could come from that perfect pure elected holy consecrated father and mother he said because God calls by election it must be no matter how good your father or your mother was or how nice they was how much Christians your father and mother was it still lays in you as an individual you're standing before God this isn't very important that this be spoken tonight it's going to help parents but it should help every individual it's God that elects who was gonna be his bride he said this lesson teaches that both the children they were even by the elected called of God father and mother virgin woman and holy man who finally was to bring forth his seed through Jesus Christ he was tested and his father before him and he was promised through the seed of Isaac that the whole world would be saved how many remember when they went down to that Philistine a king there and and God was so adamant about the seed being saved that I'm gonna remember that and God spoke to that king and said don't touch her God was preserving the seed you remember brother BAM said God plagued that man's house and said you're as good as it as one dead holding that blood stream pure and rebekah righteous holy God sent God called mother and from that holy seed come forth a renegade a renegade and a believer so it lays within God's callings and God's election before either was born God said I love Jacob and Haiti saw before they was born so he said how we are how aren't we to feel someone has God who has God speaks to you and invite you to come to his table and comes to his home to be his son or daughter there's nothing so great as that I say amen to that if God calls you to be his son or his daughter I aren't right ahold of that he goes on to say the nature these two boys if we'd watch their nature one of them was a spiritual man and that was Jacob and the carnal man was Esau and yet they were both religious and that same thing he said has taken place all down through the Age the carnal and the spiritual Esau represented the man of the earth natural religiously inclined but never Abel it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb past the things of the world the carnal things but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it one purpose that Jacob had and that was he longed for that birthright no matter how he got it he just had to get it and that's evidence of a seed of God they loved the birthright now he continues on and I know this is a little bit laborious I could have put it on the screen but just follow along that spirit of that one birth is still represented he said in the world today and it's coming to a head now the spiritual believer and the carnal believer no man could say they wasn't both religious they were and they didn't say that one served in Idol and the other served God they were both servants of God and he goes on to say plate pay close attention to the scriptures on this subject and I'm sure it'll help you not in every one that says Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and that's you there's something in you that just craves the will of God I'm just skipping down here he said Jacob means sir planter or deceiver that was his first name that meant a supplanter deceiver but after finding and coming into the possession of the birthright he was changed that's the carnal changed he was then called Jacob a prince with God who's wrestled with him now the carnal believer today Oh as long as I go to church and do what's right what difference does it make that's Esau's group he makes fun and he despises the birthright he doesn't care for it but Jacob loved it you know we can have that in 2020 even in our church people despise that they don't want a move of God and a spirit comes on them they become hostile against the message they become hostile against you be careful friends that's not the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God is always moving a believer toward repentance toward the Holy Ghost thank God for that tonight he said it's the only thing that matters to them is just get that birthright that's what they're interested in he said now don't blame the people they can't help it they were predestinated to that they were elected to that god help us tonight to be led by the Holy Ghost I just took a big leap but I pray for all of you that is seed of God there's already something in you that is stimulated by the Word of God and people that are just stimulated by worldly things and carnal things and that's the way they lean friends if I was you I would lean closer to Christ let's just take a little turn for just a moment it's this kind of sobering maybe serious thought an individual could actually recognize the moving of the Holy Spirit in a past season they could actually recognize the word for another season maybe describe it maybe put it out so clearly can't you see how the Holy Spirit moved there or what do you did for that person but then miss what God is doing now and that will not produce life today that's why it's so important to hear what the Spirit would say now in 2020 I'm not focusing on back when you gave your heart to the Lord or you repent and now it's been 10 years 20 years it's what is God doing now you could have been face for then and God bless you but we're looking to tonight recognizing this day being sensitive now knowing what God wants with his word now so important today friends when we speak about I'm just using brother branham's language the glare of another age another time or a past era that was a light that shone for that day and let me just stop right here and make something very clear there's not going to be another message for the bride than what we've already received there's no preacher you need to follow there's no internet Church somewhere you need to tap into and hear their weekly services there's no newsletters or email list there's no cell phone you need to have in your cell phone and that's your connection with God you must have God yourself and wrestle it out and say I have met Jesus Christ I go to church two feet off the word I love the family of God we pray for healing we pray for deliverance but it's God's will to be done so let us not be guilty of recognize what happened God did in the past and then be falling all over and stumbling over what he wants to do now it's called a glare of another age let me just read to you out of Los Angeles looking to the unseen when brother Branham was talking about do you remember those geese that had went off and flew off to England he said these geese they kept going back and forth and and one kept calling calling but he was so far off until he flew all the way to England and many of them perished in there going he talked about how every year it was in those geese in the fall of the year they would swarm and they would get all together they're ready for a revival but they don't which way to go they've been led so far off the track till they can't find their way back again it's because of leadership it's because of someone saying let's go here and they all follow they went over to England yet it's in their heart to swarm and we want to go somewhere and we want something to happen but let's bring it spiritual because we're the Brendan brought its spiritual into the church and talking about how people would follow after this and follow after that they are so far off the track till they can't find their way back again and it's so easy to put it way out there but we're bringing it down here tonight to you and I as a person a person can get so far down a track so in a mess and things happen in their lives they can't find their way back tonight we need to grab ahold of that calling and that election and say God you know what I need in my life and if you're at any level of leadership or influence with someone else then you're responsible to do the right thing be a leader do the right thing and sometimes that's to MIT I am wrong get us back up on track and the rejected King brother branham was talking about it was brother Jean that I think it was jingo that brought it to him it was a magazine of those geese and how they had a leader and they had picked him to be a leader and here's some time ago a bunch of them they didn't know where he was going and didn't know his directions and his instinct wasn't just right he flew a bunch of geese all the way to England they'd never been able to come back their nature is to migrate every year and they just get together and squawk and holler and carry on over there in England and they don't know how to get back home he say oh that's a funny story it's very sad when you have individuals that go after this and run after that and then years go by I'm speaking about marriages we're speaking about a brother that just bounces around here and there and then wonders why is young ladies and young girls grow up to be haphazard - it's a time that the father's this is the token I'm preaching the token tonight that they recognize their day their season and literally apply the word to their own families brother Branham brought this right back to Jeffersonville in the message guide and talked about that and how they had to know and follow he didn't know where he was going talking about that leadership they went over there and they couldn't get back but now I'm just gonna end this thought on in the individual hearts of all of those gifts that had follow they still swarmed so it's amazing how people can get all excited and get all this and go after that and think that it's the blessing of God and they can grow and raise families and they can all swarm and swarm and let's have a singing let's have of this let's have a gathering but this is our day this is our season what is God leading you to do in your life he said they swarmed around and around in England and they don't know how to get back and he talks about how people would have a swarm and and a big protracted meeting and a revivalist come along and preach awhile but you don't know where you're going he's talking about individuals that they can have a protracted meeting say we need a revival we need something to happen but when it comes down to the end they don't know where they're going they don't know God's leadership for their life they don't know how to pray and what do I do that's when an India the only thing that we need is the blood and the Spirit of God to lead the Bride of Christ he takes the message that he's already brought and he'll lead you into a rapture friends were not going to make it without the message and you're not babes in Christ and we're not little kindergarten children around the throne of God I'm not speaking on recognizing your day and it's Sh tonight I'm speaking on recognizing this day and what we need to do specifically that means the individual being sensitive to God now we're what we're actually doing pretty good and they're in the end of the service isn't that wonderful everybody doing all right hey man I got one over here hey man how many knows what a mirage is mirages were you look out over the road or look out over the sand and it looks like there's water coming up you see this in warmer climates and you that have traveled and you go open around and you look out and there's like a mirage coming up brother Branham talked about this how when people get to that state and they get anxious and they they're looking for answers and they want to know direction and they get to that state he said the devil begins to show you mirages he said you know what a mirage is did you ever go down the road and look and see the sun shining on the road it looks like a lot of water how many knows what I'm talking about it it looks like a lot of water he said it'll fool you and he talked about a bunch of geese coming from Canada or ducks and they'd seen one of these mirages on the road and they fell in the road and they all burst it open and they thought it was water so it goes back to their thoughts he said this is safe this is what we need to do and they all landed and they all burst it it was a mirage and he said oh the devil's got many a pitfall for the people it looks like it I've seen people thirsty where they run into these places and fall into them and think they was in water and it looks like a big running water and throw sand upon their head thinking it's water and it's nothing but hot burning sand now this part of the service is a warning people can run after this job or run after this certain hobby or they can spend maybe months or years of their strength when they should be giving it to the word and asking what God would have for them and they but just bursts apart it's just a mirage and you and I would probably think it's funny maybe going to Arizona and and to Africa and people sitting in the middle of the sand just throwing sand on their fit you probably say they lost their mind you say what happened to that person they lost their way no this is water this is water isn't this so good you say they have lost their way I remember some years ago where the West might remember this and I remember being in a certain place and there was a brother that was in the church and he you know you can put yourself into a room and think you're getting close to God and I'm just gonna get alone and get with God and I'm just gonna be the certain way and you're not eating and you're not drinking and pretty soon you start getting hysteria you start seeing things and this poor brother started foaming at the mouth and started being in a certain way you know people can lean and you can say all that spirits or the sister or that brother and and they lean toward dreams or certain visions or God told them be careful because the result of their walk or what happens after shows whether that was God or not and friends this isn't the time to get yourself all crashed up and say well I'm just trying to seek this and we're gonna do this and make sure it's the will of God it's recognizing your season it's having understanding about where you need to go or what we need to do I wrote in my in my office this week just a note on my desk I wait until I know what he thinks and what he desires for the specific situation I wait until I know what he thinks and what she desires for that specific situation she say well brother John I'm past that I mean we're up to decision time we're up to a time where something needs to be done and I need to go a certain way or something needs to happen I'll just leave it right there because the Holy Spirit knows exactly what he wants done in your life because knowing the word today is more than just quoting the word it's more than just repeating favorite passages are we together you say I know the word I know it's more than just repeating and saying key phrases in the Bible or in the message the devil's not afraid of that he's afraid of a son or daughter of God where it's Christ speaking through them it's more than just having favorite quotes that you like and center in your life all around that and just repeating that and just saying that and friends it can be intellectual and don't think that I'm being contradictory I'm saying for you there has to be where the Holy Spirit says that thing where it's the Holy Spirit saying this is what we need to do friends it must be the mind of Christ for today it's what she wants now were you and I'm just going into a channel here where you step into a channel of divine inspiration where the pulsation of the Holy Spirit brings it to pass you know I was thinking on Friday as I was preparing this about Hattie Wright and how she was in that room and this might bless some of you how she was in that room and message of grace brother Branham talks about Hattie Wright and how she asked for her two children for the salvation of her two children and and how these two children were and he said I give you your children in the name of Jesus and they fell right across her lap how many remember brother Edie Dalton brother branham spoke it would be a wonderful little study for you as he talked about brother Edie Dalton in the message he was a Baptist man that began to hear the message and brother Branham talked to him and he would come to some service and then he just I'll just read a couple of these things he said Edie Dalton a Baptist sitting back there from in Kentucky sitting right there how many children you got twelve children I told you I was going to get into the token here it is standing right here he asked for his children and I walked out of the building and Edie come to me and I said Edie the Holy Spirit was on me and said give it to him give him and I said I give you your children and every one of them saved and baptized and there was his teenager sitting at home waiting and crying has been saved since he was up here he said how wonderful that he is when he speaks I'm asking him now for his glory to show himself that he's Christ that I'm telling you the truth in another message he said II Dalton seem that I'm saying this for a reason he was praying for his children and he got outside and he turned back around and the Holy Spirit said speak French children and I said brother Dalton the Holy Spirit tells me by that same gift that we're looking to be perfectly manifested I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ and when she got home it's a Baptist person but he believed the word and it was the Holy Spirit spoke to brother Branham said go tell him and brother Brown can I give you your children I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ and when he got home his son and daughter had already give their hearts to Christ just a few miles down the country from me and I think every one of your children is saved and filled with the Holy Spirit isn't that right brother Dalton is there any of the with you one daughter or was that the one that was saved right away then the oldest daughter was saved the next morning and every one of his children is saved when God says anything he keeps his word now how could I have saved those children now watch this brother Branham is saying how could I have saved those children it isn't if it's not your own words if it isn't your own thinking if it's ever what's inspiring you if it's God then it's God's Word so you can see in these meetings and see what things are happening that's not me I couldn't do that it's God doing that if you'll just believe it then all you have to do is just believe it let me believe that tonight now yesterday I followed up with a person that's related to that to the Dalton family and all 12 of those children receive the message and walked in the light of this word so it's not just that they were saved but they received the message that's key we can apply the loved ones and we in our house shall be saved but for them to believe the message and be bribed that's God's choice and I don't want to be negative or sound opposite but howdy right sons I believe they were saved I believe they will be safe I believe on that great day they they are saved and will be saved but if you'd ask the question did they go on to receive the message and believe like you and I do the question is no oh so you say what's different they are saved but now that seed of God whether they're part of the bride that's God's choice and the individual now makes that choice manifested by how they live their lives friends I think we ought to believe for you and your house shall be saved hallelujah God gave you your children and they shall be saved I just think it's a great testimony for the Dalton family to have 12 of their children all be saved and then when I followed up yesterday said all of the children believed the message and have gone on to serve the Lord in the light of this word that's incredible you say well that's not my family or that's not how it is friends I'm giving you a testimony God's Word is true you just manifest that you're a son or daughter of God God by finding in your day and in your season you believe the word you know in the message queen of the south brother Branham was talking about brother Dalton I just have a couple more things to say before we close and he said brother Dalton I wanted a something I'm expecting brother Dalton was talking about the squirrels and the new ministry and sister Hattie right he said he's standing here at the church and his children and teenage they were reckless as could be and we'd been praying for his children and all at once that same Jehovah Jireh turned around and I said I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ and every one of them is saved now this is another message he just keeps referring back to it every one of them saved and he said there's there's a and he had the brother stand there's a Kentucky Baptist preacher with the Holy Ghost you know how D right had a great desire it wasn't money or it would have dropped into our lap let's bring it down to tonight you say recognizing this day and there's a lot of maybe needs among us financially but there should be a greater desire in all of our hearts that that those around us are saved she was a poor sister the Mosier family the right family for the Brenham had money in his pocket to give back to her so it wasn't money it wasn't just for the health of her family she had a crippled a relative her mother and dad was there she even asked brother Branham what what should I ask for and brother Branham said you got an old father and mother you've got a crippled sister she's been sitting in the chair you could ask for her you could ask for your mother your father you're poor you don't have any money ask what you want she said well I don't know what to ask said I just don't know but she said my greatest desire is the salvation of my two boys and immediately brother Branham said I said I gives you your boys in the name of Jesus Christ and they're both converted loves the Lord Jesus has been baptized in his name thank the Lord for that inspiration let me just say something about that Mirage don't let the devil make something look so good and you follow after it and crash up somewhere in communion brother branham set out in the deserts and men have lost their lives and things from thirst I could tell you stories of he said how the devil gives you a mirage you've seen him you don't want to go west he said you see him you go down the road it looks like there's water down the road every one of you seen that and drove on the highway that's a false Mirage and maybe some the Lord just gonna help somebody hear a false Mirage here's some time ago three or four years ago he talks about those ducks flying across the country they've seen a mirage and they sell on the road thinking they were hitting the water and they just disintegrated hit the hard road they thought they were landing on water it was a mirage and I was just thinking about that when someone feeds on things of fantasy through the week they can hear the message hear the word be in good meetings but then through the week they're feeding off a fantasy they're feeding off imagination they're feeding off things they are not - that will lead a person to live a false fake life and it's not real they live a life before the believers they can sing they can shout they can raise their hand they can say I love the Lord but if through the week they're feeding off of fantasy it's a false life don't be disintegrated and even on you'd say on the positive now I'm close because a person could say well brother John but I have good desire and I had and this is recognizing your day in its message what brother Branham was saying everyone is complaining and ministers crying it's in the papers and brother and sister hair more and The Herald of his coming and they won't print anything unless it's fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet and he says how many reads it you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're gonna have a great breaking of the day there's a great something going to happen and they they're getting people to look for another day he said why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying and believing that there will be an awakening they're good people but what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the brides good people say just let's do this let's do that let's sounds like the the firefighter squirted a little water over here squirt a little they had to desire it had good intent but they weren't trained by the word brother branham said they have not recognized the awakening of the bride and by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done and that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you friends could it be possible that today God is revealing himself to you this day for you to go a certain thing or do it that's God's will for your life can you take that lord help us to recognize our day help us to recognize this day and what to do in Jesus name Amen god bless you tonight hallelujah glory to God he's the same in every generation find your place and go do it so now it's not babying around and and baby and everyone but it's now individuals fighting their way I'm a seed of God be like Jacob I'm gonna wrestle and grab a hold of this Lord getting serious getting sober it's amazing how people can find God's will and the musicians can come find God's will for everyone else's life and they're stumbling around themselves they just don't know they don't know what to do and then they can just describe everyone what they oughta friends it's time they're individually we find our day our season and what to do and it's not a great mystery you say words it's just all a mystery know life isn't all a mystery sons of God are led by the Spirit of God he reveals the mysteries say well let's go read the Seventh Seal book no it's you finding God's will for your life and going in doing that and I would go listen to this heaven seal don't get me wrong but it's in the word that you find your place and the Holy Spirit can anoint you don't follow after mirages are we all okay tonight don't follow after somebody they say oh let's go here let's go there and swarming around you follow the Holy Spirit let that be a great encouragement tonight as we stand tonight glory to God we are the generation we are the consummation final voice the world will hear we are the generation [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] has the question tonight some might say well it goes without saying who wants to recognize your day we want to recognize our day this day spoke about Esau and Jacob and if you want to follow that through even into Moses and month under Moses ministry many were saved and called out and came out under that first token and many died in the wilderness they couldn't go all the way under that Joshua and Caleb spirit so they came out under Moses ministry they were saved they were called out but it was that Joshua and Caleb group that inherited the promise and that's the group that the brightest part of [Music] that's the positive if you want to read judges it talks about another generation that came up that didn't know the Lord [Music] yet their mommy or their daddy could have came out under the toque and they say we believe the promise let's go into our land but individually we've got to go into our land and tonight serveth has been for us in 2020 to recognize we've received a message but it's not good enough to just leave it out there broad and it's to hone it on down for you for your house recognizing this day and what we need to do don't die in the wilderness somewhere don't drown out there somewhere and you find your place [Music] and I mentioned the word hostile if you if you listen to recognizing your day in its message brother Branham talked about people and the ages they get hostile against those that are finding their place even Jesus they got hostile against him you find it in Noah's day and he said the reason people in Noah's day did not get in the ark is because they never recognized the message or the message messenger that's the only reason they perish is because they didn't recognize the hour that they were living they didn't recognize that God would deal with sin as he promised he would and here we are today God dealing with the bride in a certain way I just pray he bless each one of you as we bow our heads tonight Lord Jesus we are blessed people to fear Lord now this message can go throughout the whole world and the languages individuals labored and work to get into every tongue now we have men and women rising up pray that your anointing would be upon every seat every elect seed upon every family those that are even within our church and those that have heard these things this morning and today that we would follow on and in maturity recognizing this hour and this season and what they need to do housewives would recognize it fathers would recognize it young people older ones from our youth you have taught us these things and even as years have gone by and elders now have carried this torch for many years help us now to recognize this day and this season and this time that we're living now and what we need to do bless your people Lord may there be healing this week even last week I'm sure if we talk to each one of the ministers they've prayed for ones privately or been to certain places you have done miracles this past week you have done great things this past week Lord and often times we don't speak about them publicly or make loud declarations but you are answering prayers just a couple Wednesday nights ago brother Michael ray and I prayed for several individuals and within 24 hours two of the individuals came back with testimonies Lord even this week Lord you could speak to the different ones and God is answering he's moving there's things happening within our lives Lord and we want to see more of it Lord Jesus even today hearing from brother Ron Spencer and brother Andrew his son them thanking the church for their prayers Lord others are going through valleys and times of decision we pray that you would bless the bride globally and locally Lord that we would have strength and have faith put words within our mouths what we should be praying for and asking you for and what put it within our thoughts Lord what to do in certain situations that are so delicate that seem so on the edge as it was and many times we wonder is that the Holy Spirit or is that our own thoughts or is that another influence in our lives Lord may you come this week clear-cut and give men and women the answers and speak Lord Jesus through our lips we heard this morning that we are the body of Jesus Christ we are temples and dwelling places so Lord would you manifest it literally this week encourage us as we Emily submit to one another into your word that we be more sensitive to one another into the needs Lord that we would just be quiet when we need to be quiet and speak when we need to speak and may there be a great anointing of faith within our lives lord we pray go with us now we thank you Lord for this generation that you've called us to be faithful in in Jesus name we are the generation [Music] retrieve it the Holy Spirit will make it right in your heart today what we need to do and where we need to go for this week if the Lord would give us some hours or days to be in this perfect wheel god bless you you're dismissed you can shake hands and let's be in prayer for one another this week god bless you [Music]
