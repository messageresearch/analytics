Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to ask our brother Eric Funk, brother, brother Eric, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. It's a testimony this morning from our sister Sigret who says, uh, "Praise and glory be to our God for answering prayer. 16 months ago, we prayed for my sister Margot in Germany who had been diagnosed with can cancer. She felt our prayers and believed that God would heal her. After an operation, many treatments, she is back to work as a nurse." Um, a note from brother Mike and sister Debbie Gier. Sister Dorothy Snder is requesting prayer. She needs to undergo a colonoscopy. Both her and her uh husband, brother Don, are going to be streaming this morning's service. Wish to thank you for your support and prayers. So, we want to remember sister Dorothy this morning. Uh there's a note that we pray uh for I think this is yeah sister Sue uh says we pray for my daughter-in-law Claudia uh that the medical test would come out negative. We just want to praise the Lord for her good health. And also brother Andrew said that my wife's friend's wife was just diagnosed with cancer. They're streaming the service this morning and know we will be in prayer for her healing. How many know we have a God? &gt;&gt; He's touched by the feelings of our infirmities. We've seen him heal many times. We know he's able. Amen. If you're listening in on the internet this morning, you've got a need. You just lift before the Lord as you go to prayer. Brother Eric, come. [Music] Let's just bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Precious Lord Jesus. Father, I just think how fitting it is, Lord, that the the storm is just raging outside today, Lord God, this morning, Lord, the wind and the rain and Lord, that are just uh happening in a physical way, Lord God, outside these doors today, Lord. And I just think of the type of how these storms that are just uh happening in this world today, Lord God. The storms, the spiritual storms, Lord God, that are happening, Lord. Father, I just think of this wonderful place of refuge that we have here, Lord God. Father, where would we be, Lord God, if we didn't have this place to come to, Lord God, to just let off the pressure, Lord God? The pressure of the cares of this world, Lord God. The pressure of Satan's attacks on his people, Lord God. Father, we just thank you that we have a a maker, Lord God, that knows our every need, Lord. We just thank you that we have a refuge to come to, Lord God, in you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we just thank you that we can bring every need to you, Lord God. We thank you that we can bring our cares of this world before you, Lord God. What a privilege it is, Lord God, to be your people, Lord God. Lord, we just love you so much, Lord God. Lord, we just thank you for the wonderful testimonies that you've given here today, Lord God. These these needs that in the past that have been prayed for, Lord God. these needs that you've brought an answer to, Lord God. Lord, we know that if we bring these needs to you, Lord Jesus, that you are a God of answered prayer, Lord Jesus. You're not a dead God. You're a living God that lives within us, Lord Jesus, here this morning, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, these needs that are brought here now, Lord, these saints that have brought them before you, Lord God. They're they're real needs, Lord God. They're real, Lord God. And they're things that are are dear to the hearts, Lord God. and we just bring them to you now, Lord Jesus. We just pray that you just meet every need, Lord, that's been asked, Lord God. Increase the faith of the saints that have pinned them down, Lord God, and just grant them the desires of their heart now, Lord God. We love you, Lord God. And Lord, as we pray for the the service this morning, Lord God, we just pray for your servant, Lord God. What a privilege it is to have a pastor, Lord God, that desires to serve you, Lord God, and to bring the word, Lord. We just pray for him, Lord God, this morning that you would just bring through speak the word through him, Lord God. Take the man out of the way, Lord God, and just let your Holy Spirit minister unto him, Lord God, and minister to the needs of the saints here this morning, Lord God. We thank you, Lord. We thank you for this place of refuge, Lord God. Help us to yield unto your Holy Spirit this morning, Lord God. We love you so much and we praise you and thank you now for what you've done in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] And you may be seated. [Music] Amen. We just want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning. We're happy to have uh each and every one of you here. And if you're listening in on the internet, we uh want to welcome you as well. You know, we have uh a lot of people that we can't see who are listening in on the internet and we're just happy to have you here with us this morning. Um Sister Brianna and Sister Elizabeth Neighbor have a song for us. Sister Elizabeth, why Sister Brianna, why don't you come? And as they're coming, let's sing together. I just want to please the Lord, be in his will. Is that your desire this morning? I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. to hear him say, "Well done someday." Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. to be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. To hear him say, "Well done someday. [Music] It's fine. [Music] Jesus, the very thought of thee, with sweetness fills the breast, but sweeter for thy face to see, and in thy presence rest. No voice can sing, no heart can frame, nor can the memory find a sweeter sound than thy blessed name. Oh savior of mankind, oh hope of every contrite heart. Oh joy of all the meek. To those who fall, how kind thou art. How good to those who seek. But what to those who find all this? No tongue nor pen can show the love of Jesus what it is. None but his love ones know. And once thou visit us the heart, then truth begins to shine. Then earthly vanities depart, then kindles love divine. Oh Jesus, light of all below. Thou f of livinging fire, surpassing all the joys we know and all we can desire. Oh Jesus, King most wonderful, [Music] now conqueror reowned, thou sweetness most ineable, in whom all joys are found. Jesus, may our voices bless thee. May we love alone. And ever in our lives express the image of thine own. Abide with us and let thy light shine Lord on every heart. Dispel the darkness of the night and joy to all inart. [Music] Thank you, sisters. Amen. Those words were pinned a long time ago. And we're going to hear some words that were penned even longer. Amen. As our we hear from the scripture this morning, ancient words long preserved. Let's uh sing number 995 as brother Biscll comes to bring the word this morning. Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. Words long preserved for our walk in this world. They resound with God's heart. Oh, let the word of God. Words of life, words of hope. Give us stren in this world where we are. The word of God will guide us. Word of God changing me and changing you. We have come with all heart for the word of God. Holy words our faith handed down to this age came to us who sacrifice for he the faithful words of right holy word of his word for I walk in this Earth. They reel in with God. For the word of God is word of God. True. It's changing me. Changing you, Lord. We have the faithful eyes for the word of God. for the word of God. Changing me, changing you, Lord, we have the word of God. Lord of God changing me. We have [Music] the word of God of God. changing me and changing you. We have come with the word of God in &gt;&gt; we say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Glad to see you here. God bless you coming on this lovely day. Thank God for the nice weather. &gt;&gt; It's always nice weather. &gt;&gt; I've always been amused how every area blames another area for their weather. You go down south and they have the tornadoes and they said it comes up from Mexico. Then you get into the states. I've been there and being a listen to the news and they say an arctic blast from Canada. And then we in Canada say it's an Arctic blast from Alaska. And I think they blame it on Siberia. I'm not too sure, but somebody always gets blamed for the weather. And we call this a pineapple express. They say from Hawaii. I don't know. Anyway, we thank God for the day &gt;&gt; and that we're here with heavenly sunshine &gt;&gt; in our hearts. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Nice to see you all here. And also, we want to be mindful while you are, you know, interacting with one another. There's a a big congregation that's not present visibly, but with us streaming live now on the internet. And last Sunday there was a 150 locations in 24 different nations around the world that joined in the service with you. And in the one week, I have never looked at the statistics because I didn't quite frankly didn't concern myself with it. But in the one week from last Sunday to last night, there was a 364 locations that had streamed the archive because it's not suitable for them to hear it while the service is on. So they got it maybe because it would be the middle of the night so they get it in the morning. But I thought that's quite a congregation. 364 locations that streamed after in the archived and probably 150 or thereabouts with us today. So I want to say to all of them, God bless them from whatever country and wherever it is in the world, God bless you is our prayer. I'd like to just remind you quickly and we're going to turn to the scripture, but this Wednesday there'll be no service because the service is Friday. This coming weekend is the uh US Thanksgiving and we have such a uh such a portion and percentage of our congregation that are on the US side. We truly feel like a wonderful international family with over 30 uh 30 different nationalities within the congregation and we are so happy for that. It makes it a very unique assembly. I think it gives it such a it blends us into uh what the bride of Jesus Christ is supposed to be like and uh such wonderful unity, such a wonderful spirit and there's just no feeling between one ethnic group to another. I just say that's wonderful. Hallelujah. It's just the way it should be. So this next weekend will be Friday evening with brother Tim Puit from uh from Louisiana be speaking. Brother Tim Puit is a a wonderful man of God been preaching since his teenage years has he's been given over to the Lord's work. He and his wife will be here. And then on Sunday we'll have 10:30 and 5:00 service next Sunday as well. And tonight, Brother Tom Ray is ministering. Brother Tom was just down in Texas with with Brother Aaron McGary's father, Brother David McGary, who's been pastoring in Fort Worth, Dallas area for many years. And I understand they had an outstanding time. And brother and sister Puit were actually over there to the meetings as well. And uh just a lot of the people from Louisiana and around. And so we might hear a little more of it tonight. I don't know. But brother Tom will have something on his heart for us tonight. We're going to go directly to the word. And if you'd like to turn in your Bibles, please second Corinthians the 7th chapter. We're going to begin reading. And then I will read also of Romans 8 and35 which was a portion of last Sunday's text and also I wish to read Revelations 6:es 1-4. Before we read, let's ask the author to be present and take control of my mouth and words and lips and take control of your mind and your entire our entire beings. Almighty God, you're the author of light and life. You have sent forth Jesus Christ which was the word in flesh into our lives and into this earth and you came to be a redeemer and you have succeeded in doing so. You are the victorious conquering Christ and today we have victory because of you. I pray you will anoint us with the Holy Spirit. anoint every man, woman, and child and all those that may be in various parts of the world. I pray your blessing upon them. I pray, oh God, your presence will be near and felt near every person. And now I pray, oh God, you'll take your word and give us understanding. Speak to our hearts and speak so deep, Lord, we can say that it has been good to be in the house of God. May we be strengthened, edified, and built up into this body of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 7 and verse 4. Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my glorying of you. I am filled with comfort. I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Without were fightings, within were fears. Nevertheless, God that comfortth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of Titus. Paul he made reference to without our fightings and within our fears. So he's experiencing as I uh mentioned last week that we are called to be conquerors more than conquerors and that which is external for my part that's conquering but if we conquer that and that which is inside the individual yourself we are our greatest o enemy. If we can conquer that as well, that's being more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and:35, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress, you see, he's re making reference to these things again, or persecution or famine, or nakedness or peril or sword. As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. Let us read the 37th verse in unison together. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. in Revelation 6 and verse one. It may on the surface seem difficult for you to tie these together, but that's why I'm here by God's help to try to bring something to you that will be relevant to our time, the opening of the seals. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard as it were, the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts, saying, "Come and see." And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. But there was a people he couldn't conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, "Come and see." He's saying that to John the Apostle. And there went out another horse that was red. And power was given unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given unto him a great sword. God bless you. You have your seats. I will need your undivided attention. And I trust you will be that keenly interested this morning and hungry for spiritual things. They that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Amen. The conditions that Apostle Paul speaks of and describes were due to two opposing forces. One which was the spirit of God in him and the other which was the spirit of the world. I will call it the spirit of antichrist. Now a lot of people as soon as they hear antichrist they think of some uh monster of some sort of thing. No, antirist is simply anti-word or we could say it's something that's unscriptural &gt;&gt; and that's everybody's understanding. You understand something that's unscriptural. Then if it's something that is unscriptural that is put forward and taught and then instructed uh then then it can become a doctrine. And we're going to brother Brandham in the opening of the seals. I think you'll find this really marvelous this morning as you take control of your thoughts and your mind and say just say now God give me understanding give me divine understanding because as apostle Paul he was he he's relating to these he said without our fightings and within our fears that's because he experiencing opposition and what he what caus caused opposition for him is still riding today. &gt;&gt; Nothing has changed. This rider which began on a white horse and then you'll find he gets on a red horse and then on a black horse and then on a pale horse. It is the same writer writing through we we can say not only history but writing through the present time using whatever he has access to to better achieve his ends and his ends are to oppose all that is righteous to oppose the spirit of God and the work of God. That is his objective. And so as times change, Satan has used whatever he could have gain access to to uh more I would say to more to equip himself more uh efficiently to achieve his ends. And so that is what I want to uh try and by God's help to bring to you. Apostle Paul. Now you may uh question that but for mo you that know the scripture you will uh you will be able to relate to this scripture right away because the apostle John wrote and he was the one on the that would be later seeing the on the aisle of Patmas. He would see the entire revelation of the of the future. And he said these words, "And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ, notice, is come in the flesh, not that he will come in the flesh, but that he is come in the flesh, is not of God." And this is that spirit of Antichrist. That's how he could identify it. Wherefore you have heard, he's speaking to the ones he would relate to as call little children. You have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world that it has come. So he was telling them perhaps they weren't fully aware that it had come. He said you have heard that it will come but I'm telling you that it has come already the spirit of antichrist which was in the world. &gt;&gt; And so he was well acquainted that it had already already appeared. Now, Apostle John, I want to just set the scene now. Apostle John, he saw this spirit of Antichrist as a horse rider changing his mounts at specific times from the white to the red to the black to the pale. So, and riding straight off into eternity. I won't say eternity, but into his final destruction. And he's writing a power, or we could say a method. He's using a method. He's using a tactic which will better further his ends at certain times. So, he starts out as a white horse, which the prophet declares was deception. It was so close right in that early church. It was so close. It was he rode out on a white horse and that gave him his foothold. &gt;&gt; And then he found that there was a he needed a a uh he needed something further that would further his end. And he comes to mounting a red horse which was the age of the martyrs. History records 68 million perished in the martyrdom. But as I closed last Sunday's service saying some are waiting for some great holocaust, some great nuclear uh catastrophic event on the face of the earth. And believe me, it's not something that's in the dream world. It's already under the it's in our silos. It's in the submarines. This isn't something we have to imagine. This is something that's present with us. &gt;&gt; Both the United States and Russia, as far as that goes, both of them have enough nuclear power destruction in their in in their resource right now to destroy the entire earth. &gt;&gt; Both of them individually have. I listened to uh a senior officer from the Pentagon and he was arguing against further missiles. He was arguing against it and he went into specifics of the power that has that is they have now he said we have enough power in the United States to knock the earth off its axis. sufficient power to man could destroy the entire earth if it was unleashed. And so these things are not something we're not here to try to be, you know, uh to startle you, but yet it is reality. I'm not one either to, you know, let's veil things and let's put our head in the sand. Let's pre pretend it's not here, especially if the scripture speaks about it. &gt;&gt; Good. And then so we we say well on the red horse power we'll be going into it in a lot more detail the 68 million were martyed but I would like to suggest to you and furthermore I would make the statement to you that there are many more today we have the walking dead. Today we have men and women and young people that are burning in their lust and in their desire seeking fulfillment and can't find it. &gt;&gt; We have all kinds of things and we you can find it in the materialistic world and you can find it in the in the world that is filled with want and fightings and warings that going on over the entire face of the earth. If you were God looking down on it, you'd say this is a sad situation. &gt;&gt; If you could look in all of these the nations around the world and see what is taking place and it's too terrible to discuss or talk about over the pullpit just what's going through my mind now and I'm not a great student of of n of of the news, but I do stay ab breast of things simply because it's been prophesied. But when you see children being used and abused the way they are around the world and some countries allow children just children to be captured and used for prostitution. I think it's terrible. Then you come to another part of the world and you'll find the government knows that there or their own citizens are being starved to death. not a not a not a hundred, not a thousand, but hundreds of thousands. And they will maintain their political position and allow their own citizens. And yet there's institutions and all kinds of uh uh societies which would run to help. You know, there was a part of the world, it was actually in northern Africa and Canada got into the act and said, "We'll send wheat. That's one thing we can send. We can send wheat." And they sent over hundreds and hundreds of thousands of bushels and train loads of wheat and just felt so good about being able to give this massive amount of wheat. They said there was 2 million people starving in the Sudan and the wheat went over there and our reporter, one of our reporters from the Vancouver Sun newspaper flew over to see how it was being distri how how the distribution was going and the distribution was going nowhere because they had no infrastructure to send the wheat to the starving people. And he said, "The only things that are getting fed by our wheat are the seagulls." And the piles of wheat were staying where they offloaded from the ships in huge piles at the docks. See, it's not that people don't want to do things. It is the system that is that is controlling the world is does not tend towards life. It tends towards death. &gt;&gt; It tends towards the base character of man, unconverted man. And then there from the red horse he mounted a black horse which was down through the dark ages and then a pale horse and only when the rider comes on a pale horse is he named and the Bible names them as death. The challenge that I have today is to try to bring these things which are in symbolic terms and language to bring it and and to cover this bridge this gap between uh when it was seen and how it was written to the time that we are in and bring it into language that you and I use and that we understand. But let it be known to you that this is not some kind of mystical uh you know foggy uh wording and language that God put it in such a way so that we couldn't understand it. No, he put it in such a way so that you who are born again and believe that you have received the spirit of God, I want you to know and alert you today. You have access. You are to expect to understand what you have need of in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, even the spirit of antichrist cannot conquer the believer. And there is one that is writing in this time and his purpose is to conquer. He's tireless, changing his methods. He is a slicker, deceitful, using every possible means to achieve his end. But I want to say to you from the message, the end time conditions, although they are at work and they're present with us today, we have an end time message that will meet the end time conditions. Amen. The world around us as you and I experience it daily has been designed by Satan who the Bible calls and I will give you the Bible's description the prince of the power of the air in Ephesians 2 and2 he is called Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. He's called an angel of light. In 2 Corinthians 4 and4, perhaps the most powerful, the God of this world, small G, the God of this world. What is the Apostle Paul saying? He's saying this being, this angel of light is actually worshiped by the people of the earth. And the apostle John under the divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit said, "All whose names are not found in the book of life will worship him." &gt;&gt; Will bow down and worship him. Oh, it doesn't mean necessarily that you'll get on your knees and and and and go before some statue or some image, but it is it is however he uh presents himself. He may present himself in some system or in some order or some uh some worship or some doctrine and he brings people in subjection and in obesence to that and he has them bowing and they don't realize it. And Paul said in in uh uh Thessalonians that that that Satan himself will set himself up in the temple of God so that he will be worshiped as God. Listen, this has been his objective from day one. &gt;&gt; This is why he was thrown out of heaven. That's why the great war that took place there. The God of this evil age, I want to just bring it down here. I'm going to bridge the gap just now. The God of this evil age has designed the world that you're in contact and you rub shoulders with every day. And I can tell you that this slicker, he is not he he he he's not uh he he he's not intimidated. He's come to your school, young people. He's come to your colleges and places of higher education. He's come to your home. Not afraid of your the walls of your house. &gt;&gt; He's come to your place of work. &gt;&gt; He's come into the financial community to organize things to set it up to shut out God and squeeze God out of the life. He's brought all kinds of conditions and circumstances that press upon you. I'm talking about this day. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about what color he is writing now. He's writing to be the most effective that he can to captivate the minds of the people. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether we say, "Oh, well, it's a little uh uh, you know, a little video game or it's a little this or it's a little that." I tell you what, he doesn't care what. He'll use every kind of possible means, whether it be the man's business or the woman's shopping or the fashion industry or the school or the education or the higher education. And not last, not last and not least, the church. &gt;&gt; He thinks that's a that's a heyday for him &gt;&gt; to get into the church because out there's just the circumstances of external circumstances. But what he wants to do is capture the minds. He wants to gain that loyalty. You see, some nations are very, very, so let's say they're very gallant, very patriotic. And I'll be perfectly honest. Uh, America, the United States is a very patriotic nation. And I I admire that. Canada, we don't seem to have much to be patriotic about. I don't know why, but we just haven't got the same attitude. Our flag doesn't seem to mean what, you know, what uh the stars and stripes means. And these are just these are realities. This this is the truth. And uh and but but America, as patriotic as the people are, the government's not able to hold everybody, &gt;&gt; not able to capture everybody. There's people that are against it, you know, or they're for the government or against the government. Every nation has the same thing. But when you start coming into the realm of religion and you get a teaching and a doctrine and you get a spirit that's promoting it and people's minds there they willingly give themselves or maybe are born and raised up into it and they are they are in a certain religion and a certain faith. Satan knows that that he can capture and gain control of the mind and the soul of the individual, the heart and get a commitment he can never get through the government. &gt;&gt; So now this is this is kind of setting the stage. Now in this day we have uh the age of superpowers. We have the power of we could say military power, the power of wealth, the power of I looked up some of these. The power of feminism, the feminist feminism movement, the power of wealth, the power of all of these various things. The power of popularity, but we have the power of the revealed word. &gt;&gt; And that happens to be a very, very powerful element that we have access to. And here I'll just bring and conclude this little part here. The end time messenger and message should meet the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; And he asked the question, don't you think so? &gt;&gt; And I say yes, I do think so. &gt;&gt; The end time message should meet the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; All right. says, "We are here. Here we are. End time. Red light down, flashing. The coming of the Lord is at hand. The end time message should meet the end time conditions. And where they've got off, the message ought to bring it back." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where people have got off track, the message ought to bring it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the Bible clearly states and clearly describes how Satan will use the power of religion. I want you to listen real real close. And all that dwell upon the earth, Revelation 13:8, shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, because you may be here and there may be many that are listening and they may wonder, well, uh, how's the world going to, you know, worship this god of this evil age? How's that actually going to happen? Jesus said to the woman at the well, she was a Samaritan and her question was actually a spiritual question when he began to get down to that realm of her spirit. said, "Go and get your husband." Said, "I have no husband." She started by saying, "The Samaritans say we should worship in this mountain, and the Jews say we should worship in Jerusalem." And she was confused concerning worship. And Jesus responded with this statement. You Samaritans, you worship. You don't know what. Just think about that statement. So, he was saying, he wasn't saying you don't worship. He's saying you don't know what you worship. &gt;&gt; And that happens to be a a true statement for today. &gt;&gt; That's just as that's just as real today and applicable today. People worship, but they don't know what they worship. &gt;&gt; It's not that they don't worship. And you worship you know not what. He said, "We know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews." Jesus also said to people who are worshiped and in fact spent their life worshshiping. And he said to the scribes and Pharisees, "But in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines and commandments of men." And I can guarantee you that the people he was speaking to when he said that said, "Worship you, &gt;&gt; worship you," they considered him their enemy. They considered him a false teacher. &gt;&gt; But he's saying in vain do you worship me. They didn't have any idea that that's what was taking place. People do not know what worship is number one and do not know who they are actually bowing down to and worshiping. Now, last week I just mentioned and the scripture refers to in 2 Thessalonians and brother Brandham makes a lot of reference to it that he who letth will now let until he be taken out of the way. And here's the scripture for the mystery of iniquity doth already work. See, it wasn't something that was just going to be in the future. It wasn't something that was passed. Paul was saying it would already work. Only he that now letth. And the prophet states to us that he who leth is none other than the Holy Spirit. He who leth until he be taken out of the way until he's allowing things until he be taken out of the way. And then when he's taken out of the way, then shall the wicked be revealed. That is when when the Holy Spirit who is presently a restraining force in the earth when he is taken out of the way and when he's taken out of the way the believer is taken out also taken out of the way into a change of the body into a rapture of the church. He said we shall be caught up. We shall not all we shall we shall not all sleep. Apostle Paul says, "For the dead in Christ shall rise first." Period. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; That's the process. But the Bible says, and Paul is saying to the Thessalonians, when he who now letth, when he's taken out of the way, then the wicked, the wicked will shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord himself shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. There is a conclusion to this conflict. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham asked, "Do you get it?" He said, "Now Paul's speaking the time when the seal of God is being made known, his spirit, his name, his grace." I'll ask you, has his name been made known to you? &gt;&gt; Has his grace been made known to you? and all these other great mysteries that's been going forth. Now, plans for his church to go in the rapture, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit has done this. And that's what he done in the last days. That's what he has he has accomplished in the last days. Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the scripture refers as it was in the days of Lot. Brother Brenham asks, "Oh, think people Oh, think people could go right on preaching, thinking they're getting saved." I want you to listen very close. When the church is gone, and I'll prove this to you in just a moment. When the church is gone, do you know that there people say, "Oh, it's just a mass exodus of people and dirt flying up and the gravestones." And there's no such thing in the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's a secret. It's a secret catching away of the church. There are literally hundreds, hundreds, if not thousands missing in America, North America, in one day. and they know nothing about it. They don't even know where they are. The missing file is is they don't even try to find them. You may question that. That's the That's the truth. &gt;&gt; People are missing every day. Hundreds go missing every day. And they don't know. I'm not saying that's the rapture, but it'll be like the rapture. The Jews when Jesus Christ was there on earth and the Jews saw him, the Jews even participated in some of the great miracles in eating the loaves and the fishes and drinking the water that was turned into wine and all of those things that were taking place. They participated in that and they were living when Jesus Christ himself was received up into heaven. Do you think they believed it afterwards? Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Did they go to the synagogue the next week? Absolutely. Did they have the Passover the following year? You want to believe they did. &gt;&gt; Did they keep the word? Absolutely. Did they worship? Absolutely. But he had come and gone. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that as he came, that's the way it'll be again. people will go on and no doubt this building will be standing when the raptured saints have left. I don't know who will be here but by God's grace I don't plan to be behind this pull pit and I certainly don't plan to be looking down into your face and I trust you aren't here to take in a service because it it'll go on. &gt;&gt; There'll be somebody to take the service. There'll be somebody and the prophet said they'll go on preaching and thinking that people are getting saved. There'll be people, people won't stop shedding tears. People won't stop being disappointed. People won't stop having an emotional upheaval. People won't stop being convicted that they've done something wrong. But it won't be the Holy Spirit that's drawing them. &gt;&gt; They'll just aware. And Jesus even, and I closed last week, Jesus even spoke of the rich man, the young man that went went into hell itself. He didn't lose his consciousness. He didn't lose his senses. He didn't lose his balance of understanding. He still remembered he had five brethren. He knew they weren't believers. And suddenly, he knew what the answer was. &gt;&gt; Let Lazarus go back. He wanted to preach to them. &gt;&gt; He wanted to tell them, "Make sure they don't come here." &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends, that death doesn't end at all. &gt;&gt; God has been dealing with me in the last week, and I want to preach a message to you on the finality of death. &gt;&gt; But there are some things that are not final. &gt;&gt; There are some things not concluded at death. It'll be just a you will go from the element of of the mortal to the element of the immortal &gt;&gt; or to another realm. And to those that are lost, it's not an immortal state in that sense of the word. I won't bother getting into it. And so he says they'll go on preaching thinking they're getting saved, believing they're doing right, and believing their organization are growing and not even a ray of hope. Try to convince try to convince those that are in Israel that Jesus Christ had actually come. The Holy Spirit will have lifted from off the earth. Jesus said, "But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; whom the Father will send in my name." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's also spoken that he that was sent will also leave. &gt;&gt; Right. Good. There'll be as there was a commencement of the age of grace, &gt;&gt; there is a conclusion to the age of grace. He that leth will be taken out of the way as we near the end time. And you'll allow me please to be a little bit slow and deliberate this morning because I want to be very specific with what I'm saying. The conditions as we near this this end time, you and I happen to be children of a time such as there's never been on the face of the earth quite like this. All the seeds of Genesis have come to a harvest time. All the seeds that were sown, deception sown in Gen in Genesis, but it has come to its full bloom today. All of these things that were sown, now we are the people that are in the harvest time in end time. And the end time conditions will mature. These conditions have matured to a place. I don't want to be pessimist but I because I'm a very very much an optimist but I say out of the depths of my heart and I believe that I can prove this to you. We are literally moving into a judgment &gt;&gt; as I had on the screen. I'm not going to I have some other slides for you today but the Institute of Mental Health of the United States I was so affected by that declaring from the age of 18 and over one of every four Americans have a diagnosible mental illness. And that does not take into consideration those that have not been diagnosed with a mental illness. They said the total of America, this is from from their own National Institute of Health, you can look it up on the web if you wish, 57.7 million Americans. Now, just multiply that by what we have in Canada if you want to use the same percentages. And I'm sure that you couldn't. it it would be identical. But 57.7 million almost double the population of this entire country mental mental illness that have been diagnosed as mentally ill from 18 and over. And I can tell you young people there's a lot of them 18 and under. Right. &gt;&gt; I've been I've been to the psychiatric ward in our hospitals more than once and saw young people there. I know of a young fellow that was in his mid- teens that was enticed to take drugs once and it turned him into a total vegetable right here in this city. Just once but he vegetable for the rest of his life. I've been to the mental institute the actually the insane institute and have seen and been amongst the people there and went there specifically to visit one young man who we brought out and had for five weeks and the only thing he wouldn't respond to was we can pray and cast those demons out of you and you will be free and he wasn't prepared for that but he did want all the help that he could get. And when uh I received a call from the psychiatrist, from the doctor and went back into the mental institute with him and the three of us were sitting there and uh and the doctor now began to question me, asked me, "Do you believe in demon possession?" I said, "As the Bible refers to it, yes." He said, "Do you believe in exorcism?" I knew what it meant, but I said, "What does that mean?" I want him to say it. He said, "It means it is the practice of casting out demons." I said, "As Jesus taught it." Yes. And then he was having trouble framing some more questions. And so I thought I would just ease up. I said, "Listen, doctor," I said, "Uh, we believe what the scripture teaches." But I said, "What we really believe is that most all mental sickness is first a spiritual illness." And he just let down his garden smile. He says, he says, "I would agree with that. I would agree with that. It's first a spiritual illness, then became a mental illness." And he told me, he said, "It's remarkable what's happened to this young man in the five weeks you've had him. It's remarkable because he had been so just the atmosphere and being in the meetings and hearing truth, it had such an effect on him and he stopped taking his medication and all the rest of it. But he didn't want to be totally free. He didn't want to be prayed for and have the demons cast out of him. It's a reality, friends. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't weary me saying that, but it's the real world that we're in. I'm going to show you uh two or three slides and just move through this as quickly as I can. Hereby know ye the spirit of God, even the spirit that confessth that Jesus is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confessth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world. In the first church age, the antichrist spirit is right. We go right to the church age of Ephesus. The antichrist or anti-word spirit appeared in the form of a deed. I want you to notice this very closely. First a deed. Revelation 2 and6. But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. From deeds to doctrine. And the deeds of the nickelans became a doctrine after the Nyian council. They formed their own faith. put up their own men. Nicl means conquer. Nicicoatans means to conquer the leoty or put all the holiness in a man. Now what is happening here is I want to take this portion where he gets off his white horse into onto his red horse because on the white horse the rider he was using deception and the scripture says he had a bow arrows had a bow but no arrows. So his his power or his ability to achieve his end was limited. And it says and it was and there was given him a crown. He didn't have a crown but he was crowned. And now the prophet brings it to us. You cannot crown a spirit. And so now you have a group of people and he said I hope it's we have it here now. The church that was at Pentecost, the early church, it was quite a large church at the beginning, but they started a denominational spirit coming among them trying to denominate the church which was called the deeds of the nickelans. See, just some deeds, some things were taking place within the church that were uh and the deeds were that there were men that raised up and brother Brandham refers to them as Paul's wolves. Paul the apostle said in Acts, I believe the uh I'll refer to it a little later on. I have the scripture reference here. And he refers to him. He says, "I know that after my departure, grievous wolves will come in." &gt;&gt; And this is what he was striving to warn them about. Grievous wolves will come in and and it was an antichrist spirit or anti-word spirit, something that was unscriptural and just it began to be a a deed amongst the people. And then the these men that had risen up as leaders, it was necessary that these deeds then became a doctrine. You understand? Then the doctrine needed to be teached. And so that required a group of men to rise up and they became uh the teachers of the doctrine of the deed. And that is how he was evolving or changing his power because as a just as a deception bringing amongst the people that uh well even back in Paul's time and there was problem they wanted to continue with circumcision as well they wanted to do various things for example now now I'll just bring it to our time listen closely you know sometime we go to some parts of the world and it is it's absolutely essential that the woman wear a covering on her head. She must wear a covering on her head. So we were in a we were in Russia and they wanted my wife to sing and so uh she was prepared to sing and in the morning they asked her and we noticed all the ladies wear a covering over their head. Well, and even in uh I was born into a Catholic church in a Catholic faith and my father was an altar boy in a Catholic church before he was converted and the women wouldn't think of not wearing a hat because uh that was an essential part. Now that's a deed but the deed then becomes a doctrine. &gt;&gt; And then to the doctrine there's attached a spirituality to it. See now you sisters dress in a certain way. And I can tell you that there's no spirituality to a long dress. &gt;&gt; It's not the dress that's spiritual. It's what God has done in the heart of an individual. And no, I do not want to expose my body in a certain way to cause to cause men say to lust after it. And so I do this because we've had a vindicated voice, a vindicated message that has instructed us how we should live and how we should dress and how we should conduct ourselves. But now, so my wife in the morning, she said, "Yes, we'll sing." In the evening when we came, a man was standing at the door and gave her a covering for her head. And God spoke to my wife's heart. She must not do that because then the people will feel that there's some spirituality associated with this piece of cloth. And there's no spirituality attached to that piece of cloth. And so she she didn't refuse it. She just said no thank you. And they said no thank you. So she didn't put it on and they didn't have her sing. That's how important that was. Now so it becomes a a deed and then it became a doctrine. In Paul's time they wanted to continue circumcision. So fine circumcision is fine but there was no spirituality attached to it. &gt;&gt; And so they had conflict in the early church whether they wanted to circumcise a son or not. circumcise a son. That's up to the family. But one thing for sure, they wanted to bring it as a deed and continue it in the church as a spiritual doctrine. And Paul said, "No." &gt;&gt; We are circumcised in the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they possibly want to carry on certain holy days. And Paul said, "No, there is no certain holy days." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. We've been freed from that. &gt;&gt; See, and the law has been uh completed in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And so now, but this writer, I want you to please get this because now I'll carry on with some quotes in a moment. So now he he needs more a more effective way. Satan, don't forget Satan, he's not just he's not wanting to just uh control the external parts of a person's environment, but he wants to dominate from the inside because he knows that's where control is. And so now here this this power has a has a bow, no arrows, and he's moving moving now to take a more uh shall I say a a a position of more authority. And so what he does is now watch very close. He needs to unite you see as a church and just as a doctrine. And brother Brandham said, "A doctrine is innocent can't slay anybody." A doctrine, a simple innocent doctrine can't slay anybody. But the doctrine required a priesthood to teach the doctrine. And then the priesthood became a structured entity. It had bishops and then needed overseers and bishops and cardinals. And finally 300 years later uh had a pope &gt;&gt; and now they had a structure. And then in order to complete this transition from the white horse to the red horse then the structure that was the church structure. Then it became married to the state. And so now state and church because the church could not did not have sufficient authority to resist those that were heretics and that were opposing them and actually put them to death. That's what the red horse is all about. And the martyology there was they throw some in prison and kill some in the time of the book of the acts. But now as the church grew and as they took and set up this hierarchy, those that were born of the Holy Spirit, we're not going to bow to that. &gt;&gt; They would not bow to that. And so they had to unite the church and the state together. And then when the church had a statehood, then they could authorize this is an enemy and we need to destroy them. And thus the age of the martyology came. I'm going to say some things that maybe you may agree with and I don't care whether you do or not, but I I'm I I I feel sufficiently confident to say them. You know, we're here uh a very diverse congregation of people, but you know, it's something that I've thought of quite a bit. It's amazing how a government, the state can begin because they've got control of the media and they can begin to feed people the information slanted the way they want to slant it &gt;&gt; until you build up almost a feeling of animosity against another ethnic group. &gt;&gt; And then the state can tell you these people are dangerous. &gt;&gt; These people want to kill you, &gt;&gt; right? We need to arm ourselves. We need to defend ourselves. We need to go over there and drop our bombs and take our artillery and do whatever. And one nation will rise up against another nation because they're able to succeed in controlling the minds of the people. And because they're a state, if you went out and killed somebody, you're a murderer. &gt;&gt; But if the state tells you to do it, you're a hero. &gt;&gt; Now, folks, Something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Something's wrong. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, we need to be we need to be gallant and we need to be uh to defend our that's that I have no argument with that. That's not what I'm talking about. But this is what this is what the Antichrist spirit saw. We cannot we do not have the power or the authority on this white horse to slay our enemies. And so we must unite in a marriage the state and the church. And that's why the Vatican today is a state. &gt;&gt; And listen to me close now. And the state. And that is why that church is so intent on uniting itself with the various states of heads of state because this is a this this is the whole program and Satan has designed that office &gt;&gt; for a one world power control &gt;&gt; and you will bend to it if your name is not in the book. you will certainly come under its control and you will bend to it. &gt;&gt; So it was trying to denominate the church which was called the deeds of the nicicoatans and these deeds of the nickelatans. Now it wasn't a doctrine yet. When he first started he was just a little doctrine in amongst the people called the nickelonism. And now nickelanism friends is two words nickel control or conquer the leoty the people. &gt;&gt; We don't believe that here. &gt;&gt; We absolutely believe against that. We do not believe that this office controls the people. We believe that the people simply out of respect for the ministry. If the ministry has a ministry, then they're free to come. They're free to go. They're free to do whatever they wish to do. But if they say that feeds my soul, and I'm there of my own accord. I'm there because my soul is fed. That's where that's where that that's that's the criteria. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if it's not that, then you know, you got to find yourself a a place that you have confidence in. &gt;&gt; And so, of course, it wouldn't slay anything. A doctrine, you see, and that's Revelations 2 and 6. It's just a doctrine, just a spirit amongst the people. Oh, he was so innocent riding on the white horse. A doctrine would require that there be a priesthood to teach the doctrine. Just what I just went through. Paul's wolves had become nicicoatans. And that's the from the Ephesian church age. For I know that this after I know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. And that is Acts 20 and 29. And they were trying to form a priesthood like a Levitical priesthood which was foreign to the New Testament doctrine. The word nickel the Greek word nicl means to conquer or overcome. When when he starts off as a nickelia spirit in the church he's a spirit and you can't crown a spirit. Are you able to put some of these things together now? But 300 years later he became a pope and then they crowned him. Nickelan doctrine became a man and then they could crown it. Now we come down a lot of years later and some of you here in the church have seen uh some of this. This is Pope Paul II very very popular. I wonder if we can dim the lights please. Uh now we have pre President Clinton, President Bush Senior, President Bush Jr. and other dignitaries coming before the body of Pope Paul II. And here we have them kneeling before this form. I just want to ask you, you think Luther would be there? &gt;&gt; No, sir. You think some of these saints, you think Wesley would be there? &gt;&gt; These men represent tens of millions of Lutheran of Methodists of fundamental Christians. In fact, as they say, according to the Americans, they said that it was uh the fundamental Christians which actually got President Bush in. And you must know by the scripture. Understand this people. It's not me just speaking. I'm telling you according to the word of God. When the leaders of a nation did a certain act, God considered the whole nation under that. &gt;&gt; When these men and to bow and to kneel, you look at what worship is in the scripture. If you kneel before something, you are worshiping that either that system, you are regarding that office, you are giving obesence to it. And and they might be there. You might say, "Well, it's just for political reasons." Ah, &gt;&gt; it's exactly right. &gt;&gt; This writer wrote into politics. He controls politics and he puts pressure on good men to do something that they wouldn't normally do. And he didn't merely shift from one horse to another, but he's rode right down into the end time. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, friends. He's right where you live. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the only way, there's only one weapon &gt;&gt; that is successful against him, and that is God's revealed word. There is no other weapon. You You don't have enough reserve within yourself. You don't have another resource. You don't have You could join institutions to no end. You could join churches to no end. A church will never save you. God sends his word in every given age and defeats the Antichrist. He's anti-word and he's against this message. &gt;&gt; He's against this message. And I tell you, it's it's not the drunk on the street or the prostitute in the red light district that happen to be against it. It's religious leaders. It threatens them. It threatens their position. It threatens whatever they stand for. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for God's revealed word. Because of that, &gt;&gt; you can you have the option to be more than a conqueror. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God has given you that access &gt;&gt; to be more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; And listen to me, friends, as I come to a close. I'm I'm far from being done, but I'm going to close early. Satan is not interested in simply uh having control of your environment. We could talk about politics or about about economics or about all of these things and you might say yay yay yay amen. I agree with that. That's not his purpose. His purpose is to use those various external things so as to cause the individual and this is a this is a whole myriad of of avenues and channels that he uses and it's hard in a very limited period of time of a Sunday morning service but you have to just examine your own your own area your own realm of life. Examine it, friends. Look at it. And I can tell you this writer, this writer that is this cunning, he has never lost any of his deception. &gt;&gt; He has never lost hear it any of his cruelty. &gt;&gt; He has never lost any of the uh the blackness and the darkness that he want to stamp out the word during the dark ages. He's never lost that. And he's never lost being what he is, which is death. &gt;&gt; And in the last age, he's finally named. The rider is named death. A grizzled pale horse. I looked that up and it's really strange because the word that's used in the scripture actually refers to a blood disease. It's a a certain blood disease and I'll tell you the pale horse rider that is a that is a one thing that identifies and we have churches here in Canada that deny absolutely deny the blood of Jesus Christ. I say they are diseased people. Their system is diseased. They'll never come out of it. For it's by no other way than through the blood of Jesus Christ. And now remember the life the prophet said is in the blood &gt;&gt; and the soul is the nature of the life. You and I that by virtue of the new birth and by the baptism of the Holy Spirit became we become filled and possessed with the very life of Jesus Christ. As brother Brandham says, if you had the life of Beethoven, if he had the life of Beethoven in him, he said he'd write music. If he had the life of Michelangelo in him, he would do great works of art. If he had the life of someone else, he would do their their he would act out their life. And if we have the life of Jesus Christ in us, what will we do? The works of Jesus Christ will live the life of Jesus Christ. And the revealed word, it is empowered. It is ordained. It is sent on a mission to go into the soul of the redeemed. to go into the soul of the predestinated and change them from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Change the nature. &gt;&gt; Well, you might say, "I was born with that." I can tell you what, there's a second birth that's stronger than the first birth. &gt;&gt; I have a certain I have a certain uh uh heritage. I have a certain I came from a certain ethnic group. we are Irish or we are Ukrainian such as I am or we are German or we're British or we're whatever we are. I tell you we're born again &gt;&gt; and it's not just a mere uh uh phrase. &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. It's stronger. I want to announce to you, I don't care who you are, the message that I'm referring to. And the message that God has sent to us is more is stronger, more powerful than anything you were born with. And you need to accept that. You need to acknowledge that. Say, "Well, I was just born laxidasical." This will put something into you. &gt;&gt; I was born with I couldn't really stand up. I don't have any. This will put steel in your backbone. This will make you a witness. &gt;&gt; This word of God will take uh Peter who who cursed and denied the Lord, turned him into the man who stood up on the day of Pentecost and said, "Hear my words." It turned the Apostle Paul, a man that was violent against the message of the hour, and he was taking people to death into prison and stood with the clothes of the clothing of Steven, the first martyr, at his feet, and watched him being stoned. &gt;&gt; And he called himself a blasphemer. &gt;&gt; He called himself the greatest of sinners. And yet the grace of God was to him. He was ordained before the foundation of the world to write most of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; God used him. &gt;&gt; And even though he said he counted all that he knew as dong. Yeah. Nevertheless, God used that incredible intellect that he had, that incredible mental understanding of the Old Testament. And that's why he could read and write through the Hebrews and right through the other scriptures and just take a a certain quote out of Psalms and then one out of Genesis and then one out of Exodus. Just a line. How do they do that? &gt;&gt; By the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you may wonder how the prophet of God in this age can take just a scripture and and go and teach the rapture out of Psalms 27 because David was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write Psalms 27. In the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle, shall he hide me? Those words were inspired back then for you for this day. That's a rapture message. God's telling you through a prophet, you're going to change your residence. You're going to change where you live. You're going to change your body. &gt;&gt; What's going to change your body? There isn't anything down at Shoppers Drug or over at Hagens or any other place that can change your body. But the scripture, the word of God says, "We shall all be changed." &gt;&gt; And that's enough. And then God sends a messenger in the end times says, "Now the time has arrived. the forerunner of the second coming of Jesus Christ. Now the time's arrived. And furthermore, he's going to pull off the cover off the antichrist and show you where he came in, where he started, where he changed his horse, where he changed his power, changed his method, and he showed how he did it &gt;&gt; and took that bow that had no arrows. He couldn't slay anybody with it. He needed another power. And so he united. He married state to church. And now with the power of the state and the authority of the state, they could slay their enemies. And they did. &gt;&gt; 68 million. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, my dear friends, young and old alike, visitor alike, I can tell you that this rider, he's not quit his riding. &gt;&gt; He's not left riding. He's ridden right into your day. He's ridden right into your time. He's written right into your little area of involvement, whatever that might be. And he's out to take control of the soul of man. Somehow take control of it. &gt;&gt; This same scripture says, "Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us." &gt;&gt; And today I can say we have one who loved us, not hated us, but loved us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's given us I can say the bride of Jesus Christ is literally empowered. &gt;&gt; And I'm not here for my health. I'm not here because I I have a great thrill standing before a group of people. That's not why I stay in my study hour after hour and day after day and leave my my wife to live a lonely life, but to to obtain the truth of God's word as it's been delivered through a vindicated voice and bring it to the people. So you go out of here, you're equipped. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go out of here helpless or defenseless. &gt;&gt; You're equipped. You see things through different eyes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's been exposed. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's been uncovered. &gt;&gt; You see him all over. You see him everywhere in every every aspect of this civilization. You see him. But now we have different vision. We have different eyesight. We can identify him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why when you read the scripture, it seems like a puzzle, but it won't be a puzzle after you leave here today. Here he's riding white horse going out to conquer, conquering and to conquer. He's just got a bow. Hasn't even got a crown. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But the apostle John under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and says now and the second seal is opened. Here he comes. John, come and see. And he saw the rider and he's on a red horse. Now it's not a bow. It's a sword. Now something has happened in the real world and what happened was a hierarchy was structured to take control of the people. Nico conquer &gt;&gt; leoty the people. Oh, aren't you thankful or rejoicing today that you're not under some hierarchy? I tell you, those of you that have come out of denominationalism, we're not against denominationalism as such. We're against what it does to the people. &gt;&gt; I've had all kinds of people want to shake off the shackles of some controlling system. &gt;&gt; And I can speak about Catholicism because that's what we came out of. &gt;&gt; My father, he spent everything. He spent his inheritance, his entire inheritance to try to alert people and sent out tracks of converted nuns and converted priests. He spent out his his inheritance from his father. My grandfather, I never saw a penny of it. And I'm glad I never saw a penny of it. Let the tracks go out. Let the report go out. Let the testimony go out. &gt;&gt; How they were converted and how they were born again. I tell you what, friends, &gt;&gt; I have something to say. I have an experience that I've experienced. My mother and father are on the verge of divorce because my mother was so staunch in the faith. My daddy, he went upstairs into the attic in our little humble clapboard house. And for five weeks, he prayed till the we hours of the morning until one day my mother was gloriously saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What freed her from the shackles of that church? &gt;&gt; And many others are the same. What do they hold? They hold the minds of the people. And they've got a priesthood and a hierarchy that indoctrinates the people and captures their mind and their thinking. And they can't shake those shackles. &gt;&gt; But we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus who freed us and set us free. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I hesitate to mention things, but I can tell you just after brother Mike Hunt had met God in the basement of his mother and dad's home, who were not religious people, but he fell on his face. a man who had just been a garbage collector in the city of Vancouver, but Bibles begin to fall out of the garbage cans and he'd stuff them in his shirt and put them put them up on a on a mantle of the shelf when he got home and he saw a little tract one day and the little track just showed three stick men going up to Calvary where there was three crosses. He didn't know nothing. He was 26 years old, had never been in the church in his life. He saw these three little stick men on I'm sorry a little stick drawing of a man going with a huge packsack on a weight on his back up to with the three crosses on Calvary and on the other side the packsack had fallen off and was rolling rolling like that and he was running with his arms screaming thanksgiving and glory to God and he knows nothing. He just looked that little we simple drawing he says whatever happened to him is what I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. whatever happened to him, I need to meet that God." &gt;&gt; And I don't know how soon it was after that. And he fell on his face. He doesn't remember how long he was there. His eyes were swelled shut from weeping and repenting over his sin. And he cried out. He said, "Oh Jesus, I never knew you were down here." And three weeks later, the same one that ever spoke to him said, "You must go out now and find others like yourself." And he walked down the street and the first he saw a sign down there where the cross says, "Jesus saves." He thought, "That looks good." He walked down there, there was some special meetings taking place in a big Pentecostal church. And he opened the door to come in. A man met him, a deacon. says, "Do you have the Holy Ghost?" Mike says, "I I don't know." "Well, have you ever spoke in tongues?" "No, sir." Said, "Don't believe I have." He says, "You haven't got it." Mike said, "The only witness he had in his heart is that this man didn't have what he had." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And he walked in there and there was a little evangelist from Scotland preaching and casting out devils. And he he found out later that man had been in brother Brandham's meetings and had nothing but good to say. I tell you what, he had a fire lit from someplace. But what am I saying? There were shackles ready already to take a doctrine and tell a man, you haven't got it &gt;&gt; when he knew he did have it. He knew the God he had met. You understand what I mean? There's a doctrine and there's deeds and then there's a doctrine to control and a and a group of um uh uh a teachers, a priesthood to teach the doctrine to gain the power of the man. And listen, and I close with this, when it's anti- word, &gt;&gt; it's anti- Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That's why the message came. That's why God sent the messenger that you have received. Sent it so that you would not be conquered. But in fact, you would conquer that. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether he's got a bow. I don't care whether he has arrows. I don't care whether he has a sword. I don't care what he is intent to do. He's gone out to kill. He's gone out to destroy. The power of God in the living church is greater than any power that's been sent on by the Antichrist spirit. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have one that represents us &gt;&gt; before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; The living word of God made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads. Oh heavenly father, somehow there's a a sense of gratitude within us. We don't know exactly how to express it, but I pray that you will take those things that you would have made real to the people. Now Lord, I ask that you'll send the Holy Spirit and your presence to make it real. It can only come by a divine revelation and let the Holy Spirit utter to the inner man and witness the truth and what is truth in the name of Jesus Christ and that he al he alone will be glorified. Amen. I want to perhaps just have you stand if you would and I'd like to sing the anchor holds. [Music] Maybe you'd help me, brother Rod. Would you please? The anchor hold [Music] the [Music] The for [Music] my knees as I face the sees the anor can through Oh my [Music] Hey [Music] The Yeah. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. is a stor. &gt;&gt; I have been young. I have been young. I and there he was in the night through the storms of my life. Oh, that's where God proved his love to me. [Music] The end. [Applause] I have fall as I se [Music] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a couple of verses too of the old hymn Hold to God's unchanging hand. Time is filled with swift transition. &gt;&gt; That means we may not meet like this. Just think of it. Somebody here, good possibility, won't be here at the next meeting. We don't know. We have no guarantee of it whatsoever. I'd like to encourage you from the depths of my heart to hold to God's unchanging hand. And remember, his hand is nothing less than the word of God. Heavens and earth shall pass away, but my word shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've been married and united to Christ. Glory to God. I fil transition [Music] something [Music] to God's unchanging hand. You come to God's unchanging hand.

Oh God's unchanging hand first and your journey is completed [Music] to God. You have been [Music] your holy glory. Glorious soul. You got to God's unchanging hand. All saints just unchanging [Music] something to God's unchanging hand. As we sing the chorus once more, brother John Andy's would you please come and dismiss this body of people in prayer. ask God's blessings upon them. I'd like to say thank you for your time. Thank you for your real keen attention and attendance. Thank you for your prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you would keep praying for us. &gt;&gt; These are weighty matters that we're dealing with. And I'm very conscious at this time. I'm very very conscious almost daily that I have to stand and give an account for what is being said and preached. And I tell you every once in a while I I just would shudder at the very thought of misleading someone. It's a solemn serious responsibility. So I pray that God will guide you in your prayers and guide us in the word. We have a great message and it's hard to get it out sometime just because of its magnitude. But you pray that God will help us to take it and distill it and break it down to the people. Brother John chorus again. Oh, to God's unchanging hand to God changing. Amen. Lord Jesus, we want to praise you this afternoon. We want to thank you for riding out and delivering our souls that were in bondage. &gt;&gt; You've taken off the veil of deception. You've given us a clean heart and a new mind and a soul that would receive your word. &gt;&gt; Thank you for salvation. Thank you for revelation. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the truth. Thank you for the Holy Spirit this morning that in the service pulsating with every word, every line. We come to the close of this service, we have one desire that you would totally possess our beings. That we as your people that there would be no room for darkness, no room for ourselves. We die to ourselves. We yield to the Holy Spirit. We say yes with one mind and one accord with what your word is speaking to us and let it have its full effect in our lives. We pray at the close of this service. We say, Lord Jesus, come within our individual lives and burst through us, your desires and your will and what you have in your heart toward us and what you want to accomplish at this closing moments of time in your elected lady, your bride. Let there be such a pulsation of faith within our hearts that all things are possible for us as believers that when we pray, it is with faith. It is effectual. It is moving. It is the heartbeat of God. It is the desire for us at this end time. And Lord, we just embrace your word this morning. It has set our hearts free. We give it first place. Let us not be a lazy nonchalant people that take these things for granted. But Lord, you have opened our eyes and our ears ears for a purpose. And that that is that we would be the final voice to the final age. So let us not be consumed with ourselves or with le oysia but let us surrender our lives so that you could move through us so that you could heal through us so that you can deliver and fill our lives so that others around us could sense that we have been with Jesus. We love you this morning Lord. This is our life. And this afternoon, our brother Tom. Lord, it's more than men and our pastor is more than a man. It's a gift of God that we long to touch your hymn of the garment, your garment. Lord, even yesterday in a room just weeping ourselves, just weeping, Lord, wanting to see you greater in the midst of your people, wanting a Holy Spirit revival in the word to break out as I believe you are. But Lord, help us as your children to understand the pulsations of the spirit in every level, in every way, and what you're doing in our lives to bring us to perfection. So Lord Jesus, let our brother Tom be such a vessel that would get out of the way. It is for your sake that we ask these things that Lord our lives as your people would become the masterpiece that your word has spoken. we are. So this afternoon, help us as your people to quieten ourselves to lay before you, Lord, not to just eat natural things and speak about natural events, but to prepare ourselves for what you're doing in the word that is so great and so wonderful more than our jobs, more than our natural food, more than our schooling, more than what we do naturally. The spiritual bread is the most important. That when we come this afternoon that we would be ready and primed. That we would be inspired already. That your spirit could move mightily among us, Lord. And that we would be seeing spiritual signs and wonders, and that our souls would feed at a table that's been spread out before us, Lord. We love your appearing and we love life and we love healing and we love marriages that are being brought back and families that are being mended, cancers that are leaving, spiritual life that is happening while we yet hear the word. The Holy Spirit is doing supernatural things and we honor that and we revere that and we esteem that to the highest place. So we bless you this afternoon and we thank you for the service. May it continue in our lives. We pray and touch those that need a touch continually, Lord. And even leaving the service and they'll be leaving the internet and they'll be going into their back to their schedule and their lives. But I pray that the dynamo of what you're doing in our souls would continue and only get greater. We pray. Thank you for this time of oasis, a time that we can hear your voice speaking so many voices, but we have heard the voice of God today and the atmosphere that our brother Rod and the musicians and others labor to create for us. We accept that as your divine presence for us and we are healed. We are encouraged. We are embedded Lord in our spiritual lives. Thank you Lord. Bless your people in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're dismissing you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I'll say to you as you're going, uh, I've I've had I've had a lot of conversations with this one that I was preaching about today. And I kind of know what he says. He'll say, "You can't change. You're going to be the same." And I'll tell you what this says, tell him he's a liar. &gt;&gt; And if you're prepared to do that, you're in for a good time. &gt;&gt; Those of you that live on this side of the border and you see families and those on other side to prevent them or to make room so they don't have to go back and forth across the border for the evening service. If you can open your home or take them out for lunch or do that, that would just be great. That'd be wonderful. I dismiss you in Jesus name. Thank you. You're dismissed. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
