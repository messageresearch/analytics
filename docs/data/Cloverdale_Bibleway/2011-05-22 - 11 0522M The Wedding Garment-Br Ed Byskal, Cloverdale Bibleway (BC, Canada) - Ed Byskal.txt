Amen. We've got one service next Sunday at 11:00 as well. Got young peoples this coming Friday evening here at the church.

Lord, that we can be identified, Lord God, with the unveiling of your word. That we do not look to a Jesus that is of history, but we believe that there is a God today, Lord, that is living, not just living in our minds, but living in our hearts, living in our lives, living in us to tell. And Father, we've been rejoicing in the testimonies of God this last week and months. We can say because you live, &gt;&gt; we live also. And we rejoice, Lord, in this sister's testimony that you're alive and living in a people again. Lord, we're just so thankful that we have gathered this morning. We pray, God, that every need in divine presence will be met. For at the preaching of your word, the children of the Lord are healed. Heal your people by the word of God, we pray. Anoint brother Ed, anoint our ears to hear as we rejoice around the body, word of the son of man. Feed us from your table. Anoint us to believe. And let us rejoice this morning that you're a living God. Living Lord amongst the children of the bride of Jesus Christ.

Any others that are visiting with us, we want to certainly greet you and say God bless you to you. Just trust that you enjoy the service this morning. Amen. [Music] There's never been a better time for us to find out all the truth for our age, where we are. Cuz there's so many who depend on what he's done or what he'll do. I want to know what God is doing now. Not I was, not I will be, but I am to what God's promise for today. I'll save it cuz he's a living God and has a present plan. Cuz he's not I was not I will be but I am. [Music] I love to think about the future home of the earthly bride. But as for now, what did he say? And I can't live on some old man from all the ages that's gone by. I've got to know what God has promised for today. Not I was not I will be but I am to what God for today I'll say cuz he's a living God and has a presence he's not I will be but I am not I was that I will be what I am to God's for today.

It's going to be a great day when we gather on the other side, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brother Ivan, Sister Assassin arrived in China. And we have a little picture of uh Brother Ivan. Uh there we have it. And uh he said uh that they saw God's hand just full completely on this whole trip. Even to the even to the lineups. How many people know what lineups are? &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. But you know what God did for them? He said they had no lineups. There were lineups were there and somehow they said everybody the authorities always took them around and put them in a special lineup where there was no lineup. and they they got such special treatment. They said it started right here at the airport in Vancouver and uh they weren't uh standing in line waiting. Uh they asked us to come in a special route and all the security gates and customs and everything he said and all many little things that happened. But he said as soon as we arrived in Sanhen, brother Elvie didn't give me even one day to rest. and he shared at the new church and and then the questions and answers period afterward and they had a meeting on Friday and then the next day they're at another church on Sunday and of course questions and answers said brother Murphy knows that what that's all about because when church is over in China church isn't over it just just goes into another phase and then after questions and answers it's time for fellowship He said, "God is doing great things. The spirit of God is doing great things here in China and stirring this nation for more to come and maturing the older believers." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the way it should be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says, "We didn't miss any of the service of Cloverdale from Cloverdale, but we did miss all of you, your smiling faces and presence, and I'm glad they do miss that." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless brother Ivan and Sister Asenth. I suppose most of you knew sister Aston's mother was very very ill with cancer and uh in fact is very ill and they that's their first line that we are with AST's mom her name is Deborah and she's doing a way better now he told me in another email that the blood count which was down very low is going up and our cancer cells are going down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to lift our voice. Praise the Lord. Amen. Well, I know we have prayed and we want to open up their Bibles. Uh, I heard that uh, Brother Roger Lassard's sister Amber is here. Where are you, Amber? Upstairs. Oh my. Well, God bless you. Nice to have you in service this morning. Amen. We want to read out of Genesis the 24th chapter. Before we read, we'll bow and have you join with me in prayer. How great and how wonderful you are, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. and that we can come to you father as your children. We have many needs needs here locally. There are other needs in the bride body of Jesus Christ. Needs oh God wherever they may be. We are so thankful for what you are doing in the great nation of China. It's hard for us to imagine the population that is there that have not had opportunity to hear your voice, your prophet's voice. But oh God, as the brethren are striving and laboring and giving themselves both night and day, traveling many, many miles, oh God, giving of their energy and of their resources, and we are doing all that we can to support them. We want to support them now in prayer. May the Holy Spirit be with brother Ivan, Sister Asenath. I pray the Holy Spirit be with every one of the ministers, Lord, that are there carrying your message and all the new believers that have gathered. Oh God. Oh God. Yeah. I know that it's right for us to pray that there be a mighty sweep, a wave. Not only what's happening there, but let it be in other countries as well, Lord, around the world. Whether it be in Africa or Asia, whether it be oh God in here in America, we need we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit. And Father, I pray that as the word lays before us and as I look upon the page and read these words, Lord, I pray that the Holy Spirit will energize this vessel and may the uh speaker and uh hearers alike be anointed. Oh God, may we be surrendered, ready to hear, ready to act, ready to obey. And we say, "Here am I, oh Lord. I pray that you'll speak, oh God, to us. Give us your word. May your spirit of revelation fall upon this congregation, upon all who hear, Lord, the divine Holy Spirit of revelation. Reveal your word. May it not just be some word spoken. May it not be some message or sermon, oh God, but may it be a divine voice. Speak to the souls of our souls individually. And Father, I pray that you'll be praised and glorified. Thank you for the healing touch, Lord. For Sister Asenath's mother, oh God, let her be restored to good health again. Thank you, Father, for what you're doing in in our own congregation and those that you've touched and healed. I just give you praise and glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to excuse me. I just want to I just want to keep praising him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's been so good, so gracious. &gt;&gt; All right. We start to read at the 48th verse of Genesis 24. And we're breaking into the account of Eleazar uh going to find Rebecca, a bride for Isaac, which we know is uh means a great deal to us and Eleaser speaking. And I bowed down my head and worshiped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me to the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. And now, if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. and if not, tell me that I may turn to the right hand uh or the or or to the left. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, "The thing for proceedth from the Lord, we cannot speak unto thee, bad or good. Behold, Rebecca is before thee. Take her and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken." And it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard the their words, he worshiped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth. And he and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raignment, and gave them to Rebecca. And he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. I want to read then a second reading in Revelation the 19th chapter. Two verses verses n 7 and 8 of chapter 19 of revelation. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him. For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. God bless you. Thank you for standing. And I'll thank you in advance for your real keen attention this morning because we need uh to have a real focus during the service. The Lord has been gracious to us and the to myself at least I can only speak for myself as a minister as I have been reading the word and reading the message. It's just like places or things that you should have thought of but they haven't come to your mind. It's just like God is opening up areas that you didn't see before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is something that may not be something for some of you that are younger or uh newer in the message, but when you have spent a lot of years and spent a lot of time and then you find out you have to confess there is no limit. &gt;&gt; This is eternal word. &gt;&gt; This is this just continues to open up. in new ways. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I have to stop. I actually stop and say, "Lord, is is this you? &gt;&gt; Am I seeing what I'm seeing?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have to think about it prayerfully. And that's what some of the things that we have thought in fact is last night I'm I'm reading and just uh actually went to bed and was reading and listening some more and then it was just like something began to speak to me and I grabbed a pad and and wrote for about three pages just line by line by line by line. And that's something I really have to think about and uh Lord willing we'll minister it here in the in the near future. But I want to speak to on the wedding garment. I with God's help uh I believe that you also will see uh see it perhaps a little differently. You know, we're as humans, we're so tied to things that are physical &gt;&gt; and uh we see the wedding garment, but this wedding garment isn't like any wedding garment you've ever seen. &gt;&gt; Uh in fact is I want to make a statement. You are being clothed with this wedding garment even now. &gt;&gt; You're literally being clothed by that garment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh we will speak of things that perhaps refer to things that are not physical such as being clothed in humility, being clothed in righteousness, being clothed in revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Tell that's a wonderful garment. &gt;&gt; And someone who's not clothed in revelation is actually going to end up naked. clothed in wisdom and clothed in dignity and clothed in purity and holiness. &gt;&gt; Think of those things as we move along. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we think of being clothed in uh or being arrayed, uh most often we think in terms of something of a physical nature. Uh I just wonder in all honesty this morning, how many went into their closet or how many got up this morning and said, "What will I wear?" I checked on, you know, what what suit will I wear? I don't have that many, but I thought, which one will I wear? I checked one out and it wasn't quite. So, I just Okay, here we are. Most everybody because you you also you dress for the Okay, it's amazing how important that is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, is is everything just right? You know, does it does it match? Some of you men, you don't know whether it matches or you don't care whether it matches. And that's probably good. But you know, if you're dressing for you're dressing for the occasion, you dress for the day when you get up in the morning, you're just going to go to work and you just put on your grubs. or you say, "Well, no, I have to I have to meet someone today or I have to go out and uh you know, I don't want to say private things, but uh you know, I I get into the car or I'm going to go to the car and let's let's go out and she she'll check me out." She says, "We're not stopping any place, are we?" You know what that's all about? You're smiling and laughing because that's that's you. you you get there, too. We're not going to go to a restaurant, are we? Well, I don't know. We might if we get hungry. Might go to the Well, then I have to change. That that's just standard procedure. Uh, usually we dress for what we expect to be doing that day. There's a regular day, there's the home, there's the office, there's a meeting, there's a maybe a doctor's appointment, then we dress differently for a graduation. And uh some of the young people are thinking about graduation right now and uh and and and so they think about how they're going to dress for that occasion. Uh there are dress codes as well. Uh we have some young people who want to come from overseas and attend the school. And the school uh the brother the brother TCA's the principal and his wife sister Shelley. Uh that was one of the first concerns. These people need to know that it's not a dress code, but it is according to the scripture. There are some dress requirements and some things that are not permitted and not allowed and other things that are are expected. But then you you may prepare for something special. Dressing for a special occasion. Uh and a wedding of course is one of those special occasions when people usually a bride is assisted by someone and maybe her bride's made but they're assisted and they're essentially dressed by someone else. And then when you get into royalty there's royalty. We just had a a wedding was supposed to be the wedding of you know of the century or whatever more to me. I have to just be honest with you. I don't uh for a couple and a a young man, a young woman, royalty, and they've been living together for years and now they're going to get married and make a big halaloo for the whole world to see and all the rest. But I think that the fact they've been living together for years and now they're going to go and get married, that's is a disgrace. That's debauchery. And they're elevating it up. But you you you know I I I did see some of it on the computer and and uh it was on there for days and and you think of all the braid and the gold and the metals and the ribbons and how everything had to be just precisely precisely. I can tell you that it cost millions and millions and millions of dollars to put on that kind of thing. And the people they you know they they they got dressed and they got arrayed and they got uh in in this just pompous celebration. But I want to say to this humble congregation today that that doesn't even stand that's not even kindergarten stuff to what the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is going to appear. Let me tell you friends &gt;&gt; and remember it when you stand and watch the bride of Jesus Christ of which you will be a part start to come through. If these doors flew open now and they start coming from Africa start coming from Europe and all the national dress and begin to walk in here singing only believe or something there wouldn't be a dry eye. there wouldn't be anybody that wouldn't be moved. And you see them come out of their hardship and see them come out of Siberia, see them come out of the north and see them come out of the south. There wouldn't be anybody here that would not be watching these doors as the bride started walking in. You would clap, you'd shout, you'd cry, you'd do everything because it's it'd be the beauty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'd be people who've been cultivated by a certain word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And of all the peoples that have gathered and are sitting in pews exactly like you, there are very very few that have gathered around a vindicated &gt;&gt; don't don't forget it. A vindicated message. You know that this God that set the whole universe in place and set all the planets and the galaxies and billions and billions of them. I can't even imagine that kind of a God. But that God stood by a servant here on earth because of a voice, because of a word that was being spoken because he could say with authority, "Thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; And because that could happen, because that took place, I can tell you that kind of God will never leave that word. &gt;&gt; Never will leave that word. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're standing on good ground. And it's that word that I'm speaking of this morning. The vindication to me is is uh uh more than just uh just a phrase. Garments often identify a person's office or their rank or their position. It will it can identify their profession or their degree of royalty. also dress starts to and and this is where we're turning a corner now a little bit. It says that she was that she should be arrayed in fine linen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the word array or if you said array aren also is a very military word. There was an array of of of military men. And a array refers to an order. How it how things are ordered, how the arrangement of them. This bride is not some patchwork. &gt;&gt; And the bride's garment isn't a patch quilt. It's not just a piece of this and a little bit of man's idea and a little bit of my past tradition, a little bit of my forefather's thoughts and what I think is right. God doesn't think doesn't care what you think. &gt;&gt; He has sent his thought down. He's vindicated his thought and you're being dressed by his thought. This is what he thinks the the garment should look like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, a uniform is more than a dress. A uniform also is protective. &gt;&gt; The military dresses in a certain way and in their dress and in their uniform they also have protection. Uh the the police force, the firemen, all these different uh areas and arrangements, but dress is incredibly important. And the bride's dress is something uh that that involves protection. God dressed a couple people. &gt;&gt; The first ones. &gt;&gt; And it might not sound very glamorous to you, and I don't know where he got them, but they were bloody skins. And the prophet said that as they walked out of the garden, those hides and skins were slapping against the manly legs of Adam. And he said they could cry now as the first time they could shed tears now. And she put her head over on his shoulder as they were being excommunicated out of the garden. and and and and with the blood trickling from those hides down their bodies. But that was the best dress in the world. &gt;&gt; That was the best dress in the universe &gt;&gt; because that dress was something that was making a statement. You say, "Well, the way a person dresses makes a statement." That was making a statement. &gt;&gt; That made a statement that my sin, this fall, God's got an answer for this fall. Hallelujah. And God was the only one who knew how to dress them. &gt;&gt; And God's the only one who knows how to dress you &gt;&gt; and get you out of this world. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who knows how to dress you in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who knows what's required. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you what's required. A bleeding word. &gt;&gt; A message that's hated. &gt;&gt; A message that's been crucified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for the second crucifixion. A world that's been indicted for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And God has provided a garment. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Adam, he fixed his own garment. &gt;&gt; And he fixed her own garment and they swed it. &gt;&gt; It didn't call for some sewing and some skill. It called for death. It called for a penalty. It called for somebody to suffer, something to suffer. And unto Adam and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of and of skins and clothed them. Didn't He didn't throw them there and say, "Here, put them on." He clothed them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Garments can send a message. The Bible tells us of Judah's daughter-in-law, Tamar. I'm not going to speak much on it at all, but in Genesis 38:14, when she was refused, the youngest son is a husband. Her husband had died and the her brother who was supposed to raise up seed to him spilled his seed on the ground and God slew him. and she was promised the youngest son who was not of age apparently yet and uh the h and Judah didn't give him and told her to put on her garments of widowhood and go back home and so now she puts on her garments of widowhood that's one way of dress and when she heard that her father-in-law who did not keep his word Judah one of the patriarchs was up in the mountain with his friends shearing shape and was going that direction. She put on her garment. She put on a garment of a harlot and he was able to tell the difference. &gt;&gt; She didn't have a garment of widowhood on beside the path. She put on a garment of prostitution as a harlot. And he saw her and went in unto her and brought forth a child. It says, "And she put on and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way of Timnath and she saw for she saw that Sheila that was the youngest was grown and she was not given unto him for wife. And when Judah saw her, he thought her to be in harlot because she had covered her face. And so that's that's that's account in the scripture. It tells us that the priests they had certain kind of garments. And these are the garments which they shall make. A breastplate and an aphod and a robe and embroider embroidered coat, a miter and a girdle. and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother and his sons and he may that he may minister unto me in the priest's office that required a certain garment and it was told specifically how that garment should be made and the colors that would be used and so on and the scripture says that he may because he could not minister in that priest's office so he had to have a certain garment for a certain office I want you to tie the two together as we move through the the the the message today. The Bible speaks of David. Now we come to royalty. And David was clothed with the robe of fine linen. Now this is Bible. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said you you must see Christ in every verse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're speaking about Christ. We're speaking about believers. We're speaking about God's plan, God's program. We're not just tell this is not just some idle sermon that we're speaking about this morning. You're not going to you're not going to go to where you hope to go unless you're dressed in the right garment. &gt;&gt; And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen. The Bible tells us, "And Herod with his men of war set him at not." Jesus that was set him at not and mocked him. And part of this whole crucifixion scene was that they arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate. That was all part of the program. That was in this case, it was part of the mockery. to put him in a gorgeous robe and send him to Pilate. &gt;&gt; So to array is to clothe to be attired. But the word array also and catch this now because it will it's a it's a major shift in the service. It is to prepare or to equip. And when you think of being prepared or equipped, we think now in the sense of military or protection, this wedding garment that we are being clothed in and you need it desperately &gt;&gt; is a garment of protection. &gt;&gt; God is the only one who knows what we need &gt;&gt; because he's the only one who knows the tactic of the enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are many other references regarding being clothed that do not refer to the physical. I just read them quickly. Jesus said, "Consider the liies of the field. They grow, they toil not, they spin not." And yet I say unto you that Solomon in all of his glory was not a raid like one of these. Right. &gt;&gt; David said in the Psalms, "Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame &gt;&gt; and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle." Ezekiel it says part part of the verse all thine army horses and horsemen all of them clothed with all sorts of armor even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords all of that equipment and that has that has to do with being clothed that was part it's not just this but it is part of the array that they have as part of their office. They're in the military. All of your army, they're equipped. I want to say to this army of the Lord Jesus Christ, soldiers of Christ, standing at the post of duty, you have a sword. &gt;&gt; You have a helmet. You have a shield. &gt;&gt; You have footwear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have exactly what you need for this for this generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have exactly what you need. Maybe you came through a tough week. Let me tell you, you have equipment. &gt;&gt; You've been equipped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see the guards at the border, they got bulletproof vests. We got a vest. We got a shield that the darts of the enemy cannot penetrate. &gt;&gt; Nothing can penetrate it. [Music] In Esther, in the book of Esther, it speaks of those that were clothed with sackcloth. &gt;&gt; They clothed with humility and sackcloth because they were calling on God. In Psalms, it tells us, "Let the priests be clothed with righteousness," and that's a very important one, which we'll speak on just a little further. And let their saints shout for joy. And then in Revelation, we have three scriptures. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. &gt;&gt; And in Revelation 7 and9, there was a group that were clothed with robes, white robes. And in Revelation 12 and 1, and there appeared a great wonder in the heaven, a woman clothed with the sun. In Revelation, this is the fourth one. And he was clothed with a vesture, speaking of Christ, a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7 and 13, and one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these this great host of people? What are these which are arrayed in white robes? And whence came they 17 and 14 and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. And so the the harlot, the great harlot also is decked out &gt;&gt; and she is has a garment of scarlet and royalty which was a and and she's been set up on the on the in the minds of the people and in the eyes of the population. And you're living in this day. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not separated from it. This is part of your scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the preview of the bride, you that are sitting here and claimed to be followers of the message, your prophet saw the bride. And in the preview of the bride, he said, "I looked this way." And he said, "The bride will come into view for preview." And I looked coming to me and I seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women. I'd like you to notice in this account how the dress, and I'm not talking about the physical dress now. I'm talking about what they were dressed with to be cleanressed women. These were individuals who heard, who heard the word, who obeyed the word, &gt;&gt; who adhered to the word and loved the word &gt;&gt; because that's the thing they were dressed with. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else can make you clean, &gt;&gt; whiter than snow, than the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're washed in the blood &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. And she was clean dressed women I've ever seen in my life. But each one of them looked like they was dressed different. And they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth. Young women, they kind of looked to be about 20. And then he showed me the church. I'm not paraphrasing, but I have just selected certain portions of these paragraphs as they come up out of the ages. And oh, how vulgar. And the last one uh was this last church age which was led by a witch. And they were so immorally dressed, so filthy looking. And they were marching to the time of twist and rock and roll. And those women throwing themselves just in twist withholding just a paper gray hypocritical and gray looking paper holding in front of them. uh with which which laced like hoola skirts uh holding in front of them and completely nude from their waist up and was marching to the time or twisting and carrying on with that music walking up and and said and said this was the one that was with him and said that is the church. He said it made me sick at my heart. Now as she passed by the whole back part had no covering at all. And then as she passed by I felt faint and sickly. And then he said the bride will come into view preview again. And here here the bride came behind her. That very same looking bride had passed at the beginning. He says, "And then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride and she'll be made of the same thing and clothed the same the same thing that the one was at the beginning." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's going to happen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Every person in this building are going to be in one of those two groups. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's sobering. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; From the youngest to the eldest, that is sobering &gt;&gt; to those on the platform, the preachers, the deacons, the trustees. It's sobering. &gt;&gt; Announcement. Every person will be in one of those two groups. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not something in the future. It's something you're either being clothed right now. Those that were naked refused the garment &gt;&gt; that God sent to clothe them &gt;&gt; in this generation. &gt;&gt; We are being married here &gt;&gt; and go to the wedding supper. It's not that we get clothed to go to the wedding supper. We get clothed for the wedding &gt;&gt; in the greatest battle ever fought. He said, "God is getting his soldiers ready. God anoints his army. America dresses their soldiers in the best that they can have to dress with. steel helmets and armors and whatever they got armored tanks and whatever they've got get it go in and God dressed his army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said &gt;&gt; and I will say behind the prophet, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; God has dressed his army. &gt;&gt; We're not left here helpless friends. We're not left here unequipped. We're left here perfectly dressed for this world and now everything that it it can throw at us. He says, "And what kind of equipment do we use? The spirit of the sword, the word of God, the word of God sharper than a two-edged sword." Hebrews 4. piercing even to the ascender of the bone, even to the marrow of the bone, even the discerner of the thoughts. The equipment which we have, the equipment that a minister ministers behind the pulpit can penetrate the secret part of your heart. Even this morning, I'm aware of that. And the word of God is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. That's equipment. &gt;&gt; He said God fortified. This is putting on a whole armor. God fortified his army. What? With himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love when here when the prophet said, "You ought to see him ride out in battle once." You ought to see him right out in battle once. Friends, you're not left alone. You don't have to fight your own battle. God's going to fight your battle for you. I don't care what kind of battle it is. I don't care what Satan throws against you. We've got one who knows more about the economy. He knows more about the temptations. He knows more about sickness. And he is the victor. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, now I want you to hear this closely. He fortified his army what with himself in the form of it's himself &gt;&gt; in the form of prophets, apostas, apostles, teachers, pastors. What did he do? What was God doing? Listen. Did you ever think what the offices of the church is? It's God's dress. &gt;&gt; Inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a seer. Foresee before Satan gets to it. Done. Told it. &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, friends, &gt;&gt; this is your protection. &gt;&gt; What is it? God dressed up in his church. These offices is God's dressear. &gt;&gt; When you see these offices, when you see those offices, &gt;&gt; pastors, teachers, evangelist, what is that? That's God's dress wear, &gt;&gt; God's presence, God's spirit, and it's working through man. And if that office denies any of this word, then it's not God's dressing. No, not that &gt;&gt; God dressed the first Adam &gt;&gt; and the first Eve. He dressed them in what they had to have. It wasn't what they wanted. It wasn't what they thought of, &gt;&gt; but it was what they had to have. &gt;&gt; And God alone knows what's going to get us through this age &gt;&gt; and get us from mortals into immortality. &gt;&gt; And what was it the message to the last Leodysian church age? You're wretched. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're blind &gt;&gt; this age. &gt;&gt; Don't look for any help around the country, friends. You're wretched. &gt;&gt; This age is wretched. God has already sentenced it. You're blind &gt;&gt; and naked. &gt;&gt; Why are they naked? Because God came down and tried to dress them. [Applause] I don't know who dressed these people that just got united in in a great cathedral and but here in little humble places. &gt;&gt; People are being dressed &gt;&gt; by a prophet, &gt;&gt; a prophet word &gt;&gt; dressing the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And if that office denies any of this word, then it's not God's dressing." &gt;&gt; No, not that. That's the wolf &gt;&gt; in sheep's clothing. &gt;&gt; And that's another one. Did you ever think of so much? &gt;&gt; Did you expect this morning that you'd hear so much about dressing and about clothing and so on when you went into your closet, you didn't dream you're going to hear this kind of a thing, but you you want to be thankful. And I say I say before God Almighty, I even said to God this morning in prayer, "Father, I'm here because as even as a young man, I felt the call of God &gt;&gt; and I loved your word, &gt;&gt; never realizing that how important it's going to be to dress us and more and more concerned and more more intent upon it. As time goes on and as you get older, you want to you want to snug up even closer. &gt;&gt; And friends, don't live loose. &gt;&gt; Don't take things lightly. Don't take this message lightly. Whatever you do, don't take a word that God vindicated &gt;&gt; and take that prophet office and respect it &gt;&gt; more than you respect anything. You respect that office and things will go well between you and God. &gt;&gt; And he's the one we want to please. &gt;&gt; He's the one I want to find grace with. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, respect that word. &gt;&gt; And you'll find that you have a prophet dressing you. &gt;&gt; And at this place, you need some righteousness here. And over here you need some grace. And over here you need some something else. &gt;&gt; And you he knows how to dress you. &gt;&gt; We're either going to leave this life when we're changed. We leave this life clothed or naked. And the message Christianity versus idolatry our armor is Jesus Christ and all devils slide their brakes when they see that. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All devils, all devils &gt;&gt; slide their brakes. &gt;&gt; Not when they see you, when they see what you're armed with. &gt;&gt; When they see your equipment, &gt;&gt; when they see your dress, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't want to go with a simple little dart gun &gt;&gt; in front of these guys the way they're equipped. I tell you what, it intimidates me when I see all the gear that some of the police force and the home homeland security and all these guys, they got spray and pepper and clubs and and handcuffs and every kind of restraint and body gear all over them and you can't touch them. I I wonder sometime how those women especially how they even walk. I even wondered. I went through the other day, they called me and I and my wife and spent another 40 minutes &gt;&gt; doing nothing and we just stood there and I I I had time to study it. Thought how in the world I guess he needs it. I guess he needs it. I don't know what kind of thing. And do you know what they wear that day after day after day? Put that on. Snap it on. snap it here great big they have to find a walk like this &gt;&gt; you know what I'm talking about and they might they might not face that in a lifetime they might not face the danger in lifetime but they're dressed like that by their leaders because it might happen just once &gt;&gt; and God is dressing you for that moment &gt;&gt; hallelujah God is dressing you for that moment and don't you slack off because it didn't happen today or it didn't happen last week. It didn't happen. God is equipping you for the moment you do need it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching. You might not need it tomorrow. You might. &gt;&gt; But you get clothed. &gt;&gt; You get armed. You get equipped. &gt;&gt; That's what this garment's all about. It's equipment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So that when that dart does come, sir, &gt;&gt; it'll just fly off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That temptation comes, it'll just fly off &gt;&gt; that enemy, that dark cloud, that despondency. Be done with him. &gt;&gt; Let that thing hit your your shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the first time I'm taking another curve. Are you listening close? I know you are. &gt;&gt; The first time that the word righteousness appears in the Bible appears in God's redemption plan is in this line speaking of Abram. And he believed in the Lord. He believed in the Lord. Now we're going to come where the war really is. He believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Come and I'll show you the lamb's wife. And it was given to her that she should be arrayed &gt;&gt; in fine linen. And the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. &gt;&gt; She's Abraham's children. &gt;&gt; She's Abraham's royal seed. Abraham believed God. And for the first time, it scribed in the Bible and it was accounted to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that Abraham was a good man. The prophet said he was an idol worshipper or had come from an idol worshshiping family at least. And the Jew Jewish people have a tradition says the same thing. So it wasn't it wasn't that Abraham was looked at. That it wasn't Abraham was checked out that Abraham was was come before God and God looked at him and examined him and called him a righteous and accounted him as a righteous man. That wasn't it. It was that Abraham believed God and Abraham actually reversed what Adam and Eve did. They went one direction, he went the other. They doubted God. He believed God. &gt;&gt; And so God made him promise. I'm going to give you a seed. Like, I need a seed. I want a son. You're going to have a son. Your Isaac will be a type of my son, Jesus Christ. And he'll come through that lineage. Oh, I tell you what, friends. I got a I got a basket full, but I can't give it to you right now. Don't fall silent like that. And he believed God. You must, this is the main connection right now. He believed God. Believing God, I don't want to take anything away from you. Believing God is not merely coming to church. &gt;&gt; Believing God is not just having the fellowship of the believers. Believing God is not even just coming to the altar and and maybe repeating or repenting or whatever more. Believing God is is actually taking the word the word that God vindicated &gt;&gt; and absorbing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And believing it. And if you don't do it, the prophet said you don't believe it. and he believed God and was counted for him for righteousness. So I I would also like you to notice from that time that is in Genesis 15. And from that time until the son came from that time until the son came Abraham's struggle was to believe. That was always the struggle. Where's my son? Who's going to inherit the inheritance? this Eleazar from Damascus, where where is the where is my son? That was always the the question that he had a struggle with. It wasn't that he was praying for victory over something else. He he he even he told a lie. Say that you're my sister. He didn't even get convicted and repent over it. &gt;&gt; Now you're real quiet. you now you're real quiet and say, &gt;&gt; "Isn't that the scripture?" &gt;&gt; God never came to him and said, "You lied. You have to repent over that or I can't call you righteous." &gt;&gt; No. The fact was he believed God. He kept asking for the son, but he believed that the son was on its way &gt;&gt; and it's going to happen. It's going to happen. We're going to have the son. And God said, "You're righteous." &gt;&gt; You know something, friends? I may not be getting this across to you, but if you you get yourself into a relationship where you believe God and you please him, &gt;&gt; he's not going to be examining every thought that went through your mind and every word you said and oh, you lost it there and you're you showed some temper there and you became impatient there and you did this here. That's not the point. The point is how do you believe? &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, are you just wiping all those other things off?" No, I'm not. But the only way to have have success in your life is to be a believer. That's your foundation. He believed and you will come to your location. You will come to your place. &gt;&gt; That ought to make anyone happy. I can show that to you in the Bible. I'll never forget when brother Jeremiah from Zimbabwe was here and was speaking and he and he took a number of things in his way of teaching in such a lovely way. He took a number of things and and the the way the scribes and the Pharisees acted and what they spoke and and what they did and what they were condemned for doing. &gt;&gt; And Jesus even condemned them for doing those things. And yet he brought out how that the same thing happened amongst his own his own disciples. But he never corrected them for it the same way. He never dealt with them the same way. Why? Because they believed who he was. &gt;&gt; And that was the foundation. &gt;&gt; I know people who who are are perhaps very very weak in the natural or in the flesh, but they have they have a love &gt;&gt; for the message. They love this Lord Jesus. And I can tell you friends, that to me is the foundation. That's ground zero. How a person loves and holds and and holds dear the message to them and seeks to believe it with all their heart. &gt;&gt; I walked around this morning. I said in the study, "Dress me, oh God. There's no one that knows what I need like you need. Dress me. Dress me in your righteousness. Dress me with revelation. Let your prophet's words dress me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; How many of you you be honest with yourself? You had a question in your heart. You had a question in your mind and and you picked up a message and you started to read and you found exactly what you were thinking in your mind, what you were questioning. How many have had that experience because the author of that message knew exactly what you needed? &gt;&gt; He's dressing you. &gt;&gt; He's equipping you for the day for the for the thing that you were facing. He's equipping you. &gt;&gt; Your wedding garment friends &gt;&gt; in the message looking. So I want to speak about the supreme struggle now for a moment. The battle between belief and unbelief. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time the church needs to step across the line which separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and looking at the unseen by faith is now. If there ever was a time &gt;&gt; where we need to step across the line from unbelief to faith, &gt;&gt; it's in this age. Everything is thrown against everything. All of our senses and everything. Let me tell you friends, my precious friends, it's lying to you. &gt;&gt; Your feelings are lying to you. They're lying vanities. &gt;&gt; And Satan has access. &gt;&gt; Access to your memory channel. Your conscience has access to all those things. And he's stuffing it full. You have to say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, author of this word here, come according to your prophet's message and blow those flues clean." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let those thoughts be gone. &gt;&gt; And if you're here and you've been hounded by the enemy about your past or about your unsaved life, you tell that devil to go to hell &gt;&gt; because that's where he's going. I use that terminology with respect. That is where he's going. He's destined for hell. &gt;&gt; That's where he's going to end up. &gt;&gt; And he has no business on your trail. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say he's hounding you and on your trail and in your mind and giving you thoughts and trying to work emotions. You tell him to get out of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got the equipment. &gt;&gt; This isn't an idol course where you're saying, "I've got we've got the power &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. We have the power. I have to preach this." &gt;&gt; Some of you are your your theophony body is calling for this sermon. I'm preaching it because you need it. You must not live a defeated life &gt;&gt; when Christ has equipped us in such a way. &gt;&gt; In Queen of Sheba, he said, "And there's only two faculties that can govern you, and that's either faith or unbelief." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen, would you? Yes. &gt;&gt; There's only two faculties, &gt;&gt; only two faculties, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That can govern you, &gt;&gt; control you. &gt;&gt; Faith or unbelief. &gt;&gt; It's not nothing halfway in between. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; You cannot be halfway between. &gt;&gt; And the only sin that there is is unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think the congregation should say that the only sin that there is is unbelief. &gt;&gt; All the others are attributes. &gt;&gt; Not that it makes them any better. They're attributes of unbelief. But when a person finds himself stumbling and stumbling and stumbling, the problem is you're you're failing to believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To believe. &gt;&gt; That's why Satan hates the believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't care about popularity. &gt;&gt; In time of decision, I want to be honest to my master as Eleazar was." &gt;&gt; I want a clean cut decision out of you. &gt;&gt; Like Eleazar &gt;&gt; and sign of the sign of this time. Notice now sign of this time. It's the message and that's a true servant of God always is obedient to his master. That's a true servant of God. &gt;&gt; Not to show off or say something to elate somebody else, but to be honest and true with him that sent him. &gt;&gt; And that's a true servant of Christ. And then he goes on like Eleazar, a representative coming from Abraham to pick up the bride to Isaac, the beautiful Rebecca, obedient, the model servant. He was about his master's business alone. &gt;&gt; What a type of the Holy Spirit today. Now I just have to take you back a wee bit in brother Bram's ministry and in his first service that you have recorded in faith is the substance with 1947 before many of you were born and he says these words and if I can get you to believe me with all your hearts that's what moves God. That's not algebra. &gt;&gt; That's not complicated. &gt;&gt; That's not rocket science. &gt;&gt; If I can get you to believe me, &gt;&gt; that's what moves God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's still a very, very important statement for us. &gt;&gt; If I can get you to believe me, he said, &gt;&gt; that's what moves God. You want God to move, &gt;&gt; you believe what he has said &gt;&gt; in a trial. I'm trying to get you to believe it. Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; An identified Christ of all ages. It's to get you to believe that his presence is here to keep his word in the voice of the sign. Could you ever grasp what is going on? Now, he's talking to a group of people there. Why is he saying that? Because he knew they were having difficulty to grasp what is going on. &gt;&gt; And when I read that, I had to say to myself, I said to God, that's no different than right this morning. And I have to say this, I'm going to quote this because the congregation here and the people he was speaking to all have the same difficulty to grasp what's going on. &gt;&gt; Pinch yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you don't think that speaking like that that I'm trying to influence you to look at some man or believe some man. I'm not doing that, friend. I'm trying to get you to believe who it is that we're in the presence of now. &gt;&gt; And that happens to be probably one of the most uh difficult things that we as humans have is to recognize in whose presence we are now. And I have to keep going back to uh who is this MelzDC and some of these others that they even so like the voices are here, the airwaves are here, radio sound signals are here, television images are going through the room and he says so is the angels here. [Music] &gt;&gt; All they need is some apparatus that can catch a hold of it and your heart. You have the you have the facility. You have the capacity. You actually have been given by God something within your soul that can reach out &gt;&gt; and lay hold of the influence of the supernatural beings. And he said, "And even so is Christ here." &gt;&gt; Where's Christ? He's in the air between you brothers and me. between these brothers, between you at the seat, the atmosphere, every attribute of Almighty God is per permeating the air you're breathing. &gt;&gt; So the word of faith is na you even in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of God. The word of God. Faith is ny even in your mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for people for us to realize the challenge is to realize who's here to believe what he said. &gt;&gt; That's the challenge. &gt;&gt; I won't ask for you to raise your hand, but there isn't a man or woman or child here. But what they have something to say, I just desire a change. I desire a transformation. You have the power to bring that about by believing the word. And if the word tells you that the power is right resonant with us, &gt;&gt; that is the one thing that's so difficult to grasp. That's why it was the same there as it is here. Is that to grasp that he is present. &gt;&gt; He is present. &gt;&gt; The supernatural is present. &gt;&gt; Lay hold of it. &gt;&gt; You ought to sing and shout and dance. My answer has come. &gt;&gt; I don't have to keep waiting and waiting for my change to come. &gt;&gt; The change is present with me. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the eternal one, but the thing that you desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The servant. Brother Brenham. He compared himself to Eleazar the servant. I'd sooner have a man called William Brandham than I'd have Eleazar. And the Bible says and Eleazar gave jewels of gold and jewels of silver and raignment. And the jewels can be anything from precious stones to but precious stones is not the first thing in the Hebrew. A jewel is an instrument or an implement or a vessel. I tell you in a country if you didn't have you didn't have something to hold water and bring it from the well in a place that's all sand dunes and maybe 110 or 15 degrees every day and you're living under a tent of goat skins. You don't want some ruby stone that you hang on your forehead. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That won't do you any good. &gt;&gt; But if somebody give you a nice vessel &gt;&gt; it's a jewel. So there were vessels. &gt;&gt; It was an implement. &gt;&gt; It was a utensil. &gt;&gt; An implement for hunting or for war. If you had raiders coming in and you were given an implement, jewels, an implement to protect yourself, an implement to get you food and to get you water and something to protect you and to give you what you have need of. And you and and or it could be something an implement or a tool for labor and also it also come from a second word and that is to accomplish or to finish. He gave her jewels that she would be complete. She to be accomplished to an end to finish to be completed and to be fulfilled. She was unmarried and he and he was bringing her the news and going to lead her and take her back to where she'd be united with the husband and make her one of the great women of the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's been completed. &gt;&gt; Took her out of an empty house. Took her out of just a another girl in the family and raised her up to be a mother of the faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, that's something that that's being really finished and that's a fulfilled life. &gt;&gt; And here's the servant. &gt;&gt; Here's what your servant has said. Here's what he's saying. He's saying, "I believe you are here. I know you are here. Your spirit is moving. He didn't ask the people, do you feel it? He said, I know it's that way. &gt;&gt; And because he said that, I also know it's that way. &gt;&gt; I know that this Holy Spirit which gave authorship to this message, this word is present to stand behind this word. And if I believe it with all my heart and punctuate it with an amen, if you'll punctuate it, it'll go from my soul to your soul, it'll go from this attribute to your attribute. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He said, "We feel the sweetness of your presence. You're moving through the audience doing just what you said you would do. And now, Father, we thank you for doing this. We believe and I take and he said and I simply repeat what he said so that the people will know uh what kind of servant has come to get you &gt;&gt; and I take every one of these souls that's standing at this altar place yourself there &gt;&gt; in your own soul and spirit place yourself there as your servant I stand between them and death &gt;&gt; I stand between them and unbelief. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's the kind of servant I want. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man I want to dress me. &gt;&gt; And I pitch myself in the way in the name of Jesus Christ. And I say to Satan that binds them, you cannot hold them any longer. &gt;&gt; I challenge every devil that's present to leave these people and to come out of them. What a servant. You cannot hold them any longer. Their sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Their unbelief is gone. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to explode. &gt;&gt; That's your servant. &gt;&gt; That's your messenger speaking. &gt;&gt; Don't go home with your unbelief. Don't go home with your questions. say, "I accept that." &gt;&gt; If it's good enough for those people &gt;&gt; and he would give it to those people and he's no respector person, then I accept that [Applause] &gt;&gt; their unbelief is gone. They're children of God from this hour on &gt;&gt; their ministry is in their life will be great. &gt;&gt; The power of God shall accompany them everywhere they go. Amen. &gt;&gt; They shall be God's children from this hour on. &gt;&gt; Satan, I'm talking to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eleazar couldn't say that. Eleazar had no call or capacity to say that. But the last church age messenger knew that there had to be a bride seal. Satan, I'm talking to you. The devil has been talking to you. has been talked to by a prophet. The devil tries to lie to you. He's already heard a prophet's message. Satan, I'm talking to you. Let those people go. &gt;&gt; They are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Their unbelief is gone. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want to receive that? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is reality, friend. I don't care what kind of problem you have. This is the solution. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Leave them in the name of Jesus Christ and come out of them. Now he says, "Now every one of you believe it and raise up your hands and give him praise and you can go from here free tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." God is timeless. &gt;&gt; It has no difference about when that was said and what is today. That same God who sent that same man sent him to you. &gt;&gt; He was their servant. He's your servant. That's why God preserved his voice. &gt;&gt; So you would hear the same words. These are not somebody else's words. This isn't from memory. These are his words. Do you hear it, friends? [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me see you raise your hands on the balcony. &gt;&gt; You hear? You accept it. You believe it. &gt;&gt; It's to you directly. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] So it is said of Rebecca &gt;&gt; that she was given jewels, brought forth jewels and raymond and gave them to Rebecca. But of the wife of the lamb, it is said that she was granted to be arrayed in fine linen which was the righteousness of the saints. &gt;&gt; And to be arrayed, as I said earlier, to be put in a proper order. You were in a place, who knows where you were. I don't know what your past or your religious background or anything else but you were in the wrong arrangement &gt;&gt; and you couldn't be arrayed in righteousness there &gt;&gt; and so he's taken you and put you in a proper arrangement. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in the evening messenger, now notice, evening messenger, your servant, your prophet, your messenger. &gt;&gt; He said, Eleazar, he sweated it out. &gt;&gt; And he found character. &gt;&gt; He was looking for character. &gt;&gt; You that have the devil talking in your ear, you don't have the character of Jesus Christ, I can tell you that you have the substance that produces that character. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says until he found it, he says, "Who would he get?" And he trusted God. Character for what? Character for Isaac, the bride, which the church is a type of. It says, "And that was the natural seed of Abraham." This is the royal seed of Abraham. Well, if Eleazar the messenger hunting the bride and trying to find character, if that man is come, a messenger in the last day, &gt;&gt; trying to find the bride for Christ, &gt;&gt; he will not look for denominational memberships. &gt;&gt; How thankful you and I ought to be. He didn't adjoin himself and attach himself to some big church for denominational memberships, but he spoke to the rank and file. He spoke to the poor. He spoke in little house meetings to find character. &gt;&gt; Character that would love the word, love this Christ. &gt;&gt; He will look for character that's willing. &gt;&gt; Watch. She said good character first, then to get her ready to meet Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; After he found the character, then to get her to stand still &gt;&gt; long enough &gt;&gt; to listen to the message of Isaac. &gt;&gt; It couldn't be worded any more perfectly. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. We say we sit here in a comfortable church, but we hear the word of God and we know that the Holy Spirit who brought this message is bringing it to you. &gt;&gt; And this is part of God's dressing. &gt;&gt; The apostles, the prophets, the pastors, the evangelists is part of God's dress. &gt;&gt; God through it is dressing you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you've ever put if you've ever put the wedding uh the wedding garment someplace in the future, forget it. &gt;&gt; We're being united now. &gt;&gt; We're being dressed now &gt;&gt; that we shall not be found naked. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this business is standing still long enough. in the Brandham tabernacle on the wall. If you've seen the pictures, be still &gt;&gt; and know that I am God. &gt;&gt; Be still &gt;&gt; is being the part of it. &gt;&gt; You won't find that he's God. If you're always agitated and you know your mind is going and and you hear something and you hear something from the word, you hear something from the message and the mind is going off uh 90 miles an hour trying to find some objection to it. It's a devil. &gt;&gt; It's a devil trying to find an objection to it. &gt;&gt; And other people want to say, "You're just brainwashed." Praise God. I got brainwashed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I find what I have is something that the world hasn't got. &gt;&gt; And the pretenders don't have it and the hitchhikers don't have it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You may wonder why I'm looking so intently. I'm looking for your response. &gt;&gt; I'm looking to say you believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, you shall receive it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who wouldn't want this? &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want this? Lovely Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Preparing you to meet him. Preparing you to physically &gt;&gt; say him. [Music] trying to find a bride for Christ &gt;&gt; that she will stand still &gt;&gt; to get her stand still long enough to listen to his message of Isaac in the prayer of dedication of the church of the God hiding himself in simplicity's first message in the seals message he says may the Holy Spirit spirit as it was in the day of the dedication. Now notice he's bringing it from the day of the dedication way back there which you read of I think in Chronicles the 17th chapter and he's bringing it right to the present moment. He said when Solomon prayed in the Holy Spirit in the form of a pillar of fire and cloud came in the front door and rode up around the cherubams and went over to the holy place and there took its resting place. And then he goes into prayer. Oh Lord God, let it repeat again as we give ourselves to thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm reading this because that God that was back at that dedication at the dedication of the tabernacle, we're dedicating ourselves. It wasn't the building that was important. It was the people. &gt;&gt; And it says the people, they're the character. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, and he it said this, and I'm taking this prayer for ourselves. And is written. It is written. Ask and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Believe it, friends. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want you to believe it. Satan doesn't want you to believe it. &gt;&gt; Believe that. Ask and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; And we commit ourselves with our offering of the church this morning to you for service for the latter day light for the evening time lights. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we might bring consolation and faith to the waiting people that's waiting for the coming of the bridegroom to dress a bride. Here they go in simplicity at the opening of the seals waiting for the coming of the bridegroom to dress a bride in the gospel of Christ for the Lord Jesus Christ to receive this. We dedicate said myself and brother Neville and the congregation to the service of God in the name of Jesus Christ. That was the dedication. I say I receive that dedication prayer on my own behalf. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the ministry of this church, on the original vision of this church, I said, "Oh, God." Didn't start here, friends. It started in a house. &gt;&gt; And that same God met us in the house. &gt;&gt; And here's one of the brothers of one of the earlier brothers. There's several others. And the first thing I suggested to all of them was get into the tape. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hear what he said. I didn't have anything valid to say. Nobody has anything valid to say. &gt;&gt; I've had people come in, young men, and go into the message and go through the serpent seed, and they couldn't wait to get out of there. They said, "I'm going to go and tell our pastor." I said, "I I wouldn't do that." Oh, he'll see this. &gt;&gt; It was so clear, crystal clear. They went out, never saw them again. This garment's not a patch quilt. &gt;&gt; It's not what my pastor thinks or what somebody else thinks or what I was taught in Sunday school. That was one of the things I ran into snags all the time is I started going through the message. I thought that isn't what I was taught in Sunday school. &gt;&gt; And then I said, am I going to put my Sunday school teacher at an equal basis with this prophet? So I had to disregard them. Disregard that. disregarded all my own ideas. I had a wonderful sermon on typology out of the out of the Old Testament and I found out and and and it was well I'll just tell you about it. I preached on it as a young fellow and where where the servant when it got the year jubilee and he could go free and he wouldn't go. He just wanted to stay with his master and his master would bore an all through his ear &gt;&gt; and put a hole in his ear because and we preached and not only me, I heard others preach. He just loved the master so much. And so the master just marked him and he never he never left that master. He became a servant of his master forever. That's what he wanted to. And I thought, you know, it's like a love mark. And the prophet turned right around says, "When you heard the message, you wouldn't go and you got marked with that denominational thing and you remained a slave forever." Thought, "Oh my goodness, there there's another one's got to go out. [Music] &gt;&gt; We had to forget a few, didn't we, brother Ernie?" &gt;&gt; Lots of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now we have an absolute. People say, "Oh, that's dangerous." Oh, it is dangerous for the devil. &gt;&gt; Not dangerous for you or me. &gt;&gt; Oh, that serpent, he's so slick. He wants to come in and and and and destabilize you on what you believe, well, you just watch it. The very purpose he wants to destabilize you is cuz he got something he wants to slip in. And soon as they see you shake and question a wee bit, says, "I got the answer for you. Is it vindicated?" No, it's not vindicated. They don't even know what vindication means. &gt;&gt; Is it the presence of the pillar of fire? They don't even know what you're talking about. You're speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; You're speaking in unknown tongues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Can I go a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Now, I got some things that I can't fully answer, but nevertheless, uh you can think about this one. Don't think about it too long because I want to go on. But this beautiful Rebecca when Jacob and Esau came and Jacob loved the birthright. Now remember what I said a few minutes ago. You can have all kinds of faults and all kinds of weaknesses and all kinds of failures and all kinds of things. Some of you are born stubborn and some of you are born you'd go almost anyway and some of you born with different desires and things. That's all part of your upbringing. And some of you born quiet, can't hardly pry an amen out of you. Others are born boisterous and a whole bunch all in between. And uh uh this message isn't a mold where we just push everybody through and they all come through like so many sausages. The same size, the same, you know, that's not that's not what the message is. You're you're quiet. Well, okay, you're quiet. If you're boisterous, fine. Glory to God. We need some of those. &gt;&gt; Uh some are emotional, some aren't emotional. Uh so we have all of those things that that's all human. That's all in the natural level. Put this one together. Rebecca, she favors Jacob. And Isaac, brother Brown calls him the prophet. And he said he became he was now blind naturally and he became spiritually blind. &gt;&gt; A prophet became spiritually blind. &gt;&gt; Right? and and and now watch the thoughts of God somehow I won't even try to explain this but she takes Esau's garment and puts it on uh Jacob and Esau was a hairy man and so he got skins and put it over his hands She's working in deception &gt;&gt; and she's going to deceive the prophet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Into blessing her favorite son, &gt;&gt; which happened to be God's favorite. &gt;&gt; She was already working in the realm Jacob of love, Satan, Esau of hated. you're quiet, &gt;&gt; you'll go home thinking this one over. &gt;&gt; So, she actually works in this deception and gets a blessing by deception. &gt;&gt; And even by a lie. Who art thou my son? I am Esau, thy firstborn. &gt;&gt; Wow. You say, "How in the world could God bless that?" Because he had his mind on one thing, the birthight. I got to have the birthight. And whatever it gets to take the birthight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I expect you to be quiet. You know why? You're not going to figure it out either. But I can tell you one thing. I I've had to overlook a whole lot truckloads of weaknesses and all kinds of things that happened. You ought to see the gang we had when this church first started. Tell you what, you know, that's why I believe in miracles. We lived in miracles all the time. We just lived in miracles and faults and failures and this and that and oh my goodness, all the rest of it. But they loved the word. &gt;&gt; When they heard the word, they loved the word. &gt;&gt; Jacob had to have the birthright. Whatever it took to get the birthight, climb over over whoseever head and do whatever you need to do. Have your mama make a pot of stew, wear your brother's uh garments, and and and then and then here's where I think Isaac, oh, God, forgive me if I'm wrong. I think where Isaac made his mistake. He said, "Come near my son." And he smelt him. &gt;&gt; That's one of the channels of the flesh. &gt;&gt; And he smelled right. And he said, "Come close." And he felt him. &gt;&gt; That was the second channel. And so he smelt him and he felt him. So you feel right. He said, "Have you made some pottage?" "Yes, I have it here. Something that my father loves." And so he ate the pottage and it tasted right. He had a little twinge with his hearing, &gt;&gt; but maybe it was like mine wasn't all that good anyway. So he says, "Well, you smell like Esau. You feel like Esau. You don't quite sound like Esau, but anyway, he convinced him, I am Esau. So, just come here and I'll bless you. And he just blessed him. You You think that, oh, well, anybody I can just take that back. I'll just rewrite it. I'll just do something different. No, no, no. God sees these things. &gt;&gt; God has a certain order. God has a certain arrangement. And he just finished blessing him when Esau came through the door. Father, here's the pottage. Have blessed me. &gt;&gt; He said, I've already blessed Jacob. And the Bible says he cried and he wailed with a loud voice because you can't take that back. Let me tell you something, friends. When God put a blessing &gt;&gt; on this messenger and this message and all who believe it, &gt;&gt; it's the same God who said, "Who I've blessed, I've blessed. &gt;&gt; And I cannot reverse it." Oh, I'm glad he can't reverse it. Even God can't reverse it. I bless this word. I bless this servant. I bless this prophet. I bless this message. And I bless all who believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All friends. &gt;&gt; You get what I'm saying? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Right now, I've got stories going through my mind, accounts going through my mind you wouldn't believe. &gt;&gt; So, I won't tell you. &gt;&gt; I'll close with this. For we know Paul said that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Are you saved? Are you redeemed people? &gt;&gt; You are. &gt;&gt; Do you know how you got here? You know how you got to that state? Cuz one descended and came down and clothed himself &gt;&gt; in flesh. &gt;&gt; That's true. and was born like you were born. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; of a woman. He clothed and God &gt;&gt; came and dwelt in a building &gt;&gt; in a house &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And if this body, this house is dissolved, &gt;&gt; you have another house. Are you in the heavens? And this all ties together now. And the and the message that we are preaching, the word that we're speaking, and the word that we believe is adding to that is why we won't go from here naked. &gt;&gt; We will be dressed. &gt;&gt; We will have a house. &gt;&gt; We'll have a tabernacle, whatever you want to call it. You have a house now. And you move from this house to that house. &gt;&gt; And you skipped around the original. You came secondarily through a sexual birth, but you're having a birth now. And you came by a second birth. You've been born again &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; not through a sexual birth, but by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the seed of Almighty God came out of the mouth of a prophet and gave you birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you've been born again, &gt;&gt; not by corruptible seed, which is by the natural birth, but by incorruptible seed, [Music] &gt;&gt; even the word of God. That's how you're born. That's why you're here, sir. &gt;&gt; So, if this house is dissolved, &gt;&gt; we have another. And it's not that that's some pie in the sky a long way. You have another. &gt;&gt; It's no one else's. Right. &gt;&gt; You have this body here &gt;&gt; and God through a process he allowed &gt;&gt; from your father and your mother you came into this life into this house &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham goes into it I don't want to be be repeating myself but he goes into it in such detail especially in things that are here to things that are to be and so on and how we are moving towards the eternal home and another one is being made ready for you to step into and we have all kinds of questions well will it be ready and how is this affecting it brother Brandham says in another place I just read it I probably have the quote here as well saying that here if we are in you know if we're not formed perfectly we may have an affliction he said there'll be no affliction over there. I I I don't understand it completely. It does speak about us losing our reward. So, I wouldn't want anybody to lose their reward. But it says this, "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For now, I'm going to take this next verse. This is uh 2 Corinthians 5 and 1 and two. And the second verse I'm taking into four parts or three or four parts. For in this we grown. In this we grown. Doesn't say in this we sit in church and we just are you know take this casually. In this we grown. &gt;&gt; This is earnest earnest craving. Remember here I spoke a few weeks ago said of all those people who came before brother Brandham we don't have one who say I'm craving I'm groaning for the rapture but Apostle Paul is saying it here we groan &gt;&gt; to be clothed upon &gt;&gt; it would be good for you to come into the house of God sir &gt;&gt; and you can barely move one foot ahead of the other groaning. I'm desiring. Oh God, take your servant. Take your minister. Have him say what I need. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't even know what it is. &gt;&gt; I don't know what my insufficiency is, but make it up. Oh God, do in me what I need to do. &gt;&gt; Grant, oh God, what my theophony is calling for, what the unseen realm is calling for. cause it to happen. &gt;&gt; Friends, I trust what I'm saying is making sense to you. For in this we grown. In this, Apostle Paul says, we grown. &gt;&gt; And this is it. Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon. &gt;&gt; It's number two. In this we grown in this statement. Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon. Oh God, not that we desire to die. &gt;&gt; We don't desire to do that. And he even says that with our house which is from heaven. &gt;&gt; He he he's already talking about it now. &gt;&gt; With our house which is from heaven, &gt;&gt; we're hearing from it, friends. &gt;&gt; That's why he would say you're hearing from your theophony. Am I getting too much swimming water here? Is this all right? &gt;&gt; You're hearing from this this vindicated message. &gt;&gt; We have no concept in these puny human minds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To understand the depth of of God's uh seriousness about his word. Let me just tell you what's really in my heart. And I hope you don't tire of this, but I I have never in all of my life, I've never been able to comprehend how there's multitudes and tens of thousands and millions and millions of people, but that pillar of fire would not leave that prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he made mistakes, but that pillar of fire wouldn't leave him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had desires. He had cravings. He says one place that he wanted to be at the altar. He should be at the altar. He wanted to be at the altar. Didn't change. He get right up in the next service and said, "Now, if it would help you to believe and he will come." Did he ever fail to come? Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; What does that tell me? That tells me that just beyond the veil of this site was a angel of the Lord, none other than the Holy Pence and the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ, ready to come, standing there as it were, watching all around him to vindicate, to make sure the people would believe what he was saying. &gt;&gt; How many times would you ever hear a man standing behind the pulpit saying, "Now, if he doesn't come now, I'm a false prophet." &gt;&gt; You don't hear that. But he said that many times. And did he ever fail to come? No, he never failed to come. So if he never failed to come, what kind of importance should we put to it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why would he do that? Because he knew that it would be the words coming from this that's going to call you. He's going to go searching for that bride. He's going to go searching for that character. And he's going to find it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you just bear with me another moment or two, please? &gt;&gt; Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house. Our house. &gt;&gt; Your house. &gt;&gt; You have another body. It's your house &gt;&gt; which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed, listen to the apostle now. If so, if so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. &gt;&gt; I'd like to I thought when I read that and put that down again, I'd like to preach on that. We shall not be found naked. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, even as humans, it's difficult to sometimes speak about this these kind of things because there's so much shame &gt;&gt; attached to it. We see people and they dress in a certain way. I don't want to even get on to it, but they dress in a certain way, you feel sorry for them. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said if their grandmother dressed that way, they'd have put her in the institution. They'd put her in jail. But they dress that way, they don't even think. and and they go to a place like you go to Hawaii, you've been to Hawaii, you go to Hawaii, people walk around there and it's it's not only a disgrace, it's gross &gt;&gt; and it's a shame. &gt;&gt; And you you you can just ask yourself, would that woman go home and walk down the street of their her town in that garment or lack of garment? No, she wouldn't do it. She'd be horrified. She wouldn't even meet the mailman at the at the door that way. But they'll because, you know, it's this is this is a, you know, this is uh Mexico or this is Hawaii or this is some grand place and and they walk around naked. &gt;&gt; I I have a resentment against Satan for taking the beauty spots of this world and transforming him into such hell holes. He doesn't own that sand. He doesn't own that ocean. He doesn't own that beauty. He's a robber &gt;&gt; and I resent it very much. And the meek shall inherit the earth. &gt;&gt; You'll have all the beauty spots and there'll be none of that wickedness. &gt;&gt; They won't have all these casinos and all of this trash. Help me out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We shall not be found naked. &gt;&gt; For we that are in this tabernacle do groan &gt;&gt; being burdened. Not that we should be unclothed. We don't want to die. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be unclothed, &gt;&gt; but that we be clothed upon with mortality. &gt;&gt; That mortality might be swallowed up in life. &gt;&gt; So, it is for those people who have a a a a vision, I mean, a revelation of of what immortality is, truly is. It's not what the religious world has said it to be. You know, you're going to go up in some ladder or go up in some cloud or something else. It's things that are happening. If that's why the prophet would say if the people could only grasp what is happening, &gt;&gt; we shall not be found naked. &gt;&gt; And naked is simply unclad. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, how's it going to be?" Well, I don't know. How's it going to be? I sat in front of this presence and I know exactly exactly how the people are feeling when brother Brandham would say and you can hear him on tape. Do you hear the tapes? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You hear him say and he generally says it quietly. You couldn't hide a thing in your life right now &gt;&gt; if you wanted to. You couldn't hide a thing. Why? Because he knows it all. No, the presence that they came into knows it all. &gt;&gt; You know what, friends? I sat there and he said, "Brother Eddie, I riding on this hill on a horse behind brother Southwick and he came to me there and that's when I fastened my eye. He fast our eyes locked from about this far. The scripture that went through my mind was in Daniel when his eyes were as candles cuz they weren't sharp, they weren't sparkling, they weren't piercing, but they were like all knowing and like it just bored. And I thought I thought instantly in seconds of my life from a child just a young young child and I knew one thing and that's exactly what I said within myself. I am naked in this presence. There isn't a thing. There wasn't there wasn't a word I could justify anything. I there wasn't a belief. There wasn't a doctrine. There wasn't anything good. There was nothing to say. And then he said, and I believe you have three questions. Oh, I'm so glad. He didn't say you're an unclean, dirty rat. &gt;&gt; You questioned my m You questioned this ministry. You doubted this ministry. You said this and you said that. And I I you said just a few days ago if brother Brandham tries to come to this and tries to go around the scripture uh that'll be the end of our friendship. That would have been true too. I had quoted the scripture and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bore a son and called his name Cain. For I've received a man from the Lord and I thought if he tries to go around that and escape that and avoid that there'll be the end of our friendship. never said that. He could have said that. I'm saying it to you. Maybe some people will abuse that or whatever more. It's out on the internet. I don't care. He knew it was the truth. God knows it's the truth. I know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; But here's the grace of God. Didn't say you're a scoundrel. You're filled with doubt. You're filled with question. He said you have three questions. You want to know about the Godhead and you want to know about the baptism and you want to know about the serpent seed. And I said, "That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have that kind of a father? &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where you're at. He knows exactly. He knows. He knows that you're here cuz you want God. You want him." &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Well, brother Bis, would he have those kind of questions? You've had those kind of questions. &gt;&gt; Had all kinds of questions. There's a group that's found clothed and a group that's found naked. Those the only two groups we have in the scripture. And I came here this morning to say that this wedding garment is not something that you're going to get and put on there. You you're being dressed right now. &gt;&gt; And you want you want something out of my heart to you. I would go out to this place. I'd find a little place of prayer and I'd say, "Father, let this vindicated message &gt;&gt; that you spoke dress me." &gt;&gt; I don't even know exactly what I need, but when I hear, "Let me be dressed by that prophet." &gt;&gt; Is that too extreme? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't they think that's all right? Dress me and make me ready &gt;&gt; for what? I don't know what I'm going to face tomorrow. Do you know what you're going to face? Dress me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm closing with this. Said, "Open up your mind. Open up that mind." He said, "That's the battleground. There's where the battle sets in array right there in the front line. your mind. Open it up and say, "Every doubt &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts." &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. Every doubt, &gt;&gt; doubt, &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm doubting my doubts now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm believing God's word. &gt;&gt; Here I come, Satan. &gt;&gt; Something's going to take place. &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts. &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother B talk to the devil. You can talk to him. &gt;&gt; Hey, Satan, I'm putting you on notice. &gt;&gt; I've doubted my doubts. &gt;&gt; I've doubted them now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And something's going to take place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing if we can have the musicians, please. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Would you pray with me? Oh God, my heart jumps with rejoicing. Lord, I just cannot escape this sense and this feeling because how the enemy has tried everything and it's failed. And we can point our finger at him and say, "You're a failure. You tried to trip me up. You're a failure. I came through. &gt;&gt; You brought all hell against me. I came through by the power of God. &gt;&gt; I've been equipped. &gt;&gt; I've been dressed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been prepared. And nothing can nothing can defeat this bride. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Father, I ask that you bless this people. We know that we'll face battles. We'll know we'll have great obstacles. But we thank you for the opportunity of proving that you're victorious once again. &gt;&gt; You've never known a defeat. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How we thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. You might wonder just why I'm lingering a wee bit. I'm doing it for my own benefit as God has been dealing with me since last night. And and I I I I made a series of notes, several pages which I mentioned earlier, but my mind is just being captivated by this great plan of God trying to trying to grasp the depths of it. It is so incredible. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to uh sing in a moment uh victory number 32 in the in the book and then and then for you that can be ready up there I want to sing also victory 751 the song um a statement that really. Can you just be alert for a moment? &gt;&gt; A statement that really kind of stunned me last night. [Music] And a prophet said this word, "You became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted." This was in the great plan of God. You came from the attribute. You each one of us are actually an attribute of God. Not not just a thought. Now because he said a thought is an attribute but you came from the attribute. Whatever God had in his mind the attribute would speak of a whole unit, a whole entity. And you came from that. And I began to think of this natural birth that we had and so many things. I'm going to take a just I'm just take a moment. This will help me out. Is that all right? You like to help me? Lucifer said, "I will ascend." God said, "I will descend." And they met in Eden. [Music] And two seeds were in Eve at one time. [Music] One would be a murderer and the other is actually the attribute of Adam who was the attribute of God. And as soon as they issue out in the world, they both have minds. And the prophet said that the mind was selected as the battleground. And in the one he contrived away, I will kill this one. So he tried to slay that attribute. You know what this is? This is the commencement and the beginning of redemption, the plan of redemption. And this is a great warfare taking place between the two. And the one is killed and God replaces him. I'm going to just go quickly. And then we have the same thing with Esau and Jacob in the same womb. in the same womb is one that God hates and he's evil and one that God loves. And they both come out into the world. And then I want to just go quickly to Calvary. Brother Brandham said to me, and I it means more at this very moment just now. He said, "Everyone thinks there were three at Calvary that died, but he said there were four." And he said, "Jesus." and he took one thief to heaven and the son of predition Judas and he took one to hell. So there's always been twins and here they were now on earth at the same time. Son of God, son of predition at the same moment. And they hung Jesus on a tree. But they didn't hang Jesus on the tree. He said, "I I lay it down. I go." So he went and essentially gave himself to be hung. And Judas, he went and hung himself on a tree. The Bible says Matthew 27. And I begin to see this great conflict taking place. God and Satan on the earth. And I had to I had to just get this out. I'm just at the very beginning. And that's where I'm going to kind of leave it. See that? That's why God even would become a living cell in the womb of a woman and burst forth in childbirth because he came, he descended and descended to that place because that's what his enemy did in Eden. And one was a creator and one was a perverter. And those two lives came along right here today. Both of those forces, just those two forces. And one is a doubter and a unbeliever of God's word. And the other was not only a believer of the word, but the word himself. And you have been called. &gt;&gt; That's the one that came and stood on the platform. That's the one that revealed the secrets of the heart. That's the one that called you and has has has has almost negated your natural birth and has brought you from the attribute to the flesh. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To be tempted and to allow his word here, get get it, please. I'm finishing to allow his word, the word that has been doubted through centuries by those that would be doubting. But this is what separates the this what separates his children from the others. Not a bunch of good deeds. Nothing to do with that. The separation is that one believed what he said. &gt;&gt; One loved what he said &gt;&gt; and that was his children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're here in the womb of the earth, &gt;&gt; the same womb. And here's a great struggle. But there's a group of people. And I trust. I know. That's why you're here. That's why I'm here. I want to say to the people, I want to say to the internet, I want to say to you that come here to church. I'm only here for one reason. To attest to this one testimony. I believe that word that came not just out of here, but we want to have it. Indeed, &gt;&gt; not a not a lip service, but indeed. We believe it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I want to assure you friends, you have a victory sir. &gt;&gt; You are assured victory &gt;&gt; because God has assigned conquering a conquering power to this word and it will never &gt;&gt; never be defeated. &gt;&gt; It's not just songs about the blood and songs about that, but this word &gt;&gt; if I can emphasize it. This word which he vindicated and vindicated and proved it and proven it. over and over again. He did that so that we would be assured. I will never leave it. &gt;&gt; We say I'll never leave you nor forsake you. That's fine. That's part. But it's not us in this natural that he's so in love with. But he's in love with those who have loved his word. And we've embraced his word. We've embraced Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] And he's prepared a place for us. Amen. Oh, victory in Jesus. V. No. Victory. Victory. The one we had over 32. 32, please. Victory. Victory. Let's all stand over all the powers of darkness. When the battles go in the rain, angels help us in the rain. And God fights for those who pray. Victory. Oh, victory. Victory over all the power of darkness. Victory. When the battles in array, he will help us to see the praise and God fights for those who pray. Victory. And then I like to sing this other song also that we had victory hallelujah. What a thought Jesus full salvation brought. How many know that? Everybody knows it. All right, you sing it with us. Hallelujah. What I thought Jesus for salvation brought victory. Victory. Let the power This can never fail. Victory. Victory. Victory. [Applause] [Music] Victory. Hallelujah. I am glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. It all I am trusting in the I vtory. Victory I have since my life is s victory. Victory victory. Yes. Hallelujah. [Music] Jesus gives me victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is all shout your freedom. His eternal peace. Declare victory. Victory. Let us [Music] in the face of every victory. Victory. Victory. We will sing it on this life. Victory. Victory. Victory. [Music] Victory. Victory. Hallelujah. I am free. Glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. He is all. You believe in victory? &gt;&gt; Amen. You might say, "Brother Ed, why do you put so much emphasis?" Because as time goes on, I see less emphasis put on the messenger. And the message of this congregation, as long as I have strength, will be emphasis on that vindicated voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've heard from our wedding garment friends. &gt;&gt; You've been dressed &gt;&gt; and blessed. Could we sing also? We have the power in the name of Jesus, please. We have the power in the name. We have the power in the name of the Lord. [Music] Power in the name of the Lord. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, we cannot be.

We're going to sing the chorus again. I want you to shake hands with somebody and listen. If anything happened to you, seriously, they'd be praying for you right now. They'd lay hands on you in a in a moment and you might sit right across from them. I sent a message to somebody the other day. I said, "You tell that brother, I'm going to ask the Lord to have him sit right next to me at the marriage supper." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you got somebody you know he's a believer that doesn't want to come over my house, but I'm going to pray that God makes him sit right next to me at the marriage supper. Wouldn't that be something? Wow, look who's there. Well, we might as well shake hands with one another as we sing the chorus once again. Greet one another. Seriously, a member of the bride of Jesus Christ. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] name of the Lord and ramen.
