We don't want to go arbitrarily, but we want to go with faith, believing that there's a resurrection. There's a rapture that's coming upon the earth that will catch your waiting bride away. Lord, our hearts are in great expectation. Even as the day approaches, we see the signs upon the earth. We see the signs in your word. Your word has been fulfilled. You've sent a prophet messenger in this day, Lord, to alert us, to bring attention to your word. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to sit attentive this morning as you would minister to us once again. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask now for this offering that it would be received, Lord, and used to its intended purpose to further the gospel of Jesus Christ. We commit it to you this morning. Each and everyone that's gathered in your divine presence, we commit to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats this morning. [Music] Sister Elena and Sister Elizabeth, Brother Ryan have a special. I feel bad kind of pulling on Ryan to ask him to sing, but we appreciate it. Brother Ryan, maybe we can just sing a verse and chorus to the old rugged cross. God's grace is sufficient for us. Amen. On a hill far away, there stood an old rugged cross. It's the emblem of suffering and shame. And I love that old cross. Oh, where the dearest and best for a world of lost s. So I cherish the old cross till my soul. At last night I will cling I will sing to the old rugged cross [Music] and exchange it a faith for a crown in the old cross with love so divine. It's so wonder I see. Lord was all that Jesus and died. to pardon and sanctify me. Oh my god. There I will sing to the night before every single [Music] [Music] in and out of situations. [Music] That tug of war at me. All day long I struggle for the answers that I need. Then I come into his presence [Music] and all my questions become clear. And for that sacred moment, [Music] no doubt can interfere [Music] in the presence [Music] of Jehovah God all mighty. [Music] Prince of peace, trles manage, [Music] hearts are men [Music] in the presence [Music] of the king. Through his love, the Lord provided [Music] a place for us to rest.

He will surely meet you there in the presence of Jehovah. God Almighty, [Music] prince of peace, trles, [Music] hearts are men [Music] in the rain. presence of the king in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. Mighty grace of peace. Trles.

God Almighty, [Music] [Applause] prince of peace of peace, trarted. &gt;&gt; This is a present. [Music] I in the presence [Music] of your [Music] Trouble is heart. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? While we have you standing, uh, I want to, uh, make mention, some of you may know, but our brother Neil Neil Gunther from Saskatchewan, pastor, passed away this morning, 91 years old. Truly, one of the soldiers. &gt;&gt; And uh, we're going to have uh, we're going to have prayer about hearts are mended. Uh some hearts have to be mended, but we're rejoicing. The last song that our brother uh brother Derek had you sing was uh will exchange the cross for a crown. He exchanged it. &gt;&gt; He exchanged it this morning. About 517. He passed away this morning. Uh uh brother uh brother Nathan Hildebrand, I'm going to have you come down if you wouldn't mind and we're going to have prayer in a few moments. Brother Nathan, I asked I want to have him come down because he was a young person in the church when brother Gunther was pastoring and uh we were there many times. You know, there's a supernatural realm we want to be conscious of. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh it's just a supernatural realm. Friends, let's not be here just for a Sunday morning service, but be mindful of the supernatural realm that's so very, very close. Uh brother Kelly Hilderbrand, is he related to you somehow? Yeah, they're all related. And uh brother Kelly Helerbrand became pastor of the church that brother Gunther had pastored previously. And so he invited brother uh Ron Spencer to come and speak. And brother Ron Spencer had an accident and was in the flames of fire and had his lungs largely burnt out and was laying unconscious in the hospital. So, Brother Kelly Hildibbran asked if brother Tom Ray could come and and fill in and take the services. So, Brother Tom and Joanne went over there. And I don't think I'm speaking out of line. Uh and and while Joanne is in the church sitting in the pew, God speaks to her about her son Joel who's here and and and he's he's not serving God. He's from God. And God speaks a scripture to her, chastise thy son. And she knew that she must correct him and went home with that on her heart. In the meantime, not the same day or the even the same weekend, but right at that same time, Saturday morning on a Saturday morning, I'm preparing uh the service to come and preach here. And while I am preparing and I'm looking at my screen, the tele over and I'm studying and it just come to me. The Holy Spirit just said, "Phone Connie, Sister Spencer." And I I immediately my mind said, "Well, she's not home cuz her husband's unconscious in the hospital." And nevertheless, it was just like I was under a power. And I just turned sideways and I started to dial. And while I'm dialing the phone, here's where you get the separation between the the mind of God and the Holy Spirit in your spirit. My mind is saying she's not home even while I'm dialing. She's not home. And my mind is agreeing with me. I said, "No, she's not home." And I still keep dialing because I couldn't do anything else. I kept dialing and I'm saying to myself, "No, she's not home. This is this is futile. There's not going to be any answer." And I had looked up the phone number and the only phone number I had was their home. And I'm dialing and said, "She's not home." And I'm saying, "No, she's not home." And uh the phone just rings maybe once or twice and she answers the phone and I just say to her just like this. I said, "Connie, where are you?" And she says, "Well, Brother Biscll, I'm just between hospitals. I just left my son." I didn't have any idea. I knew nothing about wasn't thinking about our son, Jason. He was in one hospital and brother Ron was in another. and she said, "I'm just between hospitals and uh I left Jason. I'm just on my way to see Ron." And I knew I knew Brother Ron's condition. I said, "Sister Connie, we've just bought a camp, Mount Baker camp." And I said, I understand from the medical people that the last of the human senses that leave the body is the hearing. I said, I want you to go beside Ron's bed and get down and and speak in his ear and tell him that I, Brother Biscll, has called and that he's going to be the preacher at camp next year. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she said, "I'll do that, Brother Biscll." And Brother Ron Spencer was the speaker at the camp the next year. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, friends, there's a there's another realm. There's a whole another dimension. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm saying that because it kind of leads into my service. I want to remember brother Gunther's uh brother Gunther's son Milton is uh is is not well either with a he has a brain tumor and I don't know his condition as of this moment but brother brother Nathan I wonder if you would I'd like you to just if you wish to just say a word about being in his church but uh if you would have prayer for the family the extended family and all the saints that are affected in Saskatchewan and elsewhere. Brother Gunther to me is one of the great heroes uh great heroes of the faith. He just remembered remained absolutely steadfast. Can I tell you one more? &gt;&gt; I was to speak at brother Gunther's church in Edmonton and at brother's church in Saskatchewan and we had the radio broadcast on. They It's not my broadcast. It's not it's not this church's broadcast. It's broadcasting the messengergers's message. &gt;&gt; Whose word is that? &gt;&gt; Not my word. It's God's word. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, Brother Roger, God bless him, he he just walked in just before I left and he said, "We're we got our invoice to pay for the radio time. We're on about 25 stations." He said, 'We haven't got the money to pay for it. And I said, 'Well, that's the first time ever and once. It only happened once, and that's the time it happened. He said, well, we're short about I said, how much are we short? He said, about $5,000. That's a lot of money back then. A lot of money yet. And I said, well, wait till I get back. We won't do anything till I get back. And uh I went up to Edmonton, spoke at brother Harold Hildebrand's went over to brother Gunther's and I was uh I was with brother and sister Gunther and went to the church and he always goes early and I'm sitting down in his little office and we sat there for just a few minutes. He said, "I'll just go to the pulpit." I said, "Okay." And he left and went out the door. of the pulpit was right beside the little office and he just was out for maybe uh one minute and I was just uh at turned to my Bible and was at the little desk and he came back in an envelope uh a long envelope like this and he said a brother here and he gave his name he said he just gave this to me to give to you and I said oh okay he said do you know this brother and I said I'm trying to think of who he was and I said, "I think he does he he said he sits right down in the front." I said, "Oh, yes." Yeah. I said, "I I just know him to see him." And so I put it in my pocket and I thought I didn't want to have anything disturb me and I'm just going to give myself to the word. And so while I was thinking, I thought it might be a request. And so I slipped it out of my pocket and just tore it open and and and just pulled it out as a check. says on the bottom for radio $5,000. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hearts are mended. Burdens are carried. You believe it? &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; I want believing hearts here today. Brother Nathan, just come and lead us in prayer, would you? We're happy to have our brother Eric and Sister Diane Kourtney here. That is Rebecca Ray's mother and dad. God bless you, brother Eric, sister. And and uh also we want to remember brother Jean Chimpaka. He's in Burkino Faso and they set up just this last week set up the first print station for the from the hub and instructed the brothers and some other visiting ministers and they preached and they printed the first prophet's message as I was with Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We can't maybe run down the shopping center and say, "Praise the Lord." But we can hear praise the Lord. Brother Murphy's up there. Isn't it wonderful? He's back. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. [Applause] We'll just ask prayer. Let's just pray together. Lord Jesus, [Music] &gt;&gt; we're so thankful, Lord, that you are faithful to the end &gt;&gt; and that you carried our burdens, &gt;&gt; to Calvary. &gt;&gt; You laid your life down willingly as a &gt;&gt; as a lamb. They didn't have to throw you down onto the cross, but you laid yourself down, stretched out your hands [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord. So You gave your life so we could live. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful this morning that &gt;&gt; brother Gunther is live so faithful to your word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as I heard the prophet this week speak of his mother when she was passing and he stood at her bedside, &gt;&gt; she said, "Bill, &gt;&gt; this is when it pays off." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I've stayed true. &gt;&gt; You led me to the waters of baptism and I've stayed true to that word. &gt;&gt; And here's where it pays off. [Applause] [Music] I'm so thankful, oh Lord Jesus, that brother Gunther recognized this day and its message. &gt;&gt; And he stood for you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He preached your word, oh God, &gt;&gt; he did what he could, Father. And now when he come to the river, oh God, &gt;&gt; you helped him across and he's over on the other side. &gt;&gt; Rejoicing with his wife who has gone before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rejoicing with saints that have gone before. Lord, &gt;&gt; in the eternal youth, Lord, &gt;&gt; in the place that you have prepared for him, oh God, &gt;&gt; we rejoice in that this morning, Lord. And if he could if he could speak back to us, he would say, "Don't let anything come in between you and the Savior. &gt;&gt; Stay true. Stay steadfast. Endure to the end." &gt;&gt; So we that remain, oh God, we endure. [Music] &gt;&gt; We press on, Lord. &gt;&gt; We spread your word, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh God. We love you, Father. &gt;&gt; We love your precious word. &gt;&gt; We love your presence, oh God. &gt;&gt; Be with those, Lord. Be with our brother Milton. Father, Brother Gunther's son, Lord, you know his need, Father. Oh Lord Jesus, touch him now, oh God, I pray, heal him, Lord Jesus, and raise him up off the bed of affliction, Father. Oh, be merciful, oh God. Bless the family, Lord. Bless the church over there, oh God. Strengthen everyone, Father. Encourage them, Lord. We lift them up, Lord, as brothers and sisters of like precious faith. Oh God, we lift them up into your presence by prayer this morning, oh God, and pray that you would pour in grace, Lord. Be with us here this morning, Father. Bless our brother, Lord, our brother Episcopal as he would break to us the bread of life. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, anoint him. Anoint our ears to hear, our hearts to receive, oh God. We focus our attention now on what you have to say to us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we have come to hear from you, Father. We have come to feast at your table, to feed upon your word, oh God, to be energized by your Holy Spirit, Lord, to be quickened by your presence, oh God, to be filled with your Holy Spirit, Lord, to be filled with revelation, oh God. You alone are what we need, Father. And we come to you the great fountain of life, oh God, to draw from you, Lord. There's many needs here to this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; You are the supplier of all of our needs, Lord. And let your word go forth and heal your people this morning. Father, speak to us, we pray, oh God. Have your precious way, oh Lord Jesus. We ask this in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And we give you all the glory and the honor and the praise, Lord. And we bless your holy name. in Jesus name I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, nice to see you. Missed you and sister Yolena. And just happy to have you back. Amen. That'll be all for the singing and music. Now, you're not too weary. &gt;&gt; Take your Bibles and we'll turn to Acts the 1st chapter. We want to also be remembering the brother Kim Dingwal and uh and those that are with him and the whole busload of young people making their way on down to Louisiana. Eventually, he'll end up there and brother John Andy's will be down there speaking the youth convention and uh they they seek to be a blessing and maybe help out in the church. So, we pray that God protect and guide them, keep them. I I did get a text from brother uh Kim, and he said that they're having fellowship and worshiping all along the way. Amen. Acts the first chapter. I'm going to begin reading at the fourth verse. And you'll have to if if you wish to pray, pray for yourself and pray that God will give you personal understanding because I'm speaking something that's very very difficult to uh for us as humans to look beyond our you know we have tunnel vision inherent tunnel vision and we need to look beyond our little world and beyond ond our conditions &gt;&gt; and which we are so affected and afflicted and plagued by. Uh so I'm praying that God will help me and help you to uh to follow what God speaks in the scripture. Help us. &gt;&gt; Fourth verse. and being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart, Jesus is speaking now, from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father, which saith he, you have heard of me. &gt;&gt; And we want to be remember now for all of you that may not know the resurrection has just taken place. And this between the resurrection and Pentecost and so that you don't put yourself there. The resurrection just happened. &gt;&gt; They've just received the Lord Jesus Christ raised from the dead after all the suffering in his passion. &gt;&gt; And uh for John, he said, truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence. When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power. But you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. God bless this word of your heart. And thank you for standing. You may be seated. My thought is uh right here in the content of the scripture and then I'm going to give several other examples as we go on. Uh their concern was, "Will you at this time restore the king?" Now, he just raised from the dead. They seeing resurrected life right in front of them. "Will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? Their their concern was local. Their concern was with their problem. We've been under this Roman hand. Oh, will you at this time shake it off and are you going to restore it back in our old glory and we're going to have Israel restored back and have our nation back again? Is this the time? Because nothing seeming could stop or hinder someone that could walk walk out of a sephilar. And he said, "It's not for you to know the times of the seasons that the father hath put in his own hand, in his own power, but you shall receive power. After that, the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem locally and in all Judea and the far regions, &gt;&gt; maybe Seattle and Victoria and down Louisiana and who knows and Texas or whatever more. and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And the uttermost part of the earth is can be the last state or the last end. The not necessarily the furthest point, but the extreme, the last in time or the last in place you'll receive. And and we're a long ways down the road. We're a long ways down the road. And Jesus is speaking about us and saying, "But you shall receive power and you be witnesses unto me locally, but beyond that in Judea, all of Judea and in Samaria, where he had told them earlier, don't go and and and to the uttermost part of the earth, right to the very extreme end of all things, but you'll be witnesses unto me." Glory. &gt;&gt; Some will go to Jerusalem and some will go to Judea. This is not a missionary service. Jesus is not saying some of you'll be missionaries and some of you'll be pastors and some of you will be whatever evangelists. And this is not a competition of who gets to the most remote place on earth. &gt;&gt; It's not some kind of competition. This is where the Holy Ghost will take the message to the ends of the earth through the zeal of God in the bride body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In other words, whatever they become infused with, you'll become infused with. There's no limitation and there's no uh the the the strength of and the potency of the words of Jesus Christ do not diminish as time goes on. &gt;&gt; Sometime we may say something but it it kind of fritters away and dwindles away. It doesn't dwindle away. &gt;&gt; You shall receive power &gt;&gt; after that. The Holy Ghost has come upon you and it shall come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me. You'll be witnesses unto me. Didn't say you will all go to church and you'll all fellowship and you'll sing songs and you'll do these things, but you'll be witnesses unto me. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, how? I'm not a preacher. I'm not this." That has nothing to do with it. He didn't say you'll become preachers and you'll become witnesses. You'll become witnesses &gt;&gt; unto me. Your life will witness. &gt;&gt; That's right. And there's very much uh it's very very human as I said just in the opening phrase to have tunnel vision &gt;&gt; because we see those of our uh family and those of our church and those of our you know my friends, my associates, &gt;&gt; uh those that mean something to me those that maybe are of the same culture. This has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Are these that speak the same language &gt;&gt; or somehow, you know, we have some connection. This hasn't got anything about connection. This has this has to do with you believing on Christ. You shall be baptized. You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost. That's God's doing. That's not well I want to feel something. Has nothing to do with what you want to feel. You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost and you shall be a witness. Well, some may be demonstrative and some may not be demonstrative. Some may be loud and some may be quiet and some may be something else. Something may some may be withdrawn. Some may have some complexes and some may be, you know, bulldog faith or something. whatever it has nothing to do with that. It has to do with you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost and you shall be witnesses. Well, you might say, "Well, I don't know how." Well, how will I be w That's not your problem. &gt;&gt; Your problem is you believe and he does the work. He will make you to be witnesses. Something in your life will witness. You might say, "Well, I don't see the effect of it." That isn't what that isn't in the that isn't in the in in the recipe here. You shall be witnesses. &gt;&gt; Now, there's one one one thing that is essential is to see beyond Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and to see beyond all of Judea &gt;&gt; and to see beyond Samaria &gt;&gt; and to see even to the uttermost part of the earth. And this calls for something that is very difficult for us as humans to do and that is to lift up our eyes. &gt;&gt; And uh I was very very affected this morning because when I heard that brother Gunther had passed away, I spoke I'm trying to remember and I'll have to go back and refresh my memory whether I spoke Sister Gunther's funeral. I did speak Sister Rosenkei's funeral who they're very dear friends. I spoke Sister Rosenkeis and one of those two services I spoke from dust to stars and I'm referring to the same scripture this morning. The first time I will come to it a little bit later but just to get you in the in the in the thought pattern. The first time uh Abram was is like you you know he had the concerns of life and and the prophet said he had to God spoke to him said leave your family leave your kindred and he's he he he's leaving he's trudging along like you would have to he's packing up and he's moving and he's got all the problems of uh of the logistics of camels or horses or donkeys or whatever it is, he's got to pack his stuff up &gt;&gt; and he's leaving his comfort zone. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he's leaving his friends. &gt;&gt; He's leaving his family. That's not easy. &gt;&gt; You know, he he he's he's got the same feelings we would have. Leave them and to a place and go to a place I'll show you. And maybe his friends are saying, "Well, where are you going?" Well, I don't really know. Oh, wow. You know, you mean you're leaving your father and you're leaving all of this and you're going to a place and you don't even know? Well, God appeared to me and spoke to me. Yeah. You know how that would rate. You know how people would think about that. &gt;&gt; In fact, this when I came to move here to Cloverdale, I didn't know I was coming to Cloverdale. I just knew I was coming west and president of our company asked me what I was going to do. I said, "I I really don't know." and and his his respect for me just took a nose dive right there. I could see it in his face, see it in his eyes, see it in everything. And I would imagine Abram and that that wasn't the only thing. Then Abram, God told him, he said, he said, "I'm I'm going to I'm going to bless you and I'm going to bless the nations of the world because of you." Yeah. &gt;&gt; This one man doesn't even know where he's going. And God's telling him, "I'm going to bless you and I'm going to bless the nations of the world and and and uh I'm going to bless your seed &gt;&gt; seed. I don't even have a child. &gt;&gt; Bless my seed." And uh and so he he begins his journey and and God speaks to him at one time when they have he has a lot of trouble between him and Lot. his nephew is coming and between Lot's their herds increased and Lot's servants and Abram's servants they're having strife between themselves and it finally you know drifts down to the people that have to make the decision. And so it's between Lot and and now comes a very very difficult thing. So Abram says to Lot uh oh I don't know what to do. uh you know he doesn't say that but obviously he doesn't know what to do. So he says uh you you choose you whatever way you choose let's not have this strife. You choose you can see Abram's manner. You choose one direction I'll go the other direction. If you choose this right hand I'll go the left hand or whatever whatever you choose I'll go the opposite way. And Lot he sees the wellwatered plains of towards Sodom and so on so forth. So he he he said uh he'd take the well-watered plains and Abraham said, "Fine, I'll go the other direction." So now they've parted and they've just parted. Put it in your own life. Some of the most difficult times, some of the most painful times. And God spoke to him and said, "I'm going to bless you. And if you can count the sand &gt;&gt; at the seashore, &gt;&gt; uh, so will your seed will be. So he has them. He's still looking down. You might think this is poetic. It's not very poetic because we are, we spend most of our time looking down. In fact is when you go into a department store, I used to paint signs and not professionally but just paint signs. And they said don't put the signs above eye level. Very few people look above their eye level. &gt;&gt; And I've had people come in and look at a sign says, "Take 40% off." And they'll stare right at that sign. They say, "Uh, how much discount is this?" Uh, that sign says 40%. Take it off. But when you drive down the if you drive down the street, and some of you will do it this week, I'm sure you'll drive down the street and and don't have a wreck now. But just look above the windows of the of the of the of the stores above the windows. It's a whole new city up there cuz you've never looked up there. You'll see all the He said, "What a wretched place." No, it's always been that way. But you just never looked up there. You see all the window dressing and everything is fixed up here. Say, uh, now now how how does this relate to our spiritual life? The thing that wars against you spiritually is every little thing that happens that bugs you. &gt;&gt; It just bothers you. What bothers you? Oh, it's this and that and something else here and you know what I mean? It's all this local stuff around here and it's all these things. And so the second time God speaks to Abram, he speaks to him again way further down. And and Abram has just finished saying, "What will you give me?" Doesn't that sound familiar? I need this and I need that. What will you give me? I don't have a son. I don't have an heir. The only one I have here is is this uh Syrian from Damascus, Eleazar. He's the only one as I have as a heir. That's a big problem. God's already given him. And he says, he says, "This will not be your heir. I will give you an heir and it'll come out of your own lines. &gt;&gt; It's going to be your son." God preaches him a sermon. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I looked at it last night and the sermon takes just a few minutes. It's a whole lot shorter than my sermon this morning. But God, I thought, "What a wonderful preacher. What a wonderful preacher." I'm going to tell you the same thing I told you years ago, about 22 years ago. It hasn't changed. I'm going to tell you the same story. You're gonna have a son. You're gonna have seed. And it says, "And he believed God and was counted to him for righteousness." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it just goes to show the human nature and I'm going to dwell on that. And and you happen to have it. You're sitting here listening to me. But you and I have the same and I had a hard time with this service. I thought I can't hardly do that myself. I'm pro I'm plagued every day with the daily things and the pressures of life and I can't and and God is speaking to my own heart saying well I want you to lift up your eyes. And the second time, God spoke to him and said, "Now, lift up your eyes," he said to Abram, "and look to the stars and see if you can count them." And that's the way your seed's going to be. And that is the most impossible thing. Hasn't even had a child yet. And he says, "And he believed God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God blessed him. [Music] We're called on to believe things that are so outrageous &gt;&gt; and so phenomenal &gt;&gt; and so unbelievable &gt;&gt; that these bodies as as corrupt as they are are going to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That these bodies and this nature is going to be transformed. &gt;&gt; But there's something that we have to do. You have to believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to believe that. You're called on to believe that. &gt;&gt; He He didn't point out his weaknesses to him. Abraham, you uh you know, you're told something that wasn't really quite right back there. And for that, you know, I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and you're you're going to get less. That isn't the point. He never pointed that out to him. &gt;&gt; He never preached to him about his failings. He never preached to him about his weaknesses. &gt;&gt; He preached to him about what he had said had. &gt;&gt; This is what this says &gt;&gt; and this is what he means &gt;&gt; and this is the way it's going to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, and and there similarities. Now, I want to just show you similarities. And excuse me while I lay all this long foundation but in the life of Jesus and the ministry and I want to speak about his first and his second ministry because the ministry that we talk about brother Brown's ministry is a ministry of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; working and revealing himself in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jesus in his first in his first visitation here on earth, when he when he commences his ministry, he's talking about social things, you know, life &gt;&gt; and how they should live in the sermon on the mount and you read it and you say, well, and and he teaches about how we should conduct ourselves and how we should live and all of those social things. But then when he when he goes further on in his ministry, he starts he starts uh instructing the people to look beyond that and uh you've got to lift up your eyes and he starts talking about him suffering and raising again from the dead. They didn't have any idea what he was talking about. Right. &gt;&gt; The Bible even says that after it happened, then they remembered what he'd said. &gt;&gt; It's almost, you'd think it might be too late, but no. God's got everything in time. &gt;&gt; I hope that you're understanding what I'm saying. So, he's trying to get them to look beyond look beyond this. Look beyond Jerusalem. Look beyond your own house. Look beyond your own life. Look beyond your own friends. Look beyond your own church. Look beyond your own culture. Look beyond beyond the things that's happening. Look beyond your own government. Look beyond your own city. Look beyond that. &gt;&gt; In fact is I'm going to load one on you that I don't think you can do and I don't think I can do. And that is that we need to be able to look at one another who are bloodbought and see them as stars. Yes. &gt;&gt; They say they got stars in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; I tell you, they got the worst renegades. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even You wouldn't even want them as your neighbor. &gt;&gt; They're not stars. &gt;&gt; If they are, they're fallen stars. &gt;&gt; And I'm not here to preach about that. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about that. But I'm talking about true stars. &gt;&gt; And the prophet talks about stars. He said, "Mother's up there." &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be something if God had a star that identifies you? &gt;&gt; How would it be? How how how can h how can we look at one another? And the reason I'm saying this, you might say, "Well, that would be nice if we could do that." That's not the point. I really believe it's a requirement before the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; How can the foot say to the hand or the hand say to the foot, "I have no need of you." &gt;&gt; How can one part of the body say to the other part, "I have no need of you." &gt;&gt; And what if the other part of the body could be husband or wife, it could be children, it could be young people, it could be parents, it could be ministry, it could be deacons, it could be someone else. I I I wonder if we just have enough uh h enough esteem, not respect, esteem to to see the glory of say, well, you look at stars. This may sound so poetic, but it's far beyond that &gt;&gt; that we could see one another as they truly are. Is there anything wrong with me preaching today that we should look upon one another as God looks upon you're my father, oh father in heaven, and so on and so forth. And maybe he's saying, why don't you look upon your neighbor or look upon your brother or look upon the one that's sitting beside you. Look upon members of your family like I see them. &gt;&gt; Would there be anything wrong with that? No. &gt;&gt; Would there anything wrong with me preaching that we should look upon one another as God looks upon them? &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't really stand that person. I don't have anything in common with them." And God is saying, God is saying just in the other dimension, "That's my daughter." &gt;&gt; You're saying, "I can't stand them." And God's saying, "That's my son." That's right. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I love you and I give myself for you. And and we stand on this side of the veil and say, I just can't stand that person. We don't have anything in common. They kind of rip me off. I'm going to preach it. You'll understand it as we get along. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus in his uh in his earthly ministry he said in his earthly ministry he began with the local concerns and then he says he sent out his disciples and he says but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel to the the the gospel was to the to the nation. Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And then in Jeremiah, God had spoken and said, "My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have caused them to go astray. &gt;&gt; They have turned them away on the mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill. They have forgotten their resting place." &gt;&gt; But as Jesus moved toward his ultimate purpose in life, to be the sacrifice for the sins of the world, listen friends. this was they thought maybe this is our Messiah. This is who we've looked for. Will you at this time restore the kingdom? But as Jesus is moving towards redemption, &gt;&gt; towards not just suffering at Calvary, but in God's mind going to redeem the world. &gt;&gt; Now, it became a world event. It became a a a an an event that encompassed the globe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they couldn't encompass it in their mind. They couldn't say it in their mind. It was it was me and Andrew and Peter and John and they had words amongst themselves. Hello folks. &gt;&gt; They had words. They had they had feelings. They debated about who was going to be the greatest in the kingdom. then isn't it? &gt;&gt; Say amen if that's true. &gt;&gt; Who's going to be greatest in the kingdom? And and one is more eloquent than the other and and uh uh uh he he he's never mentioned me. I'm not he never even mentioned me in the Bible. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of the 12, but I've never been mentioned. I'm not I'm not very much I'm not very visible. I'm kind of the invisible disciple. Isn't it amazing? &gt;&gt; Isn't it really amazing? But is that disciple any less than the other disciple? Is are they any less than Peter or Paul or some of the other disciples? No. and and we say, "Well, I'm I'm looking way back then, but now we're talking about we're talking about we're talking about very very marvelous things. We're talking about rapture. We're talking about being caught away. We're talking about crossing over." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as Jesus moved toward his ultimate purpose in life to be the sacrifice for the sins of the world, his disciples could not comprehend that this ministry would encompass the world. And when God began to manifest and unfold in Jesus his plan and purpose in the death of Jesus Christ to be the author of eternal life, they were incapable to grasp such majestic truth. &gt;&gt; I want to come to the first phase of brother Brown's ministry. Brother Bram's ministry we call it commonly first pole and the second pole and the third pull and then the first pull he speaks even refers to it later on where we're going to be here in this some of these cities going out and we're going to be doing some evangelistic and it won't be preaching messages like we preach here at the tabernacle. We'll be preaching kind of, you know, lighter evangelistic type services. what it's to the people that are there at that time and we're we're going to be speaking to them and and he says uh in in 1962 he said in the message the absolute and I remember when he swept down there in that big light standing yonder at the bottom of the river 1933 in June when he said as John the Baptist was sent to forerrun uh sent forth to forerrun the first coming of Christ. I send you with a message to the world to forerrun the second coming of Christ. Now, we we get it all wrapped up about this message coming to me. It's got to go a long ways beyond you. &gt;&gt; It's got to go a long ways beyond I'm not just talking about geography now. I'm talking about what we see &gt;&gt; and our vision and how we relate to that vision. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to go a long ways. In other words, if we if we have our eyes down here, we'll just be looking at dust all the time. We see this and we see that and and I I I just can't, you know, deal with some things and and there life's difficult. And if we're going to look at dust, it's always going to be difficult. This dust is weak. &gt;&gt; This dust has is irritable. This dust has some weaknesses and frailties and it will always have it. &gt;&gt; And brother Brown talks about the sticky nature. It's not that we suddenly, you know, we just all become so wonderful and lovey and doy and gushy and so on so forth. Icky icky icky. I don't care for that anyway. Let us be the kind of people that God gave us molded by the Holy Spirit. So are you saying brother Bisl that we can be you know uh just run and bad? No, I'm not saying that. I'm not justifying that. But I am also saying that we have to have sufficient maturity to oversee to look beyond what what a person does or what they don't do or what they fail to do or or whatever it is. We need to look beyond that because if whatever you see is no excuse for you to pull back. Whatever you say, whatever you say in the church or in humanity or amongst Christians, it's no reason for us to blame God for it. &gt;&gt; God is the one that does. He's the one that does predestinate the person. He's the one that put the seed there. &gt;&gt; God did not make a mistake putting a predestinated seed in any believer. God didn't make any mistake. One might be quiet, one might be boisterous, one might be uh uh wiser, one might be smart, and one might be very very ignorant. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; God has not made any mistakes. [Music] &gt;&gt; I send you a message to the world. Not to Cloverdale, &gt;&gt; not to Seattle, not to Victoria, not to Reon, not to Jeffersonville only, &gt;&gt; to the world. &gt;&gt; He is a simple man, a humble man, a man of few words, and a man of poor grammar. He said so many times, "I can't preach like these men." He He admired those men that could get up and put their thoughts together. I do, too. put their thoughts together and and be so analytical in their mind. And I admire that. That's not the point. If you're called to say something, you're called to be a witness. &gt;&gt; Live it, &gt;&gt; speak it, &gt;&gt; be a witness. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we should not mar that. Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "And now I believe and now I believe she's ready to strike the final climax yonder to bring forth a faith that will rapture the church into glory." And she is laying in the messages. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's too late for me to uh to kind of, you know, just silk glove or kid glove things. You've got to say things the way they are. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks about Pentecost. He says, and he doesn't, these are not exact words, but I I was looking for the quote and now I have it. But he says uh Pentecost could not bring forth the rapture &gt;&gt; because they're too broken up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they're too broken up. &gt;&gt; Because they're too broken up. Say, "Well, why are you saying that to us this way?" because I have always believed I'm opposed. And brother Brandham says his ministry was to bring people together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. his ministry. It doesn't let you swallow up and have all kinds of worldliness and all kinds of nonsense and foolishness, but it is that there there's a difference between that and and having a having a appreciation a genuine appreciation for a bloodbought son and daughter of God. And if they don't meet your standards, so they don't meet your standards. But if they don't meet your standards, that doesn't mean that you push them off in the ditch. &gt;&gt; As long as they are sincerely and honestly and living a godly life and doing their best. I believe these are all essential things. I'm talking about doing their best, &gt;&gt; not just sloughing along, but doing their very best, being a godly believer, &gt;&gt; and believing and and and having respect for whether it be the deacons or the trustees or one another or your or your parents or your your children or whatever more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to make very many personal references because I feel in this area we all lack very very much. But I when I was when I was a young man with a family of teenage daughters and God began to just blow in like that and amongst the young people like hippies were kind of thing of the past and they were disenchanted. Of course, they went into the hippie movement because they were disenchanted with, you know, the material world and the plastic world and all of these things. There's been all kinds of movements when people became disenchanted with something. So they were disenchanted with that and they went into the hippie movement and they were just going to be happy happy hippies and you know travel around and go down to South America and go down to go over to Europe and traps around the country and and finally of course that runs out &gt;&gt; and money has a strange way of running out and so that runs out and and uh and and I've said here many times I've seen I saw painted on the rocks maybe going down I5 and great big rock and they'll say, "Jesus, help us now." And that always stabbed me in my heart. Every time it stabbed me. How many have seen that? Jesus, help us now. Raise your hands. My goodness. Some of you folks, nobody over here looks down on the side of the road. I I've still seen that sign. It's kind of getting a little worn, but I still see it. I hear it on the I5. They have one great big rock down there says, "Jesus, help us now." And the thing that stabbed me was, "I have what they need. &gt;&gt; I know what they need." And that was the crying out for that witness. So, how do we start that? How do we What do we do? Anything. Just anything. Oh, well, I like to be in a in a house and like to be together and like to be a coffee house. All right. Well, we're moving out of the house. Maybe we'll do that. I kept the house 5 months empty all through winter and had the pipes break from freezing and all the rest of it. Just an incredible thing. And the devil actually I I heard his voice speak to me. He said, "You're a fool, Biscll. You could have rented this place." And I just want to tell you, but I thought maybe these young people that wrote that, you know, Jesus help us now. I know who that Jesus is. &gt;&gt; That Jesus has sent a messenger. &gt;&gt; I've seen the manifestation of it, but I don't know how to get it out to them. I don't know how to let them know. I don't know who painted this, but I I I wanted to get it out. See, that's that's the difference between, you know, just riding along and not doing anything or having a desire to do something. &gt;&gt; Not a preacher. We didn't have a church. I wasn't preaching, but I just wanted to be a witness. &gt;&gt; So, I would go where they were gathered and talk to them or whatever I could do or hand them a track or give them a dollar or whatever I could do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham in a and uh I have a phrase here and you excuse me for just taking my time. This is unusual the way I'm speaking but he said here try to understand and I'm I want to come to that phrase and this is in the Easter Seal in 1965. He said look at the millions on earth that didn't receive it when Jesus was here &gt;&gt; but how thankful we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; And how thankful we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible proof &gt;&gt; that we are included in that great resurrection morning coming &gt;&gt; and great Easter. We have the earnest of it right now in our mortal bodies. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching. &gt;&gt; You should have to say that. &gt;&gt; I have the evidence. I have the earnest of this great resurrection &gt;&gt; right now, presently in my body. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wait till you can say that. &gt;&gt; I have &gt;&gt; the evidence, the earnest &gt;&gt; of it right now in our mortal bodies. He he goes on further to say and try to grasp this now. The pre predestinated ones are the first of course to be quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own. Now there's a now there's a great statement. I want I want my minister brothers to try to understand this. It's calling on ministers to try to understand this. I'm talking to you as a congregation, many of you, not ministers, wives, husbands, young people, but to try to under here's a prophet trying to get ministers to understand this. And now we'll see exactly what it is. In the beginning, God the great spirit, he wasn't even God then. He was the eternal one. &gt;&gt; But in order to be God, there had to be something to worship him. So he created angels. &gt;&gt; Are we all right thus far? &gt;&gt; But remember you in the stature that you are in this morning. You see this is coming. I I decided I wasn't going to just speak about things. We want to speak about individuals, about you as an individual. I'm too old to just speak generalities. We have to speak about you as an individual. He says, "But remember you in the stature that you are in this morning. If you wasn't in his thinking then, you're not now. for you. There's some part that's in you that's eternal and God only belong and that only belongs to God. It only belongs to God. &gt;&gt; If you were in God's thinking, &gt;&gt; you you you you need to be able to declare that with with a conviction. I was in God's thinking in the beginning. And the reason I know that is because there is something that is in me now that's pulsating. I don't even understand it sometime. Some simple little thing. You might say to me, "What what caused you to dial uh Sister Carne Spencer?" I have no idea. &gt;&gt; I don't have any idea. All I know is it did it and it works. &gt;&gt; How come you're sitting here? You can say this morning, how come I'm sitting in this church? What am I doing here? Something pulsated in you. &gt;&gt; Something registered in you someplace. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet, he talked about a series of things. He said, "We let the church and we let our job and we let this and we let other things get it out of us. &gt;&gt; Cloud it over." He says for you there's some part of that's in you that's eternal and eternal only belongs to God and in God was his thinking of you sitting right where you are Now, you know, it gets quiet because you're thinking, but we need to think and do a little bit more than think. We need to accept it somehow. And Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness. Abraham's problem was he didn't have a child. His wife says, "Go and take Hagar, and maybe she'll have a child on me." And he he he conceds and he has a child with Hagar. And and then and and then Hagar begins to begins to look down, cast down on her mistress, on Sarah, says, "You can't conceive. I've got a child. Your husband can't give you a child. He's given me a child." And you knew how that happened. And Hagar said, "I won't have this woman in my house." &gt;&gt; Well, it's she's in your hand. Abram says, "Do what you Well, she made it so hard." Hagar left. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord meets Hagar. &gt;&gt; The angel of God made her &gt;&gt; out by the well &gt;&gt; and said, "Go back." and bow yourself down under your mistress because and it God God when he's talking to Abraham and tell him look at the stars he wasn't saying well you know I know about all of that trouble he didn't dwell about that trouble because he's not interested in dust &gt;&gt; I'm preaching over your heads I'm preaching over my head I say if we don't regard that we got something next time we respond and speak I tell you this really been affecting me and affecting me in a very very real way and you know because life has its uh has its way of getting us into the vortex of things and and we get all kinds of things that I find these things that add pressure to life they take away from the joy and uh things of the uh uh the things of real eternal value. And I think that the Satan, this is what I personally think Satan uses this world. He has access. It's his kingdom. &gt;&gt; So he uses whatever he he needs to use. He can use the God of education. He can use the God of immigration. He use the God of economics. He can use the king of all of these different things. Put pressure on these people. Pressure on these people. and and uh and and then it's one thing to run out of money. It's another thing to run out of patience and another thing to run out of &gt;&gt; whatever whatever we need to continue in life. &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "Well, really, what are you preaching, Brother Bisc?" I'm saying, "Look up to the stars." &gt;&gt; Look at one another and see a star. &gt;&gt; See a celebrity of heaven. See a blood washed. &gt;&gt; Look through the blood. That's God. Your father looks through the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And in God was his thinking of you sitting right where you are." Now, I'm going to be real blunt. I either have to call brother Brandham a liar or the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he said that you were in God's thinking, &gt;&gt; sitting where you are right now, &gt;&gt; I happen to want to go on record and say I believe that. [Music] &gt;&gt; I just want to say I believe that. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You folks believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, I stood at the pulpit this morning. Here I am. and he stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and he knows all things. Therefore, he could tell the end from the beginning and because he's eternal. And you being a son of God or a daughter of God, then you were in his thinking at the beginning. You mean to tell me that I'm standing here behind this pulpit and the God who knew all things from the beginning to the end had you in his thinking before the beginning of the world and gives me the privilege to stand here the honor to stand here and speak to the purchase of God's elected people. &gt;&gt; That's more than my mind can grasp. But I have to say I believe that. And the more that we say I believe that it will change your attitude towards that person or towards the people or towards the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can I will tell you on authority, you just wait a few years and you'll see the wheels of God turn the way he intended them to turn. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because I do it or somebody else does it. I find the best rem the best recipe is to be godly. Serve God. Be a Christian every day. Live a rugged simple life. &gt;&gt; Before God and let God do the work and he will it he will certainly do the work. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes, please. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to talk about the ministry of the bride, and I have a little ways to go, but I'm going to go quickly as I can. In the token message, he said, "Now, the very spirit itself is the token. The Holy Spirit itself is the token, not the blood. The blood the blood was shed at Calvary. That is true. But the blood as far as it is went back into the elements from which it came from the from the food that he lived on. But you see inside that blood cell, I woke up and I thought so much about this. Inside that blood cell, &gt;&gt; inside that blood cell, was a life &gt;&gt; and that started that started the blood cell to moving the chemistry had no life in it. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going very slow. I want you to follow it. The chemistry, the blood, the paint, the blood had no life in it. It had no virtue in it. The the the chemistry had no life in it itself. And therefore it could not move. But when the life came into the chemistry of the blood, it formed a cell, it formed its own cell. Then cell after cell, then it became a man. And that man was God Emmanuel, his flesh in flesh. And when that life returned back, the chemistry went to it. But the token is the Holy Spirit upon the church that they see Christ. Now I I you need to perhaps read that and ponder. I've been pondering it very deep. The the the child in a mother begins to form and there's a there's a blood cell. There's a blood unit, blood cell, and there's a life in the blood cell. And when the blood is gone, the the the the the life doesn't go, the life goes back wherever it came from. &gt;&gt; I want to just continue on a moment. He said it has to be because the woman and her husband become one. They become one and so does the bride and Christ become one. The ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same. And that's why I read this quote. The ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same. The bride is not someone who hears uh uh hears a series of doctrines. &gt;&gt; The bride is not somebody who merely goes to church. The bride is not somebody who believes some erratic or false or cultish things. That's not the bride. The bride is someone who in whom God has made himself known to that individual. And they believe things that are even beyond their vision. They believe things that are beyond their reasoning. They believe the impossible. They see that God has said it and so I'm going to believe it. And if God said he purchased these people and they are they are selves of of his own eternal life, if these are children of God and children of the resurrection, he wants his children to see that. &gt;&gt; Not just go week in and week out and year in and year out without at least seeking to grasp that. Lord, help me &gt;&gt; this morning &gt;&gt; to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is the ministry of the bride of Jesus Christ the same as Jesus? We talked about You don't have any problem when I talk about Jesus when he was here on earth. He began to preach this. He began to say these things. Then he began to You don't have any problem with that. But the bride, the ministry of the bride, in other words, this is transcended down. It's been transferred down. I talked about Jesus ministry when he was on earth. We talked about the the prophet's ministry, how it started in its simplicity, but as it matured, as it matured, and we as believers believe, &gt;&gt; that we have a message that's maturing. us as Christians, as believers, as we m as we mature, I will just say it plainly, the more mature we are, the higher we ought to be able to look. [Music] &gt;&gt; The more mature we are, we we ought to be able to look up and see stars. &gt;&gt; I want that to become more than poetic. See stars. see the glory of God and look upon a person, look upon these young people, look upon one another as believers &gt;&gt; and uh &gt;&gt; I started to say and I will it comes back to my mind. I looked upon my own daughters and I saw a strength in them of witness. They were unashamed to speak of it in the school. And I I looked on it hadn't been very many years before that I had been in school. I thought I could never have done that. I I just wasn't that kind of person. And they just say it, you know, turn or burn. Oh my goodness. I could never say that. So what did that do to me? I didn't try to instruct them in it. I I I I buried it in my heart. I thought that's marvelous. That's marvelous that they have. In other words, there's a something there. there's something there that they're being forward and and I could see it producing a life and conviction in others. &gt;&gt; So, as we move along, we should be able to see our sights get a little higher &gt;&gt; and higher. &gt;&gt; I've traveled a lot. I know ministers all over the world. Are they all close to me? No. And they don't need to be. They may be in other countries and they may be and they may be serving God in their own direction and may not be what I'm called to do and they're not called to this and we're we're all called to do different things but we're effective and I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you. I appreciate, brother Daniel, you coming &gt;&gt; and sitting on this bench &gt;&gt; and and I I I admire that. And what effect does that have? I don't know, but it has an effect. &gt;&gt; And I see others. It may surprise you, but I I've seen others and I've seen I've just seen their life in the little simplicity things. Sister Kalista is sitting here. You see her. She doesn't get out and preach or do anything. But one day I had a very crisis moment. I had to see an unbeliever who just lost a loved one and all the responsibility of the funeral and everything was upon her and everybody was pulling, you know, trying to get influence with her and so on so forth. And I knew that I needed to see her. I said to my wife, "We got to drive to this place." And I'm all nervous inside. I'm the preacher. I'm the one that's supposed to have the answers. But I'm all nervous inside. I'm all tied up inside. I don't really want to go, but I have to go. It's responsible. I drive into the drive, walk into the house. I thought the house was going to be full of people. Nobody's in the house. Sister Kalista is sitting there with that woman just keeping her company and being with her. I may not have said this, Sister Kalissa, you went way up in my books. God had you go there. You people maybe you don't realize you just went to a place. &gt;&gt; You just talked to somebody. But it was that life that's in the cell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God put in you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was motivating you, pulsating you, causing a thought up into your mind. You thought it was just your idea. Not your idea. It's God doing it. And I just pray that we would be wise enough and and and have enough revelation enough so that the next person next door next to them sitting beside to say I saw that &gt;&gt; and I esteem them more. I say God bless them. &gt;&gt; And I come to church and I say there's a smile on your face because there's sister so and so, there's brother so and so. And even if we don't say anything, God's still doing it. &gt;&gt; God called them. Amen. &gt;&gt; You young people, you don't know. Perhaps you can have a such an influence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On your parents. Your parents need to be encouraged &gt;&gt; and they just see that godly life that you're living. &gt;&gt; Is this okay? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. The ministry of the bride of Christ and the ministry of Jesus Christ, it's exactly the same. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham actually referred to the same scripture that I read for a text and he said uh he was reading the first The first words of that chapter, the former treatise have I made, O Theophilles, of all that Jesus began to do, began to do and teach. And he said, "And is still doing &gt;&gt; in the bride of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; All that he began to do and he's still doing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the things that uh dilute this or bring this down and Satan, I'm going to tell you what he would do because I know his tactics very well. He'd try to press upon your mind and think about you're still thinking about, you know, all these things and that are around. No, don't let your vision go down. If you let your vision go down, you'll finally be looking at dust. &gt;&gt; You'll just be looking at dust. &gt;&gt; But if you let your vision rise, &gt;&gt; well, how will I do that, brother Biscll? Just by believing. So, I don't know how it's going to happen. I don't know what the outcome is. I don't know what the outcome of this generation is. I don't know what the outcome of my family is. I know one thing that word of God is absolutely true &gt;&gt; and I know that this God sent this messenger &gt;&gt; because I needed something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever I needed is there in the message [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you one more example and I'd like to do this before I close. Is that all right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll just take these few minutes, probably 5 10 minutes, brother Brandham, in one of the last messages, the rapture message, I think it's one of the earlier messages that you, Sister Lesie, read, the rapture message. and he said uh that there's a shout and that shout is the message. &gt;&gt; I'm going slow because I want you to hang on to it. And the shout is the message and then a voice and then a trumpet. &gt;&gt; And the voice is the resurrection and the trumpet is the gathering. Now, this might just blow your mind a little bit. And he says, "The shout a messenger getting the people ready &gt;&gt; for us." Some have been on the way a long time, others more recent. A messenger getting the people ready. The second is a voice of the resurrection. The same voice, the same voice that a loud voice in St. John 11:38-44 that call Lazarus from the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting the bride together &gt;&gt; and then the resurrection of the dead. See, to be caught up with it. Now watch the three things take place. The next is what was a trumpet, a shout, a voice, a trumpet. I went to that because I was looking for this phrase, the voice of the resurrection. It's once in the message, once in the rapture message, and I went exactly where I wanted to go. And so I go to Lazarus. And Jesus said unto her, now follow, don't don't don't think that I'm way off in left field. You're here as students of the Bible. And Jesus said unto her, that was to Martha. Jesus the messenger said to her personally, "Said I not unto thee, if thou which believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" &gt;&gt; Lazarus did not hear that voice. &gt;&gt; Lazarus was still in the grave. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was raised, where the dead was laid, I'm sorry. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father," now it's not to Martha and it's not to Lazarus, but he's saying, "Father, &gt;&gt; I thank thee that thou heardest me, &gt;&gt; and I knew that thou heard hearest me always, but because of the people which stand by, I said it," &gt;&gt; they heard it, too. &gt;&gt; Right? They didn't even know why they were hearing it. &gt;&gt; And Jesus saying, "Father, you heard me. And I know that you always hear me." And that he said for the people that were around in the congregation at that time because they needed to hear it. &gt;&gt; I know that you always hear me. Lazarus hadn't heard that yet. So now we have the messenger who's speaking the message &gt;&gt; that was God in flesh &gt;&gt; words of God proceeding from the words of Jes from the mouth of Jesus and Jesus at one point here this morning friends he might be speaking to a Martha he might speak to one person I'm speaking to you as an individual &gt;&gt; and you sense and feel some kind of pulsating happening within You might not even understand it all. They didn't understand it. Martha didn't understand it. The people standing by didn't understand it. But this was Jesus Christ himself, God in flesh, speaking the words. And he says, I say unto thee that thou shalt see the glory of God. And then he addresses the father. Father, I know that you hear me. You always hear me. This said he for those that stood by. &gt;&gt; They didn't even know it. They didn't come forward and say, "Oh Lord, I'm so glad you said those words. I needed that so bad." They didn't know they needed that. He knew they needed that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad this morning &gt;&gt; that God has someone even will speak behind the pulpit if I'm able to if I if if I would say it'd be a great honor for me to be able to speak something you don't understand. But father, if you know the people need it, I am so blessed to be able to be an instrument to say something that the people need to hear. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Here's the prophet. Here's what I see. the prophet in in his last messages and God is having him utter some things so that we 50 years or so down the road can be uh uh uh can be sensitive and say there's things buried in his message that I need to hear. And now he's explaining for the first time the shout which is the message that the people heard and the voice which will raise the resurrect the dead &gt;&gt; and the and the trumpet the gathering of them together. And he's making it known this order great order making it just before he goes for you. &gt;&gt; I didn't know he said that for me. He said it for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm encumbered with all kinds of things. Now you have a little preacher saying, "Look up." &gt;&gt; Those things will always be. &gt;&gt; Well, Father, we have poor people amongst us. You'll always have the poor. But look up. &gt;&gt; You don't disregard that. Do what you need to do as a Christian. We have conflicts. You'll always have them. &gt;&gt; You have disagreements. There'll always be disagreements. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; There'll always be disagreements. &gt;&gt; It affects me. It'll always affect you. &gt;&gt; Well, it's not of God. There'll always be things that are not of God. &gt;&gt; Sickness is not of God. &gt;&gt; Depression's not of God. &gt;&gt; All kinds of things are not of God. But there is a land beyond the river where these things don't exist. And God has put a seed in me that calls for that land. But because of the people which stand by, I said it, that they that they might believe that thou hast sent me. &gt;&gt; And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, &gt;&gt; come forth. &gt;&gt; And he heard that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the living heard that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God could already have spoken. &gt;&gt; By the messenger &gt;&gt; time will come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; At the appointed time. &gt;&gt; He's already said it. At the appointed time, the voice. &gt;&gt; And Jesus does all three while he's descending. Say, I can't understand that. Good for you. I don't either. But I say thus I believe it. He spoke it and thus I believe it. &gt;&gt; When will they come? At the appointed time. The voice the voice of Jesus Christ will bring them from the dead. And you may have and the people now the people who are standing by already heard it. &gt;&gt; They heard the words for them. They heard him refer to the father and and they heard him say I thank thee and I and this I say not I I say because of those that stand by that they may believe that you sent me &gt;&gt; and if they didn't believe it then if they had a twinge of doubt then they say maybe you want to think well Joseph of Mary you know I mean well he lived down and he was a Nazarene and so maybe maybe they had all of those thoughts. I can tell you one thing. When he said, "Lazarus, come forth." And Lazarus came, all those thoughts vanished. All those earthly thoughts. All those thoughts, I call them dust thoughts. Thoughts of dust. They're too low. They're not worthy of your time. I say to this congregation, lift up your eyes and see beyond your education. and see beyond your work. See beyond your failures, see beyond your weaknesses. And see that God has sent from heavens a message to you that pulsates in your heart. And something within you is saying, "It is true. It is true. It is true." [Music] &gt;&gt; Something is saying, "When I come into the house of God, there's an atmosphere. Who is it?" The Holy Ghost. Not just to be around you and to surround you, but to be in you. &gt;&gt; And the living and the dead both heard that voice. &gt;&gt; Take it however you want to take it. The living and the dead both heard. Lazarus, come forth. &gt;&gt; And Lazarus came forth. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, loose him and let him go. You put these rags on them. Take them off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's all kinds of stuff we put on one another. Take it off. &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong here. &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong with this kind of life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Some stuff we can take off. &gt;&gt; We don't have to put burdens on people. Take it off. &gt;&gt; Take these rags off. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; That was the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this messenger, I'll just say this messenger says perhaps over 50 times, &gt;&gt; he said one place, we have a right. We at this age, at this time, we have a right to look for the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And then as he goes on down, then when he comes into the the word part of his ministry, the people are wanting always to see that sign, keep it. And he was done with that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he knew that God had moved on from that. &gt;&gt; And so he said as as Jesus said, an adulterous generation seeketh a sign. And he says they'll get it. &gt;&gt; They'll get the sign of Jonas. &gt;&gt; They'll get the sign. &gt;&gt; And here the sign was playing out meeting after meeting after meeting. They'll get the sign. &gt;&gt; And they got the sign. But we didn't only get the sign. &gt;&gt; We have a right to look for the sign. We didn't only get the sign. We got the voice of the sign. &gt;&gt; The voice of the resurrection. That's why we're not living where we used to live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't have to be confused about things. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for you. I I thank God for you &gt;&gt; with all my heart. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's thank him. Father, &gt;&gt; as Jesus spoke those words, I thank thee &gt;&gt; that you've heard me. I thank you because you always hear me. I thank you, Father, for this audience of people. I thank you for those that are streaming. Lord, I thank you for those that will hear. And I pray that these words will mean, oh God, will have a depth of richness. And I ask that the Holy Ghost will reveal and make known what is needed at this time, at this season. Lord, we know that we're in a very, very late hour. In fact, is it seems as though immortality is merging with the mortal. It seems as though, oh God, that there's a a merging of the ages together. And we pray, oh God, we know also that church services will continue and things will continue even after the rapture takes place. Father, I pray, not knowing how many there are. But oh God, may each one in faith, the same faith of Abraham, say, "This message is for me, and this rapture is for me. This has been spoken for me. I have been gathered to it. I've been gathered to you, the author of this word. &gt;&gt; I pray you'll bless this people in Jesus Christ's name." &gt;&gt; Amen. I have one more thing to say while the musicians Thank you. I'm going to sing He Leadeth Me, He Leadeth Me. Uh, one more thing. When Lazarus came forth, this was the trumpet, the living, and the resurrected. [Music] And we're all gathered to Christ. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We say in French tootani at the end the resurrected will arise first. Paul said we which are alive and remain will be changed. And uh and I know we may well we try to figure out, you know, a lot of people try to imagine what the change. Well, I'll be younger. Well, that'll be nice. Yeah. I'll be you know, my nature will be changed. That'll be nice, too. But the best thing is that you'll be gathered to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I say to this congregation, &gt;&gt; look up. &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes. &gt;&gt; I repeat God's words to Abraham. I speak Abraham. See, look up. [Applause] Everything that bogs you down will always be here. [Music] &gt;&gt; He'll always be here. But the people who believe as Abraham believed won't always be here. That kind of faith will catch them away. That's why I'm preaching. I wouldn't want to be preaching and to know that this is in vain. May it stay with you. And this is something you practice tomorrow. This is something you soon something to bo you down. say, "I can't stand this anymore. I can't" and just say, "Well, I'm just going to lift up my eyes. Does this really matter? See, I get so frustrated." You do join the club. We get so frustrated. Say, "Not you, Brother Ed." Oh, no. I'm a saint. I never have that. You know better. We always do. We always have that. And uh that's just natural. But no, when I lift up my eyes and look beyond it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm laughing because I was telling a testimony to some of my family uh yesterday and uh and just relating how things happened in a person's life and and uh you know and it's amazing some of the people that you sought to do the best for. They're the ones that turn with such a revenge and and uh it's all right. But the Bible says of Jesus, I could put it in today's language which won't have the same effect, but the Bible says of Jesus, who for the joy that was set before him, suffered the shame and he suffered the reproach suffered the agony. What was set before him? I want to ask you, are you going to ask the question, what was it that was set before him? Do you dare answer it? Those he was going to purchase. Now, is it just a big glob of people? Is it or did he actually see you as an individual? And this this won't mean anything unless you say he saw me. And so I was part of that courage. I was part of that joy. He saw me. He saw me. He knew I would choose him. And who for the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross. And so I can say, who for the joy, if your eyes, if you see stars, if you see the glory of God, who for the eye for the joy that's set before him, he he if he was going to see us and see everything that you see about yourself, it wouldn't have never brought him much joy. No, I hope I'm making that clear who for the joy that was set before him. &gt;&gt; You need to see what he was saying. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; More next time. Why don't we stand? I want to sing He Leadeth me. He Leadeth me. Blessed God, oh worth the mother, what am I? Where can I be? Still Jesus has me. He leadth me. He leadth me by his own hand. His faithful power for my lead. Sometimes they sing on nature. [Music] He lead [Music] by we'll sing this third verse as the last verse. Lord I would clasp thy hand in mine. The important thing here is that he clasps your hand in his Lord. I would clap my hand in my norm [Music] whatever I see. Say to my God that you he [Music] faithful I would be for my redee. Lord, I will thy hand in my nor [Music] content. Whatever I see, send to my God and lead me. He leadth me. He is [Music] his faithful power. I would for [Music] May I give a piece of advice to this congregation? as a child and I've become more aware of this probably in the last 2 three years than ever before and I speak it to my wife because when I was young I was very passive. You might not see me as that but I was very passive. Well, you're going to go with these people now. Okay. All right. You're going to sleep in this bed. This is your room. Okay. And this is how far you have to go to school. You got a half a mile of school. You got three miles to school. You got four miles to school. You leave in the dark and you come back in the dark. You there's no such a thing as a child having rights and saying, "I don't want to do that. I don't want to get up in the morning. I don't want to go and water the horses. I don't I don't I'm scared of the dark." this is what you had to do and he didn't have anything to say about it. So they just this is where you go this is what you do. So but I didn't know that God was training me for the missions. This is where you sleep. This is the boards. This is a piece of cloth. This is what you eat. This is what we prepared. This is the place. Okay. &gt;&gt; It's not what you have. It's not your choice. You just do it. And I want to say something this congregation. It'd be much better for all of us if we just become more passive. And by that I mean more trusting. It blows this way, the wind blows that way, and things go wrong and go haywire and go sideways. You apply for a job, you don't get it. Well, I think you don't. I don't mean lazy. I mean passive. In other words, we don't get all stirred up inside and things aren't working the way we think they're going to work. We have a father. &gt;&gt; He knows our name. &gt;&gt; He knows the way things are supposed to go. And we say, "Well, we have a disappointment." There'll always be disappointments. We lift our eyes above the disappointment. Say, "That's not going to affect me. I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of the living God. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; We all have situations. I know this congregation. We all have situations. Some are very, very severe situations. Some are very ugly situations. You have a father. &gt;&gt; He knows all about that. I have a father. He knows who imposes those things. I have a father who's in charge. I have a father who's more concerned about me than about multitudes of others. He's more concerned. He actually came, lived, died, raised again. And he put a seed in me. Do you believe that? He put a seed in me before the foundation of the world. I was in his mind. And he let a seed come out. [Music] And I'm what they call predestinated. You say, "Well, uh, that that's We don't want to think too much about ourselves. We don't get away with that nonsense. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Now you get down to seeing dust. When you're listening to man's reasoning, &gt;&gt; it's dust. &gt;&gt; Soon as you listen to man's reasoning, I'll give you my equation to the thing. How much dust would his brain fill a teaspoon? And I'm going to listen to a teaspoon of ashes and let it affect my life and let it take my joy away. &gt;&gt; Never. Never. Not of this world or the world to come. Listen friends, maybe God just let this little preacher here go through what he went through and be determined the way that he is because you need it. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Shake hands with one another. I say God bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you richly. Amen. God bless you, brother. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] You can't. rest. Heat. Heat. [Music]
