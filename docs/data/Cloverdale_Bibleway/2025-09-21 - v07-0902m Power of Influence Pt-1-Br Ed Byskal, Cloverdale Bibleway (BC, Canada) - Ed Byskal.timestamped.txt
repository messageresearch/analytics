[23:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just
[23:06] worship him, saints. He's worthy of all
[23:08] our praise this morning. All glory and
[23:11] all honor, Lord. Lord, we place you,
[23:15] Lord, in the highest place in our midst
[23:17] this morning, oh God. Lord, for you
[23:19] alone are our great high priest, Lord.
[23:22] You're the alpha and the omega, Lord,
[23:25] the beginning and the end, Lord.
[23:28] Lord, we look to you this morning, Lord,
[23:30] for our sufficiency, oh God.
[23:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[23:37] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[23:40] you, Lord Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to
[23:45] your name, Lord.
[23:48] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[23:50] Thank you, Father.
[23:52] And I'm going to ask our brother Dave
[23:54] Chabernoff to come and lead us before
[23:57] the throne of grace this morning. We
[23:58] don't have any written requests,
[24:01] but I know there's lots of need needy
[24:03] people in our midst. And if you've got a
[24:05] need, if you're listening in on the
[24:06] internet, you've got a need. We've got a
[24:08] God here this morning. You know,
[24:09] regardless if it's big or small, and I
[24:12] just this past week, I sat down Thursday
[24:14] night. I've been wrestling with this. We
[24:15] were trying to get Jeremy's website,
[24:17] which is all done, finished. And it's
[24:21] going to be going up as soon as we can
[24:23] get it up. So, but we had to move it on
[24:25] to a new thing. And I've been doing all
[24:27] the technical stuff. I had virtual
[24:30] machines and virtual appliances and all
[24:32] this stuff. I know nothing about. And
[24:35] I've been m messing with this stuff for
[24:37] a month. And I just said, Lord,
[24:40] I don't have time to spend another month
[24:42] doing this. We need to get this up. And
[24:45] uh Lord, I don't have a clue what I'm
[24:47] doing. I know given enough time, I could
[24:49] probably get there, but you know, I
[24:50] don't have time. Lord, I need your help.
[24:53] I need you to get this thing done. I
[24:55] started 7:30 Thursday night. By 9:30,
[24:58] the whole thing was done. And I've been
[24:59] working on it for a month.
[25:02] I just said he started me heard me
[25:04] yelling downstairs. I just praise the
[25:06] Lord.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's He's here for whatever your
[25:09] need is.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, he knows it. He knows finances.
[25:14] He knows phys physical needs. Whatever
[25:17] your need is. Somebody think, well, God,
[25:19] you what do you know about? He knows. I
[25:21] mean, when you think there are billions,
[25:23] I was reading this week said if you took
[25:26] a sandbox and all of those grains of
[25:29] sand in it are stars, that's the Milky
[25:30] Way. And then you took the earth and
[25:33] filled it up all inside and out with
[25:35] sandboxes. You're starting to get some
[25:37] kind of comprehension. Each one of those
[25:39] sandboxes got a billion, couple of
[25:42] billion, 50 billion stars in it.
[25:46] He made it all. He put all those
[25:49] physical laws in place so that
[25:50] everything would run. I
[25:52] &gt;&gt; mean, if you've got a need this morning,
[25:54] he can meet your need, saints, whatever
[25:56] it is.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you just come before him, lift
[26:00] it before him as we come to prayer.
[26:01] Brother Dave,
[26:06] let's bow our heads.
[26:09] Our precious heavenly father. Lord, even
[26:12] as our brother Rod was just encouraging
[26:15] us this morning to believe, Lord,
[26:17] &gt;&gt; singing the song only believe, all
[26:19] things are possible, Lord, that to those
[26:21] that believe, Lord,
[26:24] just
[26:25] Lord, we believe that this morning,
[26:27] Father, we know that you're here. We
[26:29] feel your presence, Lord. It's just so
[26:31] good to be in your house, Lord. To be
[26:33] able to open our mouths and to give
[26:35] glory to the God of our salvation. Lord,
[26:38] to open our mouth and give praise to a
[26:40] God who has delivered us from this
[26:43] everpresent world. Lord, let us sit in
[26:46] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; What a blessed people we are this
[26:51] morning, Lord. We want to open our
[26:53] mouths. We want to give you glory, Lord
[26:55] Jesus.
[26:57] Lord, even reading the scriptures this
[26:58] morning that our life is but a vapor,
[27:01] Lord,
[27:03] &gt;&gt; it's passing quickly, Lord. But while
[27:04] we're in this vapor, Lord, we want our
[27:07] lives to be a glory to you, Lord Jesus.
[27:10] We realize, Lord, we have a great hope
[27:12] laying before us, Father. We just want
[27:15] to bless somebody while we're in this
[27:16] world, Lord.
[27:19] Father, we thank you for your presence
[27:20] this morning. We thank you for the
[27:22] brothers and sisters of like precious
[27:24] faith, the children that you have
[27:26] plucked from this evil generation. Lord,
[27:29] what a what a great holy calling it is,
[27:32] Father, to be gathered with your
[27:34] children, the bloodbought, the redeemed.
[27:36] Lord,
[27:37] we praise you for this, Lord Jesus. We
[27:39] praise you that we can be here in this
[27:42] group, Lord. Be called, elected, chosen,

[27:49] want to live a life worthy of the
[27:51] gospel. Lord,

[27:55] faith rise up to you this morning. We
[27:58] stand agreeing for every need. We want
[28:00] you to take control. We want to just
[28:02] pray that you would take divine control
[28:04] of this service. Take your servant and
[28:07] put your word in his mouth, Lord,
[28:09] &gt;&gt; and give us ears that would receive what
[28:12] the spirit wants to say to the church
[28:14] this morning. The spirit has a voice.
[28:16] The spirit wants to speak and we want to
[28:19] hear that voice Lord this morning. Give
[28:21] us a receiver we pray Lord as we commit
[28:24] this all to you now in the precious name
[28:26] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:32] And you can have your seats.

[30:41] thankful for what the Lord's done for
[30:42] you over the past uh months and years?

[30:51] 10 lepers that came to Jesus one day and
[30:54] only one of them came back and gave him
[30:55] thanks and uh I think that's not very
[30:58] good odds. So maybe you could we heard
[31:01] this song a while back and uh maybe you
[31:04] could just thank the Lord with us as we
[31:06] sing it.

[31:33] When I look
[31:35] around and see the good things he has
[31:40] done for me, well, I know
[31:44] I'm unworthy of them all.
[31:50] But his blessings
[31:52] he freely gives. I owe my whole life to
[31:58] him. I've got so much to thank
[32:03] him for.

[37:05] just before brother Ed comes for the
[37:08] things you have done for me. Things so
[37:11] undeserved. I mean all the things that
[37:13] the Lord does for us. We don't deserve
[37:14] it. Amen. It's his grace shown in our
[37:17] hearts. Amen.

[38:59] he has raised me. Dear God
[39:06] [Music]
[39:10] for the things
[39:13] he has done.
[39:17] Just let me live
[39:21] my life.
[39:24] Let it be pleasing
[39:28] Lord to thee.
[39:31] And should I give
[39:35] any
[39:38] let it go to town
[39:41] glory
[39:45] with his blood.
[39:48] He has saved me and with his power
[39:55] he has great
[39:59] God
[40:03] [Music]
[40:06] for the things
[40:08] he has done.
[40:11] [Music]
[40:13] to God
[40:17] be the glory.
[40:20] To God
[40:23] be the glory
[40:27] to God.
[40:31] be a glory
[40:34] for the things
[40:37] he has done.
[40:41] With his blood
[40:44] he has saved me. And with his power
[40:51] he has
[40:54] me.
[40:55] [Music]
[41:07] Let's stand as we sing it again. To God
[41:13] be the glory.
[41:18] [Music]
[41:20] Be the glory
[41:22] [Music]
[41:24] to him.
[41:25] [Music]
[41:27] Be the glory
[41:31] for the things
[41:34] we have done.
[41:38] with his heart.
[41:41] He has
[41:43] [Music]
[41:52] to go
[41:54] [Music]
[41:59] &gt;&gt; for the things
[42:02] he has done.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you Lord.
[42:10] Hallelujah. We give you glory.
[42:14] Alm mighty God.
[42:17] Hallelujah.
[42:19] Let everything that hath breath praise
[42:21] the Lord. We give you glory, oh God.
[42:27] You're our sufficient one. You're
[42:29] Jehovah Gyra.
[42:31] Our provider.
[42:33] Hallelujah. How you provided for us.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you Lord.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; We praise your name Lord.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:49] Praise your name.
[42:52] Has he been a great provider for you?
[42:55] Maybe we could just sing that chorus
[42:57] also, brother. Jehovah Gyra, my
[42:59] provider.
[43:03] Jehovah
[43:05] Gyra.
[43:07] Let's hear your voices now. My pro.
[43:15] My profile.
[43:16] [Music]
[43:37] my healer.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[43:46] Let it be Oh, now
[43:49] [Music]
[44:12] I need
[44:17] You are more
[44:20] than
[44:22] [Music]
[44:29] You are.
[44:31] [Music]
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's our God.
[44:43] We love him
[44:46] &gt;&gt; more than that. He loves us.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:51] Wouldn't do much good today if we only
[44:53] loved him. But he loves us.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he first loved us.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way we can love him.
[45:02] How wonderful. How wonderful. I so
[45:05] enjoyed the song that Mark and Elizabeth
[45:10] family sang. God bless them.
[45:14] Amen.
[45:15] It's a also a pleasure to hear that uh
[45:19] Sister Shell's mother, Sister Alice,
[45:24] is here. And uh we go back a long way,
[45:28] but I won't say how far back, but a lot
[45:30] of folks here probably don't know that
[45:33] Sister Shel's mother or sister Alice
[45:36] Grant is brother Neville's daughter.
[45:39] So, Now, you know, Brother Neville, I
[45:43] was pastor at the tabernacle for so many
[45:45] years as one of his three daughters.
[45:48] Amen. Good man. Three daughters.
[45:53] Real man. God bless you, sister.
[45:58] Well, it's wonderful to be back home.
[46:01] Amen. And uh uh we'll be saying a little
[46:04] bit about the services as we go along.
[46:06] But while you're standing, I'm going to
[46:08] have you turn in your Bibles because I
[46:10] want to go directly to the word and take
[46:12] my time in the word. And uh if you don't
[46:16] mind, we'll just uh be relaxed, take our
[46:21] time in the word. Amen.
[46:24] Sometimes it's not easy to convey what
[46:27] it is you want to bring. So, but if you
[46:30] take a little bit extra time, you you
[46:32] can be thinking about it while you, you
[46:34] know, with me as you move through the
[46:36] scripture.
[46:38] We'll turn in Isaiah to the book of
[46:41] Isaiah, the sixth chapter,
[46:45] and we're going to read from verses 1
[46:49] down through 8.
[46:57] In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw
[47:01] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[47:04] and lifted up, and his train filled the
[47:07] temple. Above it stood the saraphims.
[47:11] Each one had six wings. With twain he
[47:14] covered his face, with twain he covered
[47:17] his feet, and with twain he did fly.
[47:22] And one cried unto another and said,
[47:24] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts."
[47:28] And the whole earth is full of his
[47:30] glory.
[47:32] And the posts of the door moved at the
[47:34] voice of him that cried, and the house
[47:38] was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe
[47:42] is me, for I am undone, because I'm a
[47:46] man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the
[47:49] midst of a people of unclean lips. For
[47:51] mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord
[47:55] of Hosts. Then flew one of the saraphims
[47:58] unto me, having a live coal in his hand,
[48:01] which he had taken with the thong tongs
[48:05] from off the altar. And he laid it upon
[48:08] my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath
[48:11] touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is
[48:15] taken away, and thy sin purged. And I
[48:19] heard the voice of the Lord saying,
[48:21] "Whom shall I send? And who shall go for
[48:24] us?" Then said, "I here am I, Lord.
[48:29] Here am I, send me."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's wonderful process that's
[48:34] taken place there. We'll just have
[48:36] prayer once again before we
[48:39] begin the service.
[48:42] Almighty God, you're the one that has
[48:45] called.
[48:46] You're the one that has brought this
[48:49] great redemption about. And even as you
[48:53] said here to the prophet Isaiah, born a
[48:56] prophet, he could do nothing uh about
[48:59] it. He was called to that work. We are
[49:03] each one called to our place. We have a
[49:06] distinction, Lord, in your body, and
[49:09] that is that no one else can take our
[49:11] place. You've called each one of us and
[49:14] we're praying for your grace to be upon
[49:17] this entire congregation and all that
[49:19] are live streaming and all who will hear
[49:22] the service on the archives. May the
[49:24] same anointing and the same power, the
[49:27] same effect be upon them, Lord. And as
[49:30] you took the tongs and and touched the
[49:33] lips of the prophet and it is you that
[49:35] had declared now he was clean, now he
[49:38] was purged. Nothing to do with him. You
[49:41] did it all, Lord. We can say today, now
[49:44] we are clean. Hallelujah. Now we have
[49:47] been purged. Oh, the living stream of
[49:51] blood, oh God, has has cleansed us. And
[49:54] I pray that you'll now give us a divine
[49:56] revelation in your word in Jesus
[49:59] Christ's name. Anoint both speaker and
[50:02] hearers. I pray, Lord, as each of us are
[50:04] at our posts of duty. We thank you now,
[50:07] Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. You may be
[50:10] seated.
[50:19] I want to thank you for your prayers
[50:21] while we were away and uh it uh
[50:25] certainly meant a great great deal to
[50:28] have your prayers. Uh we had we're in an
[50:32] outstanding time in Congo. what is
[50:34] taking place there is uh uh difficult to
[50:39] describe but we I want to say a little
[50:42] bit about it just in in the context of
[50:46] the service itself.
[50:48] So I want to take this uh subject and uh
[50:54] speak on the power of influence.
[50:58] Brother Brandham used this scripture and
[51:00] I'm going to refer also to that. He
[51:02] referred to it a number of times.
[51:05] I don't want you to think so much of
[51:07] this as a a a message or just a
[51:11] scripture text.
[51:13] But I believe that you would recognize
[51:17] that the written word,
[51:21] the word of God, that's God on written
[51:23] page,
[51:25] is actually in a divine order.
[51:29] It's not just a a scattering of
[51:31] thoughts. It's not just a scattering of
[51:35] men who wrote. There's a divine order to
[51:39] the way it's laid out in the Bible.
[51:43] Number two, when the word was made flesh
[51:48] in the body of Jesus Christ and walked
[51:50] here on earth,
[51:52] he walked by a divine order.
[51:55] He went to the well when he was supposed
[51:57] to go to the well.
[52:00] He saw the lepers when he was supposed
[52:02] to see them. He he he came at the
[52:05] precise moment when he was to be born.
[52:08] And he knew when he was coming to his
[52:11] crucifixion and his death, he set his
[52:14] face, the scripture says, towards
[52:15] Jerusalem. Everything happened in a
[52:18] divine precise order. You believe that?
[52:23] Now the spirit of this word, the spirit
[52:26] of this word that authorized it and and
[52:31] and it is the author. He is the author.
[52:33] Jesus said, "I Jesus, he he authored the
[52:37] book of Revelation, which is our book."
[52:40] Now if that be so then the revealing of
[52:44] this son of man, the revealing of this
[52:48] same person cannot be just haphazardly
[52:53] taking place. There has to be a divine
[52:56] order. And if God has brought and sent a
[53:00] prophet, a vindicated messenger to be
[53:04] able to speak it, then he spoke it in a
[53:08] divine order. And also also the choice
[53:12] of the scripture text came at the right
[53:16] time and in the right place. It's just
[53:19] for you and I to absorb that
[53:22] &gt;&gt; and I believe that's something that we
[53:23] need to really ponder very deeply.
[53:27] I with God's help I would like to uh
[53:31] bring the service into this type of a
[53:35] context so that your thought will be not
[53:38] only what the scripture text is and how
[53:41] we will build or bring out truth from
[53:44] that and how it will apply to you but
[53:47] how God brought it when he brought it
[53:50] and what is it that he's trying to
[53:52] convey to us by doing it in that special
[53:55] kind of a way. It's like a father maybe
[53:58] taking his son or daughter when they've
[54:02] got maybe 16 or 17 years old and and sit
[54:07] down and say, you know,
[54:10] uh
[54:12] time has come. I want to talk to you
[54:15] about some serious things. I want to
[54:17] talk to you about life. I want to talk
[54:19] to you about your future. I want to talk
[54:21] to you about your plans. I want to want
[54:24] to talk to you about your decisions
[54:26] because Now the time has come. They
[54:28] might say, "Oh, wow. You know, father
[54:31] never spoke to me like this before. This
[54:33] this is a special moment." And that's
[54:36] exactly the way that it is. And brother
[54:38] Brandham talked about influence. Now,
[54:41] just to
[54:43] uh I want to just get into uh this here.
[54:58] Maybe have you just bring it in from up
[55:01] there. This is what influences the
[55:04] meaning of influence is the process of
[55:08] producing modifications
[55:11] especially
[55:12] when slow or permanent.
[55:17] It is to exert or maintain a mental or
[55:20] moral power upon or over others. This is
[55:25] an influence.
[55:27] And then it is the flowing into I want
[55:29] you to really notice this one. It is the
[55:32] flowing into of power whether in the
[55:36] form of a motive or ability. And when
[55:39] God the anointing remember I spoke on
[55:42] the anointing and it is actually the
[55:44] pouring the word pouring all that God
[55:47] was he poured into Christ. But when he
[55:50] poured into Christ he also had a a
[55:54] motive and Christ also had the ability.
[56:00] He was given ability. You say well
[56:03] Christ was God. That's that is exactly
[56:05] correct. But also Jesus said I can do
[56:07] nothing
[56:09] except the father show me the father if
[56:12] he does it. What I see the father do I
[56:15] do what he saw the father do then he
[56:17] knew he was enabled to do it. Brother
[56:19] Brandham said about the visions he said
[56:23] I can't make it happen but if the vision
[56:26] comes he said if god gave him a vision
[56:28] told him George Washington was going to
[56:30] rise he said he called the world to see
[56:32] it. Why? because he knew it was going to
[56:35] happen. He he would know then if the
[56:37] vision came, he would know that God a
[56:40] had the motive to do it. Whatever the
[56:44] result is, he may not know, but God has
[56:47] a motive and God is going to give the
[56:49] ability to do it. See, when God called
[56:53] us to the life that you have right now
[56:55] in Christ, God had a motive
[56:59] &gt;&gt; and he's going to he's giving you the
[57:01] ability to produce what he's intended
[57:04] you to produce. Can you say amen to
[57:06] that?
[57:06] &gt;&gt; So, it is an inflow. It's an inflowing
[57:10] of power whether it's in the form of
[57:12] motive or ability. And I say it's both
[57:15] in this case. Next slide, please.
[57:20] So the flowing into of power whether in
[57:23] former or motive. Now the scripture
[57:28] but ye shall receive power after that
[57:31] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[57:34] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[57:36] Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[57:41] and unto the uttermost part of the
[57:43] earth. Now this uh for the Holy Ghost
[57:48] the Greek word is numa which is like
[57:51] wind the holy ghost and it is the
[57:54] influence which fills and governs the
[57:58] soul. It's the influence the holy spirit
[58:01] is the influence that fills and governs
[58:05] the soul. It is the efficient source
[58:10] not just partially efficient. It is
[58:12] efficient. the efficient source of any
[58:16] power, affection, emotion, or desire.
[58:19] So, anything that God puts within a
[58:22] person, Brother Brand talks about the
[58:24] desires that an individual has, you have
[58:27] those desires. You're living a godly
[58:30] life because God puts the desire there.
[58:34] And God has a motive for putting it
[58:37] there
[58:38] &gt;&gt; and he has the ability to produce it.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:43] All right, we'll just move from the
[58:44] slides just now. I don't want to go any
[58:46] further with the slides. So, if your
[58:48] brothers will hold it, please, and just
[58:50] give us the the lights once again. Now,
[58:56] it's impossible for us to trace the
[59:00] effect of influence.
[59:04] Just impossible. We can't possibly see
[59:07] the ripple effect of it.
[59:10] Uh, brother Brandham talked about uh
[59:14] living after the first lady's example,
[59:16] the first lady of America, the
[59:18] president's wife, living after her
[59:21] example. In other words, he's saying
[59:23] that her example, maybe the way she does
[59:27] her hair or the way she dress,
[59:30] who can she'll put on one hat or have
[59:33] her hair cut a certain way and then it's
[59:36] just it just ripples throughout the
[59:38] entire population. You can't you can't
[59:42] pull it back and there's no way to
[59:44] determine the effect or the power of
[59:48] that influence. But it's it's gone.
[59:51] Brother Brandon makes reference to the
[59:54] living people living after the first
[59:57] lady's example. He said like a lot of us
[1:00:00] Pentecostal people do as he was saying
[1:00:03] at that time because he was talking to a
[1:00:05] Pentecostal group. He spoke about the
[1:00:08] Beatles
[1:00:11] and the influence of those renegades.
[1:00:15] The first reference that I can find
[1:00:18] that he made concerning the Beatles. Now
[1:00:20] you might a lot of young people say,
[1:00:22] "Oh, well I'm way back in history."
[1:00:24] Well, I'll just tell you the effect of
[1:00:25] them is not back in history. The effect
[1:00:27] of them still here today
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; very very much alive
[1:00:32] because it's not it's not men, it's
[1:00:35] spirits.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just spirits, it's demon
[1:00:39] spirits. And they've gotten into every
[1:00:41] form of entertainment, every form of
[1:00:44] music, every form of of activity. and
[1:00:49] they're very very much uh the effect of
[1:00:52] the influence of them. It's impossible
[1:00:55] to determine the amount of it. One man
[1:00:59] who uh is a he's a a fundamental
[1:01:04] Christian,
[1:01:05] he he said this on February the 9th,
[1:01:09] 1964,
[1:01:11] the Beatles
[1:01:13] appeared on the Ed Sullivan show and
[1:01:15] captivated the youth of America.
[1:01:18] after hearing their music. Now if you
[1:01:21] can just see that the fourth dimension
[1:01:24] of the ether waves and the radio waves
[1:01:27] and now the television which has become
[1:01:29] visual and become so much more powerful
[1:01:32] because now it had become visual. Don't
[1:01:34] worry, Satan knew what he was doing. He
[1:01:37] brought the theater right into the home.
[1:01:40] See? And so now he's using it because
[1:01:42] 80% of your knowledge that you retain
[1:01:46] comes through the eye gate and 20%
[1:01:49] through the hearing. So you're hearing
[1:01:52] right now, but visually you have to
[1:01:54] remember Satan uses the visual, the
[1:01:57] things you see in the stores and the
[1:01:59] shops and the color and all of the
[1:02:01] things and the design and and the things
[1:02:04] that are, you know, designed to enchant
[1:02:07] the population.
[1:02:09] Satan had a a purpose. He had a motive
[1:02:12] in presenting these young men at that
[1:02:15] particular time. And he says after
[1:02:18] hearing their music and seeing their
[1:02:20] look
[1:02:22] and seeing their look, he says, "I did
[1:02:25] what millions of young American boys
[1:02:27] did. I I begged my parents to let me
[1:02:32] grow my hair." And so he just saw them
[1:02:35] on a Ed Sullivan television show. And
[1:02:39] now here's just one youth from a good
[1:02:41] Christian home. He's wanting immediately
[1:02:44] to have that hairstyle. Now Satan has
[1:02:47] communicated to him something and
[1:02:50] feeding a desire in his heart to do the
[1:02:53] same thing and to look the same and act
[1:02:55] the same. Well, it's still with us
[1:02:57] today. Whether you see it in a magazine
[1:02:59] or whether you see it on your on your
[1:03:01] computer, it doesn't make any difference
[1:03:03] where you see it or you see your peer,
[1:03:05] you see your friend, you see your the
[1:03:08] young lady that you uh you young ladies
[1:03:11] are with or your young fellows that
[1:03:13] you're with and you see them do it and
[1:03:14] you think, "Yeah, that's kind of cool."
[1:03:16] And then you start imitating that, but
[1:03:20] you're following the tracks of a spirit.
[1:03:24] And so he asked his parents to let him
[1:03:26] grow his hair. And then he says, "Along
[1:03:29] with my best friend Tommy, I started a
[1:03:32] garage band." The Beatles performance
[1:03:35] had such an impact on us that we
[1:03:38] intentionally tried to be like them. It
[1:03:41] was a significant introduction to the
[1:03:45] power of influence.
[1:03:47] And I never got my title from this after
[1:03:51] God gave me the title power of
[1:03:54] influence. I just was doing some
[1:03:56] research on it and found people very
[1:03:59] very much affected by influence. He said
[1:04:02] years later the power of influence came
[1:04:05] to mean something far more significant
[1:04:08] to me as I began my journey as a
[1:04:11] follower of Christ. I had the desire to
[1:04:14] live under the influence of Christ. But
[1:04:16] I also wanted to be an influence on
[1:04:18] others pointing them to the savior. So
[1:04:21] now we want to think about two things.
[1:04:23] We want to think about the who might be
[1:04:26] influencing us and who we may be
[1:04:29] influencing and the one who's
[1:04:32] influencing us where who is influencing
[1:04:36] them.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; So you say this person is really
[1:04:40] influencing me. Where is that person
[1:04:42] getting their influence? Because whoever
[1:04:46] wherever the source is, you got to trace
[1:04:48] it back to the source. Wherever they're
[1:04:50] being influenced from, that's what's
[1:04:52] influencing you. And you're just going
[1:04:54] to be a conduit to influence somebody
[1:04:56] else. And once the influence is gone,
[1:04:58] you can't pull it back. You can't say,
[1:05:00] "Oh, I'm sorry." You know, that is the
[1:05:03] influence. We do influence somebody. You
[1:05:06] are influencing somebody.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Here's just a few quotes.
[1:05:14] He said, "Do you realize being a son or
[1:05:16] daughter of God that you are a minor
[1:05:19] creator?
[1:05:21] Do you know that you create the
[1:05:23] atmosphere and you live in it? Do you
[1:05:27] realize that the atmosphere that you
[1:05:30] dwell in, you influence somebody else?"
[1:05:34] So whatever atmosphere a person lives
[1:05:36] in, if you live in a you know a
[1:05:38] grumbling atmosphere or if you live in a
[1:05:40] gossip atmosphere, if you live live in a
[1:05:42] victorious atmosphere, you live in a you
[1:05:45] know a a peaceful atmosphere, people
[1:05:48] will see that and they're influenced by
[1:05:50] it and you're create you create your
[1:05:53] own. Don't don't think now well I'm just
[1:05:56] preaching and it has nothing to do with
[1:05:57] you. It has very much to do with you
[1:05:59] because a messenger prophet messenger
[1:06:01] said this is the conditions of this age
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; and we are each one creating our own
[1:06:07] atmosphere and influencing somebody by
[1:06:10] that atmosphere.
[1:06:15] In the message influences,
[1:06:18] he said, "Especially you people who are
[1:06:20] claiming to be Christians, separate
[1:06:22] yourself from the things of the world.
[1:06:25] Have nothing to do with the world. Shun
[1:06:27] it." You might say, "Well, what is the
[1:06:29] world?" Well, I would sure pray about
[1:06:31] it. If the prophet says, "Shun it," then
[1:06:33] I would say we ought to pray. Pray about
[1:06:35] it and say, "What is it, Lord?" And then
[1:06:37] I want to shun it. Give me a give me a
[1:06:40] sensitivity.
[1:06:42] give me make me sensitive because I
[1:06:44] can't always tell where did this
[1:06:46] influence I oh I that's really appealing
[1:06:49] well who made it appealing where did it
[1:06:51] come from
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; that's a good thing to ask ourselves
[1:06:54] young people where did this originate is
[1:06:57] this something that came out of a holy
[1:06:59] God is this something that came flowing
[1:07:02] out of eternity is this something that
[1:07:05] came to uh do something that is a
[1:07:09] positive thing for me in my spiritual
[1:07:11] life and that's the thing we want to
[1:07:13] ask. He said have nothing to do with it.
[1:07:16] Shun it. He said for some person is
[1:07:19] watching you. There isn't one individual
[1:07:22] within the sound of my voice or in this
[1:07:25] building. But what this holds true to
[1:07:28] you for parents, your children, your
[1:07:32] where you work, you're a student,
[1:07:35] someone who's next to you. I tell you
[1:07:37] what, I've been around enough of the
[1:07:39] students that have graduated and years
[1:07:41] and years later gone back to a gathering
[1:07:44] at the school and uh I I know when the
[1:07:48] girls go back, I always hear accounts
[1:07:50] and someone walks up and they're, you
[1:07:53] know, their whole demeanor has changed
[1:07:56] and their shape has changed and they've
[1:07:58] lost their hair and a big, you know,
[1:08:03] overweight some of them and come walking
[1:08:06] up And you know I what Joanne was
[1:08:08] telling me I and she couldn't recognize
[1:08:10] you remember me? No I don't remember
[1:08:13] you. Well I'm so and so. You're what? I
[1:08:16] can't believe that. Yeah. And they want
[1:08:18] to know are you still the same?
[1:08:20] You still religious?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And they find out that that even back
[1:08:25] then 25 years ago it left an impact
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; and it left an influence.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't it worthwhile? Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't it worthwhile to influence
[1:08:35] somebody? Let it go.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Let that influence ripple out.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Let it testify of Christ. You're only
[1:08:43] walking this way once. You might as well
[1:08:45] do it good.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Might as well burn it up. You won't be
[1:08:50] able to burn it up the second time. You
[1:08:52] can't go back and say, "Oh, I like to
[1:08:53] redo that. I like to relive that." We
[1:08:55] can't. So, we might as well do it now.
[1:08:58] Just resolve in our heart. I'm going to
[1:09:00] be an influence for God. gonna be an
[1:09:02] influence for holiness. Gonna say
[1:09:04] something, do something, but be an
[1:09:06] influence.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Some person's watching you. Somebody's
[1:09:12] watching you. He said, "And you're going
[1:09:14] to not only stand yourself there, but
[1:09:17] going to take them to the bad place."
[1:09:19] Talking about a bad influence. And
[1:09:21] you're going to have to answer for your
[1:09:23] influence. Now, let's just turn the look
[1:09:26] at the other side of the coin.
[1:09:29] You're going to stand there.
[1:09:32] Do you think that there's a possibility?
[1:09:34] You're going to stand there and see
[1:09:36] someone else standing there. Have them
[1:09:38] look. You think that this is I'm I'm You
[1:09:41] think this is just a myth? You think
[1:09:42] this is just dreaming? to have someone
[1:09:44] else stand there and saying the effect
[1:09:48] of your life, the effect, the influence
[1:09:52] that you had on my life is what gave me
[1:09:55] such a desire to turn my life over and
[1:09:58] to be here. Uh when I saw God do for
[1:10:01] you, that encouraged me
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; influence. Just just just one more.
[1:10:10] He said, "They that wait upon the Lord
[1:10:12] shall renew their strength. Let me
[1:10:15] humble my pride." Now he starts to quote
[1:10:17] the words of an old song. "Let me humble
[1:10:20] my pride and call on his name. Let me
[1:10:23] wait, Lord. If you will if you will
[1:10:26] never do no more than uh for me than
[1:10:29] save me, that's what I want." So he
[1:10:31] said, "If you don't do anything more for
[1:10:33] me, then save me." He said, "That's what
[1:10:36] I want.
[1:10:38] If you have need for me, show me. And so
[1:10:42] that I'll know and then I'll go. But you
[1:10:46] tell me first, I'm here, your servant.
[1:10:49] He says, do that and your influence will
[1:10:54] be great.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; No, you don't have to be a preacher to
[1:10:58] be an influence. You don't have to have
[1:11:01] you don't have to be highly visible in a
[1:11:04] congregation to have an influence.
[1:11:06] There's every single person here from
[1:11:08] the youngest to the eldest,
[1:11:12] from the strongest to the weakest,
[1:11:15] you're having an influence.
[1:11:21] You're influencing somebody.
[1:11:26] Sometime people feel strong. They say,
[1:11:28] "Well, I'm strong. I can I can handle
[1:11:30] it." But maybe you're influencing
[1:11:31] somebody who can't handle it.
[1:11:39] This is the beginning of school this
[1:11:40] next week.
[1:11:43] And I hear brother Brandham saying this.
[1:11:46] He addresses you young ladies first. Oh
[1:11:49] young lady,
[1:11:51] you might not live that kind of a life,
[1:11:53] but oh, if you could only meet this one
[1:11:56] I'm talking about, what your influence
[1:12:00] will be to your classmates.
[1:12:02] young man
[1:12:04] like Saul, educated, smart, what an
[1:12:07] influence he was to the whole Christian
[1:12:09] world. He was sent as an apostle to the
[1:12:12] Gentiles. When he met his when he met
[1:12:15] this Jesus in the pillar of fire that
[1:12:18] day, knowing that that was the same God
[1:12:21] that brought his people out of Israel,
[1:12:23] out of Egypt, Israel out of Egypt, he
[1:12:26] said, "You could meet this you could
[1:12:28] meet the same God. That's either a lie
[1:12:31] or it's the truth.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; That's not just some hysterical
[1:12:35] statement. You can meet the same God.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; You know, the reason that we don't
[1:12:40] really meet him the way we would like to
[1:12:43] meet him is because we do not approach
[1:12:46] him the way that people have approached
[1:12:49] him. I looked at the words when when
[1:12:53] Isaiah when he saw that God he saw this
[1:12:57] experience that he was entering into.
[1:12:59] And I don't want to get ahead of myself,
[1:13:01] but he said, "Wo,
[1:13:04] woe is me." And I began to look into the
[1:13:07] Hebrew of what it meant when a man would
[1:13:10] say, "Woe." It's like saying, "I'm
[1:13:12] hopeless. I'm undone.
[1:13:15] I I I'm I'm nothing. Whoa, it's me."
[1:13:19] It's like all is lost. It's like I've
[1:13:22] come to the end. Where's an answer? when
[1:13:25] he saw the holiness of God and saw
[1:13:28] saraphims who even covered their eyes
[1:13:31] and covered their feet and and with
[1:13:34] their wings. When he saw that holiness
[1:13:36] and only could hear, "Holy, holy, holy."
[1:13:39] And the other answered, "Holy, holy,
[1:13:41] holy," he said, "Whoa
[1:13:44] is me."
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; That's what was giving him entrance into
[1:13:49] the into the holiness of God when he
[1:13:52] realized his condition. And that's the
[1:13:54] way we need to. We can't feel that we're
[1:13:56] strong. We're self-sufficient. We're
[1:13:57] self reliant. We're capable of handling
[1:14:00] ourselves. You're not. You need to come
[1:14:02] to the place we say, "Woe is me, oh God.
[1:14:05] I can do nothing for my I cannot lift
[1:14:08] myself up. I cannot conduct my own
[1:14:11] affairs. I need you. I need the Holy
[1:14:14] Spirit. I need that power. I need that
[1:14:16] dunamis."
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I need that breath of God.
[1:14:22] See, we need to get desperate about
[1:14:24] things. Then you begin to have an
[1:14:26] answer.
[1:14:32] He said, "You'll influence your
[1:14:34] schoolmates
[1:14:35] and how Saul was educated,
[1:14:39] but he had met God." He said, "You can
[1:14:41] meet the same God." That's the Bible
[1:14:44] manifested proving that he is God. the
[1:14:48] vindication of him right on earth now
[1:14:51] that his work is made known for he's the
[1:14:54] same yesterday today and forever. What
[1:14:56] an influence you'll be to your church
[1:15:03] to this congregation.
[1:15:05] This paragraph is absolutely true. What
[1:15:09] an influence you'll be to the church, to
[1:15:13] your community,
[1:15:15] to the entire everybody you come in
[1:15:18] contact with. You'll be a changed
[1:15:21] person.
[1:15:23] Listen, every person, I want your
[1:15:24] attention.
[1:15:27] There isn't a person here that does not
[1:15:29] need to be an influence. We need to be
[1:15:33] an influence. The people around you are
[1:15:35] depending on it. Your friends are
[1:15:38] depending on it. You got somebody here
[1:15:39] say that's my friend. You have a
[1:15:41] responsibility to be an influence. Move
[1:15:44] them. Do everything you can in all of
[1:15:47] your action and all of your words and
[1:15:49] all of your conduct to influence them
[1:15:52] husband to wife and wife to husband.
[1:15:54] Influence them to parents to children
[1:15:56] and even young people to their parents.
[1:15:59] But you can be an influence in the home.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Decide on that. Now say, I'm going to
[1:16:07] listen to the rest of the service. I'm
[1:16:08] going to anchor that in my heart. I'm
[1:16:10] going to I'm going to make that a
[1:16:12] purpose and make that a resolve. I can't
[1:16:15] do within myself, but oh God,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; cause me to be an influence
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; to affect people.
[1:16:23] I only have this one life.
[1:16:26] You're living another day out right now.
[1:16:28] Only have this one life. We want to be
[1:16:31] an influence.
[1:16:38] When the prophet Isaiah
[1:16:41] this experience greatly transformed him.
[1:16:46] He brother Brand said the effects of the
[1:16:49] vision on the prophet
[1:16:52] what it did do to this man who was born
[1:16:56] a prophet. He said remember he wrote the
[1:16:59] entire Bible.
[1:17:01] See now that have such an effect on him.
[1:17:05] Isaiah wrote the entire Bible in that it
[1:17:07] has 66 books as the Bible has has 66
[1:17:11] chapters as the Bible has 66 books
[1:17:15] and it starts out like Genesis. He said
[1:17:17] in the middle of the book comes the New
[1:17:19] Testament and John the Baptist is spoken
[1:17:22] of in Isaiah and it ends up over in the
[1:17:25] millennium. great prophet. One of the
[1:17:28] greatest of the prophets said we ever
[1:17:30] had was Isaiah. And when he stood in the
[1:17:34] presence of God, what did it cause the
[1:17:37] prophet to do? The prophet said, "Woe is
[1:17:40] me, for I'm a man of unclean lips." To
[1:17:43] come into the presence of God and see a
[1:17:45] truly anointed vessel of God. It caused
[1:17:48] the prophet to confess that he was a
[1:17:51] sinner. It ought to do us that way. the
[1:17:54] anointed presence of God. When he seen
[1:17:58] that and the crying and the post, the
[1:18:00] post of the doors shaking and these
[1:18:03] angels going back and forth, proving
[1:18:06] they were before God and they were the
[1:18:09] servants of God, anointed, and he cried
[1:18:12] out he was a sinner.
[1:18:15] Now,
[1:18:17] Brother Brandham spoke from this text
[1:18:20] several times.
[1:18:22] I'm coming to a very very important
[1:18:24] point and I want you to really pinch
[1:18:27] your conscience and your thoughts now.
[1:18:32] He spoke from this passage, this very
[1:18:34] scripture several times
[1:18:37] and I believe that there was as I said
[1:18:39] earlier there was an order and I I felt
[1:18:44] an impulse to look at this order. I
[1:18:46] spent quite a bit of time and I was
[1:18:48] pondering it very very deeply.
[1:18:52] on on December the 30th of 1962.
[1:18:58] This is a a milestone moment in brother
[1:19:00] Brandham's life when he preaches sers.
[1:19:03] Is this the time he actually there's
[1:19:06] several titles that he gives uh to that
[1:19:08] and I think we can put that up if you
[1:19:11] like.
[1:19:13] Uh
[1:19:16] he called it sers. Is this the is is
[1:19:19] this the sign of the end? Sir,
[1:19:30] what time is it?
[1:19:33] And what is the time?
[1:19:36] Can you take that off, please?
[1:19:42] And
[1:19:44] In this message, he relates now in
[1:19:48] vision form the meeting of the seven
[1:19:52] angels.
[1:19:53] Now, this is December the 30th, 1962.
[1:20:01] And this is these are a few comments
[1:20:03] that he made which I've just selected
[1:20:05] for you so that you can get a a grasp
[1:20:08] this morning and a feeling. And I pray
[1:20:11] that you'll be able to absorb
[1:20:14] the event that he was going through.
[1:20:17] Because here's the whole context.
[1:20:20] What kind of influence
[1:20:24] was God bringing him under?
[1:20:28] And what was the purpose of that
[1:20:31] influence?
[1:20:33] And next, and even more important,
[1:20:37] am I being sufficiently affected and
[1:20:42] influenced by the influence he was
[1:20:45] under?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:20:50] He said, "And as soon as they left,"
[1:20:52] speaking of this constellation, not of
[1:20:55] the angels now, but he saw little birds,
[1:20:58] little warriors like in a tree and
[1:21:01] they're jumping back and forth. And he
[1:21:03] says, "And then they left and they went
[1:21:08] eastward."
[1:21:10] He says, "Then a constellation of larger
[1:21:12] birds because he's talking about the
[1:21:13] first, second, and third pull of his
[1:21:15] ministry." his ministry in three phases
[1:21:18] as Jesus also did.
[1:21:22] He said
[1:21:25] uh they look like doves, sharp pointed
[1:21:28] wings, kind of gray color, a little
[1:21:31] lighter color than what these first
[1:21:33] little messengers were.
[1:21:35] And they were coming eastward swiftly.
[1:21:39] And no sooner than they got out of my
[1:21:41] sight, I turned again to look westward.
[1:21:44] And there it happened. There was a blast
[1:21:47] that actually shook the whole earth. Now
[1:21:49] I said I now don't miss this.
[1:21:54] And you on tape. You be sure and get
[1:21:56] this right.
[1:21:58] First a blast.
[1:22:00] He says, "But it shook the earth. And
[1:22:02] when it did, I was still looking
[1:22:05] westward
[1:22:06] and way off into eternity, I saw a
[1:22:09] constellation of something coming.
[1:22:12] uh it looked like it might have been
[1:22:14] little dots.
[1:22:16] They could have been no less than five
[1:22:18] and not more than seven. If you read
[1:22:21] standing in the gap, he speaks about
[1:22:23] five and he describes it and so on. But
[1:22:25] listen what he says here. No less than
[1:22:27] five and no more than seven. But they
[1:22:29] were in a strange they were in a shape
[1:22:31] of a pyramid like these messengers
[1:22:34] coming. And when it did, the power of
[1:22:37] Almighty God lifted me up to meet them.
[1:22:42] And I can see it. I It's It's never left
[1:22:45] me. Eight days has gone by. Now, he's
[1:22:47] telling this one week later. Eight days
[1:22:50] has gone by and I can't forget it yet. I
[1:22:53] never had anything to bother me like
[1:22:56] this, like this has. Now, now listen.
[1:22:59] We're talking about the most phenomenal
[1:23:02] ministry that has struck the earth. and
[1:23:04] ministered for 33 years. But now he's
[1:23:09] he's uh he's he's identifying this as
[1:23:13] something that is very remarkable for
[1:23:16] himself. It's bothered him and he hasn't
[1:23:20] been able to even I'll speak a little
[1:23:21] later. He he said, "I didn't even
[1:23:23] minister. I didn't want to minister."
[1:23:26] He never had come to a time like this.
[1:23:28] He had never had an experience like
[1:23:30] this. Isaiah had never had an experience
[1:23:33] like he had. And that transformed his
[1:23:37] life to be the kind of prophet he needed
[1:23:40] to be because of what he was being
[1:23:43] ordained to do.
[1:23:46] Eight days have gone by. He says, "And I
[1:23:49] could see those angels, those shaped
[1:23:52] back wings traveling faster than sound
[1:23:55] could travel." He says, "And they came
[1:23:58] from the eternity in a split.
[1:24:02] I mean,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; oh my God, to see these mighty angels
[1:24:08] coming from eternity in a split. He
[1:24:11] said, like in a twinkling of an eye, not
[1:24:13] enough to bat your eye, just twinkle.
[1:24:15] And there they were. He said, I didn't
[1:24:18] have time to count. He said it was no
[1:24:20] less than five and no more than seven.
[1:24:22] But he said, I and I've had critics rise
[1:24:24] up and say, well, they preached a whole
[1:24:26] message. said it was five and four, two
[1:24:27] on each side, one at the top, and
[1:24:29] describes the whole thing. Oh, he just
[1:24:31] he's false. They think that that's
[1:24:33] false. He I'd like to have taken that
[1:24:35] fellow and put him in the presence of
[1:24:37] just one of those angels. And I think
[1:24:39] he'd be graveling on the ground. He
[1:24:41] wouldn't know if there was one or if
[1:24:42] there was a hundred.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; You don't even hardly know your own
[1:24:47] name.
[1:24:49] In the presence of that holy we poor
[1:24:52] humans creeping around on the brittle
[1:24:55] threads of life. What what can we know
[1:24:58] about this kind of a experience this
[1:25:00] kind of visitation? I couldn't even
[1:25:03] count he said and they came like in a
[1:25:06] split. I didn't have time to count. He
[1:25:09] said I didn't have time no more than
[1:25:12] just to look. mighty ones, a powerful
[1:25:16] angel, snow white, wings set in the
[1:25:19] head, and they were, he said to like,
[1:25:23] he said, I was caught up into the
[1:25:24] pyramid of the constellation. And I
[1:25:26] thought, now is it it?
[1:25:29] He said, I was numbed all over. And I
[1:25:32] said, oh my, this means that there will
[1:25:34] be a blast that will kill me. I'm I'm at
[1:25:37] the end of my life now. And then he he
[1:25:40] continues on. He said that Lord God,
[1:25:42] what does this vision mean? And I
[1:25:44] wondered and then and then it came to
[1:25:46] me. Not a voice just came to me. Oh,
[1:25:50] that is the angels of the Lord coming to
[1:25:53] give me my new men, my new commission.
[1:25:56] And when I thought that, I raised up my
[1:25:59] hands and said, "Oh Lord Jesus, what
[1:26:01] will you have me to do?" Exactly. Isaiah
[1:26:04] when he came to think when he saw that
[1:26:06] saw that in manifestation oh send me
[1:26:10] Lord I'll go
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; what will you have me to do and the
[1:26:16] vision left and for almost an hour I
[1:26:20] couldn't feel
[1:26:23] he said it feels like a reverent fear I
[1:26:27] was so scared till I was paralyzed in
[1:26:29] the presence of those beings I tell you
[1:26:32] the truth
[1:26:34] He said, "As Paul said, I lie not.
[1:26:39] You never caught me saying anything
[1:26:41] wrong about something like that.
[1:26:44] Something's fixing to happen."
[1:26:49] He said, "I found myself somewhere over
[1:26:51] in a corner and I had a I had a Bible
[1:26:55] open
[1:26:57] and it was reading." He said, "I don't
[1:26:58] know, but it was in I believe Romans the
[1:27:00] 9th chapter.
[1:27:03] the last verse.
[1:27:06] Now see even that I can have this open.
[1:27:10] I have the my Bible.
[1:27:13] I'm opening it now
[1:27:18] here. I'm at Romans
[1:27:21] and I'm at Romans the 9th chapter.
[1:27:25] But that wasn't all. If you open your
[1:27:27] Bibles to Romans the 9th chapter, it
[1:27:29] doesn't open to a verse.
[1:27:32] But now it's open to a verse.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; You see the Bible, his Bible is open,
[1:27:39] but he that this this influence, this
[1:27:42] powerful effect he was under was so
[1:27:45] specific. It wasn't just that the Bible
[1:27:48] was open, he's just even drawing it from
[1:27:50] memory now, eight days later, but it was
[1:27:52] open to a certain verse. And the verse
[1:27:55] is, as it is written, behold, attention,
[1:28:00] I, Almighty God, lay in Zion a stumbling
[1:28:04] stone and a rock of offense. And
[1:28:07] whosoever believeth on him, not it.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; A stone could be it, but this stone is a
[1:28:14] himymn.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; This stone is Christ. And this whole
[1:28:18] vision and the coming of the angels is
[1:28:21] announcing to his own servant, his
[1:28:24] prophet messenger who is the valid the
[1:28:27] one who who's who's validated to be able
[1:28:30] to speak the opening of the seals. He's
[1:28:32] telling him, I'm laying in Zion. This
[1:28:36] whole thing happened because I am laying
[1:28:39] in Zion a stone. It's a stone of
[1:28:42] offense, a rock of offense. And
[1:28:45] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:28:47] ashamed.
[1:28:51] He says, "And I thought it's strange
[1:28:55] that I be reading that." He said, "The
[1:28:58] spirit still packing me in the room."
[1:29:02] And I closed the Bible and stood there.
[1:29:05] I went over to the window. It was about
[1:29:07] 10:00 in the day or better. And I raised
[1:29:11] my hands and I said, "Lord God, I don't
[1:29:15] understand.
[1:29:17] This is a strange day to me and I'm
[1:29:20] beside myself almost." And I said,
[1:29:23] "Lord, what does that mean?"
[1:29:28] This next slide, please.
[1:29:34] Three months before this event,
[1:29:38] Brother Brandham took this text and he
[1:29:42] preached in his presence.
[1:29:46] And then two months before he took the
[1:29:49] text again and preached on the influence
[1:29:51] of another.
[1:29:55] And then he preached on influence four
[1:30:00] times in 1963
[1:30:03] which is the year that of the preaching
[1:30:06] of the seals
[1:30:08] and two times in 1964.
[1:30:12] He may have read the text after. I
[1:30:15] haven't researched all of that but he
[1:30:17] took influence.
[1:30:19] And now I want you to before I go any
[1:30:22] further, I would like you to see here's
[1:30:26] here's December. You can take that off
[1:30:29] now, please. Here's December the 30th in
[1:30:32] this incredible experience.
[1:30:37] two months before and three months
[1:30:38] before he's directed.
[1:30:42] In the year King Uzziah died,
[1:30:46] I saw the Lord high and lifted up and
[1:30:49] his train filled the temple and the
[1:30:53] saraphims came in such reverence and
[1:30:56] such fear and that that is coming now
[1:30:58] before then he has this experience and
[1:31:02] he reads serves as this the time he
[1:31:05] takes Revelation 10 the opening of the
[1:31:09] book that it will be open And that is
[1:31:12] such a sacred thing to almighty God. And
[1:31:15] he's confirming it to him. And even
[1:31:18] after the experience, he's saying, "I
[1:31:20] don't know what it means." But he's
[1:31:21] chosen now. He's directed to choose
[1:31:24] Revelation 10 1-7 for sers, is this the
[1:31:28] time? Saying, "Is this the time?" He's
[1:31:31] asking, "Is this the time for this to
[1:31:34] happen?" And now he's it's almost like a
[1:31:37] preparation work. And he's he's spoken
[1:31:40] in the year King Uzziah died, he saw the
[1:31:42] Lord high and lifted up. Then two months
[1:31:44] before and then he he steps into this
[1:31:46] experience. Then immediately in January,
[1:31:49] he speaks influence again because
[1:31:52] there's something that's taking place.
[1:31:55] And then uh three more times in 63 he
[1:31:59] takes influence and then uh two more
[1:32:03] times it's like it's like the opening of
[1:32:06] the seals is caught in a vortex
[1:32:10] of him speaking the influence because I
[1:32:14] will say this brother Brandham's entire
[1:32:17] ministry was transformed from that time
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and the proph prophet that you know
[1:32:26] became the prophet who he was because of
[1:32:29] that experience
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; and the meeting of those angels in
[1:32:34] reality. Now we're just sitting here in
[1:32:36] a service and you're trying to
[1:32:38] assimilate. I pray that God will give
[1:32:41] you not the mental powers but give you
[1:32:46] spiritual power to be able to open your
[1:32:49] heart and to grasp what God has done in
[1:32:53] this. I challenge any person to show me
[1:32:58] wherever anything like this ever
[1:33:00] happened. People claim it, people
[1:33:02] profess it, but then to have a to have
[1:33:05] that vessel stand at the platform and
[1:33:08] begin to relate the very secrets of the
[1:33:11] hearts of the people one after the other
[1:33:13] after the other. I just listened while I
[1:33:16] was away and he's in Chicago and he
[1:33:18] preaches and he begins he calls up one
[1:33:20] person. You can hear it. He calls out
[1:33:22] another person and and calls out I think
[1:33:25] about a third person and then he points
[1:33:27] down to a woman. Points down to a woman
[1:33:30] that's on a stretcher and he says you're
[1:33:33] paralyzed. Says you're a paralytic. He
[1:33:36] said if if I were you in the name of
[1:33:39] Jesus Christ rise up off that c. He says
[1:33:42] there she is. Someone just give her a
[1:33:44] hand. Give her a little hand. And she
[1:33:46] gets up and the audience just becomes
[1:33:49] totally electrified. just a roar. He
[1:33:51] said, "There's another one." Another one
[1:33:53] gets up. He says, "There's a man getting
[1:33:55] out of a wheelchair and the place just
[1:33:57] goes wave after wave." He says, "Here's
[1:33:59] a man on the platform." He's come up on
[1:34:01] the platform. There are people who
[1:34:03] couldn't walk. People are paralyzed.
[1:34:06] That's the kind of proof that come
[1:34:08] behind this ministry. And he says, "I
[1:34:11] lie not. I tell you the truth."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Then I say amen to that.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; That paralytic woman, she'd say, "That
[1:34:17] is the truth. There's the secret of your
[1:34:20] heart. That is the truth.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; We sat in the meetings. We give
[1:34:23] testimony to it. This is not just, you
[1:34:25] know, some flash in the pan or some pie
[1:34:28] in the sky. This is something that God
[1:34:30] did. It was a holy, holy thing that God
[1:34:34] has done. Hallelujah.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm standing here today. I'm
[1:34:39] not here to preach a service. I'm here
[1:34:41] to tell you what God is dealing with my
[1:34:43] own heart.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] And God is requiring even more out of
[1:34:49] this congregation, more consecration,
[1:34:52] more dedication. He's expecting it out
[1:34:54] of us for the things that he's made
[1:34:56] known to us.
[1:35:01] He said
[1:35:04] now
[1:35:07] on March the 17th, we've just gone from
[1:35:10] December 30th, January, February, March
[1:35:14] 17th,
[1:35:17] and he's speaking the breach. He just
[1:35:20] coming to the seals. I have the seals
[1:35:22] book with me here. So, he just coming
[1:35:25] now. preaches God in simplicity and then
[1:35:28] the breach because the breach is that
[1:35:30] segment that portion that's between the
[1:35:33] church ages
[1:35:35] if I had the church ages here is between
[1:35:37] the church ages and the seals
[1:35:41] and for those of you that are just
[1:35:42] perhaps newer visiting
[1:35:45] prophet of God said things about the
[1:35:47] seals he never said about the church
[1:35:48] ages the church the church is always a
[1:35:51] woman and is always in the feminine
[1:35:53] gender So the church ages, ages are
[1:35:57] time. So that was the woman's time. So
[1:36:00] down from when uh when the Holy Spirit
[1:36:03] came down into the church on the day of
[1:36:05] Pentecost, the church was born as a
[1:36:08] young woman, as a young girl, and then
[1:36:11] comes up all through the ages. And God
[1:36:14] takes an elect out and a left out. And
[1:36:16] it keeps moving down to about 2,000
[1:36:19] years. Then the end time, the last
[1:36:21] messenger comes. He's not a reformer,
[1:36:23] but he has to be a prophet. And the
[1:36:25] reason he has to be a prophet is for
[1:36:26] this very reason
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; to be able to speak the contents of a
[1:36:31] sealed book where people have probed. Do
[1:36:34] they go through the tribulation? No. One
[1:36:36] argues yes, they do go through the
[1:36:37] tribulation. Next one says, "No, we
[1:36:38] don't go through the tribulation." Next
[1:36:39] one says we go halfway up in the halfway
[1:36:42] through the tribulation. We go in the
[1:36:43] rapture. Well, it's three. How long's
[1:36:45] the tribulation? It's three and a half
[1:36:47] years. No, it's seven years. It's this
[1:36:48] that. How do you baptize? Well, hey, you
[1:36:50] should go down three times forward and
[1:36:52] three times backward or in the trinity
[1:36:54] or this or that or one or just the name
[1:36:56] of Jesus. Just a total mass of
[1:36:58] confusion, just a kaibos. We needed thus
[1:37:02] sayaith the Lord. And here's the proof
[1:37:04] of it. So, it could all be settled. And
[1:37:07] we have an absolute.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And if you don't take the absolute,
[1:37:10] that's up to you. But when God confirmed
[1:37:13] it, God's going to call you up short one
[1:37:15] day and make you answer. I spoke. You
[1:37:19] heard it. You've read it. You You had it
[1:37:22] available. You said, "I I I never heard
[1:37:25] it." What do you mean? 1100 tapes and
[1:37:27] you never heard it.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; I gave I I allowed a I allowed the whole
[1:37:32] civilization to become advanced and to
[1:37:35] tap into my laboratory and you never
[1:37:37] heard it.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; All right, young people. Here I am. I'm
[1:37:43] laying a challenge to you. Never heard
[1:37:45] it.
[1:37:47] sent the greatest wave across the across
[1:37:51] the history. I was reading I I pulled up
[1:37:54] from a
[1:37:56] voice of healing magazine that was on
[1:37:59] the web. I did never knew it was there
[1:38:01] but I just Brother Brandham mentioned a
[1:38:03] certain man certain minister. So I just
[1:38:05] typed it in and his name came up in the
[1:38:07] Voice of Healing magazine which I have
[1:38:09] several of them original voice of
[1:38:11] healing magazines but brother Brandham
[1:38:12] is is named in there as as one of the
[1:38:15] associate editors. He's not an editor,
[1:38:17] but he was a a contributor and many
[1:38:20] people contributed. And so then I looked
[1:38:22] at the the announcements for the special
[1:38:25] meetings. Oh my goodness. I thought I
[1:38:29] knew everybody. I didn't know any more
[1:38:31] than half of them and just names of and
[1:38:34] having meeting in this this city and
[1:38:36] that city and in England and all over
[1:38:38] all over the country. just lists of the
[1:38:41] names and pictures of AA Allen's tent
[1:38:43] and maybe 15 20 30,000 people in it and
[1:38:47] Oral Roberts was there and Gardner and
[1:38:50] WV Grant and Tommy Osborne and Tommy
[1:38:52] Hicks and on and on and on and Jaggers
[1:38:56] and all these names just dozens of these
[1:38:58] men all listed up and then you see say
[1:39:01] where is it now with all this wave
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; where's the influence of these men now
[1:39:09] where's the voice and this club foot
[1:39:12] being healed and pictures of it, this
[1:39:14] being healed and that one being
[1:39:16] healed. Those were great things. But the
[1:39:18] prophet says, "If there isn't a voice
[1:39:21] behind the sign," he said something
[1:39:24] else, forget it.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Forget it. If there isn't a voice behind
[1:39:30] the sign, forget it. But I would say, if
[1:39:33] there is a voice behind the sign,
[1:39:36] remember it.
[1:39:39] not forget it. Not lay it aside. Not let
[1:39:42] not be casual with it. But what does it
[1:39:45] say to you?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; There isn't a man or woman, not a person
[1:39:49] here. But what are you going to stand
[1:39:50] before God someday?
[1:39:54] And you know what you'll see? God's not
[1:39:56] going to come with a great big finger
[1:39:58] down.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; You're going to see yourself sitting in
[1:40:01] this service.
[1:40:04] Your mental powers will be so clear,
[1:40:06] you'll remember exactly where you sat.
[1:40:09] Your mental powers will be so clear,
[1:40:11] you'll remember exactly what I preached.
[1:40:15] And you'll hear this voice again
[1:40:18] say, "You're going to be called before
[1:40:19] God and give answer for this service.
[1:40:23] What influence
[1:40:25] are you under?"
[1:40:32] I'm thinking now
[1:40:36] of this happening that actually took
[1:40:40] place.
[1:40:42] Now on March the 17th,
[1:40:45] brother Brandham begins to speak on the
[1:40:47] breach
[1:40:49] and he refers back to December the 30th.
[1:40:54] This is just March. See a tremendous
[1:40:57] amount happened just two three months on
[1:40:59] this side and two three months on this
[1:41:00] side and this is caught in the vortex of
[1:41:03] it.
[1:41:04] So he refers back
[1:41:07] and he asks the people now he's just
[1:41:10] he's just about two and a half months
[1:41:12] later and he asks the people how many in
[1:41:14] here has read what time is it sir
[1:41:19] or has heard it you know what time is it
[1:41:22] sir
[1:41:24] said that's bothered me quite a bit
[1:41:27] if you haven't I wish some way if you
[1:41:31] could get to hear it or some way kind of
[1:41:34] bothered me. He said, "I just wanted to
[1:41:37] drop this before starting the service
[1:41:40] about a week or 10 days ago. I was so
[1:41:43] disturbed.
[1:41:45] I just wouldn't take services or
[1:41:48] anything because I didn't know." I'm
[1:41:50] bringing you to
[1:41:52] I'm bringing to you a a a real tight
[1:41:55] period of time when the prophet is
[1:41:58] speaking influence. One man's influence
[1:42:02] serves as this time right after
[1:42:04] influence.
[1:42:06] Influence the opening of the seals and a
[1:42:09] couple more times influence.
[1:42:12] I would say without being a very very
[1:42:14] intelligent man
[1:42:17] that God
[1:42:19] who put this Bible in its order
[1:42:24] and who caused Jesus Christ and lived in
[1:42:27] him, God was in Christ, God walking in a
[1:42:30] certain fashion,
[1:42:32] meeting a Nathaniel,
[1:42:35] meeting a disciples, he met them at
[1:42:38] exactly the right moment, in the right
[1:42:41] exactly the precise this moment in time
[1:42:43] and had the effect upon their lives
[1:42:46] and others looked on him when he did
[1:42:50] certain things. They said, "Belabove."
[1:42:55] He just looked at them.
[1:42:59] They'll hear their own words one day
[1:43:03] standing in that holy presence.
[1:43:06] And that same God, then they came to
[1:43:08] Luke 17:30.
[1:43:10] Jesus standing here on the earth saying
[1:43:13] to people who knew well about Sodom and
[1:43:15] Gomorrah, knew well about the days of
[1:43:18] Noah. Said, "As it was in the days of
[1:43:22] Noah,
[1:43:24] they builded and they planted and they
[1:43:25] were economically prospering."
[1:43:29] Very much describes today.
[1:43:32] Said that's the way it was and that's
[1:43:35] the way it will be when the son of man
[1:43:38] is revealed. And as it was in the days
[1:43:41] of Sodom, the revealing of Christ
[1:43:44] himself, God himself in a body of flesh
[1:43:48] to Abraham his his elected saint,
[1:43:52] telling him, and giving of the secret of
[1:43:55] his wife's heart, and saying, I,
[1:43:58] personal pronoun, shall surely return
[1:44:01] unto thee according to the time of life,
[1:44:04] and Sarah shall have a son.
[1:44:08] Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; And two servants go to Sodom said, "Even
[1:44:13] thus will it be in the day when the son
[1:44:16] of man is revealed."
[1:44:19] Now we have the vessel on earth
[1:44:21] revealing the son of man. Everything
[1:44:24] coming in its divine order. And I say to
[1:44:28] you, brother Brandham went to Isaiah the
[1:44:31] 6th chapter
[1:44:33] at the precisely the time he was
[1:44:35] supposed to. He preached it and said
[1:44:37] what he was supposed to say. He came to
[1:44:39] it again. He came to it again. Came to
[1:44:42] it again and just sandwiched the seals
[1:44:45] in between there. Why? Because now
[1:44:50] is a servant of God.
[1:44:53] This uh prophet messenger being
[1:44:56] impacted,
[1:44:58] influenced,
[1:45:01] influenced. Are you following me?
[1:45:04] And it went then a spoken word and out
[1:45:08] of his mouth and onto tapes and so on.
[1:45:11] And it began to ripple out and it found
[1:45:15] you someplace some way somehow. It found
[1:45:20] you. And it meant maybe nothing to the
[1:45:22] person next to you or to someone else in
[1:45:25] the family, but it found you. And when
[1:45:28] it when that influence when that impulse
[1:45:30] and that effect come and struck your
[1:45:33] soul said, "Oh my God. This is none
[1:45:36] other than God himself.
[1:45:39] This is the revealed Christ. This is the
[1:45:41] word." And people tried to talk you out
[1:45:44] of it. And he said, "You can't talk me
[1:45:46] out of it. It's already in me. It's
[1:45:48] already alive. It's a part of my being.
[1:45:51] It's a part of my whole spiritual lif
[1:45:54] stream. No way to talk yourself or be
[1:45:56] talked out of that.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Said one early morning I got up to go
[1:46:08] into Sabina Canyon. This is at the same
[1:46:10] time
[1:46:12] eight or 10 days before this. So I say
[1:46:14] it's the first week of March
[1:46:18] which from the house is only about 30
[1:46:20] minutes drive or 40 to the head of
[1:46:23] Sabina Canyon. I just clear something
[1:46:26] up. I can so relate to this because
[1:46:31] I lived just 30 40 minutes all my young
[1:46:35] manhood 30 40 minutes from hunting
[1:46:41] and on I had to work till Wednesday noon
[1:46:43] in the store.
[1:46:46] Wednesday afternoon it was store was
[1:46:48] closed so I just borrowed a gun. It
[1:46:51] wasn't even my own. I just threw it in
[1:46:52] the back of the car and drove my car out
[1:46:55] in the country and and shot my first
[1:46:57] deer. Come back. I was at work the next
[1:47:00] morning.
[1:47:02] Next Wednesday, you know, or Wednesday
[1:47:04] or two later, threw the gun in the back
[1:47:06] of the car again, drove another 20
[1:47:08] miles. It only took me less than 30
[1:47:10] minutes. Drove out there. It had snowed
[1:47:12] the night before. And within within
[1:47:15] probably 30 minutes or so, I had a
[1:47:17] moose. My first moose. I was 16. I had
[1:47:20] my first moose now.
[1:47:22] I wish I'd had some of you young fellas
[1:47:24] there. I said, "Now what? Now what do I
[1:47:27] do?"
[1:47:30] People
[1:47:33] say, "Well, Brother Brandham wasn't out
[1:47:35] in the desert on the 28th because he was
[1:47:38] in he was in Houston on March the 4th
[1:47:40] and preached and said, "After I got back
[1:47:43] when I got back from Houston, I went out
[1:47:45] hunting with the brothers in uh uh and
[1:47:49] with brother Sothman and so on." And
[1:47:51] brother Sothman was there during this
[1:47:53] time. What is the big deal?
[1:47:57] 30 40 minute drive.
[1:47:59] So he's up there in February and March
[1:48:02] the 4th he had to fly to Houston to
[1:48:03] intercede for that boy on death row and
[1:48:06] comes back after and goes up again.
[1:48:08] That's nothing. I understand that
[1:48:10] perfectly. They did all the time. Throw
[1:48:14] the gun on the back and drive up and go
[1:48:16] hunting with the brothers 20 30 minutes
[1:48:17] away at and and people make a great big
[1:48:20] issue and try to figure that out. I'll
[1:48:22] tell you what, the prophet said he was
[1:48:24] caught up in that constellation of
[1:48:25] angels. And I don't care how people put
[1:48:27] the time or anything else. He said this,
[1:48:30] "I tell you the truth and I lie not."
[1:48:32] That's that does it for me.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And furthermore, what
[1:48:36] happens after that is this book, this
[1:48:39] book that's been so disputed, this book
[1:48:42] that has been so confusing, now a life
[1:48:44] comes out of it.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; And I feel an impact of a of a
[1:48:49] influence.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, congregation.
[1:48:54] What a privileged people.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; You are.
[1:48:59] think that God would take one man and
[1:49:01] put him into such a situation to impact
[1:49:06] him just till he's numb while he knows
[1:49:10] who he is or where he is and to give him
[1:49:12] that uh uh bring him into that
[1:49:15] atmosphere of holy angels and then to
[1:49:18] sit eight days and have them come one
[1:49:21] after the other one after the other
[1:49:24] because I say eight days because he
[1:49:26] spoke also the questions and answers ers
[1:49:28] and here they come and and opening he
[1:49:31] said tomorrow night seal I don't know
[1:49:32] what it is he said another time he said
[1:49:34] I would have made the most horrible
[1:49:36] mistake until he came
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; he came that was the very Christ he was
[1:49:41] revealing came and and open what the
[1:49:44] seal was
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; you know for those of you that haven't
[1:49:49] thought about it this book right here
[1:49:53] happens to be 579 pages 579
[1:50:00] pages. And when he got to the end of it,
[1:50:03] he just said second from last paragraph,
[1:50:07] he said, "I can truly say that to the
[1:50:10] best of my understanding and according
[1:50:12] to the word of God and the vision and
[1:50:15] the revelation, the interpretation
[1:50:17] thereof is thus saith the Lord." Amen.
[1:50:20] You
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; know, he preached he he preached he
[1:50:23] preached uh influence several times. So
[1:50:25] as we would see Jesus and different
[1:50:27] things when he was done with this 579
[1:50:31] pages. He never went back and enlarged
[1:50:34] on any one of the subjects. He never
[1:50:37] went back and tried to correct. Can you
[1:50:40] imagine a 579
[1:50:42] page book? I challenge any theologian. I
[1:50:45] challenge the smartest man in the earth
[1:50:47] to to to speak in public for 579
[1:50:52] pages and send it to the press and say
[1:50:54] it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; We had about 5,000 people in India and
[1:51:01] we were in the Baptist compound and the
[1:51:03] this whole section right here was all
[1:51:05] Baptist theologians all in their long
[1:51:07] robes and I made that exact statement to
[1:51:10] them. I said, "Which theologian?" And I
[1:51:12] said, "We we've got a book here and
[1:51:14] there's a million books." One million
[1:51:16] books in the University of British
[1:51:18] Columbia theological department. I
[1:51:20] understand one million books. I said,
[1:51:22] "There's not one book in that in that
[1:51:25] million that compares with this book." I
[1:51:27] said, "To think that a man speaks
[1:51:29] publicly 579 pages and then puts it to
[1:51:33] press and doesn't change one thing,
[1:51:36] doesn't change one sentence, doesn't
[1:51:38] correct it, say, "I'd like to I'd like
[1:51:40] to refine that a little bit." That's a
[1:51:42] book you ought to read. That's a book
[1:51:43] that you can study. That's a book that
[1:51:46] that's a book that God intended to
[1:51:47] impact your life, your home, your entire
[1:51:51] future,
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; a holy God,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; and I'll say it, yes. A holy prophet
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; and a holy people
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; to change us and to affect us.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; We're to We've come under a an
[1:52:08] incredible influence.
[1:52:15] went up into the canyon. Can I just take
[1:52:18] a few more minutes, please?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He said, climbed as high as I could go.
[1:52:23] And I asked the Lord while sitting up
[1:52:25] there, "What all this meant?" He's still
[1:52:29] asking, "What does all this mean?"
[1:52:34] I was kind of bothered and I didn't know
[1:52:36] just what to do.
[1:52:38] And I was standing there in prayer and
[1:52:41] something happened. And now he said
[1:52:43] something fell in my hand. But something
[1:52:47] struck in my hand.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; And when I looked, it was a sword.
[1:52:53] And while holding it in my hand, a voice
[1:52:55] from somewhere said, "That's the king's
[1:52:58] sword." And then it left me. He said,
[1:53:02] "Now if it said a king's sword," he
[1:53:04] said, "I could have better understood
[1:53:05] that." said, "This is the king's sword.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; This is the word of Almighty God." Now
[1:53:16] comes a sword is for opening. Now comes
[1:53:18] the opening of God's word. The secret
[1:53:22] which he's held
[1:53:29] in the brief just a little further on
[1:53:32] said, "I'm not just making that up.
[1:53:35] That's thus say the Lord. I read it to
[1:53:36] you out of the book.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; The sounding of the seventh angel's
[1:53:40] message, the mystery of God should be
[1:53:43] finished. That's been declared by his
[1:53:45] holy prophets. That's the prophets who
[1:53:47] gave who have wrote the word at the
[1:53:50] sounding of the seventh church age, the
[1:53:54] last church age. All the loose ends that
[1:53:58] through these ages, church ages have
[1:54:00] been probed probed at will be wound up
[1:54:04] together. Just listen closely now. And
[1:54:07] when the seals are broken and the
[1:54:10] mystery is revealed, down comes And when
[1:54:14] the seals are broken and the mystery is
[1:54:17] revealed, down comes the angel, the
[1:54:21] messenger Christ setting his foot upon
[1:54:24] the land and upon the sea with a rainbow
[1:54:27] over his head. Now remember this seventh
[1:54:29] angel is on the earth at the time of
[1:54:32] this coming. Amen.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; You have lived.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Many of you people have lived
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; and you didn't know it, but Christ
[1:54:42] himself
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; came down and set one foot on the land
[1:54:46] and one foot on the sea. Hallelujah. And
[1:54:49] had a mouthpiece cuz he wasn't coming
[1:54:52] into a human vessel, but he had a
[1:54:54] mouthpiece that he could that he would
[1:54:56] come to and speak his word through that
[1:55:00] mouth.
[1:55:02] Can you say
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; You've lived.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; You've happened to live in that time.
[1:55:17] God's going to ask you.
[1:55:19] He's going to actually ask you, going to
[1:55:21] ask every one of you,
[1:55:24] what did you do? What did you do with
[1:55:26] that?
[1:55:30] You had a you have confidence in.
[1:55:38] There's something in the atmosphere of
[1:55:39] the church that causes you to come and I
[1:55:43] like to go to Bible way. Why do you like
[1:55:45] to go to Bible way? It's nothing with
[1:55:47] the name.
[1:55:49] Nothing special.
[1:55:52] All kinds of churches, bigger churches,
[1:55:53] finer churches, better singing, better
[1:55:56] preaching, all the rest of it. Why do
[1:55:58] you come? God's going to ask you. You
[1:56:01] through the doors and that's what you
[1:56:02] heard.
[1:56:04] I was trying to influence you.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to influence you on things
[1:56:10] that really matter.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to influence you on things
[1:56:13] that are above these things that are
[1:56:16] down here.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Don't be consumed. Don't be consumed
[1:56:20] with all of this riff raff because it's
[1:56:22] going to go on forever. I just say,
[1:56:24] "When is it going to stop?" It's not
[1:56:25] going to stop. It's going to carry on.
[1:56:27] How long is sin? Sin's going to go on
[1:56:29] until God is done with it.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; When am I going to have my bills all
[1:56:34] settled? When am I going to have When's
[1:56:36] this all going to When am I going to be
[1:56:37] out of pressure? You're never going to
[1:56:38] be out of pressure as long as you live
[1:56:40] down here. But I can tell you one thing.
[1:56:42] There's an influence that God has poured
[1:56:44] down into the church.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; I just came from Congo.
[1:56:53] You can write it off to however you wish
[1:56:55] to interpret it.
[1:57:01] The Congo has
[1:57:04] vacasillated between number one poorest
[1:57:06] nation to number three poorest nation.
[1:57:10] And you from the Congo,
[1:57:13] you forgive me, but I want to relate it.
[1:57:16] You drive along and there's just
[1:57:18] multitudes of people, just sea of
[1:57:20] people, many millions of people, maybe
[1:57:22] up to 10 million people in the kinshasa.
[1:57:27] And you go along and there's little
[1:57:30] rivlets of water and people picking
[1:57:33] through the scraps of paper. Boys like
[1:57:35] you fellas here picking through the
[1:57:38] scraps of paper and trying to find maybe
[1:57:40] a piece of plastic or something.
[1:57:43] You see somebody with an old tire.
[1:57:46] An old tire would mean nothing to
[1:57:48] anybody here, but they'll sit beside
[1:57:50] that tire and hope that they can find
[1:57:52] somebody to buy that tire. And then the
[1:57:55] next person is carrying a bunch of eggs
[1:57:57] on their head. They're trying to make a
[1:58:00] living.
[1:58:04] And then
[1:58:08] come the traffic was terrible. The
[1:58:10] traffic was gridlock.
[1:58:12] And the air and the pollution in the air
[1:58:14] is just it's a fog.
[1:58:18] And we come to the church. I walked into
[1:58:21] brother Dio's church just from the last
[1:58:24] three years.
[1:58:26] I think it was three years ago we were
[1:58:27] there at the opening
[1:58:30] and they had to extend it. They just
[1:58:32] took this wall out and put roof over it
[1:58:37] and made the church about 50% larger.
[1:58:40] They were seating 4,400 people before
[1:58:44] they put that out and the balcony went
[1:58:46] about halfway because it was the old
[1:58:47] balcony went all the way around like
[1:58:49] that.
[1:58:51] And I I walked into because the meetings
[1:58:53] were already in progress.
[1:58:56] There isn't even any space. There isn't
[1:58:59] they're not sitting like you are here.
[1:59:02] They're packed shouldertosh shoulder
[1:59:05] and it's just a sea of black faces.
[1:59:10] And I I tried to look from where I was
[1:59:12] sitting and he had to take the platform
[1:59:14] and he two nights before I the meeting
[1:59:18] started two nights before he had several
[1:59:20] hundred men and they removed the entire
[1:59:23] platform, smashed it out, smashed the
[1:59:25] wall out, moved it back and built some
[1:59:27] rooms on behind and finished it in just
[1:59:30] on Friday night in time for the meeting.
[1:59:32] And he thinks they maybe had a thousand
[1:59:34] men working.
[1:59:37] It was all done like in two days.
[1:59:40] and marble. They had marble on the wall
[1:59:42] and did an excellent job. And I sat on
[1:59:47] this new platform back there and I
[1:59:50] looked over to the far corner.
[1:59:52] I said, "That is that is further than a
[1:59:55] ball stadium. That's further than a
[1:59:57] football field."
[2:00:00] And you just can't even hardly make out
[2:00:02] the faces at the other end.
[2:00:07] And then
[2:00:11] at that time, three years ago, four
[2:00:13] years ago, was 1,576
[2:00:17] ministers.
[2:00:19] 1,576
[2:00:21] ministers.
[2:00:23] And they didn't even have an actual
[2:00:25] count this time, but there was around
[2:00:27] 2,700
[2:00:29] ministers, coming right on to 3,000
[2:00:32] ministers.
[2:00:36] I felt numb.
[2:00:39] I felt numb. I feel sorry for Canada and
[2:00:43] I feel sorry for the United States.
[2:00:49] We're under the curse of soft living.
[2:00:54] Those people have to walk so far and
[2:00:57] they're nicely dressed and they're
[2:00:59] clean.
[2:01:01] And when you come and they had young men
[2:01:04] and young ladies and young men in white
[2:01:06] shirts, dark trousers and a red tie and
[2:01:10] at the stadium went to the national
[2:01:12] stadium on on Saturday night.
[2:01:17] And I tried to count the attendance,
[2:01:20] just the attendance, men and women, a
[2:01:21] man, a woman, a man, a woman, a man, a
[2:01:23] woman. And I counted, as far as I could
[2:01:26] see, I counted just under 200,
[2:01:29] all young men,
[2:01:32] young ladies.
[2:01:34] Man, it just felt like heaven.
[2:01:37] I thought this is just like in heaven.
[2:01:41] And then the massive crowd they just
[2:01:44] kept flowing in flowing in and rivlets
[2:01:48] and taking their seats till in this
[2:01:50] stadium which seats 60,000 people from
[2:01:54] over here to over here was all full of
[2:01:58] people
[2:01:59] and they began to sing. Then they would
[2:02:02] have some that led in songs
[2:02:05] and their worship was heavenly.
[2:02:09] They sang in every service. Nearer my
[2:02:11] God to thee. They sang it so slow I
[2:02:14] could barely sing with them.
[2:02:18] Nearer
[2:02:23] my God
[2:02:25] to thee.
[2:02:28] Nearer
[2:02:32] to thee.
[2:02:36] You should have heard 15,000 voices.
[2:02:41] I felt like I was in heaven.
[2:02:46] Just to hear that lifting up to God.
[2:02:50] I got home and I said
[2:02:56] three years ago was 1500 ministers.
[2:03:01] Now it's 2700 ministers.
[2:03:06] every night. There wasn't even a space
[2:03:09] in the building. They said it was
[2:03:11] seating 10,000 people. You should have
[2:03:15] seen them come in trucks and vans and
[2:03:18] but they said the doors open at 8:30
[2:03:21] tomorrow morning. The meeting would end
[2:03:23] at 2 in the afternoon and then they said
[2:03:27] the service starts at 5 tonight. I don't
[2:03:30] know where the people are even going to
[2:03:32] go. don't even know where they're going
[2:03:33] to begin to eat. But you got five at
[2:03:36] night. That place you can't even find a
[2:03:38] space to sit.
[2:03:42] 10,000 people night after night after
[2:03:46] night after night and day after day
[2:03:49] after day.
[2:03:52] I'm I'm closing now. Few minutes.
[2:03:58] I said, "You know what did this?"
[2:04:02] God directed me back to this scripture
[2:04:06] influence.
[2:04:07] This one little man, Brother Deio, God
[2:04:10] bless him.
[2:04:12] And he's he's not taken up with just he
[2:04:16] couldn't even begin to talk to the
[2:04:18] people about their marital problems or
[2:04:20] about their children or raising their
[2:04:22] families or anything else. He's got he
[2:04:24] he's got one focus and that focus is get
[2:04:27] this message into the hands of the
[2:04:30] people. And as I sat in the stadium then
[2:04:32] I saw these young men. I saw lines of
[2:04:35] them carrying something and they're
[2:04:37] walking way up in the balconies and one
[2:04:40] right behind the other like a whole army
[2:04:44] and they were carrying boxes and I knew
[2:04:47] right away they're carrying message
[2:04:49] books. And there's a row over there and
[2:04:52] there's a row over here packing these
[2:04:55] message books up because there was maybe
[2:04:59] maybe thousands of people that knew
[2:05:00] nothing about the message and brother
[2:05:02] Dio got up and preached and I was really
[2:05:05] proud of him. He had ministers from all
[2:05:07] over all those preachers but he stood up
[2:05:10] there and preachers from overseas and he
[2:05:12] stood up there and preached that entire
[2:05:15] service. I just said God bless him. And
[2:05:18] he laid out the message and the
[2:05:20] messenger of this age and like like just
[2:05:23] it was absolutely perfection. And then
[2:05:25] he said,
[2:05:27] "Now we have books. We have the message
[2:05:30] in a book for you and you must take a
[2:05:33] book. Please take a book and find out
[2:05:37] these things are not true. You the books
[2:05:40] are ready for you." And he told that
[2:05:42] whole mass of people. And I tell you
[2:05:45] what, it was no it's no mystery. It's no
[2:05:47] secret that's that's that's how come
[2:05:49] Congo's under such an effect. They've
[2:05:52] made the message and I am I'm dedicated.
[2:05:55] That's been that's been the call of my
[2:05:58] heart ever since a young man and since I
[2:06:01] came in contact with the message is get
[2:06:04] this message into the hands of the
[2:06:06] people that want it, into the hands of
[2:06:08] the people that are hungry. Hallelujah.
[2:06:11] Brother Tovi, your father spoke a
[2:06:13] message. He spoke a masterpiece. Brother
[2:06:16] Caillou and I told him I said when he
[2:06:18] comes here I want him to preach that
[2:06:20] message at three take three services if
[2:06:22] he needs to but this is what is
[2:06:25] happening you say it's not sufficient
[2:06:27] for me to come and say oh this is a
[2:06:29] glamorous report of what's happening
[2:06:30] here's the pictures here's the video
[2:06:32] it's better that you don't need to see
[2:06:34] all that but see people right from
[2:06:37] children not very many children they're
[2:06:40] off in some other place but I was so
[2:06:42] impressed with young men and young
[2:06:45] women, this message is for you and it
[2:06:49] got a hold of their hearts. And if that
[2:06:52] has such what happened, what happened to
[2:06:55] the people? They don't they don't have a
[2:06:57] car to step into and drive home. They
[2:06:59] don't have a bunch of friends. They're
[2:07:01] not going to go to Earls or go to some
[2:07:02] other ungodly place. They don't have any
[2:07:04] place. They don't have the money to go
[2:07:06] there. And one pastor stood up
[2:07:10] and he said,
[2:07:12] "In America,
[2:07:15] you have wonderful roads.
[2:07:19] You have highways and freeways.
[2:07:22] In America, you have nice homes.
[2:07:27] In America,
[2:07:29] you have all of these things." And he
[2:07:30] enumerated a bunch.
[2:07:33] says in the Congo
[2:07:36] we have this
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; and that said it all.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; We have Christ,
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; we have the message
[2:07:48] and it means absolutely everything. And
[2:07:50] if you have not met him, you really need
[2:07:53] to meet him.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; If you've not come under that influence,
[2:07:58] that's the influence you need to come
[2:08:00] under. Don't let your life be influenced
[2:08:03] by the world, especially here in this
[2:08:06] country, this North America. Don't let
[2:08:09] ourselves be influenced by that. Yes, we
[2:08:13] have to work. Of course, we do. We've
[2:08:15] got to pay our bills and all the rest of
[2:08:16] it. But I say to you in the name of the
[2:08:18] Lord, you can live above that.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can live above it.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Live be godly
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; wherever you are.
[2:08:28] Be that effective influence there. Be an
[2:08:31] influence for the message. You don't
[2:08:32] have to be an influence for the church.
[2:08:34] We don't need any more members, but be
[2:08:36] an influence for the message. They'll
[2:08:38] come then wherever they need to come to
[2:08:40] be fed, but be an influence for Christ.
[2:08:42] Don't ever be ashamed of it.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[2:09:11] I want to sing in a moment.
[2:09:14] The more that I surrender, Brother Ryan,
[2:09:18] let's just bow our hearts, our heads.
[2:09:23] Father,
[2:09:26] I feel dreadfully
[2:09:30] incapable
[2:09:34] of bringing the people to where I would
[2:09:38] love to bring them
[2:09:40] and to enter also myself
[2:09:44] into that sacred sacred place
[2:09:48] lifechanging place.
[2:09:53] How Satan has crept into this
[2:09:56] pleasure-loving
[2:09:58] generation.
[2:10:03] But life won't go on forever.
[2:10:08] It will certainly end for all of us.
[2:10:12] And as you've said in your word, it's
[2:10:14] appointed unto man once to die and after
[2:10:16] this the judgment
[2:10:20] and as the songwriter said, "What then?"
[2:10:27] Lord, I
[2:10:29] I feel privileged and also feel a sense
[2:10:32] of fearful reverence at the
[2:10:35] responsibility of standing here today
[2:10:39] before the living
[2:10:43] before those that will certainly
[2:10:48] experience what your word has declared.
[2:10:53] to stand before the purchased
[2:10:56] the purchase of your blood.
[2:10:59] To think that you came and so freely
[2:11:02] gave yourself. And as I have pondered
[2:11:06] throughout this week
[2:11:08] of the divine order and how how
[2:11:12] perfectly you brought the revelation and
[2:11:15] here we are Lord
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; study for years to become engineers or
[2:11:21] accountants or or whatever more
[2:11:27] machinists and we study for years and
[2:11:30] even some of our sisters take some
[2:11:32] further education some adv advance to
[2:11:34] advance ourselves just so we can cope
[2:11:37] with life.
[2:11:40] But what about the life that's after
[2:11:43] this one?
[2:11:44] How much studying have we done? How much
[2:11:47] prayerful consideration have we given?
[2:11:50] How much advanced How much have we
[2:11:52] advanced ourselves in your word, oh God?
[2:11:56] We're not here just for a hoop and a
[2:11:58] holler. We're here, oh God, to your word
[2:12:01] sinks down into every fiber of our
[2:12:03] being, Lord. Some that have have
[2:12:07] struggled with things in their lives and
[2:12:10] Satan has bombarded them and he has no
[2:12:12] right to them. I'm standing today
[2:12:15] shielded by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:12:17] and coming against the enemy, the Satan.
[2:12:21] Satan, Lucifer, who is has been cast
[2:12:24] down to the earth but has no right in
[2:12:27] this place. Has no right with these
[2:12:30] people. Satan, you have no place in
[2:12:32] their lives. You have no place. I
[2:12:35] declare you to be a liar. I declare you
[2:12:37] to be an adversary. I declare you to be
[2:12:40] condemned. I declare your head has been
[2:12:43] crushed by my savior, by my redeemer, by
[2:12:46] my Boaz redeemer. He has crushed your
[2:12:49] head. And I declare he has purchased us.
[2:12:52] We've been purchased by the blood of the
[2:12:54] lamb. The blood was spilt. The price was
[2:12:58] paid. And we have been redeemed. We are
[2:13:01] redeemed. We can say we are redeemed by
[2:13:04] the blood of the lamb. And Satan, you
[2:13:06] cannot go beyond that veil.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Name of Jesus.
[2:13:13] I pray that every sick person will be
[2:13:15] healed
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; in this presence and atmosphere. I pray
[2:13:19] that every bound one will be set free.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; I pray that Satan's hand will be
[2:13:25] wrenched and will say, I'll quote the
[2:13:27] prophet's words, Satan, take your hands
[2:13:29] off of God's property.
[2:13:32] [Applause]
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ's name.
[2:13:39] And now people, all we need to do, all
[2:13:41] you need to do
[2:13:44] is whatever God is speaking to you,
[2:13:46] surrender to it. Not to me, to him. Just
[2:13:50] surrender to him. Surrender to him. Call
[2:13:54] out on them. Take Congo as an example.
[2:13:57] If they can do it, we can do it. If they
[2:14:00] can call out in prayer, I can open my
[2:14:03] mouth and call out in prayer. What if
[2:14:06] somebody heard me? What if you're What
[2:14:08] if you're facing death in the face? Then
[2:14:10] would you call out? Then would you call?
[2:14:12] Of course you would. Well, do it now.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; You have no guarantee of your time. You
[2:14:19] don't even know if you'll see the sunset
[2:14:21] this evening. Don't know if you'll see
[2:14:23] tomorrow morning. Call on him now while
[2:14:26] you have a chance. I beg of you. I plead
[2:14:28] with you.
[2:14:32] I don't want to look across
[2:14:35] the faces of the people and see you
[2:14:37] standing
[2:14:39] in a number of the condemned.
[2:14:42] Having poured my heart and soul out as
[2:14:46] we have now. Make your peace with God in
[2:14:49] the name of Jesus Christ. I command you
[2:14:52] to do it.
[2:14:55] Surrender now.
[2:14:57] Call upon him now.
[2:15:00] Woe is me. I'm at the end of myself. But
[2:15:05] come, oh God, lay the coal from the
[2:15:08] altar upon my lips. Let me hear you say,
[2:15:11] "Now you are purged. Now you are
[2:15:15] cleansed."
[2:15:16] [Music]
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Name of Jesus Christ, the only worthy
[2:15:22] one.
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:30] The more
[2:15:32] that I surrender
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:40] my Lord,
[2:15:44] the more that I
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:54] control.
[2:15:56] [Music]
[2:16:09] every day.
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Confess it to him as we sing it again
[2:16:21] and make it a prayer of your heart.
[2:16:25] I surrender.
[2:16:32] [Music]
[2:16:36] The more that I
[2:16:39] release my cares,
[2:16:43] the more
[2:16:45] control
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:12] There are some that may need to go,
[2:17:16] but there are others that may need to
[2:17:18] pray.
[2:17:20] You may need to take a step. You may
[2:17:23] need to make a move.
[2:17:25] You may need to declare
[2:17:28] in your action.
[2:17:31] You may want to stand here. You may need
[2:17:33] prayer. You may want someone to pray
[2:17:35] with you. We've got men of God.
[2:17:40] We're going to sing the chorus just once
[2:17:43] again.
[2:17:45] And by coming standing, kneeling,
[2:17:49] you'll be saying, "The more that I
[2:17:51] surrender,
[2:17:53] the more I surrender myself,
[2:17:56] the more he'll lift me up." You'll be
[2:17:58] saying, "Oh Lord, what I need, I need to
[2:18:01] be lifted up. I need to be set free. I
[2:18:04] need to lay that thing down."
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Is the congregation with me?
[2:18:12] Are you pulling with your faith now?
[2:18:17] The more that I
[2:18:20] surrender,
[2:18:22] [Music]
[2:18:29] [Music]

[2:19:20] Make this a different moment.

[2:35:10] [Music]
[2:35:21] [Music]
[2:35:28] Father, we love you this morning, Lord.
[2:35:32] Father, we love to come into your
[2:35:34] presence this way, Lord.
[2:35:37] Father, and we're so
[2:35:40] in contact with our humanity, Lord, and
[2:35:42] our need for you this morning, Father,
[2:35:46] and for you, Father, as a father, to
[2:35:48] come among us and speak to our hearts
[2:35:50] this way this morning, Father.
[2:35:53] Lord, you know the desires that were on
[2:35:55] our hearts coming into service this
[2:35:57] morning.
[2:35:58] Father, to touch you and to be led by
[2:36:01] you.
[2:36:03] And Father, you're so faithful to come
[2:36:05] among us, Lord, and speak to our hearts.
[2:36:09] We worship you this morning, Lord.
[2:36:12] From the bottom of our hearts, Father,
[2:36:14] we just wanted to offer a sacrifice of
[2:36:17] worship unto you this morning, Lord.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Because you're so worthy, Lord.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Father, when we look at how you've
[2:36:26] blessed us, Lord,
[2:36:29] you've touched us when we're sick.
[2:36:32] Lord, you've lifted us up, Lord, when
[2:36:35] we've been ins snared by the enemy,
[2:36:37] Lord. And you've set us free to worship
[2:36:39] you this morning, oh God.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; Father, you've saved our children.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've saved our souls, God. We
[2:36:49] don't even know what more to ask for in
[2:36:51] our lives, oh God.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Father, but that you would lead us,
[2:36:56] Lord.
[2:36:58] Father, we want to find our place in
[2:37:00] your kingdom, Lord. Father, to make our
[2:37:03] lives effective, Lord,
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; lead us, Father. That's our desire this
[2:37:09] morning, Lord.
[2:37:11] Lord, that you'd help us just to lay
[2:37:13] down the cares of this life, Father. And
[2:37:16] that our lives, Father, would be so
[2:37:18] wrapped up in you and would just be,
[2:37:22] Father, so led by you to be effective
[2:37:24] for your kingdom, Lord.
[2:37:26] We thank you for your word this morning.
[2:37:29] We thank you for your presence. We thank
[2:37:32] you, Father, for your servant this
[2:37:33] morning that sets himself aside. Lord,
[2:37:36] return his strength. We pray. Lead us
[2:37:39] and guide us, Lord. We pray in Jesus
[2:37:42] name. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:37:49] Amen.
[2:37:50] God bless you. We love him and we love
[2:37:54] one another.
[2:37:57] You're dismissed in the name of Jesus
[2:37:59] Christ. May this presence go with you
[2:38:02] and we see you on no service tonight
[2:38:07] on Wednesday
