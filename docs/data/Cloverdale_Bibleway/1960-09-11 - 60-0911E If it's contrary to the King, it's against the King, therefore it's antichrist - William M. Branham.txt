Description:
60-0911E Five Definite Identifications Of The True Church-2 : William Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now Christ is ahead of this Christ is ahead of this Messianic Kingdom and you can not organize a kingdom of which Christ is the head you cannot denominate a kingdom which Christ is the head amen hallelujah because Christ is King and you cannot take the intellectuals of a man and make an organization to which Christ will govern amen therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of God is going contrary to the king and if they're going contrary to the king it would be against the king so if it's against the king it would be an antichrist amen yes Hallelujah that's pretty rough if I had just a little more voice we' make that clear but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
