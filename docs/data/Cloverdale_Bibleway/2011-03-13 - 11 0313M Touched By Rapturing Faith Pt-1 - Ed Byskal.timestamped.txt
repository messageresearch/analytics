[9:27] [Music]
[9:29] With that chorus on our hearts this
[9:31] morning, it's Brother Ken Andes to come
[9:33] and lead us in prayer this morning.
[9:34] Brother Ken,
[9:36] Sister Violet Laws wants to thank the
[9:38] Lord for touching her grandson Payton as
[9:42] he is out of the hospital. We give
[9:44] thanks for that. I understand that
[9:46] brother Wes Nygard is now home
[9:49] recovering. The Lord has touched him and
[9:51] been very faithful to our brother Wes.
[9:54] Thank you each one for your prayers and
[9:56] I know the Nikard family certainly does.
[9:58] Sister Jessica and the boys, God bless
[10:01] you. Want to remember brother Luis in
[10:04] Argentina as she's going to a meeting
[10:06] with the mayor
[10:09] in there in Argentina in regards to
[10:11] having a church built. They're asking
[10:13] that the Lord would allow them to find
[10:16] favor in their eyes. Also, there's a
[10:19] brother Jose. He's a believer in the
[10:21] area. He's had a five-month-old son
[10:24] that's uh was born premature and has not
[10:27] developed according to uh I believe his
[10:30] feet in his spine there's complications.
[10:32] So just asking that the Lord would touch
[10:35] the little one. Amen. Our God is
[10:37] faithful.
[10:39] Every bat of an atsai, every sparrow
[10:42] that would fall from the sky and those
[10:45] that were made in his likeness, he knows
[10:47] even more so. Amen. We want to remember
[10:51] uh brother H on behalf of brother
[10:53] Matthew Redell Carlos. I'm not going to
[10:57] challenge the last name. He's a
[10:58] Spanish-sp speakaking man. Uh Sister
[11:01] Marie spoke with yesterday very much in
[11:04] need of God. We committed him today to
[11:07] pray for him today. So we will do that.
[11:11] God bless those that were in Richmond
[11:13] yesterday. All those that prayed. The
[11:16] seeds have been sown. Amen.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; It's up to the Lord to bring the
[11:19] increase. Amen.
[11:22] Brother Andy's, if you have a need on
[11:23] your heart this morning, something you
[11:25] desire a touch from the Lord, why don't
[11:27] you just lift it up before him as we go
[11:29] to prayer.
[11:31] Let us pray.
[11:35] Our dear heavenly father, we count it a
[11:36] great privilege to be in your presence
[11:38] this morning and that you have joined
[11:41] yourself unto your elect at this place.
[11:45] We thank you, Lord, for these
[11:46] testimonies that's been read, the many
[11:49] victories that you have won. We've
[11:52] agreed with you. We've agreed with your
[11:54] word, and you have done wonderfully.
[11:58] We thank you for these healings and
[12:00] deliverances that's been read, friends
[12:02] and loved ones, the elect
[12:06] sinners that we've prayed for and even
[12:09] the effort la yesterday reaching out
[12:13] with a testimony in this community. We
[12:15] pray, heavenly father, that every word
[12:17] that was spoken by the young people and
[12:21] individuals of this church yesterday
[12:24] will bear into the conscience of each
[12:27] one that was spoken to. Every piece of
[12:30] literature that was given, Lord, we pray
[12:32] that it will find its place in the soil
[12:36] of a life and that the elect will
[12:39] continue to come to you. We believe
[12:41] heavenly father that you are very
[12:44] concerned
[12:45] of for your own work for what you intend
[12:49] to achieve and are doing on the earth
[12:51] today. We're thankful to be a part of
[12:54] that and we know that you will give
[12:56] increase to the word. Hallelujah. And
[13:00] father for the requests that were read.
[13:02] We pray that you'll go forth around the
[13:04] world where we have been praying for
[13:06] brother Louise. pray that you'll give
[13:08] him success for the kingdom of God, be
[13:11] able to achieve this uh property to
[13:15] build a church for you. And amidst all
[13:17] of the devastation around the earth
[13:19] because of the uh tidal waves, tsunami,
[13:24] earthquakes, disasters,
[13:26] protect your elect, Lord.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Keep them safe in the midst of it all.
[13:31] May we go forward. May we see the
[13:35] advancement of the gospel of Jesus
[13:38] Christ in every community, every
[13:40] language, every nation around the world.
[13:44] Father, we ask for your anointing upon
[13:46] this service as so many have prayed for
[13:48] it. Ask your anointing upon our pastor
[13:51] as he delivers the words of life to us.
[13:55] Lord Jesus, meet our needs as families
[13:57] and individuals and out on the internet
[13:59] where this is going.
[14:01] May your perfect will be done. We commit
[14:04] ourselves to you for your glory and for
[14:07] your honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:09] Christ. Amen.
[14:11] [Music]
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Why don't you turn around
[14:16] and shake hands with somebody this

[14:20] the house of the Lord."
[14:23] Amen. You may have your seats.
[14:26] I want to welcome all those that are on
[14:28] the internet
[14:29] streaming hookup, the telephone hookup.
[14:31] Say God bless you to you as well. Sister
[14:34] Patricia,
[14:36] I've got a special this morning. Natasha
[14:38] and Sister Leah are going to come and
[14:40] bless us with a special. And as they
[14:42] come,
[14:44] got a couple of other announcements to
[14:45] let you know about. Just real happy to
[14:47] be in the house of the Lord this
[14:48] morning.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; How many were able to go to the BCA? I'm
[14:52] going to do a Tim Dodd to you, so just
[14:54] be ready. How many were able to go to
[14:56] the BCA concert on on uh Friday evening?
[15:01] The rest of you, shame on you.
[15:05] I love that. That was really cute.
[15:06] Brother Tim did that to me. And I felt
[15:09] so convicted. I'm trying to go there. I
[15:10] really am. I'm I'm actually going to try
[15:12] and go there next month and drive in the
[15:14] cold all the way up to Grand Prairie
[15:17] from that one comment two years ago,
[15:19] probably. So it was a really really
[15:21] wonderful time we had with the the the
[15:24] uh school and the they've come a really
[15:27] long ways and their the talents that
[15:29] have been cultivated in the children. So
[15:32] we also want to remind those that can
[15:34] volunteer to help with the school
[15:36] building project to continue your
[15:38] efforts and those that can labor with
[15:41] helping to provide the meals for the
[15:43] brothers that are working there. I can
[15:44] honestly tell you that it's a privilege
[15:47] and it's a blessing to feed those that
[15:48] are building the building. We're all an
[15:51] integral part of the body. We're going
[15:54] to have a baptismal service this
[15:55] evening. So, if the Lord's been dealing
[15:57] with your heart and you haven't taken
[16:00] that step, how many can confess that
[16:03] that step is the next step?
[16:06] &gt;&gt; That's the next step. So, just trust we
[16:08] have a real wonderful time this evening.

[30:06] word. If we have something else we're
[30:08] looking for, we're looking in the wrong
[30:10] direction, we just need to change our
[30:12] focus this morning. Amen.
[30:18] One day
[30:22] every eye will behold him.
[30:29] lifted a cry and he is exalted.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; We will be holy.
[30:42] [Music]
[30:45] Ooh, and one day
[30:50] all that supports him will crumble.
[30:57] Every man be made humble.
[31:04] We will behold
[31:07] the king.
[31:13] Oh, and one day
[31:18] all who have waited will see him.
[31:25] We who have pray.

[32:26] heartache and suffering will look
[32:30] forward to that place.
[32:33] sickness and favor.
[32:36] Just think of that future home
[32:40] as we as we look upon.
[32:45] [Music]
[32:48] Hallelujah.
[32:50] One day
[32:54] will be

[36:48] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[36:52] Hallelujah. As we stand together this
[36:54] morning, invite our pastor to come.

[39:02] &gt;&gt; We lift you up now, Lord.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; We will not wait, but we lift you up
[39:08] now, oh God.
[39:11] We praise your holy name.
[39:16] Worthy one, the only worthy one.
[39:19] There's so no flesh glory in your
[39:21] presence. You're the only worthy one.
[39:25] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, how we thank you for
[39:32] this time,
[39:34] &gt;&gt; that we can just be gathered here.
[39:37] And we ask that you will be high and
[39:39] lifted up
[39:42] &gt;&gt; and that the Holy Spirit will take our
[39:45] souls and lift them up into heavenly
[39:48] places in Christ Jesus.
[39:51] Let your word become a quickened word.
[39:54] Let your people become an enlightened
[39:56] people.
[39:58] May the scales fall off of the eyes of
[40:00] those that still have scales on them.
[40:03] May the hearts that are be t made
[40:06] tender, oh God,
[40:08] &gt;&gt; make us pliable and flexible and
[40:10] yielding.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; May everyone yield to the Holy Spirit in
[40:15] the name of Jesus Christ. and all those
[40:18] that are streaming at this time, that
[40:21] congregation of people, oh God, may your
[40:24] Holy Spirit sweep in amongst them,
[40:27] &gt;&gt; and do the supernatural things, oh God,
[40:30] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name, for his glory alone.
[40:34] Anoint now your word, Lord,
[40:36] &gt;&gt; the speaker, the hearers, in Jesus
[40:39] Christ's name.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just so good to be in the house of
[40:46] God and hear the young people sing.
[40:49] Sister Jenny, that was wonderful. The
[40:52] school, those that play and whatever
[40:55] more. Uh you have to fill up the rest of
[40:58] these places. So work diligently
[41:02] &gt;&gt; and learn to yield to the Holy Spirit
[41:05] and play for the glory of God and sing
[41:07] for the glory of God. You don't have to
[41:09] be, you know, professional. You just
[41:12] have to be yielded.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; God bless all the men that worked and
[41:19] labored. You know, we say the school the
[41:21] school. I want to say you'll be there.
[41:25] You'll you'll
[41:28] benefit from the place. We'll be able to
[41:30] have our meetings which we haven't been
[41:32] able to. There's sometimes we have
[41:34] gatherings that
[41:37] gatherings of fellowship. We don't have
[41:38] room in the fellowship room and we've
[41:41] been I've been really desiring that they
[41:45] get over they call it the gymnasium for
[41:46] me. It's going to be a place where the
[41:48] saints can gather and we will use it for
[41:52] the glory of God.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray that your children will
[41:57] be taught. I will want to say that I and
[42:00] my wife uh we don't have children that
[42:04] are in school. We don't have
[42:05] grandchildren that are in school. But
[42:07] I'm very very committed to the school to
[42:12] the teachers because I don't know
[42:14] another place that has such devoted
[42:18] Holy Ghost messagebelieving
[42:21] teachers that will teach and instruct
[42:24] the children. And can you believe that
[42:26] your children do not have to hear
[42:29] cursing
[42:31] &gt;&gt; and the Lord's name in vain?
[42:34] I I had to go to that kind of a school
[42:36] and many of you have but if we don't
[42:39] have to and this is being provided I
[42:43] think we should make every use of it
[42:45] &gt;&gt; and if you say well I can't afford it
[42:47] get another job it's more important for
[42:50] that your children would be able to have
[42:52] that kind of an atmosphere than even for
[42:55] your daily food it's more important
[42:57] because they're taking those things in
[42:59] and the schools today friends don't mind
[43:02] saying it this is public, but they're
[43:04] corrupt places. That's
[43:05] &gt;&gt; right.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; A principal right over here at a school
[43:08] within a mile of this church told my
[43:11] wife, he said, "I don't have time to be
[43:13] a principal." He said, "I am a
[43:15] counselor." He said, "There's such
[43:18] trouble amongst the children." He said,
[43:20] "I have a boy and we are in we're in
[43:23] some final exams." And he says, "I have
[43:25] a young man at probably 14, 15 years
[43:28] old. He's been sleeping in his car for 3
[43:31] weeks because of the trouble that
[43:33] they're having in their home. And he
[43:35] said, "And he's supposed to be here and
[43:37] study and have exams." He said, "You
[43:39] know, can you imagine? Our homes aren't
[43:43] like that.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; This church message believers are not
[43:48] like that. And we're not just good
[43:49] families. That's not it. It's what we
[43:52] believe."
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:56] This morning, I'd like to just prepare
[43:57] you for the message before we read. Some
[44:01] have been saying, "What's happening?
[44:04] Something is happening." I hear that
[44:06] phrase frequently. Well, if you listen
[44:09] real close this morning, I think that
[44:12] you'll I pray I really pray that you'll
[44:16] be able to
[44:18] grasp a little bit of what's happening.
[44:22] And uh
[44:24] I just uh I I don't want to feel like
[44:28] I'm I don't want you to feel or think
[44:31] that I'm reaching way out into
[44:35] uh no man's land, but I want to take
[44:38] some things out of the out of the
[44:39] message. You know, the message
[44:42] really is somewhat mystical
[44:46] and uh and and I want to continue on. I
[44:50] started with who touched me and who
[44:52] touched me part two and uh the second
[44:56] time we touched on that or spoke on that
[44:59] subject I I really felt something
[45:02] different happening with myself and uh
[45:05] and I think many here perhaps have felt
[45:08] so and so I want to make statements
[45:11] today probably not preach the way I
[45:14] would normally preach but I would like
[45:16] you to take and ponder those statements
[45:18] and if something uh something really
[45:21] speaks to you, jot it down. That's fine.
[45:24] Uh quite a few asked for the notes and
[45:26] the slides that I had and we had them
[45:29] copied and those of you that had wanted
[45:30] them, we've given them to you. And we're
[45:33] going to read out of the Bible in just a
[45:36] moment out of Romans, out of the book of
[45:38] Romans. And then keep your Bibles handy
[45:41] for I have quite a lengthy reading in
[45:44] just a few moments. But while you're
[45:46] turning,
[45:48] can I give you a testimony that came uh
[45:52] a brother wrote us uh on the through the
[45:56] ad admin office uh on the website and to
[46:01] pray for his his sister and she had a a
[46:06] growth
[46:08] uh tumor and a and a and cancer and was
[46:12] bleeding. And here I received this on
[46:15] the 10th of March. This is the 13th, so
[46:18] three days ago. Dear Pastor Ed, I would
[46:23] like to give you some feedback on the
[46:25] prayer request below.
[46:27] My sister
[46:29] Lavina went for more tests last week and
[46:33] the doctors were confused. Number one,
[46:36] the mass was disappearing.
[46:39] Number two, there was no more traces of
[46:42] cancer.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Number three, the bleeding has stopped
[46:46] now for over a week. Number four, her
[46:50] blood pressure, which was which
[46:52] constantly sat at about 200 over 140, is
[46:57] now down to just 140 over 80.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; All of this has happened without
[47:02] medication or any form of treatment
[47:05] being administered. Thank you for your
[47:08] prayers and may God bless you and all
[47:10] that is dear to you. Uh and he signed
[47:13] it. I say glory be to God. People say
[47:17] what is happening. There are things
[47:19] happening and I I attribute that to this
[47:21] brother's faith. I believe that God saw
[47:24] his faith and I just said God all the
[47:26] glory be to you.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Things are happening just
[47:30] over the over the streaming friends.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; This brother's probably streaming right
[47:35] now. And I say, "God bless you, brother
[47:37] Kalin." Hallelujah. God bless anybody
[47:40] has a faith to raise their hand. It
[47:42] takes faith to walk down the aisle. It
[47:45] takes faith
[47:46] &gt;&gt; to believe the word of God. It takes
[47:48] faith.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; We serve a supernatural God.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:55] Hallelujah. We thank you, Lord. Romans
[47:57] the 10th chapter,
[48:00] starting at verse 14.
[48:08] God bless you, brother Matthew Redell,
[48:10] and all the group that went out
[48:12] witnessing. That's just wonderful. You
[48:15] sent pictures, but my Blackberry said
[48:17] it's trunciated, which I assume that big
[48:20] word means there's too much to get on
[48:23] there, but we'll see them on our uh
[48:28] on our computer when we get home.
[48:32] How then shall they call on him in whom
[48:35] they have not believed? And how shall
[48:38] they believe in him in whom they have
[48:40] not heard? And how shall they hear
[48:44] without a preacher?
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And how shall they preach except they be
[48:48] sent?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; As it is written, how beautiful are the
[48:51] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[48:53] peace and bring glad tidings of good
[48:56] things.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[49:00] For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath
[49:03] believed our report, so then faith
[49:07] cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
[49:10] word of God.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Just have your seats quietly, and hold
[49:16] your Bibles open if you would, please.
[49:20] And we'll just keep as focused as
[49:22] possible. Ask God to just give you a
[49:27] special revelation.
[49:31] So then faith cometh by hearing and
[49:33] hearing by the word of God.
[49:36] Or I shall say, or how or how and what
[49:40] shall they preach if the book is still
[49:44] sealed with mysteries? Right.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Faith for the rapture
[49:52] can only come by the preaching of those
[49:55] divinely
[49:56] revealed mystery truths.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; A phrase which brother Brandham gave to
[50:02] it.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Faith for the rapture can only come by
[50:06] those divinely revealed mystery truths
[50:10] made known in this hour in the opening
[50:14] of the sealed. Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Many have claimed to have opened the
[50:18] seals,
[50:20] &gt;&gt; but no one has opened the seals but the
[50:22] lamb himself.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And and he had to have a validated voice
[50:28] &gt;&gt; and messenger and vessel on the earth.
[50:31] And as the prophet said, all the other
[50:33] church age messengers could be
[50:36] reformers, but the last one had to be
[50:39] prophet.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; There can be because he he's the only
[50:44] one. He's born that way so that God can
[50:47] bypass his mental faculties and speak
[50:52] thus sayith the Lord
[50:55] &gt;&gt; in a leady church age. He speaks to the
[50:58] messenger identifying the messenger of
[51:00] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 tying the
[51:05] two together
[51:07] &gt;&gt; is going to do two things. Number one,
[51:11] according to Malachi, he will turn the
[51:15] hearts of the children to the fathers.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Now, if you are those people, then your
[51:20] hearts have been turned back to the
[51:24] faith of the fathers.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And number two, he will reveal the
[51:29] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[51:33] Revelation 10. Notice now closely the
[51:36] seven thunders which are the revelations
[51:40] contained in the seven seals. So the
[51:43] seven thunders aren't some mysterious
[51:45] thing that builds some special group of
[51:48] people. It has nothing to do with that.
[51:51] It's accessible to every believer. The
[51:54] seven thunders are the voices or the
[51:57] mysteries. And all you have to do is
[52:00] remember two words. It was sealed. Those
[52:03] things were sealed with with a seal and
[52:07] the mystery was the seal as long as it
[52:10] remained a mystery that kept it sealed.
[52:13] But as soon as God would send a his his
[52:16] messenger and and and make known the
[52:20] mystery, then it became a thunder
[52:22] because it was a voice. That's so simple
[52:25] any child can understand that. So it was
[52:28] sealed with a mystery and revealed in
[52:31] the thunder or revealed. He said, "Let's
[52:33] the thunder is a symbol. Let's find out
[52:35] what the thunder is." And he goes back
[52:37] into John's gospel where a voice said,
[52:39] "This is my beloved son." A voice spake.
[52:42] Uh, I have glorified it and we'll
[52:44] glorify it again. And some thought it
[52:47] thundered. Brother Brandham said,
[52:48] "That's the symbol. It's a voice of
[52:50] God." And when a prophet speaks, it's a
[52:53] voice of God. So those were the seven
[52:56] thunders which was revealing the seven
[52:58] seals. Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Simple, isn't it?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; And glorious, isn't it?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; So, he will do those two things. Now,
[53:09] &gt;&gt; at the time of the resurrection, I'm
[53:12] getting into some swimming water here,
[53:16] and I pray that the Holy Spirit will
[53:18] take you and give you
[53:22] some of the things that I've been
[53:24] experiencing at the time of the
[53:26] resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[53:33] Just so everyone is settled, you need to
[53:36] get these. At the time of the
[53:38] resurrection of Jesus Christ, the
[53:42] virginborn son of God,
[53:45] Jesus
[53:46] stays with the little group
[53:49] of believers
[53:51] &gt;&gt; at the time of the resurrection. He
[53:53] stays with the little group of believers
[53:56] and guides them through the event
[53:59] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection
[54:01] &gt;&gt; until they understand
[54:04] what has taken place.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus didn't always do that, but at
[54:09] the resurrection, at the time of the
[54:12] resurrection in Luke 24, he stays with
[54:16] the little group of believers until they
[54:19] understand what has taken place.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in our day,
[54:26] God raised up a redeemed son.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Not a virgin-born son, but a redeemed
[54:33] son
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and he was redeemed by the virginborn
[54:39] son
[54:43] &gt;&gt; as we all have. Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; But he raised up he raises up his
[54:48] vessels and he raised up a redeemed son
[54:51] by the virginborn son and through a life
[54:54] of sorrows brought him to adoption.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; That through him Jesus Christ would
[55:02] reveal himself again fulfilling Luke
[55:06] 17:30.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the true Easter seal, the
[55:12] prophet says, "And if he can reveal to
[55:15] me by his holy spirit," speaking to a
[55:18] woman, now that woman could be any woman
[55:21] here or any person here, speaking to
[55:24] her, he said, "By the Holy Spirit, the
[55:26] resurrected Christ who come here and
[55:30] give me a temporarily resurrection
[55:34] &gt;&gt; by my spirit."
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. that my spirit goes away now
[55:40] &gt;&gt; and his spirit comes in
[55:43] &gt;&gt; then to let you know whether he's alive
[55:46] or not.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; That's why he comes in into that level
[55:50] of ministry to let the individual who is
[55:53] needing who's touching him to let her
[55:56] know that he's alive and present there
[55:59] right at that moment.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; He says I don't know you and that's me
[56:04] and my spirit. me and my spirit. We
[56:07] don't know you. He said, those are his
[56:09] words. But he knows you and he wants to
[56:13] borrow my body
[56:15] &gt;&gt; to prove that he's the resurrected
[56:17] Christ
[56:19] &gt;&gt; and I'm so happy to loan it to him to
[56:22] give it to him anything he can get out
[56:24] of it.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; And so we find that there's a a a level
[56:28] of something that was taking place
[56:31] having a temporarily resurrection. And
[56:34] he talks about through the church ages
[56:37] that the church has been given a
[56:39] temporary resurrection.
[56:42] Temporary resurrection through the
[56:44] church ages. Temporary. But you and I
[56:48] are to come to the fullness of the word.
[56:51] When the book is open and the mysteries
[56:54] of God are being declared and are being
[56:57] preached, then faith cometh by hearing
[57:01] and hearing by the word of God. Now the
[57:04] reason why you have a son a virginborn
[57:06] son and at a certain time and the it is
[57:10] written he knew exactly where it would
[57:12] be written that's Jesus Christ of
[57:14] Nazareth now he's resurrected and he is
[57:18] with his believers uh now there are
[57:20] there are difference of prophecies there
[57:23] are some prophecies which took uh maybe
[57:26] years or centuries or days to come to
[57:29] fulfillment and the prophecies
[57:31] concerning the life of and death of
[57:33] Jesus Christ uh was over a period of
[57:36] even hundreds of years but the
[57:39] fulfillment happened in a relatively
[57:41] short time. And then Jesus spoke to his
[57:44] disciples and said that he would be
[57:46] slain and killed of the leaders and
[57:48] would rise up the third day. He said it
[57:51] very very clearly. They couldn't grasp
[57:53] it. And now the third day and they're
[57:55] even telling this stranger and now is
[57:58] the third day already. And so they had
[58:01] absorbed some things but could not put
[58:04] it together. And now in the revealing of
[58:07] the son of man in our time in your day,
[58:11] God allowed things to be uh spoken and
[58:15] written for a people. Now, the reason
[58:18] why it even went on tape and the voice
[58:21] went on tape is that there was going to
[58:23] be a people coming up that needed to
[58:25] hear that voice
[58:28] &gt;&gt; and those people would produce it or
[58:30] publish it and send it all through the
[58:32] world. And I'm so glad today that I can
[58:35] say to you if I was to tell you friends
[58:37] what was happening. We call it the
[58:39] message hub. Just forget that. I I call
[58:41] it this morning a voice from heaven.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. a voice from heaven.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And there's been no vindicated voice
[58:50] like that in the entire New Testament
[58:54] period. And since Adam set foot and
[58:57] walked on earth, there has been no time
[59:00] when science has been able to put a
[59:02] prophet's voice in the heavens.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Now all prophets voices went into the
[59:08] heavens. Your voice goes out. It's
[59:10] recorded forever. Listen friends. Now
[59:13] you have come to a season. You've come
[59:15] to a season you put some earbuds in your
[59:17] ears and pick up things and but now this
[59:20] time we're receiving a voice that's
[59:22] accessible by almost anybody from from
[59:26] heaven.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; And that's the first time that voice has
[59:28] been accessible from heaven.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; A voice from heaven.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Why would it come at this season?
[59:39] Because it must come. that kind of a
[59:42] voice has to come at this season and he
[59:45] goes and this prophet messenger goes to
[59:48] this very scripture Luke 20 Luke 24 and
[59:52] calls it a prophecy.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Now the reason why Jesus stayed with
[59:58] those disciples and stayed with that
[1:00:01] little group
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; so it could be recorded in Luke 24. He
[1:00:05] stayed with them through that chapter
[1:00:08] and he said the prophet said unto you
[1:00:11] that's a prophecy and so Jesus back
[1:00:14] there when the prophecy was to be laid
[1:00:16] out
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; that was a prophecy to be laid out to be
[1:00:20] fulfilled over here. And so when it was
[1:00:23] being laid out it it cannot it cannot be
[1:00:27] uh something that cannot be reconciled
[1:00:29] with the fulfillment. It has to be laid
[1:00:31] out exactly as it's going to be
[1:00:32] fulfilled. And so when it's being laid
[1:00:35] out, Jesus stayed with those disciples.
[1:00:38] He he often left people in bewilderment.
[1:00:41] They didn't understand. But he stayed
[1:00:43] with that little group till they
[1:00:45] understood what he was saying
[1:00:49] and furthermore what had happened.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why they had they they saw
[1:00:55] him and and then they couldn't
[1:00:58] understand and they didn't know who he
[1:00:59] was. as we'll be going through it
[1:01:01] because I want to speak to you uh kind
[1:01:03] of on the context that it's reading
[1:01:06] between the lines
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; and reading between the lines is not
[1:01:10] getting a new doctrine.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Reading between the lines calls for a
[1:01:14] relationship. Brother Brandham says when
[1:01:17] I'm overseas my wife reads sends me a
[1:01:20] letter says oh Billy I put the children
[1:01:22] to bed and and I gave Joseph a kiss for
[1:01:25] you and so on. He's reading between the
[1:01:27] lines and he sees a little teardrop on
[1:01:30] the piece of paper. And you cannot read
[1:01:33] between the lines without first having a
[1:01:35] relationship.
[1:01:37] It's not some mechanical thing. It's
[1:01:39] something from the heart. It's something
[1:01:41] from a love relationship. You have to
[1:01:44] enter into a love relationship. And I'm
[1:01:47] urging you this morning to come on into
[1:01:49] this love relationship. Don't sit here
[1:01:52] that this is a Sunday morning service
[1:01:53] and after a little while we're going to
[1:01:55] go home. It's not that kind of a
[1:01:57] meeting. It's a relationship service.
[1:02:00] The Holy Spirit is calling you into a
[1:02:03] relationship so that you can read
[1:02:05] between the lines of the prophecy.
[1:02:09] [Applause]
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And he had to be very very specific. And
[1:02:17] Jesus was specific. And he stayed with
[1:02:20] the two on the way to Emmas and went to
[1:02:23] their house and broke bread till they
[1:02:26] understood that it was him.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; And then they ran and we'll be getting
[1:02:32] into it later. They ran and to tell the
[1:02:34] others that he's risen and what the
[1:02:36] ladies what the women saw and and and uh
[1:02:40] and and what Peter and they had run to
[1:02:42] the tomb and so on. But they come to the
[1:02:44] apostles and then he enters the room.
[1:02:47] Now it looks like a spirit. Now put
[1:02:50] yourself there.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Put yourself there.
[1:02:55] If that's a prophecy,
[1:02:58] some of you may well
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; experience some things that you don't
[1:03:03] understand. It has to happen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Things can't go on like this forever.
[1:03:11] Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And if you believe those are you're the
[1:03:14] that people,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; then it may well be you
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; or me.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Prophecy
[1:03:33] I I I just have to slow myself down.
[1:03:37] Prophecy is time sensitive. Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Remember that prophecy is timesensitive.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It can be read,
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; studied,
[1:03:51] believed.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; But when it begins to be fulfilled,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; most often the ful most often the
[1:03:59] fulfillment passes by without the people
[1:04:03] know what's happening. Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want you I don't have to tell
[1:04:09] you that you're privileged, but you're
[1:04:11] highly honored
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; to even be able to hear these things
[1:04:15] that God has sent in this time. You're
[1:04:17] highly honored that the message ever
[1:04:19] came your way.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; None of us are worthy of it, friends.
[1:04:22] Not one of us are worthy of it. We're so
[1:04:25] honored that God chose you and let the
[1:04:27] message come by your way.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[1:04:38] and this is in Matthew, and his
[1:04:39] disciples asked him, saying, Why then
[1:04:42] say the scribes, that Elias must first
[1:04:44] come.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:04:47] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:04:50] all things, but I say unto you, that
[1:04:52] Elias has come already. And they knew
[1:04:55] him not, but have done unto him
[1:04:58] whatsoever they listed. Likewise also
[1:05:00] shall the Son of Man suffer of them. So
[1:05:03] he's come already, but they knew it not.
[1:05:05] Then the disciples, then
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; the disciples understood.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; That he spake of John the Baptist
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; and they've already seen John the
[1:05:14] Baptist and the whole thing has passed.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; But then they understood.
[1:05:20] Brother Brandham says, "And they didn't
[1:05:22] know who John was, who John the Baptist
[1:05:24] was until they beheaded him."
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; The disciples didn't even know him. The
[1:05:30] disciples said, "Why does the scribe say
[1:05:32] that Elias must first come?" And Jesus
[1:05:35] said, "He's come already and you didn't
[1:05:36] know it." You see how it went right
[1:05:39] through
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; and they can be in the midst. The people
[1:05:42] can be in the midst as it was in the
[1:05:44] resurrection. But the resurrection,
[1:05:46] friends, is a different kind of
[1:05:48] fulfillment. They were right in in their
[1:05:51] daily lives.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. the women
[1:05:55] Joseph of Arythea and perhaps I won't
[1:05:58] have time to read it all I wanted to but
[1:06:01] Joseph of Arythea was a rich man and and
[1:06:04] he also was a secret believer the Bible
[1:06:07] says he believed he was also a disciple
[1:06:10] of Jesus and he went to Pilate because
[1:06:13] he had that kind of a position he went
[1:06:15] to Pilate and he begged the Bible says
[1:06:17] the body of Jesus and he wrapped it in
[1:06:20] linen and placed it in his own new tomb,
[1:06:24] a human tomb wherein no man had ever
[1:06:26] laid. And he placed it. That's what he
[1:06:29] thought of the Lord. Now, that's just
[1:06:30] what he was doing. This was his tomb,
[1:06:32] and it was all just a very natural
[1:06:34] event. And then the women who had been
[1:06:37] uh just you women. They were just doing
[1:06:41] their natural things. We always bring
[1:06:44] spices. And now the day of preparation
[1:06:47] which is was Friday because then as soon
[1:06:50] as the Sabbath comes they can't do
[1:06:51] anything like that and so they made
[1:06:53] their preparation
[1:06:56] and then had to wait over the Sabbath
[1:06:58] and early on the first day of the week
[1:07:01] they didn't they didn't have any
[1:07:03] revelation well he has to raise on the
[1:07:05] first day of the week. This is a new
[1:07:07] beginning. This is a the first day of
[1:07:09] the week is the beginning
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; is it?
[1:07:14] We're here
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; on the first day of week.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're here because we're
[1:07:20] testifying to a resurrection.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's why we gather on the Lord's day.
[1:07:24] This is the Lord's day.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And so they went there. Just natural.
[1:07:29] They went with their spices. They went
[1:07:32] to and there's angels and there's two
[1:07:35] men in shining garments. And we know who
[1:07:38] you seek. Jesus of Nazareth. He's not
[1:07:40] here. He's risen as he said.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Right. and they look in and see the
[1:07:45] place where he laid and he's not there.
[1:07:48] Listen, friends, this is you.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Read between the lines.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; You're going to experience some very,
[1:07:55] very
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; unusual things.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And Mary lingers behind and she sees a
[1:08:03] man.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; He looks like a gardener.
[1:08:08] So now
[1:08:10] this other dimension
[1:08:13] is something that's beyond our capacity
[1:08:17] to grasp entirely. But yet we should
[1:08:19] read between the lines.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; If a prophet said that this is a
[1:08:25] prophecy, I think that we should just
[1:08:27] conclude and put it across the page.
[1:08:29] This is a prophecy
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and a prophecy must be fulfilled. And if
[1:08:35] you believe that that was a virgin-born
[1:08:37] son that laid down the prophecy and then
[1:08:40] he sent an adopted redeemed son in a
[1:08:44] prophet's office to gather a group of
[1:08:47] people who believe that message and are
[1:08:50] committed to it. Then we ought to be
[1:08:52] able to grasp don't let this pass
[1:08:54] through us.
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:09:06] in modern events, which is one of the
[1:09:08] last messages.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; And if I'd say this with respect, he
[1:09:13] says to all my brethren and sisters in
[1:09:15] Christ, one of these days somebody's
[1:09:19] going to say, "Isn't it written that
[1:09:22] these things should happen first?"
[1:09:24] And when I highlighted that, I prayed
[1:09:27] and said, "God,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; don't let me be speaking to anybody
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; that's going to fulfill that prophecy."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; One of these days, somebody's going to
[1:09:38] say,
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; "Don't let it be you.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be you, my brother, my
[1:09:44] sister.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to you. Look at me.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be you.
[1:09:51] that's been spoken by a prophet.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to say it.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Wasn't this to happen?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; We don't want to say that. We want to
[1:10:02] say, "I know it's happening. I know
[1:10:04] something's happening. I may not
[1:10:06] understand it, but I know it's
[1:10:09] happening. And I know that I'm called to
[1:10:11] be in it."
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; at some point in time. It's going to
[1:10:26] happen. And you say, "Well, what if it
[1:10:27] doesn't happen while I'm alive?" At
[1:10:29] least you must die in the faith.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; You must die believing.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly,
[1:10:40] I cannot see how God would send this
[1:10:44] kind of a message and messenger at such
[1:10:47] a unique time. Having prophesied so many
[1:10:50] things, if I have time, I will give you
[1:10:53] some wording
[1:10:56] concerning what he said about
[1:10:57] earthquakes
[1:10:59] and the one in that will take place in
[1:11:02] California and particularly Los Angeles
[1:11:05] and where they've discovered faults that
[1:11:08] they didn't even know existed. And it's
[1:11:11] right under Hollywood.
[1:11:13] Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Furthermore,
[1:11:16] the ocean will weep its way into the
[1:11:19] desert.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Weep its way. It'll be a sorrowful
[1:11:23] time." And if you've seen the surreal
[1:11:27] pictures and clips of video and the news
[1:11:32] of the ocean weeping its way into Japan,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; there's one one one small city of 17,000
[1:11:41] with 9,500
[1:11:43] people still unaccounted for.
[1:11:47] And they're trying to search over the
[1:11:49] rubble. half of the population of a
[1:11:53] goodsized town and they're gone. As far
[1:11:56] as they know, they're gone. They can't
[1:11:58] find it. They haven't found a life. I
[1:12:00] will say you want to see coming up those
[1:12:03] valleys
[1:12:04] and uh and and uh the news reporter
[1:12:07] standing three miles
[1:12:10] from the ocean and there's the boats and
[1:12:13] there's the there's the trucks, great
[1:12:16] big highway trucks that carried it right
[1:12:19] from the ocean all the way in three
[1:12:21] miles. I don't know how far it went in.
[1:12:23] Brother Brandham says it'll weep its way
[1:12:25] into the salt and sea
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; and you want to believe it.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And one in New Zealand and then with
[1:12:35] within a few months another one in New
[1:12:37] Zealand and then one here and one there
[1:12:40] and one off the coast of British
[1:12:42] Columbia, a small one. And then Japan is
[1:12:45] is constantly rumbling. And as a they
[1:12:48] interviewed the people from over there,
[1:12:50] they said, "Well, you get accustomed to
[1:12:51] this. Things are rattling all the time."
[1:12:54] But the prophet of God makes different
[1:12:58] declarations. He talks about the lava.
[1:13:01] He talks about, you know, that this
[1:13:03] earthquake knocked the earth off its
[1:13:05] axis by 10 cm
[1:13:08] and sped the spinning of the earth up
[1:13:10] momentarily because of it convuls. This
[1:13:14] this prophet talks about this. He's not
[1:13:16] talking scientific terms. He says the
[1:13:18] earth will convulse.
[1:13:21] It's the creator
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; and the ocean will weep its way into the
[1:13:25] desert and people say well it'll be felt
[1:13:28] clean back to Tucson or or whatever
[1:13:30] more. Do you realize that when they
[1:13:33] largest earthquake which was a 9 point
[1:13:35] something in Anchorage which he
[1:13:37] prophesied judgment coming down the west
[1:13:40] coast prophesied that before it happened
[1:13:43] and it happens on Good Friday.
[1:13:46] Some of these things should mean
[1:13:48] something.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; And the water bounced in the wells in
[1:13:52] Florida, probably 5,000 miles away, 17
[1:13:56] ft,
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; convulsed. The earth convulsing like
[1:14:01] that.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Two men were fishing on a pond and the
[1:14:05] earth when it convulsed just sucked up
[1:14:07] the water and found themselves in their
[1:14:08] boat sitting in the mud.
[1:14:12] Say, friends,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to come down and draw
[1:14:15] us little pictures.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; He speaks through a voice.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "You either
[1:14:21] take it or just leave it."
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You just take it or believe it.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And believe it or just forget it.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to play. It's all right. If
[1:14:32] you're just in some denomination, you
[1:14:33] want to go and listen to the band or the
[1:14:36] choir or whatever more. And I thank God
[1:14:38] for what we have. But that's not why
[1:14:40] we're here. We're not here to be
[1:14:42] entertained. And we're not here to catch
[1:14:44] some human spirit. I'm That's why I
[1:14:46] thought I'll preach different this
[1:14:47] morning. I want to just lay it out line
[1:14:50] by line, have you absorb it, and have
[1:14:53] you consider what is being said.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] One of these days somebody's going to
[1:15:05] say, "Isn't it written that these things
[1:15:07] should happen first?" And it'll be the
[1:15:09] same way it was then. Verily, verily, I
[1:15:13] say unto you, he's already come and they
[1:15:16] they did what they listed to him.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when they asked him why the
[1:15:22] scribes say the scriptures say that
[1:15:24] Elias must first come, they said that
[1:15:28] they said that to Jesus and he said he's
[1:15:31] come already and you didn't know him.
[1:15:34] And that's perhaps the way it'll end up
[1:15:36] again.
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So he's drawing from that. He says, "And
[1:15:42] now I want to be posted. I want now he
[1:15:47] said we want to be posted to know what's
[1:15:50] to take place for this age that we live
[1:15:53] in.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; That is said for us.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; This is a lesson friends. I'm not up
[1:15:58] here just to preach up here to give also
[1:16:02] instruction that you will remember it.
[1:16:05] You learn in school and then you go out
[1:16:06] from school and apply it. You come here
[1:16:09] this morning and now when you go home, I
[1:16:13] pray that God will give you such a sense
[1:16:15] that you will apply this.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, make me sensitive.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let me look at the world the
[1:16:22] way I looked at it before.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Don't let me look at my job the way I
[1:16:26] looked at it before. Let me keep my eyes
[1:16:29] heavenward.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Let me be consumed with this whole thing
[1:16:35] that you're making real. Don't let me
[1:16:38] just say something's happening, but let
[1:16:40] me at least be clued in and know
[1:16:42] something is happening in me.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Luke 24 is a prophecy of our time.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Modern events, he called it, modern
[1:16:55] events are made clear
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; by the prophecy.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; So when you take it and if you have not
[1:17:04] and you young people, this is a lesson
[1:17:06] for you. lesson you can do this week.
[1:17:09] You take Luke 24 you and read it and
[1:17:12] then take uh modern events are made
[1:17:16] clear by the prophecy if you have not
[1:17:18] read it. I've been speaking out of it
[1:17:20] and perhaps we'll speak yet because I
[1:17:22] won't finish this morning but speak out
[1:17:24] of it again. And when you read it, don't
[1:17:27] read it like a book.
[1:17:30] read it and read between the lines
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; and say, "What is my Lord Jesus seeking
[1:17:36] to convey? What's he trying to tell me?"
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Not trying to strive with it or trying
[1:17:42] to figure it out. But first, before you
[1:17:45] even read, enter into a relationship.
[1:17:48] I have I've gone to the back of the
[1:17:51] message books to to because I love when
[1:17:56] he was so tender and tell people and
[1:17:59] I've been speaking who touched me and
[1:18:01] tell people uh of their back ailment or
[1:18:06] tell them that they have a person on
[1:18:08] their heart and it's an unsaved son or
[1:18:11] tell them I can only look up and say oh
[1:18:15] God my Lord Jesus My redeemer,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; my lover,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; my healer,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; how you must love your children. I don't
[1:18:25] feel worthy of it, but you care for
[1:18:27] every little thing. But now what is
[1:18:30] touching and moving me is I desire and
[1:18:33] I've been speaking to you the last
[1:18:35] service hunger and yearning when there
[1:18:37] wasn't one that I can find in 30 years
[1:18:41] of min 33 years of ministry. I can't
[1:18:43] find one where the Lord Jesus spoke out
[1:18:46] of the messenger's mouth and said to
[1:18:48] them, "There's one thing that you crave
[1:18:50] above all others. You do have some
[1:18:52] physical things, but that's not really
[1:18:54] why you're here. You're here because you
[1:18:57] want to have a confirmation that you are
[1:19:00] one of the raptured saints. You're going
[1:19:03] to go in the rapture. You're hungering
[1:19:06] and yearning for the resurrection."
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, what's wrong with
[1:19:10] having that as a desire?
[1:19:13] I want to see the resurrection.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I don't care if I have a pain in my knee
[1:19:18] or a pain in my back. That's not why I
[1:19:21] want to touch him. I want to touch him
[1:19:24] with such a strong feeling. I want to be
[1:19:26] in the resurrection.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with the saints.
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] What could possibly equal that?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Larry, my wife,
[1:19:55] I often tried to get her to come and sit
[1:19:57] closer to the front.
[1:20:00] I'd like you to sit closer to the front.
[1:20:02] No, she said, "I I sit beside Sister
[1:20:06] Mary.
[1:20:10] and she's hard of hearing
[1:20:12] and I help her find the place in the
[1:20:14] Bible where we're reading
[1:20:18] and uh when we heard she was gone.
[1:20:23] She said I miss her.
[1:20:26] They didn't have a lot of conversation
[1:20:28] said, "I miss her." And furthermore,
[1:20:32] I'm waiting for a beautiful young woman.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; To walk in
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and to sit down beside me. I fully I'm
[1:20:41] looking for that. You know what,
[1:20:44] friends? Whether that happens or
[1:20:45] somebody says, "Well, that's kind of
[1:20:46] foolish. They said that about Brother
[1:20:48] Brandham."
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And those people never got a thing.
[1:20:54] Right.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; But those that believed,
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; whether they received anything or not is
[1:21:01] irrelevant
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; because they were believing for the
[1:21:04] supernatural, they're believing for the
[1:21:05] eternal. We're believing for the
[1:21:07] heavenly.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Whether you have a physical or an
[1:21:13] emotional or whatever kind of an
[1:21:15] ailment, that's not the thing this
[1:21:17] morning. What the thing has to be
[1:21:18] prominent in your mind. I'm going to be
[1:21:21] part of this resurrection and I'm going
[1:21:23] to think about it. I'm going to I'm
[1:21:25] going to ponder it. I'm going to I'm
[1:21:26] going to let my mind be captivated by
[1:21:29] it. It's going to be on my mind.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you get so heavenly
[1:21:33] good, so heavenly minded that you're no
[1:21:35] earthly good." I say, "Amen."
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Let's try it out.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; We've been so earthly minded sometimes
[1:21:47] for no heavenly good. Let's be so
[1:21:49] heavenly minded for no earthly good.
[1:21:59] One of the outstanding aspects of this
[1:22:01] prophecy, Luke 20, Luke 24, is that
[1:22:04] those who were ordained
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; to be part of it,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; were passing right through it without
[1:22:11] recognizing it.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Except for the extra measure
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; of the personal presence of Jesus Christ
[1:22:21] with them.
[1:22:23] However, this must not happen. It could
[1:22:25] not happen back then. They could not
[1:22:28] miss it. It could not pass through them
[1:22:30] without them knowing because these
[1:22:33] disciples were chosen to reflect those
[1:22:37] chosen in the end time to be the
[1:22:40] fulfillment of this prophecy.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; So, they had to go. They had to move.
[1:22:47] That's why he stayed with them. It it is
[1:22:49] as though his actions were his actions
[1:22:52] the actions of Jesus was I'm staying
[1:22:54] with you.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to continue with you.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Now let me read between the lines.
[1:23:03] The Bible says and Jesus himself
[1:23:06] drew near
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; in the prophecy
[1:23:11] in this day
[1:23:14] he raised up a prophet sir. So Jesus
[1:23:18] himself
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; could draw near to a group of people.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; So now we've got that far.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself. And then the Bible says,
[1:23:28] "And he went with them."
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; They had some journey in the prophecy
[1:23:37] and you have some journey between the
[1:23:39] lines in the fulfillment. And he has
[1:23:43] gone with you.
[1:23:46] Hallelujah.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He went with them.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Not so they could go to church, not so
[1:23:52] they could have another miracle, not so
[1:23:54] they could feed the uh feed 5,000. That
[1:23:57] wasn't it. That was over.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; He went with them so that they could not
[1:24:04] miss who he was
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; and what had happened.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And he was in another dimension.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; He was in another dimension. back then
[1:24:16] in the prophecy and he was in another
[1:24:18] dimension here again.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; There was a prophecy
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; but he went with them.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; He has gone with you.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And they continued to be sad and
[1:24:35] confused and reasoning between
[1:24:38] themselves. And we have done exactly the
[1:24:41] same.
[1:24:43] Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; They continued to talk about the things
[1:24:47] that had happened. They were talking
[1:24:49] about the Pharisees and talking about uh
[1:24:52] the misjudgment they made on and talking
[1:24:55] about how he was crucified and talking
[1:24:57] about their hopes and and their
[1:24:59] ambition. We thought there's going to be
[1:25:00] a rapture. We thought there's going to
[1:25:02] be a resurrection. We thought he was
[1:25:04] going to deliver Israel. They had to fix
[1:25:06] their mind. We thought we're going to be
[1:25:08] free from Rome.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That wasn't it.
[1:25:13] And he's he he wants them to move
[1:25:15] through and make the prophecy accurate.
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be another
[1:25:23] people rise up at another time when this
[1:25:26] when I'm going to be revealed again. And
[1:25:28] this people are going to live it out.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; They've got to fulfill it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] And so he stayed with them and listened
[1:25:44] to them.
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; We thought there's going to be a
[1:25:50] resurrection. We thought there's going
[1:25:51] to be we thought there's going to be a
[1:25:52] great revival. And he just goes along
[1:25:54] with them and walks with them.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And he's and he came right in this
[1:26:00] generation from another dimension, the
[1:26:02] same one.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet saying year after year
[1:26:06] after year, he's here, he's here, he's
[1:26:08] here, he's here. How many times does he
[1:26:11] need to say it?
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; That same one is here this morning.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; He's indeed here.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; He's heard your conversation.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; He's listened to all of the hopes and
[1:26:35] aspirations and and disappointments.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] He's listened to it all.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; But they didn't have they weren't clued
[1:26:46] in.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; They didn't have their priorities right
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; and they continued to walk till they got
[1:26:57] to their place. He went with them.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; He walked right to their house.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; We're reading between the lines. He
[1:27:08] walked right to your house.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; He listened to you all the time.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. In the previous ministry, he healed
[1:27:18] their sick.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He healed Peter's mother-in-law from the
[1:27:22] fever. He touched her
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; and the fever left.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He has done all these things. He done
[1:27:28] these things we give these testimonies
[1:27:29] for. He's done all of that. But this is
[1:27:32] a little different era.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; If this is my last service, don't forget
[1:27:40] it.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; This is a different time.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; The things we allowed in the past and
[1:27:47] occupied our minds with, let it
[1:27:50] disappear.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean anything
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; in relationship. Go ahead, go to school,
[1:28:00] get your education, go to work, pay your
[1:28:03] bills. That's not why you're here.
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And so he goes to their house.
[1:28:23] It's supper time.
[1:28:25] He goes in.
[1:28:28] He'll sit down.
[1:28:30] He'll be a guest.
[1:28:33] He knows they still don't know.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; They still don't know.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; I'm in their house. They still don't
[1:28:39] know.
[1:28:40] And the Bible says these men,
[1:28:45] they said, "And the women that are in
[1:28:47] our church, the women from our group,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; they heard they went to the tomb,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; And they went to the sephilic
[1:28:59] and saw the angels and whatever these
[1:29:02] people, and him they saw not."
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:09] And these two men are looking at him.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Then
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; then,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; he begin to expound
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; unto them out of the scripture. It was
[1:29:23] as though he had had enough.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I heard all about your whimpering. I
[1:29:28] heard all about your sadness. I heard
[1:29:30] all about your disappointments. I heard
[1:29:33] all about your spiritual expectation
[1:29:35] that apparently didn't happen. And here
[1:29:37] they were right in the resurrection.
[1:29:40] They're in the greatest moment of
[1:29:42] history.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; You talk about being thick, friends, no
[1:29:47] wonder he said, "Oh fools
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; and slow to believe all the prophets
[1:29:52] have spoken."
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; And I say to this waiting congregation,
[1:29:58] let us not be foolish and forget what
[1:30:00] has been spoken.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And when they said that they didn't see
[1:30:10] him, they were looking for him. And him
[1:30:13] they saw not
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; and they were looking at him.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And it was though he couldn't hold his
[1:30:22] peace any longer. He said, "Then
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; he began to expound out of the
[1:30:27] scriptures
[1:30:29] all the things that were written
[1:30:31] concerning himself." And beginning at
[1:30:34] Moses,
[1:30:36] beginning back in 1947,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and beginning back in 48,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; and he begin to expound on the things
[1:30:44] that he has done in this generation once
[1:30:48] again.
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And he told him about the first pull and
[1:30:53] told him about the second pull and told
[1:30:56] them and it was the same one all the
[1:30:58] time.
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; But this is a different time, friends.
[1:31:02] Listen to me.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; You're in a You're in a resurrection
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; era
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; The resurrection is our time.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Those that saw and spoke with Jesus
[1:31:26] after the resurrection did not
[1:31:29] immediately understand what was taking
[1:31:31] place. Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And certainly did not know that they
[1:31:36] were in the middle of and a part of the
[1:31:41] greatest event in history to that time.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; For the graves were opened, Matthew
[1:31:49] records.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And many bodies of the saints which
[1:31:53] slept arose.
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. While they're walking in their
[1:31:59] sadness,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; paradise has already been emptied.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Think of the event, friends.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Think of the event. And surely the Lord
[1:32:09] Jesus Christ was declaring they must not
[1:32:13] miss this because they are part of a
[1:32:16] prophecy
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; and there's going to come a people
[1:32:20] that's going to fulfill it.
[1:32:23] [Applause]
[1:32:26] There's going to come a people
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to
[1:32:32] draw to myself.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; In a love relationship
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; and I will not just be redeemer but I
[1:32:42] will be their bridegroom.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And then I will take them as husband
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; and I will pregnantate them with my own
[1:32:52] seed. Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And they will begin to understand
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; what it is that's taking place. And we
[1:32:59] will enter into such a deep intimate
[1:33:03] relationship.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; And then I will whisper my secrets to
[1:33:07] her
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; and she will not just come to church,
[1:33:11] but she will enter into a relationship
[1:33:14] with me.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And I will gather her to myself.
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:21] [Applause]
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:30] Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my dove.
[1:33:37] Thou art in the cliff of the rock,
[1:33:41] in the secret place of the stairs
[1:33:45] that the that David spoke about in
[1:33:49] Psalms 27
[1:33:51] that the prophet of God, the Lord Jesus
[1:33:55] Christ, taking him in this day, leading
[1:33:59] him to Psalms 27
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; in the secret of his tabernacle. And in
[1:34:06] the stairs speaks of it and it is here
[1:34:09] in this relationship in the secret
[1:34:12] places of the stairs. Let me see thy
[1:34:16] countenance.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; She is saying the bride is saying let me
[1:34:21] see your countenance.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Let me hear your voice for sweet is thy
[1:34:29] voice. Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And to hear is not only to listen and
[1:34:32] obey, but with attention and with
[1:34:34] interest.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; And when I'm speaking to you this
[1:34:38] morning, you're being very attentive.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And I want you to listen with keen
[1:34:43] interest
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; because I feel I feel very unusually
[1:34:50] directed
[1:34:52] and I have been thinking about crossing
[1:34:54] over myself. You might say, "Oh, well,
[1:34:56] yeah, you're you're up in years and
[1:34:59] you're old and you can expect that
[1:35:01] there's going to be young people like
[1:35:03] you, young fellas sitting here that's
[1:35:05] going to go into the rapture, into the
[1:35:07] resurrection, and just one breath away,
[1:35:09] you're 21, and I'm 21.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:18] Hallelujah.
[1:35:22] Mary saw his beaten, brutalized body.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; She saw the crown of thorns.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; She saw the bleeding and the blood and
[1:35:33] and something so gory it would be hard
[1:35:35] for a person to take in.
[1:35:38] She viewed all of that
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; and she saw him three days later
[1:35:42] standing in the same garden and he
[1:35:45] looked like a young man
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; that was a gardener
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; and he had so changed that she couldn't
[1:35:52] tell from his appearance it was the same
[1:35:54] one. She was only a few hours away from
[1:35:57] that experience.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; She saw him gasping for She saw him die.
[1:36:04] That's right.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; She saw him carried to the tomb.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; How can you turn it around so quick?
[1:36:12] That's the prophecy.
[1:36:14] [Applause]
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; I want to ask this congregation, who's
[1:36:17] the fulfillment?
[1:36:23] Who's the fulfillment?
[1:36:25] [Applause]
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; We ought to say a sea of hands.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; I'm the fulfillment.
[1:36:33] It must be fulfilled.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I am here as a part of the fulfillment.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; God honor your hands. God honor the
[1:36:42] heart of faith.
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And if you're not certain,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; don't leave these doors till you know
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; you're part of it.
[1:37:02] You think people aren't being warned?
[1:37:04] They were warned in Japan.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Buildings were trembling and they were
[1:37:11] warned and they got one strong one and
[1:37:15] generally they get weaker but it got
[1:37:17] stronger. The next one was stronger
[1:37:20] and then came 8.9.
[1:37:23] They're expecting him to go less and
[1:37:25] less. It doesn't go according to
[1:37:27] people's expectations.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Almighty God, creator of heavens and
[1:37:33] earth, he allowed happen whatever
[1:37:34] happened.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; But there will be a day
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said that the earth will
[1:37:39] burst open
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; and the lava will flow
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; and Los Angeles will sink. California
[1:37:46] will slide into the ocean.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Many of you were younger when Dr. Dr.
[1:37:52] Joseph Dr. uh Jacobs stood here and
[1:37:56] described the earth's crust and he is a
[1:37:59] he is a a professor University of Madras
[1:38:03] on the earth's crust and he described
[1:38:05] the actual formation of the crust under
[1:38:09] the city of Los Angeles and said that
[1:38:12] there's a and now perhaps I did I just
[1:38:14] say this a few days ago and there's a a
[1:38:16] segment he said the best he could
[1:38:19] describe it he gave it his technical
[1:38:21] term but he said the best way to
[1:38:23] describe desri the substance that is
[1:38:25] under California is it is like a
[1:38:28] graphite it's very very smooth and slick
[1:38:31] and he said that's a part of the earth's
[1:38:33] formation and then it comes to the like
[1:38:35] solid rock and whatever and he said when
[1:38:38] that earthquake comes he said that can
[1:38:41] only slide into the ocean the language
[1:38:44] he said brother Brandham used is
[1:38:45] precisely correct it not because the
[1:38:48] science was proving it but because God
[1:38:50] almighty knew it was that way and he who
[1:38:53] created all things. He caused and he's
[1:38:56] the one who spoke. Thus sayith the Lord,
[1:38:59] the city of the angels that call
[1:39:00] yourself the city of angels shall go
[1:39:03] down and be buried in the depths as
[1:39:05] Capernium was.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And we say, well, will we be here when
[1:39:12] it happens or won't we be here? That's
[1:39:14] irrelevant.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You can be right in the middle.
[1:39:27] I mean, give me the Arctic, give me the
[1:39:29] mosquitoes, give me Vancouver, or give
[1:39:32] me any place. Give me Saskatchewan or
[1:39:34] the Midwest, but don't give me where a
[1:39:36] prophet of God has said that's what's
[1:39:38] going to happen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; But even that, I don't move around cuz
[1:39:44] I'm scared or filled with fear. God has
[1:39:46] put us here. We're here for a witness
[1:39:49] and we'll be a witness until we're taken
[1:39:52] in a rapture.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; But we shall be taken in the rapture.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, I'll meet you
[1:40:00] in the rapture.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; You ready to sing, Brother Kim?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in the rapture.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; He said your voice.
[1:40:23] Let me hear your voice.
[1:40:26] We have
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; maybe you just heard brother Brandham's
[1:40:30] voice.
[1:40:35] I tell you as your brother and whatever
[1:40:38] I am to you, I heard his voice.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Even every time. And that's why it
[1:40:49] touches me
[1:40:51] when he says there's a sister and she's
[1:40:54] sitting right here on the edge
[1:40:58] in one place.
[1:41:01] And he says he talks about the
[1:41:02] vindication being
[1:41:06] such proof.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] And I think the people
[1:41:12] were having a time
[1:41:15] believing
[1:41:17] in that service
[1:41:22] and it was in Phoenix
[1:41:26] and he said to my left is a woman and
[1:41:28] she's scared.
[1:41:31] She's afraid that she's got cancer.
[1:41:35] Now what has happened? How can he say
[1:41:36] that? because somebody
[1:41:40] is touching
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; the high priest
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; and the feeling of her infirmities
[1:41:47] has touched him
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; and I've been preaching to you now this
[1:41:50] is my second week let your craving and
[1:41:55] hunger and desperation
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I cannot miss the resurrection
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; either I will be resurrected if I die I
[1:42:07] will go in the faith,
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; but I will be holding it in front of me.
[1:42:11] And the only thing I want to do is to
[1:42:13] touch him
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; so that he will be able to reaffirm and
[1:42:16] confirm back to me. What you want is is
[1:42:20] to be in the rapture. What you want is a
[1:42:22] change of this body. What you want, what
[1:42:25] you crave above all things
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; is to be cut away.
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] She's very shook up about it. I hope she
[1:42:44] don't miss it.
[1:42:51] And I hope
[1:42:54] no one misses it.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:59] Listen
[1:43:01] friends, I said this would be a
[1:43:02] different service.
[1:43:05] If you miss it,
[1:43:08] you will not be able to lay brother
[1:43:09] Biscll to blame.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; I'm saying it clearer than I could ever
[1:43:14] say it.
[1:43:20] Don't miss it.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; She had already touched. She had already
[1:43:25] reached through. She had already touched
[1:43:27] the high priest. Yes.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Was already identifying her
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; and telling her that what her fear was
[1:43:34] and what she was scared of.
[1:43:40] And he said, "The lady's name is Mrs.
[1:43:42] Bach."
[1:43:44] And he said, "And a lady by the name of
[1:43:46] Mrs. Hershey,
[1:43:49] don't forget God came to prove
[1:43:52] that son innocent. She was concerned
[1:43:55] about her son and the guilt of her son."
[1:43:58] and says that God came to prove that son
[1:44:00] innocent if you'll believe with all your
[1:44:03] heart. A lady sitting over here into the
[1:44:05] side of my right suffering with heart
[1:44:07] trouble. Mrs. Cloud,
[1:44:10] a lady way back to my right, right hand
[1:44:14] row, dark dress on. Mrs. Yates, believe
[1:44:17] with all your heart. Mrs. Cloud, Mrs.
[1:44:20] Hershey, Mrs. Yates, one after the
[1:44:22] other. How could they miss it? How could
[1:44:24] anybody miss it?
[1:44:30] He called your name.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; When that's something that struck you
[1:44:36] and spoke you. There wasn't a man.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; There wasn't a there wasn't brother Tom
[1:44:40] or
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Diggs or Brother John,
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Ken Andes, Brother Villanova, or
[1:44:47] myself.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; When that something is coming there to
[1:44:51] you personally, that is him calling your
[1:44:54] name. Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And the graves were open and many bodies
[1:45:04] of the saints which slept and came out
[1:45:06] of the graves after his resurrection and
[1:45:09] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:45:12] unto many.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; And it didn't even give us a a a record
[1:45:16] of it.
[1:45:18] And now he said in power of God faith
[1:45:21] cometh by hearing but hearing but
[1:45:24] hearing is not faith.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing but hearing is
[1:45:31] not faith. He said a loaf of bread is
[1:45:33] purchased for 25 cents as way back then.
[1:45:36] But 25 cents is not the loaf of bread.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; It's only the thing to get you there.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing. How could we
[1:45:47] hear if the book was still sealed?
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; How could we hear a sealed book?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; The mysteries of God,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; the Godhead. You didn't understand the
[1:45:57] Godhead till the message came.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand the tribulation.
[1:46:02] You didn't understand the theophony. Who
[1:46:05] spoke about the theophony? How many here
[1:46:08] went to another church before you came
[1:46:10] to the message? Raise your hand.
[1:46:13] A lot of you didn't go to any church.
[1:46:14] Did you ever hear of any theophies
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; about the theophony? Raise your hand.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; You heard it in the church.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; You heard it in the church because
[1:46:25] you're Greek.
[1:46:28] That's part of the reason.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; We didn't hear the theophonyy's right
[1:46:37] beside us.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; We didn't hear it's one breath away.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; We didn't hear it's our word body. We
[1:46:44] didn't hear we're going to go to it.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And that is why when Jesus was
[1:46:48] resurrected, they couldn't say couldn't
[1:46:51] understand him. They couldn't see him.
[1:46:52] And he walks with them. So to to Mary,
[1:46:56] he's like a gardener.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; To the two on the way to Emmas, he was a
[1:47:01] stranger.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; A little while later, when he's trying
[1:47:05] to make it more clear, he's a spirit.
[1:47:10] And so Mary, she wants to take and show
[1:47:13] me where the body is
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; to the two on the way to Emmas. He's
[1:47:19] like a stranger and they're just talking
[1:47:20] to him as a are you a stranger? You
[1:47:22] don't know what's happened? Well, we'll
[1:47:24] tell you
[1:47:26] a little while. And he didn't want them
[1:47:28] he didn't want Mary in her state. He
[1:47:31] didn't want the two on the way to Emmas
[1:47:33] on in their state. And a little while
[1:47:35] later when they're running and saying
[1:47:37] he's resurrected and he appears and
[1:47:40] they're terrified, he didn't want them
[1:47:41] terrified either. So he doesn't want you
[1:47:44] ignorant. He doesn't want you confused.
[1:47:46] And he doesn't want you terrified. He
[1:47:48] wants you to know what's happening.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; He said hearing only brings the word
[1:48:12] that produces the faith.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; There can be no hearing if there's an
[1:48:18] absence of the word.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; If there's no hearing, there will be no
[1:48:25] faith. Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; So that is why he said and dealt with
[1:48:31] rapturing faith as he journeyed through
[1:48:34] it was it wasn't William Brham it's the
[1:48:37] Lord Jesus Christ in his ministry giving
[1:48:40] him his ministry and telling him in his
[1:48:43] early ministry that we don't have enough
[1:48:45] faith to be healed. How do we have
[1:48:47] enough faith for the rapture?
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; But I want you to listen now. Some
[1:48:51] people major on that. I'm not majoring
[1:48:53] on that. I'm going to go on down in his
[1:48:56] ministry till he says this will bring
[1:48:57] the rapturing faith.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Prophecies. Behold the day come.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:12] My time is slipping away.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Behold the day come say the Lord that I
[1:49:16] will send a famine in the land. Not a
[1:49:19] famine of bread
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; or a thirst for water, but of hearing
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Of hearing the word of the Lord.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Because they won't have the word of the
[1:49:29] Lord to speak.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; They have the word of the seminary.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; They have the word of human human study.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; And I just said, "Oh God, we don't want
[1:49:40] just a human study.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I study here. I wait on. But I keep this
[1:49:44] message before me. I want to be
[1:49:47] saturated
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; with what God would vindicated
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; a famine which is a drastic
[1:50:02] shortage
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; of the word
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; and they shall wander from sea to sea
[1:50:10] and from north even to the east and they
[1:50:13] shall run to and fro and seek the word
[1:50:16] of the Lord.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And shall not find it.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? And shall not
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; find it.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; They'll wander. They'll stagger. They'll
[1:50:27] tremble. They'll be unstable.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; This is a prophecy.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; A prophecy can be fulfilled very
[1:50:34] quickly, as I said at the beginning, or
[1:50:36] over a long period of time. And the
[1:50:39] prophecies concerning the coming of
[1:50:41] Christ as the Messiah were spoken over
[1:50:43] hundreds of years that they were
[1:50:45] fulfilled in just a very short time, a
[1:50:48] very few years. And some of them were
[1:50:50] happening so quickly.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, Jesus said, "When the Son
[1:50:55] of Man cometh, shall he find faith on
[1:50:58] the earth?" And brother Brandham puts it
[1:51:00] the faith on the earth.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Because the word, he says, nevertheless,
[1:51:05] he refers to it in anointed ones at the
[1:51:07] end time. Now he said, now that's the
[1:51:10] question.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Will he find faith on the earth? That's
[1:51:14] the question.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 said, now notice he ties
[1:51:19] the two together. Please get it in the
[1:51:22] lesson. In the days of the message of
[1:51:24] the seventh angel, the mystery of God
[1:51:27] should be finished.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Here's the question.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; If you follow in the line of this hour,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; will it be finished? Amen.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Will it be finished? Will I find faith?
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Will I find faith? Will it be finished?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; The messenger,
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; the the messenger to whom the mystery
[1:51:49] was revealed must preach and declare the
[1:51:53] whole mystery of God.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; But even when he was here on earth, he's
[1:51:57] saying, "Shall I find faith? Shall I
[1:52:00] find thee faith on the earth?" And the
[1:52:02] and then when he comes, he says, "Will
[1:52:04] it be finished?"
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:07] Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Will Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this
[1:52:11] time?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Restore the faith of the children back
[1:52:14] to the faith of the farmer father's the
[1:52:17] original word.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Shall he find the faith on the earth?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Hearing is not
[1:52:25] just the mechanics of the sound striking
[1:52:28] the eard drum.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; That's not the hearing he's speaking
[1:52:33] about. It is the attention to what is
[1:52:37] delivered.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; How much attention? That's why we
[1:52:44] preach
[1:52:46] young men especially to you.
[1:52:51] Young fathers,
[1:52:53] especially to you,
[1:52:56] spiritual heads
[1:52:59] in your home.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. those that will be accountable
[1:53:04] to God for your wives
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; and your family.
[1:53:13] Hear attention to what is delivered.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; The act of hearing attentively.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And so those of you that are preparing,
[1:53:23] you're preparing maybe further
[1:53:25] education. Fine. But this is this is a
[1:53:29] higher education right here. Hallelujah.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; It's a higher education.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; I don't make all parents responsible for
[1:53:40] all decisions that their children make.
[1:53:45] But you are responsible to live an
[1:53:48] example.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; So that you can call that son or that
[1:53:52] daughter
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; and said, "I live the example before
[1:53:55] you."
[1:53:56] Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And my God is the God
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; and this is the faith
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; and this is the word that brings the
[1:54:09] resurrection and the rapture.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Can I take a few more minutes, please?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; When the bride says, "And sweet is thy
[1:54:20] voice."
[1:54:22] Sweet is thy voice. That's very
[1:54:24] interesting
[1:54:26] in the Hebrew
[1:54:28] it's we say sweet first it is to be
[1:54:31] pleasant but it comes from a second word
[1:54:35] and the real real that gives it the
[1:54:37] depth and its meaning and the second
[1:54:40] word that is a it's a in gathering and
[1:54:44] the harvest it will take you a moment to
[1:54:46] think about it
[1:54:48] sweet is thy voice
[1:54:50] it's like a you are wooing me.
[1:54:55] Your voice draws me.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And the voice that will raise those that
[1:55:04] are sleeping in Christ, the depths and
[1:55:07] essence of that voice is
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; that the bridegroom is gathering his
[1:55:11] elect to himself.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; For all that are in the graves shall
[1:55:16] hear the voice of the son of man.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And at the appropriate time,
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; they will come out from the earth. Why?
[1:55:25] Because sweet is his voice.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be misunderstood
[1:55:36] and I don't want to say anything, but if
[1:55:38] what you hear
[1:55:40] being preached doesn't woo you
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; and draw you
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; with a compelling force,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; then you're not getting it.
[1:55:50] You're not hearing him.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're hearing the sound of my
[1:55:53] voice or other preachers vibrating on
[1:55:56] your eard drums. That's not it.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And when you hear a message, you can
[1:56:05] hear brother Brandham, you can hear tape
[1:56:06] after tape after tape, but if it only
[1:56:09] resounds on your eard drums, that's not
[1:56:12] him.
[1:56:14] That voice was only chosen
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; to demonstrate and express the voice of
[1:56:19] the beloved one.
[1:56:21] [Applause]
[1:56:24] [Music]
[1:56:30] Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Give me your attention. Now,
[1:56:39] if you want to ask,
[1:56:41] I I experience this on a regular basis.
[1:56:45] I can't just read a book. I can't just
[1:56:47] listen to a tape.
[1:56:55] I want to
[1:56:58] actually experience. You say, "What can
[1:56:59] I do?"
[1:57:01] You youngest of the young people here
[1:57:05] can say,
[1:57:07] "Lord Jesus,
[1:57:11] I believe with all my heart that's you.
[1:57:17] I believe that you're you can say it
[1:57:18] right now. I can I believe that's you
[1:57:20] trying to speak to me. Brother Biscll is
[1:57:23] doing what he can do,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; but I believe that the Holy Spirit is
[1:57:27] here.
[1:57:29] And I want you to speak to me.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; And what you say I will do.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; And when you brothers and you out there,
[1:57:39] whoever you are,
[1:57:42] this is not just a church.
[1:57:45] This is not We are here. Yes, we have
[1:57:48] socialized, but we're not here to
[1:57:49] socialize.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; That's not our purpose. Our purpose is
[1:57:54] to get ready. My whole commitment, my
[1:57:56] whole purpose is to get you ready for
[1:57:59] the rapture
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; and the change of this body. And if I
[1:58:03] can contribute even a little bit to
[1:58:06] seeing something was said that I was
[1:58:09] able to surrender to the Holy Spirit and
[1:58:11] something was said that was so gripping
[1:58:13] that you could say I I I I
[1:58:17] forsook the world. I had a different set
[1:58:21] of priorities because of some service.
[1:58:24] And God, the Holy Spirit confirmed to my
[1:58:28] heart and my soul, my commitment and my
[1:58:30] yielding to the Holy Spirit and to let
[1:58:33] him have his perfect will and way in my
[1:58:36] life.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And thus I died in the faith or I was
[1:58:39] alive and changed in my atoms.
[1:58:45] Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; It's sweet to be gathered.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And while he talked,
[1:58:59] his voice was a gathering voice.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; And they said to one another, "Did not
[1:59:05] our heart burn within us
[1:59:08] while we talk to him?" By the way,
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; the burning in their heart, that
[1:59:14] burning, that that whatever they want to
[1:59:16] call it, some might call it a
[1:59:17] conviction. It's not a conviction, but
[1:59:18] that burning, that drawing, that that
[1:59:20] something special, the Lord speaking to
[1:59:22] me. The purpose of that is to draw you
[1:59:25] into a into a special experience, into a
[1:59:29] special relationship. And ultimately,
[1:59:32] just on the other side, embracing and
[1:59:34] shaking hands with one another and tears
[1:59:37] of joy going down our face. What can
[1:59:39] compare with that friend?
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Reading between the lines
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; puts us into an atmosphere.
[2:00:00] Peter said looking for and hasting unto
[2:00:05] looking with expectation
[2:00:07] waiting with expectation and hasting
[2:00:09] making haste and to desire is to desire
[2:00:12] earnestly. I don't see anything in the
[2:00:15] apostles that that would indicate that
[2:00:17] we should just go and live our humrum
[2:00:19] life
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; and be burdened and weighted down with
[2:00:23] the cares of this life. We have those
[2:00:26] cares, but there's got to be a greater a
[2:00:28] greater concern.
[2:00:30] [Applause]
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; You that have unsaved young people, I
[2:00:36] see you here.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Believe actively. Not that you haven't,
[2:00:43] but continue to believe actively.
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Believe actively.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We could talk about healing.
[2:00:55] I'm not talking about healing. Now,
[2:00:56] healing is only the token evidence of
[2:00:59] the resurrection. I don't want to talk
[2:01:00] about the token evidence. I want to talk
[2:01:02] about the resurrection.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:20] This is a lesson.
[2:01:25] The message teaches and to many of you
[2:01:27] this is very uh elementary but the
[2:01:31] message teaches that he come in three
[2:01:34] sons names. He
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; one God came in three sons names.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Came in the son of man.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says prophet
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; the son of God
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; the spirit.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the son of David in the
[2:01:51] millennium. Those are the three
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; he said. But, and this is in proving his
[2:01:57] word, but in between
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; this conjunction
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; according to his own words in the day
[2:02:04] when the son of man shall be revealed
[2:02:07] reveal himself.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Not the son of God, son of man will
[2:02:14] reveal himself. Notice notice please the
[2:02:17] words in a different way. Yes.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; He was the son of man, but in this
[2:02:25] junction
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; between the son of man and the between
[2:02:29] the son of God and the son of David
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; he comes again. He says another place to
[2:02:34] fulfill the rest of it.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; But now he says very clearly here in
[2:02:38] another way.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; What is another way? Well, I'll tell
[2:02:42] you. I referred to it last. The pillar
[2:02:44] of fire said it's over this man. It's
[2:02:47] over this woman. over this young person.
[2:02:49] The pillar fire was present.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Whirlwinds came down.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Judgment was called. Alasco almost sunk.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Um other prophecies of the future. Some
[2:03:00] prophecies happen very quick and and and
[2:03:04] he and he himself stood right there at
[2:03:06] the platform and the people be came
[2:03:09] under a certain feeling.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; He could bring you into that right now.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:17] I I want to say something clearly so you
[2:03:20] don't misunderstand me. You've heard
[2:03:22] brother Ed speak about when he was in
[2:03:24] the car and the prophet of God was
[2:03:26] driving and that angel of the Lord came.
[2:03:30] I've tried to describe it. Brother
[2:03:32] Brandham says I can't describe. I'm in
[2:03:35] two worlds but I can't explain it.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; So I he said I've tried but he can't
[2:03:40] explain it. And I've spoke about that
[2:03:42] experience and
[2:03:45] he he could bring you into that if he
[2:03:47] wished to. But I believe that that was
[2:03:49] unique because of him.
[2:03:52] And the angel of the Lord, the Lord
[2:03:53] Jesus Christ could come to that vessel.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I was the one that was in a frozen
[2:03:59] state.
[2:04:00] I've had others say, "Well, I I've
[2:04:02] experienced that." No, you haven't
[2:04:03] experienced that.
[2:04:06] When you experience that, you don't even
[2:04:08] know. But your next your breath your
[2:04:10] next breath I'm talking about this one
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; and you're going to be another place
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; but that presence came in this time
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; to a messenger to confirm to you
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; that this is for the bride of Jesus
[2:04:26] Christ.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; This is for all of us. Not that we have
[2:04:30] these little wonderful feelings as we go
[2:04:32] along. That's not what I'm talk I'm
[2:04:33] talking about the change. There will be
[2:04:36] a sweep.
[2:04:38] You will not feel it,
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; but you will be transformed
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; into another person.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; People would call us crazy. We're ready
[2:04:48] for the puzzle factory. That's according
[2:04:50] to God's holy word.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's according to this holy word.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And you want to take it for your own
[2:04:58] personal possession. You and you want to
[2:05:00] say, "I shall be changed."
[2:05:05] God's word says, "I shall be changed in
[2:05:08] a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. I
[2:05:12] shall be changed." And now God came
[2:05:15] himself,
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; right? To a messenger to confirm that
[2:05:20] now, this is the hour.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; This is the time. If it's this year or
[2:05:24] next year, who cares?
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; But this word came to prepare us.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; If we're to go by the way of the grave,
[2:05:31] we'll go prepared.
[2:05:33] Hallelujah. We'll die with faith that
[2:05:36] will take us out of the grave.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; In between this junction,
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; he says, "And does God ever change his
[2:05:51] mind?" Bear with me. Let me give me a
[2:05:52] little bit of time, will you? Is that
[2:05:54] all right?
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; But in between the son of God and the
[2:05:58] son of David according to his own word
[2:06:00] is another quote now. And according to
[2:06:02] Malachi 4 and and many places he's he
[2:06:07] he's to return back
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; into his church in a physical form
[2:06:14] [Music]
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; in the people
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; in a and he said it in human beings
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; in the way of being a prophet.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; This is something you're not to be
[2:06:28] afraid of. It is Christ himself
[2:06:32] that has returned back
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; in a different way.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; And it's him that is with his people,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; not another one.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; This isn't some strange doctrine. This
[2:06:48] is precisely what the message has
[2:06:50] declared.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "I will not leave
[2:06:56] you comfortless. I shall come to you.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions.
[2:07:03] If it were not so, I would have told you
[2:07:05] so. I go to prepare a place for you. And
[2:07:07] if I go and prepare a place for you, I
[2:07:10] shall come and receive you unto myself.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; And in after the resurrection of the of
[2:07:18] Jesus Christ of Nazareth, that was him.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Mary thought he's a gardener, but it was
[2:07:24] him.
[2:07:25] They emaous gentleman thought he was a
[2:07:28] stranger but it was him
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; walking with them going with them going
[2:07:34] to their house eating bread
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; looking like a spirit
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; eating honeycomb and fish. It was him
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; and then being said being seen above 40
[2:07:47] days
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; with many infallible proofs. Not to the
[2:07:52] public.
[2:07:54] To the believer,
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; to them that believed,
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; they that heard earnestly and
[2:08:03] attentively
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; and crave for it and yearned for it and
[2:08:09] said, "Your voice is sweet. It's
[2:08:13] compelling. It's calling me.
[2:08:19] [Music]
[2:08:21] Hallelujah.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; I feel like going home.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; I feel like going home.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to I want to raise
[2:08:37] your expectations so high.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; God help me to make it so real.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ed, Brother Priscal, I can't
[2:08:44] miss that.
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:48] [Applause]
[2:08:50] Amen.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; truly God is in human beings. But
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; the sign of the end was a prophet human
[2:09:05] being.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Christ in a prophet human being. That
[2:09:11] was the sign. And that's why he said
[2:09:13] this is the sign of the resurrection.
[2:09:18] And this is the sign of the Messiah.
[2:09:21] Search it out.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Search it in your own computer. This is
[2:09:26] the sign of Messiah
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; here on earth again.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; The Jews missed that one. The Gentiles
[2:09:33] missed this one. But the bride does not
[2:09:35] miss it.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:49] in modern events. I'm going to close
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; after 2,000 years.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; He begins to again fulfill the prophecy.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; He begins to f He begins to fulfill the
[2:10:01] prophecy.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; As he laid down the prophecy, he begins
[2:10:04] to fill the fulfill the pro prophecy by
[2:10:07] revealing himself.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. And in modern events now the
[2:10:11] prophet is coming to the end of his
[2:10:12] ministry and the end of his life.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; He says and he said in one place now
[2:10:16] Jesus was coming to the end of his life
[2:10:18] there
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; and the prophet was coming to the end of
[2:10:21] his life here.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends read between the lines.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; It's the same one.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; The same ministry.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Why did he come the first time? to
[2:10:37] redeem and show them that he had
[2:10:39] redeemed and to show them that he had
[2:10:41] resurrected. But by his because through
[2:10:44] his death we're justified, but in his
[2:10:46] resurrection were glorified.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; And he was so precise in laying down the
[2:10:55] prophecy. Read the prophecy. Pray over
[2:10:58] the prophecy. Read Luke 24
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; and put yourself there and read between
[2:11:04] the lines. That will happen again.
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; That's not a question whether it'll
[2:11:15] happen. The question is where will you
[2:11:17] be?
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; This preaching is happening even this
[2:11:25] morning so that you can be right in
[2:11:27] step.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; I heard it. I heard it. I don't
[2:11:30] understand it, but I'm in tune with it.
[2:11:33] My I'm yearning. I'm craving.
[2:11:35] Hallelujah. That's the only thing that
[2:11:37] means anything. I go to work, but I'm
[2:11:39] yearning. I go to school, but I'm
[2:11:41] yearning. Hallelujah. This body's going
[2:11:44] to be changed. I shall be changed.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:54] I will meet my brothers, my sisters. Oh
[2:11:57] Lord,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; that same spirit that's in me now, it's
[2:12:01] going to change me. He's going to let
[2:12:03] you know who you're with.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; It had to be a special experience. When
[2:12:09] the prophet went beyond beyond the
[2:12:11] curtain of time and had other
[2:12:13] experiences and one came up to him, he
[2:12:16] didn't know it was his daughter.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Sharon Rose,
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; mother's over here waiting for you.
[2:12:27] [Music]
[2:12:29] [Applause]
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:36] That's why I looked at the picture of my
[2:12:38] mom.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; I'm about three years old.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; About three years before the Lord took
[2:12:43] her. I looked at her picture. Going to
[2:12:46] see you.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Going to see you.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready for it, friends.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk down a path.
[2:12:56] The prophet already said it.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; You'll walk down a trail and one of
[2:12:59] these days you'll find me.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; He told us he'll be singing Amazing
[2:13:05] Grace. Might as well sing Amazing Grace
[2:13:07] and get accustomed to it.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; See, brother Sister Iverson,
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Going to see your father,
[2:13:16] Sister Iverson. Glorious man of God.
[2:13:20] Hallelujah. Your father-in-law, Brother
[2:13:22] Hank. Hallelujah. It's going to be that
[2:13:25] real.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; I feel like doing a dance.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; If we can't rejoice in this, what are we
[2:13:36] here for?
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Let the world have their wild time. But
[2:13:39] this is a my time.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:53] said, "Now Jesus made himself known
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; to these disciples." Now,
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; these two disciples, Cleopus, his
[2:14:00] friend,
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; now we're we're in the resurrection.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; They were in the resurrection.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; How do you know you're not in the
[2:14:07] resurrection?
[2:14:11] [Applause]
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Well, you might say there's strange
[2:14:15] there'd be strange things. There is
[2:14:16] strange things happening.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; You say something's happening.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe the same Holy Spirit is seeking to
[2:14:23] open your eyes
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; and give you an understanding.
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; The morning after the resurrection, the
[2:14:34] first resurrection, what a beautiful
[2:14:35] morning, Jesus is up from the dead,
[2:14:37] living amongst his people. What a
[2:14:39] beautiful thought.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; He's here
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; the same today
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; as he was that day.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord.
[2:14:50] He's here the same today as he was that
[2:14:55] day.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Homegoing time, friends. It's homegoing
[2:15:04] time. I'm not here to excite you. I'm
[2:15:07] here to put you in expectation.
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:24] Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; I'll close with this. I'll try. It's
[2:15:28] hard for me to close, but I'll close
[2:15:30] with this.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; When I started said he came as a
[2:15:36] virgin-born son and laid out the
[2:15:39] prophecy,
[2:15:41] then he came
[2:15:43] and used a redeemed son.
[2:15:49] Why? Because redemption.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; And listen, church, this is a critical
[2:15:55] point. Redemption. I'm talking about
[2:15:58] full redemption.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; You're cleansed.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; You're pure.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; You're holy.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; You're not beyond mistakes, but you're
[2:16:07] holy.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; You're the pure spotless bride of Jesus
[2:16:12] Christ.
[2:16:14] Don't ever lose sight of that. And don't
[2:16:17] ever let Satan mar that.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; And he had to come and take an adopted
[2:16:32] redeemed son.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; So that redemption would be complete and
[2:16:37] so that we would even the people in the
[2:16:39] world they couldn't figure out what kind
[2:16:41] of servant, what kind of man this is.
[2:16:44] William Brandham and some went off to
[2:16:45] this side, some went off to that side.
[2:16:47] But there's a body of people, a group of
[2:16:49] people that are down the middle. Now
[2:16:51] listen, because full redemption includes
[2:16:54] a resurrection.
[2:16:57] Full redemption includes a change of
[2:16:59] this body. And it took that servant to
[2:17:03] say that scripture is a prophecy for
[2:17:06] you. Listen to the prophecy.
[2:17:10] enter into this relationship and read
[2:17:14] between the lines.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; This is Hallelujah.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; This is not 40 years ago. This is today.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; We're still here,
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; but we may not be here for tonight.
[2:17:34] [Applause]
[2:17:39] [Music]
[2:17:41] [Applause]
[2:17:44] Only God knows how my heart is beating
[2:17:46] now.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; And don't let any fear grip you.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; But this is being preached
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; so that the fear will come off you.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And I hope God's ministering to you
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; right now.
[2:18:04] He came with this message that you
[2:18:06] believe
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; to deliver you from that fear.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he wouldn't even speak
[2:18:12] to you. He wouldn't even draw you if you
[2:18:15] weren't his.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I preached to you in the
[2:18:19] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan have any advantage.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; This message came so we would be there.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I wouldn't want anybody
[2:18:33] just take this casual. I'm just come
[2:18:35] here, you know, once in a while and
[2:18:37] because it's church and no, no, no, no.
[2:18:39] If that's what you believe,
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; one day you'll come to church
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; and you'll find it very empty
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; and you'll say, "Where is everybody?
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, they must have changed the clock."
[2:18:51] No,
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; it's God's clock.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; He changed it and he just decided time
[2:18:56] to bring them home.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; They heard my voice. They love my voice.
[2:19:02] They say it's sweet to me, father. And
[2:19:06] he'll say, "Come home."
[2:19:23] Yes.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; See you in the rapture, friends.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; If not the next ver not the next not in
[2:19:38] the next service, I'll meet you in the
[2:19:39] rapture.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's we've been laboring all these
[2:19:43] years for
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; for this one cause.
[2:19:50] Hallelujah.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; I want to ask brother Kim to sing it.
[2:19:56] Could you come? Linda, can you come and
[2:19:58] play it? Is that all right? I said no.
[2:20:01] Do we have I'll see you in the rapture.
[2:20:03] Whoever knows it.
[2:20:08] Use one of those.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Kim's been waiting for a week to sing
[2:20:13] this song
[2:20:16] or more.
[2:20:20] Hallelujah.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you can join him in the course
[2:20:25] if you wish. Do we have we have some
[2:20:27] verses too?
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy the word this morning.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I was thinking as
[2:20:38] brother Biscll was was was preaching the
[2:20:40] this morning, you know, people ask us,
[2:20:42] you know, why are you building a school
[2:20:44] if you believe in a rapture? Why are you
[2:20:46] witnessing to your family? Why are you
[2:20:47] out on the streets?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; We'll work until Jesus comes.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say come.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; And we'll be on the streets saying come.
[2:20:56] We'll be on the mission field saying
[2:20:58] come. We'll stay come until he comes.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; And one day, brother Peta, he'll come
[2:21:05] walking through the school. I look at
[2:21:06] brother Peter, he's working 12, 14 hours
[2:21:08] a day. I see him at the end of the day
[2:21:10] weary and tired. and he'll come through
[2:21:13] the school and he say, "Lay down your
[2:21:15] tools, Peter. It's time to go home."
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're looking forward to that day.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; There's a new body.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Let's enjoy it.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Glory. We're here for a short time, but
[2:21:30] we're here for a good time.
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:45] If we never
[2:21:48] meet again
[2:21:50] on this earth, my precious friend.
[2:21:55] If to God you have been true
[2:22:00] and you've lived above all sin,
[2:22:05] then for us there'll be a meeting.
[2:22:11] A hallelujah

[2:23:19] when our Lord shall come again
[2:23:24] to catch his waiting bride away.

[2:26:32] Isaac Norie
[2:26:38] hand

[2:26:44] of the savior.

[2:26:55] home.

[2:27:05] and the next voice

[2:28:08] sometime I'm driving in my car
[2:28:11] and I just I just sing this little
[2:28:13] chorus. I heard it brother Isaac Negas
[2:28:16] probably 25 30 years ago. I can tell you
[2:28:19] it was never as real as it's been in the
[2:28:22] last few weeks. And I just just sing it
[2:28:26] along to myself.
[2:28:28] Oh, the next hand you shake
[2:28:33] will be the hand
[2:28:35] of the savior.
[2:28:38] Your next step
[2:28:41] you take with me on the street of your
[2:28:46] soul.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; It will happen
[2:28:50] with me. the Mary supper.
[2:28:57] And the next voice
[2:29:00] you hear could be him saying,
[2:29:04] "Well done,
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus." That's all we want to hear.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Well done.
