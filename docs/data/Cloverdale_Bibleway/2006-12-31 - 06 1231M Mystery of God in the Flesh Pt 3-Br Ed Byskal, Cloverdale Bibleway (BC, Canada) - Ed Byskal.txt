Lord, we believe your word this morning, Father. Lord Jesus, we believe you are here in our midst, oh God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father. We've got a number of requests here this morning we want to take before the throne of grace. I'm going to ask brother Ernie if you'd come and lead us before the throne. There's a request we pray for an elder elderly couple in Lynon. Uh it's by the names of Jean and Jean. Um a wife is suffering from Alzheimer's and they are having to sell their property. They have lived on for over 50 years. And because they're Jehovah's Witnesses, they don't go to the doctor. they can't go to the doctor. So, just requesting we remember them in prayer this morning that God would speak to them, work out the situation for them. There's a request from a brother Milco for uh Mr. and Mrs. Hoffner in Bogan, Germany. My brother-in-law's uh neighbors and uh Johanna and brother Milco stayed in their house for a week after Johanna's mother passed away. They're both plagued with diabetes, very serious. And they know that the believers around the world are praying for them. The Milco sent them uh German Bibles and message books and CDs in the German language. They're very open to the gospel. We want to remember them this morning. Pray that God would touch them. Um uh brother Todd and Sister Faith Neighbor requesting prayer for an elderly neighbor of theirs. Uh we want to remember brother Mike Cosalino this morning requesting prayer that his stolen vehicle would be would be stolen. Brother Mike, I know, is uh diligent to pick up another number of people in his van every Sunday morning and bring him to the service and we want to just pray that the Lord would have brother Mike's vehicle returned for him. Amen. Also, sister Lan is at home sick was requesting that the Lord would give her the faith to receive her healing. How many have a need this morning that want to be remembered in prayer? Amen. And and if you're listening in on the internet this morning and have a need, you just bring it before the Lord as we go to be before the throne of grace. Whether any pray, [Music] we come before you this morning with hearts that are thankful for the many blessings that you send our way on a daily basis. Lord, we thank you for the sanctuary that we can come to and Lord, how you have anointed the gifts, Lord, the song leaders and the musicians, Lord, to bring us into that place of worship and that we may praise you, Lord, and that we may we may honor you for who you are. Lord, we thank you for the supernatural intelligence that you have sent our way, for the ability to hear and to to see into another realm, Lord, to know that that this message has come to take the fear off of the people and as brother Rod said, to give us an opportunity for guilt-free living. Lord, how thankful we are. Lord, our our our our desires, our motives, our goals, our ambitions. Everything about our life has changed since coming into contact with the message of Malachi 4. Lord, how privileged we are. And Lord, with that privilege comes a a great opportunity and a great responsibility and a great accountability. Lord, we we have great joy in our hearts for what you have done for us. But Lord, like Abraham, when when he heard about Lot, he wanted to do everything he could to restore Lot. And there are many out there, Lord, that are still trapped. Lord, I pray that we would be able to reach out to them. Lord, a country like China, over a billion people, 1.4 billion people, hundreds of millions have never heard the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, there must be there must be a way that that that you have for getting the message into these places in India. Father, Lord, we we commit ourselves to you to do all that we can to fulfill that great commission. And now, Lord, for these requests that have been pinned down, Lord, for this uh the Hoffnner family, oh God, that brother Milco has has asked to be remembered in prayer. Lord, I pray that you would open their eyes. Brother Milco has been diligent, Lord, to apply the token, to send the materials. Lord, let that material be like fire in their hands, Lord. fire in their hearts, Father, to illuminate them and to quicken them, to energize them, Lord, to see that that God is moving in their hearts. Father, for Sister Lana at home sick today, Lord, Lord, we pray that you would bless our sister, that you would raise her up in newness of life, Father, let every every germ or every bacteria, Lord, whatever it is that that is affecting her body, Lord, let it be annihilated. Let it be sent back to where it comes from and rise her up in into perfect supernatural health. And Lord, for this family and Lyndon, oh God, Lord, to be in a a system that doesn't allow them to go to doctors and Lord, to be afflicted with this Alzheimer's disease, Lord, only only you can move upon that situation. Man man is lost when it comes to this disease. But Lord, you are the great physician. You can take whatever's whatever's wrong in that mind and you can take it and turn around and and make it right, Father, and put them on the right track for salvation. And Lord, for brother Mike Castelino, Father, our gallant brother, Lord, who who continues to go the extra mile all the time. Father, I pray that you would bring his vehicle back. I pray Lord that whoever whoever has it Lord would abandon it and and that it would be found by the police and it would be brought back and it would be brought back without damage &gt;&gt; and that brother Mike would be able to rejoice knowing that God has moved upon the scene for them. And uh one more uh [Music] like to also pray for brother Jim Log, Father, down in Florida. Lord, the doctors have not given him much hope. Father, a demon of cancer has stricken his body. It's been a long fight for him. And God, he needs a miracle in his life. He's been such a gallant soldier. I pray, Lord, that you would move upon the scene. I pray that you would anoint faith in his heart, Lord, that he would be able to feel that quickening power and be able to rise up in newness of life. Lord, you are the high priest of our confession, sitting at the right hand of majesty, waiting to make good every promise that you have signed with your blood, Father. And Lord, we call for for for for the blood of Jesus Christ to have its impact upon brother Jim's life. Raise him up in newness of life, Father. Lord, I pray you'd bless Brother Tony and Sister Rebecca away on the mission field, Father. Lord, I pray that you would guide them like a like a heat seeeking missile to the saints of God that you want them to meet. Let them have a great victory, Lord. and for brother Ed Lord coming to minister this morning. I pray Lord for for you to be able to give him a liberty and a freedom and an anointing Lord. Let him come to the pulpit. Let him get right into that channel, right into that stream of consciousness that that that you have led him into, Father. And let us be brought into that stream of consciousness, Father. And Lord, we ask all these blessings in your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And you may be seated. [Music] [Music] We want to welcome everyone who's visiting with us. And uh I know we've got uh Brother Ed and Sister Jean Watkins are visiting from uh South Carolina. Happy to have them. Maybe we can just get them to stand up wherever they are. Amen. God bless you. Happy to have you here with us. Amen. And any others? We just want to make sure you know you're real welcome here with us. Um the Sunday school has a special forest. Maybe they can come at this time. I assume they're all out there ready to come in. And while they are, we'll uh we've got a couple of announcements. Um for the service tonight starts at 9:00. If we could have all the singers, everyone who's singing um uh with specials in the service tonight um and the musicians meet 15 minutes before the service in the music room in the chapel at the back. Appreciate it. uh had a uh note from the deacons this morning that uh they would appreciate, they mentioned it before, uh don't leave your books on the chairs and then go out and talk. If you leave your chair, they need to they need to seat people and so they've got people come in looking for a seat. They don't know what seats are taking, what aren't. So if you leave your seat a book on a um on a seat, you may find it in the lost and found in the future. So, uh, this is our deacons and, uh, so if you're getting here, uh, early and you want a seat, then sit in it. Okay. Um, also, uh, today is, uh, December the 31st, I think. Uh, and so, uh, every year, um, we do get some people who try to make donations after the end of the year. So, today is the last day. If you want a tax receipt for this year, you have to get it in sometime today. So, uh, that includes up to midnight tonight. So, if you could get it in, uh, sometime tonight, we'd appreciate that very much. There's a lot of these little guys. Hey, they just seem to keep coming. Why don't we sing together? I'm so glad I belong to Jesus. [Music] Ah, I'm so glad I That's kind of low, I think, isn't it? I'm so glad I belong to Jesus. I'm so glad I belong to Jesus. I'm so glad I belong to Jesus.

[Applause] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. I always enjoy watching the children. Praise the Lord. Amen. We're going to turn now to uh turn the service to brother Bisco. We have a baby dedication this morning. And uh just as brother Ed comes and brother John and sister Vanessa come as well, let's sing together. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given wonderful things in the Bible I see. This is the dearest that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves even me. The fourth verse. Jesus loves me and I know I love him. Love brought him down my soul full to redeem. Yes, it was love made him die on that tree. Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves even me. Oh, if one should ask of me, how can I tell? Glory to Jesus. I know very well. God's Holy Spirit with my dust agree. Constantly witnessing Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Are you a glad that Jesus loves me? Jesus loves me. God bless you. Hallelujah. Nice to see such a family as this. our brother John and sister Vanessa Kirk wanting to dedicate their latest arrival and her name is Anna Ruth. I've been calling her Anna Grace all the time because Anna stands for Grace. So I thought when I get up here I must be able to say Anna Ruth. I certainly cannot forget the name Ruth, can we? I think it's a a wonderful choice. The uh the scripture says a verse that you know so well and we all know train up a child in the way that he should go and when he's old he will not depart from it. And I was uh pondering yesterday very much standing here with you, Sister Vanessa, Brother John, and I know that they as a couple and as a father and a mother are prepared emotionally, prepared, I believe, materially, and we all want to be and feel as though we are prepared spiritually. to give to the child what it will need. But because we don't know what the future holds, we have to just resolve within our hearts that we ourselves will be prepared for whatever this child needs, especially spiritually. And in thinking about that, I thought of children. And I always marvel, which I did just recently when I am in another country. I marvel how those little ones are are speaking so fluently a foreign language, but they pick up and as you as parents that are here know, children learn largely by observation. and what they hear. And brother Brham even said the little ones that called Elisha old baldhead. He said they heard it at around the dinner table, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it's amazing what they pick up. So what this child, Brother John, sister Vanessa, it will learn by observation. It will learn by what it's heard. it will learn mostly by the example of the parents and this is this is an incredible thing. So the scripture can say train up a child in the way that it should go. But that training I would say is much more effectual by our lives than it is by our words because we can we can say it and say it and say it, but eventually the child is going to really do what we do. And so I want to say to you, brother John and sister Vanessa, because you have infinitely more time with them. And perhaps Vanessa, you will have more time with Anna Ruth than John will. And both of you will have much more time than we will or I will or the church or the minister will. So I would like to say to you that pave the way before her by your example. And brother Brandham tells uh he tells an account of a shepherd going down. He saw the shepherd going down a marketplace. And he said he had a string of sheep behind him about a block long. and and on the marketplace was produce and all kinds of things which could have attracted them. But the shepherd just kept walking and they just kept walking in a single file one right after the other after the other. They ignored everything else because the shepherd was just going in that one direction. And so I would say to you two, you are the you're the shepherd for this little one. And if you follow just along on a straight line, this little one's going to follow along the way. And then you know well the story of the man it was Christmas and he wasn't a man that drank but he did go and see some colleagues and they enticed him to have a little to drink and of course he wasn't accustomed to it. So on the way home he staggered all over the place and this boy got way behind him and he said why did you take so long? He said well I was trying to follow in your footsteps. So, we want to leave footsteps that are easy to walk in. Footsteps that will lead this life to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anna Ruth, we're going to dedicate her to the Lord Jesus Christ. And Jesus took them up in his arms. And I'm a poor representation of him, but she's a sweet little one. We'll pray. Heavenly Father, this lovely gift that you have given to our brother John and sister Vanessa, and they so desire to raise her, to raise her so that her footsteps will follow in the footsteps of the Lord Jesus Christ, the great shepherd. But she will be following along in the footsteps of her mother and her father. And I pray, oh God, you will endure, Brother John and Sister Vanessa, with that spiritual leadership. That they will lead by example, that they will lead by their conversation, that they will lead, oh God, by the environment and the atmosphere of their home. And as you have given this one who they have called Anna Ruth to them, they're standing here today before this company of witnesses to dedicate her to the Lord's service. And as a prophet would so many times even with the little girls would dedicate them to the service of the Lord. I dedicate Anna Ruth to the service of the Lord. And I pray, oh God, that as her name implies, father, grace and friendship, and may her life exude both of those. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, your hand will be upon her in a special way from this day on. May there be something angelic about her nature. I pray, Father, you'll keep her in good health and make her a blessing and a joy to this family in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's a perfect peace. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Vanessa. God bless you, dear. Bless you. God bless you, brother John. Amen. Isn't that lovely? I think of the scripture so often. And he took them up in his arms and blessed them. Our Lord Jesus had the time. Brother Ernie, it's so good to see you. And that phone call the other day really fired me up. And I told the people sounded to me like you might immigrate to China. So, we're anxious to hear about those things and we'll have to arrange that very soon. Uh, I'm so thankful for the witness of the ministry. Tonight, we will be having a a watch night service starting at 9:00 as brother Rod has already announced. But I have just felt in my heart that this year will be a year that we will celebrate the whole year as a year of witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message has been going now for over 40 years, a generation and the effect of it has been so powerful around the globe. We will be hearing uh a lot of that as we focus and come on down towards July when we will be having and hosting a whole week July 1st to July the 8th of a international convention and be tying together with congregations the Lord willing throughout the world with brethren I've even been meeting with them this last week uh getting all of things in place so that congregations will be able to tie together with us in other parts of the world and join in on the convention or some aspects of the convention. But I want to take the opportunity today to thank the ministry uh that is in this congregation and has gone out from this congregation. I'm very very deeply indebted and appreciate the brethren. I know their lives, the time they spend before the Lord in prayer and study and I know that you appreciate it. I want to just express my appreciation for the deacons and they, you know, they labor sacrificially. They miss much of the meetings which they would like to be in because they have to tend to other things and they're just so faithful and I appreciate them. And the trustees of the congregation, they're diligent. They are uh they they deal with the matters of the church as it would be their own and under uh under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And I'm so thankful to God that uh the the the I won't say the power of God, but I will say that the care of the great shepherd, the Lord Jesus, has led us in footsteps and has led us in a path. So the church has continued to be healthy financially and whatever God called on us to do that there was always the resources to do it. That to me is a incredible blessing. You have never had in over 30 years have we ever stood at the pulpit and begged for money or offerings or whatever. We've never had to put out gimmicks or you know whatever uh other people perhaps do or other churches. We don't believe in it and God has always provided. I want to thank you for your uh faithfulness and your giving pro and providing because and your trust that uh between myself and the trustees you would uh have confidence that it would be given in the right direction and to and to achieve the right goals and I am thankful that so thankful to God that from the congregation and your faithfulness Uh we have been able to send the message as a witness uh to many places around the globe and today brother Tony and sister Rebecca are away and I I I wish them God's speed and God's protection. They will be in places you want to be praying for them. They will be in places that are not necessarily not as safe as where you are today. We need they need to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves in the countries some of the countries that they are in. I am so thankful for the Bible believers and the missions and uh and all of the one of the outstanding characteristics I'm just going to take a few moments but one of the outstanding characteristics with Bible believers has been and Bible believers in incidentally is not some institution it is simply a conduit people you people give people from elsewhere give and they have confidence because I get I hear it all the time from people from many other places. They say we see uh what you do and we and the and the one outstanding characteristic is we have not engaged in shotgun efforts that boom a great big you know going to do big thing and then boom and it just uh you know 6 months from now you can't see it but we just kind of a door is open so we move in cautiously review it have a look at it see what the need is see if God raises up God called men in the country because we go back to the scripture and back to the message that the pastors in the country are sovereign. And so we see what God has placed in the hearts of the men that's in the country. And then we see that God raises up solid men, men of the word, men of prayer, men of leadership. And then we move under their opaces. What do you have? What is the burden for the country? And then in one country it'll be one thing, another country it'll be another. So we just try to move alongside of them honoring their burden and their vision and then God begins to prosper the work in the country. So we never go in for the short term. It's always the long term. And one of the longest has been uh India. Other countries where God has allowed us to have uh a fruitful endeavor. They have been countries where once the work was started and they saw how it was done, they took it over themselves. And we just think that is uh that's God's way. We're so thankful for that. And we could just enumerate the countries, but I won't bother doing that today. But and then there are other places like India for example where it's needed constant care and we've been there almost uh 26 years in India and every single month there's never been a month in 26 years that the message books have not rolled off the presses and been distributed to the people and it just increases more and more. I say praise be to God. We are we are at our post of duty doing whatever we're supposed to do and when this life is over and it will be either in the change of the body and the resurrection. And I said just yesterday to my wife, I hope I live to see that. I just want to experience the rapture so bad. I want to see this old body defeat death while I'm walking on the earth. I want to see that so bad. and uh and but in the meantime, we'll just remain faithful. We'll remain steadfast on our post of duty. So, it isn't doing some big thing. It's just everyday living for God. Everyday living. And so, I'm so thankful for the missions. I I want to uh show uh express special thanks to our Sunday school and the teachers uh the children singing. Isn't it lovely? hear them singing and to all who work in in that in that endeavor and also to the school uh Bible way Christian Academy and to the principal and the teachers. God bless you and may the blessings of God through the Holy Spirit guide. I don't look on the school as being something of of a natural realm. To me, it's a great spiritual realm, and Satan would fight that with everything he can, but we are in support of it. And I I believe that it they're going to be having probably the greatest year they've ever had this coming year. I look forward to to expanding to uh the ninth grade and then on from there as well. So, God bless the school. I would like to ask God's blessing and your remembrance of all the people that are involved to make these services. To those of you that are on the internet, we so appreciate the notes, the emails that come on the internet. They come every week on the internet. There's a even a small group that's gathering. They've been some scattered families in Switzerland. And I say, "God bless you that are in Switzerland and streaming the meeting. This morning's meeting is an evening service for them." And they have said, you know, we were individual families, but we decided once a month we will get together in a home and perhaps 15 to 20 of the people there are joining in the service with us this morning. and from very many other places uh generally around 130, 140, 160 up to close to 200 locations where people are are are joining with us. I want to say God bless them. God bless them. for those that uh make the music possible and uh uh labor in that. It's a lot of labor, not just here playing on the platform, but being with those that are singing. And worship is a big thing. And I I like to maintain it as worship to the Lord. &gt;&gt; We never want to go towards the direction of entertainment, but we should enjoy worship and we should join in worship. And I believe it's something that the people do. I want to I want to thank all the musicians for their dedication and the people that are in the sound and the people are in the video and those that are working right now to see that the internet people can hear. There's just a lot of people throughout throughout the whole uh those that sit up in the cubbies and translate the languages even as we're speaking now. I say God bless them. They don't have the same opportunity of enjoying the service perhaps as we do, but they are doing a service to the Lord and the Lord will bless them for it. Amen. I believe this is going to be a mighty year of witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for, you know, and we I I've mentioned a couple times, but we're moving towards doing a DVD that's going to get out into the Hutterite colonies. And, you know, maybe it doesn't mean anything to you, and I don't know what it even means to some of the people that came from the colonies, but and I've never lived on a colony, but I'd like to shake them to their roots. I'd like to shake them so violently that it just shake people right out of there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Well, what if they're not predestinated to believers? I'd like to shake them out anyway." &gt;&gt; You would? Yes. &gt;&gt; Shake them out to a life of freedom. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand all that. And I want to thank our office staff and volunteers. You know, every Sunday, every Sunday, every service, there's young sisters go in there and volunteer and take the calls from people who maybe are sick and can't be on the phone. Uh they can't be in the service, so they're on the phone hookup. And somebody has to look after that and manage that. And we have sisters here that we hardly ever say a word about it, but God bless the young sisters and those that labor and do everything. We're just thankful &gt;&gt; for the work of God. And tonight we're going to have a wonderful time.

I also want to welcome in a special way, Brother Nathaniel Iverson's father, Brother Hank Iverson and his wife. God bless you. Haven't even had a chance to visit with them yet and we want to do that.

Oh, heavenly father, we are so thankful today that we can stand here as your children and declare that our confidence and trust is in you. This world is a moving shifting sands and we cannot build upon it but we can build upon the solid rock Jesus Christ. Oh, and our our confidence, our trust is and faith is in you. And we're here today at the post of duty. Each one standing at their post of duty. Everyone has a special task that they've been called upon to live in this life. And the very special one is to be an expression of Jesus Christ. Help us now, Father, as we come to the word. I pray Lord publicly as I prayed privately you will anoint me oh God that it will reach the hearts of the people and may the word come out oh father the way it was just made real to myself may the message beh a a bread from heaven I pray bless this congregation oh God in the name of Jesus Christ and the congregation that's invisible at this moment I pray Father, as we present ourselves now, you will illuminate us by the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to take your Bibles to Romans the 5th chapter and we'll begin reading at verse 12. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men. For that all have sinned. For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the simultude of Adam's transgression. who is the figure of him that was to come. Like you to notice verse 14. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. So the scripture is very clear. There was no law until Moses. But sin passed upon all even if there was no law and and the law came and then and sin but sin is not imputed where there is no law. So then when the law came and God gave a law that the people could in no wise keep and therefore they became under condemnation and guilty and sin was imputed to them. All right. Uh, just a couple more verses. Turn to 2 Corinthians 3:18, which reads, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord, the the image of Christ, the image of the sinless one." Colossians 3:10. I'll just read it. And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. And Romans 8:29 that brother Ken Andes read on Wednesday when he spoke for whom he did forno he also did predestinate not we don't want to put a period there. He did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. May God bless his word as you have your seats. Now you'll have to just resolve at the beginning to really keep your thoughts focused and don't be distracted in any way if at all possible. The message I'd like to bring to you is really in in three parts. I have in the last two services been speaking on the mystery of God in the flesh. Part one, part two, and now this is part three. The mystery of God in the flesh. This great mystery that Paul spoke of. Christ in you. Christ in you. Said it was the mystery, a great mystery, Christ in you, the hope of glory. I hope that today, I trust that today I'll be able to enlarge on that that God dwelling in flesh. But the three parts uh first I would like to just touch on as we have in the last two services mostly dwelt on it quite largely and that is the coming of Christ the first and second coming of Christ. The first coming and we're speaking of him because he is the restored image of God. Right. &gt;&gt; So the first coming we showed how he all the way down through the saints of the Old Testament. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. And then when we we've just had the world has remembered the Christmas season and many uh I'm sure have read the genealogies of the scripture and the one genealogy in Matthew tracing Joseph's lineage and the one genealogy in Luke tracing Mary's lineage and uh and and both of those lineages trace back into the uh into the lineage of David. And Jesus is called the son of Abraham, the son of David. Uh and so now that was his first coming. How he was coming down down. It wasn't just he didn't just come when he was conceived in the womb of Mary. He didn't come just when he was born in a manger. He didn't come just when he started walking and preaching. That wasn't his first coming. That was the consummation of his first coming. But he was coming all the way down. God was descending descending down from the time he said from the time he said that the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent's head. &gt;&gt; From the time God spoke it and even in the mind of God before the foundation of the world, he would come. But actually when it was set into motion and that lineage came all the way down, God was coming down in the form of a man to be a kinsman redeemer. And then comes the New Testament and the spirit of God was in Christ now comes into the church corporate. You see the God was working corporate in the whole corporate body of a nation called Israel. But out of that came one a virgin and she conceived by the word and brought forth the corporal body Jesus Christ. Then the Holy Spirit came into the church. And then God was now in the corporal corporate body called the church or the body of Jesus Christ which the Bible also calls the bride of Jesus Christ. Christ is the groom and the bride comes out of the New Testament. And so it here's and and the second coming of Christ really if you read any history at all that's why many of the disciples thought Christ the the coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost that that was the second coming because he had arrived. But they and they recognized then Jesus now began to manifest in the church. And some of them historically speaking thought that was the second coming. But he was coming on down on down then until a prophet would come in the end time and say as Christ the seed went into the ground so that his wife the church likewise died at Na Rome went into organizational systems and then came on down and come out in the reformation justification sanctification a restoration of the gifts baptism of the Holy Spirit and then in the end time come a messenger to show the whole picture what was happening, what is happening, and what has just to happen. And all of that through the New Testament is is a is a process, but it was Christ coming on down on down on down. And I took a quote last week where brother Brandon mentions Luther, he mentions Wesley, he says God in them. God was in them uh showing what he was doing in the whole age at the whole time. So now this is just a little summary. So that was number one. And number two in the part I I would like to show that in each case both in his first coming in the old testament era and in the new testament. Now you have to just when I talk about coming I'm breaking away from the customary uh uh view or perspective of Christianity is coming. I just want to break that issue for a few moments and so you can see that it's it's a whole era. God coming down, coming down, coming down. And in the first in the first uh Old Testament and listen real closely now because we're coming to a critical spot here and then I'll go and enlarge on it. Even though Matthew records Joseph's line lineage and Luke records Mary's lineage and even though it would say in Acts the 2 chapter speaking of David as being not only a king but said he was a prophet and God swearing to David that of the fruit of his loins and the scripture says after the flesh, God would raise up Christ. When you read that, you have to conclude Jesus was either the fruit of David's flesh or he was virgin born. &gt;&gt; I say that he was virgin born. It was a new creation in the womb of Mary. But so and and brother Brennham comes along and says Jesus he never called his Mary his mother and yet there are a number of scriptures which we'll come to that says the mother of Christ blessed be the mother of my lord and so on and so forth. So now comes this critical point and that is that God being sovereign and God being who he is. God, what are we? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; We're just pieces of clay. except God who gave into into a man's body seed, sperm, and he also and that came by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That came by the word of God. &gt;&gt; God created us that way. &gt;&gt; And an egg and a field for the woman. God created that. So God's word that permits a human life to come that way. God knowing in his infinite wisdom that man would fall. He also he also had shall I say a higher law, a higher form of life than the human life. And that life also would be thy by the word of God. And where a human, a man and a woman would fall in Eden by disobedience, God would send out a seed, a spiritual seed that would not deny his word. And because because God being who he is, he is able to attribute attribute to an individual to account to an individual. he can attribute to that individual part of himself or his plan. And so while while David did not have a son as an everlasting son to sit on his kingdom, God attributed his son &gt;&gt; to be that son &gt;&gt; and accounted it to David's account. &gt;&gt; Follow me. Abraham. That's why God allowed Abraham and Sarah to become the age that they became so that their bodies could be dead and so that God could attribute the son that could not come out of Abraham's loins. He attributed his son that came out of his bosom as Abraham's son. And he allowed Abraham in his old age to turn youthful and bring forth a son so that son could be the type of his son. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So this is just a summary. I want you to hang on to that. And in the New Testament, now in the Old Testament, they could not bring forth that natural life. couldn't bring it forth. Could not bring forth a life that could be a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; God had to do it by attribution. He had to attribute his son to Israel. &gt;&gt; Out of Egypt have I called my son. Speaking of his son. &gt;&gt; All right. You follow that? Likewise, in the New Testament, even though people became filled with the Holy Ghost, they still remained afflicted as being humans with the human weakness. And there's no man, no woman that is able to live sufficiently and satisfactorily the life of Jesus Christ. Regardless of how how devoted they are, how holy they are, whatever they are, they know that there's something yet that is of of imperfection. And there isn't a person that I'm speaking to today that could raise their hands and say, "I'm absolutely more than satisfied with the expression of Jesus Christ in my life." &gt;&gt; And because we can't say that, God in the New Testament has taken and by attribution has attributed the perfection of Jesus Christ to the people that are his elected people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the then the third step is that God have sent down I want to use the word representation and brother Brandham uses it frequently representation. I was going to read John the 4th chapter the woman at the well. Brother Brandham said she had representation in heaven and the priest and by because she had representation. She said, "Thou art the Messiah. You're the prophet." And brother Brand said that's all she could see at that moment. That's all she could see that he was a prophet. But she was moving in the right direction. And then she said, "I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things. I that speak to thee am he." and she identified it, recognized it and the light struck the seed. She was born again and and and he said she did that because she had representation. Now the word representation and it has a a dual meaning and that is simply as we understand it in the English language. We can have uh in the United States I have in the government the house of representatives because those are men that are representing the people. So you can have people uh you can have a representative who's representing the people or we can we ourselves can be a representative. All right. So now it's not in the sense that we are representing something although we do but I don't want to h bring that into the message this morning. I want to bring it on from the other side. You can either represent or you can be in the state of being represented. &gt;&gt; See in one sense I represent our country. You represent your country. We represent our countries in but on the other hand we have somebody up there in our federal government I hope that's representing us. At least we trust us that way. See now we are here representing we're representing Christ. &gt;&gt; We are his representatives. That's that's on one hand. But I want to take it from the other side that we had representation in heaven before you were born. &gt;&gt; Before the earth was created. There was a lamb that was slain. Why was the lamb slain? Because there was somebody was going to fall. There was somebody was going to be in sin. So God already provided a remedy before the sickness even arrived. That is that's the infinite wisdom of God. And so now here we are uh uh and I want to take it from the direction that we have representation. the woman at the well when the Lord Jesus began to uh speak to her and you know the story well and asked her for a drink and and uh uh she said you're a Jew and we don't have dealings with the Samaritans and uh and he said if you knew it was you'd ask me and I'd give you watch how he goes and I'd give you water that you'd never thirst again. So now he was appealing to something. He knew she had a thirst &gt;&gt; and you'll never thirst again. And she said, "Sir, give me this water that I won't thirst again and I won't come here to this well to draw." She still couldn't sort it out. She still had the physical mixed with the spiritual, but it was speaking to her inwardly. And so she said, "I won't come here to to to draw and that I won't thirst again." Then he said, "Go get your husband." Oh, uh, I don't have a husband. That's correct. You've you spoke exactly right. You've had five and the one you have now is not your husband. And she then she's sir, I perceive you're a prophet. See, that's all God allowed her to know at that moment. But she was moving in that direction. Why was she moving in that direction? Is because she had representation and and in heaven. And that representation now had been sent down &gt;&gt; and was standing there and as the scripture said out of the lips of Jesus, "No man can come unto me except the father draw him." And that's exactly what was happening at that moment. The father was drawing her. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God was drawing her. And she she said, "I know when went into the little religious talk about where the Jews worship, where the Samaritans worship and and Jesus and then she said, "I know that when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things." See, she was right on target. She knew precisely. Now, because she had representation, she was actually responding to that representation. The Lord Jesus Christ was representing her. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I that speak to thee am he." And that's when she dropped her water bucket. And the disciples came and marveled that Jesus would be speaking to the woman. And and she departed, left her water bucket, went into the town, and said to the men of the city, "Come and see a man that told me all that ever I did." All Jesus told her, "You've had five husbands. The one you have now is not your husband." That's all he told her. But as far as she was concerned, she had been completely exposed, completely made known. Come see a man that told me. Now, now the prophet said she did that because she had representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said the priest saw the same thing. Now he said the priest was a theologian. The priest was a learned man. And he said that he he learned what was right. He learned that the law was right. He learned that they should keep the Passover. He learned all of these things. That's why friends, we don't want to just learn the message. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just learn these things. I just learned how I should dress. I just learned how I should speak. I just learned how I should go to church or how I learned how I should worship. It wasn't that he said that he had no representation. And because he had no representation, he saw the same thing. He saw the same manifestation the woman saw and he called it bleub. &gt;&gt; And the woman saw it and called it Messiah. &gt;&gt; There's the difference. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, now can I start? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to go through those. the first coming, the second coming, receiving both in the Old Testament and the New Testament by attribution. Oh, I'm so glad for that that it's attributed to us. And we're going to come into that now in just a moment. The Bible says concerning uh man, that he was made in the image of God. And so, in the beginning, God made his image, his son Adam on earth. And the Bible says that he gave him they gave him made him a little lower than the angels and crowned him with glory and honor and did set him over the work of his hands. That's what God had done. And the and the word in the Hebrew when he made him in his image said it is something that has been cut off or a piece of the original. And I like that. Something that's been broken off. something that came off of the original. And I'm going to move along quickly and made him a little lower than the angels and crowned him with glory and and God set him over the work of his hands. Then the image, the masterpiece, because he was a masterpiece, the image fell. He said, "Then this masterpiece, when Satan broke through the walls and marred this masterpiece, but the great sculptor, I believe I read it last Sunday, and I I want to I love this the way it's worded. It's just so marvelous. When he seen the fall of his family, when God saw the fall of his family, the masterpiece, he wasn't willing to just leave it, lay there face down, and ruin. And he went to work immediately to build it up again. He wasn't willing that it should perish. And he's not willing today that it should perish. And he said he he so he went to work immediately and began to build uh again unto his own image a man. And I'll say this at this at this juncture. If God would not leave his image, Adam laying in ruin in the dust in the first Eden. Do you think for a moment that he's going to leave his image which is being made in bride form in this day in human form? You think for a moment he's going to lay allow the the body of the bride of Jesus Christ to lay in ruin &gt;&gt; in Satan's Eden if he wouldn't lay leave Adam in that Eden. He's certainly not going to leave us in this Eden laying in ruin or laying something short of being the image restored image. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Don't think for a moment that he would leave his image broken, defeated. And I'm speaking to you individually. I don't care what your feeling is. He's not going to leave you broken. He's not going to leave you defeated. He's not going to leave you laying face down in Satan's Eden. Say, "I I just can't make it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This God, this sculptor, &gt;&gt; he's he's already on the move. His powers here, the very the very strength of his fingers, the very stroke of the sculptor shaping again the body of Jesus Christ. He's not. Some people say the bride's a mess. I deny that. I refute that. I say it's a glorious church and say, "Well, I see this. I see that. I see I see something else. I see a glorious church." You say, "What eyes are you looking at it?" I'm looking through the eyes of attribution. What you can't do, he's done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The victory you can't achieve, he's already achieved it. He wouldn't leave I He wouldn't leave Adam laying down there and he won't leave you laying here. &gt;&gt; He's not going to leave this bride church laying in the ruin in the 21st century. She's arising in her beauty and perfection &gt;&gt; by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God began building this image of his son all the way through the Old Testament. Christ coming down as I said earlier through the corporate body of the saints being formed by the word of the prophets as it says in Matthew 1. All this was done speaking the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise and it details it and then says all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets. Hallelujah. Jesus was the product of the word of God that came by the prophets. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't underestimate the power of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You're going to sure think I'm gone over the edge. But I can tell you the power of the spoken word that has already been delivered that you said, "Well, I got it in books or I got it in books or I got it in tape or whatever more." Before it was in book or tape form, it was spoken &gt;&gt; and God said and there was &gt;&gt; and God said and it happened. &gt;&gt; And God has already spoken. I'll say to you for my own satisfaction just that what I believe could possibly well be the word that's already been spoken is sufficient to bring the resurrection on. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to say it again. &gt;&gt; I believe the word that was spoken through the prophet's mouth brought communism down &gt;&gt; because the prophet said &gt;&gt; the prophet said the 144,000 the Jews 144,000 must be in Israel. They must be there at this time. &gt;&gt; And here was this great Soviet Union saying, "We're not going to let them go." And God brought them down. Brought them down so suddenly it stunned the world. Brought them down so suddenly it's still a mystery. And brought them into such humility they didn't have any fuel. &gt;&gt; They ran out of fuel and oil and gas and had men I saw the pictures. men at the airport and they needed fuel for the plane and they didn't have enough fuel to fuel the plane to send their engineers into into the north Siberia to turn the gas on &gt;&gt; brought them into such humility. humbled that big powerful nation. &gt;&gt; I tell you that any nation that hasn't got God as their God is a godless nation. &gt;&gt; Any God, any nation that makes science their God is to be pied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I wish for our country, America, Canada, that we don't make uh Hollywood our God. and make entertainment our God. &gt;&gt; Our God is a holy God. The God of the word, &gt;&gt; the God of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so now here he's coming, his second coming being formed by the word of God once again through the prophets in the Old Testament. Prophet said Christ was in Abraham. If you believe it, just say amen. &gt;&gt; Christ was in Isaac. Christ was in Jacob. Christ was in Joseph. Christ was in Moses. And I'll say according to Apostle Paul, and Christ is in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And to a greater degree. &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't see what you see. Moses didn't see what you see. Moses brought a law. And God has demonstrated his grace through you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, my, it's such a positive message." You need it in 207. &gt;&gt; You'll need a more positive message. This world is getting waxing older and more wicked and more evil and more deceitful. And the bride of Jesus Christ is coming into more grace because where sin abounded, grace doth much more abound. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What do you have for 207? More grace. &gt;&gt; What do you have for 207? More revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what we have for 207. More holiness, more of the spirit. &gt;&gt; More dedication. &gt;&gt; We want to plan for it. &gt;&gt; Actually plan for it. I give more time to God. I give more quality time. Hallelujah. I baptized in this spirit that brought this word. &gt;&gt; Don't get caught up with the world in 207 cuz that's going to pass away. &gt;&gt; Education is going to go. &gt;&gt; You need it. Get it. Get whatever you need to get through life. Your business is going to go. &gt;&gt; It's going to be gone. your status, your position. &gt;&gt; You're raised whatever more your bank account's going to &gt;&gt; going to be gone. &gt;&gt; We'll be leaving it all. &gt;&gt; I can't leave it too soon. &gt;&gt; This world's not our home. &gt;&gt; We're just passing through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. all down through the Old Testament. And I'm giving you this. You would say, "Well, sounds like you're repeating yourself." I am &gt;&gt; because I said it. Now, I want to substantiate it with the with some of the message quotes all down through the Old Testament. God appeared in men. God appeared in Abraham as a faith believer. God appeared in David as a king. He appeared in Joseph as righteousness. He appeared in Moses as prophet, priest, lawgiver. He appeared down through the ages in the prophets. He always made himself known in man in portion through the prophets, kings, priest, lawgiver, and so forth. But in Christ, he dwelt in him, the fullness of the godhead bodily. And all that was in God was poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ was poured in. He didn't say into the Old Testament. All of us in Christ is poured into his body. &gt;&gt; She's bone of his bone, &gt;&gt; flesh of his flesh. &gt;&gt; She's spirit of his spirit. &gt;&gt; She's breath of his breath. &gt;&gt; She is him. &gt;&gt; The same as the husband and wife are one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. until the perfect image of the invisible God stood on the earth in the fullness of the Godhead bodily, a bridegroom, the most eligible bachelor waiting for a bride, a worthy bride. &gt;&gt; A piece that would be struck off from him, the building of another masterpiece. And brother Brandham said in Masterpiece, he was so perfected, a redeemer of man, so perfect, so godly, yet there was no beauty that we should desire him. When this virgin born son of the living God became so perfect and humble in the image of God until the great master who had brought his life up through the prophets, notice I'm I'm stressing, he was coming coming. It's not something boom out of the sky. He was coming. He not only he was coming, Mary was coming. &gt;&gt; He's coming. They came together. &gt;&gt; She had a lineage. He had a lineage by attribution. &gt;&gt; And that is why that is why he didn't call her mother. But other place in the Bible's called mother. Brother Brandham said he never called her mother. &gt;&gt; Says to John at the cross, "Behold your mother." Right. &gt;&gt; But yet God attributed attributed that life to her. &gt;&gt; He had to &gt;&gt; he attributed to all of the prophets. And now now by after I'm so glad this is a key point, friends. is a key point for us because that part that you feel insufficient, that part that Satan would needle you about, that that part that Satan would try to defeat you about, that's the part you have to recognize. But God has attributed to me the life of Jesus Christ. What I can't earn, what I can't do, the works I can't achieve, what I'm weak about, God has attributed that life to me. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said up through the prophets, he said, speaking now like God, I've been 4,000 years bringing him to this. And now he's so perfect. I've got to smite him so that he can speak. Oh, just listen the way he says it. He didn't say that he would speak earlier. Jesus did speak and the people marvel at those words. But it says now when he came to his absolute perfection, his perfection, he's now he's going to the cross and God struck him. The sculptor struck him. And the Jews and the Catholics have been fighting for centuries over who killed the Lord Jesus. No one took his life. He said, "No man takes my life. Not Pilate, not Herod, not Caesar, not the Pope, not the Vatican. I give it up." And I will take it up again. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you needed it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You needed the life that was coming back. Oh my &gt;&gt; friends, you might as well hang on. I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; I just I just feel so consumed with it. &gt;&gt; 4,000 years. And then when he's at the conclusion of his life on earth, the masterpiece has been here. And it is such a perfected redeemer. It's it's displaying the attribute of almighty God. In perfection is a redeemer. He's fulfilled all of the prophecies, all the word. And there he hangs on Calvary. There he is. The fulfillment of all of the scripture. And God struck him so a piece would come off. &gt;&gt; And that's us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there we are. &gt;&gt; God struck him. When he struck him, he said, "Speak." &gt;&gt; And I say to you that can catch it. And today he did speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People say William Brandham said, William Brandham said, someone says, someone else said, Luther said, whatever more. I say Jesus Christ said, &gt;&gt; the masterpiece spoke. The masterpiece spoke again, and he spoke words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then comes the bride body of Jesus Christ another masterpiece in the making that he might present it to himself. Paul said in Ephesians 5 and 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church. A glorious church. I'm going to stress this friends. It's not something that is in our imagination. It's here. &gt;&gt; A glorious church. You know, &gt;&gt; somebody is here and probably quite a few that desperately need this message &gt;&gt; today. You want to listen very very close because as I read this and I've preached long enough to know that when we we can read it and we can agree with it, but when it comes to a personal application and say, "But are you that?" Then we get edgy. We say uh that he might present it to himself a glorious church. Say are you that glorious church &gt;&gt; having no spot &gt;&gt; or wrinkle &gt;&gt; or any such thing &gt;&gt; you have to be able to say amen. &gt;&gt; I am that church without spot without wrinkle without blemish without anything inferior. I am that church. I am that individual. I am that part of that masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you can't say it. Some of you are too backward to say it. And here's where the here's where the crunch is. When you when you can't say it and you say, "Oh, God, you have attributed to me &gt;&gt; by attribution." &gt;&gt; You could say like, you could say like Abraham, I can never bring forth this life. I'm dead. You feel dead. &gt;&gt; You feel incapable. &gt;&gt; You feel dormant. &gt;&gt; You feel like a a fence post. &gt;&gt; Sure, we all do. That will never change what God has in his mind and what he attributes. Listen, if somebody came to the bank, your bank, and said, "I want the account of a certain certain person, that was you, and I am depositing $100,000 in this account. It's all done. It's finished. Here's the $100,000." So, the bank notifies you, says certain individual came in here and deposit a h 100,000. Oh, that's impossible. I'm not worthy. Does that change the amount? &gt;&gt; I can't even believe that. I could never make a h 100,000. I can never earn it. I can never Does that change it? &gt;&gt; That doesn't change it. God has already deposited into your account his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Don't diminish the righteousness of Jesus Christ. And don't de don't diminish the thought in God's mind. It is for his children, his elect. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I start asking myself the question. Are you listening close? &gt;&gt; I start asking myself the question I read last thing before I went to sleep last night. I read what I know so so and read so many times and know so clearly the woman at the well. And I I just kept in my mind the prophet said she had representation. She had representation. And I could see how the Lord Jesus was there representing her. But she didn't know she had representation until he drew her. The father drawing her to make her known to make known to her she had representation. I thought I need to make this personal to myself then I need to make it personal to you. Said when did I discover I had representation? I've prayed at altars many times and I've left puddles of tears at altars. I've made a lot of mistakes in backsliden condition or whatever more and repented over it. But that was not it. I had a thirst and I had good brethren, good minister friends and they weren't able to in fact is often I found the thirst intensified as I saw that this was the this malfunctioned and this did not work and this did not fit and I I I I saw that it created a greater thirst because I saw greater questions out there and I I had all of those in my heart. And then when the word of God began to be spoken through a chosen mouth and I declare to you that when the word issued out of the prophet's mouth and he quoted four scriptures for me and questioned me as he did the woman at the well, I didn't think of it until today because I had to ask myself the question or last night rather. When did I recognize that I had representation? And that's when I recognized that I I had I was being represented. I had representation. I want to I want to just say it. When was your moment? And if if it hasn't arrived yet, it needs to. When was your moment? When suddenly the grace and the voice of God came and illuminated your bosom. &gt;&gt; Everybody's experience is different. But the questions for me, I had a thousand questions, deep questions, troubling questions, and they just dissolved under that enormous light. They just dissolved. You had questions, questions about life, questions about what was right, questions about truth, questions about the inconsistencies with what people had taught you and what was right. And they said, "This is truth, but it never brought any peace, never brought any rest." And even some have come to the message. Some have come to the message. And I have to say there are a lot of distressed people in the message. Doesn't change the message. That's because a lot of people are purporting a certain thing to be the message that's not the message. And it doesn't bring peace. It doesn't bring stability. But this word as I see it come out of the prophet's mouth, it brings such rest and such peace. It's the answer. And I can say, "Come see a man that told me all that ever I did." &gt;&gt; And I found I had representation. I've been thinking about it since I was in Brazil. Made a note. Made a note here. Made a note there. You have to know in fact is the reason why the word came to you and was presented to you as it has been and and and it began to match something that was on the inside. I want to announce to you that very act there's two things I want to say. That very act number one was God informing you that you had representation because you're recognizing your representative on earth. &gt;&gt; This message represents me. &gt;&gt; There is no other message that says you didn't do it in the first place. Now, the devil and all of his hordes along with my imagination and my memory channel tell me I did do it. &gt;&gt; I did mess up. &gt;&gt; I did fail. But then when I go to the truth of the word of God, &gt;&gt; then I can see that God has attributed to me what I can't produce myself. You say, "Wow, that could get to be a pretty slippery slope of grace." Not a bit. Not if you see it in the light of the word. And I hope that God can allow me to bring it to you the way it should be brought to you. &gt;&gt; You got to see it's attributed to us. How how was David? Listen, how was David? I just I'll just make these comparison and you you give me sufficient time. I I pray that you would. How was David ever going to be a man who shed too much blood to even build a building, a physical building for the Lord? Said you can't do it. You've shed too much blood. How's that kind of man? How's the kind of man who sends a good husband to the front lines? A man Uriah who brother Brandham says one of the first people he wants to shake hands with is Uriah. And he sends him to the front lines to get killed so he can have his wife Ba Sheeba. And somehow in the great plan of God that I can't understand, Ba Sheba had to be his wife because she had to bring forth Solomon. &gt;&gt; You think about it. &gt;&gt; If you think you figured out God, you just go home and say, "I don't hardly know anything." &gt;&gt; We can't figure that out. And yet God looked upon David. Says, "A man after my own heart." Because David had a had a certain uh characteristic about him. I can tell you one thing. Read the first 40 chapters and you'll find he was a man who who lived in repentance. He didn't just come to a spot and kneel down and say, "Oh, God, forgive me. I failed you." "Tet, etc." He wallowed in his repentance. He he asked God to forgive him. And he was in such a state of repentance. And God loved him &gt;&gt; and loved him so much God decreed something that he couldn't produce of his own loins. &gt;&gt; He produced a you know he produced a son that tried to disinherit him and tried to take his throne &gt;&gt; as well as producing a Solomon. We produced some pretty sure &gt;&gt; sad things. You say, "Well, is God going to is God going to charge me for that? Is God going to hold me accountable for that?" But God in his great plan said, "I'm going to give David because he believes me." &gt;&gt; That's the key. He believes me. &gt;&gt; When I gave him a promise, he believed me. Abraham believed me. &gt;&gt; And that meant so much to God. He said, "I'm going to nullify you. I'm going to invalidate &gt;&gt; what you fell into &gt;&gt; because you've been born with a sinful nature. &gt;&gt; I'm going to invalidate it &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give I'm going to put in your bank account. you're bankrupt morally, but I'm going to put my son Jesus Christ in your bank accountus. &gt;&gt; And today it would even take on new dimension because he would put the spirit within us, the Holy Ghost within us. &gt;&gt; It would cause us to be victorious and cause us to believe more. Generations of Jesus Christ. The book, it's not a very long book. the first verse of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. I'm stressing those words because as they were in the Old Testament and if you see their life back there, project that into the New Testament. And it really is no different what God did. He attributed his son to them. Jesus coming on down. Now, I just want to make some comments, some statements, and I'm I'm going to just read this. Every human child has been born with an inherited sinful nature. Could you agree with that? &gt;&gt; You can take a child, Brother John, sister Vanessa had their child dedicated. they could take and protect that child and keep it so to never hear an evil word, never say an evil thing, but it'll it'll kick and scream and show its nature one day along the way cuz it's in them. &gt;&gt; Inherited sinful nature of sinful flesh. And if you wanted to put it down, you could read Romans 8 and3. This is the result of our parents, Adam and Eve, to whom we are all genetically related. &gt;&gt; Each generation without exception has sinned. Romans 3 and 23. All have sinned and passed on. And the scripture which I read says even they that did not sin after Adam's simultude but death passed upon all. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So what about the person says I didn't sin like Adam sinned. Why is death passed upon me? Because he got it by attribution. &gt;&gt; It was death was attributed to him. &gt;&gt; Even though he didn't sin according to Adam's sin. But yet he he reaped Adam's penalty. &gt;&gt; See, so you say, "Well, is that fair?" Well, it's as fair as you not being able to be righteous, but God count you righteous. &gt;&gt; It's six of one, half a dozen of the other. And so sin is passed on and it sinful nature to each succeeding generation. Wherefore is by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin sin entered into the world by one man. Are you still alert? &gt;&gt; If you get too tired I'll have you stand up, shake hands, but I should just keep on preaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all. Death passed upon all men. For that all have sinned. For until the law was in the world, but sin was not imputed where there is no law. It wasn't imputed where there's no law. There's only one exception to this. genetically past fallen human race which was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus grew in the womb of Mary in the same manner as any baby but he was different from all other babies. He was not genetically related to either Mary or Joseph for both had an inherited sinful nature. Jesus was sinless without genetic flaw since he was to serve as the spotless sacrificial lamb of God. &gt;&gt; He had no DNA. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of Mary &gt;&gt; and no DNA of Joseph. &gt;&gt; He was absolutely and brother Brandham says Jesus was not the blood of a Jew nor Gentile. He was a creative blood by Jehovah himself. He was the blood of God. Do you accept that? Of course we do. The Bible said that we're saved by the blood of God, not the blood of a Jew or the blood of a Gentile. It all be sex, but this was the blood of God. &gt;&gt; The physical body of Jesus Christ was clearly a special creation of God placed in Mary's womb. And this is the doctrine of the virgin birth. Now, this someone else wrote and I'm just going to read it and just see where people now, Brother Brandham said these things 40 years ago, but here's people at this Christmas coming up with what a prophet said a long time ago. Thus, this man wrote, "Neither Christ's spirit nor his body resulted from the DNA of Mary's egg or from any man's sperm. Both would have contained inherited genetic defects and the sin nature. As scripture tells us, Jesus was truly the second Adam. The first Adam was a special creation of God, not related to any human being. That's right. &gt;&gt; Adam was not related to any human being. And so was the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Jesus was just as fully human as the first Adam. &gt;&gt; And just like the first Adam, he had no sin nature, no inherited sin, and no sinful flesh, which has always been passed from one generation to the next. Adam and Eve's sin. Uh he was absolutely pure and without sin from the day he was born till the day he died. He had to be he was the lamb of God without blemish or spot sacrificed for sins. So now how are we ever going to attain to something like that? Just be at peace. You never will. &gt;&gt; Neither can you. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to go out of this service today and say, "Father, I perhaps didn't grasp everything. I don't expect you to. I've been pondering this for quite a while. I've been studying it since I was in Brazil. This mighty truth of righteousness being attributed to the individual because you can never produce the life of Jesus Christ on your own." Now, that does not make an allowance for someone to say, "Oh my, you know, now I can let down the bars and kind of do what I want to do." That proves you didn't have it in the first place. &gt;&gt; That proves you never had it in the first place. Anybody says, "Oh, now I can live loose. Now I can just live in the world and I can't produce it anyway, so why try?" That's not it. &gt;&gt; That's not it. The individual, the individual who has that seed, who has representation, they got something here that's crying for it. They got something that's craving for it. You're yearning for it. You're desiring. You're doing everything that is possible within your the scope of your ability. And furthermore, we have the uncction. This is a reality, friends. And some here need the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Some think that brother Brandham did away with that. He didn't do away with it. He emphasized it even more and more. The Holy Spirit in an individual's life. He spoke about the things that Daniel did and and he says and they didn't even have the Holy Spirit. We have it's the Holy Spirit who gave life to the word. It's the Holy Spirit that gives revelation of the message. And we have a baptism of that Holy Spirit. It is an infusion. I listened to a message and it's from that time and I thought it was so fitting for tonight if I have any comments tonight but I'll just say from that time there is a moment when a man or a woman meets God &gt;&gt; and from that time you will be a different creature. You'll be a different individual. And from that time, &gt;&gt; maybe you haven't arrived there yet, but when you do, &gt;&gt; when you meet God, you'll be a different person. Moses was a different person after the burning bush. &gt;&gt; Peter was a different person after Pentecost. They're different people. Turn cowards into brave men. I won't go on with that, but but that's what we have to do. Now, I'm just going to give myself another few minutes and then I'm going to close. How many times you students of the message, how many times did the prophet use the word attribute that you are a manifested attribute of God? Now that either means what is said &gt;&gt; or it has no meaning at all. &gt;&gt; That you sitting here today are an attribute of the mind of God. Now in this human state, there is no way that you can fulfill completely what God had in his mind physically speaking. &gt;&gt; You don't have the wherewithal. &gt;&gt; We're too filled with failures and weaknesses and the flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; You say things and you you say it and said, you know, Lord Jesus, help me. You would have never said that. &gt;&gt; We think things say, "Lord, forgive me. You'd have never thought of that." And if we and if we lived in that state, we would go down in despair. God, how can I ever believe that I am a son of God? How can I ever believe that? How can I ever believe that I'm an expression of Jesus Christ on earth? God knew exactly the picture he had in his mind of you before the foundation of the world. He knew what you were going to be. He knew that his spirit would come into you. He knew that you'd experienced a new birth and what you were not capable of because he saw you also in this fallen state by attribution. &gt;&gt; He's going to create and make that part that you can't do. &gt;&gt; And you shall be the full picture. In fact, that if that revelation of attribution I I'm able to live up here, I can increase. I get higher but I always feel I'm missing something. Missing something. You are indeed missing something. And if you don't have a revelation that God by attribution as it was in the Old Testament, Israel could have said even as a nation is a corporate structure. How are we going to bring a Messiah? We we we've we've been spending 70 years in Babylon. We're in Babylon. &gt;&gt; We're a bunch of slaves. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're 400 years in Egypt &gt;&gt; and the Messiah come here. We are muders &gt;&gt; and we got a prophecies. The pro the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you and him shall you hear. Just envision yourself not sitting in a nice church today, but envision yourself in a slime pit &gt;&gt; up to your knees wallowing in mud making bricks for a tyrant &gt;&gt; so he can build some name for himself in the world &gt;&gt; and you have a prophet telling you you're going to bring forth a messiah. Messiah. My daddy's been here. My granddaddy died in the slime pit. My greatgranddaddy was in this. As far as I know, we've been here almost 400 years. &gt;&gt; And there's no hope of a deliverance. &gt;&gt; It's getting worse &gt;&gt; now. There's no straw. Do you get my picture? &gt;&gt; You think you're in a pathetic state. What about that one? &gt;&gt; But God attributed his son &gt;&gt; to that nation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He attributed the life of Jesus Christ by attribution. &gt;&gt; God out of his own will, out of his own bosom, by his own decree, &gt;&gt; said, "My son shall come out of Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is meat. &gt;&gt; You want to chew on it? &gt;&gt; And that same principle applies to the individual. Sure, some of Israel, they they gave up. They were in wars and were defeated. If you read the Old Testament, it's a really a sad record in a lot of places. Amen. &gt;&gt; You read about kings and and people and and and in my own heart as I read about Joel, the the king Joel and and Josiah rather and the thing and then see such a defeat at the end of how can this happen? You know, thousands of them slaughtered and God, what is your program? What is your plan? Never change the mind of God. You say, "I can't figure that out." That's a good thing you can't figure it out. But God in his mind says, "This nation, this man Abraham, I selected. This nation came out of him by a certain line, and this nation I've chosen." And even in the world, in the state that it's in can't get God to change his mind. &gt;&gt; Israel is God's people. And regardless of what the you think or regardless of what the church world says, regardless of what they say about this message, you'll never get God to change his mind about his vindicated message. &gt;&gt; Wasn't William Brandon a vindicated. It was God that vindicated it. &gt;&gt; In case some here may not like his name, but I'll tell you, God loved his name. &gt;&gt; I want his name to represent me, &gt;&gt; and he was God's representative on earth. &gt;&gt; Who else had that? Who else said draw up the line, bring up the people and stand there before the first one and describe what a prophet is and what he says has to be true. Every time true and then stand and say, "Does anybody want to take my place?" Do you know in all the time of 33 years of ministry, no one ever stood up to take his place? &gt;&gt; Even with all those ministers in Chicago, he said, "You you brought me here to trap me here. He said, "I want someone to come and stand beside me." No one came and stood beside him. &gt;&gt; They feared that presence. &gt;&gt; They knew that was none other than the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I that message and that ministry was my that's what drew me. &gt;&gt; And today again, it came with new appreciation. I'm so And now I know why uh we are drawn to that. Now, I know why it draws us so deeply. It's because we're looking at our representation. [Music] &gt;&gt; God sent down and he said, "Am I speaking too loud?" &gt;&gt; God sent down, the prophet said, "God sent down her representation." &gt;&gt; God sent down to us a representation. And the fact that it called you and spoke to you and drew you was God testifying to you. You're you came from me. And I sent this down to let you know you're represented in heaven. &gt;&gt; And we're going to close in just a few more moments now. an attribute. I want to get get this across to you before I close. Brother Brandon, we use the word so many times. An attribute is first and foremost a quality. A certain quality. Hold on to it. Please don't don't don't don't don't let your thoughts drift down. An attribute first and foremost is a certain quality. A quality denotes a thing. A quality denotes a thing or shall I say a person as being what they really are. Now the prophet says and he speaks about you being an attribute of God. &gt;&gt; You are a certain quality of God. &gt;&gt; And when he uses the word attribute, he is declaring on the earth that that's what you really are. &gt;&gt; And when you read all the quotes about the attributes of God, you say, "I don't measure up." No, your representation has said, "But that's what you really are." &gt;&gt; And it and and and furthermore, it is an attribute is to ascribe to a person what is surely his. It's telling you that God has ascribed this to you. God has put it in your bank account. &gt;&gt; God has imputed it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God counted him for righteousness. And that's what it says in the scripture that God accounted I'd like to just read those uh scriptures. I just come to it. Uh what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found? For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory but not before God. And he asked, "What sayith the scripture?" Because now Paul is going to quote out of Psalms. Abraham believed God. That's what he did do. And it was counted unto him for righteousness. And this word counted is first and foremost. And God counted it to him for righteousness. You all listening? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The first interpretation of the word he counted it is to think. &gt;&gt; God thought of him because he believed God. And between believing was all of his frailties and weaknesses and and and taking Hagar and having Ishmael and going down and and calling his wife his sister, which she was his halfsister, and and telling the king things that weren't exactly right, and and on down and he backslid. The prophet said went into another country, had all of that, but between that that he believed God [Music] And down here, God said, "I am counting you because I thought of you &gt;&gt; because I thought of you." &gt;&gt; I think of you as being righteous. &gt;&gt; That was in his thinking. &gt;&gt; I can't stop just for a few moments. Listen, help me. God thought of you. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of scriptures. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of scriptures. It says it counted to him. It counted to him for righteousness. The very scripture says those that those that did not sin after Adam sinned, death, the same God let death pass upon all even though they didn't commit the same sin. &gt;&gt; Death was imputed to them. &gt;&gt; But now life is imputed. Righteousness is imputed. Hallelujah. Everything we couldn't earn is imputed to us. It's credited to us, &gt;&gt; given to us. You might say, I I've got that, brother. I've got that. I've got that. Why don't you carry on? Because surely as we get out of this service, someone say, you know, I didn't quite get it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it till you get it. &gt;&gt; It's accounted to you. I know all of you here as believers have said, "Abraham's our father in the faith." Hey, where's your connection to Abraham? &gt;&gt; You don't have any connection to Abraham. You don't have any natural connection connection to Abraham, but God in his word &gt;&gt; has declared it so. &gt;&gt; So you say, "I believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; And when you say I believe that, even though God says, "Huh, you're you're millions of generations away from Abraham." But you know what? I'm going to close that gap. And because you believed it, I'm going to make you his daughter. I'm going to make you his son. &gt;&gt; I'm going to decree it. You are indeed a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And along with that, I'm going to pass on some benefits. You've got the faith of Abraham. You got the faithfulness of Abraham. I'm going to give you his qualities because you get them by attribution. &gt;&gt; You can never earn them. You can never fix it. You can never patch it up. You can never make your roots ever go back there. &gt;&gt; But God give it to you by attribution. &gt;&gt; And even so, are you a son of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God thought of it &gt;&gt; in a future home. And I really must close. It's hard for me to close. You know, I study for all these hours and then try and put it here in a couple. It's it's difficult. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is eternal. Then you are in eternity where you were all the time, &gt;&gt; but you've just recognized what happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were made for an eternal purpose because you are the manifestation. You are the manifestation of an attribute of God. You're the manifestation of a quality of God. &gt;&gt; You're the manifestation of one of God's qualities, a actual part of God. The creator of heavens and earth has deposited within his elect a part of himself. Thus you can say I came from the bosom of God and I will go back to the bosom of God. And how do you know that? Because my faith declares it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the message of God's message in every hour come the way. Come by the people even as Jesus came and sat on the well. So common, so natural. Who could say any great spiritual thing was going to happen before the day was out? Oh &gt;&gt; friends, don't let the devil dupe you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and and dull your minds by the natural events of your life by the natural thing. And when when Jesus had ministered to that woman and the disciples came and the disciples were all taken up with the food, oh here master, we got we got lunch and they start getting it all ready. He wouldn't eat. Aren't you hungry? Don't you want to eat? Well, he had just given the woman. &gt;&gt; He had satisfied her thirst. &gt;&gt; So, she never would thirst again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by doing that, he satisfied his hunger. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I have meat to eat that you don't know anything about. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have meat to eat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Lift up your eyes." &gt;&gt; Oh, they put our Well, same old hills we always looked at. &gt;&gt; No, look on the fields. &gt;&gt; Fields. Fields. What fields? &gt;&gt; They're white already to harvest. &gt;&gt; Don't say there's four months to the harvest. We look into 207. I don't know what's going to happen on 207, but I know what I'm enjoying at this moment. that God because because he thought of attributes he had to think. And when he thought he thought of I'm going to attribute this now. Isn't this glorious? Isn't this more glorious? Isn't it more glorious that God would bring people that were fallen and defeated and give them by attribution perfection? Isn't that a lot more glorious than he brought a whole bunch of good people and said, "Well, you're good people anyway. Now I'll just give you something good. Amen. &gt;&gt; No. Be better that he brought a bunch of wretched people. &gt;&gt; People that were &gt;&gt; in sin, &gt;&gt; people that were bound. People that were possessed of devils. People who couldn't help themselves, wretches of humanity. And God in his grace picks them up. &gt;&gt; And he knows in his thought they can never do it in their own strength. But in my thought, I thought of them as perfection. I thought of them as my children &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take them from that point in a quantum leap right over here to perfection. They can't do it, but I have thought of them as having already done it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And because of that, I will send down I'll prove that that they have a seed in them. I'll send down representation representation that they have in heaven. I'm going to send it down. And they're going to be in such a murky condition and their mind will be so clouded. They'll be so occupied with things of this life. But I'll just come there. They'll be so burdened. They'll be so messed up. Like the woman at the well. They'll be so messed up, so defeated that I'll just come on the pathway one day. I'll just start to speak to them. I'll bring them into a meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I know people I know a young man who was in the army in Singapore and one of the believers was after him and after him and after him. You need to come and see this video. You need to come and see this film. It was deep called the deep. Come on and see this film. Oh, well, he didn't want to go. He didn't want to go. He wasn't a believer. And he thought, uh, so he said to another friend of his, "Hey, I I'm going to see a film tonight. Do you want to come along and see?" Yeah, okay. I'll go with you. So, so they both go, the guy who was pressed on and invited and witnessed to and everything else, he just went away and the other guy became a believer. &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it, but when he got there, how many people here? &gt;&gt; How many people here? I know that I don't need your hand. How many people? You're just filled with all kinds of confusion and questions and darkness and so on. And then a light shone your way. &gt;&gt; Oh my, this is so glorious. And one of the first things I have to tackle with people when they come to say why me. And I have to tell them, I don't know why you, but I'm no good. You are right. You're no good. But God did it anyway. That's the grace. That's the marvelous part of this. Hallelujah. I announce to you, Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ, there will be many failures perhaps in 207. But let me announce to you for 207 the best news I can give you that God, he had a thought. &gt;&gt; And his thought caused him to impute or accredit to you perfection, &gt;&gt; maturity. &gt;&gt; Can I have two more minutes? You go read the ris rising of the sun again. Go and hear rising of the sun again and you'll come to this part. Brother Brandham goes in the Old Testament. Don't don't get lost in the Old Testament. Now he goes to the Old Testament and the and and and the celebration of the sheath waving and to wave a sheath. And it's very unusual because in the Old Testament, if you read it, I think Leviticus 23, it says, "And they will cut down the first grain. that comes that is ripe and mature, he'll cut down. The man will cut it down and he'll take that first sheath to the priest, &gt;&gt; not the king &gt;&gt; and not the prophet. &gt;&gt; To the priest. Hold that. Because he comes in three sons, &gt;&gt; son of man, son of God, son of David. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he'll take it to the priest and he says and the priest will wave it before God &gt;&gt; not before the people he'll raise it be wave it before God as a memorial &gt;&gt; to God now that's where it ends and a prophet comes and gives us an understanding why it's a memorial to God because the sheath that came out of the earth oh my &gt;&gt; and be it was the first one that got ripe &gt;&gt; it was cut down. &gt;&gt; It was the first one that was perfect. It was the first one that was mature and it was cut down and taken to the priest's office. And the priest waved it before God. And the prophet comes and tells us because why was it waved as a memorial before God? Because it was a testimony to God that there was more like that sheep in the earth. &gt;&gt; More like him in the earth. And you'll come to the place where brother says and again &gt;&gt; in this day &gt;&gt; there had to be another sheep wave. &gt;&gt; That one that was waved, he was cut down. It was the first image that ever came to perfection. And he was cut down, hung on a tree, and raised up again the third day. And he was waved over the people a blessing as he ascended. &gt;&gt; But he said there has to be another wave, &gt;&gt; another sheath waving. &gt;&gt; That one by a virgin-born son and this one by a redeemed son. &gt;&gt; What would it do for us if we just saw a virgin son? He was waved over the people. But God in his mercy showing that he can attribute to a man born in sin, shape in iniquity, made mistakes. But God brought him to a mature state &gt;&gt; with such maturity that the Lord Jesus Christ himself was in full attendance all the time at his side. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And he said, "And again today in the rising of the sun, I sat in that service 1965." "And again it had to be waved over the people." And he said, "And again, what was it?" It was a ministry &gt;&gt; being waved over the people. &gt;&gt; The reason I say 1965, hang on to it now. That was that was in the era of the dispensation of the office of the son of god which was the priesthood era. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The priesthood era and the sheath had to be taken to the priest and before brother Brandham passed off the scene and that priesthood era is going to go to a son of David son of David office. One of the last things he did was identify that he was waving this ministry. God was waving it over the people, a mature son of God with a declaration. There's more like this in the field. And you were not even born then. Most of you were not even born. Think of the grace of God that God waved a sheath. God waved a ministry over this earth that one day you'd hear it and say, "Oh, that speaks to me. That gives me water that I never thirst again." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make an old man feel young again. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Can I enjoy my religion? &gt;&gt; Good. You enjoy it, too. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hard to get stopped. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it's good news for the new year. &gt;&gt; We'll meet tonight at 9:00. Come a little bit early. We'll get started. We'll have our musicians. We're going to stand and sing. My goodness, I was 20 minutes beyond the time I thought I was going to quit. But when you're having fun, time passes quickly, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somehow I think that that little woman at the well, I don't think she was watching the sun dial &gt;&gt; saying, you know, sir, I'm in a hurry. I got to go home and wash some clothes. Give me some more of this water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just thank him a moment. Gracious Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; how lovely you are. &gt;&gt; We are unworthy, but we say how lovely you are. I can see in the faces of this congregation, oh God, as they hear the word and &gt;&gt; in their soul rises and in their voices, in their mouth. Amen. Thanksgiving to you. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you personally in all the areas of our failings and oh God how how Jesus you said the flesh is weak and we have found it so. But you also said the spirit is willing and we have found that so and this morning we are here with willing spirits oh God. Our souls say yay and amen. We believe oh God that you have identified us for representation. You have represented us with a word with a message and oh God we identify with it and it has done so much for us. I pray that you'll bless this people oh Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. give them a refreshing this afternoon and this evening Lord as we come to rejoice, we come to hear testimonies, we come to sing. I pray Lord you will our worship and our testimonies will be acceptable in your sight and that you'll be glorified amongst us Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; I started off with many things about tomorrow. I'd like to sing that song. [Music] The first verse plays the first verse. I don't know about tomorrow.

Give us a word of greeting from Belgium and pray a prayer of blessing upon this people as we close out this year. many things [Music] tomorrow. I don't see I understand. [Applause] [Music] That's exactly what happened in our little church. Uh we didn't know and we still don't know. &gt;&gt; We had an old building and it had to be sold. We didn't know where to go and just 3 days before we came here, God gave us a solution and we believe the Lord will help us. So also in our private lives very often it's like everything is blocked but he opens the way and that's what he did yesterday he does it today and he do it tomorrow. Let us thank him heavenly father. How little we feel when we see what you have done for us day by day by day. How little faith we had by ourselves. We could bring nothing. And every time again, Lord, you came and you supplied every need. How gracious we are. How thankful you we are Lord. Help us Lord now to be able to take the next step. Thank you for every word this morning. We are sure Lord that it was not only brother Biscll but it was your spirit through every one of us speaking back to us Lord &gt;&gt; and building up that faith &gt;&gt; that nobody else could give us but you &gt;&gt; now as we go on our ways please be with us and bring us back here tonight for a worship Lord. that the world will never understand. Praise be your holy name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. And between the service of this morning and this evening, I would like to encourage you along the line of a plan. Nothing happens without a plan. And I think it would be real good if you just go home and ponder this afternoon. What is my spiritual plan in this coming year? Not a resolution, a plan. Something that say, well, you know, if you don't have a plan, nothing really happens. Say, well, I want to read the Bible more. Well, that doesn't really doesn't really work. But if you set a plan, say, you know, this is what is on my heart to do. And I I'm going to do that. I'm And I I pray for this church. This church will be the greatest witness year of our entire existence. &gt;&gt; God bless you. In the name of Jesus, you're dismissed. Amen. [Music] Thank you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Thank you. [Music] Awesome God. [Music] Lord [Music] Jesus Christ right No, never. [Music]
