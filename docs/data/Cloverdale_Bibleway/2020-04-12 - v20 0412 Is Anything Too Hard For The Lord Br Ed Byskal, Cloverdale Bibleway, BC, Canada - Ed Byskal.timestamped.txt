[12:08] Hallelujah.
[12:10] Thank you Lord Jesus. We have a couple
[12:11] of prayer requests that just like to
[12:14] read out.
[12:20] Sister Leverne
[12:23] Clemens has uh some symptoms
[12:27] of a stroke and weakness in one arm. So
[12:30] we just want to remember our sister
[12:31] Lever in prayer.
[12:34] Also, Brother Darren Hoffman's nephew,
[12:39] Noah Mley,
[12:40] is suffering from
[12:43] seizures. Um, while brother Darren was
[12:47] giving testimony Wednesday night, the
[12:49] enemy struck this young lad, I think
[12:53] he's 9 or 10 years old,
[12:56] with seizure that night and he's had
[12:58] four more since. He's in the hospital
[13:00] undergoing tests, but
[13:03] the cause has not been found.
[13:06] But brother Darren writes, "The devil
[13:08] can hide from the doctors, but he can't
[13:10] hide from God."
[13:13] &gt;&gt; And they'll be streaming this service
[13:15] this morning. So, we just want to bring
[13:17] that before the throne of grace this
[13:19] morning. Let's just bow our heads while
[13:22] they play this
[13:24] song softly.

[22:07] I was thinking of each of you and uh my
[22:12] heart was so fixed on on uh just being
[22:18] connected with you. And I I began to
[22:23] feel as though I was there and you were
[22:26] here and there was no separation. there
[22:29] is no time zone and I want to speak a
[22:32] little bit about that a little later on.
[22:35] But to those that are in Switzerland and
[22:38] uh those that came up from Belgium to
[22:41] the meetings for the last 12 years and
[22:45] Germany, Croatia,
[22:47] Italy, Russia, and China, I want to send
[22:53] greetings to the saints in China. three
[22:56] or four of the brothers are uh

[23:19] this streaming. We say praise God.

[23:23] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful. And the one brother
[23:25] said he was so thankful he was able to
[23:28] suffer. My my wife when once when I was
[23:33] incarcerated
[23:34] uh for several days, but my wife just
[23:38] was filled with such joy to think that
[23:41] we could join the host of the saints
[23:44] down through the ages that have been uh
[23:48] suffered much persecution. And we're
[23:51] thankful for that. Amen.

[24:32] brother Tim Puit's son-in-law. And I
[24:35] would like to say and expressed my

[28:11] that God will bless this connection and
[28:14] bless the people as they hear all of
[28:16] those that were involved in the
[28:19] translations and in the streaming work.

[29:19] sister Colen Bruner, senior and brother
[29:23] Garrett Rodald that was at the meetings
[29:26] there in Germany how we thank you. And
[29:29] you had Sister Biscll tell her
[29:32] testimony.
[29:34] Actually, I must make a confession. You
[29:36] asked me to ask her and I, Brother Colin
[29:40] Brunner, I didn't do that. I I thought,
[29:43] well, I'll leave it to you. And I did
[29:47] not ask her because if I had asked her,
[29:50] she would maybe not have done it. But
[29:53] you so gracefully asked her and your
[29:56] wife asked her and uh had the chairs
[30:01] sitting up on the platform and my
[30:03] daughter Linda Ardal
[30:07] uh her husband is here with us now. And
[30:11] I am so thankful that she was there to
[30:15] be with her mother to give her
[30:17] encouragement. And what a beautiful
[30:20] thing it was. And brother Coen Bruner,
[30:23] how you said to me that was the icing on
[30:26] the cake. Well, I I mentioned that to
[30:30] her and she appreciated that so much.
[30:32] God bless you. And uh
[30:36] so we have so many that we wander, but
[30:40] we just say our heavenly father knows
[30:44] all that were engaged to make the
[30:47] meetings in Switzerland so special. And
[30:51] the brothers from here have been there
[30:54] and have participated and and brother
[30:57] David Mayor has been here and
[31:00] participated in the camp meeting and we
[31:04] appreciate that so much. We've been
[31:06] blessed by the ministry and blessed how
[31:09] these nations have come uh very close
[31:13] together and the people and the
[31:15] believers have become very close
[31:18] together. Our heavenly father has seen
[31:21] that.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; But there's a greater gathering
[31:24] coming and we will all be there by God's
[31:28] grace. God bless you.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Our brother Fran, our brother, pastor
[31:35] Mariano from Italy sent greetings and he
[31:39] sent us a message. All is well.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; All is well with them down in Polarmo, I
[31:45] believe it is in Italy. and uh he was on
[31:48] the phone with my wife. So I want to
[31:51] extend those greetings to you also uh
[31:54] brother
[31:55] Mariano
[31:57] in Italy. God bless you. Now if I may
[32:02] take
[32:04] your time this morning, I want to
[32:08] uh have you read some scriptures with
[32:11] me. And if you have a few moments, just
[32:16] grab a piece of paper if you would have
[32:19] a pen or pencil handy because you will
[32:22] want to make references
[32:25] uh of the many quotes which I have of
[32:28] different places. And I would like to
[32:32] uh express to you
[32:35] uh my joy in being and presenting this
[32:39] to you on this special Easter
[32:43] resurrection day. And I'm mindful too
[32:48] how everyone globally, not just here,
[32:52] but globally
[32:54] in many countries, you are isolated in
[32:58] your home, but you're not isolated from
[33:00] the Holy Spirit. He's present not only
[33:04] with you but to give you the same
[33:09] uh presence and the same feeling that we
[33:12] have here in this in this sanctuary
[33:15] today. God bless you is our prayer.
[33:20] I would like you to take your Bibles if
[33:23] you would and please turn to Genesis the
[33:28] 18th chapter and we'll read from the 9th
[33:31] verse.
[33:49] We'll read from the ninth verse, but I
[33:51] especially want you to uh watch the 13th
[33:55] and 14th verse when we come to it
[34:04] starting at the ninth verse. And they
[34:08] said unto him,
[34:10] where is Sarah? Unto him which was
[34:14] Abraham. They said unto him, "Where is
[34:18] Sarah, thy wife?" And he said, "Behi,
[34:23] behold, in the tent." And he said, "I
[34:27] will certainly return unto thee
[34:30] according to the time of life, and lo
[34:33] Sarah thy wife shall have a son." And
[34:36] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[34:40] was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah
[34:45] were old and well stricken in age, and
[34:50] it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[34:52] manner of women.
[34:56] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[35:00] saying, After I am waxed old,
[35:04] and I shall I have pleasure with my Lord
[35:09] being old also. And the Lord said unto
[35:13] Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
[35:17] saying, Shall I of assurity
[35:21] uh bear a child which I'm old,
[35:26] and and is anything too hard for the
[35:31] Lord? At the time appointed, I will
[35:35] return unto thee." The angel of the Lord
[35:38] spoke to Abraham,
[35:41] I will return unto thee according to the
[35:45] time of life, and Sarah shall have a
[35:48] son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh
[35:52] not, for she was afraid. And he said,
[35:58] Nay, but thou did laugh. Now I I want to
[36:04] ask this waiting congregation and the
[36:08] streaming congregation in whatever
[36:11] country you are in or whatever country
[36:13] you will hear this in. I think that the
[36:17] this is and I want to stress this
[36:21] uh this is a very special moment because
[36:25] the angel of the Lord has said
[36:28] I will return
[36:31] unto thee
[36:33] according to the time of life and Sarah
[36:37] shall have a son. That's verse 14.
[36:43] and he said, "Is anything too hard for
[36:47] the Lord?
[36:50] At the time appointed, I will return
[36:53] unto thee." Now, I want to ask
[36:57] uh all of those that go to this assembly
[37:01] and are listening this morning, I want
[37:04] to ask is the miracle is the great
[37:08] miracle of that angel
[37:11] is the miracle
[37:14] that
[37:16] uh that he would return
[37:19] or is the miracle that she shall have a
[37:22] son?
[37:24] Which one of those two?
[37:27] Because
[37:28] when he said, "Is anything too hard for
[37:32] thee?" Brother Brandham had an
[37:34] experience and I quote this
[37:39] some time ago. I was speaking on that
[37:42] and a preacher wrote me a letter. He
[37:46] said, "Brother Brandom,
[37:48] get next to yourself."
[37:52] He said, "You mean to say that that was
[37:56] God?"
[37:59] I said, "It was God."
[38:04] Well, then how did he get there? Now, a
[38:07] preacher,
[38:08] &gt;&gt; here's a man who understands the
[38:10] scriptures.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And his question is not
[38:15] was she going to have a son? His
[38:17] question was, "How did he get there?
[38:22] How did this angel of the Lord get
[38:23] there?" And brother Brennham said,
[38:25] "Well, he did just get uh and he he
[38:29] didn't complete the answers." And you
[38:32] will you will get it as I move along in
[38:36] the quotes a little later on because he
[38:39] said you cannot take you cannot teach
[38:42] Pentecostal babies
[38:44] &gt;&gt; supernatural things and this was beyond
[38:48] the human language. This was even beyond
[38:52] explanation.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; This is something that could not be
[38:55] explained.
[38:57] How could uh how could an angel from the
[39:00] Lord uh tell what was in Sarah's heart
[39:04] in the tent door behind him? And and now
[39:07] now we have a messenger that was here
[39:11] and I happened to be in two of the
[39:13] meetings when this actually took place.
[39:16] And he turned his back. He said, "I will
[39:19] turn my back." Now, you will hear when
[39:22] I'm reading and you'll have the
[39:23] references. That's why I want you to
[39:26] have a pencil and paper with you so that
[39:29] you can reference the quote and go back
[39:33] to it and ask yourself the question.
[39:37] Then God now I'm going to make a
[39:40] statement just now. God had him and
[39:44] directed the messenger of this age to
[39:47] turn his back to the people and would
[39:50] look up. He did it in Port El Bernie and
[39:53] he looked up and he said, "There's a
[39:56] paralyzed man and there's a man praying
[40:01] for him. He's paralyzed." I knew that
[40:03] man.
[40:06] And the man sitting right beside me had
[40:09] visited him that very day in Port El
[40:13] Bernie. But I had visited him in his
[40:18] daughter and son-in-law's home up in a
[40:21] house, which was an island up on the
[40:24] west coast that had about 500 native
[40:27] people living right there. And he was he
[40:31] was there in a a shanty beside connected
[40:35] to the house. It was a kind of a where
[40:37] they had the wood a wood blocks and wood
[40:40] wood stored there and he had been laying
[40:43] there. He was paralyzed from his waist
[40:46] down and brother Brandham has turned his
[40:50] back to the audience and he said he's
[40:55] paralyzed.
[40:57] there's a man praying for him and uh he
[41:00] said and the brother sitting right
[41:03] beside me had visited him that morning
[41:07] and I had I knew he was up in a house
[41:12] this island and the brother sitting
[41:15] right beside me knew that he was right
[41:17] there in Port El Bernie that day and
[41:21] there were other brothers in that
[41:23] meeting that knew that they had taken
[41:27] him that day, that afternoon to Nanaimo.
[41:32] And here, Brother Branam is turning and
[41:35] looking up at the gable end of this
[41:38] auditorium and he's saying, "I'll turn
[41:41] my back." Which he does. And he says,
[41:44] "There's a man praying for another man
[41:48] that's paralyzed." Well, I knew right
[41:50] away that that was brother Jacob's up in
[41:53] Port El Bernie, up in a house and other
[41:57] brothers knew that he was right there in
[42:01] Port El Bernie because they had visited
[42:02] him. But he had been moved that
[42:05] afternoon,
[42:07] that very afternoon. and this and
[42:09] brother Brandham the angel of the Lord
[42:12] says
[42:14] now he has he's not here in this place
[42:20] he's in Nimo
[42:22] he had been moved to the Indian hospital
[42:26] in Nimo that very afternoon and brother
[42:31] Brandham and I'm standing I'm on sitting
[42:34] on the platform actually and he turns
[42:36] right around he says isn't at right
[42:39] fright, brother Mike.
[42:42] And
[42:44] it was all over for me.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; It was all over right then. Now I want
[42:50] to say something to this congregation.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; What time zone were they in?
[42:59] &gt;&gt; There's only one. It's a it's called I
[43:02] don't know whether this is scientific or
[43:04] not but there's a singular zone
[43:08] and it's called eternity
[43:11] and this angel
[43:13] now brother Brandham has said and I'll
[43:15] be giving you the quotes in just a few
[43:17] moments he reads he says the same angel
[43:22] that spoke to Abraham is the same angel
[43:25] that's here in Port Bernie and is the
[43:29] same angel
[43:30] that's speaking to you and he would come
[43:33] and spend time and bring a message right
[43:36] across your pathway
[43:39] &gt;&gt; and cause you to see it. It becomes so
[43:42] clear. You say, "Why can't people see
[43:45] that?" And that's what I wondered. How
[43:48] people couldn't see that this
[43:51] supernatural thing that was taking place
[43:53] was so supernatural it could only be God
[43:56] himself.
[43:58] and he knows what's in the secrets of
[44:00] the hearts. And so I will be dealing
[44:04] dealing with that in just a moment. But
[44:07] it is
[44:09] I is it too hard to believe that the
[44:14] invisible God could come down and take
[44:18] upon himself a human form
[44:22] and fulfill his plan. I say no, it's
[44:26] not. And I don't want anyone to read
[44:29] anything into my words, but I want to
[44:33] make it very clear. Jesus said
[44:37] in John 8 and 24, I said therefore unto
[44:41] you
[44:43] that you you shall die in your sins. For
[44:48] if you believe not that I am he, you
[44:51] shall die in your sins. But you say,
[44:54] "Oh, well, that was Jesus Christ." Well,
[44:56] who was Jesus Christ? He was the word,
[44:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Made flesh,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:02] &gt;&gt; And they had to believe that that word
[45:04] had been made flesh to speak to them
[45:08] what he was speaking.
[45:13] And then to take the word it, it's too
[45:16] hard. It means it's to to be beyond
[45:21] one's ability.
[45:24] This is far beyond a human ability.
[45:27] Well, if it's far beyond a human
[45:29] ability, whose ability is it?
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; That's the question. And I shall return
[45:35] unto thee.
[45:38] And when he returns,
[45:40] back in Abraham's day, it was maybe 3 4
[45:43] thousand years ago.
[45:45] But then today, and what does your Bible
[45:49] say? Your Bible says Jesus Christ the
[45:53] same
[45:54] &gt;&gt; yesterday,
[45:56] today, and forever. What time zone is
[46:00] that?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; That's a singular time zone.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; There is no difference in time. He is
[46:07] the same. That's the God of this
[46:10] message. And that's what separates this
[46:13] message from every other doctrine and
[46:16] every other gathering of people. And you
[46:20] people that are listening now to my
[46:22] voice that is this message is not like
[46:26] any other message. This is a message
[46:29] that's been attended to by the angel of
[46:32] the Lord
[46:33] &gt;&gt; and he is still with it. He's abiding
[46:36] with it. He will never leave it. It's
[46:38] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[46:41] Same yesterday, today and forever. That
[46:44] is him. And we are so thankful to be
[46:48] connected to that message. And and it's
[46:53] it's also a concern to us that we don't
[46:56] just let it turn into some kind of
[47:00] church gathering
[47:02] &gt;&gt; or social club.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. This is a message
[47:07] that's been sent from God to prepare
[47:10] people for the rapture of the agemen and
[47:14] to get you ready for it. Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; If you that are standing here wish to
[47:22] sit down, that'll be perfectly fine.
[47:26] So he said, "Is it too hard?
[47:30] is to be beyond one's power
[47:33] to be difficult to understand.
[47:37] So difficult in friends I will say so
[47:40] difficult that in the unveiling of God
[47:45] the prophet of God says they couldn't
[47:48] understand it
[47:50] &gt;&gt; and they could not explain it
[47:53] and the angel is telling and I will be
[47:55] getting into that vision
[47:58] telling the prophet of God
[48:02] you I told you how to fish I told you
[48:06] how to do these things and how to deal
[48:10] with the supernatural and it's not
[48:13] possible to explain it. So you leave it
[48:16] unexplained and don't tell them. In fact
[48:19] is he said do not tell them what you're
[48:22] doing. I'll be reading that for you and
[48:25] I I want you to have the reference so
[48:27] you can look at it and and see it.
[48:32] It is also to be surpassing.
[48:37] My friends, I want to say to you
[48:40] believers, today we have a message.
[48:45] This isn't because we pump it up. This
[48:48] is a message that is surpassing.
[48:51] when the prophet of God turned his back
[48:54] to the congregation and or to
[48:57] individuals and told them exactly what
[49:01] they were there for that surpassing and
[49:04] it's not been done and the angel of the
[49:06] Lord told brother Brandham told him said
[49:11] no one else will have this ministry
[49:15] only you'll have it and as long as
[49:18] you're on the earth no one else will
[49:20] have it.
[49:22] It wasn't that he was saying that
[49:24] someone else will have it. But I will I
[49:27] will say to you
[49:29] and I say without any apology since he's
[49:32] gone, no one has raised up, no one has
[49:36] raised up and had that ministry. None.
[49:41] And so I say this is what
[49:44] this is the infallibility
[49:47] of the me message that we are connected
[49:50] to. It is truly an infallible ministry.
[49:54] So it's beyond it's to be surpassed.
[49:59] It's beyond death. It's beyond religion.
[50:02] It's beyond ceremony. It's beyond
[50:05] churchity. It's beyond just religious
[50:08] activity.
[50:10] It is a message which is beyond that. It
[50:14] to be extraordinary to be extraordinary
[50:17] hard and a difficult thing and it is a
[50:21] very difficult message. Sometimes it's
[50:24] difficult to understand God surpassing
[50:29] human abilities,
[50:31] human talents and human gifts
[50:35] to bring the promised son
[50:39] in the simplicity
[50:41] and this is in the message God in
[50:44] simplicity.
[50:45] He says that God hides in simplicity and
[50:50] then he turns around and reveals himself
[50:53] in the same. He reveals himself in such
[50:56] simplicity. It is not exotic for people
[51:00] to believe it. It's not something that
[51:03] is you know that the world has uh
[51:08] elevated into some sphere, some special
[51:11] place. It is not that
[51:15] God surpassing all human knowledge
[51:19] and wisdom to prove himself to believers
[51:24] and deliver us a pray a a surpassing
[51:28] message that is able to transform
[51:33] us into sons and daughters of God. The
[51:36] ministry of Jesus
[51:39] passed through various
[51:42] uh various or different stages in in
[51:45] life.
[51:47] In Luke 4 and 22 it says that they
[51:53] wondered at the gracious words that fell
[51:56] from his lips. In Luke 9 and9 the Bible
[52:00] speaks of Herod and he was so happy.
[52:05] He was thrilled. Herod said, "But who is
[52:09] this?" Herod Herod had said, "John I've
[52:13] killed." "But who is this
[52:18] of whom I hear such things?" And he
[52:21] desired to see him. Herod did. That was
[52:26] another phase. And then in Luke 21 and9,
[52:30] the multitude cried saying, "Hosana to
[52:34] the son of God, to the son of David.
[52:38] Blessed is he that uh hosana in the
[52:43] highest. Blessed is he that cometh in
[52:46] the name of the Lord." And then in
[52:50] Matthew 27, just a short time later,
[52:53] then answered all the people and said,
[52:57] "His blood be on us and on our
[53:01] children." And it was
[53:02] &gt;&gt; it was
[53:03] &gt;&gt; that was they signed their own doom.
[53:07] Mhm.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; The same people who said or the same
[53:11] people that heard and the public heard
[53:15] how great and gracious words were
[53:18] falling from his lips and they and I did
[53:21] not give all the places but they said
[53:24] they marveled and they wondered at a
[53:27] child and a young man that would have
[53:29] such wisdom. They said where did he get
[53:32] these things? They wondered at that and
[53:35] and and now comes a messenger in our
[53:38] time with a just a very poor education.
[53:42] But they say, "Where does he get these
[53:44] things?"
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And great preachers and theologians and
[53:49] men of the books and men of renown. And
[53:53] here is a uh here's a simple little
[53:57] prophet even speaking perhaps poor
[54:00] grammar but he reveals the secrets of
[54:03] the heart. Isn't that so Mike that
[54:07] you're speaking with this paralyzed
[54:09] person? You're saying you may be
[54:12] questioning and saying well what
[54:14] happened to that par paralyzed person? I
[54:16] don't know
[54:17] &gt;&gt; right
[54:18] &gt;&gt; you can't explain it. And even if I was
[54:20] able to tell you, well, God healed him,
[54:23] but since then maybe he passed away. But
[54:25] I can tell you one thing. He spoke to a
[54:28] woman, and I have a picture of her. We
[54:31] have a very nice picture of her. Effie
[54:33] Tate is her name. And she she was in the
[54:37] meeting in Port El Bernie and her son,
[54:40] she had a son who was having terrible
[54:43] epileptic fits. In fact, as he was
[54:46] having so many fits, they didn't feel
[54:49] that he would live to be a young man.
[54:52] And they thought that he he should die.
[54:54] He was about 16 or 17. He told me he was
[54:58] 19 years old. Then during the meeting in
[55:01] Port Al Bernie and I'm sitting on the
[55:04] platform and brother Brandham speaks to
[55:07] the woman, she doesn't even come up in
[55:09] the prayer line. speaks to her and
[55:12] speaks to her about her son and that
[55:15] epilepsy left him. My wife and I visited
[55:18] this man about three four years ago and
[55:22] he was also in the Rainbow Lodge in Port
[55:26] Bernie and he said I said to him do you
[55:30] remember that day when brother Brandham
[55:32] said that you'll be free from epilepsy?
[55:36] He said, "Oh, yes. Yeah." I said, "How
[55:40] uh ho how's it been since then?" He
[55:42] said, "I've never had another never had
[55:44] another fet since that time." Where does
[55:47] that come from?
[55:49] &gt;&gt; That's what I ask you. Where does that
[55:51] come from? That's the kind of God that
[55:53] we support and we believe. And this is
[55:56] the kind of message that we believe.
[55:58] This is the kind of messenger that we
[56:00] believe. And uh you'll understand
[56:04] why I feel that way. And then then they
[56:08] they crucified him. They said his blood
[56:11] be on us and on then the days and the
[56:14] disciples
[56:16] just like you just like me. We have the
[56:20] days of power and the days of miracles
[56:22] and the days of great things. But then
[56:24] there was the days of silence.
[56:28] Then the days of silence,
[56:31] the judgment hall,
[56:35] the accusations,
[56:37] the crucifixion,
[56:39] the death and the burial.
[56:43] How can you understand that?
[56:45] How can you understand that he must go
[56:48] through this? He must pay the penalty of
[56:52] our sin.
[56:55] He must do it. And then he will, the
[56:59] father will send his own spirit into the
[57:02] church.
[57:04] And whatever the prophet of God of this
[57:08] generation
[57:09] declared, he said, "It's God in you,
[57:13] the hope of glory." This was the miracle
[57:16] of the Bible. But this was accomplished.
[57:20] this it took the visitation of the angel
[57:23] of the Lord to even bring this about
[57:26] to bring this knowledge of the scripture
[57:29] to you. He says and in many places then
[57:33] I looked up and it would be good for you
[57:36] to do a personal study and look up. I'll
[57:38] turn my back. I said what is so much
[57:42] what is so great about that?
[57:47] Is it supernatural?
[57:50] Is it from God?
[57:54] What do we do about it?
[57:57] In 1950,
[58:00] now Brother Brandham was speaking
[58:05] and uh I'll I'll I'll give you this as a
[58:08] reading.
[58:22] So I I gave you this uh out of Jehovah
[58:25] Gyra and this is 1955.
[58:29] Some time ago I was speaking on that and
[58:31] a preacher wrote me a letter. He said,
[58:34] "Brother Brandon, get next to yourself."
[58:36] He said, "You mean to say that that was
[58:39] God?" I said it was God. Well, how did
[58:44] he get here? That was his question. How
[58:47] did he get here? Well, he did just get
[58:51] and then he dropped off. He told
[58:53] Abraham, "Is anything too hard for the
[58:56] Lord?" And I say, is it too hard or it
[59:01] is it too difficult to believe that the
[59:04] invisible God could take upon himself a
[59:07] human form and fulfill part of his plan?
[59:14] Here's what the meaning of the heart. Is
[59:16] it too difficult to understand to show
[59:20] oneself
[59:22] uh wonderful and marvelous? God is
[59:25] showing himself
[59:27] superb,
[59:29] marvelous.
[59:31] I was sitting on the platform. I'm I'm
[59:34] giving personal testimony today. some of
[59:37] it. Some of you will hear it for the
[59:40] first time, but I was sitting on the
[59:42] platform over on this side when brother
[59:46] Brandham turned his back and he told
[59:49] about brother Jacobs that he was in the
[59:53] Nimo in the Indian hospital
[59:56] and the brother Mike was down on this
[59:59] side praying for him
[1:00:04] and and brother Brandham feels that he
[1:00:07] should speak
[1:00:09] about germs and the diseases. And so he
[1:00:13] takes and he starts to he starts to read
[1:00:17] about that. And
[1:00:26] but watch what kind of a miracle this
[1:00:29] angel did that stayed with Abraham.
[1:00:34] He had his back turned and told Abraham
[1:00:38] his name
[1:00:41] had been changed. He called him Abraham
[1:00:45] instead of Abram.
[1:00:47] He could not have the baby till his name
[1:00:50] was changed. Neither Sarah. He told them
[1:00:54] that their name was what their name was.
[1:00:58] The angel told them that and he said
[1:01:02] that he was going to visit Sarah
[1:01:06] according to the time of life.
[1:01:10] And when Sarah laughed, the man,
[1:01:14] I have it underlined, with his back
[1:01:16] turned, the man eating flesh of the calf
[1:01:22] and drinking the milk from the cow and
[1:01:25] eating bread. a man dust on his clothes,
[1:01:30] a traveler was God himself. And Abraham
[1:01:35] recognized it
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; because he knew the thoughts that was in
[1:01:41] Sarah's heart behind him. Now he'd have
[1:01:47] he'd have took Sarah's life right there
[1:01:52] for her to disbelieve. But see, she is
[1:01:57] part of Abraham. Oh, I just rejoice in
[1:02:00] this and I want you to rejoice in this
[1:02:02] as well. And our unbelief, your
[1:02:06] unbelief.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; It's not that you disregard and say, "I
[1:02:10] don't believe that." But something
[1:02:13] that's too wonderful. It's too
[1:02:16] surpassing.
[1:02:17] It goes off into another dimension. And
[1:02:20] you can't you can't put it together. But
[1:02:23] but you believe
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; right
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; and that is what we're referring to. And
[1:02:29] our unbelief in his great manifestation
[1:02:32] in this hour and see the manifestation
[1:02:35] in this hour is so great. It goes beyond
[1:02:40] human language. It goes beyond any
[1:02:43] language.
[1:02:44] You just can't grasp it. You can't
[1:02:47] explain it. People ask me, "What was it
[1:02:50] like when the angel of the Lord came?" I
[1:02:53] don't know. I I can't tell it. I can't
[1:02:57] explain it. All I can tell you is it had
[1:03:01] a certain effect.
[1:03:04] It just had a certain effect. And I can
[1:03:07] tell you one thing that became a reality
[1:03:10] and that's in the last few hours
[1:03:14] is that one
[1:03:16] that was 2,000 years ago or 4,000 years
[1:03:20] ago with Abraham is the same one that
[1:03:26] was present on earth and is the same one
[1:03:31] that brought Peter out of prison and the
[1:03:35] same one that met Paul on the road to
[1:03:38] Damascus.
[1:03:40] And that's the same one.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says it's the
[1:03:45] same one that is here tonight.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; He says the same one that's here while I
[1:03:52] speak to you. It's the same one.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And then I say, I don't know if it's
[1:03:58] scientific or not, but that's means
[1:04:02] nothing to me. It's a singular zone.
[1:04:04] Now, some of you people are in different
[1:04:06] time zones. You'll hear this and it'll
[1:04:09] be tomorrow morning or it'll be 16 hours
[1:04:13] from now. I don't know. And some way may
[1:04:17] not hear it for some days. But I will
[1:04:20] tell you this, that's the same one that
[1:04:22] I speak to you tonight. And it's the
[1:04:25] same one that was there. And then I I
[1:04:28] realized just this morning before I came
[1:04:31] to the church to speak to you that it's
[1:04:33] the same one. This is a singular time
[1:04:37] zone because he's the same yesterday
[1:04:41] and today and forever. It's the same one
[1:04:46] that you're going to meet in eternity
[1:04:48] and we're going to rejoice together. The
[1:04:52] Bible says,
[1:04:54] and in fact, as the prophet of God said,
[1:04:57] when uh when the when the elders
[1:05:02] beheld him and he took the book, he took
[1:05:05] the book into his hand from him that had
[1:05:10] the was on the throne and he had the
[1:05:13] book and that was the sealed book. And
[1:05:17] though this one came and took that
[1:05:20] sealed book
[1:05:22] and the elders threw their crowns down.
[1:05:25] That was their response. They threw
[1:05:27] their crowns. They didn't feel they were
[1:05:29] worthy of crowns on their head. They
[1:05:32] threw it down on the ground because they
[1:05:35] had taken the book. And in that book was
[1:05:38] your name.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; In that book was my name.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; In that book was the name of the bride
[1:05:44] of Jesus Christ. In that book is every
[1:05:47] believer's name. Your name was in that
[1:05:50] book. And it's not that he detailed all
[1:05:54] our evils and sins and unbelief. But
[1:05:58] what was detailed in there is that when
[1:06:00] the book was open, we believed it was
[1:06:03] open.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; When uh one who took it in his hand, we
[1:06:08] believe that he was worthy to take it.
[1:06:11] and anything we have is not worthy to be
[1:06:14] recorded of it.
[1:06:18] And so,
[1:06:22] and that's why the prophet of God said
[1:06:25] in our unbelief in his great
[1:06:27] manifestation
[1:06:28] in this hour,
[1:06:31] we're a part of Christ.
[1:06:34] He has to keep it. He has to keep it. We
[1:06:38] don't have to keep it. He's the one that
[1:06:40] keeps it.
[1:06:42] He's the one. You say, "Well, that is
[1:06:46] h how can I believe something that is
[1:06:49] beyond
[1:06:51] my comprehension?" Well, you better get
[1:06:54] used to it because that's what that's
[1:06:57] what this gospel is all about. And
[1:06:59] that's why the prophet's message and
[1:07:02] I'll tell you, they turned away from him
[1:07:04] in droves. They turned away from Jesus
[1:07:07] in droves. They turned away from Paul in
[1:07:09] droves. They turned away from Luther in
[1:07:12] droves. They turned away from all the
[1:07:15] messengers in droves. But there were
[1:07:18] still a few that were believers.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; And there is no power that could turn
[1:07:25] them aside.
[1:07:27] Amen.
[1:07:29] Well, I want to continue on here a few
[1:07:31] moments.
[1:07:37] You'd believe it was that same Lord. Now
[1:07:40] he's speaking. This is in 65.
[1:07:43] Does God change his mind? In Los
[1:07:46] Angeles.
[1:07:47] You'd believe it was that same Lord
[1:07:50] Jesus.
[1:07:52] Notice now same God, not another.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; You believe that is that same Lord
[1:07:59] Jesus. That one that was here. that one
[1:08:02] that was they said hosana to the
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; to the son of David
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; even though he wasn't there to fulfill
[1:08:11] that they couldn't understand it you
[1:08:14] believe it was that same Lord Jesus same
[1:08:17] God that could tell Philillip where he
[1:08:20] was tell Simon what his name was do you
[1:08:24] believe him to be the same one
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; your trouble is a bowel trouble
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; the sister says Exact. That's exact.
[1:08:34] Isn't that right? Yes, sir. She says,
[1:08:37] "You believe me now to be his prophet?
[1:08:41] Your name is Mrs. Bayer." Mrs. Bayer.
[1:08:46] Bayer.
[1:08:48] Like Bayer in aspirin. I've never heard
[1:08:52] him say that. Like he says it there.
[1:08:55] That's right. You're healed. Go on.
[1:08:58] Jesus Christ made you well. Now I say,
[1:09:02] is that the Jesus that walked here?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. It's the same. It's the same
[1:09:07] God.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And then he says, you believe it was
[1:09:10] that same Lord Jesus, that same God that
[1:09:13] could tell Philillip where he was, tell
[1:09:16] Simon what his name was. Do you believe
[1:09:19] him to be the same one?
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Now, you're really not here for
[1:09:26] yourself.
[1:09:28] He's speaking to the same one. You're
[1:09:30] here for somebody else. It's a man and
[1:09:34] he's not here a brother. That brother is
[1:09:38] in a mental institution.
[1:09:41] Take that handkerchief you got in your
[1:09:44] hand. While that spirit is on you, send
[1:09:48] it to him. Put it on him. Don't doubt.
[1:09:52] He'll come out of the institution and
[1:09:55] you'll and and will be well.
[1:09:59] Do you believe it? God bless you. You
[1:10:04] say that you said that angel is the last
[1:10:08] day. In the last day is here. He had his
[1:10:12] back turned. Well, you look I won't look
[1:10:16] at this woman. I turned my back. What is
[1:10:20] he doing? He's replicating exactly what
[1:10:23] he just said to the to the people.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; I'll turn my back.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Now, lady, the one with the patient, can
[1:10:34] you hear me? Say yes. Sister says, "Yes,
[1:10:38] if the Lord Jesus will reveal to me
[1:10:42] what's your trouble when I'm looking
[1:10:44] this way, you'll know whether it's the
[1:10:47] truth or not." Do you believe then it's
[1:10:50] to fulfill what Jesus said? Notice this
[1:10:54] please
[1:10:55] to believe. Do you believe then it's to
[1:10:59] fulfill what Jesus said? I would it
[1:11:04] would be done in the last days as it was
[1:11:07] in the days of Sodom. Now that's when he
[1:11:11] turned his back.
[1:11:15] He didn't just turn his back, but he
[1:11:18] said, "Where's Sarah, your wife? She's
[1:11:20] in the tent behind you." But also just a
[1:11:24] little further on was Sodom.
[1:11:27] And the men lifted up their eyes and
[1:11:30] they moved toward Sodom. And the Bible
[1:11:34] says Abraham
[1:11:36] went on to carry them on their way, to
[1:11:39] take them on their way, to see them off.
[1:11:42] And they went to Sodom. And then you
[1:11:45] know what happened in Sodom. And this
[1:11:48] was the sign that was
[1:11:51] demonstrated of who he was and to bring
[1:11:55] fire down from heaven and to for those
[1:11:58] people to be in such a wicked state and
[1:12:02] glorifying their condition.
[1:12:06] It be exactly as it is today. He said
[1:12:08] would be done in the last days. And it
[1:12:11] was being done right then.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; What God was it?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; It was a singular time zone.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Whether it was 4,000 years ago, 5,000
[1:12:22] years ago, we don't care. Whether it was
[1:12:25] 2,000 years ago, we don't care. Whether
[1:12:27] it was 50 years ago, we don't care. It's
[1:12:30] the same one who was in attendance with
[1:12:33] this message. And we believe it. We
[1:12:36] believe it with all of our heart. We
[1:12:39] stand here as a uh an emblem if you
[1:12:44] would or we stand here as believers,
[1:12:48] living believers filled with his spirit.
[1:12:54] Will you believe it? He said to the
[1:12:55] lady,
[1:12:57] "You have a lady's disorder, a female
[1:13:00] trouble. Believe with all your heart now
[1:13:04] you'll leave. You can go home and be
[1:13:06] well. God bless you if thou can't
[1:13:09] believe.
[1:13:12] Now brother Bren does something strange
[1:13:14] and I want to just jump into it.
[1:13:18] Back in 1950 he says what is a germ? Now
[1:13:23] we take a cancer. What is it first? Why?
[1:13:28] It's a growth tumor cataract goer.
[1:13:32] They're growths. I want to just stop
[1:13:34] here. I just had a uh
[1:13:38] I just had a cataract removed. And the
[1:13:41] prophet says, "Well, it's it's a
[1:13:44] growth." Yes. But there's another part
[1:13:47] of this Bible that I have here in my
[1:13:50] hand that speaks about my age.
[1:13:54] It says that a person's vision may
[1:13:57] become dull or dim. And mine has become
[1:14:01] dim.
[1:14:03] And but that's not too dim. And uh we
[1:14:07] have things that happen naturally by our
[1:14:10] age. God doesn't promise us, you know,
[1:14:13] fix I'll fix everything. I'll make
[1:14:16] that's coming. I'll be a young man.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; That's just across the That's just
[1:14:23] across the bridge.
[1:14:25] I I'll be a young man.
[1:14:28] and uh you you'd like me to stay at this
[1:14:31] post of duty forever? Well, that's fine.
[1:14:35] You try it when you get my age.
[1:14:39] But he asked, "What what about this germ
[1:14:42] and and the tumor and cataract and goer?
[1:14:46] They're growths. Is that right? And they
[1:14:49] become malignant and cancers."
[1:14:52] Well, a growth is a multiplication of
[1:14:55] cells. And let's dig down below that.
[1:14:58] Now, below that growth is a group of
[1:15:02] cells. Then it goes down to the germ.
[1:15:07] Well, what is a germ? A germ is a teeny
[1:15:11] little cell. Teeny little thing that can
[1:15:15] only be seen not with the natural eye,
[1:15:18] but through microscopes.
[1:15:21] But below that, then it's got life. It
[1:15:24] moves. It's got the life in it.
[1:15:29] What's below that in that germ?
[1:15:34] Well, it becomes a spirit.
[1:15:38] And there's only two resources that
[1:15:40] spirits can come from.
[1:15:43] That's either from God or the devil.
[1:15:47] Now, that germ,
[1:15:50] let me just take this little a little
[1:15:53] further. Do you realize that you came
[1:15:56] from one little germ?
[1:15:59] There was a time when you wasn't
[1:16:01] nothing.
[1:16:03] Well, the germ of life comes from the
[1:16:05] male sex. So, he said there was a time
[1:16:08] when it wasn't nothing,
[1:16:11] but it comes from the male. And I like
[1:16:12] what he says about this.
[1:16:16] For instance, an old mother bird, he
[1:16:19] gives this example. An old mother bird
[1:16:20] could make her nest and lay it full of
[1:16:24] eggs. She could get on them and warm
[1:16:27] those eggs and hover them and stay till
[1:16:31] she couldn't get off the nest.
[1:16:34] And not one of those eggs would hatch.
[1:16:37] They would lay right there and rot in
[1:16:40] the nest because they haven't been with
[1:16:43] the male, the mate. She hasn't been with
[1:16:48] the male bird. and therefore they're not
[1:16:50] fertile. That reminds me of a whole lot
[1:16:54] of these old cold formal churches. They
[1:16:58] haven't been with the male Jesus Christ.
[1:17:05] Now
[1:17:07] I ask you,
[1:17:09] what kind of wisdom is that to reach
[1:17:11] into the God of nature
[1:17:14] and that mother bird and she'll build a
[1:17:17] nest and she'll fill it full of eggs,
[1:17:22] but not one unless she's been with the
[1:17:25] male the male the male male friend.
[1:17:30] And he's liking then he swings it right
[1:17:32] down to the church. That reminds me of a
[1:17:35] whole lot of these cold formal churches.
[1:17:38] They haven't been with the male Jesus
[1:17:42] Christ Jesus.
[1:17:45] Not a book.
[1:17:47] They haven't been That's not a book.
[1:17:51] They haven't been with him.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; There's something about him
[1:17:57] that makes a person fertile.
[1:18:01] There's something about him that makes a
[1:18:04] person different.
[1:18:06] You can bring forth something. You bring
[1:18:09] forth a life. They're not believers in
[1:18:13] the first place.
[1:18:15] He says
[1:18:21] he's still on. We believe that Jesus
[1:18:23] Christ, now he's still on the same
[1:18:25] subject. He said, "We believe that Jesus
[1:18:29] Christ was of a virgin birth."
[1:18:34] You hear a lot in the full gospel
[1:18:36] churches argue concerning that. Brother
[1:18:40] Bren never argued about it. He did have
[1:18:42] to. But Jehovah God overshadowed her
[1:18:47] Mary
[1:18:48] and created in her womb a blood cell
[1:18:52] which was by himself a con created
[1:18:56] power. And from that blood cell came the
[1:19:00] man Christ Jesus
[1:19:02] and he was the blood of his father
[1:19:07] by a virgin birth.
[1:19:10] And friends, if you don't believe that,
[1:19:13] then you can't be saved.
[1:19:18] No other way but through the blood of
[1:19:21] Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, which is the
[1:19:25] blood of his father, God, unadulterated,
[1:19:28] no sex mixed into it at all. It was a
[1:19:33] created birth. And I say, amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It was a created birth.
[1:19:43] And in Revelation it says, "And unto the
[1:19:47] angel of the church of the leadyans,
[1:19:50] write these things, saith
[1:19:54] the amen, the faithful and true witness,
[1:19:59] the beginning of the creation of God."
[1:20:05] And that's the blood cell. That's why we
[1:20:08] are born again
[1:20:10] and born of that blood cell and have a
[1:20:14] new birth.
[1:20:21] Brother Brandon tells of a vision and
[1:20:24] I'm still on the same subject.
[1:20:26] He tells of a vision
[1:20:29] and uh I just have
[1:20:32] condensed part of it here first is
[1:20:36] unable to lace a little baby shoe with a
[1:20:39] large lace in the vision
[1:20:43] and then one that is speaking to him
[1:20:46] says you can't teach Pentecostal babies
[1:20:49] natural supernatural things
[1:20:53] you'll cause you'll cause carnal
[1:20:56] Impersonations.
[1:21:00] Impersonations.
[1:21:04] Impersonations.
[1:21:08] You will cause impersonations.
[1:21:10] And the reason why I am dwelling on that
[1:21:13] is because I lived through that era. I
[1:21:17] lived through that time and saw saw so
[1:21:20] many that had
[1:21:24] uh impersonations
[1:21:26] call out people out of the audience and
[1:21:29] so on. He says
[1:21:32] and then he said the one uh speaking to
[1:21:35] me instructed me how to cast and fish.
[1:21:43] I'll make you fishers of men.
[1:21:46] say now can you put it together and just
[1:21:48] then he says seemed like I went off into
[1:21:52] another dimension and I was standing by
[1:21:55] a lake and he had taken me and set me
[1:21:59] down there by this lake there was lots
[1:22:03] of ministers around the fishing but said
[1:22:08] don't tell and the angel of the Lord
[1:22:10] said to him don't tell anybody
[1:22:13] don't tell nobody
[1:22:15] how you're doing it said keep still.
[1:22:19] Don't tell nobody what you're doing. In
[1:22:22] other words, but he had spent about the
[1:22:25] first
[1:22:27] 8 to 10 years. And he tried to describe
[1:22:31] and he even explained why. And then he
[1:22:34] would tell him, "You can't understand
[1:22:36] it." And and and he would say, "You've
[1:22:39] heard him say this, don't ask me. I just
[1:22:42] can't explain it.
[1:22:45] He couldn't explain it.
[1:22:48] So I said,
[1:22:50] "I understand."
[1:22:53] And I threw it away out. And just as I
[1:22:57] did, all these ministers and people run
[1:23:01] around and said, "Praise the Lord,
[1:23:03] Brother Brandham will really catch
[1:23:05] fish." That's what they were wanting.
[1:23:08] They were wanting him to catch fish and
[1:23:11] bring people into their congregation. I
[1:23:14] live through that.
[1:23:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:22] Brother Brandham will really catch fish.
[1:23:25] There was there was going on like that.
[1:23:28] Now friends, I'm going to say some
[1:23:31] things and some of you may rejoice
[1:23:35] and some of you may well
[1:23:39] say, "Well, we don't want you to
[1:23:41] humanize our prophet.
[1:23:44] We don't want you I've cut some things
[1:23:47] out." But he says here, he says, "I'm a
[1:23:50] sinner.
[1:23:52] I make mistakes every day." What? You
[1:23:55] have a prophet? He makes mistakes every
[1:23:57] day. Well, he showed the man's side of
[1:24:02] things as well. And so I want to I want
[1:24:05] to
[1:24:07] just stay with what he said.
[1:24:12] I said, "Now, I'll tell you how it's
[1:24:14] done. Here's the way you do it."
[1:24:17] This same angel of God that's always
[1:24:20] spoke to me said,
[1:24:25] "You've done just what I told you not to
[1:24:29] do. I told you to keep it to yourself
[1:24:34] and said, look what you've done. Took
[1:24:37] look at the carnal impersonations
[1:24:40] you got rose." See, and I hear people
[1:24:44] say, "Brother Brandham, oh, the Lord's
[1:24:47] given me a ministry.
[1:24:50] You got probably greater." Yeah, but
[1:24:53] just like that.
[1:24:58] No, never will be as long as I'm on the
[1:25:01] earth. He told me that in the beginning,
[1:25:06] never will be. this told him right in
[1:25:09] the beginning of his ministry, "Never
[1:25:11] will be as long as I live." Now, he told
[1:25:15] me that and I hear people say that and I
[1:25:21] know it's wrong,
[1:25:23] but I just want
[1:25:27] I just don't want
[1:25:31] and how to tell them.
[1:25:37] He said, "You cause impersonations." And
[1:25:40] then I started weeping.
[1:25:43] And I I took the string and was trying
[1:25:46] to straighten it out.
[1:25:48] And just then he looked at me and I
[1:25:52] wondered what he was going to do. And he
[1:25:55] said, "Keep your line straight.
[1:25:59] Keep your line straight
[1:26:02] in these kind of times."
[1:26:05] And I want to say to this congregation
[1:26:08] and the people that are listening,
[1:26:10] keep your line straight.
[1:26:15] Keep your faith straight.
[1:26:17] You don't have to do things which you
[1:26:20] know will get all tangled up. The
[1:26:23] scripture speaks of those things.
[1:26:26] Things that are unscriptural
[1:26:29] and things that'll tangle up our lives.
[1:26:32] get all swept up with just what this
[1:26:37] world is doing and what their decisions
[1:26:39] are. And this is Satan's Eden. This is
[1:26:43] Satan's kingdom. And we're not here
[1:26:46] advancing Satan's kingdom.
[1:26:49] We're here. We have to live with it. We
[1:26:51] have to deal with it and so on. But
[1:26:53] we're not here to be subjected
[1:26:57] to his mode of
[1:27:01] his his mode of uh acting.
[1:27:08] Keep your line straight
[1:27:10] in these kind of times. I said yes. So I
[1:27:15] got the line ready to throw again. And
[1:27:18] just as I did at that time, he taken me
[1:27:20] away again and he stood me up. Is it all
[1:27:24] right if I carry on a few minutes? And
[1:27:27] he stood me up in the air over a great
[1:27:30] auditorium
[1:27:32] up or a big tent
[1:27:36] or I never seen such a tent spread out.
[1:27:40] The most significant thing, these are my
[1:27:43] words, the most significant thing that
[1:27:46] has ever taken place was when the lamb
[1:27:49] himself took the book and opened the
[1:27:52] seven seals. That was the most
[1:27:55] significant thing. He took the book out
[1:27:58] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:28:01] the throne. Who was it? the owner, the
[1:28:05] original owner
[1:28:07] that had the book of redemption in his
[1:28:10] right hand.
[1:28:12] And no angel,
[1:28:15] no angelic being,
[1:28:18] nothing else could take that place.
[1:28:22] And this bloody lamb walked out and took
[1:28:26] the book. Now, think about the cell, the
[1:28:29] blood cell that made him. And he took
[1:28:32] the book
[1:28:34] out of the hand out of his hand. What
[1:28:37] was it, brother? He said, "This is the
[1:28:40] most I want you to catch this, please.
[1:28:43] This is the most sublime thing in the
[1:28:47] scripture.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; A act that not an angel, not nothing
[1:28:53] could do it, but the lamb
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; come and took it from the right hand of
[1:28:59] him that sat upon the throne. What was
[1:29:03] it? Now it behooves it belongs to the
[1:29:07] lamb. Amen. And he he he dwells on that
[1:29:11] just a a moment or two.
[1:29:15] God's laws required it. He's the one
[1:29:18] that holds it. God's law required a
[1:29:21] kinsman redeemer.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; And the lamb come out boldly. I am I am
[1:29:29] their kinsman.
[1:29:32] I am their redeemer. I now have made
[1:29:36] intercession for them. I now and now
[1:29:39] I've come to claim their rights
[1:29:45] for them. Amen. Amen. I've come to claim
[1:29:50] their rights
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; in that they have a right to everything
[1:29:56] that lost in the fall. I thought of
[1:29:59] Michael's service. I was sitting
[1:30:01] listening to it and he talked about a
[1:30:04] tennis ball and dropping it. talked
[1:30:07] about a much heavier item uh like a
[1:30:12] um
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; bowling.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; What kind of a bowl?
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Bowling.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; A bowling ball. Yes. And dropped it. And
[1:30:18] it'll do a lot more damage. And I
[1:30:21] thought about Adam was the last thing
[1:30:25] that was created in creation.
[1:30:28] And when he fell, he made a big hole.
[1:30:33] when he fell and and the Bible says one
[1:30:37] man sin came by one man
[1:30:41] and and Adam wasn't deceived
[1:30:44] but he took Eve's deception and uh to
[1:30:49] make it to make it proper he says I've
[1:30:54] come I've come to claim their rights in
[1:30:58] that they have a right to everything
[1:31:02] everything that lost in the fall. And
[1:31:06] I've said and I've paid the price. Oh,
[1:31:10] brother,
[1:31:12] don't it make you feel religious?
[1:31:15] Not by good works, which we have done,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; but by his mercy.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute. And them elders and
[1:31:26] everything else begin to throw off their
[1:31:28] crowns. dignitaries
[1:31:31] begin to get on the ground. See,
[1:31:38] no one no one could do it. And he walked
[1:31:43] right up to the right hand of God and
[1:31:46] took the book out of his hand and
[1:31:49] claimed his rights. I have died for
[1:31:52] them. I am their kinsman redeemer. I am
[1:31:56] the mediator. My blood was shed. I have
[1:32:00] become a man. I have become man. And I
[1:32:04] did this in order to get that church
[1:32:07] back again. The one I forsaw before the
[1:32:12] foundation of the world. I have purposed
[1:32:15] it. I spoke that it would be there and
[1:32:19] nobody was able to take it. But I went
[1:32:23] down and done it myself. I am their
[1:32:27] kinsmen.
[1:32:29] I became kinfolks.
[1:32:32] And he takes the book. Oh, who's waiting
[1:32:35] there for me tonight? Oh, who is that
[1:32:38] one
[1:32:40] church that's waiting there? What else
[1:32:44] could wait there for you
[1:32:48] but the kinsman redeemer?
[1:32:51] Oh my, what a sublime act. And that's
[1:32:56] why I take this especially. This is the
[1:32:59] sublime act.
[1:33:02] The sublime act wasn't who he would heal
[1:33:05] in the church.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; The sublime act wasn't some large
[1:33:10] auditorium with 30 or 4 thousand 40,000
[1:33:13] people. The sublime act is that he would
[1:33:17] claim that book.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Your name was in that book. Your name
[1:33:21] was in that book.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; My name was in that book. It was muddy.
[1:33:27] It was no good works could clean it up.
[1:33:30] Nothing could clean it up. But our name
[1:33:33] was in that book. And he took it with
[1:33:36] all of our faults and all of our
[1:33:38] weakness and all of our misunderstanding
[1:33:42] and all of our attempt to want to try to
[1:33:47] understand it and know it, but we can't.
[1:33:50] that goes beyond us and and we we have
[1:33:53] to say with the songwriter, why does he
[1:33:56] love me? Why why does he do that? And
[1:33:59] often I've had when people have come and
[1:34:02] given their lives to Christ and the
[1:34:04] burden of said leaves them and the guilt
[1:34:06] of sin leaves them, then one of the
[1:34:08] first questions I say, why did he do it?
[1:34:11] Why me?
[1:34:13] That don't don't worry about why me. He
[1:34:16] he he has his own reason for doing it.
[1:34:20] And I was so happy and thankful today
[1:34:23] for the body of Christ. I thought my
[1:34:27] what a glorious body there in
[1:34:29] Switzerland or down in Italy or over in
[1:34:31] Croatia or in China where they're
[1:34:34] suffering persecution.
[1:34:37] And we are there with you as though we
[1:34:41] are bound with you as though we're in
[1:34:44] defenders. Yet Paul said, "Remember my
[1:34:47] bonds." And we do remember it. And I
[1:34:50] would say to you as believers,
[1:34:56] uh, as believers
[1:34:59] of of this message,
[1:35:02] we believe the same word you believe. We
[1:35:05] do not propagate it to get you in
[1:35:08] difficulty. But if the
[1:35:11] laws of the land cause difficulty, well,
[1:35:16] we will do what we need to do and we
[1:35:19] will seek to get you the words of life.
[1:35:22] That's why this church and the Chinese
[1:35:27] community within this church have
[1:35:31] sponsored it really desired and our
[1:35:34] brother Murphy has given his life and
[1:35:38] translated
[1:35:39] the entire Bible to make sure that it is
[1:35:43] the closest
[1:35:45] Bible there is to the King James version
[1:35:48] which brother Brandham used and he
[1:35:51] supported it is that Bible and he held
[1:35:54] that Bible said that Bible is correct.
[1:35:59] And we can see how the enemy hates that
[1:36:02] word of God and he wants to make it
[1:36:06] illegal. No matter what man says, it'll
[1:36:09] never be illegal. It's God has called
[1:36:11] it. God's prophet has called it. a
[1:36:16] Bible that he supports and stands behind
[1:36:19] and a Bible that works.
[1:36:22] I can say if we ask anything in his
[1:36:25] name, he shall do it. And let us pray.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're so thankful for
[1:36:36] this time. We're so thankful. We want to
[1:36:39] say glory to the almighty God which has
[1:36:45] brought forth the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:48] I want to thank you for the body of
[1:36:51] Christ.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for each member of
[1:36:55] the body. I thank you for the people
[1:36:57] that have made all of this possible and
[1:37:00] the musicians that come out and the and
[1:37:03] the sound people that come out, Lord,
[1:37:06] and those that work with the video and
[1:37:09] do whatever that they can, every person
[1:37:12] in their place. And then we think of the
[1:37:15] body of Christ, the needy ones, Lord, uh
[1:37:19] our our dear sister that we had a prayer
[1:37:22] request for earlier. We pray for the
[1:37:26] brethren that are in the institutions
[1:37:30] in uh in China and the different
[1:37:33] countries and for those oh God that have
[1:37:37] stood behind the work in Switzerland. It
[1:37:42] is not in vain. For you have
[1:37:44] accomplished your purpose, oh God. And I
[1:37:48] pray, Father, that the comfort of the
[1:37:50] Holy Spirit will be their portion, oh
[1:37:55] mighty God. May the reality of the
[1:37:58] rapture be upon them. And may they
[1:38:01] realize you are the eternal one. There
[1:38:04] is no time zone. There's one singular
[1:38:08] time zone they are in. What? in the same
[1:38:12] time zone that we are in. And we are in
[1:38:15] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:38:19] and forever. That is the theme of this
[1:38:23] message. Oh God, you are the same. We
[1:38:26] thank you for this day. We thank you for
[1:38:28] this time. And we want to declare this
[1:38:32] is what we believe.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray
[1:38:37] you'll inspire the people for your
[1:38:39] glory. Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And I trust that this will be a a
[1:38:45] blessing to you.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to take these many
[1:38:50] different quotes that you saw come up on
[1:38:54] the screen and use them
[1:38:58] freely. And let me just say this as a
[1:39:03] witness. I'd like to
[1:39:07] uh I would like to encourage you
[1:39:10] with everything that's in me. The longer
[1:39:13] you live,
[1:39:16] and I trust it won't be that much
[1:39:17] longer,
[1:39:19] but the longer you live, the more
[1:39:21] precious that becomes.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; The longer you live,
[1:39:26] it just seems that it's the less you
[1:39:28] know and the less you can explain. But
[1:39:32] he is more wonderful. And then you just
[1:39:35] give it all up and just say, "Lord, I
[1:39:38] just surrender it all to you." Whatever
[1:39:41] whatever your will is and however you
[1:39:43] want to direct our footsteps, we give it
[1:39:46] over to you. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:39:51] Have a wonderful week. Amen.
[1:40:03] Just hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:40:09] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:40:15] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:40:21] Oh, time is filled with swift
[1:40:24] transition.
[1:40:27] Not of earth on whom can stand.
[1:40:33] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:40:39] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:40:44] Just hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:40:51] Oh to God's unchanging hand.
[1:40:57] Build your something's eternal.
[1:41:03] Hold to God's un. Let's trust in him.
[1:41:08] Just trust in him who will not leave
[1:41:11] you.
[1:41:14] Whatsoever
[1:41:16] years may bring.
[1:41:21] My earthly friends forsake
[1:41:26] still more closely.
[1:41:31] Just hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:41:37] Just hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:41:43] Build your hopes on things.
[1:41:49] Oh to God's unchanging hand when your
[1:41:53] journey and when your journey is
[1:41:57] completed
[1:42:00] and if to God you have been true
[1:42:07] and bright
[1:42:12] your intur
[1:42:17] Hold
[1:42:19] to God's unchanging hand.
[1:42:23] Just hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:42:30] Your hopes on things.
[1:42:36] Oh, to God's unchanging
[1:42:39] hand.
[1:42:42] Well, God bless you, saints. It's been a
[1:42:44] wonderful, wonderful Easter. God's
[1:42:47] blessed us with a message that we can
[1:42:50] take home, feed on, and revelate in. It
[1:42:54] is indeed the most sublime happening
[1:42:57] that's ever taken place. God bless you.
[1:43:01] God bless our pastor.
[1:43:03] God be with you till we meet again.
[1:43:07] God bless. Amen.
