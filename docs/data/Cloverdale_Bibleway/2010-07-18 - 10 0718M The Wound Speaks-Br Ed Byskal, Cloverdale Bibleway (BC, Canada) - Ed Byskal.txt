We're going to ask Brother Tom to come and pray just after we sing this chorus. Sister Lorie Snow has several requests that she'd like to make mention before the congregation. Ask you to pray earnestly that her mom was admitted to the hospital with heart problems. Her brother Ed is undergoing surgery this week for a valve in his heart. wants to ask for unspoken request for her sister and her family. We have two testimonies. One from brother Steve Rivas thanking the saints for their prayers and thanking the Lord for providing a job for his he and his family. He starts on Monday. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Many people take a job for granted. until you have to pray for a job. &gt;&gt; Then you don't take it for granted. You write in a testimony when God answers your prayer and provides something for you. Amen. Sister Lori wants to thank you all for praying and thank the Lord for keeping his hand on her daughter Christine and herself. It's the preaching of the word, the ministry that enables us to ride through every storm. Amen. My brother Tom come in just a moment. Let's sing this chorus together. Feel it's an anthem for myself even coming from camp when brother Cadre was here winter camp. Lord I lift your name. Lord I [Music] glory. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. I [Music] love you. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Hey, Heat. Glor [Applause] [Music] and my virtue. Before we sing it one more time and go to prayer, there's a request. Also, um, Brother Louise has given us a prayer request for a pastor, Alfredo. How do you say last name? built us and Buenosares has asked us to pray for them. They gave him a printer, a hub printer in Argentina. Brother Alfredo told me they broke into his church, took everything, music instruments, sound equipment, everything. They were preparing a portion of the church for the hub, and by the grace of God, the printer was still in his house. He's determined to print the message as soon as they can. Pray for the situation. We can do that, can't we? &gt;&gt; And I believe there's other situations here in the house of God. We are a needy people. &gt;&gt; Needy of the presence of God. &gt;&gt; We never want to get to the place of Revelation 3. &gt;&gt; Where they felt there is no need. &gt;&gt; I have a need this morning. &gt;&gt; I put on a tape early this morning, started to listen to that prophet and started to see how far I've fallen short. But I just want the grace of God. I want his grace this morning. We want the presence of God to come in the word to meet our needs. Let's just sing the chorus. We'll go to prayer. Lord, I live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] and your holy [Music] name. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, the great I am. Every [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] I'm sure, Father, if we would ask this morning from the depths of our heart. Do I have a need? I'm sure without reservation, there would be 100% of us just lifting up our hands saying, "Oo, great provider, &gt;&gt; meet my need this morning." and we believe you are the risen lamb. You are the mighty God and you're more than able to meet all needs. Brother Louise has pinned down this request that we would pray for the saints in Argentina. We know the enemy is a robber. He's a thief and he's a destroyer. But Lord, I love the following statement that you said. But I am come to give you life and life more abundantly. And so Lord God, we believe that you will meet their needs according to your word, that you will give them life, Lord, that you will take the situation and that Father, you will turn it around for the glory of God. And so Lord Jesus, with our hands lifted up and our hearts open, we're asking Lord that this resurrected King would come by and suck with us in a supernatural way by the word of God. That we could say, "Come to my soul, &gt;&gt; precious Jesus. Meet my heart's cry &gt;&gt; and meet my need." And so, Lord, as we have oneness of heart and mind this morning, knowing that there's many away, Lord, on their vacation, and some have already returned home, but we're thankful that we have the presence of God that goes before us, that never failing presence of Jesus Christ. So, Lord, would you anoint the man of God this morning? Would you anoint the gift? &gt;&gt; Would you anoint our ears? Would you anoint our eyes? And may we see your glory go by as your prophet said, Lord, that you hid Moses that day. And when he saw the backside of God, he saw a bleeding black. Lord, may we see the bleeding word bleed for us this morning. Meet our needs. And Lord, we have children that need an experience with God. May we reach out into faith and say, "God, save our children. Fill us with the Holy Ghost. Let the word of God permeate our hearts and lives this morning. Meet those that have joined with us on the internet. Speak to their hearts and meet their needs. And Father, we'll be sure to give you all the glory and honor and praise. And father, would you anoint now the remainder of the service, the songs and the worship and be glorified now as we commit all the prayer requests and all the needs to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you turn next person next to you shake their hands say God bless you this morning. It's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. that you may have your seats. For those that are in the visible audience, those that are on the telephone hookup and the internet, we want to say God bless you this morning, those that are visiting here among us, want to say God bless you to you as well. Amen. We just had a wonderful time this uh just last evening. We had several of the young people out at the camp. We had an unexpected weekend off out there. group moved out to September that was supposed to be there this weekend. So, we took the opportunity and invited some of the young people out and just had a really wonderful time. We appreciated those of you that were able to make it. We'll try and do that again here real soon. Sometimes it's short notice, but well, that's just the way it goes. Praise the Lord. Ryan's going to sing a song for us this morning. We appreciate Brother Ryan standing in the gap for us and appreciate the gift, Brother Ryan. God bless you this morning. [Music] The blood of Jesus atones for free me. Covers my sins and sets me free [Music] and speaks of grace that flowed from yonder tree. My joy, my hope, my peace, my libert. Oh sacred, holy flow from Calary's mouth.

I'm certainly glad to see each of you. I want to also give special greetings to the they're streaming in Seattle this morning. Brother John Andy's has been down and they had service Friday night and I think another one last night. I'm not too sure. And I just got a text from him and he was saying they're going to uh join together in stream and some are here. God bless you. All right. I'm I have something that's very much on my heart. I'm going to ask for your complete cooperation. I prayed that uh whoever was supposed to be here and whoever is supposed to be streaming will be. Uh I have had this on my heart for some time. uh and uh and and I I just need your cooperation so that God will be able to take a hold of me and allow me to say what I need to say and how I how I want to say it. It's a strange subject a wee bit and uh you'll notice how strange it is from the title when we begin. I have a few slides also and I don't want to feel uh pressed for time. So, if you'll just be a real reverend, and I think that's important. I believe God honors that. Uh you have already prayed, but I'd like to just pray and ask God's uh special guidance this morning if he would grant us that. Father, how I appreciate the people that are here today. How I appreciate Lord there are your children those that are streaming from near and far. I pray oh God that you will bless them with the same presence. &gt;&gt; And may the word Lord as I have been praying earnestly not be in merely preaching and word only but in power and in demonstration of the Holy Spirit. Father, it's the same gospel. You have restored us back to the faith of the fathers. Let something be said, Lord. Let the word uh be projected in such a way so that faith will rise in the in the hearts of the hearer. And may they may they take hold of it now, Lord, &gt;&gt; not at some time in the future, but may they lay hold of it at this moment for the very thing that they are looking to you for and asking you for. Lord, we don't want to be continually asking, but then we want to lay hold of it and receive it. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'll bless this congregation and bless all who are gathering, oh God, believers of this message near and far. I pray your blessing upon them. Those that are streaming in Seattle, oh God, at this time in in Switzerland, Norway, Europe, Father, New Zealand, wherever they might be, I pray your blessing upon the dear ones. &gt;&gt; And anoint us now, oh God, to speak and the hearers to hear in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh if you'll turn in your Bibles to Isaiah the 53rd chapter, it was also from this reading that we spoke I think two weeks ago and I had a considerable uh response from different ones and when uh we took the value of the flaw. You remember that? &gt;&gt; All right. This service today will tie directly into that. I'm going to begin to read in the 52nd chapter verse 13 and then on down into 53 1-5. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently. He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high. As many were astoned at thee, his visage was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men. So shall he sprinkled many nations, and kings shall shut their mouths at him. For that which he had been had not been told uh told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider. Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, &gt;&gt; and as a root out of dry ground. He hath no form nor clumliness. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. In other words, Isaiah is saying that there is no form, there's no attraction. Uh and there's no comeliness, there's no honor, there's nothing special about him that we should uh that we should desire him. And he is despised and rejected of men. I'd like you to notice this progression which I'll come to later. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God. See, they he he said, "We we we considered that God brought this upon him as smitten of God and afflicted, but he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed." Uh that's the whole man, body, spirit, and soul. &gt;&gt; With his stripes, we are healed. You may be seated. I spoke on the value of the flaw and we will we'll remember and recall and I will touch on just uh certain aspects of that. But I would like to speak to you today on a very strange subject. I've never spoken like this before. Excuse my voice, but it'll improve as we go along. I want to speak to you on the wound speaks. The wound speaks. So, we had the value of a flaw. The flaw. We all have flaws. And sometimes we've wondered about uh things in our lives or things of our past and whatever more. And now I want to speak to you and and I believe it's a very profound truth that the wound speaks. Uh Jesus embraced his his suffering. He didn't try to rid himself of pain. today, whether it be physical, of course, billions of dollars are are being made continually on on on the pain. Don't don't suffer any pain. If you got a headache, we got something. If you got a throat problem, we got something. And they're prescribing all kinds of prescription drugs because pe the the the whole age is we got a mentality. We mustn't suffer. We mustn't hurt. And even if you hurt mentally, they got medications and anti-depressants and all of these things. And if you're down, they put you up. And if you're too high, they can bring you down. And they can do all kinds of things with medications. So uh but Jesus he when this pain and this hurt and these things were happening he embraced his suffering and uh he he embraced not only the suffering he embraced the wound that he received at Calvary that brought a death but that death brought eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Looking unto Jesus, who is the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God." He despised the shame. He he turned aside from it and and the everything that he had suffered. Out from his side came blood, water and spirit. The spirit which is the life for the bride of Jesus Christ. So just let the structure come as I'm I'm giving it to you. line upon line. Brother Brandham said in the message Mark of the Beast, "God opened up the side of Jesus Christ at Calvary and took out the bride out of his side." He said, "It's beautiful." &gt;&gt; So he opened up the side of Jesus at Calvary and took out the bride out of his side as he did, of course, with Adam. It's not just a bride, but it's a bride with a voice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, the womb speaks. &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the bride say, "Come." &gt;&gt; She says something. &gt;&gt; And let him that heareth say, "Come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Our lips should say that. Our actions should speak that &gt;&gt; because our actions, as we'll learn a little later on, speak louder than words. &gt;&gt; More profound than words of your testimony is your life. The bride speaks the same word as he does as does the spirit. She is a word bride proving she has the spirit. In every church age we hear these words. She proves she's the bride. So it's not enough to say I believe in the message. I believe that God sent a prophet Malachi 4 and all of these things. That's wonderful. and and that's only you know so much uh structure but the the real proof of that is that we live that word we live that testimony &gt;&gt; so the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every church age we hear these words Jesus said in Luke he that heareth you heareth me. &gt;&gt; The wound speaks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His lips were still at Calvary, but Jesus continued to preach. &gt;&gt; He just used different instrumentality, but it's still Jesus Christ. I friends if we could just grasp and I'm trying to grasp it myself that God &gt;&gt; ordained that we would be born each one of us at our certain time and to our parents whoever they might be and live the life that he has caused us to live and meet the people and and finally meet him &gt;&gt; and to know him whom to know is life eternal. This was our purpose. And the real purpose from then on is that you will be you will you will be a sounding board. You will actually speak and be his voice. &gt;&gt; It would be something if some high official or government or the president of some nation or something says you know entrust you with a message. There's maybe millions others but we entrust you with this message because we know that you will do it. We know that you won't fail. We'll know that. We know that you'll take it and carry it. &gt;&gt; And we have been trusted and trusted with this message. &gt;&gt; Not only to speak it, &gt;&gt; but to live it. &gt;&gt; He that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. Now the wounding is a process and uh we might this might be all right here. Uh can you see that clearly? I I I try to use quite large text fonts for it. The wounding of Jesus was a process. He's despised and rejected. See, when we read Isaiah 53, often we just think of Calvary. &gt;&gt; No, this this happened long before Calvary. &gt;&gt; He was despised in his life. He was rejected in his lifetime and in his ministry. He was a man of sorrows. He was acquainted with sorrows. He was acquainted with grief. He lived it. He had that all the time. Yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. And this pattern also is also true in our lives in the masterpiece. He says uh okay under the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and in his vision and desired to see it was completed. And when it was completed he was so inspired by it. Now, he's talking about Michelangelo and the and the and the statue of of Moses, but he's tying that directly to the great sculpture, God himself, bringing forth Jesus Christ. He says, "And and and and uh and thought his own masterpiece should speak back to him." And he struck it across the leg and hollered, "Speak!" and it made a flaw on it and put a flaw on the image. He said, and this is I spoke on this now, but I I' I've thought of it many many times, and it's so contrary to what people normally think. And to me, the flaw was what made it the masterpiece. Maybe to the mind that might think different, you'd think that that spoiled it. No. To me, it made it what it was. &gt;&gt; Notice notice even the the grammar, brother. It made it what it was because he was wounded before the foundation of the world. He was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. So when he was here and God saw the his perfect image and he smoked him at Calvary, it made it. That's why the prophet saying that was that's what made it the masterpiece because it made it what it made him what it was. &gt;&gt; He always was the redeemer. &gt;&gt; He struck it and hollered speak. He wouldn't have done. Now, if we just take it to Calvary and he's thrust through with a spear and Almighty God is saying, "Speak." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who's he speaking of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus wasn't going to say hardly any more words. &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do." He said, "I thirst." Yes. &gt;&gt; And even then when they tried to alleviate some of his pain and put vinegar to his mouth on a sponge, he turned it aside &gt;&gt; cuz even the last moment he wouldn't take anything to alleviate any of the pain. He was going for the joy that was set before him. &gt;&gt; And that is why there's such a penalty on mankind to reject this kind of a sacrifice because he was doing it specifically for you and I. And he said speak. He said he wouldn't have done that if he'd have thought. He wouldn't have done that if he'd have thought. But he didn't think. It was inspiration of seeing what he had in his mind. Seeing there perfect before him. &gt;&gt; I want you to dwell on this inspiration for a moment. the inspiration uh of making uh uh the inspiration that God because he said that all inspiration is of God. So God is the fountain of inspiration. &gt;&gt; I wonder can God feel? Can God have inspiration? Can God have certain kind of feelings? Of course we're made in his image. uh uh it it's it's not as though everything is just static with him, you know. I mean, when when he saw his son Jesus Christ on earth and a voice of all of the universe, but a voice cries out of the heavens, this is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; God was pleased with what he saw. &gt;&gt; The inspiration of of making all things new. &gt;&gt; The inspiration of starting again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The inspiration of a new creation. &gt;&gt; You following my thought? &gt;&gt; The inspiration and I closed last the last time I spoke with uh you know someone takes and great discoveries and so on. People didn't write it on a piece of paper and get it right the first time. They filled, brother Brandon was saying, they filled basket waste baskets full of of of waste paper and attempts to get the right formula and get the right design and get something to work the way it's supposed to. They could say in their mind, "This has got to work." &gt;&gt; But they write it all out. It's not working. They don't just back away and leave it. Otherwise, they wouldn't have the inspiration. They're inspired. They're poets. They're writers. They're they're scientists. There are all kinds of gifted people, but even gifted people, they don't get it right the first time. &gt;&gt; And so inventors and they keep working at it and working at it. And and and I just closed, if you remember saying this world, it's a waste basket full of crumpled paper. &gt;&gt; And God, that's why he says, I'm going to make all things new &gt;&gt; and he's going to clean off this earth with a holy fire. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; he's going to clean the heavens with a holy fire? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, my loving brother, when the world's on fire, and it will be, &gt;&gt; I want to be in God's &gt;&gt; bosom. &gt;&gt; Not trusting in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, write, for these words are true and faithful. I thought of the inspiration of taking the book of redemption. What a great inspiration it must have been. How God must have been uh when he began to see the end drawing near and the conclusion of all things and the lamb taking the book and the and the sealed book. There's things that have been sealed that God kept to himself for all of these uh uh eons of time, but now he's going to make it known. and and of tearing open and loosing the seals. Say, "Those things that I held secret, my children need to hear it in this age in order for them to be able to stand. I'm going to equip them." &gt;&gt; As brother John Andy's preached, I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not going to cease to be your comforter. &gt;&gt; He's going He's He doesn't subtract. The Bible doesn't talk about subtracting. It talks about adding. He's going to add whatever we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to multiply it. &gt;&gt; And if children, the scripture says, "And then if children were heirs, heirs of God and joint hes with Christ, &gt;&gt; if so be that we suffer with him, &gt;&gt; that we may be also glorified together." the same process that he went through. We must not think it's strange at the fiery trials that are sent to try us. &gt;&gt; God sends them. God allows them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he rejoices to see people, his children don't succumb to it. &gt;&gt; Don't become defeated by it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that uh we suffer with him that we may also uh be also glorified together. For we have not an high priest, Paul says also in Hebrews 4:15, "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." He was tempted in all points. He was despised. He was rejected. He was turned aside. He was considered smitten of God. Oh, God did that to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; He experienced all that. That's why he can be a high priest &gt;&gt; to us. that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire. &gt;&gt; There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted. Above that you are able, &gt;&gt; but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily escape it, but able to bear it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what? The bride's going to make it. &gt;&gt; She's going to make it victoriously. She's not going to make it by the skin of her teeth. She's going to make it absolutely victoriously. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is his promise. This is his word &gt;&gt; that you may be able to bear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our life, brother Brandham says, speaks I'm uh rather this is not a quote. Now, our life speaks things after wounding &gt;&gt; that it could not say before &gt;&gt; the wounding. There are things that you can say after difficulties or &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a wounding. Now there are things that you can say after that wounding that you could not say before. Brother Bram says, "Your life speaks so much louder than your words. Till no matter what you say, people know what you are by what you are." &gt;&gt; How many recognize? &gt;&gt; How many have heard of Terry Fox? You only heard of him because of his wounding. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he hadn't gone through what he went through, you wouldn't even know his name. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't recognize the picture. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Terry Fox. In 1980, with one leg having been amputated, he embarked on a cross Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Though the spread of his cancer forced him to end his quest after 143 days, 5,373 km and 3,339 miles, and ultimately cost him his life. His determination and example created a lasting worldwide legacy. Now, I just want to stop there for a moment. He could have done a lot of other things when his leg was amputated. He could have gone to a wheelchair. He could have just said, "Well, I guess this is my life." He could have had the sympathy of his family, &gt;&gt; his church, &gt;&gt; if he has one, his friends. He was an athlete and he was well known in his local community. But he decided that that that he was going to do something and he was going to make this wound pay. Now when I say, "Do you recognize this fellow?" You say, "Yes." Why? And you say, "Well, who it is?" Most everyone would know that's Terry Fox. So the wound is speaking. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even know who it was if it wasn't for the wound. &gt;&gt; That's right. and the wound continued to speak. The annual Terry Fox run has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research. Over 500 million has been raised in his name. In 1980, Terry began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. Fox hoped to raise $1 for each of Canada's 24 million people. That was his goal to try to raise 24 million. He started with little fanfare from St. John's, Newfoundland. In fact, is hardly ever anybody knew that he was starting out from St. John's Newfanland. in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached Ontario. He made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and polit politicians. In his efforts to raise money, he was forced to end his run outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario, when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later. Fox was the youngest person ever named to a companion of the Order of Canada the nation's highest civilian award. He won the 1980 Lou Marsh Award as the nation's top sportsman and was named Canada's news maker of the year in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, roads, and parks named in his honor after the country. He said, "Even if," these are his words, "Even if I don't finish, we need others to continue. It's got to keep going." &gt;&gt; That's pretty concise, isn't it? Even if I don't finish, &gt;&gt; we need others to continue. &gt;&gt; It's got to keep going. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, seeing we also, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about now some other people that are running. &gt;&gt; You might be sitting here this morning, but we are running &gt;&gt; a race &gt;&gt; that that that supersedes even Terry Fox's marathon of hope. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight &gt;&gt; and the sin which doth so easily beset us &gt;&gt; and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. &gt;&gt; Wonder if you can say that with me. Let us run the with patience the race that is set before us. Let's say it again. Let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And humble thyself. The prophet said, "The people that I have tried to tell this gospel truth to and they turn their back on it and walk away and laugh at it." Now, to me, that seems like it's an insult. I don't care to me, but to the things that I've been trying I've been saying it's the truth trying to help them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I've been saying it's the truth trying to help them. Like like showing like shoving out a boat and say, "Here it is. Cross over here. Get out of that swelling stream. You're going to die." He said, "You're you're going to perish there." And they just laugh at you and walk away. Well, to me, it feels like if they walk away, there's nothing more I can do about it. But I can but I c that I can do. But I want to run down the bank now and persuade them. &gt;&gt; Come on back. &gt;&gt; I've got to have that feeling. He said, "I've got to have that feeling that he wants to run down the bank that he wants to that he wants to call out to even people that turn it aside, rejected it or rejected him and and but he knows that they're in a dangerous stream &gt;&gt; and they laugh at it and and think it's just nonsense. this all this divine healing or preaching that he was doing and the things that he was preaching and the manner in which he preached and the language and the grammar which he had great obstacles for a minister before tens of thousands of people but he realized that this is an eternal work &gt;&gt; and even if they do and they go away and they rush back on he's going to push the boat out &gt;&gt; come on back Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While I was writing this down and setting it, I said, I'm going to say that here today maybe there is some and you're not where you ought to be. You know, you're not where you ought to be. You're in a dangerous stream. &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to push the boat out and say, "Get in this boat. &gt;&gt; Come back to this word. Come back to what you know God has spoken and God has honored. &gt;&gt; Come on back." And I've got to have that feeling. And I can say to you today, I have that feeling. You might be out in the internet someplace or or wherever, but I'm appealing uh especially to the people that are here because you are here. I'm appealing to you. I've got that feeling. &gt;&gt; I I I know there is no word like this word. I know there is no vindication like this vindication. It's never been in the history. Do you hear me? It's never been in the history of humanity, &gt;&gt; but you have access to it. You can hear it. &gt;&gt; I was listening to the voice uh the voice of the sign, &gt;&gt; and I won't get to that, but I was listening to the voice of the sign. And the first person they call in the healing line, you should hear, I mean, it is so detailed. It is so it it it just compels you. It compels me to be a believer. Even if I read that one, it just so compelling. You can't have how do you have a man who's a stranger and tells such minute details of a person's life and and how things and people tried things and it failed for them and tried this and tried that and he just details the whole person's life and then tell them their name at the end. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that? See this? This is not That's a sign. &gt;&gt; That's a sign. &gt;&gt; And God said to Moses and God spoke to this prophet, if they don't believe if they don't believe the voice of the first sign, they'll believe the voice of the second sign. &gt;&gt; And friends, that's those are the sign. But now, a voice, he said, a voice comes behind the sign. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can have all kinds of signs and supernatural phenomena, but if you don't have a voice behind it, he said, "Forget it." &gt;&gt; But we've had a powerful sign. The world's never seen such sign as this. And then we say, we have a right to say, "What do we do with that sign? What do you do with that sign?" There's a voice that comes behind it. And not to heed. And if we fail to heed that voice, there is no hope. &gt;&gt; There's absolutely no hope. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another sign. You're not going to make it right in the tribulation. You're just not going to make it, friends, if we turn down this voice. &gt;&gt; I should have a lot more amens on that. Okay, we shut that off just now. So we have I expect it to be fairly solemn while we speak about this. We all have what we may term a flaw and flaws in our lives. And as I said to you previously, and I'll say it now again, some are allowed by God. Many are allowed by God. He will allow people to inflict them, but they're allowed by God. There are situations that you didn't invite. If you had any choice, you would do anything in your power to avoid or to escape it. I want to take the principles of Jesus life. He didn't try to escape it. He didn't try to just get some uh you know substitutionary thing to he didn't try to just take some pill. didn't try to, you know, alleviate. He just accepted it the way it was. &gt;&gt; Accepted what life was handing him. But this is where we fail. We fail to take that wound and surrender it somehow to God &gt;&gt; and yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit so that that wound here at Terry Fox can take a cancer and an amputated leg &gt;&gt; and and not that he become a hero that we're not attempting to become a hero but he did something &gt;&gt; for humanity. Amen. He built on his wound. He took He took his wound and said, "I'm not going to succumb to this. &gt;&gt; I'm just not going to give into it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it do something for me. I'm going to make it do something for people that suffer like I have suffered." &gt;&gt; Well, we're not in a run for a cure for cancer. We're in a run for a cure for sin. &gt;&gt; And we have the cure for sin. &gt;&gt; We have the antidote. I don't care what you're bound with. I don't care what you're tempted with. I don't care what the devil has said to you. We have the cure right here today. &gt;&gt; I have the cure right in this book. We have the cure right here in this message. &gt;&gt; There's been nothing left out. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said it's finished, it was finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we have a prophet say that all the mysteries have been unveiled, then you can guarantee all the mysteries been unveiled. It's up to you and I to discover what they are. I want you to have a good look at your life. Some have it could be something as little as financial, but I don't want to speak about that. Sometimes it's from broken homes, the deepest wounds or from the loss of a loved one. These are deep wounds and they're continuing wounds and things that you kind of wake up to yourself and you find yourself thinking about it. It's in your mind. You're turning it over, turning it over. I'm going to say something to you and won't you ever forget it. That's exactly what Satan wants to try to use. He wants to get into that subconscious and use that thing and wear you down and bring you down. And then you begin to question, why did God do that? Why has God allowed this? And why am I in this situation? &gt;&gt; I've got I've got a word for you today. &gt;&gt; And I believe I have a word from God for you. &gt;&gt; You can build on top of that &gt;&gt; and you can use it for the glory of God. God will use it for his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have testimonies also that are seated right here of people who have faced faced insurmountable, cruel, heartbreaking, heartrening experiences, &gt;&gt; but they kept their eyes on the goal &gt;&gt; and they said, "I will not be moved. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to cease from my fellowship. I'm not going to cease from my worship. I'm not going to cease from serving my God. I'm in fact is because Satan is trying to do that. I'm going to serve him more fervently. &gt;&gt; I'm going to pull out all the stops &gt;&gt; and I'm just going to say, Lord God, here I am. &gt;&gt; Use me. &gt;&gt; And we ought to say on a continual basis, what would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; God, what would you have me to do? I find myself in this situation. What would you have me to do? You know the dilemma. You know the pain. You know the wounding. And I don't have to relate that to you. Don't tell your neighbors. Don't get on the phone. That won't help. Talk to God about it. &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do? He's the only one who knows. &gt;&gt; Are we getting anywhere? &gt;&gt; Some of these are allowed by God. I'm going to try to take my time this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of these are brought upon us by others. &gt;&gt; And some others are still self-inflicted. We do things and we do silly things and we do foolish things. We do something that really brings a lot of trouble our way. And even that, even that if you surrender, you can't go back and undo it. &gt;&gt; So what do I do? Am I going to just wallow in it? &gt;&gt; Am I just going to let the thing deteriorate me? &gt;&gt; And I become an atrophied believer. &gt;&gt; I can't move. I can't hardly speak. I'm so twisted up and so bound up with this thing. &gt;&gt; I get bitter about it. If God does things or if this happens in the message, well, and I'm finished with it. Listen, friends, that's not the attitude. &gt;&gt; Just say, "God, you know, &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about our lives. I'm not speaking about what's happened in our church and so on." Don't get so don't get so confined to that. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about our individual lives now. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so some are how however it happens, whatever took place and they do. I'm talking about real situations. I'm talking about things that you think about when you leave this building this morning. I want to send you out not a mirror with a hope, not merely with some inspiration. I want to let you know there's a message from God that God can use any kind of failure. He can use any kind of disaster. He can use it for his glory. and the the attitude that you and I must have a say within your heart and soul. I am going to build on that. If Terry Fox can do what he does and I've got some others I want to bring to you &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to waste my life. &gt;&gt; You know, Bill Gates was the most wealthiest man in the world apparently. some say worth about $50 billion. But he realized in his own way he realized that this isn't life. This isn't what life is made up of. So he resigned and left his uh uh Microsoft and uh his partner became the head CEO and he he said it simply I'm done trying to make it now I'm going to spend the rest of my life I and my wife giving it away and are trying to do great things in Africa and do things just in the news recently that he wants to do things for the educational system and in and United States and other parts of the world. And he talked about his children. He said he intends to give most of it away and just leave enough for his children to be well cared for. He's not going to leave them as billionaires. &gt;&gt; He has another vision. I respect him for that. &gt;&gt; I read quite a bit about what he may do. something and and and there's nothing I would say extra spiritual special about his decision. He just realizes the emptiness of just having shares and you're worth billions. Who cares? &gt;&gt; Where's it going to what what what's it going to mean? You believe in the beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? One moment on the other side. &gt;&gt; Zero. zero. &gt;&gt; So why should we spend all of our energies &gt;&gt; focused all on this life? What we can get and what we can achieve? If God gives it to you, fine. Use it for his kingdom. &gt;&gt; But if you don't have it, serve him anyway. &gt;&gt; But why why spending our time and all of our life and sapping up all our energy? I'm not talking about not working when you're working. But you got your focus on the kingdom of God. You got your focus on the things that have reality to them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We allow God to use it. In Acts, the Bible says, "And when they had laid many stripes," I have I have a lot of examples, spiritual and and and uh out of human life as well. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, we're not reading a story book. We're talking about two of our friends, &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas. &gt;&gt; And when they had laid many stripes upon them, if it was two of our brothers that were here that were just in this situation, say, "Well, last night they took and and and subjected these men to stripes and they whipped them." We'd feel differently about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is two of our brothers. And they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely, who having received such a charge, he thrust them into the inner prison, probably like uh isolation or and made their feet fast in the stalks. And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They didn't succumb to it or hands. How are you, Silas? Oh, I'm all right. My my feet are hurting. These stripes are starting to really sting and and with the blood uh you know coagulating on our backs and oh, you think we could have avoided this? You think we could have done something different? Or do you think we we upset the people? No. They prayed and began to sing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they sang praises to God and the prisoners heard them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God turned them loose &gt;&gt; supernaturally from the thing that they were in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible speaks that they could have, you know, said, "Well, how how did this happen? What happened? my family or my relatives or my children or my husband or my wife or what I'm just I'm just take I'm just taking a broad brush. I don't care what the circumstance is. It's it's it just doesn't mean anything to me for this service. We either have a God who's absolutely in control Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just looking down seeing brother Ryan and Sister Yolena and how her father was turned down and I prayed about that. I prayed before and I prayed after said Elena that brother Nino I I I thought it's so cruel that he can't get to maybe be with his children in church or go with his wife and so on and this is years years and no doubt he could be sitting home this morning just saying why is this now I don't have another appointment till next April they just told me to go home and there's nothing no word and these are the authorities I can tell you I can tell you they could answer that man's problem in 10 minutes &gt;&gt; right that's right &gt;&gt; and it goes for year after year after year that thing because this is Satan's Eden. Don't forget it. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have a good time in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; But you're going to have a victorious time because the power of the Holy Spirit is greater than anything in this present evil age. &gt;&gt; And somehow, Sister Elena, you take a message to your dad. Somehow &gt;&gt; God will turn this thing around. &gt;&gt; God will get glory out of it. &gt;&gt; He just needs to surrender it and yield it to God. say, "Well, you know, Lord, &gt;&gt; and the Bible says, I'm sorry, the message is saying in harvest time when God saw that perfect one, now he's perfect one. He didn't bring anything upon himself. He didn't he not a thing that he did. He He was without sin. He was the perfect one. And he struck him and marred him." And Isaiah said he was wounded for the transgressions for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities. In the identified masterpiece of God, he said there was a perfect masterpiece and God smote it. What an example it was. He said God smote him for us. That's what makes him the perfect masterpiece. Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing that you you you can h you you you can excuse me for just I'm I'm trying to be very careful with my words, but you have a choice on what you do with your life. You can either simply give in and succumb to events, etc. We've had a brother may be sitting here, brother John, and he's been without his wife and children for over eight years, held up in the legal hassle and the just complete incompetence &gt;&gt; of our system and the and a man is without his f. Isn't there any Isn't there any common sense? A man is without his family. &gt;&gt; Surely there's a way that he could be with his family. &gt;&gt; Even if they came to visit or whatever more. You understand? &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, there may be complications and sections and this and that and the other thing." Listen friends, all of the laws and the government and everything are for the betterment of humanity, not for the oppression of humanity. &gt;&gt; I'm going to unload People have been smitten and people have been wounded and people have been hurt. Even with Jesus Christ, man was permitted to wound him to mar and to slay the Lord Jesus Christ. But it was God that smokeote him in allowing it. He was God's lamb. &gt;&gt; God raised him up to die. &gt;&gt; And God allowed people to do this. &gt;&gt; God raised you up. &gt;&gt; God gave you birth &gt;&gt; and raised you up &gt;&gt; and brought you right to this present time &gt;&gt; for what purpose? merely to do some housework or to work at a job or to get an education or or what is the purpose? &gt;&gt; Why are we here? &gt;&gt; Is that a good question? &gt;&gt; And the prophet said if we need to go to him who brought us here and ask him what he wants us to do. &gt;&gt; We ask our employer &gt;&gt; because we want to do a good job. We ask who we work for, what would you like me to do? What is my task? What is my job description? That's normal. But it wasn't our employer that brought us here. It was God who brought us here. What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; I'm not a I'm not against education. The the more education you have, perhaps the greater opportunity you have. But don't serve that as a god. &gt;&gt; Don't serve your job as a god. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not gods. They they will try to Satan will try to control you through economics, through education, through science, through civilization. He'll try to control it maybe through sports. Don't tell me that sports isn't controlling. It's controlling millions. &gt;&gt; Not only millions of sports people, it's controlling untold tens of millions of viewers. &gt;&gt; It tells you what you're going to do at a certain hour of the day. you're going to be sitting in front of some television or whatever more or in front of the radio, you wouldn't miss that for anything. &gt;&gt; Who's telling you to do that? Not God Almighty. &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying there's anything sinful. Maybe say hearing a a baseball game or a hockey game or something. I'm not saying that that's sinful. I'm just saying that we need to have God in preeminence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when brother Brandon was describing Michelangelo and the statue, he struck the masterpiece. And I I emphasized that two weeks ago and created the flaw. Brother Brandham said it was the flaw that made it the masterpiece. But now I'm on the second part of that. It was he he was so inspired that when he saw what was in his mind, he struck it and cried out, "Speak." &gt;&gt; That was what was to follow. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You happen to be the speech &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; of this message. &gt;&gt; You're the interpretation. People are reading you that will never pick up a message book, &gt;&gt; but they're reading you. And because of your life, they may well then pick one up &gt;&gt; and may may well enter into eternal life by your life. &gt;&gt; Absolutely true. &gt;&gt; If I gave you the choice today, &gt;&gt; I'm seeing all of you and we're here together. We're in this together. Would you sooner souls into eternal life or would you sooner towards condemnation and guilt and damnation? Even in this life, I mean, we can say, well, we believe in predestination. Indeed, we do. &gt;&gt; But we don't necessarily believe all the things that have to happen. All the things that do happen have to happen. &gt;&gt; You can save your life from many wounds &gt;&gt; and many hurts. &gt;&gt; Receive Christ early. True. &gt;&gt; So the flaw spoke back &gt;&gt; when he struck him at Calvary. Speak. The flaw spoke back. &gt;&gt; The wound &gt;&gt; had a voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That life from that broken blood cell, it was broken. The new creation of God, that blood cell that attached itself into the womb of Mary, a virgin. That blood cell now was broken by God himself. God who put it together and wrote it and had it spoken by uh prophets. And it brother Brandon says it was the words of the prophets that fastened or attached themselves &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary. &gt;&gt; And now God breaks that blood cell so that the life from that one can go out &gt;&gt; from his side. The blood cell was broken. And I will say it, it was broken to give the flaw a voice, to give the wound a voice. &gt;&gt; And the blood cell spoke back. The blood cell said things that wasn't necessarily an audible voice, but but but the broken blood cell, the wound spoke and said, "Redemption is finished." Yes. &gt;&gt; The wound spoke and said, "The family, &gt;&gt; the family, no wonder he could say over in Hebrews, &gt;&gt; behold, I and the children, &gt;&gt; thou hast given me." &gt;&gt; What could say that? Jesus didn't say that while he was in life. There's things that the voice of the womb spoke after. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul picks it up, sir. And he picks it up and he brings it from the Old Testament. Behold, I What is that? That was the wound that was speaking. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; As Terry Fox said things after the wound, he couldn't say those before the wound as a healthy young strapping young man. He could never have he could never have earned 500 million for cancer research. The world wouldn't have known him. He wouldn't have had all the adoration and all all the honor and streets named after him, etc. No, that was because of the wound. &gt;&gt; He did something with the wound. &gt;&gt; God has allowed us. &gt;&gt; I say that whatever your life is, God has allowed it. &gt;&gt; You might be going down easy street. You might say, "Hey, I don't know what you're talking about, Brother Ed. I I I I never tasted any of those things." Well, you'll remember this message someday. &gt;&gt; You say, "Now I know what he was talking about. Amen. &gt;&gt; I told you I'm really going to, you know, unload. &gt;&gt; Sometimes even believers, they start to be pained and the pain of their wound and the marring is so the suffering is so great that we can get ourselves all medicated up. so that we don't even live in the real world &gt;&gt; because it's the real world that's too painful. It is &gt;&gt; it is a the real world is a painful place. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But we won't get ourselves and give ourselves. I've gone and talked to people more than once. People who were born in believers homes and heard the message and sat in this church and heard it. I've gone to the psychiatric ward in the hospital to visit them and are all dazed trying to focus with their eyes. And I said I said to one person, "You don't belong here. These people here and the medical staff, they might be able to help these people that are walking around. Maybe you haven't been there. Brother Ed's been there. They're walking around and one nurse chas chasing a fellow with a hypodermic needle and he's yelling, "No, no, he's just going wild. A great big man cuz he doesn't want it." She has to give it to him to quieten him down. Maybe he's a violent man. I don't know. I tell you, this world hasn't got a remedy for anything that God allows us to go through. If God allows us to go through something, he's got a remedy for it. And furthermore, he wants to glorify himself with it. &gt;&gt; Don't simply succumb to it and say, "Well, I guess that's the way it is." That's not the way it is. God can take that and glorify himself with it. behold I and the children God hath given me. And the Godhead explained, he said, "When the blood cell was broke, it wasn't merely a man. That was God's life was released. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you have received the life from Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; it is not the life of a man. You have received God's life, &gt;&gt; divine life, &gt;&gt; divinity. And when the blood cell was broke in Jesus Christ, he said again, God was released. He was God. That blood wasn't Jewish. That blood wasn't Gentile. That was a creative blood cell. God himself. It's still a creative blood cell. &gt;&gt; And I think I touched on this, maybe just mentioned it, but I want to take it a little bit further. When God saw that masterpiece and it was so perfect, it was just the image of what he had in his mind. Couldn't have been entirely just Jesus Christ. Because even when God had a son here on earth in the form of Adam, he said, "It's good. It's very good." And then he took his rest. But when Eve, Eve, it was so perfect. But he brought Eve out of Adam because there had to be that family. That what was Satan destroyed in the beginning. And so now when God saw Christ and he smote him at Calvary, it wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't just that he was smiting Christ at Calvary, but he was looking beyond the physical body of Jesus Christ. He was looking beyond that. He was looking at the Do you know what was happening? Satan's head was being crushed by the seed of the woman. He was seeing Satan's head crushed. He was saying seeing the believers down through the ages defeating the enemy. He could see the martyrs going to the martyrdom and not bowing to it, not bowing to the system. He saw the bride of Jesus Christ, right? He saw a seventh messenger coming. He saw a prophet coming &gt;&gt; with a voice. He saw someone taking the the the book that had been sealed. All of that. He could see all of that. That was that's it was such inspiration to him. &gt;&gt; I think would inspire. I really do. As I pondered this and as I prayed about this subject, I could see God seeing people where, you know, it'll almost be a privilege to live in a martyr age &gt;&gt; and they were anointed for it. &gt;&gt; And they didn't run away from it. He said they ran to it &gt;&gt; because that was the anointing that was on them. They ran to it. &gt;&gt; We've got a much more difficult age. It would be it would be simpler say uh uh deny that or deny that or you go to the chamber whatever more you say well no I'm not going to deny it and do what you wish to do &gt;&gt; but this age this is far more subtle &gt;&gt; just well you know you know what's so subtle about this age is because Satan can accept the fact that a pe a a person is almost a believer. &gt;&gt; I identify with it. I go to church. I sing all the same songs and and I'm almost a believer. &gt;&gt; And I confess to be a believer, but somehow the life and the testimony are two different things. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "Our life is speaking so loud in heaven that he can't hear the words. Preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now it's what is lived, the life that is lived. And God saw, friends, we talk about bride, bride, bride. God saw the bride. &gt;&gt; God saw her. &gt;&gt; God saw who was coming through the gates. God saw all that. And I believe that it was the whole scene that God saw that his arc enemy was finished. His head was crushed. His deceit and deceiving in the garden is finished. And out from this sacrifice, out from this wound is going to come a whole host of witnesses. &gt;&gt; And they're going to declare &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; as their savior. They're going to declare this sacrifice as their atonement. They're going to declare it openly and boldly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that inspiration when he saw that perfect image, that inspiration caused him to strike it &gt;&gt; and blood and water came forth and spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you don't have to, you know, feel as though I'm zeroing in on just this congregation. Not at all. Brother Brandham said all the prophets had flaws. &gt;&gt; Just as well that we admit, you know, we got flaws. &gt;&gt; I talked a little bit about the sticky nature, but uh I I don't want to dwell on that. But he said all the prophets had flaws. And regardless of the flaw that we may carry, God will turn it to his glory and to your victory &gt;&gt; if you just yield it to him. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how can I yield it to him?" By yielding yourself to him. &gt;&gt; Yield yourself to him and be in full preparation for an answer from God. When a person fully surrenders themselves, I'm here to be a testimony to this. I don't have that many years. We don't have that many days. We don't know what tomorrow holds. I'm here to be a voice. &gt;&gt; To give voice to that wound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a man that was born blind. That's quite an impediment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Born blind. And the disciples asked Jesus saying, "Master, who did send? This man or his parents that he was born blind?" There's got to be some reason, something that we could mentally grasp in our mind. Why is this man born blind? Just think of it, friends. Sight is so precious &gt;&gt; to see the beauty and the flowers and all of the things and and the creation. How marvelous it is. But you're born blind, lived in a dark world for years and years and years, grew up with friends and never saw their face. born blind. Who sinned? The man or his parents? There's got to be a reasonable answer. Some place to nail the guilt, &gt;&gt; the responsibility for this. And Jesus said, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him." &gt;&gt; That God would get the glory. You know what friends? You know the problem even in this message? People don't understand God. &gt;&gt; How do you understand that kind of God? This man been born blind. &gt;&gt; Wasn't even a a a demon apparently because God allowed it &gt;&gt; for that moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that Jesus Christ could get glory and give him his sight. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, was that worth it? Is that the kind of God?" Yeah, that's the kind of God we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God was glorified &gt;&gt; and the man was healed. &gt;&gt; What a wound he carried. &gt;&gt; What a flaw all through his life. Somehow if I'm I I could dwell on all of these but uh brother Brandham said that I believe that every bornagain member of the body of Christ every member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know a paradox, what a paradox is is unbelievable yet but but might be true &gt;&gt; because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know that what a paradox is is a miracle. Unless that happens, you cannot be a Christian. There must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change the spirit in a man and give him a new birth. coming here to church or shaking the right hand or none none of that will give you new birth outside of God. God alone is the only one that could do it. And is a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be. &gt;&gt; What he can make it &gt;&gt; a paradox. It's a situation that seems to be absurd or contradictory, but in fact it is or may be true. &gt;&gt; Our lives are a contradiction. A believer is a contradiction &gt;&gt; in this generation. And I so there are all kinds of wounds, scars, marring, emotional, there's complexes and uh he said pray that God will place into my heart. Brother Brand was saying standing in a gap, pray that God will place into my heart that something that I lost out there in that complex. It's so easy to build a complex. &gt;&gt; That's true, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to build a complex. I'm saying that to this congregation and the listening congregation today because we don't want that to afflict our lives. &gt;&gt; You get build up a certain feeling and it's a complex. And brother Brandham built up a feeling and he had he had this complex. Uh sometimes it can be from brother Bram said now the genes and the father and the mother of this boy he's talking about a young man and a young man wanted to get married to a girl. So he said the genes in the father mother this boy he said no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh that's been interbred out into to to this boy. Therefore the boy has has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving. They will not apologize. And that's where that boy stands. He says, you know, because he he had an attraction to this young lady and then did something. They don't go into any detail. Did something just left her high and dry and walked away and brother Brandon as a prophet nails it bat and says that's because he has a complex and he goes and describes the mother and father and the father was an Irishman and the mother was a German. And he says, you know, the one family, uh, they're wild and their fathers are wild and they're drunkards and they're they're shooting and everything. They're just a wild bunch. And the mother is a different person. They're just they just stare. They will never forgive or they it's hard for them to apologize and a completely different nature. And he says the boy is a complex. It was in the genes of the parents. It came down to him. Oh, there he is, friends. Some of you young fellas, young ladies, maybe maybe you're going through something and it actually came down to you. &gt;&gt; Came down to you. &gt;&gt; So you say, well, I am the way I am because of maybe my parents. Yeah, that's what he said. We said, now what do we do? You better surrender it to God or you're going to carry it all your life. &gt;&gt; And you can surrender it to God. Don't sit here just looking at me. &gt;&gt; You can surrender. There isn't anything that God God knew exactly what you would experience in your life. He knew precisely the home you'd come from. He knew precisely everything you would experience in life. everything &gt;&gt; and things you don't want to even talk about, things that you've heard, things that are in the back of your mind and you don't want to even express, you cannot express. Sometimes they're so deep they can't get it out. &gt;&gt; True. He said, "Don't ever build up a complex. Lacking the Holy Spirit can cause a complex." Brother Brandon talks about a young man in the church right when he was speaking and he was a minister. He was sitting there and a pastor of a church. But he said when he was a young man, he came to my house and he had a complex but he said I saw the potentials in him and from a fine Bible institution but he just he but just he lacked what Moses lacked and that was the what the burning bush had. No, we we can have good people sitting here in the in the congregation this morning. I want to tell you we we need something more than good people. &gt;&gt; We need Holy Ghost fil people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy Don't settle for anything less. &gt;&gt; If you don't know you have the Holy Ghost and stop at nothing &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost will start to live a life through you that's not your life. It's another it's a life from another world. Life from another place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I know. I've been quite a while, but are you you still listening? &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip some of this. I talked about Moses a couple weeks ago and he his impediment and brother Brandham said that he had a besetting sin. It was his temper. He says that in the message just in case you're want wanting to know Israel in the church and he said but you know it's amazing I I just want to take the time. He said he was raised a peculiar life but God had his hand on him. How he was hid in the bull rush born in a time of persecution just like Christ. born a proper child just like Christ. He was born in this world to be a deliverer just like Christ. And oh how he his work how he was a lawgiver went up into the mountain stayed for 40 days came back down with the law and he his besetting sin was temper and he broke the commandments cast them down onto the earth when he saw what the people were doing. You renegades and he cast it down and that was his besetting sin. But that didn't change anything about him. He still was Moses and he was he came at the right time. You came at the right time. &gt;&gt; He was who he was. You are who you are. &gt;&gt; And all he needed was an experience. All he needed was to stand in front of the burning bush &gt;&gt; and hear a voice. &gt;&gt; I'm the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he start to live a different life after that. had been 40 years there. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to turn I'm going to just index this around. Be patient with me, would you? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he tells life story about 10 or more times. And I I I get extremely moved when I read life story. I remember the first time I read it, I was I think 18 years old and I just I was completely overcome and I literally wallowed on my bed. If you young fellas haven't read, you young ladies haven't read, you want to get and read life story &gt;&gt; and know that that God is not back there. That God is right here &gt;&gt; speaking to you, dealing with you. I just tell you my own experience. I don't mind saying it. Brother Bram says sometimes I I'm I'm like a baby, you know, because he was crying. I was reading life story because it fit into part of this message which I'm coming to now. And I had to stop. I just had to stop. I was so broken up. And then my whole life come before me. I tell you God, God knows how to speak to a person. He's talking about he met some people and now brother Brandham is a young man he just got married to Hope and he goes to tell Hope's mother and he says and that didn't work so good and she said William she said she's your wife you may take her if you want to but I but said I don't want my daughter drugg out among that bunch of trash brother Brad says h trash friends I found out this that what she thought was trash &gt;&gt; is the cream of the crop &gt;&gt; and that's right I say that with respect &gt;&gt; friend he said the little girl that was too good to be with that trash. I buried her just a little after that. Sorrow set in right there. He never said sorrow ended there. He said sorrow started right there. That's where it set in. He had walked in to the hospital. This is just within a few months of that trash. And because of his mother-in-law called these people trash and I don't want you to drag my daughter down there. She's your wife and you can do it, but I don't want her down there with those screaming, hollering people. And so he didn't do it. He didn't take her down there. And now his wife's in the hospital and Samadair said, "Don't go in there. She's she's going." And he he said, "I pulled I pulled the door behind me. I looked over there. She had real dark eyes and black hair. German girl. She was all doubled up like this. And I looked down upon her and just as still, I put my hand on her forehead and it was real sticky. Didn't look like she had any life. I put my hand over on her head and said, "Oh, God." Now he's praying. "Oh, God." I said, "That's my baby's mother. Let me let me tell her goodbye. Will you do it, Lord? Let me tell her goodbye. I don't want her to go without telling her goodbye. Will you help me, dear God? If there's forgiveness in your great heart, now he had a reason for saying that. If there is forgiveness in your great heart, will you just let me say goodbye to her? Said her head moved and I looked down. And if I live a hundred years, I'll never forget those big dark eyes looked at me. That's his wife. And immediately after, he's going to his daughter's bedside. And he's up beside her bedside. And he says, and I said, "Do you know Daddy, honey?" And her little lips trying to speak to me like this. goo to me and they were quivering. She's a dying. I put my hand over on her and I said, "Oh God," same words, "Oh God, please God, don't take her. You took my wife, you took my daddy, and you've took." And he broke. "Oh, God, isn't there forgiveness in your great heart?" I said, "Please, dear God, please spare my baby." I thought, and I said, "Won't you do it, Lord?" Just looked like a black sheet began to unfold coming down. And oh, I knew I knowed she was gone. And I looked at her. He said, "Oh my, if I had it to live over again, they would never they would never be trash." See where he went right back to? He knew in his heart that God was taking these his wife and his baby and he's praying, "Please forgive me." He said, "I'd never, if I could do it again, &gt;&gt; I'd never let them be trash." &gt;&gt; When I read that, I'm just Brother Ed Biscll up here today and I know this goes on the internet, but when I read that, I just thought, what kind of hope is there for a person like myself? the holiness and the justice of God. God's not cruel. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; And the baby left. And he said, "If I had my life to live over, I'd never let that be trash." Just that one act of not going where God opened the door and he refused to go and he listened to a woman who said they're trash. And for that you talk about wounded. &gt;&gt; You talk about wounded friends. Maybe some of you young people you haven't you haven't stood beside your loved ones casket. You will someday. And it'll be a sting. It'll be a real sting at the separation. No matter if you're a believer, they're a believer. There'll be a that separation. Not necessarily sorrow, but there'll be a great wound that'll happen. And here's a young man just got married. He's got his wife and he sees her in such agony and she goes, "I'm not playing on your emotions. I'm This is the prophet that God raised up &gt;&gt; and God let him go through that &gt;&gt; and his baby is taken from him because he didn't go to the people that were called trash by his mother-in-law." I don't expect that we will fully understand that. But I'm going to say this. This was years later. And he tells a story and tells it and tells it and tells it and it's the same every time. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's real. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's still painful. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said, "If you could only do it over again years later, if I could only do it over again." Are you We all got things. &gt;&gt; We all got times. We all got instances of and maybe haven't lived long enough. But when you come to that side, if I could only do it over again, &gt;&gt; listen friends, he couldn't do it over again. You can't do it over again. I can't do it over again. But the one thing we can do is do what he did. He surrendered the whole life to God. &gt;&gt; Here I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he took a message and he took the signs of almighty God to the same people. And God got the glory. &gt;&gt; What a life. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? &gt;&gt; And one of the times when he told life story, he prays He says, "Oh Christian people," so I'll say it to you, "Oh Christian people, one of these days I know beyond the reach of mortal kin. Someday God only knows just where and when the wheels of mortal life will all stand still." Says, "Then I'm going to make a trip up to Zion's hill." He says, ' And I've tried to live with all my heart, dear Jesus, to live for you, to do the thing, no matter what this cross is or how scornful it seems to be. I love you, dear Jesus. You've broken my heart over and over, but I love you. Amen. &gt;&gt; This may be a part of the message, you know, that you haven't heard too often, but I'm dwelling on it. God's messenger &gt;&gt; saying in prayer, "Dear Jesus, you've broken my heart over and over. Not once, not twice, but over and over. But I love you." &gt;&gt; That was the key. &gt;&gt; But I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. and by loving him said I love you for it and I pray now dear God that you'll help me to fulfill the commission that you have given that I might finish my course with joy so he looked at what was happening what had happened he can't change it but I'm looking towards the future and that I might finish my race with joy Hey, I don't know. The Lord will help me and you help me. I got a couple more examples I want to give you. And the prophet says that you should see Christ Jesus in every verse of the scripture. And here's a man of Job. And this this is the progression of his wounding. The progression. A runner comes. He's lost his possessions, his animals. Then he lost his servants. He lost his children. He was in such such grief. He wasn't able to speak. And those friends, then his friends came. Friends, you know, it's amazing how powerful friends are. &gt;&gt; You have friends now. His friends came and they just sat for seven days cuz they couldn't even utter a word. His condition was so dismal. And then Satan was able and allowed by God to afflict his body and he has boils from hand from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. I'm not just telling you a story. I'm not just preaching. I'm preaching a real gospel. &gt;&gt; This happened to believers. &gt;&gt; This happened to a man that God could God said he's perfect before me. You talk about wounded. I thought I would have time and I don't have the time. I haven't lost my children. I know sadness in my life. And I know a little bit of what I'm speaking about. I wouldn't speak about what I've gone through. You had brother Gary Walker here. We remember his testimony. &gt;&gt; You remember it well. &gt;&gt; I when I heard that I said I have no problems. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have even heard. Do you know when you what you heard him what you heard here? It was the wound speaking. &gt;&gt; It was a man who had been through incredible suffering. It's a beyond description. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I personally believe that God has allowed him to have the infirmities that he's had because it's so uh it so impacts the listener. &gt;&gt; You hear here's a man not talking about his suffering. He is suffering. &gt;&gt; He's having difficulty standing here at the And then he brother Tom's going to be with him in a in next month as they speak together at the Serbia convention in Serbia. And I I I can't comprehend how a man in his condition can get on those planes and travel for 12 and 14 and 15 hours. I was moved. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't Gary Walker just speaking. It was the wound speaking. &gt;&gt; He yielded the wound to God. &gt;&gt; And he told you in sincerity. He stood here. He said, "I I come to believe that God raised me up because he hated me." That's what he said. "I believe that God raised me up and actually let me live so he could pour his anger out on me." &gt;&gt; That's just how far and how low a person can get. And yet God was going to glorify himself through it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Job finally when he was in this terrible state, having lost his sons and daughters who he had just offered, he offered sacrifices for them in case they might sin. And here God comes and and allows them to be wiped off the map &gt;&gt; in a day. &gt;&gt; And his cattle is gone. His possessions are gone. You talk about an economic collapse. He had it. You haven't had it like he had it. &gt;&gt; Don't get weary with the Sunday morning. You may well need what I'm speaking on just down the road a short time &gt;&gt; or might be sooner than you think or you might be going through it right now. And this is the answer for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And after this incredible wounding, the wound spoke. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't he couldn't say this before his wounding, but he could say it after the wounding. He said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, &gt;&gt; and naked shall I return thither." The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that wasn't the end of his wounding. Listen. Then his friends turned into accusers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they spent a long time and they detailed you. You have, you know, you've been honored. People listen to you. And now look at you. Look at the state that you're in. And they begin to accuse him and tell him exactly as the scripture says in in Isaiah 53 that the people considered Jesus smitten of God. &gt;&gt; And now Job's friends are telling him the same thing. You've been smitten by God. &gt;&gt; God's against you. &gt;&gt; And so the wounding continued. It was, like I said, it's a progression. But then &gt;&gt; when you get over into the 19th chapter &gt;&gt; and he details in the 19th chapter and listen what he says. Have you got time? &gt;&gt; Then Job answered, "How long will you vex my soul and break me in pieces with words? &gt;&gt; These 10 times have have you reproached me and you've you've and you're not ashamed that I make that you make yourself strange to me." No. know now that God hath overthrown me. Said it's not you. God has overthrown me and hath come past me with his net. Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry aloud and there is no judgment. He's describing his life now. He's describing the wound. He said, he hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass and he has set darkness in my path. Heath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head. Heath destroyed me on every side, and I'm gone. And mine hope hath he removed like a tree. He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counted me unto him as one of his enemies. What a prayer. &gt;&gt; Look how low he got. &gt;&gt; God has counted me as one of his enemies. His troops came to gather and raise up their way against me and encamp around about my tabernacle. He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintances are verily and strange to me. My kins folks have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. They that dwell in my house, and my maids count me as a stranger, and I'm an alien in their sight. I called my servant and he gave me no answer. I intreated him with my mouth. My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated her for the children's sake of my own body. Yay, young children despised me. I arose and they spake against me. All my inward All my inward friends abhored me, and they whom I loved are turned against me. My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I'm escaped with the skin of my teeth. Have pity upon me. Have pity upon me, oh ye my friends, for the hand of God has touched me. Why do you persecute me as God? Are you not satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my words were now written. &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were printed in a book, &gt;&gt; that they were graven with an iron pen. and led in the rock forever. For I know &gt;&gt; my redeemer liveth &gt;&gt; that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth at after the after his own description of the vile uh way that he been treated in the life and now God allowed it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I know &gt;&gt; he couldn't say that before and he never did say it before. Who's speaking? What's speaking? The wound is speaking. &gt;&gt; He could only say it after he's wounded. I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at the last time, the last day, he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet at life flesh shall I see God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have I weirded you out? &gt;&gt; Been a long time. There. Just one more thing. I'm going to lay most of this aside. All right. How many ever heard of the five young men that went as missionaries to the AA Indians? How many have heard it here? There was a five young men, Jim Elliott. These are young men from the states. Jim Elliott, Nate Saint, Ed McCauley, Peter Fleming, and Roger uh Udian. Uder in I believe it is. They go to Ecuador to bring the gospel to a most primitive and violent tribe called the Aka Indians. I'm not saying their original name, but that's what they were known as. In September 1955, this just a year after less than a year after my wife and I were married, they began flying over the area where the trib's people were and they would they began dropping gifts so they could exchange gifts. And after several months of giving gifts, on January the 3rd, 1956, January the 3, they set up a little uh established a little camp on a river called the Kurar River. And they had a little plane that they were flying over and dropping these gifts. And this was just a few miles from the AA settlement. Just five days later, they were only on the sandbar five days. Five days later, all five of the young men were attacked and speared by a group of Aka warriors, killing all five of them. The news of their deaths was broadcast around the world. Of course, we heard it even up in northern British Columbia right away. And they said that it the life magazine carried a whole pictorial section of these young men. They said it literally galvanized the evang evangelistic fervor all over the earth. Just the lives of these five young men. the one his wife Elizabeth Elliott and she was a wife of Jim and the sister of Nate Saint her name is Rachel and Jim Elliot was born in Portland and the airplane they've just discovered it was buried in the sand and uh and they they got the main frame the structure out from the sand the warriors they buried the airplane and it is now in the first first city that my wife and I were in in special meetings in Nampa, Idaho. And the airplane is restored there in a in a museum now. But uh uh Elizabeth Elliott, wife of Jim and Rachel Saint, who's the sister of Nate Saint, they returned directly returned to Ecuador. And they gave years of their lives to the AA people and to the very warriors that killed the missionaries. And I've seen a picture of one one of them who actually speared the boys has become a Christian because of their efforts. There was no no way to get the gospel to these pe people, primitive and violent people. No way. And these two women and particularly Elizabeth Elliott, she she wrote a language, wrote uh letters and gave an alphabet to their tribal language so that they could read that, learn that, and then translate the Bible into that language so they could hear the gospel. Now, I tell you what, friends. I'm talking about a wound. There's a woman that loses her husband, another one that loses her brother, and they decide they're not just going to live at home and take flowers to a grave site once a year. &gt;&gt; You're quiet, but you'll remember this service. They decided, we're going to give our lives. And if you went on the website and and about Elizabeth Elliott or Betty Elliott, but she lived there for years and brought the gospel to those people and that was the that was the first time they'd ever heard about Jesus Christ. And that same woman came with her father and traveled through British Columbia and landed in Dawson Creek and spoke in the church that I was pastoring. I had her give a testimony. And so I met Betty Elliott and her father after this terrible time. I think she was on her way to Alaska. There was there was a lot of hurt. There's a lot of a lot of pain. There was a lot of separation. And yes, the whole world could get all enthused, excited about it. But there was somebody who said, and this is my point of my message. Somebody said, "I'm going to make a difference. I'm going to do something with this pain." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to surrender it to God. I'm going to let it I'm going to let it do something for God. Now, these are outstanding. These are I only give them as an examples. I want to say to this church, we can do more. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about offerings. I'm not talking about money. I'm talking about you, your life, your time. We're not here on a on a vacation. We're not here on a holiday. We're not here, as brother Brandham says, on a picnic. I believe that we have we have whatever health and life and strength God has given you. Your first call is the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's your first call. And whatever resources God puts in your hand. That is for the use of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And the gospel of Jesus Christ is for husbands to feed their families. That's and that that's all that's all part of the gospel. So I'm not talking about offering. I'm not talking about money. I'm just saying to you, don't waste your life &gt;&gt; living for yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't waste your life just by bettering your own environment. &gt;&gt; That's a total waste. &gt;&gt; There's no reward for that. &gt;&gt; Spend your life &gt;&gt; bettering it for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Reach out to somebody else. You can speak to someone else. You can send them a message book. You can send them a message. You can send them a DVD. You can do something. You can phone them. You can live a witness wherever you are. But live your life for someone else. This this life and brother Tom mentioned in his last service I believe it is so self-centered. You know what it does? It makes us impotent &gt;&gt; because our whole world is around me and mine and this and all only things that concern me or make me happy or make life easier for me. We're not here to have an easy life. &gt;&gt; We're here as laborers in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; I was just doing a little bit. I needed to do a little bit of kind of look back because of some comments that were made. So I just look back and my my wife carries a little Hallmark calendar in her purse and just you know just make a little note on the date where this that the other thing and where we are and whatever more and I know that you you've known that I've traveled a lot but in the last 10 years I preached 77 conventions in the last 10 years and I don't regret it at all I wouldn't want to do it again, but I don't regret it at all. I think that if we allowed if God opened I couldn't do that if God hadn't opened the door and you people made it possible and and tolerated it and everything else. But and and and yet I I feel I I'm so humbled and humiliated. But brother Brandham here here here the one that's beside him is going to take him beyond the curtain of time. And he has just put his hand behind his head and said, "Well, Bill Brandham," and these were his words to me. "Well, Bill Brandham, you're 52, and if you're going to do anything for God, you better get going." &gt;&gt; When he said that, I felt about a quarter of an inch high. &gt;&gt; And I still feel the same way. But whatever we've been given, you're going to meet people that I and the rest here aren't going to meet. And God's going to give you an opportunity. And maybe you won't be able to say a word. I've got neighbors. I feel terrible. I haven't had a real good solid chance to witness. I have spoken to them a wee bit from time to time but you know it's just kind of a general never been able to really get to the subject and I feel terrible about that but one thing they see our car go out to church they know that we are believers they know that we are Christians and we don't hesitate the lady across the street her husband died here a short time ago and I went over and told her that we will pray for her and remember her and she was very touched the the the the musician, the well-known musician, uh Robbie Bachmann, his wife died at 29 years old from cancer. And I I told him about the healing and I told him about the ministry and told him how God heals those things and and he tapped my hand and he was touched. He said, "Well, thank you. We I don't know. I I wish we had better opportunities. But whatever opportunity God gives us, whether by speaking or by living it, your actions are louder here on earth &gt;&gt; than any word that you could speak. And our testimony and our actions should be exactly exactly the same. &gt;&gt; And whatever you have gone through, whatever you've suffered, whatever you've experienced, I want this to be an announcement. &gt;&gt; Let God &gt;&gt; take that. and use it for his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I really mean that. I really mean that. Don't Don't let Don't let the present economic conditions swallow you up. Don't let any between yourself, your family, your friends. Don't let that swallow you up. Set your sight for the kingdom. Set your sight. We only have this one time, friends. we only have this one time. And I it it is as though today I I really felt I just felt like, you know, throwing the gauntlet down and saying, you know, you young fellas, you need to set yourself aside, give yourself in prayer and find out what God wants you to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you do that, you'll never never regret it. &gt;&gt; And on the other side, if you do that, you'll come on the other side and you'll give me a hug. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For saying that, &gt;&gt; you'll never regret it. You'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; And things that you desire in your heart, God God knows those desires. young men, young ladies. I say young because you've got some youth, you've got some energy, you've got some future if God allows us to have some future. I'm sorry for I've taken so much time and yet I can't apologize because this this has just been gripping and and we have lots of testimonies here in the congregation of people who've given themselves unreservedly and it it really speaks to me. I'm thankful for what you've done, brother Richard. You're you're just one I don't want to set you, you know, Brother Richard Drake has just quietly he just worked for God. He's a bus driver now. He's in charge of, you know, scheduling or something. I don't know what it is. All I know is that when some kids and some people in some orphanages need something, he managed to get some of your sisters together and sort out clothes and away they go over there. You don't know what that means to them. They say, "There's some real Christians." I believe we can do something. Brother, I'm closing right now with this. Brother Murphy stood up and preached in Switzerland. And Switzerland's probably listening right now, Sunday evening. And the brother of whom I'm speaking who just emailed me a few days ago, I would expect that they listen every Sunday. And you're probably listening, Brother Daniel. But it spoke to my heart and I haven't answered him yet. Brother Murphy preached and I sat behind. You may think that your heart is spoken to. You may think that you know you're gripped. I was so gripped. I was so humbled when brother Murphy was done. I felt I cannot add anything to this. And I just came. There was a nice audience of people and I just came to the pulpit, leaned over the pulpit and I yelled out, "Do something and close the service." And this brother, he owns a factory. He's a businessman. He is so occupied. But he wrote me an email and he said, "You know, you spoke at that service and and we spoke together about doing something. There's there's so much that could be done and we spoke about the hub and we spoke about all these things. I tell you what, friends, there's just so much that can be done and brother uh Timothy Andes and and working under brother John's direction, but they got all the people together and I understand about 35% of this congregation is meeting to put the messages up on the hub. When I talk about message of the hub, I'm talking about a prophet's message &gt;&gt; reaching people all around the world. And I I'm I don't have some, you know, uh a strange kink about that. I am absolutely obsessed with it. &gt;&gt; And why wouldn't we be? &gt;&gt; If you could get somebody else to hear it and someone else to experience what you're experiencing, wouldn't that be a thrill? &gt;&gt; Absolutely a thrill. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I spoke to you and I said, I want to and I still do." And life is empty. &gt;&gt; Life is empty without that focus. &gt;&gt; And I pray that God will grant that. Thank you for your kind attention. If you bow your head, would you stand with me, please? Dear loving Lord Jesus, the one that walked up Calvar's hill, the one whose visage was so marred more than that of any man. And in the as your prophet and servant describes describes it in such detail, it was difficult for me to read. I couldn't hardly comprehend the suffering and the wounding that you went through. And Lord, it was not just for that, but it was that a life that a a an experience could come, that a voice could come. And I want to testify here today in public. I've heard that voice. &gt;&gt; I heard that call. &gt;&gt; The people that are standing here, oh God, many of them have heard that call. Some perhaps have not heard that call. But even even this morning, you've allowed the words to escape my lips, Lord, and go directly by the Holy Spirit to their hearts. And I will not close the service, oh God, until you are done dealing with every heart and every life. Lord, perhaps there is someone that needs to surrender their upset and to surrender their reversals and not allow them to be overcome by it. Oh God, I pray they will shake themselves and realize this is the only life. This is the only time. This is the only chance that we have. I pray, Father, that as we speak about the eminent uh rapture and the and and the receiving of Christ, Christ receiving us, Lord, if we are really believing that, how much more we want to uh use up and and and redeem the time. Father, I pray that you will impress this people as you have impressed me. Deal with them, Lord, as you've dealt with my own heart. I pray, oh God, I call on you by the Holy Spirit. Father, I pray that we will use every opportunity, every opportunity that comes our way to to uh further the kingdom of God here locally, Lord, in its own church, Father, the school, the camp, or whatever more. We do it for your glory. We do it, oh God, not for our enjoyment. We do it that you might touch somebody that we can do it, Lord, that we might get one last seed. Lord, we're pushing the boat out. We're calling people to come in. Come into this boat and don't get it caught in this raging torrent of time. And the people, Lord, the way that they're going, how sad it is, Lord, going headlong to destruction. Don't let our young people be caught up in that. Oh, God. Don't let them get caught up with the the entertainment and and the things that simply brth bring a thrill to this flesh. Oh God, may we cast down. For they that live after the flesh shall die, but they that live after the spirit shall live. Oh, Father, in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, call I pray. I pray, oh God. Pray, oh God, that you'll do so this Sunday afternoon. Father, &gt;&gt; in Jesus name, speak, speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. I wonder if we could have that chorus, Brother Ryan. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. and I will I'll be quick to answer thee. Could you help me, brother Derek, if you're here? Sorry. Okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; let's just close our eyes, shall we? As we sing it, &gt;&gt; speak my Lord. [Music] thee and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me. Once again prayerfully, please. &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. [Music] Speak and I'll be quick. to answer. [Music] Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. [Music] Speak and I will answer. Lord, &gt;&gt; here's what we want to say. I'll say yes. Yes. I'll say yes. Yes. Say yes, Lord. Yes. To your will and to your way. &gt;&gt; Let's just raise our hands. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; Surrender to him. Oh yes, I will trust you and oy when your spirit speaks to me. With my whole heart I answer will be yes, Lord. Yes. And there's other one too. I'll say yes. Yes. Just don't say yes. I'll say yes. Yes. Yes. Say it from your heart now. I'll say yes. Yes. Yes. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. [Music] Yes. As a young teenager that wrote that, it's very simple. I'll say yes. Yes. But I'm going to invite there may be others. There may be someone that God has spoken to in a special way. And I'll tell you what, brother Biscll, you might say, "What what are you attempting to do, brother Biscll?" I'm ask God today that you might feel the inspiration that is within this being. I feel so inspired about the work of God. I feel so inspired. I feel so jealous over the work of God that God has done not only locally but what he's done elsewhere. Friends, I just can't I can't rest if there's another day if there's another thing that we can do. And I say God bless the young people. God bless all who are been involved. God bless our teachers, our Sunday school teachers. God bless the work. God bless the deacons and the trustees. God bless the believers that are gathered elsewhere uh over at the other group. God bless. I I say we only have one time. And may God use every believer &gt;&gt; to get this message to live a life &gt;&gt; that is respectful &gt;&gt; to live a life &gt;&gt; that is an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it's possible. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Maybe maybe you felt, well, I've done the best that I can. Well, I pray that God will even give you a greater comprehension of what is yet possible. We're not here for ourselves. We're not here to just make life easy for ourselves. We're here to to further the kingdom of God. I'll say yes. Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, speak to our hearts. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. I'll say yes Lord. I'll say yes Lord. [Music] I'll say yes. [Music] That's the last song. Ask me not to see. Ask him to come near you. Ask him to come near you. Hear my humble cry. [Music] and one another are called to holy. Do not pass me by. [Music] Oh, save [Music] for him. [Music] and one other [Music] &gt;&gt; just so that the congregation here would know and understand. I want you to have the right attitude. I think that's so important. This message really spoke to me as God was giving it to me. We must have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning I had in my prayer I prayed for brother Lance and I prayed that God would mightily fill his mouth with words &gt;&gt; and speak exactly what the people need &gt;&gt; that are sitting there listening to him. And I believe that's absolutely necessary. That might come as a surprise to you, but that's not that's not just once in a while. I do that frequently. &gt;&gt; Friends, I tell you one thing for sure on the other side. &gt;&gt; There isn't going to be any different groups. We're going to sit at one table. And down here, we may have different groups and different churches and different kind of beliefs and different slants and different thoughts about things. And as I go, I just one one thing I always try to do is stay out of the politics of the local area. God knows those that are his. &gt;&gt; All that are mine, he said, &gt;&gt; will come. &gt;&gt; Why do we say that? Will come &gt;&gt; and no man can take them out of my hand. &gt;&gt; And this is I rest. This is my peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All that are mine. And on the other side, all that are his, &gt;&gt; we're going to be together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One group. &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Why don't we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; That's the absolute truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we pray and I pray for you. I pray that somehow you caught something today. We'll just sing it once more and I'll close in prayer. Saveior. [Music] Saveior. [Music] My Why [Music] do you not pass? [Music] Now, will you bow your heads with me as we come before his throne of grace? Our dear Lord Jesus, the one that is alive and present. You lived such a life. Lord, we cannot in ourselves attain to such a place. But I pray that you will impart to each one of us a portion. Lord, I believe that I'm speaking on behalf of the people. We hunger and we desire. We want to live exactly as you'd have us to live, Lord. We want to be what you'd want us to be. We want to say what you'd want us to say. We want to have the kind of attitude and character that you want us to have. Father, I pray you'll forgive us our faults. Forgive us our failures. But above all things, oh God, help us not to look back. Help us to be as Apostle Paul said, forgetting those things which are behind and pressing forward towards the prize of the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. I pray Lord, as I've asked this morning in prayer, you'll inspire this congregation. Inspire those that are listening on the internet. Inspire all that will hear this word. Oh God, as you've spoken to my own heart, may you go on with the Holy Spirit and speak to the people long after they've left this building. And those that are in a state of decision making, I pray, oh God, they will cast their decision &gt;&gt; in the right direction, casting it, your will be done. Lord, I pray you'll quicken us and ask you to bless this day and make it a blessing. And let your word be in our thoughts, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. I ask you to dismiss us from this building but not from your presence. Go with us, Lord. I pray in the cars, in the homes. Lord Jesus, would you would you please draw near that there'll just be a an immediate realization. There's another presence here. There's another person. You're wooing. You're calling. You're brooding over our lives, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, let this congregation of people, let us continue to be a voice, oh Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; wounded &gt;&gt; for our transgressions. And now we want to be a voice. Oh God, a true voice, &gt;&gt; a dedicated voice. &gt;&gt; Let our actions speak. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let the people around. Let somebody this week be moved &gt;&gt; by our lives. I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dismiss us now, Jesus. In your name, thank you for the patience of the people. We ask your blessings on them. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You've been a kind, attentive congregation. I sure appreciate it. God bless you. like you just dismiss reverently if you would rather than shaking hands here. You just go out and when you go out then you can greet the people and shake hands but just remain rather uh quietly and you you you're dismissed now to leave. God bless you in Jesus name.
