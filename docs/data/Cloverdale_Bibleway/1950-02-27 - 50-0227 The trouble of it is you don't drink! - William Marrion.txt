AMOS 3:7

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
every person in a measure that's got the Holy Spirit has the gift of healing in a measure every Apple that's in the tree is in the tree when it's a sprig no more than that when it's a little bitty Branch set in the ground every Bloom that'll ever be in the trees in it right then the blooms don't come down out of the air the bloom don't come up through the ground the Bloom's already in the tree the Apple's already in it the trees planted in the ground and the only thing it has to do is drink and when it goes to drinking it has to drink more and it's potion and it spreads out pushes out and that's the way we are planted in Christ Jesus to the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and we start drinking and the more we drink we just push out that's right it brings out these elements and the gift that God's called you to well just the trouble of it is you don't drink that's right
