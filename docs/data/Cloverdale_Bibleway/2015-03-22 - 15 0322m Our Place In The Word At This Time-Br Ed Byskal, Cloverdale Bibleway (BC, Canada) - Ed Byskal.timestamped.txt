[18:22] could,
[18:25] how many has a need this morning?
[18:30] If you had all the money in the world

[18:33] doctors,
[18:35] they couldn't do what the position that
[18:37] we're going to sing about in a moment
[18:38] can do. Hallelujah.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; So, we want to stretch forth and
[18:44] take a hold of the policy that he's
[18:45] given us that says whatever we ask,
[18:49] whatever we ask, we can have it.
[18:52] The great
[18:54] position
[18:56] now
[18:58] is near.
[19:00] The sinizing
[19:05] Jesus.
[19:08] He speaks
[19:10] the
[19:13] heart to cheer.
[19:16] Oh, hear the voice
[19:20] of Jes.
[19:23] Verse two, your many
[19:27] sins
[19:29] are now
[19:30] forgiven.
[19:32] Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.
[19:40] Go on your way
[19:45] in peacees to heaven and where
[19:50] the crown
[19:53] is Jesus.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, that's how we come this
[19:58] morning. Lord, asking that you'd forgive
[20:01] any sin, oh God. Forgive us of our
[20:04] trespasses, Lord, as we forgive those
[20:07] who trespass against us. Lord, you've
[20:10] taught us how to pray. You've taught us
[20:12] how to approach you. We want to say,
[20:15] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[20:18] Almighty."
[20:20] Lord, we approach you. The only one that
[20:22] can mend anything that's broken in our
[20:26] lives. Truly, the only one that can heal
[20:28] our afflicted bodies. The only one that
[20:30] can take us across safely to the other
[20:33] side. Lord, when we come to that river,
[20:36] we want to know, Lord, when we stretch
[20:38] forth our hand, that it's your hand that
[20:40] is stretching forth to receive us. Lord,
[20:43] we don't want to go blindly. We don't
[20:45] want to go arbitrarily, but we want to
[20:47] go with faith, believing that there's a
[20:49] resurrection. There's a rapture that's
[20:52] coming upon the earth that will catch
[20:54] your waiting bride away. Lord, our
[20:57] hearts are in great expectation. Even as
[21:00] the day approaches, we see the signs
[21:03] upon the earth. We see the signs in your
[21:05] word. Your word has been fulfilled.
[21:07] You've sent a prophet messenger in this
[21:10] day, Lord, to alert us, to bring
[21:13] attention to your word.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to sit attentive this
[21:17] morning as you would minister to us once
[21:20] again.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask now for this offering that
[21:24] it would be received, Lord, and used to
[21:27] its intended purpose to further the
[21:29] gospel of Jesus Christ. We commit it to
[21:32] you this morning. Each and everyone
[21:34] that's gathered in your divine presence,
[21:36] we commit to you in Jesus Christ's name.
[21:39] Amen.
[21:41] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[21:43] seats this morning.
[21:45] [Music]
[21:47] Sister Elena and Sister Elizabeth,
[21:49] Brother Ryan have a special.
[21:52] I feel bad kind of pulling on Ryan to
[21:54] ask him to sing, but we appreciate it.
[21:56] Brother Ryan,
[22:00] maybe we can just sing a verse and
[22:02] chorus to the old rugged cross.
[22:07] God's grace is sufficient for us. Amen.
[22:15] On a hill
[22:17] far away,
[22:19] there stood an old
[22:22] rugged cross.
[22:25] It's the emblem
[22:28] of suffering
[22:30] and shame.
[22:35] And I love that old cross. Oh, where the
[22:40] dearest
[22:43] and best
[22:45] for a world of lost s.
[22:54] So I cherish
[22:57] the old
[22:59] cross
[23:03] till my soul.
[23:06] At last night
[23:11] I will cling
[23:13] I will sing
[23:15] to the old rugged
[23:18] cross
[23:19] [Music]
[23:22] and exchange it a faith for a crown
[23:31] in the old
[23:35] cross
[23:37] with love
[23:38] so divine.
[23:41] It's so wonder
[23:46] I see.
[23:50] Lord was all
[23:54] that Jesus
[23:58] and died.
[24:00] to pardon
[24:02] and sanctify
[24:05] me.
[24:08] Oh my
[24:12] god.
[24:26] There I will sing

[25:37] at me.

[25:57] Then I come into

[26:03] [Music]
[26:05] and all my questions become clear.

[27:50] in the hours of distress.

[32:15] [Music]
[32:28] Amen.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[32:32] While we have you standing, uh, I want
[32:35] to,
[32:37] uh, make mention, some of you may know,
[32:40] but our brother Neil Neil Gunther from
[32:43] Saskatchewan, pastor, passed away this
[32:46] morning, 91 years old. Truly, one of the
[32:50] soldiers.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; And uh, we're going to have uh, we're
[32:54] going to have prayer about hearts are
[32:56] mended.
[32:57] Uh some hearts have to be mended, but
[33:00] we're rejoicing. The last song that our
[33:03] brother uh brother Derek had you sing
[33:06] was uh will exchange the cross for a
[33:10] crown. He exchanged it.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; He exchanged it this morning. About 517.
[33:16] He passed away this morning. Uh uh
[33:19] brother uh brother Nathan Hildebrand,
[33:22] I'm going to have you come down if you
[33:24] wouldn't mind and we're going to have
[33:26] prayer in a few moments. Brother Nathan,
[33:28] I asked I want to have him come down
[33:31] because he was a young person in the
[33:34] church when brother Gunther was
[33:37] pastoring and uh we were there many
[33:40] times. You know, there's a supernatural
[33:44] realm we want to be conscious of. Amen.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Uh
[33:49] it's just a supernatural realm. Friends,
[33:53] let's not be here just for a Sunday
[33:55] morning service, but be mindful of the
[33:58] supernatural realm that's so very, very
[34:00] close.
[34:01] Uh
[34:03] brother
[34:04] Kelly Hilderbrand,
[34:07] is he related to you somehow? Yeah,
[34:09] they're all related.
[34:12] And uh brother Kelly Helerbrand became
[34:16] pastor of the church that brother
[34:18] Gunther had pastored previously.
[34:22] And so he invited brother
[34:25] uh Ron Spencer to come and speak.
[34:29] And brother Ron Spencer had an accident
[34:32] and was in the flames of fire and had
[34:35] his lungs largely burnt out and was
[34:38] laying unconscious in the hospital. So,
[34:42] Brother Kelly Hildibbran asked if
[34:44] brother Tom Ray could come and and fill
[34:48] in and take the services. So, Brother
[34:51] Tom and Joanne went over there. And I
[34:54] don't think I'm speaking out of line. Uh
[34:59] and and while Joanne is in the church
[35:02] sitting in the pew, God speaks to her
[35:05] about her son Joel who's here and and
[35:11] and he's he's not serving God. He's from
[35:14] God. And God speaks a scripture to her,
[35:18] chastise thy son. And she knew that she
[35:22] must correct him and went home with that
[35:25] on her heart. In the meantime,
[35:28] not the same day or the even the same
[35:31] weekend, but right at that same time,
[35:33] Saturday morning on a Saturday morning,
[35:37] I'm preparing uh the service to come and
[35:39] preach here. And while I am preparing
[35:43] and I'm looking at my screen, the tele
[35:46] over and I'm studying and it just come
[35:50] to me. The Holy Spirit just said, "Phone
[35:53] Connie, Sister Spencer." And I I
[35:58] immediately my mind said, "Well, she's
[35:59] not home cuz her husband's unconscious
[36:02] in the hospital." And nevertheless, it
[36:05] was just like I was under a power. And I
[36:07] just turned sideways and I started to
[36:09] dial. And while I'm dialing the phone,
[36:12] here's where you get the separation
[36:14] between the the mind of God and the Holy
[36:18] Spirit in your spirit. My mind is saying
[36:21] she's not home even while I'm dialing.
[36:24] She's not home. And my mind is agreeing
[36:26] with me. I said, "No, she's not home."
[36:30] And I still keep dialing because I
[36:32] couldn't do anything else. I kept
[36:33] dialing and I'm saying to myself, "No,
[36:35] she's not home. This is this is futile.
[36:38] There's not going to be any answer." And
[36:40] I had looked up the phone number and the
[36:41] only phone number I had was their home.
[36:44] And I'm dialing and said, "She's not
[36:46] home." And I'm saying, "No, she's not
[36:48] home." And uh the phone just rings maybe
[36:51] once or twice and she answers the phone
[36:54] and I just say to her just like this. I
[36:57] said, "Connie,
[36:59] where are you?" And she says, "Well,
[37:02] Brother Biscll, I'm just between
[37:04] hospitals. I just left my son." I didn't
[37:08] have any idea. I knew nothing about
[37:09] wasn't thinking about our son, Jason. He
[37:12] was in one hospital and brother Ron was
[37:15] in another.
[37:18] and she said, "I'm just between
[37:19] hospitals
[37:21] and uh I left Jason. I'm just on my way
[37:24] to see Ron."
[37:26] And I knew I knew Brother Ron's
[37:29] condition. I said, "Sister Connie, we've
[37:32] just bought a camp,
[37:34] Mount Baker camp." And I said,
[37:39] I understand from the medical people
[37:42] that the last of the human senses that
[37:45] leave the body is the hearing.
[37:48] I said, I want you to go beside Ron's
[37:51] bed and get down and and speak in his
[37:54] ear and tell him that I, Brother Biscll,
[37:58] has called and that he's going to be the
[38:01] preacher at camp next year. Amen.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; And she said, "I'll do that, Brother
[38:07] Biscll." And Brother Ron Spencer was the
[38:10] speaker at the camp the next year.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:16] Listen, friends, there's a there's
[38:18] another realm. There's a whole another
[38:20] dimension.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm saying that because it kind
[38:24] of leads into my service. I want to
[38:27] remember brother
[38:29] Gunther's uh brother Gunther's son
[38:32] Milton is uh is is not well either with
[38:36] a he has a brain tumor and I don't know
[38:39] his condition as of this moment but
[38:42] brother
[38:43] brother Nathan I wonder if you would I'd
[38:45] like you to just if you wish to just say
[38:47] a word about being in his church but uh
[38:51] if you would have prayer for the family
[38:54] the extended family and all the saints
[38:57] that are affected in Saskatchewan and
[39:00] elsewhere. Brother Gunther to me is one
[39:02] of the great heroes
[39:04] uh great heroes of the faith. He just
[39:06] remembered remained absolutely
[39:09] steadfast. Can I tell you one more?
[39:12] &gt;&gt; I was to speak at brother Gunther's
[39:15] church in Edmonton and at brother's
[39:17] church in Saskatchewan and we had the
[39:20] radio broadcast on. They It's not my
[39:23] broadcast. It's not it's not this
[39:25] church's broadcast. It's broadcasting
[39:27] the messengergers's message.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Whose word is that?
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Not my word. It's God's word.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; And so,
[39:38] you know, Brother Roger, God bless him,
[39:41] he he just walked in just before I left
[39:44] and he said, "We're we got our invoice
[39:47] to pay for the radio time. We're on
[39:49] about 25 stations." He said, 'We haven't
[39:52] got the money to pay for it. And I said,
[39:54] 'Well, that's the first time ever and
[39:57] once. It only happened once, and that's
[39:59] the time it happened. He said, well,
[40:02] we're short about I said, how much are
[40:04] we short? He said, about $5,000. That's
[40:07] a lot of money back then. A lot of money
[40:09] yet. And I said, well, wait till I get
[40:13] back. We won't do anything till I get
[40:15] back. And uh I went up to Edmonton,
[40:19] spoke at brother Harold Hildebrand's
[40:21] went over to brother Gunther's and I was
[40:24] uh I was with brother and sister Gunther
[40:26] and went to the church and he always
[40:28] goes early and I'm sitting down in his
[40:31] little office and we sat there for just
[40:33] a few minutes. He said, "I'll just go to
[40:35] the pulpit." I said, "Okay." And he left
[40:38] and went out the door. of the pulpit was
[40:40] right beside the little office and he
[40:43] just was out for maybe uh one minute and
[40:47] I was just uh at turned to my Bible and
[40:50] was at the little desk and he came back
[40:52] in
[40:54] an envelope
[40:56] uh a long envelope like this and he said
[40:59] a brother here and he gave his name he
[41:01] said he just gave this to me to give to
[41:04] you and I said oh okay he said do you
[41:06] know this brother and I said I'm trying
[41:08] to think of who he was and I said, "I
[41:10] think he does he he said he sits right
[41:12] down in the front." I said, "Oh, yes."
[41:14] Yeah. I said, "I I just know him to see
[41:16] him."
[41:18] And so I put it in my pocket and I
[41:20] thought I didn't want to have anything
[41:22] disturb me and I'm just going to give
[41:24] myself to the word. And so while I was
[41:26] thinking, I thought it might be a
[41:28] request. And so I slipped it out of my
[41:30] pocket and just tore it open and and and
[41:33] just pulled it out as a check. says on
[41:36] the bottom for radio $5,000.
[41:41] [Music]
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Hearts are mended.
[41:46] Burdens are carried. You believe it?
[41:50] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; I want believing hearts here today.

[41:56] prayer, would you?
[41:59] We're happy to have our brother Eric and
[42:01] Sister Diane Kourtney here. That is
[42:04] Rebecca Ray's mother and dad. God bless
[42:08] you, brother Eric, sister. And and uh
[42:12] also we want to remember brother Jean
[42:15] Chimpaka. He's in Burkino Faso and they
[42:19] set up just this last week set up the
[42:21] first
[42:23] print station for the from the hub and
[42:27] instructed the brothers and some other
[42:29] visiting ministers and they preached and
[42:32] they printed the first prophet's message
[42:35] as I was with Moses.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We can't maybe run down the
[42:43] shopping center and say, "Praise the
[42:45] Lord." But we can hear praise the Lord.
[42:48] Brother Murphy's up there. Isn't it
[42:51] wonderful? He's back. Praise the Lord.
[42:58] Amen. Amen.
[43:00] [Applause]
[43:02] We'll just ask prayer.
[43:08] Let's just pray together. Lord Jesus,
[43:13] [Music]
[43:16] &gt;&gt; we're so thankful, Lord, that you are
[43:18] faithful to the end
[43:24] &gt;&gt; and that you carried our burdens,
[43:28] &gt;&gt; to Calvary.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; You laid your life down willingly as a
[43:36] &gt;&gt; as a lamb.
[43:39] They didn't have to throw you down onto
[43:41] the cross, but you laid yourself down,
[43:44] stretched out your hands
[43:50] [Music]
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Lord. So
[44:10] You gave your life so we could live.
[44:14] [Music]
[44:16] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful this morning that
[44:20] &gt;&gt; brother Gunther is
[44:23] live so faithful to your word.
[44:27] Hallelujah.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; And as I heard the prophet this week
[44:31] speak of his mother when she was passing
[44:33] and he stood at her bedside,
[44:36] &gt;&gt; she said, "Bill,
[44:39] &gt;&gt; this is when it pays off."
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; I've stayed true.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; You led me to the waters of baptism and
[44:49] I've stayed true to that word.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; And here's where it pays off.
[44:55] [Applause]
[44:56] [Music]
[44:57] I'm so thankful, oh Lord Jesus, that
[45:00] brother Gunther
[45:02] recognized this day and its message.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; And he stood for you, Lord.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; He preached your word, oh God,
[45:11] &gt;&gt; he did what he could, Father.
[45:14] And now when he come to the river, oh
[45:16] God,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; you helped him across and he's over on
[45:20] the other side.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing with his wife who has gone
[45:25] before.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing with saints that have gone
[45:30] before. Lord,
[45:32] &gt;&gt; in the eternal youth, Lord,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; in the place that you have prepared for
[45:37] him, oh God,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; we rejoice in that this morning, Lord.
[45:43] And if he could if he could speak back
[45:46] to us, he would say, "Don't let anything
[45:49] come in between you and the Savior.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Stay true. Stay steadfast. Endure to the
[45:56] end."
[45:58] &gt;&gt; So we that remain, oh God, we endure.
[46:01] [Music]
[46:02] &gt;&gt; We press on, Lord.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; We spread your word, Father.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[46:11] We love you, Father.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; We love your precious word.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; We love your presence, oh God.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Be with those, Lord. Be with our brother
[46:23] Milton. Father, Brother Gunther's son,
[46:25] Lord, you know his need, Father.
[46:28] Oh Lord Jesus, touch him now, oh God, I
[46:32] pray, heal him, Lord Jesus, and raise
[46:35] him up off the bed of affliction,
[46:37] Father.
[46:39] Oh, be merciful, oh God.
[46:43] Bless the family, Lord. Bless the church
[46:45] over there, oh God.
[46:48] Strengthen everyone, Father. Encourage
[46:50] them, Lord.
[46:52] We lift them up, Lord, as brothers and
[46:54] sisters of like precious faith. Oh God,
[46:58] we lift them up into your presence by
[47:00] prayer this morning, oh God, and pray
[47:02] that you would pour in grace, Lord.
[47:06] Be with us here this morning, Father.
[47:10] Bless our brother, Lord, our brother
[47:12] Episcopal as he would break to us the
[47:14] bread of life. Father,
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, anoint him.
[47:21] Anoint our ears to hear, our hearts to
[47:23] receive, oh God.
[47:26] We focus our attention now on what you
[47:28] have to say to us, oh God.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we have come to hear from
[47:34] you, Father. We have come to feast at
[47:37] your table, to feed upon your word, oh
[47:40] God, to be energized by your Holy
[47:43] Spirit, Lord, to be quickened by your
[47:46] presence, oh God, to be filled with your
[47:49] Holy Spirit, Lord, to be filled with
[47:51] revelation, oh God.
[47:54] You alone are what we need, Father. And
[47:57] we come to you the great fountain of
[47:59] life, oh God,
[48:01] to draw from you, Lord. There's many
[48:04] needs here to this morning, Lord.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; You are the supplier of all of our
[48:09] needs, Lord. And let your word go forth
[48:11] and heal your people this morning.
[48:13] Father, speak to us, we pray, oh God.
[48:19] Have your precious way, oh Lord Jesus.
[48:21] We ask this in the precious name of
[48:23] Jesus Christ.
[48:25] And we give you all the glory and the
[48:27] honor and the praise, Lord. And we bless
[48:29] your holy name. in Jesus name I pray.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] [Music]
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, nice to see you. Missed
[48:53] you and sister Yolena.
[48:55] And just happy to have you back.
[49:00] Amen. That'll be all for the singing and
[49:02] music. Now,
[49:05] you're not too weary.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Take your Bibles
[49:09] and we'll turn to Acts the 1st chapter.
[49:21] We want to also be remembering the
[49:24] brother Kim Dingwal and uh and those
[49:27] that are with him and the whole busload
[49:29] of young people making their way on down
[49:33] to Louisiana. Eventually, he'll end up
[49:36] there and brother John Andy's will be
[49:38] down there speaking the youth convention
[49:41] and uh they they seek to be a blessing
[49:44] and maybe help out in the church. So, we
[49:46] pray that God protect and guide them,
[49:49] keep them. I I did get a text from
[49:51] brother
[49:53] uh Kim, and he said that they're having
[49:55] fellowship and worshiping all along the
[49:57] way.
[49:59] Amen.
[50:01] Acts the first chapter. I'm going to
[50:03] begin reading at the fourth verse.
[50:07] And you'll have to if if you wish to
[50:11] pray, pray for yourself and pray that
[50:13] God will give you personal understanding
[50:17] because I'm speaking something that's
[50:19] very very difficult to uh for us as
[50:24] humans to
[50:27] look beyond our you know we have tunnel
[50:29] vision inherent tunnel vision and we
[50:33] need to look beyond our little world and
[50:36] beyond ond our conditions
[50:39] &gt;&gt; and which we are so affected and
[50:41] afflicted and plagued by.
[50:45] Uh so I'm praying that God will help me
[50:48] and help you to uh to follow what God
[50:55] speaks in the scripture. Help us.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Fourth verse. and being assembled
[51:02] together with them, commanded them that
[51:05] they should not depart, Jesus is
[51:08] speaking now, from Jerusalem, but wait
[51:11] for the promise of the father, which
[51:12] saith he, you have heard of me.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; And we want to be remember now for all
[51:18] of you that may not know the
[51:20] resurrection has just taken place. And
[51:23] this between the resurrection and
[51:25] Pentecost
[51:26] and so that you don't put yourself
[51:29] there. The resurrection just happened.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; They've just received the Lord Jesus
[51:33] Christ raised from the dead after all
[51:35] the suffering in his passion.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And uh for John, he said, truly baptized
[51:40] with water, but you shall be baptized
[51:43] with the Holy Ghost, not many days
[51:46] hence. When they therefore were come
[51:49] together, they asked of him, saying,
[51:52] Lord, wilt thou at this time restore
[51:55] again the kingdom to Israel? And he said
[51:58] unto them, it is not for you to know the
[52:00] times or the seasons which the Father
[52:03] hath put in his own power. But you shall
[52:06] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[52:08] has come upon you, and you shall be
[52:11] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[52:15] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[52:20] uttermost part of the earth. God bless
[52:23] this word of your heart. And thank you
[52:24] for standing. You may be seated.
[52:37] My thought is
[52:40] uh right here in the content of the
[52:42] scripture and then I'm going to give
[52:44] several other examples as we go on.
[52:50] Uh
[52:53] their concern was,
[52:55] "Will you at this time restore the
[52:57] king?" Now, he just raised from the
[52:59] dead. They seeing resurrected life right
[53:02] in front of them. "Will you at this time
[53:04] restore the kingdom to Israel? Their
[53:07] their concern was local. Their concern
[53:10] was with their problem. We've been under
[53:13] this Roman hand. Oh, will you at this
[53:16] time shake it off and are you going to
[53:19] restore it back in our old glory and
[53:22] we're going to have Israel restored back
[53:24] and have our nation back again? Is this
[53:27] the time? Because nothing seeming could
[53:30] stop or hinder someone that could walk
[53:33] walk out of a sephilar.
[53:35] And he said, "It's not for you to know
[53:39] the times of the seasons that the father
[53:41] hath put in his own hand, in his own
[53:44] power, but you shall receive power.
[53:48] After that, the Holy Ghost has come upon
[53:50] you, and you shall be witnesses unto me
[53:53] in Jerusalem
[53:55] locally
[53:58] and in all Judea
[54:01] and the far regions,
[54:05] &gt;&gt; maybe Seattle and Victoria and down
[54:08] Louisiana and who knows and Texas or
[54:10] whatever more.
[54:12] and in Samaria and unto the uttermost
[54:15] part of the earth. And the uttermost
[54:18] part of the earth is can be the last
[54:21] state or the last end.
[54:24] The not necessarily the furthest point,
[54:26] but the extreme, the last in time or the
[54:30] last in place you'll receive. And and
[54:33] we're a long ways down the road. We're a
[54:36] long ways down the road. And Jesus is
[54:39] speaking about us and saying, "But you
[54:42] shall receive power and you be witnesses
[54:45] unto me locally, but beyond that in
[54:48] Judea, all of Judea and in Samaria,
[54:52] where he had told them earlier, don't go
[54:55] and and and to the uttermost part of the
[54:57] earth, right to the very extreme end of
[54:59] all things, but you'll be witnesses unto
[55:02] me."
[55:03] Glory.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Some will go to Jerusalem and some will
[55:08] go to Judea. This is not a missionary
[55:11] service.
[55:13] Jesus is not saying some of you'll be
[55:14] missionaries and some of you'll be
[55:16] pastors and some of you will be whatever
[55:18] evangelists.
[55:20] And this is not a competition of who
[55:22] gets
[55:24] to the most remote place on earth.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; It's not some kind of competition.
[55:30] This is where the Holy Ghost will take
[55:33] the message to the ends of the earth
[55:36] through the zeal of God in the bride
[55:39] body of Jesus Christ.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; In other words, whatever they become
[55:43] infused with, you'll become infused
[55:45] with.
[55:47] There's no limitation and there's no uh
[55:51] the the the strength of and the potency
[55:55] of the words of Jesus Christ do not
[55:57] diminish as time goes on.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Sometime we may say something but it it
[56:02] kind of fritters away and dwindles away.
[56:05] It doesn't dwindle away.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; You shall receive power
[56:09] &gt;&gt; after that. The Holy Ghost has come upon
[56:11] you and it shall come upon you and you
[56:13] shall be witnesses unto me. You'll be
[56:16] witnesses unto me. Didn't say you will
[56:19] all go to church and you'll all
[56:20] fellowship and you'll sing songs and
[56:22] you'll do these things, but you'll be
[56:24] witnesses unto me.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, how? I'm not a
[56:29] preacher. I'm not this." That has
[56:30] nothing to do with it. He didn't say
[56:32] you'll become preachers and you'll
[56:33] become witnesses. You'll become
[56:35] witnesses
[56:36] &gt;&gt; unto me. Your life will witness.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:41] And there's very much
[56:44] uh it's very very human as I said just
[56:48] in the opening phrase to have tunnel
[56:50] vision
[56:51] &gt;&gt; because
[56:53] we see those of our
[56:56] uh family
[56:58] and those of our church
[57:02] and those of our you know my friends,
[57:06] my associates,
[57:09] &gt;&gt; uh those that mean something to me
[57:12] those that maybe are of the same
[57:14] culture.
[57:16] This has nothing to do with it.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Are these that speak the same language
[57:22] &gt;&gt; or somehow, you know, we have some
[57:25] connection. This hasn't got anything
[57:27] about connection. This has this has to
[57:29] do with you believing on Christ. You
[57:33] shall be baptized. You shall be filled
[57:36] with the Holy Ghost. That's God's doing.
[57:39] That's not well I want to feel
[57:41] something. Has nothing to do with what
[57:42] you want to feel. You shall be filled
[57:44] with the Holy Ghost and you shall be a
[57:47] witness. Well, some may be demonstrative
[57:49] and some may not be demonstrative. Some
[57:52] may be loud and some may be quiet and
[57:55] some may be something else. Something
[57:58] may some may be withdrawn. Some may have
[58:01] some complexes and some may be, you
[58:04] know, bulldog faith or something.
[58:07] whatever it has nothing to do with that.
[58:09] It has to do with you shall be filled
[58:12] with the Holy Ghost and you shall be
[58:14] witnesses. Well, you might say, "Well, I
[58:17] don't know how." Well, how will I be w
[58:19] That's not your problem.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Your problem is you believe and he does
[58:25] the work. He will make you to be
[58:28] witnesses.
[58:29] Something in your life will witness. You
[58:32] might say, "Well, I don't see the effect
[58:34] of it." That isn't what that isn't in
[58:36] the that isn't in the in in the recipe
[58:40] here. You shall be witnesses.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Now, there's one one one thing that is
[58:46] essential is to see beyond Jerusalem
[58:50] &gt;&gt; and to see beyond all of Judea
[58:53] &gt;&gt; and to see beyond
[58:55] Samaria
[58:56] &gt;&gt; and to see even to the uttermost part of
[58:59] the earth. And this calls for something
[59:02] that is very difficult for us as humans
[59:05] to do and that is to lift up our eyes.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And uh I was very very
[59:14] affected this morning because when I
[59:16] heard that brother Gunther had passed
[59:17] away,
[59:19] I spoke I'm trying to remember and I'll
[59:22] have to go back and refresh my memory
[59:24] whether I spoke Sister Gunther's
[59:28] funeral. I did speak Sister Rosenkei's
[59:31] funeral who they're very dear friends. I
[59:34] spoke Sister Rosenkeis and one of those
[59:37] two services I spoke from dust to stars
[59:41] and I'm referring to the same scripture
[59:43] this morning.
[59:46] The first time I will come to it a
[59:48] little bit later but just to get you in
[59:49] the in the in the thought pattern. The
[59:53] first time
[59:55] uh Abram was is like you
[59:59] you know he had the concerns of life and
[1:00:02] and the prophet said he had to God spoke
[1:00:05] to him said leave your family leave your
[1:00:07] kindred and he's he he he's leaving he's
[1:00:10] trudging along like you would have to
[1:00:13] he's packing up and he's moving and he's
[1:00:16] got all the problems of uh of the
[1:00:19] logistics of camels or horses or donkeys
[1:00:22] or whatever it is, he's got to pack his
[1:00:25] stuff up
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; and he's leaving his comfort zone.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he's leaving his
[1:00:31] friends.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; He's leaving his family. That's not
[1:00:35] easy.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; You know, he he he's he's got the same
[1:00:40] feelings we would have. Leave them and
[1:00:42] to a place and go to a place I'll show
[1:00:44] you. And maybe his friends are saying,
[1:00:47] "Well, where are you going?" Well, I
[1:00:48] don't really know. Oh, wow. You know,
[1:00:52] you mean you're leaving your father and
[1:00:54] you're leaving all of this and you're
[1:00:56] going to a place and you don't even
[1:00:57] know? Well, God appeared to me and spoke
[1:01:00] to me. Yeah. You know how that would
[1:01:02] rate. You know how people would think
[1:01:05] about that.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; In fact, this when I came to move here
[1:01:09] to Cloverdale, I didn't know I was
[1:01:10] coming to Cloverdale. I just knew I was
[1:01:12] coming west and president of our company
[1:01:14] asked me what I was going to do. I said,
[1:01:17] "I I really don't know." and and his his
[1:01:22] respect for me just took a nose dive
[1:01:26] right there. I could see it in his face,
[1:01:28] see it in his eyes, see it in
[1:01:30] everything. And I would imagine Abram
[1:01:33] and that that wasn't the only thing.
[1:01:35] Then Abram,
[1:01:37] God told him, he said, he said, "I'm I'm
[1:01:40] going to I'm going to bless you and I'm
[1:01:43] going to bless the nations of the world
[1:01:45] because of you." Yeah.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; This one man doesn't even know where
[1:01:49] he's going. And God's telling him, "I'm
[1:01:51] going to bless you and I'm going to
[1:01:53] bless the nations of the world and and
[1:01:55] and uh I'm going to bless your seed
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; seed. I don't even have a child.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Bless my seed." And uh and so he he
[1:02:06] begins his journey and and God speaks to
[1:02:10] him at one time when they have he has a
[1:02:13] lot of trouble between him and Lot. his
[1:02:15] nephew is coming and between Lot's their
[1:02:19] herds increased
[1:02:21] and Lot's servants and Abram's servants
[1:02:25] they're having strife between themselves
[1:02:28] and it finally you know drifts down to
[1:02:31] the people that have to make the
[1:02:32] decision. And so it's between Lot and
[1:02:36] and now comes a very very difficult
[1:02:38] thing. So Abram says to Lot uh
[1:02:43] oh I don't know what to do. uh you know
[1:02:46] he doesn't say that but
[1:02:49] obviously he doesn't know what to do. So
[1:02:51] he says uh you you choose you whatever
[1:02:55] way you choose let's not have this
[1:02:57] strife. You choose you can see Abram's
[1:03:01] manner. You choose one direction I'll go
[1:03:04] the other direction. If you choose this
[1:03:07] right hand I'll go the left hand or
[1:03:09] whatever whatever you choose I'll go the
[1:03:12] opposite way. And Lot he sees the
[1:03:14] wellwatered plains of towards Sodom and
[1:03:18] so on so forth. So he he he said uh he'd
[1:03:21] take the well-watered plains and Abraham
[1:03:24] said, "Fine, I'll go the other
[1:03:25] direction." So now they've parted and
[1:03:28] they've just parted.
[1:03:31] Put it in your own life. Some of the
[1:03:34] most difficult times, some of the most
[1:03:35] painful times. And God spoke to him and
[1:03:38] said, "I'm going to bless you.
[1:03:42] And if you can count the sand
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; at the seashore,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; uh, so will your seed will be. So he has
[1:03:50] them. He's still looking down. You might
[1:03:52] think this is poetic. It's not very
[1:03:54] poetic because we are, we spend most of
[1:03:57] our time looking down.
[1:04:00] In fact is when you go into a department
[1:04:02] store, I used to paint signs
[1:04:05] and not professionally but just paint
[1:04:07] signs. And they said don't put the signs
[1:04:10] above eye level.
[1:04:12] Very few people look above their eye
[1:04:15] level.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And I've had people come in and look at
[1:04:19] a sign says, "Take 40% off." And they'll
[1:04:22] stare right at that sign. They say, "Uh,
[1:04:25] how much discount is this?"
[1:04:30] Uh,
[1:04:31] that sign says 40%.
[1:04:34] Take it off.
[1:04:39] But when you drive down the if you drive
[1:04:41] down the street, and some of you will do
[1:04:43] it this week, I'm sure you'll drive down
[1:04:45] the street and and don't have a wreck
[1:04:48] now. But just look above the windows of
[1:04:51] the of the of the of the stores above
[1:04:54] the windows. It's a whole new city up
[1:04:57] there cuz you've never looked up there.
[1:04:59] You'll see all the He said, "What a
[1:05:02] wretched place." No, it's always been
[1:05:05] that way. But you just never looked up
[1:05:07] there. You see all the window dressing
[1:05:09] and everything is fixed up here. Say,
[1:05:12] uh, now now how how does this relate to
[1:05:15] our spiritual life? The thing that wars
[1:05:18] against you spiritually is every little
[1:05:21] thing that happens that bugs you.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; It just bothers you. What bothers you?
[1:05:26] Oh, it's this and that and something
[1:05:28] else here and you know what I mean? It's
[1:05:30] all this local stuff around here and
[1:05:33] it's all these things. And so the second
[1:05:35] time God speaks to Abram, he speaks to
[1:05:38] him again way further down. And and
[1:05:41] Abram has just finished saying, "What
[1:05:44] will you give me?"
[1:05:48] Doesn't that sound familiar?
[1:05:50] I need this and I need that. What will
[1:05:53] you give me? I don't have a son. I don't
[1:05:56] have an heir. The only one I have here
[1:05:59] is is this uh Syrian from Damascus,
[1:06:03] Eleazar. He's the only one as I have as
[1:06:06] a heir. That's a big problem. God's
[1:06:09] already given him. And he says, he says,
[1:06:11] "This will not be your heir. I will give
[1:06:14] you an heir and it'll come out of your
[1:06:17] own lines.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; It's going to be your son." God preaches
[1:06:21] him a sermon. Yeah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And I looked at it last night and the
[1:06:25] sermon takes just a few minutes. It's a
[1:06:28] whole lot shorter than my sermon this
[1:06:29] morning. But God, I thought, "What a
[1:06:32] wonderful preacher.
[1:06:34] What a wonderful preacher." I'm going to
[1:06:36] tell you the same thing I told you years
[1:06:38] ago, about 22 years ago. It hasn't
[1:06:42] changed. I'm going to tell you the same
[1:06:44] story. You're gonna have a son. You're
[1:06:48] gonna have seed. And it says, "And he
[1:06:51] believed God and was counted to him for
[1:06:54] righteousness."
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; But it just goes to show the human
[1:07:04] nature and I'm going to dwell on that.
[1:07:07] And and you happen to have it. You're
[1:07:10] sitting here listening to me. But you
[1:07:13] and I have the same and I had a hard
[1:07:15] time with this service. I thought
[1:07:18] I can't hardly do that myself. I'm pro
[1:07:22] I'm plagued every day with the daily
[1:07:26] things and the pressures of life and I
[1:07:29] can't and and God is speaking to my own
[1:07:32] heart saying well I want you to lift up
[1:07:36] your eyes. And the second time, God
[1:07:38] spoke to him and said, "Now,
[1:07:42] lift up your eyes," he said to Abram,
[1:07:44] "and look to the stars
[1:07:48] and see if you can count them."
[1:07:52] And that's the way your seed's going to
[1:07:53] be.
[1:07:55] And that is the most impossible thing.
[1:07:57] Hasn't even had a child yet. And he
[1:07:59] says, "And he believed God."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And God blessed him.
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:06] We're called on to believe things that
[1:08:08] are so outrageous
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and so phenomenal
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; and so unbelievable
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; that these bodies as as corrupt as they
[1:08:17] are are going to be changed.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; That these bodies and this nature is
[1:08:22] going to be transformed.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; But there's something that we have to
[1:08:25] do. You have to believe that. Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; We have to believe that. You're called
[1:08:29] on to believe that.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He He didn't point out his weaknesses to
[1:08:33] him. Abraham, you uh you know, you're
[1:08:36] told something that wasn't really quite
[1:08:38] right back there. And for that, you
[1:08:41] know, I'm going to do this and I'm going
[1:08:42] to do that and you're you're going to
[1:08:45] get less. That isn't the point. He never
[1:08:48] pointed that out to him.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; He never preached to him about his
[1:08:54] failings. He never preached to him about
[1:08:56] his weaknesses.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; He preached to him about what he had
[1:09:00] said had.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; This is what this says
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; and this is what he means
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; and this is the way it's going to be.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; You know, and and there similarities.
[1:09:14] Now, I want to just show you
[1:09:17] similarities.
[1:09:19] And excuse me while I lay all this long
[1:09:21] foundation but
[1:09:24] in the life of Jesus and the ministry
[1:09:26] and I want to speak about his first and
[1:09:28] his second ministry because the ministry
[1:09:32] that we talk about brother Brown's
[1:09:33] ministry is a ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; working and revealing himself in him.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] And when Jesus in his first in his first
[1:09:44] visitation here on earth, when he when
[1:09:48] he commences his ministry, he's talking
[1:09:51] about social things,
[1:09:53] you know, life
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and how they should live in the sermon
[1:09:58] on the mount and you read it and you
[1:10:01] say, well, and and he teaches about how
[1:10:04] we should conduct ourselves and how we
[1:10:07] should live and all of those social
[1:10:09] things. But then when he when he goes
[1:10:12] further on in his ministry, he starts he
[1:10:16] starts
[1:10:17] uh instructing the people to look beyond
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:24] and uh you've got to lift up your eyes
[1:10:27] and he starts talking about him
[1:10:30] suffering and raising again from the
[1:10:33] dead. They didn't have any idea what he
[1:10:36] was talking about. Right.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible even says that after it
[1:10:40] happened, then they remembered what he'd
[1:10:42] said.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; It's almost, you'd think it might be too
[1:10:46] late, but no. God's got everything in
[1:10:48] time.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; I hope that you're understanding what
[1:10:51] I'm saying. So, he's trying to get them
[1:10:53] to look beyond look beyond this. Look
[1:10:56] beyond Jerusalem. Look beyond your own
[1:10:58] house. Look beyond your own life. Look
[1:11:01] beyond your own friends. Look beyond
[1:11:04] your own church. Look beyond your own
[1:11:06] culture. Look beyond beyond the things
[1:11:09] that's happening. Look beyond your own
[1:11:11] government. Look beyond your own city.
[1:11:14] Look beyond that.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; In fact is I'm going to load one on you
[1:11:20] that I don't think you can do and I
[1:11:22] don't think I can do. And that is that
[1:11:24] we need to be able to look at one
[1:11:26] another who are bloodbought and see them
[1:11:29] as stars. Yes.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; They say they got stars in Hollywood.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; I tell you, they got the worst
[1:11:37] renegades.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even You wouldn't even want
[1:11:40] them as your neighbor.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; They're not stars.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; If they are, they're fallen stars.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm not here to preach about that.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about that. But I'm
[1:11:54] talking about true stars.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet talks about stars. He
[1:11:59] said, "Mother's up there."
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be something if God had a
[1:12:03] star that identifies you?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; How would it be? How how how can h how
[1:12:11] can we look at one another? And the
[1:12:15] reason I'm saying this, you might say,
[1:12:17] "Well,
[1:12:19] that would be nice if we could do that."
[1:12:20] That's not the point. I really believe
[1:12:23] it's a requirement before the rapture.
[1:12:27] Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; How can the foot say to the hand or the
[1:12:32] hand say to the foot, "I have no need of
[1:12:34] you."
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; How can one part of the body say to the
[1:12:38] other part, "I have no need of you."
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; And what if the other part of the body
[1:12:42] could be husband or wife, it could be
[1:12:45] children, it could be young people, it
[1:12:47] could be parents, it could be ministry,
[1:12:49] it could be deacons, it could be someone
[1:12:52] else. I I I wonder if we just have
[1:12:54] enough uh h enough esteem, not respect,
[1:13:00] esteem
[1:13:03] to to see the glory of say, well, you
[1:13:06] look at stars. This may sound so poetic,
[1:13:11] but it's far beyond that
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; that we could see one another as they
[1:13:19] truly are.
[1:13:21] Is there anything wrong with me
[1:13:23] preaching today that we should look upon
[1:13:25] one another as God looks upon you're my
[1:13:28] father, oh father in heaven, and so on
[1:13:31] and so forth. And maybe he's saying, why
[1:13:34] don't you look upon your neighbor or
[1:13:36] look upon your brother or look upon
[1:13:40] the one that's sitting beside you. Look
[1:13:42] upon members of your family like I see
[1:13:45] them.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Would there be anything wrong with that?
[1:13:48] No.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Would there anything wrong with me
[1:13:50] preaching that we should look upon one
[1:13:51] another as God looks upon them?
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't really stand that
[1:13:58] person. I don't have anything in common
[1:14:00] with them." And God is saying, God is
[1:14:02] saying just in the other dimension,
[1:14:04] "That's my daughter."
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; You're saying, "I can't stand them." And
[1:14:09] God's saying, "That's my son."
[1:14:11] That's right.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I love you and I give
[1:14:16] myself for you. And and we stand on this
[1:14:19] side of the veil and say, I just can't
[1:14:21] stand that person.
[1:14:25] We don't have anything in common.
[1:14:28] They kind of rip me off.
[1:14:36] I'm going to preach it. You'll
[1:14:38] understand it as we get along. Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus in his uh in his earthly ministry
[1:14:48] he said in his earthly ministry
[1:14:52] he began with the local concerns and
[1:14:54] then he says he sent out his disciples
[1:14:57] and he says but go rather to the lost
[1:14:59] sheep of the house of Israel to the the
[1:15:02] the gospel was to the to the nation. Go
[1:15:05] to the lost sheep of the house of
[1:15:07] Israel. And then in Jeremiah, God had
[1:15:10] spoken and said, "My people have been
[1:15:12] lost sheep. Their shepherds have caused
[1:15:15] them to go astray.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; They have turned them away on the
[1:15:19] mountains. They have gone from mountain
[1:15:22] to hill. They have forgotten their
[1:15:25] resting place."
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; But as Jesus moved toward his ultimate
[1:15:31] purpose in life, to be the sacrifice for
[1:15:34] the sins of the world, listen friends.
[1:15:38] this was they thought maybe this is our
[1:15:42] Messiah. This is who we've looked for.
[1:15:45] Will you at this time restore the
[1:15:47] kingdom? But as Jesus is moving towards
[1:15:50] redemption,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; towards not just suffering at Calvary,
[1:15:55] but in God's mind going to redeem the
[1:15:58] world.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Now, it became a world event. It became
[1:16:03] a a a an an event that encompassed the
[1:16:07] globe.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; But they couldn't encompass it in their
[1:16:10] mind. They couldn't say it in their
[1:16:12] mind. It was it was me and Andrew and
[1:16:17] Peter and John and they had words
[1:16:20] amongst themselves.
[1:16:22] Hello folks.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; They had words. They had they had
[1:16:26] feelings. They debated about who was
[1:16:29] going to be the greatest in the kingdom.
[1:16:33] then isn't it?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Say amen if that's true.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Who's going to be greatest in the
[1:16:38] kingdom? And and one is more eloquent
[1:16:41] than the other and and uh uh uh he he
[1:16:45] he's never mentioned me. I'm not he
[1:16:48] never even mentioned me in the Bible.
[1:16:51] Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of the 12,
[1:16:55] but I've never been mentioned. I'm not
[1:16:57] I'm not very much I'm not very visible.
[1:17:00] I'm kind of the invisible disciple.
[1:17:08] Isn't it amazing?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't it really amazing? But is that
[1:17:12] disciple any less than the other
[1:17:14] disciple? Is are they any less than
[1:17:17] Peter or Paul or some of the other
[1:17:19] disciples? No. and and
[1:17:24] we say, "Well, I'm I'm looking way back
[1:17:26] then,
[1:17:28] but now we're talking about we're
[1:17:31] talking about we're talking about very
[1:17:34] very marvelous things. We're talking
[1:17:36] about rapture. We're talking about being
[1:17:39] caught away. We're talking about
[1:17:41] crossing over." Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; But as Jesus moved toward his ultimate
[1:17:49] purpose in life to be the sacrifice for
[1:17:53] the sins of the world, his disciples
[1:17:55] could not comprehend that this ministry
[1:17:58] would encompass the world. And when God
[1:18:02] began to manifest and unfold in Jesus
[1:18:05] his plan and purpose in the death of
[1:18:08] Jesus Christ to be the author of eternal
[1:18:11] life, they were incapable to grasp such
[1:18:15] majestic truth.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; I want to come to the first phase of
[1:18:24] brother Brown's ministry.
[1:18:28] Brother Bram's ministry
[1:18:32] we call it commonly first pole and the
[1:18:34] second pole and the third pull and then
[1:18:37] the first pull he speaks even refers to
[1:18:40] it later on where we're going to be here
[1:18:42] in this some of these cities going out
[1:18:44] and we're going to be doing some
[1:18:46] evangelistic and it won't be preaching
[1:18:49] messages like we preach here at the
[1:18:51] tabernacle. We'll be preaching kind of,
[1:18:54] you know, lighter evangelistic type
[1:18:56] services. what it's to the people that
[1:18:59] are there at that time and we're we're
[1:19:02] going to be speaking to them and and he
[1:19:04] says uh in in 1962 he said in the
[1:19:08] message the absolute and I remember when
[1:19:11] he swept down there in that big light
[1:19:14] standing yonder at the bottom of the
[1:19:16] river 1933
[1:19:19] in June when he said as John the Baptist
[1:19:22] was sent to forerrun uh sent forth to
[1:19:25] forerrun the first coming of Christ. I
[1:19:28] send you with a message to the world to
[1:19:32] forerrun the second coming of Christ.
[1:19:35] Now, we we get it all wrapped up about
[1:19:38] this message coming to me. It's got to
[1:19:40] go a long ways beyond you.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; It's got to go a long ways beyond I'm
[1:19:45] not just talking about geography now.
[1:19:47] I'm talking about what we see
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; and our vision and how we relate to that
[1:19:53] vision.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; It's got to go a long ways. In other
[1:20:00] words, if we if we have our eyes down
[1:20:02] here, we'll just be looking at dust all
[1:20:04] the time. We see this and we see that
[1:20:07] and and I I I just can't, you know, deal
[1:20:11] with some things and and there life's
[1:20:14] difficult. And if we're going to look at
[1:20:16] dust, it's always going to be difficult.
[1:20:18] This dust is weak.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; This dust has is irritable. This dust
[1:20:24] has
[1:20:25] some weaknesses and frailties and it
[1:20:28] will always have it.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown talks about the sticky
[1:20:31] nature. It's not that we suddenly, you
[1:20:34] know, we just all become so wonderful
[1:20:36] and lovey and doy and gushy and so on so
[1:20:40] forth. Icky icky icky. I don't care for
[1:20:43] that anyway.
[1:20:46] Let us be the kind of people that God
[1:20:49] gave us molded by the Holy Spirit. So
[1:20:52] are you saying brother Bisl that we can
[1:20:53] be you know uh just run and bad? No, I'm
[1:20:58] not saying that. I'm not justifying
[1:21:00] that. But I am also saying that we have
[1:21:02] to have sufficient maturity to oversee
[1:21:06] to look beyond what what a person does
[1:21:09] or what they don't do or what they fail
[1:21:12] to do or or whatever it is. We need to
[1:21:15] look beyond that because if whatever you
[1:21:17] see is no excuse for you to pull back.
[1:21:24] Whatever you say, whatever you say in
[1:21:27] the church or in humanity or amongst
[1:21:29] Christians, it's no reason for us to
[1:21:32] blame God for it.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; God is the one that does. He's the one
[1:21:37] that does predestinate the person. He's
[1:21:40] the one that put the seed there.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; God did not make a mistake putting a
[1:21:44] predestinated seed in any believer. God
[1:21:47] didn't make any mistake.
[1:21:51] One might be quiet, one might be
[1:21:53] boisterous, one might be uh uh wiser,
[1:21:57] one might be smart, and one might be
[1:21:59] very very ignorant. That has nothing to
[1:22:01] do with it.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; God has not made any mistakes.
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; I send you a message to the world. Not
[1:22:12] to Cloverdale,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; not to Seattle, not to Victoria, not to
[1:22:17] Reon, not to Jeffersonville only,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; He is a simple man, a humble man, a man
[1:22:28] of few words, and a man of poor grammar.
[1:22:30] He said so many times, "I can't preach
[1:22:33] like these men." He He admired those men
[1:22:36] that could get up and put their thoughts
[1:22:38] together. I do, too.
[1:22:40] put their thoughts together and and be
[1:22:43] so analytical in their mind. And I
[1:22:46] admire that. That's not the point. If
[1:22:49] you're called to say something, you're
[1:22:51] called to be a witness.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Live it,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; speak it,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; be a witness.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we should not mar
[1:23:02] that. Right.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "And now I believe
[1:23:11] and now I believe she's ready to strike
[1:23:13] the final climax yonder to bring forth a
[1:23:17] faith that will rapture the church into
[1:23:21] glory."
[1:23:22] And she is laying in the messages.
[1:23:28] Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's too late for me
[1:23:30] to
[1:23:32] uh to kind of, you know, just silk glove
[1:23:37] or kid glove things. You've got to say
[1:23:39] things the way they are.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks about Pentecost.
[1:23:44] He says,
[1:23:46] and he doesn't, these are not exact
[1:23:47] words, but I I was looking for the quote
[1:23:49] and now I have it. But he says uh
[1:23:53] Pentecost could not bring forth
[1:23:56] the rapture
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; because they're too broken up.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Because they're too broken up.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Because they're too broken up.
[1:24:12] Say, "Well, why are you saying that to
[1:24:14] us this way?" because I have always
[1:24:17] believed
[1:24:20] I'm opposed.
[1:24:22] And brother Brandham says his ministry
[1:24:24] was to bring people together.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. his ministry. It doesn't let
[1:24:30] you swallow up and have all kinds of
[1:24:32] worldliness and all kinds of nonsense
[1:24:34] and foolishness, but it is that there
[1:24:38] there's a difference between that and
[1:24:40] and having a having a appreciation a
[1:24:45] genuine appreciation for a bloodbought
[1:24:49] son and daughter of God.
[1:24:52] And if they don't meet your standards,
[1:24:56] so they don't meet your standards. But
[1:24:59] if they don't meet your standards, that
[1:25:01] doesn't mean that you push them off in
[1:25:03] the ditch.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; As long as they are
[1:25:08] sincerely and honestly and
[1:25:13] living a godly life and doing their
[1:25:16] best. I believe these are all essential
[1:25:18] things. I'm talking about doing their
[1:25:21] best,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; not just sloughing along, but doing
[1:25:24] their very best, being a godly believer,
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; and believing and and and having respect
[1:25:31] for whether it be the deacons or the
[1:25:34] trustees or one another or your or your
[1:25:36] parents or your your children or
[1:25:39] whatever more. Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to make very many personal
[1:25:46] references because I feel in this area
[1:25:49] we all lack very very much. But I when I
[1:25:54] was when I was a young man with a family
[1:25:59] of teenage daughters
[1:26:02] and God began to just blow in like that
[1:26:07] and amongst the young people like
[1:26:10] hippies were kind of thing of the past
[1:26:14] and they were disenchanted.
[1:26:17] Of course, they went into the hippie
[1:26:18] movement because they were disenchanted
[1:26:21] with, you know, the material world and
[1:26:23] the plastic world and all of these
[1:26:25] things.
[1:26:27] There's been all kinds of movements when
[1:26:29] people became disenchanted with
[1:26:30] something. So they were disenchanted
[1:26:32] with that and they went into the hippie
[1:26:34] movement and they were just going to be
[1:26:36] happy happy hippies and you know travel
[1:26:38] around and go down to South America and
[1:26:41] go down to go over to Europe and traps
[1:26:44] around the country and and finally of
[1:26:46] course that runs out
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and money has a strange way of running
[1:26:50] out
[1:26:53] and so that runs out and and uh and and
[1:26:56] I've said here many times I've seen I
[1:26:59] saw painted on the rocks maybe going
[1:27:01] down I5 and great big rock and they'll
[1:27:04] say, "Jesus, help us now."
[1:27:08] And that always stabbed me in my heart.
[1:27:11] Every time it stabbed me. How many have
[1:27:13] seen that? Jesus, help us now. Raise
[1:27:16] your hands.
[1:27:19] My goodness.
[1:27:21] Some of you folks, nobody over here
[1:27:24] looks down on the side of the road.
[1:27:28] I I've still seen that sign. It's kind
[1:27:31] of getting a little worn, but I still
[1:27:33] see it. I hear it on the I5. They have
[1:27:35] one great big rock down there says,
[1:27:37] "Jesus, help us now." And the thing that
[1:27:41] stabbed me was, "I have what they need.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I know what they need." And that was the
[1:27:48] crying out for that witness. So, how do
[1:27:51] we start that? How do we What do we do?
[1:27:54] Anything. Just anything. Oh, well, I
[1:27:57] like to be in a in a house and like to
[1:27:59] be together and like to be a coffee
[1:28:01] house. All right. Well, we're moving out
[1:28:03] of the house. Maybe we'll do that. I
[1:28:05] kept the house 5 months empty
[1:28:08] all through winter and had the pipes
[1:28:11] break from freezing and all the rest of
[1:28:13] it. Just an incredible thing. And the
[1:28:16] devil actually I I heard his voice speak
[1:28:19] to me. He said, "You're a fool, Biscll.
[1:28:21] You could have rented this place." And I
[1:28:24] just want to tell you, but I thought
[1:28:25] maybe these young people that wrote
[1:28:28] that, you know, Jesus help us now. I
[1:28:31] know who that Jesus is.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That Jesus has sent a messenger.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I've seen the manifestation of it, but I
[1:28:39] don't know how to get it out to them. I
[1:28:42] don't know how to let them know. I don't
[1:28:43] know who painted this, but I I I wanted
[1:28:46] to get it out. See, that's that's the
[1:28:49] difference between, you know, just
[1:28:51] riding along and not doing anything or
[1:28:53] having a desire to do something.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Not a preacher. We didn't have a church.
[1:28:58] I wasn't preaching, but I just wanted to
[1:29:01] be a witness.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; So, I would go where they were gathered
[1:29:04] and talk to them or whatever I could do
[1:29:06] or hand them a track or give them a
[1:29:09] dollar or whatever I could do.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] Brother Brandham in a and uh I have a
[1:29:21] phrase here and you excuse me for just
[1:29:23] taking my time. This is unusual the way
[1:29:25] I'm speaking but he said here try to
[1:29:29] understand and I'm I want to come to
[1:29:31] that phrase and this is in the Easter
[1:29:34] Seal in 1965.
[1:29:37] He said look at the millions on earth
[1:29:39] that didn't receive it when Jesus was
[1:29:42] here
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; but how thankful we are. Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And how thankful we should be this
[1:29:47] morning to know that we have the direct
[1:29:50] evidence.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; And the Bible proof
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; that we are included in that great
[1:29:55] resurrection morning coming
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; and great Easter. We have the earnest of
[1:30:01] it right now in our mortal bodies.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; You should have to say that.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; I have the evidence. I have the earnest
[1:30:14] of this great resurrection
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; right now, presently in my body.
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wait till you can say that.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I have
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; the evidence, the earnest
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; of it right now in our mortal bodies.
[1:30:45] He he goes on further to say and try to
[1:30:47] grasp this now. The pre predestinated
[1:30:50] ones are the first of course to be
[1:30:53] quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:30:57] claim its own. Now there's a now there's
[1:31:00] a great statement. I want I want my
[1:31:03] minister brothers to try to understand
[1:31:06] this.
[1:31:08] It's calling on ministers to try to
[1:31:11] understand this. I'm talking to you as a
[1:31:14] congregation, many of you, not
[1:31:16] ministers,
[1:31:18] wives, husbands, young people, but to
[1:31:22] try to under here's a prophet trying to
[1:31:24] get ministers to understand this. And
[1:31:27] now we'll see exactly what it is. In the
[1:31:31] beginning, God the great spirit, he
[1:31:34] wasn't even God then. He was the eternal
[1:31:38] one.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; But in order to be God, there had to be
[1:31:41] something to worship him. So he created
[1:31:44] angels.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Are we all right thus far?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; But remember you in the stature that you
[1:31:52] are in this morning.
[1:31:56] You
[1:31:58] see this is coming. I I decided I wasn't
[1:32:00] going to just speak about things. We
[1:32:03] want to speak about individuals, about
[1:32:05] you as an individual. I'm too old to
[1:32:09] just speak generalities.
[1:32:12] We have to speak about you as an
[1:32:15] individual. He says, "But remember you
[1:32:19] in the stature that you are in this
[1:32:21] morning. If you wasn't in his thinking
[1:32:24] then, you're not now. for you. There's
[1:32:29] some part that's in you that's eternal
[1:32:33] and God only belong and that only
[1:32:36] belongs to God. It only belongs to God.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; If you were in God's thinking,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; you you you you need to be able to
[1:32:46] declare that with with a conviction. I
[1:32:51] was in God's thinking in the beginning.
[1:32:54] And the reason I know that is because
[1:32:56] there is something that is in me now
[1:32:59] that's pulsating. I don't even
[1:33:01] understand it sometime. Some simple
[1:33:04] little thing. You might say to me, "What
[1:33:07] what caused you to dial uh Sister Carne
[1:33:10] Spencer?" I have no idea.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; I don't have any idea. All I know is it
[1:33:16] did it and it works.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; How come you're sitting here? You can
[1:33:20] say this morning, how come I'm sitting
[1:33:22] in this church? What am I doing here?
[1:33:26] Something pulsated in you.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Something registered in you someplace.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; And the prophet, he talked about a
[1:33:42] series of things. He said, "We let the
[1:33:45] church and we let our job and we let
[1:33:48] this and we let other things get it out
[1:33:50] of us.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Cloud it over."
[1:34:07] He says for you there's some part of
[1:34:11] that's in you that's eternal
[1:34:14] and eternal only belongs to God and in
[1:34:18] God was his thinking of you sitting
[1:34:22] right where you are Now,
[1:34:28] you know, it gets quiet because you're
[1:34:31] thinking,
[1:34:34] but we need to think and do a little bit
[1:34:37] more than think. We need to accept it
[1:34:39] somehow. And Abraham believed God
[1:34:43] and it was counted to him for
[1:34:45] righteousness.
[1:34:47] Abraham's problem was
[1:34:50] he didn't have a child. His wife says,
[1:34:53] "Go and take Hagar, and maybe she'll
[1:34:56] have a child on me."
[1:34:58] And he he he conceds and he has a child
[1:35:01] with Hagar.
[1:35:03] And and then and and then Hagar begins
[1:35:06] to
[1:35:07] begins to look down, cast down on her
[1:35:10] mistress, on Sarah, says, "You can't
[1:35:14] conceive. I've got a child.
[1:35:18] Your husband can't give you a child.
[1:35:20] He's given me a child." And you knew how
[1:35:22] that happened. And Hagar
[1:35:26] said, "I won't have this woman in my
[1:35:28] house."
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Well, it's she's in your hand. Abram
[1:35:34] says, "Do what you Well, she made it so
[1:35:36] hard." Hagar left.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord meets Hagar.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; The angel of God made her
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; out by the well
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; and said, "Go back." and bow yourself
[1:35:52] down under your mistress
[1:35:56] because and it God God when he's talking
[1:35:59] to Abraham and tell him look at the
[1:36:01] stars he wasn't saying well you know
[1:36:05] I know about all of that trouble he
[1:36:07] didn't dwell about that trouble because
[1:36:09] he's not interested in dust
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching over your heads I'm
[1:36:18] preaching over my head I say if we don't
[1:36:22] regard that we got something next time
[1:36:24] we respond and speak I tell you this
[1:36:27] really been affecting me and affecting
[1:36:30] me in a very very real way and you know
[1:36:33] because life has its uh has its way of
[1:36:38] getting us into the vortex of things and
[1:36:41] and we get all kinds of things that I
[1:36:44] find these things that add pressure to
[1:36:46] life they take away from the joy and uh
[1:36:50] things of the uh uh the things of real
[1:36:52] eternal value. And I think that the
[1:36:55] Satan, this is what I personally think
[1:36:57] Satan uses this world. He has access.
[1:37:00] It's his kingdom.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; So he uses whatever he he needs to use.
[1:37:04] He can use the God of education. He can
[1:37:08] use the God of immigration. He use the
[1:37:10] God of economics. He can use the king of
[1:37:13] all of these different things. Put
[1:37:15] pressure on these people. Pressure on
[1:37:17] these people. and and uh and and then
[1:37:21] it's one thing to run out of money. It's
[1:37:23] another thing to run out of patience and
[1:37:26] another thing to run out of
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; whatever whatever we need to continue in
[1:37:31] life.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "Well, really, what
[1:37:34] are you preaching, Brother Bisc?" I'm
[1:37:36] saying, "Look up to the stars."
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Look at one another and see a star.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; See a celebrity of heaven.
[1:37:47] See a blood washed.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Look through the blood. That's God. Your
[1:37:52] father looks through the blood.
[1:37:57] Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "And in God was his thinking of
[1:38:13] you sitting
[1:38:15] right where you are." Now,
[1:38:19] I'm going to be real blunt. I either
[1:38:21] have to call brother Brandham a liar or
[1:38:23] the truth. Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And if he said that you were in God's
[1:38:28] thinking,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; sitting where you are right now,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I happen to want to go on record and say
[1:38:35] I believe that.
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; I just want to say I believe that. Do
[1:38:41] you believe that?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You folks believe that.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; He said, I stood at the pulpit this
[1:38:50] morning. Here I am.
[1:38:53] and he stood at the pulpit this morning
[1:38:55] because he's infinite and he knows all
[1:38:57] things. Therefore, he could tell the end
[1:39:00] from the beginning and because he's
[1:39:02] eternal. And you being a son of God or a
[1:39:05] daughter of God, then you were in his
[1:39:07] thinking at the beginning. You mean to
[1:39:09] tell me that I'm standing here behind
[1:39:11] this pulpit and the God who knew all
[1:39:13] things from the beginning to the end had
[1:39:16] you in his thinking before the beginning
[1:39:19] of the world and gives me the privilege
[1:39:22] to stand here the honor to stand here
[1:39:25] and speak to the purchase of God's
[1:39:28] elected people.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; That's more than my mind can grasp. But
[1:39:36] I have to say I believe that. And the
[1:39:40] more that we say I believe that it will
[1:39:43] change your attitude towards that person
[1:39:46] or towards the people or towards the
[1:39:50] body of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can I will tell you on
[1:39:56] authority, you just wait a few years and
[1:40:00] you'll see the wheels of God turn the
[1:40:03] way he intended them to turn. Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Not because I do it or somebody else
[1:40:10] does it. I find the best rem the best
[1:40:14] recipe is to be godly. Serve God. Be a
[1:40:18] Christian every day. Live a rugged
[1:40:21] simple life.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Before God and let God do the work and
[1:40:26] he will it he will certainly do the
[1:40:28] work.
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:37] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes, please.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to talk about the ministry
[1:40:47] of the bride, and I have a little ways
[1:40:49] to go, but I'm going to go quickly as I
[1:40:51] can.
[1:40:54] In the token message, he said, "Now, the
[1:40:56] very spirit itself is the token. The
[1:40:59] Holy Spirit itself is the token, not the
[1:41:03] blood. The blood the blood was shed at
[1:41:06] Calvary. That is true. But the blood as
[1:41:09] far as it is went back into the elements
[1:41:13] from which it came from the from the
[1:41:16] food that he lived on. But you see
[1:41:19] inside that blood cell, I woke up and I
[1:41:23] thought so much about this. Inside that
[1:41:26] blood cell,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; inside that blood cell,
[1:41:33] was a life
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and that started
[1:41:38] that started the blood cell
[1:41:43] to moving
[1:41:45] the chemistry had no life in it.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going very slow. I want you to
[1:41:52] follow it. The chemistry,
[1:41:54] the blood, the paint, the blood had no
[1:41:57] life in it.
[1:41:59] It had no virtue in it. The the the
[1:42:02] chemistry had no life in it itself. And
[1:42:05] therefore it could not move. But when
[1:42:08] the life came into the chemistry of the
[1:42:12] blood, it formed a cell, it formed its
[1:42:16] own cell. Then cell after cell, then it
[1:42:20] became a man. And that man was God
[1:42:23] Emmanuel, his flesh in flesh. And when
[1:42:27] that life returned back, the chemistry
[1:42:30] went to it. But the token is the Holy
[1:42:33] Spirit upon the church that they see
[1:42:37] Christ. Now I I you need to perhaps read
[1:42:40] that and ponder. I've been pondering it
[1:42:42] very deep. The the the
[1:42:47] child in a mother begins to form and
[1:42:50] there's a there's a blood cell. There's
[1:42:52] a blood unit, blood cell, and there's a
[1:42:54] life in the blood cell. And when the
[1:42:57] blood is gone, the the the the the life
[1:43:00] doesn't go, the life goes back wherever
[1:43:03] it came from.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I want to just continue on a moment. He
[1:43:09] said it has to be because the woman and
[1:43:11] her husband become one. They become one
[1:43:14] and so does the bride and Christ become
[1:43:17] one. The ministry of the bride and the
[1:43:20] ministry of Christ is the same. And
[1:43:24] that's why I read this quote. The
[1:43:27] ministry of the bride and the ministry
[1:43:29] of Christ is the same. The bride is not
[1:43:32] someone who hears uh uh hears a series
[1:43:35] of doctrines.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; The bride is not somebody who merely
[1:43:39] goes to church. The bride is not
[1:43:42] somebody who believes some erratic or
[1:43:45] false or cultish things. That's not the
[1:43:48] bride. The bride is someone who in whom
[1:43:52] God has made himself known to that
[1:43:55] individual. And they believe things that
[1:43:57] are even beyond their vision. They
[1:44:00] believe things that are beyond their
[1:44:02] reasoning. They believe the impossible.
[1:44:04] They see that God has said it and so I'm
[1:44:07] going to believe it. And if God said he
[1:44:11] purchased these people and they are they
[1:44:13] are selves of of his own eternal life,
[1:44:18] if these are children of God and
[1:44:21] children of the resurrection, he wants
[1:44:24] his children to see that.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Not just go week in and week out and
[1:44:29] year in and year out without at least
[1:44:32] seeking to grasp that. Lord, help me
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; this morning
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; to see it.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Why is the ministry of the bride of
[1:44:52] Jesus Christ the same as Jesus? We
[1:44:55] talked about You don't have any problem
[1:44:57] when I talk about
[1:44:59] Jesus when he was here on earth. He
[1:45:02] began to preach this. He began to say
[1:45:04] these things. Then he began to You don't
[1:45:06] have any problem with that. But the
[1:45:08] bride, the ministry of the bride, in
[1:45:10] other words, this is transcended down.
[1:45:14] It's been transferred down. I talked
[1:45:16] about Jesus ministry when he was on
[1:45:18] earth. We talked about the the prophet's
[1:45:21] ministry, how it started in its
[1:45:23] simplicity, but as it matured, as it
[1:45:26] matured, and we as believers believe,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; that we have a message that's maturing.
[1:45:33] us as Christians, as believers, as we m
[1:45:36] as we mature, I will just say it
[1:45:39] plainly, the more mature we are, the
[1:45:42] higher we ought to be able to look.
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; The more mature we are, we we ought to
[1:45:51] be able to look up and see stars.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; I want that to become more than poetic.
[1:45:58] See stars. see the glory of God and look
[1:46:03] upon a person, look upon these young
[1:46:05] people, look upon one another as
[1:46:09] believers
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; and uh
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; I started to say and I will it comes
[1:46:17] back to my mind.
[1:46:20] I looked upon my own daughters
[1:46:24] and I saw a strength in them of witness.
[1:46:30] They were unashamed
[1:46:32] to speak of it in the school.
[1:46:35] And I I looked on it hadn't been very
[1:46:37] many years before that I had been in
[1:46:39] school. I thought I could never have
[1:46:42] done that.
[1:46:44] I I just wasn't that kind of person. And
[1:46:47] they just
[1:46:49] say it, you know, turn or burn.
[1:46:54] Oh my goodness. I could never say that.
[1:46:57] So what did that do to me? I didn't try
[1:47:00] to instruct them in it. I I I I buried
[1:47:03] it in my heart. I thought that's
[1:47:05] marvelous.
[1:47:07] That's marvelous that they have. In
[1:47:09] other words, there's a something there.
[1:47:11] there's something there that they're
[1:47:13] being forward and and I could see it
[1:47:14] producing a life and conviction in
[1:47:17] others.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; So, as we move along, we should be able
[1:47:23] to see our sights get a little higher
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; and higher.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I've traveled a lot. I know ministers
[1:47:30] all over the world. Are they all close
[1:47:32] to me? No. And they don't need to be.
[1:47:36] They may be in other countries and they
[1:47:38] may be and they may be serving God in
[1:47:41] their own direction and may not be what
[1:47:43] I'm called to do and they're not called
[1:47:45] to this and we're we're all called to do
[1:47:48] different things but we're effective and
[1:47:50] I appreciate it.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you.
[1:47:56] I appreciate, brother Daniel, you coming
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; and sitting on this bench
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; and and I I I admire that.
[1:48:09] And what effect does that have? I don't
[1:48:10] know, but it has an effect.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And I see others.
[1:48:17] It may surprise you, but I I've seen
[1:48:20] others and I've seen I've just seen
[1:48:22] their life in the little simplicity
[1:48:23] things. Sister Kalista is sitting here.
[1:48:27] You see her. She doesn't get out and
[1:48:29] preach or do anything. But one day I had
[1:48:32] a very crisis moment.
[1:48:36] I had to see an unbeliever
[1:48:39] who just lost a loved one
[1:48:43] and all the responsibility of the
[1:48:45] funeral and everything was upon her and
[1:48:48] everybody was pulling, you know, trying
[1:48:50] to get influence with her and so on so
[1:48:52] forth.
[1:48:54] And I knew that I needed to see her.
[1:48:59] I said to my wife, "We got to drive to
[1:49:01] this place."
[1:49:04] And I'm all nervous inside. I'm the
[1:49:06] preacher.
[1:49:07] I'm the one that's supposed to have the
[1:49:09] answers.
[1:49:11] But I'm all nervous inside. I'm all tied
[1:49:13] up inside.
[1:49:15] I don't really want to go, but I have to
[1:49:18] go. It's responsible.
[1:49:21] I drive into the drive, walk into the
[1:49:24] house. I thought the house was going to
[1:49:26] be full of people. Nobody's in the
[1:49:29] house. Sister Kalista is sitting there
[1:49:33] with that woman
[1:49:35] just keeping her company and being with
[1:49:38] her. I may not have said this, Sister
[1:49:40] Kalissa, you went way up in my books.
[1:49:45] God had you go there.
[1:49:48] You people maybe you don't realize
[1:49:52] you just went to a place.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; You just talked to somebody.
[1:49:57] But it was that
[1:50:00] life that's in the cell.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; That God put in you before the
[1:50:05] foundation of the world.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; That was motivating you, pulsating you,
[1:50:10] causing a thought up into your mind. You
[1:50:12] thought it was just your idea. Not your
[1:50:14] idea. It's God doing it.
[1:50:17] And I just pray that we would be wise
[1:50:19] enough and and and have enough
[1:50:21] revelation enough so that the next
[1:50:22] person next door next to them sitting
[1:50:25] beside to say I saw that
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; and I esteem them more. I say God bless
[1:50:31] them.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; And I come to church and I say there's a
[1:50:34] smile on your face because there's
[1:50:36] sister so and so, there's brother so and
[1:50:39] so. And even if we don't say anything,
[1:50:41] God's still doing it.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; God called them. Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; You young people, you don't know.
[1:50:49] Perhaps you can have a such an
[1:50:51] influence.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; On your parents. Your parents need to be
[1:50:54] encouraged
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; and they just see that godly life that
[1:50:57] you're living.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Is this okay?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:51:09] The ministry
[1:51:11] of the bride of Christ
[1:51:15] and the ministry of Jesus Christ, it's
[1:51:18] exactly the same.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham actually referred to
[1:51:27] the same scripture that I read for a
[1:51:30] text
[1:51:31] and he said uh
[1:51:34] he was reading the first
[1:51:37] The first words of that chapter, the
[1:51:40] former treatise have I made, O
[1:51:43] Theophilles, of all that Jesus began to
[1:51:45] do,
[1:51:47] began to do and teach. And he said, "And
[1:51:50] is still doing
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; in the bride of Jesus Christ."
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; All that he began to do and he's still
[1:51:58] doing it.
[1:52:02] Amen.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And the things that
[1:52:09] uh dilute this or bring this down
[1:52:15] and Satan, I'm going to tell you what he
[1:52:16] would do because I know his tactics very
[1:52:18] well. He'd try to press upon your mind
[1:52:21] and think about you're still thinking
[1:52:23] about, you know, all these things and
[1:52:26] that are around. No, don't let your
[1:52:28] vision go down.
[1:52:31] If you let your vision go down, you'll
[1:52:33] finally be looking at dust.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; You'll just be looking at dust.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; But if you let your vision rise,
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; well, how will I do that, brother
[1:52:44] Biscll? Just by believing.
[1:52:48] So, I don't know how it's going to
[1:52:50] happen. I don't know what the outcome
[1:52:52] is.
[1:52:53] I don't know what the outcome of this
[1:52:55] generation is. I don't know what the
[1:52:56] outcome of my family is.
[1:52:59] I know one thing that word of God is
[1:53:02] absolutely true
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; and I know that this God sent this
[1:53:06] messenger
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; because I needed something.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And whatever I needed is there in the
[1:53:12] message
[1:53:14] [Music]
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you one more example
[1:53:22] and I'd like to do this before I close.
[1:53:24] Is that all right? Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; I'll just take these few minutes,
[1:53:28] probably 5 10 minutes,
[1:53:35] brother Brandham, in one of the last
[1:53:38] messages, the rapture message,
[1:53:42] I think it's one of the earlier messages
[1:53:44] that you, Sister Lesie, read, the
[1:53:47] rapture message.
[1:53:55] and he said uh
[1:53:57] that there's a shout and that shout is
[1:53:59] the message.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going slow because I want you to
[1:54:04] hang on to it.
[1:54:07] And the shout is the message and then a
[1:54:10] voice
[1:54:12] and then a trumpet.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; And the voice is the resurrection
[1:54:18] and the trumpet is the gathering.
[1:54:22] Now, this might just blow your mind a
[1:54:25] little bit.
[1:54:28] And he says, "The shout a messenger
[1:54:31] getting the people ready
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; for us." Some have been on the way a
[1:54:38] long time,
[1:54:40] others more recent.
[1:54:44] A messenger getting the people ready.
[1:54:47] The second is a voice of the
[1:54:49] resurrection.
[1:54:51] The same voice, the same voice that a
[1:54:56] loud voice in St. John 11:38-44
[1:55:01] that call Lazarus from the grave.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Getting the bride together
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; and then the resurrection of the dead.
[1:55:10] See, to be caught up with it. Now watch
[1:55:13] the three things take place. The next is
[1:55:16] what was a trumpet, a shout, a voice, a
[1:55:20] trumpet. I went to that because I was
[1:55:24] looking for this phrase, the voice of
[1:55:26] the resurrection. It's once in the
[1:55:30] message, once in the rapture message,
[1:55:34] and I went exactly where I wanted to go.
[1:55:38] And so I go to Lazarus.
[1:55:42] And Jesus said unto her,
[1:55:46] now follow, don't don't don't think that
[1:55:48] I'm way off in left field. You're here
[1:55:51] as
[1:55:53] students of the Bible.
[1:55:55] And Jesus said unto her, that was to
[1:55:58] Martha. Jesus
[1:56:01] the messenger
[1:56:03] said to her personally,
[1:56:06] "Said I not unto thee,
[1:56:10] if thou which believe, thou shouldest
[1:56:14] see the glory of God?"
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Lazarus did not hear that voice.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Lazarus was still in the grave. Right.
[1:56:24] Right.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Then they took away the stone from the
[1:56:29] place where the dead was raised, where
[1:56:32] the dead was laid, I'm sorry. And Jesus
[1:56:35] lifted up his eyes and said, "Father,"
[1:56:39] now it's not to Martha
[1:56:42] and it's not to Lazarus, but he's
[1:56:44] saying, "Father,
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; I thank thee that thou heardest me,
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; and I knew that thou heard hearest me
[1:56:54] always, but because of the people which
[1:56:57] stand by, I said it,"
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; they heard it, too.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Right? They didn't even know why they
[1:57:06] were hearing it.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And Jesus saying, "Father,
[1:57:10] you heard me. And I know that you always
[1:57:13] hear me." And that he said for the
[1:57:16] people that were around in the
[1:57:18] congregation at that time because they
[1:57:21] needed to hear it.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; I know that you always hear me. Lazarus
[1:57:28] hadn't heard that yet.
[1:57:31] So now we have the messenger who's
[1:57:34] speaking the message
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; that was God in flesh
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; words of God proceeding from the words
[1:57:41] of Jes from the mouth of Jesus and Jesus
[1:57:44] at one point here this morning friends
[1:57:47] he might be speaking to a Martha he
[1:57:49] might speak to one person I'm speaking
[1:57:52] to you as an individual
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; and you sense and feel some kind of
[1:57:58] pulsating happening within
[1:58:00] You might not even understand it all.
[1:58:03] They didn't understand it. Martha didn't
[1:58:06] understand it. The people standing by
[1:58:08] didn't understand it. But this was Jesus
[1:58:11] Christ himself, God in flesh, speaking
[1:58:14] the words. And he says, I say unto thee
[1:58:17] that thou shalt see the glory of God.
[1:58:20] And then he addresses the father.
[1:58:22] Father, I know that you hear me. You
[1:58:25] always hear me. This said he for those
[1:58:28] that stood by.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; They didn't even know it. They didn't
[1:58:32] come forward and say, "Oh Lord, I'm so
[1:58:35] glad you said those words. I needed that
[1:58:38] so bad." They didn't know they needed
[1:58:41] that. He knew they needed that. Amen.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad this morning
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; that God has someone even will speak
[1:58:50] behind the pulpit if I'm able to if I if
[1:58:53] if I would
[1:58:56] say
[1:58:57] it'd be a great honor for me to be able
[1:59:00] to speak something you don't understand.
[1:59:03] But father, if you know the people need
[1:59:06] it, I am so blessed to be able to be an
[1:59:09] instrument to say something that the
[1:59:11] people need to hear.
[1:59:15] [Applause]
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Here's the prophet. Here's what I see.
[1:59:19] the prophet in in his last messages and
[1:59:23] God is having him utter some things so
[1:59:27] that we 50 years or so down the road can
[1:59:31] be uh uh uh can be sensitive and say
[1:59:34] there's things buried in his message
[1:59:36] that I need to hear. And now he's
[1:59:39] explaining for the first time the shout
[1:59:42] which is the message that the people
[1:59:44] heard and the voice which will raise the
[1:59:48] resurrect the dead
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; and the and the trumpet the gathering of
[1:59:53] them together. And he's making it known
[1:59:56] this order great order making it just
[2:00:00] before he goes for you.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't know he said that for me. He
[2:00:05] said it for you. Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; I'm encumbered with all kinds of things.
[2:00:11] Now you have a little preacher saying,
[2:00:12] "Look up."
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Those things will always be.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Well, Father, we have poor people
[2:00:21] amongst us. You'll always have the poor.
[2:00:24] But look up.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; You don't disregard that. Do what you
[2:00:27] need to do as a Christian. We have
[2:00:30] conflicts. You'll always have them.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; You have disagreements. There'll always
[2:00:35] be disagreements.
[2:00:36] Amen.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Say, "Amen."
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; There'll always be disagreements.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; It affects me. It'll always affect you.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Well, it's not of God. There'll always
[2:00:54] be things that are not of God.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Sickness is not of God.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Depression's not of God.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; All kinds of things are not of God. But
[2:01:04] there is a land beyond the river where
[2:01:07] these things don't exist. And God has
[2:01:10] put a seed in me that calls for that
[2:01:12] land.
[2:01:24] But because of the people which stand
[2:01:27] by, I said it, that they that they might
[2:01:30] believe that thou hast sent me.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And when he had thus spoken, he cried
[2:01:37] with a loud voice, Lazarus,
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; come forth.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; And he heard that.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And the living heard that.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; God could already have spoken.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; By the messenger
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; time will come.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; At the appointed time.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; He's already said it. At the appointed
[2:02:11] time, the voice.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; And Jesus does all three while he's
[2:02:15] descending. Say, I can't understand
[2:02:18] that. Good for you. I don't either. But
[2:02:21] I say thus I believe it. He spoke it and
[2:02:24] thus I believe it.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; When will they come? At the appointed
[2:02:30] time. The voice the voice of Jesus
[2:02:34] Christ will bring them from the dead.
[2:02:36] And you may have and the people now the
[2:02:38] people who are standing by already heard
[2:02:40] it.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; They heard the words for them. They
[2:02:44] heard him refer to the father and and
[2:02:47] they heard him say I thank thee and I
[2:02:49] and this I say not I I say because of
[2:02:53] those that stand by that they may
[2:02:56] believe that you sent me
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; and if they didn't believe it then if
[2:03:00] they had a twinge of doubt then they say
[2:03:03] maybe you want to think well Joseph of
[2:03:05] Mary you know I mean well he lived down
[2:03:07] and he was a Nazarene and so maybe maybe
[2:03:10] they had all of those thoughts. I can
[2:03:12] tell you one thing. When he said,
[2:03:14] "Lazarus, come forth." And Lazarus came,
[2:03:18] all those thoughts vanished.
[2:03:23] All those earthly thoughts. All those
[2:03:26] thoughts, I call them dust thoughts.
[2:03:29] Thoughts of dust. They're too low.
[2:03:32] They're not worthy of your time. I say
[2:03:34] to this congregation, lift up your eyes
[2:03:38] and see beyond your education. and see
[2:03:41] beyond your work. See beyond your
[2:03:44] failures, see beyond your weaknesses.
[2:03:47] And see that God has sent from heavens a
[2:03:50] message to you that pulsates in your
[2:03:53] heart. And something within you is
[2:03:56] saying, "It is true. It is true. It is
[2:03:58] true."
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Something is saying, "When I come into
[2:04:04] the house of God, there's an atmosphere.
[2:04:08] Who is it?" The Holy Ghost.
[2:04:12] Not just to be around you and to
[2:04:14] surround you, but to be in you.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; And the living and the dead both heard
[2:04:23] that voice.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Take it however you want to take it. The
[2:04:28] living and the dead both heard. Lazarus,
[2:04:32] come forth.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And Lazarus came forth.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, loose him and let him
[2:04:39] go. You put these rags on them. Take
[2:04:41] them off.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; It's all kinds of stuff we put on one
[2:04:46] another. Take it off.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong here.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong with this kind of life.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Some stuff we can take off.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have to put burdens on people.
[2:05:01] Take it off.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Take these rags off.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:05:08] I say praise be to God.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; That was the sign of the resurrection.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this
[2:05:25] messenger, I'll just say this messenger
[2:05:28] says perhaps over 50 times,
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; he said one place, we have a right. We
[2:05:35] at this age, at this time, we have a
[2:05:37] right to look for the sign of the
[2:05:40] resurrection.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; And then as he goes on down, then when
[2:05:44] he comes into the the word part of his
[2:05:46] ministry, the people are wanting always
[2:05:49] to see that sign, keep it. And he was
[2:05:52] done with that,
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; And he knew that God had moved on from
[2:05:55] that.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; And so he said as as Jesus said, an
[2:05:59] adulterous
[2:06:01] generation seeketh a sign.
[2:06:04] And he says they'll get it.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; They'll get the sign of Jonas.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; They'll get the sign.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; And here the sign was playing out
[2:06:14] meeting after meeting after meeting.
[2:06:16] They'll get the sign.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; And they got the sign. But we didn't
[2:06:20] only get the sign.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; We have a right to look for the sign. We
[2:06:24] didn't only get the sign. We got the
[2:06:26] voice of the sign.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; The voice of the resurrection.
[2:06:35] That's why we're not living where we
[2:06:36] used to live.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't have to be confused
[2:06:42] about things.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for you. I I thank God
[2:06:46] for you
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; with all my heart. God bless you.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's thank him.
[2:06:55] Father,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; as Jesus spoke those words, I thank thee
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; that you've heard me. I thank you
[2:07:05] because you always hear me. I thank you,
[2:07:09] Father, for this audience of people. I
[2:07:12] thank you for those that are streaming.
[2:07:15] Lord, I thank you for those that will
[2:07:17] hear. And I pray that these words will
[2:07:20] mean, oh God, will have a depth of
[2:07:24] richness. And I ask that the Holy Ghost
[2:07:27] will reveal and make known what is
[2:07:30] needed at this time, at this season.
[2:07:33] Lord, we know that we're in a very, very
[2:07:36] late hour. In fact, is it seems as
[2:07:39] though immortality is merging with the
[2:07:42] mortal. It seems as though, oh God, that
[2:07:45] there's a a merging of the ages
[2:07:48] together. And we pray, oh God, we know
[2:07:52] also that church services will continue
[2:07:55] and things will continue even after the
[2:07:58] rapture takes place. Father, I pray, not
[2:08:02] knowing how many there are. But oh God,
[2:08:04] may each one in faith, the same faith of
[2:08:08] Abraham, say, "This message is for me,
[2:08:12] and this rapture is for me. This has
[2:08:15] been spoken for me. I have been gathered
[2:08:18] to it. I've been gathered to you, the
[2:08:21] author of this word.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll bless this people in Jesus
[2:08:26] Christ's name."
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:30] I have one more thing to say while the
[2:08:32] musicians Thank you. I'm going to sing
[2:08:34] He Leadeth Me, He Leadeth Me. Uh,
[2:08:38] one more thing. When Lazarus came forth,
[2:08:44] this was the trumpet,
[2:08:46] the living, and the resurrected.
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:50] And we're all gathered to Christ.
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:56] [Applause]
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:00] We say in French tootani
[2:09:03] at the end
[2:09:06] the resurrected will arise first. Paul
[2:09:10] said we which are alive and remain will
[2:09:12] be changed. And uh and I know we may
[2:09:16] well
[2:09:20] we try to figure out, you know, a lot of
[2:09:22] people try to imagine what the change.
[2:09:24] Well, I'll be younger. Well, that'll be
[2:09:26] nice. Yeah. I'll be you know, my nature
[2:09:30] will be changed. That'll be nice, too.
[2:09:33] But the best thing is that you'll be
[2:09:35] gathered to him.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] And so I say to this congregation,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; look up.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; I repeat God's words to Abraham. I speak
[2:09:54] Abraham. See, look up.
[2:09:57] [Applause]
[2:09:58] Everything that bogs you down will
[2:10:00] always be here.
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; He'll always be here.
[2:10:15] But the people who
[2:10:18] believe as Abraham believed won't always
[2:10:20] be here.
[2:10:23] That kind of faith will catch them away.
[2:10:26] That's why I'm preaching. I wouldn't
[2:10:28] want to be preaching and to know that
[2:10:29] this is in vain.
[2:10:32] May it stay with you.
[2:10:34] And this is something you practice
[2:10:36] tomorrow. This is something you soon
[2:10:38] something to bo you down. say, "I can't
[2:10:40] stand this anymore. I can't" and just
[2:10:43] say, "Well,
[2:10:45] I'm just going to lift up my eyes.
[2:10:48] Does this really matter?
[2:10:51] See, I get so frustrated."
[2:10:55] You do join the club.
[2:10:59] We get so frustrated.
[2:11:01] Say, "Not you, Brother Ed." Oh, no. I'm
[2:11:04] a saint. I never have that.
[2:11:07] You know better.
[2:11:09] We always do. We always have that. And
[2:11:12] uh that's just natural. But no, when I
[2:11:16] lift up my eyes and look beyond it.
[2:11:20] Hallelujah.
[2:11:22] Hallelujah.
[2:11:24] Hallelujah.
[2:11:28] I'm laughing because I was telling a
[2:11:30] testimony to some of my family uh
[2:11:33] yesterday and uh and just relating how
[2:11:37] things happened in a person's life and
[2:11:39] and uh you know and it's amazing some of
[2:11:43] the people that you sought to do the
[2:11:45] best for.
[2:11:48] They're the ones that turn with such a
[2:11:50] revenge and and uh it's all right. But
[2:11:54] the Bible says of Jesus,
[2:11:57] I could put it in today's language which
[2:11:59] won't have the same effect, but the
[2:12:01] Bible says of Jesus, who for the joy
[2:12:04] that was set before him,
[2:12:08] suffered the shame and he suffered the
[2:12:10] reproach
[2:12:13] suffered the agony.
[2:12:16] What was set before him?
[2:12:20] I want to ask you, are you going to ask
[2:12:22] the question, what was it that was set
[2:12:24] before him?
[2:12:27] Do you dare answer it?
[2:12:32] Those he was going to purchase.
[2:12:37] Now, is it just a big glob of people? Is
[2:12:39] it or did he actually see you as an
[2:12:41] individual?
[2:12:44] And this this won't mean anything unless
[2:12:46] you say he saw me.
[2:12:51] And so I was part of that
[2:12:56] courage. I was part of that joy.
[2:13:02] He saw me.
[2:13:05] He saw me. He knew I would choose him.
[2:13:11] And who for the joy that was set before
[2:13:13] him, he endured the cross. And so I can
[2:13:16] say, who for the joy, if your eyes, if
[2:13:19] you see stars, if you see the glory of
[2:13:22] God, who for the eye for the joy that's
[2:13:25] set before him, he he
[2:13:29] if he was going to see us and see
[2:13:31] everything that you see about yourself,
[2:13:34] it wouldn't have never brought him much
[2:13:36] joy.
[2:13:41] No,
[2:13:43] I hope I'm making that clear who for the
[2:13:46] joy that was set before him.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; You need to see what he was saying.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; More next time.
[2:14:04] Why don't we stand? I want to sing He
[2:14:06] Leadeth me. He Leadeth me.
[2:14:16] Blessed God, oh worth the
[2:14:22] mother,
[2:14:25] what am I?
[2:14:28] Where can I be?
[2:14:31] Still Jesus
[2:14:34] has
[2:14:36] me.
[2:14:38] He leadth me. He leadth me by his own
[2:14:45] hand.
[2:14:50] His faithful power
[2:14:55] for my
[2:14:58] lead.
[2:15:02] Sometimes they sing on nature.
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:27] He
[2:15:30] lead
[2:15:34] [Music]
[2:15:45] by
[2:15:49] we'll sing this third verse as the last
[2:15:51] verse. Lord I would clasp thy hand in
[2:15:55] mine. The important thing here is that
[2:15:58] he clasps your hand in his
[2:16:02] Lord. I would clap my hand in my norm
[2:16:11] [Music]
[2:16:15] whatever
[2:16:18] I see.
[2:16:20] Say to my God that you
[2:16:27] he
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:39] faithful
[2:16:42] I would be for my
[2:16:47] redee.
[2:16:50] Lord, I will thy hand in my nor
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:03] content.
[2:17:04] Whatever
[2:17:07] I see,
[2:17:09] send to my God and lead me.
[2:17:16] He leadth me. He
[2:17:22] is
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:28] his faithful
[2:17:30] power.
[2:17:32] I would for
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:41] May I give a piece of advice to this
[2:17:43] congregation?
[2:17:46] as a child and I've become more aware of
[2:17:49] this probably in the last 2 three years
[2:17:53] than ever before and I speak it to my
[2:17:56] wife
[2:17:59] because
[2:18:01] when I was young I was very passive.
[2:18:07] You might not see me as that but I was
[2:18:08] very passive.
[2:18:10] Well, you're going to go with these
[2:18:11] people now. Okay. All right. You're
[2:18:14] going to sleep in this bed. This is your
[2:18:15] room. Okay. And
[2:18:19] this is how far you have to go to
[2:18:21] school. You got a half a mile of school.
[2:18:22] You got three miles to school. You got
[2:18:24] four miles to school. You leave in the
[2:18:26] dark and you come back in the dark. You
[2:18:30] there's no such a thing as a child
[2:18:31] having rights and saying, "I don't want
[2:18:34] to do that.
[2:18:36] I don't want to get up in the morning. I
[2:18:37] don't want to go and water the horses. I
[2:18:39] don't I don't I'm scared of the dark."
[2:18:43] this is what you had to do
[2:18:45] and he didn't have anything to say about
[2:18:47] it. So they just this is where you go
[2:18:51] this is what you do. So but I didn't
[2:18:53] know that God was training me for the
[2:18:54] missions.
[2:18:56] This is where you sleep.
[2:18:58] This is the boards. This is a piece of
[2:19:00] cloth. This is what you eat. This is
[2:19:03] what we prepared. This is the place.
[2:19:06] Okay.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's not what you have. It's not your
[2:19:10] choice. You just do it.
[2:19:13] And I want to say something this
[2:19:14] congregation. It'd be much better for
[2:19:18] all of us if we just become more
[2:19:20] passive.
[2:19:22] And by that I mean more trusting.
[2:19:26] It blows this way, the wind blows that
[2:19:28] way, and things go wrong and go haywire
[2:19:31] and go sideways. You apply for a job,
[2:19:34] you don't get it. Well, I think you
[2:19:37] don't. I don't mean lazy. I mean
[2:19:39] passive.
[2:19:41] In other words, we don't get all stirred
[2:19:43] up inside and things aren't working the
[2:19:45] way we think they're going to work. We
[2:19:47] have a father.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; He knows our name.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; He knows the way things are supposed to
[2:19:52] go. And we say, "Well, we have a
[2:19:54] disappointment." There'll always be
[2:19:56] disappointments. We lift our eyes above
[2:19:58] the disappointment. Say, "That's not
[2:20:00] going to affect me. I'm a son of God.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of the living God.
[2:20:10] Is that all right?
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; We all have situations. I know this
[2:20:15] congregation. We all have situations.
[2:20:17] Some are very, very severe situations.
[2:20:20] Some are very ugly situations.
[2:20:24] You have a father.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; He knows all about that.
[2:20:28] I have a father. He knows who imposes
[2:20:31] those things. I have a father who's in
[2:20:34] charge. I have a father who's more
[2:20:36] concerned about me than about multitudes
[2:20:39] of others. He's more concerned. He
[2:20:41] actually came, lived, died, raised
[2:20:44] again.
[2:20:47] And he put a seed in me. Do you believe
[2:20:49] that? He put a seed in me before the
[2:20:51] foundation of the world. I was in his
[2:20:54] mind. And he let a seed come out.
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:20:58] And I'm what they call predestinated.
[2:21:01] You say, "Well, uh, that that's
[2:21:05] We don't want to think too much about
[2:21:07] ourselves. We don't get away with that
[2:21:09] nonsense.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Now you get down to seeing dust. When
[2:21:17] you're listening to man's reasoning,
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; it's dust.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Soon as you listen to man's reasoning,
[2:21:24] I'll give you my equation to the thing.
[2:21:28] How much dust
[2:21:30] would his brain
[2:21:32] fill a teaspoon?
[2:21:35] And I'm going to listen to a teaspoon of
[2:21:37] ashes and let it affect my life and let
[2:21:41] it take my joy away.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Never. Never. Not of this world or the
[2:21:46] world to come.
[2:21:51] Listen friends, maybe God just let this
[2:21:55] little preacher here go through what he
[2:21:58] went through and be determined the way
[2:22:00] that he is
[2:22:02] because you need it.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Shake hands with one
[2:22:08] another. I say God bless you in the name
[2:22:09] of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:15] God bless you richly.
[2:22:18] Amen. God bless you, brother.
[2:22:35] [Music]
[2:23:46] Heat. Heat.
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:25:31] You
[2:25:37] can't.
[2:26:01] rest.
[2:26:24] Heat. Heat.
[2:26:38] [Music]
