[0:03] is going to exercise all the power that
[0:06] the Beast had before it which was Pagan
[0:08] Rome when it become Papa
[0:10] Rome that's this nation will do that
[0:14] Revelations 13 plainly explains it the
[0:17] lamb come up out of the Earth the other
[0:19] beasts come up out of water thickness
[0:20] and multitudes of people this lamb come
[0:22] up where there was no people a lamb
[0:25] represents uh religion uh the Lamb of
[0:29] God and remember it spoke like a lamb it
[0:32] was a lamb and then after a while it be
[0:36] received power and spoke like a dragon

[1:03] be into this Council of churches or you
[1:07] won't be able to have fellowship or to
[1:10] to well it's it's practically that way
[1:12] now you can't go to a church and preach
[1:15] L you have a fellowship card or some
[1:17] identification and now on Persons like
[1:20] ourselves we're going to be cut out of
[1:22] all that all together that's exactly
[1:24] because they won't be able to do it it's
[1:26] tightening and then when that time comes
[1:29] and the Press comes to a place to where
[1:31] you're pressed out then watch what I'm
[1:33] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[1:35] watch the third pull then and it'll be
[1:38] absolutely to the total lost but it it
[1:41] will be for the bride in the church now
[1:44] we're closer than it seems to be I don't
[1:48] go when but it's real real close
