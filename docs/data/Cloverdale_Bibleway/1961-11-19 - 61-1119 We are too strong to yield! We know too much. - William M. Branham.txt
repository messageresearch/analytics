TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's God's opportunity that's God's way of getting to us is when we're weak we get something in this encourages of course because God's whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people then when you get to that kind of a way then you you can you're in his kingdom the case is with us that not that we are too weak the case is we're too strong amen we we're we're just too strong that's all the thing of it is we're too Str stronge headed that's right too strong in our head we know too much God wants to get that out of us Mercy on us this morning that's right we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him we got we we yield to ourselves we got to think uh well I here I I got sense enough to know I was amazed a few nights ago when Mama was sick out the hospital I went to there's a little lady next door a that little lady's here you forgive me sister she's a little Kentucky girl from down there and we was and that was her mother-in-law and I was talking to her that night wife and out there along about 1:00 in the morning and her husband laid down on the floor went to sleep she said get out of here you're no good to your mamy anyhow and running out her husband out of the room because he's laying right straight across the door where nurse and nobody getting his snoring away on the floor so she got him up and run him out and she got to talk in there I got talking to her about the Lord and so forth and she said well she said all I ever know was a goose neck hole in a Tobacco Patch early of the morning cutting out the weed and sucker and tobacco and so forth like that said but I tell you he said papy sent us everyone to school and said we still ain't got no sense I thought well maybe that's the reason see you you got to keep the things of the world from you I'm not supporting ignorance not that but I'm trying to think when you get to a place where you think that you just you just know so much that nobody else knows anything about it your knowledge is all right as long as it don't as it don't interfere with the promises of God
