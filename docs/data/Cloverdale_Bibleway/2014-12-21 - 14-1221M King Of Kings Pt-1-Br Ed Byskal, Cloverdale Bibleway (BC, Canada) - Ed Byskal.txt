[Music] &gt;&gt; Lord God of heaven, Lord, that is our humble prayer as we come to you this morning, Lord. [Music] Lord, as we sang this song about that woman, Lord, so needy, Lord, and for so many years she was troubled, maybe in ways that only her would know, dear God. And when she reached out to you, the people around her, they discouraged her. But Lord, she pressed on. Lord, what seemed impossible with man, but something in her heart kept tagging on, Lord. And Lord, she reached out when she came, Lord, and touched you, Lord. Then that which was impossible became possible, Lord. And Lord, as we gather, we are in your presence, Father. Lord, we have needs deep down in our hearts. things that Lord maybe we can't talk about Lord but thou knowest oh God some things just seem impossible dear God but Lord we come to you that Lord give us that faith oh God the faith that will reach out and touch you oh Lord and bring life to our hearts oh God and bring life to our lives oh God the life of God and bring transformation Lord and bring victory oh God. Victory over unbelief. Victory over sin. &gt;&gt; Victory over fear. Oh God that we believe you Lord and trust you. &gt;&gt; Lord you are a loving father. You love us Lord. &gt;&gt; And even when when we've done wrong you still love us father. So we come to you Lord. We are looking to you as a loving father. Oh God bless us with your presence. May your angels be around us this morning Lord. Come and walk around us father. Come and be with us Lord. We love you father. Oh may we experience your love in our hearts father in a way perhaps that we've never heard before. Dear God, just once more, dear God, as Samson called unto you and said, Lord, just this once, once more, Lord, come and be with us, Father. And Lord, we remember I believe is the sister with cancer. Lord, we we want to pray for her, dear God. That which is not possible with man is possible with you, Lord. We pray that in the name of Jesus, Lord, as we are gathered here, reaching out to you, may you reach out to her and give us faith, Lord. Faith to call on you, Lord. Faith that will bring you on the scene. And Lord, this very message that we believe, the voice that you used to preach this message, Lord, one of the things that this message was sent was to defeat cancer.

Just going to ask brother Tom to make a few announcements. God bless you and good morning. Nice to see all your wonderful and smiling faces. We want to make sure that um we want to announce for this next coming week everybody is is aware of the change of the schedule. Today, of course, there's two services and brother Biscll will be ministering this morning and we're looking very forward to that and maybe there will be a part two for the evening. We don't know. Pray hard, saints. Pray hard. But, uh, there will be no Wednesday service being that it's Christmas Eve and many of us will be with our families. And then the following Sunday will be one service only. And then that afternoon gives um special time for the musicians and choirs and those who will be singing for watch night. Watch night is not just singing. We'll be having different ones speak. It'll be a wonderful evening and that will be at 9:00 on the Wednesday evening of the following week. So that is catch up for that. Brother John is in Edmonton this morning. Want to remember brother John Andy is in prayer. He's I believe got another service probably preaching now and then another one tonight. And brother Tim will be flying back this uh Monday I believe getting here on Tuesday getting back from another trip. So we want to keep these brothers in our prayers and then brother Michael will be flying to Belgium with his dad to take services over in Europe over the New Year's and we'll miss you Michael and we'll be praying for you that God use you in a special way with the young people. I think it's wonderful to see these young men raise up and and catch a hold. And I just text Brother John. I said, "Keep that flag flying high. Preach the word of God in Edmonton. Preach the word with conviction and with fire." And that's what we we love and appreciate. And brother Murphy is down in Dallas, Texas this morning. So we want to remember brother Murphy Wong. And he's ministering in brother uh David McGary's church this this Sunday. So my they go from the north, south, east, and west. And God bless the men of God that will be ministering today around the world. Well, today we have a special announcement and I have the privilege to make that announcement. There's two people in particular that are very, very happy this morning. They got a big smile on their faces and well, put a smiling face on. There you go. Where's Angelica? There she is. She's got a smile on her face. I know that. Well, there's a special announcement this morning.

Why don't you stand up? John, want you stand up? We congratulate you. Amen. No, brother Jean did it. He did it last night and I got the text. I got the text. I said, he said, "You're the first one, Brother Tom." I said, "Really?" He said, "Well, outside of parents, of course." So, we're so happy for you, Brother John, Sister Jel. God bless you. And what they'll be announcing, of course, with in the future their uh the marriage date. We're happy for you. God bless you. Thank you, brother Tom. Um with uh with that, Brother Abe Fzen also wanted to thank those that helped him uh move the other day. And um brother Richard Drake also has an announcement uh for the Sunday school children.

Do you know that song I'll soon be gone? I'll sing it. I'll soon be gone. Number 997. We're living in perilous times. Each day brings new distress. But God has told us in his word to pray and do our best. Amen. I don't think we can sit down and sing this song. We need to stand up and put our hands together and rejoice in the Lord and give God praise. Amen. We're living in perilous times. Each day brings new distress, but God is holding. We pray and do our best to keep our land. [Music] And something ring in my soul gone [Music] from heaven shining eternal joy we know [Music] and on that day I'll store away. Oh yes. [Music] And when Jesus [Music] Sh [Music] We must [Music] know and on that hill. Thank you Jesus. Come glad morning when this life is over. I'll fly away. I'll come back. Oh, [Music] I fly away.

[Music] I [Music] might [Music] All pass away. [Music] [Applause] through your presence. I might [Music] Hallelujah. It's &gt;&gt; a wonderful testimony to be able to sing. &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful testimony to be able to confess, I'm amazed. While we're singing it, I just I a little phrase I say every once in a while to the Lord. How do you ever find me? How do you ever find this planet? when I see, you know, uh, the universe in perspective with all of God's creation, I just I have to believe because it doesn't make any sense to the human mind. Uh, when you think of the expanse of universes and on and on and on and then you hear a simple statement, God fil God fills all time and space. Wow, that's a a big statement. And but here he is. He fills this space. &gt;&gt; And we're here this morning uh to to go into the word. I'm just uh taking a little bit of hesitation here because I'm not too sure just how far we're going to go. And uh brother brother Tom said why don't you just carry right on and uh if I do we'll forget this afternoon service but we'll try not to do that do that because brother Tom is ready for tonight. We're happy uh I was driving here this morning. We're happy that uh that there's uh brother John Andes is in Edmonton at brother Harold uh Harold Hildibbran's request. We're happy. I I heard the announcement brother Tom saying brother Tim and sister Sarah and Philippines coming home Tuesday. Uh we're happy. You say why are you happy? I'm happy that the church is able to provide ministry. And I had a long call yesterday from brother Ruben Daniels in Johannesburg, South Africa. He pastors one of the churches there. The church used to be pastored by his elder brother Joseph Daniels. Brother Joseph Daniels has been here uh years ago and we're well acquainted with him. Uh brother Joseph Daniels now does some mission work out from the church throughout Africa. I understand. But brother Ruben, he said, "We stream the meetings and we been blessed by the ministry." And uh, Brother Deepac Titus and his wife, Sister Vandy from India, they have been emailing me back and forth. And then I received an email from their daughter, Shakina. But Shakina saved up her money and bought an iPad just for what express purpose that the family could stream the meetings and sit and watch them all together. And he said, "She sits in her room." He said, "She knows every person. and she knows every announcement. She knows everything that's going on and we hear every service. So, God bless you, brother Deepac, Sister Vandy, and Sister Shakina and her brother. Uh, God bless them. God bless the saints in Switzerland. God bless anybody that we can bless by having a service. and uh and uh uh the special reason that brother uh brother Murphy Wong went to Dallas at brother David McGary's request in fact is brother David McGary came up and had the memorial service for brother Ryan sister Shana's mother and uh and he was coming this way and Murphy was going that way. So I said to him I said I think brother Murphy's where you come from. He he said, "Yeah, I'm I'll be back there." Uh, and the reason he's there is because there was a Chinese man, an engineer, professional man that is very much connected to a movement and it's a vast movement of Christian uh movement amongst young people in schools etc etc and uh they got their own website etc. And then when brother McGary began to tell him about the message and the and a Bible, the Chinese translation of the Bible that brother Murphy has just completed and how it ties to the message. Then the last two weeks they've been coming to the church to hear more about this and brother David said he phoned right away and said if you can send brother Murphy down he said and preach for us for the weekend of services we'll arrange a dinner together with these people. And so that's what he's doing. He's he's going to be busy and we're all busy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Busy for the kingdom. We want to also uh welcome our brother and sister Poacher from Montana. Where are you? You're here in the There you are right there, Brother Shannon and Sister Angela. God bless you and your children are at home, but you're here and we're thankful that you're here. Amen. Well, I didn't want to keep you standing, but uh uh I wonder if we could sing Have You Been to the Fountain? Take the microphone there. Have you been beneath the mountain? There's no way to go. Oh, it will [Music] Oh, have you found [Music] me? He will watch you. &gt;&gt; And before we just before we turn to the word, we want to we're going to have prayer and uh uh we'll just remain here, brother. We're going to have prayer for uh Sister Amanda Drake's father. Brother Ben and I spoke last night. Sister Amanda's very burdenful father. But he's in the hospital right at this moment as I speak. And they're giving him tests and so on. He's got all kinds of multiple problems, not able to actually walk or move around and just a whole lot of things. They need God. They need the healer to come in. They need somebody that can stabilize this situation. And also they need medical people who will have a heart of compassion and understand you know you that have been into hospitals and whatever medical clinics and so on. It's so easy just to become a statistic just a number. You're just a number but we need to be we need to have people that will be concerned and have more than a number. And uh so we're going to pray that for uh this family just now I I I and ask for ourselves. I wonder if you would pray that God will give you I've been praying that God will help me speak and now I wonder if you would pray that God will help you to understand what it is that you know I seek to. And I'll tell you quite frankly I came to the uh came to the church this morning and I thought you know it's almost unfair. It's hard minister studies for a long time sometimes 2 3 weeks and uh and and uh the Holy Spirit just waiting on God the Holy Spirit and then we come to uh the church and we expect him to unload it in an hour and a half or two and uh and and make it all clear. It's hard to get out what's been burning for a couple of weeks. So I that's why I say pray for yourself also. I will pray and have prayed and you pray where I just like to pray for sister Amanda Drake's father. His name is brother Dick and his wife's name is Sister Emily. Heavenly Father, as we stand as a group of people here this morning, we stand here testifying, giving evidence by our presence here. We believe in you. We believe there's only one God. We believe that that God is the eternal one making himself known and hath manifested himself in Jesus Christ has paid the price, the full price for our redemption. And the blood has been shed and we are washed in the blood of the lamb. We've been cleansed, oh God, pure and holy. And there is no other antidote for sin. We're thankful for that. And when Jesus said, "It is finished," then he had paid it all. And we are, he is a God that heals us. We pray that you'll send your virtue right now, the per virtue of the resurrected Christ to our brother Dick, oh God. Raise him up, Father. And I pray you'll put a heart within him to do what is correct with his own body and with his own health. I pray, Father, you'll give the people their wisdom. give the caretakers uh some compassion, oh God. Not that they don't have it, but I pray you'll give extra compassion. And I pray you'll give the doctor concern, Father, that they might determine just what is needed for our brother. And Lord, let him let his body respond. Let the cells respond. I pray we need not only human effort, we need the God, the God factor. We pray, oh God, the living God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the apostles and the God and father, our Lord Jesus Christ, the God of Moses and Elijah, the God of our precious prophet William Brandham. And this time, we saw you on display, oh God. We have been uh we've been exposed to it and we believe in you. You are the almighty one. And now Lord I pray that you'll give uh strength and courage and ability to myself as I stand here. I pray you'll give uh uh illumination and revelation to the people as they listen. And uh I pray father that you'll give us alert minds in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. I want to sing take your burden to the place of prayer. know that. How do I leave the burden of care? You don't know it. Well, I won't sing a solo. How many know that? Take your burden to the place of prayer. My wife knows it. My goodness, I didn't think it was that far back. Fact is, it's not. All right. Take your burden to the place of prayer, dear L. and care for you have it and provides our every need. Take your burden. You don't know that. I thought Brother Hibbran knew every song in the book and a bunch I don't even know. All right. Well, we won't we won't uh we won't tackle it. Thank you. God bless you. Have you open your Bibles and if you have a pen or pencil, you might want to just keep it handy. Find a little piece of paper. If you young people have a have a question, you should have some when I've finished today and just jot it down. Uh Lord willing, I'll either carry on with this or come back to it as soon as possible. I want to speak on the king of kings and I'm going to read from a number of scriptures starting uh with 1 Timothy 6:15. I'm only going to read one verse and then I will read one verse which is Revelation 17 and 14 and then I'll begin reading four verses uh in Joshua 12. Sorry to take you around in the Bible but we'll need to because there's a continuity here that I would like to get from these scriptures. All right. Reading from 1 Timothy 6:15. Which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate, the king of kings and the lord of lords. Perhaps we can read it together. which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and the lord of lords. Amen. Revelation 17 and 14. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them. &gt;&gt; Amen. For he is lord of lords and king of kings. And they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we can all say amen to that. &gt;&gt; I love that. These shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them. &gt;&gt; End of subject. And he is for he is the lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful there. He's not alone. Now please turn to Joshua the 12th chapter and you can keep your Bible open there after we have read these four verses. I'm going to read verse one and then verses 6 to8. Now these are the kings of the land which the children of Israel smokeote and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river Arnon unto Mount Hermon and all the plain of the east. Verse six, then did Moses and the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite. And Moses and the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites and the Gadites and half the tribe of Manasseh. That was two and a half tribes. And these verse 7 and these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smokeote on this side Jordan on the west from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Hak uh that goeth up to Sir which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions. How many have ever heard uh the voice of Winston Churchill when he took control of the uh very very dim and dark situation in Britain during the Second World War and London itself was being demolished with V2 rockets coming over from Germany and so on And the people were running into their bomb shelters and Winston Church Hill stood up and he said, "We will fight here and we will fight there and we will be in the valleys and we'll be in whatever." How many of her ever heard him speak that? Yes, a few of you. Well, I thought I thought of him uh when I hear this about Joshua and verse eight. Uh and they he divided the the land for possession according to the divisions. He said, "In the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country, the Hittites, the Amorites and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites." He included them all. And that pretty well describes the spirit of Joshua. He wasn't just going to go one place. He said, "Wherever they are and wherever wherever we find it and uh it will apply coming home to your address this morning." And thank you for standing. You may be seated. Keep your Bible open if you would in in chapter 11 23. Sometime we lose people when we uh go around like this, but I don't expect I will lose you at all. You'll keep your thought. And Joshua 11 23. And Joshua took the whole land according to all that the Lord said unto Moses. And Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, according to their divisions by their tribes, and the land rested from war. He said one place at the very end of the his book and Joshua. So Joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance. All right. You may look this way. Now God bless the word to you in the 12th chapter which we just read a few four verses of. Uh the 12th chapter gives the names of many kings. I'm speaking on the king of kings, but Joshua names, the book of Joshua names many kings that were living in the land that God gave as an inheritance to the children of Israel. I need to make something very clear to you as a foundation plank to the service this morning. when a lot of people read and a lot of believers even read or Christians read uh the the the how God dispossessed the people or the children of Israel dispossessed the people and it it it's it's a little maybe a little difficult for some to read if you become emotionally attached. They smoked them. They left none that breathed living. and say, "Oh my," you know, uh we have to remember one thing. God is the creator who created the earth and the Bible says the earth is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; Do we accept that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; It belongs at it says he by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth. All things were made by him and without him was nothing made. that is made speaking of Christ because that was the creative power of God and belongs to God. The fact that other people were living there that's that's a side issue. That is a side issue that would not be uh perhaps uh you know within the understanding of our modern age where we want to be understanding and we want to be uh accepting of all situations and all people and wherever they are and whatever and and I think that we should but on the other hand when we read in the word of God and you when you read in the word of God you want to agree with that that your father speaking. &gt;&gt; And when it says that the Lord the uh the the the earth is the Lord's, then we want to say amen. The earth is the Lord's and the owner can do whatever he wishes. Now, we're speaking about an an inheritance in in order to inherit uh you have to be a blood relative. I I just had an experience in the last over the last few months as I was left an executive of an estate of my aunt and uh there was a big family and at the end she just decided to just divide what remained of her estate into even shares of all the family and uh uh her siblings etc. And if the siblings were not living, then it would be to their children and and so on. Ended up being about 32 or 33 beneficiaries. And I had to find all of them. And some of them she didn't know if they were living or not. And so I had one experience which I'll just relate to you. There was a question. I had an aunt that died a tragic and unexpected death and left two children, which was a baby in arms and uh a a boy. I didn't ever never heard of him. Never heard of him. Up in my years now, I I never knew that this young baby had a brother. And they said yes. And I think that he went to Ontario or something. and everybody uh nobody knows anything. So I have to go on a search. So I was searching the internet, searching the internet and I found a man by that name. And there's lots of them. It's not a simple name. And there's some of them in the United States and some a few in Canada. And I found one by the first name. It went by the uh first name and his last name was together. And I I I found where he had passed away. He had died in 2003. So I read the orbituary and I I heard about his wife and his family and as I read about the wife, I was very suspect that it was even his wife and I didn't know and so on and so forth. And I saw the names of two daughters and a son. So I I called I called information to get the number of the one daughter and I'm making a point now that refers directly to you and uh so I I phoned and one one day I got an answer and it was a girl sounded like about 15year-old teenager and I said is is your mother there now she doesn't go by the father's name she goes by her married name is your is your is your mother there she said, "No, she'll be back in an hour or two." I called back and I got the lady on the phone. And I said, "Now they have a total stranger calling. They're already very, very suspicious." I said, "Excuse me." I said, "Uh, I gave her my name." I said, "There's a a good possibility that your father and I are cousins." And I said, uh, I have been left as executive of an estate that your father is named in. And being that he has passed away, if you are, if he indeed is my cousin, then you will participate in this inheritance. And uh, she's just listening. It's all quiet. I said, "Your father passed away in 2003." She said, "That's correct." I said, "Your father was born in 1935 in Walka, Saskatchewan." She said, "That is correct." I said, "I was born in Walka, Saskatchewan in 1934, and that gives me reason to believe that perhaps he and I are cousins." I said, uh, I need to know, uh, excuse me for asking, but I said, I need to know how did he get to Eastern Canada to Ontario. And she said, I believe I'll have to speak with my sister. I said, all right, and we'll call you back. Well, I they didn't call back. I didn't hear. And so then I tried another avenue and I tried another avenue which was the wife, the mother of these children who was not part of the inheritance. And I called her and uh I I said there's a possibility that I and your husband were cousins. Oh, she was so she was just an open very happy person. And I said, uh, she said he'd be so happy to know one of his cousins was trying to contact him. And I said, well, uh, I have to ask you a couple of questions that are personal. And I said, I and I gave her the same account, and I had not planned to give you these details, but it will it will impress you with what I'm wanting to convey. And I said, uh, I need to know that that your children are blood re relatives of of my aunt that has passed away. That's the only connection. Blood relative is everything. If you are not a blood relative of the one who authored this Bible, &gt;&gt; you're in the wrong place. If you're a blood relative, everything in here belongs to you. &gt;&gt; If you're a blood relative, the service this morning is for you. &gt;&gt; You've got to know that you're a blood relative. That I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I came out of God. &gt;&gt; I am a daughter of God. I have his I have his very seed in me. He spoke it and it's it is more powerful seed than the seed that brought this body here to sit in this seat. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. Do you believe that up in the balconies? &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. You have to know that &gt;&gt; this is not just an enthusiasm. This is not just something. This is not just some doctrine. This is not some church. You have to know that you are born again by the spirit of the word of God. And if you know that, everything here is yours. Everything we have to speak about this morning is for you. And that's what I need to establish. &gt;&gt; My aunt that passed away tragically, her name was Josephine. And no one speaks about it. There's a difference of opinion about how she passed away. It was a tragic death. And uh I haven't heard hardly anybody use her name. So I said to this woman, I said uh your husband was born at a certain date and I was born a year earlier. And uh I said uh what was his mother's name? And the phone was silent. She said, "Josephine." I said, "Thank you. One more personal question. Are these three children are they from your husband?" She said, "I certainly hope so." I said, "Well, thank you. That's what I have to establish." So now I had blood relatives &gt;&gt; who participated in the inheritance and that's that was the key. There's no other key friends. We are blood relatives. &gt;&gt; This is not figment of the imagination. This is not something you sign in a church book. This is not something that somebody conjures up in their mind. This is what the word of God says. And it says, "And if sons, then we're hes." [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you're children of God, then you're joint hes with Jesus Christ. That's the connection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this case, I was the connection. I was the one left with the responsibility. But there had to be a testator. And the one who created the ground that we're on is the testator. He declares, "I'm the owner. &gt;&gt; I created the earth. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." That's a tutony, the end of subject. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And the scripture says all things and the prophet comes and says, "Out of the bosom of God." And Jesus and Jesus has declared in the scripture that he came out from God and goes back to God because there's only one God. And and and the father of the father gave the son which the world is remembering now. And they know very little about Christmas. This isn't even the season that the lamb was born in. We know that. But we're we commemorate he did come. &gt;&gt; We're thankful that he came. But I want you to know that the King of Kings is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The King of Kings. And if you are a blood relative, you have to know you're a blood relative &gt;&gt; of this King. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I want to shake you down to you contemplate these things. This is what the subject is all about. And so Joshua gives the names of a whole lot of kings. 31. But they're opposed. They're all opposed to the children of God. &gt;&gt; Coming into a land that God, the testator, the author, the one who had to die to make the will good. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't die because God can't die. So he sends his son. He creates with the same word seed that brought you here. He creates a seed. And the prophet of God says, "And that word, the word of the prophets, are you following me closely?" I'm not. This is not some poetic license. Now, the word of the prophets lodged in the womb of Mary, &gt;&gt; and the and the and the angel of the Lord said, "The Holy Spirit shall overshadow you, and you shall conceive." &gt;&gt; How will this be? I know not a man. The Holy Ghost will overshadow you. And I can tell you, if you've had a birth that makes you a son or daughter of God, the same Holy Ghost had to overshadow you at some point in time, at some place. And if you haven't experienced it, may this be the time and may this be the place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That the Holy Spirit overshadows you and you experience a birth. It is an inward work. I don't care if you're at the altar. I don't care whether you weep or cry or whatever more, but as long as you have a birth and you know that you had a birth, &gt;&gt; you know, sometimes a preacher preaches and you wonder if it's a reality. And I I trust that this won't be too personal, but we have brother and sister sitting here. Brother Poacher was sitting in a camp meeting. Is that all right, brother Shannon? Brother, &gt;&gt; he was sitting in a camp meeting, a Bible way camp meeting out at Mount Baker camp. Sitting there, we had spoken together. I had not met the man before that I knew maybe shook hands. He's sitting here as a witness. his wife is sitting beside him and he said uh he said I I I have such a desire to be here but he said uh you know in Montana we have I think 20 acres of land and some acreage of land and we have horses and we have cows we have dogs we got some lakes on the property and and uh just finished a nice log home and we're all settled there, you know, and I have three children and we love the place. He may not remember, but I said, "You have a mini millennium and we can't have a millennium down here." But he said, uh, I, you know, he just felt, I could feel from the conversation that there was something that needed to happen. While he sat and listened to Brother Craig Boore preach, he said, "The Holy Spirit fell on me and something happened and I was changed." And when he went home, Sister Angel, I believe the testimony is true. You saw there was a change and uh and they came and visited here and just standing out here in front of the in front of the doors. I just was talking to someone. They had me engaged in a conversation. I said, "Excuse me, I have to go over and shake hands with uh these people." And I especially wanted to shake hands with Sister Angela. And I had heard from brother Matthew Redell that her mother lives in Canada, lives in Vancouver some area. So I I just said to her, I said, "I understand your mother's in Canada." She said, "No, actually my mother's living in Langley." And she said, and she listened to your radio broadcast and you sent her tapes. We sent out tapes to brother Venoms and you sent her tapes and then you sent her a church age book. I read the church age book and became a believer. &gt;&gt; There she sits right there. Would you stand up, Sister Angela? &gt;&gt; Brother Shannon. That's their testimony. You know, it's it's like we kind of are looking somewhere into some foggy misty place for some kind of miracle. It's sitting all around you. &gt;&gt; We're all miracles. Any man, woman born of the spirit of God is a mere divine miracle from God. &gt;&gt; Are you miracles? &gt;&gt; And Joshua lists all of these kings. I thought kings. Now you have to go with me. These kings, they were born in this world and had a natural birth as Joshua did. It was predestinated that they should be born at this time because they had to be in a position of authority. They were kings over cities, kings over areas. And they had grown up and birthed and planted vineyards and walled cities and lived and had their families and everything else and now are about to be dispossessed. And how they acquired the land, I do not know, but it was their land. And it just so happened also while those young people grew in the young men grew into kings who were respected. I thought they had to have certain character. They had to have certain leadership qualities. They had certain skills. They had certain demeanor about them that made made them to be kings and respected as kings. and they had a certain character that uh uh was not going to give in to uh people coming in claiming the land. And so some of them in some cases they heard of Joshua's victories. They heard what had happened to King Sihon by by Moses and when and and and and Joshua. They heard what happened to King Og and those two those two kings which control part of the land that was on the border of the promised land. And they wanted just to cross a go across their area. And God God had told the children of Israel, "Don't disturb Moab." Brother Brandham tells it in as I was with Moses. He said, "Don't disturb Mo Moab." And brother Brandham picks it right up. In fact is I don't know if I've achieved this myself personally, but he says, you know, don't distress them. the there if they're borderline believers, which they may be just on the border of the inheritance, they don't have the call and is not predestinated to go in. He said, "Esau, Edom, Esau's children, they're right on the border. Don't distress them. Don't try to make life miserable for them. Don't don't determine." He said, "God gave them that. That's as far as they can see, and we just leave that." And they said, "We'll just walk softly past your past your territory, and if our people take anything, we'll pay you for it, and we won't disturb anything." And the kings, but there was something in those kings who were born and raised and came to maturity and came to kingship at that time. And they said, "No, we'll not do it." That was their decision, and that was their fate. &gt;&gt; And so then you read, "Bring them here. going to destroy them because we're This is part of the This is part of the inheritance. This is part of the inheritance. I got my blood. I got my blood children down there. &gt;&gt; They're born. &gt;&gt; They're born of my word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you following me thus far? All right. &gt;&gt; And each of these kings were born at a certain time in history, ruling at a certain time that God is sending at the same time that God was sending Joshua to divide this land as an inheritance for his children. You have to hang on to this long foundation now because I'm going to come right home to your address and you'll smile at it in some cases. Each king born with a certain character, abilities and qualities that made them eligible to become a sovereign, a king. And many times in the Bible, you'll find the reference kings of the earth. Kings of the earth. The kings of the earth. And don't go quickly through the Bible, but that's what they were, kings of the earth. But I'm speaking about the king of kings. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's a different terminology. That's a different person. &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the King of Kings children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And their nature and attitude to Joshua. Joshua was Jehovah's Savior, &gt;&gt; taking his people in is reflective of the spirits that oppose us today. There's my key phrase. They are reflective of the spirits that oppose you &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; And everyone Joshua didn't go in and fight alone. Says the people with him, &gt;&gt; the people with him. And in Revelation says, you know, the king of kings and the and those that are with him &gt;&gt; elected and called. Friends, you have to place yourself there. You're going to have a victory. You have to place yourself there. I'm starting from your origin where you came from. Say, "Well, I come from Canada. I come from United States. I come from England or Europe or wherever more. I come from Russia. I come from Africa." That's not the point. And that's not important at this time. Not for this subject is not important in relationship to the King of Kings. Him that rode on a horse. him that John saw. I I can tell you all through the scripture this that it's going to be hard for me to complete the the message, but I want to give enough of it to you that you will begin to see yourself in the picture. Now, brother Brandham in the message, the angel of the Lord, uh, and just before I say this, if these kings of the Old Testament that withtood the people from going on to their inheritance, if they are reflective or if they if they, you know, are reflective or if they are representative of a spiritual warfare today, day then uh we we are engaged. I want to identify some of that a little bit and they had to uh they had to do a couple of things. Number one, they had to and you will have to do this this morning. You're not you didn't just come here to church. I come here now to challenge you. &gt;&gt; You have to identify you have to identify your personal enemy &gt;&gt; if you have one. And you must be courageous to destroy it entirely. &gt;&gt; The record of Joshua, Jehovah's savior, leading the people into their inheritance, they had to identify who that leader was. You have to know that this is not just a message. &gt;&gt; You have to know that there's a leader, &gt;&gt; right? You have to know who that leader is. You might say, "Well, it's God." Sorry, not good enough. You have to identify who is that God. &gt;&gt; What does that God say? &gt;&gt; Who is that God? How do you identify him? Who is this person? Say, "Well, I wept." All kinds of people weep. I was sorry. All kinds of people are sorry. Uh, I was at an altar. Millions come to the altar. say, "Well, how can I know that God, that God of eternity is a God that can make himself known? He's a God that can manifest himself. He's a God that can come from another dimension, from another realm, shall we call it, whether it be a pillar of fire or whatever kind of verbal description, but it's a God that makes himself known." And and how he makes himself known is by as he did with the prophets. He he declared himself by doing supernatural things before the people &gt;&gt; and you have to identify that who is that are are the supernatural things being identified by those who maybe rise up against the message for example have all kinds of question where is the supernatural vindication? Where's the supernatural evidence that they speak on behalf of God or or anything else that I'm going to come to a lot of things that are in the world that you presently and I'm going to give them kings names. I'm going to change the names of these kings. I'm going to also give you the meaning of a bunch of these kings because and how they refer to the very world that we live in to show that as the prophet of God has said and this is what he said. I believe that all the things, all of the old things was a type of the new to come. &gt;&gt; What Israel was in the natural, we are in the spiritual. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say, we are in the spiritual. Please with me. We are in the spiritual. God leading Israel naturally was what he was doing for us spiritually today. We're all very familiar with the scripture that I've just read and I and we're going to try to set forth. He said tonight God preparing for the journey, God setting his church in order. Then God's exodus of the church, taking it out. God's journey with the people in the wilderness. And then the last call where Joshua takes the children to Israel. Uh the children of Israel rather over into the promised land. And then the message God talked to Moses. He said the Jewish church was brought out of Egypt to Palestine was the natural church. God's natural people. God's natural people. Are you listening? God's natural people. But we today underlined bold and I've put it in highlight. But we today are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our hearts led in a spiritual form. That's what I seat this morning. And behind this pulpit, the other ministers that minister are sent of God to lead a people. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is this is the whole purpose. We're not here to have a church. We're not here this churches all over in every corner. We're here to have uh to to to first to give evidence that there is a people that there has been a a voice of God that has sounded out and said, "I've heard that sound. I've heard that sound and I have responded to that sound. Now, I'm telling you that you're eligible to go in as an inheritance to to inherit and and perhaps many of you have gone into your inheritance. But I find that there's all through the journey there was kings, kings, people of authority. And don't forget now, this is not God's Eden right now. It's Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Moses brought them out, but Joshua took them in. And this is all elementary to you. But now this is not elementary. Joshua here is the type and this is in the paradox in 1965. Paradox spoken in Phoenix. Joshua here is a type of the last day ministry. &gt;&gt; If you've been called under the last day ministry, you've been called under one who has a Joshua commission. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And now remember those three stages of the journey. All of it ceased. First the law and everything had to cease. So that Joshua and Joshua is the same word as Jesus Jehovah's savior that took them from the wilderness into the promised land. &gt;&gt; I'm here with a burden this morning because I realize there are many that have not inherited their full inheritance. that the enemy the Bible says that of various of the tribes that they drove them out but they could not drive them out of the mountains and others that drove them out of the valley but they couldn't drive them all out and so they settled down this is God's children settled down in the promised land alongside of some that were supposed to have been dispossessed and sent out but they for whatever reason they you know they became understanding or became whatever and left the people there and uh that's where the a lot of the churches &gt;&gt; you may not like some of the things I'm going to say but that's where a lot of the message churches are &gt;&gt; and I've traveled and saw a lot of them and I've shaken hands with a lot of Christians and I begin to detect They just have have have almost come to a a position of coexistence. That kind of that's the way things are and we can't do anything about it. It might be that way out there, but it's not to be that way here. &gt;&gt; It might be that way in someone else's life or someone else's home or someone else's family. Not to be that way in your life, in your family. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Many hold he said that the promised land represents heaven. Doesn't represent heaven. &gt;&gt; The promised land is not heaven. He says it could not re represent heaven because they had wars &gt;&gt; and they had troubles. He said and flusterations and everything in the promised land. It does not represent &gt;&gt; the promised land does not represent heaven. And you say, "Well, I don't feel like I'm in a promised land." If you are in God's, if you're in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, it's only promised to one people and it's promised to blood relatives. &gt;&gt; I don't want to say anything that would be self-exalting, but I had an experience with God. I've had lots of wars and lots of troubles, but one thing I'm certain of. I'm a son of God. [Music] That's number one. You must say that. You must know that by a by by not just a verbal confession, but something that rises up within. I have met God. Something happened to me. Doesn't have to be spectacular. doesn't have to be, you know, some thunderbolts from heaven, but you just have to know I met God. A quiet resolve, a divine something lit up inside and something that I I wasn't argued into it. I wasn't convinced by somebody. Uh but something inside that gave a witness. I am a son of God. Listen friends, I'm going to preach that till you confess it and believe it. And if you're not a son of God, you'll say, "Before I walk out of this place, I have identified myself with the message of the hour. God sent this supernatural thing not for the millions out there, but for and I don't know who for, but he sent it for me. &gt;&gt; Thank God he found me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He found me. He talks about when Israel one in a million Israel left Egypt approximately 2 million people and two he said two went in he said what was it what was the test they all drank of the same w they all drank in the same rock they all ate the same spiritual mana they were all eating This they were all eating this morning but the word test &gt;&gt; proved them. When it comes to the time of Kadesh Barnea when they started over into the promised land they could not go over till there was they were tested by the word. &gt;&gt; See the word and you're being tested even this morning. The word of God says certain things. And I challenge you to believe that before you walk out those doors. And that way you'll confess. Not only confess with the mouth, but you'll testify. You'll testify this word. I am a son of the author of this word. I'm a daughter of the author of this word. And everything he has said, I claim it as mine. Whether I have it in my possession is irrelevant right at this moment. But I claim it &gt;&gt; and I move on out &gt;&gt; to make certain that the world knows and especially the demon powers of hell. No, I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I will not bow. &gt;&gt; I will not bend and I will not burn. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, they are the two that went in. The other ones acquired what I called the grasshopper syndrome. Oh, it's so big. I don't know how to overcome it. I I was born with this. You were? &gt;&gt; Which birth was it? You were born with it. It's just my nature. Uh I'm, you know, I'm Ukrainian. That way won't I know I won't get in trouble. I'm Ukrainian. I'm Ukrainian and that's the way we all are. I got a Thank you, brother Magician. I'm German. I'm British. I'm Russian or whatever more. I say I have one phrase, nonsense &gt;&gt; and you ought to say nonsense. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somehow people say you're different. I I am very different. Son of God, &gt;&gt; born of another blood cell, &gt;&gt; born and created by another blood cell, spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And when it came to me, it came to me in a voice and I heard it and I believed it. &gt;&gt; And nobody's been able to argue me out of it. I had people when I was in my 20s try to argue me out of something and say, "It's not that way. You can prove it by the scripture." I said, "You know, you're too late. I already experienced it. &gt;&gt; You're just too late. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So don't get the grasshopper syndrome. &gt;&gt; Some said, "Oh, we're like grasshoppers." &gt;&gt; Well, maybe they were talking about themselves like the people who said to brother Gunther in Saskatchewan. He said, "I don't like that. I don't like the message." Brother Brown talks about the eagle in the chicken coupe. the way I don't like the way he talks about the chickens. And and brother Gunzer said, "Well, I'm an eagle. I like it." &gt;&gt; So, here's the other syndrome to have have the we're more able. That's what Joshua said. That's what Caleb said. We're more able. &gt;&gt; Yes. These are the conditions of the 20th century, but we're more able. Yes, there are others that are all swallowed up in their business or in their money or in their in their education or in in their fame or in their sports or whatever more. But we're more able. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you saying you might be saying, "Well, are you against those things?" No, you're against them. If you're a son of God, &gt;&gt; you don't want to be swallowed up by all of those things. Yes, we do what's necessary. We're going through this life. We have to do what's necessary. I'll get more into it. So, as I said earlier, God is our only rightful is the only rightful owner of the earth. Psalms 24 and1, the earth is the Lord's. Hello. &gt;&gt; Whose is it? &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; As a believer, do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I guess he can do what he wants with it. And if he says the meek shall inherit the earth, amen, &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I just say, "Father, uh, let me come into my inheritance of meekness." Glory to God because the meek will inherit the earth. You don't have to be quiet just cuz I'm changing page here. For by him were all things created. Colossians 1:16. That are in heaven and that are in the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Visible and invisible, &gt;&gt; whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. He is my ruler. He is my master. He's the king of kings. King of my life. I crown thee now. Thine the glory shall be. Glory. You believe it? &gt;&gt; I'm not just excited, friends. I'm only letting off some steam that's been building up for the last two, three weeks. &gt;&gt; A testator. Here's what a testator is. Before an inheritance can be given, before a land can be given, &gt;&gt; he a testator is one that can dispose of by will and make a testament. He can make a will and make it or enter into a covenant with somebody with one. He made a will &gt;&gt; and he didn't just speak it. He also had it written. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet would say and I will say the word of God and not just word by word but the revelation of the word. You can memorize the scripture, but you have to become acquainted with the author and not just acquainted as a friend. He's more than a friend. He's a He's more than a healer. People are many acquainted with him as a healer. He's more than a healer. He's more than one that just gives blessings. Yes, we need blessings, but we need more than that. We need redemption. &gt;&gt; We need salvation. And the one that is our savior, he is all in all. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now these are the kings. Can you give me some time? &gt;&gt; These are the kings of the land. And the prophet said now and you know what was natural there is spiritual here. It doesn't make it less important. We need to identify in our lives when these enemies rise up and try to rule us. They're born to rule. &gt;&gt; And the spirit world is a very real world. &gt;&gt; Listen, I I'm just going to offload this very quickly. I've been in the meetings when the prophet of God stood before the people and would call out a certain person and say, "There's a dark streak going from there over someplace else." Are you listening? &gt;&gt; That dark streak might be here. And he said it's the spirit, the evil spirit that is afflicting this person knows now because the prophet of God has identified it. &gt;&gt; And the it's not not just the person, but the Holy Spirit can identify it while I'm speaking. &gt;&gt; And then he and then he's afraid that deliverance is going to come. He's afraid that he's going to lose his hold. and he starts screaming out and the prophet could hear it in that dimension and he would identify another person. He would pick out sometimes an epileptic and say now it's it's screaming out for help because he's afraid going to be cast out. He he said the same thing about an arthritic case and I don't know all I can't you want me to explain it? I can't explain it all. I'm not up here as an explainer, up here as a preacher. This is what this is what happened. But now, this is where you're going to have to pray for yourself. Say, "God, give me divine understanding. Give me a divine revelation of what's going on because we're talking now about another realm. We're talking about another dimension." And some of it you may smile at, but I I thought I would take the names of many of these kings and just by their names, we would get uh we would get a a a good concept of their character and be able to transfer that character into your environment, into your realm, into this world. in 2014 going into 2015. And I can tell you that as they were named, you'll be able to identify. &gt;&gt; I fought with that guy. It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a ruling spirit. And they're opposed to you coming into your full inheritance. They would like you to coexist or just become accustomed to this is the way things are. No, this isn't the way things are and I will not coexist with you. You are you have no right of my home, of my life, of any part of me. &gt;&gt; Friend, just this last week, just this last week and every week we encounter situations people are burdened. People are tore up. People are devastated. &gt;&gt; And you know what it is? It's an invasion of demon powers coming into a home. And then he has no right. I'm going to blast this out. He has no right to the believer's home. &gt;&gt; He has no right to anyone claiming to be a Christian. He has no right. And they'll want to, you know, emulsify and say, "Well, we're kind of all one." No, we're not one. &gt;&gt; I have no coexistence with that thing. &gt;&gt; Say, well, well, you know, you're just a a a a man depressant and and you can get medication for that. Forget the medication. Come down here and get the right kind of medication. [Music] &gt;&gt; I determined in my heart this morning, if God give me strength and give me energy, I'm going to go after that devil and after a whole host of them. Hallelujah. I'd like my last words on this earth is declaring victory &gt;&gt; over Satan's Eden. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He has not changed his tactics. He tried to make Eve see it was reasonable and there was promise in it. And he'll use the same tactics on you and I. Well, this is just reasonable. You have to be understanding now. And and this is uh uh this is just the way things are. No, it isn't just the way things are. &gt;&gt; Sehon his name means warrior. He's a warrior. Not so his approach. He's a fighter. He doesn't approach anybody as some weak need grasshopper. He comes as as he's one that is accustomed to conquering. &gt;&gt; My whole name, my nature is a warrior. I'm a fighter. And don't cower. &gt;&gt; Don't cower when those things come. &gt;&gt; And we'll get more specific as time goes on. &gt;&gt; He was the king of the Amorites. And the Amorites is to say or to speak or to answer or to give one's to give one's heart or to think or to boast or to act proudly. This world is absolutely obsessed with people who want to give their opinion and to act proudly that they somehow have the answer. They don't have the answer. God's word has the answer. &gt;&gt; You believe this? God's word has the answer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; These people had to identify. They had to find out who their enemy was. They had to determine who it is. And that might be the case with people sitting here listening to me today. You got to find out who is the enemy. May sound like it's a a very pleasing or very reasonable uh look at this tree. It's the fruit is good. and and uh uh and and and and she she took time to look. That was a big mistake. &gt;&gt; And the serpent didn't try to get her to dis uh disallow the existence of God. He didn't say, "Oh, there's no God or what you believe is all wrong." No. No. He didn't try that. &gt;&gt; He just inserted or deleted a word here and there. I want you to you'll not hear this message again like from me. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That was King Sehon. Would you like to have followed Moses or would you like to have stood beside him and he said, "Bring him here and I'm going to take his head off." &gt;&gt; That's the way a believer deals with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring that thing here that has been troubling me. Bring this king here &gt;&gt; and I will use don't and not just a sword, the sword. &gt;&gt; I'll use this sword. I'll use the word of God. And if people will believe the word of God, you'll make a lot of progress. If you don't believe the word, it's not for you. &gt;&gt; Simple and simple. And then the coast of Og, the king of Bashon. And Bashon is fruitful. So you'll get it from both sides. You'll get it from the negative side and you'll get it from the from a very very enticing side. &gt;&gt; Just because something's fruitful and it's nice and it's producing things and it's a very productive doesn't mean it's the right thing. That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; May look good, but may not be the right thing. &gt;&gt; And Sehon was king of Heshbon, and Heshbon is a stronghold. And them did Moses, a servant of the Lord, and the children of Israel smite. It wasn't they said bad boy. &gt;&gt; When Moses and the children of Israel smit these kings, they were done. &gt;&gt; Done as far as the children of Israel were concerned. &gt;&gt; And gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half of Manasseh and the king of Jericho. one. Now, we're going to go we're just going to go very quickly and I won't go through all of them. It says the king of Jericho one and the king of Jerusalem one and the king of Hebrron one talking about one king over all of these. You know the disciples were called by a person in the New Testament and they were called and said you know my son is experiencing such and such and he's cast into the throws himself in the fire and he throws himself and acts violently and I went to your disciples and they prayed and they could not cast them out and Jesus re rebuked them in a sense and said oh you of little faith. Why couldn't we cast them out? They said, "Cuz he cast it out." And Jesus said, "Because of your faith." But he said, "Nevertheless, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This kind, this kind &gt;&gt; is another kind. &gt;&gt; This kind cometh not out but by fasting and prayer." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're a very accommodating generation. Do not become accustomed to accommodating demon powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they creep in so in such uh unobvious ways. So the king of Jericho won and the king of Ahi. How many remember what happened at Ahi? Remember what happened there? &gt;&gt; One of the persons who was supposed to he saved some things. And uh and Ahi is called a heap of ruins. That's what the word means. And it says which is the scripture says the king of Jericho one and the king of Ahi which is beside Bethl. You know what Bethl is? &gt;&gt; The house of God, &gt;&gt; right? This king, this power was beside the house of God. You know, you must know that all fallen angels were angels were made to worship. And I can tell you everything that looks like it might be, you know, of a religious nature is not necessarily something from God or something of truth. &gt;&gt; What do you think about the church world today? What do you think about the slaves in Catholicism, &gt;&gt; which was my background? And the king of Jerusalem. What? When I saw that, I said, "What? I got to look into that." the king of Jerusalem. And you know what his name was? Adinized. Not Melchisedc, but Adonisic. And his very name means my Lord is righteous. Hello, King of Jerusalem. coming out and saying, "Well, I would say, where is that today?" Oh, is that just a story, friends? Or is that what the messenger said? Those things that were natural back there are spiritual today. Oh, they are. Who's this Adinisetic, the righteous one, coming out against the believer, against your inheritance, &gt;&gt; saying you're not going in. &gt;&gt; Don't look at him and say, "Well, you, you know, you came from the right place and you got the right kind of name and you look all right." That's not the point. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? You got to have eyesight that's better than this human eyesight. You got to have understanding that's better than it's human understanding. &gt;&gt; And Jerusalem is the teaching of peace. To be in a covenant of peace. Peace. Peace. United Nations. Peace. Peace. Got to have peace. We got to have another meeting. Got to have another convention. Got to have another what? You'll never have peace till the king of peace comes. When the king of peace comes, oh, I want to be in my full inheritance. When that king of peace and true justice is here on earth and this earth has gone through a renovation, we won't be talking about pollution. &gt;&gt; We won't be talking about uh a a a green society. We won't need to. The author will be back. &gt;&gt; The owner. &gt;&gt; The owner. I made all things. And when he made it, even God himself almighty looked upon and said, "It's good. &gt;&gt; It's very good." &gt;&gt; Oh, when he takes rulership, I say, "King of my life, I crown thee now king of kings." &gt;&gt; Hang on to whatever you can hang on to. Adonisedic, my lord is righteous. He was the king of Jerusalem teaching of peace. And that king which is a spiritual power today comes out with the same uh kind of the same attitude or the same characteristic. You'll be surprised how many of these are almost worshipful type of powers for this and the and and the apostle Paul speaks in Hebrews 7:1 for this Melzdc &gt;&gt; king of Salem preached and the prophet preached who is this Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did I leave you there? No. Who is this? Ministries get it. &gt;&gt; Some of the believers get it. Who is this &gt;&gt; prophet crying out, screaming out, who is this Melzdc? He wasn't asking it to leave us in a a baffled state. He he he spoke that to leave us in an informed state. &gt;&gt; Who is this Melzdc, &gt;&gt; priest of the most high God? King of Salem. &gt;&gt; And the pro and the and apostle Paul said for this Melzdc and the prophet of God said that Melzdc back there you don't hear him anymore. He became Jesus. &gt;&gt; And now Jesus ascended and apostle Paul picks it up and he's saying for this Melzdc because that Melzdc is the eternal one without beginning of days nor end of life. Who is this Melzdc without beginning of days nor end of life? The almighty God quad. He can manifest himself in whatever form he wishes to manifest himself. And I can tell you in the prophet's ministry was part of that ministry to introduce to you this Melzdc. [Music] Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You young people, young ladies, young men, I want you especially to get it for your age, &gt;&gt; for the world you live in. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget this Mazdc &gt;&gt; is part and parcel of this message. &gt;&gt; That's what all you won't find it anywhere else. &gt;&gt; It's part and parcel of this message. And he said, "This MelzDC, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not from shaking hand with the kings, not from making some kind of compromise with the kings, but he met Abraham. Melchazdc met Abraham, king of peace. Salem, king of the most high God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings. I say, "Oh God, Melzdc, meet me. Melzdc, meet me. &gt;&gt; I have no love for these kings of this earth. &gt;&gt; I have no love for these spirits of hell." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anybody try to talk you away from the fellowship of the Holy Ghost? You won't be kind to the thing. Just say, "I know you. &gt;&gt; You religious spirit. &gt;&gt; Get out of my presence." [Applause] until you show me the until you show me. Until you bring right into my presence, the same thing the prophet of God showed manifested before the people the absolute vindication of God from another realm and brought it right to the public. Until you show me that, don't speak to me anymore. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Cut off all the conversing. [Applause] the king of Jerusalem and the king of Hebrron. He is still in the hands in a Palestinian area, I believe. But Hebron, king of Hebrron, the main meaning for Hebrron is association. Brother Brandham said to me, he said, "Brother Eddie, you don't have to tell me what kind of person you are." Said, "Show me your friends and I'll tell you what kind of person you are. I never forgot it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He was silent for a moment and brother Southwick was just standing nearby and he said, "You have good friends." speaking of brother Southwick and some of the people I guess that would come out or the people that we were associated with and I was associated with many many native Indian people at the time said you have good friends I'll tell you young people make sure that king of &gt;&gt; Hebron &gt;&gt; isn't bringing to your associates &gt;&gt; under the guise &gt;&gt; my friends. &gt;&gt; Who's your friends? &gt;&gt; Who said they were friends? &gt;&gt; You want to go to your father and ask him if he's if they're friends. Well, my associates, people I associate with, I say, if it's king of Hebron, take his head off. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that sounds so stark." Take his head off. &gt;&gt; I won't change. I won't change the message. Forget it. Cut it off. Well, they're my loved ones. Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Are they born again? &gt;&gt; I know this may sound harsh. You can't play games with the world. &gt;&gt; You'll play your way right into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; You'll play right right into missing the rapture. Okay. You say, "Is that a fear tech?" No, it's not a fear tactic. That's that's what's written in the will. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in unconditional covenant. He said, "Separate yourself from your kindreds." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From your peoples, &gt;&gt; separate from your associates. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Separate from your habits. &gt;&gt; Amen. separate from everything that come out &gt;&gt; and stand alone for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Says there's where the first man was called and there's where the last man was called. &gt;&gt; There's king of Jarmouth which was the heights and the king of Lakish invincible. Oh, ever come and confront something that's invincible. I was in a meeting. I was in a meeting and they're mostly native people and another brother was bachelor brother very close brother Brandham mentions him his name is Bentrude and we helped to get a little church there up in a place called Chatwin and we I came and I stood to the pulpit and a young man that was out over here he began began to react. He began to throw himself around. He began to be violent. He was strong. He was probably in his early 20s. And uh brothers run up to me and said he he disturbs meetings. He that he breaks up meetings and uh and uh and and like you know and I just asked the people be just real quiet and be real reverent. And we bowed our head and bound that demon spirit. And he sat there. There were two, three men trying to hold him. And he sat down. They sat him down in his chair in his at the back. And I preached and I started preaching and finished the service. And when he was done, uh when I was done, I said, "How how what's he doing?" And he had a bandana, a polka dot red bandana, and he was taking and he would just had he all he did all he could do is twist that in his hands. He sat there for that whole time that I was preaching just twisting that in his hand. He wasn't free, but he couldn't he couldn't disturb the presence of God. And we finished the meeting and I don't know whether he was delivered or not. I do not know. But I know one thing for sure. That spirit is subject to the believer. &gt;&gt; Don't cower. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Take your stand upon the word of God because that's your inheritance. It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; There's people here perhaps you have children and they're away from God and you hear it preached over the pulpit. I just want to bring it to you in a little different way. It's part of your inheritance. &gt;&gt; It's part of your inheritance. &gt;&gt; And just with that quiet, peaceful faith in God, God, you gave me this child. This is part of my inheritance. I claim them. for you. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Fact is, friends, I don't know anything else that works. &gt;&gt; That works. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching for those of you that may have cowed and said, "Well, this seems like it's monstrous. It seems like it's invincible. That's him. &gt;&gt; Where do you think he went to? You hear a prophet, you hear it over and over again. It's not just a message. You hear that people die. The spirit doesn't die. &gt;&gt; Where is it? Where is that? Oh, you say, "Well, he's he he's here with us in the house of God." No, he's not. He never got converted. This king of he &gt;&gt; who demonstrates and wants to make himself as ma as invincible. I'm here to tell you he's not invincible. &gt;&gt; My leader Joshua destroyed him, &gt;&gt; smokeote him as an example. That's what we are to do. &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't go and do it himself. All of the people went with him. &gt;&gt; The people went with him. Friends, I'm not up here as a as a as some kind of a a um what do you call a robot? I wasn't forced up here to preach this. And nobody forced me to preach this. But I feel if this were my last service, I would want to say to you, go after him. &gt;&gt; Don't let him tell you who your associates are going to be. Don't tell him who who your friends are going to be. Don't let him tell you and instruct you. You have nothing to do with him. And let the spirit know you're not invincible. In fact, is your defeated weakling. My Lord Jesus, the King of Kings, &gt;&gt; has already told me you're defeated. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; King of Dber. D E V I R it's a sanctuary. King of gad is a wall protected. King of Hora devotion. Doesn't it sound nice? King of Libna one the king of Adulam which is justice for the people. These are spirits. &gt;&gt; They're present. &gt;&gt; In fact is I want to say something to you people. We live in a high-tech world. Information is going on the information highway around the globe in seconds. These kings that were existing and living in Joshua's day, they didn't have internet. They didn't have the same perhaps the same uh justice system in the land where you do that, I'm going to sue you. They didn't have that. But Joshua tells us how he dealt with it. It's very very clear. Read the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; The first part is tough reading because he did not deal with these people easily. And the prophet of God who we claim to follow, &gt;&gt; he spoke of his ministry and his commission, Joshua's commission as his commission. &gt;&gt; He is representative of the end time. He's saying, I'm representative of the end time messenger of that commission. &gt;&gt; Then I say to you, what about all the other people that this Joshua cleaned up? What about the people who have identified Joshua? You're our leader. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you. That's what I believe. &gt;&gt; As he was the God of Moses is the God of Joshua. &gt;&gt; The God of Joshua is my God. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Savior. You want to say that friends, you want to be aggressive with it. That's my God. &gt;&gt; And the kings that he encountered are still present. He that's invisible. He that's invincible. He that feels he's like a warrior. He that's in a sanctuary. He that lives beside Bethl. &gt;&gt; None of those things going to affect me. [Applause] And the same prophet tells us, "Don't distress the children of Moab. Don't go out and try to castigate them and blast them and say or serpent seed or whatever more. That's not the point. Don't do that." He said, "Just walk softly. Pass by softly. That's what God gave them. That's as far as they see. That's as far as they're going to go and just pass by softly. He said, "That's not for you. &gt;&gt; That's not for me. Their inheritance, that's not mine. They can be a borderline or whatever more. It's not even up to me to say it. I don't have to class them." &gt;&gt; Are you getting something out of this? Amen. &gt;&gt; This is full of instruction. &gt;&gt; I want to name a a few kings. I want to change their name. King complex. Hello. King complex. It's so simple for people to say, "Well, I got a complex." You do. You got a warrior right here coming after that &gt;&gt; devil. And telling you as a people of God, we're going to slay that complex. &gt;&gt; We're going to get rid of it. &gt;&gt; We're not going to associate with it. You don't have to associate with it. Who said you have a complex? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what a prophet of God has said. &gt;&gt; He said, "I couldn't get the fellow off my mind." You know, he said, "What I'm going to do, I'm going to" And he's talking about another man, a man whose wife came to brother Brandham's meetings. And this man is saying, "I couldn't get the fellow off my mind. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go down there to the gate where he comes in. And when he comes into that gate, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind for having my wife out these meetings and carrying on like that because he was so opposed to his wife being in the meetings. I'm going to tell him what I think about him. And brother Brandon says, you know, usually people build up that kind of a complex, you know, just on hearing something. I have people come and they say well you know I heard oh just stop there &gt;&gt; we don't want to give king complex &gt;&gt; in this day of just instantaneous here's what I think and here's what my my opinion and I'm going to twitter this and you go on and Twitter till you drop off the brink. I don't care about who you Twitter. I'm going to tell people what I think on Facebook and all these things. Go right ahead. Just make sure you're not making friends with King Complex. &gt;&gt; The prophet, your prophet said on hearing on hearing some things, &gt;&gt; he built up a complex. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him a piece of my mind when I see him. He built up that complex from things he had heard. Well, you know, I've heard that people have all these kind of questions and all this kind of thing and so on and so forth. Just be careful lest you build up a complex. A kind of complex. And friend, I'm talking I'm not talking about just a complex. I'm talking about king complex. the the king that starts telling you who you're going to fellowship with, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When you're going to go to church, &gt;&gt; if you're going to go to church, and if are you going to listen or are you just going to pass it off or is it just a place where you kind of fellowship and you go out and, you know, chatter with a bunch of other people? It's just where you are with the young people. You got a good pair of ears. Just make sure you know what you're hearing. Even in the home around the dinner table, words can be discussed about the preacher, about another sister, about another brother and the children are there building up a complex &gt;&gt; from hearing what they've hearing what has been spoken and standing in the gap. Brother Brandham said this about himself. Pray that God will place into my heart that something that I lost out there in that complex. A complex king complex not can will make you lose something of your inheritance. &gt;&gt; That purpose Friends, I'm here today for this congregation that I love, this group and church of people that I've given my life for. I want to see you be able to inherit and not allow these natural things, be it a complex, be it some other thing, I heard this or some associates or some association or whatever more. Don't in the name of Jesus Christ bend down to it. &gt;&gt; Don't cower to it. &gt;&gt; This is not a story. This is not merely a sermon. This is from the word of God and from the messenger which said very clearly those things were in the natural and today they're in the spiritual and it's up to us to identify them. &gt;&gt; I'll only be another few minutes, please. They say that a complex, and I'll be off of it now, is a pattern of emotions or memories or perceptions and wishes within oneself organized around a common theme. You know, brother Brandon was very, very personal and that gives me some courage. Do you mind if I just be confess some things? I got all three of my daughters here. They're girls. My wife is here and she's a girl. And they have woman talk. They all talk and didn't and chatter about this and chatter about that and what I'm going to do and what I'm going to get and what I'm going to buy and know. How many husbands can say amen? I think you were cowering and and uh uh you know and I sit and listen and you know now I'm going to just be very very honest. I sit and listen and you know and so I go back into my memory and they talk about this one doing that and that one doing something else and you know going to have this birthday party and that and I think well I think the first birthday that I remember is one my wife put on for me when I was 16. I think that's the first birthday party. And I I think that there was one when I was a kid out at some other farm and I was just I was just taken out there. So I was in one farm, then I was in another farm, another place, and then I was, you know, at a camp in a US Army camp, and then skidding our our beds around the heater. I'm not trying to make you this. These are my memories. That's what I think about. So I think about these things and I I just start thinking about these memories and I start thinking you know I'm not I'm not really a part of my you know my family they they had a home I didn't have a home and so you start thinking about that you know they had a mother and dad and we were at home all the time and I didn't have a mother and dad at home I had a stepmom and she's way up the Alaska Highway and my father's up the Alaska Highway. He's working in the cook house and he's working in the carpenter shop and I'm I'm with an aged couple that never had any children had a blacksmith shop. So I'd pay a little spend a little time in the blacksmith shop and entertain myself and I enjoyed it, you know, but lonely. So I think of the lonely time from the time I was 15, 16, 17, 18. I in in a few years from the time I was 8 to 15 I moved 13 times and then I counted it and I guess I was wrong. I got to 17 one time and maybe you can't quite imagine that but but I listened to the family and they're you know they're going there and this opportunity and the grandsons and what they're doing and I I thought you know I'm not part of that. So I guess I just got in my own little world. And then God in his grace spoke to me said don't build up a complex by hearing something. Don't build up a complex. So I preached to myself as well as I preached to you. And I have the same I have the same. And I had I had a complete release from it, you know. Yeah. You still have your memories. You still have your maybe something bad happened in your life. Maybe something in the in the past. King complex &gt;&gt; will come and try and major on that and put a complex on you for your life in Christ. Listen, I'm not just I this isn't just, you know, imaginary thing. &gt;&gt; Don't allow that to happen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching on so you'll have a better life. I'm speaking about it so that you go into your inheritance. &gt;&gt; King complex trying to keep you out. And then this is this is a Christmas season I'm going to end on here because it might be a downer for some people. But nevertheless, I'll just say it quickly. There there's king economy and he's got a prince called credit card. I I you know there's one credit card. I think it's probably the best thing I do. Lay it here on the altar. There's the church credit card. I'll lay that on the altar, too. And here's another visa. I'll lay that on the altar. Matter of fact, I might as well put the whole works there. [Applause] Amen. But are they enticing? Oh, they're so enticing. Oh, and they just just have a look. Have a look. The king king economy say just have a look. Have a look. And uh uh sometime you know it was rain raining out in this country. I've never preached like this in my life so forgive me. Raining in this country and we're wife and I were getting up me years. We go we got to walk. I've been sitting here studying for about eight or 10 hours. We got to walk. We don't Well, let's let's go down to let's go and walk in Walmart. I think I think King Economy is coming in on an invasion cuz I'm going to see something I think I need. And uh Prince uh credit card will come out and make it easy for me to do. Oh, I know. Look pious us and say it doesn't apply to me. Of course, it applies to you. It applies to all of us. And then uh and then the crunch comes cuz cuz you know Prince credit card wants payment and the interest and all these other things all all at the same time. Do you know what I'm talking about? No, they don't know what I'm talking about. Do you folks know what I'm talking about? You know, I love brother Tim fruit. In fact is we've asked him to come you know I've asked him to come sometime he's able and you know he's preaching to his people and finally he says hey all you folks out there on the internet I'm preaching to you listen I don't know where these folks are. That's what he said to his congregation but I I think I know where you're at. You're sitting and listening and absorbing all of this. And I I believe you'll go home and you'll acknowledge that these kings, the spirit of them is present in this land. And I'd like you to go out of these doors and say and declare, you know, why you may have cowed to something. I was kind of born with this or this was, you know, in my nature or or this is the way I I've developed this. I say you want to really you need to check it out and see if it's keeping you back &gt;&gt; from what God has fully given to you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to pray that God will open your heart and open your eyes and let you see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he really has for you. &gt;&gt; I want to say this to this congregation of believers and all that may be on the internet. God has a measure of victory &gt;&gt; for you. And I'm not going to speak in generalities now. I'm going to speak specific on the thing. You have to identify it yourself. On the thing, I'm going to encourage you to identify your enemy. And you say, "That thing has held me back &gt;&gt; for all of these years since I received Christ. that thing has held me back. I'm saying to you this morning, identify that thing as they did in Joshua's time. They identified the enemy that held them back and gave them such trouble. Identify it and say, "I heard the word this morning." And and this is the end for you. You are not going to control me. You're not going to be king of my life. I'm not coming under your rulership. I'm coming under the rulership of the word of God who has declared and manifested himself in this word. Listen friends, I don't know any other protection outside of this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. This song may not apply to you, but I would like to sing. King of my life, I crown thee now. Thine shall the glory be. It sounds sounds like because it refers to Gethsemane. Lest I forget thy thorn crown brow. Dear people, if I was sitting across a desk from you, I'd be saying the same thing. Don't allow this thing has tried to strangle your spiritual life. I would like you to declare it. I'm not trying to excite you. I'm trying to tell you the absolute truth. If you read Joshua, they smoked them. &gt;&gt; They did not treat them with with uh kid gloves. They smoked them. &gt;&gt; They took the rulership away from them. And your Lord Jesus Christ, I would like you to sing this chorus if you know it. and asking brother Nathan to sing, King of my life, I crown thee now, thine shall the glory be, lest I forget thy thorn crown brow, lead me to Calvary. And there at Calvary, you'll see the blood that bought you. You'll know I'm a son. And if a son, I'm an heir, and I'm an heir to a better life than I have experienced. And I will not allow this thing to hinder me, to hold me back, or to bind me any longer. And [Music] they weren't afraid. They weren't afraid. I'm talking about believers now. Some of the children of Israel weren't afraid to call and say to Joshua, "We need help. We need help. &gt;&gt; You may be in that place. I need help. &gt;&gt; Get it this morning. &gt;&gt; He said, and he said, furthermore, if those spirits call to one another and scream to one another, he said, "What about the house of God? What about believers? You that are standing there, you got somebody beside you and they believe this word. And if two shall agree and bind your heart together, it shall be done. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm not interested in just living another day and carrying on in society and being an okay kind of person. I want to be victorious. I want you to be victorious. And do not fear. There's no place that these people fear these these enemies. It's not back there. It's here. It's not back there. It's not 2500 years ago or 3,000 years ago. It's not that. And you have a prophet that told you that was what's natural. There is spiritual today. Let us not as spiritual people handle it any differently than they handled it. And I can't tell you they didn't do anything, but they smoked it and got rid of it. Let's do that. [Music] Jonathan Walder, I tell your testimony quite often, and the people here might as well know Jonathan Durie would be the same. I saw Jonathan Walder sitting where Orin is. I'm sitting on the platform and I'm looking over. His face is like a light bulb glowing with the glory of God. I wasn't sure whose whose family he was connected with or if he was connected with the family and I spent quite a bit of time straining to look at him because he'd been in the meeting quite a few times and I couldn't identify who he was. Then it came to my mind he's I believe he must be uh brother Michael Walner's son. Brother Michael Walner sister Helen must be their son. And the more I looked the more I could identify the family resemblance. But I didn't I and here I am today perhaps 2 and 1/2 years later. That's why I know what's happening is is God Almighty. I don't know how he was delivered. I don't know how it happened. And that's not important for me to know how. All Joshua knew, and I'm not likening myself to Joshua at all. I know the message that we're under. I know one thing, it works. &gt;&gt; I know one thing is powerful. &gt;&gt; I know one thing. When God of this word gets a hold and God of Elijah takes hold of a life, he's free. &gt;&gt; They're free. They're delivered. And I haven't found out yet what happened, how it happened. You know what? I don't really care how it happened. All I care about is that it happened. How much support do I have in this congregation? You believe these things? You believe these things? Are you believers? I tell you, be aggressive. go out after this enemy and don't don't don't have a kind of coexistence with him. No sir, you got wrong associates. You settle it here today. That doesn't mean a person isn't around other people, but you're in another world. You're from another kingdom. You're from another family. And I want to say today to all those born again, God is our father. [Music] God gave us this word. God didn't just give a land, but he gave it to them. And the prophet said that they went in, they had to fight for it. And I'm prepared to fight. I'm prepared to continue on. I'm prepared to preach against him. I'm prepared to preach faith to the people. And you can live on a higher plane. I don't care what this world hands you out, delivers to you. God has delivered a word to you. God has delivered a message to you. And in that message is power. In that very word is power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sing with me. Now thy [Music] blessing [Music] to calary. Bless I forget. Let I forget thy [Music] I forget thy love for me [Music] to calary. May I be worthy for you? I cross foreless [Music] I for I My blessing [Music] to calary. till we ride [Music] on now. [Music] I forget. Yes, I forget my friends. I for [Music] the Lord is directing me to help prayer for some people. And I want you to I want to invite you to come forward and just stand here. You want to be done with a certain rulership, something that has wrenched [Music] and stifled your spiritual victories. [Music] And I say move out from it. Do not give it any time or any more space. You've got to at one time you got to move out and take the sword in your hand and say by God's grace going to slay this thing. You have to identify it. This land is mine. This promise is mine. God, you even sent a messenger. anointed with the spirit of Elijah to tell me these things. I take them personally to my heart and soul. And now, Father, on the basis of what I have spoken, on the basis of what is written in your word, we're going to sing the song, King of My Life. I want you to make the King of Kings the King of your life that are standing here. not that you haven't done so, but in this area, in this place, in this particular place, there's nothing outside of God's knowing. God knows the beginning from the end, he knows. He's seen your struggle. He's seen your battle. He's heard your prayers. And as you stand here this evening or this morning rather, do not be silent, but let your voice be heard to by him. Oh, king of my life, let it let the world know. Let the devil know. Let the kingdoms of hell know. You will not be under. You'll not be subjected to any anyone's anyone's influence or any inferiority or anything that's tried to hold you back. Oh friends, all children of God. Oh my brothers and my sisters truly in Christ. I pray now, Father. I pray now, Father, that you'll take each one of these individually into your hand and uh cradle them to your bosom and let them know your power is their power. Your victory is their victory. As we think about Gethsemane and the cross and you said in Gethsemane, not my will but thine be done. Let our wills, oh God, let our wills be completely uh given over to you. We surrender ourselves to you. And now, Satan, you kings of the earth, you kings in the spiritual world, I come against you on the basis of the word of God, on the basis of the God of this message, the God that has sent forth a pure and holy vindication. I come on behalf of each one of these people. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, let the power be broken. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let them come into a place of such glorious victory. Those that have lacked peace, let peace come. Those that have been bound, let deliverance come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan, we slay you. We defeat you. We bind you. We cast you out. You have no right, no ownership of these people. You have no place in the sanctuary. This is not a place beside Bethl. This is Bethl, the house of God. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory be to the Almighty. Glory be to the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Thank you for Calvary. Thank you, oh God, for the victory. Thank you for the blood. Thank you for the sacrifice. Oh God, we're here laboring for you and your kingdom. Oh God, let the people ride out. Let them inherit their portion. Let them inherit their portion in the name of the King of Kings, Jesus Christ. Those, oh God, in the internet, wherever they might be, let them receive their portion. May they rise, rise, ride out for victory in the name of Jesus Christ. You defeated enemy, &gt;&gt; your defeated, helpless enemy, &gt;&gt; defeated and helpless. We raise up the standard of victory. Glory. &gt;&gt; All who have not had victory. Declare that victory. So I take that victory. Jesus paid for it for me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I claim not just something in the flesh, but we claim it in the spirit. A spiritual inheritance. a spiritual inheritance. Oh God, oh God, glory, oh God, are those that are streaming, may they enter into this moment of glorious, glorious, joyous victory. Oh God, the world's celebrating their Christmas season, but it's nothing for many to celebrate about. But we celebrate not only your birth, your death, your resurrection. We celebrate the resurrection that we have seen in this hour and the coming of the word. The coming of the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're under the last commission. Oh God, you sent us. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Father, present every life to you that's gathered around this altar and in the seats and throughout the building. Those on the internet, wherever they're streaming. Oh God, bless the Titus family in India. Oh God, bless those in Switzerland that are streaming. Bring, oh, pray, pray, pray. Oh God, I pray that you'll bring the same the same atmosphere, the same spirit to them and loosen, oh God, your people everywhere. Satan shall not hinder the people of God from entering in.

We've heard your word. We've heard the scriptures. We've heard what your prophet has spoken and we believe it. We are here with the spirit of God in us. And we're born to believe. &gt;&gt; We're not born to doubt. We're born to believe. &gt;&gt; We're not under king fear. We're not under these other kings. We're not under these kings that would make themselves invincible. We declare they are not invincible. Your prophet has said that this army of the living God is an invincible army. Glory, glory, glory, &gt;&gt; glory, glory, we give you praise. We give you praise. Hallelujah. Praise and worship. Yeah. King of my life I crown thy sh glory bless I forget my ground me to Bless for I forget my fore. can say this is a reality. Now, the native people on Vancouver Island had two favorite songs. One was number five. [Music] Yeah. when he reached down his hand for me. But we're going to sing the second one. I would not be denied. And they say that tears streaming down their face. Why? Because I meant every word of it. I would not be denied. You've heard the word this morning. You want to say that with everything that's within you. This is with my heart and my soul and all the energy that I have. We have a Jesus and Joshua savior. Oh, what a savior. I would not be denied. This complex is broken. This bondage is broken. &gt;&gt; Let it be more than even just an emotion. Let it be something that settles deep down in your heart. Oh God, I am his and he is mine. We've heard the word and I would not be denied. Not just a song but a truth in this song of death on my soul to the cry Jesus came and made me I would not be denied. I would not be denied. I will not be the same. I would not be I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be. &gt;&gt; Say it again. I would not be I would not be. &gt;&gt; Oh God Jesus came and made me not be. &gt;&gt; You might say, "I never got caught up in the song before." Well, let's break that shackle. Sing it as you never sang it before. I would not be denied. I would not be the same. I would not be. [Music] Who were you singing for that time? [Music] Think about it. Well, let's sing it once. Let's give the devil a Christmas present. We'll sing it to him. I would not be be denied. I would not be the mei. I will not be power. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'd like the people that are standing here to repeat after me. The word of God is true. &gt;&gt; The word of God is true. &gt;&gt; And Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; And Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; According to the word. &gt;&gt; According to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Say, "I'm here, oh God, to receive." &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here. That's why I'm here. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; these are your children. It's been such a privilege to journey with them and that we have a message to preach. It's not just a positive message. That's not it. All kinds of people have positive things to say. This is a delivery message. This is a message that announces defeat to the one that was defeated. It's not enough for us to look back to Calvary and just say his head was crushed there. We say his head is crushed here. He's lost his intelligence. He's lost his voice. He has no persuasion upon the believer. Satan, we curse you to silence in the name of Jesus Christ. Our spiritual ears cannot hear you. To your voice we are deaf. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And to the voice of our shepherd we are alive. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; And another they will not hear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs it. &gt;&gt; Declare your victory &gt;&gt; and your glory. &gt;&gt; Get glory. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Get glory. [Music] Get glory. &gt;&gt; Somebody's praying. Oh God, &gt;&gt; somebody's in need. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs healing. Get glory. Oh God.

Oh my soul. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Glor [Music] him [Music] with [Music] me. [Music] for he has [Music] he [Music] glory. [Music] beside you. Say, "God bless you." God bless you, son, daughter of God. God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you, my dear brother. God bless you. Satan's defeated. God bless you. God bless you. We we'll just say you're dismissed in Jesus name.
