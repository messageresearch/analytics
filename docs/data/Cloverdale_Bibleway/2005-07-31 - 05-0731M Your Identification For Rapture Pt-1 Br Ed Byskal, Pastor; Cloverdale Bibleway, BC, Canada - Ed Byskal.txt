Brother Derek, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. It's a testimony. Uh, Brother Ellie wants to thank Almighty God for his mercy towards me during a car accident. His protective mighty hand is always ready. Keep his own uh from danger. I'd like to thank the church for the prayers this difficult time. And thanks to everyone for your visits, the phone calls and the emails and the words of encouragement. Just want God to bless each and everyone. It's a request this morning uh that we pray for sister Patricia Briner. She's got a stomach flu and very sick this morning. So, we want to pray for her this morning. And uh Sister Carmela says wants to thank the Lord for giving her strength to carry on. and she wants the church to pray for the salvation of her son and his family and also wants to thank the church for praying for her. Amen. Just appreciate everyone has been asked about my dad. He's just real weak. But he, you know, I was there seen him this morning. He's not in any pain and that's what we've been praying for. So, we're very thankful for that. Just appreciate everything that's God's done. Amen. Derek, [Music] let's bow our hearts and our heads. Pray together. Heavenly Father, what a solemn time it is, Lord, to enter into your presence. &gt;&gt; That presence where a dry stick could bring forth a bud blossom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, not stop there would bring forth and manifest fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the life that lays within. Father, this morning we're coming through the blood of Jesus, &gt;&gt; desiring, Lord, that you would have your divine will and way accomplished in this service this morning. Lord, as the songs of Zion have been sung out by your people, your name has been lifted up on high, Lord, not to just sing a song, Lord, but that we may create an atmosphere, Father, that you would be able to sweep down into this building, Lord, that you would be able to take control of the lives that have come into this little sanctuary, Lord. Lord, those out on the internet, Lord, could sing a song, Lord, and forget about the place that they're in. Lord, if there would be one this morning that would be in a pit of despair, Father, Lord, that would be maybe a weward sheep caught in a thicket this morning. Father, would you reach down your hand this morning, Lord Jesus? Lord, draw us back onto that highway, that great highway that you have made for us, Lord, that leads into glory. Father, this morning we bring the needs before you that have been spoken out, Lord. The testimonies that have been uttered in your presence to bring glory unto your name. We see the mighty hand of Jehovah working amongst your people. Lord, we see the spiritual blind eyes coming open. We see the lame halt and the withered receiving back their strength. Lord, you know each and every life that is here and what we have come through. How we we how we can scream out in praise and thanksgiving for what you've done for us, Lord. For certainly there's no shortness of strength within us, Lord, to give you praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, our lips are certainly not feeble this morning. Our tongues are not swollen up in our mouths. But we can lift up our voices, lift up our eyes, from which cometh our strength. We give you praise this morning, Lord Jesus. Let us forget about the one who is standing beside us and focus our eyes upon you this morning. &gt;&gt; We'll be sure to give you all the praise and the glory and the honor. Lord, be with our ministering brethren this morning, Lord. Our pastors, he will come and stand behind the sacred desk. Lord, not desiring to speak something that he has concocted in his own mind. But Lord, we know that the burden of the word lays within the man. But it is responsibility of your people that set present this morning to pull upon the gift to activate the gift within the man. Lord, that we may receive the nutrients that we have need of for it. It is truly an individual walk. And we cannot glean that from which our neighbor has, but we must receive personally what you have for us this morning. Be with the remainder of the service, Lord. the songs that will be sung, the specials that will be lifted up to praise you and glorify you. We love you this morning, Father, from the depths of our heart. For truly, where would we be if it were not for this wonderful gospel that had come by our way? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We give you the praise and the glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have your seats. God bless you. just going to make a short announcement because we're coming into a great time and that's called camp camp time. Bible camp time. So, um I would like to uh clarify a few points here uh this morning so that you'll be well aware of the time and the schedule starting next Sunday. And uh next Sunday morning um is only one service, an AM service here. And we would like all the children uh that are in for junior camp to be at the camp no later than three o'clock on the afternoon on Sunday. And uh counselors, if you can be there around 2:30, that would be great. We'd like you a little bit ahead of uh your campers coming in. Then on Tuesday and uh Monday and Tuesday will be just for the uh junior camp. Wednesday morning, the juniors leave and the seniors come in and we'll be having an evening service just for the seniors. That will be their evening. Then we'll be starting our uh meetings with brother Ron Spencer at 7:00 Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning at 10:30. And I'm I'm really looking forward to a tremendous time. And it just seems the uh level of anticipation and speaking to the young people, speaking to the different counselors that uh God's going to do something very special this year. And I'm I'm looking forward to that. Also, in conjunction with that, next Friday, um brother Tom Frey is in charge of course over of uh raising the tent. And so next Friday, he'll be uh needing uh about six volunteers around 5:30 uh on the guide meridian. uh I guess where you best say is um at the minute of vision uh part of the building there. If you are available Friday at 5:30, next Friday, six brothers that are on the US side, that'd be great. They're going to be loading loading up the tent on the trailer and the equipment that will be needed to put um put the tent up. Then we're going to need 16 to 20 volunteers on the Saturday. That's the Saturday um before camp starts. And we're going to target the time at 400 pm US Canadian just hey if there's 25 or 30 that's great. It's a it's a labor of love let me tell you to put that tent up. Everybody comes they enjoy the services and you know and they sit under a a tent but it takes a lot of grunt work to put that up and uh a lot of dedication. Teresa, she's shaking her head because Dalton did it for a number of years. So, we know what it takes. More hands make light work. If you're available on on the Saturday at 4:00, make your way down to the campgrounds and uh we'll be putting up the tent. And you can see brother Tom Frey right after the morning service in the fellowship room if you're available for the Friday night at 5:30 and the Saturday at 4:00. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Tom. Um, Brother Jeremy, Brother Aaron, and Brother Jonathan have a song for us this morning while they come and get ready. Um, we want to welcome all those who are here visiting with us. Um, and a particular welcome to uh, Kevin, Mr. Kim, Michaela, and Megan Wall who are down from uh, down from Edmonton. And maybe we get them to stand. And I think a lot of people know them. And you can stand up. So just so that everybody see gets to see who you are. There they are. God bless you. Happy to have you here. Um there is a choir practice for the young people at 3:00 today here in the sanctuary, I think. Um and uh there is no senior choir practice tonight after the service. Um the deacons are requesting that the blue house. It's vacant. It's very dangerous and out of bounds. So parents keep your kids out of the house. Okay. So I know we got a lot of kids running around. kids, you know, I remember being a kid and if somebody says, you know, you can't do that, it meant that I just made sure that I did it. So, if you parents, you know, your children and you know, if they're that way inclined, you just put a leash around them. So, uh, appreciate that. And, uh, I think that is it, brothers. [Music] We hear about the wars and see famine in the land. There's questions in the children's eyes. Trouble in the east again. The whole world is shaking. There's no sure place to stand. And mournful sounds are heard throughout the land. &gt;&gt; I keep listening for a different sound. The sound of the sea that John saw coming down. The sound of the bride being united with the groom. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different sound. [Music] Well, we've heard the prophet say, "And it shall come to pass there will be a generation, and this one's the last." Well, I believe we're standing here at the end of time with a prophet's voice echoing in our mouth. And I keep listening for a different sound. The sound of the sea that jumps all coming down. The sound of the bride being united with the groom. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different sound. [Music] I keep listening for a different sound. The sound of a city that jumps all coming down. The sound of the bride being united with the groom. The sound of the chorus singing glory to the lamb. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different different sound. [Music] [Applause] I keep listening for a different sound. The sound of a city that jumps are coming down. The sound of the bride being united with the groom. The sound of the chorus singing glory to the lamb. &gt;&gt; I keep listening. &gt;&gt; I keep listening. &gt;&gt; I keep listening. &gt;&gt; I keep listening. &gt;&gt; I keep listening. &gt;&gt; I keep listening. I keep listening for a different [Music] different sound, &gt;&gt; man. Have you heard that different sound? &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's not an uncertain trumpet. Amen. We've heard voice of God in this day. I trust your listening this morning, you'll be able to hear that different sound again as our pastor comes to speak. And as he does, let's uh turn to number 2545 on the screen. You are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I seek. Amen. Where your treasure is, Amen, that's where your heart is also. Amen. I trust you're laying up treasure on the other side. You are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I seek. You are my all. [Music] Seeking you as the precious Jew. I want the Holy Ghost. You are my all in all. Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name. Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; you are the lamb of God. Worthy is your name. [Music] Taking my sin, my cross, my shame. Rising again, I bless your name. You are my all. Lord, when I fall down, you lift me up. When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are my all and all. Oh Jesus, you worthy. is your name [Music] and praise sing Jesus. Oh Jesus, lamb of God. Jesus [Applause] [Music] Jesus worthy [Music] of God worthy Jesus lamb of God worthy is your name Jesus [Music] God worthy is your name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, [Music] unlikely. Lovely Lord Jesus. Lovely Lord Jesus. [Music] Let's just bow our heads before we open the word once again. Oh, dear heavenly father. [Music] You're the author of this word that we have before us, the author of this book. And as your prophet has said, any man with strength may turn its pages, but only you can open up what is locked inside. And so we ask earnestly that you would send the Holy Spirit to each one. &gt;&gt; We are individuals. And as your prophet said also, we all have that human spirit, that individual spirit. We all have that spirit. But Lord, we pray and I ask now that the Holy Spirit will come and take dominion over every human spirit in the name of Jesus Christ and a control, oh God, every mind and every human spirit for the glory of God. We ask it for the same purpose, Lord. That the messenger asked it. That the name of Jesus Christ might be glorified amongst the saints, Lord, in this community of believers, Father. And not only those visible, but those that are connected with us now, oh God, from whatever country, whatever time zone, whatever place they are in, I pray that you will fill the atmosphere of every place. Oh God, and throughout this building here, be it the nursery or the fellowship room, I pray that you will fill, oh God, this sanctuary also with your divine nearness and your divine presence, your personal presence. Lord, you're doing wonderful things and we are so thankful for that. We pray now that you will be honored and glorified. We're asking especially for the upcoming meetings. We call it family camp, but oh God, every service is a family camp. We are here for the entire family of God and for our families, Father, we are brothers and sisters in Christ. I pray for any weak one, Lord. I pray for any that may be afflicted and sick, any that may have an infirmity. May Satan be defeated at this moment and in your presence where the supernatural is happening. Not has happened or will happen but is happening. May it take place even now Lord as the believers believe upon you. Oh Lord Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lamb of God, sacrifice of Calvary. Hallelujah. Hope of the world. Our blessed bride crew. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. I'll have you open your Bibles immediately to Luke the 24th chapter, and we're going to read some verses. God bless you, Brother Matthew. Nice to have you all here. While you're turning in your Bibles, I would ask this congregation to hold the uh meetings up in prayer that we're going to be having, the entire family camp. It's always such a blessed time. I have uh just so enjoyed over the years the the services even for the junior camp and the presentations and the impact uh scriptural and spiritual impact upon the young people. It's been marvelous. And we've just had too many in the tank at bapt for baptism requesting baptism who when they arrived to 12 and 13 and 14 years old they their testimony was that God spoke to them at camp. It's just been so powerful and uh so we want to pray for those that are participating and there are so many uh I think of brother Tom Frey he's been scurrying around putting up the tents and enormous responsibility and all of you brothers who assist God bless you those that are connected and having to work with the sound and the lighting uh so we have lights and getting the chairs and everything put in. There's a lot that goes behind the scenes. The sisters that care for the kitchen. We are maxed out completely. Can't handle any more in the in in in the as far as feeding the people is concerned. That that doesn't disappoint me. That thrills me. I just max the thing right out, you know. And uh can we put one more in? I don't know. But we'll if they want to sleep on the floor, that might be a possibility. But it's maxed right out. That's what I like to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what I rejoice in. &gt;&gt; And to have a speaker, Brother Ron Spencer, coming. Uh, Brother Ron has been raised in the in the message. And uh he has a long uh I would say long time having lived and seen what God can do. His father is a pastor and I'm a real man of faith and I have I respect him. I have never been to his church to preach but I went to a church in 1978 and spoke at that time he was an associate minister in that particular church and now later many many years ago now uh has a church in another city. I can't even tell you the city at this moment. But uh we just appreciate brother Ron and uh he is preparing. He's speaking in Edmonton today. He'll be returning home and he's taking the rest of the week to rest and just prepare himself for these meetings. And then just after I believe August the 26th, Brother Zephaniah Peters from Tanzania is going to be spending several days with us. I have been to brother Zephaniah's church. Brother Zephaniah lives on the old family farm and many of you no doubt have heard of Mount Kilimanjer, very famous mountain in in Africa and Tanzania. Well, brother Zephaniah Peters lives at the foot of that mountain. And so we we were up close to it. It's still a rugged country and uh but he is a man of the word and man who loves this message has been very instrumental in spreading it throughout the area of East Africa. So we just are thankful that they'll be able to share some things with us. We'll turn in our Bibles to Luke the 24th chapter which is the uh text once again for modern events made clear by the prophecy. So we are reading uh a portion of this prophecy going to start reading at verse uh verse 13 which is the beginning of the text I believe brother Brandham read. And behold, two of them went the same day to a village called Emmus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs, something over six miles. Some say it's about seven miles. Brother Bram said it's about six miles. And they talked they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them, and their eyes were holden that they should not know him. That's the sovereignty of God. And he said unto them, "What manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad?" And one of them whose name was Cleopus answering said unto him, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?" And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Yay. And certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the seere. And when they found not his body, they came, saying that they had al they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he is alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sephiler, and found it, even as the women had said, but him they saw not. And he said unto them, "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. May God bless his word. And you may have your seats. Keep your Bible open if you would, please. Just uh a few comments before we turn to the content of the message. The scripture tells us that they talked together. I'd like you to pay strict attention to who it was that Jesus himself drew near and what it was that they were doing and what it was that they were speaking about. The scripture says that they talked together of all the things which had happened and communed together and reasoned. When Jesus asked them, "What are these communications?" In other words, what is what is your confession? What is the manner of communications? What are you talking about? Now, they could have been talking about Judas and his betrayal and what a terrible thing that was. They could have been talking about Peter and his denial and what uh a weakness that seemed to be. They could have been talking about the apostles and those that were supposed to be ministers and they were hiding in a locked room someplace. They could have been talking about all kinds of things of the church, but that's not what they were talking about. They were consumed with the scriptures and the things that had taken place and where they were presently in the word. Now, that is your that is uh uh your example of where we should be and what we should be doing and what we should be focused on. Their focus was on what was happening, but they couldn't see it. their eyes were holden. And I think it's a marvelous thing that God in his sovereignty, even though he was holding that back from them, yet he knew that he was going to reveal that to them. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself, the scripture says, went with them. That was unexpected, unplanned by them, unplanned by us. You don't know but what. And I'm not going to say but what that same Lord Jesus. I want to say to you in all authority that same Lord Jesus Christ has been proven resurrected &gt;&gt; in the evidenced by this message that we stand and are identified with &gt;&gt; and he went with them. They didn't know it but he went with them. He is he has gone with us so often when we didn't realize it. He went with you and while you were speaking about all kinds of things now they they were talking about what had just happened and Jesus was going to unfold to them what was actually happening at that moment and that's a very very important key the manner of conversation but they said in verse 21 but we trusted this is where they're trusted We trusted that it would have been he who would have redeemed Israel. And that is why I am I'm not wanting once again to speak of some sermon. I am dwelling in the last four services that the prophet of God left us. And as far as I am concerned, they are prophetic. They were actually prophetic. And this is his second last one from this one. The next night was leadership. And I've said and I'm repeating it. I know that you that catch on and you have good retention, mental retention, you must not be bored because this is not something that we merely say again because we think that you're not getting it, but because it needs to become a part of us. He is talking about the change of a destination, which is the rapture from December the 4th to December the 7th leadership. And in leadership, one man ends up in hell and one man ends up in heaven. &gt;&gt; And those are the two destinations. And that's what we're talking about. And as far as this congregation is concerned, that's what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Some are going to end up where Moses ended up. And some are going to end up where the rich young ruler ended up. And we're here to preach one gospel that we might end up in a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you this morning as you sit and are attentive to your identification for rapture. Your personal ID, your personal identification for rapture. Now Jesus when he was walking with these, the scripture says where we concluded and beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself himself. He identified himself in the scripture. Not what he had been or something in the future, but he identified himself as to what had just was taking place at that moment. Now, even in my short lifespan, identification has become a very very important thing. You people that are here today, many of you have crossed the border and I can assure you, you that have traveled and many of you have come from other countries, you do not do so without identification. You've got to carry that with you. Now today in the banks it's important all kinds of uh your driver's license all kinds of things even for children and for babies and infants we have to have some ID. I want you to think about a spiritual identification. We won't travel very far or transact very much business until we have not only identification but they want to have a picture ID. They want to know that it is you that they're talking about and looking at. Now, we could have identification. You know, there's uh we're we're all identified with a a nation or a country or a citizenship. Is this working here? All right. Thank you. Uh but you know, there are some countries that don't exist anymore. Uh, what would you do if you had a passport for Abdon or a passport for Edron Edosia or Olympia, which of course I'm sure you're acquainted with the name. What about Prussia? Where my grandfather came from? It doesn't exist anymore because the borders have shifted all over. He was in the Austrian Prussian uh uh kingdom and that doesn't exist anymore. Uh we have brother brother Milco here. He had a has a a Yugoslavian passport and uh Yugoslavia is no more. It's a bunch of other countries that have been all divided and have become individual sovereign states. And so there is no such a thing. all kinds of uh uh Rhodesia of course became uh uh uh Mos not Mosmbique but Z uh Zimbabwe and nations have changed. Southwest Africa became Namibia and Southwest Africa those passports you may have your picture you may have your identification in there and so on but the country is no more &gt;&gt; doesn't exist. So although they did exist at one time, you cannot be identified merely with history. &gt;&gt; And spiritually it's the same way. &gt;&gt; We belong to something and God long left the thing. The identification just doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Now what is identification? Identification and it's a very important that you grasp this for the whole rest of the service is the act or the process of showing to be the same. The act or the process of you being able to show that you are the same. &gt;&gt; Right? It is also the state of being shown or proved to be identical. Jesus was showing these men on the way to Emmas that he was in fact the identical one who was spoken of in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Not like it, &gt;&gt; not merely a fulfillment of the type. While those were maybe in types and shadows, but it's more than just types and shadows, friends. It the life that he was now living and walking before them was the identical one that was spoken of in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Not just a picture, not just a fuller meaning. He was that one. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like I'd like if you would go to your uh across the border here and try to go go into the states or come back and forth across the border and have your baby picture. You're smiling cuz none of you look like your baby picture. Very few carry that resemblance. But you are that one. You are in fact that identical person. You could say this is me but it won't work. Why? Because identification is also timesensitive. &gt;&gt; Scriptural identification is time sensitive. You can't identify with history. You can't merely go into the back and say way back in history or sometime or or 20 years ago or 10 years ago or whatever more, well that was me back there. No, they want to see something current. They want to see a current life that's being lived right now. &gt;&gt; And it is the state of being shown or proved to be identical. And identical is according Encyclopedia Britannica is absolutely the same. &gt;&gt; The very same. This is not merely my likeness. This is me. This happens to be a current photograph of me. &gt;&gt; I was getting a card, a nexus card and uh it got all bungled up in the office somehow and uh I got grumpy about it and it delayed and back and forth and it was just like the fine. give me that card. They said, "We have to take another picture." Well, that picture is so bad. I always put my wife's in front of it. I don't like them to see that unhappy unhappy scene. And and I I because I don't like to think that that's the way I'm looking right now. I walk up smiling to the or drive up smiling to the officer. I don't want him to see this. Very unhappy, but he doesn't know the background. I also was having some communications that wasn't very uh pleasant at the time. Why can't these people have their office in order and why do they have to take another picture and why do they have to drag this thing? Give me that card. And so it's not a very nice picture. Uh I know that a lot of you, you know, you get your passport picture and whatever more and it is your ID and when you look at it says, "Oh, wow." You know, isn't there some touchup artist here? I know one of our young couples that got married and you know by the time they get all the photograph touched up, somebody looked at the photograph of the groom and says, "Hey, this wasn't a photographer. He was a plastic surgeon. He had so fixed it up. They'll take that wart off and fix my hair, replace that tooth, and all the rest." And they'll do it. &gt;&gt; They'll do it. They'll fix you up. And when it gets all doctorred up, all you know, manufactured out, you look at it and you just smile. That's me. That's you after a lot of work is what it is. But we want our our ID. And there's a spiritual identification. So to be identical is absolutely the same. And to identify and brother Brandon spoke hundreds of times about a being identified. It is to assert or prove to be absolutely the same to join or unite with. That is what identification is all about. Now uh we were the same when we were babes, but we're much further down the road. And Apostle Paul said, and just bear with me as I lay a bit of a foundation here. Apostle Paul said, "When I was a child," he was a child. "When I was a child, I spake as a child and I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things." He didn't cease being the same person. He was still absolutely the same. And he could identify with, "I did those things." Uh, you know, we did maybe childish and foolish things. There was a time when God could even wink at the ignorance of man, you know. But then when the season came when he provided them with enough, no more winking at their ignorance. You know, we're far down the road now. The message that we have, I I say the message that we have today and the maturity of the word should bring us to such a maturity that we're not back there in in childish spiritual things any longer. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? He said, 'I understood or my mind or the faculty of perceiving and judging. It was as though we were just children in the message things are to that things that are to be. Brother Brandon refers to when we were children. But he said, "So it is in your spiritual growth or your spiritual birth in things that are to be." I'd just like to remind you once again in throughout that message the prophet is taking from the natural to the spiritual says our lives were pre-planned. I guess you understand that he goes to the natural gene and it goes to the spiritual gene. The gene being the uh biological unit that carries the character of the parent. And he goes from that to the spiritual, from the natural conception to the spiritual conception, from the natural birth to the spiritual birth and and all through from the natural life and how things were prepared for you when you came and how when you were being conceived that your mother would crave for certain things because your body was calling for it. And he brings it right into the spiritual that that your body your your body that theophony body that one Apostle Paul talks about if this body be dissolved if this tabernacle be dissolved. It does not say we will have another one. We have another one. We have another one eternal in the heavens. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you have descended down here. You have descended and as far as the believer is concerned, your descent ended on earth and from here you will ascend to the unbeliever. His descent has not his or her descent has not concluded yet because there is a region below this one. And oh, I don't want to go any further than this. This is where this is a this is the stopping place as far as I'm concerned. From here it's on up higher and higher and out of here in from this body into another body and from that body into a glorified body &gt;&gt; and from that realm to where as the prophet went beyond the curtain of time. I want to see Jesus. He's just a little bit higher. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go there too &gt;&gt; by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the hope of the believer. &gt;&gt; This is what we have trusted in. We have trusted that he would be the one that would re do full redemption and he has done so. &gt;&gt; And so he goes on in this message and said that uh so is your spiritual birth. You do things that you don't understand. You do things that you don't understand. when you were a little baby uh came to the altar speaking about a spiritual baby now came to the altar give your life to Christ you do such strange things you wonder why you did it but after a while when you mature as mature Christians then you understand it there's something picks up and you see why you had to do it I'm sure that everyone here can go back in your spiritual experience and say that was strange. That was really unusual. I don't even know why I did that. But you had to do it. It was just something that you had to do it. Your your your spiritual birth, he said your natural birth types your spiritual birth, how it fitted to you in this life as you grew. Everything fitted right in because you were made for that. Hallelujah. You don't understand and you will not understand everything. But he says, "Wasn't it strange? Wasn't it a strange thing the night that you staggered into the mission at the tent meeting or the little church somewhere? I hope someone staggers somewhere to a chair or a seat today and finds God in another way." Or you might say, "I'm a believer, but you can have the same experience that Cleopus and his friend had. They didn't know. You may be a believer, but you don't know. You don't recognize who's walking with you now at this time at this season of your life and what you may be going through. And yet, he went with them and he went with you and he is with you. But he's interested in knowing what are you communicating about? What are you speaking about? What is your focus? That depends on who it is, who he makes his self known to. What is your what are you consumed with? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it says that they uh and fell right at the altar. He said, "God knew before the foundation of the world." He said, "It seemed strange to you. It seems strange to you why you did it then, but now you understand. I've prayed with a lot of you that are seated here. I've been at at the chair or the bench or the car when you gave your life to Christ. I talked to you in perhaps a room and you sat on a sofa and before long or a restaurant and before long the Holy Spirit came upon you. It seems strange now. Seems strange now. It seemed strange then, but now you understand why that had to be. It had to happen that way. It had to happen that a certain person come by your way, said certain things to you, put a certain message in your hand. It had to happen that way. It all seems strange then, but it's not strange now because we've grown up from them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And you know what happened, and it's so fitting to you in this life and will also be in the life that is to come." Will also be in the life that is to come. The world and its life seems to advance as you mature. Everything seems to go right with you. I was talking to someone here just uh just this last week and they have small children and at 2 and a half years old less than three years old they've deter they've known how to take the mouse of a computer and to click it and to doubleclick it and to move it around and get what they want up on the screen. My goodness, that took me 15 years to learn how to do that. You said, 'Well, everybody's not exactly where you are, Brother Biscll. I'm glad or we wouldn't advance very fast in this world. But what is it? It is that everything has moved along with them and they have moved along with it. But we have moved along spiritually. I'm glad for the spiritual advancement that we have experienced. I'm glad to testify to you. I've had a spiritual advancement even in the last few weeks. Hallelujah. And you want to be able to say the same thing. I've been mulling these things over. I've been speaking about them. This is my communication. This is the thing I'm speaking about. This is what I'm hearing. This is what I sense in my spirit. &gt;&gt; What is a congregation experiencing? We need to experience this message is an ascension message. This message cannot leave you. This word cannot leave you in one place. &gt;&gt; You're either going forward and moving constantly up. It has a constant upward thrust. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And so it is spiritual. Spiritually. Now, it's good that we can identify Jesus Christ in the Old Testament and we believe that these certain scriptures have been fulfilled. It's good that we can identify John the Baptist. We know that he's spoken of in Isaiah. We know that he's spoken of in Malachi. And when he was asked, "Who are you?" He didn't say, "Gentlemen, friends, you know my parents, you know Elizabeth, Zachcharias, you know my background. I've lived here amongst you." No. No. That was not his ID. &gt;&gt; That was not his identification. Who are you? He said, "I am not I'm like. I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. I'm exactly the same. I am that is my identification. When you read that, you are reading of me &gt;&gt; specifically of me. Not one like me. I'm not one like that. That's not just a type. &gt;&gt; Now watch. I want to put a I want to connect this. The God, listen to me, friends. the God who by his own life and spirit moved through Isaiah and then caused him to say the voice of one crying in the wilderness. That was not Isaiah's words. That was God's words. &gt;&gt; And it was it was timesensitive for another season. And when the man came on the scene that was he was not just he was not merely the son of Elizabeth and Zachchariah he was in fact ordained of God to bear the life that would be this voice. So indeed he was that person. &gt;&gt; He was not just like it. He was that person. &gt;&gt; Now it's good for you to be able to identify that. That's not sufficient. You've got to be able to you must be able to identify your own person and recognize fully that that's not just a type of me but in fact they lived that life that portion of their life. Listen now they in the past lived that portion of their life as a prophecy that would be fulfilled in me &gt;&gt; in others like me. &gt;&gt; We'll get into that. I don't want you to think about that for a moment. You see, it's not sufficient for us to recognize that when Jesus spoke to Cleopus and his friend, it's not sufficient for us to think, oh, this is a an account of the resurrection, etc. That's all interesting. But now comes a prophet messenger. I want to nail this down. I want you branded with this that this is a prophecy. And if something is a prophecy that only speaks of another event that is forward, that event must be indeed lived out by another group of people or some other men, some other women. Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; And this prophecy which God God is only the true spirit of prophecy. And so God now causing the event to take place, causing Luke 24 to take place, causing two men who were not hiding in Jerusalem, two men who were not running to the tomb yet to see if what the women said was correct. They were walking down the pathway to uh to Emmus. And in their sooing, they were actually laying down a prophecy. &gt;&gt; They were living out a prophetic word because it's here. &gt;&gt; But I declare, you never knew it was a prophetic word till a prophet comes in his second last service and says, "This is a prophecy." If it's a prophecy, I want to ask you, who's going to fulfill it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are the people? &gt;&gt; Who's the person? &gt;&gt; Who's the person? &gt;&gt; Who's the individual that's going to fulfill it? If this is a prophecy, who's going to fulfill it? Do you dare have the nerve, have the spiritual uh fortitude to say, I am going to fulfill that prophecy? &gt;&gt; That prophecyy's been laid down for myself. Amen. &gt;&gt; I see some of you aren't ready yet. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to get you ready. &gt;&gt; You're not ready to lay hold of that promise yet. You need to rise up &gt;&gt; out of your doom and your gloom. You need to rise up out of your spiritual ignorance. You need to rise up out of your doubt and your fears. You need to rise up and shake yourself loose and say, "That is me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus did not say to the men these are know these are uh the these stories and these accounts if you look at them and you think about them then you'll see me in it. No twice now it says and he went into all the scriptures and the psalms and the prophets and spoke to them out of all the scriptures the things concerning himself. He did not speak about the things concerning you &gt;&gt; because I declare I wasn't there but I have what the messenger has said he spoke about. &gt;&gt; I got those scriptures. We'll go over them. He did not refer to Sarah and the feminine uh element of the Old Testament. He did not refer to Rebecca or Esther or Rahab or Ruth or these because they're left for another p another person another time. &gt;&gt; They he referred to the groom the things concerning himself, not herself. But there are scriptures here that are about herself. and it would wait for another time and wait for another season because it didn't fit then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The picture ID didn't fit then. But it does now. &gt;&gt; It now fits. &gt;&gt; Now there's come a woman on the scene. Now there has come a church on the scene. Now there has come a bride on the scene who's got the right kind of ID. &gt;&gt; A time sensitive We could not fit that if we just showed the babe of the church born at Pentecost. We could, it doesn't fit. &gt;&gt; Read Corinthians and they had all kinds of immorality taking place and so on. Apostle Paul didn't ditch them. He knew it was just an infant church and they're doing all kinds of foolish sinful things and that God by the Holy Spirit would clean it up. He had confidence that God was going to uh take this church which he had given life and birth to and bring it to where it is today. &gt;&gt; And beginning at Moses and all the scriptures, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. He didn't expound to them all the scriptures &gt;&gt; because there's all kinds of scriptures &gt;&gt; that have to do with other things other than himself even though he's in all those scriptures. &gt;&gt; Now, this may be interesting for some of you, maybe for not all, but I will give it to you anyway because it's it's very very it's been impacting me. My wife even says just yesterday she said and I don't mind just telling you it's a little private conversation but she said you are having a different approach to the message. It's impacting you. It's it's having a different effect upon you and you're you're seeing it entirely different. And I said I was appreciated that because I know that it was nice to have someone who just seeing you from the exterior seeing that what is happening on the interior is having that kind of uh manifestation outwardly. I've been observing what this messenger has spoken and when he begins to emphasize it as he begins to introduce it in the message like the gene for example I won't go over it but the gene I think he talks about the gene 22 times once in 19 the gene of God in 33 years of ministry 1120ome messages. He speaks of the gene of the of of the body 22 times I believe it is once in 1964 and 21 times in 1965 and most of those 18 or 19 of them is in the last four services. I say to you, you want to mark that down. You want to make a mental note. God did not have an Elijah prophet on this scene to start to talk about the gene of God, the spiritual gene, the gene of God that that that biological unit in the that that he has sent forth into the world to carry his character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A messenger is just saying the gene the gene you're in a gene of God. You're in his mind before the foundation of the world. And what have you done? You've descended down here for a certain purpose to achieve a certain a certain objective, a spiritual objective. And when he's done, he sent the same power to take you back on up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham uses the word identified with. He spoke it 125 times. That term identified with. He is identified with and we are identified with and you are identified with. But he phrased it in such a way 125 times from 1959. Nothing from 1947 to 1959. From 1959 to 1965, 125 times. 77 of those times is in 1964 just by itself. That one year. You don't have to be a very smart person to say God. Depends who you think was talking. &gt;&gt; If you think it's just a somebody from Kentucky speaking, then you've lost it already. &gt;&gt; But when you realize that God was making utterances &gt;&gt; to me and he's trying to say something, &gt;&gt; we're identified with identified with. he's identified with. I don't often do this here. What was happening in Luke 24? What was happening? Nothing really happened until a stranger stepped onto the pathway and identified himself with two men. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. There was a lot of men walking on that pathway. A lot of people, a lot of men, women, I suppose, going back and forth, walking on that pathway. But this stranger, the resurrected one, &gt;&gt; identified himself with two men who couldn't recognize him yet. Hallelujah. And he has identified himself with this congregation of believers. And the believers of this message, they have been identified by the resurrected Christ. I'm going to prove that to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before they knew who they were being identified with, he first identified himself with them. And by identifying himself with them, he automatically identified them with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have been identified with Christ. Whether you know it or don't know it, whether you have a revelation or whether your mind is still darkened, I can tell you we have been identified with him &gt;&gt; because this message packs his personal presence. He said we should be identified with him. How? By living for him, not just a confession. And since he's our identification, then we should be identified with him by living for him. Again, the believing worshipper was identified with his sacrifice by the token. This book's already open, just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified with the coming of Christ. If you've lived in the days of Jesus or one of them, whatever it is, just think what group you'd be identified with. He said, "Think of it tonight." And I'd say, "Think of it this morning." In other words, put yourself back. And who would you be identified with? He said, "I'm happy today to be one of them being identified with the word which is Christ, identified with him, being baptized into him, we become identified." Have you been baptized? &gt;&gt; You have been identified with him. &gt;&gt; Your identification, &gt;&gt; we become identified. Identified in his likeness, identified with his word, which is him. I am in Christ. I am his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to say that to yourself. I am in Christ. I am his word. &gt;&gt; It's not just speaking about me. It's not something that's like me. This is absolutely the same. &gt;&gt; There is no difference. &gt;&gt; This is not poetic language. This is not something that is uh some mental, you know, exercise. It is the truth of God's word. It's something that an individual must come to. &gt;&gt; It's the word that's ascending. &gt;&gt; And the word becomes you. &gt;&gt; Not only in you, but you become it. &gt;&gt; And that is why a prophet would go as far as to say she is him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She is him. Why? Because there is not a even a a degree of difference between the life that he had and the life that she had. The life that the bridegroom had, the life that the bride has. &gt;&gt; She is him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I'm just I'm I'm actually taking you on a journey. We're moving on. We're going down a path today too. One day he said there was a man came up to him. He knew his name. He said, "Your name is Simon." Came up to Jesus. A man came up to Jesus and Jesus said, "Your name is Simon, but you will be called Peter from henceforth." A woman one time pressing the crowd, touched his garment, went her way back into the crowd. But Jesus had a way of knowing. Jesus had a way of knowing. He looked around and he saw the woman that had the blood issue and he said, "Thy faith has saved thee." That's what he did. He said these things, listen close now, these things did Jesus at AD33. The Jesus of 1954 does the same thing and he is the resurrected one. &gt;&gt; Prophet was speaking it was 1954. He takes a quantum leap from AD 1933. He said that was Jesus AD1 1933 and it's Jesus the same Jesus in this time at this meeting. &gt;&gt; And it was the same from AD.33 to 1954. I declare it's identically the same from 1954 to 2005. Here he is in Phoenix in 1954. We see if this Jesus is the same. Your house number is 11:54 on McKinley Street and your name is CB Dwitt. Is that right? Go home and be made well and lay your hand on your wife in the name of Jesus Christ. Also in Phoenix, how Phoenix was blessed and how much they have to answer for in 1954. The first thing I say that you're not from this city, it's number one. You can count if you wish. Who's saying it? Jesus is saying it. &gt;&gt; William Brandham doesn't know these things. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying it. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus. The same Jesus &gt;&gt; that we read about in Luke 24. &gt;&gt; Not one like him. the same Jesus &gt;&gt; resurrected and proving to this poor darkened lost Leodysian age that he's the same one once again. You're from a place called Burr Burgess or Burggon or Burgess. Yes, it sounds like he spelled B something. All right. You're fixing to go home tomorrow. You're going by bus, aren't you? Number one, you're not from this city. You're going home by bus. You're going home tomorrow and your name is Julia Majors or something like that. Is that right? You're suffering with a hernia. You have something on your left ankle. It's a growth. It's Is that right? not showing. The growth isn't showing, but it's on your ankle. Now, is this some man guessing at something or is this Jesus? &gt;&gt; How do you do, sir? Do you believe me to be God's prophet? We are strangers. Are we sir? I don't know you. Never seen you in my life. Know nothing about you. Only God alone knows. Is that right? Just a moment. So to strengthen your faith. You do as I tell you. Will you do it? By the way, your name is Michael. They call you Mike. Your name is Pete. Your name is uh Peter. You'll be called Peter. You're Jonas, son of Jonas. Bar Jonah, but you'll be called Peter. They call you Mike, don't they? And your last names Jordan. Is that right? And don't you live at 718 Garfield Street? Go back there and rejoice. Jesus has honored you, making you well. in life story. I see you coming through some kind of a place where they're checking up on you or something. Oh, it's the immigration. You're from Canada. You're from Windsor, Ontario. Is that right? And you are an evangelist, a minister. Isn't that right? And your name is JW. Your name is Price Reed. JW Reed, I see it on the mailbox there where you see you taking the mail out. &gt;&gt; Well, you're going home to be well now. &gt;&gt; Who is that? William Brham. I say not to Jesus. &gt;&gt; The same one that said to Nathaniel, "I see you before Peter called you. &gt;&gt; I see you under the tree. I see you getting the mail out of the mailbox. Your name is Eva and your last name is York and your house number is 6136 Street. Is that right? You're going home to be well in the name of Jesus Christ. May she go home and be made well out of Chicago. How do you do, sir? you're conscious that something's going on. That is, sir, the anointing of the Holy Spirit. And I claim that that is the power of the Lord Jesus that's raised from the dead. A man is approaching and he senses something. You sense something. He didn't tell him, "I'm sensing something." The prophet told him, "You are sensing something." That is absolute knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is absolute God sent knowledge. That's not a gift. &gt;&gt; That's not merely a gift. That's a man that's taken up and operating into another realm. Listen now friends. this generation and you people are responsible for what you do with this &gt;&gt; and how you react to it &gt;&gt; will actually have a great effect upon where you go spiritually now &gt;&gt; and where you go eventually. &gt;&gt; If you think it's from God, you'll receive your benefit from him. If you think it's of Satan, you will get your benefit from there. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; I claim it's the power of the Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; Christ that's raised from the dead. You believe that? Do you, sir? &gt;&gt; I believe that. He said, "I've noticed you with an examination over the heart. You have heart trouble. It's a bad case blocking in the heart." And then another thing, you have a companion, a wife, and that wife is suffering and she has cancer. She has cancer. She's sitting in the audience now. Her spirit is moving in here and pulling. &gt;&gt; I want you serious people who know me. What am I supposed to do with that? And what are you supposed to do with that? And this mouth spoke a message. And this mouth said Luke 24 is a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Now what are we supposed to do with that? We are supposed to confess it is a prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, a prophecy which we would have no way of knowing. It was a prophecy. Listen, until God would send this kind of a ministry, this kind of a prophet to be able to go back and pick up those seed promises, &gt;&gt; rapturing promises, &gt;&gt; promises that now are not speaking of him, but promises that speak of another age and another group of people. Promise. and he would reserve it and hold it till one would come on the scene. And just before his lips are sealed, they're going to be sealed in about another two and a half hours. &gt;&gt; And just before his lips are sealed, he tells you this is a prophecy &gt;&gt; said, "I declare that same Jesus &gt;&gt; that was there that day is here that this day &gt;&gt; and he is the same. He cannot change. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. But those those phrases and those scriptures, they just run off our lips like so easy. It's a shame. Really ought to come from the very bottom of our soul. He's the same. Yes. &gt;&gt; He says, "Your wife has got cancer and her spirit is moving in here pulling." That is true. And you are a minister. You've preached the gospel and you're longing even at your age to be well and go back and preach the gospel again. Yes, sir. That is true. And your name is Reverend Robert L. Atkins. Is that right? Never seen you in my life. Go home, Mr. Atkins. Lay hands on your wife. Your heart trouble has left you &gt;&gt; and your wife will be healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your heart trouble has left you and your wife will be healed. Oh my brother, my sister, how we need to be, we need to be precise. We need to be careful how we read it. &gt;&gt; This was a a divine a divine mind that's being uh made known and speaking and go and preach the gospel in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, because that was not merely a man, I'm going to ask you, what am I? What are you supposed to do with this kind of identification? When I read Luke 24 and Luke has said that this is what happened and Jesus walked with these two men and this is what they said and this is what he said. There isn't even a remote there's not even a remote twinge within me to lessen the uh effect of that or to lessen its its uh importance or to say well you know yeah well I know maybe it was the same uh no that was the resurrected Jesus Christ and I say with the same effect with the same pronunciation that this is the same Jesus Christ and until we get a hold of that until we grasp that it won't have its uh it won't have its full effect upon you. This is not merely a church, my brother, my sister. This is not merely another message as such. This is not merely a message that came to correct some certain doctrines and and to have some more groups around in the world. This is a message that God has sent for a specific purpose. And that purpose is to take a group of people that will defeat death. who's the last enemy to be destroyed is death. And a prophet comes and says, "This is a prophecy. &gt;&gt; A modern event made clear, not left foggy, not left fuzzy, not left clouded, not left veiled, unveiled. This is an event. It's been made clear. And it's my responsibility to make it clear to you, my brother, my sister. your responsibility to pray and say, "Oh God, open my eyes. Open my understanding. Help me to grasp &gt;&gt; the hour I'm in. &gt;&gt; Help me to see who I'm walking with." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I attend Cloverdale Bible way, you know, I believe the message, etc. Malachi 4 and so on. It's much more than that. &gt;&gt; That's an idea you may have had 10 years ago. &gt;&gt; You got to get a current picture. of what's happening now &gt;&gt; and how you look now and how you fit in. &gt;&gt; We can identify with the unmistakable works of the resurrected Jesus Christ in his prophet and messenger. I just read these because you might say, "I believe it in Jesus. I want everybody's attention. I believe it in John the Baptist. I believe it in Wesley or Martin Luther, whatever more. I see where Luther was absolutely consumed and gripped with the just to live by faith. I I believe it. We hear of a shining angel that you know come to one of the messengers whatever Columbus I believe it was or Columba. We believe it. I believe that was Jesus Christ in 1954 and 1963 and 19 I believe that the angels came. You will have to believe further than that. &gt;&gt; This did not happen. This did not take place. This laid down to prove the identity &gt;&gt; of the messenger. And now it is up to you to grasp and lay a hold with everything that's in you of what was spoken concerning a bride, a woman. Because that's the whole purpose. That's the whole objective of the ministry is a wife for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A wife for Jesus Christ. And that is the main purpose of this ministry. Now my he said when he was with them, brother Brandham says it so clearly. He was not telling that that was him. He said, "Let's go back a few moments and listen to the words quoted from himself." Now, you see, you can go from here and consider me a fanatic, that's perfectly fine. But I believe any servant of God that is lifted up into a prophetic office and passed through into an eternal realm and tell people what they did. I see you taking the mail out of your mailbox that happened in the past and he's standing there telling him in the present and also telling him what he will do. &gt;&gt; You go home and now you'll find it this way. And so he goes back and he says, "Watch here." The word itself, he was the word quoting the word of himself. The word itself quoting the word of himself. He said it twice. Not telling that he was that. He wasn't telling them. Listen, you you men are slow of heart, fools, and slow of heart to believe all the prophets. That's me. He didn't say that. &gt;&gt; He just quoted the scripture. &gt;&gt; And the scripture, when he quoted the scripture, &gt;&gt; it finally came through. That was him. &gt;&gt; He's identical with that scripture. &gt;&gt; He has he was identifying himself in the scripture. You don't have to go out and say, "I'm bride." Mhm. &gt;&gt; You only have to quote the scripture &gt;&gt; and people will see that you are that scripture. &gt;&gt; They know you're different, &gt;&gt; but they don't know why you quote the scripture. &gt;&gt; And those that are ordained to life &gt;&gt; will see it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't know who I'm preaching to today, but I'm preaching to somebody. Not telling that he was that, but just let the word speak for itself. Then they know who he was. The letter of the word quoting he said the word in flesh quoting the word of the letter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we here today, there's perhaps not all, but a good number of you would have the courage, the spiritual courage and the spiritual revelation, personal revelation to be able to say, I am the word in flesh today. &gt;&gt; I am the promise of God. Now, you all you need to do is quote that word. &gt;&gt; You quote it and it identifies who you are. You don't even have to go right out and say it. &gt;&gt; Anybody say, "I'm a Christian." They're not much showing on the outside. They ought to be able to come up to you and say, "I see you're a Christian. I see you're different. I know a lot of Christians, but you're different." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is it? It is the word in flesh giving testimony to the written letter. &gt;&gt; They know the letter. Brother Benham says, "These men, they knew the scripture. They knew all about him. But is when he began to quote &gt;&gt; the scripture, certain scripture concerning himself. I'm going to pass by some of this. He says he goes straight to the word of prophecy about himself. &gt;&gt; About himself. Now, there's a prophetic word that's laid out for us. I'm interested in in the word that's laid out for you. the prophetic word seed that's laid out see the church world today and Christianity today and even within the message we can get consumed with taken up and and trying to instruct the people about your life right now and and your you know to have things better socially or have things better financially or all kinds of counseling that way I'm interested in one thing I'm interested in finding those seed promises which have been identified by this messenger for this hour for my ascension. I want out of here. &gt;&gt; Do you want out of here? &gt;&gt; I believe that that ministry was sent to identify those specific scriptures that are to be laid a hold of by the believing bride of Jesus Christ. And that power has the word to ascend you out of here. The same God that brought you here in this descent is the same God that's going to take you out of here. And he already laid everything out. &gt;&gt; He laid the vegetables out. He laid all the fruit out. He laid everything out that you need to sustain this body. And he laid everything out here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you need for that body. &gt;&gt; And for that that next realm, that next life, that next place. &gt;&gt; Amen. that he spoke so much about. &gt;&gt; Now, let me go quickly because I've got to bypass some for our our limitation of time. David, he said, and it was Christ. Now, notice, please, it was Christ in David. It wasn't David going through a dark spell. It wasn't David. God may have allowed circumstances to come and he what is happening in my life etc etc and then something comes over me he cries out all my bones they stare at me him &gt;&gt; he thought it was personal but it was Christ in him speaking a prophecy of a future age &gt;&gt; and Jesus went back to those and gave. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He went back to those and the prophet brings all kinds of he said in Zachchariah he was forsaken of his disciples in Psalms 35:11. He was accused by false witnesses. David thought he was speaking of himself. He said Isaiah 53 and7 he was dumb before his accusers. Isaiah 50 and6 they scourged him. The prophet said Psalms 22, he was to cry on the cross and and here is Psalms 22. David saying, "My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? Me." He thought it was him. It was a prophecy for another time. &gt;&gt; Two men on the way to Emmas. They're going through a time of questioning what we've believed and what we have happened. And we're communing together. and were speaking about these things. It wasn't them. They were speaking of another time. &gt;&gt; And then the same David in and he in in the 27th chapter, he says, "Oh, one thing I've desired of the Lord." &gt;&gt; He was speaking prophetically of another people that were to come in this time. And God would send a prophet and go back to that prophecy and say, "That's you." &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble, that was Christ in him answering in prophetic way, answering to the to the fulfillment now that's in you. He gave the prophecy Christ in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble, he'll hide me. In Psalms 22, he's speaking of the bridegroom. In Psalms 27, he's speaking about his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus on the way to Emmas did not go back to Psalms 27, I guarantee you &gt;&gt; and say to them, "In the time of trouble, he'll hide me in this pavilion." That wouldn't have fit. That would not have fit. They'd look at it and say, "That's that somehow that's not the same identification." But when he spoke to them of the prophecies concerning himself, &gt;&gt; and their eyes were opened in the time of trouble. And in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall put me upon a rock. speaking of his wife. The message is full of prophecies. Enoch. Enoch. I don't care what church you came from. I don't care what background you have. I will say presumptuously and with great confidence, you never had another person except this messenger tell you Enoch spoke of you. &gt;&gt; You never had another messenger take his life and tie it and say and tie it up with Jude and say the seventh from Adam. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That starts to speak to us. The seventh from Adam. And the same messenger says, "You're in the seventh church age. You're the seventh from the second Adam, Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; By faith, Enoch was translated. But before he was translated, he had this testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; And we have one now. He could only do that by God's. There was nothing in his flesh. Nothing in the flesh of Enoch. He was Christ and Enoch. &gt;&gt; And Enoch was not speaking of the groom. He was speaking of the bride of the wife. &gt;&gt; And so it's Christ and Enoch. And when Christ came, God signified by a voice from heaven, "Thou art my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Hallelujah. In whom I'm well pleased. And the Apostle Paul, his messenger, oh my, I have so much to say. Help me out. &gt;&gt; His Apostle Paul comes after he met him on the road to Damascus and tells the Ephesians, what is Ephesians? Our inheritance book. Our inheritance is your inheritance. Are you going to claim your inheritance? You are accepted in the beloved. Hallelujah. And he was well pleasing. Amen. It's not what you can do or what you can achieve. Your righteousness is as filthy rags. &gt;&gt; You can do absolutely everything right that will not please God. And this is no allowance for sin. I'm not saying that. But there's no way you can achieve it. We are accepted in the beloved. He's already been accepted. God has already accepted you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Enoch, he walked with God. I'd like to just bring a little something out before we go on. Enoch had two life test. He testified of two lives. He had a he had a natural life force in him that gave birth to Methuselah. So the life that was in him, one life that he testified to was not going to break could not break the 1,000 day &gt;&gt; season. &gt;&gt; But he had another life in him &gt;&gt; that could break it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a life. This mortal life, it cannot break it. Methuselah lived 969 years but could not break the thousand year. Uh God in the day thou eatest in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die and no man could live beyond the thousand-year day. So he got near to it and it was Methuselah who gave expression of that life. Methuselah gave the seed that brought for I'm sorry, Enoch brought forth the seed that brought forth Methuselah. And the year Methuselah died, the flood came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God testifying that even that life that come out of him is not going into judgment. &gt;&gt; It's not going into judgment. &gt;&gt; We're giving testimony to two lives. &gt;&gt; If the Lord Jesus doesn't come and change these bodies by a transformation of changing the atoms and changing this body, we'll go to the dust of the earth. But we shall not come into judgment. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on him is passed. &gt;&gt; From judgment unto life. &gt;&gt; And the bride. Enoch was prophesying of the bride that would be changed and and and pleasing to God and would be caught up. And God, the scripture says, and God took him. &gt;&gt; Amen. a prophecy. &gt;&gt; He was laying down a prophecy with his life and it would lay sealed up. Oh my. I'd like to just get so he could almost shake everybody see it. Do you see it? Look into your eyes. Are you getting it? He was laying out a prophecy in his life and it laid sealed for all these centuries until the end time. No preacher, no theologian, no Bible school, nobody could ever uncover. And then comes a messenger and says, "This is you." &gt;&gt; It's not like you. It's not just a type. This is you. &gt;&gt; That was Christ in him in prophetic form. It's Christ in you in fulfillment form. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, you think I'm excited? How you want to see me on the streets of glory? I tell you, I'm going to sing and shout and dance about. Hallelujah. And the lamb will dry our tears. Oh, surely we have something we can be enthused about and rejoice over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You have to help me out. I'm not near over, but I'm going to close. Brother Lance is preaching tonight. Amen. I want to give him all the time and give you time to rest. Let him come on this evening and preach what God has laid on his heart. I've got great confidence in the leadership of the Holy Spirit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And I'll just close with this because I I did make a small reference to it. Abraham and Sarah. Now, I said I'd like to have taken you a few moments ago. Now, I really would like to just shake you as I have I got your attention. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so many. I'd love to talk about Rahab and Ruth and some of these, but I'm going to talk about Abraham and Sarah just as I come to a con conclusion. To me, it's so marvelous. No one ever before. I heard all kinds of preachers. I've heard hundreds. I've heard thousands of sermons. I never heard anybody. Just take from the scripture and it shows so clearly. Abraham and Sarah were made youthful again. Youthful be able to bring forth the son. The son was him. &gt;&gt; But there is another son, the same son that is to return. He says, "I won't leave you comfortless. I will come to you." Jesus said in John 14, I like to take these scriptures now. I like to take them in the context of the last four services. He said, we're in Luke 24. He said in last night's service. Last night he said in my father's house. Now just so it comes down real tight. I might overemphasize it but the same one almost 2,000 years ago. 2,000 years ago. This Jesus. Brother Brad said he's the same one 1954. I say he's the same one 2005. And 2,000 years ago, he said to his little group of disciples, "In my father's house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you, and I will come again and receive you to myself." Not coming the next day or not coming just after the resurrection. I will come because he's looking on down the road to Luke 17:30. In the day when I, the son of man, will be revealed, I'll come again &gt;&gt; and I'll receive you to myself. Not that I will come to yourself. I will come again to receive you to myself. &gt;&gt; I've come this time to be here and back over here. He's only got a few hours and his lips are going to be sealed and he's going to go to the cross and he's not going to speak anymore. And he's in he's actually in the Passover chamber right now. He's just saying his last words. I'm going to prepare a place, but then I will come again and I'll receive you to my place. And 2,000 years later, here comes one saying, "I'll prove that he's resurrected tonight. You're JW Reed and you come from a certain city and you're a minister and your wife is sitting out here in the audience and she's dying with cancer. Proving the identification that it's not another one. It's not a seventh grade hillbilly from Kentucky. He's proving he's the same identical person. &gt;&gt; And the life that was there is now here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we have moved a little further in the message. We've moved a little further realizing it's coming on us. I feel like I feel like Cleopus. It's dawning on us. &gt;&gt; He's speaking about me. &gt;&gt; He's speaking about us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've moved just a little further and we're the ones that have been walking &gt;&gt; and reasoning and communing and not realizing who is with us. &gt;&gt; But he indeed must make it known to us. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. 2,000 years ago. And now &gt;&gt; and now it's dawning on us. We are the fulfillment. They laid out that prophecy. And I'm I I'm I am coming to a close. And now here's here's Sarah. And here's Abraham. And they've been waiting for 25 years. They're not 2,000 years ago. They're maybe 4,000 years ago. And Abraham's body is dead. And Sarah's womb is dead. Milk veins all dried up. And one comes. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; One comes to him. One comes to him in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; But it was Elohim. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Abraham had the revelation, Lord. &gt;&gt; See three, but he says, Lord, &gt;&gt; my Lord, don't count on stop here. He had the same Oh, listen to me. The same character. He didn't have a whole lot to offer. He had the same character that the two men on the way to Emmas said when Jesus was going to pass by and go on by. Don't go. It's evening. Stop in and stay. &gt;&gt; And they and they communed with them. And 4,000 years ago, the same one, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came walking across the sand in another body at another season to another man, the father of the faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Well, I feel beside myself, friends. &gt;&gt; And God himself came down from the eternities. Are you listening? God himself came down from the eternities to lay down a prophecy &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; For you. You should look up and say, "Oh, Elohim, Almighty God, you mean you came down from the eternities and laid out a prophecy so that you would send a prophet in my time and reach back there and take that seed word and bring it forward and say to you, "Believe. &gt;&gt; Believe." All you need to do is believe it &gt;&gt; and you shall go into this ascension &gt;&gt; and God himself laid out a prophecy. Then came a prophet in the end time and interpreted the prophecy &gt;&gt; so you could believe the interpretation and receive what was intended. &gt;&gt; Oh friends. Oh friends, I tell you, I'm ready to go. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to leave. &gt;&gt; In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, &gt;&gt; these bodies shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My precious brothers and sisters in Christ, my precious ones that we've walked together with, don't get too attached to this because it's passing away. And it's passing away very suddenly. But we have a kingdom that shall never pass away. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And God has already sent the oh already sent the camels. &gt;&gt; I won't get into Rebecca. &gt;&gt; The messenger Eleazar &gt;&gt; already came with the word to take you back. Eleazar brought the camels &gt;&gt; to ride her back &gt;&gt; right into the presence of her Isaac. &gt;&gt; The prophet messenger came with the word. &gt;&gt; The interpretation of the prophetic word that camel's a power a power. It's a beast. It's a power only a power. And the prophet came with the word that has the power &gt;&gt; to take you back to Isaac. &gt;&gt; Once again, he said, "I'll come and take you to my place." &gt;&gt; The scriptur is perfect. &gt;&gt; Isaac didn't come to her place. She went to his place. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; It just seems like revelation just coming. Oh, my brother, my sister, isn't it wonderful? Oh, how we thank him. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; This is a word in our season. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced of that. It's a word in our season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for you where you are today. &gt;&gt; July the 31st, 2005. This word is for this congregation and all who may hear it today. &gt;&gt; This is where we're at. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just feel beside myself. &gt;&gt; I just feel I caught away in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Don't know how to end a service. Don't know how to bring it to a close. Maybe we shouldn't bring it to a close. Maybe ought to just go on and go on. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just stand. Let's just worship him, shall we? I'd love for you just to take your liberty and and uh make love to him and thank him for this glorious thing that he's done. &gt;&gt; Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful &gt;&gt; is my Savior's love to me. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; How marvelous, how marvelous. How glorious, oh God, is your works. To the children of men. Oh, how you knew them and you knew us. You know us. You know me. You know each one. You know each person. Blessed be your name. Blessed be your name. Could we sing? I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinner's name. I will praise him. Oh, I will praise him. Praise [Music] &gt;&gt; the lamb for sinners, slain [Music] and give him glory. [Music] be for his blood has washed away each day. Let's lift it up to him once again. Oh, now I will praise him. Yes, I will praise him. Praise The lamb for sinners slain and glory all be for his blood has washed away. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. I love worshiping. I love singing about him. Oh my. Glory. Do you want to hurry home or you want to just stay in his presence a little bit? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it once again, shall we? I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners. Give him glory all for his blood. [Music] Hallelujah. Wonder if we can just sing only believe only believe. Sister Marianne Gleor, it is our prayer, your friend.

Calary [Music] extend the borders of thy government [Music] for thy And here is how [Music] Lord Glory [Music] Send the Lord my heart for me. [Music] for thou art [Music] me. Let's just close a word of prayer. Lord, our hearts are stirred. &gt;&gt; For we can truly say like those that were on the road to Emmas, our hearts do burn within us. Lord, there's a burning taking place. But not just a burning. There's a yearning, a yearning for more of you, Lord, to come to Father's house, to be like Rebecca of old, Lord, to come into the presence of Isaac. There's something moving, Lord. And father, if there's those here that haven't experienced that, I say move on their soul. Move on their soul, Lord, this morning. Let the word of God have that effect. Move us, Lord. We feel that we've heard the voice of God saying, "Come up higher." We feel it within our own hearts and our own lives. There's something taking place and we love you for it. We thank you for your servant, Lord. We pray, God, that you'll pour back the strength, Lord. It takes a lot, Lord, to unbburden a soul. But God, I pray, Lord, whatever's been poured out, you'll pour back abundantly upon his life. Father, Lord, we're just asking that you'll go with the saints individually. May they realize the presence of God has not departed, but Lord, it's even naive even in thy mouth as they will speak upon these things. And as they return, speak again through our dear brother Lance. Lord, love the gift, love the vessel. We pray God you'll anoint it and Father that you'll have your way within our lives. We pray bless your people. Bless them abundantly as they go their way now in Jesus name. Amen. God be with you saints. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music]
