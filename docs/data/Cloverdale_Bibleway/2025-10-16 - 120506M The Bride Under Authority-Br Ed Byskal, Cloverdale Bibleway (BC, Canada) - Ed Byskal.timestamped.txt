[16:06] and anything else before the Lord. Amen.

[17:30] is so true. We want to come into your
[17:32] presence, Lord.
[17:34] We want to come into your house, Lord,
[17:36] with our heads bowed and our prayers
[17:39] coming up like odors before your throne.
[17:42] Pray the Holy Spirit would just move
[17:43] upon every soul that's here. Take
[17:46] captive all of our hearts together.
[17:49] Lord, we just want to thank you and
[17:52] praise you for this opportunity to call
[17:54] you our father, our savior, to know that
[17:58] you know all about our needs even before
[18:00] we ask. But you're looking to our faith
[18:02] today, Lord. And many hands are lifted
[18:05] up throughout the service out on the
[18:08] internet, Lord. Hearts are lifting up
[18:10] their hands. We want that divine
[18:13] connection in your presence where you
[18:16] can come down and minister sovereignly,
[18:18] supernaturally. Lord,
[18:22] your wonderful savior. Lord, we just
[18:25] come with our hearts open today, asking
[18:28] forgiveness of our sins or anything that
[18:31] would hinder any life that's here. As a
[18:34] family, as a body, we're here bearing
[18:36] one another's burdens, lifting up the
[18:38] weak, praying for one another, having
[18:42] grace for one another, having love for
[18:45] one another. We're reaching beyond our
[18:48] own needs and our own sphere. We're
[18:50] reaching into one another's hearts,
[18:53] carrying one another, Lord, as you
[18:55] carried us, Lord. May the power of God
[18:58] be released today in the services
[19:01] throughout this whole day. Lord, as we
[19:03] wait reverently and and yet freely from
[19:06] our hearts, we want to give ourselves.
[19:08] Cover us with your blood, Lord Jesus.
[19:11] May today be a wonderful time of you
[19:13] speaking to your people. May
[19:16] supernatural things work in our souls,
[19:19] work in our spirits, Lord. As oh God, is
[19:22] even yesterday reading going beyond the
[19:25] curtain of time and your prophet
[19:27] speaking about a young lady who Lord
[19:30] you, your prophet had the time to go out
[19:32] and catch your spirit that was wondering
[19:35] and a young man who his spirit had
[19:38] wondered, but your word caught them,
[19:40] Lord, and brought them back.
[19:43] There's needs and bodies, Lord, that the
[19:45] physician is here and we're here and our
[19:48] whole lives are before you, God. And
[19:50] would you go out after hearts, Lord, and
[19:54] may your love win them back to you, God.
[19:57] We want to worship you today, God. We
[19:59] want to lift up these hands and open up
[20:02] these mouths, Lord. We don't want
[20:04] nothing hindering us at the river.
[20:08] We're getting rapture ready, Lord. Bless
[20:11] our pastor, Lord. And Lord, even Brother
[20:13] Frank Fletcher, God, with these kidney
[20:16] stones. We pray that you dissolve them,
[20:18] Lord. Minister to our brother Frank
[20:21] Fletcher, a veteran warrior, one of our
[20:25] brothers. Oh God, we have a new body
[20:28] waiting. And as we toil in this body and
[20:30] as all of us get older, we need your
[20:33] grace. We need your mercy, God. go to
[20:36] the Langley Hospital, Lord, and be with
[20:39] our brother Frank today, God. Let him
[20:41] know that our prayers are with him,
[20:43] Lord. And let your angels be his
[20:46] comfort. And may ministering spirits
[20:49] guide his heart. Guide all of our hearts
[20:51] today, Lord, for your perfect will to be
[20:54] done in earth, Lord, as it is in heaven.
[20:57] We want to thank you for answering
[20:58] prayers. Every prayer and every heart's
[21:01] cry, we give you today in Jesus name.
[21:06] Amen.

[21:15] seats.

[21:23] announcements.

[21:27] cleaned this next week. All clothing and
[21:30] lost and found items left in the
[21:32] fellowship hall after today will be
[21:34] donated to charity. So, if you could
[21:37] take a look through there, even if
[21:38] you're not sure if you're missing
[21:39] anything, cuz it won't be there after
[21:42] this week. And also, we want to make a
[21:44] reminder for the young people's choir uh
[21:46] today at 3:00. And um is next Sunday
[21:50] Mother's Day? Is that right? So, next
[21:52] Sunday we will not have a 3:00 choir
[21:54] practice, but if we could just have the
[21:55] young people at 4:00 next week just to
[21:57] rehearse the songs for the meetings. So,
[21:59] 3:00 today and then next Sunday we'll
[22:02] just have a brief practice at 4:00
[22:03] before the service. So, we hope to not

[35:39] choir. Thank you.
[35:46] Hallelujah.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Perhaps I'll just have you take your
[35:52] seats for a moment.
[35:59] Thank you for being here. Everyone, it
[36:02] means a great deal for us to be
[36:05] together,
[36:08] &gt;&gt; not failing to assemble ourselves
[36:09] together. And the more so as we see the
[36:11] day approaching,
[36:13] &gt;&gt; we certainly see the day approaching.
[36:15] Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And so we're here
[36:18] as part of our inner desire and hunger
[36:23] to not just be together. This isn't just
[36:26] a social event. There's a spiritual
[36:28] event.
[36:30] Two weeks from today will be the
[36:31] anniversary meeting and two weeks from
[36:35] Friday. Friday's already passed so we
[36:37] have less than two weeks will be the
[36:39] first service on Friday.
[36:42] uh we have uh kind of a compounded
[36:47] situation which happens uh on our long
[36:50] weekend. Number one, it is a long
[36:51] weekend and number two, it's the
[36:54] beginning of the or at least I don't
[36:56] know whether it's the beginning or not,
[36:57] but the Cloverdale rodeo is on and uh
[37:02] that makes a kind of a a double problem
[37:06] at the border. So, I want to say this
[37:09] two things. Number one,
[37:12] for those of you who wish you could stay
[37:14] over so you're not having to cross the
[37:18] border in case it's long, I will give
[37:20] you a few details what I think is a
[37:23] better time and a bad time.
[37:27] But for those of you that could stay
[37:29] over and you want to just bring a night
[37:30] bag or something, we're going to ask the
[37:33] congregation and everybody that would
[37:36] have a uh extra bedroom or spare room
[37:39] where you could have a couple or have uh
[37:43] uh singles over or whatever. If you
[37:46] would just please call the office and
[37:49] let us know if you'd have a room uh or
[37:53] you'd be able to keep a couple. uh for a
[37:57] night or two and then uh then we'll
[38:01] leave the choice up to the individuals.
[38:04] For those who would like to stay over or
[38:07] could stay over,
[38:09] uh then you should call the office too
[38:11] and say you'd be you'd be uh you'd be
[38:15] happy to stay over if there's
[38:17] accommodation for you. Uh and I know if
[38:20] the congregation if we just make every
[38:23] space available it would certainly be a
[38:25] big help. Uh I would think that uh
[38:28] Friday
[38:30] Friday is the first service.
[38:34] Uh
[38:36] and just to make sure that I have the
[38:39] times exactly correct. Uh the Friday
[38:42] service is at 7:30
[38:46] and Saturday morning at 10:00 a.m. I've
[38:49] asked brother Ron Spencer to speak the
[38:51] Saturday morning service and brother
[38:54] Puit will be Friday evening, Saturday
[38:56] evening and Sunday morning.
[38:59] Uh there's quite a number of people
[39:02] coming in and some will be staying on
[39:04] the US side with friends and so on and
[39:07] we're happy for that. But you should be
[39:10] aware that on Friday uh coming north
[39:14] there could be some extra traffic
[39:16] because there's believe it or not the
[39:19] Cloverdale Rodeo is I think it's the
[39:22] second largest third largest in North
[39:24] America, second largest in Canada next
[39:27] to Calgary and so there is quite a few
[39:29] people that are attracted to that type
[39:32] of thing and uh so you should come a
[39:36] little bit early between 2 and 5 on
[39:41] Friday afternoon. We're just going to
[39:43] have a get acquainted and fellowship
[39:45] time. It'll either be in the fellowship
[39:48] room or over in the gymnasium.
[39:51] Uh and so that will be determined
[39:54] between now and then, but it'll just be
[39:56] a fellowship time. If you want to come a
[39:58] little bit early, that will be fine. And
[40:00] then from f from 5 it will close at 5
[40:05] and then the service will be at 7:30. So
[40:08] there'll be a couple of hours for people
[40:10] to uh get refreshed. But if you wish to
[40:14] stay over Friday night so you can be
[40:16] here for the Saturday morning service.
[40:20] I don't think the border should be a big
[40:22] problem for 10:00 a.m. service. I I
[40:25] don't think so. It could be a little bit
[40:27] heavy. But going back in the evening
[40:30] could be uh quite heavy. So if you're
[40:34] able to stay,
[40:36] I think that would be wonderful. And uh
[40:39] I know we have a couple of rooms
[40:40] ourselves and we're going to make those.
[40:42] I think they're already taken. They may
[40:44] be taken, but at least we're we just
[40:47] want to make people uh I just want to
[40:51] let you know that we're not we're not
[40:53] just laying that on you. My wife was
[40:56] getting the rooms ready yesterday and so
[40:58] we can have people there. I It's always
[41:02] a joy.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's always a joy.
[41:06] Uh
[41:08] so
[41:10] that is the main part this and the
[41:13] Sunday morning will be the uh
[41:17] anniversary service and we're just
[41:20] wanting it to be a special time. A very
[41:23] special time. And this is a time we're
[41:26] uh giving glory to God. I've been
[41:27] looking over some of the pictures and
[41:30] and just uh seeing what God has done.
[41:37] Some of it is almost hard to believe
[41:39] that actually that all took place. But
[41:42] 40 years is quite a while. And I can
[41:45] tell you one thing as a testimony.
[41:48] We have no regrets.
[41:51] everything we're able to do for God.
[41:53] We're just so delighted about that.
[41:57] Amen.
[41:59] So, if you'd like to uh stand now, we
[42:02] will read at a scripture out of Luke 7.
[42:06] Thank you, musicians.
[42:09] I have two scripture readings. I'd like
[42:11] to read from Luke the 7th chapter,
[42:14] starting at verse 3 down to verse 9.
[42:20] and then we'll read from Matthew 8 5-10.
[42:28] Just before we read, let's bow in
[42:31] prayer.
[42:33] Gracious and loving heavenly father,
[42:37] we are so indebted to you for all that
[42:41] you have done and are doing and will
[42:44] continue to do. We thank you for your
[42:47] mighty power. We thank you for the
[42:50] release of the Holy Spirit, Lord, upon
[42:53] our lives. We just thank you, oh God,
[42:56] for the reality that you have given us,
[42:59] oh God, the assurance of salvation. And
[43:02] we just pray, Father, that in the name
[43:04] of Jesus Christ, you will receive, oh
[43:07] God, not only our thanksgiving, but now
[43:10] we offer our lives to you. We offer all
[43:14] that we are and all that we ever can be.
[43:17] Lord, we pray that you will take this
[43:19] service and we ask that you will be
[43:21] glorified.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that's worthy of
[43:25] glory
[43:26] &gt;&gt; and we give ourselves to you, Father, as
[43:29] we've already prayed in the study and we
[43:31] agreed, oh God. And if you you said if
[43:34] two or three shall agree, it shall be
[43:36] done. And so I pray with this
[43:39] congregation, with all that are
[43:41] streaming this service, be glorified.
[43:44] be glorified, oh God, and let the words
[43:47] of our lips and let the praise from our
[43:50] soul give you glory. We pray, Father,
[43:52] that you will do all manner of things,
[43:55] those things that are even exceedingly
[43:58] above all we could ask or think. Pray
[44:01] that you will not only heal the sick,
[44:04] pray you'll deliver the bound. Pray, oh
[44:06] God, you'll fill with the Holy Spirit
[44:09] those that desire and hunger and refill,
[44:12] oh God, each one of us. In the name of
[44:16] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And let everyone say, "Amen."
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Good. All right. We're going to read
[44:24] from Luke now the 7th chapter, starting
[44:27] with verse three.
[44:29] And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto
[44:33] him the elders of the Jews, beseeching
[44:36] him that he would come and heal his
[44:39] servant. And when they came to Jesus,
[44:42] they besought him instantly, saying that
[44:45] he was a worthy, he was worthy for whom
[44:48] he should do this, for he loveth our
[44:52] nation, and he hath built us a
[44:54] synagogue. This man was a centurion that
[44:57] they're speaking of.
[44:59] Then Jesus went with them. And when he
[45:02] was now a was when he was now not far
[45:07] from the house, the centurion sent
[45:10] friends to him, saying unto him, Lord,
[45:12] trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy
[45:16] that thou shouldest enter under my roof.
[45:19] Wherefore neither thought I myself
[45:22] worthy to come unto thee, but say in a
[45:25] word, and my servant shall be healed.
[45:28] For I also am a man set under authority,
[45:32] having under me soldiers. And I say unto
[45:36] one, go, and he goeth, and to another,
[45:39] come, and he cometh. And to my servant,
[45:42] do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus
[45:44] heard these things, he marveled at him
[45:47] and turned him about and said unto the
[45:50] people that followed him, I say unto
[45:52] you, I have not found so great faith,
[45:56] know not in Israel.
[45:59] And then in Matthew the 8th chapter and
[46:04] verse 5, we read of the same account.
[46:07] And when Jesus was entered into
[46:08] Capernaum, there came unto him a
[46:10] centurion beseeching him. And saying,
[46:13] Lord, my servant lith at home, sick of
[46:16] the palsy, grievously tormented. And
[46:19] Jesus sth unto him, I will come and heal
[46:21] him. The centurion answered and said,
[46:24] Lord, I am not worthy that thou
[46:26] shouldest come under my roof, but speak
[46:28] the word only, and my servant shall be
[46:31] healed. For I am a man under authority,
[46:34] having soldiers under me. And I say to
[46:37] this man, "Go," and he goeth. And to
[46:39] another, "Come," and he cometh. And to
[46:41] my servant, do this, and he doeth it.
[46:44] And when Jesus heard it, he marveled and
[46:48] said to them that followed. Verily I say
[46:50] unto you, I have not found so great
[46:54] faith, know not in Israel. So we can see
[46:58] that faith is even tied to what this man
[47:03] learned from authority. And I want to
[47:05] speak about that. I want to speak about
[47:08] the bride under authority.
[47:12] You may have your seats.
[47:23] You'll need to listen and follow closely
[47:27] and Lord willing I may have to take
[47:30] another portion of this of this
[47:33] wonderful truth and it's a mighty truth.
[47:36] I want to ask first what is authority?
[47:40] we say the authorities
[47:43] uh but what is authority as far as we
[47:45] are concerned as as far as we are as
[47:48] individuals
[47:50] and I looking into it have said it's
[47:54] actually a combination of about three
[47:56] things number one in the word uh right
[48:00] from the uh Greek it is the liberty of
[48:05] doing
[48:06] as one pleases.
[48:08] So you have liberty to do as one
[48:11] pleases. But connected to that is it's
[48:16] combined with the ability and the
[48:19] strength
[48:21] with which one possesses. So now one is
[48:25] given authority but in God's case and in
[48:29] the believer's case
[48:31] uh God also endus the individual with
[48:35] perhaps certain type of character
[48:37] certain type of gift certain type of uh
[48:41] of of whatever so that he would make the
[48:44] right choices
[48:46] uh and use that authority.
[48:49] So and then it goes it it merges from
[48:54] that. He not only is a gifted one but
[48:57] then he has the power of authority.
[49:01] And the centurion said something very
[49:04] very interesting which is kind of the
[49:06] basis. He said I also am a man under
[49:09] authority.
[49:11] You have to be under authority before
[49:14] you can exercise authority. Right.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; I also am a man under authority.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And and and he was saying it two ways.
[49:24] I'm under authority, but he also
[49:27] exercised and he explained it. He said,
[49:29] "I I say to this man, do this. This
[49:32] soldier, go here." And he goes, "Another
[49:34] one, come and he comes. I say to my
[49:36] servant, do this." And he doeth it. He
[49:38] had authority. And they recognized that
[49:41] authority. But he also was a man under
[49:44] authority. He knew what it was to take
[49:46] orders.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; He knew what it was to to, you know, to
[49:50] cut to the line. He knew what it was to
[49:53] be disciplined.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; He knew all of those things so he could
[49:57] he could exercise that.
[50:00] So the the world wonders, I'll just say
[50:04] this briefly to commence and lay a bit
[50:07] of a foundation.
[50:09] You might not realize it, but the world
[50:12] stands back and wonders at the power of
[50:16] the believer in this hour.
[50:19] Many of you have experienced it. They
[50:22] they may not say a whole lot. They may
[50:24] not express a whole lot, but it it seeps
[50:27] out
[50:28] &gt;&gt; here and there. And they they marvel at
[50:33] perhaps the homes. They marvel at the
[50:36] structure, how you maintain it, how you
[50:39] maintain the home or the family or the
[50:42] life that you have when others are just
[50:46] seemingly cut loose and there's uh it
[50:50] the fiber of uh society seems to be
[50:53] pulling apart at the seams, but instead
[50:56] the believer seems to be able to
[50:58] maintain maintain. Is that not so? Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; They're able to maintain a life and
[51:06] maintain a certain standard and
[51:08] something that actually if you described
[51:11] it to the world it seems unreal
[51:13] &gt;&gt; and and it is unreal for them
[51:17] &gt;&gt; but that is uh because we are we are
[51:21] under authority. Now,
[51:24] you know,
[51:26] couples when they get married, it's one
[51:28] of the things that the young lady finds
[51:31] out that now there's a head in the home
[51:34] uh beside maybe she was in a home and
[51:37] had her father and so on. But after they
[51:40] get married, then there's uh to be
[51:42] another head in the home. But it's it is
[51:46] absolutely essential to realize that we
[51:50] talk about a message coming. We talk
[51:52] about the revelation of Jesus Christ. We
[51:54] talk about him revealing himself as the
[51:57] bridegroom.
[51:58] I want to say to the church very
[52:00] quickly, anybody who considers
[52:03] themselves a believer, you have come
[52:06] under another level of authority.
[52:09] And if we don't submit to the word and
[52:12] submit to that authority, we're going to
[52:15] be shortanded
[52:16] on giving any authority.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; We can't give authority. We can't
[52:23] exercise authority. We can't exercise
[52:26] that aspect of of even the offices,
[52:30] mother, father, young people, whatever
[52:32] they are, pastor, deacons, whatever
[52:34] more. We have to realize we have come
[52:37] under authority
[52:38] &gt;&gt; and we're obliged to live by a word that
[52:41] is the word is Christ.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; If we think it's a book of rules, you're
[52:45] going to miss it.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; It's not a book of rules. It's a person.
[52:49] It's a headship of Jesus Christ in a
[52:51] union of marriage.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; There's five people
[52:59] that I wish to speak of who were given
[53:02] the use of authority. I hope I can get
[53:05] through these five. And uh one is
[53:08] Esther,
[53:10] Queen Esther.
[53:13] Uh Mori.
[53:15] Mori
[53:17] took her took Esther to be his own
[53:19] daughter when her mother and father had
[53:22] died. She was an orphan.
[53:24] And uh
[53:28] Esther was uh the daughter of Mori's
[53:31] uncle. You don't have to try to follow
[53:34] that out. But Morortei's uncle, he had
[53:38] raised uh she was the daughter of his
[53:41] uncle and they had died apparently and
[53:44] Mori took her as his own daughter and
[53:47] raised her and that's all in the book of
[53:50] Esther.
[53:52] And then there's this centurion which
[53:54] we've just read of.
[53:57] There is Jesus Christ himself.
[54:00] And I want to also give a few accounts
[54:04] of brother Brandham's ministry in this
[54:06] day. And there are some certain quotes
[54:09] which are really outstanding and I trust
[54:13] I will be able to get to them. You know
[54:15] that brother Brandham uh he was
[54:18] authorized and I I will be going into
[54:20] that but just as one instance I would
[54:23] just mention it to the brethren in the
[54:25] study because I was so struck by it. Uh
[54:28] I the first meetings I was in uh he had
[54:31] the sign in the hand. He would take the
[54:32] people by the hand and uh and uh uh was
[54:37] able because he the angel had said I'll
[54:39] give you you'll be given two signs. So
[54:41] he had a sign. He took the people by the
[54:43] hand. The second one was he would know
[54:45] the secret of their heart. And uh
[54:49] so he had this woman by the hand and he
[54:53] told her it's a tumor. And that was
[54:55] right is a tumor and it's showing. So he
[54:58] said, so he had the people bow their
[55:01] head and in this case wasn't only just a
[55:04] tumor, it was a demon. And he he came
[55:07] against that demon and looked and
[55:10] nothing happened. He said, "It's still
[55:12] there." And he came against it again. He
[55:15] said, "It's still holding. So there's
[55:18] something wrong." And and that that
[55:21] spirit would not leave. And then he
[55:23] spoke to her and dealt with her and uh
[55:26] just uh had some private conversation
[55:29] and he says, "All right, now we'll
[55:31] pray." And the people had their head
[55:33] bowed and he prayed and that thing left
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and the hand comes normal.
[55:40] Why did I say that?
[55:43] That was a display of authority.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And he was under authority by an angel
[55:49] commission. and he knew that demon had
[55:52] to leave.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; You have to know where you stand and you
[55:57] have to know that you're standing
[56:00] &gt;&gt; where God wants you. You know that you
[56:02] have to be standing under submission.
[56:05] You have to be under the authority in
[56:07] order to exercise the authority. But
[56:09] when you're under it and you're being
[56:10] submissive to it, then you know you have
[56:13] confidence
[56:14] &gt;&gt; that thing can't stay there.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; So, everyone everyone that's here to
[56:27] different degrees
[56:29] exercises some form of authority even in
[56:33] decisionmaking or whatever. And Jesus
[56:36] had supreme power and authority to
[56:38] conduct that power. However, he was in
[56:42] complete submission to the scripture. He
[56:46] himself was in complete submission to
[56:49] the scripture and to the will of God
[56:51] spoken by the prophets in the word of
[56:54] God. He made himself submissive to that
[56:57] word. And that's why he had supreme
[57:00] authority and supreme power. Jesus said,
[57:05] "And Jesus came and spoke unto them." is
[57:08] Matthew 28:18
[57:10] saying all power is given me in heaven
[57:16] and in earth. But he also had the con
[57:19] character to control that power. He said
[57:22] in John 10:18, "No man taketh it from
[57:26] me." He was speaking now about his own
[57:28] life. No man taketh it from me or takes
[57:31] my life from me, but I lay it down of
[57:35] myself. I have power to lay it down and
[57:39] I have power to take it up again. But
[57:42] that isn't where he ended. He said,
[57:44] "This commandment have I received of my
[57:47] father."
[57:50] &gt;&gt; So he knew that he could lay down his
[57:53] life and he would take it up again
[57:56] &gt;&gt; because this was written of him that his
[57:58] body would not even see corruption.
[58:02] So you may have the power to do a
[58:05] certain thing. Listen to this one close
[58:07] now. You may have the power to do a
[58:10] certain thing, but do you have the
[58:13] scriptural permission?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; This comes right down into our life.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, well, I have a I have an
[58:22] opportunity uh for a job over here. I
[58:25] have an opportunity to do this or to do
[58:27] that. I have an opportunity." But do you
[58:30] have scriptural permission to do it?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; You have the power to give somebody a
[58:34] piece of your mind, but should you do
[58:37] it?
[58:38] &gt;&gt; That's the next thing. You You have the
[58:40] power to do it, you can verbally put it
[58:42] together, hey, I can too.
[58:47] But sometime just when you want to do
[58:48] it, you have to bite your tongue because
[58:50] you have to say scripturally, I
[58:52] shouldn't do that.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; I just shouldn't do that. That's that
[58:56] that's how it comes right down to where
[58:58] we live. Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I want to just take the visitation of
[59:06] the angel for a moment.
[59:09] Receiving the authority. Receiving the
[59:12] authority is someone with official
[59:14] power. Someone who has authority is the
[59:17] right or power to enforce rules or to
[59:21] give orders. Now
[59:24] in the in the message God revealing
[59:26] himself to his people
[59:30] when he heard had this visitation of the
[59:32] angel he said I knew that was the same
[59:36] voice that spoke to me all along and
[59:40] that was the first time that I'd ever
[59:43] seen it like that but I knew that voice
[59:46] and he said here's a voice now
[59:51] fear Not. I am sent from the presence of
[59:54] the almighty God to tell you that your
[59:58] pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe
[59:58] pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe
[59:58] pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe
[59:58] pe peculiar birth and peculiar life has
[1:00:02] been always misunderstood with men and
[1:00:05] said your peculiar life and your
[1:00:07] peculiar birth has been to indicate that
[1:00:10] you're to take a gift of divine healing
[1:00:13] to the peoples of the world and as Moses
[1:00:16] was given two signs so you will be given
[1:00:19] two signs the First will be that you'll
[1:00:23] be able to detect the diseases by your
[1:00:25] hand and taking the patient by the right
[1:00:28] hand. And if you'll be sincere when you
[1:00:32] pray,
[1:00:33] get them to believe you and be sincere
[1:00:36] when you pray. Here it is. Nothing will
[1:00:40] stand before your prayers, not even
[1:00:42] counsel.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And the thing was, if that didn't happen
[1:00:47] for the next 30 years,
[1:00:51] before millions of people,
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; we'd have a reason to doubt it. But this
[1:00:55] generation has no reason to doubt it.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; To receive authority is to believe in
[1:01:06] it. And I'm going to come a little
[1:01:07] further into this uh just in a few
[1:01:10] moments in the message.
[1:01:13] Uh and he spoke of his own ministry. He
[1:01:15] said dealing with one at a time. you're
[1:01:18] just dealing with one person and another
[1:01:19] person, another person. Rather than
[1:01:21] having them come through a prayer line,
[1:01:23] he says, "I with those prayer cards," he
[1:01:26] gave out prayer cards. He said, "I just
[1:01:28] have to take one at a time." And here it
[1:01:31] comes through the different diseases and
[1:01:34] the only that only tells what's wrong
[1:01:37] with the person. But it's the faith in
[1:01:41] God. It's the faith in God that heals
[1:01:44] us. So it's to take just one at a time.
[1:01:47] One at a time. And they come up with a
[1:01:50] prayer card. But he said it's the faith
[1:01:52] in God that heals us. Believe the
[1:01:56] authority. Believe God. Now he's talking
[1:01:59] not only about having authority or
[1:02:02] exercising authority, but the individual
[1:02:04] believing in the authority.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Believe in the authority. Believe God
[1:02:11] and look and live.
[1:02:15] in Mark 13 and34.
[1:02:18] That's why I said I'm glad you're
[1:02:20] listening closely. For the son of man is
[1:02:23] as a man.
[1:02:25] Uh and Mark is only 16 chapters. So this
[1:02:28] is getting towards the end of towards
[1:02:31] the cross, the crucifixion, and the
[1:02:32] burial. It's important to place it. For
[1:02:35] the son of man is as a man taking a far
[1:02:37] journey who left his house. Because he's
[1:02:40] talking now. He's talking now about
[1:02:42] what's going to happen.
[1:02:44] just in the next short few days. So the
[1:02:47] son of man is as a man taking a far
[1:02:49] journey who left his house and gave
[1:02:52] authority to his servants and to every
[1:02:56] man his work and commanded the porter to
[1:03:01] watch. Watch ye therefore, for you know
[1:03:04] not when the master of the house cometh
[1:03:06] at even or at midnight or at the
[1:03:09] cockcrowing or in the morning, lest
[1:03:12] coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
[1:03:16] And what I say unto you, I say unto all,
[1:03:20] watch. Now he's talking about he's going
[1:03:22] to give his servants authority
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; and then men sleeping. But he says he
[1:03:30] says you know not the time he said and
[1:03:34] less coming suddenly he find you
[1:03:36] sleeping. Say really men given authority
[1:03:41] sleeping. But here these same men uh he
[1:03:46] went right to the garden shortly after
[1:03:48] this the garden of Gethsemane and and
[1:03:50] and three of his greatest were sleeping.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; They were sleeping. the conditions can
[1:03:56] make us uh I won't say uh uh you know
[1:04:02] lethargic necessarily but conditions and
[1:04:05] the conditions of this age the
[1:04:07] conditions the world that you live in
[1:04:10] the real world is designed to sap your
[1:04:14] energy
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; and to almost make a person lethargic
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; because a person gets can get weary
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; and that's why Jesus spoke the way he
[1:04:30] spoke
[1:04:32] and so men of authority and immediately
[1:04:34] following this scripture which Jesus I
[1:04:37] just read of Jesus Jesus commenced his
[1:04:40] journey to Calvary
[1:04:43] and the disciples began their darkest
[1:04:46] journey in life
[1:04:48] and I can tell you that the events of
[1:04:50] the next few days wearied them out
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; they didn't only sleep in the garden.
[1:04:56] They were filled with fear. They were
[1:04:59] they were they were convinced that
[1:05:02] something had gone wrong with the
[1:05:03] message.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; They were convinced because the great
[1:05:08] things weren't happening anymore.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And the people were fleeing and filled
[1:05:12] with fear and the people who had had all
[1:05:14] kinds of miracles and things happen and
[1:05:17] healing. Where all the miracles go? It
[1:05:19] wasn't the miracles that saved people.
[1:05:22] That's where they were missing it. And
[1:05:24] here he was being accused and he fell
[1:05:26] into the hands of the authorities. The
[1:05:29] authorities and they were exercising
[1:05:31] their authority. And uh and the people
[1:05:34] they were having, you know, you talk
[1:05:36] about having it seems like this whole
[1:05:38] country, the whole North America at
[1:05:40] least. In fact, there's a big part of
[1:05:41] the world is is all filled with, you
[1:05:44] know, people in the streets protest
[1:05:46] protest this and protest that. We took a
[1:05:49] little walk at at White Rock yesterday
[1:05:52] just to get into some sunshine and and
[1:05:55] there there's cameras and everything
[1:05:56] else was what's going on protest
[1:05:59] protesting the coal crane toll cral
[1:06:03] trains going from here to the US.
[1:06:10] Hello.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And my wife says, "Well, let's turn
[1:06:14] around. We're going to be on
[1:06:15] television." I says, "We're not part of
[1:06:17] this. Let's just excuse us. We're going
[1:06:20] through here just like a cold train
[1:06:23] ourself.
[1:06:26] Everybody with their little signs and
[1:06:28] all of this and protesting this and
[1:06:30] protesting that and the young people are
[1:06:33] protesting the, you know, stuff is going
[1:06:36] up, the rates are going up, uh, tuition
[1:06:39] is going up and hello, this is the real
[1:06:42] world. uh you can be sure taxes are
[1:06:45] going up, everything's going to go up.
[1:06:47] Uh that's just the real world. You know,
[1:06:49] our money isn't hardly worth anything. I
[1:06:51] better not get on to that. But uh that's
[1:06:53] that's the real world. That's where
[1:06:55] we're at. But the the the talking about
[1:06:57] the authority and coming into their
[1:07:00] darkest hour and they got wearied with
[1:07:03] it,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us in Mark 16, now
[1:07:09] this is after their darkest hour. So I'm
[1:07:12] I was thinking in fact as I had actually
[1:07:15] titled this message the road to
[1:07:18] authority
[1:07:20] because it isn't something that I just
[1:07:22] you know we just have conferred on you.
[1:07:24] You have the authority. Oh great I'm
[1:07:26] going to go out and do big things. No,
[1:07:28] it doesn't happen that way. God prepares
[1:07:30] his vessel.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; And I've got to have time to go into
[1:07:34] that because sometimes we think
[1:07:36] everything's going sideways,
[1:07:38] everything's going wrong. Everything's
[1:07:40] going in reverse. Don't you fool
[1:07:42] yourself. With God, nothing's going in
[1:07:44] reverse. It's right on target.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; It's right on target. And you need to
[1:07:50] believe that.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care how young you are or how
[1:07:54] old you are or where you are in life. As
[1:07:56] long as we surrender ourselves and keep
[1:07:59] ourselves yielded and say whatever he
[1:08:02] said, I believe that I'm going this
[1:08:05] direction. I've given my life to this
[1:08:07] Lord Jesus, this revealed word. and uh
[1:08:10] and I I leave the results in his hands.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one to have to produce a
[1:08:16] thing. He's the one who said it's a
[1:08:19] spotless bride
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; or any such thing.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Well, we can find all kinds of things
[1:08:29] wrong. Say, well, this is wrong. That's
[1:08:31] wrong. Are you sure? Maybe that's what
[1:08:33] God needs to have happen in order to
[1:08:36] produce what he what he's desiring to
[1:08:38] produce. So after after Gethsemane and
[1:08:42] after the last supper and after the
[1:08:46] judgment hall and after the people
[1:08:48] screaming in the streets, the same ones
[1:08:50] who a week before were were saying
[1:08:52] hosana, hosana, hosana. They thought he
[1:08:55] was going to be a king. Now it's down.
[1:08:58] Crucify. Crucify. Crucify him. People
[1:09:01] are fickle.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; They were fickle and they're fickle now.
[1:09:08] It's the truth, friends.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. And and because they
[1:09:12] don't have any roots. And so it was
[1:09:15] after all of this and after the
[1:09:18] crucifixion and the brutality
[1:09:21] and after the burial and after the
[1:09:24] resurrection,
[1:09:26] afterward,
[1:09:28] he appeared to the 11. Even the
[1:09:32] secretary's gone. He's he's killed. He
[1:09:36] committed suicide. Judas. And after he
[1:09:40] sat with the 11 as he as they sat at
[1:09:43] meat and he upgraded them, he scolded
[1:09:47] them for their unbelief and hardness of
[1:09:51] heart because they believed not them
[1:09:54] which had seen him after his
[1:09:57] resurrection.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; After he was risen. And he said unto
[1:10:02] them, "Go into all the world, and preach
[1:10:05] the gospel to every creature, and he
[1:10:07] that believeth and is baptized uh shall
[1:10:10] be saved, but he that believeth not
[1:10:13] shall be damned. And these signs shall
[1:10:15] follow them that believe. And in my name
[1:10:18] they cast out devils. They shall speak
[1:10:21] with new tongues, and they shall take up
[1:10:23] serpents, and if they drink any deadly
[1:10:25] thing, it shall not hurt them. They
[1:10:27] shall lay hands on the sick, and they
[1:10:29] shall recover." So then after the Lord
[1:10:32] had spoken unto them, he was received up
[1:10:34] into glory into heaven and sat on the
[1:10:37] right hand of God. And they went forth
[1:10:39] and preached everywhere, the Lord
[1:10:41] working with them and confirming the
[1:10:44] word with signs following. Why? Because
[1:10:46] now they had gone through a very
[1:10:48] difficult time, but now he's telling
[1:10:51] them now they have more authority than
[1:10:54] they had before.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Now they're commissioned to do
[1:10:58] something. They weren't prepared to do
[1:11:00] this before, but now they had to
[1:11:02] experience something that was a rather
[1:11:04] short event.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; When I say short event, in the in the
[1:11:08] life of uh Esther and Mori, it was their
[1:11:12] entire lives that were devoted
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; to and two people saved a nation.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Two people under God saved a nation.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Two individuals no different than two
[1:11:25] individuals sitting here today. Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Two individuals. If you put it back as
[1:11:30] some, you know, glamorous historical
[1:11:32] thing, you miss the point.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; It's the same today as it was then.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They had to believe then,
[1:11:39] they had to believe now. They had to be
[1:11:40] under authority then. We have to be
[1:11:42] under authority now.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And able to exercise it. Full authority
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; was restored in this day. And we would
[1:11:51] send to doubt this evidence of
[1:11:54] restoration.
[1:11:56] And I'm going to just go through
[1:12:03] in the message expectation.
[1:12:05] These are live happenings
[1:12:09] and I'm going to be as brief as I can.
[1:12:12] Brother Brent, I'm in prayer and a
[1:12:14] commission now. But thou demon upon the
[1:12:18] confession of this woman's faith
[1:12:21] in the son of God, I come in the name of
[1:12:24] Jesus Christ, professing the gift of
[1:12:27] divine healing. You are made known. You
[1:12:31] can't hide any longer. Come out of the
[1:12:34] woman through Jesus Christ. Something's
[1:12:37] left you. He said, you accept him.
[1:12:39] You're healed. There you are. You feel
[1:12:42] different now, don't you? All right. You
[1:12:45] may raise your head. He's saying to the
[1:12:47] congregation, "Sister, your sins are
[1:12:49] forgiven and you're healed now."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; It's all right. I know this question in
[1:12:56] your mind.
[1:12:58] He said, "It's not me that forgives
[1:12:59] sins.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; I just see that God has already done
[1:13:02] it."
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; That's authority.
[1:13:07] Yeah.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here this moment and
[1:13:10] this morning and you had something and
[1:13:11] you say, "Well, I feel all right." But
[1:13:14] maybe in a certain presence, you start
[1:13:17] to feel a great light, pure light, a
[1:13:21] holy light
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; on your life and just say, "I I'm just
[1:13:26] not quite as certain as I was before I
[1:13:29] walked in here." Wouldn't it be
[1:13:31] wonderful for you to come into a
[1:13:32] presence where you say, "I can sense
[1:13:35] this is a presence of not of a human,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; but this is a presence of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:40] Christ." And then have a vessel for that
[1:13:43] one who's present to speak to you and
[1:13:46] say, "Your sin is forgiven."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Straighten yourself up and
[1:13:56] go off the platform. you're well. He
[1:14:00] said, "Walk real fast."
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Here's the one I was just telling you
[1:14:09] about in a message, a testimony,
[1:14:14] and he said, "Yes, tumor."
[1:14:18] Why are you saying this, brother? I'm
[1:14:20] saying this because should we have
[1:14:23] confidence?
[1:14:25] Is there is there a good reason why we
[1:14:29] should be able to give ourselves under
[1:14:33] this authority?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; It's not just a statement or a quote,
[1:14:37] but is it a living person, Christ,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; the revealed word, and we submit
[1:14:43] ourselves and give ourselves under that
[1:14:46] authority.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; He said a tumor. Is that right? Now he
[1:14:53] said, "You'll believe." He said, "Ask
[1:14:55] the people." Let's bow our heads. Our
[1:14:57] heavenly father, be merciful to this
[1:15:00] poor woman. Grant, Lord, that she may be
[1:15:04] healed of this tumor. I ask you to be
[1:15:06] merciful. Grant it. And here she's to
[1:15:10] have it removed. Maybe to die in the
[1:15:13] operation, but thou art here, Father, to
[1:15:17] remove it for her. Take all this from
[1:15:20] her. Help her now to be healed in the
[1:15:23] name of thy son Jesus. Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; it doesn't leave.
[1:15:33] Just a moment. It didn't leave.
[1:15:38] It didn't leave her.
[1:15:41] He said, "See,
[1:15:43] you see it running on my hand?" He's
[1:15:45] showing her. You see it running on my
[1:15:47] hand like that?
[1:15:50] Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus come
[1:15:54] out of the woman
[1:15:57] said seems to hold
[1:16:00] everybody just keep your heads bowed I
[1:16:03] want to talk to you he said
[1:16:06] now you look at me do you live far no
[1:16:11] far he said there's something see the
[1:16:14] tumor is making an act
[1:16:17] some way but there's something causing
[1:16:20] it to keep it from leaving.
[1:16:24] You believe me to be a person that's and
[1:16:26] then it went blank to work hard in life
[1:16:32] said that's what it is. You know that's
[1:16:34] right sister but you've got a desire to
[1:16:37] do that recently more than ever in the
[1:16:40] last two weeks. Now he's telling her
[1:16:42] exactly what was going on in her life.
[1:16:44] He said, 'You've been praying about
[1:16:46] that, asking God if he'd take you back.
[1:16:50] Isn't that right? One time you tried to
[1:16:52] commit suicide. Isn't that right? That's
[1:16:56] right. But now he said, "You've gotten
[1:16:58] away. This things's come. This thing's
[1:17:01] come. This tumor's come to bring you
[1:17:04] back to the Lord." Isn't that true? I'm
[1:17:07] not reading your mind. I'm seeing a
[1:17:09] vision.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Will you promise then
[1:17:14] that you'll return to God and will serve
[1:17:17] him all of your life and live? You
[1:17:20] promise it? All right, bow your head.
[1:17:24] Our heavenly father, our beloved sister
[1:17:27] standing here who's once knew you and
[1:17:30] wandered away.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; She's a backslider.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And now the secret sin of her life is
[1:17:38] revealed to her. the thing that's caused
[1:17:41] her to wander away and now down through
[1:17:44] the channel of time. Days passed by,
[1:17:48] you've come and revealed it to her,
[1:17:50] Lord. She's coming back. Will you
[1:17:53] receive her tonight here at the
[1:17:55] platform, a commemoration of the hour.
[1:17:58] Thank you. Thank you, Father.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. Your sins are
[1:18:04] forgiven. Your body is healed. And now
[1:18:07] go and sin no more.
[1:18:13] We need that kind of authority.
[1:18:16] I receive that kind of authority. I
[1:18:18] acknowledge that kind of authority. And
[1:18:20] I say it was sent from God to this
[1:18:23] generation to give you confidence in
[1:18:27] that kind of authority. And for us to
[1:18:29] say, I accept that.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That is none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:18:34] Christ in action.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that?
[1:18:40] Isn't that worthy
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; of our lives?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; It's not just praying for somebody
[1:18:49] passing through. But it won't leave.
[1:18:51] It's also somebody know it won't leave.
[1:18:53] That spirit won't leave. It's still
[1:18:55] holding. It's still staying there. It
[1:18:58] won't go.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; She walked off of there with her sins
[1:19:06] forgiven.
[1:19:09] Then a person as this brother Brham
[1:19:12] talks about this Roman or Italian
[1:19:15] whatever he was Lord I'm not worthy
[1:19:19] that you'd come under my roof. Neither
[1:19:22] thought I worthy to come to face you. In
[1:19:25] other words I sent your church. He sent
[1:19:28] people to him. He says, "I know that
[1:19:31] you're a man under authority and I'm
[1:19:33] under authority and you don't have to
[1:19:36] come down to my house to put your hands
[1:19:39] on my servant. You don't have to come
[1:19:41] here." Now, what's the prophet saying?
[1:19:44] You don't even have to come and have
[1:19:45] hands laid on you.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; This man stayed in his house, sent
[1:19:49] servants. Tell him, "I'm not worthy to
[1:19:51] even face you."
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Now, he's in a place.
[1:19:57] I tell you what, friends.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "Now, be sure to get
[1:20:04] this." He said, "I'm a man under
[1:20:06] authority also. And if I say to this
[1:20:08] man, you go do it, he'll do it. And if I
[1:20:11] say to this man, you come here, he will
[1:20:13] come. I'm under authority." And he knew
[1:20:16] that was the son of God that that every
[1:20:18] sickness and every demon was under him.
[1:20:21] And all he had to do was just speak the
[1:20:23] word.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not pray, speak the word.
[1:20:28] friends, Cleverdale Bible Way and all
[1:20:31] that, we need a reality check.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; We need to know that this is the truth.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; This is the way.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; This word that has come. If we can
[1:20:42] realize I have submitted myself under
[1:20:45] it. I am under authority and God has
[1:20:48] given me also a charge.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Before I'm done, friends, I want you not
[1:20:53] only to accept this first part of the
[1:20:55] message. I want you to accept the last
[1:20:57] part of the message. We need men and
[1:20:59] women. We need young people. We need
[1:21:01] them to rise up and say, "I know this
[1:21:03] word. I believe this word. I give myself
[1:21:08] to this Lord Jesus Christ who's revealed
[1:21:10] himself in this time." And as such then,
[1:21:13] I have a position.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; We're people under authority and we have
[1:21:19] authority in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:23] We have to know who that Jesus is. Not
[1:21:25] just a historical figure of 2,000 some
[1:21:28] years ago, but one who's revealed
[1:21:30] himself, who's alive, who's demonstrated
[1:21:33] himself and has shown what his will is
[1:21:35] for this age.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And there's a danger that this age miss
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; talked about the Supreme Court
[1:21:49] in America, Supreme Court in Canada.
[1:21:52] There has to be an absolute
[1:21:54] Supreme Court. You see these judges.
[1:21:57] They said on the Supreme Court, you can
[1:21:59] have uh a city court. You can have uh
[1:22:02] you know courts of lower levels and then
[1:22:06] you have a supreme court who can
[1:22:08] overturn the decision of a lower court.
[1:22:11] But there must be one that is supreme
[1:22:14] court with supreme authority. And and
[1:22:17] the prophet says, "You may not agree
[1:22:19] with their decision, but their decision
[1:22:22] is the absolute."
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Our nation needs an
[1:22:26] absolute."
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, we have to have an
[1:22:29] absolute. And if the nation in Satan's
[1:22:32] Eden needs an absolute, we as believers
[1:22:35] need an absolute. Not as he won, as he
[1:22:38] two, as he three, baptize this way,
[1:22:40] baptize forward, baptize them three
[1:22:42] times down, three times this way,
[1:22:44] baptize them as they do in Africa for
[1:22:46] every sin they can think of. He almost
[1:22:48] drowned them. I had a brother standing
[1:22:50] on the standing on the bank and went
[1:22:52] down there and said, "You're drowning
[1:22:54] the man cuz they bring him up. You had
[1:22:56] they believe in baptizing for every sin
[1:22:58] he could remember." And every time he
[1:23:00] came up said, you know, he'd remember
[1:23:02] another one. Down he goes. What? What
[1:23:05] kind of nonsense and chaos going on? We
[1:23:08] need an absolute.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; The word of God is absolute and it
[1:23:15] needed to be revealed.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; I want to be baptized in the name of the
[1:23:25] Lord Jesus Christ. Can you imagine
[1:23:27] anyone resisting wanting to be baptized
[1:23:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:23:32] My wife had been baptized when she was
[1:23:34] about 12 and in and the titles I had
[1:23:37] been baptized in the titles. But when I
[1:23:40] saw that in the scripture, the name of
[1:23:43] the Lord Jesus Christ, I wanted to be
[1:23:45] baptized, rebaptized.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; One day, just quietly on her own, my
[1:23:53] wife said, "I'm just going to read the
[1:23:54] scripture." She took the book of Acts
[1:23:56] and read right through the book of Acts.
[1:23:59] And every place that anybody was ever
[1:24:01] baptized in this Bible, they were
[1:24:04] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:24:06] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in
[1:24:08] the name of the Lord. There was no other
[1:24:10] way. And those that were baptized under
[1:24:12] under John's baptism were rebaptized.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When they heard that, glory
[1:24:18] to God. We need an absolute.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And when I see this kind of authority,
[1:24:23] thou demon, You're hanging on.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You won't release.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; You're defeated.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I've been given a gift
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; by an angel of God. He was under
[1:24:33] authority and he had authority and now
[1:24:36] we come under authority. Hallelujah. And
[1:24:39] it's not something that's rigorous and
[1:24:41] something that makes life miserable.
[1:24:43] It's wonderful.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's wonderful.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; It's a liberty. It's a freedom. When we
[1:24:52] come under, we know we're protected.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; We have a protector.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; I hope this meaning something to you.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; He said in another place, we have
[1:25:07] authority,
[1:25:09] but we don't have power. He said, uh,
[1:25:12] this is not a superstition.
[1:25:14] It is a manifestation of the promise of
[1:25:16] God. It depends on what you're looking
[1:25:19] at. No virtue, he said, in any man.
[1:25:24] There's no power in no man.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; But we as believers have authority. Not
[1:25:32] power, but authority. Is this this must
[1:25:35] register in your heart as more than a
[1:25:38] sermon.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You got to be able to say, and you
[1:25:42] should say, I have authority.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:48] Are you afraid to say that?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; I have authority.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You have a God-given authority.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; We can have a God-given expectation.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; What about the rest of your life?
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; What about your future?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; What about the future plans?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Well, if they're under God, it's his
[1:26:12] responsibility.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do in life? You
[1:26:16] young people, who are you going to
[1:26:17] marry? God knows.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As long as you give your
[1:26:22] life and submit your life
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; under under the opaces and under the
[1:26:27] mandate
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; of the word of God in this hour. You can
[1:26:31] forget your concern. God has it in
[1:26:34] control.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And you can't say, well, what if he
[1:26:38] doesn't? Oh, there is no such a thing.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. What if he
[1:26:43] doesn't? He will. Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; If if you have that in your mind, then
[1:26:48] there's some unbelief there. And we
[1:26:50] would be chastised. The Lord Jesus would
[1:26:53] stand here and say, "Why do you doubt
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; after what you've heard? After what
[1:26:58] you've seen, after the evidence, after
[1:27:01] what I've said this generation, how can
[1:27:03] you doubt?"
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; That if you can say from the very bottom
[1:27:08] of your soul, I don't doubt it.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I give myself to it. Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you're seeing a fellow
[1:27:17] standing up here. I say, I gave myself
[1:27:19] to it.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; At about 21, 22 years old, I gave myself
[1:27:24] to it. I've never ever regretted it. And
[1:27:27] when God opened up more, when I saw
[1:27:30] things start to slide, you know, go down
[1:27:33] a toboggan ride spiritually. So, there
[1:27:36] has to be an answer.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; There has to be an answer in the word.
[1:27:41] This messenger, this prophet gave me the
[1:27:43] answer of false anointed ones at the end
[1:27:45] time,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; anointed,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; anointed with a genuine anointing,
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; but the vessel themselves have something
[1:27:56] false, maybe a false doctrine, false
[1:27:57] teaching. It wouldn't let go of it.
[1:27:59] Anyway, I'll go on from there.
[1:28:03] Said, and he gave an example.
[1:28:06] Are you following me? All right. He gave
[1:28:08] an example of a policeman and we got
[1:28:10] policemen. Talk about policemen. There
[1:28:13] was enough policemen down there at this
[1:28:15] at this protest
[1:28:19] protest. Bunch of retirees
[1:28:22] down there my age and younger
[1:28:25] sitting around with a little sign.
[1:28:28] We pro probably cost us a quarter
[1:28:30] million dollars in taxes. They had
[1:28:31] policemen and police cars and more
[1:28:34] policemen. Every time I turned around,
[1:28:35] there's a policeman. I thought, you
[1:28:38] know, why don't they get out and do
[1:28:40] something?
[1:28:48] I hope you don't mind what I'm saying.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; But they're given authority.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; They're just like you and me. They get
[1:28:55] up in the morning, they have to have
[1:28:56] breakfast.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Men shave. Women do whatever they want
[1:29:00] or whatever they should.
[1:29:04] They had some women policemen out there
[1:29:06] and I I thought if I saw one my wife
[1:29:08] saying keep quiet now.
[1:29:12] So I was ready to say, "Why don't you go
[1:29:13] home and bake some biscuits?"
[1:29:16] But there's a gun on their side and all
[1:29:18] this stuff, you know, but they had a
[1:29:21] yellow stripe down the
[1:29:24] This is big time stuff. RCMP
[1:29:28] keeping the peace. About 30 people there
[1:29:31] costing us tens of thousands of dollars.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm speaking about.
[1:29:44] Brother Bam says you take a little
[1:29:45] policeman. He stands out in the corner
[1:29:47] here. A car comes roasting racing down
[1:29:49] the road right through city 50 mph. You
[1:29:52] know, maybe at a 25 or 30 zone. He's
[1:29:56] he's he said he he couldn't physically
[1:29:59] he hasn't got the power to stop a
[1:30:00] bicycle.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; But he stands out there, blows that
[1:30:04] little whistle. He says maybe he's
[1:30:06] skinny and his clothes are hanging on
[1:30:07] him and his cap down and folding his
[1:30:09] ears down. It doesn't matter what he
[1:30:11] looks like. He may look like a total
[1:30:13] discredit to the police force, but all
[1:30:15] he has to do is put up his hand and blow
[1:30:18] his whistle and the car comes to a
[1:30:20] screeching stop.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Why? He doesn't have any power, but he
[1:30:25] has authority and the whole city's
[1:30:27] behind him. If that's what the police
[1:30:29] force, what does the Bible say about a
[1:30:32] believer?
[1:30:34] It says the angels of God,
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; heavenly beings are surrounding the
[1:30:40] believer. That's what your Bible says.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that ought to give a
[1:30:45] believer some authority to realize I'm
[1:30:48] under authority. I believe that.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And I give myself to that.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm faithful to that
[1:30:55] call.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I think about this road to authority.
[1:31:09] I'll watch my time.
[1:31:13] The lives of these two people. I want to
[1:31:15] just speak about Esther for a few
[1:31:17] moments. And there's lessons here for
[1:31:19] absolutely everybody. the road to
[1:31:22] authority because I didn't want to get
[1:31:24] the people or have you you know get just
[1:31:28] conscious of oh I just had authorities
[1:31:31] because sometimes we exercise authority
[1:31:36] we have the power to exercise authority
[1:31:39] but we really haven't submitted
[1:31:42] ourselves to the molding of this word
[1:31:46] and the obedience to this word but when
[1:31:48] we do we'll find it works differently
[1:31:52] and uh authority is not in word only.
[1:31:55] It's not it's more in our lives.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And so the lives of these two people so
[1:32:02] I want to just uh go into the lives of
[1:32:04] Esther and Mori for a few moments to to
[1:32:09] say this and make this statement.
[1:32:10] There's some preerequisites
[1:32:13] to authority. Now uh I'm a father.
[1:32:18] There's men here that are fathers and a
[1:32:19] lot of you that
[1:32:23] you hear from your parents on a regular
[1:32:25] basis.
[1:32:26] And I want to just say to the parents,
[1:32:30] you know, sometimes we can exercise
[1:32:33] authority. We have authority and we can
[1:32:35] exercise authority,
[1:32:37] but we really need to check ourselves to
[1:32:41] see that some of these prerequisites are
[1:32:43] in place. I say prerequisites. A
[1:32:46] prerequisite is something that is
[1:32:50] necessary
[1:32:51] for something that's to follow.
[1:32:54] If we want a certain result,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; there can be a prerequisite that's
[1:32:59] needed. So the vessel must be molded
[1:33:03] before it's entrusted with the power of
[1:33:07] authority. There's a lot of power in
[1:33:10] authority, friends. Jesus called unto
[1:33:13] him. The Bible says, "But Jesus called
[1:33:17] unto him and said, Ye know that the
[1:33:21] princes of the Gentiles exercise
[1:33:23] dominion over them, and they that are
[1:33:26] great exercise authority upon them." The
[1:33:29] Gentiles do this. He said, "But you
[1:33:32] shall not be so. It shall not be so
[1:33:34] among you. But whosoever will be great
[1:33:38] among you, let him be your minister.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And whosoever will be chief among you,
[1:33:45] let him be your servant.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I say, Father, in the name of Jesus, let
[1:33:54] these words of our Lord Jesus sink down
[1:33:57] into the hearts of this congregation.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; You want to be in a place where you
[1:34:01] exercise authority. You want to become a
[1:34:04] servant.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; I'm here to serve the body of Jesus
[1:34:11] Christ. One of the greatest things I can
[1:34:14] do,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; to be an uplift, to be an encouragement,
[1:34:19] to minister to the bride of Jesus
[1:34:21] Christ.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Until you get that revelation, friends,
[1:34:25] your life will be short changed.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] If authority is to follow,
[1:34:37] there are some things that need to be in
[1:34:39] place in order for authority to function
[1:34:42] properly. You still listening?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:34:49] The Bible says of Esther, now I want to
[1:34:51] go. I'm just going through it quickly.
[1:34:55] Now when the turn of Esther came there
[1:34:57] were the story is for those of you that
[1:35:00] are unfamiliar
[1:35:02] Vashi the queen refused her husband's
[1:35:05] invitation to come to this great feast
[1:35:09] and she refused it and became a
[1:35:10] spectacle and his advisor said
[1:35:14] you know if she treats you the king and
[1:35:18] he had 127 provinces he he reigned all
[1:35:22] the way from Ethiopia to India
[1:35:25] He was one of the greatest of kings and
[1:35:28] Vashi his wife refused to come and his
[1:35:32] counselor said if that's an example of
[1:35:35] the leading lady then other women and
[1:35:38] wives are going to do the same thing
[1:35:40] they were wise it's still the same today
[1:35:43] and brother Brandon brought the same
[1:35:44] thing up now so uh then they said they
[1:35:49] said let us search in all the provinces
[1:35:52] of the kingdom and find fair, young,
[1:35:56] beautiful maidens that can be queen and
[1:36:00] wife to the king. And so amongst them
[1:36:04] was gathered a little Jewish girl who
[1:36:07] was an orphan, but she was striking,
[1:36:11] absolutely magnificent in her beauty,
[1:36:14] flawless.
[1:36:15] and Mori
[1:36:18] uh who had adopted her, he was he was in
[1:36:23] the he would sit in the king's gate.
[1:36:28] Says, "And then they kept these women
[1:36:30] for one year
[1:36:33] and for one year of purification
[1:36:36] with odors and perfumes and oils and so
[1:36:40] on." And they were under some
[1:36:42] chamberlains, chamberlains
[1:36:44] uh men what were like unics and they
[1:36:47] they and they had chief of the
[1:36:49] chamberlains as well and they kept them.
[1:36:52] And then the time came after one year of
[1:36:54] all of this then the women would go in
[1:36:57] before the king to see how how the king
[1:37:01] felt about these young women.
[1:37:05] And Esther refused all of these fancy
[1:37:08] things. That's right.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; She was content with what God had given
[1:37:13] her.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I tell you what, if there ever was
[1:37:16] a lesson for today's women, and Esther
[1:37:19] was a lovely person, and for and not
[1:37:22] only women, but for believers, we don't
[1:37:25] need a whole lot of auxiliary stuff. We
[1:37:28] don't need a whole lot of other things
[1:37:31] to make the church acceptable or make
[1:37:33] your worship acceptable. Just exactly
[1:37:36] what the word of God declares. That's
[1:37:39] all we need. I think we need to be
[1:37:41] simple and humble and and and real
[1:37:44] believers and believe be rugged people
[1:37:47] for God. Let's not let this generation
[1:37:50] with its uh to me it's a characterless
[1:37:53] generation. But but God has given us and
[1:37:56] infused into us by the Holy Spirit the
[1:37:59] character of Jesus Christ. Let's let
[1:38:02] that word when it's transforming power
[1:38:05] transform us and give us what we have
[1:38:08] need of.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And when the turn of Esther the daughter
[1:38:14] of uh Abahel
[1:38:17] the uncle of Mori who had taken her for
[1:38:20] his daughter was come to go in unto the
[1:38:23] king. She required nothing.
[1:38:27] And I underlined that and I've
[1:38:30] highlighted it and I think you ought to
[1:38:32] do the same. She required nothing. The
[1:38:36] believer who's bloodwashed
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ has been
[1:38:41] baptized according to the scripture and
[1:38:44] is under the opaces of the the word of
[1:38:47] God that's been made known in this age.
[1:38:50] I tell you friends, I just want to say
[1:38:52] we need nothing.
[1:38:55] We don't need a whole lot of fancy
[1:38:57] things from the world.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for this congregation.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; We don't need a whole lot of
[1:39:04] accessories.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Even when the choir and the musicians
[1:39:08] when you sing, you play. Don't play for
[1:39:11] the entertainment. Not that you do. I'm
[1:39:13] just This just my counsel. Just play and
[1:39:16] worship to God.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every once in a while I look
[1:39:20] at the musicians and you're really
[1:39:22] intent on your music and I know what it
[1:39:24] is because I I played in the church for
[1:39:26] years. But you know what? It's wonderful
[1:39:29] also for you to give expression.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Just worship God.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; While you're playing, worship God.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Just open your mouth and sing with the
[1:39:37] congregation.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. When you sing
[1:39:43] in the choir, we don't care how this
[1:39:46] sounds or how this pleases or somebody's
[1:39:49] a little out of tune or whatever more,
[1:39:51] but if you if you can't do anything
[1:39:53] else, at least make a joyful noise unto
[1:39:55] the Lord.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I've got some support.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Ryan. Yes. I'm not
[1:40:09] trying to instruct the choir or the one
[1:40:11] that's directing the choir,
[1:40:14] but she didn't require anything. He
[1:40:16] says, "But what Hegi, the king's
[1:40:19] chamberlain, the keeper of the women
[1:40:22] appointed, and Esther obtained favor in
[1:40:25] the sight of all of them that looked
[1:40:26] upon her."
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; In the marriage of the lamb, the prophet
[1:40:30] said, and you want to, in case you want
[1:40:33] to hear a message, go and hear that one.
[1:40:36] And the air is so tight you can cut it
[1:40:38] with a knife.
[1:40:42] And he had one of I just finished up
[1:40:44] listening to it last night
[1:40:48] and had one of the longest alder
[1:40:50] services that I've ever heard
[1:40:54] and be labored to ask if there's anyone
[1:40:58] and a few and there were young people
[1:41:00] that came. God bless the young people.
[1:41:04] But he was telling them in the service,
[1:41:07] Esther was to become a bride. So she
[1:41:10] didn't want none of the adorning of the
[1:41:13] world. She wanted to go in to the king
[1:41:16] just like she was.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; She adorned herself. He said she adorned
[1:41:21] herself like the Pentecostal women ought
[1:41:24] to
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; with a meek and humble spirit. And when
[1:41:29] all of these fancy and first ladies came
[1:41:31] by with all their new fandangled things,
[1:41:35] the king looked at them and uh uh put
[1:41:39] them uh put them in the chamber with the
[1:41:42] concubines. And when this Esther came
[1:41:45] into his sight and he got a glimpse of
[1:41:48] that sweet, humble, meek spirit, he
[1:41:52] said, "That's her.
[1:41:56] put her on her head.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then let them adorn themselves
[1:42:00] like that to have a kind
[1:42:03] that kind of spirit." Not only the women
[1:42:05] but the men, too.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Adorn themselves with a kind of a
[1:42:08] spirit. Then you're becoming ready for
[1:42:11] the bride, sweet, reverent Esther made
[1:42:14] her heart clean. And the Bible says,
[1:42:18] "And the king loved Esther above all the
[1:42:20] women, and she obtained grace and favor
[1:42:23] in his sight more than all of the
[1:42:26] virgins, so that he set the royal crown
[1:42:30] upon her head and made her queen instead
[1:42:33] of vastly."
[1:42:36] The Bible tells us also of Esther
[1:42:42] because she was Jewish. She had not
[1:42:44] showed herself.
[1:42:48] Esther had not showed her kindred nor
[1:42:51] her people as Mori had charged her.
[1:42:54] Morortei who was her adopted father, he
[1:42:58] said, "Don't tell them we're Jews
[1:43:01] and keep that as a secret."
[1:43:04] And Mori had charge of that from from a
[1:43:07] youth.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; And now she's queen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Now she's got the golden crown on her
[1:43:13] head.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Now she's somebody. Fact is, she is the
[1:43:18] lady
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; in a huge kingdom of 127
[1:43:26] countries
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; from Ethiopia all the way to India.
[1:43:30] Listen friends, he's not the first lady
[1:43:33] of the United States. He's not the prime
[1:43:35] minister's wife of Canada. This is a
[1:43:38] woman of incredible esteem
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; and incredible influence.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And she's just gained this. It took a a
[1:43:47] it took a a period of time. But the
[1:43:50] Bible is saying and and I want you to
[1:43:53] mark this. It's Esther 2 and 20. And for
[1:43:56] Esther, it says Esther had not showed
[1:44:00] her kindred nor her people as Mori had
[1:44:03] charged her. She was holding that a
[1:44:06] secret in her heart. For Esther did the
[1:44:09] commandment of Mori. She listened to her
[1:44:12] adopted father like as when she was
[1:44:16] brought up with him. Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I want to say to the young people, your
[1:44:23] parents have not lost it up here.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I want the young people to say, "Amen."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; They haven't lost it up here.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Esther, she didn't get up there and say,
[1:44:37] "Well, now I'm the queen."
[1:44:41] uh you know old my old relative out here
[1:44:46] and he's still sitting in the gate.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; He just wanted one of the lowest of
[1:44:52] servants sitting in the gate
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; but he he he always wanted to be there
[1:44:57] and he wanted to just keep eye on what
[1:45:00] was happening.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You know why? Not because he was a
[1:45:04] relative but because he was a Jew.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:45:08] And he told her, "Don't say anything."
[1:45:10] That was the only thing he told her.
[1:45:12] Don't say anything about it because
[1:45:15] there was a time that would be
[1:45:17] essential.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And after she
[1:45:21] become a queen, and I want this as a
[1:45:23] lesson to this congregation,
[1:45:26] we never never shall get above the
[1:45:30] wisdom that comes from God. I want to
[1:45:32] say when God sets an office,
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; whether it's a husband in a home
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; and he and he and he's submissive to the
[1:45:39] word, he must be submissive to the word
[1:45:42] or a wife in the home or a father or a
[1:45:45] deacon or a minister of the gospel. They
[1:45:49] have an office given by God.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't apologize for that. They
[1:45:54] have an office given by God.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; It's in the word of God. And we need to
[1:46:00] find ourselves to be in cooperation with
[1:46:03] the word of God. And then when we do
[1:46:06] come under authority, then our words
[1:46:08] carry some weight.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And she never lost her respect. Even
[1:46:16] though he's sitting in the gate as one
[1:46:18] of the lowest of servants, just sitting
[1:46:20] as a servant. She's a queen. She has her
[1:46:23] own house, her own room. And this is one
[1:46:26] who can go in to the king. You don't
[1:46:29] just go into the king, friends, because
[1:46:31] if you did, you got killed right there,
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Unless he raised his golden scepter.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And this is all coming up.
[1:46:41] I'm preaching this because it's needful.
[1:46:44] Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I say to you children and young people,
[1:46:49] honor thy father and thy mother that
[1:46:52] your years may be that it might go well
[1:46:55] with you and your years may be long in
[1:46:57] the earth.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Even my father, my father in the flesh
[1:47:04] was a lover of the word of God, a godly
[1:47:07] man. God didn't open up the the
[1:47:10] revelation of the word to him. had never
[1:47:13] changed our relationship one iota.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; That's why I say I know what I'm talking
[1:47:21] about.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:25] Brother Brandham said this to me. He
[1:47:28] said, "Brother Eddie,"
[1:47:30] and we were in a motel. He said, "If you
[1:47:32] stacked gold
[1:47:34] from the floor to the ceiling, gold
[1:47:37] bricks,
[1:47:39] and you asked me, would I sooner have
[1:47:42] that or have five minutes with my
[1:47:44] daddy?" And his father was a uh
[1:47:49] bootleger,
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; made alcohol.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I would take the five minutes
[1:47:54] with my daddy
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; rather than gold from the floor to the
[1:47:58] ceiling." He meant every word of it.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:02] Honor thy father and thy mother. And I
[1:48:05] believe that people that will do that.
[1:48:08] And this age
[1:48:10] has got a horrible spirit on it
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; for young people to start to think our
[1:48:16] parents don't understand our parents.
[1:48:18] She could have well said, "Well, he
[1:48:19] doesn't understand.
[1:48:21] He doesn't understand. I I I'm in here
[1:48:24] and I have a certain status and I have a
[1:48:26] certain responsibility. I've got a full
[1:48:28] slate. My life is busy. It's completely
[1:48:31] changed.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; But some things don't change.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; You may not want me to preach like this.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; But I'm preaching like this.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And if we can turn even the minds of the
[1:48:45] young people and those that aren't even
[1:48:47] here will get to hear this.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; We need to honor honor father and
[1:48:54] mother.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Honor the offices that God gives.
[1:48:59] and you respect it and you watch and see
[1:49:01] the blessing of God come upon you.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:07] like it was when she was brought up.
[1:49:28] The supreme test
[1:49:30] was yet to come. What? What am I
[1:49:32] preaching on? the way, the road to
[1:49:36] authority.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; They've lived this whole life.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You know, sometime we don't know what
[1:49:45] we're doing. You've you've you I won't
[1:49:48] take any time with this, but you've
[1:49:50] heard a bit of my testimony from time to
[1:49:53] time. I just put it in a in a service.
[1:49:57] And I I want the young people to know,
[1:50:00] too, we haven't all had an easy life.
[1:50:02] And my mother died as I and I said this
[1:50:05] in Switzerland. I said my mother died
[1:50:07] when I was young that they had not heard
[1:50:09] that.
[1:50:11] And I stepped down in front of the
[1:50:12] pulpit and I was speaking on something's
[1:50:15] wrong. Something's not right. I couldn't
[1:50:17] understand it but something's not right.
[1:50:19] And I stood beside her little
[1:50:21] clothcovered coffin, the cheapest you
[1:50:24] could purchase, I guess. And and a woman
[1:50:27] came down, broke off that big lily and
[1:50:29] stuck it in my hand. And I looked at
[1:50:31] that big white lily that was about that
[1:50:33] time of the year in May, I believe it
[1:50:35] was. And I I just looked at that lily
[1:50:38] and I looked at this coffin. I was six
[1:50:40] and a half. I just knew something is
[1:50:42] terribly wrong. This isn't to happen
[1:50:45] like this. You know, my mother is gone.
[1:50:48] I couldn't even I couldn't even
[1:50:50] understand it. I told that in
[1:50:51] Switzerland. I don't even know why I
[1:50:53] told her. I was standing down here just
[1:50:54] telling it. One of the pastors that was
[1:50:57] in that meeting was just in Siberia. He
[1:51:00] just got emails. We've been emailing
[1:51:01] back and forth this week since last
[1:51:03] Sunday. And he's been in Siberia and he
[1:51:05] has gone there. Brother Gidto, many of
[1:51:07] you know brother Gido and he was in he
[1:51:09] was in Siberia and brother Dennis from
[1:51:12] Latvia was with him as an interpreter
[1:51:14] and and they're going to because brother
[1:51:16] Gito's gone to orphanages for years and
[1:51:19] now those orphans have grown and they've
[1:51:21] gotten grown and they married and
[1:51:23] there's new orphans coming up and
[1:51:25] brother Richard you went with him. He
[1:51:26] mentioned you two three times and
[1:51:29] because he said that brother when
[1:51:30] brother Richard was here and then they
[1:51:31] went to Moscow and saw a woman I think
[1:51:33] was an orphan and or was in the
[1:51:36] orphanage and she uh has she's married
[1:51:39] now and has some children and was
[1:51:41] visiting her. You probably know her. And
[1:51:43] uh and so anyway, I just told that and
[1:51:47] he said, "Brother Biscll," he said, "I
[1:51:49] just was in a service with the orphans,
[1:51:52] an orphanage, and a and a young girl,
[1:51:55] she's probably 9 or 10 years old, she
[1:51:58] came up and she said,
[1:52:01] "Brother G,
[1:52:03] why do I have to be an orphan?"
[1:52:09] And he says he didn't even have an
[1:52:10] answer. He didn't know what to say to
[1:52:12] her. He said, "And just at that moment,"
[1:52:15] he said, "what your testimony came to my
[1:52:17] mind." And I told her that about Brother
[1:52:20] Biscll was just speaking in Switzerland
[1:52:23] and that his mother was taken at 6 and a
[1:52:26] half and he was saying there just
[1:52:28] something we don't understand, but uh we
[1:52:31] we know something's wrong. But he says,
[1:52:33] and he just finished speaking. So he
[1:52:35] said, "It's not only you." And he said
[1:52:38] just a piece came over her and she was
[1:52:40] understanding and that satisfied her.
[1:52:43] And I thought, you know, God probably
[1:52:46] God knew that girl was going to come and
[1:52:48] ask him that question and caused me to
[1:52:51] say that right then for her that girl's
[1:52:54] sake. And I'm just glad any part of our
[1:52:56] testimony can be. But sometime and and
[1:52:58] and uh uh Esther now she's she's she
[1:53:02] could go back to her orphan life and uh
[1:53:06] you know brought up by her uncle and and
[1:53:09] and then you know Mori or her uncle uh
[1:53:12] Mori's uncle I should say passed away
[1:53:14] and and then she's raised by Mori and
[1:53:16] now now she's swept into you know
[1:53:20] selected elected.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; We're people that know what election is
[1:53:24] don't we? So many people when they first
[1:53:26] come they say, "Why me?
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Why me? Why not somebody else?" Well,
[1:53:32] she she's she's not just saying that.
[1:53:34] She all she knows is she's swept into
[1:53:37] the absolute height, the apex, the
[1:53:40] epitome of of the just perfect position
[1:53:46] and say, "Who could be what could be
[1:53:48] more glorious than this?" But she wasn't
[1:53:51] caught up with the glamour of it. She
[1:53:53] still remembered what Mori said and she
[1:53:58] listened to that as a head of the state,
[1:54:02] the leading lady like she did when she
[1:54:05] was brought up.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; I say
[1:54:08] to all here,
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; though we may not be children, that is a
[1:54:14] principle we should not forget.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And now comes the great test.
[1:54:24] And there's uh
[1:54:26] Hmon has raised up. I'm just going to be
[1:54:29] a few minutes. Just give me a few
[1:54:31] minutes. Hmon has raised up and he hates
[1:54:34] the Jews
[1:54:37] or could be Christians, but he hated the
[1:54:39] Jews. And now he gets a he gets a
[1:54:42] declaration from the king that they
[1:54:46] would be slain. and and it's it's taken
[1:54:49] out to all of the provinces that on a
[1:54:52] certain day the Jews you'll gather them
[1:54:56] and slay them. That spirit Hitler did
[1:54:59] the same thing.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we don't have to talk
[1:55:04] about whether our whether we're Soviet
[1:55:06] or whether we're Jewish or whether we're
[1:55:07] Russian or what we are. The world is the
[1:55:10] world
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; and it's the devil to begin with.
[1:55:15] Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; That's been all down through history
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; cuz God chose those people to be in a to
[1:55:22] be a certain uh to be of a certain class
[1:55:26] in the world as a as a he raised them up
[1:55:29] as a symbol to the world.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And so they're going to slay them. And
[1:55:36] so now Esther is put into this awkward
[1:55:39] position
[1:55:41] that she's a Jew and one has been Hmon
[1:55:45] has been elevated to above all the
[1:55:48] princes of the nation and he has come to
[1:55:52] let uh uh let the king know these people
[1:55:56] they don't bow to every order because
[1:56:00] Mori wouldn't bow to him. I don't know
[1:56:03] how many principles I've given in this
[1:56:05] service, but I hope you're picking them
[1:56:07] up. And here's one I use all the time. I
[1:56:10] want to give it to this congregation.
[1:56:12] When the enemy this and the enemy that
[1:56:14] and the devil this and Satan that, I
[1:56:17] want to say to you in the name of the
[1:56:18] Lord Jesus Christ, don't bow to him.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; When you recognize this is not right.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; This is from the kingdom of darkness.
[1:56:29] Don't bow to him.
[1:56:32] whether it's physical, whether it's a
[1:56:34] pain, whether it's spiritual, whether
[1:56:36] it's depression, whatever it is, don't
[1:56:39] bow to him.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; And that drives the devil crazy.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; And we're happy that it drives him
[1:56:46] crazy. And it drove Hmon crazy.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "What?" Even though I'm
[1:56:51] elevated to the highest position of the
[1:56:54] head of all the princes, I'm the head
[1:56:56] prince.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; And he was next to the king.
[1:57:00] Yeah.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; And he came out and all the servants are
[1:57:04] bowing before him. And Hmon, he won't
[1:57:07] bow.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; He won't bow.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; He won't regard him.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; He won't give any honor.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, that
[1:57:18] should be that should be something
[1:57:20] that's an absolute in our lives.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to bow. I'm not going to
[1:57:24] bend. I'm not going to compromise. And
[1:57:27] I'm not going to burn.
[1:57:33] And it drove him just wild.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What good is all of this
[1:57:38] glory for me if this Hmon I mean, if
[1:57:41] this Morai won't bow?"
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; So he goes into the king. There's
[1:57:45] there's some people that won't bow. And
[1:57:47] he he he identified the Jews. Said
[1:57:50] they're against our customs, etc., etc.
[1:57:52] and he wanted a a a signed letter with a
[1:57:56] king's ring that they would be
[1:57:57] destroyed.
[1:57:59] And so then now Mori says to her, and
[1:58:02] it's a good thing she's still listening.
[1:58:05] Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; And he says, if you allto together
[1:58:10] hold your peace
[1:58:12] at this time, then shall there be there
[1:58:16] an enlargement
[1:58:18] and deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:58:21] another place.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; You talk about confidence.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; You talk about faith. This is one Jew
[1:58:28] that wasn't going to be moved. I'd like
[1:58:31] out of this congregation for people to
[1:58:32] say, "This is one believer that will not
[1:58:35] be moved.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; I don't care what Satan throws at us. I
[1:58:40] don't care what happens. I don't care
[1:58:42] what the devil's got in his up his
[1:58:44] sleeve. I will not be moved."
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You throw all the glamour, throw
[1:58:51] the best job, throw the biggest biggest
[1:58:55] bonuses or whatever more or throw
[1:58:57] sickness or throw disease or throw
[1:59:00] whatever he can throw at you. But I will
[1:59:02] not bend
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; and I'll not compromise
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; and I'll not be moved by it.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'd like to see a whole
[1:59:10] congregation of people rise up and say,
[1:59:12] "I don't care
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; what this world has. I don't care what
[1:59:16] this world throws up. I'm not going to
[1:59:18] be moved by it.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Husbands, wives, young people, whoever
[1:59:25] they are, parents, what happens to your
[1:59:28] children, hold on. Hold fast to the
[1:59:30] promise.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Pray that God give you grace to receive
[1:59:42] what I have to say this morning because
[1:59:44] this is the road to authority. Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; This is a road and you need authority.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You need to exercise it.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; You say where I need authority. You'll
[1:59:54] need authority to say, "Satan,
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; depart from me."
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You need authority perhaps as a husband
[2:00:02] or a man to pray in your home. Say,
[2:00:06] "Satan, loose them."
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; But you have to be under authority to
[2:00:14] exercise authority. And it's not just
[2:00:17] for a single event. You might go through
[2:00:19] a lot. It went through her entire life.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; From childhood. This is all back when
[2:00:25] she was an orphan.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; She lost mother. She lost dad.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; She's raised by a strange family. Now
[2:00:33] she's in a strange country. Now she's in
[2:00:35] a palace. She doesn't know anything
[2:00:37] about palaces and being a queen.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; But she knew one thing. What I am,
[2:00:44] that's sufficient.
[2:00:45] I don't need anything else.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; And I want to say something to you, my
[2:00:49] brother, my sister, in this le oysia. I
[2:00:52] don't care what the world throws our
[2:00:53] way. I don't care how sophisticated. I
[2:00:56] don't care how techn technological he
[2:00:59] becomes. What we have is sufficient to
[2:01:02] overcome in this generation. God has not
[2:01:05] left us short changed. This word is
[2:01:08] still sharper than any two-edged sword.
[2:01:13] Amen.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; And this Jew,
[2:01:20] he said, "If you don't rise up,
[2:01:23] God will just bring deliverance from
[2:01:25] some other place."
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; God's plan is not going to be defeated.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And uh
[2:01:37] if you hold your peace, there'll be an
[2:01:39] enlargement that will arise from another
[2:01:41] place.
[2:01:47] But thou and thy father's house shall be
[2:01:49] destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou
[2:01:51] art come to the kingdom? What words of
[2:01:54] this? Who knoweth but what thou art come
[2:01:56] to the kingdom for such a time as this?
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to lift that out of the
[2:02:01] book of Esther and I want to bring it
[2:02:03] right down to May the 6th, 19 I mean
[2:02:07] 2012.
[2:02:08] May the 6th, 2012.
[2:02:12] Whatever is taking place in your life,
[2:02:15] whatever has taken place or whatever
[2:02:18] will take place,
[2:02:22] the best thing you can do right now
[2:02:24] while we're sitting here is to realize
[2:02:28] God brought me here for just such a time
[2:02:32] as this. Amen.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; And he has deposited in me what I need
[2:02:38] to do his job and his commission in this
[2:02:41] hour.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; You need to have that as a result.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; I wish you would acknowledge it.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; I trust you will acknowledge it.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; God has brought me here for this hour
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; and he has equipped me for what I need
[2:02:57] to serve his kingdom.
[2:03:08] And finally she said go gather.
[2:03:11] She decided she was very very sharp,
[2:03:14] very cunning. She said she went into the
[2:03:18] king and he lifted the scepter because
[2:03:21] he wouldn't have her destroyed.
[2:03:24] and she told them about herself and
[2:03:27] about her people.
[2:03:29] And uh she said, "If I perish, I
[2:03:32] perish." That's where the course comes
[2:03:35] from. And she goes in and she has a
[2:03:38] request. And she said, "I would like to
[2:03:42] make a feast."
[2:03:44] Hang on.
[2:03:46] Now, here's the bride saying, "I'd like
[2:03:48] to make a feast,
[2:03:51] and I'd like the king to come."
[2:03:55] And she said, "I'd like also Hmon to
[2:03:57] come, ahead of all the princes." So,
[2:04:00] they both came.
[2:04:02] Hmon was beside himself.
[2:04:05] He because he was possessed of that one
[2:04:07] said, "I will
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; I will exalt myself.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; I will I'm up here at the top.
[2:04:15] I'm right. I'm the right-hand man.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that's left.
[2:04:26] That's control of the whole kingdom.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Oh. So, he was possessed with that same
[2:04:32] spirit.
[2:04:33] and he went home after they had that
[2:04:36] feast and uh
[2:04:41] and just the three of them, the queen,
[2:04:44] the king, and Hmon.
[2:04:47] And she said, "Now," she said, "if I
[2:04:49] found favor in your sight." She says,
[2:04:51] "I'd like to have one more feast
[2:04:53] tomorrow."
[2:04:55] and says then I will say because he told
[2:04:57] her he said
[2:05:00] to half the kingdom whatever you want to
[2:05:02] half the kingdom
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; right
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; 127 she could have almost had you know
[2:05:09] almost 65
[2:05:12] nations under her to have the kingdom.
[2:05:16] Wow.
[2:05:17] Just think what she could have had.
[2:05:20] She's only interested in one thing.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; What I'm here for.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Right. what I'm here for. Not the
[2:05:26] blessings, not all the benefits, it's
[2:05:28] what I'm here for.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And uh so the it comes the next day and
[2:05:36] she says, "Now now I will tell you why I
[2:05:38] had the feast. There is an enemy of my
[2:05:42] people
[2:05:44] who is out to destroy us and to
[2:05:47] eliminate us and to annihilate us."
[2:05:50] He says, "Who could be so wicked as
[2:05:52] that?"
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Right? says, "The man that's sitting
[2:05:54] here with you,"
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; says, "Take him out and have him
[2:05:59] destroyed." And he hung on the gallows
[2:06:02] that he had made for Mori cuz he was
[2:06:04] going to hang Mori. And he was so beside
[2:06:07] himself, so filled with ecstasy that he
[2:06:10] just thought that this is this is what's
[2:06:12] going to happen. And the Bible says
[2:06:14] this,
[2:06:20] and this is right at the very end
[2:06:23] of her life and the end of the book of
[2:06:26] Esther. Then Esther the queen, the
[2:06:30] daughter of Abahel,
[2:06:32] and Morortei the Jew
[2:06:34] wrote with all authority
[2:06:38] to confirm this second letter of Purim,
[2:06:43] which is the feast of Esther. And the
[2:06:46] Jews today, my wife and I were there
[2:06:48] last time in Israel. The whole nation
[2:06:51] was celebrating Purim, which is the
[2:06:54] feast of Esther. because they're
[2:06:56] celebrating that God used her and Mori,
[2:07:00] but used her especially to go into the
[2:07:02] king to intercede and two people saved a
[2:07:06] nation.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. I might be I
[2:07:12] might be regarded as off my top, but I
[2:07:16] can tell you that you will not know what
[2:07:19] your life has achieved. The life that's
[2:07:22] under authority, the life that's under
[2:07:25] submission. Don't you want to do
[2:07:27] something for the kingdom of God? Don't
[2:07:29] end up over there empty-handed. That's
[2:07:32] why I'm preaching. You're still here.
[2:07:34] You're breathing.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; You can do something for God. You don't
[2:07:38] have to be visually prominent or
[2:07:40] whatever more. I tell you, you can say a
[2:07:42] prayer. She wasn't out in front. There
[2:07:45] wasn't millions of people that saw what
[2:07:46] she was doing. She just she she coo had
[2:07:49] a meal cooked.
[2:07:51] Yes,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; she did what a woman does.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; But she submitted herself to her old
[2:07:58] uncle.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't Unk out there or some
[2:08:03] disrespectful thing.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; It's her uncle Morai. Not her uncle, but
[2:08:07] the man who brought her up.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; You think this is, you know, I'm not
[2:08:15] preaching to the air. What would what
[2:08:17] would you do? you found out, oh, your
[2:08:20] your parent is not your parent, it's
[2:08:22] your adopted parent. I've dealt with all
[2:08:24] kinds of cases and the young people feel
[2:08:27] entirely different. Oh, you're not my
[2:08:29] father or you're not my mother. I'm I'm
[2:08:32] adopted. It didn't make any difference
[2:08:34] with her. He was a Jew. She was a Jew.
[2:08:37] And I'm saying this congregation,
[2:08:38] they're a believer, we're a believer.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. You're a believer.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's where the subject
[2:08:46] ends right there.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; He was old. She was young.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; I'm old. You're young.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; What's the difference?
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Not much difference, is there?
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; What's a What's a few years to God say,
[2:09:05] "Oh, they're 50 years older than me. Who
[2:09:08] cares?
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; What's the difference in God's economy?"
[2:09:12] Absolutely none. Says, "Oh, he doesn't
[2:09:14] understand." And well, he does.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; That father does. He understands it. He
[2:09:20] knows exactly what you need. Exactly
[2:09:22] what this church needs. He knows what
[2:09:24] this generation is calling for. And his
[2:09:26] Holy Spirit, I know, has been striving
[2:09:28] in these meetings because I can feel it.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; The devil's on the war path.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; But God is also.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought I should I thought I
[2:09:45] should give you this and I'll close.
[2:09:49] And this great warrior Joshua he's
[2:09:51] speaking of. Hallelujah.
[2:09:56] The devils are on the move
[2:09:59] for Jesus Christ the chief captain said
[2:10:04] in my name they shall cast out devils.
[2:10:08] That is as powerful at this very moment
[2:10:11] as it was when he spoke it or it was
[2:10:13] when Jesus spoke it. He said, "The
[2:10:16] devils are on the move." Not because you
[2:10:19] have a lot of faith or we're some
[2:10:20] treasured people. Because Jesus said
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; in my name,
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; they shall cast out devils.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; You might not have heard that. You might
[2:10:30] not remember that. I will tell you what,
[2:10:33] there's those here in the in the spirit
[2:10:36] world that know very well what Jesus
[2:10:39] said
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; and they know it speaks of them.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says they're on
[2:10:45] the move.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; They're moving. They're stirring. a
[2:10:49] demon in that demon world are stirring
[2:10:53] because the God's word has said
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; in my name
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; they shall cast out devils.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; He said they failed to get it 40 years
[2:11:04] ago but were coming in now possessing
[2:11:06] the land. The same pillar of fire. The
[2:11:10] same chief captain is leading the host
[2:11:13] of the Lord. And it's your land. God
[2:11:16] promised promised to prosper you in
[2:11:19] health. He gave you that body.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't we agree with this? He gave
[2:11:25] you that body. The one you're sitting
[2:11:27] in. He gave you that body. It's yours by
[2:11:31] possession. The devil's trying to take
[2:11:33] it over. He hasn't got the authority to
[2:11:36] do it.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Maybe trying to tempt some young people
[2:11:45] away with some glamour or some some
[2:11:48] thing of the world or some attainment or
[2:11:50] something else. You want to say to
[2:11:52] yourself, he hasn't got the authority to
[2:11:54] do it.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in me than he
[2:11:59] that's in the world.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; They're on the move. Yeah,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; they're being disturbed.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; They're being disturbed because Jesus,
[2:12:08] the master,
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he spoke the word in my
[2:12:13] name. They'll cast them out.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; You know what Satan's afraid of? That
[2:12:17] you'll get enough faith right now to
[2:12:19] say, "Get out of my life.
[2:12:22] Get out of my home."
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Get out of my body.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:30] Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; He's trembling tonight. He said
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; and I want to say he's trembling this
[2:12:43] morning.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; And then he said hallelujah. And I'm
[2:12:46] going to say hallelujah. I'm going to
[2:12:48] ask you to say hallelujah.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Why are we saying hallelujah? Because
[2:12:52] he's trembling.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said we have authority over him to
[2:12:58] cast him out. And those spirits in
[2:13:00] another world are actually moving
[2:13:02] around. They're distressed.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; In case you might believe it,
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; that prophet of God even heard the
[2:13:11] demons scream out from one person in the
[2:13:13] audience to another person. And he says
[2:13:16] those two spirits are crying between
[2:13:17] themselves trying to get the people to
[2:13:20] disbelieve.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; I say to Satan today, scream all you
[2:13:28] want. Hallelujah.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; You'll not achieve your goal.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Scream all you want. We shall believe
[2:13:34] the words of God.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Scream all you want. We will
[2:13:41] cast you out. You will not have any part
[2:13:44] with us in our inheritance.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know right well that
[2:13:53] God has done glorious things for you.
[2:13:58] Friends, I stand here not as a young man
[2:14:00] anymore. I preached this way when I was
[2:14:03] young. I was against his kingdom when I
[2:14:05] was young. Nothing has changed in these
[2:14:08] 55 years of preaching. Nothing has
[2:14:10] changed. I believe it exactly the same.
[2:14:14] I'm calling for others to stand up and
[2:14:16] take the take the banner and take the
[2:14:19] baton and run this last lap.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:14:27] Glory to God.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; We need families. We need individuals.
[2:14:31] We need young men. We need young ladies.
[2:14:34] We need children.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That believe it and will
[2:14:37] give themselves to it.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How old do you have to be?
[2:14:42] Gypsy Smith who won thousands of Christ.
[2:14:45] A gypsy.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; One is really considered low
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; in the earth. He was saved when he was 8
[2:14:52] years old.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Who's eight?
[2:14:55] Who's eight? Raise your hand. Nobody
[2:14:58] eight. Isn't that amazing?
[2:15:02] Is there anybody nine?
[2:15:04] That'll be somebody. Yes. Here we have
[2:15:06] some nine. Gypsy Smith was saved younger
[2:15:08] than you.
[2:15:10] And he became a mighty man of God
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; and gave his life to God
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; from 8 years old on up.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; I remember standing in front of a
[2:15:24] service in a tent at four years old
[2:15:27] singing there's honey in the rock.
[2:15:29] There's honey in the rock for you. It
[2:15:32] was about the only song I knew and I
[2:15:33] loved that song. Oh, there's honey in
[2:15:36] the rock, my brother. There's honey in
[2:15:38] the rock for you. Let your sins for the
[2:15:41] blood to cover. There's honey in the
[2:15:44] rock for you. And it's just as powerful
[2:15:47] today as it was back then. Glory to God.
[2:15:50] Nothing's changed. I am the Lord. I
[2:15:53] change not.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; He wants people to have the joy in the
[2:15:59] victory and live under this wonderful
[2:16:02] covenant that God has given.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; And he said he's not got the authority.
[2:16:12] You believing this?
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet saying he's trembling
[2:16:16] tonight. I say he's trembling this
[2:16:19] morning.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; A great whirl of God's power moving in
[2:16:27] the building.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; And Satan's trembling. I say to you in
[2:16:31] the balcony, I say to you in this
[2:16:33] congregation, I say to you in the
[2:16:34] streaming, Satan's trembling
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; because of what God has given his
[2:16:41] church.
[2:16:44] He's trembling
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; because there's never been a people
[2:16:47] that's received such a vindicated
[2:16:49] message.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; He's trembling.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; He's never met a people that's had such
[2:16:54] a revelation.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; He's trembling. This is the first
[2:16:58] generation had the seals open.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; If I were him, I'd tremble, too.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Here's the people that are not going to
[2:17:07] give up
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; and they're not going to compromise.
[2:17:10] Here's what people are going to listen
[2:17:12] and hear the preaching of the word
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; and they're going to give themselves to
[2:17:16] the word
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; and they're they're a great danger to my
[2:17:19] kingdom. And I say, you're right, Satan.
[2:17:22] We're a danger to your kingdom. We're a
[2:17:25] people that are here to destroy your
[2:17:27] kingdom. We're a people that are saying,
[2:17:30] "Let thy kingdom come. Let that kingdom
[2:17:33] of holiness come. Let the people of that
[2:17:36] kingdom arise.
[2:17:38] Glory to God.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we rejoice?
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Yes,
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; he's trembling."
[2:17:56] Oh, what if they'd only have faith? He's
[2:17:58] talking to the people. His heart's about
[2:18:01] gone. Speaking of Satan, it's melted in
[2:18:04] him.
[2:18:07] Hallelujah.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Looking into another realm, saying the
[2:18:12] very heart of Satan is melted in him.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; For I tell you this prophet, he truly
[2:18:18] lived in two worlds.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, the doctor said I Yeah,
[2:18:25] the doctor said."
[2:18:29] He said, "Yeah, but they realize that
[2:18:32] the host of the Lord is moving now." And
[2:18:36] that's right. No matter how high he's
[2:18:39] walled in, how high Satan has walled
[2:18:42] himself in, he's uh he said he may he
[2:18:46] may have walled it out of the sight of
[2:18:48] the doctor, but hasn't walled it out of
[2:18:51] the sight of God. He might be a great
[2:18:54] big bluff to the medical science, but he
[2:18:58] isn't a big bluff to God.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; He said the man of God ministers
[2:19:07] anointed with the Holy Ghost. And we'll
[2:19:10] be having a number of ministers in.
[2:19:11] Friends, don't just think this is
[2:19:13] brother so and so from over there and
[2:19:14] this brother so and so here and we're
[2:19:16] having brother Puit to preach. He's a
[2:19:18] man of God.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Satan's Satan's
[2:19:23] trembling right now.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; I can guarantee you he's trembling right
[2:19:27] now for the faith that is building up in
[2:19:30] the people of God. And I have felt a
[2:19:32] supercharge.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; I have felt absolutely supercharged
[2:19:36] because there's going to be a there
[2:19:38] there's going to be a a group of people
[2:19:40] within this congregation that are giving
[2:19:43] themselves
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; not only to what they read, but the
[2:19:46] moving of the spirit that's coming in
[2:19:48] the services. Amen.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; And it's come for a purpose. Say, "What
[2:19:53] is the purpose?" So you can go out these
[2:19:55] doors and exercise authority.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; He's got plans for you. But I want Satan
[2:20:02] to know today, we have plans for him.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; He's going to come knocking on your
[2:20:08] door, and you're going to resist him. He
[2:20:11] going to come knocking on the door of
[2:20:12] your body to make you sick, make you
[2:20:15] ill, and Satan is going to be told to
[2:20:17] get out according to the word of God.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; I am one of those.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; I'm part of that number.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hey folks,
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; I've had them come to my body many
[2:20:32] times.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; You better believe that. Many times we
[2:20:36] had to stand there toe to toe and
[2:20:38] eyeball to eyeball. Amen.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be up here preaching if it
[2:20:42] hadn't been for the supernatural hand of
[2:20:45] almighty God
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; and my confidence in the word of God.
[2:20:48] And just simple phrase that the prophet
[2:20:50] of God said, "Healing is in the body."
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; I just held on to that when sickness or
[2:20:55] something else comes. Healing is in my
[2:20:57] body.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I let the doctors do what
[2:21:01] they need to do, but healing is in my
[2:21:03] body.
[2:21:06] If you're in physical need, and we're
[2:21:08] not here having a healing campaign, but
[2:21:09] if you're in physical need, you can
[2:21:12] certainly experience and exercise your
[2:21:15] authority.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're one under
[2:21:18] authority.
[2:21:22] It says, "Ministers of God with the Holy
[2:21:24] Ghost, they have just as much right,
[2:21:26] just as much authority to pray for the
[2:21:29] sick and cast out a devil as anyone else
[2:21:32] does in the world." He said, "Don't you
[2:21:34] believe it?" I do believe it.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; What does this mean to you, saints?
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Don't be backward. Don't be bashful.
[2:21:47] If you believe it with all your heart.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; What are we here for? We're here to
[2:21:55] prove that our Lord Jesus is victorious.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; We're here to prove that Calvary stands
[2:22:00] true.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; We're here to prove the devil's a liar
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; at every point.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Here's a man right here. Stand. Joseph.
[2:22:17] A few weeks ago, this man could hardly
[2:22:19] walk
[2:22:21] and people that love him called me.
[2:22:25] And this is not to say to destroy
[2:22:28] anybody's faith whatsoever. He said, "I
[2:22:30] feel that I have a promise from God, but
[2:22:33] he had a great big lump on his leg and
[2:22:37] his weight went down
[2:22:40] and became very frail." And one of the
[2:22:43] brothers that love our brother called
[2:22:45] and said, "I'm worried. I'm concerned.
[2:22:48] If it were me, he'd be in the emergency.
[2:22:51] He'd be in the ambulance and I'd be
[2:22:54] calling 911 right now." That's what the
[2:22:57] brother said. Brother Joseph's never
[2:22:58] heard that.
[2:23:00] He said, "If it were me, the last I saw
[2:23:03] him, I'd be calling 911."
[2:23:06] That's just a few weeks ago.
[2:23:10] So he said, "Would you please call
[2:23:11] Brother Joseph?" I said, 'Well, I have
[2:23:14] called him. We've spoken together. He
[2:23:16] gave me the scripture out of the Bible
[2:23:17] that God made real to him. And I said,
[2:23:20] "I don't want to tamper with his faith."
[2:23:23] And he called again and said, "Would you
[2:23:25] please call him?"
[2:23:27] So I called brother Joseph.
[2:23:31] Come here, brother Joseph.
[2:23:38] I said, "Brother Joseph, I'm talking to
[2:23:41] you now like my son.
[2:23:44] If you were my boy, I'd simply tell you,
[2:23:48] go there and they'll tell you what it
[2:23:50] is.
[2:23:51] It has nothing to do with your faith.
[2:23:53] Your faith is in God. Healing is in
[2:23:55] God."
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; But they'll they'll and and the prophet
[2:23:58] of God, now we come in submission to
[2:24:01] authority.
[2:24:02] The prophet of God said, "A doctor will
[2:24:05] cut the bad part out."
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; A prophet of God said that
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; the doctor will cut a bad part out,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; but God does the healing.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; I said, "Would you please for me go to
[2:24:19] the emergency and have them tell you
[2:24:22] what that is?" Is that right?
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:27] It was a great big mass
[2:24:30] that was poisoning his whole system
[2:24:33] and they cut the bad part out and God
[2:24:36] healed him.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's not years and years ago. That's a
[2:24:52] few days ago.
[2:24:54] Yes. Amen.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's a brother sitting here in church
[2:24:56] driving all the way from Seattle.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; That's the word
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; that came to us.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's the authority we're under.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; He said the absolute might not be what
[2:25:11] we the answer we want. Say, well,
[2:25:15] brother Joseph said, I just want God to
[2:25:18] do it. And I was submitting myself. I I
[2:25:22] say amen to that.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; If a person's faith is there and that's
[2:25:26] the will of God and the desire of God,
[2:25:29] all I know is that it was not his time
[2:25:31] to go
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; and he was fading to nothing.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; So I have to submit myself under
[2:25:37] authority in order to give authority and
[2:25:40] say go
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; as my son go.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; And they whisked him right in and
[2:25:49] operated and took a huge mass off his
[2:25:52] leg that was poisoning him.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Friends, I know what I'm talking about.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; And I want this congregation to receive
[2:26:02] that.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And respect and honor. I'm
[2:26:06] not talking about respecting honor
[2:26:07] minister. I'm talking about everybody.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Every person desires that. You young
[2:26:12] people, your parents deserve honor. And
[2:26:14] parents deserve to live so that their
[2:26:17] children will respect them.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let them see you in the
[2:26:22] house of God. Let them see you on your
[2:26:24] knees. Let them see you serving God with
[2:26:27] all your heart. Let them see you
[2:26:29] worshiping God with your life.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Esther worshiped him with his life, her
[2:26:33] life. Mori, he laid his life on the
[2:26:36] line. And because they did that, they
[2:26:39] were able to write a letter with all
[2:26:41] authority to all the other Jews.
[2:26:44] Hallelujah.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; And you know,
[2:26:48] I was going to preach on the bride's
[2:26:51] feast because I was going to take it,
[2:26:53] but I thought I would lose you there.
[2:26:55] So, I'm preaching on authority. But she
[2:26:57] made a feast. And they call the feast
[2:27:00] purim.
[2:27:03] And it means it's a it's a celebration
[2:27:06] that the plan of Satan was crushed.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:13] I say hallelujah to God. How I thank God
[2:27:17] for the message. The confusion of
[2:27:19] denominationalism was crushed.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; The false doctrines of the Trinity was
[2:27:24] crushed.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's feast.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, come all things are ready.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to the Lamb. Hallelujah.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:38] Will you stand to your feet with me
[2:27:40] while we give him praise and
[2:27:41] thanksgiving? Heavenly Father, I want to
[2:27:44] thank you. Thank you for this glorious
[2:27:47] truth. Thank you for your word. Oh God,
[2:27:50] it's not a lot of just uh doctrines and
[2:27:54] so on, but it's glorious truth that you
[2:27:57] have unveiled to your bride. Let this be
[2:28:00] more than just a gathering place of a
[2:28:03] church, Father, but let it be a place
[2:28:05] where Satan fears the people and the
[2:28:08] lives of the people. I pray, Father,
[2:28:12] that you will do mighty things even this
[2:28:13] morning.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; As I have spoken, Father, I have felt
[2:28:17] and sense the words that your prophet
[2:28:19] has spoken. They're just as real this
[2:28:22] very moment. And the enemy is howling.
[2:28:25] He's afraid he's going to be cast out
[2:28:28] and cast down. And there are people
[2:28:30] here, Lord, perhaps young people making
[2:28:32] decisions. They've got to make a major
[2:28:35] decision. They know a decision is
[2:28:37] weighing on them. I say, oh God, with
[2:28:40] the authority of the Holy Spirit. May
[2:28:42] you go into their lives and grip them.
[2:28:44] And they may not even be here in the in
[2:28:47] this building, go to wherever they are.
[2:28:49] Make their life miserable. Take sleep
[2:28:52] away from them. Do whatever is necessary
[2:28:54] to bring them to repentance
[2:28:57] in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Satan,
[2:29:00] you are defeated. And we bind you. We
[2:29:03] bind your power and we bind you with
[2:29:06] chains of circumstance.
[2:29:08] You will not succeed in your objectives
[2:29:11] and goals.

[2:31:09] the churches and we have a eye of a
[2:31:13] prophet saw through your trickery and
[2:31:15] declared us the truth. Hallelujah. And
[2:31:18] we have a wonderful table prepared in
[2:31:20] the presence of our enemies. Jesus has a
