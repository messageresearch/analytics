[7:13] You are worthy, oh God. The faithful
[7:15] have gathered. Eagles have soared in
[7:18] this morning, desiring to feed on the
[7:21] body, word of the Son of Man. Prayers
[7:24] have been prayed. Lives have been set
[7:27] aside, desiring that the moving of the
[7:30] Holy Spirit would be seen in this upper
[7:33] room this morning.
[7:35] Lord, we're not looking for an outward
[7:37] expression. We're not looking for signs
[7:39] and wonders, but we're looking for the
[7:41] inner change of these bodies.
[7:44] Lord, we're looking for this fleshly man
[7:46] to fall away, Christ to be made visible
[7:49] within our lives. Oh God, we're looking
[7:52] for a new body. We're looking for the
[7:54] promise of your word to come to pass in
[7:58] our daily lives. Lord, we want to walk
[8:01] like Enoch walked, Lord, so close to you
[8:04] that one day you just said, "Come up a
[8:05] little higher.
[8:07] Come up a little higher, Enoch. You
[8:09] don't need to walk down here anymore."
[8:12] Lord, help us to come under that
[8:14] inspiration this morning.
[8:16] Lord, as we look into your word, oh God,
[8:18] as the pastor would come, Lord, may he
[8:22] just bring the people, oh God, into a
[8:25] heavenly plane, oh God, may we watch the
[8:29] very pathway that the prophet has
[8:31] walked. May it give us faith, Lord, to
[8:34] walk into that eternal day, oh God.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:39] Hallelujah.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[8:43] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[8:49] Lord this morning?

[16:53] In this presence, we want to go to
[16:54] prayer this morning. I'll ask Michael if
[16:56] you'd come this morning, Brother
[16:58] Michael, and lead us in a word of
[16:59] prayer.
[17:00] Several requests to mention before the
[17:02] church this morning. Brother Israel from
[17:04] Seattle would like to request that the
[17:06] saints pray for the mother of Sister
[17:09] Sharon, another sister from Seattle
[17:11] whose mother is in a comeomaosse
[17:14] condition since yesterday.
[17:17] She's under assisted breathing
[17:19] respiration at this time. So we just ask
[17:21] that the Lord would move on her behalf
[17:24] this morning. Deliver her.
[17:26] Brother Juan Carlos is asking that we
[17:28] pray for his uncle Boris and son and
[17:30] daughter. His uncle's wife went to be
[17:32] with the Lord this morning in El
[17:33] Salvador. Just asking that the Lord
[17:36] would have his way. Just pray that this
[17:38] prayers of the saints, the Lord would
[17:41] comfort them, that family.
[17:44] Want to also pray for a complete healing
[17:46] of the uncle of Mr. Jose Fienza
[17:50] diagnosed in Vancouver General Hospital.
[17:52] He's been found with lung cancer. He's
[17:54] been given about 6 months to live. We
[17:57] know that all things are possible in
[18:00] Christ the name of the Lord. Amen. That
[18:03] he's this healer. That's from brother
[18:05] Leon Garland. So we just trust that the
[18:08] Lord will have his way this morning. If
[18:11] you have a need on your heart, Lord is
[18:13] more than faithful this morning. The
[18:16] water's troubled, friends. I'd say step
[18:19] right in. Amen. this morning. Make your
[18:22] no your need known by the uplifted hand
[18:24] as we go to prayer this morning. God
[18:26] bless you, Michael.

[19:08] slain before the foundation of the
[19:10] world, Lord. Lord, your great redemption
[19:12] plan, Lord, was all in place, Lord. You

[23:07] here that the US and Canadian donation
[23:09] receipts are still available at the
[23:11] office after the service today. That is
[23:13] one remaining uh announcement that needs
[23:16] to be said. But I'd like to make an
[23:17] announcement to our young people. I've
[23:19] talked to brother Kry Diggs this week
[23:22] and uh brother Kry I've um shared
[23:25] meetings with in Quebec last May and um
[23:28] we're going to have a camp a winter camp
[23:31] and it's going to be March the 11th to
[23:33] the 14th. We will get in on a Thursday
[23:36] night and we'll have Friday, Saturday,
[23:38] and Sunday. And we're going to have a
[23:40] time. Amen.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a time
[23:44] &gt;&gt; cuz I know brother Kry and I know his
[23:46] his uh his desire for the things of God.
[23:50] I said to brother Biscll, I said um I've
[23:52] preached a lot of camps over my course
[23:54] of life around the uh the states and
[23:57] over into Europe and I preached with a
[24:00] lot of men. But I've uh had a special
[24:02] connection with brother Kiddry because I
[24:05] I have been mentored I guess under
[24:08] brother Bisll and found out that when
[24:10] you travel you don't travel so much you
[24:12] get to a location and you end up in a
[24:13] room and you stay in that room until the
[24:15] meetings are over and if you get a day
[24:17] off after that day that you fly out
[24:19] that's what you get. And um different
[24:22] men have different ways that they uh
[24:24] prepare and that's just something that
[24:27] we do. and uh with brother Kry found a
[24:31] kind a kindered spirit in the sense that
[24:34] he would not leave his room and he would
[24:36] be praying through the night early
[24:39] morning late at night after the services
[24:41] I said that's my kind of man and uh he
[24:44] is a wonderful brother and Lord willing
[24:47] he's um he's committed to coming so
[24:50] we're going to have that winter camp
[24:51] it'll be grade 8 up to 25 years of age
[24:56] plus what we're going to do. We're going
[24:58] to make it available cuz with brother
[25:00] Kry's kind of ministry, it is um it's a
[25:03] ministry that actually will uh will
[25:05] benefit the full scope that is even
[25:08] here. And um we're going to open it up,
[25:10] of course, to the young couples that
[25:12] will um help at at senior camp. And um I
[25:17] know that's one way you can get to camp
[25:18] if you're a little bit older, what we
[25:20] call, you know, middle age around 23,
[25:22] 25, you know, that age. So, we're going
[25:25] to make that available to you to come.
[25:27] And um I want to say something to the
[25:29] Drake family. Uh God bless you all. The
[25:32] whole clan. I'll just blanketed that. I
[25:34] was up at the camp Thursday and Friday.
[25:36] We had some business we needed to do up
[25:38] there and I got to stay at at the I
[25:41] think we're going to rename it. It It
[25:43] was called the right cabin and I It was
[25:46] the right cabin for me. Uh it was
[25:49] beautiful. You've done a great job. And
[25:51] I drove by and saw Ben's cabin. what Ben
[25:53] and the brothers did and it was
[25:55] phenomenal. I said, "I love this place."
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Why aren't I at this place more often?
[26:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, the presence of God is there and
[26:03] you see what the lab the labor of the
[26:05] sons and daughters of God. It's a great
[26:07] event. I don't Pat, I don't know how
[26:09] much you work there, but letting Dave
[26:11] all do all the work, that was
[26:12] phenomenal. Thank you so much. And it'll
[26:15] be a blessing to all. So, we're going to
[26:17] try and squeeze as much as we can and if
[26:19] we can creep up into that older group,
[26:22] you know, around 30-ish,
[26:26] we're going to squeeze you in. We're
[26:27] going to fill up the camp and we're
[26:29] going to try something a little bit
[26:30] different. You just have to pray that
[26:32] the log uh chapel gets just bigger
[26:35] somehow. We'd like to maybe crown it the
[26:37] the meeting with everybody there on the
[26:39] Sunday morning. Brother Biscll and I are
[26:41] going to talk about that. We're just
[26:42] going to try and see where we can
[26:43] shoehorn everybody in, but we're going
[26:45] to have a blessed time.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; So, be remembering the meetings uh in
[26:50] the youth camp. It'll be March 11th, the
[26:52] 14th. And God bless you all.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Does that sound wonderful?
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. How about a hand of applause to
[27:00] the Lord for providing this opportunity?
[27:04] Amen.
[27:07] Praise the Lord. You know why it's
[27:08] called an opportunity? because without
[27:10] it something might not have happened but
[27:12] because it's an opportunity something
[27:14] else can happen that's what we want for
[27:16] our young people I know I didn't have
[27:18] camp growing up when I was younger many
[27:20] of you know my testimony and I grew up
[27:22] in a message church and I went away from
[27:24] the Lord from about the time I was 16 17
[27:27] years old until I was 32 that's a very
[27:30] very long time to be out at sea a drift
[27:33] and I think back and I wonder if I'd
[27:35] have had a camp but I've given my heart
[27:38] to the Lord at camp spared myself years
[27:40] of scars and years of trials and what
[27:44] I've been sitting where you sit. Many of
[27:46] the ones that have grown up in the
[27:47] church and it's an awesome opportunity.
[27:50] Don't let it pass you by.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing My Hope is in
[27:54] the Lord as we turn the service to our
[27:56] pastor this morning, Brother Biscll.
[27:58] Just draw on the gift. We're here this
[28:01] morning. It's the Lord's day. Just
[28:03] center your focus upon what the Lord
[28:05] would have. I was praying this morning,
[28:06] Lord, just give us your heart. Give us
[28:10] the mind of Christ this morning for what
[28:12] you would do in the service this
[28:14] morning.
[28:19] My hope
[28:22] is in the Lord
[28:26] from this time on.

[28:54] the Lord.
[28:57] In whom the wisdom of the age
[29:02] is alive,
[29:05] for whom the raging of the saints
[29:10] subsides.
[29:13] He's the living sacrifice.

[30:49] [Music]
[30:53] Oh

[30:59] Let's all sing this morning
[31:03] the anthem of the church of God.

[31:55] Let's sing that verse again. That the
[31:57] last verse you sang.
[32:02] [Music]
[32:04] And our mercies come with every rising
[32:09] sun and truth. To be the savior in his
[32:14] broken
[32:16] day
[32:19] to offer healing and forgive.
[32:27] And those who trust me
[32:31] with my heart
[32:34] and
[32:35] my

[32:58] forever
[32:59] more.
[33:04] Hallelujah.
[33:07] He's worthy of all praise. He not. Amen.
[33:12] It's wonderful. Wonderful. I'm just
[33:15] going to let you have your seats for a
[33:17] few moments. And
[33:21] we're going to have uh next Sunday,
[33:23] February 7th, we're going to also have
[33:26] communion and footwashing the Lord's
[33:30] table. It's always a wonderful time.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; And we I would have announced it just a
[33:36] little bit earlier because especially
[33:38] those who like to come up from Seattle
[33:41] and usually there's quite a number like
[33:44] to come up. So, please tell your friends
[33:48] and those that are in the Seattle Tacoma
[33:50] area that want to come. Maybe sometimes
[33:53] they come from the Okanog and they come
[33:55] from far away because communion and
[33:58] footwashing is important to our us as
[34:01] believers. And so, we just want to
[34:03] welcome anybody who's within driving
[34:06] range and wants to come and be with us.
[34:08] You are just uh so so very very welcome.
[34:12] It's a blessed time and we'd love to
[34:14] share it with everyone.
[34:16] Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Love the worship.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Just seems to set the tone and gets us
[34:25] ready for the word. I I I just felt it
[34:29] was so uh so appropriate.
[34:34] Well, Brother Ryan, how does it feel
[34:39] any different?
[34:41] No different.
[34:44] Where's Sister Yelena?
[34:48] Up there.
[34:50] Well, we what we want to do, I want to
[34:54] have Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena, if
[34:57] you would come down, please. We want to
[35:00] pray a prayer of blessing.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; On this young couple. Don't you think
[35:05] that would be appropriate?
[35:07] &gt;&gt; How many here didn't get to go to the
[35:09] wedding?
[35:11] [Laughter]
[35:15] All right. Well, at least we can
[35:18] participate
[35:20] and we can pray a prayer of God's
[35:23] blessing upon this union.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; And that we want to do. Uh we'll just
[35:30] have brother Ryan and and sister Elena
[35:32] come
[35:35] down and join me here at the front.
[35:39] The other thing too,
[35:41] brother Ryan,
[35:43] bless you.
[35:47] Sister Elena, God bless you. Uh, the
[35:51] streaming con congregation
[35:54] need a chance to see this couple.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; So, be sure who's ever doing and
[36:00] handling the cameras, get these cameras
[36:03] on this couple here.
[36:06] They want to see him right now in
[36:08] Switzerland and Germany and Holland and
[36:12] Belgium and different places. And we
[36:16] want to express also our thanksgiving to
[36:20] you, brother Ryan. And now you, Sister
[36:23] Leena, have become a part of his
[36:26] ministry.
[36:28] You know, I remember and recall uh
[36:32] there seemed to be a time or a season
[36:36] when things just begin to change in
[36:39] brother Ryan's life.
[36:42] It just seemed to take on a different
[36:44] dimension.
[36:45] And it's in keeping with what I want to
[36:47] speak and minister this morning. And it
[36:49] is that there are times in our lives
[36:52] when God draws near.
[36:56] And when he draws near,
[36:59] everything changes.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful change. And I was
[37:04] thinking, Brother Ryan, Sister Elena,
[37:06] that when God called Abram, he didn't
[37:10] know what was in store for him, but he
[37:14] found himself at Bethl
[37:17] and uh
[37:19] he made an altar there and he worshiped
[37:23] God.
[37:24] And the Bible tells us that later on he
[37:28] went back and revisited that. And so I
[37:31] want to say to you as a couple, there
[37:33] are those times when God seems to draw
[37:35] very very near. And I'm sure he was very
[37:38] near while you had your uh vows spoken
[37:43] and uh your loved ones, your family. You
[37:48] have a wonderful family, Sister Elena.
[37:51] Wonderful family. and you've chosen a
[37:54] wonderful wife.
[37:58] And I want to just say to you as a as a
[38:00] friend and as a pastor,
[38:03] don't forget to go and visit Bethl
[38:05] again.
[38:08] And that's good for all of us. Remember
[38:12] that time and that place that was just
[38:14] special.
[38:15] and you can go back there
[38:19] and you can meet him and talk to him.
[38:23] And so I'd like if you all would just
[38:26] join with me and we're going to pray
[38:28] God's blessing on brother Ryan and
[38:31] sister Yena.
[38:35] Father,
[38:38] these dear, precious lives
[38:41] that you have allowed our footsteps to
[38:44] cross their pathway.
[38:47] You've allowed their lives to be a
[38:50] blessing to us, Brother Ryan, and his
[38:52] gift and his talent. Has been dedicated
[38:55] to your service.
[38:58] He's heard your call. He's been faithful
[39:01] father and now he has a lovely bride
[39:06] that has come and joined with him and
[39:10] they together will be a blessing I know
[39:13] to multitudes. I pray that you'll bless
[39:16] their home. I ask that you'll bless
[39:18] their lives, oh God. I pray that you'll
[39:21] bless them with health and strength and
[39:24] good energy and keep the enemy far from
[39:27] their door. I pray let there be a wall
[39:30] of fire around them and may the Holy
[39:33] Spirit guide them. Speak to them, Lord.
[39:36] I pray you'll speak to them in such a
[39:38] way individually and as a couple. Speak
[39:41] to them, Lord. Cause their lives to be h
[39:44] to have an impact, an influence upon
[39:47] others. Oh God, how we need them, how we
[39:51] need them. May they be true soldiers of
[39:54] the cross of Jesus Christ. And I pray
[39:56] that Sister Yolena, oh God, will rise,
[40:00] oh father, and be one of the wi take her
[40:03] place with with the great women of the
[40:05] Bible. Oh God, great in dedication and
[40:09] consecration. And and we see these
[40:11] qualities in her. And I pray that you'll
[40:13] bless them now. Father, you'll guide
[40:16] their footsteps,
[40:18] provide for them. I know that you will.
[40:20] And we bless them now in the name of
[40:23] Jesus Christ.
[40:25] Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] God bless you, brother Ryan. Amen. You
[40:33] didn't expect that, did you? No. All
[40:35] right. Well, and you didn't expect it.
[40:39] God bless you.
[40:45] There are some things that are just
[40:47] appropriate and right and that that I I
[40:49] just couldn't see us go on in this
[40:51] service without having the recognizing
[40:55] brother Ryan, sister Elena.
[41:00] Amen.
[41:04] And in our services, I would like you to
[41:07] remember, please, if you would,
[41:09] uh, the worship part, even when we leave
[41:12] the sanctuary and go out in the foyer,
[41:15] the prophet says in our giving, in our
[41:18] tithes and our offerings, we're
[41:20] worshiping him. And so when you go to
[41:22] the tithes and offerings, I want you to
[41:24] think of it as an extension of really
[41:27] what we're doing right here. And that's
[41:29] what the messenger said. We worship God
[41:33] in tithes and offerings as well. And
[41:36] that's an important part of our of our
[41:39] worship to the Lord. And uh it's how we
[41:41] are able as a church to uh serve and do
[41:44] what we're supposed to do. So we thank
[41:47] you for that so much. All right. If
[41:51] you'd like to stand and
[41:54] I think that'll be all we'll need.
[41:56] Thanks.
[41:57] I'll have you turn to uh the book of
[42:01] Luke, the 24th chapter.
[42:06] This is a very familiar
[42:09] uh scripture reading, but I'd like to
[42:13] say there's nothing wrong with hearing
[42:15] it over and over, is there?
[42:17] &gt;&gt; How many times have you heard Coca-Cola
[42:19] advertised?
[42:21] And how many times have you heard them
[42:23] say the same thing?
[42:25] And uh sometimes I hear these ads and
[42:28] radio and I I think these people think
[42:31] that I'm stupid or something and I can't
[42:34] remember what they said, but they just
[42:36] keep repeating it.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; They repeat it because, you know, it's a
[42:40] it's proven to be successful. And the
[42:43] Apostle Peter said he was saying those
[42:46] things uh to put us in remembrance.
[42:49] And so often many times we hear
[42:52] something and we hear it when we hear it
[42:54] again and we hear it we hear it actually
[42:56] differently
[42:57] &gt;&gt; and God says something different to us
[42:59] about it. So uh it's to put you in
[43:02] remembrance also.
[43:04] This is the scripture uh brother
[43:07] Brandham read. We won't read all of it.
[43:10] Uh we're going to start at the 13th
[43:12] verse. But this is the uh text that
[43:16] brother Brandham took and used in modern
[43:20] events made clear by prophecy.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And which I have been so conscious of
[43:25] and want the church to be conscious of.
[43:28] When we read this, we're reading a
[43:30] prophecy that is being fulfilled with us
[43:34] in our time.
[43:39] Starting at the 13th verse. And behold,
[43:42] two of them went that same day to a
[43:44] village uh called Emmas, which was from
[43:48] Jerusalem about three score furongs. And
[43:51] they talked together of all these things
[43:53] which had happened. And it came to pass
[43:56] that while they communed together, and
[43:59] reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and
[44:03] went with them. But their eyes were
[44:06] holden that they should not know him.
[44:08] And he said unto them, "What manner of
[44:10] communication are these that you have
[44:13] one to another as you walk and are sad?"
[44:17] And one of them whose name was Cleopus
[44:20] answering, said unto him, "Art thou only
[44:23] a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
[44:26] known the things which are come to pass
[44:28] there in these days?" And he said unto
[44:31] them, "What things?" And they said unto
[44:34] him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which
[44:37] was a prophet mighty in deed and word
[44:40] before God and all the people, and how
[44:43] the chief priests and our rulers
[44:45] delivered him to be condemned to death,
[44:48] and have crucified him. But we trusted
[44:51] that it had been he which should have
[44:54] redeemed Israel. And beside all this,
[44:57] today is the third day since these
[45:00] things were done. Yay. And certain women
[45:03] also of our company uh made us
[45:06] astonished which were early at the
[45:09] sephiler. And when they found not his
[45:12] body, they came saying that they had
[45:15] seen also seen a vision of angels which
[45:19] uh said that he was alive. And certain
[45:23] of them which were with us went to the
[45:25] sephiler and found it even as the women
[45:28] had said, but him they saw not. Then he
[45:32] said unto them, "Oh fools and slow of
[45:36] heart to believe all that the prophets
[45:39] have spoken."
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Ought not Christ to have suffered these
[45:44] things and to enter into his glory? And
[45:47] beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
[45:50] he expounded unto them in all the
[45:53] scriptures the things concerning
[45:56] himself.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may he do so this morning.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; May he expound in all the scriptures the
[46:03] things concerning himself. We we'll uh
[46:06] bow our heads in prayer before we uh go
[46:10] further into the scriptures.
[46:12] Oh, how lovely you are, Lord Jesus. How
[46:16] wonderful what an atmosphere have been
[46:19] has been here in the service and the
[46:22] worship has been accepted. We we sense
[46:24] the spirit and the warmth of the
[46:27] nearness of your presence Lord and I
[46:30] pray that you'll bless this congregation
[46:32] of people that have come together and
[46:35] all who are connected with us at this
[46:37] time. I pray that you'll reach out, oh
[46:40] God, into the rooms and into the homes
[46:42] and into the places where people are
[46:45] meeting and especially here throughout
[46:47] this building, oh God, in the nursery or
[46:49] wherever the people are. May the
[46:52] presence of the Holy Spirit and not a
[46:55] different presence but the only presence
[46:57] the one who came on the day of Pentecost
[47:00] when that tree was planted that original
[47:03] tree what your prophet said was his tree
[47:05] your tree Lord I pray that it'll bear
[47:08] forth and bring forth much fruit in the
[47:11] name of Jesus Christ I surrender myself
[47:13] to you oh God that we just might be a
[47:16] tool in your hand and all the glory goes
[47:19] to you give us a grand time in your
[47:22] presence. I pray, Father, I pray there
[47:24] will be a yielding and a surrendering
[47:26] throughout the whole audience. Oh God,
[47:29] every man, woman, and child, Lord, that
[47:32] just might say, "Here I am, Lord. Take
[47:34] me." And may I be may I be pleasing in
[47:38] your sight today. We thank you for it in
[47:41] Jesus Christ's name.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[47:45] seats.
[47:50] I have been speaking on uh conditions
[47:53] for change
[47:55] and this subject of change is such a
[47:59] vast subject. It can come from so many
[48:02] different directions
[48:04] and I want to have you think of change
[48:08] but in a little different uh from a
[48:11] little different direction.
[48:15] So I want you to think about change that
[48:17] comes about through restoration.
[48:20] Restoration the power of restoration.
[48:25] You know, restoration is is something
[48:28] that you can sometimes there are people
[48:31] who are special specialists and they
[48:34] restore furniture and somebody else
[48:37] restores works of art and they take
[48:41] things that are uh they can't make them
[48:43] new, but they restore them and make them
[48:46] seek to bring them back near to the
[48:48] original.
[48:50] A true restoration is to restore
[48:53] something back or a person or a thing to
[48:56] restore it back to its original
[48:58] condition.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And only one can do that and that is one
[49:02] who made it original in the first place.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who can really restore
[49:06] a life, restore
[49:10] uh restore us the kind of restoration
[49:12] that we need. And furthermore,
[49:15] we weren't made. We were not made. It is
[49:18] not God's design that we should live
[49:22] just merely the life that we're living.
[49:24] That's not God's program. And so in the
[49:27] original plan, he's the one who has the
[49:30] original plan and we are we are to we
[49:34] are being restored or he has he has put
[49:36] forward a a uh I won't say a program but
[49:41] it is a
[49:43] it's an operation. It's called an
[49:45] operation of God in the scripture. It is
[49:48] a predestinated plan by which uh his
[49:52] children will come back to the very
[49:55] original
[49:57] uh plan and thought that he had for us
[49:59] in the beginning.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the act of restoring to
[50:05] its former place or its former
[50:09] condition.
[50:12] We're still in January here and winter
[50:14] is gripping most of the country yet and
[50:17] my message this morning is is very much
[50:20] towards uh Easter and yet I I couldn't
[50:24] get away from it. So I you know Easter
[50:26] doesn't have to be at a certain certain
[50:28] time as far as the ministry is
[50:29] concerned. Uh but Easter is a time of
[50:32] restoration.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; It is when uh the earth begins to take
[50:37] on a new look. Uh there's a fragrance
[50:41] from buds that are springing forth. Life
[50:45] is coming. Life that's been hidden down
[50:48] into the roots. Uh things and trees and
[50:51] bushes and whatever more that look so
[50:53] dead you'd even look at them and and and
[50:56] you know people who are in brother Don
[50:59] Alexander's business and brother Don he
[51:02] knows how to uh come and I've had him
[51:04] look at at trees for me and I said this
[51:07] thing looks dead. you know, and he'll
[51:09] scratch it or do something and say, "No,
[51:12] there's still some life there." Uh, and
[51:15] uh, you know, some of us look pretty
[51:18] dead.
[51:21] And we just had to have the right person
[51:23] give a touch
[51:25] &gt;&gt; and say, "No, there's still some life
[51:27] there.
[51:29] There's still some life there." Brother
[51:32] Brandham says that he wanted to ask he
[51:34] he did ask what intelligence is it that
[51:37] sends the sap
[51:39] &gt;&gt; and the life back down into the roots.
[51:43] What intelligence
[51:44] causes that tree? You know, it hasn't
[51:48] got any human intelligence, but the
[51:50] leaves drop off and the life runs back
[51:52] into the roots. And that's exactly
[51:54] that's why Jesus is called the root
[51:59] of he's a root. He's the branch and the
[52:02] root
[52:04] &gt;&gt; both because the life the the life was
[52:08] back into the roots. God held it back.
[52:12] But now in the scripture which we read
[52:14] this morning and this scripture has
[52:16] always had very very deep and special
[52:20] meaning to me and I trust that God will
[52:23] allow by the Holy Spirit today to give
[52:26] us a different kind of a service and let
[52:28] you enter in to even this short phrase.
[52:33] Jesus himself drew near.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; I think it's one of the most precious
[52:37] phrases in the Bible to me.
[52:42] when Jesus draws near. That's why I made
[52:44] the comment I did to brother Ryan,
[52:47] sister Yolena.
[52:50] Young people or individuals,
[52:54] we can just be, you know, roaring on our
[52:56] own direction. We got our own plans and
[52:59] we're going places and we're going to
[53:01] study and we're going to get certain uh,
[53:04] you know, uh uh uh uh certain program.
[53:08] we're going to we're going to do things
[53:10] and we're going to have a certain job.
[53:12] We're going to live in a certain city or
[53:14] we're going to live in a certain country
[53:16] and we've got things all mapped out and
[53:18] we got it all figured out. we're going
[53:20] to go a certain direction which may be
[53:22] perfectly fine and then one day we just
[53:25] become aware there's a different
[53:27] presence
[53:28] around us
[53:31] &gt;&gt; and when Jesus draws near
[53:34] we start to pray in the in the in the
[53:37] study this morning
[53:40] and Tom led in prayer and the first
[53:43] words out of his mouth he not knowing
[53:45] what I'm speaking on but he said he just
[53:48] opened his mouth mouth and said, "When
[53:50] Jesus comes,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; the tempter's power is broken."
[53:56] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, I can tell you when
[53:59] Jesus comes.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that he isn't here now, but
[54:03] when he comes in a a a greater
[54:06] intensity, when he comes near,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; you know, when he comes very near to
[54:10] you, and I pray that he'll come near to
[54:12] you today while we pro make progress
[54:16] through this message and have different
[54:18] scriptures and different quotes and
[54:20] things, that's all fine. But, you know,
[54:22] in me speaking, that's fine. And I might
[54:25] feel so inspired and I might feel so
[54:28] anointed, but it what's this service
[54:31] won't be what it's supposed to be unless
[54:33] the author
[54:35] &gt;&gt; unless this one who came near to these
[54:37] two men on the way to Emmas draw near to
[54:41] you where you are in your seat and you
[54:43] begin to feel his presence and in a
[54:45] different intensity and it begins to
[54:48] warm you and begins to break you and and
[54:50] sometimes there's tears and sometimes
[54:53] there's revelation. And sometimes
[54:55] there's the word just becomes a a new
[54:58] book or a or even just a scripture or
[55:00] maybe this phrase and Jesus himself drew
[55:03] near. There might be something in your
[55:05] heart right now saying that's what I
[55:07] need.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm looking for the same one that
[55:12] came and been in the message of
[55:15] restoration of the bride tree and how
[55:17] the prophet of God speaks of God
[55:20] planting. He said he planted his tree on
[55:23] the day of Pentecost and bringing forth
[55:26] the fruits of that tree, that Holy Ghost
[55:29] tree, and and restoration is to go back
[55:32] to the original. I have a longing in my
[55:35] heart
[55:36] &gt;&gt; for what God planted on the day of
[55:38] Pentecost.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I have a desire for that. God never
[55:42] changes his plan or or his program. And
[55:45] I realize that we're not, you know,
[55:47] we're not here just desiring a lot of,
[55:50] you know, signs and and and and those
[55:52] kind of things. But on the other hand, I
[55:55] would like everything that God wants to
[55:56] bring.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; When they're sick amongst us, I'd like
[56:02] to see them healed.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we expect that?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why should the devil trample over
[56:14] our faith?
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Trample over our confession.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; When we have a need in our family or a
[56:21] need in our home or a need in our lives,
[56:24] why shouldn't we expect God to step on
[56:27] the scene? That's what was planted on
[56:29] the day of Pentecost. And that's what
[56:32] we're to expect today. Why live below
[56:34] our standards?
[56:36] [Music]
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] Whenever he came near something
[56:42] different happened.
[56:44] We have Jesus in his first coming and
[56:49] then he died and was gone and then he
[56:53] returned in the resurrection
[56:56] and then he left and ascended
[56:59] and then he promised in the end time and
[57:02] even this scripture today is a prophecy.
[57:05] He promised in the end time he'd descend
[57:07] again.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And we wouldn't even have known unless a
[57:11] prophet said, "This is his word coming."
[57:15] &gt;&gt; His word coming.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; He drew near, friends.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; And I I trust that I will be able to
[57:21] convey to you.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; In the breach, I'm just setting uh
[57:27] setting a little bit of a a direction
[57:29] now. And when the seals are broke, he
[57:32] said, "The mystery is revealed. Down
[57:35] comes the angel, the messenger, Christ,
[57:39] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[57:41] the sea with a rainbow over his head."
[57:44] Rainbow because he's a covenant angel.
[57:46] In other words, the word is returning.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And the covenant, the rainbow over his
[57:51] head. And he said, "Now remember this
[57:55] seventh angel is on the earth at the
[57:58] time of this coming."
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I will say this, however a person wants
[58:03] to interpret that, I will say this.
[58:05] Jesus Christ has drew near in this
[58:08] generation.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; He's drawn very very near in this
[58:14] generation. And he can I can tell you
[58:16] that he can draw near and people can
[58:18] miss him. He can be near and you might
[58:21] not even be aware of it. There there
[58:23] also is an essential part which I wish
[58:26] to touch on later on and that is that uh
[58:29] with with God there needs to be a
[58:33] recognition on be on the be on the part
[58:36] of the people. That is why brother
[58:38] Brandham preached the unrecognized
[58:40] presence of God because the presence was
[58:43] there. Can you imagine Elijah was there?
[58:47] The presence was there. The pillar of
[58:49] fire was there. He was seeing it over
[58:51] the people. And many of the people
[58:53] failed to recognize, even failed to
[58:56] acknowledge, failed to be willing to
[58:59] believe it was there. They could have
[59:02] benefited from it, but they chose to
[59:04] disbelieve it or to doubt it or to
[59:07] criticize it or to find some reason why
[59:10] they wouldn't enter into it. But for my
[59:12] part, and your part this morning, we
[59:14] need to determine I want to enter into
[59:16] all of it.
[59:18] I want to receive everything that I can
[59:22] &gt;&gt; from that presence.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; I want to recognize it. Clear my vision.
[59:27] Lord, don't let me don't let me have
[59:29] scales over my eyes. Let me see you here
[59:32] this morning today.
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Let this not be just another Sunday
[59:38] morning service.
[59:41] Yeah.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; He said in his wonders to perform.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Notice his wonders to perform.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; He said you go to singing hymns. Brother
[59:52] Derek, thank you. We've sung hymns this
[59:55] morning.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; You start reading the Bible.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; We did.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And he says that stranger
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; will appear.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:09] I want to say, Lord Jesus, that's why we
[1:00:12] sang hymns this morning.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that's why I read the
[1:00:16] scripture this morning and we read about
[1:00:19] you coming near to two men and here are
[1:00:22] men and here are women and here our
[1:00:24] children. May that same Lord Jesus come
[1:00:27] near to you.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for it? Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; he said, "And while those went on the
[1:00:37] way to Emmas along the road, begin to
[1:00:40] talk about him
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; that he stepped out of the bushes and
[1:00:44] walked with them through the day." He
[1:00:47] said the reason we don't have the
[1:00:49] spiritual blessings he said we have too
[1:00:51] much time said to watch television too
[1:00:54] much time to read the newspapers or
[1:00:56] listen to some things that we ought not
[1:00:59] to be listening to and we do and he says
[1:01:02] we are not redeeming the time but we're
[1:01:04] giving it to other things of the world
[1:01:06] instead of our time to the Lord Jesus.
[1:01:09] He said Christians live on the word.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; May this congregation live on the word.
[1:01:16] Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I wasn't able to come to be at the uh
[1:01:19] Friday night prayer service and I
[1:01:21] understand the young people came and
[1:01:23] joined and and we've there's there's a
[1:01:26] desire within the people and I believe
[1:01:30] that uh I believe that God has us on a
[1:01:32] on a a different direction and is
[1:01:36] increasing intensifying.
[1:01:38] It doesn't mean that everybody has to
[1:01:40] be, but it's wonderful when you can get
[1:01:42] a a large group of people together and
[1:01:45] especially introduce the young people
[1:01:48] into prayer and so they can hear uh
[1:01:52] people praying.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; I like to hear people praying. I like to
[1:01:57] hear young people praying. And we were
[1:02:01] we were affected as we heard a couple
[1:02:03] weeks ago and there wasn't that many
[1:02:06] maybe 40 50 people there but we heard
[1:02:08] some of our young men praying and uh not
[1:02:12] only young men but sisters as well but
[1:02:15] we were impressed by some of them that
[1:02:18] were opening their heart.
[1:02:21] Now this uh the scripture which we read
[1:02:24] it's an amazing account in the scripture
[1:02:28] because there's no event in the
[1:02:30] scripture.
[1:02:32] There's no event in the scripture that
[1:02:35] records
[1:02:37] uh the event as this one is. This is
[1:02:42] very unique
[1:02:44] and I I want to I want to really take
[1:02:47] some time with it. There's nothing
[1:02:49] that's even similar.
[1:02:51] Brother Brandham calls this of the re of
[1:02:54] the resurrection and the crucifixion.
[1:02:57] This is the greatest week. I'm saying
[1:02:58] these things for a very specific
[1:03:00] purpose. The greatest week in all
[1:03:04] history. So would you acknowledge that
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; this is the greatest week in all
[1:03:10] history.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; It was the very moment of the unfolding
[1:03:15] of the resurrection. And the
[1:03:17] resurrection wasn't known yet. It had
[1:03:20] happened, but it wasn't known yet. This
[1:03:23] was just the first first little uh ray
[1:03:27] of light that was coming into the minds
[1:03:30] of the people. They were still
[1:03:30] bewildered, but a resurrection had taken
[1:03:33] place and they were not aware of it. Uh
[1:03:37] women that were from the church, from
[1:03:40] their company, had been to the tomb to
[1:03:43] the sephiler and he wasn't there. They
[1:03:45] couldn't find the body and they were
[1:03:48] concerned about that and they'd seen a
[1:03:49] strange vision as it were. But the
[1:03:52] resurrection had taken place and yet
[1:03:55] this is the paradox. It was one of the
[1:03:57] saddest times
[1:04:00] for the believers.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; One of the saddest,
[1:04:07] most confusing
[1:04:09] and distressing time for the believers.
[1:04:13] And yet in another realm it was the
[1:04:16] greatest week in all history.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; I say that because we need to be aware
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; that God is not being controlled or
[1:04:29] governed by what you and I see happening
[1:04:33] on a a dayto-day basis in our daytoday
[1:04:36] life. Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God declares declares
[1:04:41] that everything is moving right
[1:04:43] according to the plan.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And I believe that
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; everything is moving absolutely
[1:04:50] according to the program of God. And
[1:04:53] it's not out of cater one bit.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; What about this or what about that or
[1:05:00] what about something else? There are all
[1:05:03] kinds of things and always will be
[1:05:04] things that we don't understand. Things
[1:05:07] will happen to us individually and
[1:05:09] happen you know in our home or whatever
[1:05:11] more but we don't understand it. In the
[1:05:14] rising of the sun he said this is the
[1:05:16] greatest week in history. The greatest
[1:05:19] celebration of all times the Easter this
[1:05:23] Easter is where he proved what he said.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. the evidence of the
[1:05:31] resurrection
[1:05:33] stepped out of the bushes
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; and started walking with these two
[1:05:38] believers.
[1:05:40] Could be two believers that are sitting
[1:05:42] here.
[1:05:44] I want you to think now of the blending
[1:05:48] of two worlds
[1:05:52] in this world that they were in. In this
[1:05:55] world
[1:05:57] of circumstance,
[1:06:01] they were consumed
[1:06:03] with the recent events that had taken
[1:06:06] place and incidentally were in complete
[1:06:09] reversal of what they had planned and
[1:06:12] what they had expected. So in this world
[1:06:16] which is a world of circumstance in this
[1:06:19] world their eyes were holden. In this
[1:06:22] world, they could not see uh the things
[1:06:25] as they actually were.
[1:06:28] In this world, they were unable to see
[1:06:31] that scripture was actually being
[1:06:34] fulfilled. They couldn't see it. There
[1:06:36] was nothing to comfort them.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; There was nothing to comfort them.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; It was all distress. It was all a
[1:06:44] terrible tearing.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; You're quiet. Preach it. Preach it.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; This is a reality.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; This isn't a story. This isn't
[1:06:54] mythology. This is what happened to two
[1:06:57] believers just like you and I. And not
[1:07:00] two believers. It happened to the women.
[1:07:02] It happened. They went with the spices
[1:07:04] to anoint the body. And the body's not
[1:07:06] there. It's not what they figured out.
[1:07:09] It's not what they had expected. It had
[1:07:12] It had been very, very different. In
[1:07:14] this world, they were reasoning. In this
[1:07:17] world they were reasoning but gaining no
[1:07:19] understanding.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; In this world they had a lot of
[1:07:23] questions but there was no answers. In
[1:07:26] this world
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; in this world their hopes and their
[1:07:30] expectations had been dashed
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; for they said we have trusted
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; that it had been he which should have
[1:07:42] redeemed Israel.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; We trusted that it would be he. This was
[1:07:47] the one we had trusted that would
[1:07:49] redeem. Now, and the word redeem, and
[1:07:51] brother Brandon goes into it, and
[1:07:52] perhaps I can touch on it a little bit
[1:07:54] further later on, but to redeem is a
[1:07:57] powerful powerful word. Brother Brandham
[1:07:59] takes it, he said it's to loose.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; They're loosed completely.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; No one has any power over that. When he
[1:08:07] says to redeem, and he would redeem a
[1:08:09] nation or redeem a person, and when
[1:08:12] you're restored, he can't restore you
[1:08:14] unless he redeems you. And he took you,
[1:08:17] the prophet said, he takes you away from
[1:08:19] Satan
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; the same. And he's taking the world away
[1:08:23] from Satan the way he took you away from
[1:08:25] Satan.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing this morning that God has
[1:08:30] taken you and I away from Satan.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He took us away from Satan. And we can
[1:08:37] sing and say, "I am redeemed.
[1:08:41] I am loosed.
[1:08:43] I have been taken away from Satan.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Of course you do. Confess it.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Speak it right in the face of the enemy.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, you thought you had a You
[1:08:57] thought you had a hold of me. I've been
[1:09:00] taken away from you.
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; I've been loosed.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; I've been liberated. Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; The ransom has been paid.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; The bonds. And how we love that song,
[1:09:22] worthy, worthy, because it speaks to
[1:09:24] this truth.
[1:09:27] We've been loosed. And Cleopus and his
[1:09:30] friend, Cleopus and his friend were
[1:09:33] actually peering into another world. the
[1:09:36] blending of the worlds. They were
[1:09:38] peering into another world
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and they didn't know it.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I'm I felt compelled to tell this
[1:09:48] congregation, not knowing who would be
[1:09:49] here this morning, the events in 24 of
[1:09:54] Luke are brought we are brought face to
[1:09:57] face with those same events through the
[1:10:01] ministry of God's prophet in this
[1:10:03] generation.
[1:10:04] We are we have been allowed to peer into
[1:10:08] another world.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And just because you don't see it
[1:10:12] doesn't mean it's not happening.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize it. You may not
[1:10:17] realize it, but listen to this little
[1:10:19] preacher this morning. It's still the
[1:10:22] truth.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Another world is very near.
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:32] They were living out a prophecy that
[1:10:34] they didn't even realize it. They didn't
[1:10:36] realize it. They're just walking down a
[1:10:38] road, their feet becoming dusty. Their
[1:10:41] the their hearts are heavy. The the end
[1:10:44] of the world has come. Their master's
[1:10:47] been taken. The secretary of the church
[1:10:49] has committed suicide. And they're all
[1:10:52] scattered. and the great people of the
[1:10:54] assembly and the leaders and the elders
[1:10:56] and the deacons and the trustees or
[1:10:58] whatever more are all locked up. The
[1:11:00] apostles are locked up and behind barred
[1:11:03] windows and doors for fear of perhaps
[1:11:05] the Romans or whatever is happen.
[1:11:07] Everything's collapsed.
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; There was no hope anywhere.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; And there was even nothing in their
[1:11:17] expectation of it maybe get better
[1:11:19] tomorrow.
[1:11:21] Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; But here they are, believers peering and
[1:11:26] looking in to another dimension into
[1:11:29] another world. And they didn't even
[1:11:31] realize it. And that is our portion.
[1:11:35] That's your portion. That's what this
[1:11:38] message, this message isn't come from
[1:11:40] the earth. This message didn't come from
[1:11:42] a Bible school. This message came from
[1:11:45] eternity.
[1:11:49] And when you read it, you peer into
[1:11:51] another dimension. You peer into another
[1:11:54] world. You peer into eternity.
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] The scripture even tells us of the
[1:12:11] prophets and the seers of old
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; searching what or what manner of time
[1:12:16] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[1:12:17] did signify something that was in them
[1:12:19] was telling them this is for another
[1:12:21] time but this is such a
[1:12:24] oh God show me what this is all about
[1:12:27] and it and it and they wanting to know
[1:12:28] what the scripture signified when it
[1:12:31] testified beforehand and they spoke of
[1:12:33] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[1:12:36] that should follow unto whom it was
[1:12:38] revealed. He said unto whom it was
[1:12:41] revealed that not unto themselves. And I
[1:12:44] say about these men, Cleopus and his
[1:12:46] friend, it was not even their life. And
[1:12:48] what's recorded here was not unto
[1:12:50] themselves, but unto us, but unto us
[1:12:55] they did minister.
[1:12:58] I'm preaching this this morning because
[1:12:59] to tell you Cleopus and his friend and
[1:13:03] the prophet of God comes down in one of
[1:13:05] his last services that he preaches is
[1:13:07] that the modern events are made clear by
[1:13:11] this prophecy. Now we need to look at
[1:13:14] this prophecy and understand our events
[1:13:17] today.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Understand our life. Understand the
[1:13:22] environment and the circumstances that
[1:13:25] are taking place in our world. and be
[1:13:27] able to say wholeheartedly,
[1:13:30] they did minister to us.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And now I need to see what they
[1:13:35] ministered.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; They were looking
[1:13:44] at the first fruits
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. Amen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; They were actually looking at the first
[1:13:55] fruits,
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; but it was just a man
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; and he spoke and we understood them.
[1:14:02] There's nothing nothing spooky about
[1:14:05] this.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; It was just a man
[1:14:08] and they were looking at the first
[1:14:09] fruits of the resurrection.
[1:14:13] There had been others that had been
[1:14:15] raised from the dead, but this was
[1:14:16] different. Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And brother Vandom describes why it's
[1:14:19] different because he said there's been
[1:14:21] many babies born
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; with a great, you know, that that were
[1:14:26] wonderful people. And there's been many
[1:14:28] men that have lived for a great cause.
[1:14:31] But Jesus Christ, there was no man that
[1:14:33] died like he died. And no man, there had
[1:14:36] been people been raised from the dead,
[1:14:38] but this one raised himself from the
[1:14:40] dead.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Never a man raised himself
[1:14:44] up." Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Cleopus was looking at the proof
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; from almighty God.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; He was looking at eternal life.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; He was looking at the first fruits. He
[1:14:55] was looking at a man who raised himself
[1:14:58] from the dead.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; He was looking at the proof of all
[1:15:02] humanity.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; He was looking at the proof that he
[1:15:06] could lay down for you and I.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; He looked at a man who raised himself
[1:15:11] from the dead.
[1:15:16] And the prophet of God in this end time
[1:15:18] had to go and lay hold of that scripture
[1:15:21] and bring it forward to show us in a
[1:15:23] restoration of the bride tree be because
[1:15:27] here was now a power. This was a
[1:15:29] different kind of a power. He could
[1:15:31] enforce it
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; and show us that we can enforce it. We
[1:15:36] have the right. We have the authority to
[1:15:39] enforce the law of God upon Satan's
[1:15:43] head.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Please receive this.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; They were in this world, but they were
[1:15:53] looking at not merely the evidence of
[1:15:56] the resurrection and the first fruits.
[1:16:00] They were looking at
[1:16:02] the very one who had crushed the head of
[1:16:06] Satan.
[1:16:10] He had already raised also in another
[1:16:13] realm. They were looking into another
[1:16:14] realm, peering into another realm. And
[1:16:17] the prophet of God has said, the
[1:16:19] scripture tells us, he rose with the
[1:16:22] keys of death, hell, and the grave.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; They were looking at the most momentous
[1:16:29] sight they could have ever have seen.
[1:16:32] Here was the one who had the keys of
[1:16:34] death, hell, and the grave.
[1:16:36] [Applause]
[1:16:38] Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; But they're just like us here on January
[1:16:43] the 31st,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; 2010.
[1:16:48] They didn't know it.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you as believers,
[1:16:54] we don't know what we have.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; We don't fully know what we have. We may
[1:16:59] appreciate it with everything that's in
[1:17:01] us, but you are literally walking with
[1:17:04] eternal life. if you have eternal life,
[1:17:06] but you're walking you're walking and
[1:17:08] peering into another dimension because
[1:17:11] there's no no people on the face of the
[1:17:13] earth that has the message that you
[1:17:15] have.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; My wife has said to me, you've been on a
[1:17:19] certain direction. It seems that you're
[1:17:21] speaking about this channel, this you
[1:17:23] know how the prophet is a certain
[1:17:24] channel. I cannot emphasize it enough.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That's the orphice through which we can
[1:17:29] peer right into eternity.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the authorative
[1:17:34] voice that tells me what kind of a body
[1:17:36] I'm going to have.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; This is the authorative voice that tells
[1:17:40] me what kind of a home I'm going to live
[1:17:41] in.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; And it's time for us not just to hear it
[1:17:48] in a Sunday morning service, but to go
[1:17:51] out these doors and say, "I confess this
[1:17:53] every minute of the day. I believe it.
[1:17:55] I'm going to hold this up in the face of
[1:17:57] Satan.
[1:18:00] I'm going to hold this up in the face of
[1:18:01] an unbelieving
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; world.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's been many fine babies
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; born and there's been many fine men
[1:18:18] who've suffered and died for a real
[1:18:20] cause,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; but there's never was one
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; that could raise himself up until this
[1:18:27] day. Until that day,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; they were peering.
[1:18:37] They didn't realize it.
[1:18:40] They couldn't possibly realize it.
[1:18:43] They were born in sin shaped in
[1:18:45] iniquities like all other men. These two
[1:18:47] men like believers that we are. And they
[1:18:51] were looking at the absolute
[1:18:53] justification of their soul. Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; They were looking at at the justice of
[1:19:01] God having been paid.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; They were looking at at that which God
[1:19:06] looked on and was satisfied.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Think of it. They were looking on the
[1:19:13] fulfillment when God spoke to Adam and
[1:19:16] Eve and said, "In the day thou eatest
[1:19:18] thereof, thou shalt surely die."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Here they were looking. They were they
[1:19:23] were the first ones able to walk with
[1:19:25] the one who actually satisfied that
[1:19:27] statement
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ had died
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; to satisfy that command
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; the day thou eatest there thou shalt
[1:19:41] surely die. And he took the death
[1:19:44] penalty
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; for us
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; for them. They didn't realize the death
[1:19:51] penalty had been paid on their behalf.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; To them, it was a cross. To them, it was
[1:19:56] a cruel crucifixion. To them, it was a
[1:19:59] tomb. To them, it was a body. To them,
[1:20:02] it was a bewilderment. Where is he?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; They were so connected to the material
[1:20:08] world that they couldn't they they were
[1:20:10] unable. And that's why Jesus took them
[1:20:12] all through the scriptures to speak of
[1:20:15] the things concerning himself.
[1:20:18] Hallelujah.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; I will say one thing. The message has
[1:20:22] come in this day to connect us to
[1:20:25] connect you
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; with eternity.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; The message has come to answer your
[1:20:30] questions.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe not about all the material things
[1:20:33] that happen here, but the message has
[1:20:36] come to connect you with eternal things.
[1:20:42] God help us
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; in another world.
[1:20:48] I have just written down they were
[1:20:50] walking with
[1:20:52] this greatest victory of the ages.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. They didn't realize
[1:20:58] it. You and I are sitting here today
[1:21:03] and if I said to you, we have the
[1:21:05] greatest message on earth.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, you know, is that
[1:21:10] supposed to make me happy or what am I
[1:21:12] supposed to do? Am I supposed to get up
[1:21:14] and jump? Am I supposed to, you know,
[1:21:17] shout because brother Brandham has
[1:21:20] brother Ed is saying this that Brother
[1:21:22] Brandham has, you know, brought this
[1:21:24] message and all these things and the
[1:21:26] seals are open and so and so. What does
[1:21:28] that mean? I don't even know
[1:21:35] how how close are you? I'm I'm going to
[1:21:36] be speaking some things that are really
[1:21:38] strange.
[1:21:42] How close do you think you might be to
[1:21:44] the seven angels that actually spoke to
[1:21:47] brother Brandham about the seals?
[1:21:52] So, why are you saying that? Well,
[1:21:57] the people up in the Baptist church,
[1:21:59] they don't care anything about the
[1:22:00] seals.
[1:22:03] They don't care anything about a
[1:22:05] mysterious cloud. That doesn't mean
[1:22:08] anything to them.
[1:22:10] And then you find a group of people
[1:22:15] and there different degrees. Some don't
[1:22:18] have much interest in it, but there's
[1:22:20] others that even read it and reread it
[1:22:25] and stay with it and they read the
[1:22:28] scriptures and they don't understand it.
[1:22:32] But you keep doing that
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; and he
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; will draw near.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; He will come close to you and it won't
[1:22:41] be flashes of lightning and thunder and
[1:22:43] all kinds of great sudden things and
[1:22:45] suddenly, oh, I know and I see it now.
[1:22:47] No, it doesn't happen that way. They
[1:22:49] just walked along in their daily life
[1:22:51] and kept doing what they always do.
[1:22:54] Walking where they were going, going to
[1:22:55] their home, coming to their house,
[1:22:58] asking the stranger to come in. And
[1:23:00] little by little by little it just uh
[1:23:02] you know it dawned and the light begin
[1:23:05] to shine and they begin to see and and
[1:23:08] hear the stranger now is starting to
[1:23:09] speak about Moses and about Christ and
[1:23:12] the prophets and about Christ in in the
[1:23:15] Psalms and David and they're they're
[1:23:17] being uh you know their hearts are
[1:23:20] burning now.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Their mind is not registering anything
[1:23:23] but their hearts are burning
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; within them.
[1:23:27] And I pray that this morning there'll be
[1:23:30] something that will be so said and
[1:23:32] punctuated by the Holy Ghost that you'll
[1:23:35] say, "There's more to this message than
[1:23:37] I have seen. There's more to what's
[1:23:39] happening than I understand. Oh God,
[1:23:42] here I am.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; I open up my heart to you. I open up my
[1:23:47] whole being to you. I want to live for
[1:23:49] your cause and live for your purpose.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Show me what I need to see. Yes.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about getting too spiritual.
[1:23:58] You won't.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; They were looking directly at the proof.
[1:24:08] And the prophet said in super sign, he
[1:24:10] conquered death, hell, and the grave and
[1:24:14] possessed its gates. Rose on the third
[1:24:16] day in a supernatural resurrection.
[1:24:19] Said, "I have the keys of death, hell of
[1:24:21] the keys of death, and hell." Amen. I
[1:24:24] was he who was once dead and now am
[1:24:26] alive forever more. And because I live,
[1:24:28] the seed of Abraham shall live also.
[1:24:31] That's what had happened. And they were
[1:24:32] walking with that.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; What are we walking with?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I personally believe that the angels who
[1:24:40] even brought the the the the message of
[1:24:43] the seals to the prophet,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I cannot feature that they have ever
[1:24:47] left.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; The message
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; very far.
[1:24:54] sir.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; They've never left it very far.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; I believe those angels are near.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] Now
[1:25:14] I want to just add another uh another
[1:25:17] aspect here to this now
[1:25:21] and to I I hope that you will believe me
[1:25:24] and I trust that I will be able to
[1:25:26] emphasize to the point that you'll lay
[1:25:29] hold of it things that you've heard. I'm
[1:25:32] not wanting you just to remember them. I
[1:25:35] want you to take it and that your life
[1:25:37] will be changed by it because uh there
[1:25:40] are things that are said, things that
[1:25:43] have been spoken, the message that have
[1:25:45] been said. Quite frankly, friends, I
[1:25:47] don't believe that it has enough place
[1:25:49] in our homes and in our lives and in our
[1:25:52] time. We need to give more time to the
[1:25:54] word.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Say amen to that. Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture tells us
[1:26:05] that the that there's a law of life and
[1:26:08] brother Brandham uses this. I want to I
[1:26:11] want you to absorb the words. There is a
[1:26:13] law. There's a law outside just outside
[1:26:16] the building that's a speed limit.
[1:26:19] And that is a law.
[1:26:22] And we have all kinds of laws and
[1:26:23] regulations. Those of you who have Nexus
[1:26:27] cards to go across the border, there's
[1:26:29] more regulations to that. It almost
[1:26:31] scares me. I'm wondering if I got an old
[1:26:34] piece of fruit or something in the car.
[1:26:36] I I know that there's nothing in the
[1:26:38] trunk, but I go and look anyway, just in
[1:26:41] case I happen to forget something cuz I
[1:26:43] don't want them to uh strip me of my
[1:26:46] Nexus car. That's Oh, I just love
[1:26:49] passing all those cars that have to wait
[1:26:51] in the in the lineup. But we all have
[1:26:54] laws. There are laws. And there's laws
[1:26:57] in the land. There's laws, you know, in
[1:26:59] the government. And you may not
[1:27:03] have thought about this this morning
[1:27:05] till now. But there's a law in you.
[1:27:11] God has put a law. Not a law of just
[1:27:15] healing. There is a law of healing in
[1:27:17] your body. But he put a law in you. And
[1:27:20] it's called the law of life. Yes,
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; It's the law of life in the word that
[1:27:29] God has sent us. There that word and we
[1:27:34] call the message. Let me say to you
[1:27:37] according to the word of God. This is
[1:27:39] thus sayaeth the Lord. There's a law in
[1:27:43] that word.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] There are some conditions and one of the
[1:27:50] conditions is you have to recognize it.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That is the one thing you have to
[1:27:56] recognize it. You have to acknowledge it
[1:27:59] and that is that is the one thing the
[1:28:01] plant the plant that is uh you know uh
[1:28:05] in the ground and the pulp has run out.
[1:28:08] There is a law of life in that seed life
[1:28:12] in that botney life and uh when the sun
[1:28:15] draws near
[1:28:18] that life starts to come up.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; In other words, the sun the su n draws
[1:28:24] the life right out of the seed. Now the
[1:28:29] prophet's message, brother Brandham's
[1:28:31] coming was for this purpose that the son
[1:28:35] of manl
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; would be revealed again.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He'd be made known again.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; He would, in other words, I want to in
[1:28:44] the context of the service this morning
[1:28:47] that he would draw near to the people.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That the son of man, Jesus Christ, would
[1:28:52] be would draw near to the people. And
[1:28:55] this is his channel.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; This is the chosen vessel
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; that he chose to come near to the
[1:29:04] people.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; There was a time when the people saw the
[1:29:09] lightning and the thunder and the
[1:29:10] burning of the fire on the mountain. And
[1:29:13] the people said at that time, don't let
[1:29:17] God speak to us directly.
[1:29:20] They said to Moses, "You go up
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; and come down and tell us what he said."
[1:29:25] That was the first instance. There's no
[1:29:27] prophet prior to that.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; That Abraham was God's prophet, but I'm
[1:29:32] talking about a prophet to the people.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And so through Moses, God drew near to
[1:29:38] the people.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Through Moses, God came close to them.
[1:29:43] Through Moses, they were ransomed.
[1:29:46] Through Moses, they were redeemed.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Through Moses, they were loosed
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; from Egypt's bondage. Can you say
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Through Moses.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; God used that vessel
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; to come near to the people.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And that's why the scripture tells us
[1:30:09] this is such a remarkable ministry that
[1:30:12] we've been called to the Holy Spirit
[1:30:14] confirming the word in our time. Such a
[1:30:17] remarkable ministry that God has called
[1:30:19] us. He's called us. He's if I could put
[1:30:22] it in this language. He said th this is
[1:30:25] the this is the revealing of my son.
[1:30:27] This the revealing of the son. I've
[1:30:29] called you under that revealing to make
[1:30:31] that known. And do we realize that's the
[1:30:35] whole thing. Do we realize
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; what has actually taken place?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Say, well, I know it mentally, but I
[1:30:42] want to that we should that we should
[1:30:45] experience it
[1:30:48] in reality.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; There was a law in Cleopus and his
[1:30:53] friend and this was the law
[1:30:58] that they would recognize him.
[1:31:01] They didn't know that. But there was a
[1:31:03] law in them saying
[1:31:07] even beyond their own understanding, the
[1:31:09] law was saying,
[1:31:11] if I can put it in my words, you are
[1:31:14] going to recognize him.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; You are going to understand what this
[1:31:21] experience is all about.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; It's like the law that's in the seed of
[1:31:27] the little flower. The law is saying you
[1:31:31] are going to respond to this sun.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; You are going to come up under all of
[1:31:37] this dirt and mud.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; You are going to have a flower.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; There's a law in you and you are going
[1:31:44] to smell pretty.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to give off a fragrance.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And there's a law. It's not just in this
[1:31:58] old flesh or this old shell, but there's
[1:32:00] a law in you saying you're going to
[1:32:02] shine
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; with the glory of God.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; There's a law in you say you will
[1:32:09] understand this word because you are
[1:32:12] ordained to understand it.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; You've been made to understand it.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; You've been made for this word. You're
[1:32:20] fit together as husband and wife.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; His bridegroom your bride.
[1:32:25] That's the law.
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And I the sun drawing near to them
[1:32:37] would make effect of the law that was
[1:32:39] already in them.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; We today have a law of life in us.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the promised word for this
[1:32:52] day.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the nearing or shall we say
[1:32:56] the returning of the sun. The nearing of
[1:32:59] the sun. Don't doubt that part. There's
[1:33:02] many in the message that's not a big
[1:33:04] thing with them. They don't understand
[1:33:06] and they perhaps can't catch the
[1:33:09] significance or the importance or why
[1:33:14] brother talked about the people in
[1:33:16] denominational world. He says they don't
[1:33:18] understand the great this great joy that
[1:33:20] we have
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; cuz the joy that we were experiencing
[1:33:24] made others angry.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; So the very joy that we have upsets
[1:33:30] people, distresses people. The very joy
[1:33:33] that you have, the things that have
[1:33:35] caused you to see such glorious things,
[1:33:38] such lovely things, and cause you to
[1:33:41] love the Lord Jesus more. Others say
[1:33:43] you're in a cult. Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, any cult that can
[1:33:47] make you love the Lord Jesus more,
[1:33:49] that's a cult you want to be in.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; So, the sun was drawing near and it
[1:34:03] forces Satan, the author of death, to
[1:34:06] lose his hold and loose those that he
[1:34:09] has held. And a prophet keeps using this
[1:34:12] phrase and I'm going to keep coming back
[1:34:14] to it regardless of the conditions.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; So you see friends, we could sit down
[1:34:22] and tell everybody and and share with
[1:34:24] each other our tale of woes, but all I
[1:34:26] can do is say to you this morning, say
[1:34:29] what he said. He said say what the t
[1:34:32] say. Say what the message says. And the
[1:34:35] message says regardless of the
[1:34:38] conditions. regardless of the
[1:34:40] conditions. Over and over and over
[1:34:42] again, he said the same thing in
[1:34:44] restoration of the bride tree. How can
[1:34:46] there be a restoration if all the
[1:34:48] conditions are going to affect it?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; The restoration takes place regardless
[1:34:54] of the condition.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You need to say that regardless of the
[1:34:59] condition.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good news?
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:17] Maybe if you feel like you're in an
[1:35:18] impossible situation,
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; I could just have you raise your hand
[1:35:21] and we'll all pray for you
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; and I could raise my hands too and you
[1:35:26] can pray for me.
[1:35:28] But I have a word. I have a promise. And
[1:35:30] not only a promise in a book, not only a
[1:35:33] promise spoken by a messenger, but I
[1:35:36] have the law in me.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; I have the law in me
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; according to the scripture which says
[1:35:43] that the law of life in Christ, we have
[1:35:45] that in us.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And the nearing of the sun, the nearing
[1:35:54] of the sun activates that law.
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:00] The seed, the seed when it dropped off
[1:36:02] the flower that was dying in the fall,
[1:36:04] that seed had the life in it then.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And when it was covered over by all the
[1:36:10] doctrine and denominational everything
[1:36:13] else and was cold and frozen in the
[1:36:15] ground, this the that law was in it yet
[1:36:18] then. Yeah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And then the and then the cold winter
[1:36:22] split the seed open and it was just a
[1:36:26] empty shell and the pulp the pulp that
[1:36:29] was inside still ran into the ground and
[1:36:32] the law was still in there.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; There's nothing there's nothing that can
[1:36:38] destroy God's law of life.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] You believe it?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching for you?
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Surely not preaching just for myself.
[1:36:56] I'm preaching for you.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; This is a reality to me.
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:04] [Music]
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just let's just look at the
[1:37:11] conditions that these believers had that
[1:37:14] these believers have.
[1:37:19] We have in inferiority complexes.
[1:37:28] There are those who are troubled with
[1:37:33] a low esteem of self-esteem.
[1:37:36] They don't
[1:37:38] feel like they're worth anything.
[1:37:41] Satan loves you to think about that.
[1:37:46] He loves you to think about that and he
[1:37:48] keeps stoking that fire
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; when you get pondering and thinking
[1:37:54] about that
[1:37:55] and and and
[1:37:57] conditioning your life or maneuvering
[1:37:59] your life to accommodate that low esteem
[1:38:03] or this complex
[1:38:06] some complex you have
[1:38:09] say well I have some complex because of
[1:38:12] my childhood or the way I was raised up
[1:38:13] or the
[1:38:15] God is greater than your complex.
[1:38:19] [Applause]
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; The government and the school and
[1:38:27] educators and nothing nothing against
[1:38:29] our educators. We got some of the most
[1:38:30] wonderful ones in our school. I'm not
[1:38:33] opposed to that at all. Like I had I've
[1:38:37] had people come to me and say, "Can a
[1:38:39] Christian psychologist help me?"
[1:38:43] Well, they can help a lot of people.
[1:38:49] I don't think that they can really help
[1:38:52] a believer
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; that's walking in the fullness of the
[1:38:55] word
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; simply because now I'm not I'm not
[1:38:59] diminishing them.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'm simply saying that what the believer
[1:39:03] has is greater.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; What the believer has is a greater
[1:39:07] answer.
[1:39:09] And the world becomes increasingly a
[1:39:12] troubled place.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; If you think for a moment that we're
[1:39:16] going to kind of break out into a
[1:39:18] beautiful place and there's not going to
[1:39:19] be any of these things, you're mistaken.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; We're going to have all kinds of
[1:39:26] problems and troubles. Right.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And if I wish to, if I wanted to think
[1:39:31] of my youth and my childhood, I feel I
[1:39:34] have a right to be able to speak this
[1:39:36] this morning because uh as as I don't
[1:39:40] speak about my youth and childhood too
[1:39:43] often
[1:39:45] once in a while. I had my wife speak
[1:39:46] about it, but it was a sad life and I
[1:39:50] spent an awful lot of time alone. And
[1:39:52] you've heard it and I'm not going to go
[1:39:54] into it again, but you know, I I had I'
[1:39:57] I've seen people and they they they they
[1:39:59] lost a loved one and then they wouldn't
[1:40:01] let that go and they just mold over on
[1:40:04] that and and let that grief and sadness
[1:40:06] just bring them down.
[1:40:11] But if we have our hope and if we're and
[1:40:14] if we're seeing into another de into
[1:40:16] another realm if we're see the merging
[1:40:18] of these two worlds as it were and we we
[1:40:22] are a people where these two worlds have
[1:40:24] merged
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; tell me what other spiritual leader
[1:40:29] listen to me church what other spiritual
[1:40:32] leader of any church
[1:40:36] you all can say it if you're believers
[1:40:38] of the message but what other group of
[1:40:40] people that fill the churches in this
[1:40:42] land today can say our leader
[1:40:47] said on a regular basis and proved that
[1:40:50] I'm in two worlds
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; and described what was in the next world
[1:40:55] and described what was in this world and
[1:40:57] see them standing there and and and this
[1:41:00] happened not hundreds of times thousands
[1:41:02] of times
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; and we need to ask ourselves why did God
[1:41:06] do that for us? Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Why did God give us that kind of a
[1:41:10] leader?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; He gave us that kind of a leader because
[1:41:15] you are a people that need that kind of
[1:41:17] a doctrine. Because you are a people
[1:41:20] that are that God is literally merging
[1:41:22] the two worlds to. And you're going to
[1:41:24] step into another one and leave this
[1:41:26] one.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And if we haven't got that as a hope, we
[1:41:31] might as well pack it up and leave go
[1:41:33] out of here and have a nice dinner.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; That is not only our hope. That's a
[1:41:38] reality.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; As much as it was for Cleopus, they were
[1:41:41] walking, they were not only walking uh
[1:41:44] uh in this world, they were walking with
[1:41:46] another world.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus never came to into into this realm
[1:41:55] right where they were walking. He walked
[1:41:57] in the dust of the earth. He ate some
[1:41:59] food with them, whatever more. But he
[1:42:01] never depended on natural food anymore.
[1:42:05] He never would go to a cross anymore.
[1:42:08] Why? Cuz he was in another world.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And we could understand something about
[1:42:16] God. God is the one who made this world
[1:42:18] and made the other one.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; And this one is just a negative of that
[1:42:22] one.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; And Satan can work in this one, but
[1:42:26] he'll never work in that one.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] We're here celebrating his defeat.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; We're here celebrating his utter
[1:42:39] embarrassment.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; We're here to tell Satan, "You have no
[1:42:43] control over these people."
[1:42:48] Hallelujah.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And should we rejoice? Of course, we
[1:42:52] should rejoice. And more of us ought to
[1:42:54] rejoice.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Our enemy has been destroyed.
[1:43:01] and I no longer belong to him because
[1:43:04] I've had Elijah tell me that God took me
[1:43:07] away from him.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; He forces Satan,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; the author of death. He forces him
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; to loose you
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; not brother Biscll speaking this God has
[1:43:41] spoken it through his messenger
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; there's a law of life in every believer
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; and he says this
[1:43:52] here's now thus sayith the Lord here's
[1:43:54] Elijah speaking to you I only repeat his
[1:43:58] words
[1:44:01] Regardless,

[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Regardless of how low
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; how little
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; we are.

[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; how low are you this morning? Say, "Ah,
[1:44:16] I'm I'm scraping. Scoop me off the floor
[1:44:19] with a scoop shovel.
[1:44:21] I'm so low.
[1:44:24] Ah, I've had so much." Oh, Brother Bisc,
[1:44:26] you don't know what kind of a week I've
[1:44:28] had. Well, I can tell you here I give
[1:44:31] you thus says the Lord regardless of how
[1:44:34] low you are

[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; and regardless of how unholy we are
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; or how sick we are
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; or how afflicted we are,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; the Lord Law of God's spirit by his word
[1:45:04] makes it obey him.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Not obey you, but obey him.
[1:45:11] He is the author of the law. He put in
[1:45:14] the scene.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; How low are you? Do you hear me? Do you
[1:45:26] listen? Do you believe? Regardless of
[1:45:28] how low you are, regardless,
[1:45:33] [Applause]
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; this law is not subject to any
[1:45:37] conditions.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the conditions,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; and you may sit here this morning and
[1:45:43] you don't need it exactly the way I'm
[1:45:44] preaching, or you might need it tomorrow
[1:45:46] morning.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; All the props, Satan might come in like
[1:45:51] a flood tomorrow morning and knock all
[1:45:54] the props out of you. You want to say,
[1:45:56] "Regardless of how low,
[1:45:58] regardless of how unholy, regardless of
[1:46:01] what's happened, I have a law in me
[1:46:08] because I'm a believer of the word of
[1:46:10] God." And there's a law in that seed.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] Hallelujah.
[1:46:24] God's word.

[1:46:50] spiritual need,
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; regardless of your physical ailment or
[1:46:55] whatever more.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Till
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; till you say it, till you believe it.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Lay hold of it. Confess it.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; While I was studying this, Brother
[1:47:19] Richard and Sister Barbara, I prayed for
[1:47:21] Daryl.
[1:47:23] Hallelujah.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; That devil's a liar.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; And the law of life in Jesus Christ is
[1:47:32] greater than that diabetes.
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:01] [Applause]
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Friend, sometime you have to just stand
[1:48:07] up
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; in the face of Satan.
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I know my wife, she doesn't want me to
[1:48:17] do this,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; but I feel that I need to. Amen.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; In the midst of preaching this service,
[1:48:24] I went to
[1:48:26] uh I was taking cholesterol pills for a
[1:48:31] few years and so I went off them and I
[1:48:34] went back and took blood tests. He says,
[1:48:40] he looked at my
[1:48:42] wow.
[1:48:45] He said, "Were you were you sick when
[1:48:46] you had this test?" I said, "No."
[1:48:50] And so he gave me some reading off of
[1:48:52] that which I won't bother speaking of.
[1:48:57] He said are you diabetic? I said no.
[1:49:01] Said you are now.
[1:49:03] What? Said I don't have any. I don't
[1:49:06] have any problem. No.
[1:49:08] I said well
[1:49:11] what's what's a normal? Oh he said even
[1:49:14] seven would be high.
[1:49:16] I said what's mine? He says 13.6. sex.
[1:49:20] Oh, no. And he says, you know, he saw
[1:49:22] where I was going. He said, "No, no." He
[1:49:23] says, "You're clearly diabetic.
[1:49:27] I'm preaching this in the devil's face."
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; It's not just that, yeah, you in your
[1:49:36] mind, a mind over matter. I accept it. I
[1:49:39] disregard it. I deny it.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; With everything that's in me, I deny it.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; And I I prayed for Daryl this morning.
[1:49:51] He'd been on my heart for some time.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of that man that brother
[1:49:57] Brandham went in with him to pray for
[1:49:59] for his 12-year-old girl and she's
[1:50:01] laying near to death
[1:50:05] and the nurse is and the man is speaking
[1:50:07] to the nurse
[1:50:10] and he's trying to express his faith
[1:50:14] and she's telling him what the medical
[1:50:16] diagnosis is for her and he simply says
[1:50:21] you know in the southern way honey he
[1:50:24] said you are looking at the at the
[1:50:27] monitors. You're looking at the
[1:50:29] instruments.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm looking at the promise."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the difference.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; There's no there's no eternal life law
[1:50:40] in the instrument,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; but there's a there's a law of God
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; in the word, in the promise.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; God said it. The prophet said, "I
[1:50:50] believe it." And that settles it.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:50:55] You need to believe it. You need to
[1:50:57] confess it. You need to speak it.
[1:50:59] Because if you don't need it today, you
[1:51:01] will need it sometime along the road
[1:51:03] before we're out of here.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; It's a lie.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Even some cold, dismal thought can come
[1:51:12] through my mind or your mind and tell
[1:51:14] you something about yourself.
[1:51:17] If it's not in harmony with God's word,
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to say right then, Satan,
[1:51:23] there's a law in me that's greater than
[1:51:27] anything you can speak,
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; greater than anything you can do. It's
[1:51:33] greater than any sickness or greater
[1:51:35] than any affliction. I have a law in me
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; but there is a condition and that law
[1:51:47] will bring about a great change. But
[1:51:49] there is a condition
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; and the one condition the one
[1:51:52] requirement that's needed is the son
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; must draw near. Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; And another thing you can say to Satan,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; he has
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; drawn near.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Revelation 101 tells me that he
[1:52:11] descended.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't descend for the trees or for
[1:52:15] the water or the ocean or the whales. He
[1:52:18] descended for me.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; He descended to come near to me.
[1:52:25] The son has come near. Jesus himself has
[1:52:28] drawn near to me
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; and it causes the law of life in the
[1:52:33] seed to come forth
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; and that law defeat any enemy
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; and if it doesn't then we find ourselves
[1:52:43] to be just bearers of idol tales.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Is this truth?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful change in my life has
[1:52:51] been wrought since Jesus came in.
[1:52:58] Hallelujah.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know who here might have a
[1:53:02] complex, but let it let you ought to
[1:53:06] sign on to this today and and sign it
[1:53:10] because I'm mixing up with my words
[1:53:12] because I've got so much I want to say
[1:53:14] about it. Do you know that the
[1:53:16] messenger, God actually sent the
[1:53:18] messenger to bring a decree?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; A decree. and you want to exercise that
[1:53:26] decree,
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Satan comes to you because he's a
[1:53:29] deceiver
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; and he's already under a sentence.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; God has already sentenced him.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; In the scripture that brother Brandham
[1:53:39] used for the restoration of the bride
[1:53:42] tree, one of the scriptures was Abraham
[1:53:45] went down into Gar with his wife Sarah.
[1:53:49] Brother Ram calls her grandma, but she
[1:53:52] was so beautiful. The young king of IMC
[1:53:54] wanted her to wife and took her and he
[1:53:57] heard from the princes and everyone this
[1:53:59] young beautiful woman came and they took
[1:54:02] her and she said I'm his sister because
[1:54:06] that's what Abraham told her to say
[1:54:09] and the king prepared to take her
[1:54:13] and now now that happened so that it
[1:54:16] wasn't just a little text the prophet
[1:54:18] took to preach on
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; he's telling he's announcing to you and
[1:54:23] I. He's announcing to you, friends. God
[1:54:26] sent brother Brandham to announce to you
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; that this is the season
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; for the bride to be restored back
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; to her original place. Number two, that
[1:54:37] there is a law in you because now the
[1:54:40] word was coming out of a mouth of the
[1:54:42] prophet, the original seed
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; with the original life,
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; with the original law of God in the life
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; coming into the hearts of the believers
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; and presented it to you.
[1:55:00] So that this lying spirit and all his
[1:55:03] lies of deception have no more power
[1:55:06] over you any longer.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; And you can say to that complex and say
[1:55:10] to that spirit and say to that
[1:55:12] depression and say to all this
[1:55:14] discouragement, you are under the
[1:55:16] sentence of almighty God, the sentence
[1:55:19] has already been declared, there's a
[1:55:21] decree upon your head. Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; And the decree that God gave to Aimilec,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; restore the man back, his wife,
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; or you're as good as a dead man.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And you I heard I you heard me say it
[1:55:37] here the other Sunday, but you didn't
[1:55:38] know where it was coming from. God is
[1:55:41] simply saying to Satan, "Give them up."
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; He's saying to the grave, "Give them
[1:55:48] up."
[1:55:49] When Jesus descended and went down into
[1:55:52] paradise and all the Old Testament
[1:55:54] saints were there, he said, "Give them
[1:55:56] up."
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I've got the keys of death, hell, and
[1:55:59] the grave. Give them up.
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:03] [Applause]
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Cleopus and his friend are just like us.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; They were going home for eat, right?
[1:56:19] They didn't know just in another world
[1:56:24] paradise had been emptied up.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize. They didn't know.
[1:56:29] Jesus didn't come and say, "Hey, you
[1:56:31] know what?
[1:56:33] I'm Jesus.
[1:56:36] There's been a resurrection. I resurre.
[1:56:38] That's why the tomb is empty." Come on,
[1:56:40] folks. Get with it.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; That's why they couldn't find me there.
[1:56:44] Cuz I'm not there. I'm here. He didn't
[1:56:47] say it that way. He went to the
[1:56:48] scripture.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Or he could have said, "You know what?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; He He could have said, "You know what?
[1:56:54] Matthew's going to write it in just a
[1:56:56] little bit of time, but the streets of
[1:56:58] Jerusalem is full of all the saints of
[1:56:59] the Old Testament saints. Abraham, your
[1:57:02] father's there. He's walking down the
[1:57:03] streets. All the saints are
[1:57:05] resurrected." He didn't say anything
[1:57:06] like that. He could have, but he didn't
[1:57:07] say that. That wasn't the kind. He
[1:57:09] wasn't trying to convince them mentally.
[1:57:11] He was trying to convince them from the
[1:57:13] scripture. The scriptures been fulfilled
[1:57:16] because that's the seed that has law in
[1:57:19] it.
[1:57:24] And when he came close to them, when he
[1:57:26] came near to them, the law became
[1:57:29] active.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:36] And I'm here to say to you today, the
[1:57:39] victory that you have and the kind of
[1:57:40] life that you have and the victory and
[1:57:42] the power that you have experienced in
[1:57:45] Christ,
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; you have it because the son has come
[1:57:50] near.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He's drawn near to us.
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; He's drawn near that he might be
[1:58:01] glorified.
[1:58:04] Oh,
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; he says, "Oh,
[1:58:10] I'm going to close shortly now. If we
[1:58:12] could just think of that for a minute."
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; And that's just when he had said how low
[1:58:17] we are, how impure we are, how afflicted
[1:58:20] we are, how whatever we are. He said,
[1:58:23] "If we could just think, if we could
[1:58:25] just think of that for a minute, force
[1:58:28] is it
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; regardless of conditions.
[1:58:32] No matter what the condition is, the law
[1:58:35] of God's word forces the condition to
[1:58:39] cope with his word.
[1:58:41] [Applause]
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to our God.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not shouting at the message. I'm
[1:58:50] rejoicing.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing as a son of God, at the
[1:58:55] law of God that's in his word.
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:02] And to those that are streaming, I just
[1:59:04] feel uh compelled at this time. Maybe
[1:59:06] someone who's streaming is in a place of
[1:59:08] sickness or in a place of desperation.
[1:59:11] The law of God in the life of the word
[1:59:15] that we've received forces that
[1:59:17] condition to cope with the word of God.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:28] Hallelujah.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; It's greater, friends,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; than any weakness we may have. It's
[1:59:35] greater.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; It's greater than any spiritual
[1:59:39] affliction. It's greater.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Don't go out of this place with some
[1:59:43] complex plaguing you. That complex has
[1:59:47] no right
[1:59:48] [Music]
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; in this house of God.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Don't be depressed and discouraged. It
[1:59:56] has no right. You can't find it in this
[1:59:59] Bible. And they shall be depressed.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; And they shall be discouraged.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; And they shall be down in the dumps. No,
[2:00:07] that's not in the word of God.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; They shall be loosed.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And to the redeemed whom he has loosed
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; by his blood.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:30] Hallelujah.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Every time the Lord Jesus
[2:00:38] drew near, it was for a specific
[2:00:41] purpose.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; He drew near
[2:00:48] to Moses. It was Christ and Moses.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; But he drew near to Moses because he had
[2:00:54] a specific job to do. specific task.
[2:01:00] He drew near
[2:01:02] when he came and visited in his first
[2:01:04] coming and walked on the earth. He drew
[2:01:07] near
[2:01:08] and he drew a group to him that would be
[2:01:11] faithful and and because he drew near,
[2:01:14] they would be the witnesses
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Because the book of Acts must start out
[2:01:22] on the witness of the resurrection.
[2:01:24] Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; He's raised from the dead.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's the theme of the book of Acts.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; And that's the foundation of the church.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; He's raised from the dead.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Victory over death. And he was the first
[2:01:38] fruits. That's the whole testimony.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; If that was gone,
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; the whole thing is lost. The whole
[2:01:44] foundation of the church is gone. Listen
[2:01:46] to me now as I come to a close. And that
[2:01:49] is why when Jesus drew near to these two
[2:01:53] disciples, they were on the verge of
[2:01:56] losing it.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was determined because the
[2:02:03] whole church must be founded on the
[2:02:06] resurrection message.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; He's risen.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; He's not here. He's risen. And when
[2:02:14] Jesus met those two on the way to Emmas,
[2:02:17] they didn't know where he was.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; But when he when he revealed himself out
[2:02:23] of the scriptures and opened their eyes
[2:02:26] and opened their understanding, what did
[2:02:28] they do? They ran to the other apostles
[2:02:31] and said, "He is risen."
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, they were right on
[2:02:38] target. They knew what they were
[2:02:40] supposed to say.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] They didn't go and say come into the
[2:02:47] room where the apostles were and say,
[2:02:48] "Do you know what? We just had the most
[2:02:51] incredible experience."
[2:02:54] What? What happened? Well, uh, my friend
[2:02:57] and I were walking along the trail and a
[2:03:00] stranger walked and joined up with us
[2:03:03] and we just walked along and we're
[2:03:04] complaining and so they didn't go back
[2:03:06] and relate all that.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; They just came with the whole heart of
[2:03:10] the message. Amen.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; He's raised.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; He's risen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; That's all he needed to know. Everything
[2:03:17] else was just unimportant. He's risen.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; And I say to you, in the name of Jesus
[2:03:24] Christ, Jesus himself has drawn near
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; in this generation. Yes.
[2:03:30] [Music]
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; You know the ministry
[2:03:37] I am closing but you know the ministry
[2:03:40] I'm I'm on this thought Jesus himself
[2:03:42] drew near the ministry of Jesus and John
[2:03:46] or Jesus and the and Elijah the spirit
[2:03:48] of Elijah are so close together. Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; So
[2:03:56] the angel came to Zachchariah and said,
[2:03:59] you know, he'll be great in the sight
[2:04:02] and he'll go before the Lord and prepare
[2:04:04] the way and he'll go in the power and
[2:04:08] the might of the of Elias.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; He will be going in the spirit of
[2:04:13] Elijah.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Elijah that hadn't lived for hundreds of
[2:04:16] years. There had been Elijah and Elisha
[2:04:20] right after him. And now nothing.
[2:04:23] Brother Brandham says God takes this man
[2:04:26] but not the spirit.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; And so now Elijah, the spirit of Elijah
[2:04:32] comes and foruns Jesus.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; And it's Elijah, the spirit of Elijah.
[2:04:38] Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[2:04:41] the sin of the world.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah.
[2:04:46] And then Jesus broke on the scene. They
[2:04:48] killed John.
[2:04:50] And Jesus broke on the scene. And then
[2:04:53] the word went around, "John is raised
[2:04:55] from the dead."
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; And they asked John, "Are you Christ?"
[2:05:00] No, not. And when Jesus came, they said,
[2:05:04] "John's raised again from the dead."
[2:05:06] Always getting those two confused.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Elijah and Christ. Always.
[2:05:14] And then the spirit of Elijah comes in
[2:05:16] this day again. But why did the spirit
[2:05:18] of Elijah come to announce to the
[2:05:20] people? Jesus himself is drawing near.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of the spirit.
[2:05:26] Prepare a way even before and tell the
[2:05:29] people. Get ready. Make ready. The
[2:05:31] kingdom of God is at hand.
[2:05:33] And Jesus himself drew near
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself in the plan of
[2:05:38] salvation
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; to the people and chose a group of
[2:05:41] people out, a small handful of people
[2:05:43] that would be that would testify to the
[2:05:46] resurrection.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose at that time. And
[2:05:50] now in the end time comes the spirit of
[2:05:52] Elijah again because the bridegroom is
[2:05:55] drawing near to the bride because he's
[2:05:58] got to make himself known to the bride
[2:06:00] because they're going to a marriage
[2:06:01] supper and they got to be married before
[2:06:03] they go to the supper.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; So he's got to draw very nearer than he
[2:06:08] had before. That's you folks.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; He came for you.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; He came to make this announcement to
[2:06:17] you.
[2:06:19] [Applause]
[2:06:22] Not the half million in Durban and how
[2:06:25] many more in Bombay and down in Houston,
[2:06:27] Texas and all those things. We didn't
[2:06:29] hear those beatings. We didn't see those
[2:06:31] great things. But he came for one
[2:06:33] purpose to get a bride. And he in the
[2:06:35] message of shame to him, he's in prayer.
[2:06:38] He says, "Let let let let me go and get
[2:06:40] your son a bride."
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; It was that spirit that was in him
[2:06:46] calling out.
[2:06:47] He had to make a way for the bridegroom
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Elijah
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; letting us know Jesus himself is drawing
[2:06:56] near.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; And he has
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; and the other the other
[2:07:03] essential is that you need to recognize
[2:07:06] it.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; And by recognize it by recognizing it,
[2:07:11] it activates it. And that is why when
[2:07:13] Jesus had come very very near and was
[2:07:15] talking to disciples, he said, "Who do
[2:07:17] men say that I am?"
[2:07:21] Not who I am, who I was or who I will
[2:07:23] be, but who do they say that I am?
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "That's
[2:07:27] really wasn't the question. The question
[2:07:29] was, the next question was, but who do
[2:07:31] you say I am?"
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; And Peter gave the right sir
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; confession. Thou art the Christ,
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; He got the revelation of it.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And that's what the that's what the son
[2:07:47] coming near was to do.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; So friends, conclusion in conclusion,
[2:07:54] every believer here has a a law in you.
[2:07:59] Yes.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; And I would encourage every believer
[2:08:02] here to give more time and focus and
[2:08:06] meditation on what it was, what it is
[2:08:09] that God has actually deposited in you.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; And that you should know there is no
[2:08:15] condition
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; in the world. There is no circumstance
[2:08:18] that Satan can impose upon you that can
[2:08:23] even if he puts a block of concrete on
[2:08:26] the law of life is going to wiggle its
[2:08:28] way on the other side and come out into
[2:08:31] the presence of the sun.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful treasure we
[2:08:41] have
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; in this glorious word. Amen.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; so thankful.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Thanks for the inspiration. God bless
[2:08:57] you.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:09:06] it's just wonderful. The Lord keeps pour
[2:09:10] pouring a little more in.
[2:09:12] I tell you what, I don't know what it
[2:09:13] means to you all, but it
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; glory.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's what keeps it keeps me going.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; That wonderful, that's what keeps us
[2:09:23] going.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; And you don't want to you don't want to
[2:09:27] forget. You don't want Satan to so uh uh
[2:09:31] complicate your life and so fill you up
[2:09:33] so that you you only think of this once
[2:09:35] every two three days. I want you to
[2:09:37] think about it in the daytime while
[2:09:39] you're doing your work and while you're
[2:09:41] doing your, you know, your duties in
[2:09:43] life. I just want you to think about
[2:09:45] that. I am a believer
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; and I do have I have that seed in me.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; And and not for not only that, but that
[2:09:54] seed has a law in it.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; That is more than adequate
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; for any condition.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Any condition.
[2:10:05] And I'm You know what?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prophesy.
[2:10:11] Oh my goodness. You going to prophesy,
[2:10:12] brother Ed? I said, "Yeah, I'm going to
[2:10:14] prophesy right now."
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; We are going to gather
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; on the other side
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; according to his promise.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; And we're going to join a great host of
[2:10:29] witnesses.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to shake your hand.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shake hands with you
[2:10:36] sisters. I'm going to shake hands with
[2:10:37] the people. We're going to shake one
[2:10:39] another's hands. And and and and Elijah
[2:10:41] furthermore came to announce to us.
[2:10:43] Says, "We're going to hug one another."
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:48] [Applause]
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "And we're going to sit at a
[2:10:52] table
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; that's been reserved as place reserved
[2:10:55] for you."
[2:10:58] [Music]
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And the king will come.
[2:11:02] Is this a story
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; or is this reality?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; This is our expectation. This is what
[2:11:09] Elijah has said
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; and the king is going to come.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Don't cry, children.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Don't cry anymore." And he'll wipe away
[2:11:20] the tears from our eyes. There'll be no
[2:11:22] more death
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; and no more sorrow
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; and no more weeping
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; and no more pain.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; What got us there? The law of life in
[2:11:33] Christ that's in us. That law got us
[2:11:36] there.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; I think we can rejoice.
[2:11:51] [Applause]
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a verse or two.
[2:12:02] It's a glorious church.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; A lot of the young people that are
[2:12:10] scattered throughout the building. I'd
[2:12:12] be happy if you displace some of the
[2:12:14] older folks right here at the front and
[2:12:16] came down
[2:12:18] came down and just take a place down
[2:12:21] here right in front. I love speaking to
[2:12:22] the young people.

[2:13:10] evening service. We really

[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Let's do business for God.
[2:16:32] [Music]
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Anybody here think you've been born with
[2:16:37] a complex that you have to hang on to
[2:16:39] all your life?
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; We're going to break that power right
[2:16:45] now.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; If you believe, if you believe what God
[2:16:49] has spoken,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing. And then Jesus came.
[2:16:55] The words that came out of brother Tom's
[2:16:57] mouth. Yes, sir.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, the tempter's power is
[2:17:01] broken.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes,
[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; the tears are wiped away. He takes what?
[2:17:10] The gloom.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; This world's got a lot of gloom.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; And people live under a cloud of gloom.
[2:17:17] Don't do it, friends.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Don't allow it.
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:27] Will you give me a moment?
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; I always have felt this just the way my
[2:17:32] mind thinks. I always have felt if I
[2:17:35] give in to Satan,
[2:17:38] then I I glorify him
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; and I sure don't want to do that.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; And I take away from the majesty of
[2:17:46] Jesus Christ and the power of his cross.
[2:17:49] Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; So I want to and we must always point to
[2:17:54] the cross
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; and tell Satan your head was crushed.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Death was defeated.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; You cannot bring this cloud upon me.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; You cannot bring this lie upon me.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; It could be something. It can be
[2:18:12] something handed down.
[2:18:13] [Music]
[2:18:17] It could be something handed down.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; It can comes. It can come. Brother
[2:18:21] Brandham said, "This man came to Brother
[2:18:23] Brandham said, "I've got a stubborn
[2:18:25] spirit." You've heard me say it many
[2:18:26] times. He said, "I've got a stubborn
[2:18:28] spirit."
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "Well, now I
[2:18:33] would have to go back."
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:37] Could come from a father or mother or
[2:18:40] grandparents, he said, "Or an uncle.
[2:18:43] which I thought was very strange. It
[2:18:46] could just come from way back there.
[2:18:49] Dear friends, if you never hear another
[2:18:51] word I say,
[2:18:54] take this and anchor it in your soul.
[2:18:57] The law that is in you is greater than
[2:19:00] anything that was ever handed down.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:05] The law of life that is in you is
[2:19:08] greater than any complex or anything
[2:19:12] that we could have inherited or could
[2:19:15] have we could have uh it could have
[2:19:17] developed through the kind of life that
[2:19:18] we had to live or whatever more the law
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; regardless
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; of what the condition is.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing then Jesus came.
[2:19:34] and the tempter's power is broken. Then
[2:19:36] when Jesus comes, it is. And I'd like
[2:19:39] you just to become real reverend and
[2:19:43] enter into that atmosphere.
[2:19:46] And if you feel it's you, you can reach
[2:19:50] out to him right where you are. We're
[2:19:52] going to have prayer in a moment.
[2:19:56] If you feel you need special prayer,
[2:19:59] you're welcome to come down and there's
[2:20:01] brethren that will pray with you.
[2:20:05] But I only those that are needy. Not not
[2:20:07] I want to go deeper with the Lord or I
[2:20:09] have a great hunger for God. Not that.
[2:20:12] But just exactly what I'm saying. If you
[2:20:14] have something that you have not been
[2:20:16] able to gain victory over this darkness,
[2:20:21] this depression, this I hate that
[2:20:23] spirit.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; I really do.
[2:20:27] I I have a holy hatred for that spirit.
[2:20:30] It depresses people and brings them down
[2:20:33] into the doldrums.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; And he has no right to do it.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; No right to do it whatsoever.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; So let's just sing this. When Jesus
[2:20:44] comes. Thanks, brother Ryan.
[2:20:52] When Jesus
[2:20:55] comes,
[2:20:58] the temptor's
[2:21:00] power is broken.
[2:21:05] When Jesus
[2:21:08] comes,
[2:21:10] the tears
[2:21:14] away.
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:18] He takes the glue.
[2:21:23] and fills the life with glory.
[2:21:31] For all is changed.
[2:21:36] When Jesus
[2:21:38] comes to save,
[2:21:41] when Jesus comes, when Jesus
[2:21:46] comes,
[2:21:50] and his power is
[2:21:54] Jesus. When Jesus
[2:21:58] comes,
[2:22:01] the tears are wiped away.
[2:22:08] He takes the glor
[2:22:13] and fills the night with glory
[2:22:21] for all.
[2:22:26] When Jesus
[2:22:28] comes to you,
[2:22:34] [Music]

[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.

[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Let the devil hear it.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; We're here to give him praise and glory.
[2:34:52] Friends, this is the only reality there
[2:34:55] is in this world.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; And you have been called for a specific
[2:34:59] purpose in this end time. Friends,
[2:35:02] there's been no other people that I know
[2:35:04] of all through the centuries that have
[2:35:05] had this kind of a call.
[2:35:08] Cleopus, his friend, and the disciples
[2:35:10] were to witness the resurrection. By
[2:35:12] God's grace, we shall witness a
[2:35:14] resurrection. And more than that, we
[2:35:16] shall go with them
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; into the rapture of the church. I'm
[2:35:21] going to ask you, brother Dominic, if
[2:35:22] you will come down, please, and pray a
[2:35:25] prayer of blessing upon the people while
[2:35:27] we sing the chorus once more.
[2:35:30] I am redeemer.
[2:35:33] [Music]
[2:35:37] [Applause]
[2:35:39] Jesus.
[2:35:43] [Music]
[2:36:00] I am.
[2:36:08] Before brother Dominic uh prays,
[2:36:12] he has a great deal to be thankful and
[2:36:14] happy for.
[2:36:16] uh about 2 3 weeks ago, he stepped into
[2:36:19] my office and he said, "Uh
[2:36:22] there's a a young lady who has
[2:36:27] uh immigrated to the United States and
[2:36:30] she just arrived there in November. Is
[2:36:33] that right?" That's right.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; I want to have my facts right.
[2:36:38] and uh he said uh
[2:36:43] I'm going to go there in a few days and
[2:36:46] ask her to marry me.
[2:36:49] That's the way I like it. It's simple
[2:36:53] and so nice and he's speaking with
[2:36:55] myself about it. We had prayer and and
[2:36:59] uh uh then he sent me a nice little
[2:37:02] email and he said, "Praise the Lord."
[2:37:03] She said, "Yes."
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:08] [Applause]
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:16] And so no doubt we will see her one of
[2:37:19] these days as well and she'll be here
[2:37:22] and joining our brother Dominic. Uh, I
[2:37:26] just appreciate the sincerity
[2:37:30] and uh, people may be up in the balcony
[2:37:34] as our brother Dominic sits there and
[2:37:35] you may not see him or ever get a chance
[2:37:37] to shake hands with him, but I can tell
[2:37:41] you one day it was this brother who
[2:37:43] said, "I I uh, I I sent an email to you
[2:37:48] and I he said I was going to send it and
[2:37:50] I didn't send it and uh have had
[2:37:55] such a God so spoke to him in the
[2:37:57] service. He said, "It's not really
[2:37:59] necessary for me to send it, but I'll
[2:38:00] send it anyway." Brother Dominic, it's
[2:38:03] one of the one of the finest emails I've
[2:38:06] ever received. It was lovely. It was
[2:38:09] lovely quotes from the prophet and and
[2:38:12] it just uh uh really speaks to a
[2:38:16] person's heart. I'm going to ask,
[2:38:18] brother Dominic, to ask God's blessing
[2:38:20] upon the congregation as we're
[2:38:22] dismissed. and then come back early, get
[2:38:25] a good seat, and be ready to hear the
[2:38:27] word tonight. Father Dominic, please
[2:38:32] let's bow our heads.

[2:39:15] believe, but receive. not only to
[2:39:18] receive but to be obedient to the
[2:39:21] fullness of the word. That's what
[2:39:23] aneteras to the token and thank you

[2:39:44] but to receive this spleen word which is
[2:39:47] the original seed. And thank you,
[2:39:49] Father. And we believe, Father, that in
[2:39:52] this very moment, we are going to
[2:39:55] witness just like the two disciples down
[2:39:57] on Nemiah Straight that how our hearts
[2:40:00] were really burning within inside us as
[2:40:03] God was speaking to us span the day.
[2:40:06] Thank you, Father. Now go with us as you

[2:40:11] and be ready for brother Tomo to come
[2:40:14] forth with the word. And we can only say
[2:40:17] we committing everything into your holy
[2:40:19] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:40:21] Christ. Go with every individual each
[2:40:24] and every one of us. Father, if it's
[2:40:27] pleasing to you again, let us meet in
[2:40:30] this very evening in the name of the
[2:40:32] Lord Jesus. Granted, Father. Amen.
