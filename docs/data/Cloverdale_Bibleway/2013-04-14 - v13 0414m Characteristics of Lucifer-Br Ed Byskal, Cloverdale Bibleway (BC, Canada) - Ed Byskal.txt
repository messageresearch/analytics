TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Savior is Jesus my Lord. A wonderful Savior to me. For he hideth my soul in the depth of a rock where rivers of pleasure I see. He hideth my soul. He hideth my soul in the cliff of the rock that shadows a dry thirsty land. Oh, where he hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there with his hand and covers me there with his hand.

Oh, he hide in my soul in the cl of the rock that shadow [Music] thirsty. [Music] When he hideth my life in the deck with love and covers me there with his hand.

Oh, when he covers [Music] with his hand. Oh, let's sing the fourth verse. When clothed in his brightness, when clothed in his brightness, transported I rise to him in clouds of the sky. Oh, his perfect salvation. His perfect salvation, his wonderful love. I'll shout with the millions on high behind [Music] my life in the depth of his love and covers me there with his hand and covers me there. With his hand. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Only you, Lord. Only you. Blessed be the Lord. Holy you, Lord. It's only you. Hallelujah. He's the only one can satisfy our soul this morning. Only you, Lord. Lord, it's only you. You're the fountain.

The fountain that I run to. You only you [Music] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to ask maybe the brothers can prepare for the morning offering as we're just going to prepare to go to prayer also as we want to sing onlyly believe. Sister Linda, we have quite a few prayer requests this morning. Amen. I'm not going to read all of them, but we do just want to mention the names before you and ask that God would just move on their behalf. Our sister Rebecca Hegman has a silent prayer request. Our brother Levi Drake needs healing. Brother Sam and Sister Renie also asking that the Lord would grant them a healing touch. Amen. And our sister Sylvia is asking we'd remember her mother, Mother Sergeya for a friend, Sister Grace going into surgery and her prayer request for Sister Dorothy McGowan. There's many needs. Amen. There's needs in our bodies, needs in our hearts and our families. Amen. So, why don't we just sing onlyly believe, only believe all things are possible. Amen. I'm going to ask that our brother John Andy's would just come and lay his hands on these requests and remember them before the Lord. Only believe. Amen. Brother Brand said the angel of the Lord loved this song and I believe he's here this morning to meet our needs. Amen. So why don't we sing this as we prepare our hearts to go to prayer. Only believe. Only believe that all things are possible. Holy be. [Music] All things are possible. Holy. Why don't you just hold something in your heart now as you sing, "Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe." Just lay it at his feet this morning. Lord, I believe. For all things are possible. And Lord I believe, Lord I believe. [Music] Lord I believe. For all things are possible. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. We want to come with thanksgiving in our hearts, praisees on our lips, Lord, that the very water, Lord, that we're anointing, Lord, this word with this morning, it's going to carry us into a body change. So, as an assembly, Lord, we just want to approach you with thanksgiving, with a giving, Lord, pouring out of ourselves. We want to be willing, Lord, to lay it all down, God, and praise you and worship you. Recognize your presence among us, Lord. Recognize your word that has brought us to such a time as this, Lord. Recognize the angels that are lying in these walls, Lord. Recognizing the redeemed that's standing next to us, Lord. Recognizing your word that's been broken for us. Oh, angel of the Lord, lead us, Lord, through this nighttime, Lord. the pillar of cloud by day and the fire by night. Lord, we believe your supernatural is all around us. We believe you've come inside of us now as a people and you're looking to our words. You're looking to our confession. You're looking to our faith now. We've moved into another channel. We've moved into another bracket. There's been another people rise up on the face of the earth who your word is now within their lips. You're within their heart. She knows what you want done with the word. We're approaching you with that revelation, not of an elementary infant faith, but a wife who's making herself ready, bursting, Lord, under anticipation for the pregnancy that we've endured for these 50 years now. That it would bring forth a rapture. That it would bring forth a redeem, Lord, through the womb of our souls. We're asking for revelation today, God, that you would just blanket this whole address and this property, especially the sanctuary with your divine presence. Take control of the nursery, the fellowship hall out over the internet. Lord, we pray that your third pull would move within the hearts of a people. Our hearts are beating with anticipation. We're expecting, Lord, a move of the Holy Ghost. Even today we believe as a special day. Our hearts, Lord, have been primed for a word, Lord. A change. As eagles, we feed off of you, Lord. We're asking your presence, God, would take control of the vessel that you've provided for us through our pastor. And Lord, may he feel such a liberty to speak under that divine channel. The Holy Ghost would minister to every life that's here. We trust you. We have confidence in you, Lord. We're laying hands on all of these prayer requests, this prayer clause. Lord, there's unspoken requests. My hands are lifted up, Lord. Hands are lifted up throughout the world. We're looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. Heavenly Father, you are the one that has trumpeted out this message that this is our Jubilee time and everyone can go free. You've delivered a word for our souls. You brought us into your very heart, God. Our spirits, Lord, are brought into a rapturing change. Lord, our bodies, Lord, are being healed. You're doing miracles, Lord. Even this past week, Lord, you've done miracles for some in our congregation and many throughout the land of the bride. And these prayer requests are great, and they are many. Would you minister to our families, minister to these individual hearts, God? break out upon us, Lord, with your divine hand as the water and the blood flow from your side. May the Holy Spirit be unleashed, Lord, in divine healings and miracles, deliverances. We're silent, Lord, in your presence, but there's a great opening that's happened. Our hearts are just pulsating with that divine anticipation of the move of the Holy Ghost. Bless the morning service. Bless this offering. We dedicate it to you. Everyone that gives, those that cannot give, may you multiply it for your kingdom in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Glory. Already provided. He's already proided. You may have your seats. Everything you need, he's already provided. Every promise, oh, every promise you can claim, just ask it in his name. Everything you need, I believe he's already provided. Oh, you believe it this morning? Just say it once more. He's already provided. Yes, he's already provided. He's already provided everything that you need. He's already provided every promise. Every promise you can make. Just ask it in his name. Everything you need. He's already provided. Hallelujah. We believe that this morning. Amen. And we want to greet each and everyone in the name of our Lord Jesus. We're happy to have you here with us this morning. And I'm going to ask our sister Natasha if she would just come. She has a special for us. There's a couple testimonies that we also wanted to share. Our brother Quibbus wants to give all the glory to the Lord. He says, "A back it felt as if I was losing my sense of hearing in my right ear. And after the service, Brother John prayed for me. And the very next morning early, my right ear came open and is still open. Thank you, Jesus." Amen. And also a note of thanks from our sister Leverne. I want to give God all the honor, glory, and praise for he is worthy. Stanley, my son, is recovering speedily and is in rehab and working very hard to learn how to get around without part of his right leg and foot. But all is well. I thank everyone for praying for me and my family. God bless all. I am so thankful for the family of God. All my love, Sister Leverne Clemens. God bless you, Sister Leverne. Amen. We want to remember the prayer meeting this Friday also here at the church at 7:30. Amen. We'll turn to the word after Sister Natasha sings. Amen. May God bless you, sister Natasha. [Music] I know you're going through the fire. It's getting hard to stand the heat. But even harder is the wondering is God's hand still on me. [Music] It's lonely in the flames when you're counting days of pain. But the potter knows the clay, how much pressure it can take, how many times around the week till their submission to his will. He's planned a beautiful design, but it will take some fire and time. It's going to be okay. Cuz the potter knows the clay. [Music] friend. I just came through that fire [Music] not too long ago. And looking back, I can't see why. And that my God was in control. But on the hottest days I'd cry, "Oh Lord, isn't it about time?" But the potter knows the clay. How much pressure it can take. How many times around the week till there's submission to his will. He's planned a beautiful design, but it will take some fire and time. It's going to be okay. Cuz the potter knows the clay. He's planned a beautiful design. But it will take some fire and time. It's going to be okay. Cuz the potter, he knows the clay. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing pour your spirit out situ number 1248. Thank you, Sister Natasha. Appreciated that. I've just had this song on my heart for weeks now and felt that we could just sing it in worship. Lord, pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Amen. Why don't we start with the first verse? Lord, I seek you. Oh Lord, I seek you. Help me find you. How I need your touch. Oh, just as a prayer, find my dry and broken places. Find my tri broken places, thirsty for your love. Lord, forgive me if I've wandered. Oh, and Lord, forgive me if I've wondered far away from you. You are all I've ever needed, Lord. Oh, you are all I' [Music] ever needed. Come and make me new. Hallelujah. Pour your spirit out, Lord. Oh, pour your spirit out on me, Lord. Fall and saturate, saturate my thirsty soul. Oh, come and pour aresh on me and fill my cup again. Oh, heal my heart, Lord. Oh, and make me whole. [Music] I need you now for your spirit. Can we just sing that verse once again as a prayer? Lord, I seek you. Oh Lord, I seek. Are you seeking the Lord this morning? Hallelujah. He'll be found of those who seek him with all their hearts. The word says, hallelujah. You need his touch this morning. Oh, find my dry and broken places, Lord. Hallelujah. My broken places they are thirsty Lord for your love and Lord forgive me if I far away from you. You are all You are [Music] and your spirit on me and my Oh s my mercy on me [Music] again my heart and [Music] I for your spirit. For your spirit, [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, my heart and me. [Music] Wait for a couple of days. [Music] Thank you. had quite serious blockage in the arteries and uh so it was just it was just the Lord that uh it all happened right then that way and they were able to and I think then they put a stint in and actually I'm happy to report they're on their way home right now. So we say praise the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; And [Music] uh our sister Buucy who lives right across the parking lot from us is she's uh she became very very weak and we weren't aware of it for some time and uh uh so they've been doing some checks and on her and and we visited her yesterday. She's in the hospital weak, but she uh she's gaining in her strength. And uh she preached to me for about half an hour. So I said, and I said, "I can see you're getting a little tired." I said, "You've been preaching for h about a while." And uh and she she wanted to be here in service this morning. Uh she's a real soldier. Amen. So I'd like to ask the congregation we'd remember her in prayer when we ask God's blessing upon the word. uh uh if I've ever asked for your keen attention, it'll be today. And I'm approaching uh a subject and saying things that perhaps I've never said. I may share a little part of my testimony at the end. And uh the testimony is because uh uh I had a I had a conversation a personal conversation with brother Brandham and I have not shared this in the 50 years except to one or two people or maybe a handful of people. And so you'll just stay real alert. You won't understand it unless you understand the message. And uh so we're just going to ask God's blessing upon the word and I'll ask for your very very kind attention and no movement uh unless absolutely necessary. May God bless all the people that are streaming and I would ask them to be the same not to be distracted while uh while they're listening &gt;&gt; and may God help us. Let's have prayer. Heavenly eternal father, we are so privileged to be able to add our father, &gt;&gt; my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you care for your people. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for these that have needed you in a moment, Sister Heidi. &gt;&gt; And in a moment of crisis, you come through, oh God, &gt;&gt; and you back away the enemy. our precious sister Buucy. Lord, we just pray she'll be restored in her strength, Lord. And whatever has has been troubling her at all, Lord. You know the cause. Remove the very cause. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. And for all that are here today, Lord, you know exactly what we need. And I pray that we'll be able to receive and the hearers whether they're streaming on what continent they may be or what country they may be in or those that may hear the archive service. I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that you will uh gain great victories and we pray that it'll be a contribution to the kingdom of God. We say thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Forgive us our sins, Lord. Forgive us our wrongs and forgive us our debts as we forgive others. Father, I pray that you will be glorified in the name of Jesus Christ. And give us a tent of hearts, a tent of minds, and receptive hearts in the name of Jesus Christ. And may you and you alone be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you'd like to turn in your Bibles, please, with me, to Isaiah the 14th chapter. We're going to read just uh two or three verses starting at verse 12. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit. May God bless his word to our heart as you have your seat. This is not a sermon. This is a uh a subject that I'm going to leave with you. I feel it is something that God wants me to say uh as we've journeyed along in this uh message in this end time message which God has brought us to. As we've journeyed along, we've uh we've experienced many things and and uh uh some now, you know, have, you know, arrived at some questions in their heart and uh we've we've just had a long journey and uh and so I want to address uh some of these things, but I want to speak on with God's help the I have a title and a subject and the title is the characteristics of Lucifer and the subject is uh the evolution of Lucifer because he has evolved from one thing to another. Uh the characteristics the word characteristics is the showing of the character the showing of the character or traits. It is it can be a feature of a person or a thing that serves to identify it. &gt;&gt; So you see a certain feature you see a certain thing happening and then you can identify it and uh the characteristics can also be the appearance or the attribute. So we say the attribute now uh we we go from Lucifer and this I'll be going through this in the service now from Lucifer to the serpent and from the serpent to Satan and from Satan to the devil. And it's surprising you I until I got into this subject and I have spent it's going to be hard for me to put maybe 40 hours into one hour, hour and a half or two. So I may have to I've already spoken with brother Tom. If necessary I may break it and come in the evening but I I I would feel badly if everyone wasn't able to be here to have it all together. uh but even in the scripture you'll find that these various titles came in at specific places in the scripture and that's very amazing very amazing very significant over the years in our Christian walk we have yearned to uh we have yearned and studied the characteristics of Jesus Christ we've desired his character her. &gt;&gt; We've yearned to be like him and we've sung songs and we've prayed and we've asked God that we might be like our Lord Jesus Christ and and often perhaps we have felt uh somewhat discouraged because we don't seem to attain to what we desire about him. But the the the the prophet has said, "Study the enemy." &gt;&gt; We've never really studied the enemy. &gt;&gt; We've never made a study of it because it's it's preachers don't like to really preach about it. I don't really like to preach about it because it's a it's such a negative and can cast such a cloud on people. So, don't you allow Satan to bring, you know, uh, condemnation or anything along that nature, but you do do need to know, uh, where where we're at. &gt;&gt; So, he said, study the enemy. What's he going to do? &gt;&gt; What's his move? &gt;&gt; And and then, uh, I'll also ask maybe those that are saying, "Amen." if you'll just you know don't don't disturb the people and and I asked others to say amen when something strikes you. So so what's he going to do and what's the move and then how to meet him and that's what we're here for. The prophet says that's what we're here for. study the enemy's move and knowing how to meet him, the thing that will overcome him. So that's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; That's what this service is all about. The word of God is always the focus of Satan's attacks. The word of God. Yes, sir. Wherever you find the word of God, that will be the focus of his attacks. &gt;&gt; The message and the integrity of the revealed word of God is being questioned by some. That's no surprise to you. It's always been questioned, but it's been questioned in the past largely by those that are considered, you know, considered in opposition to the message and the messenger. But now of recent times, recent years, even questions have risen from within the body of believers. And that's no surprise to you. And so, let's not be ostrich and put our head in the sand. That's just the facts. And so some have relaxed from it because they don't want to really deal with it and are living a substandard life &gt;&gt; and we don't want that. The prophet said he hates all scripture &gt;&gt; and yet and it's the whole cannon of scripture. But if anything he despises mostly is Revelation and Genesis because Genesis tells the beginning and Revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last day. And I I I thank you for your keen attention because by God's help today, I plan to uncover him &gt;&gt; and I want I want it uh to be a stabilizing thing in your heart. To understand a subject, we need to start at the beginning. In the beginning, God dwelt alone with his attributes. That's his thoughts. And there was nothing just God alone. But he had thoughts. And he created angels to worship him. They worshiped him and made him go. In the message adoption, he said he being created his own being created creatures to worship him. His own being in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He said, "So my opinion, the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshiped him and made him go and he started from there." Lucifer was there. All of those that he deceived were there &gt;&gt; and participated in making him God &gt;&gt; because they worshiped him. &gt;&gt; Now, if there's a statement or two that I make uh that you don't quite see, that's fine. Just hold it there. He created angels so he could be God. He said in Abraham's covenant. So I will say angels are skilled in worship. &gt;&gt; They're absolutely skilled. They know more about worship than you and I will ever discover, I would think, except we can worship at a different level. They have never been redeemed. We have been redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Easter Seal, he said in order to be God, they there had to be something to worship him. So he created angels and beings and cherubams and so forth to worship him. Lucifer was part of that heavenly creation. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought in his angels. Revelation 12:8. and prevailed not. Neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, the that old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, &gt;&gt; and his angels were cast out with him. I asked the question, why was Satan cast out into the earth? this little speck of of material uh that is so insignificant in the universe. Why wasn't this enemy cast to the outer reaches of the of the cosmos &gt;&gt; so that he couldn't be found for billions of years? &gt;&gt; Why didn't that happen? No, he's cast out into the earth. This is all a plan and God is aware of the plan. He's cast out and the message, notice now, the message is the key that opens up all of these subjects and glorious things. And so the prophet says the earth was the womb. &gt;&gt; The womb for God's seed. God chose the earth where he would direct his spoken word to the seed his seed spoken word seed to the earth and that life would spring forth all manner of life and the life that you have is a result of that spoken word. So it was part of a plan and uh I will I will go to say this that he was cast out to the earth. There was war in heaven and now the prophet says in the greatest battle ever fought and that war now fell upon humans. That war that was the war amongst angels has now fell upon humans. So I want to say to you very clearly the there's a battle. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the war that was once in heaven is simply continuing now here on earth. &gt;&gt; This is still the war. &gt;&gt; You are in a warfare. &gt;&gt; And it's important to study your enemy's moves and his tactics &gt;&gt; and his character. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. And the war continues because the war was not won in heaven. It wasn't won. It began in heaven. Now you may say, is there war in heaven? Well, whatever part of the heavens uh this is this refers to there was war there. The scripture says so. And he was cast out to the earth. And we're not surprised to say there's war taking place here. And the war is on here because the war hasn't been won yet. &gt;&gt; Even though Jesus Christ has won the victory, it's still there's still a part that we're playing. &gt;&gt; And the war will be concluded according to the divine plan in the scriptures. This great first battle that was ever fought is the greatest battle ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels. It first started the first battle was in heaven. So sin did not originate on earth. It originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from the heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings. Then that battle from angels became became human battles. Another place and it says have been raging ever since. &gt;&gt; So now the first the first human that this battle fell upon was Adam's bride. &gt;&gt; The first human it fell upon was Eve. Adam's bride. Lucifer needed a vessel. &gt;&gt; A body to manifest through. &gt;&gt; So the he he chose the closest thing to the human race. Now please watch closely. So brother Brandham says that Satan was the Lucifer was the right-hand man of God. and we'll come to it later on. And when he's cast to the earth, he comes to the right hand man or the closest that was next to Adam and the only one. And the and the prophet says he he knew that that was the only one that could mix the seed mix with the human seed because it's too far apart from the other animals. So the closest thing to the human race was the serpent. The serpent he said was like a prehistoric mo man. Something like something next a prehistoric man. He says something next to next to man. Serpent. He said the serpent which was a being more like a man in the mark of the beast. In questions answers he said he was upon his feet stood upon his feet like a man in heaven. Lucifer was right next to God. and on earth he entered and used the serpent which was right next to man who was who was the god of the earth. &gt;&gt; So now the same it's it's a it's something that's evolving. You're following me thus far in the mark of the beast. He said Satan could not have been he said Satan could not have been that serpent. Satan could not have been that serpent. He said, "Oh, I'm sorry." He said, "You say that Satan could not have been that serpent." 2 Corinthians 11:14, the Bible said that he transformed himself into an angel of light. He said, "You just underestimate Satan. &gt;&gt; That's all." Yes, sir. He made himself into an angel of light. If he could come into that kind of a substance, then why could he not come into a beast next to a man? &gt;&gt; Notice Satan changes his mask. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "We are instructed by the word of God less Satan should get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices." How is it that we're not ignorant of his devices? Because we've learned, &gt;&gt; we've been taught. &gt;&gt; We are to be instructed. &gt;&gt; We are to study the enemy &gt;&gt; and know his tactics. And when he starts moving, I I do a lot of counseling and there's perhaps people here you in the morning you get up and something just doesn't go right and you just kind of feel a heavy weight and so on. You just be you need to know his tactics. He's setting you up for a punch &gt;&gt; less Satan should get an advantage. For we are not ignorant of his devices. In Ephesians says, "Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil." And the ws is the methods &gt;&gt; of the devil. He has he has methods that he uses &gt;&gt; and uh we need to be able to withstand it. The wilds is actually method. It's it's methodia in Greek or in the Greek but it's method. It is his scheming, his craftiness, his strategy and his deceit. So, have we studied his strategy? Say, "Oh, well, you know, I've got I I'm uh uh you know, uh I I I have depression." Oh, maybe it's not depression. Maybe it's a devil &gt;&gt; that is troubling you and bothering you. I'm not saying you're possessed. I'm just saying that you allow things to happen that is not glorifying to God. &gt;&gt; I'm just live. Why live in depression? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this of God? No, it's not of God. So, let's let's get rid of that. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid for it already. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against, notice the word against, against rulers of the darkness of this world, against the spiritual wickedness in high places. So I say once again, know your enemy. Prophet said, "A real good fighter, he knows and studies his opponent. He studies his licks or his blows." As you know, Brother Brandham was a boxer in his younger years. And he he said you you'd study how he moves. Sometimes a boxer pulls back and and just how he strikes out. We need to study not only the enemy, we need to study what defeats him &gt;&gt; and what we must do as believers. And I believe, hey, there's no way we're going to get through, uh, this age just by, you know, uh, living well. If the circumstances are just right, you know, then it must be God's will. No, sometimes that isn't what works at all. We have to take the initiative. We have to not be on the offensive but the not on the defensive but the offensive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the questions and answers he said again study. Now I don't want you to think I'm being repetitious. I'm being I'm being repetitious like they say coax the real thing. We've heard it a million times too many because they just keep pumping that forward, you know, because they hope that they'll get people uh into their product. So study the enemy, what he's going to do, what's his move, and then to know how to meet him. And that's what we're here for. So I'd like you now to notice please the I'm going to show some slides and the evolution of Lucifer. Lucifer, how art thou fallen from heaven? Oh Lucifer, son of the dawn. The dawn is the word for the morning in the Hebrew word. I'm going to suggest to you, this is not a doctrine, but I'm going to suggest to you, I'm going to give you a couple quotes, that Lucifer may well have been the first one created. You say, "What about Jesus?" No, Jesus was the creator. &gt;&gt; You say he may have created his own enemy. He may be, he may have. Because this war had to conclude, had to come to an end. And I believe that this creation on this earth has happened to do away because he's going to be cast into a lake of brimstone and fire. &gt;&gt; And this thing is going to end, friends. &gt;&gt; We are not going to go into another realm and be into another battle. The one thing that this word of God has promised is that this is going to end. And that's why he died. That's why the beginning of the new creation of God, a new seed, a new spoken word seed spoken by prophets and anchored in the womb of a virgin woman Mary and brought forth a son, the lamb of God, and died for our sins. He'll never die again. &gt;&gt; He'll never pay that price again. This was all done. We're actually seeing no wonder the prophet says the greatest week in all of history, &gt;&gt; his death and his resurrection. How glorious. &gt;&gt; And here we are if we really believe it that this is an end time message, a last messenger, prophet messenger declaring these things and having given us the key to open the message. Let us not reduce this to a church. Let us not reduce this just to some form of worship. We have the greatest thing &gt;&gt; that's ever struck the globe &gt;&gt; and we should be on we should just be so alert. We should be on the very edge of our seats to think that God has allowed you to be born to come in this age to see the conclusion. Even to think that we are here to see the to have live with the prospects of seeing the end &gt;&gt; of the reign of darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No reason. We have every reason in the world to rise up and say, "Glory be to God that allowed me to withstand darkness and the principalities and the powers and has equipped me with the thus sayeth the word of God. A quote from the seal of the antichrist. The right-hand man of Almighty God was Lucifer, the son of the morning, the first. God granted him almost co-workers with him. He was a co-worker partly equal with him. only Satan could not create. Notice that only thing he could not create. So if he was the first, then in the beginning when God spoke and Satan was standing there and heard it &gt;&gt; and he saw that spoken word going out and creating &gt;&gt; and it's the only thing he was held back from. So it's that's why he said, "I'll ascend. I'll be like the most high. I want to create." &gt;&gt; And the closest thing he could get to creating was to pervert what was created. &gt;&gt; And then we move from Lucifer, we come down to serpent. Now he's coming down He said he was probably perhaps better looking than Adam. And the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field. In the mark of the beast says the serpent was a being more like a man. He was right he was right next to the man. And so he who was right next to God, the God now is using an instrument, a vessel that was right next to the God of the earth. &gt;&gt; Think about it. From right next to right next, &gt;&gt; there's a pattern. &gt;&gt; There's an intent. &gt;&gt; There's an agenda. &gt;&gt; And we're studying him. And that is why he would come to the message. &gt;&gt; That's precisely why he will come to the spoken word message &gt;&gt; to do exactly the same thing he did in heaven and did did in Eden. Amen. &gt;&gt; Serpent is the meaning of the word is snake or reptile in the English but it's to practice divination insight foretelling. You'll be like gods. He says to Eve you'll be like gods. They were already like gods. But he's practicing divination. &gt;&gt; And it's seeking knowledge by supernatural means to discover some hidden knowledge. That's what serpent is. So now we have gone from Lucifer, son of the morning, son of the dawn, one that has saw creation unfold to one who is a part of the creation, but he's right next to the God of the earth. Now we move on in this evolution, and this is actually just my very preliminary part of this message. We move on to Satan and now he's an adversary. So he's gone from the son of the morning to a skillful diver, one who practices divination, uh, subtility, the most subtle. Now he's not so subtle. He becomes an adversary. &gt;&gt; Open adversary. &gt;&gt; Now you watch. He'll never He'll never leave that pattern. He comes like, you know, oh, he'll come right in the midst of the most glorious service or the most glorious thing that's happened. He'll come right in the midst of it. And like one who enjoys the light is a part of it and then begins to uh use his craft and his cunning one who withstands or opposes uh in in purpose or act. And the first time that this appears that this title appears in the Bible, he is now an adversary of Israel. The first time the word Satan, that title appears is in Coron, 1 Coronicles 21:1. And Satan stood up against Israel. Now, he's not so subtle anymore. &gt;&gt; And you'll find it even in the individual life, and I I haven't got anything specific in mind, but you'll find it, and each of you can apply it as it comes to you, but I I mainly want to answer questions about the message as a whole. You hear this and you hear that and all the rest, it don't worry about what you hear. Just worry about the individual walk with God. and uh and we'll come to some conclusions in the end. But Satan finally withstood Israel and provoked David to number Israel, which was one of David's great errors and sins. He numbered Israel. I haven't got all the answer for that, but he numbered Israel. For some reason, that was a great sin against God that he would number Israel and God was very displeased. that happened because because Satan now exposes himself as an adversary. So now the son of the morning has reduced is down to an adversary of God's people. &gt;&gt; And the king that God is going to make an everlasting covenant with. So he's become an adversary. Isn't it amazing that this one when he's cast out of heaven, he he found the serpent. Now he's transformed into another mask of Satan and he's found David. &gt;&gt; And he hasn't got any problem finding you. &gt;&gt; That Satan is an adversary. This is kind of the whole overview of the message. Now, devil in the singular does not appear in the Old Testament. Devils do and it's translated into demons and certainly those that Satan drew down with him. But devil singular does not appear in the Old Testament. Now, he's a he's not just an adversary, but he's a slanderer and a false accuser. And the first time that it appears that the word devil appears in the Bible is then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; And this is Matthew 4 and1. This is right at the very beginning of the Lord Jesus. And the Bible says that he now has fasted and and he's and hungered. And so he's weakened. &gt;&gt; And Satan knows exactly when we're weakened. &gt;&gt; He's an opportunist. He knows when you've been deprived of the services or the fellowship of the saints and you become weakened. Uh things things of life have weakened you. And he uses he uses economics and he uses all kinds of things adversity and all kinds of things to come and then finally to slander you even within yourself with self. What is self- condemnation is slander. &gt;&gt; Don't slander yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't bring false accusations upon yourself. I I don't even know if I'm going to make the rapture. I don't feel like a son of God. Don't slander yourself. Don't say something about yourself that God has said something opposite. &gt;&gt; God says you're my son. &gt;&gt; Don't reduce that. &gt;&gt; If you reduce it, it's a false accusation. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Say it, brother Roy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then was Jesus led up the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. Now you'll bear with me. I'm going to share with you some things that I've never ever seen, never ever put together. This didn't come out of a book. I have taken a great deal of time to put one scripture after the other and one quote after the other. But I want you to think of the serpent for a moment. I just want to take a step back. So now Satan has used this vessel and he has polluted and entered into humanity. And when he did that, when he did that, when he got a hold of Adam's bride and got to her first and implanted the only seed that would mix, and the prophet says that the that Lucifer knew that from his great knowledge and understanding of being right next to God, he knew that &gt;&gt; as the only one that would mix. And he got into the serpent, which was the next thing so fine, structured, handsome, perhaps a specimen of almost humanity. And the prophet said he almost had a soul. &gt;&gt; Certainly had a body, but almost had a soul. Had a place for one. And so then he's cursed by almighty God and he's completely changed in his entire structure. There's nothing in a reptile that that looks like a man. He's completely That's the curse. &gt;&gt; And God prophesied to him while he's still upright in the garden. God spoke to him and prophesied that uh that the I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed. &gt;&gt; And if anybody ever question about serpent seed, just go to that Genesis 3:15. Ask them what that means. &gt;&gt; You please tell me what the serpent seed is. And if they say, "Well, it's something." No, no, it's not a migraine headache. I'm sorry. It's not something in the head. It's not something she thought. God didn't say now because you thought this. He said because you did this. And he says it to the serpent because you did this. It was an act. &gt;&gt; And then he was he said the the seed of the woman which doesn't have a seed until God gave her a seed. &gt;&gt; And it was a spoken word seed that produced the new creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we are a part of this morning. &gt;&gt; We might look like a church. We're not a church in that sense of the word. We might look like a denomination. We're not a denomination in that sense of the word. We're part of a new creation &gt;&gt; that came by that spoken word of God. And God has not become dumb. He still speaks. So now, so the serpent, the reptile, the serpent became a an image or image or symbolic of sin cursed. &gt;&gt; The prophet says that God was speaking through Moses. and that Satan was speaking through Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; So now, now we've moved from the garden hundreds of years, many hundreds of years, into the palace of Pharaoh. And Moses had been the right-hand man of Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Now things have just changed &gt;&gt; and he's God's man. And so when God speaks to Moses and he says, "Well, the people won't believe me." And God says, "What do you have in your hand?" A rod, a staff, which is an emblem of the word. Says, "Cast it down." Oh, I hope you can follow me. So he cast the word down and it became a reptile &gt;&gt; and Moses fled from it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't pick it up." So he picks up the emblem of sin cursed. &gt;&gt; He picks it up by the tail and it becomes a rod again. &gt;&gt; In the final end, friends, there going to be complete victory over this judgment. [Applause] And so he held it by the tail. It became a rod again. Put your hand in your bosom. It came out. It was lepous. White and lepous. Put it in again. You have the answer for sin. You're holding the rod which is sin judge. &gt;&gt; I judged it in Eden. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this is the emblem of it. And then we find Moses now &gt;&gt; has been told Aaron will be your prophet and you'll be God to him and go into Pharaoh and say let my people go. And after a series of times Moses had Aaron and Aaron cast down the rod in front of Pharaoh. God is in Moses. Satan's in peril. &gt;&gt; The two are meeting again. &gt;&gt; And so now to display who's speaking. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Aaron cast the rod down. It become a serpent. &gt;&gt; And the other pharaoh, Satan now says that's a cheap trick. calls in his wise men, anointed men, and uh we don't know if they'd ever done it before, but they could do it in that atmosphere. They cast theirs down and theirs become serpents. So, that wasn't very convincing. Brother Brandham says that Moses rod gulped gulped those up gulp gulp gulp and went into the wilderness and did miracles with it. Think about it. &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you one thing. They're they're uh uh what do I want to say? Not replicas, but they're counterfeits. &gt;&gt; Their counterfeits were gobbled up by the original. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God had that original. &gt;&gt; It's a prophet that had the rod. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's a prophet that threw it down. and let it become a serpent and picked it up by the tail and it was back to a rod once again. &gt;&gt; Then on into the wilderness, serpents came and bit &gt;&gt; the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; children of Israel. And they're crying out. And what does Moses do? He makes a serpent of brass. Brass is judged. It's something that's been judged. And the serpent demonstrating now to all the people, not to Pharaoh, but to all the people. Sin has been judged. Friends, this is something God's been trying to get to his people through all these centuries of generations. Sin has been judged. &gt;&gt; And you must accept that. you you ought to rejoice over that sin has been judged. And God constantly reminded them sin has been judged. And all they had to do, he didn't have to crawl on their stomachs or do they didn't have to fast and pray. Just look at sin being judged and you'll be healed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say, "Praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole. And it came to pass that that if a serpent had bitten any man. &gt;&gt; When he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful the way God can be so concise? Any man, any woman, any young person, you've been bitten by the serpent. I'm here to announce to you, he's been judged. &gt;&gt; He already has been judged. And all you need to do is look at the judgment and you'll be free. &gt;&gt; Free friends. This isn't an in this is not an intermission and you have a recess from it. You're free. &gt;&gt; The price has been paid. &gt;&gt; Let this church know and all who ever will stream it know. I wish to make this announcement under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The bride of Jesus Christ is a sinless, spotless bride. &gt;&gt; Virgin bride. &gt;&gt; That's what he died for. Don't dilute it. &gt;&gt; Don't live below your standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then, oh, I can't hardly wait. I'm so I've been so nervous to come so anxious to come to the pulpit this morning. And then comes Jesus on the scene, the son of man, the new creation. And he just comes after 40 days and he's hungered. And now the devil is not now just the son of the morning. He's not just one that practices divination. He's he's much more than that. Now he's not just a slanderer, but now he's an accuser. &gt;&gt; And the two look at each other in the face again. The two that fought in the heavens are now face to face &gt;&gt; on the earth &gt;&gt; where the war has continued. And the same one who has such a brazen attitude now he comes not as to divine or to to interpret the scripture so much but he's coming and he's setting him up as a false accuser. If you're the son of God make these stones to be bread you're hungry. He was not saying there is no son of God. He was saying if you're a son of God, &gt;&gt; he doesn't come saying there's no bride. &gt;&gt; He doesn't come saying there's no believers. &gt;&gt; He comes saying, "Do you think you're one? &gt;&gt; Rise up against him this morning." &gt;&gt; Say, "Based on the word of God, I deny you, Satan. &gt;&gt; You're the same serpent from the beginning. I know your origin &gt;&gt; and I know your end &gt;&gt; and I'm in the midst of a battle and I'm here to tell you you are not victorious. &gt;&gt; You will not win the victory over this individual. &gt;&gt; Bloodbot, &gt;&gt; a new creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus honored his ministry. Now he's coming he's coming towards the great victory of Calvary. So he says, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up." Because now the real proof of his judgment has come onto the earth. And in the greatest week of all history, it's going to hang the new creation of God and take the flesh to death &gt;&gt; and bring it back in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Let's say hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if anything would restrict you from giving praise to our Lord Jesus Christ, I can tell you it's coming from the kingdom of darkness. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of light wants to thank him. The kingdom of light wants to praise him. The kingdom of light, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; your children of the day, the scripture says, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now this progresses. Now Lucifer has moved on down. Jesus the great shepherd has acquired a little congregation 12. He's given them power. They've seen him demonstrate and manifest the power of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they believed on him. But now Satan is moving up close and he has one who will become &gt;&gt; the son of predition. &gt;&gt; And so the son of God and the son of predition. Now Satan once again has become like the right-hand man. He's the treasurer. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I can only say what the Bible says. He's holding the bag &gt;&gt; and he deals with the finances &gt;&gt; of the congregation &gt;&gt; and the two of them are together. They look into each other's eyes and they pro progress until they're at the last supper, the last Passover &gt;&gt; that our Lord Jesus is going to have is in the company of his enemy &gt;&gt; who he cast out of heaven &gt;&gt; and they're having the last communion together. The disciples are filled with questions. Things have gotten strange in the message. Who Who's going to betray him? He said, "Somebody's going to be betrayed." Do you know, Brother Tim? Do you know, Brother John? Who who would do such a thing? &gt;&gt; Mercy. &gt;&gt; And Jesus dips the stop. that was like a choice thing and gives it to Judas and says, "What thou doest do quickly." Then Satan entered him &gt;&gt; and he became this son of predition and went out and sold the Lord Jesus for a measly 30 pieces of silver. I'll say to you young people, adults in this congregation, don't sell out &gt;&gt; the most precious thing &gt;&gt; for some measly material stuff. &gt;&gt; Don't sell it out for an education. &gt;&gt; Don't sell it out for money. Don't sell it out for material things. Don't sell it out because you haven't got time. [Music] The day will come when we'll look on these things and say this is nothing. &gt;&gt; This doesn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; And I'm not suggesting for a moment that we don't that we cease living the lives that we have to live and working and paying our bills and all of those things. That's how the kingdom of God continues. And I trust that you tithe when that time comes. That's the best money that you can invest. &gt;&gt; Can I hear amen from that? &gt;&gt; That's how God's work continues. And I'll tell you, we're we be good stewards by God's help. That's why people from near and afar send offerings to this church because they know that something happens with it. Whether it be print stations, whether it's translators, whether it's I don't know how it happens, but that's how it happens. &gt;&gt; You give and God's work continues on. And we all give as ministers. &gt;&gt; Not I'm not talking about time. I'm talking about of our earnings. We give. &gt;&gt; I think it's a joy. &gt;&gt; Earn all you can, give all you can. In the first seal, though you young people have been going through the seals, in this act tonight, in the first seal, brother Brandham says in this act tonight, we're going to see that it's Satan changing his mask. and all actors. Christ acting the part as he did when he became from a spirit to man. He only put on an actor's garment, &gt;&gt; human flesh, and came down in the form of a man in order to be a kinsman redeemer. In the third seal, he says the second rider, horse rider it is, uh was exactly the same man only he was on another horse which is another power. He just used another power. This power now was this era was over. He get on another power. What was rising? And the the power that exists today in the world is not uh one of, you know, uh maybe centuries ago, but things change. We're in a high tech area now, &gt;&gt; high-tech part. And Satan knows how to use it, does he not? &gt;&gt; And he uses it to damn people. &gt;&gt; And at the same time, he sends It's the same It's the same battle. It's the same thing that's going on. And in the heavens, there's still a incredible struggle because God is is giving his word. And he'll let that pure word be out there in the midst of all of this incredible filth. &gt;&gt; But he'll also burn and cleanse the heavens. &gt;&gt; The prophet said in future home that the heavens will be on fire. According to Peter's gospel, the heavens will be on fire. He said, because the demons, the demon powers and the powers of darkness in high places, all of those things are going to be burned up. He said, it will not be merely a literal fire. It'll be a holy fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For a holy fire from God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says he's riding he's on another horse. What happened? He said he changed his ministry. Are you too weary? &gt;&gt; He said, "We found out he was an antichrist and he had changed his position. &gt;&gt; We found out that when he first when he first just was a white horse, he became a doctrine. &gt;&gt; Listen real close now." And then in the second seal again he said he started in with a demon of a false teaching. Listen very close with a demon of a false teaching and that teaching became a doctrine. &gt;&gt; And that doctrine become incarnate in a false prophet. That's the evolution of it. You know, maybe I'll just break into a little further in the service, but he say what kind of approach does he come with? His approach is exactly as it was to Eve. &gt;&gt; His most cunning approach was when he came and said, "Did did God say &gt;&gt; he wasn't an enemy? He wasn't an adversary. He wasn't I I need to introduce something now. So he just comes with a simple question on the message. &gt;&gt; Was it God that did God say that? Fine. Smooth. Brother Brandham said he's a slicker. &gt;&gt; He said don't try to challenge him with the word. He knows more about the scripture than you do. &gt;&gt; Don't try to answer him. That's exactly what he wants is somebody to respond and answer &gt;&gt; and try and justify your position. You don't have to justify your position. Say, "Well, what about this? What about this question? I've got all kinds of questions. I just leave him to God. &gt;&gt; If he wants me to know, it might be like the disciples that said, "Is this the time you'll restore the kingdom?" And he said, "It's not for you to know the times of the seasons." What kind of answer is that? is saying it's none of your business. And that's God's own prerogative. He can say that. It's not for you to know. Heath freely given us all things that pertain to life. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; I know this is resounding in your heart. He He's given us all things that pertain to life. We got all kinds of questions. How many angels can stand on the head of a pin? How does that do? Is that got anything to do with your salvation? Is he coming on a cloud or is he coming on a horse or he's coming who cares? He said he's coming. &gt;&gt; We don't care how he comes or any of that. That's his business. &gt;&gt; I'm coming home now. So, what what what made the cloud? We have a picture of a cloud. What made the cloud? All kinds of things. Was brother Brandham there? Wasn't he there? Was he standing on the ground? Wasn't he standing on the ground? I'll say a person only shows their ignorance by trying to explain it. &gt;&gt; If you want to start there, go back to Ezekiel and and and tell me about the book of Ezekiel. &gt;&gt; Tell me about the wheel within the wheel and how it moved and the living creatures and where they went. What's the whole story about? I don't know, but it's in the Bible and I believe it. &gt;&gt; Moses was told to strike the rock. He hit it twice. &gt;&gt; And because that he didn't get to go into the promised land, but it didn't change him as a prophet. He still remained a prophet. &gt;&gt; He was the word of God to the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, folks. Let the word free you up. Moses comes with thus sayaith the Lord &gt;&gt; and Moses says you shall not make any graven image &gt;&gt; of any likeness of anything that's on earth or in heaven &gt;&gt; and then the same God comes and tells him something that's irreconcilable. Now you'll make uh you'll make you make these images of cherubams and you'll put them in the most holy place right over the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; I'd like somebody to explain that &gt;&gt; here. Here's here's another one even more difficult says more than one time. Thus sayith the Lord in the scripture and please remember I want everybody's attention. Please remember that when Jesus was here on earth, the only word they had was the Old Testament. That was the cannon of scripture. &gt;&gt; And they and the scripture says the word says, "You shall not eat any meat that has blood in it. &gt;&gt; You will not eat the blood of it, nor of a beast, or of anything because the life is in the blood." And I have the scripture. You shall not eat anything with blood in it and no flesh with blood in it because the life is in the blood and says it once, twice, three times, maybe four times. And and the and the and the people that lived in Jesus time had thus saith the Lord by the prophet Moses. Now, here arises this young prophet out of Galilee, and he sang to the people. And now the people, he's got a small congregation about him and look like a cult. &gt;&gt; And then he comes right down to his message part when it starts getting real squeak. He says, "Except you eat my flesh &gt;&gt; and drink my blood, you have no life in you." They said, "Ah, away with that." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like some of the people of this day to rise up and please explain that for me. &gt;&gt; Come on folks, free yourself. &gt;&gt; Explain that one. &gt;&gt; You have a thus sayith the Lord and a thus sayith who? &gt;&gt; You have a thus sayith the Lord and a thus sayith the Lord. And I say to you, the Lord can do what he wants. &gt;&gt; He can do what he wants. He can say what he wants because we don't understand everything he's saying. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he keeps progressing. So he he he he can come as a question as just uh s uh and then I want to say something to you and please put this down in your heart behind the question is an agenda. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's not the question or the answer to the question he wants. He wants to put forward his agenda. And his agenda is to get you to de disbelieve. &gt;&gt; And you see people maybe they have a a problem or difficulty with a brother or a sister or something and and then finally it it causes them to step out of the fellowship and they're not in the company of the believers anymore. You know the direction. That's when an agenda is in effect. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not an answer to a question. That's an agenda. &gt;&gt; And the agenda and listen to me friends. Some of these that come questions into your mind or someone raises question in your mind. It's not a question for a spiritual answer. The agenda is behind the question. And the agenda is to get you to disbelieve this word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and let it free you. Go ahead and rejoice. &gt;&gt; God has provided a way. &gt;&gt; He's provided an answer and he's the answer. &gt;&gt; If he wants to say things that sound completely irreconcilable, so be it. Because we we puny insignificant. We got brains that aren't even worth a a teaspoon of ashes. And we're going to understand what's going on in another dimension. We creatures of time are going to understand timelessness and eternity. &gt;&gt; And don't forget this one. &gt;&gt; Anyone that has a question concerning anything the prophet of God has spoken and you see that there's an agenda behind it, know your enemy. know the subility &gt;&gt; and simply answer with this. Yes, that's correct. That's what he did say. And uh but I have perhaps two or three thousand things that he said to individuals in public &gt;&gt; and they said it's true. It's true all the time. &gt;&gt; That's right. I want you to come with one of those &gt;&gt; revealing of the secret of the hearts of the people. I want you to come with that. I want you to duplicate that. And once you have, then I will listen to you. &gt;&gt; But not until then. And don't even come back to me until you can do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Because that was our God. And I'm so glad I can listen to those tapes or listen to that however reading that book. And when I do, my heart is moved. I say that's my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's his characteristics. &gt;&gt; That's how he works. &gt;&gt; That's how he speaks. And that's how he manifests himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Says in questions and answers, he says, "And then train for the knockout punches." &gt;&gt; That's what we're doing right now. &gt;&gt; Don't train for a little, you know, a little click on the chin. Train for the knockout punches. I think I just gave you one. You come back when you can do what my prophet did and once you can and don't come back until then &gt;&gt; because your question is not an answer. &gt;&gt; He says and now the enemy is going to study your strategy. The enemy is going to study our strategy with the word. And now Satan studied that studied that all out so perfectly till he come to Eve and he had the best strategy he could use upon her and that was to reason with the word. &gt;&gt; That is his best strategy &gt;&gt; is to reason with the word. doesn't even have maybe an answer, but he reasons with the word. Now, he says this. Now, listen. I have highlighted in red. Now, you never want to reason with God's word. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Don't try to explain it. &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. He says, "Now, you cannot figure God out." &gt;&gt; So, God is the word, and it's just made to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Know your enemy, know his attacks." &gt;&gt; And when he came to Eve, this is one of the significant characteristics, he offered her more light. I I've seen more things in my years in the message come in and people get all enthused. Oh boy. I've had them come up to me says, "If you don't see this, you're you're you're out of it. You're you're just serpent seed or you're a shock or whatever more." Well, I'll just have to wait till the right now. It hasn't happened. No, it hasn't hasn't clicked in. You're so nice and quiet. I suspect you've heard the same thing. &gt;&gt; I've had people come with a box of tapes. You got to hear these. You got to hear these. If you don't hear these, you're out of it. You know what? I can't even find them today amongst the company of the believers. &gt;&gt; They're gone. Elder Skel are gone everywhere. Why? Because they got enticed &gt;&gt; and began to reason with the word of God. We cannot reason with the message. And then they'll turn around and say, "Oh, you're just gullible. You're exactly right. I just eat all he says [Applause] &gt;&gt; and I just wait for it to come to pass. &gt;&gt; I' I've had questions in this message that have stayed with me for years. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to share a part of my testimony in a few minutes in public only because someone else has made it public. They didn't know I was there, but they put it out as though brother Brham was false or speaking presumptuously. And that's the word they used from the Old Testament. Or speaking beyond the boundaries of your authority, speaking inappropriately, that's what it means. And I I just felt if anyone wants to raise that, you have to forgive me because I'm going to tell you part of a testimony I've held for almost exactly 50 years and I have never told it publicly. I'm going to conclude the service with it in just a few moments. he offered more light and then in victory day he said Eve failed to hold her focus I say to this church to all that are streaming whatever you You don't become distracted. Hold your focus and sharp focus. I'll keep my eye upon that word and I'll I'll just wait for it to happen. I'll wait for it to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; This has to do with the brown bear vision. And I had a I had a pastor actually call me and ask me if if I knew something about that and he thought that perhaps you can clarify some questions and uh so I I thought I'll go back and see uh where was the source you know I don't know exactly how I will answer this Yes, I contacted him and I said I I was there then I got other people that were asking and and so on a on the website called believe the sign. Uh they they have that up as a big brown bear vision and that uh I have some slides actually but I wanted to tell you that I was there and in the in the account they give two quotes and I'm going to give them to you. The two quotes where brother Brandham speaks about the big brown bear. talks about the caribou and the grizzly which I was in that vision and then it took about six hours to be fulfilled and then he says and I'll get another bear and you wait and see a big brown bear and he describes it in in several different places he doesn't give quite the details like the measurement of the horns and so on he doesn't give the same details and I want to stop right now because the question came to to my own heart and people will say what's what's the issue about shooting a big brown bear? Well, I will take you to the scripture and say the very God himself. Jesus Christ, God in flesh, says to his disciples, "Cast your net on the other side." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they catch a net full of fish. What's fish got to do with salvation? What what's what's fish got to do with our religion? What's fish got to do? It meant something to them. &gt;&gt; And they caught 153 great fish and the net and the that was number one miracle. Number two, the net didn't break. Number three, they got to shore and the one who spoke has fish already cooking. &gt;&gt; Come and dine. And John says, "I think it's the Lord." Hallelujah. What's that got to do? What's with the brown bear got to do that? That's God's business. If he wants 153 fish or 3,000 fish, it that's none of my business. That's what's in the word of God. Did they catch it? Yes, they caught it and ate some. And I don't know what they did with the rest. That's not my business. you know, twist around dispute and so on. God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Are you satisfied with that? [Music] So, uh let's see what we have here in May 1962. I'll have you look at the dates carefully in the message possessing all things. Many of you remember the vision that I had where I had shot the grizzly bear, nine- foot grizzly bear. And church remembers me telling it here in the caribou. And I had and that's where I was standing with a check green checkered shirt. And I seen a and I seen I seen a great huge brown bear. That might be a Kodiak. And it wouldn't have worked down there in Canada cuz they're not there, you see. But wherever and now Kodiak are not there and wherever it will be it it'll be it will be that's thus sayeth the Lord it will be then in June the next month in message presuming now I'm going back into the country that you might know when I come back next year I'm going to get a brown bear that's almost twice that size. You see if it's you see if it's right or not. I seen it when he was standing when he was standing put my hands on his hunches laying on the ground like that and I could put my hands on his hips like that and him laying down there. Now you find out if that's right or not. Uh you find out if that's right or not. Then this is what you people just watch me first rather than read. You people are the first people that I have as a congregation put this quote up and have told what's taken place and I felt that I was responsible to you. I don't know if God would call me away, but I want you to have this. And so in September 1962, and I have after the hunt. Now on the website, believe the sign. They say William Brham, and I'll read it for you later on, but they say William Brham was on Vancouver Island in 1962 and held six services and did not shoot that bear. He returned to northern British Columbia with Perry Green in 1964 and he did not shoot that bear. So their conclusion was that William Brham the thus said the Lord did not take place and he did not get that bear and therefore what is what is the what is the agenda? Well, the agenda is obvious in the direction the supporters of that have gone. &gt;&gt; Let's not play games. &gt;&gt; People are either serving God uh or or serving God in the light of this message or they've chosen a different way. &gt;&gt; And and uh uh so they said he returned in 1964. What they don't know is that he returned in 1962. Now you know and in 1962 he says he says and this is in September which is just after the hunt and I was with him on that hunt and he says so I in these 30 going on 32 years of ministry I have tried to stay true to the word &gt;&gt; that's the subject matter I have tried to stay true to the word. I don't know of one thing I've ever had to alter &gt;&gt; alter on because I just read it out of the Bible said just what the Bible said and let it go like that. And so I haven't had to take back or rearrange because I just said it the way that the Bible says it. &gt;&gt; You understand where his source is? He said, "And I find out if God has spoken anything, then we must go with that word in order, we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Is that clear? &gt;&gt; I don't think there's a person here and I don't think there's a man alive ever. But what was instructed or led or told of God to do a certain thing and then we ended up we didn't do it. &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be a person here that wouldn't say that I haven't that I have never ever ever ever disobeyed the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's not it's it's just human. &gt;&gt; We are humans. And we do that. I'm not setting you up. I'm saying truth. And if you're here and you've never disobeyed God, I ask you to please stand. We want to all applaud you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. &gt;&gt; So, we all have confessed that we have disobeyed at some time. He says he says uh and then this is following the same quote. He says we seen that in other words what did he see that God has spoken anything then we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled. We seen that &gt;&gt; as I told you last night of a vision just recently. See, I had to be there and warning to be there and telling me 6 months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them. I was one of the them. And I just walked on with the other man and the vision passed through exactly God's part. &gt;&gt; And I was left standing. &gt;&gt; So we want to remember we've got to stay on the word, stay right with the word. And where the word leads, you go right with the word and it'll bring you out. All right. I'm sure &gt;&gt; brother Brandham, Billy Paul, Brother Southwick, and his son Blaine, and myself, we went out. Uh we rode from Brother Southwick's place up at mile 441 on the Alaskan Highway and rode in uh a full day's journey on horses into the mountains and it was a beautiful beautiful day and the next day we got up and it was a beautiful day and now I'm just telling you this as testimony. I have it all written here which you can't have but anyway I just here for reference and uh so the we rode in and then the next day we we got up and it was a beautiful day and the sun just shining beautiful in the mountains and brother brother Bud I remember he just standing and he kind of he kind of mumbled but I was the more or less the point person because I arranged the hunts I bought the food and did those things and arrange for however many were going because you actually count how many slices of bread you're going to use, how many eggs you want, and you count everything because these are having to be carried in maybe 25 or 30 miles on horses. So, you you count everything. So, we got up that morning and and bud, he's kind of looking down like this and he says, "Uh, well, I I think Brother Brandham, no, I'm sorry." He said, "Uh, Blaine," he said, "you you take, uh, Brother Billy, Paul, and Eddie, and go someplace." I didn't pay any attention because they were just up in the mountains. I don't know one valley or one creek from another, one river from another. You go this way. And he said, "And brother Brandham, uh, Brother Brandham and I, we'll just go up on a hill here behind the camp." It was beautiful. It was just mostly grass. In fact, is it happens to be the same valley where brother and I were sitting on the edge of that mountain. And it was soon after he went beyond the curtain of time. And he looked down this valley this way and looked down this way and he said, "Brother Eddie, on the other side it is very much like this. And when you cross over," he said, "you'll find little paths." &gt;&gt; He said, "You walk down one of those one day and you'll find me." &gt;&gt; I believe that's thus sayith the Lord. And it was that valley and they were going to go up. Now the reason they were going to go up the hill, the mountain just behind it was a more gentle slope. And brother Bud, which no one knows except there might be one or two here, he had angina quite bad. Angina just restricted him to exert himself very much. So he'd he'd climb for a little short distance and then he'd have to rest. if he had to run after the horses. He'd have to stop and catch his breath and he had a lot of pain. And then he he was also thinking of brother Brandham because this was the first day out and both of them are about double our age. Uh and uh and so they were going to take the mountain just behind the camp. So we struck off and where we uh down this valley and then then the first mountain that we came past there was a little little narrow valley. They just went up and ended in a in a basin and it just it it just flared out like that on this mountain and on this mountain and we were up about a quarter of the way onto a ledge. Not a lot of trees or stuff there. Just mostly willows and so on because we're above timber. And we just got on this ledge and we're looking up this little basin and here comes a big bear. He was big. I'm going to describe him. And he was he was coming right at the V only he was just on the other ledge on the other side. And he's just going down slowly and turning over stones and looking for rodents and things to eat. And grizzlies eat also roots. So they dig roots or whatever. And he was So we watched him and watched him and we stopped right then. We're right on the knob of this big valley going this way and this little one going up here. And we just stopped and we we crouched behind some willows and we watched him come and he came down and just taking his time. And I think we watched him for perhaps half an hour. And he came right down to the little bald point of this uh valley right across from us. And and he just standing there and you know looking over the whole country and and brother Billy and brother Blaine they're kind of egging me on. I said, "Shoot him, brother Eddie. Shoot him." and I had quite a powerful uh 7mm magnum weapon and uh was flat shooting in the mountains and I said, "No, no, I wouldn't even think of shooting him." I said, "Brother Brandham hasn't fired a shot, you know." He said, "You ought to shoot him. Why don't you shoot him?" this bear. I I've lived in the north a good part of my life and I have seen probably hundreds of bears because where I lived they were more common than a dog. I didn't have a dog but we had bears in the camp every day and and this bear was massive. In fact, his brother Blaine Southwick, who is a grizzly bear hunter and guide, told me he has never seen one that size. He was big. He looked almost black to me, but he wasn't black like a black bear. He was just dark. But he was most unusual. I'm going to describe him for you. And my description now is 100% the truth. &gt;&gt; I have never seen a bear of this type before. He had right behind his ears coming around his neck like that and down to about his hump. and I would estimate about a foot wide, a band. And that band came down and down his chest completely over his cape area. And he was the color of ripe, golden ripe wheat in the harvest time. And I cannot tell you what kind of bear that was. I can only tell you I have never seen one. Blaine has never seen one. And he was the most magnificent animal that you could imagine. And we looked at him a long time. And so a couple two, three times said, "Shoot him. Shoot him, brother Eddie." I said, "No, no, no. I'm not I'm not." And then I saw this massive head. He just standing out there like that. We're right over here. And he and he stand there and he he puts that head up in the air. Oh boy. I knew what he was doing. He he got a scent of something, you know. And I got poor eyesight, but incredible, incredible scent. And he's waving that massive head back and forth like this, getting then he just went like this and just like burned two holes straight through those little bushes we were trying to hide behind. And I knew he knew exactly where we were. And we just sat there and he just took another moment and he just whirled like this and took off straight up this mountain. And this mountain was snowcapped. And he galloped. He galloped. And I was waiting for him to stop and have a rest. He galloped. He kept on galloping. Then he hit the he hit the glacier which was snow. And I saw these massive tracks in the glacier. We're looking at him through the glasses and he goes right up over the glacier and uh disappears over. It took between 12 I think 12 to 15 minutes and he was gone. Thought what an incredible creature this was. And so we we continued on that day when we got home that afternoon. So we tell brother Bud and brother Brandham, "Oh, we saw a big bear. You know, we're not thinking about vision. We're not trying to fulfill things and figure things out. They've just we're out hunting. You know, I got brother Brandham out there for a rest and I hope we're having a good time." And and uh so we told them about, you know, the day that we had had. And actually, if you ever come to my house, I'll show you the caribou I got that day. And then that night sometime, I don't know, we were sleeping, it it started to rain. And if you've ever been in the mountains and decides to rain and it we call it socked in. It just socked in. And we got up in the morning and it rained that day, rained that night, rained the second day, rained the second night, rained the third day, rained the third night, rained the fourth day, and after breakfast the fourth day, everything isn't wet. It's just sogging. You have to understand, we haven't seen a We haven't seen a ray of anything. just nothing but soaked in uh clouds hanging low and pouring rain most of the time. And uh that's what Bud says. He says kind of in mumbling to me. He said, "I think brother Brandham wants to go home." What? I turn. We're all in the tent. We've got cabin fever. They They're not hunters. Cabin fever is when you're all locked together f you know five persons in one tent for four days you get cabin fever. You know we just want to get out of here. We love each other but we we'd like to have a recess. And so I I go to I said brother Brham do you want to leave? You want to go home? Oh he said brother Eddie said we've had a wonderful time. I thought I just felt so discouraged, you know, we haven't even started. And and I said, ' But but you haven't even fired a shot. He says, "That means I can come back next year." I thought, "What a way of looking at things. That isn't the way I want to look at it. I want to go out there and, you know, whatever." And and so I just stood there. I thought and Bud starts packing things up into the paniards and they have to be even weight from one side to the other on the horse otherwise he goes lopsided and you have trouble. So he's starting to pack up and I am depressed. I am really depressed. I thought, you know, all the effort and all the time to come up here and all the preparation and and bud to take the best part of his season is worth a lot of money to him. I wasn't thinking of the money and I was just thinking we came up here to give brother Brandham a rest and we've somehow it hasn't happened. So you have to if you don't understand you please I'll try to dramatize this. Everything is so wet and cold and we're frozen and we're miserable and everything is wet. The ground is wet. The horses are wet. They're ornery. They hate to be packed. They don't want the cinches up tight on them and making them cuz they're wet and cold and they don't want the saddles on them and they just are, you know, everything's difficult. The tent weighs about three times its weight. And uh so I I think the tent we had down when we got the stuff out, we've got a stove, we've got everything to pack. All of our bed rolls have to be packed. And so I I'm standing outside and brother Brham, Brother Brham comes up and he says, "Brother Eddie," he said, "Where did you brother see that bear?" And I said, "Well, right up here. You just go up this valley here and that right this first hill, this little valley going in there. I said he was right in there. Oh, and and and I've seen brother Brandon this way more than once. You know, when he when something is very much on his mind, he and he kind of gets a little jerky with his movements. And so, uh, Bud, how long are we gonna be? You know, and I I think I asked Bud as well, you know, how long are we gonna be? You know, Brother Bud says, "Oh, you got lots of time, but we won't get out of here till maybe noon, you know, couple hours away." And so, Brother Brandon put his gun and then struck off right through the willows, the low willows like this. And away he was gone. And I had my horse now and had the horse saddled and tied up just to a twig here. and Bud and Blaine were were over about as far as that door is with the horse and they were starting to pack these paniards and you have to do it with a diamond hitch and it's a lot of uh I have never learned how to tie that hitch. So, they were busy doing that and getting all the horses packed and and uh I'm sitting on my horse now. I get on my horse. We got our rain gear. And you have to understand the woods and the willows and the trees, everything you touch is just laden with water. And even our rain gear wouldn't keep it all out. So I'm sitting on my horse maybe an hour, hour and a half, two hours later and uh brother Brandham comes out and he comes and stands right now. I'm I'm sharing with you now a personal conversation. And the reason why I haven't ever made it public is and I'm going to leave one line out because brother Brown was very private with me, very personal, but I'm going to give this to you. I'm sitting on the horse. He says, "Brother Eddie points up the sky, says this is on account of me." He said, And he made another little statement about disobeying the vision. He said, "It's the only time, the only time I know, this is the only the second time I know that I disobeyed a vision." He said, "The other time, you know," he says, "You know, in Africa and so on." And he was just going off and and about Africa and and the vision. And I I knew about something when the ministers pressed him, you know, and he he built he surrendered under the pressure of the ministers to do a certain thing and then suffered for for it. And so I'm not offering to say anything, you know, says that's only the second time I disobeyed a vision. He says, he says, he just went like this, but it's over and we'll ride out of here dry. That's the most incredible statement you could hear. We're just sogged wet. Horses are wet. Tent is wet. Everything is just completely soaked. And for a man to stand there and say, "We're right out of here dry. There's no break in the sky. The clouds are just heavy laden down. &gt;&gt; I didn't even know how to respond. &gt;&gt; And he goes about starts doing whatever maybe with his bag or whatever. And I'm just sitting there and uh I'm not thinking about the statement. I'm just discouraged that he hasn't got anything. And we're on our way out. And I'm I'm sitting and I remember like it was five minutes ago, not yesterday, like five minutes ago. And it wasn't it wasn't a wind, it wasn't a it wasn't a breeze. It was a puff of air, like air current and it went past me like that. And the only reason I remembered so well, it was so warm. &gt;&gt; I thought, "Boy, that was nice. just such a nice warm just a puff just a current of air. It maybe wouldn't have happened again, but then you know the air current just begin to move. move. There's air currents moving like that and pretty soon it turned into a little light breeze and and the willows which are just over where those doors are are shaking like this and the water's falling off of the leaves and bud keeps on uh getting the horses saddled up and and I I sit there and it's like five minutes ago I'm sitting there and the horse and I just thought this is you Oh, I like this air current. It's nice. It's the warmest air I've felt in the last several days. And out in out in front of me, probably where the boys and sister Darlene and you folks are right there. I'm sitting here like this. My horse is pointed this way. And I I look and there's a big patch of sunlight just shone down on the ground, like a great big round patch of sunlight. probably 30, 40 feet across, 50 feet across and and and I just instinctively I just went like this and it just a big hole. I just looking straight up a big hole through the clouds at a beautiful blue sky and I remember like I thought, boy, that looks good. I haven't seen that for days. That just looks so good. I wasn't thinking of any vision. I wasn't thinking of anything. I didn't dream I'd ever have to say it over a pulpit. And it was just my own personal experience that I've held 50 years. And uh while I'm sitting there just looking at that, the air just gets warm. Mo the current of air is moving now. It's into a breeze. Never gets into a wind. Just a wonderful breeze. And it just blowing around like that. in a patch of sunlight is before our horses took a step. The sky was I won't say cloudless, but you would say cloudless. Just totally blue sky. And I would say that happened in about 20 minutes. And the reason why I'm so moved, these poor people don't know and they should not have tampered with it. &gt;&gt; He was there. &gt;&gt; They've tampered with the prophet's life and they tampered with a vision that came past. He said passed through. Exactly. There we were, the three little fellows. There was the bear's massive bear. There was everything. And now we've had four days of storm and we have a a a man who under that inspiration says we'll ride out of here dry. I want to say to everyone who will ever hear this, if I rode out wet, I would not be here. &gt;&gt; That's just how much I believe it. If I rode out wet, I would not be here. I wouldn't be standing here telling you this. I rode out in my shirt sleeves. I had to take off the gear, take off my rain gear, and we rode out dry for eight hours. And that's my testimony and personal witness. And that's precisely what brother Brandham is referring to. And I conclude this. You say, why do you put this on the end of this? Because that is only one of perhaps many. If I wanted to raise questions, I could raise questions. It's up to God. &gt;&gt; The disciples minds and hearts were filled with all kinds of questions. I got questions about the resurrection. I don't know. I got questions about the earthquake. I don't know. But I can assure you one thing. what God has ordained and intended to happen is going to happen exactly according to his plan. And and and and I said to this pastor, I just said, and God bless him. I've contacted him since, but I just said to him, I said, I was there. I was in the storm. I heard what the prophet of God said. It has never even entered my mind that that had any effect upon him in his office. I I I respected him even more for saying, you know, this is on account of me. He didn't have to say that. We could have just gone out and rode out wet. We've done that lots of times. But when he said that and we wrote out absolutely dry and then and then and then I came across, he never told me to read this. I was reading the message one day and there I'm in September 1962. I said, "That's right after our hunt." Wow. There he refers right to it. And and I think that is so that just make fills my heart with such admiration. And so I want to say to you and all who care to listen to me, I just say we had thus sayeth the Lord &gt;&gt; and the vision passed through perfectly. He is a human. He is a man. And then someone will try to discredit and say, "Listen, I just want to say to you, we have Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, all not everything that those men did is written in the Bible. It's not everything they said is written in the Bible. It's that which God has ordained should be in the scriptures in the scripture." And we have had we have a word prophet. We have a living message. And there are just and I I'll conclude with this. If anyone ever wants to even even if the devil comes to your mind says, "Well, what about this or what about that?" Just say, "Well, I have one for you, Satan." Uh, you you come with the kind of the kind of and they call it a gift. That's not a gift of healing. That was that was God taking possession of the vessel, speaking directly to people, revealing the secret of their heart to prove to the whole world that he had an obedient messenger on the earth that he could control sufficiently so that he he he was he would have sufficient uh uh uh qualifications so that he could take and speak the opening of the seals, things that have been sealed since the foundation of the world, and speak it to us to a group of people that are believers &gt;&gt; and I believe it &gt;&gt; with all my heart. &gt;&gt; God bless you &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand with me? I hope that you've been able to receive this as not a sermon and not an ordinary service, but it'll it'll provide light and guidance for you in the coming days. Heavenly Father, I do not know exactly how to express myself to you and to the people that sat so attentively and how I was so directed and see this evolution of Lucifer. And we're down here to the last moments of time when uh the scripture, your scripture tells us that he comes down with great wrath because he knows his time is very short. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful that his time is short. &gt;&gt; We're giving you praise, Lord God, because you're in control of everything. &gt;&gt; Whether the things we see and understand or things we do not see and do not understand, we say you're God. You're the creator of heavens and earth and all things that are therein. You're eternal in your being. And we cannot even begin to grasp that. How your prophet said you'd be so mysterious for all these billions and trillions of years that you've existed. I cannot understand that. I couldn't even begin to try to explain that. But we believe it. And we believe that when we draw our last breath or when that sweep comes over us, just like that puff of warm air, that sweep will come over us and we'll be changing our atoms in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye. And as sure as the testimony which I just gave and the people believe it, Lord. And I certainly believe it cuz I lived it. Father, I want to give this testimony to you and I pray that you'll take the Holy Spirit and drive it as far as it needs to go and let it be received in every heart where it needs to be received. And Father, I pray that you will energize us to withstand the enemy and to stand firm and strong in this generation. I pray, Father, that people will receive this uh when we see such an invasion into the message. This is a message that's a call to arms. We resist the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you serpent, you have no power and you have no control and you have no part with us. We be the children of the day, the children of night, not the children of darkness, and the children of night. And in the name of Jesus, we claim glorious victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Oh, we praise your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name, I ask your blessing upon the people, Father. And as we prepare for the evening service and our brother Tom Ray comes to speak, I ask that you will anoint him mightily, oh God, and give us a refreshment this afternoon in Jesus Christ's name. And for your glory, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I wonder if we could sing victory in Jesus my savior forever. He bought me and he sought me. Come brother. Of course. in Jesus my savior forever and my redeeing love I do and all is to him the cleansing blood I heard all story How he gave the glory. How he gave his life on Calary to save like me. And I rolling my fresh and I Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] I heard about his mother to walk again and see Jesus come [Music] Somehow Jesus [Music] [Music] victory. Glory. &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing that chorus. I lift up your name. You know the risen lamb. I lift your name. Let's just end with a worship is one of my favorite courses of brother Hilderbrand led us in. I I got carried away with it at time. Just think Lord, I live your name. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] My heart [Music] is You're [Music] [Music] Just before we sing it one more time, I'm touched. I'm so touched when I sing those words, my comforter, my king. And if you're here this morning and you have a need, God knows exactly what that need is. And he wants to meet it. He paid too great a price &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; You're his and he wants to take you to his kingdom. He said, prophet said he only asked for one thing in all of the Bible. He asked for your fellowship. And I had a scripture in my service and I'll give it to you in last. Jesus in his prayer, he said to the father, "I've lost none." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that you've given me, I lost none. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Except the son of predition. It's the only one he lost. And he didn't lose him. He was ordained to that. Listen, friends. Please hear me. I didn't this service I've toiled over it for two solid weeks. You can ask my wife. I've been locked into my study. I was just nervous and I couldn't wait to release myself from it. But I want to say to you, this to me is a milestone message. And don't forget the evolution of Lucifer. And I I don't mean to put any damper on the service. But if he came to the supper table of our Lord Jesus Christ, if he stood at the right hand of Almighty God and watched creation take place, he's not afraid of these doors. &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of the doors of your house. He's not afraid of sitting at with you at the table and looking across the table. I'm not talking about people looking across the table. I'm talking about his presence right there. And when you ever sense or feel and sense that presence and have you sensed him drawing you away and making something glamorous of this world and drawing you away to that, you deny him. He's not worth it in the name of Jesus Christ. He's not worth it. &gt;&gt; He's a serpent. He's a diver trying to entice people away. He'll get into everything. And our prophet was absolutely truthful when he said he's in he's a god of the denomination. He's a god of all politics. He has every kingdom in his hand. He showed them to your Lord and Savior me when he stood eye to eye face to face with him. He's not ashamed of it. And it's up to you. That's why you've been equipped so completely and you want to stand up and aggressively say you have no part with me. &gt;&gt; I I'll hear none of that &gt;&gt; because the moment you receive it, there's an agenda behind that. Don't you hear it? You say, "My ears are stopped to that." Say, "Amen, friends." [Music] Make sure that you take it as a real solid warning and teaching and caution today. We have studied his movements. &gt;&gt; We've studied how he handles things. We study his his his kind of conversation and how he comes so subtle. Next thing you find out, he's your adversary. Next thing you find out, he's saying all kinds of slanderous things and even causing you to feel slanderous about yourself. That's the enemy. &gt;&gt; What he's done is neutralized you. &gt;&gt; We're not here. And the and the prophet speaks about him paralyzing our faith. I'm standing here as an old warrior. I'm not going to allow him to paralyze my faith. And I'll do everything in my power to see it doesn't paralyze yours. &gt;&gt; And there isn't a soul here I don't want to see. Come with us. Come with me to my father's house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Edwin. Brother Edwin's rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. We're going to sit across the table from one another, brother Edward. Glory to God. And rejoice through all eternity. &gt;&gt; Isn't it blessed, friends? Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Amen. Just notice Matthew and Sonda Adele's son there. Stand there. Heard about you being baptized. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Take up the soldier. Take up the war swore sword and take up the battle. Hallelujah. We need some young men. Are you young men ready for it? Good. See, I said good before you said amen. Hallelujah. Let's just sing it one more time. Brother Tim, if you would close in prayer. [Music] Yeah. [Music] [Music] The am [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say one thing before we bow our heads in a word of prayer. I wasn't thinking of it till I just stepped up to the pulpit. Brother Ed said that he had only mentioned this to a handful of people over the years and I realized as I was sitting there I was one of the handful and I didn't know why. Many years ago, I heard that testimony and then as I was in Switzerland, Brother Ed told it to me again. And then I heard it tonight the third or today the third time. And I'll just say it was exactly the same every time. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that God has witnesses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believers don't need uh some kind of assurance to believe. &gt;&gt; But what we got this morning was another weapon in our hands &gt;&gt; to use against the enemy. &gt;&gt; Let's just thank God for it this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful &gt;&gt; for all of the gifts that you have put in the body. &gt;&gt; Your body, Lord, that you have redeemed by your own blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have not forsaken us, Lord. &gt;&gt; You have given us all things that is necessary. &gt;&gt; And Lord, this morning, you have anointed your servant to speak some things. And we saw, Lord, with our own eyes how much these meant to our dear brother Ed, Lord. And Lord, these are things that he has held in his heart for years. And Lord, that you have given him personally. And now you have led him to share them not just with the body locally here but out over the internet and all of those that will watch the service in the days to come just to let them know Lord that these things are true. &gt;&gt; They are yay and amen. And Lord you didn't owe us these things but Lord in your grace you have provided us these things. And so we pray that you will just take this service and that Lord, you will send a special anointing upon it as everyone would listen to it in the days ahead. And Lord, may the anointing that is present here in our midst this morning, Lord, may you just take it and deliver your children from every snare, every trap, every onslaught of the enemy, every reasoning idea that the enemy would try to bring against your children. In the name of Jesus Christ, we claim the victory this morning and we accept it for the glory of the kingdom of God. Bless brother Bisll. We saw how much he was moved this morning. Strengthen him. And Lord, may your peace rest upon him, Lord. We just ask your blessing to go with each one now. Bless the afternoon and we look forward to hearing from you again this evening. We ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Become prepared for the service tonight. The service is dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] together. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Lord Jesus [Music] Let me just [Music]
