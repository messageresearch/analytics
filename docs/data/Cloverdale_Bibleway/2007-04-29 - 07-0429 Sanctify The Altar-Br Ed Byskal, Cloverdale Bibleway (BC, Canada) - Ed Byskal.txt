And I was just thinking about about the school that we have and I was thinking about the families, you know, you look around at at the kids and and all that they have. I said, "Well, you know, if if you're looking for how to how a family should be, you wouldn't have to look much farther than than the families that that are are represented here." And I appreciate that. And I think that's just a testimony to the Lord. I think Sister Sharon and some sisters have a song if they could come right away and uh sing for us as well.

Come and dwell this morning. Come and possess me. Take up this take up your abode in this temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your house. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about this structure. Talking about this one right here. Let us just dedicate it holy to the Lord as we sing it once again. [Music] This is your house. [Music] This is your house. It's a holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens. This is your house. This is your heart. Come and dwell. With those words on our lips, let's just bow our hearts in prayer once again. Oh father, we are so grateful for the prayers that we've heard, for the songs that we have sung, to be able to view the children, oh God, from the school. What a beautiful bouquet of flowers this appears to us, Lord, because you're the one that has you're the one that has caused them to blossom into these lovely lives. And I pray that they will grow and mature, oh God, and they will continue with that song in their hearts. Everybody ought to know who Jesus is. And as our sisters sang, we've come to worship you, Lord, and that in truth is what is in our hearts. We're here today to thank you for the moving of your Holy Spirit amongst us. We are here to thank you, oh God, for the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in our lives and for what you are doing and what you will do even today and what you will continue to do. We thank you, Father, from the depths of our hearts. And now we just come to present ourselves. We pray that you'll lead us on this pathway on the footsteps that we must make today. I ask that you will anoint oh God speaker and the hearers in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. My we had a glorious time on Wednesday. Actually the glory fell long after the service preaching was over and I uh I left about 10:30 and was just driving along actually when I next looked at my watch it was4 to 11 and then I get a phone call just coming on to midnight and uh Linda said I've just left the church and there's still young men in there and some people in there and said they just got lost in God. &gt;&gt; Well, I actually I thought I was going to maybe even get one or two of them to testify this morning, but uh we'll maybe just save that for another time because I'm short on time. But uh I tell you what, I am indebted to our heavenly father &gt;&gt; because without him, we're this is just a wasted exercise. &gt;&gt; But with him, &gt;&gt; it means everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, aren't we thankful? &gt;&gt; Oh my. I say, pour it on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Pour it on. We're ready to throw the clock away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're ready to throw all everything else away. Just give us God's program. That's all we want. As I had prayed last Wednesday, I said, "Lord, we've heard all kinds of preaching. I don't want to get up there and preach. We want God to come in behind and do it. do what we can't do. See, we can say it, but he's the one that has to do it. &gt;&gt; I want him to do it. Don't you? &gt;&gt; If a person was sick here, they don't need a big dialogue or discourse on healing and sickness. They need someone to come and do the healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone bound. &gt;&gt; We want them to be free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Of course we do. Tomorrow night is uh tomorrow night and Tuesday we're having a service with Rabbi Richmond. Rabbi Richmond will be here to talk to us and to speak with us. And I always use these occasions of his visit to see have a a special window for he will see Israel and what is taking place in a much clearer and from a very very much different vantage point than we have. And so we'll not be having a service as we're having this service. We'll just be opening it. And we want to give him all the time. It's come a long ways. actually came right from Israel here directly arriving just after service this morning. We'll be picking him up. He's u he's uh his wife is with him, Reena. And uh I would like to just uh caution our sisters if you would be very very mindful uh because here it is our custom we thrust out our hand to shake hands and it puts him in a very awkward position because uh he doesn't practice shaking hands with sisters or with the women. So if you just be mindful of that please if you are meeting him. So don't put them in that awkward position. But it'll be 7:30 tomorrow night and Tuesday night and thus no service on Wednesday night. So tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday and nothing on no service on Wednesday. Amen. Would you like to take your Bibles now and turn to John's Gospel the 17th chapter? The only place in the Bible where this prayer of our Lord Jesus is recorded, John, eagle spirit. When I uh think of that, I just marvel how God had John pick that up. And the other gospel writers, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, do not record the prayer of Jesus. But oh, how glad I am that it's there. John 13 was not recorded. The footwashing. John 15, I'm the true vine was only recorded by John. Many of them, many of the things that John picked up were not recorded by the other writers, but God ordained that they would pick up just exactly what they were to pick up and to write. We're starting at the 14th verse of John 14. I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. And I would like you to notice the 17th verse. Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. I have a few verses I would like to read out of the book of Joshua in the third chapter of Joshua. Moses uh God told Joshua, "Moses, my servant is dead and uh you go and take this people over into the promised land and cross Jordan." In the third chapter, and we'll read from verses 1 to5. And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and they removed from Shatim and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. And it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant," or that's the word of God, "when you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests, the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place," and I love these words, "and go after it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And go after it. When you see the word moving &gt;&gt; and you see the Levites and the priests carrying it and you see it advancing, you can't sit where you are. Go after it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse four. Yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure. Come not near unto it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way hitherto. For verse five, and Joshua said unto the people, sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you. God bless you as you have your seats. And Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders." And to sanctify is simply to set yourself aside or set something apart. If something sanctified to God, that means that it is set apart. It is sanctified. It is made sacred. it has a special consideration. Uh and and and I think that I would like to say that we have a realization that this has a special purpose. This object or this thing has a special purpose. We should focus on it. Say this has a special purpose. I set it aside. I sanctify it for God's purpose, for God's use. And the thing that I am having you focus on with me as we did on Wednesday is your heart which the prophet said is God's altar. And every person in the under the sound of my voice has that altar. You do not have to look to the platform and say, "Well, there's the pastor speaking and you know he's a he's got the focal point." No. Every person is a focal point because you have an altar. You have a heart. And I want to speak on this subject. Sanctify the altar. Set aside the heart. The altar. Because because we haven't gone this way before. We're sitting here in expectation of a rapture season, a time we have received the already the sign of the resurrection. We've received the messenger, a forerunner of the resurrection. We know that that's the we're we know we're in the process of the coming of the Lord. I believe it is a time to set ourselves aside, to set our hearts and to identify and say, "If there ever was a time in our lives, if there ever was a time that we ought to examine our heart, I'm not talking about in some critical condemn condemning way, but I'm I'm speaking about we we that we sanctify the heart and look upon it and say, "What what is there? What ought to be there? What ought what I ought to be occupied with and in my heart? And that's my uh service this morning. I'm going to give a summary and then take that summary in part through the service. The altar is our heart. Number two, it needs to be sanctified and set apart. Our hearts are dreadfully encumbered in this day, especially at certain times. There are certain season, and if there ever was a season when we ought to set ourselves aside, it's this season. It's not enough to talk about the rapture. It's not enough to talk about the second coming of Jesus Christ, but it's a time to be set aside. Have your heart set aside for it. Especially in this day, especially in this time when there is so much to distract the individual. There's so much out there to occupy your heart. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me? &gt;&gt; There's so much And when I think of that, I just wrote down divide and conquer. And it's a phrase that we're all familiar with. But when there's so much out there, I mean, Satan in this Satan's Eden has put so much out there, so much to distract and to occupy a person and to to get it on your heart to do certain things or to achieve certain things. and it becomes the allconsuming thing then I think that the purpose his purpose is to divide and conquer to try try to take control. The altar is made for sacrifice. Just want to make that statement. And next sacrifice speaks of the shedding of blood, something dying. Sacrifice. There may be other things offered on the altar because if we looked at the Old Testament, you'd find that as I mentioned Wednesday, there was peace offerings and burnt offerings and offerings of incense and and all kinds of things that were being offered. But essentially and basically the altar was made for a sacrifice that would be acceptable to God. And that in that sacrifice and I want you to I want you to get this because it's a it's a all-encompassing statement. The very concept of a sacrifice being made behind that concept was the fact that the the offerer, the one that was making the offering would come into reconciliation with God. The very purpose that the offering was being made, the very the very reason that there was a need for an offering indicated that there was a separation that and this act was being done to bring a reconciliation between God and the one that was making the offering. So with that I want to commence the uh the subject. The Lord said to Moses because we have the Lord said unto Moses, go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes. So there was something that they they had to do which was a physical act so that they would know that they were being set aside. In the message I've heard but now I see and I'm still just wanting to lay a little bit of a foundation here for another moment or two. Brother Brandham asked a question. In the message I've heard but now I see. I wonder if we've done everything that God requires us to do. Have we followed every iota of the scripture? He has to I've underlined this. Have we given him our hearts and lives to service? I think those are good and legitimate questions. What's the reason that you want to be healed? He asked a question. What's the reason? He's speaking to a lot of people want to be healed. What's the reason that you want to be healed? He said, "That's the reason you can't get faith enough is because you haven't maybe made this thing this thing to God sincerely from your heart." And he mentions then Hezekiah the king that was told by the prophet Isaiah that he was going to die and he put his face to the wall and asked for 15 more years because he said he needed to set things in order. and God granted him 15 more years of time. When we think of the altar, there's a scripture that I want to read and it's out of Exodus 40:10. You don't need to turn to it. I just like to read it. And God speaking then now, and there's several things in this verse I want you to make special note of. And you shall anoint the altar. And you remember I've been speaking now a couple of services on the anointing about three. And that when we talk about anointing, I'm saying that for those that may be here for the first time or just visiting, when we talk about anointing, it is a process. It's a It's something that um uh there's a sequence of events all through the scripture, but it just started out with Jacob anointing the stone that he laid his head on and dreamed of angels on a ladder. They call it Jacob's ladder. It wasn't Jacob's ladder. He dreamed about it. And there was angels going descending and ascending. And he and he poured oil upon that and anointed that stone for because of the experience that he had. And so the anointing that was the first initial thought that was introduced in the Bible. But by the time you get through the scripture when you come to the end, you'll find out that that only was indicative of something being poured out. Being poured out and something transferred being transferred. And so the anointing, the anointing is that something from God himself is being transferred to the individual, something that's being poured out into you. And then brother Brandon comes along saying that all that was in God, he poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ, he poured into the church, into his body. And and so so now when God says to Moses, he said, "And you shall anoint the altar," something is to be poured out upon the altar because it's being sanctified. He said, "Be and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels and sanctify the altar." You'll anoint the altar and you'll sanctify the altar. what he's saying now, and if we take it in the prophet's language, you will you'll pour out onto the altar. You'll transfer onto the altar to indicate that the altar is being set aside for a special purpose. This just isn't for anything. Somebody's got an idea. Oh, I want to offer this or I like to do that or I This wasn't everybody's idea. This was God's idea. And you will anoint the altar your heart and you will anoint how how can your heart be anointed? Because God must transfer to your heart. He anoints your heart to sanctify it and set it aside for his own exclusive purpose. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what he's referring to here. and you'll sanctify the altar and it shall be an altar most holy. That's exactly God's purpose, friends, to set our hearts aside. It'll be most holy set aside for himself. Amen. Solomon who was a very wise man uh he got in trouble by a lot of wives which he had but he said some very wise things that are the scripture and the word of God is perfect. He said my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways. Now brother Brandham said several times Satan he takes the head. He always appeals to the head, appeals to the reasoning, but God takes the heart. When Satan used the serpent in in Eden, he came and he began to reason with her. But when God comes to a person, he comes and he said, "God wants to lead man." So he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart. God wants to lead you. And so he's made a little control tower. And it's not in your head, it's in your heart. So it isn't how you weigh things out, how you reason things out, how you check it out, but it's in your heart. You'll have a witness inside. &gt;&gt; You believe in that? &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, and I'm just being as brief as I can because I want to make uh quite a distance this morning. Lord willing. He said that is the great fight tonight. Satan took the eye a man's head to control him by his head and God took his heart. He said he took his eye. He said to Eve right away, you know, and the Bible says that she looked and she saw. You know, we look and we see things and we perceive things by what we see and then we, you know, put it through our thought process. Don't trust that. &gt;&gt; Trust what your heart is saying. &gt;&gt; And in a in atmosphere, when you come into the atmosphere, especially coming into the into a place of worship such as we are this morning, we sing the songs of Zion and hear the prayers that are prayed. There's a certain atmosphere and the angels of God love this atmosphere. They are dispatched. Whether you believe it or not, that won't change the fact. They're dispatched. The angels, your angel is here. The Holy Spirit is here. And they're dispatched. The prophet says to energize your faith because God wants to do something for it. But it can't come there just a mental ascent. It's got to be something else. It's got to be a spiritual witness that's down within an individual's heart. He went on to say in looking at the unseen, man's always trying to achieve something by his head. He's supposed to achieve, but he's supposed to achieve. You're supposed to make achievement, but it's by your heart. He said that's the control tower where God controls him and directs his thoughts. The control tower from the inside from the inside of the inside. And he wants to direct his thoughts and direct his walks and direct his emotions. God wants to direct your direction. He wants to direct your thoughts, your emotion, your feelings, everything by the inner witness inside the heart. &gt;&gt; He says, "Sometimes I get so happy I just have to let it loose." &gt;&gt; He says, "And if I look around and see somebody, then see I got my eyes on people." Then maybe you ought to just kind of forget who's around you today and let it loose. If that restricted him, I'm sure it restricts us. We look around say, "Oh, I don't know if this is just exactly right." I'm glad that the some of our young men here on Wednesday night kind of forgot. They let it loose. They forgot who was around them. And that's a kind of formality that we don't need. We don't need what's around us or what our eyes declare. We need what? The witness. What is it in your heart? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And after I get preaching a little while, I'll forget what I'm seeing. As I've said many times, and especially in special meetings, I've got I haven't got great eyesight for distance. If I take my glasses off, it's kind of a blur out there. And so I've told people when you see me take my glasses off, it's because I don't want to really study the faces of the people. I want to be able to concentrate on the witness that's inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. the control tower of the soul and one for the body. He said many times these war one against the other. The control tower, you know when you're thirsty, you know when you're hungry, you know when you're not feeling well because you have a control tower that tells you that. But there's one in the soul, a control tower. Said there's a control tower of the soul and one for the body. said, "The flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul." Many times these war one against another. And if there's any conflict this morning, I declare in the name of Jesus Christ, let the desire of the soul win out. &gt;&gt; Let the desire of the soul conquer any other desire that we might have. And the people can say &gt;&gt; he said we find there's a great trouble today that too many people try to live between these two desires. &gt;&gt; Try to live between you cannot live between those two desires. We have to be given over to one or the other. And so let's be given over to the desires of the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; For one of them desires the earth and the other one desires the things of heaven. &gt;&gt; Where's your strong desire this morning? David, he expresses the total unity of the outer and the inner man. When he said, "My soul longeth." Now, in these next scriptures and so on, I want to focus on the heart because that's the altar. My soul longeth, yay, even faintth for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh. So he had un he had a clear understanding that his his heart was more than his flesh, more than just a muscle beating in his chest. And my heart and my flesh crith out for the living God. As I said on Wednesday, believe it or not, I'm still just laying foundation. said on Wednesday, the heart, the Hebrew understanding for the heart was the inner man. The mind, the will, the understanding, the knowledge, the thinking, the reflection, these all are in the context of the heart. What you're inclined to do, how you're inclined to think of things, your resolve, I'm determined. The Hebrew understood that was in your heart. It's not something you just saw in your mind and said, "I'm going to make that decision." But it's something deeper. And that's exactly what the prophet says. It's in your heart. Then it comes to your mind. You're you're being motivated. You make decisions, but it's an it's an inner witness. The really the re real aspect of the heart. And the heart is the place of the moral character. You don't think about being moral. It's something that's in you, an inner witness within. It's the seat of your appetites, the seat of emotion, emotions in your passions, and your desire. And it's also the seat of your courage. You don't say with your head, I'm going to do it. But there's something within you. Even when your head says, "This might be dangerous, but something inside, I'm going to do it." I had a brother came to the message years ago, and he was an alcoholic, and he had been a good Catholic man, and he gave himself, he even went way down into Borneo. And some of you know who I'm speaking about. He's gone on to be with the Lord now. But he went to Borneo on a missionary ship in uh in uh for the Catholic church because he was doing everything to give himself to give himself to try to separate himself from this terrible alcoholism. And he came in contact with the message. His brother told him, "You need to go over and and hear hear these people." And he came in, he told me with his own lips, he says, "My mind, my thoughts could find all kinds of argument and things to counteract what I was hearing in the message." But he said, "I knew there was just something I knew this was my last chance." &gt;&gt; He surrendered himself to God. He came and he gave himself so unreservedly. He lived as a wonderful believer. This message just illuminated him and he came into such a joy and a liberty that he was free from his alcoholism. He called his mother right away who lives on Vancouver Island. Called her said, "I I'm delivered of my alcoholism." She said, "Call me in six months." And then he just went down into the pits and he came and he said, "Brother Ed, what do I do?" He said, "Tried to tell him what happened and they told me to come back and call her in six months. what should I do? I said, call her in 6 months. &gt;&gt; I didn't have any I didn't have any worry there wasn't going to hang in there. I didn't have any worry. 6 months came by. I said, I called her. She still doesn't believe it. I said, call her in a year. &gt;&gt; So, he waited till the year was over. Hi, Mom. Still hanging in there. I'm totally free. &gt;&gt; He lived totally free to his last day and went across in victory. Amen. That's exactly the God I'm It's an inner witness. But his mind was saying, there's all kinds of all kinds of things here you can argue with, all kinds of things here you can find fault with in this message. But he said, "My heart was saying, yay." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it's been with so many of you? There's so many things, so many doubts and and and questions and fears and things that come into the mind. But the altar where God was dealing with the altar, the altar was saying, "Yes, yes, it's true. It's true." Something inside. That's what you want to listen to. &gt;&gt; Like Charles Wesley father, Charles Wesley's father on his dying bed, uh, when he was dying and and Wesley, Charles Wesley came to him and I think it was his last words to his son. He said, "It's the inner witness, son. the inner witness. &gt;&gt; I'll say it today, it's the inner witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now the the Greeks picked up in the New Testament, and I won't labor on this at all, but they also had much the same thought, only the Greeks, you know, they sought after wisdom. And so uh uh they put a lot of emphasis on the fact that the the heart was a part of our organ system and part of the blood circulatory system. But yet they they felt it was the center and seat of spiritual life. And that it is. Now, I want to take a few scriptures uh concerning the heart because I I I have something that I want to bring to you very urgently this morning. The heart possesses enormous capacity for both good and evil. We hear some uh atrocities that take place and then it gets up into the courts and we find defense attorneys often saying it was, you know, it was just a momentary insanity. I have a problem with that because I often wonder why doesn't somebody even on the law of averages do something fantastically good out of a momentary insanity? &gt;&gt; Why doesn't somebody, you know, totally give away all their inheritance or just do something fantastically marvelous and good? say, "Well, you know, they had a momentary insanity." See, Sister Lynn Franco smiling. I think she she worked along these lines in an attorney's office for years and I don't think she ever encountered anybody doing something just radically almost insanely good because they just lost their but when they do something disastrous and murder somebody or do some disastrous thing oh they just were temporarily insane. Well, the heart possesses this a capacity for both good and evil. And however, the heart was made, God actually, this heart that I'm talking about, not the physical muscle of our heart, but the heart that I'm talking about has been made for a very special purpose. It is in this part, this altar, sacred altar where God meets you. And that makes it a very special place within a person. That's where God meets you. And here God meets you personally. And here God unites himself with you. But I want to say very quickly, not without blood. And that will probably pose a big question in your mind right now. And this is where I want to I've set all of that foundation to come right now and probably bring some question to your mind. The heart can know despair, grief, it can be broken. These are all scriptures. I don't have time to give you the scripture. The heart can be bowed down, can no bitterness, it can be filled with anger. The heart today experiences in our day because the scripture prophesies it many many fears. It is particularly subject to fear. The heart is subject to fear. People fear the future. They fear what's going to happen to their family. They fear their physical well-being. They fear what's going to be for their retirement. They fear the economy and we have many many fears in Deuteronomy. Uh God speaking and Moses writes in the morning thou shalt say would to God it was even or evening and at evening thou shalt say would God it were morning. for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. God was saying to the people because you've chosen this and because you're going this direction, I'm going to you're going to come to a time when fear will grip you. And in the morning, you'll say, "I wish it was evening so I could go to bed and forget this." And in the evening, you'll say, "I wish it was morning." And Jesus said, "Men's heart failing them for fear and looking once again with the eyes, looking after those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heaven shall be shaken." In 1 John 4:18, John writes, "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that fearth is not made perfect in love." Fear hath torment. And I would say, I don't think there's anybody here. But what doesn't experience fear from time to time? I'm not talking about, you know, just scared for the moment or but there's a lot of fear. Fear is not sin. Jesus didn't say and the Bible doesn't say that fear is sin. It's not sin that's on the altar of the heart. But when fear is there, faith can't be there. &gt;&gt; And so now uh uh that fear has to be removed. And after Wednesday service, I spoke to three or four people right on that very subject. It's not that fear person fears something. It's not that that fear is sin, but that fear keeps faith away because you can't have fear and faith at the same time. And so that needs to be burned up on the altar so that faith can come and then through the faith you have faith in the promise and you can receive the answer. I just said that I'm I'm going to go on from there. This is why in the Bible and I'm going quickly. Don't try to turn to these scriptures. Matthew 10:28, "And fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul." Matthew 28:5, "Fear not, fear not ye, for I know that you seek Jesus which was which was crucified." Luke 1:13, "Fear not, Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard." Luke 1:30, "And the angel said,"Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God." Luke 2 and10, "Fear not, behold, I bring you tidings of good joy." Luke 8:50, "Fear not, behold. Believe only, and she shall be made whole." Luke 12:7, "Fear not, thou therefore, ye are more value than many sparrows." Acts 27 and 24 saying, "Fear not, Paul. Thou must be brought before Caesar." Why are these introductions always, "Fear not. Fear not." Brother Brandham said, "Exactly." He said whenever I hear that voice it always comes says fear not fear not I'll be with you. Why? Because the heart is very susceptible to all kinds of fears and anxieties and questions. And the Lord would say today to this congregation, fear not. &gt;&gt; I've come. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; I'm here. &gt;&gt; Fear not. We don't need to be dictated to by the the the society and the civilization that we presently live in. We have a God who's in control. A God who's in charge of every situation. Things may be going sideways. You may say, "Oh, Brother Ed, but you don't know where I'm at." I really don't care where you're at right now because my focus is on God who's in charge of absolutely everything. There isn't anything that he cannot do. Hallelujah. And if you fear then the thing that fear you fear so much can come upon you or does come upon us. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 11:17, when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me his first words to John in the revelation, fear not. I'm the first and the last. Hallelujah. If you hear a voice and had a personal visitation and feel a hand laid upon you and hear a voice saying, "Fear not. I'm the first and the last." That means he's also everything in between. I'm the first and I'm the last and I'm everything in between. He's the first of your experience. He's the last of your experience. And he's everything in between. Hallelujah. He knows right where you are now. He knows right where you are in your journey. He knows exactly the footstep you're standing in now. And he's in control of it because he's the first and the last. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fear not. And last but not least, fear not little flock. &gt;&gt; It's the father's good pleasure &gt;&gt; to give you the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Are those sweet words? &gt;&gt; Fear not, little flock. It's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Fear not, brother Ben Brandham says, "And believe ye that I can do this." Fear not. Do not fear. Don't fear. Don't do that. If you do, then God can't work with you. If you do believe, then God can work with you. If you fear, God can't work with you. If you believe, God can work with you. It's just that simple. A person's heart can be deeply stirred. Psalm the David, David the Psalmist said, "My heart was hot within me. While I was musing, the fire burned. Then spake I with my tongue. Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure of my days. What it is that I may know how frail I am." David said again where we have the chorus, create in me a clean heart, oh God. Perhaps you don't recall the scripture because we sing it too glibly. Next time you sing it, you should think about really what it is saying. Create in me a clean heart. May my altar be clean, oh God, and renew, restore. The same word, renew here is exactly the same word in Malachi 5 and6. And he shall turn the heart of the children back to the fathers. Renew, restore, refresh, renew the right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me. restore the same word once again to turn back. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit. And then a very important word, then then will I teach transgressors their ways. &gt;&gt; Not when we're all nervous and agitated or anything else or we're, you know, I I've got to get this message to them. I've got to tell them. I've got to, you know, pronounce uh their their what it is that they believe and what the error of their way. No. Create in me a clean heart. &gt;&gt; Restore my spirit. Renew in me a right spirit and then I'll teach transgressors their ways. There's probably, I think, about 2,000 times where the prophet of God said, "Believe with all your heart." All your heart. And all simply is the entire substance. Believe with all your heart. You know, friends, you're listening very nicely, but I say if this congregation here today could just move everything else out of the way and begin believing even the simplest word, the simplest promise with all your heart and move everything else. Say, "Oh, fire of God, just annihilate. Burn up every other thing that's on my heart, everything that's removed, and let me just believe with all my heart. Let me be consumed with belief. Let me be consumed with faith. Let it be on my heart that all I can do. I can't even think of anything else but believing the promise. Believing the promise. &gt;&gt; The promise of today. The promise of this hour. Not necessarily my personal need. But may I believe with all my heart. And may my heart simply be filled with faith. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't even be have to be prayed for. It wouldn't even be that you'd need hands pray later on. You wouldn't need you wouldn't need anything. You'll just begin receiving things right where you're at because there'll be such a such a a an atmosphere of faith. I believe if the prophet was standing here and say this, the whole room has become milky because people begin to see God is doing things. God is present doing things. &gt;&gt; Is God bigger than your problem? &gt;&gt; Is God bigger than your concern? &gt;&gt; Is God bigger than the thing that's occupied your heart and your altar? Hallelujah. Has God proven himself before? That same God is here presently now and will do for you what needs to be done. We need to say, "Thy will be done." Not my will, thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The entire substance, all your heart, the utmost possible, the entire complete. That's what all is. In the message of the resurrection, he says, "I believe that God would save every sinner, fill every saint, and fix fix us up for the rapture. I believe that, too. Believest thou this. I believe that God would save every sinner." If there's an unbeliever here, I believe that God would save you. &gt;&gt; If you just believe it now, &gt;&gt; believe what? I was born in sin, shaped iniquities. I came into the world condemned, but Jesus Christ died on Calvary, and I accept I accept that sacrifice for myself. You'll be saved. &gt;&gt; Are you here? You're bound. Are you here? bound by habit, bound by fear, bound by something. That same God will not not tomorrow, not some big process would deliver you right now. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to bring people to the point. He's a God that does things. &gt;&gt; You see, if you only get it mentally, God doesn't get any glory out of that. &gt;&gt; But when you get it in your heart and faith is there and then God can answer to that faith, then he's he's able to do it &gt;&gt; and then his name is glorified and that's what God wants. He wants to be glorified &gt;&gt; by what happens after the resurrection of Jesus and the two on the way to Emmas and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked to us in the I'm not interested in a fancy service or fancy message. I'm especially gripped. I'm consumed. If you ask what's on my altar today, I say, "Oh, God, I'm I'm clinging to your promise that whatsoever things we desire when we pray, we believe and you'll do it. I have already prayed. I prayed earnestly, God. May your presence come so amongst the people. And may the supernatural just begin to take place as the word is preached. May the Holy Spirit take that word and anchor it right into your heart so that everything else moves out of the way. And the only thing that's on your heart is the promise of God. And I believe this promise. All things are possible. He said, did he not say it? All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. only believe. Believe with all your heart entirely allconsuming faith &gt;&gt; and then God comes on the scene. God begins to do it. You have to also believe that God's waiting to do it. God's standing ready to do it. &gt;&gt; And I would feel it would be such an insult to walk in with your burden and walk out with that burden when God stands here already. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll give him praise. &gt;&gt; His spirit is here. His word is here. His servants are here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did not our heart burn within us as he spoke to us in the way. And brother Brandham made makes reference to that in modern events. One of the last services he only had a few days that he remained here after that. And he said they said no wonder. And he said no wonder their hearts burned. The prophecies that were that he was giving that was fulfilled. The prophecies that he was giving them speaking of himself out of the scripture they were they had been fulfilled. And that's what made their hearts burn. And my brothers and sisters here today, you don't always know what it is that's causing your heart to burn, to be a stirring deep within you. You may not always know what that is because we're maybe too focused on our little world. But what is causing your heart to burn is because the scriptures, the promises for this day are being fulfilled. Even when we're not aware of it, &gt;&gt; they're being fulfilled. And the Holy Spirit is causing your heart to burn. &gt;&gt; We may not be aware of it. You may not know it at all, but that's what's doing it. Their hearts burned within them as he talked with them in the way. Now the rest of the service I want to come to this altar and a very very significant thing and you'll need to loose your minds and your thoughts and I trust that there'll be no restriction there. When we hear the term altar we immediately think of sacrifice. We connect it to sacrifice. And we cannot say sacrifice without envisioning something being offered, something being given. Something has got to be given. When we think of sacrifice and the first instance of a sacrifice ever being given was God himself when his son Adam and his wife Eve were found fallen and naked. It's curious. Their fig leaves were not good enough, not sufficient. But it's very curious that it took blood to be shed. That God, the creator, who actually created the creature, would now destroy the creature just to accommodate the covering for Adam and Eve. So there's something here right away. Something here that needs to be addressed very deeply that God out of his mind now is unfolding in the creation and blood has been spilled. God himself allowed blood to be spilled on the earth just to get some skins to cover a fallen son and his wife. Brother Brandham describes almost in poetic language them being expelled expelled out of Eve, out of Eden. He said they're walking and the skins are slapping against Adam's manly legs and running down Eve's bosom. and she leans her head over onto his shoulder as they walk out in this most sad moment and said tears start tears. They haven't known what tears are. They've never been sad. Their heart has never been affected like that. But tears start coming down Eve's face and brother Brenham just says so marvelously they can cry now that's such a profound thing that God had shed some blood to make this possible and then as we move from that scene two sons are born twins Cain the eldest in Abel. And I read it out of the Hebrew Bible. And brother Brandham says so plainly, she didn't conceive again. She bore again in Genesis 4 and2. And Adam knew his wife. Genesis 4:1. And Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bare a son called his name Cain. For I've received a man from the Lord. And of course she got it from the Lord. It wouldn't it wouldn't matter who gives birth. Whether it be a prostitute or whether it be an illegitimate child or what it is, God gave life. God gave the child life. And again, and it says, "And she again bore." And the Hebrew says she continued to bear Abel. Abel was a keeper of the flock and Cain was a tiller of the ground. And if we hadn't if we didn't have the message, we wouldn't understand it like this. But now I'm tying it. I'm just sewing it completely with the message. Says Abel had a revelation that it was blood. How did Abel even know that there was blood in that animal? And how did he know? or how was he even inclined that that somehow should be on an altar? Now, the Bible doesn't say that Abel built an altar or and Cain built an altar, but it says that they both brought their their sacrifice to God. And brother Brandham said they both built an altar and they both worshiped. They paid their tithes. In other words, they were giving of their of their material possessions. and Cain and brought his the fruit of his field and Abel and that was the only difference between the two. Abel had a revelation. Now I want you to catch this. The revelation he had was he was now going to present something on earth that was going to reflect something that was in heaven. Now, just be real still. In heaven, there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. But I guarantee you, it was not a chemistry of blood. Not the chemistry of blood that was flowing in that animal or even flowing in Abel's veins or yours this morning. But in the in the mind of God and what form that took, I do not know. But I am saying I do not believe that it was blood in the sense of the blood that's in your veins. It just says he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and that was a heavenly scene. How God projected that in heaven, I do not know. And it might have been there for hundreds of millions of years. Or when God thought that thought, when God established that that there was a a lamb slain, a lamb slain in heaven before the foundation of the world. And now walks a little man creeping on the earth. His name is Abel. And he has some revelation that somehow what is flowing in the veins of that animal will answer to that which is in heaven. He probably had no concept that that was in heaven. But he had something inside of him in his being in his heart. I I want to give this animal. What a strange thing. We we we get we get impulses friends to to do certain things. And when we know that it's from God, we know that it's not from up here. We know that it's something from within. Then we know that God by his by his holy spirit, by his spirit is revealing something. And so Cain now uh Abel rather, Abel slays an animal and offers it on his altar. And the blood that's in that animal now is an actual material substance which came by the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's in animal form. But God brought all of these things by his word. &gt;&gt; And his word produced the substance. And the substance now by revelation has been placed upon an altar. And God looked upon that not because he would say, "I'm pleased that an animal has lost its life or I'm pleased that there's a substance on the on the uh on the altar." It was that now what was being reflected on earth was precisely what was in heaven. And the Bible says that God had respect to Abel's sacrifice and didn't have respect to Cain's. Not because God was saying, "I love one and I hate the other." Not because you're saved, you're lost. But this one by revelation was producing on earth what God had already established in heaven. And he said, "I accept that. &gt;&gt; That's what has already been in my program." That's an extension of what I've already had in my mind. And I have to I have to respect that. &gt;&gt; And the blood that was on the altar was a product of the word of God &gt;&gt; because God had had said, "Let the earth bring forth." &gt;&gt; Is that not so? Now the scripture that we use so frequently in the beginning John 1 and1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that is made and and the 14th verse and the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh. I will say the word was made muscles. The word was made skin. The word was made a heart. The word was made blood. And he dwelt among us. And the word was made flesh, was it not? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The fullness of God was in him &gt;&gt; and he shed blood. And I'll never forget the service many years ago back in the log church that Brother Lance preached and he said, "Even if we had a vial of the blood from Calvary, it would not save you. Even if we had it right here at the pull pit, if we had a vial of that blood, and I could guarantee you and say, "This has been carried on down through the centuries. This is the very blood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. You could hold it in your hand. You could dip it on your forehead. You could do what you want, but it wouldn't save you." &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh. And it was the men and the women who believed the word that that man spoke. &gt;&gt; It was still down to faith. They had to believe it. Now I still have a little distance to go. So now whatever was in heaven became a a red chemistry substance on earth that Abel offered on an altar. And I don't know the form of the altar whether it's wood or stone or what it was but he offers on an altar. And God looked upon it and God accepted it and had respect to it. And thus when Moses came on the scene, God begins to establish now not by one man but into a whole nation begin to say you build an altar. It'll anoint the altar. You put a sacrifice on the altar. You'll have a bullock and this where you'll offer and you'll offer this and you'll offer the fat for a peace offering. You'll offer this kind of offering. You'll offer a meal offering. Have this altar. You have that altar. But all the altar spoke of a sacrifice. and they altered. Then when they had a sin offering or a burnt offering, the thing was consumed. You'll take the blood and in the basin and you'll sprinkle it here and you'll sprinkle around the altar. And the whole thing spoke of redemption. The whole thing spoke of reconciliation. And now I I just need you to see this, but please establish this in your mind. when when Abel was so abs so consumed that he would take if I could describe that for you young people take and and and there had to be a moment in time when this young man stood out looking over his flock because he was a he was a a keeper of the flocks and he stood out over his flock and something laid a hold of him. Something took a hold of him that he could not control and he took he took one of his flock and something in him to take the life of this animal because the reason why I don't propose to have all the answers but I'm going to give you my answer. The reason why because this had to be an answer number one to the expulsion of his parents just now out of Eden. That this blood was going to say we've been separated. This blood is going to say there's been sin. This blood is going to answer to the sin which was a blood sin, a sexual sin. It's got to answer to the sin and it also has to answer to the reconciliation. And so both of them met in that sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I feel like preaching. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It answered to the sin. It answered to the expulsion. The blood said we've been separated. But the blood also said we're going to be united again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And thus God continued it with Moses and they offered until some people have difficulty reading the Old Testament because they said it was it's such a slaying of animals and sacrifices and that it was. And so now we have the chemistry and now we move on through to when here come the word made flesh. The word made flesh and the word caused that man called Jesus Christ to do absolutely everything that had already been spoken of in the scripture. And so as Jesus moved about, it was Isaiah's prophecy. It was a prophecy through uh David the psalmist. It was moving, moving, moving. And he took his steps. It was actually the word in flesh moving him and then that blood is given. Now the blood is a chemistry and the blood goes to the earth and in the mind of God the earth is claimed back because now this blood it didn't come from the first creation. This blood came from a new creation. &gt;&gt; This blood was the beginning of another creation. &gt;&gt; This blood was the beginning of a super race. You're not following me. Praise the Lord. 100%. This blood now is the word in flesh and by wicked and cruel hands he is slain. And that blood spills on the earth. And oh, how I love what the prophet says. Your body, I don't care who you are. I don't care what you believe. I don't care where you come from. I don't care where your birth and your lineage is from. Your body was laying on the earth in the substance of the earth. The very chemistry of your body was laying in the earth when the very blood of Jesus Christ was spilled on the ground and God was claiming every single one that was his own on that day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brother Brandham says, "And he climbed up on his altar, the cross." He climbed up on that wooden altar to offer himself for you and for me. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. &gt;&gt; He climbed on his altar. &gt;&gt; And the altar had to have a sacrifice. And the altar had to have blood. &gt;&gt; And there he died. &gt;&gt; To reconcile us. And that blood was acknowledging these people have been separated. These people have been expelled out of that which God had intended. But this blood will reunite them back again with their creator, with God. &gt;&gt; And it'll be a complete reuniting. It's not going to be in want of anything. It's be a complete union. &gt;&gt; It's going to be like a husband and wife &gt;&gt; union. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now watch it. So when God looked on Jesus Christ and saw the blood that was spilled and water and blood came out, when God saw that, what was it that he was satisfied with when it satisfied the judgment of God? That's swimming water, folks. I want your full attention. Whatever the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world, I don't know what the substance was, but I I'm certain it was not it wasn't a lamb. It wasn't the physical chemistry of the blood that was on the altar in heaven, but it it it changed its form. It it became that. And Abel now is slaying an animal, but actually when God looked on it, he just saw his word. &gt;&gt; And he saw a man who believed it by revelation. He didn't believe it by any other thing. He didn't have a book. He didn't have the Torah. He didn't have the Bible. He didn't have anything. He had had no prophets before him. He had no instruction before him. He was doing it be because of the impulse of God and giving revelation. And so now now he takes a substance which is completely foreign foreign to anything. I mean even killing an animal was foreign. The whole thing was foreign but he takes it. But when God looks on it now what was it that God was looking at? This is a very important I'm going to close in about 10 15 minutes but listen very close. So what was it that God was looking at? He had respect to that. Now that was an animal blood. Now we got a man and the man is Jesus Christ and he's the spotless son of God and he's shedding physical blood. Now he's shedding human blood. But this blood this blood came from a conception in the womb of a virgin. And that conception took place because the prophets prophesied it wasn't it wasn't Isaiah's words. It was thus saith the Lord behold a virgin shall conceive. And because thus sayeth the Lord, God who spoke the word and brought the animal that Abel slew, that same God was speaking his word through a man's mouth called Isaiah. And those words flowed through time for 800 years thereabouts. And they and the prophet says those words lodged in the womb of a woman called Mary, a little girl called Mary. Those words launched in her womb because she said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And the word became substance in her womb. &gt;&gt; And she brought forth Jesus Christ, the son of God. And it was that son who was at Calvary because now the word was made flesh. And it was the word that bled. &gt;&gt; It was the bleeding word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he released his spirit and that spirit came down into the church and the church now a body of people, a group of people were born by the spirit of God and that spirit of God began to make alive the word of God to them and they began on the altar of their heart began to believe that word &gt;&gt; and thus it was the word that was bleeding. and had to be on the altar. And when God looked upon that, said it didn't make any difference what age they were. It didn't make any difference what language they came from. Didn't matter what country they came from. If they believed the word, God looked upon the altar of the heart and saw the blood, &gt;&gt; saw the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Be it unto thee &gt;&gt; according to your faith. Be it unto thee, not according to your mind, not according to your reasoning. Be it unto you according to your faith, this morning, not yesterday, not tomorrow, now, &gt;&gt; today. What can you believe for? Whatever you can believe for, you can have because God will look upon that sacrifice and he'll see that blood. He'll say that that debt has been paid for. If you had an error, if you had something you need to make right, if you have some fear, you have some anxiety, you all you need to do is believe the word because it's the word that's bleeding on your behalf. &gt;&gt; And God's not going to look on the fear. He's not going to look on these other things. He's going to look on the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It's the word that has the promise. It's the word that's a sacrifice. It's the word that's bleeding. &gt;&gt; I've shown you it's been it's been the word even though the lamb slain before the foundation of the world, a a lamb creature slain on earth by Abel or Jesus Christ upon a cross or the word now in your heart. They are synonymous. &gt;&gt; I've taken you from eternity back to eternity. And you'll go in rapture because of what's on your altar. &gt;&gt; That is the rapture. You'll go in a body change because of the promise that's in the word of God and what you believe concerning it. &gt;&gt; What you believe concerning this, what's on your altar, that's what God's going to have respect to. A lot of people lay a graveyard friends &gt;&gt; and one will go and many others will not. And one over there and one over there. What's going to bring them out? It depends what they went in their grave with on their altar. &gt;&gt; They went into the grave believing &gt;&gt; there was blood on the altar when they went to the grave. And God will have respect to them and respect to this one. And they'll come up in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And you have a token today. The prophet could call you sinless &gt;&gt; because he said you possess the token in you. &gt;&gt; That's why I could preach the other Sunday. There isn't anybody here hasn't got flaws. &gt;&gt; Flaws. We have flaws. failures, weaknesses that we're ashamed of and perhaps even hate ourselves for it. But God sees, he sees, he knows those flaws. But you have a sacrifice. You have a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; It's his word that's bleeding, friends. It was his word in heaven. It was his word in Eden. It was his word throughout the Old Testament. And it's his word. And if you don't have that, you're lost. If you don't believe that, you're lost. &gt;&gt; But that by believing that God God looks upon that and has respect to it. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother David. May you receive what God has promised you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're here for God to do things. &gt;&gt; We want God to do things. I want God to annihilate and burn up the thing that's on your altar, the thing that's consumed you, the thing that has labor, been laboring on your heart. Let God have it. &gt;&gt; Let God have it. &gt;&gt; Let the doubts be gone in the name of Jesus Christ. Let the questions disappear in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why he called it the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; The word bled for you &gt;&gt; in the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. And that's where he could say in the same message, you're the spotless. &gt;&gt; Spotless, virtuous &gt;&gt; bride of the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; How? Only by his word. &gt;&gt; Only by his word. Not memorizing some scripture, but by his word. by the impulse of God in this hour. By the impulse for you to believe the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to that witnesses. Listen to that impulse this morning. Listen to it. There's no hope outside of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain. In the fifth chapter, Revelation, worthy is the lamb that was slain. And in the 13th chapter, all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him. That's the beast. All that dwell on the earth. Hello, earth dwellers. We're going to be in one of two categories. We're going to worship the beast or worship the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world. And that is the word. He is the word. We worship the word. &gt;&gt; We worship Christ. not a figment of our imagination. People try to think who Jesus is, who Christ is. Christ is the word. He's the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And thus we lay down our lives and we give ourselves unreservedly. He said, "And they whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world." There was a man that Brother Brandon was answering to and he spoke I believe he had a large radio following, radio broadcast following and he said that there was no no blood in heaven or something like that, no sacrifice. And he said his answer was if there isn't no sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received. Oh, I'm glad to announce to you the authority of God's infallible word. There's a sacrifice. Whether it has a physical blood is irrelevant to me. What substance it is is irrelevant to me. But I can tell you one thing, the word, the word of God has declared that it's there. &gt;&gt; And we come on the basis that the word has said so. Someone might say, "Well, that's being gullible." Well, I can tell you what. It's amazing that being gullible works as well as it does. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; People believe and the supernatural happens. I say I say what they believe then was absolutely correct because someone God supernatural came in behind and did it. If there's no sacrifice, the prayers can't be received. He said, "It's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through to God." We don't have to know for certain just what form, what substance. That's really irrelevant. But the one thing that we must convey to you this morning, it's absolutely essential. Absolutely essential. In fact, is it's imperative that you believe the word that God has sent. And I'm closing just now. I'll say Adam and Eve was in his mind. Abel was in his mind. The animal that God created was in his mind. The sacrifice on Abel's altar was in his mind. All the blood that was shed all down through the Old Testament. I don't understand it. I cannot understand that at all. There's places where it says that, you know, 30,000, the king gave 30,000 animals. That's incredible. In this Leodysian age, we, you know, a lot of people can't even kill a rabbit. Not that I want you to. When I saw eating my wife's flowers the other day, I almost wish to grab him by the neck, but I let him go. But, you know, we don't we don't have that in us. And so we read that, but that was in my God's mind. I just accept that. That was in God's mind. The burnt sacrifice that Noah offered was in God's mind. Jesus was in God's mind. The the whole uh the entire entire New Testament was in his God's mind. I'm just saying this and we come so quickly And I believe that this day was in God's mind. God who saw all these things. God who instigated all these things. I I'm coming to you. You're my friends who God has put us together with. I come as your brother. This this very moment was in God's mind. this very moment and what is it that he would want to look on and see? What is it that would be acceptable? Here we are and we've been all taken up, you know, with all kinds of things and that's fine. We we need to do things. We need to work. We need to pay our bills. We need to do all these things. We we enjoy certain things. We have certain pleasures and so on so forth. But I'm talking about now the heart is an altar. And it's it's the thing that's the deepest thing that lays on your heart. And if I asked you what was the deepest thing, the most the most significant thing that you could speak of, I guarantee you it would be something spiritual and it would have something to do with your relationship with God. It would have something to do with eternal life. Some of you might say, "It's the rapture. That's what consumes me. It's on my mind all the time." Someone else might say, "I'm I'm consumed with trying to please God. I want to please him so much. I'm I'm I am taken up. It looks like my time is consumed with my duties, my responsibilities, my work, my family, my children. And I just But deep down now, we're getting down to the altar. The inside of the inside. The thing that's on the altar is something that has to do with God and me and my relationship and my life with him and my walk with him. And my witness and what I want to do and what I want to be for him. That's what's really down there. I want to do something. I said this morning to God, &gt;&gt; "What would you have me to do? Whatever it is, there's nothing that's too difficult. There's nothing that would be too humbling. There's nothing that would be too great if I could do it. If it be within my capacity, tell me what you'd want me to do. Because that's what's really on my altar. And now what God is looking for friends, what are you looking for? He wants to see besides your desire, what made that desire. And he looks beyond that desire and he sees there. Oh, I've sent my word. I sent I I sent my word and I I vindicated. I proved I proved it. I stood by the man. I stood by the messenger. I was the one that did the healing. I was the one who revealed the secrets of the heart. I was the one who opened the scripture. I was the one who showed how sin originated and where it goes. I was the one who explained and made clear that I'm not three persons, that I'm one. I'm God. I'm the one who did all of that. And I see there that that is what he's believing. He's believing the word that I've sent. And now part of that word is you shall not all sleep &gt;&gt; and it's laying on my altar but we all shall be changed &gt;&gt; and that word is already been sac that word is a bleeding word and he looks through and he sees that sacrifice. He sees that word already laying there and and and and here it's in your heart. It's in your well it's on my heart. It's more than that. It's on your altar. And God, today, don't forget this. The God that I serve, the God that has brought you into this way is looking upon your altar today, looking at that promise. You might think it's in vain. It's not in vain. He's looking on that promise. And there's a number of promises that I'm going to leave you with that that's what God is looking at right now. what's on your altar that is acceptable before God and we've given it to him and here's what lays upon our altar as I'm leaving you with this and don't take it as something you've heard memorized and we've quoted so many times because now I brought it all the way from eternity down into this day in the year 2007 and group of people gathered. And what we have in common is one voice has gathered us. And that God who sent that voice has given certain words, certain promises. And now, behold, I show you. The first church age messenger said, "Behold, I show you a great mystery. I show you mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. that lays that isn't something that's just in a book that was printed on a printing press. I receive that as having come from the almighty creator of heavens and earth and it lays on my altar very very solidly. It lays there this morning. We shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; Does that lay on your altar? &gt;&gt; Could you declare that it's on your altar? Why doesn't his congregation say that in unison? We shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; We shall all be transformed. &gt;&gt; We shall all change in our in the figure of our being. We shall be transformed. We shall change our fashion. And that word is comprising everything in a person which strikes the senses. Everything that that person is, we shall all be changed. I wrote a number of scriptures down just to give you one more. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able, even to subdue all things unto himself. Who shall? He shall. Who is he? He is the word that was made flesh that came to spirit. Friends, regardless of uh I hope you can follow the whole operation of God, how it came down and I brought it right down to your individual heart right today taken and proving in the last two or three services that your heart is a actual altar of God. It's not made for the shopping mall. It's not made to be consumed with your job or where you can get an achievements of life. It's not made for any of these other things. Of course, those other things have to be there. They're part of our life. They're part of our being, but they're not on the altar of our heart. Our deep desire, the word that's laying on our heart is the promise of God. Some of you are maybe holding a a promise for someone. Not only for something, might not even be for yourself. But whatever you're holding on your heart. I tell you what, if you believe it according to God's promise, it shall be. That word is bleeding there. There's blood upon the altar. &gt;&gt; Not just physical blood being pumped in your heart. that physical being that muscle. I'm not speaking about that. You know that. But what's on your heart which is an altar of God that just just imagine if if you could imagine God for a moment looking there and seeing this will seeing this resolve and seeing this you know this uh the the the whole inner being of the individual and he looks upon that. But through all of the cares and all of the concerns of life, he actually looks to the altar. And on the altar is the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The promise &gt;&gt; is bleeding. It's been blood from heaven to Eden to Abel to Noah to Moses to Jesus and on into the New Testament and on into the book of Revelation been blood. And now here at the end of the age comes a man and God sends him with special signs. Oh, I know we have the picture and they call it the halo and the cloud and so on. Here comes a man with special signs to confirm the individual. And then he begins to speak and out of his mouth comes a word. Out of his mouth comes a messages. And then you hear that voice say, "Thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Congregation, hear me good. That word is bleeding. &gt;&gt; That word has blood. That word has blood. That word has sacrificial blood. That word believed will bring the supernatural into the individual. And that is why when that word was believed and there would be a person standing there with a growth with cancer. What is cancer? It is cells in the blood of the human individual. But when they believed that bleeding word, this blood disorder came into order and the cells, the wild cells were gone because that faith corrected what was in this body. Oh my. Can you see it? Can you see what I'm saying, friends? And in the next life, a man comes up and a and a prophet says, "The big thing with you, the thing that's on your heart is you are a you're a sinner." That wasn't only in the body. maybe gripped by habits of life, but down in his soul, he had been an unbeliever, maybe a a a sinner, an unbelieving man. He says, "If you believe, do you believe?" And that man would say, "Yes." And on the basis of that one word, sin, Satan lost his grip on an individual and he's pulled into the kingdom of God. If God would do that, if you believe the same word, you say, "I'm here this morning because I believe thus saith the Lord." That's why I'm here. I believe thus sayaith the Lord. That's a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; That's a sacrificial word. And that's the word. If you pass away, that's a word that'll bring you from the earth. &gt;&gt; That'll bring you from the grave. And if you're here and alive, we that are alive and remain. If you're here, if you're here, then that same word being held on the altar at that at that instant I said at the very beginning of the service when Joshua was getting ready to clo cross over and I feel we're kind of at that time and the Bible says it was at flood time when Jordan overflowed its banks. That's a service in itself. This generation, this day that you're living in, has overflowed its banks. &gt;&gt; Sin has overflowed its banks. Violence has overflowed its banks. &gt;&gt; Death and trouble has overflowed its banks. I would say that the that the nations of the world are essentially out of control. They don't have control. Leaders don't have control, but God has control. And the word that you believe is the bleeding word. God bless you. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Oh gracious God of grace, God of mercy, God of love. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for your people. They are so attentive. They give themselves so completely, so unreservedly, drinking in, oh God, hanging on to each word. I pray, Father, that if I would have said anything that is contrary to truth or contrary to what your Holy Spirit would have had said this morning, that you would remove it out from the minds of the people and erase it out of eternity's record. But oh God, if it be your word, if it be the impulse of the Holy Spirit, how you have moved upon my own heart, I pray it will reverberate down into the very soul of each person, oh God, and continue this mighty work that you have begun, oh God, in our congregation. Begin it, I pray, Father. I pray you'll condemn unbelief and cast it out far from us. and let the people be liberated, oh God, to believe the promise in a pure heart in the name of Jesus Christ. We'll give you all the praise and all the glory. We thank you. Now, I'll ask you to stand. Let's each one as you see fit just give him thanks in your heart. Thank him for calling you into this way. Thank him for his deliverance in your life. Thank him for the revelation. The same one that revealed to to Abel who it was and what it was. The same one who revealed it to him and revealed it to you. We thank you for this revelation. Oh God, we thank you for your mighty Holy Spirit. We thank you for the infilling, oh Lord. I pray that you'll take, oh God, each member of your precious body, oh God, and give them that give them that divine presence and touch and with you today, Lord, I pray you'll grant it. And Lord, whatever there may be that has been on the hearts of the individuals, I see them looking. I see them intently looking. I see them, oh father, looking to you now for your promise. Let the fire of God, let the Holy Spirit of God come and consume the sacrifice &gt;&gt; name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said to one of his last gatherings of people, "If you feel that you're not just ready for the rapture, that if it would come tonight and you'd want to be remembered in prayer, He asked the people to take a make a identify themselves and raise their hand. Just raise your hand. And we have no place to make an altar call but your altars in your heart anyhow. If you feel that need said further the word has come to pass planted in your heart if you want to go in the rapture in times like these. Linda if you would please. In times like these [Music] &gt;&gt; just prayerfully Now, [Music] be very [Music] [Music] anger. [Music] and grips the solid rock. &gt;&gt; This rock is &gt;&gt; and he's the word. &gt;&gt; This rock is Jesus. The only be sure be very sure your anor [Music] and grips as solid. Before we go any further, I was looking for a couple of things I want to leave with you in the message, the lamb and the dove. Jesus said he was, brother Bren said Jesus was training some men that was going to take the gospel to all the world. 12 men. So he lived a sanctified life and forfeited every worldly pleasure for their sake. And we ought to forfeit our worldly dressing and our worldly pleasures and things like that for the sake of the people that we're trying to lead to God and outside the outside world. Let the dove come tonight and sanctify yourself that the dove of real faith will come in and take his abode. Then he asked this question. How many in here that knows that this great thing would happen and you'd go to bed tonight with your wife and in the morning she'll be gone. You father and mother may kiss your little ones to sleep tonight and tomorrow morning the little bed be empty and you'll turn run down the street to find out what happened to Mrs. Jones. She's gone too. The raptures at hand, the Bible has plainly given. And in the meeting, while you have the chance, just as men of intelligence and women of intelligence, why don't you heed to the call in your heart and say, "Lord God, fill me with that eternal life." I realize that I'm speaking to a congregation for the most part. You've given yourself your believers. I'm so thankful for this congregation, but I quite frankly I don't believe that these that these statements are ever I don't believe they're ever out of date. I believe it's good for us to take and ponder this right now. &gt;&gt; If if that was a reality back then, how much more real it is now. We're at a time of crossing over. A time I'll say to you, sanctify the altar. Let's not just carry on where we always have been, but we sanctify the altar. You'll never regret the service. You'll never regret making that resolve within your heart and soul. I my altar sanctified to you, Lord. I give it to you. Let me pray with you. If you'd like to raise your hand as a identifying that God is talking to you and calling for a deeper dedication, I raise mine with you and I'm looking to him day by day saying, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" Dear Lord Jesus, we are lifting up your name before these people. You're the one who has called us because of your voice. We have responded to it and we find ourselves here in the pathway that we're in today. We've taken another step. We've heard another word. We've heard some of the things that you have sent through your vindicated messenger. Lord, I pray the Holy Spirit now take the words that have been spoken in this service and anchor them, fasten them deep within the hearts of the people. Oh God, let these promises lay upon the altar, the bleeding sacrifice, and you will look upon it, oh God, and you will look upon it, and we'll have respect to it. And thus, let the people be the recipients. Let them receive. May they believe and may they receive. May they go out from this place today, oh God, being those that would inherit the inheritance of God through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Do this great thing I pray. &gt;&gt; I commit it to you now in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We give him glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I sanctify myself." May we wholly sanctify ourselves. We sing that chorus. Here is love. Love fast. [Music] as a when the free of life our ransom shed for us his preious blood through his Love will not remember. Who can sing to sing his praise? [Music] eternal days [Music] on earth [Music] [Music] and deep and wide through the valley. [Music] of God's mercy &gt;&gt; flowing today and gracious high [Music] will not remember. [Music] Who can see to sing his praise? He will never [Music] be forgotten [Music] throughout [Music] eternal days. Grace and love [Music] like mighty rivers flowing sent from heaven's peace and perfect justice [Music] is the [Music] worthy [Music] will not remember. Who can see his praise? He will never [Music] &gt;&gt; who is love once again who is love [Music] will not remember who can't to sing his praise. &gt;&gt; He will. &gt;&gt; He will never be forgotten [Music] &gt;&gt; throughout eternal days. Now my brother and sister before you leave this place let this be firmly anchored in your heart that if you will do this hold that bleeding sacrifice not just a scripture you quote or a quote that you've remembered but take and realize I have a bleeding promise not just a promise a bleeding promise Greater than my fault, &gt;&gt; greater than my flaws, greater than every other desire that I could even think of. I have a bleeding sacrifice. And furthermore, God my father is looking on that because that is word that he has spoken. And because he has spoken it, I can expect something to happen. I can expect an answer. Do you believe it? How many believers do we have? You believe it with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Gracious, gracious and loving father who we've been told by your messenger you loved fatherhood. And because you did, you had to become a father. Because you did, you had to have a son because you did. You loved a family that came through this son. Here we are, Lord. Here we are. We're your children. We're just your children. Sometimes we stumble. Sometimes we fall. Sometimes we're not what we want to be. But yet, we will say to your glory, we're not what we used to be. &gt;&gt; We're so changed. Our desires have changed. Our pathways have changed. And our future looks so bright and wonderful. Lord, we want to thank you, Father, because uh we are in full anticipation of a day of crossing the shore, reaching the shore, nearing the shore, and we're going to step over onto that glorious that glorious shore. Oh God, we're there. We're going to begin to meet, Lord, the redeemed of all the ages. Oh, my mind can hardly grasp it, but I do believe it. And there, Lord, we'll be united with you. That's what the blood was shed for, for a complete reconciliation. Now, I ask you'll take and let these things be treasures in the hearts of your people.
