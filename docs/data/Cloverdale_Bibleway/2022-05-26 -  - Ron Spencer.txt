clip ready brother joe all right i'll if you could just have that queued up it's a testimony that we wanted to share with you some of you are a little bit familiar but i think this will be special for a few of you but uh since 2019 my wife and i uh sister elaine sister elena and myself uh had miscarriage after miscarriage not very many people really knew about it they were all in the first trimester and uh some early on so it's it's sometimes just a part of life and so you move on but it kept happening and there's you know we're very blessed to have the son and daughter that we have but there was a desire in our heart you know for another child and um in i believe it was late 2019 or early 2020 she had a miscarriage that was really quite hard on her body and um and so it became kind of a real fearful thing for her and um fast forward now till 2021 and in august late july and august of just last year um we found out she was expecting again and so we're excited but there's that that fear now because now there's been a bit of a pattern for a couple years and um uh she had another miscarriage and lost the baby and this one was was quite severe and there came a point where she finally called her doctor and the doctor said you should go to the emergency room just because of how how much of the hemorrhaging that was taking place and elena was just so weak she's like i don't want to go to the hospital so we had prayer and the lord stopped the bleeding and she was out for eight to ten days about ten days she couldn't really do anything and so i was in full-time school working trying to take care of the kids it was a challenging couple weeks you know and she feels um you know like she's not able to do anything it's very hard for a mother but she was just really weak and really discouraged and there's all the physical things happening as well it's a very challenging time and that took us right up to camp in fact when we came to summer camp it was right out of that and i i'd messaged brother michael it's like if i don't seem very excited about all the camped prep it's because i am so tired and like this is where we are and i told brother michael what was going on just so he had a heads up like this is what we've been going through the last couple weeks it was the ten days before camp and uh poor elena was just so tired and and just her body recovering and uh all the emotional side of it as well so we came into camp very tired and uh just you know still trusting the lord but just disappointed again and having this was our fourth or fifth at this point and um at the very end of camp brother wayne lawson this will be special brother luis and sister grace as well at the very end of camp on his sunday morning he proceeds to share a bunch of testimonies i'm sure a number of you remember he told testimony after testimony told the testimony of the sister who was crippled and she came up to give a testimony when she reached for the microphone he said and with these eyes i saw her hand straighten out and then after that the last two testimonies that he shares were about the lord granting children to people who had not been able to have children previously and so i have that testimony clip it's about five or sorry uh yeah testimony that's about five minutes but i thought it would be important so we're going to share it with you share a little bit of the testimony with you we could queue that up brother right in my house my my son zechariah got married to a lovely young lady named hannah anna carter from brother paula fontaine some of you might know her wasn't long after they were married they decided they want to have a child which would be my first grandchild and i was happy for them my my goal in life is to have a pile of grandkids hanging around the house that's like my ultimate goal seriously so i was so happy to hear the news and then she expected we always rejoicing lost the baby that was a birthday a little while later they worked up the nerve to try again she got expected lost the baby went to the doctors they said well we're not sure what's really wrong some of her people around her begin to say well there's a there's a lineage that we're from and some of them is not able to bear children because of certain diseases strike their body and they they they they're not going to be able to have them so her and zachariah were we're in labor wandering praying asking god well about this same season brother erickson had ron spencer to come for our total meetings and it may have been may i don't remember we had him twice that year and in the end of the service we were having a prayer line and when brother ron started praying he asked me to join him and i come and stood there with him and while we were praying for people all of a sudden zechariah and anna come on my heart and i said lord i want to see him have that baby i want to see him have that baby lord if you just let them come in this prayer line it give me a little comfort and all of a sudden in that same moment zachariah pops up gets anna comes right down there stands into the prayer line brother ron goes to pray for him puts his hand on and begins to pray and steps back and looks at her he said in the name of the lord jesus you'll have that baby that's pretty bold so we rocked around almost a year no baby i went and preached for mother's brother spencer in february the end of february while i was there i was preaching come along and i said i just want to testify to y'all and i'm a grandpa they're like you're a grandpa yeah i'm a grandpa it's online if you won't go listen to it i said i don't have a pregnancy test but i still got some faith and my face says i'm to have a baby i'm going to have a grandbaby god said i could have it and brother spencer's sitting on the road behind me and you can hear him scream out that's thus saith the lord you're going to have that baby that's pretty that's pretty bold well he told me later he said well i knew i already seen a vision of it that's well that that explains so time rocked around 11. and all of a sudden one day i come home and anna and my wife are crying like a couple little kids and i think oh lord what's happened now so i go outside and i walk around and i'm saying lord you promised me that baby you you i don't think them kids could go through another disappointment you promised that baby and i come back in there and they got a little card for me and they hand me the card and i opened it up and it's the pregnancy test it's positive we're about to have a baby listen let me tell you you talk about about rejoicing but wait you know there's nine months there's there's time so we we wait we wait and finally finally we were able to hold that baby little evelyn god gave us that little baby now we have the picture you have it hey man show me show me the one with brother ron's dedicating her this is there's one with brother ron's holder that's zechariah and anna and little evelyn amen brother ron's dedicating a child that the lord let him have a vision of isn't that powerful isn't that powerful now now the next picture there now she's a little bit older in there ain't she pretty yeah that one wasn't needed but i want to show y'all baby pictures [Music] it's about wait what are you doing i'm showing you that this message is real i was preaching in a meeting one time over in david versus and the young man's a pastor now he meant his wife sister stephanie they were sitting in the meeting and i was preaching right along and i was preaching all of a sudden that inspiration comes on me and i point out at sister stephanie and i said listen god change your body if he needs to god changed mary god changed hannah god gave those babies god's able to do whatever to cause something to happen hey man you can have that baby if you can believe it i didn't even know she's praying for a baby ten months later she comes to arkansas walks in the church she said here brother wayne's that baby i said i didn't even know you were wanting to baby she said do you not remember pointing me out and telling me that god would give me the desires of my heart if i could i said no i don't even remember it because see god can speak to a man god can speak to a woman when the speaker don't even know what is being asked for but god remains to be god let me tell you something he's still god that's the lord amen so you can sit me and see me at the piano sitting there looking really awkward because there's a mess of emotions going on there i'm like this man has no idea what we've just come through so after the meetings were over i tracked him down in the dining hall and i said brother wayne lawson you don't know this but my wife and i just came off of our fourth miscarriage and this was a real hard one and he said anytime i feel led of the lord to share that he said i i know that there's a reason for it but while i was sitting there at the piano i'm not just saying thank you lord this is so timely i just so appreciate it and the holy spirit spoke he said you will have a son and name him samuel and on may 9th hallelujah the lord thank you lord jesus so may 9th little samuel jaron came he was perfect in every way the doctor says this is as perfect as a baby can be and we're just so blessed and so grateful i just want to share that with you there's been a reason we delayed the baby announcement we wanted to be able to share the back story behind it and just give glory to the lord for what he's done when god speaks things happen amen we have to choir why don't you go ahead and conquer god bless you we're going to sing a song for you and then we'll turn the service to our brother tom god bless you may have your seats god is good

incredible son he is our service leader and also a speaker as well and he speaks a couple of times a year in her absence and and he is the young man that pulled me out of the fire and so had it not been for our lord jesus having him on the scene amen well i i really didn't enjoy cremation so so we're here amen i'd like to thank you for allowing us to be a part of this brother tom brother ed we go back a long way we're family and uh i'd like to if i could just have a couple of moments and i'm going to take them but i'd like to put my my thoughts and i have a lot of emotions that goes with this but your 50 years has been so special to us and as many as all around the world and the ministry of brother ed muscle has touched hundreds of thousands of lives i just happened to be one of them and it was when i was a little boy we would go home from church and and on on sunday evening william west virginia was the radio broadcast and we would listen to brother tom as he would introduce and then brother branham preach and uh and that kind of gave us a touch we didn't have we didn't have all the tapes that we needed and and my dad it was like sacred event when that's when that came on nobody talked you just listened to that and it was just so wonderful in 1978 i got the opportunity to to listen to brother ed for the first time i i don't know exactly how old i was i didn't stop and figure it out but i was a teenager at that time and i'd heard a lot of speakers so because i was born and raised in church in the message and i heard a lot of speakers but i never heard one like that because he made it real as a young man it connected i got married i i was saved in 1983. the lord dealt with my heart and dad asked me one day he said who was your favorite speaker as you came through your teenage years who was your favorite speaker and i said well it was a man that came and spoke on experiences and he said that's brother biscuit he said he's going to be in in north carolina in a few weeks would you like to go and so i said absolutely i'd like to go so we drove four or five hours to be there and and it was a church that was a unique way that they did business and connie and i had just got married and so they separated the girls from the guys they thought she was too young to sit with me and they took her off to sunday school i was expecting an older gray-headed man to step out and preach and here come a bouncing athlete and brother biscuit stepped out and i was on the fourth row i was about where you're sitting and brother biscuit preached on the breach and you must cross over and what a powerful sermon that it was it would be a couple of years later that he would be at the north carolina camp at brother henry greene's and he would speak a sermon called let us run i was a young man there and as a young man i was sitting and i was a young preacher at that time you know i i didn't have a lot of direction i went back and listened to that sermon this morning brother bisical spoke he spoke on many people though down through the ages and he took different ones like peter cartwright and he he took men of the ages john wesley and he took and he took portions of their lives and showed what god did with them in the works spoke about john wesley speaking 88 000 sermons spoke about how this one produced all the books that they did and translated sometimes 42 different bibles and as he began to to speak those things he began to talk about that last seed and that last seed would be the most costly and we must be driven to get that last seed what he was doing in that camp meeting service was explaining god was allowing him to explain my life and brother biscuit was standing and explaining his life and his life was not just himself but it was his wife because behind every great man is a great woman a great family and then a great church and none of it's possible without a great god we don't lift up a gr the men because of their humanity but if somebody don't go many of you wouldn't be here without brother bischo having went [Music] we've all got our critics but our critics actually make us the masterpiece they actually testify that we are the masterpiece i would be given the opportunity my father and mother would go to brother billy andrews for 19 years to hear brother biskell speak it was their anniversary and they loved it they didn't want to go away to the mountains or to the beach they wanted to go hear brother biscuit preach brother bischo my father passed away the other day 82 years old i'll share something with you you were the last preacher he was listening to that day thank you thank you my father was a great was a great man and he would listen to tape after tape after tape and he and he loved this message with all of his heart and he loved brother ed with everything that was within him amen so i thank you as an audience i thank you as a people i thank you brother tom for all the efforts for the behind the scenes an unsung hero a passionate warrior [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] thank you brother milko we'll talk soon we'll talk soon [Applause] [Music] [Applause] as we heard sermons like the administration of the son of a man the proven accuracy of the word and for decades we've been listening to the five ladies of grace i want to say this to you more than a man was preaching to us jesus christ was using a vessel to speak to you as an audience i hope you have enjoyed 50 years and the greatest thing is there's more to come [Music] i stood with brother biscuit in in in switzerland for ten years and and spoke with him he's a great salesman he told me i must go and his last sermon i believe was was be thou an example some of his last words in that sermon was we're challenged to finish this i want to say this to you as this meeting i i address you with my fortune i want to challenge you and stand and be one of the voices yes let's finish let's finish i don't want to get to the edge of it and quit and go back and get tired less finish with more energy than ever before [Applause] i believe it was the last time that i was here i was standing at the fireplace with brother murphy at brother tom's house and we were just standing there and i i saw a vision and i hope that's all right to be open about that saw a vision i told brother murphy i said i see a baby coming he thought it was him then i called sister tracy over and he was really scared but it was for you sister grace congratulations to you guys [Applause] [Music] is it okay to take my time here from the last time i was here i was getting some bad news you didn't know it but i was starting to get it get some bad news and i was going to come by myself i had went to the doctor and i the doctor had told me you need to get some scans and so i got some scans and so they actually called me and told me we have some we have some news that's coming for you and so i was coming here and so i i came and the one of the doctors um office managers called sister connie and said you need to book a ticket and be with brother ron because he's going to get some really bad news and she said i don't know if i can get that ticket she said well god can help her help you and so she explained to the to the i think it was delta she explained to them what was going on and they actually put her right beside of me of every leg of that flights five minutes before brother tom picked me up at the airport brother drake i got a call from the doctor and the doctor told me said you have cancer in your lungs i walked out of the out of the hot out of that that hotel walked down the steps and all i knew was i'm going to preach on courage tonight and i spoke on courage with all my heart [Music] so regardless of what circumstance you're going through murphy called me and he told me that you were you were having quite a bit of trouble sister grace that it would be impossible for you to have a child on the day that he called you call me and told me that that you couldn't have children only minutes before i had been in the office with the doctor and they had told me that i was terminal and so i figured since god showed me a vision that you would have a baby that same god was telling me that i would be well [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now maybe you're even even maybe even having even under negative thought maybe satan's entered a negative thought at this point i want to just let's just think about this meeting just for a moment brother david mayer came and spoke a masterpiece on jubilee when you go back and dissect that he came almost at every angle on jubilee that you could possibly come until tomorrow morning when brother tim pruitt takes it all back apart and puts it all back together again and you enjoyed that sermon and you remember brother biscuit got a letter from switzerland and god spoke to him and you know the entire story but here's something maybe you don't know i was there and i was preaching and brother david mayer that's two foot taller than me and he is translating for me and god is moving in the service and as he's moving it hits me brother michael you might you might appreciate the story and brother david is standing beside of me and i said now don't translate this part i said brother david god has called you to preach the message of the hour and not just preach the message of the hour but you'll be a pastor isn't that the truth he had never preached a sermon in his life wasn't that a masterpiece friday [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] joshua where's joshua at joshua his son he's on the front amen well i have tunnel vision i can't see so joshua this morning he had came to this meeting expecting to get a encounter with god and this morning where's brother joel you remember your encounter it changed your life he got that kind of encounter this morning [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah it'd be great what a great god that we serve and we so love him with all of our hearts and and um maybe just before because i just told my son just before i stepped out to come up here i said i believe i believe in this kind of an atmosphere anything is possible now for for those that don't know i was just at the doctor just only a few days ago and these are the top oncologists in our in our area in the state of virginia and i i just asked her i asked her i said where are we at we're two years down the road now where are we at we take chemo every day the strongest chemo that you can take where do you where do you see that we're at she said well she said you you have just as much cancer as you ever had except for that growth that we removed she had you have just as much brain cancer just as much lung cancer the lymph nodes are there the cancer is there and she said she said you're taking the chemo every day you're tolerating that and she said it's your god she said you're the only one we have like you said i've never had one like you in all our lives you are our testimony [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah now i wear a pen and maybe i'll just explain that to you that pen is more than just a hope cancer pen but every time i wear it in the pulpit there are people that has cancer around the world it is unbelievable the outsiders the denominational people people that are not christians that doctors tell them what he's preaching works stupid devil [Applause] what he thinks is destroying is actually winning seed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't want you to pity me but i sure do want you to pray for me thank you for your prayers thank you for everything we love you with all of our hearts i hope i didn't take too much time amen you want me to preach now is that all right for me preach now so here i stand and and uh supposing to have been dead two years ago do i look like a cancer patient this message works i want to say it this message works [Music] no matter what trial that you're in or what situation you're in hallelujah you can ignore the symptoms and walk right on day by day good bad ugly move forward [Applause] amen so in the face of all of that i i feel led to speak to you and this might be part three or part four of jubilee but i want to take my thought this this afternoon on nothing can stop this [Music] how that must shiver hell because they know it you're amen's ought to have been stronger than that hell knows this message is true [Applause] amen amen god bless you could you stand with me just for a moment we love you brother tom thank you thank you amen happy birthday ryan amen amen psalms chapter 27 and verse 1. before we go to that could we just talk to the lord now in a few moments we will have a prayer line no man is the healer jesus is the healer brother ron you have cancer understand that they say that i've had cancer for eight years during that time we've seen cancers gone we've seen cripples walk we've seen death here we've seen blind eyes opened [Applause] and we've seen the dead race nothing can stop this word now i want you to i want you to ask the lord to sweep by your way i want you to ask him before a prayer line i want you to come ask him to come and touch your heart heavenly father we love you with all of our hearts how thankful that we are how grateful that we are for 50 years but we'll spend eternity thinking of the greatness that you have been among us testimony after testimony that we've been allowed to be a part of lord jesus just now just now as we turn the pages to to read your word lord you see our needs i stand here tonight with great need and i believe that you can touch me never to have another cello cancer again i believe not only do i preach it but i believe it and you're the healer father you spit on the ground and took clay and put it in a man's eyes you touched the leper you went to jairus's daughter and said damsel arise you went to your friend lazarus and called him by name not only that you went to hell for me so i wouldn't have to go and you can save the worst sinner in the whole world tonight your power has not lost its touch we asked you now that you would just come among us may angel's wings sweep across this audience father lord we already sense your presence even now now we ask you for strength in my body to speak your word in a very supernatural way we pray in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen amen psalms chapter 27 and verse 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked and even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat me up eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident in the midst of war i'll be confident one thing that i have desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock isaiah 53 and verse 5 one scripture and it's still as powerful today it's the moment that it was written but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace what's upon him and with his stripes we are healed could we read that together today and read it with passion but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed god bless you you may be seated brother branham said what are we afraid about possess the gates we have god's promises we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels are encamped about us everything is in order every wall can be took down it's already took down the son of god goes before us his banners are waving and there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint of god going to meet the promise of god death can't stop him the grave can't stop him the devil can't stop it [Applause] [Music] may we make a declaration today when the philistines saw that their champion was dead they fled cancer may be their champion today but our champion is unstoppable [Applause] hallelujah determination in our lives i read this just a bit ago we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender [Music] we will never surrender we will fight for our families we will fight for our children we will fight for our healing we will fight for our deliverance we will fight for joy we will fight for peace we will fight for the holy ghost we will fight until our bodies are changed and we're sitting at the marriage supper of the lamb [Applause] we will never never never never give up matthew chapter 16 and verse 13 when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiahs are the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee thou art peter name change and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell the strongest part of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven maybe your thoughts are we've heard that a million times well i want to ask you who is among us today more than brother ed bischol more than tom ray more than temperate it was more than wigan branham the mighty angel himself [Applause] is among us and if he is on our side [Applause] we cannot lose [Applause] we are reminded brother random had to stop and say you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man he wanted to caution don't feed on my personality you feed on him [Applause] you feed on him he's the one that'll heal you he's the one that will deliver you he's the one that will save you he's the one that will bring you out of a grave he's the one that will rapture you and your mortal will take on immortality brother dave may we just make a declaration and say it as strong as we can say it somebody's got to be the final voice somebody's got to be the final voice we've had the energies of those that have went past and we we're thankful for every bit of it but somebody's got to have determination somebody's got to have passion in their life and say it nothing you've got satan [Applause] homes cars jobs personalities governments [Music] trudeau can't stop this covet couldn't stop this the government of china couldn't stop this [Music] social liberals cannot stop this denominational spirits can't stop this [Applause] [Music] cold church of christ the mountains can't stop this [Applause] satan has tried every scheme well if you're going to have war you have war so what he does he points maybe at your pastor really what your pastor that he was pointing at and then he points at the message then he points at you then he can't can't agree with the bible he was trying to stop it you ought to be smiling right now you ought to be smiling right now he's done everything that he could do to stop you just go ahead and smile he's done everything that he could do to stop this i understand that you came to this meeting trying to get your sister out of a cult [Laughter] and here you said [Applause] don't god have a sense of humor and we know all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified it's rigged [Music] [Applause] it's rigged it's a rigged court it's a red car you were one out of a million [Applause] but god predestinated your seat to life and if god watched over the natural sea how much more will he watch over you hallelujah hallelujah so no matter what trial that you go through what situation that you go through god's watched over you he's protected your sin and your fathers in times past were in wars and in plagues and in horrendous situations and god watched over them in battles and and literally angels stood and stopped shells he stopped ships from turning upside down he stopped car wrecks because he was watching over your seat [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah when you get a grip of that that god was watching over your natural seed since adam because you were here when jesus was here [Music] [Applause] hallelujah you're a pedigree christian you were in the lion's book before the foundation you're a thought brother ron i don't believe so much in visions well god had a vision of you before the foundation of the world he thought of you he knew how tall you'd be what color hair that should be what color eyes that you'd be how tall [Applause] [Music] you're even your attributes everything about you and through all of that here you are fully manifested [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and he predecimated you to hear this word when a million turned it down what eve turned down you believe you have accepted [Applause] it's like breath to you it's your life it's your passion it's your jubilee [Applause] it set you free from denominational thinking it sets you free from sin it sets you free from habits and all different kind of things in your life and then when they try to come back in the power of the blood of jesus christ and the seal of the holy ghost stopped it because you're sealed in [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i want you to think about this at every meeting jesus conducted satan was there he was critical at every meeting that he conducted he had questions he made fun of him he called him every day and jesus told them just days before of what was going to happen now remember god created his own enemy and he had a beginning and he'll have an end he said let there be light there was darkness there was love and there was hate satan was the anti-type to actually show how great god was maybe you're looking at the picture wrong but god created his own critic [Applause] hope you're listening satan hope you're listening it was god that created you you may have forgot but it was god that created you and so so now all the way down god has been descending through the old testament and you could see god in moses sometimes you have to look strong you could see god in joseph disappointing to be in a dungeon you could see god in jonah they maybe didn't understand that they were displaying god but god was making his way toward his own vessel of himself becoming flesh now satan had 4 thousand years to stop it because he was watching he faced every one of those prophets but he couldn't stop redemption from happening [Music] he couldn't stop redemption from happening he couldn't interrupt god's plan [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he couldn't interrupt it he couldn't stop it he had all of these demons and imps at his disposal and in every junction he couldn't stop the word and time from interception and prophecy being fulfilled he couldn't stop behold the virgin shall conceive satan had to watch the angel come to mary [Applause] in that other dimension he had to watch that angel come to that girl and knowing the scriptures he never went to a girl before but now he goes to a girl so he goes back to hell and says we got to make up a story we gotta make up a story we gotta we gotta have some fake news that she has an affair with a soldier but she steps into the vision and says be it unto me according to thy word [Music] shepherds came kings came every meeting satan tried to disqualify 50 years satan's tried to disqualify you 50 years 50 years boy he's been hard at work we celebrate 50 years here he's been here every service every service you've thrown him out [Music] you've cast out demons you've worshipped the lord you've all you've you've sent this a message around the world and satan just keeps coming back just like the fellow that's standing in the pulpit he would have killed that fella if he'd have had the power he'd have killed me a long time ago if he had the power [Applause] because we've done his his kingdom much damage in the last two years we've done his kingdom a lot of damage you've done the kingdom of hell much damage in 50 years that's to be celebrated [Applause] [Music] jesus says that it's finished they take his body they put it in a tomb sometimes what you don't see what's going on is jesus was on a mission god sent jesus to hell so you wouldn't have to go he just didn't come to heal you and and to lift your spirits but he has prevented you from ever tasting hell now this is something you need to celebrate this mortal realm is as close to hell as you'll ever go [Applause] for the sinner this border realm is as close to heaven as they'll ever it's get a thought isn't it so jesus goes to hell and while he's there he takes the keys of death hell and the grave he does something that no mortal man has ever been able to do because when he was standing in flesh he said i have power to lay my life down and the power to take it up again he warns satan [Applause] he warned satan he told him the prince of this world is judged he warned him and in all of that wording satan with all of his power with all of his thoughts of all of his perversion couldn't stop him [Music] [Applause] i want you to stink jesus tells a woman to come to put spices on his body knowing they wasn't going to find him in the tomb i believe it was you that said brother david you said that the tomb was open because he could have walked through the door i thought that was awesome i would have said it if i thought of it but they needed to see that there was an empty tomb [Applause] but i want you to just think about this you're sitting here you believe the message and sometimes you feel like how did i get worthy to be able to sit here and hear what i hear and see what i see of all the people living on the earth kings ambassadors incredible people of all of the people living on the earth he invites them [Music] [Applause] oh i feel like running he invites them to come and see him in another room [Applause] now satan you can amen from that dimension if you want to he told them touch me not i'm not ascended but not only could they not touch him satan couldn't touch it [Applause] hallelujah can i just say this to you just now whether you realize it or not that seed that is sealed in satan can touch your flesh he can contaminate your spirit but his cold dirty hands can't touch that sea and you can't stop that seed from coming to life and manifesting rapture conditions [Music] that must make him so mad did you kill him yet guy god just preached another sermon you know what happened to me the other day when i got here at your fellowship all day i'd felt discomfort and i take a pain pill in the morning and take a pain pill in the afternoon then we came to the meeting and the boys took me back to the hotel i felt really uncomfortable so i took another one i've never did that about 12 o'clock i got up and gave birth to a baby boy and had a kidney stone stupid devil so don't you know you don't need to have a pity party because greater is he that is in you [Applause] greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world brother abraham was standing over that little boy that was finland from finland and brother brandon makes this statement he says you don't know how it feels and know where you're at then all the devil's out of hell if he'd line up everything that there was in hell around it never stopped it [Applause] the next time you have a critic talk to you about that finnish boy why don't you just give them this quote brother baby said every devil out of hell strongness to the weakest you got to line them all up every preacher ought to be shouting all over this building you got to line them all up and you couldn't have stopped it [Music] [Applause] this quote is more than just a 50 year old quote you could line up every devil out of him and you can't stop this rapture [Applause] this very moment has been preserved like your gene seed has been preserved this 50-year jubilee has been preserved angels have stood here night after night and watched you worship hear you amen knowing there were demon forces trying to destroy but if god is fool you who can be against you he is here to see this message through more than the personality of frail men but god himself is here [Applause] around the world to see this word through and satan i want to say it without being too redundant you can't stop it your pastor was called to come up and set that's not the amen corner he's not here so i'll just say it he could have been the prime minister he'd have made a good one he could have been one of the richest businessmen in the world he was gifted god was with him god raised him up but to be more than a prime minister why would he want to stoop from this pulpit [Applause] and take trudeau's job [Applause] when eternal gene seeds are setting just feet away and they're to be encouraged they're to be enlightened they're to be strengthened they're to be anointed by the mighty angel himself [Applause] because it was more than more than quotes in a book more than quotes on a on a tape it was a vision of god and god knew you'd be sitting here but god's not finished with this yet he's not finished with this message yet [Applause] [Music] there will be a marriage supper [Music] you're sitting here and you haven't been touched this young man got a touch this morning every generation he got a taste of what you've got brother joel and that changed your life [Applause] you've had difficulties you've had situations nothing stopped it brother cam you and sister nettie is that right had it i was close don't be mad you're in a place where you could throw rocks when i first came to canada i stayed in your home you gave me your daughter's bedroom and i prayed that your daughter would get saved and when you at early in the morning when i got in your car you said you'd been up all night praying with your daughter god dealt with her during the night i don't know how to say it any better god hadn't forgotten [Music] amen amen [Music] ben you you came to wednesday night service declaring i'll never i'll never go back to church and your dad said ben ron spencer's preaching he didn't want no more church and i wasn't even supposed to be there i was going to your place brother tim and brother harold that just passed called me and said won't you stop at wins on wednesday night here two months before god spoke to him he said the sermon you're studying you'll preach at harold's and i actually sat at my desk and i said lord i have no plans to be at harrels god has plans and so i stopped and i preached wednesday night and you were sitting near a post your plans were this will be my last service and you didn't realize that was only the start [Applause] praise god do you think god just picks you up and start you out and then goes in the middle of a project goes you know i'm done he'll see it through [Applause] he'll see it through ella [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no doubt a lot of doctors said ella will will be one of those forever childs will never accomplish nothing in life she gets permission from her father to call me now and then she doesn't realize that it's some of my most difficult days that she calls me and i hear a girl that's rolled around on the floor and she's had incredible horrible days and she could probably out preach most preachers god nature of an angel [Applause] that stupid devil [Applause] that stupid devil now she's graduating hallelujah [Applause] she told me the other day i'm going to be a lawyer i said i believe it's on my heart poor devil my doctor has the same disease you have one of them she stumbles through the door and one day i told her your story she said you don't know it but it's conditions like this that drive us when the enemy says we can't [Applause] when the enemy says we can't it puts something on the inside of us it puts something on the inside of us now i'm going on very sacred ground tomorrow morning you're going to have one of the greatest preachers that ever lived in history preached to you i know i'm on sacred ground i got a thick skin i can handle it but i just see things as in an eternal realm and his father told him he'd be a forever child he would never amount to nothing there's a jubilee [Music] there's a jubilee he watched his son stand in the pulpit this morning he may not have been able to play with the boys and run with the boys and do all the games with the boys but that condition drove him what a stupid devil [Applause] you know none of us see the condition of job where an interview takes place between god and satan and god has so much confidence in trusting you [Applause] he has so much confidence in you that you'll trust him regardless of the circumstances you won't give up you won't turn around you won't go back because god himself has had fellowship with you [Applause] and he asked satan you considered my cervix [Applause] [Music] [Music] i didn't know where we would be two years later two and a half years later when god spoke to me in my office and said if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] we trust him i don't trust the government i don't trust humanity [Applause] i'm not standing here because of popularity i could care less about that every day i get told in my ear you're going to die during your sleep tonight it don't bother me he's been a liar for two and a half years why should i believe him now brother branham said god's strategy god's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them like a pentecost at pentecost what did he do he'd taken them 10 days and got it all emptied up but they was all standing there with their vessels turned up and god took himself and filled them up that's all and they shook the world [Applause] can i have about five more minutes that means americans here amen amen how many want to be i want to be a canadian you want to be american we're celebrating our our jubilee here in this service we're also celebrating liberation because we're not a slave no more [Applause] we're celebrating we're not going back we're celebrating our freedom now now there are people that don't enjoy our praise and worship and let me tell you why they've never really got free [Applause] because if you've ever really been a slave you'll be thrilled [Applause] [Music] if you've ever been a drug addict you'll be thrilled when the addiction's not there no more have you ever been hooked on pornography you'll be thrilled that you can live a pure life if you've ever had a suicide devil or a depression devil you'll be thrilled when god sets you free and you never have to go back ever again i'm ever amazed how god weaves services together i have no idea what tomorrow's coming but i'd like to talk to you about songs for a while is that all right you see in our southern culture i don't offend nobody but we're all christians in our southern cultures there were slaves that was brought to america and there were people like me and you brother tim and you timothy you brother david all of you preachers brother tim all of you wanted to see those slaves be set free so they would set up areas to where you meet us about 12 o'clock at night in the midst of darkness and

excuses to be backslidden is not greater than god god's here to set you free your broken marriage and relationships listen that's not greater than god your situations that you see hopeless is not greater than god is that right either we believe it or we don't believe it even we believe we're going in a rapture or we don't believe we're going into rapture and if we believe that what about

runner went to the top of the mountain said the sun is coming up oh my i was just visualizing that get up there run up there as fast as you can and it doesn't matter the fastest sprinter just trucking it as hard as you can at the top of the mountain just so he could see the sunrise and somebody way down in the valley is deep and dark and shadowed but that person at the top he a little peeked over the cliff and he said wait a second your sleeves no longer oh my i was rejoicing in my seat and that one he could send her back down the sun's coming up this sunset has just started to relay right down to the valley somebody in the valley right now i'm on the mountaintop and i'm telling you there is no more slavery there's no more fear because i'm shout from the mountain freedom rings the sun is up oh my jubilee has sounded and we have responded to the original life amen god's attributes were manifested [Music] do you see is [Music] this is is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] me is [Music] just wait just wait just as i was thinking there i got to inject this this thought brother david when he spoke on the first night he spoke about the seals on the tomb they were there burst forth and it wasn't to let christ out oh my i loved that it wasn't to let christ out it was to prove to prove that he'd resurrected oh my goodness he broke the seals to prove that he was still the same god yesterday today and forever in this day to say i still am alive forevermore oh i love that oh i just love that we are called unto adoption [Music] [Music] [Music] victory me oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one of the brothers was preaching there the last couple services somebody was talking about just the resurrected saints and they just mentioned something maybe them coming up the aisle my goodness i can't imagine yeah you were saying if you those with christ of course they'll see it those that don't they wouldn't even see it but i just was thinking what a moment that would be i'll change that statement what a moment that will be and i can tell you whatsapp servers will overload they won't quite understand why because when one of us around the bride around the world sees a resurrected saint for the first time oh my goodness the believer grapevine will light up so fast oh my goodness i'm waiting for that moment i'm expecting the moment maybe someone's going to burst through the doors right now and say it's on oh that's what i'm longing for that's where i'm living right now there's never been a time like this time i know we say well rapture's on right now there's just that next step of the rapture cycle when we see someone has gone on before maybe his brother henry he was gone too long he's like man i was only going a short time
