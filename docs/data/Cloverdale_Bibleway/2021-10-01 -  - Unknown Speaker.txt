TRANSCRIPT
========================================
salvation is very easy it's the story of redemption it's a story of windows of opportunity that every man took noah came with the ark and there was a door god sent the prophet there is a door and brad says when you receive the gift the god is sent in the day it opens up the age of golden opportunity but going to hell is harder than getting saved because for you to be lost it means that every window of opportunity you rejected it's not easy to do that right honestly in two days the same thing the very same thing we are given the opportunity because god cannot judge without first having or without first giving his warning if you told a certain person going down the road speeding stop and say there is a hole down the road there if you continue to speed you'll be killed and they say nonsense i know what i'm doing then you see the blood can be upon you because you have thoroughly warned them well god does the same thing by his word he thoroughly warns the people of uncoming judgment and shows his sign and wonders that's predicted in the bible for that age he shows them and the people just walk right over it it's not easy for a person to go to hell a man fights his way to hell a man fights his way to hell the first lie you ever told you know it was wrong the first cigarette you ever smoked you know that was wrong the first evil you did you know that was wrong but in your conscience something told you was wrong but you continually ran through the red light ran over the barricades you're reckless you want to do it anyhow to show that you're some big guy huh see but remember you fight your way to hell it is not easy to go to hell you have to reject truth and i'm not preaching hell tonight to scare anybody but i'm saying the way to hell is more difficult than the way to salvation salvation is one opportunity you take it hell is rejecting truth over and over and over again how many windows have you had if you've been raised in the church for 20 years i guarantee you've had a window at least every service how many windows are you rejecting to fight your way to hell you say that if i was in the day of jesus maybe i would have stood for him probably says that you have a more you have more of an opportunity to stand for him tonight than you would have back in those days because the opposition today is greater than it was then you say if i was with the disciples and i saw jesus christ in the flesh surely i would have stood for him but the opposition today the forces of hell today against the truth are harder there are more fierce today than then so if you serve god today and stand for him today that is a greater opportunity than the disciples what you have today is a much greater opportunity why won't you take it
