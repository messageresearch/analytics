We're going to open the service in a word of prayer. Amen. Brother Eli Waldner, could I ask you to come, please open the service for us as the brothers would come and receive the morning offering also. We don't have any written prayer requests, but we know there are many needs in the body. Steve and our family, we've been remembering my grandfather. God's blessed him with long life, 99 years old, and he's just in a home now, and they're not expecting him to last much longer. And brother Brenham says God heals the old. That he can still reach down and touch a man at 99 years old. Or if it's time to go home, then we just pray that God would grant him peace and comfort and release from the pain. But we're just thankful for lives that God's moved upon. So I'm in the baptismal tank at 80ome years old and just been really privileged to see God move in our family. And brother Eli, could you come please and open the service for us as the deacons come? If there's something on your heart that you just like to remember with an upraised hand, we know that God sees that. It's an act of faith even to raise your hand and say, "God, see me." Amen. Thank you, brother Eli. Let's just pray. Dear gracious father, we come before you this morning giving you thanks and praise for your mercy and grace upon our lives, Father. So thankful for your love and kindness, Lord Jesus. You're such a merciful God, Lord. We appreciate what you've done in our lives, how you saved us and delivered us from sin and darkness of this world, Lord. Father, we just pray you'll continue to give us strength to fight to fight this fight to run the race that set before us, Lord. God, we need you every hour, Lord. We need your direction for our lives, Lord. We pray Lord this morning that they'd come and visit us in a special way. Lord, anoint your servant, oh God, that you've prepared, Lord, and he's laid his face before you. And God, we just pray you'll anoint him now and give him the words of life for each one of us, Father. We're just hungering and thirsting this morning, Lord. You know what we each have need of, Father. Just take us a little bit higher this morning, Lord. Deliver us from anything we need to be delivered off, Lord. Any anything that isn't pleasing to you, Father. Take it out of our lives, Father, and help us to keep pressing on, Lord. We just ask you to bless the service this morning in a mighty way, Father. We also pray, Father, for the the offerings this morning, Lord, and the tithes, oh God, as the people give, Father. We just ask, God, that your holy presence would be upon each one, Lord. Lord, you love giving hearts. We just ask you to bless each one that's giving. Father, Lord, that the word will continue to go forth in power, Lord. Just ask you to bless the offering this morning. Each one that's here this morning. Bless us. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Bless you as you have your seats. If I could but touch the hem of his garment. And we want to greet you all this morning in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's happy to be gathered together again this morning. And brother Tony, sister, is this your last Sunday with us here? Bless you and the family. Brother Peter, sister Harley, Sister Katherine, we'll miss seeing you here with us, but God bless you on your travels and look forward to seeing you back here again. God bless you. Anyone else visiting, I saw Sister Connie Leonard here. Sister Connie, always a privilege to have you with us. God bless you. Anyone else who's visiting this morning, we pray you just feel welcome in the house of the Lord today. Let's sing this as we take up the offering. If I could but touch the hem of his garment. Oh, if I could not touch the head of his arms [Music] all [Music] my good touch. I know what he will again [Music] the [Music] one of his [Music] I know I [Music] My s for [Music] touch. [Music] &gt;&gt; One more time. In life touch [Music] [Music] I know I [Music] my sins all forgiven. [Music] I could touch it and I love [Music] Amen. We're going to turn the service directly to our pastor and ask our brother Ed to come. As he does, let's just sing Shackled by a heavy burden, neath the load of guilt and pain. Amen. But he touched me and now I'm no longer the same. Amen. Sing the verse. I was shackled by a hair [Music] and the hand the hand of Jesus I see you [Music] and all the sing [Music] my soul. I know something happened and I know Jesus and I sus [Music] Sing [Music] to praise him. How shall he [Music] jo [Music] something And now Jesus and Jesus [Music] my soul. Oh, something happened. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy about that? &gt;&gt; We desire him to touch us again &gt;&gt; and again &gt;&gt; and again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something about his presence that just satisfies so wonderfully. Well, I heard uh our brother and sister Debolt are going to be departing and we're going to miss that role. Brother Tony, Sister Rose, God bless you. Brother Peter, I got it right. I almost changed his name to David. Don't call him Brother David. It's Brother Peter. Sister Harley and Sister Katherine. God bless you. We enjoyed having you over our home and I know all who have visited with you have uh have built a relationship and a treasure uh treasure your company. So may God give you a prosperous uh season and bring you back soon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have an announcement that we wish to make. uh our brother Jean and sister Sephora Jaka and brother Jacques and sister Jeene uh Kubaluca. They wish to announce the marriage of their children. They are have become engaged Naomi and Justin. Looks like Naomi is pro promoting the Canadians. Where's Sister Naomi and Brother Justin? We'd like to have them stand. There they are. God bless you. and brother Jean Chimpaka flew all the way from Africa for this announcement. Uh that is that's real fatherhood. God bless you, brother Jean. So nice to have you here, Sister Sephora. And I didn't know but brother Justin and uh I believe his mother or some of his family were here at our 40th anniversary but many came and we weren't able to greet them all at that time. So uh just so if you shake hands with brother Justin you know that he's not a stranger entirely. He has been here before and now lives in Chicago. God bless you, brother Justin. Sister Naomi, as you make your plans for the future, I want to uh get directly to the word today and we'll ask for your kind attention and as little movement as possible. Uh, I just have been feeling so so different about this service. I want to preach on and speak on Bethl, the house of God's bread. I'd like to say something before we start the service and that is that I I really feel a very great weight upon the ministry. Whoever ministers, be it brother John and brother Tom, brother Tim or myself, whoever ministers, brother Kenandes and brother Ernie Vil Noea when he's here, whoever and wherever they minister, it's there is a great weight. Uh, and I'll explain this. Brother Brandham speaks about the and I'll be reading the quote. He speaks about the uh the compound meaning and it's compound because it meant something to the people back there in the Bible when it happened and it means something further up perhaps it things that were happening in the scripture also meant had a special meaning in the time of Jesus or the apostles the disciples and or the early church and then that same scripture will take a quantum leap and have even a deeper or greater meaning to this time. And if we don't see when we're speaking of that scripture, if we just stay back there uh and don't get the compound aspect of it, then it can't come home to you. It's got to mean something here today, now. And if we speak about the things that they experienced back there, you know, they lived perhaps a very rural life. So we think, oh yeah, well that's a lot different than than we are. But the same principles apply, the same things. Maybe you work for a corporation and you come home and you earn a salary and all the rest of it. And maybe they had cattle that were, you know, uh, having calves and they're shearing sheep and they're doing all those things. But work is work. Whether you're driving nails or shearing sheep, it's all work. And and then and God is not He's not interested whether you're driving a nail or washing dishes or whether you're going with a pot on your head to go and get water. It's it's it's irrelevant to God really except what is important and what is relevant that God meets them where they may where they are. God meets the people in maybe in the New Testament where they are and God meets us today where we are. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'd like to have you stand if you would, and we're going to ask for his special guidance. Appreciate all that are here and all the families that are represented, all the young people, children. I was thinking much about the families this morning. And uh the body of Jesus Christ wouldn't be what it is without every member of that body. And I just had a special appreciation, a special thanksgiving to God for the various families. And some perhaps are more visible than others, but that is not what's important. The important part is that we've been called. We've been called and placed into the body and we have been done. That has been done by none other than the Holy Spirit. He is the only one that can do that. And he uses various ministries and various experiences in our lives to bring that about. But that's very important. And the fact that you're here today isn't because you just figured that, you know, it'll be good for me to move or be here or be with these people or whatever. I believe and furthermore, I am absolutely convinced that God has certain times to do certain things and this will have a lot of meaning to you as we move through the scripture. So, let's ask you'll join with me as we pray. Dear heavenly father, we are feeling and sensing your nearness and we believe Lord you want to say something to us and I pray you will talk you'll speak &gt;&gt; take your word oh God and speak to the people &gt;&gt; how you know each individual one and you've placed such great value upon the lives You considered their value was so great while they sold you for 30 measly pieces of silver. You went in the next few days and gave your life blood for each each drop of blood. Lord, you paid for us. And we are not our own what we are been bought with a price. Not silver or gold or corruptible things, but with the precious blood of the lamb of God. And oh lamb of God, when there was no one worthy to take a book that was recorded and all of our deeds were recorded, you are not ashamed of them. We are perhaps ashamed of some of the deeds and the thoughts and the things that we've said, but you said, "I have the blood." You are a mighty man of wealth. You carry the wealth of the world in your new creation. The new creation. Oh, we thank you for the second Adam, the new creation, the very lamb of God, the son of God that came forth. And we're so thankful for the message that has revealed you. What a precious precious gift we have, Lord. While others perhaps are gathering today and and they're they're sincere. But Lord, it's more than sincerity. It's the grace, the grace of God. You came by our way, Lord. and we thank you for that. We pray you'll receive honor and glory. Bless the word now and bless our gathering. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you musicians. It'll be fine. I'll have you turn in your Bible, please, to Genesis the 28th chapter. And we're going to read from Genesis 28 verse 10 on down to verse 22. Um I think that what I'll do sometimes we're not exactly certain what we wish to do but I want to convey something out of these scriptures and so I think we'll read them and perhaps then just go back over it so you can keep your Bible open starting with verse 10. And Jacob went out from Beersa and went toward Haron. And he laid it upon a certain place and terried there all night because the sun was set. And he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down at that place to sleep. And he dreamed a dream. Behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And behold, the Lord And behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac, the land whereon thou liest. To thee will I give it, and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth. And thou shalt spread abroad on the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and in thee, and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Notice now when he said that, and to thee and to thy seed, that seed that was in him. And just in case uh I wouldn't want you to just quickly go over that and pass it by, but I decided I would I would want to see how many germs there were in a human sperm. Uh and it is from a low of 20 million to 200 million. So you were not here by accident. It was God that gave conception. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; It was God that gave conception. You were one of those massive mass amount of sperm and now here you are a living person born to somebody and you're in this service. And whether you're here by accident or whether you're here by habit is irrelevant. This may be a a a a day that's been chosen for you to hear something, to start something, for the Holy Spirit to come to you in a special way and maybe create a special moment. &gt;&gt; And that's what I've prayed for. to thy seed to thy seed. And behold, the Lord stood above it. And I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, the God of Isaac, and the land whereon thou liest will I give it will I give it and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be, verse 14, shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad, to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee, and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all thy in all places, whether thou goest, and whether and will bring thee again into the land, into this land. For I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of." And he was afraid, and he said, "How dreadful is this place? This is none other but the house of God. And this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it for a pillar. Set it up for a pillar and poured of e oil upon it the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethl. But the name of that city was called L or LSE at the first. And LSE is a almond tree. It was called an almond tree. But he named it Bethl, the house of God's bread. And Jacob vowed a vow saying, I will if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raignment to put on. So shall so that I come again to my father's house in peace. Then shall the Lord be my God. And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house. And all of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give thee the 10th unto thee. The Lord bless his word. You may have your seats. The reason I hesitated between some of the verses and the reading was largely because I have uh some notes in between and I want to make some comments now. Um just see if I have brother Benham says concerning Bethlehem. Beth Bethlehem the name Bethl. Beth B h Beth in the Hebrew word means house. L E L stands for Elohim means God. Beth L is is Elohim which is God. The house of God where the bread of life laid means a loaf of bread in the Hebrews. In the Hebrew Elohim, L is God. Elohim Beth is house. L is Elohim. Then E L E M is bread. What was he? The house of the bread of God. The house of God's bread. Now I want to just take a moment and I think this is very very important for you to get into the life of Jacob at this time when he he he just came to this place. It was just a place to stop and and stay overnight. It said the sun was fixed. But this man now certain things had taken place in his life and a lot was to take place but certain things had already happened. One was he had got the blessing of the birthright. Brother Brandham said he had actually he'd actually deceived his his mother helped him but he deceived his brother his father into believing that he was the eldest and he got the birthright. The birthright friends was everything. &gt;&gt; It was the right to be in the lineage of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And and that birthight is very significant for you and I. You either are here with the birthright &gt;&gt; or without the birthight. It may be destined for you. You perhaps are to be in that lineage, but that would be by the second birth. And that's why each person, each son and daughter of God must come by the second birth. We must be born into the kingdom of God. So now Jacob had received this birthright. His brother was terribly angry about it. Uh his brother cried out to his father, "Do you not have one blessing left for me?" and he said what I've said I have said and the blessing is already on Jacob and he couldn't reverse it. Uh it it uh all of these things have such depth and such meaning, but I simply want to say that this was on his mind and he knew that he had trouble in the home and trouble in the family and and he's uh out here in this uh desert place and just makes a a place to sleep and puts his uh head on some on some stones and That's where he rests. And he has a dream. And this dream is this ladder that is reaching into heaven. And uh not only is it a ladder reaching into heaven, but angels are descending and ascending on it. And God is at the top. And uh so he comes to the realization this is the house of God. And he he names it Bethl. And I'm going to go through the I'm going to go through the seasons of Bethl with you. And I want you to be able to stay with me. And if you are not able, you'll jot it down if you would jot your questions down. I would be happy to go back over it with you. Brother Brandham said in enticing s uh spirits, Bethl was just a pile of rocks laid upon one another. And it became the house of God, the dwelling place. And Jacob said, "This is none other than the house of God, just a pile of stones laying on top of one another. It doesn't take the great elaborate things. It takes the simplicity and faith to believe in what it takes. That's what makes it. And you have lighted upon. It says he lighted upon it. He he happened to come to this place. It wasn't anything very elaborate or glamorous. You are here this morning now. Uh, I'm I'm going to tie up so you'll be able to see from Jacob was the house of God. Jesus, he said, "I'm the bread that came down from heaven." That was the house of God's bread. And then in this day, we h you are here because we have received, you have received or you've been touched by. And many people have been through the meetings whether they're the prophets meetings or other believers churches or here. But you have been touched by the revelation of this house of God's bread. And the prophet of God was a very very unique person in that he was his life was to follow the pattern of Jesus Christ in that he comes out of poverty comes out of obscurity is is is just blown onto the scene with a supernatural ministry. People are coming. He didn't send out invitations. They came by the thousands and thousands and tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands. Why? Because they were attracted to the fire. They were attracted to the supernatural. And then uh that they came with their sick. They came with their dead and dying. They came with uh the afflicted uh for years until they were wasted to nothing. They came expecting the they just knew that this God this was something supernatural they had never seen. And so the signs and the miracles and it seemed that there was nothing too difficult for this person's God. They were looking for answers that could not come from the medical field, could not come from their education. They were looking for answers that the psychologists and wise of the world could not answer. They were looking for answers maybe to dilemmas that uh the financial world couldn't solve. They had uh incredible just insurmountable unanswerable problems, questions perhaps marital questions as the woman at the well had. Perhaps other kinds of questions, maybe family, maybe difficulties within the family, things that were just insoluble. We are that way. We either are that way or we had that at some point in our lives. And I can tell you what you needed. You needed the bread &gt;&gt; of life. &gt;&gt; You needed the kind of bread that would give you strength, &gt;&gt; would give you hope again, &gt;&gt; would would answer your questions and and and solve these insoluble problems. &gt;&gt; You needed bread. Bread. God's a good baker. This is God's bread. &gt;&gt; This isn't some human bread from some bakery. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This isn't wonder bread. &gt;&gt; This is supernatural bread. &gt;&gt; This is God's bread. &gt;&gt; And and and thank God that he has a house, &gt;&gt; has a place &gt;&gt; from which the bread comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we thank God in this generation. And then Jesus who was the bread of life said, "I will be in you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I will dwell in you. &gt;&gt; I my father will be in you. &gt;&gt; And I want to be able to come if I have time to. You are bread. &gt;&gt; You have You possess the bread of life &gt;&gt; and not for yourself only. It's already worked its miracle for you. But what about someone else? &gt;&gt; There's someone that you live by. There's someone there's somebody who's your peers. And regardless of your age, whether you're young or your teens or you're in your 20s or now you're a young couple or whatever more, there's somebody. Oh, it may seem like everything's going along fine, but you don't know what they face &gt;&gt; when they're alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. when they're alone in their room, when they're pondering the deep things of life, and they have to think at some point in time, you might be in your 20s today, but someday you'll you'll have to think about crossing over. &gt;&gt; It's appointed unto man once to die. &gt;&gt; And after this, the judgment, you need God's bread. &gt;&gt; You need God's bread. In case that sounds a very distant place from you, ask God just now to make it very near, very real, because that's the ultimate in as far as this life is concerned. We were born, we were birthed, we were conceived, we came into the world, and now here we sit and we're in this place. Not a very glamorous place, not a very special place, but we're here in what we call Cloverdale. Cloverdale was a hay seed town. Excuse the term. We call it Clover Gulch because it was just a very very plain town. This Suriri, this part of Suriri was kind of the uh not even the average man's place. This was the low end. And uh of course pressure on the land and everything else. We won't even get into that. But it became quite uh quite a good place to live. and everybody had to have a place to live. But regardless of that, people are people have insoluble problems. Every person, whether on the low end of the ladder or whether they're multi-millionaires or multi-millionaires or whatever more, all have enormous problems and we will continue with those problems. But in the midst of Satan's Eden, &gt;&gt; that's right. We have the bread of life &gt;&gt; and some of the secrets of that are in this passage of scripture. There's something that happens. It happens back there. It h it's happening today. It happened in Jesus time. and that is that the life and the things that we'll cover with Jacob and God help me to move forward as quickly as possible, but they happened in Jesus time. And I'm I'm just looking for that one quote. Uh I want it badly. It's it's uh in a message in 1965. Brother Brandham preached this day is the scripture fulfilled and brother Mitchell is in that meeting. I interviewed him at a television station in Rowan Oak, West Virginia. But he said in this message and he was speaking of Christ, he said, excuse me, how he could stand there and say, "This day is this scripture fulfilled right before your eyes." Now, here's a prophet in 1965 putting himself back in that time and bringing it forward. Compound meaning, &gt;&gt; right? And he's saying how could he say this day is the scripture fulfilled before your eyes. How outstanding. How so plainly. And yet those people misunderstood. They misunderstood. People today misunderstand. I hope you don't misunderstand. He said, and then he asked the question, why is because they took the interpretation of some order of priests that they were listening to. And history always repeats itself. Here's a phrase. This is paragraph 56. You may want to mark it in that message when you get it. History always repeats itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has a compound meaning. It meant something to them when it happened. &gt;&gt; It meant something to Jacob when it happened when he was having this dream. It means something further down the road in Jesus time. I'm the bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; What made Jacob say, "This is the house of God. This is the house of God's bread." Well, I can tell you why. He received the answers to his incomprehensible and absolutely impossible questions. He received those answ. Wouldn't you like to receive them this morning? &gt;&gt; You're carrying some. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, he has the answer for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are some things that we're craving for and if we don't you will and you'll need to have the answer he is the bread and and something that I want to convey to you that when he comes forward when he feeds your soul on the answer to life and the answer to your insoluble questions, it'll they'll just evaporate like ether. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a a change that comes over a person and you are able to not cope with that. That's not what I'm asking. That's not what I'm saying. It isn't something where you're able to cope with the dilemma. That's not it. It's something where he deals with the dilemma or where he takes control of you in some way. Maybe it's faith that needs to come in and then the faith comes in such a measure that he's in control. &gt;&gt; Faith is faith comes to you to the place where all of your burdens we we may sing about it. just leave your burdens at the place of prayer or I leave them at the feet of Jesus. And we sing it and it sounds wonderful and it's the melody is lovely but to do it it's we find it hard, don't we? &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. I see you smile when I say don't we? It's not always that easy. And then there are things, well, you say, well, uh, I've lived with these things for years, or I've lived with something without an answer for years, it doesn't mean he doesn't have the answer. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're just not able to obtain it. But when God steps down and does something and and the reason I'm able to preach this is because I've experienced these things that I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he lighted upon a place. He lighted upon a certain place. Nothing elaborate. Pile of stones. The prophet says that's what it was. Just a pile of stones, right? &gt;&gt; You should have seen when brother Don Alexander shoveled the first shovel of dirt here at this place to dedicate this piece of ground to the Lord. Who knew? Who knew that such a building would be put up? What's the building? Nothing. It's a bunch of giprock and lumber and nails and so on. But what what's the people that are in it? What's happened here? How many have been baptized? You say, "Oh, yeah. I know a lot have been baptized and they're here. They're there every we we don't care about that. &gt;&gt; We're not here to worry about that. We're we're here to be concerned about the children." &gt;&gt; And the families &gt;&gt; and the bread of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, some maybe they won't make it, maybe they won't." We're not here for that. We're here for those that will. We're here for those that are going to be around the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, he lighted upon a certain place and and that word that's a it's an old English term, but it it means to light it upon the place to encounter encountered something. He wasn't expecting that dream. He didn't order that dream. It didn't say, "I'm now I'm going to lay my head down and yeah, now I'm going to have a wonderful dream. It's going to be used about. It's going to be preached about. Oh, this is a great great moment. This is a great great place." That wasn't it at all. He laid it upon a place and he carried there all night because the sun was set. And he took a stones. He took the stones of that place, that place, and placed them for his pillows. you know that God knew what was going to happen in this place. &gt;&gt; God knew exactly what was going to happen. And uh even though it was just a pile of stones, Bethl became a very very special place. And you lighted upon a different kind of a place. You've lighted here and you're sitting on some benches. You say, "Well, Brother Ed, you're making this just so common." That's exactly what I want to do. &gt;&gt; I want to make it so common. You just have a song service and brother Ryan gets up and sings and so different ones are musicians and someone's going to preach and uh we want something enthusiastic and something very exciting. Maybe God just wants to settle you down to the humrum of life &gt;&gt; and let your problems soak into your mind as they were in Jacob's mind. I can tell you. I'm going to go on just a little bit further. He lighted upon this place and then this is what happened. If there ever was a time when we need special special nutrition, I'm speaking now from my heart. If there ever was a time we need special strength, special stability, special insight, special discernment. &gt;&gt; It's today when you go into school and you you that are students and you've got to choose what am I going to do? What what will I take as a major? What am I going to major in university? And some of you are here and I thought of these. Some of you are here sit tash you're here from Zimbabwe. Where's Zimbabwe? I happen to know Zimbabwe to me was a place of a great burden. And from this church we poured out a lot of energy, made a lot of trips, have a lot of experiences. We won't even talk about them. But Zimbabwe young lady comes uh cuz she's intelligent gets uh per permission to come to Canada to a certain university to study certain thing and so he studies he's on her way in life parents sending her perhaps I'm only using her as example excuse me sister Tash there are many others Brother Jean Manassi, but I'm talking now about Sister Tash. And then life gets touched by something that seems to be different. Gets a taste of the bread of life. &gt;&gt; Not us, not the ministry here. &gt;&gt; But she gets touched. Brother Jean Manasi gets touched, carries it into the university. Who who's who who's doing this? Excuse me just a moment. Who's who's who's guiding this kind of thing? That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Is this all accident or is this something divine? &gt;&gt; What what should we call this place that's divine? And then you got big questions in life. And and then here's this brother Daniel. He's from the Congo. And I I just felt I needed to relate a couple things. And we're not going to be long on it, but everything changes as time goes. And and questions somehow are divinely answered from some other place and things begin to come into place and so on and so forth. You say, "Oh, well, I'm not there, but you may be where I am." When you start getting at a whole lot of different questions, you you're standing here today or you're sitting here watching someone standing behind and I've got different kind of questions. Do do I want to leave my family or do I want to leave? What happens to them? Or what am I supposed to do? What what about the church? What about the people? What about all of these things? What about those? What what about the past? What about the by the way where it started? What about how how what is what's this all about? What what what's God's plan? Then people come and people hear and you know it's not it's not an indivi. Then you find out it's not an individual. It's not a person. It's not a personality. It's not your skills. It's not your smarts. It has nothing to do with that. It has there's then then there comes a realization there's there's got to be someone and and uh Jacob excuse me but I'm taking my time and Jacob wakes up from this dream and he says this is a terrible place this is a dreadful place why was it dreadful it's the same stones he just piled up what has made it dreadful there was a presence there was something happening thing that he realized was out of his control. &gt;&gt; He met a god that he he met He met God and he said, "This is the house of this is the house of God. This is the house of God's bread. This is the gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; This is a dreadful place." Now, you might not realize that what I'm going to say. I sat in a car beside a the prophet of God. You say, "Well, that must have been wonderful." No, you got it wrong. I'm sitting there and I have questions. I got questions in my heart and I don't know which direction. I don't know. I had just gotten a job. God knew I had just gotten a job. That that's my own You're not interested in that. That's my own personal problem. I have three little babies, three children to feed and just starting school and I got I got a whole different set of set of things. You're not interested in that. Of course you're not. You got your own life. You're busy. You've got things. I'm saying my God is the same that knows your life. I irregardless of where you are in the station of life. That's irrelevant. But where you sit today is very relevant &gt;&gt; because I say you're not here by accident. &gt;&gt; You're any more than a Jacob beside that pile of stones was not a was not an accident. God knew that place and he stopped at that place and that place became a very very special place. I am here today to say to you that this place can become a very special place to you. And some may may be sitting here because well I'm here because my parents are here. I'm here because somebody moved here. You have to wake up and find out say in your heart I didn't invent this place. &gt;&gt; I didn't make this place. &gt;&gt; God ordained it. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to regard that &gt;&gt; whether it's special or not. I'm going to allow God, the God of heaven, the God of Jacob, the God of father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and yes, the God of William Brandham, that God. &gt;&gt; And I'm sitting in the car, and suddenly there comes one in the car. Another one. I thought I was going to die. I've had people say to me, "Oh, I know what that feels like, brother Biscll." And I just had to say to myself, "No, you don't know anything about this. This became a dreadful place. A place where a person's totally exposed. No one wants to be vulnerable. Nobody wants to be totally exposed. Nobody wants to be naked before God. No one wants to face or confront a power that knows everything about you, every secret, every thought that you've had or desire that you've had. No one wants to be in that place. And I can tell you there were people that came before brother Brandham. There was a man in Windsor, Ontario in the meeting in Windsor, Ontario, and he decided in his smarts, this man's a fake. This man invents these things, this man exercises telepathy. So, they decided and he was a a leader in a church in the church world. and we'll get down to our where we should be in a few moments. And he decided that he and another couple went for lunch. And in lunch, they decided that in fact, there's a pastor I was with in Toronto. He was in I don't know if he was in this meeting, but this man writes his doom on a prayer on a prayer card. And he wrote on a prayer card that he had tuberculosis and cancer. And when he came before brother Brandham, Brother Brandham said, "I had a gray suit on and a red tie, intelligent looking man, smart as attack." He came to the platform and he walked up and he said, "Well, just let me have your hand." And brother Brandham said, "Let me have your hand." He says, "I'm tired and I've I've seen so many visions. Let me have your hand." And I never noticed the man, but he put his hand over on mine and I said, "Sir, there's nothing wrong with you. Just go ahead." And then went on quite a dialogue and the man is saying, "No, no, no." and he opens up his shirt or something and uh and then brother Brandon finally said to him, I said, "Sir, why has the devil put in your heart to try to deceive God?" A modern Judas, I said, "You are a church of Christ." And then he said, "Excuse me." Well, I done said it. And then he went on, you are a Church of Christ preacher and you belong to the Church of Christ over in the United States. And that man sitting up there and he points to a man on the balcony with that blue suit on and your wife and his wife sitting there. You sat at a table last night that had a green thing over it spread like this and you made up that this was telepathy and you were coming tonight. And that man raised up and he said, "That's the honest truth. God have mercy on me." And I said, "Sir, you put TB and cancer on that card and now you have it. It's yours now." And he grabbed me by the pant leg and said, "I didn't." I said, "I can't help you. You go right ahead. That's up between you and God. You wrote your doom right on your card." and that you and that got him. That was all of it. He said, "When you came up, you had none of it and when you leave, you will have both of it." &gt;&gt; My point is that people thought, "I'm coming to church." You know, people are going to sing songs and we're going to have some specials and we're going to have regular service and regular church. That changed very, very quickly for him. That place became a dreadful place. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation, though you may not have recognized it always, that God is this God. &gt;&gt; That God is our God. I want to put you on notice. That God is the God we worship. &gt;&gt; That God is the God we listen to. &gt;&gt; That God has written his word, has spoken his word. That God sent a prophet. That God sent a message. Not his message, our message. He sent his message to us through that vessel. And that's what we want it. We want that God to guide this church. We want that God to guide the school. &gt;&gt; We want that guide that God to guide the camp or any effort &gt;&gt; and to guide the missions whatever. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to continue on here for just a moment, please. You're going to have to really pray for me. Is this all right? I just I'm determined not to get confused because there are certain things that I want to bring out to you. So that's why now we've gone. I want you to keep this compound thing in mind. There we are. Jacob's on a pile of stones. And now something has happened and he said this is a dreadful place. A woman a woman comes before brother Brandan and the woman is seriously ill and she's got something like an arthritis. He said, "I see her getting stiff and oh, I see a dark shadow moving in cancer." And that cancer now that was her experience. Jacob had his experience. I described it a wee bit to you. Tremendous family problems. There's not hardly a family here, but what you have family burdens. I want to announce to you and you receive it from me. God knows exactly every burden in every way. &gt;&gt; And this God has the bread that can dissolve that. [Applause] And you have to come to the place where you say whatever God does it's perfect. &gt;&gt; It's his will. &gt;&gt; It's not that's not fatalism. That's trust and perfect confidence in God. &gt;&gt; God knows about your youth. God knows about your life. God knows about your future. And he has it absolutely in control. And say, "I'm not going to try to make it work. I'm not going to try to fix it up. I'm not going to try to manipulate it. I just trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he says a dark shadow moving in cancer and that cancer is in the back or spine the shadow of death. when I'm detailing this and when you hear a quote like this, don't say, "Well, hey, you know, Brother Tom or brother John or them they're speaking a quote. Brother Ed is reading a quote." That's not it. It could be you &gt;&gt; and they could be saying, "Now, this is this is what you drove up and you had this and you've had an involvement or you've had a certain thing take place and you have this situation and this is your concern. This is what's weighing down in your heart. And I say God knows that. I can say that because I know that God knows every detail. &gt;&gt; And this is not a God that needs a whole bunch of assistance. This is a God that knows how to do things on his own. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you've been given up. Nobody wants to hear that. I just come in front of a preacher. I'm in a meeting. I This is a great me healing meeting. I'm coming here for I don't know exactly what it is, but here I am. And then you come into that presence and you know this is very different. Then you have a voice saying, "This is what's happened. You're hardening up in your spine. Your spine is hardening up." And uh and uh now I see cancer moving in. Didn't want to hear that. Suddenly a a wonderful place starts to be a dreadful place. And you've been given up and there's no hope for you. They don't want to hear that. You know, we come to church. We come and we hear the song leader lead the songs and we sing the songs and we're happy over the songs and we should be. But I want to tell you, if your problems exposed, it could become a dreadful place. And then we start to sherk. We want to cover it all up. No, no, no, no. Well, don't cover it up. That's when we say that's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; There's something wonderful about saying that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's my problem. &gt;&gt; One of the hardest things to say, but that's the thing to say. &gt;&gt; Bear the thing before Almighty God. Not before man necessarily, but he said at he said, "And you cannot be well. At least that's what they told you. That's the truth. If that's right, raise your hand. And he said, "Now the doctor has done all he knows how to do." There's nothing against him. A doctor's a kind, compassionate person are doing everything they know how to do. Right. &gt;&gt; And he says, "But the great physician is here." &gt;&gt; If I don't get anything else across to you, I desire that you may recognize a place that you come and sit or where you lay your head tonight and recall this message. And recall this statement, the solver of all dilemmas is present. And that's either the God that called you or if you've never been called, you need to be called. He's the one with the final answer. He's the one who has the solution. &gt;&gt; I'm not an accident of birth. I'm accident by I'm a birth by design. You recognize that? &gt;&gt; In God's great economy, he designed you. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking out of burden this morning. And some of you who perhaps least think that I have had you on my heart, I have you on my heart. There's young people here that I've been very very burdened for. See a direction that you're headed. God knows that. And God wants to stop you where you're at. You have may perhaps migrated here or immigrated. You may have come from other countries. You feel because you're from another country, it's essential to make a mark in the world. No, it's not. It's essential to be what you are &gt;&gt; and to be who you are &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. That's what's important. I'm just going to take my time and if I have to continue I'll do so at another time. For instance, brother be brother Brandham uses this example. For instance, please stay with me. Like it says in the Bible that out of Egypt, this is a very important point. That's why I want to go back to it. Out of Egypt have I called my son. Referring to Jesus. And if you run in the margin on that, you find out also referred to Jacob. When I saw that, I had to actually search it out to see how many times brother Brandham referred to that or was that just something that he had missed. Uh, excuse me. I'm not saying something that he had missed, but sometimes he uses a name that perhaps didn't refer to that person. And he said it referred to Jacob. Same scripture. Jesus. And when he said this, this become a heart of my message. That's why I really want your attention. Jesus was his greater son. Jacob was his son that he called out of Egypt, but Jesus was his greater son. And then I begin to see the compound meaning and the compound revelation. And I feel very very humbled right now because this is a message that has called out the greater woman. This is a message that revealed to me the greater son. I didn't know I didn't know that this son's name should be used in baptism. And many of you come here and you didn't know that either. Many of you have gone into this tank and you've been baptized in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost. A title, title, title. &gt;&gt; You weren't baptized in any name. A title, title, title. And three titles don't make a name. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you failed to know until God sent a prophet to pull the covers off and show that one of the greatest church organizations on earth where actually Satan crept in there. The same Satan that was in Eden, he crept into Eden and then he hid away and he took away the name of Jesus. They hated the name of Jesus to have the power that he has. All the power of heaven is invested in that name and we are baptized and we go to his death &gt;&gt; and we come up in his resurrection &gt;&gt; and we become the uh the vessels of of his life, &gt;&gt; his life in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he is the bread of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, some of your family, some of your associates, if they're even going to find eternal life, they'll find it in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; They'll see it in you. That's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; And we know that the preaching of the gospel, but it may be you might preach from him a servant without them even realizing it. And he says he was the greater son. Jacob was his son that he had called out of Egypt. Scofield makes that reference also. He said Jacob was called out and Jesus was called out. And so also all and so is it today. Jacob was called out. Jesus was called out. And you have been called out. Come out of her, my people, and be ye separate, sayaeth the Lord, and you've been called out. See you hand raised brother Joseph. I I thought of you. I thought of the people that came out of the colony. I thought of the you people that have come out of various colonies and so on. We don't know what kind of separation that was and the separation was severe. &gt;&gt; And when you came into his presence, it became a dreadful place. I have this decision. Do I leave people? You see people sitting here you forgive me but don't forgive me because there's a reality I I bearing burden with people I never forget the day. How am I to forget the day? I don't forget the day. And brother Joseph and sister brother Joe Walder and sister Eileene walked in to the log church and great tears coming down. Not that the tears moved, but it they couldn't be stopped and coming down Sister Eileen's face. And she said, "These are not tears of sorrow. These are tears of joy." And to think that they flew out about 1,500 miles with a shopping bag or a few things and they weren't allowed to take a thing. You talk about a separation, friend. &gt;&gt; And I can guarantee you the bread of life was worth it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just one taste of the bread of life. &gt;&gt; And we may look at it casually. It wasn't casual. Hearts were torn. &gt;&gt; Mother's heart was torn. &gt;&gt; Families hearts were torn. &gt;&gt; And that's the kind of thing that was taking place even in Jacob's life. God help me. Bethl today can be a far different place for you than the rest of the world. Now this was a pivotal I put this as a pivotal message. Jacob's experience is referred to in the present terms and in this message it is is this a sign of the end sir? Is this the sign of the end? That message and uh immediately following that within about 90 days is the angels say, "Well, there's all kinds of debate about the angels." Oh, bushwah nonsense. &gt;&gt; I couldn't care about all the debate of the angels. Were the seals preached? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And did they reveal something? Amen. Who cares about where they were? Were they at the top or were they at the bottom? Are they coming up? Are they going down? Or did they appear here? Are they didn't they appear on the on the 28th? I don't I couldn't care less about all of their sematics and detail and all their logistics. What I care about is that people say, "Well, we got to find the rocks where his head was and we got to we got to have this. We got to have that." and and Roman Catholic Church has the has the nails that were in his hands. That doesn't mean anything unless you have the blood that came from his side wash you and make you clean and make you a son of God and daughter of God and receive the same spirit that he received. &gt;&gt; Am I over your head? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And in this message, he said, "You are God." He's speaking in prayer now. You are God and there is no other but you. Receive us, Lord. I'm saying that. I I pray this as to myself. I pray it now for you. Receive us, Lord. Forgive us our sins. I'm repenting for all my unbelief, for all my in iniquity. I plead for the altar of God. I plea on the altar of God. This is a spirit of Elijah, God's prophet. As I come tonight with this little church and here you are and I included you in this prayer. As I come tonight with this little church before me, by faith we move from this building in rapture. As we sit together in heavenly places around the throne of God, our hearts have been warmed many times in the things that we've seen you do and unfold your mysteries to us. But Lord, tonight I'm all weary. Woe is me. And Jacob, when he saw those angels coming down the ladder and going back, he said, "This is a dreadful place, none other than the house of God." And there Bethl was established. There's something friends that I'm not able perhaps to convey to you. But the reason they call bread the staff of life I expect is because that is what it is. If you have bread physically that's wonderful. But this morning, spiritually throughout this entire building, you may be a visitor. You may be a stranger. There may be some that have journeyed here. You may be an old-timer. You're not old an old-timer anymore than I am. But I've come here this morning to eat of the bread of life. Do we want answers? Yes, we want answers. Do we need leadership? Yes, we need leadership. Do we need to be guided? Yes, we need to be guided. Which one of you young people don't need an answer? You all need answers. Yes, you need answers. Should I be doing this or should do you know what just uh I want to speak very directly. If you just commit your way to the Lord and set up a relationship with him and talk to him on a regular basis and tell him what he means to you. If you do that, it will be a lot better for you in life. And I will continue on with this. And there Bethl was established. God, people don't understand that. This is a prophet in prayer. Listen. And there Bethl was established. I hope you you've been so kind and you're giving me your attention. But I want you to hear what he says. God, people don't understand that. They think it would be so much joy. But Lord, what a weary. What a dreadful thing for a human being to come into the presence of a great mighty being of heaven. And I put in big letters, he is near. Because I had the confidence, I had the witness that he is near. You know, God has done some remarkable things in our lives, in our home, in our church, in your life. And I begin to go over the various lives of individuals. And I thought of some that are here that have been you young people. I I'd like to see your hat. Who has and who goes presently to BCA? May I just see your hands? Please raise your hands high. You have gone or you go. Anyone down here? Go to BCA. You have gone. Raise them up high so we can see them. God bless you. You know this. I thought of the people in this place that were on their knees working. the sisters that were working and and made a place. Maybe you don't think of it, but they made a place. They made a place where any any time I was able to be there, I thought we just make a place to keep these kids out of all those evil stories. and the kids of the world and there are things that they think are jokes and Satan wants to creep in and he wants to make them acquainted with you know the world and the ways of the world and the conversation of the world and I thought you know just every time we're able to do something just think I'm just batting him one I'm just socking him one just going to keep these kids out of his hands and keep them out of their grip. And you think that wasn't a wonderful thing? That was glorious to me. And I just began to thank God for the various families and God put it in the heart of different people to just do something. It It's not everybody, but it's somebody. And we all contributed one way or another, but one but all these little things maybe they seem so small to someone. someone just sends a a maybe a faith challenge report someplace or touches somebody's heart and maybe someone is streaming the service right now and we don't know exactly the meetings in Switzerland just keep coming up and I keep thinking about it and how how God I go back now I'm going back to Jacob but I go back in my mind to little things and little places that you stopped and you thought things over and uh you begin to see I have a I have a picture of myself but I don't even know who took it but I was just nailing some footings around where the old log church is going to sit. I'm not I'm just not lost in my memory. This isn't melancholy. This is things that happened. &gt;&gt; A lot of people worshiped there. A lot of souls baptized there. And and now I understand there's going to be some baptized tonight. Is that true? God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless those that are being baptized. That's why it's been built. That's why men labored. That's why people gave so that you could be baptized in a place in a place. And if God hasn't raised up this place, then let it collapse. &gt;&gt; Let it be for eternity or for nothing. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my burden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And why did the message come? So, are you all right for a little bit longer? &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to take you through a series of uh if we could just turn the screen down a little bit. I want to take you through the progression just quickly. We go from Jacob's experience. I want to take you through and it may not just be so wonderful. You say, "Oh, we we we quote things that the prophet of God has said and the things which he did." None of that quote is of any value unless it comes in a compound from 50 years ago or 60 years ago to you today. right today. &gt;&gt; I know this is different from my usual ministry. Can we just dim these lights up here a wee bit more, please? Abraham built an altar east of Bethl unto the Lord. This isn't a bunch of information now. This is just to take the progression of Bethl because I have something to say about it at the end. Abraham returns to Bethl to the place of the altar that he had made at the first and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord. I just want to say one thing. You that have sat perhaps at some place in this building and at some point in time you felt his presence and you felt very almost swallowed up or surrounded in his presence. I say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is not to be a single event. I say you have returned. You're here today. You have returned. But he had a certain specific thought in his mind. I will return there. I will go to that altar. I will go to the place where I made that altar or I made that consecration. And there Abraham called on the name of the Lord. It's not just enough to perhaps sit here and enjoy the presence, but say, "Oh God, I'm reaching out to you." &gt;&gt; In Genesis 28:19 is where we read today where Jacob slept and dreamed of a ladder reaching into heaven with angels ascending and descending. He was afraid and said, "How dreadful is this place? This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven. And he called the name of that place Bethl. That city was called at the first during this interval. Now here I need your full attention and I thank you for it. There's an interval and we often forget about the intervals. This interval was 20 years minimum 20 years. 20 years for where he had this experience. During this interval, Jab Jacob worked 14 years for his two wives, Rachel and Leah. Prospered in herds of sheep and cattle. had many difficulties and family problems. Many, many, many problems that you don't want in your family, but Jacob had them during this interval. and prevailing envy between his wives over ch childbearing disagreements with his father-in-law and brothersin-law had wages changed 10 times had very difficult partings Genesis 31 and13 God says I'm the god of Bethl nevertheless regarding Regardless of what was happening with Jacob, he said, "I'm the God of Bethl, where thou anointest the pillar, and where thou vowest a vow unto me. Now arise, and get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred." You want to stay very alert because I have I'm coming. I'm going to shoot the other wad right at the end. Genesis 35 and1. And God said unto Jacob, "Arise, and go up to Bethl, and dwell there, and make there an altar unto God, that that appeared unto thee when thou fled from the face of Esau thy brother." And 35 and3, "And let us arise and go up to Bethl," he says, "and I will be there. I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went. In 35 and 6 Jacob came to Bethl he and all the people that were with him. 35 and8 Deborah Rebecca's nurse died and was buried there at Bethl and Jacob 35 and 15 and Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him Bethl you see what things are happening this is an incredible place an incredible place and a prophet your prophet goes right back to that place and speaking of the atmosphere here and the kind of place that it was and that where it will always be and and here I am. I'm in this place. This is a message that you've received. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In 35 and 16 and there's three verses. And they journeyed from Bethl and there was but a little way to come to Ephroth. And Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, "Fear not, thou shalt have this son also. And it came to pass as her soul was departing, was in departing, for she died, that she called his name Benoni." Benoni. But his father called him Benjamin, son of the right hand. Benoni is the son of my sorrows. And he changed his name to Benjamin. Now Jacob had 12. This was after after Bethl. After he slept there. Now he has Benjamin. That's not history, friends. Now you have a message. The message that you love. The message that you dwell in. The message that you say is my call. The prophet of God is calling all the time and saying Joseph's heart burned for Benjamin. There was something yearning for young Benjamin. And that is that group, that last group of the Jewish people that will come. And the message is absolutely full of that. He's looking for Benjamin. Here we're sitting as Gentiles. Here we're sitting right now. But God's eye, he said that now the next thing is Israel. God turning to Israel. Turning from the Gentiles. We're Gentiles, friends. We're we're brothers. You're ministering. I'm I'm preaching this morning, but I want to say to this waiting people, we're a dying civilization. As far as God is concerned, God is turning from the Gentile or has turned from the Gentiles, as far as a massive movement is concerned to come to and and and to turn to the Jewish people. I heard on the radio last night or yesterday sometime you heard brother Brandham say it's three minutes to midnight and I heard that it's less than that &gt;&gt; and then they said that they the clock that has ticked closer to the destructive time this morning I think it was I don't listen to news but I think it was the last thing last night listen friends. They said that this morning. Yeah, that's where they they said that this morning they're going to have a program at 10:00 a.m. on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about the danger. how we have moved so close to the danger of a complete they weren't even saying world war but a total nuclear catastrophe. Friends, we're sitting here in our comfort and so on. You young people, it may not always be this way. You want to be anchored to the rock of ages. This is not a fear trip. This is reality. There's people here that have gone through very, very difficult times. People here who know what war is and they know what civil war is. And they know there are countries just a few miles away by air and you'll be there and you'll find it's been been destructive places. &gt;&gt; Some of you children, your father and mothers have come out of that. Others have not. has been just fine. But I find in the lives of these people, it went along fine for a season and then a difficulty came or death came and war came and famine came and starvation came. We want to be able to say, "You're the God. You're the bread that came from heaven. and you'll feed me whether I'm a widow in the famine or whether I'm living in the palaces of of Egypt as Moses did. &gt;&gt; We want to know that our God is God. &gt;&gt; We don't come here ceremoniously to church. We come here to feed upon the word of God, the eternal message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so she had the last son, Benjamin. Then Joshua, God's great general, fought battles even against Bethl. Oh, things are changing. The king of Bethl was one that Joshua captured. Oh, it's gone a long ways from Jacob having a rest and saying this is the house of God. Joshua's Judges 1 and 22 in the house of Joseph they also went up against Bethl and the Lord the Lord was with them. in Samuel. Prophet Samuel went in circuit each year to Bethl, Gilgal and Mispa and judged Israel. Things deteriorated under King Solomon. Israel was divided under two kings, Jerobom. And Jerobom was a son of Solomon's servant. and he was a mighty man of valor. And Riabom, who was Solomon's own son, and Solomon's own son only had two tribes, and Jeroboam had 10. That were the 12 tribes that was torn apart. And Jeroboam made two golden calves because he saw he saw, you know, how subtle this is. He he he reasoned politically. Well, if if there only one if there's only one calf or there's only one ark or there's only one temple and the people all go to Jerusalem because God preserved Jerusalem to Riaboam. And if they always go to Jerusalem, then their hearts are going to be drawn that way. Or if they always go to Cloverdale Bible way, their hearts will be or if they go to another church or if they go to someplace else, maybe their hearts will be there. We're not into politics, &gt;&gt; quite frankly. You go wherever you are fed. &gt;&gt; We're just not into politics. Not into politics. &gt;&gt; I detest politics. &gt;&gt; Politics corrupt something that's pure. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I believe a prophet says every government is of the devil. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. And if a government involves the military, involves a immigration, involves a economy, involves a taxation, involves Yeah, you'll find the enemy there someplace. But I'm not attacking that one. It's it's this is Satan's kingdom, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So he set up one and made two golden calves. Jeroboam did. and he set up one in Bethl and the other he put in Dan. In other words, if the people are down there, it's a little too far to go across the borders, etc., etc. It's too far and it's just too much headache. So, we'll just put one down there and make it more comfortable, make it more easy or or whatever it might be. I'm not making any fun. I'm not making any joke of anything. I'm just saying the the politics get in and say, "Well, we'll sooner have it this way so that it'll be easier for the people." It's not always the easiest way is the right way. And incidentally, friends, I probably can't preach it the way it should be preached, but the Bible is just rife with the phrase, "The sins of Jeroboam." That's right. &gt;&gt; And this was the son. &gt;&gt; It made it easy to worship. And then it says in Kings, "And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethl. And Jeroboam stood at the altar to burn." And he wasn't to be at the altar to burn to begin with. He wasn't a priest. He he was a king that had been put in charge. And he stretched out his hand when this man of God came in. Doesn't even name him. Stretched out his hand and his hand froze. And then he calls out if this man can pray for him so he can withdraw his arm. And Jerobom stood by the altar to burn incense. Now we have the wrong people. I can tell you friends, this may not be what you wanted to hear, but part of the ailment that even ails within the message is people behind the pullpit that are not called to be behind the pullpit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen one more time? And the congregation knows, they can sense that something's missing. And that's what's missing. It's not gifted people. is not people who have a flurry of words and that's not that's not the basis. The basis is that the burden of the word of the Lord is there to call those people and to feed those people. &gt;&gt; And that's what needs to happen. And the sons of the prophets try to persuade Elijah from following Elijah. And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethl. The sons of the prophets. These are sons of prophets that were at Bethl. They came forth to Elisha who had the spirit of Elijah upon him and said unto him, perhaps not yet the spirit of Elijah in the same way because he's following Elijah. and knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today? And he said, "Yay, I know it. Hold your peace." In other words, don't detain me. Don't dis don't Don't Don't restrain me. I'm following Elijah at a very desperate time. I don't know if this is meaning anything to you, but I say to these people and naysayers and whatever more, don't don't try to stand in my way. I have a call of God and I must follow this uh spirit, this spirit of Elijah. Are you feeling that way, friends? Are you convinced? Are you feeling that way? &gt;&gt; And God finally speaks. This is in the prophet Amos. But seek not Bethl, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersa, uh, for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethl shall come to not. is a picture of Bethl. Your elder people, your mature people, you can shut this down now. It's not being ready for the wonderful moments, but it's being being prepared for difficult &gt;&gt; difficult times. Are are you preparing us for difficult times? No. If they happen to come to you, if they happen to come to you, say, "Oh, this message say okay. Uh, what are you what are you trying to say, brother Biscll?" This is what I'm trying to say. the uh the compound meaning I find where the word of God had glorious and wonderful beginnings. I'm not done. I'm going to take my time just a few more moments. Had wonderful beginnings and I felt very very burdened to take you directly. I took I spent probably the last two weeks taking this Bethl nothing house of God's bread. This is the gate of heaven. This is the house of God. And take it through. Are you listening friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And take you all through the scripture until finally God says, "Don't pray for it anymore. I'm done with it." He's not done. He's the God of the message, &gt;&gt; right? He's not done with the message. What the people made out of it. &gt;&gt; We're not here and we're we're standing against that. People want to make it some some glamorous big thing and whatever more. You understand? And but I'm I'm I've got a very important thing. Please stay with me now. Very close. Don't let your mind get weary. And God allowed that. Jacob didn't even know how to pray for that moment. He didn't know how to pray for that. He didn't know how to ask all his problems. He has you. You You've got something here. Just like saying, "You got the blessing of the birthright." Oh, wonderful. Now, all he has is trouble. His brother hates him. His brother wants to kill him. He's running for his life. uh big problems in the family. The mother helped him to deceive this his brother and all of these things. I I got the blessing. I got the birthright. Oh, I got the message. He certainly did have. I'm glad that you're real quiet. Says, "Oh, we got the message. We got the message. This is what the prophet did. This is what he said. this is where he went and all these things and we all get caught up in all of those things and oh, we're going to put it on the desk. We're going to put it in a book. We're going to translate it and we're going to do all of these things and we all get all caught up in those things and people finally get it and groups are established and evangelism's going on and then then then it's this way then it's a broadcast then it's a you know whatever and it's it starts to take on the appearance of just what to come out of And finally, it it if you just let something go, that's why you have to have the kind of ministry you have. You have something go, it has to just keep chopping, keep chopping, keep moving the people and and don't don't have any resistance to it. Just say, "God, thank you for a clear word. Thank you for burdened men. Thank you, oh God, that you deal with us as children. Thank you for chastising us when we need chastisement. Thank you, oh God. Thank you for feeling the weight. &gt;&gt; We're going to follow you in the heat. We're going to follow you in the good times and in the bad times. We're going to follow you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then when it came to that, see there was a time when the church world, you know, everything was setting missionaries everywhere and doing all those kind of things. It got built up into churches, then into Bible schools and setting out all kinds of ministers and setting them out whether they were called or uncalled or not called. We're just sending them out and we did every kind of every possible way. I mean, we had new inventions and television programs and whatever more. I was with the prophet. He he arrived. He said, "I just come through Tulsa." He said, "And I was in uh I went to visit Oral Roberts." And he said, "I was in his office. Oh my." He went like this. Oh my. He said, "That was such a such a place." He he was describing the ceiling kind of aluminum strips or something on the ceiling and he said what a place. He said he said it would cost uh you know hundreds of thousands of dollars perhaps a day just to keep the operation going. He said I he said I wouldn't even know what to do with a thing like that. I wouldn't know what to do. He said just said, "I'd be out of my mind trying to support something like that." &gt;&gt; And he and then he said, "I I I I think I have a a chair and a desk in in my office." And what was in my heart is just give me the chair in the office. Give me that little desk. We don't need some big elaborate thing and things going on. That's why you may wonder you come into the office and so on. Come into the church. I'm happy, brother Matthew. Every time I'm using a washroom or washing my hands, I'm just so thankful to you and all the brothers and team that worked and uh made it so nice. We're we're glad for that. We're glad for that. &gt;&gt; But that is not our focus. That is not our focus. We try to keep things simple and want to keep things humble. Want to keep things so that God is pleased with it. &gt;&gt; But I still think God's word and God's message requires the best. &gt;&gt; That's just in our heart is the very best. &gt;&gt; Do I have a few more moments? &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God saw this is what happened when Bethl come to its end. Don't even pray for Bethl anymore. Then you say, "What's the answer to this? What is the answer? You think that people there was no more God's people?" Yeah, there were God's people. They were just crushed. &gt;&gt; Now, what do we Now what do we do? And then there was a baby born. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His name, you shall call his name Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For he'll save his people from their sins. Here come a ray of light. Here come a little bit of hope. And here come But he didn't come the way anybody thought he was going to come. And he comes and finally one day he says, "I'm the bread &gt;&gt; that came down from heaven." &gt;&gt; And they they had to wake up and say, "Well, what we've heard in what we've heard in the priests, what we've heard in the synagogue isn't right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we hear he's the bread that came down from heaven. And they're calling him a fanatic. And they're calling him this, calling him that. I I'm I'm I'm perhaps going slow, but just going slow so you'll get it in your mind. I'm the bread that came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we come. I'm just leaving that. Now, I'm coming to our age. I'm taking another compound meaning. And here we are. We've gone all the way from Jacob. Now, here we are. And the churches, they have the Dian council and they have all these council. We won't even t take time to talk about it. And the and the church and great churches and whether it be orthodox or whether it be and there's finally one denomination after another till they have so many denominations and then you talk about the ecumenical. Maybe you folks don't know what ecumenical means. You know what it means? They're coming together. How do you get strength from uniting weaknesses? &gt;&gt; How do you come up with a correct answer from just putting together all your mistakes? &gt;&gt; And all your questions. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Frank. It's just impossible. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm not I'm not a smart guy. I'm a simple guy. guys looked at all his all his ecumenical invited to the ecumenical this and ecumenical that and we'd like to interview you from the ecumenical newspaper and so on. I said, "Well, you can interview me, but you cannot print just part of it. You have to print it all." And they wanted to question me on the Godhead. And so I went all through the scripture and when I was before I was done, I said, "Where did you people even get the Trinity?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, then they start backpedaling. &gt;&gt; You know what? They didn't print any of it cuz I put them on notice. You can't print just part of it. You have to print it all. And in the midst of that, here's little people. I know because I can speak from the burden of my heart. Saw all these things taking place and saw great manifestations of the Holy Spirit. saw things happen that haven't even maybe happened in this church or in the in in the amongst the message believers. And yet and yet I see there's a quality a distinct quality uh quality of the word a quality of revelation. What what is revelation? Revelation's when you see something, you experience it. It's so real, you can't take it away. Try and tell Jacob he didn't have that dream. Try and tell the people of of William Brandham's day you weren't in that kind of meeting. Try to tell me I wasn't in that. &gt;&gt; Try to tell me I wasn't sitting and seeing those things that I didn't see the blind girl that I wasn't in Tacoma and and saw Indian boy called out about 10 12 years old and he totally blind and received his sight. I saw him walking to the water fountain the next day or two. Try and tell me I wasn't enemy. Of course, we're in that meeting. But are we following this because of that? No. Because the word of God opened up. Uh I mean friends, you you some of you perhaps don't know what the serpent seed the serpent seed when I came to that was a dreadful place. &gt;&gt; Not a dreadful doctrine. a dreadful place to come to when you discover everything you put your faith in and your confidence in and you've gone to church and you've sang songs and you've worshiped with the people and then suddenly that's all stripped away. &gt;&gt; How many know what that means? And the prophet of God from hundreds of thousands, so many in Bombay, they can't get near the place. Durban, South Africa, so many Houston, Vernon, British Columbia, thousands of people lined up. I stood there lined up as a young fellow your age, 14. I stood in a lineup four deep. Thought I'll never get into this building. Try to tell me you didn't you didn't experience I experienced that. Now here we come. We toodel in and park our car and if it's raining we can go into Port Kosher and come in and things are nicer. We don't want to make sure they're nicer. We want to make sure they're better. We want to make sure that the spirit of whom I speak of, the God of Jacob, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob is in this place &gt;&gt; meeting with the people, talking to the people, and that the people are are are responsive and they're ready not just to say amen, but they're saying, "I give myself to that. I surrender myself. &gt;&gt; And they said he called upon the name of the Lord. I want I wanted to find out what they called. And the Bible says the call is the call out on the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I saw Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And they made an altar. They didn't just make an altar and whisper a prayer. They called out on God. &gt;&gt; Oh God. God of my fathers. And I say the God that sent the pillar of fire. The God that spoke out of a tree and said to a boy, "Don't defile your body in any way. When you're when you're older, you'll have a work to do." I want to say, "Oh, God, I'm part of that work that he had to do." He had to speak to me. He &gt;&gt; had to speak to a people. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has he spoke to you? &gt;&gt; That's what I want to know. Has he spoke to you? &gt;&gt; Has he opened up his word to you? Have you felt him? &gt;&gt; I have felt him. I know that he's near. &gt;&gt; I know that he's near to speak. I know that he's here to say something. I've seen people's lives changed. Transformed. Totally transformed. &gt;&gt; He's taken the weak. &gt;&gt; He's taken the feeble. He's maybe taken those that are illiterate or those that are wise. He's taken us Oh friends, we're failures, but we're success in his &gt;&gt; in his sight. &gt;&gt; And God let uh uh Israel go down into such deterioration and degradation. God even said, "I turned from her. Don't say anything more about Bethl, about the house of God." Why? Cuz there was another one rising. There was another sun rising. It was called Jesus Christ. And then he ended up hanging on a cross for the sins of the world. And the people didn't understand. Believers didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; And they fled and they hid, but they still believed it. And the prophet of God said, he said it over and over. And this must be a lesson to us. They did not understand it. They could not understand it. And they could not explain it, but they believed it. There are things about this message I cannot understand. And there's things about this message that I cannot explain. But there's things those same things I believe. &gt;&gt; And you don't believe because you're gullible. You believe because there's something in here that's saying it's true. It's true. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is true, friends. &gt;&gt; It is true. I'm speaking with conviction. And then came a time and I lived in the time. I know something about the confusion of the time. If you want to ask me, I can describe it for you. I can tell about when the church world went into such chaos, such confusion. They asked me and my wife and our daughters would we come to this meeting. There was a kind of a strange move. I had been introduced. I'd been introduced to the message. I'd seen the prophet of God. But friends, let me say something. I don't want you to misunderstand it. But we saw miracles. Not not just in the message. We saw miracles. And you have to understand something. You have to understand the message. The prophet of God says that faith faith is a law &gt;&gt; and people exercise faith. He says women will come up before him and a godly sainted sister misses it. Right. &gt;&gt; And a prostitute comes up and gets it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's not our kind of mathematics, but that's God's kind. I got a law &gt;&gt; and you believe me, you'll get it. &gt;&gt; You're sick, you have a law. And that's why many times Catholic people get healed so quickly because they simply believe it. or native people. You go to around the native Indian people and they just believe it and you pray for them and they have all kinds of miracles that happen. That's miracles is not the thermometer. Miracles is not the examination. And so we saw the miracles happen. So I've seen miracles happen there and I see him in William Bran's meetings and so on and so forth. But he said the sign has a voice. He also said that. So we begin to listen to the voice and oh that took us all took took a few of us on a very different direction. &gt;&gt; We're following a voice now. &gt;&gt; That's different. Would I trade the voice for the miracles? Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's bread. I declare to you I have encountered the solver of questions. &gt;&gt; I declare to you that he is present here. &gt;&gt; I declare to you that you can meet him here. &gt;&gt; And you can commit your life to him here. &gt;&gt; This place can become a wonderful place and this place can become a dreadful place. But whatever God chooses, give yourself to this place or not a not a church building, but this place where God identifies and says, "I'm present. &gt;&gt; I'm present. &gt;&gt; I'm here to do what you think's impossible to do." Listen, friends, we do not want to continue on week after week and month after month and year after year with the same insoluble problems. I want you to take a hold of that problem and say, "God, you're the answer. &gt;&gt; You're the solution." &gt;&gt; He knows what it is to be a teenager. &gt;&gt; I know some of you teenagers going through struggles. He knows what it is to be a teenager. &gt;&gt; He knows what it is to be mistreated. He knows what it is in a country to be considered illegitimate. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'm not inferring that anyone is. I'm inferring that he bore it all. &gt;&gt; He knows what it's all about. You say, "Well, I'm unique." It's nothing unique. He suffered it all. He bore it all. &gt;&gt; He knows what what it's all about. Listen friends, there isn't a complex in the world. There isn't a complex that you bear that he hasn't got the solution. Not up in the future right here now. This is a place. This is why I'm preaching. This is a place. This is a moment. People say, "Well, you don't understand what I've been through. You don't understand what I've been through either." We're not talking about those things. We don't want sympathy. &gt;&gt; We don't want accolades. We just simply want to be brothers and sisters. I so respected that man of God stand there in his humility. Stand there and know that the people across the street, they didn't want to walk on the same side of the street as William Brham did or the Brandham family. They didn't have a good name. God brought them out of that. &gt;&gt; You know why? There was a greater ministry. &gt;&gt; Do you know why I'm preaching now? There was a greater work. You know why? There was a greater voice. There was a greater message. And the message was a call. A greater call. Not one from back there. Not one from Pentecost, but one of today. A greater call for a greater woman. &gt;&gt; Now it's the wife. &gt;&gt; It's the wife. We had an announcement of of sister Naomi and brother Justin. But this is a greater call than any man is almighty God saying to his son and his son says in the message of saying to him, "Go get my son a wife." &gt;&gt; And he said it wasn't easy. &gt;&gt; He sweated it out &gt;&gt; until he found character. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you people are here. He found character. &gt;&gt; He didn't find the mess of your life. He found character. &gt;&gt; We've been in all kinds of messes. We've been all kinds of defeats and difficulties, but he looked for character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God, brother Daniel. He found character. &gt;&gt; He searched over Congo, pulled you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He searched over the countryside. He searched over the Pacific Northwest. And here we are, friends. We're testimonies to his grace &gt;&gt; because he's searching a greater woman, &gt;&gt; a greater message, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; A greater voice. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And a greater s and a greater woman. &gt;&gt; I must call her. I must call her. And some of you came from the maybe came from the Philippines. I don't care where you came from. You come from the Congo, you come from Africa, wherever you come, that has that's irrelevant to me. And wherever you come, say, "Well, my folks moved." I say, "Brother West was from Arizona and so on. Some of you come from all different places." Yes. Did you come because we have nice weather? No, &gt;&gt; we don't have good weather. Do you come because everything is nice and the economics are nice? No. It's tough. It's hard. I've even told people to stay away. But somehow friends, if you have a diet, you have a something craving inside and you've got to have a certain diet. You got to have a certain kind. And one thing I do know and I say to the brothers that minister here, I desire with all my heart and soul, and I've said it so many times to the brothers, and we pray it in this study. We pray it because we believe it. Feed the sheep. Feed the sheep. &gt;&gt; Feed them on what? The bread. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; This became its &gt;&gt; Bethl. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not a pile of stones, but this became a Bethl. Not a fancy place, but this became Bethl. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm not at all ashamed that this started in a house. It's not the house. It's not this place. There's no other place. But I sat on on planks that were unplaned, on blocks of wood. And I thought, "Oh my, even when I was sitting there, oh my, wouldn't a bank manager like to see me now, here I am with all these young people and street people and street fighters and bike riders and whatever more they were. But God was there [Applause] &gt;&gt; from a messed up life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From a messed up life. And now we come from different countries. We come from across the ocean. We come from different languages. We come from all kinds of different places. But I want to say one thing. God called you here. You've had all kinds of circumstances. God called you here. God arranged for you to be in this service. God arranged for you because he wants you to know that there is no difficulty outside of God's control. And we want to be a church of faith. &gt;&gt; We believe it. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, my situation's impossible." I say to you, in the name of the Lord, nothing shall be called impossible with God. Nothing shall be called impossible with God. Say, "Well, I don't see how it's going to happen." You don't see, but he knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May we give glory to God. &gt;&gt; We come to this place &gt;&gt; where the altar has been built &gt;&gt; and the altar has been restored. Our prophet's message has restored it and we say glory be to that God. &gt;&gt; What do you think about it first? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We think about is it the truth? Yeah, maybe somebody needs to let go. Let go. Is God dealing with something to let go? Let go of that complex. Let go of that difficulty. Some people don't get healing. Don't take me wrong. But some people may not get healing because they're busy talking about their disease and sickness all the time. &gt;&gt; We're not here to glorify that. &gt;&gt; We're here to glorify the healer. &gt;&gt; My Jesus carried it all. &gt;&gt; My Jesus, there isn't a chain that he hasn't broken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've come here from cages of the devil. &gt;&gt; Where Satan has held us, but we're free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're free. Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel very very exercised at this moment. You're free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You should be able to raise your hand like that, young man. I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Glory be to that God. We've come into this place to meet that God &gt;&gt; and that is we do not come here in vain. We come here with a purpose. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You come in here tonight with having had prayer. Say, I'm expecting, oh God, you shall move the man of God tonight. You shall move the word in him &gt;&gt; and he shall scatter out the word and we are here to partake. [Music] Oh God, &gt;&gt; if you feel to stand and be included in a prayer, we're going to include everybody. But if you feel to stand, I've come to a decision. I come to deciding place. I don't need you to stand, but perhaps you need to. Oh, Father. Oh, Father God, it's not so important that we love you, but that you love us. &gt;&gt; You love us, oh God. Yeah. The people have heard many times in different ways of how honored and privileged we are. But even more than that, Lord, we can never we can never fully assimilate and get in our mind. You had us in your mind. You had us in your mind. As a songwriter says, when you hung on the cross, you had us in your mind. You had me in your mind, Lord. And I just couldn't find the answer. Searched everywhere. Searched everywhere. Traveled many places. But you had you had the answer all the time. You were just waiting till that hunger matured. And perhaps, oh God, in the hearts and the lives of the individuals that I've searched here and I've searched there and I've kept searching. I kept calling out and you were with me, beside me, near me all the time. Lord, I want to say, oh Lord Jesus, come very near. Come very near to us. I need you. We need you. The congregation needs you, oh God. Those that are streaming need you. Go out, I pray, Lord. How we thank you for what you've done and what you're doing in Switzerland and the precious people that I'll never never ever can forget how you spoke. You spoke of the wounded ones and how you sent healing. The bread of life came near. &gt;&gt; The eternal bread of And now they've come. They've come from so many countries over 20 countries. They've come. We're not enthused about the gathering so much of the people, but we're enthused that hungry people can come and eat of the bread of life and find find that their answers are their questions are answered and their souls are fed. Lord, the people stand today. We are in a place, Lord, some of us may have a dilemma. We're not going to walk out the doors with this dilemma. We're going to say, "Here it is. I lay it down at your feet. I'm laying it here now. Oh God. Oh God, you're the God of Abraham. You're the God of Isaac. You're the God of Jacob. You're the God that answers all questions. You're the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. You're the God of the prophet of God of William Brham in this age. You're the God, oh Father, that wants to be looked upon. Lord, I sense that people are curious about that. But you're the living God. &gt;&gt; You're our God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We look to you. Come amongst us now, Lord Jesus, and confirm it, I pray. Do confirm it, oh God. Would you sing with me, Brother Ryan? I'm thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice. [Music] I am thy ro. I have heard thy voice and thy love to me. I long to rise every [Music] faith, oh God, &gt;&gt; and be closer [Music] to thee. Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. Bless you Lord to the cross where thou [Music] draw me nearer nearer nearer blessed Lord to thy preious Justing [Music] come now. Just now Lord thy thy service [Music] and let my soul Hear this prayer, oh God, &gt;&gt; and my will be in love. [Music] Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to the cross where thou [Music] draw nearer nearer nearer blessed Lord to thy preious leading [Music] We're going to close this part of the service in prayer. I pray that he will linger very near you. I pray for you young men, men of the congregation that you'll settle it in your heart. you're going to live your life to be a glory to this God [Music] is that God isn't somebody is way off in the distance. God is here. He's the same one who said this is Bethl. This is my house. He's not talking about some corrupted sand doom. He's talking about a living place to living people saying to this congregation throughout this congregation speaking to you, this calls for more than just a church. This calls for more [Music] than association. [Music] This calls for something more. God bless you. Young people, I say to you, give you a charge in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You carry on with this that God has done and let your life be a true witness of the true vine. Jesus said, "I am the vine." Be a true witness of that vine. Let your life be a true witness. And anything that might unhinder the thing, anything that might hinder, you may not understand that, but anything that might hinder, I curse it in the name of Jesus Christ. God curses it in the name of Jesus Christ. Nothing shall hinder the work of God. [Music] And it will be said that she is a glorious church without spot. Somebody has to be without spot or wrinkle. Not by the world, not by the human view, &gt;&gt; but by the supernatural view of Jesus Christ. So you've been loyal to me. You've loved me. In spite of it all, you've loved me. That means more than everything, anything. God bless you. I want to have just a word of prayer. Father, how I thank you for the people that are here, the people that are streaming, part of this service. They have participated in. They have been the hearers of the word. And now, Lord, I send them from this place that they might be the doers of the word. We are not hearers only, but we are doers of the word. I pray that you will take every man, woman, and child within the sound of my voice and in this sanctuary that this might indeed be, oh God, Bethl, the place of God's bread, God's house, not this wooden structure, but the human structure. These bodies that you have built, we give them to you in total surrender. We say, "I am thine, O Lord, and I have heard thy voice." And now, Lord, because we are yours and we've heard your voice. We pray that you will follow us, be with us, &gt;&gt; as we have need of. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that every person will have met you in a special way in Jesus name. We dismiss you. God bless you each one. You're dismissed and free to go. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music]
