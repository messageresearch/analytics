TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he that is in the world and he that's in you he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now and the the 28th chapter of St Matthew and the 21st teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you Lord I Am With You Always even to the end of the world now text for that tonight I would like to use this as a text he that is in you and on this I wish to build faith of course for a prayer Serv and J just this quick now it is as I told you I like to post you on events that have taken place and I usually wait until I come to the The church here to say the event and then if others like to hear it they can pick up to the tape but I'll wait till I'm here and there is at least to this event that I'm going to tell you about just now there's several man here that's witness of these Christian Brothers one that was present was brother Banks wood another that was present was Brother David wood another that's present year was brother Evans and his son Ronald another was present is our notable Deacon brother wheer and another present was brother man is brother man here from New Alia a Methodist preacher that I baptized in the name of Jesus Christ just recently he was there also when this happened it's been for some time for a few years that I have had a deep burden on my chest that I in my heart it fell to me as if I had done something wrong and I searched my life over and over and over to see what was wrong Lord if if I've done anything wrong then you just reveal it to me what's wrong and I'll go and make it right but nothing would be revealed to me I say did I hurt somebody did I leave something undone have I do I read enough do I pray enough and I read and pray and and I I think reveal it to me did I harm somebody somewhere if I did I'll make it right just show me I don't want this burden and for the last 5 years since I come off the field there's been a burden hanging in my heart I've went to the mountain I've went to the seaside I've went everywhere and prayed and prayed and prayed and it just wouldn't let up and I thought of everything if I done anything but it still it wouldn't let up I was just in bondage on it's very strange that this would be lifted just at the time this message come forth other morning now wasn't God holding back for this I don't know see I these things is all in my mind you can imagine what's in a man's heart when you put up with that to think of what is taking place and know to tell the people KN that some will get the wrong slint and some will go this way and that way and you know how it is some will bleed and some won't but that's what you have to put up there how can you say it without hurting how can you say it that it'll take effect how can you say it to show the people that you're not not picking on man that you love them how can you be strict and firm and yet be loving and how you going to present War me if I don't present it see and there you are see it no wonder it keeps you N I had come down from from come up from Arizona to meet a bunch of bre here that go hunting with me up in Colorado each year now some people have wondered why do you go hunt what makes you go see here you are filling up I'm emptying out there I'm filling up so I can't empty out see now I don't go just to shoot game while people anyone here that goes with me knows that I pass b h that had a game and never even touch it I don't I hear out Longo I've begin to shoot game for the Christian businessman when go to say Billy get me a bull get me a cow get me elk get me this or that I'd go out and just shoot game from right and left the Lord helped me so I could see and find game and pretty fair shooting get them and and uh they just sit around talk about their business then the Lord told me not to do that no more and I I felt bad about it so I promised him I wouldn't do it no more you know I said if it's emergency and somebody needs it I'll do it but if they don't need it I won't do it just that man they got plenty of money to buy beef and stuff so why should I do that let the animal live if you're not really to use so I just go to be Al woman and any man that ever goes hunting with me knows I don't hunt with anybody I brought you myself to get along I go with them to have fellowship at night stand around and pray and so forth but there was many other ministers there there was up in the mountain this year was our brother Palmer I believe I saw him somewhere while here he is sitting here brother Palmer and a brother Bob Lambert he was here this morning I heard him shouting somewhere I guess he's still here and then there was a brother the two Martin boys I guess they here are they Martin boys brother the brother martin you call me the other day that was good that boy was healed that brother Minister are you here the one I prayed for on the phone the other day uh forget his name from down to Arkansas there wife call me man is all swelled up in the side and high fever dying the same man it was called out down at the The Little Rock or the hot springs meeting setting in the meeting and it's a fine looking pH I guess he won raise up not at all but uh I forget his name I can't think of his name Blair brother Blair somebody well now sitting in the meeting at Little Rock how many was that me the H spring how many is that the meeting and the Holy Spirit called that young fell and told him that the devil was trying to get him to renounce me to say I was a false prophet and the man witnessed it was the truth you see what the devil is doing the man don't go to doctors he don't believe him going to doctor but the Satan knew this disease is going to strike him he could kill him right now see so he TR again to renounce me and the Holy Spirit and Grace called him out and told him not to do that the man being a stranger called him not to do that and the other night his wife called me and said brother Bram I believe his D said it it all swelled out his fever is out of his head Mar and so the last thing he said call Brother brand I said have you got anything your purse with the hand no I in toon she was in Arkansas and I said got she said I'll be your scar I said now put your hand on the scar and hold reive other hand and I prayed and asked God to be merciful and to renounce that enemy and she went and laid the scarf on the man and the next morning he called me and about 24 hours or less than that our precious brother I haven't seen tonight yet brother Roy R and once you know brother Roy a military man if he's here I hope you understand because I'm not condemning that but everything's sted he a sergeant in the Army you know and you have to kind of get used to handling man like to do in the Army well these spiritual things were somebody else not him but the Lord spared him he would have been dead laying off for dead for a long time the Lord healed him he saw it ever since but all this spiritual stuff he didn't know about in vision and you're not long ago many know the vision that was here to go to Roy even before I went out there I didn't see me stand up on the mountain there and that light and the voice coming from me that took all down from Brother Ro and the other night he was stricking in such a place until he was so sick and got some high and fever and stuff and the doctor had give him medicine everything and then it didn't do no good and he even become to a place that he couldn't even move his Stu anymore his legs and things like par and the poor little brother been shot to Pieces was SEL from 88 German 88 and it it was just

hour the Bieber is gone he's in the kitchen hunting something deep amen what I'm trying to say don't never lose your confidence don't let Satan tell you evil about me cuz he's much but you keep that confident because if you don't it won't happen don't look to me as a man I'm a man I'm full of mistakes but look to what I'm saying about him him as we were in Colorado as we were up there we went back and been real dry gain with Spirit brother wheeler the Lord blessed him and gave him a fine Trophy and we so happy about that first time he's ever would H and the Lord blessed me and then I had shot a big trophy that I had looked for for 20 years been watching been after him for a long time and when I did shooting my rifle in down in the hot country bring up into a cold it swell the stock on grass B and it shot it several inches of and hit the animal standing between trees or it the hitting lower than which would have humanely killed the animal in a second but it hit him so high he jumped like he fell like that Billy was with me and he said I got him I thought of did to but when we went over there it wasn't so he said you hit a tree I look up now there's no mark on the tree and then I went to searching for and then there come a warning sign there was practicly a 100 men just above us brother Palmer is a witness of that and brother Evans that's right he was there brother Welsh Evans and his boy Ronnie I'll be like told him and great loads of men had went up above us what they call the cow stamp up there where the cowboy stays and rid keeps the cows separated I used to stay in that camp myself and bird goost cattle and keep them apart and then um so in there there's about 100 men but anyone knows in that country when a blizzard is forecast you better get away right now that's why brother Palmer and them left early because they only had a three-speed Transmission in their car and they had to get out there because whether you're there and you I stay for a week so they said there is a blizzard coming the forecast the papers the radio Lo after Lo practicly everything from up around in there left out they're gone right now CU they know to get out of there but my brethren had two dear license and they they didn't want to go so um I said well we'll stay but I had a meeting coming up in about six days and I had to go back to tucon so my little wife I we've been married 22 years and 20 years on our anniversary I've been up there every time just be so I I got a little place I always walk out and pray and it look like a place where I Tucker you know I made kind of a little thing you know I didn't have enough money to take the hunting trip and the honeymoon so I kind of tck my wife on a hunting trip for the honeymoon in New York I remember helping up over logs and things get to a place and I got a little place out there I always think think cover when to go there on our anniversary October 23rd it's when season's open now in 20 years I haven't been home always up there so that day was our anniversary and brother man I said now if you better not get to the fire that morning now if that night letter if you all want to stay now remember we may be in here for a month cuz I've seen 20 foot of snowfall just a little overnight just you go out there and you just is dry and nice the next morning snow as this me or maybe over top of your te so then I said and then you stay there so that so you're about 15 to 20 miles back in the wilderness and so then I said if he gets emergency of course they stand in helicopters and get out but usually they just nobody perishing they just have to wait there so everybody scat this as soon as they hear that broadcast a forecast rather so we were back there and I said now you make up your mind if you want to stay I'm here to hunt with you and I'll call my wife and tell her happy anniversary but I said then in that I will also so uh we will we will get some groceries cuz we might have to stay in here without a bread D now I don't want to see any more Flapjacks for a long time I'm P so then i' been eating in the Canada for about 21 days and I sure had a fill of in and so then I want to get some bread so they said they wanted to stay so was need to stay but brother man and I went out and we went down there and I got the groceries and I called the wife and the phone wouldn't answer I one answer so I waited about an hour till we got the grocery shop went back called she didn't answer I had to call Sister Evans I'll be sister Evans is here and I told yeah brother Evans sister Evans is here so I called sister Evans for brother Evans and told him she said I'll call Sister Brandon and tell her a happy anniversary of course you know so but she's gone shopping to get some groceries for the children and then we come back and the next morning what was in the skies but clouds it had rained up there all fall and it was really dry and it to prolong the hunting season a few days EX on count of the dry well I said to the brother that morning now the first zapper rain starts to fall the first snow the first sleep anything take for the camp just as hard as you can because in 15 minutes you can't see your hand before you see and it'll just twist and blow and I don't care how well you know the country you you're going to stay right there and you'll perish because sometimes you can't even breathe sleep blowing so you die right there I said as soon as it starts with that seat you take for the camp just as hard as you can I don't care where you are well I said go up here and set these gules and I'll climb way high and roll rocks over the hill and so forth to Ste the deers off the top and run them down you pick out what you want so I started climbing High by the time I got up the where we call the saddle a little place there that always cross over to go to a place called Quaker knob right on a continental divide there way high and when I got to almost this little saddle the clouds are getting blacker and Blacker wasn't it car left just us up there and the cowboy on stand so it got it got worse and worse so in a few minutes it started raining well I took my gun and put it under my coat keep the SC from smoking up and and stocked it in wet where running to bear or something coming back so I I help my scope like that and sat down under a tree a little bit I sat there and praying I said Lord God you're the great Jehovah I love you how many experiences if I had I pointed out to the brother brother Palmer the places where the eagle you know I see rise up that day you know how that's the place is we all taking place now it's a temperamental thing to me in there I've had so many great experiences with my Lord up in that mountain so you just can't go there without seeing he's just everywhere so then as I sat there then the Sleep started in the wind twisting like that and I said well I'd hold the way down but I better get off of here right now so I said it look down and I couldn't even see the bottoms no more then Cloud just whiring and twisting and feet of blowing and there it was the blizzard forecast for several days a big blizzard coming brother Tom is your brother Tom Simpson coming down from Canada heard the forecast and he was advised not to go through that part of the country because this forecast said it'll be blizzard where are you brother prom H think that yeah right there and um the blizard was coming everybody's done studying for well I put my gun back under my shirt like this my red shirt started walking down the mountain and as I started I got about a half a mile from the saddle and oh my those big drops of snow right that the wind twisting up on that mountain and blowing I couldn't see the bottom no more I see about 20 ft in front of me at 30 I know to come right down this little what we call Little hog back little Ridge and I come off to the creek then I know to follow the creek where to go to if it got real bad and so then I started down and got about halfway down there and something said to me just as plain as you hear me stop and go back I thought what was I thinking about maybe it's just my mind and I just couldn't make another step forward David had fixed me a sandwich that morning I think he tried to get eat with it for fixing his daddy one one time of onion and honey that's all we had so he fixed me a baloney and oh I don't know what all it was R in there I had it in my shirt it done got wet through my shirt I thought I'll just stop and eat this and maybe I'll you'll be all right now so I pulled out the sandwich about 10:00 and I started eating the sandwich and as I eat the sandwich I thought now I'll be all right and I started to move on but something said go back where you come from go back to that storm a half a mile or more back up the mountain into that dark Timber where you can then hardly see as far as that bargain but I'm getting to be an old man and I've been a Christian now for 33 years and I know no matter what how ridiculous it seems mind the Lord he what the Lord said and I turned and went back to the sabath feeling my way back all sleep getting harder and harder getting darker and darker and I sit down there and just put my coat up like this and my shirt on the scope again that I thought what am I doing here why would I come back up here and I just waited a few minutes and I started to get up again and just as plain as I ever want to here a voice said I am the creator of heavens and earth I make the wind and the rain I took off my head I said great Jehovah is that you he said I was the one who made the winds to cease upon the sea I was the one who made the waves to go down I created heavens and earth was I I not the one that told you to speak the to those for squirrels and they come into existence I am God now when a voice speaks to you watch the scripture if it's not scriptural you leave it alone I don't care how plain it is you stay away from it I said yes Lord he said speak to those winds in that song and it'll go away now this Bible ra before me which my life is in there I raised up I said I do not doubt your voice Lord I said clouds snow rain Fleet I resent your coming in the name of Jesus Christ go to your places I'll say that the sun must come out immediately and Shine for 4 days till our hunting trip is over and I'll leave with my brethren it's just gushing it's like like that it's start go I stood real still my brother up there wondering what was happening and the Sleep rain stopped there came a wind ping down to the mountain lifted up the clouds one went this way east north west and south and within a few minutes the Sun was shining nice and warm that's true God knows that's true I just stood there just looking around with my hand off looking you say I got numb all I thought the very God of creation it's all in his hand what's he telling me and I picked up my gun wiped off the scope started to walk back go down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with with me through this wilderness walk with me I said yes Lord with all my heart one of the greatest things I could do was walk with you so I put my gun over my shoulder and I started walking down through that never a and Virg pend walking through there and as I did walked along down on these game Trail I felt like I believe I will go up to the place where yesterday was our anniversary and I will stand there just a few minutes this is a little salute to meeting or a little bunch of quing ass up on a little knob and I said believe I'll walk up there just as a salute to our anniversary then I'll go back down on this other side of these dark timers and walk around and go around over about towards Corral Peak and come back down that way just walking and rejoicing I saying father I know you are walking with me what a privilege to Nobody Greater I could be walking with the very God that warm sunshine even to when I come out of the mountain I stopped at filling stations that's a beautiful day 3 days later it never rained in that part of the country until the four days was over the sun shined every day is that right Brethren and not a cloud and SK and I come out to the fing station I said um sure beautiful day yes it is I said been a said it's a strange thing this attendant said said you know they told us we going to get a big blizzard but all of a sudden it's stopped I come on down on the New Mexico line Billy and I my son we went into a little place there to get some uh the morning we left and I said sure a pretty day yes it is I said look like been pretty dry yes it has been I said are you from here said no I'm from westconsin or somewhere said I've been here about 20 years so I guess you

a blizzard in a lot of snow and it actually started and Ain quit I said you don't say so I come home and brother Tom said that he was told not to go that way a blizzard to he come come out even sprinkle or anything still God just as much as the walking up there I was going along now this part I hope my wife don't get is T but I'm going to tell you something and I I I don't tell you I just tell you the truth that's the only way to do it I've often wondered why she didn't complain about me going on the CH on her anniversary you know what I had made up my mind I said there's many people around the house and then I'm always you know I am nervous and everything I talk what talk about is God the vibe or something maybe she just thinks it's a little rest get me away from to go hunting I had thinking of that going WR I'm I I apologize to her and um I'm ask God to forgive me for that Stu because was going around I thought well she thinks well my goodness she she's a worker you know all
