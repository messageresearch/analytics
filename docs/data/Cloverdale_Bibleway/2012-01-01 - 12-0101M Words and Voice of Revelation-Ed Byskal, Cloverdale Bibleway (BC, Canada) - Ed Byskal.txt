TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] [singing] [music] Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to have our brother John Andy's come and [music] greet us in the new year. Amen. And open the service in a word of prayer if you'd just come, brother [music] John. &gt;&gt; And let's just welcome the Lord today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just want to lift up our hearts, God, and rejoice. We want to thank you, God, for this marvelous new year that's out before us, Lord. As Paul said, forgetting those things that are behind. We press toward the mark of the high calling, reaching [music] forward for those things that are before. God, we want to just lift up our hands together as individuals and collectively and just worship your holy name. God, [music] we want our gifts, Lord, to be in unison, be in one mind and one accord, Lord. Lord, we're not here for New Year's resolutions, but we [music] want to rededicate ourselves, reconsecrate ourselves, Lord. We want to with a renewal passion for your [music] presence and for your people. We want to lift up our hands and surrender, God. Ask you to move freshly upon our assembly, Lord, upon our ministry, Lord, upon every brother and sister, our families, Lord, that are gathering. Some are are grieving. Some are under great loss. [music] Some are sick among us. Some are looking for decisions, Lord, that are heavy on their minds and in their hearts. But Lord, we serve a great God, Lord, and we're here to bear one another's burdens. I pray that we would roll back the scales, Lord, from our our our our natural senses and look into the word today. Help us to rejoice as a people. Help us to be glad, God, and thankful as we look around the room and realize there's miracles that are standing here, God, lives that are redeemed. Today, we want to worship you. We just want to lift up the hands of one another, too, Lord, as just we're crossing the finish line. We're coming into another day, into another season. [music] I pray, God, you'd give us great revelation today. Let our hearts be warmed [clears throat and music] as we want to thank you for the service last night. God, still under the impact, [music] Lord, of your token life that's flowing through the body. We just pray for one another. And I'm sure there's [music] needs, there's unspoken requests, Lord, all over the building, out across the internet, lives that are connected with [music] us. pray a blessing on the bride today, God. This new January 1st, [music] I pray that throughout the land, there'd be a great surge of the anointing of God as we look for the coming of the Lord. Gross darkness on the people, but a great light has shone. God, use our pastor today, God, and to minister a message of shalom to us. A rapture message, a leaving this world message, Lord, future home message, Lord, that our theophanes AND US COULD FELLOWSHIP [music] very closely in the house of God today. Let us rejoice, God, in the singing. Rejoice in the prayers. Rejoice in the word and the testimonies as we celebrate your victory in our lives. [music] Take control of this afternoon's meeting. We give it to you, Lord, and we love you, God. Your appearing is so wonderful. [music] Your presence would just make the difference throughout this whole year and every part of our lives. Just your nearness, that supernatural nudge. God, [music] bless every soul. Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we're standing, let's sing together. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. [music] We're going to hear the choir again, the song that they sang last night. So maybe they can be [music] coming as we're singing this together. Blessed [music] are Jesus [music] [singing] is mine. Oh [music] what [singing] a foraste of glory [singing] divine. I'm an air of [music and singing] salvation, [music] purchased [singing] of God, [music] born of his [singing] spirit, washed [music] in his blood. This [music and singing] is my story. Oh, this is [music] my song. [singing] We're praising myior [music] all [singing] the day long. This is my song. [music and singing] Oh, this is my song. Praising [music and singing] my Savior all the day long. [music] Amen. Why don't you have your seats this morning? [music] God bless you know the Lord Jesus and give you a little uh just background behind this song. Um I first heard it um a while ago but I had forgotten about it and I just had kind of this melody in the back of my head and I looked it up on my iPod and began to listen to the lyrics of this song. how deep the father's love for us. And brother David, if you could have the lyrics maybe on both screens for the choir and the people to follow along with. I was so blessed by the lyrics of this song. And the title, how deep the father's love for us, only really happens as the first line of the song, but the entire song essentially relays that. How deep the father's love for us as it goes through the crucifixion and the place that it's put us in since then. And so I would just ask that you would just keep that in your mind how deep the father's love for us as you listen to these lyrics because we've been incredibly blessed even in our practices as we've sung this song and the anointing last night was just incredibly powerful behind it. And so we'd invite you if you know it you can sing along with us and uh that it would just be a blessing to you and throughout this new year whatever you face that you would just remember how deep his love is for us. Amen. God bless you all. We appreciate you. How deep [music and singing] the Father's love for us. I'll ask [music and singing] beyond no measure that [music and singing] he should give his only son to make [music and singing] a wretch his treure. How [singing] great the pain of searing [music] loss. The [singing] father turns his face away as [music and singing] wounds which mar the chosen one bring many [singing] sons to gloryy. Behold [music and singing] the man upon a cross. I [music and singing] s upon his shoulders. Ashamed [singing] I hear the mocker's voice. Call [music and singing] out among the sters. It [singing] was my sin that held him there [music] until [singing] it was a complace. His dying [music and singing] breath has brought me life. I know that [music and singing] it is. How deep, [music and singing] how deep, how deep, [music and singing] how deep. Yeah. [music] [music] Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; How [music and singing] great the Wolf that God did spend to come [singing] where I lay helpless. [music] Through tears [singing] I see his outstretched hand as [music] he declares [singing] meless. How great the love that s me out. [singing and music] How his mercy. [music and singing] His brightest my every heart [music] and praise me as [singing] his [music] [singing] will in [music] no power. [singing] [music] But I will boast in Jesus Christ. [singing] [music] his death and resurrection. [singing] I should [music] reward I [music] [singing] know with [music] all my heart his be [singing] my why [music] should I from his reward [singing] [music] I cannot give an answer. [singing] But this [music] I know with all my heart. His [music] words have been my son. [singing] How [music and singing] deep the father's love for us. &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; You are [singing] my strength when I am weak. You are the [music] treasure [singing] that I see. You are my only [singing] [music] [music] seeking [singing] you as a precious Jew. I want [singing] the Holy Ghost.

But this song is called It's Already Done. Amen. And it's just a chorus. Um the battle is [music] over. Amen. How many times have you gone through a situation it just seemed impossible to get through? Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; You wonder why did that person do that? It hurt me or why was that door shut or this door open? And then you said at the end you said, "Oh, it's just God. &gt;&gt; It was only God that could bring us through that." But then you realized he had it all in control in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was already done. It was already finished in his mind. &gt;&gt; That's how he is with [music] each one of us. Amen. And if you're sick, it's already done. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're already healed [music] this morning. Amen. So, Amen. Just sing it with me. It's so so simple.

Oh, [singing] I'm so happy [music] [singing] for I receptive the word. It was deliverance. [music] It was freedom to you and I for the [singing] word that was [music] [singing] hallelujah. Oh, if we just lift it up one more time. Oh, [music] [singing] can't you see? Oh, I'm so happy. [music] [singing] [music] The word of the Lord. [music] The reveal [singing] word that is spoken by [music] the prophet come. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; And so nice to see so many of you here. Wonderful way to start the new year. &gt;&gt; Amen. I shook hands with a lot of people twice today. I think you did too probably. And uh so it's nice to be in church twice &gt;&gt; same day. God bless you. I'll just let you have your seats for a few moments. And uh [clears throat] I have to take a little bit of time. We have you know the church here from its very very beginnings. And when we say its very beginnings, we talk about the house. Uh we always tried to reach out. Reach out to somebody, reach out to whoever uh just see who might be interested in hearing the things that we not the things that we believe, the things that have done so much for us. &gt;&gt; The word is a person. &gt;&gt; And I want you to remember that phrase throughout today's service. A word is a person. &gt;&gt; As I say, especially the young people, young men, young ladies, uh, and to those of you that may be under the sound of my voice today out in the, uh, out in the internet, on the telephone, and there are many, it would it would surprise you. I've gone over, not frequently, but once in a while I just go over how many people have have uh uh been logging on and listening to the service. And in between the archive of a week and the live streaming of the service, some of one one just two three weeks ago was up over 600 locations. uh you just put a couple people with each of that and sometimes there's many more but that's a lot of people that are are you know they're part of the service and they feel a part of you but I want also I'm saying some of these things for their benefit and that is the the congregation here has always been connected to the world and what happened was if you've not heard it before as we reached out whether was just handing out a tape or or a track or a message book or whatever it was. Then that person when they became interested, they struck if something struck their heart, then that's the place that they reached back in [clears throat] say, "Well, we need we need to uh I'd like to hear more." And uh I I just have a testimony here that I'll probably give just a little bit later on and it's out of Uganda and you just wouldn't believe. I mean those of you that were here last night and heard brother uh Larga Jonathan well you know he was here in this church and he was just a young man probably in his late teens at that time and you know they use anything like he said we use Facebook or whatever more. this brother in Uganda, he's doing the same thing at a on a different scale. And the people that they're contacting is just so many and uh uh I I just so many things that are on my heart, but I'm happy very in fact is I feel rewarded and thrilled that we can take this prophet's message, &gt;&gt; put it in the hands of somebody else, &gt;&gt; and then have them meet the person of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the key. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the people here that uh you you're sitting besides people that you know and others in the church and you've shaken hands with them. But to know him whom to know is life eternal. You you may be made known to him through the Bible, through the preaching or some other way. But he is a person &gt;&gt; and that is who you come to know. And once you've met him, you know that you've met him. &gt;&gt; You don't go on down the road and forget that you met him. You know that you met him &gt;&gt; and and a relationship is set up. &gt;&gt; Uh someone has gone to meet the Lord in a in a way he had not perhaps expected. But Sister Karen Ashdown's brother passed away yesterday. yesterday in the wee hours of the morning 12:38 a.m. Uh it was uh yeah I believe it was yesterday wasn't it yesterday and you know God does little special things. I hadn't seen him for some time and I was I had to actually deliver some documents and I was driving down 6 96th Avenue [clears throat] and just gone past the hospital and the building that uh Lyall Ficken was in was on the left hand side and I couldn't turn left and I thought I should stop in and see Lyall and brother Lyall I hadn't seen him now for some time [clears throat] and I thought well I need to get to the office and you that kind of a struggle sets up. And as I as I passed by the entrance, I couldn't turn left anyway because of a barricade. And so I went I went past a block and went past a second block. And I felt so bad at that time. I thought, well, I will just turn left here. And I turned and made a U-turn so I could come back out. And I thought, well, I'll text Sister Karen and find out if she's there or if any maybe it's a convenient time or inconvenient time. And anyway, make a long story short, she said, "I'm just leaving Cloverdale." And so we met there and uh uh I went up and was able to have an opportunity to speak to him a little bit, to speak to his wife, Martina, and then also to meet his daughter. his daughter was there and then have a little time uh just talking directly with him and uh spend a time with with sister Karen as well little knowing that within a few hours he would slip into eternity. Uh I want to tell you that from my own perspective this became a a major victory and you might say well why so? Well, because uh I I I a scripture came to me about three weeks ago, but even prior to that, as much as two months ago, while I was in Dallas, I had a very very specific experience with God, and I just took some time away uh while I was in the meetings, but I just cut myself off from everybody, stayed alone in the room, and did some fasting and prayer for a little while and and I thought I how can I fast when I'm in meetings but as I fasted I got stronger and it was just incredible and I would come through a 2-hour service and I felt better after the service than I felt before the service and I lost my all my desire for food and I was praying for Lyall and another gentleman that I'm praying for real earnestly and I just set myself aside they were on my mind all the time I just prayed whenever whenever I had a moment, I was just lifting them up in prayer and I said to the Lord, "Is it is it that you want to receive him? Is it that because you're not saying anything because you're not we're fully expecting him to walk out of the hospital, but is it that you want him more than you desire to even answer our prayers?" I know his desire to answer our prayers is great but you see we don't see the big picture and then we don't know if God restored a person to health what what would be the their future or what would be you know and and and and God comes to a place and he just decides you know he wants that individual with him and uh and uh I can say this and I will say it to the congregation to all and I'm not ashamed to say it through the faith of our Sister Karen Ashdown. She literally carried him into the presence of God with an undaunted, unmovable, unshakable faith to the last moment. But what I saw, I saw the man have a spiritual healing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And maybe you might not understand my words, but in so doing, I see a I see a a sister right here in this congregation who absolutely carried her brother, carried him from, I would say perhaps a second rec resurrection before the judgment seat of God, the great white throne judgment, just carrying on and and living a good life in a church. but taking them out of that environment until all he was living on was what the message and and streaming the services and until a point I'm just going to say some personal things until a point where he was just uh uh he came to the realization that even others that were coming and visiting him just wasn't getting it. They're just not getting it. They just don't understand. And he because he had had an experience. And to me that's glorious. That's taking a person out of the general resurrection and putting them in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That kind of faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Taking them from waiting uh for the general resurrection to step right into a theophony body. That's what the message teaches us. &gt;&gt; And so we have another and and and so that's why I said it's a great victory. I wanted to say that to you. There are no no further announcements regarding a memorial services yet, but that will be made soon. I'm also, as I said last night, there was some greetings, but I I didn't have a whole list with me, but I want to greet you formally from brother Steven Ibali in Uganda in Compala, I think just out of Compala, Uganda. Uh these are brethren who spoke in the email and and so on. Brother Garrett Roald and brother Hank Dystra in Holland where we had services just uh two three weeks ago. Brother Albert in who's pastoring at uh the church in Gent in Gent uh Belgium. And that's where the Iverson family go and from the Iversons themselves. There's a young man. I'm going to give you some slides in a little bit, but he wants to sure to be greeted to you. He sl he streams almost all the meetings. We call him brother Bus. It's brother Busabosi and brother Victor Adam. He's the one who's had a lot of contact with him. Uh also brother Sergey from Moscow and brother Vladimmer from the Ukraine from Daesk in the Ukraine. And uh we want to remember these works in prayer also. I'm so I I feel humbled and I feel more than privileged to be able to know these brethren to be able to be connected with men. And these men are solid men who hunger and love the word of God just like you do. And those are men we want to really support. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And while I'm on that subject, we'll have a brother here next Sunday. He has a church in Mexico City. I understand he's got quite an extensive work there. Brother Mark Aloo has had uh connection with him and brother uh Ron Caldwell has met him and knows him. Uh and uh so these brothers are going to be bringing him up. He'll be arriving next Friday on the 13th, but you won't see him Friday. gets in quite late and uh so I don't know just exactly all the arrangements, but he'll be here about a week and and so I've asked him to speak next Sunday night uh at at least and perhaps another service. We'll just see how that goes. And his name is Brother I don't know if I'm saying it exactly right. Uh Alwin, would that be close enough, brother Ron? Okay, &gt;&gt; stand up and say it louder. &gt;&gt; Francisco City. &gt;&gt; All right, there you &gt;&gt; from the 13th. Pardon? &gt;&gt; He's coming in the 13th. &gt;&gt; He's coming in Friday the 13th, but he'll be here next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Uh, the following Sunday. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you, Brother Ron. The following Sunday. That's right. Next Sunday, we're we're speaking a service for brother Danny uh down in Sarasota, Florida, Stevens. They're having an anniversary and uh I and my wife are supposed to be there for the anniversary. We have never been there, matter of fact, to speak. They've just asked us if we would speak that anniversary. Uh so and then the following Sunday, thank you brother Ron will be our brother from Mexico City. Amen. We have a greeting from brother Jacques in the Czech Republic and he just did a little short video clip. uh we have uh provided him through the brothers in Switzerland uh the a a hub printing station and now you'll see you might just think you know a little single hub printing station but you'll see what he's doing and and uh so can we have that video just now at this time and he he demonstrates what's happening how they handle it and then gives a word of greeting to the charge. We should have some audio. This is his two daughters. They're uh [clears throat] the one the one that's facing you is doing the printing and the folding, the collating and the folding. Um we should try to get the audio with this because he's he's explaining it. [cough] [clears throat] I'm sorry we haven't got that audio on. his greetings right at the end here anyway, but I appreciate the brothers getting the video part on, but we'd like to hear the audio as well. He did uh 10 new messages in this last year and he has been translating for almost 30 years. Uh no audio. Well, so the u the other part of this is he's just in the Czech Republic, but he he does the official when I say official because he translated for Voice of God for a number of years, but he also is a minister and a pastor and he couldn't do both at the same time, but they do several hundred messages of each of those messages which he does. And this is just one of the things that we attempt to do and to be a to be a uh uh reaching out. That's all part of our our our giving here from the church and all of those of you that give on the from the internet. Uh this is what is this is what is happening. Uh I'll just give you a few slides here and then okay this first slide here is just so I have it on the right. This is uh the young brother, brother Buster Bozi. here. Do we have a Okay, it's not a problem with equipment. We got so much equipment here. I don't know which one to take. This is brother Basaboosezi here and he has given us uh the slide is a little mixed up from from where I had I had his email. Um th this is a pastor of a church in Zimbabwe where he was down there in Harari and that church was started by brother Joseph Chakosi and uh then this is the brother and you want to remember him. This is someone we can really be praying for. Matimba, I believe would be the pronunciation of his name. And he just goes all over the country, all over the country bringing the message. And that's sometimes how he does it. He walks through the jungles. So this young brother Basaboosei, he's been emailing me and we've been in contact with each other since uh for about four years, since he was in university. And there there they're on a on a journey there. That's the brother that's doing the evangelistic work. He said he's just like an apostle setting up churches. And that's brother Basaboszi once again. And there they are in their journey. Uh and this is uh brother Matumba again, brother Basabosi and this is a deacon of another church and that's in a city I believe uh also in Zimbabwe. This is very interesting. I'll let you look at this while I tell you about it. Uh he said on Tuesday evening I was coming from uh somewhere I was walking besides the school where I saw a group of boys carrying out a discussion in a classroom. I was con convicted to go join them. Uh they were doing some mathematics. One of the boys gave me chalk for me to help them solve the problem. Uh from there what happened is almost unbelievable. We ended up having a Bible study service for about one hour. He says we talked on most of the important subjects and finally most of the boys asked for my mobile phone number uh for them to get to know more about the nuggets. What a mighty God we serve. And then he says more. Yesterday morning I was on a Facebook on on Facebook which I use primarily for evangelism and one young man older than me wrote me and he said he read on one of the websites I designed uh uh I designed and that he saw some studies on William Brham. He was a brother from a Pentecostal organization and lives in Kala Uganda. He then later pleaded pleaded with me that I tell him more about this man, William Brham. [clears throat and cough] Brother, it will surprise you that this brother listened to and believed every bit of what I told him. I explained it by the help of the Holy Ghost from Elijah who was raptured. Then the spirit of Elijah on Elisha on down to Malachi 3, Malachi 45 and 6, Revelation 10:7 and other scriptures. And I then started to talk about William Brandham's experiences from his birth in 1909 to his death in 1965 mostly about the 1933 and 1963 and when he was about uh when it when he was about 6 years etc. And the brother was amazed and he later told me he was he has never in his life heard such an explanation about brother Brham even though he had once heard about him while he was just doing his uh zero level studies in school. And isn't our God amazing? &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful when you have a young man so full of it. He just goes by a school looking for every opportunity. So they as soon as they put that chalk in his hand, he felt in control. Hallelujah. And thank you. You can take that one off now. God bless you. Isn't he wonderful? [applause] [applause] All right. You ready for the word? &gt;&gt; All right. If you'll stand and we'll turn the lights up, please, for us. I would like to have you turn to the book of Acts. We'll wait. Um, first turn to the book of Hebrews if you would please. Uh, I'd like to turn to the 12th chapter. I'm going to begin reading at the 18th verse. And before we read, let us pray once again. Our gracious father, we are so privileged to address you as our father which art in heaven and to know that you're the God of Abraham, the God that made promise to him. You're the God that was faithful in fulfilling the promise, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. You're the God of the prophets who were moved by the Holy Ghost and they spake things they did not understand, had them written down for our learning and for our benefit, for our edification. Thank you, Lord Jesus. For you are the one that was sent from the very bosom, the logos of God. You came down and was made flesh. We thank you, Father. Thank you, Father, for giving us this great gift. And here today, we stand as a people redeemed by the blood of the lamb of God. Thank you, Father, for the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit that has come &gt;&gt; and has filled us individually, and we've all had our individual experience. And if there are any here who have not had it as yet and have not been filled and baptized with the Holy Spirit, may they be endued with the same power, the same spirit that came upon the apostles and the disciples. How we thank you for the messengers, oh God, that have each one in their age been faithful to their time, but the last one could not be a reformer, but must be a restorer of the word, a prophet indeed. We thank you, Father, for the prophecies that have been spoken and have been fulfilled when you have vindicated, oh God, the message which we believe. We're not here believing some idle tales or some mysticism, but we're here believing the word that you have sent. Oh God, I pray it'll our hearts will be marked and our minds branded and our souls affected in the name of Jesus Christ. Give liberty I pray to my speaking father and may you be the one that utters the words and the people receive it in a supernatural channel in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Start reading at the 18th verse. For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto the blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice they that heard intreated, that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. For they could not endure that which was commanded. And if so much as a beast touched the mountain, it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart. And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake. But we are come under the mount under Mount Zion, and under the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven. Isn't that wonderful? Hallelujah. And to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect. And to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant. Praise the Lord. And to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. So that ye see that you refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven, whose voice then shook the earth, but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word yet once more signifyth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless his word to our hearts as you have your seats. And while you've just sat down, I also want to welcome our brother Martin Warner and his wife. Brother Martin and your wife, why don't you stand? It's Sister Roxan, Doc Hoffman's sister. And so they've got good company. [applause] Brother Martin just came from uh came from meetings in Africa. And I'm sorry we didn't acknowledge you last night, Brother Martin. Forgive us. God bless you. Nice to have you here always. Our friendship has been long lasting over the years and we really appreciate that. I want to try to approach something that I don't know exactly how to approach and so I guess we've all been there at times. You want to say something you're not too sure how you want to say it. But uh uh sometimes you know in in the ministry you have to kind of get off into some areas that are uh difficult to define. You know you know what you want to say but how to say it is is is the problem. Uh I will just commence by saying uh because we've been reading the scripture and this verse in particular, see that you refuse not him that speaketh. Uh, for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven, whose voice, and this is where I want to come from, whose voice then shook the earth, and now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more, I shake not the earth only, but also the heaven. Now while I'm speaking today uh we all have uh different levels of understanding of the words that we speak. Once in a while a person may say a word and often I'm running into words that I don't completely understand. So I seek out the meaning of those words. uh and and so we all have different levels of meaning of of of the words. I want to I [clears throat] I want to take into an area today uh to deal with some things that you know have been a concern to me in the message. For example, we hear and read often in the message uh the word revelation. I want you to think about revelation because I want to speak to you on words and the voice of revelation. And you find people that say, well, oh, they h they've had a revelation and they walk for perhaps months or even years in the message and have every appearance of having a revelation and uh and and then on down the road someplace they and brother Doug Hendrickson last night, that was one of the things that was in his in his comments and it was very well taken. He he wondered and he had a burden and he felt we should never lose our uh compassion and and our desire to see them restored. I have difficulty with uh and I believe I agree with that with our brother Doug 100%. I have difficulty uh believing that someone who has a true revelation actually depart from a revelation. &gt;&gt; And so there's levels of no knowing the message. Brother Brandham's talked about the priest. He said he learned it &gt;&gt; and he knew it was right &gt;&gt; and he knew it was God's word, but he had learned it. He got it in the channel of learning. And I think if we just learned something, we might uh be in danger of unlearning it. Or if we just got convinced of it by someone who can really put the thing together, we might get convinced of something else from somebody else. We find someone that's more uh you know um more able, more gifted, more skilled, then we might get them to convince a person another way. But when you've had a revelation, I want to try to convey to you today that a revelation is actually the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And that the voice of God, if we go back to the beginning, the voice of God is not in in it's not a a word necessarily. It it won't be in any specific language. it is uh you it may come to you by hearing something in a specific language as and this I'll be coming to in detail as apostle Paul said when he was struck down he said he heard in the Hebrew tongue so now God spoke or he heard an utterance in the Hebrew tongue calling his name Saul Saul why persecutest thou me none of the other men heard those words. They indeed saw the light and they and but Paul fell to the ground and uh and that became the object of his worship. Now, I'm I'm going to kind of overemphasize something here just for the sake of jarring your thoughts into the channel where I want to go. Uh if we go right back to the very beginning when and God said, "Let there be light." I I I know that wasn't in English and I don't think it was in Hebrew and I don't think because the languages uh as they were known after Babel had not even come into existence at that time. So it's interesting for us to say and and God said let there be light. Then the Bible says also that and God spoke to Abram by vision. what Abram what kind of voice that was I do not know but I'm just laying all of that aside for a moment to say that there's one thing that is quite uh very very specific and certain and that is that when God has in the scripture when he spoke to Abraham and told him certain things I don't know even what kind of language and I doubt that there was a language because what can be spoken to The inner man is can be much clearer &gt;&gt; than the language you know. &gt;&gt; You can see something and it becomes so vivid &gt;&gt; and it becomes so personal &gt;&gt; and you know it's you that he is being talked to &gt;&gt; and you can hear it as though it's your name and it identifies you I'm talking to and it's not tomorrow. It's now I'm talking to you and I'm calling you and you feel so moved and called and and you you you know it's just specific. Sometimes he's spoken to people in such a way that it's it's now and this won't even be tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Some have told me I've heard like I heard the voice of God and I knew right then it if I if I left it or if I if I tried to postpone it this was my last chance. They've known that. How does it come so specific? It's you I'm talking to. This is the in this is the person. He knows all about the life. And then and then the one thing for sure that happens, I've noticed that when the men in the Old Testament and in the New when they actually got a revelation of who that person was, what followed almost immediately was worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so because there was no sound or no words or there may have been but we don't have a specific record of it but then as soon as the revelation came &gt;&gt; I will say it that is true revelation &gt;&gt; then that individual begins to worship at the level of that revelation. in fact is as the prophet said, the message and the messenger are the same &gt;&gt; and they're they're the same. You can't really separate them. &gt;&gt; And so a person ends up, you'll excuse my phrase right now, but you end up worshiping your revelation. Now, &gt;&gt; it's it's good that you stop to think about that because I've been thinking about this for a lot of days. And now we're going to go into some scripture. But you see, God would speak to Abram in a vision and then you see him build an altar and worship. Now, there's people today that are assembled in churches throughout the entire earth. And each of those churches are representative of a certain document or a faith, a document of faith. And they say, "This is what we believe." And so the people are there and whatever form of worship they take, it might be a very relaxed form, it might be uh it might be a very uh severe form or a very precise form or very traditional form or whatever more. But what they're really saying is that what has been spoken, what is in word form that this edifice represents, that is who we're worshiping. And thus it becomes idolatry. &gt;&gt; That's why God said, "Don't make any image of me &gt;&gt; because you don't know who I am. &gt;&gt; You don't know my form." &gt;&gt; And my form, furthermore, they didn't know. But his form changes. It changed. He changed his mask over and over. &gt;&gt; And so we find that when God spoke initially, he spoke to Adam and Eve. He spoke how he spoke. I do not know the language. That's I'm trying to get a point across to you that the language and the sounds of words actually are irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. We're not worshiping just certain sounds of words. The sound of the words are irrelevant. &gt;&gt; It's what is conveyed to you &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God &gt;&gt; through the sound of those words. &gt;&gt; And if you only get words to your into your ears and then into your mind and you can get turnurning around and reasoning within and then it's on. Don't forget, listen to what the prophet says. when it gets into your mind, it's in the battleground. &gt;&gt; It's in the battleground and and but it has to get from there down into another channel which is the soul of faith. Uh uh faith a channel of faith down to the soul. And when believing takes place, when faith takes place, once again the prophet said faith is a revelation. And when that revelation strikes your soul, you have now become acquainted with a personal &gt;&gt; and you cannot forget meeting that person. &gt;&gt; That's a person that knows you inside out. &gt;&gt; That's a person that knows you from your very beginning. And if you get to know that person, you will love that person. &gt;&gt; You will enter into a love relationship with that person. And you cannot forget that love relationship. &gt;&gt; Now the voice Can we get lights down just a wee bit, please? So, in the beginning was the word. But what is the word? A word is a thought. A word is a thought manifested. A thought spoken forth and hold that manifested. God first he perceived. This is out of the message. God first he perceived the thought and spoke it. It became a word and the word became material. &gt;&gt; Now that's the process. Right? &gt;&gt; What is the word? As we hear, listen, we as message believers, we hear the word. You got to believe the word and you got to get the word and and listen to the word. And so what is the word? Is it just the English phraseology in the message books? It has to come to you because we perhaps put a lot of emphasis that I know I do and that's why I'm taking another step. take a lot of step. You've got you can hear it. You've got it on tape. You've got it on disc. You have it whatever more. But you can hear that to your dying day and not get the word. &gt;&gt; The word is more than just some phrases and how it's put together. And then they say, well, the word is it's a life. It is a life, but it's more than a life. It's a life that has come about by an acquaintance to a person. If you miss the person, &gt;&gt; if you miss that life, you've missed everything. &gt;&gt; And once you meet that life, I'll tell you what, you'll be a different person. That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the fundamental foundation of faith, if you want to go back a little further, he said just as far as historical, you could see the word. You could see the word. In the beginning was the word. But what is the word? A word is a thought manifested. So now if you have if you have all kinds of doctrine or teaching or winds of this or that or or theology or people you know speaking the message and reading the quotes. It's more than that. It has to be manifested. &gt;&gt; There has to be a manifestation of that what was ever spoken &gt;&gt; to prove what it was that was spoken. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says we'll come to it later. He said in the beginning he said let there be light. &gt;&gt; If it came a fog &gt;&gt; it wasn't the word. &gt;&gt; Can't say let there be light and then there comes a fog. &gt;&gt; You can't say God's holy and have an unholy people. &gt;&gt; It has to be manifested. A thought spoken forth. God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and it became a word and the word became material. So everything that God has spoke in his word received into the right channel will materialize that God for what uh materialize that that word for whatever the promise behind it is and God will do it he's obligated to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. manifested. What does manifested mean? Manifested is, and we're giving all of this so you can hopefully hold it in your heart while we just move along, is is to make clear, to see or understand. That's when something's manifested to you. So now the word has to be manifested and it that is to make it clear or to make something evident by showing or demonstrating it very clearly to appear or to be revealed. Now the scripture we read in the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. Now Apostle Paul is referring back to when uh dark and the cloud and God met Moses in the mountain. Now it's God. See, listen. So, now it's God in the mountain and he's speaking to Moses and giving him the giving him the uh tablets and Moses comes down. The people said, "Don't don't let God speak to us anymore directly like that." And and I'm very keen. I'm very very keen. I'm This isn't, you know, this isn't some uh I'm not just playing with words here. I'm interested in knowing what was that and h and how was it made known to them and what was it they turned down. &gt;&gt; Now God [clears throat] spoke to Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; How? I don't know. But they didn't keep it. &gt;&gt; God spoke through Moses &gt;&gt; and the people didn't keep it. &gt;&gt; God spoke through the prophets. Now, different languages, different sounds, articulating different words, but the people didn't keep it. &gt;&gt; God was in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It was God in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You couldn't get God speaking. And he spoke the Galilean language. Different language, different sounds. And I don't know what kind of understanding was coming through the people, but they didn't keep it. &gt;&gt; NOW WE SAY, "PRAISE GOD. GOD HAS SET A PROPHET in this end time. I want to know what is the key &gt;&gt; that we will move forward &gt;&gt; and keep that word so that it DOES NOT DETERIORATE INTO CHURCHITY. [applause] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT SO MANY CHURCHES. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN A CHURCH. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THEOLOGY. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SOME DEAD FORMALISM. I'M INTERESTED IN THE POWER OF GOD ALIVE IN A PEOPLE AND A PEOPLE WHO HAVE A A RELATIONSHIP AND ARE IN LOVE WITH JESUS CHRIST AND COME INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND THEY'RE QUICKENED. THEY'RE MOVED. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PUMPED. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ENTHUSED. THEY ARE ENTHUSED. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE BEEN WALKING WITH HIM. THEY'VE BEEN TALKING WITH HIM. BUT I SEE ALL DOWN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MANKIND IS, YOU KNOW, GOD SPOKE, GOD SENT. GOD SENT THE PROPHET. THEY DIDN'T HEAR IT. GOD CAME. JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF DIDN'T HEAR HIM. DIDN'T HEAR. APOSTLE PAUL, DIDN'T HEAR WILLIAM BRANDHAM. LISTEN FRIENDS, OUR CHANCES ARE VERY SLIM. WE NEED TO REALLY, REALLY BUCKLE UP. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO REALLY TAKE THIS THING SERIOUS. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO GLIDE ALONG and somehow slide into it. IT'LL BE A BATTLE EVERY INCH OF THE WAY. &gt;&gt; ALL HELL IS AGAINST THIS REVELATION. &gt;&gt; Do I need to SAY IT AGAIN? ALL HELL &gt;&gt; IS AGAINST THIS REVELATION &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE REVELATION IS ACTUALLY THE VOICE OF GOD &gt;&gt; AND IT SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO YOU. You have to help me. &gt;&gt; I I've trembled at at bringing this word. Now the the word voice up here at the sound of the trumpet and the voice of words that is how they are articulated. the voice of words which voice the same thing and you know the word the Greek word is phone and the phone is a sound of uttered words it's speech or language but that word now this is this is this is the process of voice which came from pheno that is to appear or to be seen to bring forth into light or to become evident to come into view. So now the idea that God is conveying here, it's not just a sound on your ears, but it's to bring something or to appear because he's thinking of himself to be made visible and [clears throat] then that that comes also from foss which we know even in the English language is we say phosphorus because it is to shine or to make manifest. to make manifest by light or by fire. It speaks there distinctly of truth and it's knowledge light by knowledge and that because you see people when they hear something and they GET SOME KNOWLEDGE OH OH I SEE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LIGHT FOSS has happened &gt;&gt; it's not just some words but now the words had to be constructed into perhaps teaching or into preaching and then PEOPLE SAYS OH I GET IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S HAPPENED? THE LIGHT WENT ON. &gt;&gt; F happened. &gt;&gt; It's not just a phone. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST A FAINT. IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT THAT some some manifestation. But now they see what the MANIFESTATION'S ALL ABOUT. LOOK AT HOW V LOOK AT HOW visibly how how evidently THAT GOD HIMSELF HERE'S a human here's a human STANDING HERE AS A PROPHET SPEAKING to another human and and THE PEOPLE ARE MISSING IT COMPLETELY AND HE'S TELLING HIM I JUST READ IT HE SAID I the this is the doctor he says I SEE THE DOCTOR STANDING BY YOUR BEDSIDE &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S ALREADY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN IN A HOSPITAL. YOU HAD AN OPERATION. I SEE THE I SEE THE DOCTOR BY YOUR BEDSIDE TELLING YOU ABOUT YOUR SITUATION. AND HERE'S A MAN IN ANOTHER WORLD TELLING HER, "BUT THE PEOPLE DON'T GET IT." &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M SAYING IS THEY SAW THE MANIFESTATION BUT DIDN'T HEAR THE VOICE. LISTEN, BELIEVERS, WE GOT TO GO A LOT FURTHER THAN JUST SEE A good life and wear a long dress and and look like a believer. IT GOES WAY BEYOND THAT. &gt;&gt; THE LIGHT HAS TO GO ON INSIDE. YOU NEED TO HEAR YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE CALLED. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A MAN JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; And that false here's the here's the process. And last is Femi to say or make known one's thoughts. So we've gone full circle. So God in the beginning spoke his thoughts and the purpose is that so it'll COME OUT ALL THROUGH THE CENTURIES OF man's learning and wisdom and it'll BE FORMED INTO WORDS and shaped into sentences and phrases and MEN WILL SPEAK GOD'S word and men as they were moved BY THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THE PURPOSE IS THAT truth would come. &gt;&gt; And the light would go on. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THE LIGHT WOULD GO ON, IT WOULD ALSO BE A FIRE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; JEREMIAH SAID, "I GOING TO I CAN'T SPEAK THIS." HE COULDN'T SPEAK IT. BUT IT WAS A FIRE. &gt;&gt; WENT ON. WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS PHASEROUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT WAS AN EXPLOSION TAKING PLACE. BUT THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS THOSE WORDS AND THE LIGHT AND THE FIRE WAS SO THAT THE THOUGHT OF GOD COULD BE MADE KNOWN TO THE person &gt;&gt; and that person would enter into a relationship knowing who had spoken with them. So now we have see you refuse not him that speaketh whose voice then shook the earth. This God's word you don't have to be a very intelligent person. Say yet once more. yet promised saying, "Yet once more. I shake not the earth only, but the heaven." If there's ever been a time or an age in man's history that he became conscious of the heavens, we're in a space age. &gt;&gt; We send up everything into space, right? On airplanes with tons of baggage and people and freight and all these bodies. And last time I got on coming over here back from Europe, I thought my wife says, "How's this thing going to get off the ground?" See, bringing all those carts and and uh forklifts and everything else coming up into the plane, loading the thing up, say, "Oh, oh, we don't think anything of it. Everybody we fly all over the world." Well, they didn't a few years ago. &gt;&gt; This is the space age. &gt;&gt; THIS GOD WHO SPOKE this word knew we're going to come to this hour. and he knew were going TO BE, OH, YOU'RE ON YOUR CELL PHONE AND YOU'RE YAPPING AND carrying on. You don't have a clue. But those specific words with the very articulation of your voice and the very characteristic of your VOICE IS BEING CARRIED BUT in in just micros secondsonds around the world and people are hearing and you're talking and laughing and everything else cuz your voice is going there. &gt;&gt; This is the age. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the prophet is saying that THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER AGE. &gt;&gt; There's going to be A TIME BECAUSE GOD HAS SAID ONCE MORE I'M GOING TO SHAKE NOT THE EARTH BUT THE HEAVENS ALSO. &gt;&gt; AND I SAY THERE'S a voice. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A TRUE VOICE &gt;&gt; THAT IS CIRCLING THIS GLOBE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT IS THE ONE VOICE IN THIS END TIME THAT COME AS THUS SAYETH THE LORD. WE HAVE A THUS SAYITH THE LORD GOING AROUND THIS ENTIRE GLOBE AT THIS VERY MOMENT. THE WORDS OF MALACHI 4 ARE GOING AROUND. IN FACT IS IT'S THE ONLY WORDS THAT I KNOW OF THAT GOD HAS VINDICATED. A VINDICATED VOICE IS SHAKING IN THE HEAVENS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; CALLING CALLING FOR AN END TO ALL THINGS. A VINDICATED VOICE CALLING FOR A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH AND A DESTRUCTION OF ALL OF THE EVIL THAT'S UP THERE. ALL THE PERVERSION, ALL THE FALSE TEACHING, HE SAID IT'LL BE BURNED UP WITH A HOLY FIRE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THOSE WORDS MEAN TO YOU, WHATEVER A HOLY FIRE MEANS TO YOU, IT DOESN'T I IT'S IRRELEVANT TO ME AS LONG AS THE HOLY SPIRIT CONVEYS TO YOU THAT UP IN THE SKY, IN THE HEAVENS, AROUND THIS GLOBE AND IN THE UNIVERSE IS THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to say this a simply. You want to take what I'm saying today very serious. &gt;&gt; I've never preached on this in my life. &gt;&gt; There was a time when there was no sound of words such as we know it today. And all that we speak about revelation, brother Brandham said, and I've heard, but now I see. He said, "What is a revealed? Is a secret made known?" A revelation is to reveal or make known a secret. All kinds of people got secrets. all the churches and everybody they got like some secret has been I've heard people on the radio years ago that opened the seven seals. It's amazing. I listened. I don't remember a single thing. That Mr. Armstrong said going to open the seals. A revelation is the revealing of something previously hidden or secret. So now I want to talk about a true revelation. Is everyone listening? &gt;&gt; In the God of this evil age, he said he keeps you from seeing the true revelation. I'm not only I'm this is not to be negative and it's not to be positive this morning. This is to just cut it down the line. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to show us as believers what our problems are. &gt;&gt; Show us as believers what our enemy seeks to do. &gt;&gt; And is trying to hinder us from getting a true revelation because a true revelation is a relationship. &gt;&gt; He keeps you from seeing the true revelation and faith in God's word being revealed and vindicated by his schools. libraries. Now, I'm not talking about just a normal library. I'm talking brother Brandham's talking on a spiritual level. They had all kind the the schools that resisted him was not the public school system. The schools that resisted him was Bible schools, &gt;&gt; theological schools, seminaries. They're the ones that devised doctrines that resisted him and literature and hospitals and so forth. because there hospitals all kinds of uh religious institution mostly uh of the Catholic faith and I won't even get into it but they raised up hospitals that you know that this was some kind of a a spiritual uh spiritual thing he went to work there and so on and he said and so forth and that keeps you from it. [clears throat] He is now He is now interpreting as he did to Pharaoh. That Satan is now interpreting the word as he did to Pharaoh. Trying to keep you from seeing the meaning of the vindicated word. The meaning of the vindicated word &gt;&gt; that [clears throat] he promised for this age in the evening lights, vindicated and proved. He's trying by his knowledge and schools and better educated people and ethics and so forth to keep you away from seeing that anything so that you won't look at that and see that's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He is using anything &gt;&gt; that is possible. anything. &gt;&gt; He said anything so that you won't look at that &gt;&gt; and see. Some people look at it but they don't see. And a lot of people in the message I'm speaking to message believers and many will probably hear this even thousands. There's a lot of people in message that are looking at it but have not seen JESUS CHRIST. They've seen new truth or THEY'VE SEEN SOME, WOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. THAT'S NOT WHY he sent the message. &gt;&gt; Hear all about the serpent seed and it wasn't an apple and SAY, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT." Of course it's not apples. Of course it had to be sex. Of course it had to be twins. That's not a revelation. That's just putting it together in your mind. Say, "I've never heard that before." OF COURSE, YOU NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't make it a revelation. But a revelation is WHEN YOU SEE THE CHRIST OF CALVARY, &gt;&gt; THE LAMB OF GOD, &gt;&gt; SHEDDING THE BLOOD FOR YOUR SIN, AND YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT PERSON. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN NEVER FORGET THE PERSON WHO DIED FOR YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He says, "How do you know it's Jesus Christ?" He said, "He is the word and he's the word of this age." &gt;&gt; So even the word of this age, I know I may I'm saying this at the risk of being misunderstood. Even even they have you can have 1100,200 tapes and the WORD IS IN KENTUCKY AND ENGLISH and so some GLORY IN THE FACT WELL IT'S JUST PLAIN AND AS USED AS hints and as all of those THINGS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; JESUS SPOKE THE GUTAL LANGUAGE OF THE GALILEAN PEOPLE BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT MADE HIM HOLY OR MADE IT HOLY AND IT WASN'T HIS LANGUAGE THAT MADE HIM CHRIST. THAT WAS PART OF HIS VEIL. &gt;&gt; THE LITTLE MAN FROM KENTUCKY THAT GOD USED HIM AND AND WAS IN HIM. THAT WASN'T THAT WASN'T THAT WAS JUST PART OF THE VEIL. THE POOR LANGUAGE IS PART OF THE VEIL. AND SO ALL THESE WORDS, YOU COULD HAVE ALL THE WORDS ON, 1200 TAPES AND ALL THE BOOKS AND EVERY KIND. YOU STILL HAVEN'T GOT CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO GET A REVELATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN I SAY YOU'VE GOT TO GET A REVELATION, I SAY THAT'S WHAT GOD GAVE IT FOR IS SO THAT THE PEOPLE CAN COME INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT PERSON. YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IT, BUT HE SAYS THEY LOOK AT IT BUT DON'T SEE JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I'M SPEAKING WITH CONVICTION, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; I'M SPEAKING WITH DEADLY CONVICTION. IF THIS WOULD BE MY LAST MESSAGE, THIS IS WHAT I'D WANT TO SAY. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOOK AT IT AND FAIL TO SEE HIM. &gt;&gt; IF YOU JUST LOOK AT IT IN BOOKS, IT CAN STAY THERE FOREVER &gt;&gt; AND DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU. AND THEN YOU GET STIRRED BY SOMEBODY REBUKE OVER THE POPE AND SAY, "OH, YEAH. I GUESS I I NEED TO READ IT. I'll go HOME AND AND SAY WHAT I READ." YOU YOU'VE MISSED IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT. THE WHOLE MESSAGE CAME TO REVEAL A PERSON &gt;&gt; AND THAT PERSON IS OUR creator &gt;&gt; so I want to show them from the scriptures that the true and accurate hearing a true and accurate HEARING OF THE VOICE or the words of GOD IS IN ACT OF REVELATION. THE REVELATION IS the hearing. &gt;&gt; AND THE HEARING AND THE REVELATION AND THE PERSON WHO'S being revealed, they're one and the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND THE LORD APPEARED TO ABRAM." &gt;&gt; How did he appear? &gt;&gt; What struck his eyes? You don't know. I don't know. But we know one thing. HE BUILT AN ALTAR AND WORSHIPED. &gt;&gt; Worship is always very very close to the revelation. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; There's a recent study that just is happening at this time and uh I guess the medical people have been working on it for a long time. And what they did was they took several persons that were born blind. And uh they showed that the part of their brain that a part of their brain used for vision called the visual cortex that part of their brain was activated by sound not and supposed to be activated only by sight but it was actually activated by sound and the tapping that's why they say the tapping of a person's cane you know and they actually showed and and this man and I I saw this on the a screen and this man he's tapping his cane and they have him out in a a a big area with walls and posts and so on and he's tapping his crane cane just blind as can be and he just comes up within a foot or two of that and he just turns with that and then there's another one right there and he goes right around it and he's just tapping his cane and they have taken these people they've taken about 12 of them now born blind. They had to be born blind and they put them and they've given them in put them in a MRI machine and registered when sounds were registering the sound their visual cortex the visual cortex their brain went into action and they said they're actually seeing by hearing &gt;&gt; and then they took people who never were blind just had their eyesight and put them into the same container container put them in the same MRI machine and their c the visual cortex did not activate at sound. So they said the upshot of this was and the reason I'm bringing it is a very I have a very very definite reason for bringing it is that they began to see they actually could see not with their eyes but they could see there's an object there because their brain was telling them there's an object there and they would just turn from it like that and it was by they they concluded that it was because of the they exercised that part because they didn't have the faculty of sight that through exercising by all of their life their their hearing became so heightened through exercising that it actually give them vision. I say this &gt;&gt; one thing you're here hearing in the word of God today. I trust that the same thing takes place where you hear the word so distinctly. &gt;&gt; You hear it preached so clearly. &gt;&gt; You hear it anointed by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; until it begins to give you sight &gt;&gt; AND YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE PERSON &gt;&gt; OF JESUS CHRIST. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING, HE SAID, BUT THEY'RE NOT SEEING HIM. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO LOOK AT HIM THROUGH HEARING THE WORD THAT GOD SAID AND AND EXERCISE THAT inner voice. &gt;&gt; HEAR IT, NOT HEAR. HEAR IT HERE. I WANT YOU ALL TO SAY, "WHAT'S HE SAYING? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS BROTHER ED SAYING TODAY? WHAT IS THIS WORD THAT'S COMING TO US?" AND MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING HERE and say, "I HAVE NEVER REALLY MET CHRIST IN SUCH A WAY, IN SUCH A REALITY." I WANT TO SAY HE'S HERE AND AVAILABLE TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE SENT THIS MESSAGE TO GIVE YOU ACCESS &gt;&gt; into his presence. &gt;&gt; We need to exercise that faculty. &gt;&gt; YOU DO HAVE THE FACULTY. GOD HAS CALLED YOU. YOU have an inner uh an inner man &gt;&gt; that can hear THAT CAN PICK UP THE SOUND. AND YOU KNOW, I find that in the church realm and at the time of of at those moments in life when things are very heightened, emotionally heightened, the time of maybe when there's a moving of the spirit of God in a service at the time when a couple fall in love and they move towards marriage, engagement in marriage and at a time when death comes. Those instances, those three, you find that the realm of the spirit, which is the entire emotional being that you have, and the and the soul, your soul, those two almost become compressed together. And it's it's almost impossible to find the separating point. And that's why I always question couples that come to me that say, "I I I I feel we're attracted to one another. What has attracted you to one another?" I try to get that question answered. Why are you attracted to one another? Because I want to try to find out if there's something and sometimes they've learned the right phrases from the message. Oh, I've noticed his character. Really? you know, I see the kind of woman that she is and and she'll be a good mother to my children. Really? Is that what attracted you to her or is there something else? Uh and then we come in uh in the meetings. That's why that's why brother Brandham when he was speaking, remember now friends, you perhaps have never seen what I've seen. I've been in meetings that would send goosebumps all over your body and raise the hair on your neck. Seeing the Holy Spirit sweep into a congregation of people and take over the meeting to the the minister couldn't minister anymore. I'VE STOOD BEHIND THE PULPIT MYSELF AND COLLAPSED OVER THE PULPIT IN SOBS AND WEEPING AT AT THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, AT THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THE PEOPLE JUST MOVE INTO WORSHIP AND MOVE INTO WHATEVER ELSE AND THEN PERSON COULD YOU COULDN'T GO OUT OF THAT MEETING AND SAY WELL GOD WASN'T THERE THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MEETING AND YET THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE THEY'D TAKE THE WORD OF GOD &gt;&gt; and then you have a thus SAYITH THE LORD BUT NOW WE'RE IN ANOTHER AGE WE'VE HAD THUS SAYETH THE Lord and we and AND THERE'S A GREAT DANGER AND I SEE IT AS I TRAVEL PEOPLE ARE LAXING BACK INTO A CHURCH REALM &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LAXING BACK INTO A RELIGION. [applause] THIS IS NOT A RELIGION. THIS IS TRUE RELIGION, PURE RELIGION. THIS IS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A DANGER OF PEOPLE WALKING ON PAST HIM, TAKING A LOOK AND NOT BEING MOVED, NOT ENTERING INTO a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; So, you heard the word. Oh, yeah. We heard the word. We're down SOME SPECIAL MEETINGS. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; You could be sitting in YOUR ROOM. YOU COULD BE SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR AT THE KITCHEN AND ENTER INTO A GREATER RELATIONSHIP than you did in the convention. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You can be OUT IN THE WOODS &gt;&gt; AND ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP THAT THE PEOPLE IN CHURCH DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SIT UNDER THE BEST PREACHERS IN THE COUNTRY. THEY THEY SAT UNDER WILLIAM BRANDON BY THE THOUSANDS, BY THE MILLIONS, AND ONLY A HANDFUL. THAT'S WHY HE SAID FEW FEW THERE BE. &gt;&gt; My brother, MY SISTER, THIS MAY COST YOU EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; THIS CHRIST MAY COST YOU EVERYTHING, &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S WORTH EVERYTHING AND MORE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So our first parents, as I said earlier, Adam and Eve, they heard the voice and words. For the scripture says they heard the voice of God walking. &gt;&gt; Put that one together. In the garden. &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of a sound was walking. I don't know what IT WAS, BUT GOD WAS there &gt;&gt; walking in the garden. and they were not able to keep the word. The people heard the prophets. They heard Jesus Christ. They heard the apostles. &gt;&gt; They heard the messengers. &gt;&gt; And they've HEARD A HOST OF WITNESSES. &gt;&gt; And yet most failed to hear the words of God. Now stay very attent. The Bible says Abel offered an acceptable sacrifice and the prophet of God gave us the key. So now we have the key in Genesis because Genesis is the seed chapter and the key we have Adam and Eve who were not able to keep they were not able to keep the words OF GOD WITH GOD HIMSELF SPEAKING IT. &gt;&gt; How do you like THAT ONE? RIGHT? &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF IN WHATEVER WAY HE CHOSE, &gt;&gt; HE CONVEYED TO THEM his word AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO KEEP IT. But Adam's son, &gt;&gt; Abel, and the BIBLE SAYS BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; And our prophet said faith is a revelation. That's right. &gt;&gt; So by a revelation &gt;&gt; somehow he was attuned &gt;&gt; to an inner voice. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FRUIT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT APPLE. &gt;&gt; IT JUST DOESN'T AGREE WITH WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOME OTHER THING. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE FRUIT OF THE FIELD. AND HE'S OUT AND SOMETHING'S MOVING HIM. BUT HE'S BECOMING ATTUNED TO A VOICE INSIDE. AND PERHAPS HE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE SAYING, "IT'S BLOOD. IT'S BLOOD. IT'S BLOOD. I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS ANIMAL. &gt;&gt; I GOT TO TAKE THIS PURE ANIMAL. &gt;&gt; I GOT TO TAKE THIS SPOTLESS ONE. &gt;&gt; I GOT TO SLAY IT." THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND HE becomes he I'm NOT GOING TO DRAMATIZE IT, BUT HE BECOMES BESIDE HIMSELF &gt;&gt; AND HE'S HACKING AT THE THROAT OF THIS LAMB. &gt;&gt; HEY, HE HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY ACTING OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; GOING TO BE BRUTALIZED ON THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME, FRIENDS? &gt;&gt; I hope you don't think I'm off my rocker. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET, OUR PROPHET SAID HE BY REVELATION &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KEY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY REVELATION DOESN'T SAY HE HEARD A VOICE. SOMEBODY CAME AND PREACHED TO HIM. SOMEBODY GAVE HIM A MESSAGE. I'M SAYING ALL OF THAT. THERE'S nothing wrong with preaching. NOTHING WRONG WITH WE'RE GOING TO BE PREACHING HERE. NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR WITNESSING. IT HAS TO GO BEYOND THAT. AND WE NEED TO EXERCISE OURSELVES TO OUR inner hearing. &gt;&gt; And the reason why I even hesitated on this subject because I've had people come up with the wonkiest revelations. The wonkiest revelation. Well, God told me really, &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE that it ALSO LINES UP WITH THE word of God. A true revelation will be in HARMONY WITH THE WORD OF GOD. Brother Brandham had a man minister and another woman who was telling him all about their their oh great things and all the rest of it and and he said well God told him to he had a dream and brother Brandham said well it's very sweet but it's not recording the word of God &gt;&gt; you can have all kinds of you know revelations and things and &gt;&gt; I had people come and sometime you know try to give advice or counsel about how the church or this or that about the people or about this brother that brother I tell you what the first thing that I want to do is see their life in accordance with the word of God and if their life doesn't line up with the word of God I haven't got the time of the day for it &gt;&gt; I don't want to sound harsh but that's the truth friends We don't know how much more time we want. And I'm not interested in wasting it on what somebody thinks or some serpent seed thinks cuz there going to be lots of it around. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. There's more serpent seed out there than there is God's seed. &gt;&gt; And don't THINK FOR A SECOND THAT THEY'RE AFRAID of these walls. &gt;&gt; NOT A BIT. THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF YOU OR your home or anything else. SATAN IS SO BRAZEN. HE'LL COME RIGHT IN. AND NOTICE WHAT HE CAME IN WHEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO JESUS CHRIST. WHAT HE FINALLY CAME TO. IF YOU'LL FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP ME. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SPEAKS, HE WANTS WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AND THEN, BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES IN THE TIMES I DESCRIBED A MOMENT AGO WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS FALLING IN 1948, REVIVAL THROUGH TO 1958. AND WOO, people had all kinds of chills down their back and ALL KINDS OF THINGS HAPPENING. BUT WHEN THE WORD CAME, THUS SAYETH the Lord, they don't have anything to do with it. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS THE ACID TEST. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I SAT IN FELLOWSHIP WITH. A LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE SEEN THEM WEEP. I'VE SEEN THEM AT THE ALTAR. I'VE SEEN THEM DOING ANYTHING YOU AND I DO AND SING LIKE ANGELS. BUT WHEN THE WORD CAME, TURN IT DOWN. And I tell you, my brother, my sister, ANYBODY THAT'S HEARING TO MY VOICE or hearing me today, and I don't care what office they whether they're a minister or or whether they're a deacon or whether they're a trustee or what they are &gt;&gt; when they come to THAT MESSAGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY VINDICATED VOICE THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE HEAVENS. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ONLY VINDICATED VOICE WE'VE HAD ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THEY READ THAT AND SAY, "WELL, BUT THAT doesn't mean anything. That doesn't apply." I'm sorry. That's where our relationship ends. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, the prophet didn't do that. THAT'S NOT THE PROPHET STYLE. That's not his pattern." Well, well, we've gone on. WELL, THEN YOU CAN JUST KEEP GOING ON. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Abel offered a revelation. The Bible says, "By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Can I go on just a little bit, please? &gt;&gt; Then Cain, by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and by by it he being dead yet speaketh. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? And the prophet said in the message I will restore. Abel had a vision from the Lord. It was spiritually it was spiritual revealed truth &gt;&gt; that it wasn't apples that brought them out of the Garden of Eden. He believed God &gt;&gt; because God had revealed it to him. &gt;&gt; That's why he believed God because it was revealed to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "How do you think that Abel knew to bring a lamb instead of an apple or whatever you want to call it? How did he know to bring a lamb? Because no Bible was written in them days. &gt;&gt; How did he know?" Listen friends, he's not asking a question just to be trick people. How did he know to bring a lamb when there was no Bible written? So the prophet's saying what I'm trying to say today, there were no words. &gt;&gt; He didn't read it in a book. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, under the authority of God's word, YOU POSSESS SOMETHING. WE GET SO IN TUNE with this world. And and I see ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY AND THEY GOT HEADPHONES IN THERE AND they're just going down THE STREET AND JUST chugging along, you know, AND EVERYBODY THE WHOLE PLACE IS OBSESSED WITH IT and and all the music and all the videos and all that. What it is that is to the senses &gt;&gt; of the body, the hearing. AND WE'RE SO CONSUMED WITH THOSE SENSES, YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU WILL NEVER ACQUIRE AN INNER VOICE. YOU'LL NEVER ACQUIRE AN INNER HEARING IF YOU STAY CONSUMED WITH WHAT TOUCHES THIS BODY. AND THEN FROM THE BODY IT GETS TO THE EMOTIONAL REALM AND YOU START FEELING CONNECTED TO PEOPLE AND YOU START FEELING A CERTAIN EMOTION AND IT'LL TURN A LOT OF IT WILL TURN PERVERTED SEXUAL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE AVENUE THAT SATAN IS USING. &gt;&gt; And then I SAID A MOMENT AGO, EXCUSE ME FOR GOING BACK. I SAID BUT THEN AT A time when when there's the the soul and the spirit become so almost homogenized together at a time of of marriage or or you know engagement or love at a time of in the meetings at a time when there's an intense move of God or at a time when there are other times too it or a time of death &gt;&gt; and they become so tight &gt;&gt; homogenized together &gt;&gt; don't don't leave us out on a limb brother Ed I won't I'll take you right back to the message and ask you also another question you have to ask yourself why why when people were standing in front of the prophet and and and they were at a crisis I see a dark shadow over you uh Uh, I see your your husband is in the hospital. I see him in the hospital as I read it yesterday. He's in the hospital and he's dying with tuberculosis. DON'T TELL ME THAT SHE WASN'T in in the in the throws of agony. &gt;&gt; Your husband's DYING IN THE HOSPITAL WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND SHE'S STANDING THERE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER. &gt;&gt; SO, SHE'S COMING FOR AN ANSWER. AND THE PROPHET, HE WOULD TRY TO TOUCH THE uh uh the unconscious realm, that realm where faith IS AND TRY TO SPEAK TO HER SO THAT FAITH COULD RAISE. WHAT IS FAITH? A REVELATION &gt;&gt; SO THAT SHE COULD GET A REVELATION AND ACTUALLY SEE IF SHE HAD A COMPLETE REVELATION, SHE WOULD SEE HER HUSBAND ACTUALLY HEALED. FOR FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT COMING OUT OF THE PROPHET'S MOUTH THAT COULD SEPARATE BETWEEN THE AGONY AND THE TURMOIL and the emotion of her whole being AND THIS CATASTROPHIC THING THAT'S HAPPENING? He would say, "For the word," now don't get ahead of me. "For the word of God, the word of God is quick and powerful &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword, &gt;&gt; piercing even to &gt;&gt; even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit." &gt;&gt; Not spirit and body, &gt;&gt; BUT SOUL AND SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; SATAN IN Satan's Eden has GOT HIS HIS FORCES SO customized and customized a thing for the people of this age that he's ACTUALLY GETTING THEIR BODY AND THEIR SPIRIT ALMOST MERGED into one. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? But when it comes to the word of God, the word of GOD COMES AND SO YOU SAY, "WELL, WELL, WE'RE IN LOVE FOR this reason or or and we have a a serious sickness or we have a at a time of death, the the the emotion and everything and people get get to the point, excuse me, &gt;&gt; they'll say, "Ah, I went through such an experience I had such an experience with God. I can never be the same. Yeah, I've heard it too. 6 months down the road, they're exactly the same. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll, are you questioning the experience? Not a bit. &gt;&gt; It's just that the experience was so close. The soul and the spirit was so close that it was all in the spirit realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And then you have to say, well, okay, I'm going deep now. Then you have to say, well, then what? Why did I have that experience? Well, you need to check it out. Is it something in your memory? Something in your conscience? Is it something in your imagination? Something that has loomed up and in your imagination say, "Yeah, I know I'll never be the same." You know, I was so close to mommy or so close to daddy or uh I just have such an experience with God. I just felt shivers go all over me. friends has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; People are here at the altar, they weep, they pound the altar. I've prayed with people, they pound the altar. Brother Brown talks about the preachers that get on the pulpit, get get on the platform and then they start telling they preach and the people feel pricked and then they start telling a sad story &gt;&gt; and jerk some tears out of the people and brother Brandham get against that because all it touched was the emotions &gt;&gt; and the people and then as soon as they walk out there's hordes of hell and Satan there and said you didn't get anything. Look, look at all the trouble you have now. And said, "Yeah, maybe I guess I guess I didn't get it." &gt;&gt; You got to give me a few minutes. &gt;&gt; If you get weary, I'll have you stand up and shake hands. But if you can hang on for a little bit, the Bible says, "He came under his own, his own received him not." And then the and the word was made flesh. The word the word. It wasn't amen, hallelujah, glory to God. That was made flesh. It wasn't, "Oh my Jesus, I love you. I know thou art mine." That isn't what was made flesh. There's no sound that I know of that was made flesh. Brother Bram says that that which came out of the bosom of the father, which was the logos, which was the word. But as far as I know, there's no verbiage, there's no sound, there's no sentence. What was made flesh? The revelation of God &gt;&gt; was made flesh. &gt;&gt; The revelation of God WAS MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS IN [screaming] CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now listen very close. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so after that, God had dwelt here for some time and had gathered some men around him and they didn't even KNOW EXACTLY WHY THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIM. COME AND follow me. I'll make you fishers of men. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody said, "Boy, that sounds interesting." &gt;&gt; But there was something deeper. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus has his disciples around him. Follow me very close now because this is key to the service. Who do men say I am? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOUR PROPHET returned to that scripture? &gt;&gt; THAT'S A FOUNDATION TO THE WHOLE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE HE'S REPRESENTING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S the one he's revealing. &gt;&gt; WHO DO MEN SAY I AM? &gt;&gt; I AM. &gt;&gt; Some say you're Elias or Elijah. What are THEY DOING? THEY'RE BACK IN THEIR MEMORY CHANNEL. WON'T work &gt;&gt; or one of the other prophets. &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SAY &gt;&gt; I AM? &gt;&gt; LISTEN CLOSE. NOW, &gt;&gt; THIS PHRASE HAS NEVER BEEN SPOKEN BEFORE. &gt;&gt; THOU ART THE CHRIST, &gt;&gt; THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD. BLESSED ART THOU, SIMON BARJONAH. FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU TOOK THAT SENTENCE &gt;&gt; and rearranged it, &gt;&gt; it doesn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; IT ISN'T JUST THE WORDS. It was the uh h association and the arrangement of the words THOU ART THE CHRIST. THERE'S NOTHING SACRED ABOUT THOU or art or Christ is an anointed one. &gt;&gt; But the ARRANGEMENT IS THOU ART THE CHRIST. WHEN I SAY don't ever think that, don't ever think it the way you thought it before. When I say this message IS JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT CHRIST I'M TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THEY WORSHIPED HIM AND GAVE THEIR LIVES TO HIM BECAUSE THEY SAW WHO HE WAS. THEY ACTUALLY WERE WORSHIPING ON THE BASIS OF THEIR REVELATION &gt;&gt; AND THE REVELATION CAME FROM GOD AND BECAME HIM. HE WAS THE REVELATION &gt;&gt; AND PETER CAME TO HE BROTHER PETER CAME TO WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO WORSHIP him &gt;&gt; because even after THAT HE WAS STILL WEAK. HE STILL HE STILL SET some curses at the at Calvary, &gt;&gt; but he was birthed again &gt;&gt; and he came to it. &gt;&gt; Listen to me closely. It has TO SAY SOMETHING SPECIFIC INSIDE. &gt;&gt; You can't JUST GO OUT AND SAY, "OH, that was a wonderful service." &gt;&gt; NO. WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU? I'M PREACHING TODAY THAT YOU CAN GO OUT OF HERE AND SAID, "I MET HIM AGAIN." &gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY MET HIM AGAIN. &gt;&gt; It would be my REWARD TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY, "I EMBRACED HIM AGAIN." AND HE EMBRACED ME AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT SERVICE. &gt;&gt; I FELT HIS ARMS AROUND ME. HALLELUJAH. NOT AN EMOTIONAL REALM, BUT IT was an experience. &gt;&gt; You say, "Can it be that real?" &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother, my sister, can be that REAL BECAUSE THOSE SAME MEN WENT AND and went to the martyrdom &gt;&gt; and gave their lives. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said they would never have given their lives for some just some dead formal thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I took and tried to arrange it and I couldn't make any sense of it. So I just I didn't have enough time. But thou art the Christ. Those words by themselves have no significance. You could put son over here and go over here and living somewhere else. Those words by themselves don't have the meaning. So whatever spoke, &gt;&gt; Peter heard &gt;&gt; the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And he received a revelation. &gt;&gt; You can hear the voice OF GOD AND STILL MAKE A MISTAKE. HE MADE A MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; He cursed at Calvary at the time of the judgment. &gt;&gt; That was that that wasn't that wasn't because of his revelation. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not have had anything to do with him after that, but God did &gt;&gt; and he became he became the one who had the keys to the kingdom &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO WITH THAT REVELATION. &gt;&gt; And that's why he COULD STAND ON THE day of PENTECOST BECAUSE IT HAD THE KEYS AND SAY, "HEAR ME." &gt;&gt; I GOT A MESSAGE NOW. HEAR ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I want to take one more. Saul of Tarsus who became Apostle Paul. And the Bible says in Acts the 9th chapter where it happened, it's recorded the happening. Listen close. And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." That's a very specific sentence. And the scripture tells us because he relates it later in when he's before I think Fesus. He says, "And I fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" And I answered, "Who art thou, Lord?" &gt;&gt; Now, here we are in English. Saul, Saul, what the sounds that are reaching your ears isn't what Saul heard, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I know it wasn't in English. He said it was in the Hebrew tongue. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So God was speaking to him in Hebrew. &gt;&gt; And he heard why speak why persecutest thou me and I fell to the ground. Now he fell to the ground. When you fall to the ground and brother Brandham gives it very very clearly. He said he would I'm going to read it for you. He said he WOULDN'T HAVE WORSHIPED AN IDOL. &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THE REVELATION CAME, WORSHIP CAME. I don't know when ever I'll preach like this again, but I've been trying on a couple of occasions to come to a place of I feel that if we obtain the kind of revelation, the kind of experience that we have that we should have and have had. I have no doubt that many of you have had it that it's followed by an extreme reverence. You find it often where they fell. And not just one of the last times I tried to bring that I I fell to my knees here. Not to be demonstrative but to depict what happens in the scripture and they fell. The angels came at Christ's birth to the shepherds and the shepherds fell. The Bible says a place they and I went to Ruth. Now I'm giving you where I went. And I talked about Ruth and when Boaz came said stay in the field. Stay here. You know, and she and when she saw that she came under his vision and under his attention. The Bible says she fell on her face. &gt;&gt; Why would you have such grace? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why have you focused on me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it that you've seen? &gt;&gt; What grace is this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That I SHOULD BE FOUND IN Boaz's field. &gt;&gt; And such reverence. And friends, that's the thing that's missing &gt;&gt; in the message today. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Is that kind of reverence, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Falling to your knees and falling on your face doesn't do it. But it's what happens as a result of &gt;&gt; the meeting, the revelation of God. And so the Bible says of Apostle Paul, "Who art thou Lord? I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest." He said, "And they that were with me, they saw indeed the light. They saw the light, and they were afraid. They had that emotion, but they heard not the voice of him that spake. They didn't hear. They didn't hear the words. You've heard me say it before, but now it comes with such a new strength and meaning. They didn't hear Saul. SAUL, WHY PERSECUTEST thou me? That's what they didn't hear. They maybe heard a big sound or or whether they heard anything. They saw a light that drove them to the earth. But they didn't. Neither did they obtain the revelation THAT THIS WAS CHRIST &gt;&gt; THE PERSON. He didn't JUST LOOK AT HIM. &gt;&gt; HE GAVE HIM HIS LIFE FROM THERE ON TO HIS DEATH. &gt;&gt; I MUST go to Rome. But don't GO TO ROME. I MUST GO to Jerusalem. And they they theypt on his shoulder. It's the last time YOU SEE ME. I'M ON MY way to Rome. &gt;&gt; You're going to die in Rome. &gt;&gt; Nothing meant anything ANYMORE BECAUSE HE MET THE PERSON. &gt;&gt; He knew he had A MISSION TO FILL. &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE COULD SAY, "I FINISHED MY COURSE. &gt;&gt; I'VE RUN THE RACE. HENCEFORTH THERE'S A CROWN LAID UP FOR ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I can take you to other places in the scripture but we haven't got time. But I will just say to this congregation, to all on the internet, God bless you. Thank you for your prayers. Thank you for your emails. Thank you for your gifts that help it help us to continue doing what it is we're doing. Now, here's a difficult little short quote, but it's right. It thought of Christ as the mystery of God revealed. And I'm going to close. He said, "Look, Christ in you makes him the center of life &gt;&gt; of the revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a revelation. But he said Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation. &gt;&gt; He said Christ in the Bible makes the Bible a complete revelation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ in the Bible. Christ in the Bible. I'll tell you what friends, this revelation of when I came to know and came to understand uh the doctrines of the message and took it to the Bible. This Bible exploded with life. &gt;&gt; But I found that he who is the center of that life was none other than Christ. &gt;&gt; It was Christ who was the center of that life. AND YOU ENTER INTO RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's easy to sing my Jesus. &gt;&gt; I love thee. &gt;&gt; I know thou art mine. &gt;&gt; For thee all the follyies of sin I resign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My gracious redeemer, my savior art thou. If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. It's my New Year's message. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's what we need in 2012. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. I see you girls here, young ladies, you young fellas. You see b with his white hair. I was your age once. I was your age. I sat in meetings just like this. Sister Ruth sat in meetings just like you girls from the time she was a small girl. Her daddy wasn't saved. Her daddy was a businessman. He was busy. He was curling and playing golf in the summer. But he was a wonderful man. And I realize this is on the internet, but I'm going to say it anyway, but her home was broken and mommy was down in the US in Montana [clears throat] and daddy was up north in business. And she and her daddy lived alone while she was 11 and 12. She played the piano and had a wonderful voice. And there was a broadcast on the radio at 7:00 in the morning. Sing them over again to me. Wonderful words of life. And the minister would come and get her. They live just not very far apart. And knock on the door. There she was at 12, 13 years old going down to the radio station to play the piano because everything had to be live. Listen friends, you look at brother and sister Bisco sitting here. I had to leave home when I was 15. I hadn't had come to 16th birthday yet. I was 15. I've been 16 in October, but I was 15. It was the end of May. And I got on the train and went over a,000 miles and went to work on a farm. And that was the last I had a home. And I moved about 11 times in a few years from one farm to another to another. I'll tell you something else. [snorts] One day I met him. &gt;&gt; One day I met him. And I could do bad things, but I can never forget that meeting. &gt;&gt; He's a different kind of a person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You'll never forget that kind of person. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of you here are struggling. I'm telling you right now, your struggles can end today. This one I'm talking about is here. &gt;&gt; And it wants to come by your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It want to change your situation. &gt;&gt; There isn't any situation that he can't handle. &gt;&gt; He's one he listen to me friends. I know there's lots of problems and lots of troubles and difficulty, but this one that I met, he he threw the stars in space, &gt;&gt; the planets. &gt;&gt; One of one day he said to his prophet, "Where's my family? All the heavens, my hands made them. I had stars by the billions. I got planets and galaxies and all these things in the earth I made. It's my foottool. Where's my family? Where's my children? &gt;&gt; Where's my household? I I can't have a relationship with the planet. &gt;&gt; Where's somebody that came out from me who loves me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want people just jumping around saying, "I'm a seed. I'm a seed, Jean." He wants to have a relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lots of times, don't don't use the excuse. Well, I didn't have a relationship here. I didn't have a father. I didn't have a mother. I come from hard time. I'm just telling you about sister Bisco and I. We both come from hard times. &gt;&gt; Very hard times. But we're going to a better time. And we're not sorry for one second for the life that we live that you could live and to come to know him. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you this testimony today. We come to know a person. &gt;&gt; And this message didn't come to make William Brandham some great person that's untouchable. That isn't why he came. &gt;&gt; He sent him as the last one in his hand. Elijah, I said, "Go to this cursed dark leodyian age and tell them and show them who I am." &gt;&gt; In one last attempt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in one last desperate attempt &gt;&gt; to have a people. And we can be all wallowed up in all kinds of oh glitter and all the all the holidays and all the stuff just stuff. &gt;&gt; ALL TAKE IT up with it. &gt;&gt; Preach it, brother. &gt;&gt; The young people are going to education. Get all the education that you need. But I wouldn't bother with anymore. &gt;&gt; It's not going to do you a whole lot of good. &gt;&gt; Get all the money you can get and give all that you can get. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be a good steward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get in the flesh and look at somebody say, "Well, you know, people put a picture of my house on the internet. How unkind. &gt;&gt; That's fine. Do what they want to do." My daddy died and left 32 cents in the bank. 32 cents. I worked for years and supported myself. Brother Brandham said he did for about 17 years. I did for at least 10 because I wanted anything that came in to be able to go out. Paid brother Roger Smith a salary and let the rest go and let the tapes go and just do whatever we can. Brother Lance Laru made tapes in the basement of our office. In one year, just under 100,000 tapes. &gt;&gt; That's where Brother Lance just after he got saved a while. That's where he met Tammy, his wife. She came from Ohio just to open up letters and to help respond. Friends, I say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, this is the course &gt;&gt; and I will not change that course. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the call, &gt;&gt; brother Ernie. Whether it's good times or whether it's hard times, whether people want to tell the truth or whether want whatever the devil wants to do, I'm not interested what the devil wants to do. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested what the devil wants to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we're talking about reality. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, why don't you mention that?" You know, the reason I don't mention that because I feel I feel about that big. I hear some of these people that have come from the Congo and what they've experienced and what they've gone through &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't I just tell you I admire them. &gt;&gt; I admire them and I think they know that. &gt;&gt; I admire them greatly and I say to you younger generation with your mothers and fathers and what they've gone through don't get caught up in the easy life &gt;&gt; of this generation. remain dedicated, &gt;&gt; remain separated. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't met this person, &gt;&gt; he's there for you to meet. &gt;&gt; And that's my message today. &gt;&gt; Don't just expect to just hear certain words put together. Say, I want to exercise that inner I've heard, but now I want to see. &gt;&gt; I want to exercise that faculty inside. Speak to me, Lord. Let's bow our heads. [snorts] Lord Jesus, I'm standing here feeling trembling, not knowing just what you would have me to do. But I pray that you will do your own will. Do your own purpose. Work it in the hearts of these people. Lord, I'm praying for a great transformation in Cloverdale Bible way. &gt;&gt; I pray that I pray that 2012 or the coming days, we're not looking way down the year, but I pray that in just the coming days, I ask that there will be a marked difference. Oh God, in the lives of the people and may your word which has been spoken through such a precious instrument, you sent Malachi 4. Yes, you sent a a vindicated prophet. I've seen that vindication all these years. I've been so moved, so moved. And I know we know now why you did it. You did it, Lord. That you could that we could see you. And I pray, I ask, oh Lord Jesus, that the this congregation of people and those on the internet when they are hearing these words, they will turn and look inward and hear your voice speaking to them. You spoke to Saul, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And you transformed him, oh God, into one of the mightiest apostles that wrote the New Testament mostly. Lord God, you spoke to Peter. You gave him a revelation that no rabbi or no parent, none of his parents could give it. And you told him, Jesus, flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee. And I move today, Lord, because I know that no flesh or blood how my father I loved him and how my wife's father I loved him and oh God even the prophet himself and sitting with him and hearing the words that he spoke out of his mouth but oh God is as marvelous as that was it only led me into a deeper walk a deeper life with you and that I can never forget Lord please Lord Jesus I pray that there'll be young and old here that will reach out, Father, and perhaps say something more, something more, more of you, Lord. &gt;&gt; More of you. I just need more of you. Speak, Lord. Speak my Lord, and I will do what you tell me to do. Let there be a consecrated life, Father. Many lives here now. These people are so precious and how we we appreciate them. I pray, Father, that you will make great changes &gt;&gt; from the ministry to the deacons &gt;&gt; in the lives of the trustees. Our brother Nathaniel Iverson's not here today, but we pray you'll bless him and Shelley with their loved ones and this congregation. Oh God, Father, Father, they're your children. &gt;&gt; They're your sheep, the sheep of your fold. Let them, I pray, taste of your nearness and your presence, Lord. And we're going to take a few moments now so that you can speak and say what you wish to say. Lord Jesus, I want to dedicate myself for the future. Father, whatever time you give us, forgive us our wrongs. Forgive us our lacks for being lax. Oh God, cause us not to live for self. Father, cause us, I pray, to live for the kingdom of God and to do all that we can in Jesus Christ's name. I ask that you'll bless these that are giving so much. Lord, in Africa when we see brother Bus and brother Mumba and these different ones, Lord, I pray that you will bless the bride, brother Dioa. Oh God, brother Caillou, men who've become very dear to us, who've sacrificed so much. I pray, oh God, that you will remember us. And now as we are beginning this new year, I ask in the name of Jesus that even at this moment, the Holy Spirit will come upon our young people, young men and young women who will rise and say, "I rise to take my stand amongst the righteous ones." Oh God, if there are those that are not yet full of your spirit, I pray that before the sun goes down today, they will be charged with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; charged with your spirit of God, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. I thank you for hearing me. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to these precious people. May these words remain with them. I pray Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like to sing more of you Lord. More of you. Would you stand with me? [music] [music] for of [music and singing] you. I had it all, [singing and music] but what I need is more [singing] of you. of [music] things [singing] I can feel. But yet [music] I [singing] [chant] see empty and [music] Lord hear [singing] my prayer for [music] you. Now we raise our hearts down of you. More [music] of you. More [singing] of you. I [singing] have it all. [music] But what I need is all [music] you. All things [music and singing] I had my but [music and singing] I hunger empty [music and singing] and Lord hear my prayer [music] for [singing] you. empty and bare. [singing] Lord, hear my prayer. [music] Lord, [singing] let's hear your voices now. Oh, empty [music] and Lord [singing] my prayer for you. [music] I think it would be good for us to start this year with a complete dedication. [music] &gt;&gt; Dedication of ourselves. Let us be a dedication service. Pass me not, oh gentle [music] Savior, [singing] [music] and hear [singing] my humble. [music] &gt;&gt; If you've never prayed it before, do it now. Do it now. [music] While on the offers [singing] now our calling, [music and singing] call out to him. Do not pass me [music and singing] by. Let's put it down just a little bit. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; in your [singing] savior. The Lord Jesus [music] such his name [singing] my [music] [singing] [music and singing] holy [music and singing] calling do not pass [singing] [music] me by. &gt;&gt; Before we sing that verse and that chorus again, [music] it just might be that there's someone. It's kind of where I'm at. [music] I just want to dedicate and lay it on. Whatever you say, Lord, that's what I want to do. [music] Time is slipping away from us so quickly. &gt;&gt; So quickly. &gt;&gt; So quickly. Sister Karen Adidone is here and [music] your brother's life and what happened. Sister Karen has so spoken to [music] my heart. But let us speak to this whole congregation. Yeah. [music] &gt;&gt; He came in his sickness and weakness and saw what brother Kim and those were doing in the school and he went right back [music] to his shop and made some metal hangers for the ceiling. Metal hangers that Lyall Ficken made are hanging in the school. And we all expected that perhaps he'd be standing here with us. And a young man 45 [music] years old. Men, we have no assurance. You young men, young ladies, teenagers, we're not laying a heavy on you. You don't know anything about your future. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; The greatest thing you can [music] do &gt;&gt; is give yourself to live a righteous life. &gt;&gt; Give. Say, I'm here to give myself. I'm here to give of myself. [music] &gt;&gt; And parents like [music] and I'm just going to open the the front here if you want to come and say I'd like to make a statement. I &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I really and you won't be looked down on if you don't come. That's fine. No, no. I just want those that feel they need to. Maybe things have been slipping [music] in and other things have been priorities and you want that all to change. [music] Don't come down without remembering the words that the one of whom I speak is here. [music] The one of whom I met is here. You [music] can meet him. &gt;&gt; Tell him what's in your heart [music] while we sing it again. Sing that first verse, brother. [music] &gt;&gt; That's fine. Let's call out to him. [music] [music] [singing] my own cry. [music] And while [music] on others so much [music] on the kingdom, [music] oh God, [music] oh God, oh wonder, do I pray, give me &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; A meeting will cause [singing] somebody with you Lord.

Let let what's in my soul touch you. &gt;&gt; Come and touch my own heart, oh God. Break down any resistance. [music] Break down any hardness. Those things that have been separating our fellowship, oh God, remove them out of my heart. Oh God, this missing life, oh God. Oh God, may we take [music] control of it, Lord, for the glory of God. May we give ourselves to you unreservedly. We give ourselves to you. [music] Forgive us Lord for becoming so occupied in this life. Forgive us oh God. Let us live for eternity and for eternal things. We consecrate ourselves Lord. I consecrate myself. Whatever it costs, whatever it is, whatever the cost. Oh God. [music] Oh God. I'll do what you want me to do. I'll be what you want me to be. I'll go where you want me to go, God. Whatever it is, Lord, let the effects of this service, let the effects of this congregation reach out, oh father, into other lands, other places. Oh Lord, in our community, oh God, we need something. We need something happening within our own congregation. Lord, we've been hungering after and they've been thirsting after you. Oh God, give people an experience that they've never even thought of before. They didn't even know existed before. Break down every wall. Lord, bring down every resistance. Oh God, may Satan be thoroughly defeated here, Father. Hallelujah. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you have liberty to pray. You have liberty to call upon him. Oh, he's given you words. Let the voice of your words be heard. My Lord. Yes. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. [music] Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. [music] Oh God. Oh God. [music] Let's all raise our hands in dedication &gt;&gt; and you tell them how you're dedicating yourself to [music] him. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to begin this first service in this new year in dedication and how you're prophet. Oh, how we respect the words you [music] spoke to him. How you've made yourself so known and so close and so real. Oh, God. I personally get so touched when I hear how tenderly you spoke to the people. How you desire to meet their needs, oh God, that you're so conscious. You're so aware. You're so present. We're raising our hands and raising our hearts to you. Giving ourselves unreservedly, oh God, to your will. We do not know how many days we have, Father, or months or years. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever the time may be, we want to live it for what is done for Christ. That is all it will last. &gt;&gt; Take this word, oh God, and make it a quickened flame. &gt;&gt; Within the lives of these individuals, Father, let your word burn like a fire, oh God, within our bones. Give us boldness &gt;&gt; to be a bold witness for you. Doing as your prophet said, let the character, let the beauty of this congregation be the character of the people. &gt;&gt; Teach us, oh Lord, your ways. [music] Teach us your ways. [music] &gt;&gt; Name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; All all to Jesus I surrender. All to him I freely give.

I'm broken because I went through [music] such a struggle. that how am I going to say this? How am I going to tell the people [music] within my heart? But I've been craving. I've been praying. God, give these precious people is just how precious you are to me. [music] Give them a taste of that same presence, that same atmosphere that was in the prophets meetings.

Friends, don't be shortch changed. &gt;&gt; The presence, [music] the presence of this word is belongs to us. &gt;&gt; It belongs to us. The supernatural belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Belong.

[music] And And I want you to be able to go from this place saying, "God, [music] I I know the person. I'm not just going to look. Maybe you just had a look this morning, but I'm not going to just look. I'm going to look till I see who it is." [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you pick up a book, when you pick up a message book, when you read a scripture, [music] you're reading about Jesus Christ, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, look at yourself. See where you'll be standing in that crowd. See yourself standing beside the road, standing beside the pathway. Here I am, Lord. I'll take my I'll take my place with the chosen few.

I'm going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, there's going to be lots that are within this message or say they're in this message. [music] Don't let that don't let that even affect you. &gt;&gt; There's going to be lots that go in that are in the message. I don't desire it. I don't desire it, but I'm afraid they're not getting ready for the rapture. [music] &gt;&gt; The rapture is coming. You know what the rapture is? The bride and [music] the bridegroom &gt;&gt; are so in love that he can't wait any longer. &gt;&gt; So, they're going to come home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to come to the place I made for you. &gt;&gt; Amen.
