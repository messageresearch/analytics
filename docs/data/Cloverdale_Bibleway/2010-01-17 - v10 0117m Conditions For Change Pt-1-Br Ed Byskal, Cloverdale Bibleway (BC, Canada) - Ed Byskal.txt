Please pray for brother Roberto. He's in northern Ontario handing out message books to the natives. He took an airplane flight and got on a train.

You know, I sit here in the congregation sometimes almost have to pinch myself to say, "Is this real?" I'm sitting among the saints of God in the presence of God. And sometimes I just stop singing and I listen to the worship and I think, "Lord, this is so wonderful." &gt;&gt; Thank you for allowing me to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way you feel this morning? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he brought you in? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[Music] Did you enjoy that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sisters. I have uh one testimony from brother Steven Rivas. A couple of months ago, I went out for prayer for lower back pain and ankle pain on my foot. Today, I'm painfree and I want to thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We thank God for that. Amen. We're going to sing that chorus. Lord, I love this presence that I feel. Then Sister Joanna is going to sing for us. Then we'll turn immediately to the word this morning. Amen. Lord, I love this presence that I feel. My heart is stirred. When I hear your word, there's nothing in life more real. Your gentle whispers of mercy, your tender touch that can heal. Lord, I love this preious presence that I feel. Lord, I love this presence. I feel my heart is stirred when I hear your word. There's nothing in life more. Your gentle whispers of mercy, your tender touch that can heal. Lord, I long this preious presence that I feel. [Music] Far dear than all that the world could impart was the message that came to my heart. How that Jesus alone for my sin did atone and Calary covers it all. The stripes that he bore and the thorns that he wore told of mercy and love ever more. And my heart bowed in shame as I called on his name. And Calary covers it all. Calary covers it all. My past with its guilt and stain, my guilt and despair. Jesus took on him there and Calary covers it all. How matchless the grace when I looked in his face of this Jesus my crucified Lord my redemption complete. I then found at his feet and Calary covers it all. How blessed the thoughts that my soul by him bought shall be his in the glory on high where with gladness and song I'll be one of the throne and calary covers it [Music] Calary covers it all. [Music] My past with its sin and stain, my guilt and despair. Jesus took on him there. And Calary covers it all. And Calary covers it all. Yes. Calary covers it all. [Music] Amen. Calvary covers it all. It's wonderful. You know, all week long I was thinking it would sure be nice to hear Sister Ruth sing. And I think this is as close as we get to Sister Ruth. Amen. Let's stand together as we change the order. We're going to sing that chorus, let go, and let God have his wonderful way. That's what's it about this morning. Just let go. Don't worry about the roast in the oven. what other people are doing outside of here. God's coming to speak to us this morning. Us. Let go of everything in your heart. Open up to your heart to him. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Because when God has his way, it's always wonderful. Amen. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrows will vanish. Your night turn to day. Let go and let God have his way. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrows will [Music] Once again, let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrow will vanish. Your night turn day. Let go and let God have his way. [Music] That's exactly what we intend to do. That's what we are doing. Amen. Nice to see all of you here and uh see you in expectation. Uh there's uh quite a few people away there at brother Ryan and Sister Yelena's wedding. And I understand there's about 40 uh or more that have gone and they're going to be joining and supporting the young couple. Uh we I have sent greetings on on our behalf and blessings upon them not only for today but for the future. Anyone who's gotten married knows you need blessings on the future. And so we pray and I sent uh greetings not only a greeting but that they would be blessed as they uh live their lives surrendered to God's work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the future that's an important thing. If you want to be blessed just you know give your give of yourself &gt;&gt; and the more we give of ourselves you'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll receive your reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're really happy about that and uh happy that you're all here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're in for a good time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Mike, for the letter, Brother Mike Ganny. I appreciate that. Amen. You get once a while you get, you know, you get a note, you get a letter, you get a phone call and say, "Thank you for the ministry uh and all the ministry to the bride." But the ones that minister to you, uh, just coming here to the pulpit just now, I I just had a letter, quite a large envelope, and I just opened up. It looked like quite official and looked like it might be something I should uh perhaps know or tend to, maybe something we need to pray about or speak about. and I opened it up and uh a brother that I know really quite well, he said, "This 2010, my wife and I decided that we wanted to write and we wanted to give special uh recognition to important things that have happened in our lives." And they said it was in a meeting that you were preaching and I gave the state that I was preaching in special meeting and they said God spoke through you and healed our home. &gt;&gt; The home was tore apart. &gt;&gt; And God healed the home. &gt;&gt; You know what's wonderful in this day is that God is not interested in raising up personalities. That was back in the days of Pentecost. It was like a personality cult. But today we have a message and we just preach that message. People that receive that message receive the benefit of the message. And often the minister doesn't even know about it. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Praise God. &gt;&gt; All the glory goes to him." &gt;&gt; And we just each one want to be a tool in his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nice to see Wayne Salon here as well. He's a associate with Milco. So we need to really pray for him and and then they can pray for one another. Uh Wayne worked also with uh uh worked closely with Michael Hunt and uh and uh Michael Mike had a real influence on his life. I believe that would be true. And uh he said when Mike left he said I believe this wouldn't be out of place. Wayne told Milky, "Then my life went downhill and then then God brought you along and now I'm coming back up." Well, that's what we're here for, Wayne. You see that? Come right back up. Amen. I have I have some greetings that I need to just uh give to you. Brother Dioa from the Congo wanted to greet you uh in email this week. and brother Sergey in Moscow. They're in planning on having the dedication of the church in Moscow, Lord willing, on the 1st of May. And we really need to pray for them. They're working so so hard. They won't have the everything everything in place, I suppose, but they just want to have the sanctuary with the washrooms and so on all finished, and they expect to have that done for uh May dedication. And uh so uh there he's asked uh myself if we we can come and be part of the dedication because the church here and the believers have had a big part of uh of building that church and they have worked and saints also in in uh in Europe as well. But we have sent uh uh we sent another $35,000 to them. You know, these people just wouldn't have a place to worship if it is impossible for them to have it if we didn't help them somehow. And I don't think it hurt us. &gt;&gt; None of the believers who gave didn't hurt them and we were able to be a blessing to them. Isn't that wonderful? That's just wonderful. And now three congregations came together so they could fellowship into one place. That's brother Sergey. Brother Garrett Rodal from Germany also was in touch with me and wants to be remembered to you. and brother Andre Pati and I'll be speaking about brother Andre Pati because he has worked extensively in Haiti for many years and they have a printing work in the heart of Haiti downtown in the city and I didn't know if there were believers or how many believers. Voice of God also have an office in uh downtown in the city of Haiti. And I I found out this two days ago, there's two 2,000 believers in the church in in the city of part of Prince itself. And so I'm going to be speaking about that a little bit later on. So we want to remember them as well. Now, I'm going to have you uh turn in the scripture if you would, and we can turn to uh 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter. And uh once you give you a moment to get there, then we're going to just have a word of prayer. I would like to say also about uh the prayer meetings that that have been here in the church and they've had it in the fellow in the chapel for years and uh I I already had it on my heart and I had been speaking to some other brothers and I wanted to I felt I'd like to have a change in the prayer meeting and uh have it in in the fellowship room and change the order of it a wee bit and encourage the people and I have not attended very few of the prayer meetings but I felt in my heart I want to be there so often I'm studying or visiting on a Friday evening but I just feel to to we need to get together and have a time of prayer about specific things at this time. And so we want to be making a formal announcement on that. And then for those of you that might be concerned about the meetings during February, especially while the Olympics are taking place here, and it's kind of an unknown thing, but we have decided to make some arrangements. So we have some meetings uh on this side, our regular services, and also on the US side for those that just find it almost impossible to get across the border. We don't know what kind of lineups or what kind of uh situation will be and we just don't want to make it overly burdensome to the people. So, we'll be making that announcement as well. Everyone feeling fine? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer. Dear Lord Jesus, thinking this week and as I was answering someone's mail, I thought of the words and how I hear your messenger, your prophet, our precious brother Brandham. How I hear him speak and speaks of you and he tells people how lovely &gt;&gt; you are. &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Lord, this morning I want to say before these people that you are indeed the lovely one. &gt;&gt; And I pray that there will be the presence of the Holy Spirit that will just brood over the people that everyone will feel in their heart. There'll just feel their heart warming and there'll be a presence there. Lord, as the people had remained standing and respect to the word now, which we are going to read, all of this would be in vain unless you would come and punctuate it with the Holy Ghost. We want the Holy Spirit to have absolute control of the meeting. Lord, we pray you'll save the lost. We pray you will loose those that are bound. We ask that you'll come and heal those that are sick. We pray father that you will give revelation of your word so it won't be some dead letter but it will be a living fire within our bones in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless the people now and all those on the streaming uh wherever they might be in the world we say God blessing upon them. Amen. In 1 Corinthians 15, I'm going to read verse 49 down to 52. And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither do corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is a promise out of the mouth of God and it cannot he will not uh move away from that. He won't change his mind about his word. In uh Revelation 21, there's one verse. I'll just read it for you. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea. a new heaven and a new earth. That'll be a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to speak on conditions for change. Think about that as you have your seats. Now, you'll need to focus as just as be as alert as you can because I want to take some of the things that are currently happening uh regarding the destruction in Haiti. But it was so fitting and was completely uh compatible with the message this morning because I had been studying uh and preparing on this change and the conditions for change. You know, you have to have I just want to take my time a little bit now. You you have to have certain conditions for change. There are many of us uh I'm I suppose most all of us that we desire change. &gt;&gt; If you're sick here this morning, you desire to be restored to health and that's a change. I I know it can be so sudden that you can just be afflicted with something and just in a moment you cannot do what you did an hour ago. You are restricted. You are hampered. You are ill. You are perhaps prone in bed. You just you and you need you need something to happen and there are certain conditions which perhaps have to be met in order to have that uh in order to bring about that change. There may be those and there are obviously from time to time we experience financial reversals and financial difficulties and the world has experienced what they call the meltdown and we've had a a huge huge losses. People have lost they've worked all their lives and they've lost their pensions. They've lost their uh equity in their 401k. They've lost their RRSPs on this side. They've lost their equity in their homes and maybe they had other property and maybe even lost that and lost their home period. Uh they need change. &gt;&gt; They need something to happen. And there may be those without work even today that do not have enough to pay this month's bills. They need something to change, something to happen. And uh so we we have that that's just that's just common place. That's something that uh we all experience and there isn't anyone I don't suppose anyone here but what we desire change sometimes things go sideways in our relationships you know within a family or within a church or within a within a country or wherever more and we need something to bring about change very often you need a a leader and I'm glad we have a leader called a great shepherd and he's master of change. &gt;&gt; And this scripture which we read, we have borne the image of the earthy. Well, that's no mystery. We're all sitting here and we're very much subjected to the earthy. But Paul says, "And we shall also bear the image of the heavenly." And that's a change we don't want to miss at all. That's something that wants we want to u uh anchor our faith in that &gt;&gt; flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of God and neither does corruption inherit incorruption. And today and in the last few days, we've been made so so mindful of the uh terrible calamity uh that has taken place in uh in in Haiti and in uh especially in the city of uh Port of Port of France. Uh uh I spoke with brother Andre Pati as I said a few moments ago and I spoke with him at at length. We had a a lovely conversation. and I we know each other very well and brother Andre felt years ago that he wanted to do something to for the message for the people in Haiti uh and they set up a printing operation and so as we've been doing for example in India and and many other countries uh he has uh focused on Haiti and his church which is in just east of Montreal uh he's they they have been working and he's been making many many trips down there. So my purpose for calling him was because you you you hear of some of these uh just disasters that take place as we've had in the Philippines recently. I think about four typhoons and uh and then you know believers have lost their homes and uh but I always thank God because I have a certain confidence that God is sparing his people &gt;&gt; and that's very important. We have a protection our Jehovah God is a protector &gt;&gt; of his people as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there there's just one I I just want to you know make known uh just one of my own inner feelings when I hear of uh of uh disasters and so often people get completely swallowed up in the emotion of the moment and I always feel it's better to do something that is on a long-term basis than just throw money at a problem that is just with no program no plan no anything else As uh as the saying goes, if a man needs some food, if he needs a fish, you're better off to buy him a fishing pole and then he goes and catches his own fish. And that way he can catch it today and catch one tomorrow and catch one if you just buy him a fish. That's all he's got. And so it's much much better if you give help on a on a a on an extended basis. We had one just recently and I'm just telling you these things because it's all part of my message today and it'll be quite different. But we had one recently where a a a pastor in the Philippines and he was quite young. He just suddenly died and he left a a congregation, left a wife with I think eight children and uh and and so word was sent out. And today of course you know word travels very very quickly. I receive it and maybe thousands of other people receive it on the internet and however more. So, somebody sends $50 and some $200 and some $500. And so, here we sit, but you don't know really what's happening, how is she being cared for? And quite frankly, what are her needs? We don't know what the needs are. What are the needs of the family? And so I sent word right away and I said, "Well, of course we're interested in helping the sister, but we want to determine what are her needs and what will her needs, how is I'm not worried about how she'll bury her husband and maybe pay some expenses today, tomorrow, but how will she feed the children next month and this year and next year? What's the program? What's the plan?" and she needs some commitment, you know, from the believers. And uh and so this was the word we sent to our brother over in the Philippines. And brother Ernie has always been very very close uh to anything that happens over there. And so uh uh we we we I wanted to know something else. I said I also know that there are churches in the Philippines which are large churches and there are people over there that are skilled people. Uh for the most part people don't earn big salaries but many of them earn a fairly good living. That would be if you're in Manila or in the in the in a larger centers. So I I wanted to know what are they doing for their own people? What do those churches do? It's not enough just to put your hand out and and hope that you know overseas and America and Europe will uh uh will be the answer all what are we doing for ourselves and what are the people doing there. So I wanted to know that those churches are also going to sacrifice and help uh help with the sister's needs and uh so it different information then began to uh come in to us and uh and the sister was very I thought she just did absolutely excellent. They were out in a very rural and in a poor area and so on and uh and she took some funds that she had received and set up a little market, a little bit of a store. And she's got children which are grown and can help her and now they have a little bit of a store and they they sell things and that way she has a living. And I thought that was very nice. And so we offered also to help. And we I said, "We'd like to find out exactly what does she need per month." And and it was all sorted out. And the brother over there, they went over all the things that she would need for her and a family. And about $400 a month, uh helped her. And and we did exactly the same thing with a sister who lost her husband. She's a young sister. She lost her husband in China. Well, we didn't want to just, you know, as I said, throw money at a problem. We want to know what is the degree of the problem. What is her needs? And brother Murphy did exactly the same thing. I asked him to find out and he came back and she needed X amount per month. And so we here as a church, we weren't willing to wait for anyone else. We just said we will provide those funds for her every month for a year. So, she knows that she will be looked after uh for a year. And I think it was even before the year was over that we got word back that she's being cared for and she doesn't need our assistance anymore. And that's the way I think the body of Christ should work. Doesn't that sound good to you? &gt;&gt; So, that's why I was calling brother Andre Pati. I don't know. I know little or nothing about Haiti. I've left that to people that uh you know speak the French language and are very close and uh I knew that brother brother Andre Pati and his church and and others also I believe in Quebec City had been working uh so I said are there believers there? Well yes he said there's a very nice church of 2,000 believers right in Porta Prince and uh I said where do they worship? He said, "Well, they worship right downtown in the city." And he said, "And uh and the voice of God representative," he said, is a very good friend, a very fine man, and uh for a while he was looking after carrying for the voice of God work. Then he then he gave that up for a season, then he went back to it. So he's working with them uh at this time. And he said he's a very wellbalanced, a very fine man, and spoke very highly of him. He says, "And they have a distribution building there. And I have since discovered that the building where the voice of God is, I understand, is is collapsed. And the building where brother Andre Pati's printing work is collapsed." And but he spoke to the brother who's in charge of brother Abraham who's in charge of his printing work. And they have said that he was he was not injured. So we thank God for that. We do not know about others, but amongst 2,000 people, uh I would imagine that there there there must be uh uh incredible needs even for the essentials of of food and water and some medical things and so on. So I said to brother Andre, we they they have a website and uh and you can get the website from brother Kim and you can donate if you wish directly there. We're going to take an offering this morning, but you may not be ready for it. That's fine. But you can also give in uh you can just give it to the office and just put it to Haiti and and we will send it on your behalf uh directly. Uh there's a possibility and I don't know uh just the logistics of it but the Canadian government has agreed to match all donations that are made to a to a uh a recognized charity which we are and we'll be giving to brother Andre Pati and he's a recognized charity and so I don't know just how that works but uh have you looked into some of that brother Kim? how yeah how that works. So uh there's a possibility that whatever we give they may match that or whatever you give and we'll keep track of it. So put your name if you would on the envelope if you wish or however you wish to do it and uh but we'll take up an offering at the end of this service but you can also bear this in mind at the same time. Uh I got word also from uh brother Andre on on the 14th uh January couple days ago and he said that we had no news up until today when I was finally able to speak to brother Abraham for a few seconds before the line was out. There had been no communication whatsoever. Brother Abraham works at the message printing shop. we have been operating out of Haiti for the past few years. He just had time to tell me that by the grace of God, he was doing okay, that he hadn't heard about any believers losing their lives, but that the building owned by brother George uh Lamar, I believe it is, where the printing shop was set up, was in ruins. and brother George's in-laws property where brother Guy Contave uh lives. Brother Guy is responsible for the voice of God distribution is also totally ruined and we will keep you posted as soon as we have any developments. I have asked brother Pati because he had been scheduled to uh fly and be there on January the 27th and uh so he felt when he when the earthquake took place and everything that he was not going to try to change his schedule. He just try to stay with the schedule because there's no flights that other than military and aid flights that are being allowed right now. So, he plans to go on the 27th. And then I received a call and I believe this will be all right to brother Randy Snow uh was made was in contact or people from Phoenix who he has work done work for called him and asked him if he would also go to Haiti as uh and and contribute two weeks of his time because they need team leaders to uh assist with getting uh construction and some temporary uh structures up. And so, Brother Randy was asking me about the believers that are there because they will obviously need to employ some believers. And so, you can pray with Brother Randy. He's just uh praying about this now. He's supposed to leave also in a couple weeks. So, if you go there, Brother Randy, you'll be there at the same time that Brother Andre Pati is there and you could work together with him. So, we don't know how much involvement that this will all be. But I do know that if there's believers that are in need, uh uh it's up to us to have compassion and to do what we can. Uh I just have some some slides here quickly and I suppose most of these you have seen, but uh maybe we could dim the lights a wee bit. Please, the house lights. And so we could just see these now. And I trust I I have I have not taken the most shocking uh of but all of those are bodies and the people are standing there. They have up till yesterday morning they have buried 40,000 people and they have no idea of how many. We've heard 50,000. Then we've heard 200,000. And they don't know. They've just had to put them into mass graves. Here's a man stepping over bodies and probably looking for his relatives. Uh a woman finally getting a a drink of water. There's a building that's completely collapsed. That is a school. And it's unfortunate. You see a pair of legs out there. People are there's one one school of 700 children totally collapsed and they don't hear any sound of life in it. And another school of 300 and it totally collapsed. Now this is a calamity. &gt;&gt; But friends don't forget this is not a greatest calamity is coming. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've already been we've already been spoken very specifically of what is taking place. But you can imagine, you know, this is just a few hours away on a plane and you'd be uh there uh trying to determine what what is life all about. Uh this is from St. Gerard Technical School. There's an entire building is just open on one side and I saw one touching picture where a man is telling the people he's saying tell them to be quiet because he's trying to hear. They're tapping and they're trying to hear if there's anyone tapping on the inside if there's any life. They just pulled a little baby out that was and she's fine. A little girl. She was in there for 68 hours and I don't know how she lived but she seems to be fine. This man, his daughter passed away. This is the difficulty there, Randy, which I know you've seen as well, but the the scope of the the scope of the destruction. It's not merely the scope of it, but the United Nations from Geneva said this week, "This is the greatest disaster since the United Nations was formed." And that this is a greater disaster than the tsunami which took over almost 300,000 lives, more death, but but they had the infrastructure in place there. The police were still in place. The military was still in place. The government was still in place. And the United Nations used these words. Haiti has been decapitated because the police building collapsed with the police in it. Uh government buildings are destroyed and it is a country without any real uh direction at this time. And if it were not for the United States that went in to take some leadership, uh we're we're happy about that. And Canada sent ships out immediately. A hospital ship is on its way and uh several hundreds of soldiers and everything because they have to try to maintain order. So now we have members of the Polish uh search and rescue team get ready to depart for Haiti. And this is the French medical aid organization, uh, doctors of the world, and they're checking their list for their stuff. This is the Nicaraguan soldiers load a plane with humanitarian aid. Here's the Chinese search and rescue team getting ready to depart Beijing airport and they're being instructed by an officer. There's a medical equipment being loaded from Venezuela. There's over 20 nations. Look at this. This is a German Red Cross member walks through uh the medicine boxes and humanitarian aid at the logistical center in Berlin. And this is a another one here from the either I believe uh this one is either from the States or Canada. I believe it's the US. A Spanish rescuer with a 2-year-old cloud after he's rescued from a collapsed home. Does he have any parents? We don't know. Many of them don't. This is a very recent This morning picture. Injured girl is fed uh by a volunteer at the hospital in Porta Prince. And incidentally, the hospitals are out in the yards here. They're receiving water. Uh, and there's been such a shortage and they jostle each other during water distribution here. This is the golf course which is this is from this morning and they're making a makeshift camp and and they're just tens of thousands of people. They don't have any home. They don't have anything anymore. This is the backyard of a hospital and this is what it looks like. The hospital of course isn't able to hold any more people. I thought this was very moving, very touching. This is also from this morning. They've got a a machine and this woman. She's alive and conscious, but she's buried under the collapse university and excuse me. And they've not been able to get her out at the time that I had this photo. And a girl here could be any girl here. She's comforts her injured mother at a market in Port of France. And so that is those uh pictures which I thought it would be fine to show those. So we can shut that off now. Thank you. Have our lights back up. I expect that it's quiet, but I would like to say because I been speaking and I want to speak to you on the conditions for change. These people need a change. &gt;&gt; I think you would agree with me. They need a change. And so the nations of the world reacted. Yes, we'll come there from 20 nations or more. In comes the aircraft. In comes the soldiers. In comes the medical team. They left here from Vancouver immediately after they heard of it. firefighters are coming from different countries and all kinds of workers and police and medical aid and and a school group from over in uh eastern British Columbia are there and they they just come from churches and all over a church in Pennsylvania. They they loaded up their people and and flew into an adjoining country and drove people in nurses and just people to try to help. And then there's there those are wonderful stories. And then you hear the very saddest story. Some sad stories. A woman from here went there just to do uh excuse me do some you know to give herself and she was she was had landed in Porta Prince and was there 90 minutes when the earthquake took place and she was killed. And you have these, you know, you wonder, well, why do good bad things happen to good people or they have good intent. But what we have now is is so in keeping with where I want to project this in a spiritual sense as well. We have all of this aid. We have all of this outpouring of compassion. You have all of this desire that's pent up and built in within the people. And people want to do things that they can't even do. Do you know why? Because there isn't a there isn't a channel open. &gt;&gt; There are. And so people are busy trying to put channels together. And you've got to create certain conditions. They can't get they can't get the aid from the airport to the people because of the conditions, the the the roads, the destruction, but and no equipment to do things. So my my principal thought is you've got to have you must have conditions in order for change to happen. There's certain conditions that have to be met. And as as as as much as we would twist and turn and say, well, something has to happen. I just feel, oh, God, something has to happen. But there has to be some real conditions take place. There may have to be skilled people. There may have to be now I want you to think about in the in the spiritual sense as well. There has to be certain things in place and then a a a channel. I'll just stay with this uh uh the the Haiti situation for a moment. uh the it it would only be natural I think that the uh president of the United States, President Obama, who's the highest officer of the wealthiest nation, I would guess uh at least it's a a super power, the super power recognized on the earth. It would it is only right. And I I just saw him on the MSNBC news on my computer and he and he stands forward and says, "We say to the people of Haiti that uh we will be there uh and you will not be forgotten." In other words, we're committing ourselves to be there for uh for the long term. Then he realized now that's the channel you see and the the the I want you to get my thought now because this is important. That's the channel. He's he's he's the one there isn't anyone else who could gather that kind of force and make the kind of financial commitment to to bring the people together and to direct things. He realized he needed more. So he called two previous presidents, Clinton and Bush, to his side, asked them if they would assume responsibility to see that this continues and that this doesn't get out of focus and because a president of a nation such as the United States is having many many other things to deal with and while other things are being dealt with the economy or the health care and all of these things, they don't want to lose sight of Haiti and its needs because it's not going to be resolved in 30 days. It's not going to be resolved in. So now you have the three things you have my my subject that the the things need desperately to change. Some you may be in a situation. I want you to apply the principle. We get into situations in life spiritually and even naturally or emotionally or whatever other way. I don't know. Even the devil may have been talking to you this last week saying, "Well, that's just hopeless. What is hopeless?" Because something inside of you say uh this needs to change or I need to change or this relation relationship needs to change or my physical health needs to change something. Oh God where's the answer? Well I tell you in order for it to change you have to have conditions. There are certain conditions that need to change. And the conditions are uh the change is dependent on the conditions. With this right here that I've just showed you, unless they got equipment to clean up the streets, they won't have a change. Unless they get people, skilled workers, willing workers, compassionate people, compassionate nations. You can have all of that. You can have all the desire you want, but it has to it has to filter down into the real world. It has to filter down into real work and then and then change can happen. But even that can't happen unless there's a channel. Now this is going to really this is going to take you on a surprise in a few moments. You've got to have a channel and it's got to be a channel in this case. And on behalf of Haiti, I will say that uh President Bush him uh not President Bush, but President Obama, President Bush and President Clinton joining together. But the one the president who's in place, he's he he's an elected channel and he's the one who is is is authorized. He's the one who can say, "We're going to commit, you know, these hundreds of millions of dollars. We're going to do this and we're going to bring about a a change and we're going to stand with these people." And that is uh that's about the only way that it can really happen. But now as believers, we know that this world is due for a catastrophic events &gt;&gt; that make this like kindergarten. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what this book says. &gt;&gt; And it is going to happen. And now we've had a prophet in this generation, not just a preacher, but a prophet. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation today before you lose the effect of the pictures which you just saw. And you'll agree with me there needs desperately to be change. You'll agree with me, I'm sure, that there must be conditions for that change. And you'll agree with me that there must be a channel that is ordained by the authorities or the by the powers. And in our case, in the spiritual sense, the authority can only come from almighty God. He's the authority. And he says he will do nothing. N O T H I N G. He will do nothing, but he will show it first to his servants, the prophets. Now you have the channel &gt;&gt; and that's the channel that the creator is using &gt;&gt; and I have it all through the message and we have it all through the scripture. God will do nothing. And so then today it would be only uh it would be the greatest trickery of the enemy for us to dilute or to play down what the prophet messenger and I'm standing here before you today as sometimes a troubled person because I will speak to individuals or speak to families to say well the messenger the messenger let's say it another word the channel, &gt;&gt; a higher channel than the president of any nation. &gt;&gt; I expect that you would say amen to that. The highest channel, the highest office &gt;&gt; that's been given to a human &gt;&gt; in this entire age was given to that one man. &gt;&gt; And what he says came to pass. and what still remains unfulfilled will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He he speaks of in the future home. So this is something that we look forward to. He said in this new earth, the skies will never black again. No, he said that's from the curse. What we've seen on the screen is just a little trickle. I didn't even show the worst which you've seen them. But it's just a it's just infotal of the suffering that's happening and the agony that's going on this morning while we sit here in the comfort of this church. People are out there. They don't have any livelihood. They don't have any food. They don't have any future. They don't have a home. They don't have nothing. Nothing. They've been reduced to less than even the animals that can look after themselves. They're so dependent. They have nothing. Right? &gt;&gt; But that's just a toothache &gt;&gt; compared to what this world is in for. The prophet of God said that this earth will belch. &gt;&gt; And he said furthermore when he prophesied of the destruction of California, he said Los Angeles will sink below the ocean. &gt;&gt; And he said it'll be like Capernium which could never be found again. It's going to lay below the ocean. And he said, "The ocean will weep its way clean into the desert, clean into the salt and sea." Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That is the author. That is the creator who created. He said, "You people talk about hell." He said, "The earth, the earth is a bubbling. It's it's a belching uh of molten rock. You're on hell every day." Right. &gt;&gt; And he said when that takes place in California, he said it'll be worse than the days of Pompei, the last days of Pompei. I have visited Pompei on two occasions. And I had my family there uh a year or so ago and and there's people that has sprawled out there. You you can see them clawing trying to make their way out of the building. and and and by the time uh uh Vuvius, I believe it was, Mount Vuvius, it it it poured down over 60 ft of ash, hot burning uh chemical ash on the people and and they just they they're caught in their motion. They're caught in their attempt to escape. And the prophet says, "This will be worse than the last days of Pompei." I tell you friends, people want to ask, well, uh, you know, will we have a chance then? I wouldn't even attempt to have a chance then. This is your chance. &gt;&gt; This is your time. &gt;&gt; This is a time to take serious what God has said. &gt;&gt; He said, "There be no more the curse. Never will it be black again with angry clouds. Winds will never blow across her again." We're talking about behold I make a new heaven and a new earth. My brother, my sister, this world is due for a change. I'm going to declare to the top of my lungs and with all the force and energy I have, you can have this world. I want the one the prophet speaking about. &gt;&gt; I want the one that Jesus spoke of, I'll make all things new. There'll be a new heaven and there'll be a new earth wherein will dwell righteousness and justice for all. Hallelujah. That's a promise to you. And it came in this age through God's ordained channel. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "No, she'll never tear up the trees and tear up the houses and turn over the things and lightning and the wrath will never belch from Satan across there and kill a man walking down the road or burn up a building. No, no more. There'll be no more typhoon sweep down." We could say to the Philippines, "There'll be no more typhoons you've had four just recently." And they'll hear this message in the in the Philippines as well. There'll be no more of that. There'll be no more winds to come down and to kill and destroy and to wrench family members one from the other. Be no more man standing there holding his his dead baby. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Death will be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Here we have too much of it. But death's an enemy. Right. No more typhoons and tornadoes to tear up houses and kill little children and things. Won't be no more trying to destroy. It won't be there. Satan is cast out. &gt;&gt; And I believe that there's a life that we have within us as a believer today according to the word of God, eternal life for the believer. And it's that life that's going to that's going to experience and live in that in that heavenly place. It's not some pie in the sky. The same messenger said it's like going through the doorway from the elements of the interior to the elements of the exterior. He said it's just a door. That's all it is. These bodies are going to they're fading away right now while we're sitting here. We're getting older. But there is a land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. where we won't have these things anymore and we don't have death and we won't need money and we won't have rotten politics and all of these rotten things. My friends, we're on our way out of here according to God's word. And if we don't have God's word, then we might as well all pack it in and just give it up. But this is the truth. &gt;&gt; This is yay and amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can make all the promises and have all the wishes and all the desires that you want and all the plans, but they'll fail. &gt;&gt; And this will not fail. &gt;&gt; This is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth have met. He said that's what he's talking about now. Heavens and earth have met and God and man is reconciled. Here we come back now to the messages I've been speaking on. A restored Eden has begun. &gt;&gt; I say, when did it begin? Well, if it hadn't begun already, it began when he said those words. &gt;&gt; You might think I'm a fanatic, but I'm going to go the whole distance this morning. You can call me as big a fanatic as you want. But when God the author had his agent on earth, a prophet vindicated prophet messenger, what was coming out of his mouth was creation. &gt;&gt; What was coming out of his mouth was judgment. &gt;&gt; What was coming out of his mouth was both restoration and destruction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what he has a prophet on the earth for. He is a messenger. a messenger to tell the people what's happening. &gt;&gt; Things that are covered, he uncovers them. This is really what's happening. And this is what's taking place. You may think, "Oh, everything is going. We we live in a nice country and all the rest of it, but you need a prophet to say it's rotten to the core. &gt;&gt; This country and every country." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "And all the curse is gone." Now he's we've gone from the what what is going to pass away to what it will be. And the curse is gone just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you. &gt;&gt; You don't accept it. It accepts you cuz go cuz it's God's attribute. &gt;&gt; He said if you were see yet you were born in sin but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on earth. That's what you're doing today. You express yourself here on earth and he comes down and gets you. So you're back here. He said, "Here's where you belong. Sin's lost its power." &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say it. Sin's lost its power. &gt;&gt; Lost it power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unbelief has lost its power. &gt;&gt; It may hear, but it may be around. You may hear it all over, but it's lost its power. It's lost its effectiveness. You say, "Well, how do you know?" Because the the authorized voice said it. &gt;&gt; And that's where you have to pin your hope, your faith, and confidence. God's messenger said it. &gt;&gt; It's not that I say it and that I feel inspired. He said it. Sin lost its power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Unbelief has lost its power. G. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit comes in. You are a restored person. &gt;&gt; You are a restored person. &gt;&gt; If I wasn't before, if you believe this now, say God's messenger said it, you are a restored person. And Satan and sin has lost its power. You don't ever have to listen to him again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's the devil compared to a prophet of God? &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's Lucifer himself. Lucifer comes to you may show himself up and say, "Uh uh, I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and you're going to lose your mind and you're depressed." You say, "I've got a higher authority than you. I have a prophet from Almighty God who says, I am restored. &gt;&gt; I am restored. I have a prophet messenger who said you and sin has lost its power. &gt;&gt; Unbelief has lost its power. &gt;&gt; If I can get you to believe that today, you'll walk a different kind of a life. You'll have a different kind of a home and family. It'll be different from here on out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you can just get that concept that almighty God speaking through a vessel on earth. &gt;&gt; He said he could have had the son preach the gospel. He could have had the winds preach the gospel, but he chose man to preach the gospel. He wants to use your mouth as a testimony, as a witness, but he used and there's all kinds of vessels. But this this one now is God's authority. Uh Haiti needed President Obama as a channel. We've got another channel. &gt;&gt; And you, those of you that are familiar, you know all about channels. You know all about formats. And you've got to get in the right channel. &gt;&gt; People got a history channel and they got a memory channel and all of these different channels. And you can't get if one is a channel on a television 62. You won't get it at 52. It's got to you got to be in that right channel. You got to get in that right format. You've got to get right in that channel and and agree with all of your heart that this is God's channel. &gt;&gt; This is called a prophet channel. Not a history channel, not an imagination channel, a prophet channel. &gt;&gt; And he said certain things and those things can never fall. No word can go to the ground unfulfilled. It will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; When it says Los Angeles will sink and slide beneath the ocean, you count on that. &gt;&gt; That's more certain than your dinner this afternoon. More certain than you sitting where you are today. It will slide. People say, "Well, how, where?" Don't don't worry about that. God knows how and where and when. &gt;&gt; And it'll be that way. Yes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this, as you saw for 25 pictures, is just a it's not even a kindergarten stuff. &gt;&gt; It's not even a toothache compared to what there was. I saw a man on a documentary and he's from the Pentagon and he was standing on an overpass with Los Angeles behind him and he speaks into the camera and he said, "This is Los Angeles behind me." said, "They're talking about the earthquake." He said, "I'm not saying if it comes, I'm saying when it comes." He says, "And we've studied this." And he was from the Pentagon. And he he he's part of the official department of the government. I don't remember just exactly what the government what part of it now, but he was saying and he had write down the specifics. He said, "We have in United States 200 serious burn units." 200 in the whole nation of serious burn units. He said when this earthquake takes place, he said there will be probably upward of 100,000 people in need of serious burn units and we don't have them. He said we don't have enough medication. We don't have enough pain uh relief for the number of people that would be calling for it at that time. In fact, and he said this plainly, he said, "Don't feel sorry for the people that die. Feel sorry for the people that are alive." &gt;&gt; That's just a man of the world, &gt;&gt; Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; That's just a man. He he I don't know where he is today, but these are these are officials. These are speaking things that they know. Say, "Oh, God, where can we hide?" You can hide in Christ. &gt;&gt; You can hide this morning. I'm showing you where the shelter is. We have a protector. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they could drop an atomic bomb right on top of this church and no one would get killed if that was God's will. And then we could be vaporized into another dimension because what man devised cannot destroy the believer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are beyond that. He that believeth on me shall never die. that came out of Jesus mouth &gt;&gt; and we believe it &gt;&gt; and now he sent another mouth in this generation &gt;&gt; and that's the mouth we believe &gt;&gt; that's it just rejoice in it &gt;&gt; confess it &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; so you know we have there make great enormous efforts We make a lot of efforts. We We got a church building here or we have perhaps the internet and we got people that stream and people that uh work with the tapes and in the audio and in the visual and and all of these things and you're out there and you're working and you're giving and the effort that's being made, the desire that there is within the believer, oh God, that we can reach one more that we can help somebody. I tell you what, do what you can do while you can do it. &gt;&gt; Witness while you can. There will surely come a day and you won't even be able to do like you say, "Well, if I could do something for the people in Haiti, you don't have the channel. You don't have the you're not enabled to do it." But you are here. &gt;&gt; You're here able to do something uh uh within the call of God. You know, things that the world doesn't know. Your neighbors don't know. &gt;&gt; Right. And they're a reality, friends. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "And when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child." And notice these words, "They shall not escape." Who's God speaking to? Who's God speaking about? Who are they? Whoever they are, they shall not escape. You might not have thought that, well, I'm going to come to church this morning. We're going to sit there and we have a song service and hear some specials and hear a message. Listen, friends, we must not take this message casual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even to this present moment that we're in. And I don't care what kind of situation you get in, what kind of conversation you have, you make sure it's seasoned with what the prophet of God has said. &gt;&gt; I have absolutely been a gasast in recent months when a when a prophet messenger will make a certain statement concerning uh our individual life or concerning the church or concerning the offices of the church and there's a tendency well just to downplay it. doesn't it's not that important. And I have people I've had people even get offended. And I quoted I said, "Well, what was it?" They said, "Well, you said such and such and such and such." I said, "Well, just a moment." And I thought, "What was it?" And as I begin to say it, I recognize it was a quote. I said, "Well, that's a direct quote. I wasn't I reading a quote? Wasn't I reading a quote from the prophet's message?" And and the brother said, "Well, well, yeah, yeah, you were." I said, "Well, do you have a problem with what the prophet of God has spoken?" &gt;&gt; Well, no, not really. But I mean, the thing was there was a problem. Don't ever have a problem &gt;&gt; with what he spoke. &gt;&gt; I don't care how it strikes you or how it affects you. You put your feelings down and stop down on it and say, "What he said, that's that's what my confidence is in." Because even this old life of mine or yours could pass away. I'm not interested in people's feelings. I'm not interested. I've gone beyond that. Now, God's not even interested in my feelings. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that hurt me." So, it hurt. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Praise God, it hurt, but it's the truth anyway." [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. See, you can say amen, but I don't even need you to say amen. I'm going to preach it anyway &gt;&gt; because this precisely God's word. We've been here all of these years and for one purpose to make known what the messenger of the hour has said to to to do everything within our power and within our ability and to use our gra our resources to see that someone else will have it that someone else can read uh uh this message I got restoration of the of the bride tree I've been reading it was going to speak even more on it how I would love how I respect Brother Andre Pati or Voice of God or Brother Momus when he was living and all of these people and brother Perry Green that put books together. You never hear me say one word contrary to that. I thank God for every effort. I thank God for every printing press that's in the country. And people have things say, "Well, we don't do that." I wouldn't boast about that. I think every church should be involved in it. Say, "Do what we can. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're a believer and you do plan to cross beyond the curtain of time, and you will. One thing's for sure, if you're a believer, you're going to meet the messenger of this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't suggest that we would want to say, well, you know, we just stayed, you know, a little quiet. Us four and no more. We didn't have any concern for anyone else. I want to be able to run up. &gt;&gt; I want to be able to say, "Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; the message God gave you, I'm so thankful you were so true to it. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't let money or popularity or anything change it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were uncompromising with it &gt;&gt; and we tried to stay true to it and we tried to get it into every person's hand that we possibly could. &gt;&gt; We used every channel, every avenue to get it out. Encourage the people to get it out. &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What can be more important than thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And God gives us the privilege to let someone else know what thus sayith the Lord has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For as it was in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away. So also shall the coming of the Son of Man be. &gt;&gt; God has done things and he's taken the world by surprise. No one even understood when this little prophet messenger stood before the people and God begin to put him forward with uh indescribable healings. How would you have been? How would you have reacted? And I don't know where the people are. They were sitting in the building when they handed him that crippled and twisted up child into his arm and the bones begin to snap and crackle and the child was made whole and leaped out of his arms and a little uh uh little sister playing the piano like an Amish Amisher or something and she was playing the piano, the great physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus and she jumped away from the piano. But the moment the prophet said were so sacred that the piano continued to play the great physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus. Those things happened and God is introducing that kind of how wouldn't you listen? How wouldn't you hear that kind of a voice again? &gt;&gt; I would say it would be it would be absolutely ludicrous not to hear it and to believe it and what he says is the absolute Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he judged everything by the word. &gt;&gt; And someone said to him, "Did the angel tell you that?" He said, "If the angel told me anything contrary to the word of God, I wouldn't believe the angel." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger I I have a lot of confidence in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That message unfolds this word. You know, this is a mysterious word. Yes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; With all of the history and mankind and theology and all the studies and all the volumes of encyclopedias and and translations, still they cannot find the some of the most simple things. &gt;&gt; It makes me so embarrassed to think that we have to have a messenger come and say, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." &gt;&gt; Period. And here we got all this intellectualism and they can't find that period. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said it might have been 800 million years, might have been hundreds of millions of years before when when God was doing all this creation. They think, well, he did he did all this in 24 hours. Brother B says it wasn't in 24 hours. He said those seeds were laying beneath the water and the word of God was spoken and at some point in all of the eons of time when when God said it, it was going to come forth and those seeds had to bring forth light. And so he said, "Let there be light." And the light came and the sun drew near the earth and the seeds came forth. And not one bit different than today, the son of man, the revealing of the son of man in that ministry drew near to you because you had a seed in your life &gt;&gt; and that seed had to come forth. &gt;&gt; It had to come forth &gt;&gt; and there was no other way because that's the order. That's the channel. &gt;&gt; God's not changing his mind. said, "Well, I'll I'll use the moon or I'll use some other planet." God's using the sun to bring forth life because it's a type of the son of God &gt;&gt; drew near to you &gt;&gt; to bring forth life. &gt;&gt; If you want to listen to a service, any of you unfamiliar, you ought to listen to the last 20 minutes of choosing of a bride. &gt;&gt; He said this solemn warning. &gt;&gt; That's a solemn warning. He said, "We don't know what time and you don't know what time that this city one day." This was spoken in Los Angeles, California. You don't know what time this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean. They might have not known it before. and all the seismographs and the earthquake centers which I have spoken to here in this area. I've spoken to them because they have major earthquakes, many every month, but they said most of them are deep in the ocean and you don't hear of them. and uh and the Denver, Colorado is where they keep they have the center for the world, but because of new technology and new sensitive equipment and so on, the man told me that they're and this is some years ago that they're already three years behind reporting the earthquakes. Don't ever think for a moment we're going to have an earthquake and then I'm going to get right with God or that will be a moment that I will really you know no that just isn't going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be laying out here at the bottom of this ocean and he cries out oh capernium &gt;&gt; said Jesus thou art thou who exaltth into heaven will be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it had been standing till this day. And Sodom and Gomorrah lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea, and Capernium's in the bottom of the sea. Thou city, now he begins to prophesy against Los Angeles. thou city &gt;&gt; who claims to be the city of the angels &gt;&gt; who's exalted yourself into heaven what they call their celebrity stars said you have exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of fashions and things till even the foreign countries come here to pick up your filth our filth and send it away with your fine churches and your steeples and so forth the way you Do remember one day &gt;&gt; I want you to remember that this is the channel. &gt;&gt; The channel &gt;&gt; God will do nothing but he reveal it to his secrets of prophets. Now this prophet proven vindicated for over 30 years is giving the announcement the prophecy. Your fine church is in steeples. I want you to remember one day you'll be laying at the bottom of this sea and your great honeycomb uh under you right now. The wrath of God is belching right beneath you. How much longer he'll hold this sandbar hanging over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there plum back to the salt sea. He said it'll be worse than the last day of Pompei. Repent, Los Angeles. Repent, the rest of you and turn to God. The hour of his wrath is upon the earth. Flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ. He said, "Let us pray." And then he began to pray. Dear God, when in my spirit is shaking, I'm sure Ezekiel could have said that. I'm sure Daniel and Isaiah could have said the same thing. My spirit is shaking. My heart is dropping. teardrops of warning. Grant, oh God, that men and women will not think of what I've said as a joke and that the church people will not think of that it is something that was prejudice or against them. May they see, Lord, it is it's in love &gt;&gt; that thou beest me record, Almighty God, that up and down this coast I have went year after year proclaiming your word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bear me record, oh God. &gt;&gt; It would if it would happen tonight. I hold I've told the truth and thou knowest that this vision of the bride is the truth. &gt;&gt; So now we have a vision of the destruction of a vast city of millions of people. &gt;&gt; And he spoke of he said listen even to the words hanging over that sandbar. There was a large corporation in Vancouver called Hydro Dynamics and they made they made the uh like a Pisces investigative submarine and they deep submersible submarines and it came really into the forefront here because they had one loaded on a boat and they had another one loaded on a flat deck ready to go to the boat and the Canadian government was sending them uh to Russia had bought them and the United States put pressure on Canada and said hey we we we don't want you to send them and there was a bit of a tough uh over it and Canada said well they're made in Canada there our technology and so on and the United States said that is correct but you have used some American technology and and parts in that submarine and uh and so Canada with their good friendship with America decided to cancel the shipping shipping of these ships of these boats out there. The reason I was so keen about it, I was actually uh it looked as though I was going to have to go into their plant and appraise them because they had gone uh they were going into bankruptcy because of these things. Now, I don't know exa exactly what happened to them eventually, but I can tell you this. I got a very very keen interest in it. And then a big article because the newspaper in the city of Vancouver very keen on it. It was a large corporation and it was a big article in the Vancouver province. I've looked for it since but I I've not been able to find it but it was a large article. I remembered on the bottom of a page and they were re they were telling of the account of whether it was one of these subs or whether it was one of the American uh research submarines, but they were off the coast of California on the continental shelf and they had the they they they had a mother ship and they uh they had a research submarine that was doing research down on the ocean floor and they're just moving along very very slowly. And there I think it was a twoman sub. And while it was moving, it it it bumped into something which wasn't uncommon. So they just changed their position and continued to move on and maybe raised it up a wee bit and continue to move on and then bump it into something else. And so they decided to uh uh contact the mother ship to get a bearing of where they were. And they determined from the mother ship that they were one mile under the coast of California that there's actually water. And they said there they said in this article that it was it was like a great uh a great bench and it was being supported with huge uh huge sandstone pillars like it was pillars and and they they were there underneath California, the state of California. And the word they used it was it was like it was honeycombed. I never forgot it. &gt;&gt; It was like my I got goosebumps all over me &gt;&gt; and a prophet crying out against Los Angeles. And he said there should be laying at the bottom of this this bottom. He said, "Your great honeycomb under you right now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've held that in my heart all these years. &gt;&gt; You say, "All these years, these years are just &gt;&gt; nothing." We're talking about God of eternity. But the creator spoke through a vessel standing right in that city declaring your honeycomb is going to give way and you're going to slide into the ocean. And then we had I think of this church I'm reminding some of you that we're not here but some of you that were here and it's good to be reminded once again. Professor uh Dr. Jacobs from the University of Madras uh stood right here in this platform in our church and his specialty is the earth structure and he went right to this this part where brother Brandham said is this honeycomb is going to slide into the ocean. I was over in Madras and and and I had to wait a little bit because there were uh there was a delegation from Moscow that was there and he was to speak to them and uh because he because of his knowledge of the earth's crust and everything he was an expert on mining and and the the makeup of the earth's crust and different kind of materials and so on. And so when he stood here on the pulpit, he went to this quote. He went to this uh prophecy of brother Brandham and he said when when brother Brandham used the word it will slide into the ocean. He said I'd like to tell you of the structure of the earth's crust under Los Angeles. And he began to give the different materials that were present there. And he says and there's a whole band before it comes to the solid hard bedrock. There's a whole band. And he said the best explanation I could give it to you that you would understand. It's like graphite and it's just very smooth. He says and that is precisely when that earthquake takes place. He said it the structure of the earth in this and the design of it. He said it's literally going to slide into the ocean. &gt;&gt; Friends, we didn't need that. But it's nice to have it confirmed by a believer, &gt;&gt; who is also a scientist who knows about it, about the about the earth. And whether we live to see it, I trust not. I trust we'll be gone. I've had lots of people say, "Well, are we going to be here during that time?" Well, if you're in Christ, you have nothing to fret about anyway. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be caught up with it anyhow. But I will say to you today, and I feel incredibly moved what you've seen on the screen today, friends, that has happened in our time. It is decapitated according the United Nations, a whole nation of 9 million people, and they have no they have no infrastructure. They have no no government or anything to to run them. The nations of the world are going to have to come and help them. But I'll say this to you, those that were in Christ, I thank God there's believers amongst them, &gt;&gt; and I I pray that those believers will be sustained and will have the necessary things of life. &gt;&gt; And we want to do whatever we need to do. We're not here for offerings. We're not here to pump for that. That we're way beyond that. What we're pumping today is that God sent his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you woring with me? &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not, you know, &gt;&gt; yelling too loud, &gt;&gt; but I am I am moved. &gt;&gt; This is our message. &gt;&gt; This is our messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is our safety net. &gt;&gt; We don't need all the social things and all of these things. I thank God for them. I thank God for every doctor and and doctors without borders and the people who go down there and the smile those doctors that work under a smile and so on which we've had we've had them even here became believers. I thank God for that. But friends, you want to have a bomb shelter made out of feathers under his wings. Will we trust? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to have a provider that's called Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to have a healer in a time like this when we can say our trust is in the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. You know why I'm going to close right now. I've been a little longer than I want to be, but you ought to read birth pains. Can I just give you a few lines? &gt;&gt; Now, she knows, speaking of this earth, this one you're sitting in, this one that you're enjoying, now comes the now comes the actual breath of God through a chosen vessel's mouth. And she knows her time of deliverance is at hand. This is just before he's taken off the earth in 65. And she knows she must give way. Said even the earth knows it. &gt;&gt; The world knows that her birth pains is so great that she's got to give way. There's going to be a new birth born at hand. And I'm thankful for that. I'm tired of this one. Do you agree with him? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sound like a lot of you still are happy with it. We're tired of this one. &gt;&gt; Anyone knows that's here. It's a place of death &gt;&gt; and sorrow &gt;&gt; and all kinds of discrepancies and so forth. I'm glad that you have to give away. I'm glad that the time is at hand. &gt;&gt; Continues on. She's totally rotten. &gt;&gt; Her politics and systems is just as rotten as they can be. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've just been reading the history of the MOSSAD and uh and all the entanglement with the CIA and with the FBI and the KGB in Russia and the uh BOSS I believe from from Africa and all of the agencies of the world. And when I have read it, my wife has been reading some of it. I all I can tell you this earth at the highest level is rotten to the core. That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely rotten to the core. &gt;&gt; And they show in there in detail how hundreds and billions and billions of dollars have been passed right into the Vatican bank. And it is mafia money, tens of billions of money. And Cardinal Marinus, who was just sent back to the Vatican from from Chicago. And some years ago, he was wrapped up in the in the case where there was 34 uh a pope that only lived for 34 days. &gt;&gt; And that and and David Yallop, if you want to get the book called in God's name, David Yalop says plainly, and he gives the names of several men, he says, "I'm not saying that one of these might have killed the Pope. I am saying one of them did murder the Pope." &gt;&gt; Amen. and they haven't put him in jail because they know it's the absolute truth. And he unveils, he goes right into the banking system of the of the Vatican bank and begins to show how absolutely corrupt they were. &gt;&gt; They scheme up things that you and I don't even know of. All I can tell you is when the prophet says in a simple term, "She's rotten." &gt;&gt; Then you have to know she's rotten. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Do you have another five minutes? &gt;&gt; You know what the You know what the Vatican was engaged with at that time when he was writing that book? David Yallop. Y A L L O P. They were engaged in the Faulland war was taking place with Argentina against England because the Faulland Islands down off the coast of Argentina. But within within the Vatican, they'd set up I think they called it a G9 shadow government, world government for the whole world. And they had certain people were in place. Cardinal Marinus was one, the president of Argentina was another. And they had these key pl people who would step into place for a world government. And they needed money and they chose some wealthy men in Italy and they encouraged them said they arranged you'll buy this bank and you'll buy this bank and soon as these men about three of them got these banks then it was filtered all through the whole Catholic system said all all the nuns your orders you will bank at this bank the priest will bank at these banks all the all the parishioners and have it filtered all down. We're going to bank at these banks because we're going to make these banks big banks. That was all part of the scheme. And then those banks became very popular and they became with lots of deposit of money and they got recognition with the IMF, the International Monetary Fund. And they they could borrow money from other nations. They borrowed just under $1 billion. These banks which were in Italy borrowed just under $1 billion and they and and and they funneled it when it came into the bank they sent it right into the Vatican bank. And because the Vatican is a is a nation to itself, it's completely it has total immunity. And so when the funds came into the Vatican, all track and trace was was was lost. And when it went out of the bank of the Vatican, just listen to this. There's a little history. It went out of the va the Vatican bank and went to France and they bought exorcet missiles from France and shipped the missiles to Argentina to the president of Argentina and he blew British ships out of the water with British missiles, bought with British money because they wanted to they wanted to see that they that this member of the of the world government would maintain and actually win that war, which he did not. That's how corrupt it is. Now, they mention the same people in the Mosad and the and and this is all fact. No fiction. That's all fact, all names, all dates, almost 500 pages. And he mentions the same people. And when I read that about David Yalop, a very very respected uh uh uh reporter, and he said because of all of that that was happening, this is what happened. The pope, the pope died, and another one just came in. And the secretary, the pope secretary, which he inherited, the secretary from the last one, the secretary for the pope told him about this shadow government. And some of the people right in the Vatican and some of the cardinals are part of this. And he told the he told his secretary he's going to dismantle it. He's opposed to it and he's going to dismantle it. And now all of these people were going to be dismantled. He goes to bed. He has his medication there. And he goes to sleep. 2 hours. 2 hours before he passed away. That same night, he'd been in power 34 days. Two hours before, someone within the Vatican had already called the undertaker to come and get his body. And the man is still living. He wasn't even sick. So, he was poisoned or something. And David Yalup says he had all of these figures and the pictures of the undertakers and when they got the call and when they came two hours before he died so they could be there on time. And because of this great upheaval, this Cardinal Marsis is sent to Chicago. just now recently he's sent back to the Vatican and they said he's a prisoner in Vatican because he can't really be allowed out. He is that corrupt. And Marinus has told this reporter he said this is a gravy train. They're getting so much money, billions and billions of dollars from the mafia. And this reporter says it's money of prostitution. It's money of every kind of of of gambling. It's money from the lowest scum of the earth. &gt;&gt; And sitting there, I tell you, my brother, my sister, God had a prophet's eyes &gt;&gt; that could look beyond those fancy robes &gt;&gt; and all that nice talk. &gt;&gt; This might cost us something. Might cost me something. This is on the internet, but I'll say it's corrupt &gt;&gt; to the very core. &gt;&gt; And God's going to judge her. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture says that God will judge her. &gt;&gt; And are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; And God sent a prophet in this time to let us know that that hour has arrived. &gt;&gt; And that is why the world is sinking into such a impossible condition. Who has the answer? &gt;&gt; They're grappling with things. Who has the answer for the world's problems? There's no way. They don't have any answer. They're just kind of feeling their way through the darkness. You might say, "Why is there a great meltdown now? Why is all of these things happening? Why did the why did the uh iron curtain fall? Do you know why?" Just one man. &gt;&gt; The vessel. Are you listening? Amen. &gt;&gt; The vessel stood and said, "When the Berlin Wall comes down, then the old Roman Empire will be back in the same cycle that it was when Christ was here on earth." &gt;&gt; Who can say things like that? That's just one line. It's not a whole book. It's not a whole bunch of doctrine. just one word out of a prophet's mouth and it's already signed, sealed, and delivered. &gt;&gt; And when he said that, we didn't see it till the wall started going down. I say, "God, give us eyes. God, give us a believing heart. &gt;&gt; God, give us insight. God, give you and I revelation." That's my prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I didn't come to preach. I just come to pour out my heart. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And I'll conclude with this same messenger. He's got a restoration of the bride tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's making a declaration here. He now the vessel. I want you. He the vessel. Not the president of the United States. the the prophet of God for the whole generation, for this whole age. He's making a statement that the bride tree and he's talking directly about you and about I who've been called into this message. We are in a restoration by the authority of that word &gt;&gt; and nothing can change it. And then he goes to the future home and describes our future home, your home. &gt;&gt; And he describes what Peter says, "The heavens will be on fire." &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, sister, when this world's on fire, we'll be in the bosom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank him. I just I'm so filled with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; I want to just sing a I want to sing an old hymn that also is uh very much having to do with change. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't come here to fire you up. I came here that the fire of God and the Holy Spirit will burn down into the very bosom of your soul and make alive God's word to you. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This message is not the message you and I thought it was. &gt;&gt; It's more than that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's more than that. And we're finding that out, brother Isaac, all the time. &gt;&gt; We're finding it out, brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I mean, here's a couple here. our brother and sister Andes. I'm sure if you were to speak to them, Sister Andy has listened to these tapes, hundreds of them to get them. And Brother Andy has edited them and they've they've digested the words. I'm sure if I was to ask you, Brother Andy's, the words today spoken by that messenger have infinitely more meaning and depth to you. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. when he says even I just catch a little phrase and when he says and then when that's over this will happen &gt;&gt; you can pin your soul on that &gt;&gt; that when that's over this is going to happen &gt;&gt; and will Los Angeles sink absolutely &gt;&gt; you talk about catastrophic friends just imagine it a wee bit you've seen a little bit of picture here just imagine Los Angeles imagine the Hollywood imagine the whole the whole world is consumed with entertainment ment today and it'll be gone. &gt;&gt; Banks will be gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Financial institutions absolutely broke. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Insurance companies won't exist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jobs won't be available. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You think they had a few suicides when the 1929 economic crash came. You haven't seen anything about suicides till when everyone finds their idol is gone. &gt;&gt; My idol is gone. &gt;&gt; The man, the woman I worship, they're gone. &gt;&gt; The whole industry is gone. Television's gone. I won't be able to see it tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord is right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're on our way to a new heaven and a new earth where's righteousness. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh my loving brother, when the world's on fire, don't you? Why don't we stand to our feet? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care how this service ends up as long as every man and every woman find their soul on fire &gt;&gt; with what God has said. And we can we can confess to one another, I am a believer. I believe that word with all my soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the only word and that's the only channel that can change the conditions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my loving brother. When the world's on fire. &gt;&gt; Oh my loving brother. When the world's on fire, [Music] don't you want God's pres to be your pill? Oh in the rock of aes rock of aes cle for me.
