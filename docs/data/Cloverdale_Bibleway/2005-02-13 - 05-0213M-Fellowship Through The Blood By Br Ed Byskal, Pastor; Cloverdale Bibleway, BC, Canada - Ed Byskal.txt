Nice to see everyone here building full all those that are visiting also with us. We nice to have a brother Paul and sister Jerry Haylet here and they brought another couple with them which we were able to meet last night. Brother Tim and sister Hedah Bream. Happy to have them as well. Brother Wolfram Hornshed and his daughter. I people journey a long ways to be with us in church. We appreciate that. God bless them. And uh perhaps there's others as well. We want to welcome everyone who's streaming. There's more and more. 122 locations were streaming the other last week and we just increased the number so more could be connected with us. We want to greet them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm going to allow you just to have your seats for a few moments. Thank you for standing. Thank you for worshiping setting the atmosphere for the word which we're going to come to in just a few moments. Brother Tony is in uh Brazil. Uh they have arranged there's been some meetings that have been arranged there actually for a long time and I'm going to be joining him uh tomorrow uh just for the one week. I want you to pray. Pray for me if you would pray that I'll have strength and it's a a grueling trip to begin with and a grueling amount of meetings. They're going to have ministers meetings two and three a day uh for about three days and then evening meetings uh over the weekend and then back just Monday. So it's just go Monday, come back Monday. It's just like a U-turn. It's a very very long very very long journey. And uh but these meetings have actually been uh arranged for a long time. And uh God has uh God has really been gracious to South America. Although we have not had a lot of contact with uh with the believers there on a large scale, but there's been a real move of God in all of the South American countries. The last time we were there, there was probably at least 2,000 people in evening meetings and they didn't come from a long long ways. That was mostly local to the city of Chimpika. And now we're going to be in the northern part of Brazil called Bella Horizonti. Uh and uh the pastor there, he just a wonderful brother. We couldn't communicate because of our language problem. But you know the way God does things and I just want to drop it to the congregation so you know kind of what's happening. The first first invitation which we had it wasn't merely an invitation. They just pressed and pressed and pressed. We just like you to come down and we so we didn't know what it was all about but we felt a confirmation to go and of all of these years have never been uh into Brazil. And the pastor there at uh Brazil speaks Portuguese and the pastor who was hosting the meeting he had such a burden for missions. So he has traveled to Africa to Mosmb beek many times and through his uh labors there there have been many many when I say many I'm talking there was about 200 churches he asked the believers in Malawi to care for that he had had he'd been instrumental in having those and many many more started he actually mentioned about 500 groups that have been assembling in Mosmb beek and Mosmb beek is Portuguese. So he they were just so burdened because he said you know we go over and the holy spirit calls the people but when we leave we have nothing to leave them. we don't have sufficient books in Portuguese. And uh so I I attempted then at in the ministers meetings to assemble their resources together and they had a couple families that were devoted to translation work and one was around Rio Sa Paulo area I believe and the other was more to the north of Brazil. So we we tried to introduce to them look what you need to do is you know uh get your efforts together and then you'll be able to you do the translations and I'll speak to brother doa in Congo cuz that's the thing you need to do you know don't want to print it over here or in Brazil get uh have it done in in Congo and and it's already in Africa and they can just ship it down to Mosmb beek well it all sounded good. Uh but uh for the last couple of years almost it's been kind of grinding your wheels in the sand and and uh uh you know people get a little ministry whether it be translating work and printing a few message books or whatever it might be they get a little ministry and then it was the same thing in the Ukraine and then they begin to feel well if they get any direction from outside you know somehow they're going to lose their work they're going to lose their identity it's going to get swapped swallowed up in something bigger. Well, my that's what we're here for. Let let it get swallowed up and let it get spread and let it get, you know, voiced abroad. &gt;&gt; So, uh, we we said, "Well, we'll do what we can." And I went to Congo and I spoke with Brother Dioa and he was all geared up and ready to do, you know, what they could do. And we we said, "Well, we will assist with those books, Lord willing, if we're able. will exist financially to have those books printed uh in the Congo and well it never really came about you know some message books uh uh some translations were it was so slow and it's hard to coordinate things and just like kind of grinding your wheels in the sand and brother brother Tony you know he kind of came to the end we couldn't do much more then we get these phone calls now and they said we're now ready. We're ready. We're ready to cooperate. We're ready to work together over here. We're ready, but we don't know exactly how to do it. Come and help us set this thing up and come and teach us and come and tell us what you've learned over these years and how this should function and what a blessing it can be. And we're just kind of we'll be at your disposal. So, we said, well, on those grounds, we'd come down. So, that's what we're on our way to do. And at the same time, of course, you know, the way it always is, they they don't want just that. Let's have some meetings, too. So, we'll have some meetings, Lord willing. God pouring out his grace upon us. So, that's what we're looking forward to. While we're gathered here to worship him, &gt;&gt; you've been worshiping. And uh I thought before we read the scripture, we could just stand and sing peace like a river, love like a fountain. And we want his presence. And I am desiring, you know, without him, we can do nothing today. And I'm sure you recognize that we need him desperately. We need him perhaps more than we realize. So let's unite our hearts. Would you do that? Would you say, "Brother Ed, I'll unite my heart with yours &gt;&gt; and pray that God will come amongst us, meet us in a special way." Amen. Peace like a river like a mountain. With God your spirit is glowing everywhere like a mountain stream. [Music] Holy Spirit, let your power [Music] fall once again. Peace like a river. Peace like the mountain. The king of your spit is glory [Music] like the mountain. [Music] Oh come Holy Spirit. Let your fire [Music] holy spirit come Holy Spirit. Let your power everyone once more now. Holy Spirit, let your fire. [Music] May he grant it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're coming now to open the scriptures. We can turn its pages as your prophet said, but we cannot reveal it. You must reveal it by the Holy Spirit. Let there be a spirit of revelation upon every person that's listening in, oh God. Every person within the walls of this building, we pray, oh Lord, you'll be lifted up, glorified. May your majesty, oh God, be seen and visible. Heal the sick and afflicted. I pray deliver them. We want to glorify you for what we've heard in the good reports, Lord, for the complete healing of our brother Bessie. God, how we rejoice. We have prayed publicly and have prayed in our private chambers, but now you have done this work. And others that are so needy, Lord, the prayers have been made and we know that you heard us. And now, oh Lord, I pray that you'll give grant us, Lord, the Holy Spirit's ability as I stand at the post of duty. May we speak the words that you would have said and be silent, oh God, on those things you would not have said. Let the hearts of the people be open. May the seed fall into good ground in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We're going to turn in our Bibles to Psalms the 86th chapter. And then when you're seated, you can keep your Bibles open if you would like. I have a number of scriptures that I will be referring to. But we're going to read together, and I'll have you read with me in unison verses 11 and 12 of Psalms 86. Teach me thy way, O Lord. I will walk in thy truth. Unite my heart to fear thy name. I will praise thee, oh Lord my God, with all my heart and I will glorify thy name forever more. And everyone said, "Amen." Thus shall it be. God bless you. You may be seated. Brother Brandham took these two verses in the message the uniting time and sign and I want to uh speak a rather difficult subject for me. It may seem very very simple and elementary to you. But if God will allow you to reach out more or less where my thoughts and mind has been and if he will give me the ability to draw you in to what the Holy Spirit has been speaking to me about. Sometimes a preacher wrestles over not over a subject but wrestles over how to deliver it and how to make it real like it's been real to my own heart. And so I want to try to convey to you uh this uniting as David had said, "Unite my heart to fear thy name. I will be speaking also very much upon the blood because the blood is a unifying force. It's a not only a lifegiving force but it's a uniting force. And uh I want to just go back for a moment in your imagination and in your spiritual thoughts and see God try to comprehend him just for a moment. Although we cannot we can't even begin to comprehend them. But I would like you just to somewhere in the eternities. We're creatures of time so we think of things in terms of time. But somewhere in the eternities before there was anything of creation. Here's this being that fills all time and space filled with attributes. a creator that has not yet created uh by himself. He's alone, not even God yet because there's nothing worshiping him. Perhaps not even a creation of a universe as as yet. And brother Brandom said he sat alone with his thoughts. Uh a a god with a mind and filled with thoughts and filled with power, filled with attributes. And brother Brandham said he loved fatherhood. Somewhere amongst all of those attributes, he loved fatherhood. And how he did by his word, we do not know. Only we do know that all things were made by him. And this power, this logos that came out from God, a creative power, a creative force, and he begins to create, he says, uh, uh, like a clinker maybe spun off of the sun and a burning molten clinker and it fell perhaps for a 100 million years in space. I thought I would try to bring something to you uh so I could relate and make something relative as far as the space and universe is concerned but I found it too cumbersome. I found it too enormous. I got to the place where if you took one step it was 3 million uh 600,000 years uh of light space and uh I I I just got lost in it. So, I I thought we could get get, you know, I've read where they've had, you know, the planetary systems and everything uh down where you if you put a like a a P here, you'd have to go so far and then and then we're just talking about our own galaxy and and we start talking about the universe, you just get lost. You talk about a planet, this this planet will be a pin head over here. Then he left to walk 26 yards with three million uh three million light years at every step. And then and we didn't have enough space in this building. Even if we made everything so minute, this earth would only be a particle of dust. And that would just be our universe. Not our universe, but our galaxy. And you just couldn't even begin to begin to speak about it. I'm talking about God that filled all of that and a lot more. this being that we we speak about we call him our God, our father which art in heaven. Is he ever in heaven? &gt;&gt; And saw this clinker fall maybe a 100 million years who knows how fell and then by his words stopped. We can't even imagine that. We don't even know how it happened. Stopped it and it be to simmer down. And there were certain elements that were there potsh and various elements. He said what was he doing? Here was a prophet saying what was he doing? He's making you &gt;&gt; in that great mind. He was thinking about a family. &gt;&gt; That attribute of fatherhood was rising and coming to the surface. I want to have children. And that is why at the end of this book as it ends, it says, "And I will be his God, and he will be my son." &gt;&gt; That's what was in him. &gt;&gt; He'll be a He's going to have a son. And for those of you that have had children, one thing is sure, the blood of the father is in the child. &gt;&gt; They have been unified. they've been brought into. We have what we call bloodlines and uh uh we we have various terminology that refers to the the unifying force and power of the blood. I thought of God and Job thought of him and God had a conversation with Job and I I suppose this really began to expand Job's mind. He said, "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof?" God began to ask him questions that would in our terminology really uh challenge his mind. When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy, "Where were you, Job? Where were you? Where was I? My goodness, we can't even imagine where we were. But we were somewhere in the mind and thoughts of Almighty God. If God is God, if there ever was a being like God. And the prophet said he knew every knat, every flea, every time it would bat its eyes and how much tallow it would make if it were if it were rendered down. He knew every last. He knew every time you're going to blink on earth. &gt;&gt; He knew everything about you. He knows us, my brother, my sister. And if he didn't, then he wouldn't be a God worth serving. I thank him that he's that kind of a God. And he knows every last detail of our lives. He He knows and he's put us here for a purpose. He's asking Job, "Who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth? And when it issued out of the womb, when I made the cloud, the garment thereof, and the thick darkness, uh, a swaddling bag for it, a swaddling band, rather, hast thou commanded the morning since thy days, and caused the daypring to know its place? Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Uh, hast thou walked the in the search of the death? Hast thou perceived the breath of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it. I tell you that no wonder Job said, I'll put my hand over my mouth. I won't say anything. &gt;&gt; Who's going to say anything when you start hearing things like this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hast thou commanded the morning? He asked. And then he went on thou bind the secret influences of Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion cast thou bring forth Mazeroth in his season all these uh uh planetary systems. What do you know about these things? Thou guide Arcturus with his sons knowest thou the ordinances of heavens? Cast thou set dominion thereof? I'm sure that Job's mind was trying to grasp this God. And yet the prophet said, Job, he wanted to come up to his house. He wanted to find, is there someone who can give me some hope beyond this life? &gt;&gt; I'd like to Is there a Is there a God? I'd like to go up to his door. I want to knock. He said he wanted a God with skin on. There's &gt;&gt; something within us &gt;&gt; that cries out for a God that can understand this dimension that we're in and what we go through and what we experience. And that's why so many people who don't even know God say, "Why am I here? What is this all about? They need God. We need God. You need God. I need God. I need this kind of a God." We don't only need some being that fills all time and space. But what makes God great is he could reduce himself down down and become a blood cell &gt;&gt; in the womb of a woman, a virgin. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is something that just is beyond the mind to comprehend. The Jewish people, they can't comprehend that. They know that there's a God and he spoke to a prophet and he spoke to Moses and and brought the word and so and so. Can't imagine a god that could become a blood cell. But that was the unifying force. He had to unify because it was blood that broke us from him. &gt;&gt; The scripture says through Isaiah, jumping around a wee bit back and forth. Thus say the Lord spoke Isaiah. The heaven is my throne and the earth is my foottool. But where's the house that you'll build me? And where's the place of my rest? Where's the house? How will my household be structured? How is this going to happen? The whole heavens are my throne and the earth is my foottool. This whole earth just a foottool for God. Where's my household is what he's asking. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I said moment ago and he is closing the book, closing the scriptures. I'm alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. Speaking of the faithful, he that overcomemeth shall inherit all things. He that overcomemeth shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. That's the cry of the heart of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Not just sunship as some relationship as we know in the human in our human realm, but sunship in an inseparable union that's brought about by a lif stream. And God conceived in his mind that he would form and make someone in his image. This is going to be different. It's going to give him life. God can't learn anything. He knew it from beginning from the end. There's going to be a a seed, a sperm that is going to come into a bedding ground of a womb. And life is going to be conceived. And it'll be birthed through a process of birth. And it'll have a circulatory system. It'll have blood and in the blood will be alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Don't worry friends, Satan knew something about this because Jesus said he was a murderer from the beginning. He was a sheddder of blood from the beginning. Now follow me real close. Before before Cain slew Abel, before he slew Abel, before it was blood that was on the ground for God, you know the first the first time the word blood appears in the scripture, it is spoken by God himself. He says to a, it says to Cain, "Where's your brother? His blood crith unto me from the ground. Where is it?" And it was this sin, a blood sin that caused the separation. &gt;&gt; Blood was involved in the separation. But before it was blood that was spilled to the ground, it was a word. Before it was blood, it was a word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word was you shall not surely die &gt;&gt; before it became uh that that crime it was a word. It started with a word and then it evolved and became an act. It was a first a word then it was an act and then and the separation took place. David says in our scripture, "Unite my heart." And the heart according to the Hebrew can be the inner man, the mind, the soul, the understanding. Unite my soul. Unite my understanding. goes on. Unite the seed of my emotions. Unite my emotions &gt;&gt; to fear thy name. Oh, I tell you what, this is a very emotional age that we're in. People are geared and live by their emotions. And I can tell you what, a lot of those emotions aren't they're not uh they don't fear God. &gt;&gt; Says, "Unite my heart to fear thy name. Unite my unite the very seed of my emotions passions. Unite my passions to fear thy name. The center of all physical and spiritual life. The fountain and seed of my thoughts. Uh even here this morning. Everyone, we all have our own individual little thinking process or mindset. But I would like this congregation this morning to say within yourself, "Oh God, unite my thoughts, &gt;&gt; to fear your name." &gt;&gt; So often our thoughts bring all kinds of other fears. We fear life. We fear the future. We fear about our health. We fear about retirement. We have concerns. We're made anxious about this, about the pressures of life, our finances, and and whatever more. We have all kinds of concerns, but we should say this morning, this congregation should say, "Cause me to fear. Let my thoughts fear your name. &gt;&gt; Take your name into reverence. &gt;&gt; Let my thoughts, let my emotions, let the very seed of my passions, let them all be consumed to fear your name and reverence your name." I can tell you my brother, my sister, to a man or a woman that does that, everything else will fall into place. &gt;&gt; That is serving God first, putting him first. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That is the whole being. Cause me, unite my heart to fear your name. Now how how does this happen in reality? Blood as I said earlier is a unifying force. Blood is signifies the ultimate union. Blood in the old testament is considered to be the life principle. There's been much mystery attached to it. Uh as I studied this subject and in the scripture you'll find there there's there was an awe and there was a reverence attached almost a mysterious aspect attached to the shedding of blood. And don't forget, I said God was the first one to mention that now. And and man, you could go to the most illiterate peoples and you'll find that somehow they'll have some blood rights, some kind of ceremony that they'll keep with blood. years ago, some years ago, and we were in Nepal and were up in an area found a place where they were worshiping, where the people worship, no knowledge, as I know of the God that you and I serve. But we were going to go through a little doorway in a wall. I said, I saw it was a dark red color over the door. I said, "What is this?" They said, "It's blood. They kill a goat and they smear blood over this doorway. Almost identical to the Passover. You put blood. They didn't know why, but they just something in them. In some of the tribes in Africa, they will scarify their skin as you know, but the reason they do that is to draw blood. And then they have like this inner transfusion of blood. They want to bind themselves together and know that they are in a in inseparable brotherhood and uh uh they then they will take each other's blood and and smear it upon one another. So they have some uh inner transfusion of of this blood rights and they feel it that now now this union is made complete but it can't be made complete without that act. They have that uh and and they have many many others. Uh the mutual shedding of blood and uh uh it is brought it into and considered to be a brotherhood or a blood friendship or blood fellowship. Now uh when God when God spoke to the serpent, imagine now he spoke to the serpent, not a snake but to this being and uh he he he said that that the seed of the woman. Now in the seed of the woman, you're going to just do a little swimming in a moment. In the seed of the woman, the blood of the child comes from the man. It's in the It's in a hemoglobin. It's in that seed. They can tell the child. They can test it to see who the father is. And God had ordained it to be that way. And he said that the seed of the woman will bruise your head. God created that seed for the first time. When Jesus Christ was conceived, for the first time, God intercepted humanity &gt;&gt; with another blood cell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This was a different one, folks. &gt;&gt; There's a different life coming forth. And that one was going to bruise his head. &gt;&gt; He brought the separation through a blood sin. That's good. &gt;&gt; And Christ is going to bring the unifying force once again by the newly created blood of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's speaking to speaking to Cain said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground." What did God hear? I don't know. What sound was it? I don't know. But this is what God said. Do you believe God? &gt;&gt; You believe he said the truth. &gt;&gt; He said, "The blood, your brother's blood crith to me from the ground." That wasn't the first time. I mean, that may have been the first time, but that wasn't the last time that God was going to hear that. We spoke about the terrible things that have happened to the Jewish people all down. Uh there's one thing that that uh one thing that is is common in their history from age to age to age is the blood of those people have cried from the ground of the earth and God has heard it in the future home. Prophet just says the sperm from the male carries a hemoglobin which is the blood and in the blood is the life and in that life is a nature the soul and Satan the serpent got to Eve before Adam got to her. That's right. So he beguiled her. So, Satan, the serpent, was the husband to Eve before Adam ever knew. And that follows all through the scripture. All through the scripture, the Satan got to Israel before God, before Jesus was even there. There were religious orders there, all kinds of beliefs and doctrines and traditions when Jesus came on the scene. And Jesus was the seed of God. Now the that act united us with a fallen race. You don't have to teach your children to do wrong. &gt;&gt; You can take you can take your child. You can take any child. You can isolate them. They never hear a bad word. Never see a wrong act. Never involved. don't have any peer pressure. You can take them, but deep down somewhere within the inner being of that child, there'll be a fallen nature. &gt;&gt; And there's a a belief today, a strong belief that we're essentially born good and we're become bad by outside influences. &gt;&gt; Well, that just doesn't happen to be the case. &gt;&gt; It just is not the case. You can have them and protect them and do all that you want, but there is a fallen nature there and it will surely manifest itself at some point in time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; We know that is the case. And so we were actually united with that fallen nature. And brother Brandham calls it your first husband. What is a husband? What is a husband and wife? A relationship, an intimacy. And we were united through your sexual birth, your natural birth. You were reunited with a fallen nature. Right. And that is that is so uh I mean we wrestle with it but that is so much a fact of life that we were born with that nature and and and even after a person has been born again. Satan doesn't give up &gt;&gt; on trying to plague you &gt;&gt; with that old characteristics of the fallen nature. And we have weaknesses and we hardly know where the line is. Is that is that the devil or is that just me or what is that? &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You all know what I'm talking about. That that hangover thing and that and and and Satan will do everything that he can to plague the son and daughter of God &gt;&gt; with that uh uh from the throwback I'll say of the fallen nature. Jesus did not come and God did not create this blood cell that flowed in the veins of Jesus Christ to make us 50% or 75% or 99% free from the old nature. He came to divorce us from that nature. And through the body of Christ, that old husband is dead. &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul says in Romans. And we are made alive to be to be united to be married to another. &gt;&gt; Not only to be married to another. Now listen close. Not only to be married to another, but to bring forth fruit unto him. &gt;&gt; And that does not come by a casual acquaintance. &gt;&gt; That comes by an intimate act. It's a spiritual thing, but it is deeper than even the natural. &gt;&gt; The spiritual thing I'm speaking about is not coming to church. That intimacy is not necessarily coming into the house of God. That's not the necessarily the intimacy. The intimacy I'm speaking about is not someone just having being sorry for their sin and shedding some tears. That's not just it. But it's when God acknowledges your faith and the election of almighty God and you know that you've been called by him and the Holy Spirit is calling you and drawing you and finally you break your will your self-will and stubbornness breaks down and you say yes Lord I repent oh God I recognize that is you that is doing it and God sends his spirit into you and there's a there's a a an act that takes place. &gt;&gt; God himself, he comes and unites with you and that that is a birth that takes place. It's by water, it's by blood and it's by spirit. &gt;&gt; For the life is in the blood and that life of God comes into the individual. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's a irrevocable act of almighty God. He will not take that back. He said, "I will be his God, and he'll be my son. &gt;&gt; She'll be my daughter, &gt;&gt; and I'm not sorry for it." And I didn't think about it just yesterday. That was way back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someplace in the eternities, God conceived. He'll have a daughter just like you, a son just like you. &gt;&gt; And I have an attribute in this great being. I have an attribute. And they're going to carry that attribute. They're going to carry it uniquely. And I'll make them so different &gt;&gt; there won't ever even they won't I won't even repeat their fingerprints on again &gt;&gt; no one else will ever carry that that imprint of their fingerprint. No one else will even look like them. There'll be other that resemble them but no one will look like them. They'll be so unique they'll have a different number of hairs in their head and I'll know every one of them. They'll be so unique. They'll just be different in every way. And God himself saw that even through the natural birth, this one bred to that one to that one, to that one, to that one to bring forth a certain creature, a certain being. And then God himself knew in his election that I he will he will uh uh cross the footsteps of this individual somehow some place through some vessel through some preacher through some through some message book or some Bible or whatever more. He's going to cross their footstep. He's going to touch their heart and they're going to surrender. He's going to have this Holy Spirit on their trail until they do surrender. Then I'm going to unite with them. &gt;&gt; Going to unite with them in an intimacy that goes far beyond any human natural relationship or marriage. Every one of us here that are a child of we are a child of someone else. You can never change that. You can make disgrace the family name. They can disown you. Your father can stroke you out of his will. You can you can uh yourself flee to the farthest corner of the earth, but you can never change never change the fact that you are that man or woman's child &gt;&gt; and you came by a certain seed into a certain womb and were birthed. &gt;&gt; You can never change that. And when you think of that humanly speaking that God has made that such an irrevocable act, it can never be changed. &gt;&gt; You think God's going to have to change his mind about his children &gt;&gt; when they've been birthed to him by his own spirit? &gt;&gt; I can tell you what, friends, that's what the blood and all of all the mysteries concerning blood and the shedding of blood at Calvary, that's what it was all about. But I want to quickly say to you, think of it now. Before it was blood, it was word. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Before it was blood. In other words, let me just put it to you this way. Think of think of blood because blood is a unifying force. Think of it as being in different forms. At one time when the children of Israel or the Hebrews were enslaved in Egypt and God had already promised to Abraham, I'm going to deliver your seed out of of this nation that will keep them in bondage. I'm going to deliver them. He comes to Moses, his prophet, the word of God. Let every man take a lamb to his household. That's the word. And slay the lamb. And do this with the blood and do that with the flesh. That was word. Before it happened, it was first word. &gt;&gt; And when God said it, it was more certain then than even when it became a physical act. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It was first word, then it became an act. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was making it known to the disciples that the son of man shall suffer, the son of man shall be slain, will be killed. And they didn't want to hear that. Peter, he didn't want to hear that. And finally they're in the garden and Jesus is going through the agony of Gethsemane and soon the soldiers come with spo swords and spears and Peter takes his sword to slay Malcus strikes off his ear. Jesus says put up your sword. He tells him that this must be or else how will the scriptures be fulfilled? Amen. &gt;&gt; He hadn't shed his blood, but it was still, it was word first. &gt;&gt; The word &gt;&gt; was a unifying force before it even became physical blood. We talk about the blood of Jesus Christ. How thankful we are. It was shed. But before it was shed, it was promised to be shed. &gt;&gt; Before it was blood, it was word. Like when brother Lance preached years ago and it was striking in the in the log church yet and he said if we had here a vial a vial of the literal blood of Jesus Christ there would be no spiritual value to it whatsoever. &gt;&gt; The spiritual the blood the physical blood that was shed was only evidence that it had been written. It was prophesied. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He shall be led as a lamb to the slaughter and as a shear as a as a sheep before shears are dumb. So he opened not his mouth. He's he's wounded &gt;&gt; for our iniquities and by his stripes were healed. &gt;&gt; He's marred more than that any man. And it depicts his in incredible suffering and death. All of that was prophesied hundreds of years before he went to Calvary. So I say today before there was a Calvary it was word. &gt;&gt; I need to establish that very very much because now the act has been the act is in the past. First it was the word that was in the past and then and then it came into a physical reality. Now for us the physical reality is 2,000 years ago. But it's word once again. And it's a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; There's power within the very words of God. &gt;&gt; Power to unify and bring a man or a woman into an absolute inseparable contact and relationship with Almighty God. more so than you are a daughter or a son of your parents. More so than that. &gt;&gt; And I say to you today, that's absolutely an irrevocable. You cannot change that. You cannot change that. But more certain than that is that a word that God has given for this generation packs the very life blood of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you hear thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; I can tell you within that's that does not not just speaks volumes, but hear me today. When you hear a word, thus saith the Lord and you hear a prophetic voice in this generation, a message for this hour, I will tell you on the authority of God's word, that word is a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; That word has the blood cell of almighty God in it. That word has the power to bring you into sunship. [Music] &gt;&gt; And there is no other seed that can do that. &gt;&gt; That is why that's precisely why Satan in all of his cunning and deception would like to introduce his view as he did in Eden, &gt;&gt; his doctrine, his tradition. get people all taken up with their ly and all of their titles and all of these other things because he gets them consumed with that and it's a lifeless thing. &gt;&gt; There's no life in it. It's a ceremony. &gt;&gt; It's a tradition. &gt;&gt; No life in it. There's no blood in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But soon as the word of God comes, &gt;&gt; I can tell you right away, they come against that word as they've always come against that word. A man heard my service last Sunday as I spoke on your house is left to you desolate. He said, "I don't know if you are aware, but there was a public prophecy that was cried out in a meeting just as brother Brandham was finished speaking, I believe, just finished speaking and he said, "You may be interested. This is the prophecy verbatim, word for word back in the 1950s. Before serpent seed was preached, before Godhead was explained, before all of that, here was the prophecy. Yay saith the Lord to this my people that my servant whom I have sent even unto thee even unto this generation he must speak boldly even as Paul to convince these that I have sent him to yay for I have sent him my servant Branham I have put my words in his mouth even as I have sent my son to die and my people rejected him. Even so have I sent my son Brham, even in this thy day. Unto thee he hath come. Yay, they have assembled together. They have met in their secret chambers. The leaders of my people have counseledled together. They have passed judgment even upon him. They have said in their secret chambers, "We shall reject him. We shall seek a fault with him. We shall find many faults with him, and we shall teach our people. We shall tell them that this also is Belub. Yay, it is not the Spirit of the Lord that has sent him. So I will judge them even by my servant Bratam, whom I have sent unto thee. For I will put my spirit in my servants. And if thou shalt if thou doest not yield do not yield to my spirit, thou shalt be broken. For if for if it shall fall upon thee, the word of the Lord shall fall upon thee, thou shalt be crushed, and thy house left unto thee dazzle. This is the rock. Yay, if thou shalt fall upon it, thou shalt be broken. But if it doth fall upon thee, it will grind thee to powder. And thus sayeth the Lord, even unto those who have assembled together, thus sayeth the Lord, unto those that have called themselves by those who have been filled with my spirit. For yay, for ye have been my people. I have blessed thee. I have anointed thee, but thou hast gathered together and hast rejected the servant of the Lord God that I have sent unto thee. and even by sending him will I judge thee, and thy house shall be desolate even to this day, and in this hour. For thou shalt call for revival, but the ear of the Lord shall not hearken unto thee. For when I did call unto thee, thou did not know me. Thou would be a strange people unto me when I would speak unto thee. Yay, thou hast become even as my people. When I stood and cast out devils, and healed the sick, and broke bread, and multiplied it in thine eyes, thou said, he is a devil. But unto him that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. For I will speak unto thee, I will send my servants unto thee, and they shall bless thee, and thou shalt be gathered unto me. Thou shalt be blessed mightily as thou hast never been. Cast from thee the thinking of men and the ways of man and turn unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Incredible. That didn't come from a message believer. That didn't come out of one of our churches. There was none that came way up in the balcony and a person who was in the meeting said there was no microphone but my recorder picked up every word. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, I say going the extra mile. &gt;&gt; Going to the extremities to bring forth children to himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I can tell you I know the church as far I'm certain of the church where this prophecy was spoken. But I can tell you one thing. I can tell you one thing. The words are absolutely true. You talk about crying for revival. How they've cried for revival. And what a toboggan route. What a toboggan ride. where the church has gone from the time of this message that was spoken till today. You couldn't even recognize the two groups. &gt;&gt; It was certainly from the Lord up in Grand Prairie and and Brea were in those meetings. I was just uh reading some words there because we were there knew a lot of the people and I think the first person that comes to him he asks do you believe that God is here and do you believe that I am his prophet we didn't even recognize it at the time what is it what is it we say what is a word from a prophet I say before before Moses slayed the first lamb It was already slain when he spoke the word. &gt;&gt; When he said it, "Thou shalt take a lamb for a household. Thou shalt slay it." The blood was essentially dispensed with. &gt;&gt; Do you think I'm off base? It was already done. &gt;&gt; It was already done by word. &gt;&gt; And then it became an act. &gt;&gt; Before there was a Passover, before there was a Calvary, It &gt;&gt; was already &gt;&gt; established &gt;&gt; here. &gt;&gt; And oh, I know we agree with that. But now I tell you, we're hundreds and hundreds of years beyond, centuries beyond and a people in a generation that has gone far. A Leodyian generation that's out there. How thankful I am for a bright age. How thankful I am that the spirit of God has called a people out of this death out here. Say, I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and naked and blind and deceived. &gt;&gt; That's the generation. &gt;&gt; How we ought to rejoice today that in this day came a true word. &gt;&gt; A word that's not just some do this, do that. wear your clothes this way, your hair that way, or do something else. You can't do this and you can't you can't do that, but you can do this. If that's all it is, forget it. &gt;&gt; This isn't a bunch of commandments. &gt;&gt; This is a life &gt;&gt; that come from a blood cell &gt;&gt; into a living being down into the soul and transforms us into new creatures in Christ Jesus. And you're no longer your old self. You're a new creature and you might be here today and need that. Some of our young people might need that. Don't stop at anything short. That's what it is. &gt;&gt; And that's where the blood is &gt;&gt; and it's the blood that unites. You can say, "I'm a son, a daughter with God of God by his blood." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; His word, the very word that he speaks, I won't say is more potent, but it's just as real to a believer as the substance. That's why faith is the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; It's such a reality in in amongst children. And all of you that are parents, you know what I'm going to refer to now. When you have a child, you don't have to even put the thing in their hand. You just have to tell them that daddy's going to do this. We're going to get in the car and soon as you're done with this little bit of work, we're going to get in the car and we're going to go down and I'm you're going to have a milkshake. Going to buy you an ice cream. We're going to do something special. Oh, they get happy right away. It's just as well. They they can see that ice cream in their hand. It's just a reality. What was it? All they have is daddy's voice. &gt;&gt; Daddy's words. &gt;&gt; But his words are as good as the ice cream. &gt;&gt; And I don't have to wait to have the ice cream to be happy. I can be happy now cuz father's not going to lie. I go to prepare a place for you &gt;&gt; and where I am there you may be also &gt;&gt; that brings immediate joy. You say he won't tell me a lie. &gt;&gt; I will be your God and you shall be my son. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; How am I your son? Because you have received into your being the word. Not only the word but the bleeding word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You pack. That's why the prophet could say you pack the token. &gt;&gt; You have the sacrifice &gt;&gt; in you. You're carrying the token with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have it now. &gt;&gt; You have the word. You received the word. &gt;&gt; It's a bleeding word. And the prophet said it could not happen until this generation. &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen like that. He talked about the uniting time, &gt;&gt; the uniting of the nations, the uniting of the churches that everything's uniting together. And he made this interesting statement said I want to call the text. He wants to preach on it the uniting time and sign. Then he says the uniting time sign. So that sounds kind of complicated. Uniting. See time. Uniting time. That's what it is. Now this time that we're in is a uniting time. Then he said, "And the sign of that &gt;&gt; uniting time." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, to make that just a little bit more clear, &gt;&gt; I just refer you back to the three wise men. These were spiritual men. Brother Brandham says clearly, he said those those three stars that had to cross their paths. He said it was their birth path in the heavens and those three stars came and became one light. They saw the star. They followed it for a long time. said the observatories or those in those in those days they certainly studied the stars and everyone missed it. &gt;&gt; It didn't mean it was a sign to them. &gt;&gt; They were elected to see it &gt;&gt; but no one else saw it. &gt;&gt; The observatories didn't see it. The stargazers didn't see it. The astronomers of the day, it was a great day of science. &gt;&gt; They didn't see it. It didn't mean anything to them, but they even knew what to ask for. Oh, I hope you see they they saw the sign. It was elected for them to see it. Listen to me, my precious friends. &gt;&gt; This is my last service. I would want you to understand and see this. These signs that take place now, they don't even mean anything to a lot of people or to a lot of people. Well, they're just a piece of journalism. Oh, there's this. I have it here. There's this in the newspaper. This newspaper right here, which I just got this week, makes a statement that I made last Sunday. I made my statement by the message. They make their statement by an event. Before it became an event, it was already established. &gt;&gt; Three wise men. So they see the star and they follow and they journey. What are they being already? These three stars have combined united and they united. These wise men to the sign. They began to follow the sign. They believed in the sign. They believed in the sign. I said &gt;&gt; they believed in this heavenly sign. &gt;&gt; They believed in it even when no one else believed in it. And when they came, they knew what they were looking for. Where is he that is born king of the Jews? &gt;&gt; How did that light tell them there was somebody born king of the Jews? They were elected by the God who caused those stars to come into line up into uniting. They came into a unity and they bound these men on earth to it and carried they followed the star. They followed the sign and came and that led them &gt;&gt; to the Messiah. &gt;&gt; They were united &gt;&gt; with the Messiah. They fell. They worshiped him &gt;&gt; and they're recorded in the scripture. Right. &gt;&gt; They saw the sign didn't mean anything to a lot of other people. And today there's so many signs you and I can scarcely keep up with it. &gt;&gt; You know, this is the first time we've seen we've watched a lot of signs regarding Israel. And the prophet said, "If you want to see where you're at, see where the Jews are. &gt;&gt; See what they're doing. &gt;&gt; See what's happening." Our prophet declared that Rome, which been an archeneemy of Israel for years, will make a covenant with them, &gt;&gt; make an alliance with them. And how I just rehearse to you how golden my ear first woman prime minister and the first prime minister of Israel to every journey to the Vatican and commence and open the door. A crack of the door appeared and they began to set up visitations back and forth and and receiving of dignitaries and finally diplomatic even ambassadorial relationship doors were opened. I have a a second uh article here where uh the Pope John Paul II is meeting and the first time in history is meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian tourism ministers, ministers of tourism, receiving them to the Vatican because you know, oh my I hope you people believers of the message take a hold of the keys and just open up those keys. &gt;&gt; Satan is in control of the economics. &gt;&gt; Satan is in control of the politics. &gt;&gt; Satan's in control of this whole thing. And he now now uh it it looks so innocent. It looks so &gt;&gt; uh she looks so reasonable. &gt;&gt; Here's Israel hurting right now. Hurting because her big industry is tourism. That's her big industry and she's hurting terribly. The Palestinian people desiring to set up their state and it looks like it's moving in that direction. And they have a an old warrior who has forgot his uh &gt;&gt; his convictions &gt;&gt; and forgot what he fought for &gt;&gt; and certainly has forgot his Torah. He's forgotten it because of the pressure &gt;&gt; of economics and the pressure of keeping the state going and paying the bills &gt;&gt; and their their economy is down because of tourism is down. But now the most powerful man on earth of mortal man is prepared to throw his weight and to say to the Christian world, you must increase the tourism to Israel. And both of them, both the Palestinian and the Israeli, need it desperately. And they're they're increasing to bind themselves together under that headship and under that leadership. And I have a it goes on here which I won't bother going into it now. But the ambassador of the Vatican, the ambassador to Israel, they have their ambassadors have been set up. Listen friends, that happened maybe not while you younger ones have been alive, but it happened when most of us were alive, right? &gt;&gt; When most of us lived. We have gone from we have gone from zero association to not just an introduction, but now to a union &gt;&gt; and a closer and closer and closer tie &gt;&gt; with what a prophet said will be a covenant. That's right. &gt;&gt; And as I said in the last meeting and the Vatican is putting pressure on the United States, the most powerful nation &gt;&gt; to put pressure on Israel to conclude with this agreement with us. We have in two letters, one which I told you I have I have a copy of and I've read and all of the all of the things that uh the Vatican is requiring concerning the properties and taxation, etc., etc. says put put pressure and here prophets already said it. &gt;&gt; He said that they will they will that that that that this beast that came out of the earth said which is America she will say what the beast says. &gt;&gt; Repeat the same thing. And here he's telling her now what to say and you go and say it. And they're doing it. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, to a lot of folks, it's a news article. &gt;&gt; To a lot of folks, it's a newspaper. Now, Israel through her incredible suffering was actually united to in uniting time. While a prophet of God was preaching, Israel was being united with her land. &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's uniting time." But he also told us that there'd be a time they would break this covenant. And the and the bride, the bride of Jesus Christ, he says, is gone. Now listen, friends, any man that could stand there and tell a person, you're a doctor or you're Mrs. leads and this is where you live. You live at 3765 certain street at a certain place. And this boy in in Grand Prairie, the first first person that came up, he turned his back and told him exactly what he was standing there for and the secret of his heart. And the next person and who they're praying for, I say, "That's the kind of voice I can believe." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of voice I can believe. And that's the kind of voice I have to say. No man can do that. &gt;&gt; And I've sat on the platform and heard that I'm very responsible because I heard it. I saw it. And I can tell you even as I said in prayer this morning, God, that was you. &gt;&gt; No man can do that. That was you. And what you say, I believe. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something else just in case you're missing it. that when you take it into the innermost being, your soul, it's a blood act. &gt;&gt; It's a blood force because God back in some eternity &gt;&gt; back there devised in his mind, it will be blood. Blood will be the substance that will testify of a covenant and a union. &gt;&gt; And when a man and a woman come together in the intimacy of marriage, it will essentially be blood. &gt;&gt; Not do you want a baby, do you want a boy, do you want a girl, it'll be blood. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Satan in a garden inspiring and using the serpent as a tool took and passed blood scene. And the prophet said it was the only seed that would mingle. &gt;&gt; And God cursed him out of existence. He's a missing link. He's gone. &gt;&gt; Cast down to his belly. &gt;&gt; Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? It was a blood sin. And so Jesus had to shed blood and it was the newly created blood of almighty God. But oh, when that cell was broken, but we talk about redemption by blood. I'd like to make something clear. I'm not going to be just a few minutes longer, but I'd like to make something clear. We talk about and sing about. We have a lovely song. I believe sister Leslie Anne has sung it for us and others in the congregation. Redemption by blood. But fellowship by blood is a different thing. Fellowship can only come and I'm not talking about the kind of fellowship you shake your hand say God bless you my brother my sister. That's not the fellowship I'm talking about. I'm talking about fellowship that is so intimate. It is according to the even according to the depths of the Greek and the Hebrew and especially the Greek and the fellowship even comes to an intimacy and they use the word intercourse. It is a fellowship. It is a union. It is where God unites with his child. &gt;&gt; And thus the the terminology children of God doesn't appear in the Old Testament because it wasn't known in the Old Testament. It could only be known in the New Testament when the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood cell was broken and the spirit from that blood cell would come down into a believing heart and they would be birthed again by the blood of Jesus Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have to excuse me. I get I'm getting very very exercised over this. I hope you get it. &gt;&gt; And then that is fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's right. The redeem. To redeem means to pay the price. That's what it means to redeem. To redeem means that one is purchased and saved from the penalty &gt;&gt; of their sin or whatever more. You're saved by redemption. But fellowship is something else. Fellowship comes as a result of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God spoke the word, made redemption, but in his mind it was a bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Every household, every man will slay a lamb for their household. the mind of God. He saw blood being shed. Tell you a lot of people have a difficulty with the Old Testament because there was such such bloodshed. Animals were slain by the thousands. It put a question in anybody's mind. Why? Why would this need to be? Why would these lovely animals and calves and sheep and lambs as loving as they are? Why would they have to die? Thousands of them. Thousands of them and burn out. What kind of a god does this people ask that has to have this kind of incense in his nostrils coming from from the shedding of the life of multitudes? You never understand that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you understand it if you realize back in the mind of God, there'll be blood. &gt;&gt; Blood will be the force. Blood will be the uniting force. And when his arc enemy came and broke that thing, God determined he's going to bring them back again. He's going to unite them to him again. He's going to reunite them &gt;&gt; and then bring them into fellowship. &gt;&gt; And as I said, fellowship is not sufficiently into communion. And the same word of fellowship quania is communion. Intimacy of communion. And that's what God was looking for. in uh in God's God's servant Job this message, Brother Brandham said, "And before Adam could ever approach back in to fellowship with the father, God had to slay an innocent lamb or sheep and make him a cloth to go around him and throw out the welcome carpet for Adam." See how this is worded? Throw out the welcome carpet for Adam to walk back on the carpet of redemption. &gt;&gt; Powerful. &gt;&gt; So he could walk back &gt;&gt; on the carpet of redemption. A bleeding animal hide. &gt;&gt; There's no salvation in an animal hide. But it wasn't salvation in the animal hide. It was salvation in the word of God that spoke it before it happened. &gt;&gt; That's where the salvation was. And people under Moses slew the Passover lamb by the thousands. Hear me believers. And died in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Even though they did the physical aspect and shed the physical blood, they didn't believe the word. &gt;&gt; They didn't believe the word. But when you believe the word, you've got the blood. When you believe the word, you've got Calvary. When you believe the word, you've got Christ. You've got the Passover. You've got the token. You've got everything when you believe the word. &gt;&gt; But if you doubt it, you have nothing. &gt;&gt; If you doubt it, you can come to church. You can boohoo. You can repent. You can do everything you want. But if you doubt the word, you have none of it. &gt;&gt; But if you believe the word, you have all of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today. &gt;&gt; That we will be brought into fellowship by the blood. &gt;&gt; Said blood was the way back to fellowship. When I say blood, I don't want you thinking necessarily of Calvary 2,000 years ago. I want you to think of that one. He was at Calvary because he was first the word. &gt;&gt; And after Calvary, he is the word again. &gt;&gt; You can't believe you can't dis disallow or disbelieve the word now and have the benefits of Calvary back there &gt;&gt; by believing today on the bleeding word. You have the benefits of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My last thought and I close. &gt;&gt; Here's a depth of fellowship. Now, communion. What do we do at communion? What do you do at communion? We take one loaf and we break that loaf. a lot of real intimate communion with one another. We become often eat because eating of the sacrifice is a definite part of communion. So we take the bread and break the bread here and they take the cup which comes out of one cup and it's poured into many because of the number of our people. We used to all have just one cup which now it's not possible. But out of that one cup is poured into the cups. And one bread now is into all of you. A piece of that bread. From that one bread is into all of you. And part of the cup goes into all of us. It becomes inseparable because it becomes part of our system. It goes into our very being and it's into one being it's into the other one and we have made a outward declaration. It is not some act of of the Holy Eucharist or just some communion but we with a revelation of the act you're saying I'm a part of Christ. I'm a part of Christ. I'm a part I'm a cell. You're a cell. &gt;&gt; She's a cell. He's a cell. And we are sons and daughters of God of one family by this bread. &gt;&gt; And we are one loaf. &gt;&gt; And it goes just a wee bit deeper on a number of occasions. And I'm so glad brother Brandham said it this way. He says that the cross, he got up on his altar. Cross &gt;&gt; calls it his altar. Cross. his altar cross. Isaac who was a type of Christ was taken by Abraham on a mount Mariah which is a mount of all the dispute now and uh the Muslim people have identified the rock that he was laid on to be offered. Ah the prophet describes he climbed up on his rock. He carried his wood as Christ carried his cross. He climbed up on his altar as Christ a willing not a not a rebellious not saying I don't want to die he was a perfect type of Christ and he crawled up on his altar and there God delivered him from it Jesus willingly he said to Pilate no man takes my life from me I lay it down and I will take it up again and he laid down on his altar and was raised up between heaven and earth on his altar. But the Apostle Paul says, "Those that eat of the sacrifice, he was the sacrifice, are they not partakers of the altar?" &gt;&gt; When we partake of his body and drink of his blood, we are partakers of his death. &gt;&gt; And we died in him &gt;&gt; so we won't have to die again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We died in him, so we live in him. &gt;&gt; We are partakers in our communion. And the next time you have it, wherever you have it, when you take your bread and take the wine, I want you to say to yourself, I am now a partaker of the cross of Christ. I am a participant in its shame. I'm a participant in its reproach, but I'm also a participant in the fact that it is finished. The price has been paid and I am free from my sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You become a partaker. And even though you say, "Well, is there only emblems?" Let it be known to you &gt;&gt; that you're not that there's no value in the emblem itself. The value is in the word you believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because you believe the bleeding word, you have the benefits of Calvary. &gt;&gt; I could have the very blood of Jesus Christ and sprinkle it here, sprinkle it on you, and it wouldn't do anything. It is what you believe concerning it. &gt;&gt; And we believe. &gt;&gt; We believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. God bless the congregation. God bless the people wherever they are in whatever land around the world where they are just now. I'm so thankful we have fellowship. &gt;&gt; I mean communion. I'm talking about a union that's closer. You might be here with your husband or wife or your loved ones or your children or whatever more. I'm talking about a union that goes far beyond that one. &gt;&gt; It was a little quiet then. &gt;&gt; I trust you know that your union &gt;&gt; with God has gone far beyond any human relationship. This is not a human relationship we have with almighty God through Jesus Christ. We have a supernatural relationship. It's not something you know pie in the sky, some imaginary. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; This may really throw you. The musicians can come. This may really throw you. Prophet said the uniting time. This is the uniting time and the sign of that time. Now we have a prophet sign, but he happened to give us a whole lot of other signs. Listen real close now. You might read it in your newspaper. You might hear it on the radio. You might hear it from someone else. You might hear it preached and say, "Oh my, yes, that is actually happening right now." You wouldn't know that. You wouldn't know that unless a thus sayeth the Lord word had already come. &gt;&gt; You have a message that has told you that. &gt;&gt; And now when you hear it and you see the event, you've always believed it. You believed it because you're a believer. You're elected to be a believer. And so when you see the event, the sign, the sign is actually drawing you into the act. Just like the just like the uh uh the the three wise men, excuse me for taking this extra moment, but the three wise men, they came in and they talked to the authorities. Where is he? They didn't know, but you we'll inquire. Oh, he's supposed to be in Bethlehem. All right. So, they're making their way. They're they're not saying, "Oh, I I guess we missed it. He's not here. Surely he should have been here in Jerusalem. We missed it." No, they kept pursuing. They kept going on. We know that the sign is true. &gt;&gt; And we saw the sign, and we know what it means. &gt;&gt; We haven't seen the event yet, but we know that the sign is correct. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We know the sign is right. &gt;&gt; And the man saw a lot of different signs. They kept looking, following the star, making the journey. We're journeying through life. We're going to work. We're hearing something. We hear something. We hear it preached. I heard a brother preach it. Oh my goodness. There it is right there. Do we keep following it and the sign be confirmed? I'll tell you what. You've got the blood of the testimony in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the evidence that you are united as a son and daughter with God. It's a blood union. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you're able to recognize the sign. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean anything to anyone else. Someone else says, "Ah, nonsense." &gt;&gt; That's just a tourist, a minister of tourism going to the Vatican. What's that mean? Well, it means something to someone else. &gt;&gt; It's a news event to someone else, but to us say this part of the sign. Part of the sign. I had a prophet said, "Watch and see where they are &gt;&gt; and then you'll know what time it is. Hallelujah. And we keep watching and seeing where they are. And it tells us the time that we're in. &gt;&gt; And God our father looks on that and says, "Blessed children, they believe what I speak." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They believe what I've said. &gt;&gt; You are children of a blood covenant. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the very life that was in the blood of Jesus Christ is in my word and you believed it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I might be a fanatic, but I'm it feels good. Anyway, &gt;&gt; why don't we stand? I'd like to sing uh verse or two of the song. It's number 20 22:15. I thought we just had to sing redeemed. &gt;&gt; Redeemed. Not only redeemed, but how I love to proclaim it. &gt;&gt; Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Not a historical thing. Not just historical. The your faith today declares you believe in that back there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will you lend your voice with me? [Music] Redeem God. Redeem my lamb. Redeemer [Applause] forever. I am [Music] free by [Applause] [Music] his child forever. I am redeemed and so happy in Jesus your [Applause] [Music] I presume [Music] his child forever. I am now I'd like to sing the fourth verse last verse I know I shall sing in his beauty we just had a or the some of the musicians and songwriters had a a meeting about songwriting says some of the me some of the songs need to be updated this is one of them I know I shall see see in his beauty I would suggest we sing I know I see him in his beauty I see him now, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I know. I see him beauty, the king in whom I delight, who lovingly pardoned my footsteps and given me something in the night. Redee, redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redee, [Music] redeemed, his child and forever. I am once again redeemed. redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redee [Music] is child and forever. I am. &gt;&gt; How lovely you are Lord Jesus. When I think when we think collectively the king in all of his beauty and glory, oh Lord, in one day even the veil of this flesh will drop and we will rise to seize the everlasting price. We will rise, oh God, and escape this natural mortal life. And there will be another great uniting. For the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together &gt;&gt; with them. Oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. What a hope. What a promise. &gt;&gt; And it's true. Absolute truth. Our confidence is in what you said, not in what we see, not in what we feel, but our confidence is in what you said. And so we say with David, unite our hearts to fear thy name, to reverence what you have spoken, what you've said. causes. I pray Lord that there be a new grip that will be taken by the people upon the word that you have sent us upon the message of the hour for it will do them only good. It will draw them. It will be a drawing force in their lives. Oh God, I thank you for your presence. Thank you for your nearness now. And hear us, Lord, as we declare our love and testify of our sincere devotion to you in the name of Jesus Christ. And before we shake hands and depart from one another, let's sing our anthem. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. Don't let it become just words to you, but let it emanate from your heart. Now, [Music] we love you, Lord Jesus. I love him. He calls me. [Music] Always thank you Lord and [Music] my salary. [Music] God bless you the loved of the Lord and those that love him. We dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. Come early this evening. Our brother Dier speaking and brother John Andy's on Wednesday night. So God bless you and have a nice afternoon refreshed and come back ready to hear what's on our brother's heart. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] [Music]
