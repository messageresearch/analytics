TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] with love. As I walk with a heavenly love, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Amen. Every day with his love. Could you need anything else? No, not a whole lot. Not a whole lot. We bring you greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's very good to see each and every one of you. The more comfortable I get, I can actually try to look in your faces as I look around. So, it's a little bit different for me. I told Brother DDA one uh one evening on the way down to Seattle. I said, "Well, the trick is you just close your eyes. They disappear. Go right away." He said, "I might have to try that sometime." So, I don't know if he's done it or not, but it's uh one of those things where you have to just be comfortable with yourself, not worry about who's around you, not worry about who's looking back at you. Just sing unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want that kind of blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. That Jacob got. Can we start with a chorus? I want I want that kind of blessing that safe and deep and sad my soul. I want I want that full salvation till pillows of heaven or me roll. Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want that full salvation till of heaven or roll. When Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely night and wrestled there alone until the morning light on a princely title to g him for the ride. I know I want that kind of blessing. Oh, I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want that full salvation of heaven or evil. We'll sing it for us again. I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies my soul. I want I want that kind of salvation till below of heaven or below. You saved my soul when I was lost. You've surely been good to me. You saved my soul when I was lost. You've surely been good to me. You saved my soul when I was lost. You've surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh, you filled me with the Holy Ghost. You surely been good to me. Has he filled you? &gt;&gt; You filled me with &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. You've surely been good to me. me. You filled me with the Holy Ghost. You've surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. And singing, Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. If he's healed you, oh, you healed my body when I was sick. You surely been good to me. You touched me, Lord. &gt;&gt; When I was sick, you surely been good to me. You healed my body. When I was sick, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, I know you surely been to me. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. [Music] Amen. 2565 I have a maker. He's formed my heart. Has he given you a new heart? &gt;&gt; Taken out the old stony heart. That heart that couldn't even make a good decision. Couldn't even go down the right road. He had to come and take out your heart. Give you a heart of flesh. One that you could actually say, "Aba, father on your own." It's a hard hard road. But if you turn your life over to his hands and you can sing this song with a true conviction, it'll mean something. I have a maker before my heart and before even time began. My life was in his hands. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls. And he hears me when I call. I have a father. He calls me his own. And he'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each that fall and he hears me when I call. He knows my name. Does he know your name tonight? He knows my every thought. He sees each that and he hears me when I call. He knows my name. Do you got to you got to recognize his voice, saints? He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I call. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, where would we be, Father, if we had not heard that voice? That voice that could call out our name, could give us a new heart. How we love you tonight, Father. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Quiet me. Key of F. Quiet me. Let peaceful waters flow. Learn to be still my soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus walking near. Touch me, Lord, and quiet me. Quiet me. Let peaceful waters flow. Oh, learn to be still, my soul. [Music] Let me hear Jesus walking. Oh, touch me, Lord, and quiet me. Let's all stand and sing it. Oh, quiet me. Let peaceful waters flow. Learn to be still my soul. Let me hear. Jesus walking near. Touch me Lord and quiet me. Quiet me Lord. Quiet me. That peaceful waters flow. Learn to be still my soul. Let me heal. Jesus walking. Oh, touch me Lord and quiet. Oh, if we can just close our eyes and sing it now. Quiet me. Let peaceful waterers flow. Learn to be still my soul. &gt;&gt; I want to hear him tonight. walking amongst his people once again. Touch me Lord and quiet me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Father, quiet our spirits, Lord. Lord, let a peace fall upon the people this evening, Lord. Lord, such a quietness, Father, that we could hear you, Lord, moving in amongst us, Lord, working that which we don't even expect. Dealing with lives, Lord, opening hearts, Father, changing us from glory unto glory &gt;&gt; in that realm which cannot be seen. &gt;&gt; But Lord, we want to manifest fruits from that realm. Lord Jesus, help us tonight. We pray. Father, &gt;&gt; Brother Mike Gier, I'm going to ask you to come, take us to the Lord in prayer this evening. Amen. Who has a need upon your heart that in faith you've looked in the word, you've studied it, you said, "Lord, I know this particular verse is my situation. This particular chapter is right where I'm living and you desire that the Lord would come by your way tonight. That's faith. When you can match up the desire in your heart with the word, he's duty bound to act on it. Your needs are the prayer requests we're going to take tonight. What you each have upon your heart, I don't know. Brother Mike doesn't know. But the one that can do something about it knows. Right where you're living tonight. Brother Mike, would you come? I'm going to ask Brother Mike if you'd help sing 2548. I die believing. [Music] That's the commitment that you have to make. Jesus went to the cross and he died believing. The word was written of him. If you can have that testimony tonight, we'll sing it together. Brother Mike, &gt;&gt; I die a to make. Oh yes, Lord. I die believing if that's what it takes. [Music] I die believing the catching away of your bride. I die believing you're living inside. I die. Difference a token makes. I die believing. If that's what it takes. I die believing the catching away of your bride. I died believing you're living inside. My precious Lord Jesus. Lord truly we are believers oh God &gt;&gt; and our whole desire is Lord to have that rapturing faith to get out of here Lord God. We believe your promises for us in this day Lord. We've been called in this hour, Lord. As your prophet said, this bed in time, Lord God, we've been placed here for a reason, Lord God. Lord, you didn't call us to leave us behind and you didn't call us, Lord God, that we would sit on our hands as it were, Lord God. But you've called us, Lord, to be a people up and about your word, Lord God, doing those things, Lord, that you desire in our lives, Lord God. And father, this night, Lord, we gather, Lord, once again around your word, Lord Jesus, we're longing to be fed, Lord, to come up higher in Jesus Christ, oh God. To take our full and rightful position beside you, Lord God, to be the people you've called us to be, Lord. to be Lord the word in flesh this day Lord God as your prophet said the three-fold manifestation the three-fold purpose of God in this day Lord God was to be in a people to Lord just to bring them to that rapturing condition Lord that they could be the bride on display Lord God that we could usher in that millennium oh God and Father Lord tonight we look to you for these needs amongst your family Lord God in this congregation Lord and we just ask you to go to each and every heart. Lord God, Father, you know what's behind each hand that is lifted. Lord, there are sicknesses, Lord. There are troubles, Lord. There are finances, Lord. Lord, there are family members that are weward, Lord. And Lord, I just think of our brother John Annie and how I believe it was a prophecy. He said, "At this camp, you'll see your children coming in, Lord." He he had declared Lord from your word Lord by the evidence Lord that is stacking up all around us Lord that this is the season that we we are in the rapturing faith in the rapturing condition and we're expecting Lord God Lord we are that quick short work oh God and Lord we're just coming into our place Lord Jesus that all these things that are ours God and just claim them all Lord and Father we just ask you to remember the Bergen family Lord Broaden Cindy Lord, brother Rod's dad passing. Father, he had this testimony, Lord, that he pleased you, Lord God. And Lord, he just took one more step and he's on the other side. But, Father, it's for us that are left behind, Lord, that we grieve. We grieve not for our for our loved one that's passed on, but for ourselves, Lord, as I heard your prophet say today on tape, Lord, we we just want to hold on. We just want to hold on to those people, Lord. We don't want to let them go. We don't want to. But Father God, we just pray that you'd comfort the hearts and oh, just encourage and strengthen them, Lord. Bless them to be a continuing testimony, Lord, for your glory. And as we turn to the word, Lord, just feed our souls. Draw us closer and commit ourselves to you in Jesus precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Jeremy Waldner has a special for us tonight before we turn the service over to our pastor, Brother Biscll. We've got uh one announcement as Jeremy comes. The volunteers that were needed for the tent set up at the camp over in Birch Bay on Saturday has been uh shifted a little bit to 2:00. and all of those volunteers that have come forward and talked to our brother Tom Frey. Um, we appreciate all of your support and I believe that brother Tom has enough. But if you're looking for something to do at 4:00 and you don't want to just stand around and fellowship the help away, I'm sure they'd appreciate you coming out giving them a hand. God bless you. So many times our friends will tell us, "I won't let you down." But when the storms are threatening danger, they cannot be found. But there's a friend whose name is Jesus, and his promise is real. There is no doubt he'll bring me out when he says I will. I will fight all of your battles. Give them all to me. I can make all of your trials end in victory. I have all power and glory. It is mine to give. Oh, what a blessing. I am resting for he said I will. The devil tries to make me stumble, make me so afraid, but I'll wrestle him all through the night till the breaking of the day. They're holding fast to God's dear promise. Glory is revealed. He stands there waiting, gently saying, "Child, you know I will. I will fight all of your battles. Give them all to me. I can make all of your trials end in victory. I have all power and glory. It is mine to give. Oh, what a blessing I am resting for. He said, "I will. I will fight all of your battles. Give them all to me. I can make all of your trials end in victory. I have all power and glory. It is mine to give. Oh, what a blessing. I am resting for he said I will. Oh what a blessing I am resting for. He said I will. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When he said I will &gt;&gt; you didn't have to say and I will. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox isn't it? In simplicity, God reveals himself. He says, "I'll take this upon me. I will give you rest." &gt;&gt; As our pastor comes, we'll sing 20001 on the screen. At the campground, 2:00. Don't know if anybody got confused on that. It was originally at 4. We want you out there at 2:00 to help set up the tent. And those in the choir, make sure that you're here at 700 PM Friday evening for a practice. We'll start with the chorus. We will of God still hold me closer till I am holding in God be closer till I am lost in thee will of God still hold me closer till I and all lost in the sweet of God. Till me closer, till I am holdy lost. Take thee one more time. Sweet will of God still hold me closer when I am lost in the sweet [Music] me closer Till I am holy lost in thee. &gt;&gt; If we ever get lost, that's the place we want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we have uh just before we turn to the word, we have a couple of announcements we'd like to make. And I don't know, did they say anything but brother Rod's dad? They prayed for him as you had prayer. I I didn't hear everything in the study. Brother Rod Bergen's father passed away early this morning a little bit after midnight. And uh passed into the presence of God. uh as you know, of course, he's not just Rod's father, but he's a granddad to a lot of the uh couples and families that are here in the church and uh all the Bergen children and Jeremy and Jake and Anna uh and Jonathan. So, we want to remember them and their spouses. Uh, Brother Berg and I've known him for a lot of years. Just a lot of years. And one thing I I just sent Rod a little email this morning. I always found him to have a just a not only a twinkle, but his eyes flashed when you'd speak about anything that you know would touch his heart spiritually. And um the congregation many of you perhaps most of you don't know but Rod's parents went to Ern Baxter's church and Ern Baxter was one of brother Brandham's first managers and do you hear brother Brandham talk about him all the time and he was a Vancouver pastor and Rod and his Rod's parents went to that church and that that was their pastor for many many many years. So uh they've been uh acquainted with the early ministry of course and uh so we'll remember that the family each of them and remember especially Rod's mother uh she has lost a daughter a granddaughter and a husband in just the last little while very short time that's a heavy heavy loss and I have a granddaughter in an accident and a daughter by cancer and now her husband. And regardless of how ready a person might think they are, you're never really fully ready, you know, for that moment of such separation. So, we'd like to remember Rod's mother and uh pray that even in this in this time of crisis, and that's what I've always believed, in a time of crisis is a great opportunity for God to make himself known to a person. And that's what we want to pray. And no one knows him as well as we should. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we're coming up to the camp time and uh people are gearing up that are in the different departments and areas of help. And I just so appreciate it. I mean, let me say from my heart that a camp of this magnitude just plain wouldn't happen if we didn't have willing people that just get in there and and I find the whole congregation is is willing and whatever area you're able to just lend a hand or be called on. Uh there are so many that are taking responsibility and how how appreciative I am and how indebted we are as a congregation to have uh have a a people like this that are not only uh you're giving people of your own hospitality and that's what we have to ask for right now. We're getting calls from the from the saints in the Seattle Tacoma area and there's quite a number of them would like to come up and take in the meetings but they're not able of course to have uh to get motel and all all of that. They can't afford that. So we do need accommodation but the accommodation I think uh brother diddy you were saying needs to be on the US side. Is there any &gt;&gt; preferably preferably because then we won't have the border to contend with during the meetings. So now for all of you that are living on the US side, if you can accommodate one or two or a family or whatever more, if you would please uh contact the office, call the office and speak with Sister Bonnie. If she's not there, speak with brother Dier. And if you, you know, if you can roll out a sleeping bag or something, uh, or we can pretend we're an Indian, just roll out a little grass mat, whatever. But if you can accommodate anyone and give them nice hospitality for these few days of meetings or maybe just the weekend, uh, just let uh, Sister Bonnie or brother Dier know. All right, that's good. And remember in your in your giving when you're giving your tithes and offerings now like you to remember that the we the camp is a very heavy cost and we uh we've never really said anything. We don't make any appeals about it. We think that you're uh you know you're adult. you know how things are and you know what things cost and uh you know in time you rent chairs and and the grounds and so on and then there are a lot of children that come. We like to make certain that all the children can come. We don't want anybody of this congregation at least uh to not be able to come because of cost. We say bring them anyhow. Doesn't the congregation you agree with that? bring them anyhow. And we want them in that atmosphere. And the young people, we want them in that atmosphere. And we're going to make sure that everything's covered. God has always blessed it. Amen. Every time. Has always blessed it. Do you remember the time that the Baptist campground undercharged us by $11,000? How many know about that? How many don't know about it? Oh, there's a whole lot more don't know about it. Well, the undercharged it was all settled because we're we're one group and we're probably the only group is from what I finally heard that the night the meeting is over. We write a check and we're all done. We're out of here. We're history. Goodbye. And so, Brother Tom wrote the check and uh what was his name? Bill, wasn't it? Yeah, brother Bill. Bill, I call him brother. And uh so we we we were on their case a lot of times. We were on their case over the food and we were on their case over the rough necks they had around and the long-haired and all the rest of it. And I mean, you know, and and uh I couldn't understand how they did business. I just couldn't understand. We offered to fix their cabins up because they were just, as far as I was concerned, and I hope they're listening, just ratinfested things. And I we offered to fix their cabins up. We'll f we'll do it free. We'll go and fix your cabins up. Oh, no, no, no. And then one year they didn't have power to the grounds where we pitched the tent. So, brother Jim Douly came down there with his brought a great big telephone pole and those things, you know, cost nothing but money. and his great big augur digger truck and dug a hole and put up that professional pole and that's all his and strung the cables and everything in there and they finally had power to their that ground. After camp was over they asked us come and move that pole out. So we did go ahead and took the pole out. That's the way they did business. this one time, one of the last times, Brother Tom and Joanne were driving home and you know when you're trying to figure out three times a day times so many young people and so many counselors and then three times a day for the meals and so on so forth. We should have said one time a day cuz those hush puppies or whatever it is they feed you just and corn dogs are my goodness, aren't you glad that's over? We ought to have a roar of amen from the young people. My goodness, I'm glad that's over. And uh we we they're driving home and they're saying, "It seems like there's a mistake. You know, we paid the bill, but it seems like something's just not right." And here they've been already an hour away, almost home. And they finally conclude they've got to be figures as near as we can figure it 11,000. and they undercharge us $11,000. It was all done, finished. We paid them goodbye. So Tom and Joanne turned around and drove back. And by this time, it's, you know, midnight, the wee hours of the morning. And there there's a little light glowing over the dining room table. And there's Bill and his wife, you know, and they're they're they're grinding it out. So Tom knocks on the door. Bill, what are you doing? What are you doing here, Tom? Well, I think you undercharged us. I think you've made a big mistake. He says, "We're trying to figure that out." He, we've been figuring that out. We're trying to figure that out. Well, Tom says, "Well, we figured it out and you've undercharged us by about $11,000." And he said, "And you come all the way back?" He You could have come tomorrow. He was just happy we'd come back, period. He said, "And you come all the way back just to do this?" Tom says, "Well, I didn't think you'd sleep very much, and I knew I wouldn't sleep very much." So, yeah, we came back, sat down, wrote him out a check. He said, "You people are Christians. Real Christians." Tom says, "Well, why isn't that what anybody would do?" He said, 'You wouldn't believe how many churches owe us money yet? For years, they've owed us money.' Tom says, "What kind of people?" He says, "Baptists." [Laughter] So, I was glad we had a better testimony. Amen. Hallelujah. We should be able to have a good record of those on the outside. Amen. What was it we were just singing? Let let's sing. Uh we are standing on holy ground. We just stand up will you please with me? All right. Lift it up to him now. We are standing on holy ground. And I know there are angels all around. Oh, let us praise Jesus. Now we are standing in his presence on holy ground. &gt;&gt; We'll bow in a moment of prayer. Heavenly Father, we believe as we have read in your word, when men or a man or woman or a people when they meet with their maker, meet with their God, then that is a sacred place. We believe tonight this is a sacred place. It's a sacred place because you have spoken. You have given us your word. You've delivered it, oh God, through such a faithful voice and messenger. And now we want to be faithful to the cause. We want to be faithful, oh God, as a witness. And you shall be witnesses, Jesus. You said you shall be witnesses. And here we are at the end of the consummation of the ages. And Lord Jesus, we're here in anticipation for tonight, for this weekend coming up, the beginning, oh God, of of the families coming together and from out of town and wherever. Oh God, may it just rain down with the glory of God upon the people. Do mighty things above all we could ask or think. Lord, I pray the hearts of the people will be not only in expectation, but they will come prepared and ready. And as the minister prays, I pray that they will be in prayer. May they be in prayer through the day and in their work, oh God. Just saying, Lord, have your way. Lord, move amongst us. Lord, prepare my heart. May I be a vessel to receive and be filled to overflowing. Lord, I ask that you will anoint brother Ron Spencer. Uh the singers that sing and the musicians that play, the people who are on the sound and working in the grounds and the deacons, oh God, and the video people, everyone, Lord, the sisters at work and brothers as well, you know, to feed the people. I pray that you will just somehow, oh God, you will do as you've done over all these many, many years. You will give energy and strength to the people. May we serve you with great joy in Jesus name. Now I'm depending upon you, Lord. I pray you'll bless these words tonight and the people as they receive it, anoint me, oh God, to say what needs to be said in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Going to start from by reading out of Romans the 9th chapter. kind of starting from a little different angle tonight, but I still I want to fill in some uh blanks if I can from Sunday morning and uh where I was speaking on your identification for rapture and uh just you know announce the meeting the service from a little bit of natural things which today is so we grow up with uh having to have identif identification. But I'm interested in identification for rapture. Now, we're going to start to read about verse uh I think we'll read from verse 9. For this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand. Watch that please. That the word of God, the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, the elder shall serve the younger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then, it is not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but of God that showeth mercy. Amen. God bless you as you have your saints. Verse 18 of this chapter says, "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardenth." He has mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he hardeneth whom he willth he hardens. And the scripture is bringing out the sovereignty of God. This is a subject that we can never fully grasp or fully understand. If you could, you'd probably understand God and and he's just beyond our comprehension. Uh now, the reason I'm bringing this from this direction is because the rapture for sure falls under the sovereignty of God. Because brother Brandham says the rapture is a revelation and revelation God is sovereign in his revelation. He's absolutely sovereign. And the the clay or the vessel cannot say to the potter, why hast thou made me thus? &gt;&gt; In the message, who is this Melzdc? I'm laying a foundation. Now, he said, you remember how we read of the scripture which we just read. Now, not him that willth nor him that runth, but God which showeth mercy. See, and that his predestination might stand true. That his predestination might stand true. God's sovereign in his choosing. Would you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; He said, did you know that God's sovereign? Who was back yonder to tell him a better way to make the world? &gt;&gt; Who would dare tell him he was how he was running his business wrong? Even the very word itself very sovereign. Even now here's what I want to get across to you. Even the revelation is sovereign. He reveals to whom he will reveal. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of course there's a there's a part that we need to play. The part you need to play and I need to play is that we need to be conditioned. We need to keep ourselves in preparation. We need to have ourselves spiritually minded. We also need to yield to the spirit, not to the flesh. If we yield to the flesh, we'll be blinded and we'll we'll we'll have we'll go down the wrong trail. But if we are spiritually minded and he said he reveals to whom he will reveal. He said the very revelation itself is sovereign in God. Now, this, you know, I tell you what, some of brother Brandham's statements really uh cause us to think and turn our head around a wee bit. And I don't want you to uh be, you know, lazy in your mind. I want you to be real thoughtful because it I know it takes me some time to just sit and ponder what it is he's saying. So, I had this up to go onto the screen, but I want to take the time tonight. The very revelation itself is sovereign in God. And that's how people talking about others now. He said they will pound at things and jump at things and hit at things. In other words, there's all kinds of enthusiasm, excitement, and emotion that can take place and not knowing uh what they're doing. He said God is sovereign in his works. I've been in meetings where they, you know, take people, are going to shake people, are going to force them to, you know, whether they speak in tongues are going to force them to get healed or force them. God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; He's just absolutely sovereign. And the more we rest in it, the easier it is. &gt;&gt; We just say, "God, you're sovereign." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not of one who runth. Uh, it's of God who showeth mercy. Not of him that wills or him that runs or what all our stewing and so on. It doesn't achieve anything. It's God that shows mercy. God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; So we don't want to pound at things. We don't want to just put a whole lot of energy out and not obtain. God is also sovereign in the revelation of the rapture. He's sovereign. And as I have been in this subject and been pondering these things now for some time, I am thoroughly convinced that the truth and the experience of the rapture, as I said several times now and certainly said in a lot of meetings, I do not believe that the the subject of the rapture is something that we just gain more knowledge of the raptures and revelation of the rapture is not more knowledge. The revelation of the rapture is more relationship. We enter into a relationship with him. It's a life with him, a communion with him, an intimacy with him. And until it is like it was with Enoch, who was our type, and we're going to go back to it again this evening. Until God took him, &gt;&gt; his communion with God. He walked with God. He didn't just walk with God, taking a step at a time, but he had a walk with God. had a communion with God and God took him. We'll perhaps come to that a little bit later on. So, I'm convinced that the rapture is a revelation. But that does not take away I want to say it quickly and want you to hear it when we say it's a revelation and I have heard where people uh in the message put so much emphasis on well the rapture is a revelation that you don't know whether they have any belief that there's anything of a physical event that takes place. But the re the rapture is not just some mental exercise. The rapture is an event. &gt;&gt; But I believe that it is a revelation to the believer before it becomes an event to them. &gt;&gt; Salvation is &gt;&gt; even healing is &gt;&gt; it's something that is made real to you. It's made alive to you and then you enter into it. And so now in the message, the rapture, brother Brandham says, "But to the church, the bride, the rapture is a revelation to her." That's why I believe it needs to be preached, needs to be spoken about if God leads in that way. And he's certainly been leading me in this direction. He said it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of Christ will will be watch him prophesy now will be waiting &gt;&gt; for that revelation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Not just a revelation but that revelation of the rapture. The true bride will be waiting for that revelation &gt;&gt; of the rapture. said, "Now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith." Now watch, he takes it onto another little angle. The revelation is faith. You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you. Faith is a revelation. Faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. that could that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it was not. Anything that was contrary to what was revealed to him, he disregarded it as though it was not. &gt;&gt; You'll have a child. Your wife will bear a son. And the scripture says in the New Testament that he staggered not at the promise of God. He believed in God. Amen. And you could not get him convinced that his body was dead beyond producing a child. He didn't know how, but he knew it was going to happen because God had said so. And his wife is, regardless of how withered up and dried up and and passed beyond the age, far beyond the age of bringing forth life. And that all speaks to us because it regardless of how far circumstances may come in your own personal life if God has said so. If God has called you to be a believer, you know, one thing, one thing that's good for us when things go really sideways and we experience reversals and have all kinds of difficulties and whatever more in this age, it's good just to bring it down to the lowest common denominator and that is, are you a child of God? Are you a son of God, a daughter of God? You say, "Well, when you reduce it down, I know I'm not a child of the devil. I hate the world. I have no interest in his ways. I have no interest in his pleasures. I have no interest in where he's going." &gt;&gt; I know I'm a child of God. &gt;&gt; And once you have made that declaration, then I can assign to you all the righteousness of Jesus Christ. I can assign to you all the power of heaven on your behalf. I can assign to your account and I can take off of your account all the sin, all the unbelief, everything else because Jesus Christ bore it for you. Hallelujah. I can attribute to you all his righteousness and take away all your unbelief. You are justified in the presence of God and accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And sometimes we have to get down to that point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And one s, you know, you might say, I haven't got a trace of feeling. I haven't got an ounce of emotion. I I don't think my prayer could reach the ceiling. All of that's fine. But when you get down to that lowest that get down to ground zero, I am a child of God. You've got a revelation that hell can't shake. &gt;&gt; That's that's what we're talking about. And right there, faith will act on that confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, we have been a great deal in uh into Luke the 24th chapter, and I'm sure you know it well now. I'm sure that most everyone has been reading it and has been pondering on it. I'm not speaking out of it, but I need to keep referring back to it because it has really it has set for myself personally. It has actually set my whole range of thinking in a different direction. I I've been pondering so long and now over some years how how the prophet has called Luke 24 a prophecy a prophecy made clear uh made clear by the prophecy events made clear by the prophecy that is a powerful thing that God has and then I begin to see how God laid out so many things in the scriptures and to and for myself now tonight and I've been speaking to you as I uh I said I would be speaking to you as God is dealing with me and that I am doing. I'm not here preaching a series of services now as as God keeps dealing with me. I keep bringing it to you and sometimes I don't have a whole lot of you know feeling or enthusiasm about it but I I just see it is something is different and something is seems to be magnified. God takes a certain portion of it and just keeps grinding on it, grinding it down and that's why I keep bringing it to you because it keeps coming in my mind and I can't get away from it. And so when I begin to see over all these many months and even some years that Luke 20 I pondered that for so long years ago I preached on Jesus himself drew near. You may remember that that's that's some years ago. This was already grinding on me then said there is something there. There is a key. There is a secret. When I I thought that was so astounding that brother Brandham and then it became with a greater impact when I realized it was his second last service, second service from the last. And he's talking about now this event's a prophecy. So soon as I looked at as a prophecy, it put it all another light. This these men are walking on the way to Emmas. They don't know. They're actually laying down a prophecy that's going to happen in reality to someone else. It's happening to two people there. But they they're walking with the resurrected Christ. But there's going to be a whole group of people that are going to walk with the resurrected ones. This is their this is their prophecy. And it's going to happen in in a in a in a full way. Amen. Oh, and when you think then it's got to go a step further. It has to come to the place where you identify and that's why I come to identification. You identify with a specific scripture that scripture is speaking of me. Who are you John the Baptist? Who are you? Who are you? He could have said Elizabeth's my mother. Zachcharias is my father. You've known me since, you know, since my birth. All of these things. We've lived here. My father has he has been in the temple all the time. But his only identification was, I am one. &gt;&gt; I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Isaiah had to say that. When Isaiah said that, he was prophesying of one man. And when that one man came on the scene, he reached right back because he also was a prophet messenger. Reached right back, laid hold of that scripture and says, "This is my ID." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is my identification. &gt;&gt; If you want to know who I am, this is who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't say I'm John or didn't say anything. When Jesus was asked many times about where did he get his authority and why are you doing a certain thing and this is the Sabbath and why have you done this? Why have you commanded this man to you know carry his bed and all of these things? Why why don't your disciples pay tribute and washing of hands and all of these things you know he never gave himself an identity back to his parents. never gave himself or to his mother, I should say, never gave himself any identity to Joseph. Never gave himself identity to the synagogue or to the priesthood or to the high priest or to the Levites. Never gave himself any identity that way. His identity was always, "It is written." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is written. We as believers in this end time really need to let that be absorbed and not forgotten when we go out this door. We need to be able to go far beyond where we were born and what country we lived in and where we've been educated. That stuff ought to leave us essentially and say, "I am here because God called me. God called my name. I can tell you the place. I can point back to the place where God dealt with me and different stations in my life. I've been to Bethl. I've been to this mountain. I've been in that valley. I've been in a lot of places. But that's my identity. My identity is here in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's really the direction I'm coming from. &gt;&gt; I think that's really the direction that we need to come from. We need to have a whole lot less connection with everything that's down here. We're involved with it. You can be involved as involved as you need to be, but as far as feeling that real connection, you know, we don't have to be connected to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is our church. Uh, we love this place. We've put a lot of hours, hundreds of hours, and we've put our earnings and all of this. I tell you what, this building and this land and this parking lot means just about nothing to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm ready to leave it at a moment's notice. &gt;&gt; Anything that we have and not not necessarily even to go in a rapture. If God would say, "Leave this and go over here. Leave this and I want you to go to the native Indians." And he spoke to me the way he spoke to me to come here in the first place. I can tell you what, friends. I can tell you I've left too many things to to say anything otherwise. I'd be history. I'd be out of here. I'd call the board together and I say, "God has said something to me." And how it's going to happen, I don't know. And what's going to happen when I get there, I don't know. But I'm on my way. Hallelujah. We've got to be able to hang on to things loosely. &gt;&gt; So now, the sovereignty of God is so evident in Luke the 24th chapter. Just I just want to draw and filling in some blanks. Now the sovereignty of God when the scripture says and it came to pass. Now this is the prophecy. And it came to pass and I can say that here tonight as I look from one face and one family to another to another. I can say and it came to pass as it did here in the as it did in the prophecy. So has it in the fulfillment that Jesus himself drew near. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't another person. It wasn't just a good sermon. It might have been in a meeting. It might have been in a special place or or someplace that wasn't special that the Holy Spirit begin to speak to you. And we can say tonight and it came to pass. It was here in the it was here in the prophecy. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now in the end time, hallelujah, when a prophet says that this is a prophecy for this time, I can say, "And it did come to pass in the end times that Jesus himself, the resurrected one, drew near &gt;&gt; and went with them." &gt;&gt; God in his sovereignty. Oh, &gt;&gt; I need you to absorb that &gt;&gt; in his sovereignty. &gt;&gt; Now, you might wonder about yourself tonight and say, "Well, I don't know if that really I don't know if that really uh has reference to me." What are you doing here? &gt;&gt; How did you get here? &gt;&gt; I say that you're here. You're here on this Wednesday night. even young people, teenagers, whatever more. There's a there's all kinds of places where teenagers are tonight in malls and this and that and all kinds of entertainment of the world. And all of you people uh got jobs and responsibilities and mothers with children and whatever more. And if you're unattached, you got all kinds of places you could have gone, but you're here in the house of God. I say, why are you here? I can tell you you're here whether you want to accept it or not. You're here because Jesus Christ himself drew near and went with you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He's the one who talked with you when you didn't realize who was talking to you. He was the one you poured your woes out to. And this is the sovereignty of God. There was a lot of people in Israel. And there were disciples, mighty apostles. But Jesus, God himself, selected these two men. One has never been named. That's what we know about him. But you will meet him one day and you'll find you'll discover who it was that is called Cleopus's friend. You'll meet him. But in the mind of Almighty God, this unnamed man, unnamed, you'll find that in the mind of God, it was predestinated by election that he would be the one that would walk and have opportunity to speak with the Lord Jesus and be the first to do so at that on that level. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the bride's type. &gt;&gt; This is your type. &gt;&gt; Who are you? I'm in Luke 24. &gt;&gt; I'm one of those that Jesus Christ himself drew near. &gt;&gt; He came on my pathway. Who are you? I heard the resurrected Christ speak. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he told me and instructed me, revealed to me. He was alive. It is a personal revelation. It's not something I just gained in my mind. This isn't an Easter story I heard a preacher preach. This is something I experienced. I walked down the road. He walked with me. My pathway, not the synagogue, not the church. My road. My pathway. Hallelujah. my problem, my trouble, my sadness. He walked with me. Why? I don't know. That's his choosing. But he did it. That's the sovereign God. Sovereign almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why did he choose to? None of our business. Who they are? None of our business. Why did he choose you? None of our business. He did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why did you hear it? I don't know. None of my business. He did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You heard it. Why are you young people born in a believer's home? I don't know. None of my business. That's God sovereign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you worthy? None of us is worthy. You'll never be worthy. &gt;&gt; You'll never be worthy. You'll never gain that status. &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? Because he's God. Because he's sovereign. The revelation is sovereign. Faith is sovereign. The whole thing is sovereign &gt;&gt; and the clay has no business. Pass the potter. Why did you do it thus? Why did you do it thus? Why did they have to live it back there? I don't know. But they did it for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that made the whole Bible &gt;&gt; a different book for me, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just in the last short time, &gt;&gt; begin to realize those men were, Brother Brandham says, those prophets spoke things they would never have said. &gt;&gt; They would never have spoke it if they knew, but they were moved. The scripture says they were moved by the Holy Ghost and they spake. And as I said, Sunday and David said, "All my bones, they stare at me." at me and brother Brandham says me speaking of himself it sounded personal but he's speaking right he was speaking of Christ now I had a question and I I know that a lot of people had the question and brother Brandon makes a statement and I'm just going right to the right to the core of it right now he said when he says but the brightest of she is him he says another place that the wife come out of the, you know, the wife is part of the husband because he's talking from a spiritual sense. The wife is part of the husband and the husband and the wife through holy marriage and bring forth the children. They all it all all comes from him in a spiritual sense because it all comes from the father. You understand? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so the Holy Spirit of God way back, we'll say back because we're creatures of time, caused men to say certain things and to speak and they were moved by the Holy Spirit and caused women who were the type of the bride to do certain things, but they were moved of the Holy Spirit. They were moved of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can you can never convince me that Tamar could explain to anybody what she was doing. &gt;&gt; You could never get anybody to anybody who's a sound Bible believer to to believe that that Tamar had it all figured out. She didn't have anything. All she knew she also was being moved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it was written that he shall be of the tribe of Judah. And Satan was trying to eliminate them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it was just hanging on a thread, but she was moved of God. Cast down her reputation. &gt;&gt; And as the songwriter said, she stared the burning and the sword in the face. And the stone, she should have been stoned, but she paid no attention to that because there was something driving her, moving her. There must be a son in this lineage. &gt;&gt; She couldn't explain that. Sovereign Almighty God driving her &gt;&gt; beyond all of her reasoning. &gt;&gt; She's a type. &gt;&gt; You're laying down a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Laying down a prophecy in her life that there would be those kind of people that would be driven beyond all reason, beyond all understanding, beyond their own, beyond any measure they think that they possess. They're driven. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Christ must be expressed &gt;&gt; in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God and his sovereignty. You could never get them to understand what it was and what was causing them to do what they were doing. Prophet said in modern events once again said Jesus is up from the dead and living among his people. And what a beautiful thought. He's here the same today as he was that day and the day he's referring to. I I spoke this but I did not give you the actual quote. He spoke this in reference to the two men on the way to Emmas and Jesus is there walking with them. Was it real? Absolutely it was real. Couldn't be more real. A living person walking with them. And he says and he is here. He's here the same. And the same now in identification is identical. It's identical. You cannot show another picture at the border. When you cross a border, it has to be your picture. &gt;&gt; It has to be a recent picture. It's time sensitive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are not going back 500 years trying to have our example back there. Our example is one of today. This is the message of the hour. This is an end time message to an end time people as a it's a solution to end time conditions. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; It's an answer to end time problems. Hallelujah. It's the solution for end time children, end time families, end time churches. Hallelujah. I'm glad I'm part of the end time people, the Exodus people. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not some weak watered down message that we have. &gt;&gt; And he's here today as he was that day. &gt;&gt; That was the prophecy. And I'd suggest that the fulfillment, if anything, is more real than even the prophecy. &gt;&gt; More real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is moving amongst his people today more than he did even in other ages. And yet the people are having exactly the same response. Now, brother Brandham had to point to his his scriptures and you know where part of his scriptures was in Revelation 3. and he identified it. I read it today. He only referred to the scripture. They put him out. &gt;&gt; They put Jesus out. &gt;&gt; They put him on the outside. Thrust him out. And he just kept bringing the scripture. I'm going to read you another quote in just a moment reading pointed to a scripture just like just like John the Baptist said, "I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness." And they said, "Ah, you're no voice." He could have said, "What are you doing here then? Why are you here?" People talk about brother Brandham said, "Oh, he's no prophet or he's this or they're just following a dead man." Well, then what are they what are they so stirred up about &gt;&gt; if it's just nothing? If it doesn't mean anything and the person was nobody, what what's all the excitement? What's all the stir? Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've heard a certain sound. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet, he just he just goes to Luke, I'm sorry, to uh Revelation the 3rd chapter verse about 2021 and there and behold, I stand at the door and knock. He said he was thrust out and right at the time he was thrust out. &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. That was the prophecy. &gt;&gt; That was prophetic and he's living it out. &gt;&gt; His ministry is a fulfillment of it. John the Baptist says of him, could we identify him with any denomination? He came in the same at the same time there was many denominations and he never affiliated himself with any of them. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is saying that because it extends further. He said so we couldn't say that he was a Pharisee or a Sadducee &gt;&gt; or so forth. We wouldn't identify him with a certain denomination. So we couldn't say he was a Pharisee or Sadducee. says he come for the people. He goes on to say if he come he would have see the same way he's here tonight to heal those who accept him to save those who will accept him. He comes in in the form in the same form in the same way if he come he would have to come in a scriptural identification now that's I want you to catch that phrase scriptural identification. If he came, Jesus who came and visited earth when he came he didn't identify himself with a synagogue &gt;&gt; or his earthly family or his lineage. He never gave it. Never identified himself with any of these things. &gt;&gt; He always identified himself with a scripture. It would be good for us not to hear this just as a Wednesday service, but to go out from this place and say that has to be my pattern. &gt;&gt; I have to see myself in the scripture and make that my identification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are you? &gt;&gt; I'm a person that's heard a certain sound. &gt;&gt; I've heard a certain sound. I've heard a voice. What voice did you hear? was Malachi 4 5 and 6. I heard a voice, &gt;&gt; a restoring voice, &gt;&gt; a prophetic voice. I've heard that voice. That's why I am what I am. &gt;&gt; That's why we are who we are. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Just listen. Now, this this carries on just a wee bit. And I've only taken very selected uh very selected verses. I mean uh portions out of this account. Jesus identified himself as prophet revealing the secrets of the heart. That's how he identified himself. And brother Brandham said Jesus identified himself a scriptural identification to the Jews. Please notice the identification. I gave it I gave it to you in quite some detail on Sunday. But he said to the Jews that he was the Messiah by being a prophet. That was his identification. &gt;&gt; Who are you? So he he manifested or he showed himself. He showed his life and he he demonstrated that he was a prophet. And by demonstrating he was a prophet, that proved he was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By being a prophet, that was his identification. A Messiah is the anointed one. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the anointed one. &gt;&gt; The prophets were anointed ones. &gt;&gt; You are anointed ones. &gt;&gt; And there are false anointed ones. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. But this was his identification. And Jesus identified himself as a prophet by revealing the secrets of the heart. He identified himself as a messiah to the Jews by perceiving the thoughts that was in their heart by speaking to them their names and different things. And they knew that he was the prophet that the Lord had promised to raise up. Now listen, those real true ones who was predestinated to that. &gt;&gt; They were predestinated to that proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going slow. Take that as a prophecy. There are real true ones &gt;&gt; in this last hour &gt;&gt; that they are predestinated to that sign. They're predestinated to that voice. You are here waiting for it. You didn't perhaps even know it, but you were here waiting. Nothing else fit. &gt;&gt; Nothing else actually satisfied to the depths. It didn't fit you completely. Oh, you tried this and you tried that. You tried the world. You tried sin. You tried church. You tried religion. This one, that one, and the other one. But somehow it didn't fit. Then one day, one day, not because we're saying so, but one day is my experience. &gt;&gt; I'm testifying tonight. One day something just came to me inside and the answers of my soul were the questions were answered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it fit. &gt;&gt; It was just perfect. &gt;&gt; And I never had to search again. It was all over. The search was done. &gt;&gt; Not because I was a minister. I wasn't I wasn't at that time I couldn't minister those things because they weren't a reality to me. &gt;&gt; I was a young fellow with a lot of questions. But one day the answer came. One day the voice came. One day the book became a totally new book. &gt;&gt; And it kept unfolding and unfolding and still a new book. &gt;&gt; And so he says he identified himself as the Messiah to the Jews by perceiving the thoughts that was in their hearts. Now he's speaking a message here and he's actually got a prayer line in front of him. Notice how he moves through this. I actually have gone back in my experience to a greater simplicity than perhaps I have even I haven't had the same degree of appreciation for the simplicity. I wish I could. I'm just going to tell you I I gave you a whole about eight or 10 of him just calling the people by name. Listen to me, my brother, my sister, for this little brother up here called Ed Biscll. To me, that is one of the most astounding, indescribable mysteries. I cannot grasp. I cannot even explain where a man goes that stands there on the floor like any other man stands on the floor and looks like anyone else and when he gets warm persspires and whatever more and and and stand there and and look at people and be obviously in some other place. Where is he? And if you can explain some kind of a gift where people have been trying to explain it for decades, why did God do it? &gt;&gt; Obviously, it's not of man. &gt;&gt; It's something that's supernatural. &gt;&gt; And we cannot find any place in history it's ever been done. Why was it done now? Why was it done? Well, we could say, "Well, it was the end time." All right, fine. It's the end time. But what's going to happen in the end time? I can tell you now if you're going to go back to the same man who spoke these things, he said that was done to the Jews because that was a sign to the real true elect ones &gt;&gt; to them. And he said he did it to the Jews and he did it to the Samaritans but never once did it to the Gentiles. Never once. Never once. Never once. And then suddenly here in your generation and in my generation here it comes. &gt;&gt; Never was done before. Who are you? &gt;&gt; The two men on the way to Emmas. Who are you ladies who run to the tomb? Who are you? I can't explain it, but he did it. &gt;&gt; And I don't know why he did it, but he did it. He did it because he's sovereign. He did it because he does what he willth. &gt;&gt; And we have no choice. We have nothing to say about it. He touched your heart wherever you were. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I just got to be forceful tonight and bring this home to you, my friend. It's God. &gt;&gt; It is God. It is not your doing or my doing. It's not a preacher. It's not even William Brandom. It's the God that chose him. &gt;&gt; He said he didn't even want that life. He wanted to be a trapper. &gt;&gt; It wasn't him. He wanted to be a trapper. He couldn't be a trapper because God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; It's God who said you're going to live in you're going to live in motel. You're going to live in hotels. You're going to be driven around. You're going to have people pulling at you. You're going to have people waiting for you. You're never going to have hardly a moment's notice. You're going to have to run to even get a little time by yourself. You're going to have to run. &gt;&gt; It's not our doing. &gt;&gt; It's not our choosing. Not his choice. It's not your choice. God called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sovereign God said, "You're going to come. &gt;&gt; You're going to leave your family. You're going to leave your friends. You're going to leave your associates. And you're going to follow me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to reveal myself to you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with you. And Jesus himself drew near and went with you. &gt;&gt; Went with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You thought you're going to run away from it, but you couldn't run. You couldn't get away from him because he went with you. The real true ones. I said I wanted to find out what what he really meant by real. The real ones. Real is to have actual existence. Real is not theoretical. Real is not theory. &gt;&gt; Real is not imaginary. &gt;&gt; Real is to have genuine existence. &gt;&gt; That's real. And so what he's saying is the real or the the the the true ones have and and true and and real ones. And to be true is to be faithful to fact or reality, conformable to an existing pattern that's true ones, true to the pattern. And he goes on in the same message, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever in Hot Springs, Arkansas. And he goes on, notice now, I just want you to stay with me. He said he promised here to identify himself among us the same way that he did. He keeps going back. He promised to identify himself. He said he he used the scriptural identification and he promised to identify himself. He says now you say here it is. But you say but how did he identify himself? He asks a question. Then he answers it. If we can hear him speak, if we can hear him speak, then that identifies him of being with us. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you tonight, if we can hear him speak, isn't that complicated? No. It's so simple. If you stumble over anything, you could stumble over that. If we can hear him speak, say, "Open your ears. Open your hearts." If you can hear him speak, that means he's identifying himself with you. You may not understand what he's saying, but if you can hear him speak, maybe you're hearing Brother Ed Biscll tonight, but there's something that's beyond that voice. There's something even beyond the service tonight say, you know, something is moving within my heart. It is something more than just a sermon, more than just Wednesday night. Then that identifies him going with you. and to know that he's among us and can reach up and realize now he says now it's identification of Christ among his people God working in human flesh &gt;&gt; God was working through that prophet's flesh &gt;&gt; he said you remember now he's going back oh my I I I hope you're able to stay with me just a few more minutes Now he goes back to his prophecy. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now remember it. It didn't go to Babylon and it didn't go to Sodom." So he's immediately back to the three messengers. &gt;&gt; He goes back to the three messengers and immediately identifies that he didn't go to Sodom. &gt;&gt; It didn't go to Sodom. The voice you heard never went to Sodom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It stayed stayed on the other side of the desert. &gt;&gt; Stayed before Abraham and it stays tonight before Abraham's seed. &gt;&gt; Doesn't go to Sodom. Said it never went to Babylon. Glory to God. It's not down in those denominations. You won't find it in those big tombstones. You won't find it there, my brother, my sister. You will not find it there. It stayed with Abraham and his children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because you heard his voice &gt;&gt; that identifies that's your identification. &gt;&gt; You can walk out of here tonight and says, "I got my spiritual ID." What is it? He spoke to me in the way. &gt;&gt; I have my ID. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never went to Babylon. Did not go to Sodom. &gt;&gt; It was to the called out. I'm called out. &gt;&gt; Why don't you say that? I'm called out. &gt;&gt; You want to say that? Identify yourself. I am called out. And he has identified himself with me. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sister, I don't know about you, but I'm having a feast on this subject. I want to preach it with the full intended in intention of leaving out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. &gt;&gt; He says, "But this Lord Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit moving among his people doing the same thing that he did when he was here on earth identifying himself." He says it again all the way through this. Jesus Christ the same identifying himself. How do we know he's identifying himself? Because you hear his voice. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I do not know." Now he moves right up. He says, "I do not know. Only God made the promise." Now, he's he's like he's saying he's confessing, "God's sovereign. I don't know if he's going to do anything. There's a woman standing here. I don't know if he's going to do anything." Isn't that humble? Isn't that simple? Isn't that beautiful? It puts it down in all of our understanding. He's here. I I don't know if he's going to do anything. What's he saying? With as much as he knows and as many visions as he's had, he's saying to the people, "God is sovereign. I don't know if he's going to do anything. &gt;&gt; He says only God made the promise. &gt;&gt; But if he will &gt;&gt; identify himself here, &gt;&gt; if he will identify himself here, &gt;&gt; sir, we would see Jesus. And that's the only way that you, he said, you can't impersonate that &gt;&gt; cuz it's a miracle. And now here stands a woman. And I haven't a bit more idea what that woman's standing here there for, than anybody does. What is a messenger doing? He's gone through a whole long series of statements and paragraphs bringing the people so tenderly all the way up. All the way up. How will he identify? How will you know it be identified? Because he speak to you. What is he preparing them for? cuz the same son of God is going to speak out of that mouth to identify himself there on the platform. &gt;&gt; And you're a chosen elected people. You've heard his voice. You didn't have to stand on the platform. Blessed are they who believe who have not sinned. &gt;&gt; I don't know where those people are, but for the most part, they're all gone. But here you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here you are. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Here I am. I'm I'm not preaching tonight. I'm rejoicing. I'm rejoicing in my own salvation. Hallelujah. I'm rejoicing that I at family and been able to be a family in in the midst of this family as brothers and sisters have heard the same voice. I'm rejoicing. &gt;&gt; This thing's a reality to me. &gt;&gt; We're not wasting our time, friends. We're not here playing church. We're on our way to this real place. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And if he'll identify himself and he says, "Here stands a woman. I have no idea what what's wrong." Uh he says, "Standing here or that than anybody else does. And here he is to identify his church to give it rapturing faith." And here he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To identify himself. Number one. To identify himself. And number two, to give them rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They missed it. &gt;&gt; And there's a group of people that got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's identified himself. &gt;&gt; I can put you on the spot saying, "You're here, aren't you? &gt;&gt; You're here. &gt;&gt; You've driven away from home. You've driven across the land. You've come across why did you? You needed to hear this. Your body on the other side was calling for this service. You need to hear these things. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is bringing it to you cuz the body is calling for it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Rapturing faith. Why do he identify himself? To give you rapturing faith and that faith of revelation. &gt;&gt; And the lady, he said he's the lady's just come from an operation. Said, "I don't know if he's going to do anything. He's sovereign. &gt;&gt; But if he will, he'll be identifying himself. Identifying himself for the purpose of letting you know that he's going to speak to you. And number two, that you're your He's going to give you rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; And he said, "She's here. The lady's just come from an operation." That is right. A female trouble and you've had an operation and you're suffering from a real weakness and nervousness. That is right. Can't hardly recover from it. And tonight before coming, you prayed that you would be able to get here and be prayed for in a prayer line. Brother Phantom is so specific. Other times he says, "I hear you praying and you prayed that I would call you." &gt;&gt; This time he said, he even named her prayer. He said, "You prayed that you'd get in the prayer line." And she's standing there as the first person in the prayer line. He said, "Raise up your hand. I'm not reading your mind. You'll believe with all your heart, Mrs. Gideon. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; What have they just seen? They've seen the rapture sign. They've heard the rapture voice from the rapture prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they didn't catch the sign. They thought it was a little gift. But I can tell you our type Ruth, she wasn't excited about the gifts. Rebecca wasn't excited about the gifts. Rebecca said, "Just give me Isaac." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ruth was just saying, "Just redeem me. Just redeem me. Hallelujah. I'm not interested in the field. I'm not interested in the barley. Just redeem me." That's our type. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's our identification in the Old Testament. It's all over the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; I don't feel like quitting. I don't feel like going on. So, I'll just quit. I think what I'll do. Maybe we'll save a little bit for Sunday. &gt;&gt; It's all right to fill in some blanks, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You like those blanks? Ah, hallelujah. It's our subject, friends. &gt;&gt; It's our life. We've got a baptism. And the baptism is this young one's going to be identified with him in his death. &gt;&gt; And when she comes out of the water, she'll be saying, "I'm identified in his resurrection." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I believe as God seals her into the kingdom of God, she'll be identified in the res in the rapture as well, walking with the saints in white. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Derry, come and help me with a song. My voice about gone. Let's have the sister go and get ready for baptism for the Tom. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we just uh I don't know. Things are just building up. We just got a phone call today from uh oh, brother Marcus, sister Anne's dad from New Zealand. Greetings to the congregation. A special love to you, Sister Anne and Brother Marcus. And uh he's going to be arriving the 29th and uh I don't know what you've got planned as a family, but I'll announce publicly I've got him slated for one of the weekends. He said, "Whatever whatever is planned for me, but oh, I love hearing Brother Donaldson minister. &gt;&gt; He just got a fire down within his bones. It's just so rich and wonderful. He got a man of prayer. I really love him." Amen. Well, let's sing a song. Brother Derek, you can come up here. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? Will you pray for Sunday? &gt;&gt; We need all the prayers we can have. God bless you. I've been changed. [Music] I've been changed. I've been reborn. All my life has been rearranged for what it made his way. All my life, praise God, has been changed. And I've been to the water and I've been I've been washed in the blood of the lamb. I've been changed from this creature that I once love and redeemed is now my name. I can change. I will be all my life and me. [Music] Oh, what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way. All my life. Praise God. As we change my sins as far, they're white as snow. I was found, but today I am free. I was lost in darkness, but now I found. I was blind, but now I see. I can change. I will be all my life and give me way. Oh my god. [Applause] [Music] And when at last in his presence I stand above. Oh, he will wipe everything from my eyes. And I'll thank him for living like me. I belong. Oh, I've been changed and I've been reborn. All my life has been re [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh yes, I [Music] again all my life [Applause] [Music] praise when the Lord has his way. All my life praise God. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand like [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Once you hear that call, you can make your mind up. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got my mind made up. &gt;&gt; My heart is set right. &gt;&gt; We'll start with the first verse. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that save a rest like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. And I've got my mind. And I've got my heart. Oh yes, I'm going with Jesus all the way. So I've got my mind made up. I've got my fix right. I'm going with Jesus all the way. Now when we've been there 10,000 years God shining as the sun wave no last name to sing God's praise and we bless thee and I've got my and I've got my fish right I'm Going with Jesus. I'm going all the way. I've got my mind made up and I've got my space right. I'm going with Jesus all the way. Am I a soldier of the cross? A follower of the lamb. shall I to hold his arms or blush his [Music] [Applause] [Music] heart. I'm going with Jesus all the way. I've got my mind. [Music] I'm going with Jesus all the way. A star he carried to the sky for a flower made of other [Music] bloody se. I've got my and I've got my [Applause] I'm going with Jesus all the way. I've got my mind made up. I've got my heart. I'm going with Jesus all the way. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats, Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; Very appropriate, &gt;&gt; Sister Haley. I've got my mind made up. I've got my heart set right. What a time to be going into camp. If God's doing this before camp, &gt;&gt; what is he going to do after camp? Praise the Lord. God's in the saving business, isn't he? &gt;&gt; You know the wonderful thing about this identification with the road to Emmas, the Bible says, "And their eyes were open. and they knew him. &gt;&gt; So if the resurrection has come by your way then our eyes need to be open. &gt;&gt; And you know many times we we are expecting a great move and the great move is a soul. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram talked about the campaign going to Chicago. We preached over the years a great campaign will take place. A great revival will take place &gt;&gt; and they were expecting great numbers. And brother Bram said the revival took place when that little girl came &gt;&gt; and gave her heart to the Lord. I believe we're in a revival of the opening of the word. The rapture is on us and God is opening eyes of his elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sister Haley Mat is here in the baptismal tank with me this evening because God's open her eyes. Many young people come to church, young people, old people alike come to church, but if your eyes aren't open, you don't get identified with this death, burial, and resurrection. But once God opens your eyes, you can't keep a person from being identified with his death, burial, and resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what's wonderful. And then you got a a mother &gt;&gt; hear a preacher preach, confess it, speak it, speak it again, and speak it again. What' she speak? She said, "Lord, the salvation of my daughter." &gt;&gt; And that night, little Haley gave her heart to the Lord. It's a wonderful thing. &gt;&gt; And God is dealing mightily. And I I love what brother John the Baptist had said. He said, "I can indeed baptize you with water, &gt;&gt; but there's one coming &gt;&gt; that will baptize you, Sister Haley, with the Holy Ghost and fire." And may that be your portion as you surrender your life to Christ. Maybe you'd like to say something for the Lord, sister. You know, my she was when we came in. All right, let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, you're doing something very special within the church of the living God. Lord, it's a great thing to see our children come to the realization of Jesus Christ as their savior. And Lord Haley has come to that place not only to identify Lord God in the salvation of her soul, taking a hold of Calvary, taking a hold of the cross. She wants to be identified in your death, Lord, to be identified in your resurrection. So, Father, I'm praying that you will take this little vessel, Lord, one that you've chosen before the foundation of the world. God, would you indeed baptize her with the Holy Ghost and fire? Lord God, I pray that you'll set her soul a flame, that she will know you in a greater way, Lord, that she will become into relationship with the living God. Fill her &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; is my prayer tonight. Father in Jesus name and sister Haley, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your savior, I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand if we can. We'll sing one more chorus as we close. I'll ask brother DDA to come and dismiss us in a word of prayer. I'm not ashamed of the gospel. &gt;&gt; The gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm not ashamed of the gospel. The gospel of Jesus Christ. [Music] I'm not afraid to mountain, but I'm willing to hear. [Music] See, I'm ready to be all he wants me to be after. Oh, I am thou shame of the goel. [Music] Father, we're thankful tonight. Our hearts truly rejoice, too. hear your word and feel the Holy Spirit pressing this revelation into our hearts, oh God, Father, to see and to know that we are the substance of all the shadows. And we can look back in your word and see that you wrote it with us in mind, Father. Lord, tonight we do want to thank you for speaking to our hearts once again, Father. We believe that your word is that seed that has fallen into a good ground tonight that it'll bring forth a revelation. Oh God, it'll bring forth a closeness, a walk with you, God. I pray that your children will be encouraged and strengthened. That they'll go, God, with this atmosphere that we have sensed and felt tonight, they will take it with us, Father, knowing that you have drawn near to walk with us all the way to the end. Walk with us, Jesus. As we come to the end of the service, we commit every life into your hand. Your servant was preached and labored, oh God. Strengthen him, renew him for Sunday, Father, and every heart, oh God, as we look toward this week of camp. We just pray that you'll work every detail, Father, that all will be according to your perfect will. We commit all lives to you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you go. Sunday, one service, Sunday morning, camp starts. Sunday afternoon, come prayed up. Amen. If you haven't paid for camp, make sure that you swing by the office quickly on your way out. Take care of those arrangements. God bless you. Meditate on these things. Speak often on these things that we have heard. Keep it in the forefront of your mind. If it's being preached, we need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. See you on Sunday. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
