TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] You love the Lord. This morning, Ann and I were talking uh this morning about a school teacher she had and uh you know, he said, "You should be able to sing like no one's like no one's watching. You should work like you don't need the money, right? I want you to stand this morning and I want you to sing. I want you to praise the Lord." You say, "Well, Brother Rod, somebody's standing beside me, you know." Oh, well, close your eyes. &gt;&gt; You know, I had a I had a big win this week.

Brother John King is requesting prayer for Preston this morning. Uh he woke with 102° temperature this morning and just desiring that God would touch him and heal him. I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's, brother John, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. How many others have a need this morning? They want to be remembered before the Lord. And if you're listening in on the internet this morning, you've got a need, you just uh take it before the Lord as we go to prayer with John. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, if we can worship you in a free spirit, surely we ought to be able to open up our mouths and pray to you in a free spirit, Lord. Like no one else is in the room, like it's just you and us alone. Lord, we've come here to worship you today. Lord, we're stepping outside of our own feelings, outside of our own situations, outside of whether we're male or female, bond or free, whatever skin color we have, whatever family strains we have, whatever national spirit we're from. Lord, we are one family. We are one body. We are one people. Lord, we want our voices to come into your presence this morning. We want to walk with you this morning, oh Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be your holy name. We lift up our hands. We lift up our hearts. We lift up our voices. King of kings, Lord of Lords. Oh Jesus, you're worthy of our praise. You're worthy of our adoration. You're worthy, worthy, worthy. We thank you, Lord Jesus. Our hearts are overflowing with gratefulness, Father. Hearts are overflowing with your grace. Our hearts are overflowing with your mercy. Hearts are overflowing with lives that have been healed. Lives that have been touched. Lives that have been delivered. Lives that were bound that have been set free. What else can we do but cry holy, holy, holy, holy. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we love you this morning. We thank you for the testimonies, Lord. When your presence comes, when you come, &gt;&gt; the tempter's power is broken. [Music] When those virtues, Lord, coming from your back begin to come into a life, sickness has to leave. Cancer has to leave. Things that are wrong begin to be made right. Just in a moment, a light is turned on in a situation. We believe that sen has come in this hour. As we sang the opening song, Melzdc has come. Told us things that were, things that are, things that are to be. That is why we can rejoice. That is why in this season, our hearts are full of your presence and your spirit is &gt;&gt; bringing new creations. It's bursting out like a Roman candle. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful we can gather around the table. Gather around the presence of God like this in freedom, Lord. in worship and thanksgiving, God in a liberty and a spirit, Lord, with brothers and sisters that have made heaven their goal, that have made that eternal body part of their inheritance. We're so thankful there's men and women that's given up houses and lands and said no to the things of this world that we can come together like this our little licks of fire like they had in the upper room like your prophet spoke about a people and begin to recognize who they are that they would rise up a mighty army. God, we're standing at attention this morning. the great general has brought us together for this kind of a gathering, for this type of a meeting. And God, we believe in miracles. We believe that you're changing lives. We believe that you're healing sick. Lord, we believe that you're able to deliver and fill us with your spirit again and again and again and again. Father, may this meeting this morning, this afternoon be hallowed to you, God, as you come down and suck with us and walk with us. Let there be communion at the table, stimulation flowing, that when we hear truth, Lord, that we can get so under the impact of it, it can possess us. Lord, we be caught away into those heavenly places. Lord, there's needs among us. You brought our sister Judy back. You've touched our sister snow. For this, we're grateful. There's others that are here, God, even through the days as we receive the calls and there's miracles happening one right after the other. We give you glory for that, Lord. And mercies are new every morning. We're here to tap into some mercies, God. We're here to tap into some healings. We're here to tap into your presence, taking out the starch and taking out the us. That Jesus would step inside of this room. this morning. Jesus would flow through our lives. That Jesus would get a hold of us. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just love you, God. &gt;&gt; Our sister's relative needs a a new birth. Lord, she's going through this situation. Pray that you'd come on the scene in her life as you did for so many. you're able to do again and again. Unspoken requests, those that are written in, those that are standing, some have their hands lifted up. Some are putting their hands over on the telephone or in the computer. Lord, they're connected with us. God, we just believe at any moment we could step into that other body, that other dimensions blending in so closely when our pastor steps behind the sacred desk. May the pillar of fire be so present that our names would be spoken. You know our needs. You are know our names, our addresses. Let us begin this service under the realization that you know all things. And the one that's speaking to us, the one that's breaking the bread, the one that's opening our hearts is the Lord Jesus Christ. Nothing's hidden this morning. Nothing's covered. We just want you to have your way and be pleased. There's been an expectation about this day, Lord. I don't know why in our own hearts, but we we're looking forward to this day, God. Something's going to happen today. We've just sensed it in the our expectation, Lord. There's going to be a move of God here. There's going to be divine things happen during the services today. Our pastor and brother Tom this afternoon, something divine is happening. God, we're taking another step, Lord. We're moving into a higher realm. We're believing for the impossible. May Satan be defeated. May the works of darkness be crushed. Let the King of glory come riding in and wave upon wave upon wave of your glory, oh God. That you would be glorified among us. That you would be pleased that we would stand back, Lord, and be under the impact of the presence of Jesus Christ. We give you your rightful place, first place today in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. [Music] Our sister Elizabeth Neighbor is going to come and bless us with a song. Sister Elizabeth, if you'd come at this time. U we've got an announcement and then Brother Tom's going to come with announcement just before Sister Elizabeth sings. Uh the young people's meeting this Friday. Uh remember Friday night 7:30 um here at the church December 9th uh brother Wes Ardel is going to be speaking and I know uh and let's be praying for it. I know um everyone's going to be really looking forward to what brother Wes has to said to say. Amen. Brother Tom, well I guess for the young people this is announcement for them. It's official. Lord willing, if we're still here, we're going to have a winter camp and that will be on February the 17th, 18th, and 19th, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And uh God's done some great things for us to make this uh available at this time. And you know, we've been wanting over the years to have a a winter camp just to continue what the Lord's doing at the summer camp. and it just hasn't never fit in, never worked, never really opened up to us until this year. And um we've uh uh the church now has a couple of old buses that we're using, one for the school and and that's going to be available. So we'll be able to transport about 100 children up to the camp. So we don't have 100 families taking the young people up. So um we'll be getting together with some of the people that we'll be uh needing to make this camp possible. And so be praying that God will just continue, as brother John is saying, wave after wave of his presence. And it's tremendous uh time for us and I'm looking forward to it. So God bless you. It's February 17th, 18th, and 19th. [Music] All I've heard about heaven [Music] makes me want to go. The more ties that I have there, friends and love ones who've gone on makes it harder to be [Music] in a world that's just passing by. [Music] With all its troules and cares that here seems so great when compared to my future home. There's nothing here holding me. I'm getting lonely for home. &gt;&gt; I'm so lonely for home. &gt;&gt; My eyes are aching to see &gt;&gt; the glory that awakes me. &gt;&gt; My bridegroom is here. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is here. &gt;&gt; And I know he longs too. Yes, he is longing for that fellowship we had before. When morning stars shouted for joy, I'm being called back. [Music] I'm going home. [Music] [Music] When a saint passes on, how it saddens our hearts for We still here. Feel the pain. Know the loss of one we have lost. But now imagine heaven. All the shouts of rejoicing that one has come home. It was one short breath, one small step that took them there. There's nothing on earth can be put to the test. No pleasure these mortal lives know to outweigh the bliss and the freom of soul that we the redeemed will soon know. Getting lonely for home. I'm so lonely for home. My eyes are aching to see the glory that awaits me. My bridegroom me is here. I feel him here. And I know he longs too. Yes, he is longing for that fellowship we had before. When morning stars shouted for joy, I'm being called back. [Music] I'm going home for that fellowship we had before. And morning stars we all shouted for joy. I'm being called back. [Music] I'm going home. [Music] Amen. Thanks, sisters. You headed for home. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's uh we're going to be turning to the word now as brother Biscll's coming. He knows my name. John Andy's while he was praying that he knows your name. He knows your address. you know, and you might not think, well, you know, of course he's gone, but you know, if you're if you're walking down the street, you know, and and uh you know, somebody important went by, you know, and say it was the president of the United States and he looked over and he said said, "Hey, there's Randy Snow." Says, "I know him." And he calls you, you know, "Hey, Randy, come over here. I want to talk to you." You know, I know Randy would go, "Hey, I'm president." You know, me and him are friends. You know, he knows me. Or if the prime minister said, "Aaron Hardy, how are you doing?" He says, "You you know my name." You know, God knows everything about you. Man, he loves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He came and walked this earth and died for you, man. That you could have redemption this morning. Let's sing it as brother Eis comes. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I have a maker [Music] before my heart and before even time began my life. [Music] He knows my name. He knows my everyone [Music] and I have a father. He calls me his home. Oh, and he [Music] no matter where I go and he [Music] Heat. Heat. He know my name [Music] my voice. I sing the first verse again. Oh, I have a and before my heart and before even time began my life in his Hey [Applause] everyone and he wait. Thank you Jesus. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, he call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daddy hears us when we call. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're happy indeed to be here again this morning. to bring the word. We're going to just have a few comments before we turn to the scriptures and we just want to maintain this spirit of worship. Amen. I believe that is the spirit that the that God loves. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; God loves that spirit of worship? He loves when we are just quietened our spirits and we forget all about yesterday and forget about tomorrow. Forget about everything. &gt;&gt; Forget about everything. There's only one thing we're thinking of and that's him. &gt;&gt; How wonderful he is. Wonderful Lord of compassion. We are so grateful to what we are seeing God doing from day to day. And uh I believe in another week or so we're going to have uh one of the pastors from Brazil is coming through. I don't know just what day. Do we know brother Tony what day he's arriving? &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; Friday. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh be about another week and he'll be here with us. There's two or three brothers I believe coming. This was the first uh first church I was in in Brazil. And this is the brother that has had such a burden for the people of uh Mosmbique. He made many journeys to Mosmb beek. Mosmbique and Brazil speak the same language. also Angola. And he was so burdened because he would go there, little groups would spring up and there was nothing to leave them, no books to leave them. And he was so burdened over that. And from that time to this, I would say because largely because of his burden, I became burdened and immediately thought, well, you know, there's brother Dioa doing printing right in Africa. that shouldn't be a problem to get those books down there. The whole thing was to get coordinated and get the get the messages translated, the translated messages over to brother Dioa for the printing. And it just took some coordination. And brother Tony has been working very very hard over these this last year. And we can say when brother Dioa was here, he told me that they had now printed 26 26 messages in uh in the Portuguese language. and how how thankful we are to have been able to play a part in getting those messages. If you know I I stress that because I don't know I cannot tell what the message means to you but I know what it means to me. It's not just a title. It's not just a way of belief. It's not only just a few few loose ends that have been tied together, but to me it is a revelation of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And it's a lifechanging life transforming word. And if we really believe that, then we feel that everybody ought to have an opportunity either to accept it or to reject it. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I certainly do. I know what it means to me. I know what it's done for me. I know what it's done for my family. I know what it's done for many of you. And I see what you have been. I see what you are today. And I can tell you it's not the not this building that did it. It's not the name Cloverdale Bible Way that did it. It's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. But he had to be made known to you. Amen. And so we're we're so thankful. We are we're just so grateful that God is in the healing business. He's in the restoring business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan's in the tearing down business. He's in the destroying business, but we're in the building business. &gt;&gt; And I'm happy to say to the congregation today, we have our brother Joey Wartz and his wife, Sister Stephanie, in a congregation with us. Uh, brother Joey wanted to uh he wanted to contact me and God was doing something supernatural. You know, God works on both ends. &gt;&gt; Uh, one week ago yesterday, I called a I called a brother I called brother Daryl Hoffer uh brother Joey's brother-in-law and I said, "I want Brother Joey's telephone number. Give me his cell number." So he gave me his cell number. I was very busy on sat on on the very next uh one of the next meetings. Then I hadn't had a chance to phone him, but the next meeting I was just in the office. The door was open and brother Daryl was just going by and uh uh I I just kind of waved at him to let him know that I thanked him. I want to thank him for giving me brother Joey's phone number and uh he said, "Well, Sister Stephanie's here." And then just at that moment, she walked by the open door. And so I just waved in motion to her and I said, "I've just I've had brother Joey on my heart and I have gotten his phone number and I'm going to be calling him." She said, "He spoke to me just before I came out the door to go to church and said, tell brother Biscll I'd like to speak to him." I'm glad when God works on both ends. And we got together and spent a two two and a half hours together or so and had a time of prayer and uh uh repentance before God. And I want to let the congregation know that the scripture is true that the goodness of God leadth thee to repentance. That was one of the scriptures that God gave me to give our brother Joey. And he has with all sincerity uh made his life right between he and his wife and he and God. And uh I want the congregation to know that so that uh when a brother's restored, I believe that that's a full restoration. And we are in the restoring business. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's in the building business and he's in the healing business. And when I see homes that are tore apart, I like to see God come on the scene and heal them up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in that. &gt;&gt; I believe that cuz that's what I that's what the scripture teaches. We just believe it. And so we're so thankful and happy to have brother Joey and sister Stephanie in the in the service this morning. I'd like to have you stand and sing with me. He's the great emancipator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, folks. I don't know if you're going to rejoice this morning, but I'm going to &gt;&gt; going to rejoice in our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. [Music] My heart and soul unfair. [Applause] Set me free. Oh glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. He me and the song [Music] and my meat. Oh, the singing she might Please the song of the [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That song was a favorite of our brother Amy Mulan who's gone on. I wonder if he was joining with us on the other side. Maybe some of the saints could just lean over the balcony and say, "My, how good it is to hear them sing that." Uh, join in with them. Oh, glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. We lift it up. the song of the redeemed, gracious and loving heavenly father, we have sung the songs of Zion and we have prayed. We have lifted up our voices to you in worship and adoration. And this morning, Lord, we are not here to put in idle time. We're here to serve you. We are here to serve one another. We thank you for every person that's within the building, Lord, wherever they may be. And for those that are uh streaming the service, I pray, oh God, that you'll come into the room where they're at. And may the same atmosphere and the same power and presence of the Holy Spirit be their portion. Come and illuminate us. I pray. I pray that you will invigorate us with the energy of the Holy Ghost. I ask that you will anoint me, oh God, how I sense now your presence and nearness here. I pray, Father, that you will be glorified. Let your name be lifted up amongst the people. And when this people leave this building, I pray they will be at another plane, Lord, another spiritual level. I pray, Father, when they go out from this building, the glory of God, Shikina will be upon their face. I ask, Lord, you'll bless the saints everywhere. And now, anoint us for service and the people to hear in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Take your Bibles if you would please and turn to Matthew's Gospel the first chapter. We're going to read from verse 18. And this certainly has really nothing. My message has nothing to do with the season that we're in, even though the text looks that way. Now, the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when, as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. And then Joseph, her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privy. And while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was one of the great scriptures that the prophet of God used. Uh with those that believe in a trinity you get here that knocks it in the head. You've got the third person conceiving the second person. &gt;&gt; Then who was his father? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God himself was his father. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and he shall and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. You may be seated. I'm carrying on actually from the last week or two just kind of tying into part of the subject I want to speak on. called by our new name to this morning and uh there's so much that can be said but I want to make as much headway as I can. Now the scripture which we have just concluded with says and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus. I want you to notice that very important word for. for he shall uh for he shall save his people from their sins. His name will be Jesus because he's going to save his people from their sins. His name will be called Jesus for this is what he's going to do. What he's going to do and what his name is are synonymous. They are one and the same. As I said last Sunday, the nature and the name in the Bible are to correspond. That's what it's all about. Now, we all have names and when we were born, our parents gave us a a name and it's called a given name. That's our given name. When you fill out a form, you'll have a place that it'll say given name, and that will be your first or second name or third name, whatever. And then you have a family name, which will identify you with a family unit here on earth. And those are the names. And as it is uh was said in the Bible encyclopedia that the names that we have uh in the in our western culture really is nothing more than uh a name. It's just a it's an identification tag. Often it doesn't have a lot of meaning. You don't have to go back very very many uh generations before you find that. and and and some today also. But they had names had a a deeper meaning. They called people uh by a name because uh uh well, brother Southwick for example. Uh brother Southwick's he was H. Harvey Dawson Southwick because he was born up at Dawson Creek in that area. So they gave they always identified something. And then another one of his brothers was born right uh on uh Charlie Lake. So they called him Lake Southwick. And you know they have some kind of identification with their birth. Uh in the Bible we find if I should say to you for example if I say to you birthright who do you think of? &gt;&gt; Jacob. We think of Jacob. Soon as we say birthright, we think of Jacob because the birthright meant everything to him. He couldn't get that out of his mind. Brother Brandham said that birthright, even though he was a shyer, even though he was a deceiver, even though he would supplant his brother, even though he would be the kind of person he was, deep within him was the that absolute yearning. It wasn't just a desire. It was an obsession. &gt;&gt; He had to have the birthright &gt;&gt; and that is synonymous with his name. &gt;&gt; Birthright and Jacob are synonymous. But because of that which was in him, God had to change his name because Jacob would not fit what his future life was to be lived out. The future life that he was to be lived out. So I want to just suggest to you at the beginning of the service today and to all that are hearing me or ever will hear that your given name is so we can communicate and you can hear it called and answer it and and hopefully get to the dinner table on time or whatever more you need to do. And your family name has identified you with a genealogy in this life in this mortal life. But neither of those names really have any great significance with eternal things. Uh I believe that something within you deep deep within every being I'm talking about son and daughter of God. Now that thing that was in Jacob, wherever it was, could not be identified probably by its location, no medical doctor, physician could find that. No, no scientist could discover where that was. But somewhere within the inner regions of him was something that was very specific. He knew it was birthright. He knew that there was something that he had to lay hold of. It was something he was prepared to give up reputation for. It was something he was prepared to risk his life for and something that he was prepared to uh uh be the object of all of his brother's hatred to the point of wanting to destroy him. He was prepared to do all of that. So you can't say it was just some kind of nebulous thing that was in him. It was very specific. I would say that in itself was really his true name. &gt;&gt; That in itself because that was the life that he wanted to live. &gt;&gt; That was what he wanted to do. He wanted to do anything to get that. And it's written in the scripture. It's written in this Bible. Those things were eternal which was in him. That's why it's in the eternal word of God. And so I will say to you that that spiritual uh spiritual element, that spiritual characteristic, that spiritual thing which God has planted in us, we call it a seed. uh the seed of God. We we can give it different terminology, but without even being able to describe it fully, that thing which God put in us from the beginning, which God ordained would be in us. When God called us, that's what he was calling to. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he called us, he very few people I suppose some have heard their their natural name called uh Moses did. God said to Moses, "Moses, Moses." He called Samuel, "Samuel, Samuel." Three times he has used that name. But when he spoke to Abraham, Abram rather before his name was changed to Abraham. The Bible just says and didn't even say it called him by name. It just said that and God spoke to Abram. Well, how did he speak to him? How does he speak to you? How does he speak to me? He doesn't need to call our name. But he the spirit of God begins to respond to something that is deep within us. And we hear that voice and we feel that pull because it is our real self. It is the real person, the real you. And many times the uh the outer shell and the and the man or woman that you are is at war with that or at least it appears to be at war. It's in conflict with it. The flesh is weak and the flesh, Satan uses the flesh and uses this physical mortal life. He uses every kind of thing he can to to uh suppress that and to push it down, but yet it won't be pushed down. It is the lily at the bottom of the pond. It is the grass that's under the cement block. It's going to come out somehow because the sun is drawing it out to life. It can't be. It can't be suppressed forever. It's going to come out. It's going to do what God has called it to do. We're going to be what he wants us to be. Amen. And that is your real name. That's when God was is calling you. That's what he calls to. And you hear it. &gt;&gt; I hear the call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins. In the Philadelphiaian church age, prophet says, "And I will write," he's referring to this, "and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God." And what is the name of God? Well, he was God with us or Emanuel, but that was not his given name. Thou shalt call his name Jesus. So now that was his given name. Thou shalt call his name Jesus. Jesus said, I am come in my father's name and you receive me not. Therefore, the name of God is Jesus. For that is the name he came in. He is Lord Jesus Christ. And what name does a woman take when she marries the man? She takes his name. It will be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her to himself. That is why we are presently called the bride. He has taken us to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Revelation 21:9, it says, "And there came unto me one of the seven angels, which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come Heather, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife." Now, thou shalt the the the Lamb, thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. And I could say today without adding anything to the scripture, and she shall be called his bride or the lamb's wife, for she shall be his wife. &gt;&gt; For she shall do a certain thing. She shall live a certain life. She shall be a certain kind of a person, a people, a church. Revelation 2 and 17, he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the hidden mana and will give him a white stone. We spoke on it last week some. And in the stone, not on the stone, but in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. And brother Brandham made a point on that. No one knows it, but you know it. You know, the kind of life, the kind of desire, the kind of the way that God speaks to you. And God speaks to all of us differently. We're all unique individuals. God speaks to you in a way he doesn't speak to me. Speaks to me in a way he doesn't speak to you. But he speaks to us as we need to be spoken to. You believe that? &gt;&gt; And what God is responding to is not this outer man. This older man will be affected. But he is speaking to that eternal thing that he put in you in the beginning or from the beginning or before the beginning. That is that eternal part. I really need to turn you around and and have you focus on that. And that is going to be essentially the service this morning. So you can see that it's it's not know what we're called on here in life. And you're you you write your name every week many times, no doubt. And we're signing it all the time and identifying ourselves in this life. Surely it's incumbent upon us to come into the house of God and realize that we're not just, you know, an individual uh a number, a statistic of humanity crawling over the face of the earth, but we are a being that God has placed here. And we and God placed us here with a specific nature and character which is in his seed. And that is what makes us real sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; So we have our name, our given name, our family name. But because as sons and daughters of God, we have a seed within us that has a certain nature that is going to live out a certain life, certain characteristics which we did not inherit from mother and father. So it's not by our family name. Has nothing to do with our family name. And it has nothing to do with our given name. It is a certain character, a certain thing that we're going to exhibit. we're going to express in this life. And that is God's nature. That is of God. It is that divine part. And a lot of people want to they they want to do away with that. Say, "Well, that is cultish or that is some heresy that we believe there can be anything divine." I tell you what, if that seed within us isn't divine, we haven't got eternal life. &gt;&gt; We have eternal life by virtue of that. And that's the thing that calls out to father. And that's that's what father responds to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is really our new name. And I'm not saying that's all there is to it. By far far be it from so I'm just referring to that is that's really the person that you are. In other words, the new man. The new man. We are new creatures in Christ Jesus. Your earthly name doesn't fit that new man. doesn't fit his nature, doesn't fit what he's called to. In Revelation 3 and 12, it also says, "Him that overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the temple of God, and he shall go no more out. I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from God, and I will write upon him my new name. Now, just quickly, uh, I'm just going to give these references. You don't have to turn to them because I'm I'm moving real quickly. in Genesis 17:5 says, "Neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram, but thy name shall be called Abraham." For once again, you find the same thing. It doesn't just end. Neither will your name be Abram anymore. It'll be Abraham. Could have been the end. But that wasn't the end of the sentence. You'll be called Abraham. For a father of many nations have I made you. You wouldn't have Abraham if it wasn't for the rest of it. The rest of it is inseparable from the change of the name. You will be Abraham, for you're going to be a father of many nations. in Genesis 13-28. And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for a prince hast thou, as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." You will be called Israel now for because there's something else that is being expressed in you that you didn't have before. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 3 and 20, and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living. That's why she was called Eve. Eve just wasn't a given name because Adam thought, well, I call my wife. No, he was called Eve because she was a mother. You've been called I've been called Edward. That's where it ends. I don't know why they called me Edward. It didn't say, "Well, we're going to call you Edward." Because they probably didn't have a clue what it was. If Well, maybe there's somebody way back in the family has been named that. I don't know. And there are there are names that uh have been given even family families who have given their children names and then they felt that their name was disgraced. So they wanted to get rid of that uh child and there's a a spot or two on earth where they sent them away. The aristocracy of Europe sent their bad boys, their sons to a place called the aisle of man and they were called remittance men because they just said, "Hey, you know, get out of our life. Get out of our home. You are a disgrace to the family." and we'll just go over there and we'll just pay you to stay there. And they paid remittance and had them paid to stay there. And that that's that's where the aisle of man have their background. And that's where my wife is from. I've always told her, don't go, whatever you do, don't go too far back in your history. you know, she went over there and with her mother and looked at a bunch of the tombstones and found the names of of her grandparents and etc. or family name on down, but we're not bothering to trace down our roots. &gt;&gt; The only roots we're interested in are on the other side. That's the roots we're interested in. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there were those that were wanted to eradicate, get rid of these people because they're shaming our good name. A good name in this world is is something to be desired. I think that that we should. But on the other hand, uh what the the biblical understanding and the biblical teaching of it is has nothing to do with the way we understand it now. And I I just I'm excited. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Romans, it says, "For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren." And moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. This is where I started last Sunday. Them he also called. And this call was different from a call two verses further up in the scripture. But I just want to focus on this one. This them who who he did predestinate them he also called. And this is a loud call. This isn't just you know by the way if you want to I'd like to get your attention for a moment but this is a loud call. It is to utter in a loud voice. It has the uh the the uh thought of an invitation, but it also is to call you by name. And so whatever this call is, &gt;&gt; whatever this call is, and I'm sure you didn't hear Bill, Harry, E, you know, Ed, Susie, whatever more, Joel, so on. That isn't what you heard. You heard something when this call that came from the predestinated plan of Almighty God. When it came to your ear, it wasn't even the eard drum. It went immediately down to the very regions of the soul and you heard something that was so specific to you, you looked around and wondered, "Who told that preacher about me? Who told him what I'm thinking? Who told him what I experienced today?" That is so specific. It's because your father in heaven who know knows you from the beginning. He called you by your real name. Hallelujah. And you were trembling at it. It it was so revealing how this God how and then you thought maybe the person We've had it here all the time. We've had it here all the time. People thinking, well, you must have been in the car as we drove to church. You must have been around the table last night as we were talking in around dinner table. Uh uh did you talk to this brother or that brother? I just finished talking to them. I poured out my whole heart about those things and then you come and preached it. We had questions and you took the very question and gave the answer. Or did you speak to the visiting minister? Sometimes they think I spoke to the visiting minister. I never talked to a visiting minister. They come up here and sometimes they say things about pastor. You think I put a a bug in their ear to give a plug to the pastor? Not a chance. I know better than that. I let them just come up here, let the Holy Spirit say it here. It wasn't very long ago a brother got here and he preached his whole sermon and says, "Now just a just a comment and he started started saying some things about pastor. I thought that was incredible. Just incredible the way God does things." Or someone may just throw something out. I might do it. And and here it's something that is deep down inside. What is it? It's your father &gt;&gt; calling you, speaking to you, advising you, cautioning you, guiding you. Don't we have a lovely father? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so wonderful. &gt;&gt; And so, you're being called. It's to receive a and this call is not only uh a loud call, but it's to be called by name. It's not your earthly given name. It's not your family name. It's the name that God has given you. Whatever it is and uh perhaps we say Jesus. Now Jesus to us, we all identify with it in the English language. you go to some other place, it will sound very very different because it's not just the utterance of the of the sound that we make from our mouth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; It's very different. And and those of you that speak different languages, you you can uh you you can understand what I'm saying. But when God calls, it is to call by name. Number one, it is to give a name. And we have been given a name. It's to receive the name or uh to to be called or to bear the name or a title. Now, as bride, that's a title. And as wife, it's a title. But the name I I I cannot give any pronunciation to the name because I don't have any clue what that is. But the name the deeper meaning of the name is thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from his sin. Let's say that Jesus did nothing from that time forward to save his people from their sins. If Jesus had not lived the life he lived, died the death he died and raised again from the dead, what would the name of Jesus, man? &gt;&gt; What would it what value would there be that I can say Jesus &gt;&gt; or you can say Jesus? What what good would that do you if he had not lived the life? So the important part is that the life was lived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He healed. That's Jesus. &gt;&gt; There were people who called out to him. Probably didn't even know his name. &gt;&gt; And have mercy on me, Lord. &gt;&gt; See, but he lived the life. It was the life he lived that was the real person. That was Jesus. The life that you live is the real you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the life that you live by the divine power of God, by the Holy Spirit coming to that life and coming to that seat and giving you resurrection life. That is the person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the eternal one. &gt;&gt; That's the one that'll receive athophony &gt;&gt; and go on into eternity in a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And unto the angel, Revelation 3:1, "And unto the angel of the church of Sardis in Sardis, write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars. I know thy works, that thou hast a name. I know thy works, that thou hast a name, that thou livest and art dead. You have a name that you live. But notice how closely how it is. I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest. I know thy works. That you have a name that you live. What was their name? What was God looking at as far as their name was concerned? He was looking at their works in the life that they lived. And that's why, oh my, I have to just hold myself back a wee bit. But that's why a prophet come in this generation. Now I'm just taking a quantum leap forward. Then I have to come back. So I just don't want to hold it anymore. That's why when a prophet came forward, he he he just blasted and chopped with the sharp sword of the word of God. Presbyterians or Baptist or Pentecost or Catholic. What is it? He's just hacking at those given names cuz they don't mean nothing. Just names given by men to identify people as little groups. And so he just chopped hacked at them. They don't mean a thing. And because they had these names of, oh well, I'm Presbyterian or I'm Pentecost or I'm this. They're nothing. That doesn't mean anything. That just given names has nothing to do with eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said &gt;&gt; you want to listen to birth painans. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just want to listen to birth painans. And brother Brandham lays it out for those people. And it's a big ecumenical. It is the very one where the Catholic priest came and gave him his Bible because brother Brandham couldn't find his place in that new Bible his wife had just given him for Christmas and he couldn't find his place. And Bishop Stanley came up and gave him his Bible. Here, you know, read it from my Bible. and he spoke some words to him and and brother Brandon just takes and he just dissects it all of these you know and it's so quiet it's so quiet and then says now that's right in line with my message he says now you know talking because we've come to the end time now he said read all of history you'll never find a place in history where there's been an international worldwide ministry, a messenger whose name ended with ham. Now he's actually come to a a family name. &gt;&gt; It's a very very unique thing. And he says never ended with ham. He just stops. &gt;&gt; He just silent letting them put two and two together. And then he says, "Graham, G R A H A M." And you I could just see their eyes probably just rolling in their heads. But he says, "That's only six letters." He says, "But Abraham, Ab R a H, has seven letters." He doesn't take it any further. And he talks about Elohim coming to Abraham. Abraham. Ab R A H A M. Elohim came to him in the flesh. God coming down in the flesh and saying and giving her name now and God identifying people by their name. So why did Sarah laugh? Why did Sarah laugh? And he's going through that. And then just as evidence, you want to listen to it. Get a hold of it and listen to it. It's so quiet. They're so They're hearing what they don't want to hear. &gt;&gt; But then he just ties it right into the day that we're in. And you cannot miss it. You cannot escape it. They're in the trap. And now begin to call the people out. Why was it that God was, you know, here we are in an age when name didn't mean really? Name doesn't mean a whole lot. Name means what does it mean to you? It's just your help you get through life. But you know they say that the sweetest music to a person's ear is their name. &gt;&gt; People love to hear their name. It's it's it's sweet music. Wouldn't it be terrible if you didn't have a name? You who are you? I don't know. Wouldn't that be something? Well, I want to have a driver's license. I want to have this. I want to have you. You wouldn't get along very far. Hey, I go down to the bank here every once in a while and some of these folks here from other countries, they they will appreciate what I'm saying because we know this last brother from Usbekiststan is brother Anatoli. So he said, "Well, you'll need your you'll need your passport to cash this check to open up his passport." Hey, where's Anatoli here? There's no name. That name's not here in the passport. Yeah, I know. you know, but this is my name here. Okay, I tell you what, it was a challenge. I didn't even try to say it, but we got down to the bank said, well, this this better be the name we better use then. We better stay with this passport name. Suddenly, a name becomes very very important, &gt;&gt; you know, but we all know we all know him by a certain name. That just that's just the identification tag to get along through life. And then his real name was something else. until we get there. In a lot of countries as you know they use the last name first &gt;&gt; and that's what it is in a lot of places or I won't say too many places now but a lot of place they just have one name and that's all they need exactly what the sound of your name is. I'm not worried about it. People wonder, oh I wonder when brother Brandham's going to reveal the new name of God. Well, if it was, it's probably something you can't utter anyway. And they say that even the name of God, that is why when the Jewish people write God, they G space D because nobody can say or utter. It's too holy. It's too sacred. But brother Bram says your name, that new name that you have, he says, you know it. You can't utter it, but you know, you know what's happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; and he that overcomemeth the same shall be clothed in white raignnt, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels. The Bible speaks of Judas that by transgression he fell. He said he was given a part of the apostilhip but his name what was it? He he did not live out he did not live out any life. He did not exhibit he did not express anything to do of apostilhip. His name is not in the book. And it's not just that God took an erase and says, "Well, okay, here's Judas. I'm erasing Judas's name." That wasn't it. That's why I I have a tremendous amount of uh well, fear, I guess, would be the word. When I see people that will abandon their spiritual life and not live the life of this word and other good people that has nothing to do with it. That's just the same as having just a common name. Live good people, live good life, be just common, you know, Christians and all the rest of it. We're not called to that, friends. That's why we've been given the message that we've been given. We've been given that message because that when when the Holy Spirit, if you just put this connection together, when the Holy Spirit comes upon that word, upon that word for this hour that's been given, and that word has been received into your heart, you will be another person. &gt;&gt; You cannot live the same way you lived before. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I my I have a question or two here. What does God have in mind when he refers to a new name? What does he have in mind when he speaks of the new name? That's the question. And in the Bible, we know that the people had uh names that would had such deeper significance. And uh now as I said last Sunday, a name a name represented the whole person. And I I really want to labor this. I want to stay on it because uh in our society and in our culture, it's just so completely the opposite. We don't think of people, we don't think of them in association with the with the kind of life that they are to live. It could be said that the name was the person. Now, when the Bible speaks about in in Exodus, uh I think I'm I'm just have you turn there with me for a moment. Just come to my mind just now to the 32nd uh 32nd chapter. 33rd chapter. Now before we even read this for a moment, just think Moses has now he has been he has been a shepherd in the wilderness. He's been a next to the pharaoh. He's been like a son of the pharaoh. He's run now into the wilderness. He's slaying a man, an Egyptian. He's been in the wilderness for 40 years. He's been before the pillar of fire, the burning bush. He's heard the voice of God speak directly to him. He's already been back to Pharaoh with his brother Aaron. He has brought all the plagues throughout Egypt. He has cast down his rod. It has become a serpent. He's taken it up again. It's eaten up all the other other magicians rods. He has crossed the Red Sea. He has leading. All he's seen is supernatural after supernatural. He has seen the mighty hand of Almighty God perhaps like no other person uh certainly up to that time. And Moses said in the 13th verse, "Now therefore, I pray thee," he's speaking to God, "if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way that I may know thee." Think what he's saying. That I may know thee. a man who has seen what he's seen. He but he but but is, you know, no matter how far we walk with God or what we see or what we experience with God, we recognize there's more that we don't know than we do know. &gt;&gt; And the more we come to know, the deeper it is and the more greater that it is. And he says, "That I might know thee, and that I might find grace in thy sight, and consider that this nation is thy people." And he said, God speaking back, "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest." Now this word presence, panemium, it is actually my person. I will go with you. And it's the same word for face. I will. And that is why over in revelation the the the seventh uh description of Jesus Christ that his face was as the son. That's the last one because in the message uh the last messenger is to bring us into the very presence of the person. This isn't just an anointing. Now this isn't just some happy little thing. The prophet's ministry, the purpose of his ministry was to bring the people directly into the presence of almighty God, which was the same phrase as saying face to face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you can understand, I'm not I'm not saying it too strong. I'm saying it because it's the truth. to bring a person into the presence and I'm talking about the presence of almighty God was to bring them face to face with the personal &gt;&gt; and that's what the ministry that you've been brought under is to do. That's why we don't want to live way down at some lower level. You want to go out of here today if you if you don't get anything else. Go out of these doors today and say, "God, you called me &gt;&gt; in this day. You didn't call me just to have a little better life, a little better better relationship, have a better home, have a better job. That isn't why you called me. You called me. I've heard the call. You called me by my real name. And you called me so I could be face to face with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brought into your presence. &gt;&gt; And he said, "My presence shalt go with thee and give thee rest." And he said unto him, "If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall we know? For wherein shall it be known here that that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people uh from all the people that are upon the face of the earth." Hear what he's saying. He said in this be in this kind of a presence having this kind of a relationship we will be different from all people on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will say the people of this message are different from all the people of the earth. Not because we dress different. Not because we have different names. Not because you have long hair, long skirts. Not because of anything. Not because of any works. Not because of any form of worship words we have. But it's because we have been brought into the presence of almighty God face to face. Whether we believe it or not, that doesn't change the fact. The fact is that God is in this word. &gt;&gt; God is in this message. And those that believe it and the Holy Ghost comes upon that word, they are transformed. &gt;&gt; They're called into it. They're invited into it. They have heard the call. And that call was their name. Their true name. You probably can't put any sound. You can't put any any particular sound to it because but you do know one thing. God called me. God spoke to me and I have answered that call. I'm telling you today that call was your real name. &gt;&gt; That's your real name. And your call. He called you so that because of that call, you'll be a different you'll be a different kind of a person. You'll be the expression that he desired. I called you shall be Abraham because or for a father of many nations. I'm making a father of many nations. You'll be called bride because you will live different from all other. &gt;&gt; You shall do it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It didn't say he'll earn a new name. I will give him &gt;&gt; a new name. What I'm saying to you, it isn't that he's going to give you just a certain sounding uh that you'll be called. I will give him I will give her a new life. They shall receive it. And it's already been written. It's written in a white stone. It's a revelation. And it cannot be moved. They'll never be moved from this because it's a personal revelation and no man knows it but they know it. &gt;&gt; That person knows it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is blessed friends. &gt;&gt; It's blessed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and uh down in verse 18 or we'll read verse 17. And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and I know thee by name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wasn't he was he wasn't saying I know you by Moses. I know you by name. I know what you're going to be. Hallelujah. I know you're going to be the shepherd of Israel. I know you're going to lead these people. I know you're going to be a meek man, the meakest in all the earth because I have given you a name &gt;&gt; and I know you by name. &gt;&gt; And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory. &gt;&gt; Hey, he's walked through the Red Sea on dry land. He's seen the plagues of Israel. He's seen all of these things. He's still wanting to see his glory. And God knows what he's saying. And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee. I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee." Now understand, it's not God passing by Moses and saying, "The Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord." That is what he's saying. So when we say we lift up the Lord, I lift up my hands, I I exalt your name, I'll tell you what then what comes out of our mouth has to correspond with the life that's been lived. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. If it isn't that way, then there's something that is has uh something is irreconcilable. But the name, we exalt his name. By exalting his name, it's the life that we live. Hallelujah. And we don't live at the level we'd like to live. That's the other part of it. But we live what God allows us to live. And we live simply. We live humbly. We live before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even that desire that is there to live closer to be more dedicated more consecrated to be more whatever it is I can't describe it cuz it's your desire that desire is driving you to fulfill your spiritual purpose on earth and we only have this season to do it and the devil would love to rob us by keeping us so engrossed with everything else of life. We have to do it. We have to pay our bills. We have to live. We have to And this is a tension time. It's a pressure time. We've got more to do than we have time to do. Is that not the truth? All of us do. It's a pressure time, isn't it? But that is Satan's trick also. We want to keep him in check. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to keep him in hand so we have time. Time to live out our real true life. what God has called us to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; You're called to be a farmer, a carpenter, a plumber, a drywaller, or a housewife or whatever more. All the duties that we have, we're we're called because that is the part of our call where we are uh manifesting and showing uh Christ to the world. We have to do that. That is part of our life. But this other that life is not to dominate and dictate to the other life. It is our spiritual life that's to dictate to our natural life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Show me thy glory." And he said, 'I'll make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy to on whom I will show mercy. And he said, and God speaking yet, and he said, thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live." God knew what Moses was asking. Even though all of this has happened and you've been so merciful to us, &gt;&gt; let me see your glory. &gt;&gt; Let me have I've seen all the miracles. I've seen all the supernatural and I've experienced it in my life, but let me see your glory. And at the level that Moses was speaking, God knew what he was asking. He said, "You can't see my face. &gt;&gt; My presence will go with you." In other words, we have in the Bible the the angel of the Lord, which was a very angel of his presence. And God appeared to Gideon and and to Monoah and others. He appeared as the angel of the Lord. That was the one that was God coming as close as he could come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God had come as close as he could come to Moses, but Moses wanted him to transcend even further. &gt;&gt; Let me see your glory. &gt;&gt; I want to see your face. &gt;&gt; I've heard you speak. &gt;&gt; I've heard your voice. &gt;&gt; I've done all these things and all these people. And he he was overburdened with them. I I've heard it and I've I followed it and I went out and I felt your presence and seen your miracles and I want to see you. &gt;&gt; So, you can't see my face. That's what Job wanted. He wanted to go up to like brother Brandham said, he wanted to go up to God's door and knock on his door &gt;&gt; and have God answer. And I if I could see a if I could have someone come and and speak to me and I want to see him. &gt;&gt; That's always been that's in our heart. I tell you what, friends, I I don't want this veil of flesh here forever. &gt;&gt; And when it drops, I want to be sure I enter in his presence. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, just imagine the life that he lived, the multitudes he saw healed, the names he called, supernatural that happened. And then when he sees his body sitting there in the bed 20 feet away from him and a voice is telling him and he's seeing millions and he tells me himself he says I I pinched my hand I bit my finger I I held those people friend said I held those people and he saw them in that glorious state. &gt;&gt; What come out of his mouth? &gt;&gt; I want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's still something missing. &gt;&gt; And even if we crossed over today, all of us, it would be a glorious thing. But there's something still in that seed that is not satisfied yet. I want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want to see him. I want to see that perfect manifestation of the invisible God. It's not enough. It's not enough just to have healings. It's not enough just to have miracles. It's not enough just to have a a sweep come over me and be moved of God. I want to see him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the real name of God. &gt;&gt; Who that person was &gt;&gt; and who he is. And that is why we come right down into this generation and we hear that message sometimes it comes so harsh and so cutting and in birth pains. He says he said I love people. He said I don't hate people. I love people. He said I wish I wish this message wasn't mine to give. That was William Brandham speaking. I wish this message wasn't mine to give. But he said, "I have a message from God." &gt;&gt; I have to give it. &gt;&gt; And I say to you in the name of the Lord, you have a life to live. &gt;&gt; And that life is is what God has brought put down into his seed. And from his seed, his spirit come upon that seed. Hallelujah. His word came to that seed. His word is that seed. And now you have a life to live. And you are the you are the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that is your real true name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not Cloverdale by the way. Mrs. Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God changed Jacob's name, which we know, to Israel. And then Jacob just he had this wrestling he had with a man with the angel. This what he says. And Jacob asked him and said, "Tell me, I pray thee, what is your name?" They've been wrestling all night. It's getting to the break of the day. Says, "What is your name?" And he said, "Wherefore is it that you ask me for my name?" And at that point, he asked him, "What's your name?" Oh, the way you wrestle, the way you fight, and the way, "Hey, I want to know your name." At that moment, and he blessed him there. &gt;&gt; He got to a special spot. &gt;&gt; Now, listen to one that goes the other direction. And the word of the Lord came to Hosea the prophet. And the Lord said to Hosea, "Go and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, a harlot to wife." How many people do you think of Israel understood that one? And I can say if you were living there and myself also I doubt if any of us would understand that &gt;&gt; a prophet and he takes a a woman who's a harlot to wife and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the Lord. The land and the people have departed from the Lord. And now says he wanted something living right amongst them, &gt;&gt; living out, &gt;&gt; but he wanted them with a certain name &gt;&gt; so that Israel would know what it is they were doing and God's new relationship with them would be expressed in that name. And uh and so he went and he took Goomer to wife and she conceived and bare a son. And now it wasn't wasn't Hosea and it wasn't Goomemer who said what we'll call him. And the Lord said unto him, "Call his name Jezrael." That is God sws. God sws. God is sowing a seed. Now God's going to bring something forth and call his name Jezrael for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael upon the house of Jahu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. Something's going to happen now. Something's beginning. And this is a natural conception of a natural seed. But God gave him a name because God was sewing it. And it came to pass uh that I'm sorry and she conceived again and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, call her name Lorama. Lorama, no mercy. God sws. Now this one is conceived. A daughter comes and say now no mercy. and she conceived again and bare a daughter. And God said, "Call her name Loruma and then and I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel. I will utterly uh take them away." And and when she had weaned Loruma, she conceived and bare a son. And then said, "God, call his name Lo Ami. Lo, am I not my people? For ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. So now God has, get the picture, God has in the earth, three young people, three children. Oh, the prophet Hosea has some children. Yes. This one's Jezrael. God sws. This is Lo Auma. No mercy. And this one is low army, not my people. And those children walked through life, God sws, no mercy, not my people. Not my people. Everywhere they went in life, Israel was reminded God. And Hosea says, God said, that's their name. God said it's no mercy. Not me. God said it. And God said not my people. And that's what God had. He established it in the land. And now he had lives that were being lived out. Not my people. Not my people. Not my people. Every time their name sounded, it was not my people. No mercy. No mercy. Not my people. I tell you, God emphasized. &gt;&gt; Amen. what he was saying &gt;&gt; to the people. And then quite frankly, I love this chapter. It sounds harsh, but you have to read the Bible. You have to read the scripture. And he goes on to say, "Therefore, behold, I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably to her." Now, he's already established by the names of these three children what his relationship was. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; What his relationship was with Israel. And I will and I will give her vineyards from thence and the valley of Acor for a door of hope. And she shall sing there as in the days of her youth as as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. Now God's going back to the to the great deliverance he wrought and he's bringing it forward. Even though he has delivered his message and has let them know where they are, yet he's now he's telling them that they're his people. And it shall and it shall be in that day, say the Lord, that thou shalt call me ish husband, &gt;&gt; and shalt call me no more Bali, which is my Lord. This is going to be some I'm going to do something in the land. I've let you know now that I've cut you off and I've swn this in the amongst you and I've expressed your your relationship with me. But now he goes and he says, "For I will take away the names of Bal Balum out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he goes on to say, "And I will betro thee unto me forever." Yay, I will betro thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As he said to Jeremiah, "Can a man forget his wife? I can't forget her even though I have to I have to bring judgment down. I have to say it the way it is. I have to express it." See, he couldn't get their attention. Right. &gt;&gt; So he had a prophet marry a harlot and bring forth three children of harlotry from that uh three children of whoredoms it is and God sews God was sewing something else into the land. You understand how the names have such a significance. All right. I hope that you're able to follow me. And this was this was so significant because God was uh he was establishing his relationship or what that relationship was with the people. And Monoah I just I want to take a few more minutes now. That be all right with you. And Monoah said unto the angel the unto the angel of the Lord, "What is thy name?" And when and that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do thee honor. And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why ask thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret? Or the word secret wi-i which is uh palei it is why ask my name because it is it is wonderful or it is too wonderful. Why ask my name? Because it's incomprehensible. It's extraordinary. And so it it's something that couldn't even be spoken. So why do you ask my name? And he told him and the angel of the Lord said unto him, why ask thou my name seeing it a secret? and Monoah he he had wanted to know his name. Now just to take you back for a moment now just hold this please. I'm I'm going to be a few minutes yet. We hear new things about about God in the book of in the book of Exodus because God now has at for the first time a prophet through whom he can manifest or reveal himself a part of God's expression. In other words, we see God expressing himself in just hold this please. I want you to be real alert. We hear new things and uh and things that we have not uh and thing things about God that we have not heard of before. We hear it in Exodus because because there's a prophet. So I'm saying that God can reveal himself or show who he is through a prophet which he cannot do in any other way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Right? &gt;&gt; So between Malachi and Matthew, we don't find any great expression of God because there was no prophet. &gt;&gt; You understand? All right. Now, so in Exodus, I I I I need to establish this for a very important point. In Exodus, God is speaking. He said, "I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah, was I not known to them." What's he saying? I manifested. I did certain things. I showed a certain uh characteristic of myself. I showed it to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob. And they knew me by the name of God Almighty. But by my name Jehovah was I not known. And by God Almighty. Say Shadi, which is not right. And even Shadai is not right. But I'll just say Shadai. So they knew me by Shai which is the almighty of God and that's what they knew him. L is God and Shadai is almighty. So they knew me. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew me by Shai, God Almighty. But by my name Jehovah. They knew me not. They didn't know me by Jehovah. And Jehovah is the existing one. So now God is saying to Moses, they knew me as God. El Shadai, God Almighty. They knew me as God Almighty. In other words, he's a God, but now they did not know me as a self-existing one. &gt;&gt; And I want to reveal myself now differently. But he could not do so without a prophet messenger to the people. So he had to have that prophet to reveal himself by a new name. &gt;&gt; And now I'm Jehovah, &gt;&gt; the existing one. He he was now in the process of unveiling himself to the people in a different way. And he says, "Thou shalt take," Exodus 27, "and thou shalt take the name of the Lord God. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. For the Lord will not hold him guiltless. Thou shalt not take it in vain. Or you shall not take the name upon yourself in emptiness or in falsehood or an emptiness of speech or lying. Oh, I tell you what, folks. You're quiet, but I tell you what, I feel like preaching. That is what the church world, excuse me, is full of today. Have taken the name of God in vain. It's full of emptiness. It's full of vanity. It's full of showmanship. It's full of all kinds of holy wood. It's perverted. And God has seen that. And no wonder he had to send a prophet messenger to reveal what his real name was. &gt;&gt; In the kind of life that it should be lived. &gt;&gt; This message is not just a message. This message is not just a few doctrines. This message is not a bunch of message churches. This message is a life &gt;&gt; that come from almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I said, I'm giving praise and glory to the name of God. This message is a life &gt;&gt; and you have a right to that life. &gt;&gt; And do you and I deny every devil that tries to tell you, you can't live that life. You can live the life because I can tell you right now, there's something down inside that's calling out for it. Hallelujah. That's your real name. &gt;&gt; That's your real name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's your real character. &gt;&gt; That's the real you. That's the one God knows. &gt;&gt; You can just say, "I have that desire. I have that yearning. I don't see it manifest, but I have that desire. It's down in there." I tell you that came from God. &gt;&gt; And I would encourage you this morning, deny every other restraint, every other doubt. Tell the devil he is a liar in the name of Jesus Christ. You tell him he's a liar. &gt;&gt; He'll try to tell you he won't succeed. He'll try to tell you you're going to die in the next little while. Just say irrespective of that, I'm going to give my life unreservedly to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the day that we're in. I've got to I've got to cut it short. I'm just very That's what I'm thinking about here. Just how short I'm going to cut it. Notice the angel. Exodus 23 and 20. Behold, I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him. Obey his voice. Provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel said certain phraseology or some kind of phrase to the people but the manifestation of the very life of God is in him. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; God's life would be lived through him. That is why you understand I'm I'm I I've just got to come to a certain point here. That is why you understand the prophet standing here. He wouldn't have been a prophet if he didn't act the way that he did and then he said, "I can't do anything. &gt;&gt; I can't do anything. I'm just a man. I'm your brother. I can't do anything till he comes." &gt;&gt; But when he came, the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, the name of God is in him. &gt;&gt; The manifestation of God was in him. And soon as he came, then people were called out and you've got a liver disease and you have this and you come from a certain address. Who was that? &gt;&gt; That was God himself living out his life. The angel of the Lord, his name was in him and he's speaking through the mouth of a man so that our eard drums could catch it. And you can hear it on the tape. And we're not in history. That is the message you've been born under. We've been born under a name. Hallelujah. The name of God. &gt;&gt; People can say I'm a Jehovah's Witness. Someone else can say Adonai or all these other phrases and it doesn't mean a thing. &gt;&gt; I say in the name of the Lord doesn't mean a thing. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That we can utter certain utterances. That's not what it is. It's something divine that comes from God into the individual and they walk out a transformed new creature in Christ Jesus and old things have passed away. Listen young man, it isn't something that you wrestle with today and tomorrow and tomorrow. And young ladies are living on the edge all the time. Living on the edge, a little bit of the world, a little bit of church, a little bit. It has nothing to do with that. Old things pass away. Let's say that old things pass away and behold all things become new. &gt;&gt; Why? It's a new man. &gt;&gt; It's a new woman &gt;&gt; with a new name. &gt;&gt; And you're changed. &gt;&gt; You're changed forever &gt;&gt; and ever and ever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the devil will never catch up to you. He'll never get in where you're sealed. &gt;&gt; He'd have to be born again himself and then the prophet said he'd be your brother. The devil can never get in where you're at. &gt;&gt; Don't give the devil credit for stuff he can't even do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil the devil. Who cares about the devil? He's defeated. His head is crushed. He is a helpless. He's a helpless creature. He can only do what God allows him to do &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We call that name because we know something of the power of that name. &gt;&gt; We're living the life of that name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord. Now, I want you to just get a key point and I'm going to close. the angel of the Lord in in Exodus. They didn't have it prior to that in the same fashion. But now that God had a prophet, the pillar of fire came in the first Exodus and that was and it's agreed in the uh in in the me message that brother Brandham has given that was the condescending of God and he would come thus far. So he said to Moses, "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew me as Adoni. But now I'm going to advance forward. They didn't know me as Jehovah, the self-existing one, but I want to reveal that now." Prophet said that was as condescending. He's coming down. Then he came down further. He came down condescended and came into a man &gt;&gt; that who the world will remember his birth in a few days but know nothing about his birth and they called him Jesus Christ. Jesus the invisible God in flesh &gt;&gt; and he condescended down further and even in that condescension down our hands have handled him. The prophet said, the apostle said, and uh and and we we handled him and we heard him, we saw him, and yet multitudes, most couldn't believe on him. &gt;&gt; Most rejected him, the perfect lamb of God, bearing the name that came out of the lips of an angel. Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. But it was a condescending of God. But then he says, "I have many things yet to tell you, but you can't bear them now. But when the Holy Spirit has come, he will lead you and show you into these things." And then now we come 2,000 years down the road, and there's been times of times between Malachi and Matthew, no prophet. God wasn't revealing himself at all. Then comes the Elijah spirit and John the Baptist crying out, and they knew he was a prophet from God. Then comes the Messiah right behind him and he introduces him. And then comes the apostles and the birth of the church and 2,000 years further down the road. And after 2,000 years a reformers and dark ages and all of these things that are happening and the scriptures unfolding unfolding and it come to the end time and there is a promise that'll come a messenger, &gt;&gt; a forerunner &gt;&gt; and what is it? And beside him never has happened, never has happened but in our day. &gt;&gt; And the pillar of fire, the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; is now standing beside a man &gt;&gt; and in the in birth pains he said when he was done finally done said that man with his head down you're praying. He starts telling him that boy uh uh brownskinned boy you're a Mexican and tells him your name's your daddy's a preacher and your name is Reuben. And when he's done all of that he stops says who can do that &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who can do that? &gt;&gt; I'm just a man. Who can do that? &gt;&gt; Trying to say don't be blind. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. It's God &gt;&gt; descending &gt;&gt; right here on the platform &gt;&gt; and sitting behind him and sitting all across the table city are are theologians and great wealthy men and businessmen and the and they were men of renown and the scripture speaks of men of renown and then and and always in the negative sense never was men of renown In the good sense, it was men of renown in the days of in the days of Noah when violence filled the earth, but they had an earth full of men of renown. And then and renown is men of the name. Men have achieved great names and status on earth. And we got great presidents and kings and all kinds of things, but we got an earth that's corrupted. &gt;&gt; Is that not so? We've got men renown. We got all kinds of stars, movie stars, and sports stars and men of renown and beautiful women and me and men and women of renown whose names you identify right away. I tell you what, friends, there's a people that have received another name. They've received another life. And thou shalt be the bride of Jesus Christ. You're going to live a different life because there's a different seed that's in you. you are a different people. Not because I'm saying it, not because I want you to feel good. That's the truth of God's word. If there isn't a people of that category, if there isn't a people of that status, Jesus died in vain. But I says he died to redeem his own. He died that he might have a bride, a pure, spotless bride. And I say she is here. And thy name shall be called bride, for thou shalt live the life the life of the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I with this I'll close. He said, "Now watch the love of God in the message inner man." When the people said to Moses, "Don't speak. Let God speak." He says, "Now watch the love of God." And that ought to make you start praying for revival. God condescending, coming down, unfolding himself. Then God appeared there in a pillar of fire. Then the next time he appeared in a visible form was when he appeared in his son Jesus Christ. He overshadowed a virgin, created a blood cell in her womb, and brought forth a son of God. And God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. In the message redemption by power, he said, "I know that God has condescended coming down from glory and standing in this building." Now, that was at that moment. And further in redemption, he said, "What is it?" He said he suffered as a man and was tempted and so on. What was it? It was a condescending of God and Abraham restored the message. He said what's he doing? God's condescending trying to draw near to his people so he can be loved and be worshiped. And in statue of a perfect man, I want to say that's what he's trying to do even this morning. He wants to he wants to condescend even further down. I'm not a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I've been set here as a minister to minister to the people. You have been set. You have been called, &gt;&gt; have you not? &gt;&gt; You've been called &gt;&gt; by a name. &gt;&gt; And that name no man knows. You know it. &gt;&gt; Because you you yourself are the only one that can testify and say something got a hold of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't an emotion. You didn't come here to get a boyfriend, to get a girlfriend, to get a husband, to get a wife. You didn't come here to get a better job, better position or something else. You came here because you heard a voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, people go to all kinds of churches. You might say, and right away, Satan might say in your mind, people come to all kinds of churches and say the same thing. I felt a pull. I heard a call. All the rest of it, and what they heard was the call of that church, the call of that place, the call of this society, the call of this club, whatever it is. The Quanis and the Lions and all the rest of them, they have some desire. It's some natural desire. But in this in this church and amongst message believers, it's it's not the call of the church. We haven't got a headquarters. And it and it's not me. I wouldn't even have a message if we didn't have the message. This is from the message. And you've been called. You heard a tape. You read a book. You read a scripture and the Holy Spirit inspired you. What am I saying? I'm saying unequivocally, you heard a call. And that call was God calling your name. your specific name. And it's a lot better than even saying Moses, Moses, Samuel, Samuel, Ed, Ed, Bill, Bill, Joe, Joe, Mary, Mary, Susie, Susie. It's a lot better than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cuz that name is not the your full. You say, "Oh, if I could only be a different person. If I could that seed that's in you, God by his spirit coming to that seed that's in you." You've heard it before, but I'm saying it now emphatically. That's the name God called you by. He put something in there and that seed in there knows the voice of its master. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he said to you, "Come." &gt;&gt; Oh, the flesh may be fought and your mind reasoned and everything else happened, but he kept calling your name. He kept calling your name till finally you said, "Oh, yay, Lord. Here I come. &gt;&gt; It's me." It's &gt;&gt; precisely me. &gt;&gt; And God in this day, let me conclude. God in this day has condescended. He's condescending. Coming down, coming down. &gt;&gt; The purpose of which is to make known God's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you know him, he he did not listen. Listen close now. Before the seals were opened, the seals have manifested many, many things and the message has unfolded many things. Prior to that opening, we could say prior to this, the reformers, the apostles and so on, they only knew God at the level as God said Abraham, Isaac, Jacob only knew me as Adonai. &gt;&gt; They only knew me that far because that's as far as he revealed himself. And all the reformers and all those prior to this age knew God only as he revealed himself up to that time. And he's only can be known when he reveals himself. Then they see God in a new light. &gt;&gt; Because because then they see God's works. And that is God's name. &gt;&gt; It's nothing that we praise with our lips. But when we start to give honor to God, we heap honor on his head. The God that is doing these things. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm glad he opened my eyes. Brother Burkhart, I'm glad he opened my eyes. I could go out of this world thanking God I saw false anointed ones. I'd be in a I'd be in a terrible trap if he had not revealed himself to me and showed me false anointed ones. I'm so glad he showed me the serpent's seed. How that explains so many things. The seed, the sin that was in the beginning. I'm thankful to God he showed me that. Oh my people, my people, I say to you, God made himself known to this little fellow here. And God has made himself known to you. Hallelujah. So that you can live the kind of life he's ordained you to live in this world. &gt;&gt; The name you have doesn't suit that life. The name you have on earth, the bomb your parents give you, doesn't suit that. God's got another name for you. And I don't know how it'll sound, but someday somebody will say it. But I know one thing. I have that name. &gt;&gt; God's called me by that name. And it is a new name that fits the new man. I can tell you Ed Biscll doesn't fit the new man. Ed Bis fits a man that's full of all kinds of faults and all kinds of troubles and weaknesses and so on. That doesn't fit that kind of man. I'm not interested in in a name on the earth. I'm not interested in a name of renown. I'm interested in a name that God can call and a son can say, "It is me, Lord. It is me. You're speaking to me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so I'm so thankful and worshiping this morning that God has condescended &gt;&gt; right down to where I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've been a patient people. And I would like to have would like to have even gone on, but I'm going to just close now. I've been much longer than I expected to be. Oh my &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope you can tie the things together. You can see now while Brother Brandham at the at this last messenger had to say, you know, well, if they're Ricky or whatever, I'd change their name &gt;&gt; cuz he's telling us and showing us that the name has significance and that the world knows it. And they've got all kinds of Elvises and whatever more. They've got all kinds of flooy names for this perverted generation. But God God is making us aware because even the name I mean it's so powerful the name of Graham Branham &gt;&gt; Abraham when you line those up there never has been and God God listen maybe you never saw this before God just chooses two men that okay one of you you'll go to the world at large you're a messenger. You're going to stay at Abraham's group and for myself I'm going to turn back to Israel. It's all the same time. Last part of 4748 and 48 becomes a nation. God's got his attention on Israel. And here goes another one out to the world. Becomes popular and he's he's with the king. He's with the kings and he's with presidents and he becomes the president's evangelist and and he's filling stadiums and all the rest of it. And another one's back here. He's like the one that stayed with Abraham, &gt;&gt; saying, "Well, the secret of your heart is this." And and and and the miracles are happening. And the crippled children, some of the first, begin to straighten out. And the attention of the people is gotten. And it's a different kind of a group of people that's being gotten over here. And it's another group of people over here. And Israel is being and to this one here, they're seeing God in a completely different capacity. God doing different things. So, we've never seen this before. We've never seen this in 2,000 years. This this is different. And people looked at it and watched it. And then pretty soon, pretty soon it was more than just signs and wonders. More than just a man called William Brham. now now starts coming out of his mouth things that made the Bible &gt;&gt; come alive. &gt;&gt; But in this 2,000 years so many had established themselves completely established themselves and said that God is three and God is this and hell is eternal and all of these things. And he got all these doctrine sent out all these thousands of missionaries all over the world with their doctrine. And so now here comes a man says, "If what I've just said is the truth, let the God who said it now come and prove it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God proves it. &gt;&gt; How could they love him for it? They couldn't. Says, "It's against our theory. It's against our doctrine. It's against our church. It's against our headquarters. It's against everything we stand for. We can't. He's a nice man. But don't believe what he says." say. And really what he was doing was he was just coming for a small group of people. Small group of people. And what he was saying is this is your bridegroom. This is your bridegroom. This is what he's really like. &gt;&gt; They think they know him, but that's not him. This is him. &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying? And furthermore, I can prove it because he's condescended right now. He's right beside me. He's standing here wanting me to tell you this. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister. &gt;&gt; How could we miss it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Let's just stand, shall we? I thank you for your time and kindness to tell you, you know, it's so different for me. It's hard sometimes hard to get started and hard to hard to quit. I thank you for your patience and I trust that it'll really be something you can ponder and meditate on. These messages have recently been very very difficult difficult for me. Very difficult. And uh I'd like I'd like you to understand that it's just been real real difficult studying. And it's it's like it's I don't know whether Satan is fighting it or what it is, but I'd appreciate your prayers and pray. Listen, friends, we don't want to stay where we have been. &gt;&gt; We want to we want to be moving on up there. &gt;&gt; And I want to you to go this from this sanctuary this morning realizing number one, the only reason you're here is because you heard God call your name. Call your name. And then when you begin to see supernaturally those things as the word begin to open up really that's your name, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what you're saying. You're seeing your name and and you got to get completely away from it that it has a certain phonetic sound. &gt;&gt; It's not a sound at all. Thou shalt call his name Jesus. For &gt;&gt; you heard my call because I know you by name. I've called your name. That's why you responded. And now what I reveal to you will be your real life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Going to show you the kind of life you can live. &gt;&gt; Oh, this that's why we can say this up and down and up and down. It's gone. It's out the window. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This life of doubt and fear gone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think I'd like to just sing I love him. I love him. He first loved me. I love him. I love [Music] me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] is my all [Music] dream. [Music] And this is why I love him because he first loved me [Music] and he my redemption. Thank you Lord Jesus. upon the tree. And at last he cried is finished. [Music] And his head and cry. Oh, what a sign for sinners. [Music] My Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'd like us to we could bow our head please. I feel to go to prayer just now. And there are some here who you are. You know that God has called you. You know that it is his will for you to be a son and daughter of his. And somehow perhaps you have allowed the world or your mind to be just occupied with other things and you as a result are not living the victorious life that God wants you to live. But their heart your heart was spoken to this morning and the Holy Spirit is here. The Holy Spirit is persuading you. The angels of God are surrounding the place and are around you and they're encouraging you. They're they're energizing your faith to believe to cast off the shackles of the enemy that has no right. I resist Satan in the name of Jesus Christ on behalf of every son and daughter of God that seeks to be free and seeks to live the life and to express the full expression of Jesus Christ in their lives. God, you will honor it. The Holy Spirit is here to see that that happens. The Lord Jesus has condescended and is here with us in this in this building this morning. I wonder how many there are that you might want to raise your hand. Say, "It's me, Brother Ed. It's me." I want you to pray for me. I want to be set free at this moment. If you're under some bondage, let it be broken in the name of Jesus Christ. I say in the name of Jesus Christ, believe unto your deliverance. &gt;&gt; Don't go out of here &gt;&gt; in fear and don't go out of here believing you can't do it. It's not you, it's him. &gt;&gt; And you shall be. &gt;&gt; You shall be. When God spoke to the great seers of the past, the sages, you shall be. You shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people. He shall save his people from his sins. There, he's still in the saving business right now. There may be somebody here that you're not certain of your redemption, your salvation. He died that you shall be saved. Hallelujah. Deny the enemy. Deny Satan in Jesus Christ's name. Would the congregation pray with me? Father, I pray for every man, woman, child that raise their hands at this time. And Lord, I raise my hands to you on their behalf. And I pray that you will come in all of your beauty, in all of your glory, and you will smite the enemy. You'll destroy his camp. Dismantle it. Take it apart and send him. Send him fleeing away from these people. Lord, send him away from them. Destroy that habit. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, may not hold them any longer. Let them be free. Sons and daughters made free. Oh, power of God. Power of God by the Holy Spirit. Lord, we we are calling upon you that it may be a completed work. And you that have desired it and have prayed it now, you should raise thrust your hands in the air and say, "Thank God. I thank that's it. It's over. It's finished. When I believe it, it's finished. Thank God for it. I thank you, oh God. Your name has been manifested. Your power has been revealed to us. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, thank you Lord. How mighty you are. How great is our God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. Praise his name in the life. Praise his name in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How great is our God? &gt;&gt; I just want to worship him. How great is our God. [Music] Oh, how great is his name. [Music] He's the greatest one forever the same. He might see [Music] me [Music] in [Music] my praise. [Music] forever. [Music] [Music] Put your trust in me. And as we're getting ready to leave and I'd like you to be early tonight. I know the time is short. Our brother Tom will be ministering tonight. Something's on his heart. Just been down having meetings down in Arkansas. Anxious to hear what God has spoken to him. But uh if anybody asks you who I am, tell them I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; That's at least that not my name, but that's one of my titles. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's one of my titles. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we'll shake hands and and be on our way dismissed. [Music] Jesus. If anybody asks you just who I am, oh tell them I am once again [Music] Jesus. [Music] [Applause] You just tell them I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. How could Mrs. Jesus be anything but redeemed? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you. Lord willing, we'll see you this evening. Just get a little bit of rest. Amen. Right to see our brother Jim Hayes and Janet's mother and father here. God bless them coming on these nasty roads. Amen. God bless you all. We ought to pray that they get some salt for 8th Street. Shouldn't wait, Brother Jim. And or or maybe better yet, a snow plow. Oh, don't worry about it. It'll all be over one of these days. &gt;&gt; We'll see you tonight. God bless you. You're dismissed. [Music] Are you [Music] wonderful? [Music] might see. [Music]
