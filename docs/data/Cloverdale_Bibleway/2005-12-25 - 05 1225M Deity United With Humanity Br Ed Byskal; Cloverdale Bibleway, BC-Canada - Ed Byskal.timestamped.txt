[21:59] declare your love and grace and mercy
[22:02] and guidance.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; How you left, oh God, your the ramplets
[22:08] of glory, your your majesty, and you
[22:11] came in as a humble servant.
[22:14] You just didn't come into a darkened
[22:16] world, but in the hearts of souls that
[22:19] were first born in your presence, oh
[22:21] God, to redeem us back to yourself. What
[22:24] an honor, Father.

[23:15] from coming into the fullness of his
[23:17] relationship with you. But we thank you,
[23:20] oh God, that you've already delivered
[23:22] him, oh Father. And those, oh God, who

[29:46] live inside this house of clay
[29:50] and mold it every day.
[29:54] Let your word be born
[29:58] in a manger
[30:00] of my heart.
[30:05] Outwardly I'm nothing, not much to
[30:10] behold
[30:12] unlikely
[30:14] a place for his word to unfold.
[30:19] But if I'll just yield this vessel and
[30:23] let him have his way from glory unto
[30:28] glory. He'll change me day by day.
[30:34] Let your word be born
[30:39] in manger of my heart.
[30:43] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[30:49] Live inside this house of play
[30:53] and mold it every day.
[30:57] Let your word be born in the manger
[31:03] of my heart.
[31:06] Let your word be born
[31:11] in a manger of my heart.
[31:15] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[31:22] Live inside this house of clay
[31:25] and mold it every day.
[31:29] Let your word behold
[31:33] in a manger
[31:35] of my heart,
[31:38] [Music]
[31:47] man. That's wonderful.
[31:50] I know that's my desire. Is that your
[31:51] desire this morning? For his word to be
[31:53] born in our hearts. Amen. Believe it.
[31:55] That work's already happened. I was born
[31:57] to be a dwelling place, a home for the
[32:00] presence of the Lord. Let's sing it
[32:01] together and then maybe the visible
[32:03] sisters have a song for us this morning.
[32:06] For I was born
[32:11] to be
[32:13] a
[32:20] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[32:27] [Music]
[32:30] I
[32:32] found
[32:35] separate
[32:37] [Music]
[32:45] to
[32:49] [Music]
[33:02] My
[33:04] presence
[33:07] [Music]
[33:13] [Music]
[33:22] I
[33:25] was born
[33:27] to
[33:29] [Music]
[33:45] [Music]
[33:56] deep.
[33:58] In the night
[34:01] the angels
[34:03] were heard
[34:06] singing
[34:08] a sweet meloy.
[34:11] [Music]
[34:16] Sharing
[34:18] their me
[34:20] of life for all men.
[34:25] celebrating
[34:27] the birth
[34:29] of a king.
[34:31] [Music]
[34:34] And the angels
[34:37] declare
[34:39] his glory.
[34:44] The heavens
[34:47] loudly
[34:49] proclaim.
[34:53] We shall see him in all of his splendor.
[35:03] We shall behold
[35:07] the king.
[35:09] [Music]
[35:17] He
[35:19] gave his life,
[35:22] leaving
[35:24] a promise
[35:26] of hope
[35:29] for all who
[35:32] believe.
[35:36] Even
[35:38] in death,
[35:40] he showed us his glory.
[35:44] reaching out
[35:47] to set captives
[35:50] free.
[35:52] [Music]
[35:54] Soon time shall cease,
[35:59] ending
[36:00] all sorrow,
[36:03] broken hearts
[36:05] will no longer grieve.
[36:12] All men shall bow down,
[36:16] confessing
[36:18] his glory,
[36:20] proclaiming
[36:22] him king of all kings.
[36:29] And the angels
[36:31] declare
[36:33] his glory.
[36:37] The heavens
[36:40] loudly
[36:42] proclaim.
[36:44] [Applause]
[36:46] We shall see him in all of his

[37:04] We shall behold.
[37:08] the king.
[37:17] [Applause]
[37:20] That's everybody's
[37:22] testimony.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; We shall behold the king. I shall behold
[37:27] the king. Let's let's just sing. You may
[37:30] not know the words, but the chorus is
[37:31] very, very simple. Let's just sing the
[37:33] chorus together. Why don't you stand,
[37:35] shall we? Amen. Hallelujah. This is a
[37:38] house of God. This is a house of
[37:41] liberty.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; And the angels
[37:44] [Music]

[38:52] Hallelujah.
[38:54] Glory to God.
[38:56] We shall behold him in all of his
[38:58] splendor.
[39:00] We shall behold him.
[39:03] We have beheld him as saints and ages
[39:06] past would dearly have loved to have
[39:09] seen him.
[39:11] Oh, how we've seen him
[39:13] &gt;&gt; in his glory today.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; He's manifested himself, friends,
[39:19] &gt;&gt; in his power. Praise the Lord. How many
[39:23] are delivered this morning?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; How many are free this morning?
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Not from ages of generations ago, but
[39:31] from this generation.
[39:33] From this generation, from this
[39:35] deceptive age.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; You're not deceived.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; That marvelous.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You haven't been taken by
[39:45] the cunning of the enemy of this
[39:47] generation.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; This terrible generation. Here we are.
[39:52] Oh, I want to just praise him. Praise
[39:54] him. Give him glory.
[39:57] There's none like him. There's none
[39:58] worthy like him.
[40:01] We magnify you, Lord. We praise your
[40:04] name.
[40:06] You've been so gracious to us.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God, that we have a a
[40:12] depth of understanding of the true
[40:16] meaning of this season. Bless your name.
[40:18] And Lord, we are here to worship you in
[40:20] spirit and in truth.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Not just a lot of emotion, Lord, but in
[40:26] spirit and truth. You've restored the
[40:29] truth. You've opened the seals. You've
[40:32] made known yourself to us. We see you in
[40:36] all of your beauty.
[40:38] We magnify you.
[40:41] May you be glorified in this meeting.
[40:44] May there not be one thought or one mind
[40:46] that would deprive you of your rightful
[40:49] place.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus, how we love you.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Isn't it wonderful to be
[40:57] gathered together? We want to greet all
[41:00] of our internet family,
[41:02] all those who are worshiping with us
[41:05] just now, not in the visible
[41:07] congregation,
[41:09] but we just greet them each one in the
[41:12] name of Jesus Christ. Whatever country
[41:14] they may be in right now, we just say
[41:17] God bless you and may his presence ever
[41:22] be near you. And for us that are here, I
[41:26] pray that your day today will be a very,
[41:29] very precious time in God's presence. We
[41:33] want his presence.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; We want him to be pleased, don't we?
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] Uh
[41:41] maybe I'll just have you have your seats
[41:43] for a moment. We'll be turning to the
[41:45] word in just a moment, but I I don't
[41:47] want to keep you standing too long. This
[41:49] is a special Sunday.
[41:52] uh not merely because it's December the
[41:56] 25th.
[41:57] That's not really what is so special to
[42:00] me. What is really special to me is that
[42:02] this is 40 years as of last night that
[42:07] God called Brother Brandham off the
[42:09] scene. 40 years, one generation.
[42:13] and I and my wife were sitting in our in
[42:17] our den room in Toronto.
[42:22] Uh and uh
[42:26] our children were were just been put to
[42:28] bed. So it was evening
[42:32] and I was pondering. I knew that brother
[42:34] Brandham was laying in a coma
[42:38] in the hospital in Amarillo, Texas.
[42:42] And uh I had uh Sister Tammy Laroo's
[42:46] father.
[42:48] He he and I had been in touch with each
[42:50] other. And brother Tom Brown uh said he
[42:54] would call me just soon as he heard
[42:55] anything.
[42:57] And while I was sitting there,
[43:00] I was just, you know, I was pondering
[43:02] the Christmas season. It was very
[43:03] Christmas, of course, out there. you
[43:05] know, they have snow on the ground and
[43:07] and uh
[43:09] it was like it was like just something
[43:11] just overwhelmed me and come over me and
[43:14] my wife was sitting nearby and I said,
[43:18] "Just think, dear. You know, this is
[43:20] Christmas Eve." And uh yeah, the the
[43:25] store windows are full of manger scenes
[43:29] and the church bells are ringing and the
[43:33] churches are having Christmas service,
[43:36] Christmas Eve services and candlelight
[43:39] services and and the radio waves around
[43:43] the earth. Uh the radios are playing out
[43:47] all kinds of Christmas carols and joy to
[43:50] the world. the Lord has come and all of
[43:53] these things. I said, "If if Brother
[43:55] Brandham
[43:58] with the phenomenal life that he had and
[44:02] the birth and the light and all the
[44:05] phenomena that followed his life, I
[44:07] said, "If he lives beyond this season
[44:10] and just dies," I said, "I won't
[44:12] understand that."
[44:14] But I think just imagine just think what
[44:17] if God took him right at this time when
[44:20] the whole world is declaring the whole
[44:23] Christian world is declaring we believe
[44:25] he came the first time and we believe in
[44:27] John the Baptist we believe that he sent
[44:29] a forerunner the first time and
[44:31] announced his coming and uh we believe
[44:33] all these things
[44:36] what would happen I said what what what
[44:38] would happen I was trying to in asking
[44:40] her I was trying to assimilate the depth
[44:43] of the meaning myself if right at this
[44:45] time while the world's declaring that we
[44:48] believe he came the first time the
[44:50] messenger of his second coming is taken
[44:52] off the scene and about two hours from
[44:56] then the phone rang and said he's gone
[45:00] well
[45:03] I was like you probably feel just now I
[45:05] was I was smitten I thought what should
[45:09] I be doing what should I do I thought
[45:13] probably I I I need to just run across
[45:17] this whole nation just tell him it's
[45:18] over. It's over.
[45:22] And I just didn't know what what God was
[45:24] going to do from then because as far as
[45:26] I was concerned, it was impossible. We
[45:28] had to go to more meetings. We had to
[45:30] hear more services. There was more
[45:32] things to happen. You know, it never
[45:35] occurred to us that we got to preach
[45:36] this message. We're just listening to
[45:38] it. We're just enjoying it. We're just
[45:40] waiting for the next series of meetings.
[45:43] We're waiting to see what, you know,
[45:45] God's messenger is going to bring next.
[45:48] That's that's what on our minds. When's
[45:51] the next set of meetings?
[45:54] And here it was all still and gone.
[45:57] Well, I can tell you there were some
[45:58] deep thoughts that went through our
[46:00] minds.
[46:02] And I was thinking of uh you know, the
[46:05] Joshua Commission. Brother Bram talked
[46:07] about his Joshua commission. And the
[46:10] angel of the Lord said, "As Moses was
[46:12] given two signs, you'll be given two
[46:14] signs. If they don't believe the first
[46:15] sign, I'll they will believe the next
[46:18] sign. I'll because the next sign will
[46:20] have a voice. There'll be a voice behind
[46:23] the sign. And if they don't believe the
[46:25] first sign, I'll cause them to believe
[46:27] the second. For I'll make you to know
[46:28] the very secrets of their hearts." And
[46:30] that's what happened. And they had to
[46:32] believe it right to the very end. Right
[46:35] at the very end. I mean they had to they
[46:37] had to believe that it was God even
[46:38] though they didn't believe the message
[46:39] part of it. And then I got thinking of
[46:43] the you know brother Brandham talks
[46:45] about said Joshua means Jehovah savior
[46:49] and he represents the end time leader
[46:52] that will come to the church and even as
[46:54] Paul came as the original leader Caleb
[46:57] represents those that stayed with the
[46:59] true Joshua
[47:01] with Joshua. They stayed true with
[47:04] Joshua. Joshua was a God-scent prophet
[47:07] and he knew the promises of God and he
[47:09] waited for them. He waited for a
[47:12] clear-cut decision from God. And when
[47:14] the time came to move, God placed the
[47:17] full leadership in Joshua's hands
[47:20] because he had stayed with the word and
[47:22] God could trust Joshua but not the
[47:25] others. So it will repeat in this end
[47:28] day the same problem and the same
[47:31] pressures. And in the court trial
[47:34] message in Birmingham, Alabama, he said,
[47:36] "Now Joshua said, I still the people."
[47:40] Is Joshua speaking? I still the people
[47:43] by telling them keep quiet. God said so.
[47:47] God said it. And that's true. But you
[47:49] know there they were only two days from
[47:53] there. That's Kadesh Barnea. They were
[47:56] only two days from Kadesh Barnea.
[47:59] They were only two days. They would have
[48:02] been in the promised land, but Joshua
[48:04] said it was 40 years before
[48:08] we took the land. And that's what Joshua
[48:11] said in in his book in Joshua's the 14
[48:15] chapter 14 said 40 years old was I when
[48:20] Moses the servant of the Lord sent me
[48:23] from Kades Barnea to as spy out the land
[48:26] and I brought him word again as it was
[48:29] in mine heart. Now he's referring back
[48:31] to Kadesh Barnea two verses down. This
[48:34] is verse for verse 10 chapter 14. And
[48:38] now, behold, the Lord hath kept me
[48:41] alive, as he said, these 40 and five
[48:44] years, even since the Lord spake this
[48:47] word unto Moses, while the children of
[48:50] Israel wandered in the wilderness, and
[48:52] now lo, I am this day four score and
[48:56] five years. There were an extra 40
[48:59] years. But God took another generation
[49:02] into the land. And you know, there was a
[49:04] I I would like you people that are here
[49:07] and all who are listening today, we need
[49:10] to be able to appreciate fully what God
[49:13] has allowed and permitted us to have
[49:17] what others weren't permitted to have.
[49:19] We don't know why, but there was a whole
[49:22] generation of people saw the signs, had
[49:25] the hearts revealed, were in that
[49:27] remarkable atmosphere, but aren't here
[49:30] today, aren't following it today. And
[49:32] here you are. Most of you have never
[49:34] seen it,
[49:36] &gt;&gt; heard a tape, read a book, whatever
[49:38] more. But God,
[49:41] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, God in his uh abundant mercy
[49:46] &gt;&gt; and in his predestinated plan, open your
[49:50] eyes and your understanding and said,
[49:53] "I'll take them in.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; I'll take them in because they will
[49:57] believe it. They do believe it."
[49:59] Hallelujah.
[50:01] Oh, and I'm thankful to be identified
[50:04] &gt;&gt; with a group of people today that
[50:07] believe it
[50:08] &gt;&gt; with all their heart.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; I thank you for your love and your
[50:12] prayers.
[50:15] I thank you for the cards and things and
[50:18] uh words of encouragement that you've
[50:21] given. I I know you wouldn't be here if
[50:23] there just wasn't something in your
[50:24] heart. And I thank you for it. I really
[50:26] do. And I trust that we can we can never
[50:29] be worthy of it, but we will try to be
[50:33] of service to you as long as God gives
[50:35] us strength and allows us to be that.
[50:39] Amen. I would like to speak today and we
[50:43] don't have any service this evening.
[50:45] That's fine. I'm not going to speak till
[50:46] this evening, but I would like to speak
[50:49] on this subject. Deity united with
[50:53] humanity.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] Hallelujah. Now you can stand once
[50:59] again. Thank you. Sure enjoyed that
[51:02] song. Even if they were my daughters, I
[51:05] tell you what, I it's not not that part
[51:08] of it. It's just hearing.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Some worship to God.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone feeling good?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asked that often. You
[51:19] feeling good? That's that's important. I
[51:21] want you to be feeling good. Hallelujah.
[51:24] We're coming up now. Next next uh
[51:28] Saturday evening is a watch night
[51:30] service. And uh you know, I thought I I
[51:33] just talked to all you see you young men
[51:36] and you young ladies that are here and
[51:38] those you that God has done something
[51:41] very very special for you. You probably
[51:44] didn't catch it, but I think it's
[51:47] remarkable that God did this just coming
[51:51] up to this 40-year anniversary.
[51:55] a whole new generation.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; If I were you, I would this morning as
[52:01] of this moment, I'd say, "Brother
[52:03] Brandon, Brother Biscll's trying to tell
[52:05] us something."
[52:08] And probably if you' talked to the young
[52:11] people and the young young ones that
[52:13] were going into the promised land said,
[52:15] "Do you feel any different?" They
[52:16] probably say, "Well, no, I really
[52:18] don't." But they were different in that
[52:21] God was doing something different in
[52:23] their season.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And there is something very different
[52:26] that is happening. And I want you to
[52:28] really really have a uh not merely an
[52:33] appreciation
[52:35] but that you will have an openness
[52:37] towards God and say, "God, you didn't
[52:40] call me for nothing. You called me for
[52:42] something. You called me and you have a
[52:44] purpose.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; You have a purpose. Whatever it is, man
[52:48] or woman, we have a we have a purpose.
[52:51] God has a purpose for our lives.
[52:54] Let's just pray before we read.
[52:58] Dear Father, how I thank you this
[53:00] morning that we have life and breath
[53:03] within our body and we are able to come
[53:07] and express what we would like to
[53:10] express to you. Perhaps not fully, but
[53:12] we we know that you look on the heart.
[53:15] You don't look on the outward, Lord, but
[53:18] you look upon the heart. And the as we
[53:21] look upon one another as brothers and
[53:23] sisters here within the congregation, we
[53:26] do not really see what's in the heart,
[53:28] but you see what's in the heart. And
[53:30] we're so thankful this morning that you
[53:33] you look upon us, oh God, and you see
[53:35] our desires, the desires that you've
[53:37] placed there in our desires to serve
[53:40] you, desires to love you and to be true
[53:43] to you. And Lord, I pray that you'll
[53:45] help us. Help us in our frailty. Help us
[53:48] in our weaknesses. Oh God, help us
[53:51] although we have failed you. We ask you
[53:52] to forgive us. And we pray, dear Lord,
[53:55] that you'll take us and strengthen us.
[53:57] That we might serve you with more
[53:59] courage. We might be fervent, oh God,
[54:02] that we truly may have the spirit that
[54:04] was upon Joshua. Oh, to be courageous,
[54:07] you said to him, and heed the word and
[54:10] do it. And we pray, oh God, you'll help
[54:12] us. We ask this morning you'll give uh
[54:15] cause me to be fluent with the word Lord
[54:17] and with clarity of thought. May it be
[54:20] the very thought and mind of God made
[54:22] known to the people. Bless this people I
[54:25] pray. Bless us together. Anoint us each
[54:28] one as we stand at our post of duty in
[54:31] Jesus Christ's name and for his glory
[54:33] alone. Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Happy to have our brother and
[54:37] sister Andy's here with us. And I'm sure
[54:40] it was nice for them to see their
[54:41] grandchildren singing. I see brother Kim
[54:44] Dingwall here. God bless you, brother
[54:46] Kim. Nice to see you and brother Ben.
[54:49] Shook hands with him as well and many
[54:52] others that are perhaps visiting and
[54:53] we're happy that you're here because a
[54:55] lot of our people are away. But uh but
[54:58] we're here.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read out of Genesis the 3
[55:02] chapter uh a few verses there.
[55:07] Genesis 3
[55:10] and we're going to read verses 23
[55:15] uh 22 23 and 24.
[55:27] And the Lord God said, "Behold,
[55:31] the man has become as one of us to know
[55:33] good and evil.
[55:35] And now, lest he put forth his hand, and
[55:38] take also of the tree of life, and eat
[55:42] and live forever." Therefore, the Lord
[55:45] God sent him forth from the garden of
[55:48] Eden to till the ground from whence he
[55:51] was taken. So he drove out the man and
[55:55] he placed at the east of the garden of
[55:58] Eden cherubams and a flaming sword which
[56:02] turned every way to keep the way of the
[56:05] tree of life. Amen. You may be seated.
[56:14] Strange scripture
[56:17] for perhaps a a Christmas day service.
[56:22] But every day, you know, we although
[56:25] this day is uh is perhaps special,
[56:29] but I think every day needs to be
[56:30] special to us as far as as far as the
[56:34] you know the working of God is concerned
[56:36] and and our relationship with the Lord.
[56:40] But these verses which we have read just
[56:43] now
[56:45] they are the the real meaning of
[56:48] Christmas
[56:50] is perhaps disguised but I don't think
[56:53] it's disguised in these verses. The real
[56:57] meaning of Christmas which is God
[57:01] bringing Jesus Christ his son into the
[57:04] world as a remedy for sin.
[57:10] Christmas is because of what happened
[57:12] right here in these verses. And that is
[57:14] that God had to drive Adam and Eve out
[57:19] from the place that they had been
[57:21] intended to be. And that union that was
[57:26] between God and man now turned into a
[57:31] separation.
[57:33] That separation had to be had to come
[57:38] back into a complete union again. And
[57:41] that's why I titled the service today
[57:45] deity united with humanity because
[57:49] that's what Christmas is. deity united
[57:53] with humanity. And there were times I'd
[57:57] like to just give a a a brief overview
[58:00] first. There were times when you can see
[58:03] through the scripture where God would
[58:05] draw near to the people. And that is why
[58:09] even we say prophet and they're prophets
[58:11] of the Old Testament. But the reason why
[58:13] God even established a prophet, the
[58:17] office of a prophet was so that he could
[58:19] draw near to the people because he had
[58:22] to have a vessel. And I can say that
[58:27] having not having not experienced, you
[58:30] know, what a prophet's office is except
[58:33] to have been near the prophet of this
[58:36] generation.
[58:38] But when you read those of the Old
[58:40] Testament, they were so misunderstood.
[58:43] They were considered as mad men. They
[58:46] were considered uh out of their mind and
[58:49] consequently they paid for it with their
[58:51] lives. Jesus said of the scribes and the
[58:54] Pharisees, you've slain every one of
[58:56] them. But why were they slain? Was
[58:59] because they were they were men that
[59:01] were unearly to the population.
[59:05] Read Ezekiel. You can't understand
[59:07] Ezekiel for the life of you.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; You can't understand many of the things
[59:11] that the prophet spoke. We get glimpses
[59:14] of pieces here and there and so on. But
[59:16] what was the prophet established for?
[59:19] God established that office so he could
[59:22] draw near to the people. But it was a
[59:25] treacherous place for a man to be.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; You want to believe that? It was a
[59:30] treacherous place for a man to be.
[59:34] Brother Bram told me that where he went
[59:37] in inspiration was just a razor's edge
[59:40] from insanity
[59:45] where you go up into that kind of
[59:47] inspiration and then come and then have
[59:49] to come back down into this here,
[59:53] &gt;&gt; you know, because that inspiration just
[59:55] lifts a person up. And that's why people
[59:57] today, even in the drug world, they want
[59:59] to get something. They want to get
[1:00:01] something that lifts them out of
[1:00:02] reality. So it's the world's not real
[1:00:06] and and then they want to stay on it.
[1:00:08] It's not just that they gets addicted,
[1:00:10] but they want to stay there because they
[1:00:12] don't like the real world. They don't
[1:00:14] like the problems. They don't like the
[1:00:16] decisions. They don't want to face life
[1:00:19] the way that it is. So they stay in some
[1:00:21] other realm as long as it is possible
[1:00:24] and then of course become addicted to
[1:00:26] it. But you know that's just a devil's
[1:00:28] substitute.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's a devil's and
[1:00:33] it's a poor substitute. It destroys the
[1:00:35] body and destroys the mind and people
[1:00:38] live in some other world. All right, but
[1:00:40] nevertheless, it's not God's way.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; But the prophets, they were one of the
[1:00:47] uh tools or instruments that God used to
[1:00:51] draw near to the people. And that is why
[1:00:53] the first prophet Moses when he came on
[1:00:56] the scene and God established him, the
[1:00:58] people said, "You speak to us. We we
[1:01:02] don't want God to speak. It was too
[1:01:04] fearful. It was too It was just too
[1:01:07] fearful for them and they were gripped
[1:01:09] with fear. So they would sooner have a
[1:01:12] vessel stand between them and God. You
[1:01:14] hear him and then you come back and tell
[1:01:17] us. So God had these times when he drew
[1:01:21] near and he instructed Moses, you made a
[1:01:23] tabernacle and you constructed a certain
[1:01:26] way and you do all of these things
[1:01:28] precisely because I want to dwell with
[1:01:31] the people. I want to be near them and I
[1:01:34] want to be where they can, you know, but
[1:01:37] God has always been veiled. He had to
[1:01:39] always veil himself. Brother Brandham
[1:01:41] said Job, he wanted he wanted a God with
[1:01:45] skin on. He wanted to go up to his door
[1:01:47] and knock on his door and talk to him
[1:01:50] because man has always desired that. But
[1:01:53] because of this separation in the day
[1:01:55] that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
[1:01:58] surely die.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; You shall surely be separated. This
[1:02:04] oneness, this closeness,
[1:02:08] uh this unity between God and man would
[1:02:11] be separated. And the whole story of the
[1:02:15] book from Genesis to Revelation is for
[1:02:19] that union to come back.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus was born and then I'm
[1:02:27] I'm just giving you this quick overview.
[1:02:28] When Jesus was born, deity was united
[1:02:33] with humanity completely. He was a God
[1:02:36] man. God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:02:41] world to himself. But was this only for
[1:02:44] him?
[1:02:45] I say no, it wasn't. Had it been for him
[1:02:49] only. And if that had been if that had
[1:02:51] sufficed the heart of God, then God
[1:02:54] wouldn't have wanted anything further.
[1:02:56] But that was not sufficient
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said it's expedient for
[1:03:01] you that I go. If I don't go, he won't
[1:03:04] come.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I will
[1:03:07] come to you.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; He says one place the father will send
[1:03:10] the holy spirit. next place he says,
[1:03:12] "I'll send him."
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; One God.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And so we're believing in that's what
[1:03:19] deity is. Deity is the belief in one
[1:03:22] God.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; We believe in one God.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And this God wanted to be united in a
[1:03:29] fusion with humanity that is beyond our
[1:03:33] understanding. But it was essential
[1:03:35] because this this body this man is
[1:03:38] doomed to die
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; or be changed one or the other. But by
[1:03:43] the sin of our our four parents, Adam
[1:03:46] and Eve, we have been born in sin. And
[1:03:49] so we have that and we pack it. We pack
[1:03:52] this weak body with us. The flesh is
[1:03:55] weak. But I want to I want to major on
[1:03:58] this dual aspect of deity and humanity.
[1:04:04] We are humans
[1:04:06] and uh as far as the church world is
[1:04:09] concerned,
[1:04:11] most don't want to approach the subject
[1:04:14] of deity because then that they think
[1:04:16] that that gets off into cultism. But
[1:04:19] I'll tell you something. If we haven't
[1:04:21] got deity in us, then Jesus did not
[1:04:24] speak the truth. He said, "I will be in
[1:04:27] you."
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; And if he was not deity, then we don't
[1:04:30] have salvation. If he was not deity,
[1:04:33] then there was no point in the
[1:04:34] crucifixion. If he was not deity, even
[1:04:37] the resurrection, what does that mean?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was deity fused together
[1:04:43] with humanity because it had to be that
[1:04:47] way. And then was it only for Jesus? No,
[1:04:50] it wasn't only for Jesus because then on
[1:04:52] the day of Pentecost, he said now, now
[1:04:55] he will be in you when he, the spirit of
[1:04:57] truth has come, he will be in you. He
[1:05:00] will dwell in you. This is going to be
[1:05:02] something different. This is at another
[1:05:04] level. But then all through the church
[1:05:07] ages, all through the church ages, then
[1:05:11] at the end, now it's not because we want
[1:05:13] to make brother Brandham something, but
[1:05:15] you cannot find I I I defy anybody to
[1:05:18] find a history book, any book of
[1:05:21] religion, any leader of the past that
[1:05:24] had the kind of of ministry. I'm talking
[1:05:27] about the whole scope of it. I'm not
[1:05:29] talking about healing. And I'm not
[1:05:30] talking just about the revealing of the
[1:05:32] heart. I'm talking about the healing,
[1:05:34] the supernatural, the phenomena, and the
[1:05:36] angel of the Lord, the pillar of fire in
[1:05:39] attendance all the time.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And then the supernatural with the
[1:05:46] opening of the word.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, the oneness of
[1:05:50] the Godhead, there's been people that
[1:05:52] have believed that, but haven't tied it
[1:05:53] together with the baptism. There's been
[1:05:55] people that have put it together with
[1:05:56] the baptism. But then the serpent seed,
[1:05:58] you cannot deny the serpent seed. is
[1:06:00] from Genesis straight through to
[1:06:02] Revelation. Absolutely. And if you put
[1:06:04] all of these together and the opening of
[1:06:06] the seals and the opening of the word,
[1:06:08] you put all of those together, the
[1:06:10] MelzDC ministry, put all of that
[1:06:12] together, I tell you what, and you
[1:06:14] cannot find a ministry that is so
[1:06:17] knitted and stitched together in oneness
[1:06:19] with the scriptures from Genesis through
[1:06:22] to Revelation.
[1:06:24] That kind of a ministry came at the end
[1:06:26] time because there had to be a fusion of
[1:06:29] deity with humanity at another level.
[1:06:33] And that level happens to be husband and
[1:06:35] wife.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And that's the only time the scripture
[1:06:39] refers to when it says to husband and
[1:06:41] wife, they too shall be one flesh.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that has direct
[1:06:46] reference to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] and the bridegroom which is which is our
[1:06:51] Lord Jesus Christ. It is deity. And thus
[1:06:54] they had to have this kind of a ministry
[1:06:56] at this end time so he could speak of
[1:06:59] the mighty God unveiled because God was
[1:07:02] deity was behind that skin
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; making himself known to his people
[1:07:09] because that was not for him alone. It
[1:07:11] was for you
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; as Jesus the deity God in God in Jehovah
[1:07:17] in an infant
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Jehovah in Christ Jesus. But it was not
[1:07:22] for him alone. It was for you. And
[1:07:25] that's why I said, "I'll be in you."
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; It's good that I'm with you, but it's
[1:07:30] more important that I will be in you.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And as long as he was in that temple, I
[1:07:35] can't be in you. It's important that I
[1:07:38] go so the Holy Spirit will come and
[1:07:40] he'll be in you.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And then we've gone all through the
[1:07:43] church ages. And at the end of the
[1:07:45] church age, here comes a a I'll say a
[1:07:48] God man,
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; a man with God in him.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Well, you could say lots of people have
[1:07:53] had God true, but not at this level,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; not at this capacity, not at this
[1:08:00] intensity, not with this kind of
[1:08:03] vindication,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; not with this perfection.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because God did that, he
[1:08:10] was indicating. He was saying it's not
[1:08:12] just for me, it's for you.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; He was saying the wick of the
[1:08:17] messengers. The w the messengers have
[1:08:19] their wick dipped in that oil that will
[1:08:22] not go dry. But it's not for the
[1:08:24] messenger alone. It's for the people.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deity
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; united with humanity.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God, we read the scriptures
[1:08:42] when God drove them out. So, he drove
[1:08:44] out the man. This is the when he was
[1:08:48] expelled, he was driven out. He was
[1:08:51] divorced. He was put away. That's what
[1:08:53] the word drove in the Hebrew means. God
[1:08:56] divorced them. He put them out. He put
[1:08:58] them away. He had to thrust them out and
[1:09:01] drive them out of his out out of the
[1:09:03] midst of that place of perfection.
[1:09:06] My, there had to be a a way all the way
[1:09:09] back,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; not part way back. A prophet couldn't do
[1:09:13] it
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; just by himself. It had to be more than
[1:09:17] that. It took the God man, the man, God
[1:09:21] Jesus Christ. It took deity being
[1:09:24] infused into flesh into humanity and the
[1:09:28] word became flesh
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us and we handled him.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; This separation from God,
[1:09:39] separation of man from God required a
[1:09:42] master plan
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; whereby deity or God would once again be
[1:09:48] united with man.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And thus that is why when Jesus said, "I
[1:09:54] and the father am one."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Then took the Jews. Then the Jews took
[1:10:01] up stones to stone him again.
[1:10:05] When he said that,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; when he said, "I and my father are one."
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You know, that happens to be the crux of
[1:10:12] things today.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; People just dislike someone being so
[1:10:20] assured that they would say,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; "I and my father am one."
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; That has implications.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; That has powerful implications. You're
[1:10:31] saying that God's in you.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:34] That goes a little too far. You want to
[1:10:36] sing, pray, prophesy, speak in tongues,
[1:10:40] do all of these manifestations, fine.
[1:10:44] But to say God is in me.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; People today will say that, but they
[1:10:50] somehow they want the scripture kind of
[1:10:52] watered down.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; So it's not completely God in you.
[1:10:58] You can say that and yes, they'll
[1:11:00] rejoice at it. But then when it comes
[1:11:02] down, God deity in me.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; That's a different story.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; We need it in its full strength,
[1:11:11] friends.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; We don't want to back away from it. We
[1:11:14] need it. You need it in its full
[1:11:15] strength. You need to confess that is
[1:11:18] the truth.
[1:11:19] And those of the scripture when they
[1:11:21] have to say you know when the disciples
[1:11:25] the Bible says in and in in fact is in
[1:11:27] in in John's gospel the Bible says that
[1:11:30] the people left him when he came to this
[1:11:35] subject eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:11:39] the people said how can how can we do
[1:11:41] that how how can we hear that and the
[1:11:43] Bible says that they left him
[1:11:47] I'm making a point and finally he was
[1:11:49] left with just his disciples.
[1:11:53] I want to convey to you, you need to
[1:11:56] have the same attitude those disciples
[1:12:00] had when they could say, "We have not
[1:12:03] left.
[1:12:05] We are different."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And yes, we are chosen. And Jesus said,
[1:12:10] "Have not I chosen you 12 and one of the
[1:12:12] devil."
[1:12:14] But we have to be able to say, "I have
[1:12:16] been chosen
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; by God
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; to be true." Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I've been chosen by God to have this
[1:12:24] revelation. I've been chosen by God to
[1:12:28] see what I see. I've been chosen by God.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; That's the place you have to come to.
[1:12:37] I've been chosen by God. I can't help
[1:12:39] it. I see what I see. I can't help it. I
[1:12:42] am what I am. I can't help it. If the
[1:12:45] word says I'm the bride, I am the bride.
[1:12:47] Sorry, you don't want to claim it.
[1:12:49] That's fine. But that's what the word
[1:12:51] says. I am.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You must say that.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; You must know that deep inside.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I and my father are one.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Then the Jews took up stones again to
[1:13:07] stone him.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them, "Many good works
[1:13:11] have I showed you of my father. For
[1:13:14] which of these works do you stone me?"
[1:13:16] The Jews answered him, saying, "For a
[1:13:18] good work
[1:13:20] we stone thee not, but for blasphemy,
[1:13:22] because thou thou being a man, makest
[1:13:25] thyself God." There's the crux.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; There's the difficulty right there. Thou
[1:13:30] being a man make thyself God. See, they
[1:13:34] didn't understand.
[1:13:36] They just didn't understand. They
[1:13:37] couldn't comprehend. And the human mind
[1:13:39] can never catch it.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. this God
[1:13:43] merging deity with humanity.
[1:13:48] And to this and to this day, there's
[1:13:50] multitudes over the face of the earth
[1:13:51] that don't believe that Jesus was deity
[1:13:54] merged with humanity.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The God man. Do you realize that
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; big population of the earth doesn't
[1:14:02] believe that?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Do not believe it.
[1:14:07] We don't only believe it. And there's a
[1:14:10] multitudes more that believe it, but
[1:14:12] they believe it historically.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, it happened back there. And we
[1:14:16] remember the babe in the manger. It's
[1:14:18] not the babe in the manger that we
[1:14:19] worship, friends.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; And I know that you know that.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them, "Is it not written
[1:14:27] in your law I said ye are gods?"
[1:14:33] If he called them gods unto whom the
[1:14:35] word of God came to and the scripture
[1:14:37] cannot be broken and how often brother
[1:14:39] Brandham quoted that. Why did he quote
[1:14:41] it? Because it was pertinent to his own
[1:14:43] ministry and what the message was
[1:14:46] conveying to the hearers of the message
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; to you and I.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he called them gods, unto whom
[1:14:53] the word of God came, and the scripture
[1:14:55] cannot be broken, say ye of him whom the
[1:14:58] father hath sanctified and sent into the
[1:15:00] world, thou blasphe because I said, I am
[1:15:03] the son of God.
[1:15:06] In uh in the message that it is the
[1:15:08] rising of the sun,
[1:15:12] brother Brandham asks
[1:15:14] concerning the resurrection of Jesus.
[1:15:16] Was this was he to be only was he the
[1:15:19] only one to be the beneficiary of this
[1:15:22] or are we to be beneficiaries of it? I
[1:15:24] say we are. He said you are
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; to be beneficiaries of his resurrection.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; I say we are beneficiaries of his birth.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are beneficiaries of what
[1:15:36] happened there.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; We are beneficiaries of the fact that
[1:15:39] God came into humanity.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; That my friends is what's absolutely
[1:15:47] essential. And that makes the difference
[1:15:48] between a believer and a makeeliever.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; A believer
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; knows. He knows. She knows. She's had
[1:15:58] the experience. God
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; is in me.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen to that?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; God is in me.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; That kind of a person
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; walks different,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; speaks different, lives different, and
[1:16:14] is different.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Tell you friends, I want you to be
[1:16:20] enthused with me. If you are enthused,
[1:16:22] if it's your if it's your experience,
[1:16:24] this is a glorious thing
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; that God created heavens and earth.
[1:16:30] You say, "I can't grasp that." That's a
[1:16:33] good thing. If you could understand it,
[1:16:35] it wouldn't be worth believing.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; They couldn't believe how they were
[1:16:40] going to eat his flesh. They couldn't
[1:16:41] believe how they would drink his blood.
[1:16:42] They couldn't believe. They couldn't
[1:16:44] understand, but they believed it anyway.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Brother says over and over, they
[1:16:48] couldn't explain it. Couldn't explain
[1:16:50] it. There's a lot of things about the
[1:16:51] message I can't explain. I haven't been
[1:16:53] called to explain it. I've been called
[1:16:55] to believe it.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:59] So now I want to take and have you look
[1:17:03] with me because this is an important
[1:17:05] part of the service this morning. This
[1:17:07] dual aspect of the person of Jesus
[1:17:10] Christ, both divine and human.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; You know why it's so important?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Is because that has direct reference to
[1:17:19] you and I. Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; We are a vessel holding
[1:17:27] something divine.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And we're very human.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; I'm kind of taking off from last Sunday,
[1:17:38] but you probably won't catch the you
[1:17:41] won't be able to identify it.
[1:17:44] There's a lot of folks that will put all
[1:17:46] kinds of, you know, strong terminology
[1:17:49] on brother Brandham himself and on his
[1:17:51] ministry and so on,
[1:17:54] but draw back from allowing that to
[1:17:58] reflect onto them
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; because it feels it puts them in a in a
[1:18:02] in a spot where their life needs to
[1:18:05] measure up. Well, our lives do need to
[1:18:07] measure up. We do need to live according
[1:18:09] to the word. That is absolutely for
[1:18:11] sure. And we need to be real, we need to
[1:18:15] be real sincere about that. I believe
[1:18:18] that.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; I believe what he also said. A lot of
[1:18:20] people want to quote is just certain
[1:18:22] things, but he said that our testimony
[1:18:24] and what comes out of our mouth should
[1:18:25] should match
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; our lives and our testimony should
[1:18:29] match. I I believe in that. But is the
[1:18:32] flesh weak? Yes, it's weak. It'll always
[1:18:34] be weak. Does that give allow us to go
[1:18:36] out and just, you know, just do the
[1:18:38] things of the flesh and live in the
[1:18:39] world and so on? No, not at all. That
[1:18:41] doesn't give that that isn't what that
[1:18:43] says. But Jesus was man very man and he
[1:18:47] was God very God.
[1:18:50] Duel means this. It means made up of two
[1:18:54] distinct elements
[1:18:57] having two parts
[1:19:00] or two functions
[1:19:02] or two aspects
[1:19:05] or items of similar kind. We have, I
[1:19:09] would like to say that two distinct
[1:19:11] elements. We are certainly flesh and
[1:19:14] we're very conscious of that. And Jesus
[1:19:18] was just as much flesh as you are. If he
[1:19:21] wasn't, then he couldn't redeem your
[1:19:23] your He couldn't redeem you. He couldn't
[1:19:25] be your redeemer. He had to be a kinsman
[1:19:28] redeemer.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Kinsman. He had to be every bit your
[1:19:38] kinsman. If he didn't, then he didn't he
[1:19:41] could not stoop far enough to pick us up
[1:19:44] and to include us into the plan of
[1:19:46] redemption. So, he was man, very man. He
[1:19:50] was tempted.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, you know how you're tempted.
[1:19:54] This word says he was tempted in all
[1:19:59] points.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] Now, most people have Jesus up someplace
[1:20:05] where he wasn't tempted quite like you.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; That's not what this book says.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; This book says he was tempted in all
[1:20:14] points.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Like you.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Now, people get a little quiet when you
[1:20:20] come to that because they they want to
[1:20:21] have Jesus in some in some uh realm that
[1:20:27] is unreal. Right?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; He was very real. And that's why most of
[1:20:33] the people didn't believe in him
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; because they said, "Isn't this Joseph's
[1:20:36] son?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; He's worked here. His brothers and
[1:20:39] sisters are here with us." And so they
[1:20:42] elevate him to today because it's
[1:20:45] historical. So we can elevate him into
[1:20:48] some place that that the people back
[1:20:51] then did not see him, could not view
[1:20:53] him. He was they they could see the
[1:20:55] human part of it. But Jesus himself was
[1:20:59] completely tied to the divine part.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Even so, when they said, "Your mother
[1:21:06] and your brethren are here,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; they're looking for you. They want to
[1:21:12] speak to you." He said, "Who is my
[1:21:14] mother
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; and who are my brethren?" Now, would
[1:21:17] that beloved Lord Jesus be disrespectful
[1:21:20] to Mary? No, he wasn't disrespectful.
[1:21:23] But his his complete tie,
[1:21:27] he was completely linked and connected
[1:21:30] with the divine part.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm bringing something down to you,
[1:21:34] friends, and I I know that you won't you
[1:21:37] probably won't get it into the depth I
[1:21:39] want to bring it to you, and I'd like to
[1:21:40] show it from the rooftop. We are the
[1:21:43] opposite. We are so tied
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; to our natural our natural background,
[1:21:50] our natural family, our natural this,
[1:21:52] our natural that. If somebody said to
[1:21:55] me, your your your wife and your family
[1:21:56] and so on is out here, it wouldn't even
[1:21:58] it wouldn't even clue into my mind for
[1:22:01] me to say, "Who is my wife? Who are my
[1:22:04] children? Who is my family? Who is my
[1:22:07] brother? Who is my sister?"
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus gave me and gave you the
[1:22:12] solution to that equation. And he said,
[1:22:14] "They that believe the word of God,
[1:22:18] sir."
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And you and I this Christmas day, we
[1:22:21] need that kind of a revelation.
[1:22:24] [Applause]
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; I've seen people so affected by the
[1:22:28] unbelieving within their own family that
[1:22:31] they allowed it to drag them down.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And that is not what God intended. Who
[1:22:36] is my family? Who are my children? Who
[1:22:40] are my brothers? Who are my sisters?
[1:22:43] They that hear the word of God can do
[1:22:45] it.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus never there's no
[1:22:53] record. He ever went back to where he
[1:22:55] was born. It's religion that's done
[1:22:57] that.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; He never established the church of the
[1:23:00] nativity. He knows nothing about that.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That was not his doing.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen to it. It's
[1:23:11] absolutely the truth. All of this
[1:23:13] Christmas business had nothing to do
[1:23:14] with Jesus.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't establish it at all. But it
[1:23:21] was this it it was this dual aspect.
[1:23:24] Jesus had it.
[1:23:27] And now it was important at that time
[1:23:31] because God always had to be veiled. And
[1:23:34] Jesus was the veil. He was the body that
[1:23:38] God, the invisible God, dwelt in. Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; He was the body by which God could
[1:23:45] manifest himself in. Now, I know that
[1:23:47] you you know that some of these things
[1:23:48] are perhaps elementary, but the
[1:23:51] scripture says of Jesus, "For what the
[1:23:53] law could not do in that it was weak
[1:23:57] through the flesh." It was weak through
[1:23:59] the flesh.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; That was that one element.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; The law was weak through the flesh.
[1:24:07] God
[1:24:09] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:24:12] sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in
[1:24:16] the flesh.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; That's why the dual aspect he had to be
[1:24:21] flesh man, God man because he knew you
[1:24:25] were coming.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You were a flesh man, a flesh woman. He
[1:24:29] was giving you a a a sign that God deity
[1:24:34] would dwell within that flesh man.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is the full
[1:24:40] redemption.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil cheat you out of it.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; That is why I'll just
[1:24:52] recall last Sunday. Now I went through
[1:24:56] the lineage of the record of the record
[1:25:00] of the birth of Christ.
[1:25:03] Now now I'm going to ask you some I
[1:25:06] think powerful question here just now.
[1:25:11] If God knew from before the foundation
[1:25:15] of the world that he was going to send
[1:25:18] that man would fall and he was going to
[1:25:20] send his only begotten son by a virgin
[1:25:25] birth by a virgin birth having nothing
[1:25:29] to do with a man and that the one that
[1:25:32] would come forth out of the womb of a
[1:25:34] woman would be neither Jew nor Gentile.
[1:25:37] Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Why then
[1:25:41] is there such a
[1:25:44] uh I'll say such an intense concern by
[1:25:49] God over the lineage in the human side.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Why was God concerned who had who for a
[1:25:58] son?
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz his son's going to come by a virgin.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to have no link to this
[1:26:03] anyway. But God tied his son inseparably
[1:26:08] to the natural lineage.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And yet when he came right to the time
[1:26:13] of the birth, I mean he even we talked
[1:26:15] about the women that are included in in
[1:26:18] Genesis 1 or rather Matthew 1, Abraham,
[1:26:22] why is this important? Abraham begat
[1:26:25] Isaac. Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob says
[1:26:28] this is the generation of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:31] Excuse me. I'm not being sacriiggious
[1:26:33] now. When I say
[1:26:35] who cares
[1:26:37] he's going to see, he's going to be born
[1:26:39] by a virgin. Who cares who begat who?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Why is that important? Why is it
[1:26:44] important? Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac
[1:26:46] begat Jacob and Jacob begat whoever. Who
[1:26:49] cares?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a virgin birth. This is
[1:26:52] just this is irrelevant.
[1:26:54] Completely irrelevant. Are you with me?
[1:27:00] But there was another seed
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; and it was a faith seed.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And that faith seed was divine from God.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; They didn't have that faith within their
[1:27:15] flesh, within their flesh man. They had
[1:27:17] weaknesses. Abraham lied.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; He sinned. He failed.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; But he had a faith. Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] Listen to me friends. His faith was
[1:27:29] stronger than his lie.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; His faith was stronger than his
[1:27:36] weakness.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; His faith was stronger than his flesh.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He did heed his wife. He did take Hagar.
[1:27:45] He did bring forth Ishmael. But God in
[1:27:48] mercy,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; the faith that was in him was stronger
[1:27:52] than that frailty.
[1:27:55] Hallelujah.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; He had a faith seed.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He had something divine.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It's something that was given to him.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And so God, that's why he followed. And
[1:28:06] that's why the lineage was so so
[1:28:09] absolutely critical critical till it
[1:28:12] come down. That's why I made you just a
[1:28:15] wee bit on Tamar. You've heard me speak
[1:28:18] about Tamar.
[1:28:20] I the reason I refer to it and the
[1:28:22] reason I go over it again is some of you
[1:28:23] have not heard it
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; but tamar and that's why we get into we
[1:28:29] get into areas of the scripture we can't
[1:28:31] even begin to understand who can
[1:28:33] understand we call it the grace of god
[1:28:35] but it was more than even the grace of
[1:28:37] god in that it was absolutely essential
[1:28:40] that tamar she had no idea what was
[1:28:44] driving her she was being driven by an
[1:28:47] unfor unseen force She had to bring
[1:28:50] forth that seed of Judah.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; She could not understand it.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, irrespective
[1:29:00] of what what we go through
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; as a believer, I'm talking about a real
[1:29:05] true son and daughter of God.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I have I care nothing for what we go
[1:29:10] through. We may go through easy times.
[1:29:13] We may go through hard times. You may
[1:29:15] struggle all your life, but let me tell
[1:29:17] you that your faith in the word of God
[1:29:20] in this hour has more value to God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean we become disrespectful
[1:29:31] to our friends or our family or whatever
[1:29:33] more. But the thing is you must have
[1:29:36] your your emphasis your emphasis and the
[1:29:39] whole focus of your life must be on that
[1:29:41] spiritual divine part within you. God
[1:29:44] has given me favor
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; with faith in my heart. I believe it and
[1:29:49] I don't even know why I believe it. I
[1:29:51] see it, but I don't know how come I got
[1:29:53] to see it. I see it because God made it
[1:29:55] clear to me. I can't help it.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Not because you got enthused in the
[1:30:02] service. It might have happened in the
[1:30:04] most quiet time, but God revealed
[1:30:06] himself to you. And you know where it
[1:30:08] was when he began to reveal himself to
[1:30:10] you. That was divine.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; That's something from God himself.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That's a divine part. You are a dual
[1:30:18] being in that aspect.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And Tamar,
[1:30:24] now she was married to a man for you
[1:30:27] young people that don't know the name.
[1:30:30] She was married Judah was her
[1:30:32] father-in-law.
[1:30:36] And in those days, you know, quite often
[1:30:38] there the the a son would be promised to
[1:30:41] a young woman. And so Tammer was married
[1:30:44] to Judah's son
[1:30:46] and he died
[1:30:49] and the law was in the Old Testament
[1:30:52] that the then the next brother had to
[1:30:54] take her for wife and he would not give
[1:30:57] her seed. He refused his seed to her
[1:31:01] and God smoked him and he died and there
[1:31:04] was a last son Sheila
[1:31:07] and the father was reluctant to give.
[1:31:11] Well, Sheila was too young at that time
[1:31:14] and said he so he said to his
[1:31:16] daughter-in-law, "You go home to your
[1:31:19] father,
[1:31:21] put on the garments of widowhood so
[1:31:23] people will know you're a widow
[1:31:26] and stay with your father-in-law in your
[1:31:28] your mother and father's home." So, she
[1:31:30] went there.
[1:31:34] Sheila became of age to marry her.
[1:31:39] But ju Judah doesn't want to give his
[1:31:42] youngest son because he's already lost
[1:31:44] two and this is the last
[1:31:47] even possibility
[1:31:49] that he will have a lineage through
[1:31:53] Sheila and it appears that as though
[1:31:56] Tamar may be a dangerous woman of some
[1:31:58] sort of thing. there's some danger
[1:32:01] connected with her and so he refuses to
[1:32:04] give Sheila his youngest son to her and
[1:32:06] so she remains as a widow.
[1:32:11] She hears
[1:32:13] that Judah is up with his friend
[1:32:17] shearing sheep not far from where she is
[1:32:20] and that he must pass through their
[1:32:21] village and she takes off. Now look,
[1:32:25] watch this. Watch this. This is in the
[1:32:27] scripture.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says Jesus Christ is in
[1:32:30] every scripture.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And she takes off purposely now takes
[1:32:34] off the garments of her widowhood and
[1:32:36] puts on the garments of a harlot. She
[1:32:39] plans and schemes this thing.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; And I I I want to ask you to ask
[1:32:46] yourself, what is driving this woman to
[1:32:49] this extremity?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; What's causing her to do such a thing?
[1:32:54] Because now she looks straight in the
[1:32:57] face of being stoned or being burned
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; for her sin.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; And she puts on the garments of harlotry
[1:33:06] like a harlot
[1:33:09] and presents herself on the pathway
[1:33:13] where Judah will be passing by.
[1:33:16] Judas sees her,
[1:33:19] desires her, and says
[1:33:24] that he would like to have a sexual
[1:33:26] relationship with her
[1:33:29] is the Bible.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; And before, she said, "Before I do that,
[1:33:35] what will you give me for this?"
[1:33:40] Said, "I'll give you a kid. I'll give
[1:33:41] you a small one of the animals, a kid, a
[1:33:45] small goat.
[1:33:47] He said, "Now before you bring that,
[1:33:49] what will you give me as a sign
[1:33:53] that you will bring that?" So he has a
[1:33:55] bracelet and a a staff, I believe it is.
[1:34:00] And he gives her three items. Says,
[1:34:02] "Here, you have these three, and I'll
[1:34:05] send my servant. He'll bring you the
[1:34:06] kid, and then he'll retrieve these three
[1:34:09] items.
[1:34:13] Judah lays with his daughter-in-law,
[1:34:16] which is absolutely against the
[1:34:18] scripture
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; that we know of.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Even though this was prior to the law,
[1:34:24] this was prior to Moses' law.
[1:34:29] And then he goes and he sends his his
[1:34:33] friend back with the kid
[1:34:36] with a small goat. And when he comes to
[1:34:39] Tamar,
[1:34:41] when he comes to to the town, he can't
[1:34:44] find a harlot. So he says to the man of
[1:34:47] the town, "Where's the harlot that stand
[1:34:50] sits by the pathway?" Says, "You're in
[1:34:53] the wrong town. There's no harlot in
[1:34:56] this town."
[1:34:59] So he goes back and gives the kid back
[1:35:01] to Judah and says, "There's no harlot
[1:35:03] down there."
[1:35:05] After a season, Judah goes home. And
[1:35:09] after a short season, word comes to him
[1:35:11] through the grape vine, "Tammer, your
[1:35:14] daughter-in-law is pregnant." He said,
[1:35:17] "Bring her here and I'll burn her."
[1:35:22] And they brought her to him.
[1:35:26] Now, here's this man, one of the 12 sons
[1:35:30] of Jacob, and he's prepared to burn her.
[1:35:34] And she says, "Just before you burn me,"
[1:35:37] said I have something here.
[1:35:39] And she hands him his three items and
[1:35:42] says, "Of this man, I'm carrying a
[1:35:45] child."
[1:35:47] And he says, he says publicly, "Tamar
[1:35:52] is more righteous than I am."
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; But now the question, you can never
[1:35:57] understand that. And you'll never
[1:35:59] understand. You'll never grasp
[1:36:04] what was it.
[1:36:07] What was it
[1:36:09] that was deposited within this woman
[1:36:14] that drove her to such an extremity,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; a planned plan? What drove her to do
[1:36:22] that? I say what drove her was a divine
[1:36:26] power.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] And she allowed and surrendered herself
[1:36:31] to that divine power in the sight of in
[1:36:34] the sight of burning,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; in the sight of stoning, in the sight of
[1:36:39] death. She looked death right in the
[1:36:40] face, but something was moving her.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And something, my friends, it doesn't
[1:36:48] move us to commit sinful things, but
[1:36:51] something is moving us beyond anything
[1:36:54] people can say about the message. any
[1:36:57] persecution or whatever they may do. But
[1:37:00] I I I need you to see this extremity
[1:37:03] that she went to. And then you find her
[1:37:06] over in Matthew the first chapter.
[1:37:09] You'll recall me from last Sunday. Over
[1:37:11] in Matthew the first chapter, here she
[1:37:14] is mentioned. Tamar
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; and Rahab the harlot
[1:37:20] and Ruth the Moabitete
[1:37:22] and Ba Sheba. These are four women that
[1:37:27] you cannot reconcile with your own puny
[1:37:30] little mind. But I want I I need to say
[1:37:34] to you that there was something of a
[1:37:36] divine nature sent from God himself
[1:37:40] because God knew when it would come to
[1:37:42] the virgin birth. And and you'll recall
[1:37:46] I I'm making mention now because I want
[1:37:47] to major on this a wee bit. There's a
[1:37:50] gap between this natural lineage all the
[1:37:52] way through. And then Jesus is born of a
[1:37:56] virgin.
[1:37:58] There's a gap. This is all a human part.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And then God, deity, comes down and is
[1:38:04] united in human flesh.
[1:38:07] What What has this got to do with all of
[1:38:09] this for centuries?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; What has this got to do? If God knew it
[1:38:14] was going to be by virgin birth, why is
[1:38:17] all of this taking place? Why are these
[1:38:19] men? Why are these women? Why is all of
[1:38:22] this lineage? Why are they going through
[1:38:23] what they're going through in their
[1:38:25] natural life? What's it all for?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; There is a divine part, my brother and
[1:38:32] sister, that you do not understand and
[1:38:35] you will never understand. But it's
[1:38:37] deity that comes down within the human
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; and you'll never never grasp it
[1:38:46] completely. But in this day and age, I
[1:38:48] believe that we are God has ordained for
[1:38:51] us to experience something at this level
[1:38:54] that we have never experienced.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care where you've been in
[1:38:58] church. I don't care what kind of
[1:38:59] religion you come from. This message
[1:39:01] contains things you'll never grasp
[1:39:04] fully.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; But one thing you'll know, you'll be
[1:39:06] driven.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You'll be guided by a force.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the squeeze comes,
[1:39:13] and we can have a lot more squeeze than
[1:39:15] we've had, friends. We've had things
[1:39:16] fairly easy, but when the squeeze comes,
[1:39:19] there'll be a force that will drive you
[1:39:20] on. Hallelujah. There'll be a force that
[1:39:24] won't let go.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; There's a power and a strength within
[1:39:29] this message that will not give in to
[1:39:31] this world. Will not give in to this
[1:39:34] chaos.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; The world's headed in one direction. And
[1:39:39] I can tell you it's becoming more
[1:39:40] vulgar, more evil, more wicked, and it's
[1:39:45] very enchanting to the flesh. But I
[1:39:48] thank God there's deity in this flesh.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And if you can't say that, friends, and
[1:39:55] you're in for a big fall, you've got to
[1:39:58] know that there's something divine that
[1:40:01] God has placed in you. And you've become
[1:40:03] a believer of the word. You're believing
[1:40:06] his voice.
[1:40:07] You don't know how come you believe it,
[1:40:09] but you do believe it.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it yet this
[1:40:12] morning, you need to believe it.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; This gap,
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; this critical gap between humanity
[1:40:25] and the deity.
[1:40:28] There was one thing about the humanity.
[1:40:30] The humans, they had one thing in
[1:40:33] common.
[1:40:34] They believed
[1:40:36] God.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; They believed what he said.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; They had their failings. They had their
[1:40:43] tempestuous times. They had their
[1:40:46] difficulties. And much so perhaps than
[1:40:48] even we have, but God allowed their
[1:40:51] extreme cases.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; So, so you and I who have not had that
[1:40:56] extreme case. We haven't had the
[1:40:58] experience of Tamar. We haven't had I
[1:41:01] didn't have to send a man. I was not
[1:41:04] ordained to be a king, that kind of a
[1:41:06] leader. I didn't send a man to the warf
[1:41:08] front to be killed so I could have his
[1:41:11] wife. If I did do that, you wouldn't
[1:41:13] want me as pastor. But that's what King
[1:41:15] David was. A man after God's own heart.
[1:41:18] God drove him to that or God allowed him
[1:41:20] to. And he was driven to that and he
[1:41:22] took Bath Sheba out of whom came
[1:41:24] Solomon. And Jesus came and said, "A
[1:41:26] greater than Solomon is here."
[1:41:29] If you were going to reason with your
[1:41:30] mind, you might say, "Well, that's not
[1:41:32] too much. Solomon was a was a child of a
[1:41:36] woman that was uh whose husband was
[1:41:38] killed by a king."
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; You say, you might say, "Brother Ed, why
[1:41:44] are you preaching that way?" So, you can
[1:41:46] know this morning there's a whole a
[1:41:47] whole lot of this word you don't
[1:41:49] understand. You don't know. You'll never
[1:41:52] know the depths of the grace of God.
[1:41:57] God is letting you know there's depths
[1:41:59] of grace that you'll never have to tap
[1:42:01] in because perhaps you never experienced
[1:42:04] those things.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Who understands this Christmas of this
[1:42:12] kind of God?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Who understands him? Maybe a lot of
[1:42:16] people want a weaker God. This word is
[1:42:18] too strong. This message is too strong.
[1:42:21] I don't want a weaker God. I want a God
[1:42:23] that tells me who he is.
[1:42:26] Hallelujah.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I wanted God in his full strength and
[1:42:29] his full power.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And if he could take that lineage of
[1:42:33] women
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; and those men, Abraham and David and and
[1:42:38] their lives, if he could take them in
[1:42:40] their natural life and and and and they
[1:42:42] would bring a lineage down because they
[1:42:44] believed. They believed God. They
[1:42:46] believed. They believed. That's the only
[1:42:48] thing they had in common. They believed.
[1:42:49] And that's the only thing we have in
[1:42:51] common. You believe. You believe. You
[1:42:53] believe. You believe. I believe. You
[1:42:55] believe. I believe. We have that in
[1:42:58] common.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Your frailty and your weakness isn't my
[1:43:03] weakness. But we all have it.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God, but we
[1:43:09] all have frailties. We all have
[1:43:10] weaknesses. We have things that we
[1:43:12] despise about ourselves. But that has
[1:43:14] nothing to do with God's plan and
[1:43:17] program.
[1:43:19] Hallelujah.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:43:23] What a Christmas message when deity
[1:43:26] comes to dwell in humanity.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; And so God at the end, he's going to
[1:43:37] send a a a virgin birth, but he takes
[1:43:41] all of the holiness and all the
[1:43:44] righteousness and all the purity of the
[1:43:48] virgin birth and attributes it to them.
[1:43:52] all the correctness of how it came and
[1:43:56] everything that this that this seed of
[1:43:59] the woman would do and bruise the
[1:44:01] serpent's head and he takes it and
[1:44:03] attributes it all and places it on this
[1:44:06] whole lineage of people says I give that
[1:44:08] to you.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I give that to you.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And that's why Paul can say the works of
[1:44:16] the flesh,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; the works of this natural man that's
[1:44:20] worthless to God. If it's by works, then
[1:44:23] he said it's not by grace.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; By grace are ye saved and through faith,
[1:44:28] and that not of yourselves. It is the
[1:44:30] gift of God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Turn quickly in your Bible to Acts the 2
[1:44:43] chapter if you would please.
[1:44:52] I've referred to this many times over
[1:44:54] the years, but the reason I go back to
[1:44:57] it is because I always realize there's a
[1:45:00] new crop
[1:45:02] and maybe there's a a new season for
[1:45:04] someone who's heard it before, but then
[1:45:06] finally it'll click.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, finally I got it.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:12] Come on.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; In the second chapter of Acts,
[1:45:17] uh we'll start at the 25th verse
[1:45:21] because Peter now in his this is the
[1:45:24] first sermon preached after the influ
[1:45:28] infusion of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; into what had been a coward.
[1:45:36] A man who two months before swore with
[1:45:39] cursings that he didn't know Jesus.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; It's right. It's absolutely true. And
[1:45:48] here he is now. He says, "Hear me."
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; If you were some of those that left
[1:45:53] Christ, just say, "Oh, well, I think
[1:45:55] I'll just stick around a while and see
[1:45:56] what happens. This fellow uh you know,
[1:45:58] you you know what I heard? I heard he
[1:46:00] ran like a he he ran
[1:46:03] like a scared rabbit.
[1:46:06] when Jesus was being crucified. And now
[1:46:09] they're claiming that he's raised and we
[1:46:11] don't believe he's raised and claiming
[1:46:13] all kinds of things. And so they sit
[1:46:15] there and listen to him. In the 25th
[1:46:17] verse, he starts,
[1:46:19] "Now keep in mind this dual aspect I'm
[1:46:22] speaking to you about. For David
[1:46:24] speaketh concerning him, I forsaw the
[1:46:27] Lord always before my face. For he is on
[1:46:31] my right hand that I should not be
[1:46:33] moved. Therefore,
[1:46:36] because the Lord is on my right hand, in
[1:46:37] other words, therefore did my heart
[1:46:39] rejoice and my tongue was glad.
[1:46:43] Moreover, also my flesh, my flesh shall
[1:46:49] rest in hope.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; His flesh,
[1:46:54] my body will rest in hope. Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; This David who experienced all kinds of
[1:47:00] things that you and I are thankful we
[1:47:02] haven't experienced yet. He was called a
[1:47:05] man after God's own heart. He had such a
[1:47:08] repentive spirit and he made things
[1:47:11] right and he but but he he he just
[1:47:14] believed God. And listen, because of he
[1:47:17] said, "Moreover also my flesh shall rest
[1:47:20] in hope because," and this is why his
[1:47:22] flesh will rest in hope, "because
[1:47:25] thou wil not leave my soul in hell,
[1:47:28] neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one
[1:47:31] to see corruption." He's prophesying of
[1:47:33] Jesus Christ.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; But he's he's also God. There's a a
[1:47:39] divine deity part.
[1:47:43] Are you following me?
[1:47:44] a divine part of him. It's uttering
[1:47:48] right out of the weakness of that man,
[1:47:50] that flesh. We could say, well, that was
[1:47:52] before the Holy Spirit. That is true.
[1:47:54] There's been a lot of things happened
[1:47:56] since that as well. And we can look
[1:47:57] around us within the message today. And
[1:48:00] I just want you to know, friends, that
[1:48:01] there's one thing we have in common with
[1:48:03] believers of this message, and that is
[1:48:05] we believe the message.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; That's the one thing we have in common.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just carry on with the
[1:48:11] scripture. Thou will not leave the holy
[1:48:13] one to see corruption. Thou hast made
[1:48:15] known to me the ways of life. Thou shalt
[1:48:18] make me full of joy with thy
[1:48:20] countenance. Men and brethren,
[1:48:24] let me freely speak unto you of the
[1:48:26] patriarch David because that's David he
[1:48:28] just quoted that he is both notice now
[1:48:32] dead
[1:48:34] and buried
[1:48:36] and his sephilar is with us unto this
[1:48:40] day. Therefore,
[1:48:42] being a prophet,
[1:48:45] David a prophet, and knowing that God
[1:48:48] had sworn with an oath to him that of
[1:48:52] the fruit of his loins according to the
[1:48:54] flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit
[1:48:56] on his throne. Now, let me stop there
[1:48:59] and just look this way for a moment.
[1:49:02] He's saying
[1:49:09] David
[1:49:10] is dead
[1:49:12] and he's buried. That's a flesh man.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; His flesh shall rest in hope. But he
[1:49:19] says he is dead. He's buried. And the
[1:49:24] sepel is right here.
[1:49:28] Therefore,
[1:49:30] or
[1:49:32] even though this has happened, even
[1:49:35] though he's died and even though he's
[1:49:36] buried in the seilurse here, but
[1:49:39] therefore being a prophet and they knew
[1:49:41] that he was and they believed that
[1:49:45] and knowing that God had sworn to him
[1:49:47] with an oath, the oath, the oath, hear
[1:49:51] me, the oath or the promise of God that
[1:49:56] had and sworn to him
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; that he believed
[1:50:01] was stronger than the supplr
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; and was stronger than his burial and was
[1:50:08] stronger than his death
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; because he believed God's oath.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; It was stronger than what happened to
[1:50:18] the natural mind. It was stronger than
[1:50:20] his weakness. It was stronger than
[1:50:23] having taken Urias and sending him to
[1:50:26] battle. It was stronger than that
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; because he believed the word that God
[1:50:31] sent to him.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; It was stronger.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; And because of that, Peter doesn't end
[1:50:39] here.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; The oath was that of the fruit of his
[1:50:44] loins
[1:50:46] according to the flesh.
[1:50:50] according to the flesh, according to his
[1:50:52] body, of the fruit of his loins,
[1:50:55] according to his body,
[1:50:59] that he would raise up Christ to sit on
[1:51:02] his throne.
[1:51:05] Now,
[1:51:06] I want you all just to look this way
[1:51:11] as I'm coming at it again.
[1:51:14] If the loins of David
[1:51:17] had anything to do with Jesus Christ
[1:51:20] coming, then he wasn't born of a virgin.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; So, how do you handle that scripture?
[1:51:28] God swore to him
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; that of the fruit of his loins.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; He would raise up
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; his son,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; to reign on his king on his throne
[1:51:42] forever and ever.
[1:51:45] I'll tell you how that happened.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm smart be because I
[1:51:49] because you can't go anywhere with that
[1:51:51] kind of an equation. You can't go
[1:51:52] anywhere with that kind of a problem.
[1:51:54] There is no answer to it. The only
[1:51:57] answer is the only answer is that David
[1:52:00] had to say within himself, I don't know
[1:52:02] how this is going to happen.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; How is how is my son going to sit on my
[1:52:07] throne forever and ever?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; How are you going to live forever and
[1:52:11] ever?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; How are you going to have eternal life?
[1:52:14] You don't know. You're getting older
[1:52:15] every day. You don't know how you're
[1:52:17] going to have eternal life. How do you
[1:52:18] know you have eternal life? How do you
[1:52:20] know you have it?
[1:52:22] The only way you can know is that you've
[1:52:24] believed some promise.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. And the only way,
[1:52:28] the only way, one way that David could
[1:52:32] know that someone would sit on his
[1:52:34] throne forever and ever. And God allowed
[1:52:36] that it would be his own son. And he
[1:52:39] said that he would raise up Christ to
[1:52:41] sit on his throne. To sit on his throne.
[1:52:44] That Christ, the Messiah, would sit on
[1:52:46] his throne. How would David ever figure
[1:52:48] that one out? Where is he coming from?
[1:52:51] this Messiah, the Messiah is going to
[1:52:53] set. But David believed on it because
[1:52:55] God, he said, as far as he was
[1:52:58] concerned, God has swore to me an oath.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Now, friends, I'm speaking strong
[1:53:04] language today. But when we talk about
[1:53:06] this message, people are, oh, the
[1:53:08] message this, the message that, the
[1:53:09] message. Hey, the message to me is God's
[1:53:11] oath
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; being swore to me.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; God has swore to me that my theophony is
[1:53:18] beside me. God has swore to me that one
[1:53:21] step beyond this, I go to another body.
[1:53:24] God has swore to me
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; that the bride of Jesus Christ will
[1:53:31] reign a thousand years here on earth.
[1:53:33] How do I know? I don't know. God has
[1:53:35] said it in his word and God has
[1:53:37] confirmed it. God has swore to me. And
[1:53:41] because David regarded that oath,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; when it come to Matthew 1, it said
[1:53:51] Jesus,
[1:53:53] his father was Abraham and David.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Because God, because he believed, God
[1:54:00] simply took and attributed
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; all of the righteousness to David and
[1:54:06] God forgot their sin.
[1:54:09] He never held it against him.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; And you cannot find it in the New
[1:54:13] Testament
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; because it's forgotten.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; And God has swore to me
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; according to the message
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; that God cannot remember my sin.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; God cannot remember your sin.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; God cannot remember your weakness.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; God has swore it in an oath.
[1:54:34] And if you believe it, you may have it.
[1:54:38] If you do not believe it, you're damned.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; If you believe it,
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; if you believe it,
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; God swore an oath to you.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And I say, Satan will be loosed
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; from all of his ability to bring things
[1:54:54] back into your memory.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit will come now and
[1:54:59] blow those channels clear.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:55:07] We're a dual being
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; and Peter was a dual being
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; and he could speak well. Peter knew he
[1:55:16] had failed
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; but he was able to speak with that
[1:55:18] strength
[1:55:20] and
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; him being a prophet and God swore to him
[1:55:23] of the fruit of your loins.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Now here's the key and you won't forget
[1:55:28] it please.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; The word of God the word of God is a
[1:55:35] seed. Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it was the seed.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; It happens to be stronger than this
[1:55:43] seed.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; The seed of God's word.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Being believed
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; nullifies
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and removes
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; what has followed you down
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; by your genealogy.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care who your father was. I
[1:56:06] don't care who your mother was. I don't
[1:56:08] care what you've done. I don't care
[1:56:10] where you've been. But when you receive
[1:56:12] Christ,
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; It goes into the sea of God's
[1:56:17] forgetfulness.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; And you've heard this ter terminology
[1:56:20] before, but now I'm telling you how it
[1:56:22] happens.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Because the seed out of the word, out of
[1:56:25] the mouth of God, the when a prophet
[1:56:28] speaks, thus saith the Lord,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. That is a seed
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; and that seed is stronger than this seed
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; stronger than a human seed.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Thus I say, I don't care what country
[1:56:43] you come from. I don't care what
[1:56:45] language you speak. I don't care what
[1:56:47] kind of a background you've had. I don't
[1:56:49] care how many errors or mistakes you
[1:56:51] have made. I'm not saying that this
[1:56:53] allows us to live in any loose way. No,
[1:56:55] not at all. If you are a son of God,
[1:56:58] you'll live like one. If you are a
[1:57:00] daughter of God, you'll live like one.
[1:57:02] You want to be holy. You want to look
[1:57:05] holy, but looking holy doesn't make you
[1:57:08] holy.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Being a nice clean man doesn't make you
[1:57:14] holy.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; What makes you holy is you believe the
[1:57:17] word of God.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And then when that happens, you want to
[1:57:21] be.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; The life that's in you wants to be holy.
[1:57:25] You want to dress right. You want to be
[1:57:28] an example to the world.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; See, the man
[1:57:48] Christ Jesus was the veil.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; The man was the veil.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; And you know what a veil is? Is a veil
[1:57:54] is to hide.
[1:58:04] The Greeks wanted to see him in the
[1:58:05] unveiling of God. The prophet says, "So
[1:58:07] the Greeks couldn't see him because he
[1:58:10] was hid from them in a human being." And
[1:58:13] it's like people coming to church. They
[1:58:16] came to the disciples. They could come
[1:58:18] here to church. They could maybe be here
[1:58:20] this morning. I don't know. they could
[1:58:22] come and be a part of the congregation
[1:58:24] and stay here for weeks or months.
[1:58:26] There's no no restriction against that.
[1:58:28] But uh and they come and say, "We want
[1:58:31] to see this that you're speaking. We
[1:58:33] want to see this Christ." They said, "We
[1:58:35] want to see Jesus."
[1:58:37] And so the disciples, they thought,
[1:58:38] "This is great. We're having a revival.
[1:58:42] There's people here want to become
[1:58:43] believers. Come to Jesus and said, "The
[1:58:45] Greeks here want to see want to see you.
[1:58:53] Except the weed of corn fall into the
[1:58:55] ground.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; And die, it abideth alone.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; And James probably turned to Andrew and
[1:59:02] says, "What'd he say?"
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Peter maybe said to John, "John, ask him
[1:59:08] what does he mean?"
[1:59:11] This doesn't even equate. We've got some
[1:59:13] people here want to see him. And he's
[1:59:15] talking about a kernel of wheat falling
[1:59:17] into the ground. If it that doesn't fall
[1:59:19] into the ground and die, it abides
[1:59:21] alone.
[1:59:23] But if it dies, it'll bring forth much
[1:59:24] fruit. What's he talking about? He was
[1:59:27] telling them what they wanted, what they
[1:59:29] needed to see. The grain had to go into
[1:59:31] the ground and die. And when it died, it
[1:59:34] come forth and brought forth much fruit.
[1:59:36] And that's the only way the Greeks would
[1:59:37] ever see him.
[1:59:40] The only way Le Oysia and we're not in
[1:59:43] Leodysia. It's the last age, but we're
[1:59:45] in a bride age. The only way the only
[1:59:47] way the world can ever see Jesus Christ
[1:59:50] is through this what he has chosen, this
[1:59:53] channel, this church, not this
[1:59:56] particular building. I'm not saying
[1:59:57] that. I'm talking about the call out
[1:59:58] ones that he's called by his voice.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; You might say that sounds awful
[2:00:03] exclusive, just like 11 did.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; But it was 11. It was 11.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; And when it came to Malachi 4, it was
[2:00:12] one.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; It was one. And we say amen. It was one.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when it was Malachi 3,
[2:00:19] it was one. It was John the Baptist. It
[2:00:21] was only one. And it was the spirit of
[2:00:23] Elijah. Only the spirit of Elijah.
[2:00:25] Wasn't the spirit of Isaiah. Wasn't the
[2:00:27] spirit of Moses. It was the spirit of
[2:00:28] Elijah. It was that one.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Because God made it that exclusive. That
[2:00:33] happens to be the way it is. And the
[2:00:35] bride is made up of so many members and
[2:00:37] no more.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Who they are. I don't know. But God
[2:00:41] surely knows.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; God surely knows. And whoever they are,
[2:00:45] I say amen.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of it. I want to be
[2:00:49] with them. I want to be in that number.
[2:00:51] Don't you?
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; That's why he came
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; deity
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; to be united with humanity.
[2:01:03] Not for him alone back in a manger, but
[2:01:05] for you today.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; How does it happen? By you believing the
[2:01:09] word. You'll never be good enough.
[2:01:12] You'll never do enough good things. But
[2:01:13] by believing the word, God will
[2:01:15] attribute everything Christ was to you.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; To me, friends, that's everything.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; That means everything.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:32] He said a veil of his own creation, not
[2:01:35] a veil of the creation of a woman.
[2:01:38] Through the womb of a woman, through the
[2:01:40] womb of a woman.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the womb of Mary that created
[2:01:45] him.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; The womb of the woman was an incubator
[2:01:48] for him.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; But he was a creation of God.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the beginning of the
[2:01:55] creation of God, the beginning of the
[2:01:57] new creation.
[2:01:59] And we've been born by him.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; We're part of a new creation.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; When they ask you who you are, say, "I'm
[2:02:07] redeemed."
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; They ask you who you are, say, "I'm
[2:02:10] redeemed.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; I'm born again."
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I'm of Christ.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And God dwells in me.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; We must not back away from that.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:30] another place. I'll tell you what, the
[2:02:32] prophet speaks strong language and often
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; we need to say it.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; He said there was no male seed. He said
[2:02:38] God was the male seed.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; God was the male seed.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Who is your parent? God is my parent.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; I have an earthly lineage, but doesn't
[2:02:52] amount to too much.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Really doesn't amount to too much.
[2:02:58] Not many of my family,
[2:03:03] my father's side, my mother's side,
[2:03:06] they're all steeped in Catholicism.
[2:03:09] And I'll never forget them taking me by
[2:03:11] the hand. I don't know if my sister
[2:03:12] who's sitting here today was with me at
[2:03:14] that time or not, but all I remember is
[2:03:16] some aunt or uncle or grandpa or grandma
[2:03:18] or whoever it was taking me into the
[2:03:20] that uh uh some Ukrainian Catholic
[2:03:23] church and walked and soon as we walked
[2:03:25] in the door there was a a table with
[2:03:27] some idols on it. I'm 5 years old.
[2:03:33] Stepped up, told me to kiss them. I
[2:03:36] start to laugh.
[2:03:38] You got to be kidding. me kiss this
[2:03:41] piece of wood. I've never kissed a piece
[2:03:42] of wood in my life. And they put their
[2:03:45] hand behind my head. That's the first
[2:03:47] time I have some real exercise in neck
[2:03:49] muscles. I just resisted that with all I
[2:03:52] was worth. They're just pushing me
[2:03:53] forward to kiss this thing. And I
[2:03:55] thought that was the silliest thing. But
[2:03:57] when I got when I grew up and became a
[2:03:59] man, I realized that's that very spirit
[2:04:02] was still on me as a boy. I thought that
[2:04:05] was absolutely absurd. Why would anybody
[2:04:07] want to kiss this wood idol? Hallelujah.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And many of them stayed in that
[2:04:13] darkness. Most of them stayed in that
[2:04:14] darkness. But oh, my heart bleeds for
[2:04:16] them. But how I thank God for the light.
[2:04:22] [Applause]
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing
[2:04:31] God face to face in this church.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing
[2:04:35] the angels at their positions this
[2:04:37] morning.
[2:04:38] The veil is what keeps us from seeing
[2:04:40] the angels at their position this
[2:04:42] morning. Your veil. You need to discard
[2:04:45] the veil. At least within your soul,
[2:04:47] within your spiritual eyesight, discard
[2:04:50] it. And hear what the prophet has said.
[2:04:53] They're standing at their positions this
[2:04:55] morning. The angels are here.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; How do you do angels? Welcome
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; to Cloverdale Bible Way. Welcome to
[2:05:04] December the 25th, 205 service. We
[2:05:07] welcome you, angels. I can't see you,
[2:05:09] but I know you're here.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:15] And I know you're here to energize your
[2:05:17] faith, brother David. To energize your
[2:05:19] faith, my brother, my sister. They're
[2:05:21] here for a purpose.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; They're not here as a a wall decoration.
[2:05:27] They're not here to be like these
[2:05:28] plants. They're here on a mission
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; to energize your faith.
[2:05:38] The angels are here.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; They're veiled from us.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; All poor veil.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; All this poor, disgraceful, vile veil
[2:05:48] that we have. And someday we'll shed it.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One day it will drop
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; and we'll rise to seize the everlasting
[2:05:58] prize.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Don't pay too much time and spend too
[2:06:03] much of your days on this veil.
[2:06:06] It's still only worth a few cents.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; And they're standing by the seats.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Are you sitting on a seat?
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; A prophet of God who saw beyond the veil
[2:06:20] thousands of times is telling you that
[2:06:23] your angel or angels are standing by
[2:06:26] your seat.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Some of you believe it.
[2:06:34] Some of you thinking about it.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Mighty angels.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Mighty angels
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; standing by your seat.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Attending to you sent from our father.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. To look after that deity.
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:59] to assist you,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; to protect you, to guide you along the
[2:07:03] way. And they're at the command of the
[2:07:06] Holy Spirit, the very spirit of God.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; They're not directionless. They're under
[2:07:11] specific instructions
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; of what to do.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing
[2:07:19] him.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; We're hid behind the veil, and the veil
[2:07:22] is the flesh.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; We are sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your name is, but we
[2:07:30] are sons and daughters of God. Do you
[2:07:34] believe this?
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; That's thus says the word of God.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And if your faith is in the word,
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; then all of the righteousness of the
[2:07:42] word is attributed to you.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; And incidentally, you want to believe it
[2:07:47] because if you don't, all the damnation
[2:07:49] of the world is attributed to you. I
[2:07:52] say, "Oh God, I don't want any of the
[2:07:53] curses. I don't want any of the
[2:07:55] damnation. I don't want the judgment of
[2:07:57] the world. I will believe your word at
[2:07:59] all cost. At all cost. I will believe
[2:08:02] your word.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are encamped about
[2:08:12] those who fear him.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; We are in his presence in the presence
[2:08:16] of God all the time.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; We are in the presence of God. You say,
[2:08:21] "Well, my I I have a lot of my life
[2:08:24] where I don't feel in the presence of
[2:08:25] God." But the prophet is saying that on
[2:08:28] the authority of the word that says, "I
[2:08:30] will never leave you."
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Nor forsake you.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; But the veil is the flesh, and that's
[2:08:43] what keeps us out of his presence. But
[2:08:45] through the soul, the spirit, by our
[2:08:47] faith, we know that he's watching us and
[2:08:49] he's standing by us and he's here now.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; glory to God. God bless you, brother.
[2:08:59] You accept it. It's yours.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; He's here now.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; You don't have to bring him down. He's
[2:09:07] here now.
[2:09:12] Glory.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Now, you're the veil.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; You veil him.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; He's veiled in you.
[2:09:43] Jesus said, "It's not me that doeth the
[2:09:45] works, it's my father that dwelleth in
[2:09:46] me."
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; I work and the father workketh and I
[2:09:50] work hitherto.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Here he is as the veiled one walking in
[2:09:56] the flesh. God Emmanuel, God with us.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world
[2:10:01] to himself.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jesus was speaking these
[2:10:06] things, except to eat the flesh of the
[2:10:08] son of man, they said, "Moses gave us
[2:10:12] our fathers." Moses gave us mana in the
[2:10:16] wilderness. I just touched on last
[2:10:20] Sunday. And Jesus said unto them,
[2:10:22] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except
[2:10:24] you eat the flesh of the son of man and
[2:10:27] drink his blood, you have no life in
[2:10:30] you."
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:31] And with this, I'm going to close.
[2:10:37] Unless you eat the veil,
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; you'll never see what's inside.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Unless you're able to actually accept
[2:10:49] and assimilate
[2:10:52] fully what that is.
[2:10:56] The prophets of old, I can give it in
[2:10:58] that example. And Jesus Christ is a
[2:11:00] better example.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "Except you eat
[2:11:04] the flesh of the son of man."
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And drink his blood and drink his blood.
[2:11:10] Always eat the flesh first
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; and drink his blood because in the blood
[2:11:15] was the spirit.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; In the blood was the life.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; If you can't cope with the vessel,
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; you will never get to the life.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; And that holds true at all levels within
[2:11:30] the body of Christ,
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; whether it be pastor,
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; the messenger of the age
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; or the pastor of the ministries,
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; the deacons, the offices, the place, and
[2:11:44] you see somebody rise up and they're
[2:11:46] belligerent and and and forceful and
[2:11:50] they had no respect. Uh you know the
[2:11:52] prophet says that you know we examine
[2:11:53] everything and so on so forth and they
[2:11:55] have no conscience and no right and no
[2:11:57] position. One thing for sure they will
[2:12:00] never see the deity part. They will
[2:12:02] never catch a hold of the God part from
[2:12:05] brother to brother from sister to
[2:12:06] sister. We need to be able to consume or
[2:12:09] assimilate to and by that I mean it is
[2:12:12] by a by a respect and by a an
[2:12:15] acceptance.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; That is how you consume it. By accepting
[2:12:19] it, by receiving it. How do I consume
[2:12:22] the word of God? By accepting it as the
[2:12:25] word of God. By receiving it, by taking
[2:12:28] it in. And when we assimilate one
[2:12:30] another and I take you by the hand, I
[2:12:32] say, look in your eye and say, "God
[2:12:35] bless you. God bless you, my sister. God
[2:12:37] bless you, my brother." It isn't that
[2:12:39] we're examining one another's
[2:12:41] weaknesses. If you're going to examine
[2:12:42] my weakness, I'm going to examine your
[2:12:43] weakness. We're hopeless.
[2:12:46] Who is her here that's beyond that kind
[2:12:48] of examination?
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Who is there any place who's beyond that
[2:12:51] kind of examination? And that is why
[2:12:53] those that could not consume,
[2:12:57] could not respect, could not accept the
[2:13:00] flesh, the veil of the prophet never
[2:13:03] come to the message.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; That was their first problem.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; And that's a standard problem.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got that off my chest.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got that off my chest. And
[2:13:23] you can go back to the Bible and you can
[2:13:25] see those so clearly that could not eat
[2:13:28] his flesh.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; They never got to the spirit. They never
[2:13:32] got the deity part. They never got his
[2:13:35] message.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But those that stayed with
[2:13:38] him believed him.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:43] Oh, I'm glad we believed the true
[2:13:46] report.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to the lamb.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I passed the outer court.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't preach this to make you happy,
[2:14:01] friends. I preach this because I believe
[2:14:04] it with all my heart. I believe it with
[2:14:06] everything that's in me.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[2:14:10] the Lord.
[2:14:12] Hallelujah. I want to sing uh and have
[2:14:14] you stand with me. I want you to sing
[2:14:16] till the rafters
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; sing with you. Let the plaster fall if
[2:14:21] needs be. We're going to sing down from
[2:14:24] his glory.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother David Nash. God
[2:14:28] bless you, family. Amen.
[2:14:33] I look around, get preaching, then I do
[2:14:34] see a few more faces. Amen. Nice to have
[2:14:38] you.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, you're going to take off.
[2:14:51] You're going to take Hallelujah.
[2:14:56] [Music]
[2:15:00] All right.

[2:15:06] Now you understand what this is all
[2:15:07] about.

[2:15:15] Ever
[2:15:17] glory

[2:16:08] The great creator
[2:16:13] became my savior
[2:16:18] and all God fullness
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:22] [Applause]
[2:16:24] in him.
[2:16:28] What conception
[2:16:32] bringing us redemption
[2:16:38] [Music]
[2:16:42] now faithful
[2:16:47] God
[2:16:51] laid aside his splend. and
[2:16:56] still
[2:17:00] to save my soul.
[2:17:05] Oh, how I love him.
[2:17:10] How I adore him,
[2:17:15] my friend, my sunshine,
[2:17:19] my all
[2:17:24] the great.
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:29] became my savior
[2:17:33] and all God's fullness
[2:17:38] dwelling
[2:17:40] in him.
[2:17:43] With our reluctance,
[2:17:47] flesh and blood, his son,
[2:17:52] he took the form of man,
[2:17:57] revealed the
[2:18:00] plan.
[2:18:02] All glorious
[2:18:06] sacrifice
[2:18:08] of Calary
[2:18:11] and I know
[2:18:15] the great I am.
[2:18:20] Oh, how I love him.
[2:18:25] How I

[2:18:48] and all
[2:18:51] [Applause]
[2:18:53] dwell in me.
[2:18:58] Oh, I love him.
[2:19:03] I
[2:19:04] adore him.
[2:19:07] I bre my sun shine
[2:19:12] my
[2:19:13] heart
[2:19:16] my
[2:19:18] [Applause]
[2:19:21] be my savior
[2:19:26] and all your soul
[2:19:28] [Music]
[2:19:30] [Applause]
[2:19:32] [Music]
[2:19:37] Aren't we privileged
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; to have one another as brothers and
[2:19:41] sisters?
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't this a glorious honor from God?
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you for being who you are.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; We can say with Apostle Paul, I am what
[2:19:51] I am by the grace of God.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; We are who we are. I know one thing. Our
[2:19:58] desire, your desire, my desire is to
[2:20:02] serve him
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; with everything that's in us. to love
[2:20:07] him and to pass through into the
[2:20:11] beyond the curtain of time.
[2:20:13] We say, and I thought of this especially
[2:20:16] for those that are of a younger group
[2:20:21] when I started out and said 40 years ago
[2:20:23] last night. I know that there's many
[2:20:27] that say, "Oh, ooh, ooh, 40 years. Oh,
[2:20:31] that's a long time ago." But just a
[2:20:34] second
[2:20:35] just one step in the first moment, the
[2:20:39] first instant of eternity, 40 years is
[2:20:42] going to be nothing. 100 years will be
[2:20:44] nothing. Thousand years will be nothing.
[2:20:46] You now have eternal life. You now
[2:20:48] possess it. So look upon 40 years in in
[2:20:51] reference in relationship to your
[2:20:54] eternal self, your eternal being.
[2:20:57] That's not long ago. I come from God.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going back to God. Was 40
[2:21:04] years. You're going to be here for
[2:21:06] another 40 years. My wife said, driving
[2:21:07] here, she says, "If we'd have only known
[2:21:10] we're going to be here 40 years, when we
[2:21:12] sat in that room, we wouldn't have been
[2:21:13] able to understand. 40 years we're still
[2:21:15] going to be here. What if you're going
[2:21:17] to be here another 40? We won't be. I
[2:21:19] won't be here. I'll be dancing on this
[2:21:22] on the shores of hills of glory." But,
[2:21:24] you know, you say, "Well, there's no way
[2:21:26] they're going to be here." I don't know.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Well, what's 40 years? It just that's
[2:21:31] not even it. It's just gone. It's gone.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; So that's what we're living for.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to welcome the Timberman's
[2:21:46] family. That's brother Ry's mother and
[2:21:50] father. Brother Timberman, I saw you a
[2:21:52] little earlier.
[2:21:56] Right here. Right there. Yes. Yes,
[2:21:59] they've come to dwell
[2:22:02] in this lotus land.
[2:22:06] They've come to dwell and they've got
[2:22:08] their home. They've moved into their
[2:22:10] home. And I didn't know because I'm not
[2:22:12] in the first part of the service. I
[2:22:14] didn't know they had been officially
[2:22:16] welcomed. But I want to officially
[2:22:17] welcome you. And thank you for your life
[2:22:20] and thank you for your family. Thank you
[2:22:22] for your son.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; He's made a good principle for us.
[2:22:28] And we appreciate brother Randy and his
[2:22:30] wife Sharon and uh also daughters with
[2:22:35] them. Have to forgive me. I don't I try
[2:22:38] to keep up to all the names but I just
[2:22:40] not quite able to.
[2:22:43] But um I'll meet you on the other side
[2:22:45] and I won't I won't forget a name for
[2:22:47] sure.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless the Timbermans as they
[2:22:52] fellowship with us.
[2:22:54] We're going to sing this chorus once
[2:22:56] more and I'm just going to have brother
[2:22:59] Andy's come and pray a prayer for us.
[2:23:02] Would you please Brother Andes?
[2:23:07] Oh, how I love you.
[2:23:13] I
[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:17] my
[2:23:25] heart
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:33] be my savior. in your
[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:40] fullness.
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Andy's happy to have you. God
[2:23:51] bless you.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in God's house this
[2:23:55] morning, isn't it? Certainly enjoying
[2:23:56] the word of God. While we was having
[2:23:59] song service prior to the message, the
[2:24:01] thought impressed me that we've come to
[2:24:03] celebrate
[2:24:05] a marriage. And I thought, how could
[2:24:07] that be?
[2:24:09] And then it was impressed upon me that
[2:24:12] it was a marriage between God being one
[2:24:15] with his people.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; And uh I certainly enjoyed the word
[2:24:19] today. Isn't it lovely?
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[2:24:26] Heavenly Father,
[2:24:28] what a privilege
[2:24:30] and a high honor it is to speak of you
[2:24:33] as our literal father.
[2:24:36] What a heritage.
[2:24:39] A heritage that is passed on directly
[2:24:41] from you to every young girl, young
[2:24:45] child, boy, teenager, and adult here
[2:24:49] that has received the fullness of your
[2:24:51] presence, the fullness of your revealed
[2:24:53] word. We pray Lord that what's been
