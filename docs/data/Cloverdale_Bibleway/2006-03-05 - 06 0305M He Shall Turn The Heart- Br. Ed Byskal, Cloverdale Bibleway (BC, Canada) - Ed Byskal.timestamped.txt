[14:44] Amen. And we've got a number of requests
[14:46] this morning. I'm going to ask our
[14:47] brother Tom Ray. Brother Tom, if you'd
[14:49] come and open the service in a word of
[14:51] prayer. Um,
[14:57] some testimonies first. Sister Leverne
[15:00] Clemens
[15:02] says, "Uh, I requested prayer for a
[15:04] young man, Grant Gerkin, in Houston,
[15:06] Texas, who had a brain tumor so large it
[15:08] fractured his skull, was very entwined
[15:11] in his brain and optic nerve of both
[15:13] eyes. surgery was on February 22nd. He
[15:16] is doing so well. He is up and about his
[15:19] business. When his dad, who was an
[15:21] officer in a bank, received word by
[15:23] phone that the tumor was not cancerous,
[15:25] he shouted, "Praise God."
[15:28] So loud his shout was heard all over the
[15:31] offices in the bank. His family sends
[15:34] thanks for the prayers.
[15:39] Amen.
[15:42] Brother Nathan, Sister Heidi Davis, want
[15:44] to thank the family of God for all the
[15:46] love they've shown and all the prayers.
[15:48] Our daughter Eliza is doing wonderful
[15:50] for the last 5 days. She's been off the
[15:52] respirator and breathing on her own.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[15:56] [Music]
[16:01] Sister Patty Petting said, "I would like
[16:03] to publicly praise God for my healing.
[16:05] For months, eight or more, I've been
[16:07] plagued with severe pain in my right
[16:09] leg. On Monday, I woke up with
[16:11] absolutely no pain. Praise God. Over and
[16:14] over again. Amen. She wants to thank all
[16:18] those who's prayed. We've got a God who
[16:20] could heal. Amen. Saints, he's here this
[16:22] morning. If you've got a need, we're
[16:24] going to read these needs that have been
[16:27] pinned down here. Sister Diana Johnson
[16:29] is requesting prayer for uh her cousin
[16:32] Sonia. Tomorrow, she's going for a scan
[16:34] test to the brain because of terrible
[16:36] pains that she's having. um uh in her
[16:40] head. Um Sister Norma Smith has been
[16:43] scheduled for a 10 and 1/2 hour cancer
[16:46] surgery tomorrow, March the 6th. Please
[16:49] pray that the Lord will guide the
[16:51] surgeon's hand and all will go well, but
[16:54] above all that the Lord will receive
[16:55] glory. Sister Roxan Hoffman is asking we
[16:59] would continue to pray for her dad.
[17:02] Uh he's supposed to be released from the
[17:04] hospital tomorrow. He was told by the
[17:06] doctor on Friday that the cancer is now
[17:08] in his liver. He's getting around on his
[17:10] own now and able to eat. They want to
[17:12] thank everyone for their prayers and
[17:14] support. Sister Lana requesting prayer
[17:18] for uh her plumber's son Jodie Zestchuck
[17:22] is going in for surgery, brain surgery
[17:24] on March the 21st. Um uh Ed Zeschuk, I
[17:29] guess it's the father, has taken books
[17:31] and take tapes and has asked the church
[17:33] to pray for his son and sister Becca
[17:36] Lamb is requesting prayer for a family.
[17:39] Um
[17:41] because on Thursday, my grandpa Lamb
[17:43] died. So we want to remember
[17:46] uh the Lamb family. Man, if you're here
[17:48] this morning, you've got a need. The
[17:51] Lord knows what it is. If you're on the
[17:53] internet and you've got a need, you just
[17:55] take it before the Lord as you go to
[17:56] prayer now to the top.
[18:00] Only believe, only believe. All things
[18:02] are possible. These are
[18:04] desperate, desperate needs. And I
[18:06] believe that God is able to meet these
[18:09] needs this morning as we go to prayer.
[18:12] Holy,
[18:13] [Music]
[18:18] holy,
[18:20] [Music]
[18:24] all things are possible.
[18:30] Holy,
[18:35] holy,
[18:46] all things are possible.
[18:51] [Music]
[18:58] Father, with my hands,
[19:00] [Music]
[19:02] Lord, over these requests this morning,
[19:06] we believe that all things are possible
[19:08] to them that believe.
[19:11] We've heard the testimonies this morning
[19:13] of your amazing grace.
[19:15] Lord, even as that
[19:18] tumor was growing and cracking a skull,
[19:20] my heart was just moved. And now we hear
[19:23] the report. All is well. What a mighty
[19:26] God we serve this morning. Angels bow
[19:30] before him. Heaven and earth adores him.
[19:33] What a mighty God we serve. All we're
[19:36] saying this morning with my hands on
[19:38] these requests. Once more, Lord, would
[19:41] you move on the behalf of these requests
[19:43] this morning? Once more, Lord, would you
[19:47] touch the hands that are raised in faith
[19:50] to you, Lord? that they could leave the
[19:52] house of God delivered in the name of
[19:55] Jesus Christ. And Lord, we'll give you
[19:58] the glory. We'll give you the praise, do
[20:01] your holy name. For we believe in the
[20:03] power of your resurrection, that you are
[20:06] alive and well, living in me to tell.
[20:10] The resurrected one is here. And so,
[20:13] Father, we're asking that you will come
[20:16] amongst us in a special way from heart
[20:19] to heart. individual to individual that
[20:23] they could praise you this morning as
[20:26] they leave the house of God that they
[20:28] could declare all is well between my
[20:32] soul and the savior. Would you anoint
[20:35] the servant of God, our dear pastor this
[20:38] morning? Anoint the man of God to speak
[20:41] thus saith the word. Lord, that's all
[20:43] we're interested in this morning. That
[20:45] the word become alive to our souls.
[20:48] Bless him, use him, anoint him, Lord,
[20:51] and anoint our ears to hear what the
[20:54] spirit would say to the church. And
[20:56] those that have joined with us, bless
[20:58] them, Lord, on the internet, whatever
[21:00] medium has been used, that they have
[21:03] connected with us, whether it be by
[21:05] phone, whatever way, Lord, by the
[21:07] computer. We pray that you'll move in
[21:09] their rooms, that the same presence that
[21:12] is here would be with them. For we know
[21:16] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[21:18] name, there I will be in your midst. So
[21:22] bless the service. Bless each one we
[21:25] pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.

[31:59] &gt;&gt; He loves the message
[32:01] &gt;&gt; more than we do. It's his word. Amen.
[32:05] Nice to be with you this morning. And uh
[32:09] I kind of wish I was sitting elsewhere
[32:11] and listening to someone else preach.
[32:13] That would have been nice. But here we
[32:14] are standing at the post of duty. And so
[32:17] you pray for me and I've already prayed
[32:19] for the meeting many times. And so I
[32:22] just believe that the Lord will have his
[32:24] way.
[32:26] We're always so thankful for what God is
[32:28] doing. And from week to week, we
[32:30] couldn't uh we couldn't even begin to
[32:34] relate everything that he does. Isn't he
[32:36] wonderful?
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Just so wonderful. Marlo, we heard such
[32:40] a good report of your journey, your
[32:43] trip. my uh what God did with our sister
[32:47] Mara and it's s such a remarkable
[32:50] testimony. We just are so thankful and
[32:55] um cannot express ourselves completely
[32:59] the the supernatural things that God is
[33:02] doing just marvelous. Hallelujah.
[33:06] And that's just such a I'm sure it's
[33:08] such a witness, brother Vile, to you and
[33:11] your family of what God is doing. We
[33:15] hope somehow we can get to hear some of
[33:18] these things that's happening. Amen.
[33:21] Praise the Lord.
[33:24] Hallelujah.
[33:27] Um I'm going to without taking any delay
[33:30] going to turn to the word. Before we do,
[33:33] I'd like to sing. I've been singing for
[33:36] last 2 three days in the presence of
[33:38] Jehovah.
[33:39] And I'd like to have you stand while we
[33:41] sing it. Brother Rod, if you'll help me,

[34:18] in the praise.
[34:20] [Music]
[34:25] We're going to sing it again. But I'd
[34:28] like to say to this waiting
[34:30] congregation, both visible and those
[34:33] that are not visible in the sanctuary,
[34:35] but are with us on the internet, the
[34:38] telephone,
[34:42] there is one here that knows exactly
[34:46] what your need is. And there are hearts
[34:50] that need to be mended.
[34:52] There are lives that need to be
[34:54] delivered.
[34:56] And you know, if it wasn't available,
[34:59] that would be one thing,
[35:02] but it's really sad if someone comes
[35:04] right to the source and doesn't get it.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; The source is here.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; The healer is here. The deliverer is
[35:12] here. Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; If you come oppressed, you come down,
[35:17] downcast,
[35:19] heavy in heart, there's someone here to
[35:21] lift that.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; You believe that with all your heart?
[35:26] We're here in the presence of not of one
[35:28] another. That's one thing. Sometimes we
[35:31] get intimidated being in the presence of
[35:34] one another. Get close and we don't like
[35:36] to open up. But there's somebody here,
[35:39] friends. We want to forget everyone else
[35:42] in the presence of Jehovah. Let's sing
[35:45] it to him. Sing it because we believe
[35:48] it. Let's glorify him
[35:52] in the presence
[35:56] of God of the Lord
[36:04] mighty.
[36:09] on me
[36:18] and heart
[36:24] in the presence
[36:29] of
[36:34] our lovely Lord Jesus.
[36:37] Jehovah Savior,
[36:40] we are so grateful this morning that you
[36:44] so directed our lives in such a way,
[36:47] guided footsteps of those that perhaps
[36:50] were total strangers to us. And by one
[36:54] means or another, you brought the
[36:56] gospel, the light of the message to our
[36:59] hearts. We were in darkened places, oh
[37:03] God. We were in with troubled minds and
[37:07] confused and some may even be in that
[37:09] state today yet. But here you are. And
[37:13] Lord, we acknowledge we're in the
[37:15] presence of the unseen, the invisible
[37:18] God who has manifested himself in no
[37:22] uncertain terms. And you've made
[37:24] yourself known. I pray that this
[37:26] congregation today with one voice will
[37:29] give you praise and glory that is due to
[37:31] you out from their souls. redeemed souls
[37:34] as they have sung a short time ago,
[37:37] redeemed, redeemed. And we can say,
[37:39] Lord, with everything that's in us, we
[37:42] are desiring that you will be present,
[37:45] that you will be glorified. We do not
[37:47] only want to ask you to do these things
[37:51] for us, but we want to serve you, Lord,
[37:54] today. We want to come and lay our lives
[37:56] down as a sacrifice. And we trust that
[37:59] the incense of the sacrifice would be
[38:02] sweet, a sweet smelling savor to you.
[38:05] And now, Lord,
[38:07] [Music]
[38:08] Savior, Master, you're in charge of
[38:11] every detail.
[38:14] And you saw the people as they entered
[38:15] in here. You know precisely where they
[38:18] are spiritually.
[38:21] You know just exactly what they need.
[38:23] And I would ask that you will come.
[38:26] Would you be in attendance with me,
[38:28] Lord? I pray that you will so be the
[38:32] speaker. May it be nothing, Lord, but
[38:34] lips that are dedicated to your service
[38:37] now. Speak by the Holy Spirit, oh God.
[38:42] Go direct to the heart, I pray, and mend
[38:45] that needs to be mended. I pray you'll
[38:48] build us up in the most holy faith, and
[38:51] we will be sure to give you all the
[38:52] praise and glory. I ask Father that
[38:56] every demon power will be bound and cast
[39:01] out from amongst the people that all
[39:04] doubt will leave, all fear will leave,
[39:07] oh God. And may your people be able to
[39:10] just relax and rest in be refreshed
[39:14] today, strengthened in the inner man,
[39:17] and go out from this place, Lord, fit
[39:20] and ready for the life that is before us
[39:23] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take your Bibles if you would,
[39:29] please, and turn to the last book of the
[39:32] Old Testament.
[39:38] We're going to read Malachi 4. It's only
[39:41] six verses long
[39:44] and very familiar to
[39:47] all of us, I'm sure.
[39:54] Malachi before we read Malachi is uh
[39:58] if you were to read the whole book and
[40:03] just kind of digest what God is speaking
[40:06] through the prophet Malachi.
[40:10] it really uh the summary of it would be
[40:14] that the people had gone away from God.
[40:20] And furthermore, they didn't even quite
[40:22] understand that themselves. The people
[40:24] didn't understand that. And they asked,
[40:27] you know, where have we wearied God?
[40:29] Where have we robbed God? where they
[40:32] they they seemed to be completely
[40:34] bewildered
[40:36] at the fact see they weren't only away
[40:39] from God but they had become dull they
[40:42] had become numb to the whole thing and
[40:45] where where have we done these things
[40:48] and so on and God told them in no
[40:50] uncertain terms that not only the people
[40:52] the priests also they've gone away from
[40:55] God
[40:56] and uh so then the third chapter starts,
[41:02] "Behold, I will send my messenger."
[41:04] See, this is the solution
[41:07] to the fact that the people had gone
[41:09] away from God. This was the solution.
[41:11] I'll send my messenger before my face
[41:14] and he'll prepare the way. And and and
[41:17] chapter three, chapter 1 and two tells
[41:20] about how the people gone away from God.
[41:22] Chapter 3 and four tells about how God's
[41:25] going to bring them back. and chapter
[41:27] three for the Old Testament Jews at the
[41:30] end of the Jewish age. And chapter four
[41:32] at the end of the Gentile age, behold,
[41:35] I'll send you Elijah the prophet, and
[41:37] he'll turn the hearts. And so that's
[41:39] where we're going to be reading. For
[41:41] behold,
[41:43] first verse of chapter 4, for behold,
[41:46] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[41:48] oven, and all the proud, yay, and all
[41:52] that do wickedly shall be stubble.
[41:55] And the day that cometh shall burn them
[41:57] up, sayeth the Lord of hosts, and it
[42:00] shall leave them, neither root nor
[42:02] branch. But unto you that fear my name
[42:05] shall the son of righteousness arise
[42:07] with healing in his wings. And you shall
[42:10] go forth and grow up as calves in the
[42:13] stall, and you shall tread down the
[42:15] wicked, for they shall be ashes under
[42:18] the souls of your feet in the day that I
[42:20] shall do this, sayith the Lord of hosts.
[42:23] Remember ye the law of Moses my servant,
[42:26] which I commanded unto him in Horeb, for
[42:29] all Israel, with the statutes and
[42:32] judgments. Behold, I will send you
[42:35] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[42:37] the great and dreadful day of the Lord,
[42:40] and he shall turn the heart of the
[42:42] fathers to the children, and the heart
[42:45] of the children to their fathers, lest I
[42:48] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[42:51] Father, we pray now that you will take
[42:53] your word, this is your word, and that
[42:56] you will indeed break the bread to us,
[42:58] oh master, Lord Jesus, and feed your
[43:01] sheep in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[43:14] Appreciate your
[43:16] full attention this morning. You can
[43:19] rejoice while we preach. It's fine.
[43:23] I want to speak on
[43:26] He
[43:28] shall
[43:30] turn the heart.
[43:35] And he shall turn the heart
[43:40] of the fathers to the children and the
[43:43] heart of the children to their fathers,
[43:46] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[43:49] curse.
[43:51] In both our natural and our spiritual
[43:54] life,
[43:56] either either one or both together, we
[44:00] arrive at
[44:03] junctions,
[44:05] corners,
[44:07] places in our life that are
[44:10] perhaps more critical than the everyday,
[44:15] you know, just the humrum of living. We
[44:17] come to we come to a certain season in
[44:20] our life and uh we're it seems like
[44:23] perhaps we're thrust into it or we are
[44:27] uh we are almost imperceptibly brought
[44:30] into it and we have to we have to make
[44:34] major decisions. Sometimes it crises.
[44:39] Sometimes it's just uh the normal course
[44:41] of life, but we're we're brought into
[44:43] these times and it requires to turn this
[44:47] corner. It requires some very skillful
[44:51] and careful maneuvering to get around
[44:55] the corner. Uh when it comes to driving
[44:59] the highways today,
[45:02] uh a lot of accidents and and uh uh
[45:06] things that happen along the road h
[45:08] actually happen at curves and you'll see
[45:11] signs along the road. Caution and you'll
[45:15] see the wavy sign that's indicating
[45:18] you're coming into an area of a lot of
[45:20] curves and uh you need to be careful.
[45:23] You need to drive with more caution
[45:26] because this is where a lot of this is
[45:29] an accidentprone area and you have to be
[45:32] careful. Corners is where the uh trouble
[45:36] can be and it will will require uh uh a
[45:41] movement where a person has to be
[45:44] skillful and use some dexterity in order
[45:48] to maneuver.
[45:50] the the thing that is being turned here
[45:54] and I need to just draw your attention.
[45:56] He shall
[45:59] turn the heart. If you're turning a
[46:03] vehicle,
[46:05] uh, at least most of the vehicles I
[46:07] would imagine out in the parking lot
[46:09] today have what they would call power
[46:11] steering or their power assisted
[46:15] steering. And that's just simply makes
[46:18] it easier for you to maneuver the the uh
[46:22] couple ton vehicle that you're driving.
[46:24] And uh so it depends on what it is that
[46:27] you need to turn and they try to give
[46:30] you something that would be appropriate
[46:33] to handle that piece of equipment or
[46:35] whatever it might be. you that handle
[46:38] industrial equipment, you know what I
[46:40] speak of when I say that they have they
[46:43] have equipment that is uh that is so uh
[46:48] it it requires to be turned almost at
[46:51] right angles at at 180° and quickly. It
[46:55] can't take a half a mile to do it. You
[46:58] have to turn it very very quickly. So
[47:00] they've got it equipped and they've got
[47:02] the power systems in place so it can
[47:05] articulate itself and turn very very
[47:08] quickly and so it it just depends what
[47:10] it is you are turning and what is the
[47:13] the requirement at the time. Well in
[47:16] this case we're talking about uh not a
[47:20] piece of equipment but we're talking
[47:22] about something else and that is the
[47:23] heart.
[47:25] It takes perhaps a great deal of skill
[47:28] to turn a ship or to turn a piece of
[47:31] equipment, but I can tell you it takes
[47:34] God Almighty to turn the heart.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; And he shall turn the heart,
[47:43] the inner man,
[47:46] the mind. Oh, that mind.
[47:51] Every one of us have it to turn the
[47:53] mind.
[47:55] When Peter preached his first service
[47:57] after being filled with the Holy Spirit
[48:02] and the men were pricricked in their
[48:04] heart and they said, "What must we do to
[48:07] be saved?" Said, "Repent at number one."
[48:12] And the word repent is strictly change
[48:15] your mind. Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't just stand and say,
[48:19] "Okay, I'll change my mind."
[48:21] That's just not possible. I'll just
[48:24] change my mind. No, you can't change
[48:27] your mind in in the in the language that
[48:30] we're speaking of the Bible. It takes
[48:31] God Almighty by the Holy Spirit to come
[48:35] into your in into your being. But when
[48:38] what the scripture is saying here that
[48:40] he shall turn the heart he will turn the
[48:44] heart that this this mind uh there
[48:48] something they were pricricked in their
[48:49] heart. What must we do? Repent and be
[48:53] baptized every one of you in the name of
[48:55] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[48:58] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[49:00] the Holy Ghost. But none of that will
[49:02] happen without the changing of the mind.
[49:05] And there may be some here today that
[49:07] need to say, "God, change my mind.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Bring me to a place of repentance."
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a lot of people that
[49:15] know it's true? They know the word of
[49:17] God is true. They know the message is
[49:19] true. They know that this is the
[49:21] messenger. They know that God sent a
[49:23] prophet. There's too much proof of it,
[49:25] but they haven't had their minds truly
[49:28] changed yet. I'm talking about a
[49:30] repentance. Because repentance doesn't
[49:32] only mean to change your mind. It means
[49:35] also to abhore your past.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; So a lot of people they come to the
[49:41] place where they say yes I I can see
[49:44] that. Yes I believe that. But they don't
[49:47] abhore their past abhore it detest it.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; We must turn from sin or turn from
[49:55] unbelief
[49:56] &gt;&gt; in order to make a full repentance. We
[49:58] abhore our past.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't love what God is
[50:03] leading you into and love your old
[50:05] denomination or your old beliefs or your
[50:07] old way or your old life. You can't love
[50:09] your sinful life
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and walk on with God. You've got to turn
[50:13] from that and turn to him. That is
[50:16] turning. And oh, that's a difficult
[50:19] turn.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; That is a difficult turn. And it takes
[50:23] real skillful working of the Holy
[50:26] Spirit.
[50:28] So the heart is not only the inner man,
[50:31] the mind. It is one's understanding,
[50:35] right? Even down to the soul.
[50:38] It's our knowledge. I just want to stop
[50:41] there a moment. So often you you may
[50:44] even be here this morning and you'll
[50:46] hear things and say, "Well, that isn't
[50:47] what I heard when I was a child or when
[50:50] I went to church or when I went to
[50:52] catechism or when I went to Bible school
[50:54] or when I went when I went to my
[50:56] congregation." That isn't what my uh
[50:58] priest or rabbi or preacher or whatever
[51:01] said. But God didn't say he'll send you
[51:04] a preacher.
[51:06] He didn't say he will send you even a
[51:08] pastor. Said I'll send you a prophet,
[51:11] one to whom the word comes to. And I
[51:14] wouldn't dare declare anything that he
[51:16] hadn't already declared today.
[51:20] So the understanding
[51:22] I came to a place in my own life when I
[51:25] began to hear things in the message I
[51:27] thought wow that's different than I was
[51:30] taught that I understand and then I
[51:34] stopped one day I remember very clearly
[51:36] I came to a place in my life I thought
[51:39] uh
[51:41] where did I learn what I understand what
[51:43] I know where did I learn it I just asked
[51:46] myself that where did I learn where did
[51:48] I get this knowledge that I have. And I
[51:50] thought, well, I learned some of that in
[51:52] Sunday school
[51:54] as a child. I learned some of that in
[51:56] Sunday school. And I learned a lot of
[51:59] that uh just by almost by a process of
[52:02] osmosis.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; I sat in church and I heard this
[52:07] preacher and heard that preacher and it
[52:08] was just kind of what everybody
[52:11] accepted. And so, uh, that's where I
[52:13] gained my knowledge. And then I now I
[52:16] found out I was hearing somebody saying
[52:18] this is thus sayaeth the Lord and I
[52:21] tried to compare that with my
[52:22] understanding and I just figured time to
[52:25] chuck my understanding out.
[52:28] This didn't come with any this didn't
[52:30] come with any vindication at all. This
[52:32] didn't come with any proof whatsoever.
[52:34] This didn't come with thus sayith the
[52:36] Lord. I think I'll just repent
[52:40] &gt;&gt; and turn away from that. And you
[52:42] couldn't give me that for anything
[52:43] today. It has no place in my life.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; So your understanding and the knowledge
[52:52] and your thinking and your reflection
[52:55] and your memory, your inclinations, your
[52:58] resolutions, things that you were so
[53:00] resolute and so determined over, your
[53:03] will and your conscience. That's the
[53:06] heart,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:07] &gt;&gt; You put all of that together and it's a
[53:09] big package.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; And God's got to turn that. Not only
[53:13] that, your heart is the seat of your
[53:16] appetites,
[53:18] your desires,
[53:20] your passions.
[53:22] It's the seat of that right down to the
[53:24] very inner depths. And you got to change
[53:26] your appetite.
[53:28] How many have had their appetite
[53:30] changed? Amen.
[53:32] We've had our appetite changed.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; We got our diet changed.
[53:37] And in the now, he's going to turn that.
[53:41] And to turn that is to move to face in a
[53:47] particular direction.
[53:49] You've been going a certain way, certain
[53:52] belief, certain understanding,
[53:55] certain desire, certain appetite, and we
[53:58] moved in that direction. And now
[54:00] something's something's going to take
[54:02] place that's going to actually turn.
[54:06] You know,
[54:08] some people look upon themselves like
[54:10] the Queen Mary ship.
[54:13] Well, I got a lot of time to turn. I
[54:16] understand it takes a long time to turn
[54:18] a ship.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; No, we haven't got we haven't got days
[54:22] and weeks to to do this.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; When do we turn? When God speaks.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; And the quicker you turn, the better it
[54:31] is. Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; But you don't even know if God's going
[54:34] to give you the space to make the turn.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, next week, we don't know that
[54:41] we have tomorrow.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Now is the day of salvation. Now is the
[54:46] accepted time.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I know that you believe that.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; And so to turn it turn into another
[54:53] direction,
[54:57] a different direction.
[54:59] But in the Hebrew, it's interesting
[55:01] because it can be to turn. Actually, the
[55:05] first meaning in Hebrew is to return.
[55:09] That's the turn. In other words, God is
[55:11] speaking of of people essentially moving
[55:14] away from him. And that's what the book
[55:16] of Malachi is all about. Return or turn
[55:19] back.
[55:21] To turn is to either turn away from God.
[55:24] It's used in that sense to turn away
[55:26] from God or to turn back to God, to
[55:30] repent, but also to refresh and be
[55:34] restored.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Turn back,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; be refreshed. You don't come back all
[55:40] dried up.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You come back refreshed.
[55:45] to turn to be converted to return to the
[55:50] true worship of the true God.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; As I said a moment ago
[56:00] to turn it depends on what it is that
[56:02] you are attempting to turn.
[56:05] So now really the subject I need to move
[56:08] on another step and that is this. What
[56:12] is it that needs to turn
[56:16] and why is the turn necessary
[56:22] in natural life? We have here a lot of
[56:24] young people and a lot of children
[56:27] within the church
[56:29] and uh science will tell you that our
[56:31] bodies are constantly
[56:34] changing from day to day. From the day
[56:36] we're born to the day we die, our bodies
[56:39] change. But there's a period of time
[56:42] when children are changing and they
[56:45] begin to mature biologically and
[56:48] psychologically
[56:50] and emotionally
[56:52] and socially and girls start to grow
[56:56] into womanhood and young men begin to
[57:00] grow into men.
[57:02] And it's a transitional period from
[57:05] childhood to adulthood. And it's a
[57:09] critical time.
[57:12] Those of us who've gone through it, you
[57:14] know that it's a critical time. It's a
[57:16] time when young people, they they know
[57:18] they're not a child anymore. And they
[57:20] know they're not fully adult and they're
[57:23] they're trying to find themselves. And
[57:26] there's young people here that are like
[57:27] that. And it's don't don't think it's
[57:30] strange. It just happens to be part of
[57:32] life. But it is a corner.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; You're turning a corner. And I want to
[57:37] say that even in the natural life,
[57:40] that's where young people that are in
[57:44] good solid Christian homes need, you
[57:48] need to thank God. I'm going through a
[57:50] difficult time, but I thank God. I've
[57:53] got a mother and a father or a mother
[57:56] and a father. Either one. Sometimes you
[57:59] only have one. That's fine. They will
[58:02] stand there with you. But you need to
[58:04] recognize they need to guide me through.
[58:06] they need to help me through this time.
[58:08] And if you haven't, if you don't have
[58:10] that, then I would gra I I I would
[58:13] gravitate to someone else that is
[58:16] strong, that you admire, that can assist
[58:19] you because you're turning a corner. You
[58:22] don't want to get advice from your
[58:24] school friends.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get advice from the
[58:27] world.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get advice at the mall
[58:30] or at the arcade or someplace else. You
[58:32] want to get advice from somebody who has
[58:35] spiritually maneuvered that corner and
[58:37] come out around the other side. Can you
[58:39] say amen?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; It is a corner
[58:43] &gt;&gt; and some have gone around it and some
[58:46] still have to go around it and some are
[58:48] in the midst of the curve right now and
[58:51] you need to skillfully maneuver that
[58:53] corner.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; This is not one you're going to avoid.
[58:57] There's a curve and I'm putting a sign
[59:00] up right now. And some go through it
[59:03] very quickly and some go through it
[59:05] gradually and it takes a much longer
[59:07] period of time, but you will go through
[59:09] it.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And there are some that are I had
[59:13] friends that they had grown children,
[59:16] but I think they were still in the
[59:17] corner.
[59:20] Never did well, I won't say it, but you
[59:24] know what I'm saying.
[59:27] In the message faith once delivered to
[59:29] the saints, brother Brandham says this.
[59:32] Now the faith that was once delivered to
[59:34] the saints if the body of Christ
[59:37] literally when it was in Jesus Christ
[59:39] when that spirit of God was in Christ a
[59:43] little while he said and the world will
[59:45] see me no more. You shall see me for
[59:48] I'll be with you to the end of the
[59:49] world. The works that I do shall you do
[59:52] also even greater than this shall you
[59:54] do. for I go to my father. He said,
[59:57] there you are. That's the faith that was
[1:00:00] once delivered to the saints. And he
[1:00:03] makes this statement. Christian friends,
[1:00:05] let's not be children any longer. He
[1:00:08] wasn't saying it because they weren't
[1:00:10] children. He was saying it because when
[1:00:13] he was speaking and he knew the message
[1:00:15] that he'd been sent, he knew what his
[1:00:17] commission was. He knew he had to take a
[1:00:20] whole
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; and turn them back away from childhood
[1:00:25] as it were
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; to maturity
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; and turn the hearts of the children back
[1:00:31] to the fathers.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, as far as I'm concerned, the
[1:00:38] church world today
[1:00:41] is like playing fun and games.
[1:00:45] Church is not to be a place of
[1:00:47] entertainment. It's to be a place of
[1:00:49] spiritual instruction.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; It's a place where we are to receive
[1:00:54] from God spiritual things.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And we're we're not here just to, you
[1:00:59] know, have a a a social this is not a
[1:01:02] social gathering as such.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Uh it is social, but it's far beyond
[1:01:08] that.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Is to go much beyond that. And so he
[1:01:14] said it, "Let's not be children any
[1:01:16] longer." He said, 'We have no need of
[1:01:19] being children. We're adults. So quit
[1:01:22] running after this and running after
[1:01:24] that and joining this and join that. He
[1:01:27] said, "Come join your heart with the
[1:01:29] word of God."
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come join your heart with
[1:01:33] the word of God. Notice what he's
[1:01:35] calling for. Come join your heart, your
[1:01:38] mind, your conscience, your resolute uh
[1:01:41] your your every part, your inner being,
[1:01:44] your soul, your appetites. Come join
[1:01:46] that with the word of God.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Mature sons and daughters,
[1:01:54] they recognize the condition
[1:01:57] and the uh I will say the environment
[1:02:00] that they're in.
[1:02:03] Brother Brennham talks about the woman
[1:02:05] at the well. He said that woman in fact
[1:02:09] is I was I sat in this service
[1:02:13] in 1961.
[1:02:15] My brother-in-law, brother Brett and
[1:02:17] Anne sat in this service. My wife sat in
[1:02:20] this service.
[1:02:22] But it means more to me today than it
[1:02:24] did then. I don't recall these words.
[1:02:27] And the fact is I was sitting on the
[1:02:28] platform
[1:02:30] and brother Brandham said the woman will
[1:02:32] rise speaking of the woman at the well.
[1:02:34] She will rise in judgment and condemn
[1:02:36] this these generations.
[1:02:39] That ill-famed prostitute raised up and
[1:02:42] said, "Sir,
[1:02:44] I perceive that you are a prophet."
[1:02:49] I thank God for the grace of God because
[1:02:52] I was sitting there and had not fully
[1:02:55] recognized that myself.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I had preached for seven years, but I
[1:03:00] had not fully realized what kind of
[1:03:02] prophet this was. I knew that brother
[1:03:05] Brandham was a prophet, but I knew
[1:03:07] nothing about Malachi 4 till a few days
[1:03:10] after this up in the mountains. He went
[1:03:13] to Malachi 4 with me.
[1:03:18] I can tell you
[1:03:21] I wasn't I wasn't gripped by this the
[1:03:24] charisma of this man.
[1:03:27] We were just there in jeans.
[1:03:30] We were just out with the horses
[1:03:33] and hunting.
[1:03:35] And as we sat there and he just went to
[1:03:38] Malachi. Didn't turn in the Bible. He
[1:03:40] just referred to Malachi.
[1:03:42] He referred to John's ministry and a
[1:03:45] ministry at the end of the age. He
[1:03:48] didn't say it's me. He never said that.
[1:03:51] He just said one that'll turn the hearts
[1:03:52] of the old fathers to the children that
[1:03:54] were born at Pentecost. And now at the
[1:03:56] end of the Gentiles comes a prophet. And
[1:03:59] I'll tell you what, I turned a corner
[1:04:02] that day. Right there. I turned a
[1:04:05] corner. Why? Because I saw it.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I saw it as clear as I'm looking at you.
[1:04:10] I saw it. And it's never changed from
[1:04:13] that day to this.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; It's been as clear as crystal from that
[1:04:16] day to this.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God you need. And it says he
[1:04:23] shall turn the heart. I don't want to
[1:04:24] get ahead of myself, but I want you to
[1:04:26] listen very, very carefully. And he
[1:04:28] said, this woman, she said, I perceive
[1:04:31] that you're a prophet.
[1:04:37] We know, we're taught that the Messiah
[1:04:39] which is called the Christ,
[1:04:42] see she had to move further. The
[1:04:44] anointed one when he comes, he will do
[1:04:47] these signs, but who are you? Woman
[1:04:51] saying, we know that
[1:04:53] we know that when the Messiah has come,
[1:04:55] he will do these things, but who are
[1:04:56] you? He said, "She'll rise up, an
[1:04:59] ill-famed woman, a prostitute, and
[1:05:01] condemn this generation." Because here
[1:05:03] she stood hearing a man, saying, "But
[1:05:06] and I know you're a prophet,
[1:05:09] and I know when Messiah comes, he will
[1:05:11] do these things which he which she was
[1:05:13] seeing done. But who are you?" And Jesus
[1:05:17] said, "I'm he that speaks to you." Upon
[1:05:20] that she left her water plot and ran
[1:05:24] into the city and said to the men of the
[1:05:27] city, "Come see a man
[1:05:32] who told me what I've done. Isn't this
[1:05:36] the very Messiah?"
[1:05:39] He says, "Now, Canadian brethren and
[1:05:41] sisters,
[1:05:43] let's not be children.
[1:05:47] Let's look at the Bible. If that was the
[1:05:50] sign of Messiah yesterday,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; to both Jew and Samaritans,
[1:05:55] would it not be the same sign of Messiah
[1:05:58] to the Gentiles?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Let's not be children. And it takes
[1:06:03] something to move beyond childhood. We
[1:06:07] can't remain in adolescence
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; to receive the full scope of what he's
[1:06:13] saying. It's the sign of Messiah.
[1:06:17] God sent the sign of Messiah
[1:06:20] to the Gentiles.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; I understand this year we're going to
[1:06:32] have the largest graduating class
[1:06:36] of graduates
[1:06:38] graduating out of their 12th senior 12th
[1:06:41] grade or their senior year.
[1:06:44] and they'll be turning a corner
[1:06:48] uh a big a big corner big time and
[1:06:51] finding that you know we'll be launching
[1:06:54] straight into the work world and it's a
[1:06:56] wonderful thing to be able to graduate.
[1:06:58] It's a sense of achievement and all the
[1:07:00] rest of it but you are turning a corner
[1:07:02] and it's important that
[1:07:04] you get the right kind of counsel the
[1:07:06] right kind of direction as you turn that
[1:07:10] corner as well. But friends, spiritually
[1:07:13] speaking,
[1:07:16] and I'm moving along slowly, not because
[1:07:18] of my age. I'm moving along slowly
[1:07:20] because I want to just to get across
[1:07:22] right. We're sitting here in service
[1:07:25] this morning, but I feel and I have a
[1:07:30] great awareness
[1:07:31] that where we are in the message today,
[1:07:35] we're arriving at a graduation time. And
[1:07:38] the graduation time I'm talking about is
[1:07:40] a change of this body.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And we will need some skillful
[1:07:48] maneuvering. Nothing you can do,
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; but you need to have yourself in a place
[1:07:53] where God can do it
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; with your heart open
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; with your mind
[1:08:00] receptive
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; and all obstacles out of the way.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; We're coming to graduation, friends.
[1:08:08] and this graduation. You don't want to
[1:08:10] flub up on.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be
[1:08:16] kind of uncertain at this time. You want
[1:08:19] to know. You want to be able to stand up
[1:08:21] and say, "I know in whom I have
[1:08:24] believed.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; I know the word that I believe. I know
[1:08:28] the scripture. I know where my feet are
[1:08:30] planted."
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The revelation has been
[1:08:34] clear to me.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I'm not in any I'm not
[1:08:38] in any quandry about what I believe.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; It's a little bit of a different of a
[1:08:55] service, but if you allow me to give it
[1:08:59] to you the way it has come to me.
[1:09:02] Brother Brandham went into a psychiatric
[1:09:05] ward
[1:09:07] and he said, "When I went into the
[1:09:09] psychopathic room
[1:09:12] and there was a young lady that as he
[1:09:15] came in, this young lady said to him,"
[1:09:17] she was about 20 years old and she said,
[1:09:20] "Are you brother Brandham?" And he said,
[1:09:22] "Yes, I am."
[1:09:24] And she said, "Well, would you do me
[1:09:26] first?"
[1:09:29] He said, 'Why? He says, 'You're not in
[1:09:32] the psychopathic ward. You're not here,
[1:09:34] are you?' She said, 'Yes, I'm supposed
[1:09:37] to be.
[1:09:40] He said, well, you're such a pretty
[1:09:42] young woman. Looked to be about 20 years
[1:09:45] old. Looked like she'd have made any
[1:09:48] little minister
[1:09:50] a little jewel, a little sweetheart.
[1:09:54] And I said, "Tell me your story."
[1:09:58] We're talking about turning corners.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Well, I was raised in a
[1:10:03] strict Christian home."
[1:10:06] And I would say
[1:10:09] many of us can identify with that. And
[1:10:13] one time I started again against my
[1:10:15] parents' better judgment.
[1:10:18] So I started going with a boy that
[1:10:20] packed a flask in his pocket.
[1:10:23] In case you don't know what a flask is,
[1:10:26] he packed some liquor in his pocket. And
[1:10:29] one night he persuaded me to take a
[1:10:32] drink. I'm going to talk about two
[1:10:35] corners now. And this is one she turned.
[1:10:39] It didn't take her long. It was just one
[1:10:41] evening.
[1:10:42] And he persuaded me to take a drink and
[1:10:46] said, "Finally, I had taken the one
[1:10:48] drink."
[1:10:50] And all of them was telling me that I
[1:10:53] was a wallflower if I didn't do this.
[1:10:57] I'm just a wallflower if you don't do
[1:10:59] this.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; So she took her drink
[1:11:03] and the first thing you know I got the
[1:11:06] habit of drinking. Now she'd been
[1:11:10] introduced to the corner by a young man
[1:11:13] and she turned the curve and when she
[1:11:15] got around the corner she found that she
[1:11:18] was headed in another direction. And now
[1:11:20] she became an alcoholic and she was a
[1:11:23] she was a she got the habit of drinking.
[1:11:30] And she said then I started public
[1:11:32] prostitution
[1:11:34] and they sent me to the good sheeperd
[1:11:36] home which is a Catholic institution
[1:11:39] and I served my time there three or four
[1:11:42] years
[1:11:44] and turned to be a Catholic.
[1:11:47] When I came out of this institution, she
[1:11:49] said, "Then I was a Catholic. I started
[1:11:52] right back to drinking and prostitution
[1:11:55] again, the law picked me up and gave me
[1:11:59] four years in the woman's penitentiary.
[1:12:02] And when I came out, it didn't do me one
[1:12:05] bit of good. I joined another church.
[1:12:08] I've joined two or three churches. And
[1:12:11] now they finally have declared me insane
[1:12:15] and said they they just watched me said
[1:12:17] I am a mental case.
[1:12:20] Why? I said
[1:12:23] you certainly don't talk like a mental
[1:12:25] case
[1:12:27] trying to find her spirit. Oh fret.
[1:12:32] What grace
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; a lot of women were in institutions.
[1:12:37] Yeah,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; a lot of women
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; were in prostitution. A lot of women
[1:12:41] were drunkards.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And here's one woman of the earth that
[1:12:46] has Elijah prophet
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; sitting with her.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] You certainly don't talk like a mental
[1:12:57] case. He's trying to find her spirit.
[1:13:02] And I said, now watch. Now, a young man
[1:13:06] brought her to a corner
[1:13:08] and he had a flask in his pocket and
[1:13:11] Godard turned that corner and now here's
[1:13:14] a prophet with a completely different in
[1:13:17] motive and different purpose and he's
[1:13:19] going to bring her to a corner. Watch
[1:13:21] now how he does it. And I said, "Have
[1:13:24] you ever thought of getting married
[1:13:28] and having a loving husband
[1:13:31] and little babies
[1:13:34] and all that?" Like all real mothers
[1:13:36] long or real women like to have little
[1:13:39] ones. What's he doing? He's quoting
[1:13:43] this.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; He's quoting this for a young woman. And
[1:13:47] she said, "And see your little girl
[1:13:50] pushing a little baby cart with a little
[1:13:54] dolly in it."
[1:13:56] Can you imagine a prophet who could be
[1:13:59] speaking to half a million people is
[1:14:00] here talking to a woman? A young woman
[1:14:03] insane institute. Wouldn't you like to
[1:14:06] be married? Wouldn't you like to have a
[1:14:08] loving husband? Wouldn't you like to
[1:14:10] have babies? Wouldn't you like to have
[1:14:13] see a little girl pushing a cart with a
[1:14:15] dolly in it? Doesn't sound profound,
[1:14:18] does it? But he's turning a corner.
[1:14:25] And she said, "Oh yes,
[1:14:28] I thought about that, Brother Brandon,
[1:14:30] but said, who would have me?
[1:14:34] What could I promise a man?
[1:14:37] Not even a home. I'm no good."
[1:14:41] And after she talked a few moments, the
[1:14:43] vision struck
[1:14:45] and I saw then where it was. And I said,
[1:14:48] "Young lady, did it ever to occur to you
[1:14:51] that all these things, these reformings
[1:14:54] and these turning of pages
[1:14:58] and so forth, we're not turning a page.
[1:15:01] Turning a page won't do it.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; It's got to be turning the heart.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; That's a different thing.
[1:15:11] and all this ritualistic routine of
[1:15:14] joining one church and another and
[1:15:16] making vows and so forth. And she said,
[1:15:18] "Yes, sir, it has." And I said, "Did you
[1:15:21] ever think that it was the devil that's
[1:15:24] making you do those things that you
[1:15:26] don't want to do?" And she said, "Mr.
[1:15:30] Brandom I've always believed that you
[1:15:33] know sometime we there are people know
[1:15:35] that what I'm doing is not correct but
[1:15:37] they they don't identify and say that's
[1:15:40] the devil
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; and even as believers sometime we think
[1:15:45] well that's just me. No you need to
[1:15:47] identify he's your enemy
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; and he's a devil. He want to keep you
[1:15:52] out of heaven. That's what he wants to
[1:15:53] do. He wants to keep you out of the
[1:15:55] blessings of life.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Said that's the devil. She said, "I
[1:16:00] always have believed that."
[1:16:04] And she said though, he said, "Those
[1:16:06] black eyes flashed."
[1:16:08] And I said, "That's what it is, sister.
[1:16:11] You couldn't sign pledges or join
[1:16:13] churches enough if you had books as high
[1:16:15] as this building.
[1:16:17] Would never do you one bit of good. It's
[1:16:19] the devil that's driving you to those
[1:16:21] things, making you do those things."
[1:16:23] He's taking around the corner.
[1:16:27] Oh, what a curve
[1:16:30] from the life being in a mental
[1:16:32] institute.
[1:16:34] Look what she faced every day. Look at
[1:16:36] the life she faced. Look at the record
[1:16:39] that she had.
[1:16:41] And I said, "Here in your heart, you are
[1:16:46] telling me." Notice what he identifies.
[1:16:48] Here in your heart, what does the
[1:16:51] prophet messenger identify? Her heart
[1:16:53] here in your heart. drawing her full
[1:16:56] attention to her heart. You are telling
[1:16:58] me that you'd love to be married and
[1:17:00] you'd love to have a husband. And I
[1:17:03] said, "You're a beautiful girl. You'd
[1:17:05] make a sweetheart for some little tired
[1:17:07] preacher of God." And she said, "I
[1:17:10] couldn't promise a preacher, no one
[1:17:12] else, nothing in this condition, Mr.
[1:17:14] Brandom." And I said, "But I want to
[1:17:16] tell you something. Your sins may be be
[1:17:19] as black and smutty as hell, but I know
[1:17:21] that there's a fountain filled with
[1:17:23] blood, drawn from Emanuel's veins, where
[1:17:28] sinners plunge beneath that flood, lose
[1:17:30] all their guilty stains.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You'll be as white as snow, he said. She
[1:17:36] said, "Oh, it seems like it just could
[1:17:38] be a myth,
[1:17:40] Mr. Brandom."
[1:17:42] She said, "I want to be that." And I
[1:17:44] said, "Will you pray with me?" She said,
[1:17:47] "Yes, sir."
[1:17:50] She turned around, knelt down at the
[1:17:52] chair
[1:17:54] where she was at, and I knelt at the
[1:17:55] other on the other side, and I said,
[1:17:58] "Now you pray."
[1:18:01] See, she could pray for herself.
[1:18:04] So I said, "You pray." And she prayed
[1:18:06] real sincerely. And I just held still,
[1:18:10] feeling if the spirit went away from
[1:18:13] her.
[1:18:15] But after a bit, she rose up and she
[1:18:17] said, "Mr. Brandom, I'm going to take
[1:18:20] your hand and make you a promise that
[1:18:23] from this day henceforth, I'll never
[1:18:26] smoke again. I'll never drink again. Or
[1:18:28] I'll never play the part of a prostitute
[1:18:31] again." And I said, "I believe, my
[1:18:33] sister, that you mean that,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; but it's not over yet."
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Nice to have somebody even tell you when
[1:18:44] you don't know. You're not around the
[1:18:46] corner yet.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; You haven't made it around the corner
[1:18:50] yet.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; You've done that so many times, but it
[1:18:55] isn't over yet.
[1:18:57] there is there's there has to be
[1:19:00] something happen. And she said, "What do
[1:19:02] you mean, Mr. Brandom?" And I said,
[1:19:04] "Kneel back down and just keep praying."
[1:19:09] And I put my hand over on her shoulder
[1:19:11] and I began to pray and I said, "Lord
[1:19:14] God, you made this woman this way. She h
[1:19:18] she is a handmade
[1:19:21] and and she could be your servant. She
[1:19:23] could be a wife to some good man. She's
[1:19:26] a beautiful woman and you can help her,
[1:19:28] Lord. And the devil has bound her and I
[1:19:31] pray thee, Lord God, make him to leave
[1:19:33] her. And she continued to pray and all
[1:19:36] of a sudden she be to change her notes
[1:19:38] in her prayer.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a different I can tell
[1:19:44] you that that is true. Yes.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And some of you may be not just young
[1:19:50] people, but to many here, it may be that
[1:19:53] prayer is a bit of a strange thing or a
[1:19:56] ritualistic thing. You need to pray. You
[1:20:00] need to stay there until your language
[1:20:02] begins to change. And then you realize
[1:20:05] that that's not me anymore. That is
[1:20:07] something that is from deep within. I'm
[1:20:10] saying things that I wouldn't normally
[1:20:12] say. I'm saying phrases that are not
[1:20:14] unique to my own person. And you realize
[1:20:17] then that God has taken over in the
[1:20:19] vessel. And you're calling out out of
[1:20:21] sincerity sometimes out of desperation.
[1:20:25] You're you're you're speaking things
[1:20:27] that God is sending. And and the Holy
[1:20:29] Spirit is speaking those things. And as
[1:20:33] she began to pray,
[1:20:35] says that her her notes and her prayer
[1:20:38] had changed. In other words, she struck
[1:20:41] a home run.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe in staying there till you
[1:20:46] strike a home run.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And something happened and she turned
[1:20:51] all of a sudden and looked at me with
[1:20:52] those big staring eyes like an angel
[1:20:56] then and the tears running down her
[1:20:57] cheeks. She jumped to her feet and said,
[1:20:59] "Sir, I've never felt this way in all my
[1:21:03] life."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Now it's over.
[1:21:08] Now I want to say to the congregation
[1:21:10] now she was around the corner.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Oh thank God for his grace.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; It's a reality my brother my sister.
[1:21:18] It's a reality. And I'm not preaching
[1:21:21] this here for my health. I'm preaching
[1:21:22] this to this congregation. Some might be
[1:21:25] in the midst of a a curve right now. You
[1:21:28] might be in the midst of a curve.
[1:21:29] Perhaps not this kind of a curve. But
[1:21:31] you got to get around the curve. And you
[1:21:33] need the leadership. You need the skill
[1:21:35] of the Holy Spirit to guide you through
[1:21:37] it. And God is sending this word to you
[1:21:39] today so that you'll know that he's here
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; and he's prepared.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; He knows what's around the corner. We
[1:21:47] have such a friend.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; We do indeed.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a sound of warning. You
[1:21:55] think that you can find your own way?
[1:21:57] This is not a do-it-yourself program.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot find your own way. You cannot
[1:22:03] guide your own life. People feel, "I'm
[1:22:06] strong enough and I know all about it."
[1:22:08] I tell you, you're headed for a wreck.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You're not going to maneuver the curve.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And that's where a lot of bad accidents
[1:22:15] happen is they didn't make the corner.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Couldn't make the curve.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And he said that's been about six years
[1:22:25] ago. She's married now and has two fine
[1:22:28] children. said she was a prostitute
[1:22:31] until that time and that time when
[1:22:33] Christ took a hold. She was a good girl
[1:22:36] until the evil took a hold. But from
[1:22:39] that time,
[1:22:41] Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; I think that is I read that and and gave
[1:22:46] that in that kind of detail because I
[1:22:48] feel that that there's some uh striking
[1:22:52] principles that are there.
[1:22:56] I can tell you worldly friends, people
[1:22:59] that are out in the world
[1:23:02] that influence a believer,
[1:23:06] Satan has his his instruments and his
[1:23:09] tools to try to get you to turn a curve,
[1:23:13] a bad one, in a wrong direction.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; I thank God for people that are
[1:23:20] concerned. I thank God for the body of
[1:23:22] Christ. I thank God for godly people. I
[1:23:26] thank God for the messenger.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; I thank God for godly families.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And your influence. And I
[1:23:35] say stand strong
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; and be a powerful influence where you
[1:23:39] are. You don't know. You know this. When
[1:23:43] you read what brother Brandham said to
[1:23:44] this woman, it doesn't sound like it was
[1:23:46] a lot of profound counseling, but it was
[1:23:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; the way he did things.
[1:23:52] Amen.
[1:23:58] Now, Brother Brandham says this.
[1:24:01] We're building a building. I'm taking a
[1:24:03] little different direction now. I want
[1:24:04] you to remain real
[1:24:08] attentive for a few more moments.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; We're building a building, not a wall.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; The builders want to take a Now, here
[1:24:17] here he is. This is later in the
[1:24:20] ministry. And the message was, "Who do
[1:24:22] you say this is?" That's what he asked
[1:24:25] the disciples. And that was the that was
[1:24:28] the critical point with the woman at the
[1:24:31] well,
[1:24:33] who she thought he was. And it's still
[1:24:36] just as important today.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Who do you think this is?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Who is it that has done for you
[1:24:46] whatever has taken place in your life?
[1:24:49] Who is it that did it? Say, "Well, I go
[1:24:51] to Cloverdale Bible Way. If Cloverdale
[1:24:53] Bible Way did it, it's not it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; You haven't gone around the corner.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Church can't do it. Friends can't do it.
[1:25:00] Family can't do it. Parents can't do it.
[1:25:02] That's all wonderful. That might be part
[1:25:05] of it, but that's not it. I could say
[1:25:07] what Brother Vanom said. You're not
[1:25:08] around yet. It's not over yet.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; If you've had a life up and down and up
[1:25:12] and down and in and out and in and out,
[1:25:14] I'm saved today. I'm lost tomorrow. All
[1:25:15] the rest of it, you haven't. You're not
[1:25:17] around the corner yet. But we're here to
[1:25:18] help you around that corner.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I want to do business for God today.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Is this congregation with me?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; We want to do business for God.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "The builders want to take a
[1:25:36] line of blocks and just go straight
[1:25:38] down." Why? Because, and this is what
[1:25:40] he's talking about. He's talking people
[1:25:43] that were in all kinds of denominations
[1:25:45] and they set their set the direction
[1:25:47] they're going and they just keep going
[1:25:48] in a straight line. He says, "We're not
[1:25:50] building a wall. We're not we're not
[1:25:52] establishing a denomination just going
[1:25:54] on and on and on forever. That's not
[1:25:56] what we're doing. That won't build the
[1:25:58] building of God." He was telling them
[1:26:00] they understood what he was saying.
[1:26:01] We're not building a wall. We're
[1:26:03] building because actually the
[1:26:06] denominations became a bunch of walls.
[1:26:09] We're not building a wall.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And the walls had separated the people.
[1:26:13] We're not building them. He wanted those
[1:26:15] walls to come down.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; We're not building a wall. We're
[1:26:18] building a building.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; And so he said, he said, "Now any
[1:26:23] builder can build that, but it takes a
[1:26:25] real master mechanic to turn a corner."
[1:26:32] He says, 'When you get to cut the
[1:26:34] corner, some are here in the
[1:26:36] construction industry, and I can tell
[1:26:38] you that you just build a straight wall
[1:26:41] that's that's relatively simple, but
[1:26:44] when you want to start turning corners
[1:26:47] or perhaps more complex corners and the
[1:26:50] other thing, corners are expensive. They
[1:26:53] you count more corners in a building or
[1:26:54] in a house, it that's where there's
[1:26:57] expense associated with that. And I can
[1:26:59] tell you that the temple of God is not
[1:27:02] something that's just been thrown
[1:27:03] together. It's been masterfully designed
[1:27:06] and put together. And he said, "We're
[1:27:09] building a we're building a building."
[1:27:10] He says, "When you get a to when you got
[1:27:13] to cut the corner, that's a time it
[1:27:15] shows whether you're really a stonemason
[1:27:17] or not. When you can turn the corner
[1:27:19] with it and keep the continuity of the
[1:27:22] rest of the building. when you can turn
[1:27:25] a corner and keep the continuity. That's
[1:27:28] that's one of the most marvelous things
[1:27:30] of this message is that it has
[1:27:32] continuity. You can find it and anchor
[1:27:35] it in Genesis and in Exodus and
[1:27:38] Leviticus and Deuteronomy and Joshua and
[1:27:41] Judges all the way through to
[1:27:43] Revelation. You can anchor it because it
[1:27:46] had continuity with the rest of the
[1:27:48] building. Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "And now it's on these corners
[1:27:55] is when the trouble comes, and the
[1:27:57] builders want to keep building on down,
[1:28:00] but we're not building a wall, but a
[1:28:03] building." Ephesians, Paul says in
[1:28:05] Ephesians, "In whom ye also are builded
[1:28:07] together for an habitation of God
[1:28:10] through the spirit."
[1:28:13] And if he Paul says further in Hebrews
[1:28:16] and I just want to launch from here for
[1:28:17] the next short while to the end of the
[1:28:20] service. He said wherefore Hebrews 3:1
[1:28:23] Wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[1:28:25] heavenly calling consider the apostle
[1:28:28] and high priest of our profession Jesus
[1:28:31] Christ who was faithful to him that
[1:28:33] appointed him as also Moses was faithful
[1:28:37] in all his house. I want you to just
[1:28:40] catch that. as Moses was faithful in all
[1:28:43] his house.
[1:28:46] Now, Paul is not talking about Moses'
[1:28:50] children and his wife.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; He's talking about his ministry to the
[1:28:56] people that God used him to call out. He
[1:29:00] says he's faithful to all of his house.
[1:29:03] And then he goes on to say, "For this
[1:29:06] man was counted worthy of more glory
[1:29:08] than Moses, in as much as he who builded
[1:29:11] the house hath more honor than the
[1:29:14] house. For every house is builded by
[1:29:18] some man, but he that built all things
[1:29:21] is God."
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Moses is attributed to having built the
[1:29:28] house. But
[1:29:31] Paul is saying God, it's God that builds
[1:29:34] all things.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Now hold on to it. And Moses verily was
[1:29:39] faithful in all his house as a servant
[1:29:43] for a testimony of those things which
[1:29:46] were to be spoken after. So what Moses
[1:29:49] did was to be spoken. It was something
[1:29:52] that uh reflected or showed what would
[1:29:57] come after. That's what Paul is saying
[1:29:59] here. But Christ as a son over his own
[1:30:03] house whose house we are. You are
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; the house of Christ.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And and he says whose house we are if we
[1:30:13] hold fast the confidence and the
[1:30:16] rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
[1:30:20] And Jesus said in Matthew which we know
[1:30:22] so very very well,
[1:30:24] I will build my church and the gates of
[1:30:28] hell shall not prevail against it. Now
[1:30:31] God gave an example here said that Moses
[1:30:34] was faithful in all of his house. But
[1:30:38] here's one now. He said it's greater
[1:30:40] than Moses and greater than the house
[1:30:43] because he's the builder of the house
[1:30:45] and we are his house. You're the temple
[1:30:49] of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:51] when the construction of the tabernacle.
[1:30:54] And now
[1:30:57] I'm going to turn bit of a corner. You
[1:31:00] want to think real deep.
[1:31:03] I want to go back to the tabernacle when
[1:31:05] it was finished. And as the construction
[1:31:08] of the tabernacle which Paul said here
[1:31:11] now is a type an example when it was
[1:31:15] completed and all the sacred things were
[1:31:19] put in their specific place. They were
[1:31:22] placed in their certain order. It was
[1:31:26] Moses that was ordained of God to set
[1:31:30] the things in order.
[1:31:35] turning the corner for Israel from not
[1:31:38] even having a tabernacle
[1:31:42] to having a place where God said, and I
[1:31:45] hope you can catch the importance of
[1:31:48] this. This was a major corner for
[1:31:52] Israel. They had no place that was a a a
[1:31:56] central focus place like the tabernacle.
[1:31:59] The tabernacle, friends, is not just a
[1:32:02] structure. A tabernacle was a place.
[1:32:06] Have them build me a sanctuary so I can
[1:32:09] be among them.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, what would you think if if I was
[1:32:15] able to say here, God of heaven appeared
[1:32:18] to me uh yesterday and told me that we
[1:32:20] as a congregation are to do such and
[1:32:22] such and such and such and you had that
[1:32:25] kind of confidence in what I would say
[1:32:27] and I wouldn't tell you a lie and say
[1:32:29] we're to do a certain thing. God says
[1:32:31] because I want to come down amongst you.
[1:32:33] I want to be there and I want to dwell
[1:32:35] with you.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And this is going to cost us some
[1:32:39] effort, cost us some money, cost us some
[1:32:42] time. There'd be at least I would say
[1:32:45] perhaps the most of you would have
[1:32:46] confidence enough to say we believe what
[1:32:48] brother Ed has said and we're going to
[1:32:50] go ahead and do that. Well, the people
[1:32:52] had to believe in Moses and and and now
[1:32:55] this was turning a major corner because
[1:32:57] God is saying you build this tabernacle.
[1:33:00] you build a sanctuary and I'm going to
[1:33:02] dwell there with the people. I'm going
[1:33:05] to be there with them.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; And so they begin to assemble the whole
[1:33:09] thing and and you'll find that all
[1:33:10] through Exodus. And now they come to the
[1:33:12] end of of Exodus. And if you have your
[1:33:14] Bible still handy, would you please turn
[1:33:16] to Exodus the 40th chapter.
[1:33:20] I'll give you a moment.
[1:33:37] as we read this. Now, listen.
[1:33:41] Don't read ahead of me, please.
[1:33:44] We're going to start right at the very
[1:33:45] first.
[1:33:48] And as we read this, I want you to think
[1:33:50] of the text and the whole
[1:33:55] title of the service. He shall turn.
[1:34:00] He shall not might, not hope to, not if,
[1:34:08] he shall. Let me tell you something,
[1:34:11] friends. To me, this is such an
[1:34:13] absolute. For every elected seed of God
[1:34:16] that is truly elected of God, there is
[1:34:19] no way but what their heart was going to
[1:34:22] be turned by this message in the
[1:34:23] messenger.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; He has been called and ordained of God
[1:34:30] to turn the heart from wherever you were
[1:34:33] and whatever you were in. If you are an
[1:34:35] elected of God, that message is going to
[1:34:38] turn you. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And the Lord And the Lord spake unto
[1:34:46] Moses, saying,
[1:34:48] "On the first day of the month shalt
[1:34:51] thou set up the tabernacle."
[1:34:54] You'll do this, Moses of the 10 of the
[1:34:57] congregation. Verse three, "And thou
[1:35:00] shalt put therein the ark of the
[1:35:02] testimony, and cover the ark with the
[1:35:05] veil." Moses. Now, as we're reading, I'm
[1:35:09] going to make comments. Moses, you
[1:35:12] there's two million people there. Now,
[1:35:14] Moses perhaps physically didn't do it
[1:35:17] all. But the word, this this corner that
[1:35:20] this people was turning from being
[1:35:22] without a tabernacle to having a
[1:35:25] tabernacle, without having a place where
[1:35:28] God would be, without having a mercy
[1:35:30] seat, to having a mercy seat, that's a
[1:35:32] big corner.
[1:35:34] to having a place where the pillar of
[1:35:37] fire would be to not having one. That
[1:35:40] was a big corner.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And Moses and there was no one else.
[1:35:44] There wasn't another person within the
[1:35:46] two million people. That was the only
[1:35:48] one. And thou shalt do it and you shall
[1:35:50] set it up
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; and you shall bring the ark. In other
[1:35:53] words, you'll bring the word in there.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; This prophet's going to bring the word
[1:35:59] in there. Not another soul could do it.
[1:36:01] He was the one-man ministry that was
[1:36:04] going to bring it in there.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; And you will cover the ark with the
[1:36:09] veil. And I can't hardly hold this, but
[1:36:12] in this day, another prophet was sent
[1:36:14] and says, "You shall uncover it.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; You shall unveil the word. You shall
[1:36:19] take the veil away. You shall take the
[1:36:22] mystery of God out of it, and you'll
[1:36:24] make it clear to the people, and you
[1:36:26] shall turn their heart."
[1:36:28] [Applause]
[1:36:30] Hallelujah.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt bring in the table and
[1:36:39] set in order the things that are to be
[1:36:41] set upon it. Verse five, and thou shalt
[1:36:44] set the altar of gold and the incense
[1:36:46] before the ark of the testimony. Verse
[1:36:48] six, and thou shalt set the altar of the
[1:36:52] burnt offering. In verse 7, and thou
[1:36:55] shalt set the labor between the tent of
[1:36:57] the congregation and the altar, and down
[1:36:59] to verse 12, please. And thou shalt
[1:37:02] bring Aaron and his sons unto the door
[1:37:05] of the tabernacle of the congregation,
[1:37:07] and wash them with water. He shall he
[1:37:10] shall establish the ministry. In other
[1:37:12] words, he will establish. There's
[1:37:14] another order for the ministry. This was
[1:37:16] the sole responsibility of this prophet
[1:37:19] of God who was the messenger to them at
[1:37:22] that time. There was no one else that
[1:37:23] could do it. You shall bring them in.
[1:37:26] You shall set them in order. You shall
[1:37:28] wash them with water. Verse 13. And thou
[1:37:31] shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments.
[1:37:34] You're going to clothe him. And you're
[1:37:36] going to anoint him and sanctify him
[1:37:39] that he may be a minister unto me in the
[1:37:41] priest's office. Without that, Aaron
[1:37:43] could not do it. Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt, verse 14, and thou shalt
[1:37:50] bring his sons, and clothe them with
[1:37:53] coats, and thou shalt anoint them. Verse
[1:37:55] 15, as thou did anoint their father,
[1:37:58] that they may minister unto me in the
[1:38:00] priest's office, for their anointing
[1:38:03] shall surely be an everlasting
[1:38:05] priesthood throughout their
[1:38:06] generations." And thus did Moses
[1:38:09] according to all that the Lord commanded
[1:38:12] him. So did he. And he took he took and
[1:38:16] put the testimony into the ark. He put
[1:38:19] the testimony. He put the word of God
[1:38:21] into the ark and set the staves on the
[1:38:24] ark and put the mercy seat upon it. Now
[1:38:26] notice verse 21. And he brought the ark.
[1:38:29] He brought the ark into the tabernacle
[1:38:33] and set up the veil of the covering and
[1:38:36] covered the ark of the testimony as the
[1:38:39] Lord had commanded him. And he put the
[1:38:42] table in the tent of the congregation
[1:38:45] upon the side of the tabernacle north
[1:38:47] without the veil. And he reared up the
[1:38:49] court around about the tabernacle and
[1:38:52] the altar and set up the hanging of the
[1:38:54] court gate. So Moses finished the work.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Can I say Moses turned the corner?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Moses led Israel and turned the corner.
[1:39:07] And this whole chapter is just a
[1:39:09] summation of all that was taking place
[1:39:12] through wrote we can say, "Oh, I I heard
[1:39:15] this message today and I heard that
[1:39:17] message and another message, etc." Let
[1:39:19] me say to you as a congregation, it all
[1:39:22] it's all summarized in these few words.
[1:39:25] I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he
[1:39:28] shall turn the heart.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; He shall when you read a message that is
[1:39:37] part of the turning to turn people from
[1:39:39] their darkness to turn people out of
[1:39:42] their confusion.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And people might say, well, I I don't
[1:39:46] agree with one man. That's beside the
[1:39:48] point. And you have a you have your
[1:39:51] dispute with God Almighty. It's God who
[1:39:53] said in chapter 3 of of Malachi, I'll
[1:39:57] send I will send my messenger and he
[1:40:01] shall prepare the way. Who would ever
[1:40:03] stand up and say John the Baptist didn't
[1:40:05] fulfill it? He did indeed.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the danger of the
[1:40:09] people today and happy to look back and
[1:40:12] say, "Oh yeah, he did it, but I don't
[1:40:13] believe it happened in my time. I
[1:40:15] believe I can tell you it already
[1:40:16] happened to your time." And people that
[1:40:18] don't believe that are too late. You're
[1:40:20] too late. You've already lost it. You're
[1:40:22] already in already going straight down
[1:40:25] the line without turning the corner.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Elijah turned the corner.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; A major corner. This structure may look
[1:40:33] like a church building. We may have
[1:40:35] microphones and music and music and
[1:40:37] singers and and a congregation and and
[1:40:39] take tithes and offerings and have
[1:40:41] missions and all the rest of it. It may
[1:40:43] appear have the same outward appearance
[1:40:45] as Israel had the same appearance as
[1:40:47] being another nation. But they weren't
[1:40:49] another nation. They weren't just
[1:40:51] another nation.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; They had a leader, yes, but their leader
[1:40:56] was not like the other leaders.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I hope hope I'm able to get this
[1:41:03] across to you.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; This message is not the same. It may
[1:41:07] have the appearance you've got a group
[1:41:09] of people, you got a church, you got
[1:41:10] ministers, and whatever more. It is not
[1:41:13] the same as any other.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And no wise can be the same. Why?
[1:41:19] Because the one that God has sent, we
[1:41:21] are here as a product of a certain
[1:41:23] phrase of scripture. He shall turn the
[1:41:27] heart of the children back to the
[1:41:29] fathers.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And we are now a people that he has
[1:41:32] turned back. And we can say he the
[1:41:35] messenger of the day. He gave the order
[1:41:38] of the church.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; He set the table where it's supposed to
[1:41:42] be. He set the candlestick where it's
[1:41:44] supposed to be. He put the deacons where
[1:41:46] they're supposed to be. He put the
[1:41:48] Sunday school teachers where they're
[1:41:50] supposed to be. He did these things.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; How? By the message. By the word that
[1:41:55] came out of the mouth.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You think we put too much importance on
[1:41:59] a man? Tell God that.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Tell God he shouldn't have sent Moses.
[1:42:03] Tell God he shouldn't have had Samuel.
[1:42:05] Tell God he shouldn't have had Isaiah.
[1:42:07] Tell God he shouldn't have had Jeremiah.
[1:42:09] Those were one man ministries. God's
[1:42:11] always done that.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And look where all our uh uh uh shall we
[1:42:17] say gathering or accumulation of
[1:42:19] leadership worth taking. Where's the
[1:42:21] United where's the ecumenical council
[1:42:23] taking the world?
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; No place.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to the slaughter. This
[1:42:28] messenger said
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; take him to a slaughter.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; You think they believe that? Not for a
[1:42:34] second. And if you're here and you doubt
[1:42:36] that, then shame on you. Here's come a
[1:42:39] vindicated messenger. Yes.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that no one else but
[1:42:43] but God himself and and Christ was the
[1:42:46] builder. That's why the pillar of fire.
[1:42:49] As soon as Moses was done this, you have
[1:42:51] to help me now so I can finish cuz now I
[1:42:53] got to the place where I can finally
[1:42:54] preach.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; When Moses finally got got the thing
[1:42:57] finished and the Bible says then
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; then the cloud covered Moses Moses
[1:43:03] didn't say cloud now come.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; God was waiting till Moses was done.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. And he put the table where
[1:43:11] it's supposed to be. He put the shoeb
[1:43:13] bread where it's supposed to be. He put
[1:43:15] the candlestick where it's supposed to
[1:43:16] be. He hung the curtains. He put the
[1:43:18] veil there. He brought the ark in. He
[1:43:20] brought the word in and placed it in the
[1:43:21] ark. He put the mercy seat on there. He
[1:43:24] put everything in its place. And when
[1:43:26] that was all done,
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then God
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; came and covered it with a cloud and a
[1:43:34] pillar of fire.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:37] And when this messenger come in and
[1:43:39] people out of the congregation came and
[1:43:41] stood before before him, he was just a
[1:43:44] man. He was like me. He was like you and
[1:43:46] perhaps a woman who was standing in
[1:43:48] front of them like any woman here.
[1:43:49] They're standing there. Now what?
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Here's the people. Here's the
[1:43:56] congregation. They've got the music.
[1:43:58] They got everything in its place. It
[1:44:00] looks like any other group.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Looks like any other evangelist. Looks
[1:44:04] like any other ministry. But now what
[1:44:07] happened? I tell you that's when the
[1:44:08] pillar of fire came down. That's when
[1:44:11] the secret of the heart was revealed.
[1:44:13] Those people knew that there was another
[1:44:16] presence that this was not. And I can
[1:44:18] tell you that that it was that presence
[1:44:21] that has brought this word. That
[1:44:23] presence has sanctioned this message.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; And if you think it just this is just
[1:44:29] another gathering of another group of
[1:44:31] people because it looks like another
[1:44:33] church, you're so far off the base,
[1:44:34] friends. You're not even near it. Not
[1:44:36] even in the same court that I'm in
[1:44:38] today.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You understand what I'm
[1:44:41] saying?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Then the cloud covered the tent of the
[1:44:47] congregation in the glory of the Lord.
[1:44:51] People say,
[1:44:54] "Come amongst us. Come amongst the
[1:44:57] people." And they see the children. They
[1:45:01] see the sisters. They see it's not just
[1:45:05] the appearance of the dress. There's a
[1:45:08] holiness.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; There's a godliness. There's an aura.
[1:45:12] There's an atmosphere. And the people
[1:45:15] sense it. They they know something
[1:45:17] within themselves that this is
[1:45:19] different.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; And what you need to be able to say is
[1:45:23] glory to God. It's different because an
[1:45:26] Elijah messenger came and turned a
[1:45:28] corner.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have turned a corner.
[1:45:32] Yes.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian? I am that but more.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a Christian that has a
[1:45:39] prophet messenger.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And that sets you apart from a good many
[1:45:43] others.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; That's not a boast, friends. That's a
[1:45:46] praise and a glory.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; What we're saying is, oh God, who sent
[1:45:50] Malachi, you sent the messenger of
[1:45:52] Malachi.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Turn the heart. Oh, the heart that is so
[1:46:03] deceitful. The heart that can be so
[1:46:06] hard. The Bible says that Jesus, he
[1:46:10] walked into a He walked in the synagogue
[1:46:12] and this is I'm going to close. He
[1:46:13] walked in the synagogue. You talk about
[1:46:15] how hard how hard a heart can get.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Religious.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; You couldn't even put your finger on
[1:46:23] these men.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; They live such godly lives. Were they
[1:46:27] nice? Absolutely. have nice families.
[1:46:31] Absolutely flawless. You couldn't put
[1:46:34] your finger on them. And Jesus walked in
[1:46:39] the synagogue
[1:46:41] and he sees a man there with a withered
[1:46:43] hand.
[1:46:45] He says, "Tell me,
[1:46:47] is it lawful
[1:46:49] if you have your animal has fallen a
[1:46:53] ditch, is it lawful to set him free on
[1:46:57] the Sabbath day?
[1:46:59] and they held their peace.
[1:47:01] And Jesus, the Bible says he was angered
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; at the hardness of their heart that they
[1:47:08] could stand there, sit there and see
[1:47:10] this man bound that withered hand. And
[1:47:13] he said to the man, "Stretch forth your
[1:47:16] hand. Stretch forth his hand." And they
[1:47:18] took up, they wanted to find out how
[1:47:20] they could destroy him.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of a hard heart. I'll tell
[1:47:27] you what, friends. I know that within
[1:47:29] this congregation and within my ministry
[1:47:31] that I've seen people I've seen men come
[1:47:35] from dark places where they fought and
[1:47:37] they had murder in their heart and all
[1:47:40] the rest of it and God rich in mercy got
[1:47:43] a hold of their heart. And some of you,
[1:47:46] you know where you were in such dark
[1:47:47] places, but God rich in mercy. What am I
[1:47:51] talking about? But I'm not talking about
[1:47:53] just a man setting things in a certain
[1:47:55] order, but I'm talking now about a a a
[1:47:57] supernatural that comes in in attendance
[1:48:00] with the word. Hallelujah.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, how thankful
[1:48:06] I don't have to we don't have to go back
[1:48:08] just to some some books and say, "Well,
[1:48:10] this is uh you know, this is what I was
[1:48:12] taught in the seminary or this was what
[1:48:14] you were taught." I'm not I'm not having
[1:48:16] to depend on that today. I can put my
[1:48:19] back up against the wall of the revealed
[1:48:21] word of God and say, "My God, he came
[1:48:25] down in his glory." Even then, even even
[1:48:28] brother Brandham, I was looking at it
[1:48:29] and and I was going to bring it to you
[1:48:31] today. He stood and stood before the
[1:48:33] people. I can read it to you. And he
[1:48:35] said, "Now I will show you the glory of
[1:48:38] God." Brought the people before him.
[1:48:41] Now, do you like to see the glory of
[1:48:44] God? I will say my brother, my sister,
[1:48:47] we have been privileged to see the glory
[1:48:50] of God.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; From one day, from one week to the next,
[1:48:59] the supernatural hand of God is upon the
[1:49:02] people.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; I am not putting my confidence in the
[1:49:06] fact that God does supernatural things.
[1:49:10] I put my confidence in the fact that God
[1:49:13] opens blinded eyes to see what the word
[1:49:16] of God states.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; You can be prayed for and be healed and
[1:49:20] be wonderfully healed at this moment and
[1:49:22] you go out and maybe not even live for
[1:49:24] God. But one thing for sure, if God
[1:49:27] reveals himself to you, that's why you
[1:49:29] want to say from the depth of your
[1:49:31] heart, Lord, I have a corner to turn. I
[1:49:34] have a spiritual corner to turn. I have
[1:49:36] I've been a church member. I've come
[1:49:38] here to church, but I need to turn a
[1:49:40] corner where this is real to me. Maybe
[1:49:43] you're at the place where brother
[1:49:44] Brandon would say to you, you need to
[1:49:45] get down one more time. You think it's
[1:49:47] over. You think it's over because you
[1:49:49] say, I I'm going to promise I'm going to
[1:49:51] live that way. I'm going to do it. But
[1:49:52] when you go out, the strength's not
[1:49:54] there.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Why? You need to get around the corner.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Is it complicated? No. Oh, how simple it
[1:50:01] is.
[1:50:02] You just get down and pray
[1:50:07] until the note
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; in your prayer changes.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; You say something has happened.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; You can stand up and say, "Brother Ed,
[1:50:16] something happened." I say, "Yes,
[1:50:18] something happened."
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:27] I didn't intend on saying this, but one
[1:50:30] day I was praying with a young man.
[1:50:34] He was a good church member.
[1:50:37] He played in the orchestra of another
[1:50:38] church
[1:50:41] not far from where we were.
[1:50:44] And I walked up to him after a meeting.
[1:50:47] Brother Barup was in that meeting.
[1:50:51] And the Holy Spirit came on brother
[1:50:53] Barup and he be to cry out glories to
[1:50:55] God.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You heard Baroo say that.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; That's enough to scare the liver out of
[1:51:12] some unbeliever.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And I walked up to this young fellow His
[1:51:21] name is Ken Ardal.
[1:51:27] I said, "Do you think it's for you?"
[1:51:30] He was choked up.
[1:51:34] He said, "I think it is."
[1:51:38] I said, "Why don't we pray?"
[1:51:43] He was startled. He said, "Right here."
[1:51:46] They didn't do that in his church.
[1:51:49] I said, "Yeah, right here." So he got
[1:51:52] down
[1:51:54] and he took a hold of the rungs of the
[1:51:56] side of the chair
[1:52:01] and I began to pray. There was no
[1:52:04] movement. I felt absolutely nothing. I
[1:52:07] felt like this here. There was no
[1:52:09] emotion. There was no nothing. And I was
[1:52:12] kneeling
[1:52:16] and I looked up
[1:52:18] and I said, 'Lord, within myself, I
[1:52:21] said, 'Lord, is that all there is to it?
[1:52:25] Is that all you're going to do?
[1:52:28] Is there nothing more? And had my hand
[1:52:30] on the middle of his back?
[1:52:33] And I felt I felt
[1:52:37] his back pulsating.
[1:52:40] And I looked down
[1:52:42] and
[1:52:44] his knuckles were white as he was trying
[1:52:47] to hang on to the sides of the chair
[1:52:52] and they started sliding down. He was
[1:52:55] trying he was almost resisting it, but
[1:52:57] he couldn't. He couldn't. The Holy
[1:52:59] Spirit was overpowering him until his
[1:53:01] chest was flat on the chair. And he
[1:53:04] sobbed out
[1:53:06] his life and his unbelief to God. And
[1:53:10] when he got up, he was a changed.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; He turned the corner that moment. And he
[1:53:16] was around the corner from that day on.
[1:53:18] I tell you friends, God is real.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And that's the God I believe in.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] And I'm glad to invite you to this quad.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to introduce him to you if you
[1:53:32] don't know him. And he'll take you
[1:53:35] around the corner.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:53:51] Oh Lord
[1:53:54] Jesus, the same yesterday,
[1:53:57] today, and forever.
[1:54:00] You are here present,
[1:54:03] not in a great emotional
[1:54:07] drama, but you're here to come to the
[1:54:11] hungering heart. You're here to come to
[1:54:14] the thirsty one. You're here to make the
[1:54:19] transformation
[1:54:20] by the power of transformation.
[1:54:23] Oh, Holy Spirit, I declare that you are
[1:54:26] the one that has brought this word.
[1:54:28] You're the one that has attested to and
[1:54:31] the validity of it. You have attested to
[1:54:34] it, Lord. You have proven it. You have
[1:54:37] vindicated it. and all who will come and
[1:54:41] all who will believe shall be the
[1:54:44] beneficiary of the full power of it. Oh
[1:54:48] God, there may be some that need to go
[1:54:51] around the corner today. There may be
[1:54:52] some that need to make the full full uh
[1:54:56] measure of their decision. Oh God, I
[1:54:59] pray that it will not just be uh some an
[1:55:03] another action or another attempt. It's
[1:55:07] not an attempt. It's a finished work.
[1:55:11] And Lord, I'm declaring it by the power
[1:55:13] of the Holy Spirit and by the power of
[1:55:16] your word. I pray that even now the Holy
[1:55:19] Spirit will go out and hover over the
[1:55:21] congregation brood upon them. And I
[1:55:24] pray, dear Lord, the hungering and the
[1:55:26] thirsting will indeed have even now uh a
[1:55:30] a a reaction to the moving of the Holy
[1:55:33] Spirit. and that there will be a voice
[1:55:35] audible in their mouth saying, "Lord
[1:55:38] Jesus, even now I believe with all my
[1:55:41] heart and I believe the word that you
[1:55:43] have sent and I'm prepared, oh God, to
[1:55:46] follow you every step. Take me around my
[1:55:49] corner. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:55:52] trust you as my guide." Amen and amen. I
[1:55:56] wonder if we could stand.
[1:55:59] I'd like to sing I have a friend.
[1:56:02] We have a we have a friend who
[1:56:07] I don't want you to get lost in the
[1:56:10] in the words of the song. You can sing
[1:56:12] with your eyes closed if you will.
[1:56:15] If you don't know it, you can look at
[1:56:16] the screen and have it.
[1:56:18] [Music]
[1:56:20] I'm going to pray for this congregation.
[1:56:24] For those in the congregation, I want
[1:56:26] the congregation to pray with me. You
[1:56:28] prayer warriors out there, you pray with
[1:56:31] me now. I preach this message because
[1:56:34] God wants to do something within the
[1:56:37] lives of people here in the
[1:56:39] congregation. Some have struggled for a
[1:56:42] long time. Would you believe with me so
[1:56:45] that struggle can be done?
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Would you believe with me
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; so the struggle can be finished and
[1:56:50] over?
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; And we want to say it over, friends. We
[1:56:53] want to say it over. And if it was even
[1:56:55] just for one person, I'd say, "Oh, God,
[1:56:58] we've had this whole service. I've done
[1:57:00] my studying. I've done my praying. I've
[1:57:02] done my preaching. That a struggle could
[1:57:04] be over for one."
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a friend
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:20] beside me.
[1:57:24] You hold my hand
[1:57:30] and Heat. Heat.
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:40] Oh,
[1:57:47] [Music]

[1:58:02] He knows the way. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:15] Oh my.
[1:58:20] [Music]
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:42] We're going to say that last chorus once
[1:58:45] again, that last verse.
[1:58:48] But I'm today I'm here, but I'm not in
[1:58:50] church as such.
[1:58:52] I'm here
[1:58:54] sitting across the table from you.
[1:58:59] I'm saying
[1:59:01] from heart to heart.
[1:59:03] If you're in the midst of
[1:59:06] some not just some spiritual walk or
[1:59:09] some struggle, we all have that. But if
[1:59:11] you are in a critical
[1:59:14] corner in your life and you haven't made
[1:59:18] that, you haven't been able to get
[1:59:20] around that curve yet.
[1:59:23] And maybe you're like the young lady in
[1:59:26] the institution.
[1:59:28] She'd tried so many times. Maybe you've
[1:59:31] joined this church. That won't do it.
[1:59:33] She joined one church and another
[1:59:35] church, another church, but she had to
[1:59:38] have somebody who knew
[1:59:42] who knew the one with power.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; She had to have someone. And maybe you
[1:59:46] need someone to pray with you. And you
[1:59:48] haven't had that.
[1:59:51] I would invite you to come. You can
[1:59:53] stand right here. You can kneel whatever
[1:59:54] you wish. And there's godly brethren
[1:59:57] here, ministers will come and pray with
[2:00:01] you.
[2:00:03] But you mean business with God. You
[2:00:06] absolutely mean business that that's
[2:00:07] what you want to do.
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:14] friends,
[2:00:18] if we don't if we don't make the curve.
[2:00:23] Believe me, I've seen a lot of wrecks.
[2:00:27] I've seen a lot of wrecks.
[2:00:30] They're not pleasant.
[2:00:34] There's always sadness attached to it.
[2:00:39] And what's really sad is if you don't
[2:00:41] need to, you don't need to wreck up.
[2:00:46] There's people here that'll pray with
[2:00:47] you. You come and it's not me. It's not
[2:00:52] the one prays with you. It's the one we
[2:00:54] represent that is here on your behalf.
[2:00:58] We'll sing it once again. And then
[2:01:02] we invite you if you care to come.

[2:01:14] my path is.

[2:19:55] I just
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; That second verse says at some midnight
[2:20:06] hour, it might not be a midnight might
[2:20:09] be a Sunday morning. Hallelujah. But the
[2:20:12] same one that could meet us at midnight.
[2:20:14] And the same one that was in the prison
[2:20:17] with Paul and Silas, not another one.
[2:20:21] That very one is here. That very one
[2:20:24] that went with the prophet messenger
[2:20:26] that spoke through his mouth and told
[2:20:30] the secrets of their heart and has
[2:20:32] turned our hearts back. How we rejoice,
[2:20:34] oh God, we've been turned back by that
[2:20:37] one. And that one is none other than
[2:20:40] Lord Jesus Christ. He's the builder of
[2:20:41] the house. But he had to have his
[2:20:43] messenger to do it. And tonight, this
[2:20:46] morning now, not a midnight hour, but
[2:20:48] this morning, we're giving praise to
[2:20:50] him. And I I can say if you're still in
[2:20:52] prison here, you can get out. You can
[2:20:56] get out.
[2:20:59] Hallelujah.
[2:21:01] Walk out.
[2:21:06] Let's give him praise. Some midnight.
[2:21:10] [Music]

[2:21:14] Oh,

[2:21:58] Yeah.
[2:22:02] Heat.
[2:22:11] [Music]
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:21] We're going to dismiss you but not from
[2:22:24] his presence carry this with you.
[2:22:27] Why did he send? Why did God Almighty
[2:22:31] send such a message and such a
[2:22:33] messenger, such a prophet in this end
[2:22:36] time
[2:22:38] with the utterance of what we call a
[2:22:40] message out of his mouth? Why did he do
[2:22:43] that? To counteract,
[2:22:46] to defeat and destroy the power of every
[2:22:50] spirit that Satan would bring upon this
[2:22:53] age.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what spirit it is. I
[2:22:57] don't care what temptation it is. The
[2:22:59] power and presence of the Lord Jesus
[2:23:01] Christ that's here now is greater than
[2:23:04] that today, tomorrow, next week, until
[2:23:10] the rapture. Do you believe that? I
[2:23:12] believe it with all my heart and soul.
[2:23:16] Heavenly Father, this congregation of
[2:23:19] people, assembly of hearts and souls,
[2:23:23] believing with all that is in them in
[2:23:26] the word that you have sent. We believe
[2:23:29] this grand old Bible revealed. We
[2:23:32] believe the seals have been opened and
[2:23:35] that the mysteries have been made known.
[2:23:38] Lord, we believe, oh God, all that you
[2:23:41] have spoken through your messenger. And
[2:23:44] now as the people have heard the service
[2:23:46] this morning, I pray that you'll bless
[2:23:48] each one abundantly. And as we depart
[2:23:52] this place and prepare to come this
[2:23:55] evening, Lord, as our brother Lance has
[2:23:57] waited upon you. And oh God, how blessed
[2:24:00] we are as this servant of God comes and
[2:24:04] and lays open the word of God. I pray
[2:24:07] that you'll anoint the service mightily,
[2:24:09] Lord. And even now, may we begin where
[2:24:11] we're leaving off just now. and carry on
[2:24:14] as we fellowship this afternoon. I ask
[2:24:17] that the fellowship will be sweet, that
[2:24:19] it'll be around the word, and may your
[2:24:22] presence be with each one
[2:24:24] in Jesus Christ's name. Keep us safe on
[2:24:27] the highways.
[2:24:30] Protect us. We pray
[2:24:32] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:24:36] We're thanking the Lord for sparing our
[2:24:39] brother Shawn
[2:24:41] and uh Kaye. Am I saying it right?
[2:24:46] Just last night
[2:24:49] is struck by a motorcycle.
[2:24:53] And were there two on the bike? Two on
[2:24:56] the bike. One lost his life. Not we
[2:25:00] don't know.
[2:25:04] just right in the city just making a
[2:25:07] simple turn shot right out of the
[2:25:10] street. The motorcycle body flying right
[2:25:13] over top of the vehicle.
[2:25:15] And uh we're we're thanking God that we
[2:25:19] haven't got some people in the hospital
[2:25:22] seriously hurt. We're thanking God we're
[2:25:25] not announcing that someone's life has
[2:25:26] been taken. We're thanking God for his
[2:25:29] grace. I tell you what, we got somebody
[2:25:31] watching over us, friends, and we give
[2:25:33] him praise and thanksgiving for that.
[2:25:36] You tell Brother Sean we're rejoicing.
[2:25:38] Amen. God bless you. Drive safely. Drive
[2:25:42] carefully. Have some refreshment. Come
[2:25:44] back early and be prepared for the word.
[2:25:47] You're dismissed in the name of Jesus
[2:25:48] Christ. Amen.
