TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I [Music] Amad praise the Lord is that a revelation to you one of the children was singing that chorus Jesus loves even me and they they they thought it was just Eve and them so they doesn't Jesus love anybody else just even me oh well he loves us all Amen brother maddin and sister Sandra of their family here with them but they've come to dedicate their daughter Anna so I said what are her other names I said that's it Anna and of course Anna one of the uh at least it's one of the names that means Grace So when you say Anna and that's enough we can say grace and that's that's it amen that's sufficient I have a I have a scripture I've never never use the scripture in fact is I mostly have a different scripture each time and as I thought about this little one which we saw just a short time ago in your home as our sister Sandra prepared a nice dinner for us and we spoke together but there's a scripture and it's in Proverbs and it says this the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him and before I came to the scripture I thought rather than just having a dedication I was feeling uh an Impulse I wanted to bless this child and I thought how will we not just dedicate the child Anna but bless her and as I looked into it and saw that that's exactly what this scripture means I was directed to this scripture the just man walketh in his Integrity the just man that's a righteous man a man that conducts himself and his character in a righteous way a man that is Justified know that he's Justified and uh and then they see he walks in his Integrity he walks in his in a in a completeness in a fullness in a full assurance and in this scripture it is that he walks in his innocence and he walks in his Simplicity and I have found as I read the scripture and went into all the various components of it I have found that they were applicable to our brother maddin and his good wife sister Sandra he walks in his Integrity he walks in Simplicity before God he walks as a burden man and to be a witness for Christ and then the scripture says his children are blessed after him and uh the blessedness that comes from a man that walks in his Integrity before God the blessedness that we can bless this child with is that it is a life of Happiness blessed are they it is an assurance that they shall go straight they're blessed they they will progress on they will advance they will make progress says pronounce them happy that's exactly what I was feeling in my heart pronounce them happy and call them blessed because they have righteous parents and a father to head a home and to train them up in the way that they should go and so today our prayer of dedication is not merely going to be a dedication to the Lord but a pronouncement because they have righteousness in the home they have justification in the home and the presence of the Living God in the home amen so we're going to bless Anna you come to me Anna not really amen I'll pray for her heavenly father as I am surrounded with this lovely family and my precious brother madin and his wife sister Sandra you've given them a daughter and they felt to call this child Anna Grace I pray oh God that you will bless this child and father as they dedicate her to you we do not just dedicate her to you but we bless her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we bless her in the name of God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob the god that has brought this couple to Salvation and to Redemption and Lord we dedicate this gift back to you yes we give her to you this is what's in the hearts of the father and the mother and you have given her to them and now we give her back to you and we pronounce this blessing of Happiness we pronounce a blessing oh god of salvation upon her when she comes to the account of ability Lord to the age of account of ability I pray that you will make yourself known to her yes and bless this family in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you brother amen God bless you Sister Sandra amen hallelujah it's always a joy to see one added to a family like this I'll have you stand and and we're going to sing A Chorus in just a moment but I'd like

is over but I think it would be nice to turn around and shake hands with your neighbor and your believing friends and say isn't he wonderful as we sing it once again isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful [Music] [Music] SE [Music] word hallelujah all right if you would turn in your Bibles please to the book of Zechariah Chapter 4 we will begin to read they consider it one of the Minor Prophets and while you're looking for Zachariah right after habac or hagay I'm sorry Zephaniah Hagi zachari now for many of you perhaps this is uh you wouldn't be aware of this but the book of Ezra and Nehemiah which we know are restoration books recording the restoration and recording the people coming back from Babylon after their captivity there was not only Ezra a scribe and Nehemiah but Hagi Zachariah and Malachi and also the Book of Esther are all involved with a return from Babylon back to Jerusalem back to Judah and so all these books record events that were taking place at that time and you'll find in the book of Ezra for example you'll find uh the you'll find some statements that are made regarding zerubabel which is a main figure in the book of Zachariah and so these people were all involved at that time and we're going to read out of Zachariah now starting in the fourth chapter and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his asleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side there are so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath disp R the day of small things so many things that God does begin small for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven which are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth God bless you you may be seated I pray that God will give a special Grace today we just need a special Grace I would like to Carry On from last week but I don't have any idea how we're going to tie it in but I so that's where I trust that God will just bring it to you sometimes it seems like it's just a whole lot of Burden that's on your heart and things that you see the message is so expansive the message is so enlightening it is it is it is so gripping because of its enormity it's so it just so covering all aspects of of of time and and our life and our especially of the day that we're in and so I'm just praying that God will help me to bring this to you now the Apostle Paul uh in Corinthians he related to the Corinthians uh some of the events that happened with the children of Israel and in the Old Testament and he said to them all these things happened unto them for our ensamples or our example and they are written for our admonition upon whom unto whom the ends of the world are come so the things that took place in the Old Testament and happened with God's people uh they are not just isolated events it's very important it's not just something that happened to the children of Israel or happened to the Jews or happened to uh uh you know the the people that live back there and that it has no further reference because so many times those events actually have a compound meaning it happen in a natural way but it has a a a spiritual a profound spirit spiritual application and that is exactly what I want to refer to this morning and when Apostle Paul said that uh that these things uh are for our admonition it is for our understanding and more than just a mental concept but it is that our mental and intellectual mind our faculties will gain understanding and furthermore that by the power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially it's the fact of perceiving things and if we perceive Divine things spiritual things it should have an effect upon our life and so i' i' I've condensed it into this these few words we see and I'm talking about spiritually see the example that's what I hope we see in the in the script scripture today and by using God's Divine powers that has given to us and as we consider the example and ponder it seriously that we will receive Divine understanding to do the right thing to make the right choice that our lives may be guided correctly and if we were becoming kind of der or off track that the things we hear the things that we see in the in the example as we Ponder the example we say that example fits today even though that was centuries ago that fits perfectly today and God allowed those things to happen for your admonition but even if it is for our admonition you have to consider it you have to ponder it you have to uh seriously think think about it and say God allowed that to happen for my admonition that my life can be instructed so we are going to look at some of the events in the Old Testament that have a direct reference to our time and that is always the challenge it's a challenge for me and it's a challenge for you the greater challenge for myself as I Ponder these things I always think how will I bring those things from the past up for forward to this time and make them pertinent to our our environment and the things that happen to us because there are so many things that are in our language you can't find those words in the Bible there are things which you know we rub shoulders with every day and you can't find a a spiritual scripture that actually has direct reference to it but yet by the Holy Spirit there are things and that is why it's so essential that a prophet can reach into into the scripture and bring forward those scriptures to our attention that we can ponder those scriptures but we know that when God sends a voice sends a message sends a messenger then we know what comes from his mouth is pertinent to our time and the things that we may encounter in the direct in immediate future we looked last week and spoke on King Hezekiah and the the evil conditions of his time because his father was a wicked King in fact as they' had a series of wicked Kings and I believe he was the 13th King from uh uh from the time of the dividing from Solomon and out of Solomon then Solomon's son rabom and his servant Jobo and the the nations were divided into uh into 10 into 10 were given to jobal and one was actually given to riab and there's one because there's there's 12 but I just want to I'm going to just show you a number of slides here uh to kind of set the scene because under Hezekiah he wasn't influenced by his father he was just a young man 25 years old when he came to the throne and at 25 it was really amazing of the uh the the cleans cing and the purging and the purifying that he did in Israel so you see the uh you see where Jerusalem is here in the in the green portion and so this area here you see is the kingdom of Judah and then these others the kingdom of Moab Moab which of course came from lot's uh two daughters Moab and Ammon then we have the Kingdom of Israel so now Dan is up here to the north and beerse is way down to the South so this is the northern kingdom and this is the other Kingdom now Babylon is way over here and so the king of Babylon actually the king of Egypt from the south down here came and he raided and besieged Jerusalem and uh and then and he took a King one of the Kings down there and then after that was a succession of a couple other kings and the king of Babylon from over here came and took took uh took these tribes first and took a bunch of them into captivity and then came and besieged Jerusalem and that's kind of where we're going to be but I want to I want to go through the scriptures so we get a an idea of what actually Hezekiah did and I have made this brief the reign of the king of Hezekiah and the return to God this is from 2 Chronicles the 29th chapter and he did that which was right in the sight of God in his first year of his Reign and in the first month opened opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them I would like you to when we just read these don't read them as just a as just scriptures and events but think about what was involved this was over a period of years a number of years and he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together and said unto them hear me ye Levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of God the Lord God of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the Holy place now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel Israel that his Fierce wrath may turn away from us then Hezekiah the king Rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the Lord and all the congregation worshiped and the singers sang and the trumpeter sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished and when they had made an end of the offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped is not a marvelous record for a young man this is listen this is in God's word this is God's word God gave this testimony of this young man this young king and I thought he did uh really some remarkable remarkable things so they established a decree to make Proclamation through all Israel from Bersa even to Dan that is from the north down to berseba in the South that they should come to keep the Passover under the Lord God of Israel all of them in the North had gone into idolatry all of them in Judah had gone into idolatry he had one king after another you'd have almost thought what is the use but he was as a young man was determined to follow the things of God and to bring blessing upon upon Israel and he established the he established the Passover and he invited all of those were up to the north to come down and keep the Passover at Jerusalem M for they had not done it of a long time in such a sort as it was written and the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people so there was great joy in Jerusalem for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem isn't that marvelous Hezekiah then as I ended last Sunday and spent some time on it that he made his grave error and it was how be it in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who sent unto him to inquire of the wander that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart Babylon was established in the Book of Genesis Babylon is in the middle of the it's in the first of the Bible it's in the last of the the Bible and it's in the Book of Revelation Babylon goes that whole spirit and that whole event of Babylon and what it represents goes it's present in our time and it goes beyond us so it's not something that was is historical it's something that's very very present and that is why we want to uh make some references to it but God left him to to try him that he might know all that was in his heart and Hezekiah hearkened unto these ambassadors from Babylon and showed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in the in his house nor in all his Dominion that hazekiah showed them not then came Isaiah the prophet unto King King Hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and Hezekiah said they come from a far country even from Babylon and he said what have they seen in thine house and Hezekiah sh answered all the things that are in my house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them and Isaiah said unto Hezekiah hear the word of the Lord behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into Babylon and nothing shall be left sayith the Lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which Thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be Unix in the Palace of Babylon then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah good is the word of the Lord still a hell is righteous hell is righteousness which thou Hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and Truth be in my days I want to just perhaps I'll I'll take that back a moment and refer to it in just a moment now the era of Hezekiah you cannot Escape that it was a time of blessing I just want to go very slowly now it was a time of prosperity it was a time when treasures and gifts and things were laid up in Israel and this is a time uh that this is a this is a type of scene that had was repeated and it was repeated in our time in brother brandom's Ministry broke on the world scene just after the second world war the Second World War was a catastrophic event there was more people died in the second world war than had ever happened in the entire history of mankind you have to believe that that was a major event brother brandham speaks about the second world war as a second birth pain I have found many other ministers pick up and use that and I can only believe that they actually got it from his message and he speaks and he even I even saw where another gentleman I want to get don't want to get into it at all but he's a great Apostle Prophet of another organization and he even describes exactly as brother Brandon describes how that birth pains coming upon a woman and travail and they come faster as the birth is getting ready to take place and with a greater intensity the second world war was a worldwide conflict that was fought from 1939 to 1945 those six years and armed forces from over 70 Nations engaged in this war Aral Naval and groundbased combat spanning much of the globe World War I resulted in the deaths of over you ready 60 million people in six years 10 million a year 60 million is greater than Many Many Nations that exist today in six years the blood of 60 million people was spilled and the prophet comes and lets us know this was a second birth pain and he said in the message the first world war showed great birth pains it showed one of the first birth Pains of her going into labor because of that time for her we had brought forth the bombs and we had machine guns and poison gas he says and we find out now that we've had a second world war now I want you to know he's speaking these words and his ministry although the prophet of God registered many visions and things that God had told him from 1933 yet from 1933 up until after the second birth pain his ministry is not Thrust out into the Earth he's preaching but it's not Thrust out into a global I will call it the globalization of the Gospel and after it's it's less than 24 months it's about 22 months after the war was over from the time it closed with dday in June of 1945 from that time the prophet's Ministry within 22 months it was overspreading the earth and beginning to God released it as it were to the world and in that short period period of time from 47 48 and 49 there were some great men that were leaving the scene Smith Wigglesworth passed away in 1949 called an apostle of Faith great man of God and others were just fading off the scene and God was bringing a whole new era it is also referred to in Professor Harold's book all things are possible professor Herald of Birmingham Alabama and he calls it and and I I and brother Lonnie had dinner with him here he called me you saw that I used his name on the radio broadcast and flew up here he was going to San Francisco to speak at a conference and he said he'd like to spend some time and we came up here he came up here specifically to speak about brother bram's Ministry and he has said he's made some comments statements about about brother bram's Ministry but he he said he found that there was a a sweep Over America that changed the face of America and he calls it the Revival from 1948 to 1958 and he's a historian a professor of of uh Biblical history and he determined that it was a very unique time and so I will be focusing on some of that time so now what we have we have the the Earth coming out of the world coming out of one of its greatest and the greatest in all of history the greatest troubled time in a short six years birth pain and the prophet said it almost gave way because they had an atomic bomb that had been developed and you must remember the countdown that spiritual things are taking place in concert with natural things you believe that all right and he goes on to say now she must give way he said the second world war he said and her pains were much greater more terrific all the time the birth Pains of the earth she almost had to give away during the time of the atomic bomb because it would destroy a whole city it was much greater than the Pains of the first World War of destruction of the earth he said now she knows she must give away she cannot stand it Russia I believe would destroy this nation today if she thought that she could destroy it and then and then and then preserve herself some might here might be inclined to think well that was in the era of the Soviet Union and it was a great powerful superpower and it's nothing today don't you believe it you want to see uh you want to see the video of the general of all of all the atomic forces of America and the general of the atomic forces of Russia and they said you think that Dan Rather was conducting the uh the interview and the general from Russia came to America and the general from America was uh the general from Russia was reciprocal in his invitation and had the general from United States who was over all all nuclear power in the air in the ocean in the land in the silos and then they were comparing and they showed they took the Russian general right into the mountain in Colorado and the American General five-star general went right into the nerve center and that Nerf Center while America has it in a mountain in color in Russia it happens to be right on the I understand on the north side of the outskirts of Moscow and they always refer to it as Moscow brother branaman speaking in Phoenix he said they can unleash a a missile and he didn't say Russia this time he said from Moscow and landed on Fourth Street here in Phoenix I tell you what friends you don't want to take too lightly what a prophet of God speaks it is dead accuracy it may sound like it's in generalities but it's deadly accurate and we're deadly serious about it do you believe it and he says and listen to this now it's in 1965 she could if she could preserve herself listen to this statement any of those little Nations could do it back then there was no little Nation to my knowledge that had any nuclear power it probably was only United States and Britain and perhaps Russia maybe three that were part of that and now here's a prophet speaking in the future tense and it sounds like he's speaking right as of that time any of those little Nations could do it but they're afraid because they know that this world cannot stand in its orbit under such conditions and so the world knows that her birth pains is so great she's got to give away there's going to be a new birth born at hand and I'm thankful for that I'm tired of this one can we all say Amen to that I say if you're happy with this world you can have it you can take this whole world Give Me Jesus Christ give me the new one give me the Rapture you can have this old body I'll take the next one I'll take the one that's beside me I'll take the word body that I skipped around because of Eden's sin said anyone knows here it's a place of death and sorrow and all kinds of discrepancy and so forth and I'm glad that you have to give away I'm glad that time is at hand as John said of old even so come Lord Jesus and I believe we can all say Amen to that now brother brandham turns to the spiritual aspect of this which I've just read and I would like to insert right here that even though I've described now the war and described that event and described the prophet's Ministry now starting to overspread the earth I want you to understand that it was also a Time according to history it was a time of spiritual outpouring and there was and and brother Brandon refers to it all through the messages and hundreds of other ministers refer to it as the restoration of the gifts the Revival of the restoration ation of the gifts now follow this very closely this is perhaps like a a Sunday school lesson but it's going to be quite intense and I want you to be able to hang on uh to to the statements that I'm making and I'm I'm just being hesitant a wee bit because I want to make it carefully in the Book of Ruth and as you know the Book of Ruth is the book of redemption you know that it pointed directly to this time and between the church ages if I had the messages were spoken by the prophet in the church ages notice now you've heard me say it many times but I need to say it again in reference to my few comments in just a moment the church ages church is always a woman church is in the feminine gender it's not masculine gender so it's in the church ages or the time of the woman the church Church ages and then come the opening of the seals brother brandham never said he made statements about the opening of the seals that he never made about the church ages he said the seals was Christ taking the seals off of himself he said he said the the the seals that was Christ himself never said that about the church ages so you have the time or the era of the women of the woman which was right from Pentecost where the church was born until now at the end and the Earth is entering into birth pain and soon after another great birth pain and since then they've been trying to control the powers that could destroy and annihilate the entire world and you know they have that it's it's not something in the future it's sitting in the Earth right now it's under the ocean right now and in that same time God sends out m Messengers and he pours out a spirit of a restoration of the gifts gifts Treasures so it is now a comparison to hezekiah's time under Hezekiah there is a a tremendous uh uh blessing of God upon the nation upon what he was doing under his Reign and treasures were heaped up in fact is they had such they had such blessings and you can read it in Chronicles I believe it is and the people brought in from their uh from their wealth and so on and they brought in until there were heaps and they didn't even know what to do with everything that came in they and they had these heaps and they had to build storehouses for all of the heaps of the Grain and the wealth and all of these things the blessing was so happening if you go to the Book of Ruth and you find out where the messenger where Boaz Boaz comes to the field in the evening even and Jesus said the field is the world is the Earth and so Boaz as as Christ coming I mean he's in the kingly lineage hasn't come to David yet but the kingly lineage is coming on and it's and before the king can come into the Millennium where the king he will be son of David and prior to that it must be Boaz must must come and redeem a gentile bride who's in the earth who's actually she is in a state of almost starvation she is in a state of just trying to survive but she happens to be in that state in an era when there's great blessing and Boaz comes to the field and the field is the world and the Earth the field was full of Reapers full of preachers full of people gathering in the Harvest it was not a time of famine they had come from where her husband had died had come from a place of famine had come and they were still suffering the after effects the after effects of having a husband who could a denomination who couldn't give them seed and they were in another country and Ora's husband died Naomi's husband died Ruth's husband died and Ora went her way back to her gods and Ruth said to Naomi your God will be my God and your people will be my people and where you live that's where I'll live where you die that's where I'll die she was so committed to it and she comes back and here here it just so happens isn't it wonderful it just so happens aren't you thankful that a Time came in your life it just so happened you came under the eye in the eyesight of Boaz and he looked down at you and he says to his servant now and when Boaz comes now here's Boaz coming moving towards the Earth coming into the field and he says to all of the Reapers the Lord bless thee you're blessed and they said and your and bless and blessings to you so it was a time of spiritual Prosperity I'm not talking about dollars I'm talking about spiritual outpouring and when the prophet's Ministry even though he begins to see visions and all of that and has that spiritual dimension in his ministry it does not break on the earth till after the second birth pain because there had to be a certain era that it would be released is it all right can I write can I just read some of my notes to you that I felt very inspired and I just penned them and I read them before I came to the pulpit and I thought those are very very inspired I'm actually I haven't given you the title of my message but the title of my message is from Jerusalem to Babylon and back from Jerusalem to Babylon and back because that's precisely what happened Hezekiah was a king and needed God's Prophet to come to him and God's Prophet came to him only when he began to show all his treasures and his gifts and the things that God had so blessed him with although the condition of hezekiah's time repeated again the restoration of the gifts and it it's many dozens of times that the prophet makes that reference not only David Harold Professor Harold but all manner of Ministries all recognize that it was a time of the restoration of the gifts now hold that and it was the gifts that Pentecost really was they were being poured out from 1906 but now was a restoration of the gifts it was something that was a a remarkable world event not something just happening in Aza Street not something just happening in Los Angeles or a few cities in America but now it was poured out over the whole earth a globalization of the gifts I know that I don't expect you to just grasp where I'm going but as you follow along very carefully you'll see one of the things the first thing that the prophet breaks on the scene how he's had Visions all these years but now 1947 is the first taped message that you have and the first thing that the prophet the very first thing that establishes him as a prophet is that he has a a remarkable gift and it's he'll have a sign the angel says you'll have a sign in your hand like Moses you'll have two signs and if the people won't believe the voice of the first sign they will believe the voice of the second they will have to believe it because you'll know the very secrets of their their hearts so now here comes a a time after the second birth pain and the and the ministry is being thrusted over spread the earth and the tool that God uses is a sign which is a a gift that has never been expressed this way and he begins to show and demonstrate the gift and now he wants to show it to everybody and explain it to them and the angel rebukes him for showing the sign to the people don't try to explain it because you'll only bring a bunch of impersonations and he said it did bring a bunch of impersonations and the angel rebuked him for trying to explain it trying to make it trying to show it to a bunch of heathens and so he is now trying to tell the Pentecostal movement and warn them that this is not something and they said oh oh because at the same time I'm going to give you some dates now at the same time now here's an era the prophet the birth pain comes and the prophet's Ministry breaks onto the Earth and at the same time Billy graes Ministry breaks onto the earth and the same time time or Robert's Ministry breaks onto the Earth and a prophet is coming and saying there has to be two Messengers to Sodom to the world and he said nobody has it down like Billy Graham on the on a repentance and to turn people away from sin in the fundamental of repentance no one has it down like him and these Messengers went out but now Pentecost is being God has pouring out the gifts and I was in it and I can preach this because I know exactly what I'm talking about and I started myself becoming troubled because the Pentecostal Brethren that I was with and here here they began to be swallowed up and they began to feel they began to be impressed that others of the world and the denominations who had their idolatrous religions now begin to look into Judah and see that they were blessed with gifts and treasures and they said we want that we could use that and where did that desire how far did it reach right to the the Vatican right to Babylon and God sent a prophet brother brandham didn't need a prophet because he was a prophet Hezekiah needed a prophet to tell him who did you receive well I received celebrities I received great people from where from a far country even Babylon and what did they say and what did you do he said I showed them all my gifts I showed them all my treasures I showed them everything God has blessed me with and he says and those those gifts are going to go right back to Babylon and your sons who you have progyny from they're going to go back there too and there came a real alliance between Babylon and Hollywood in case you don't know it and I tell you those gifts went straight back into the denominations and the prophet is screaming out and telling them can't you see can't you understand when the foolish virgin gets stirred and comes for the oil she does not get it got a gift and that is why as a young Minister been ministering for several years and sitting with brother brandham just across from me and he went like this this is a gift of William brandham this is not William brandham and Pentecost could never get that separated oh because I speak in tongues because I got the gift of Prophecy or the gift of this or the gift of something else I've got the Holy Ghost no you've got a gift of the Holy Ghost and the prophet had to come and say it he said justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the Holy Spirit the baptism which is a gift of the Holy Spirit but he says and the baptism of the Holy Spirit made way for the Holy Ghost himself but the Holy Ghost himself happens to be the author of this word and the author of this word has laid down baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the author the Holy Ghost you can receive a gift of the Holy Ghost and be baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost which there is no name but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the person himself I want to just establish brother bram's ministry here and then we're going to go on to some other events William brandham conducted great healing Crusades throughout the world and was one of the fathers of the modern healing movement this is the dictionary of Pentecostal and charismatic movements this is the dictionary of Pentecostal and charismatic movements and this is a quote out of their uh this is a statement from them and it says about branam the person universally acknowledged as the Revival's father and pay Setter was William brandham the sudden appearance of his miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in the Pentecostal movement which was to move to Main Street this was really the beginning of the globalization it set off an explosion brother brandham in the angel of the Lord he said I know the next thing to happen is the restoration this is 1948 he said I know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts to the church historians looking back say it happened 1948 here is someone here is a prophet speaking in that very ear and he says that's the next thing to happen are you with me if anybody has any questions in your mind about what God did and what God sent onto this Earth you shouldn't have any when this service is over he said then it's the hardest thing I have to do is this pioneering work it is to do this as to see the people he said God cannot give back the gifts to the church as long as the church is divided Billy Graham's Crusade his first crusade was in Los Angeles in 1949 this is the within a few months or Roberts conducted his first Tent Revival in 1948 the initial Declaration of the United Nations took place on January the 1st 1942 involving 26 governments they felt forced to this because the war was in the midst of a threatening the whole earth and the nations of the world were so concerned and consumed because so many of their people were dying this may surprise you we have a very International audience here Canada is really quite quiet about their involvement do you know that more men per capita served in the second world war from Canada than any other Nation this little country sent 1 million men to fight in the second world war and were involved in the invasion of Normandy my wife's father was in the first world war when the gas and the mustard gas and all these things were involved and lost almost all of the people people he he was a sergeant he finally became a sergeant I believe it was and lost all of his all of his troop at one time but this this is why the Nations began to speak about having a United Nations I want to give the chronology at this time now we've got the messenger 1948 we've got Billy cram 1949 we have or Roberts these three Messengers 1948 and now I have a chronology of this nation of Israel and this is from President Truman's Museum in his Library February the 7th of 1946 or 47 rather 47 and the reason I'm raising this is because you that listen to the message do you I'm sure you do you listen to the tapes brother brandham says the very day which I believe he puts as May the 7th 1947 that very day that the angel of the Lord came to him and told him he was going to take this ministry to the world he said was the very day that Israel was recognized as a nation now if you just read what is commonly in the papers you'd say well no it was May the 14th 1948 and now he's not consistent and you can't reconcile it and people who want want to say he a false prophet but it happens to be in February 1947 the British government announces that it will terminate its mandate in Palestine because it the the nation of the British government had control of Palestine and February the 14th 7 Days Later the British government announces that it will refer the problem of the future of Palestine to the United Nations this in 47 on May the 13th of that same year the United Nations General Assembly appoints an 11 Nation special committee on Palestine to study the Palestine problem and report back in September of 1947 now what am I saying this for does this just sound like a history class to you no I hope that you can see that there came a second birth pain and God himself knew the Earth cannot it cannot even endure the third one if it does it will birth right into a new kingdom and destroy the Earth and it's sending a messenger and and and now there's a Vortex of time please see this and the events start to happen and a messenger to a messenger to collect a bride out of the church and Messenger to go to the world a messenger with the gifts of healing representing the whole movement of the Pentecostal and going to show it how who has the largest tent nothing against him this is what had to happen absolutely great men of God great friends of the prophet of God and he understand but now you see the things are coming almost like into a congested era and the United Nations has to be has to form and become stronger and the and the World Council of churches also this is from the Yale law of school regarding the state of Israel he said it's uh the general assembly on the 29th of November 1947 and it'll take steps to bring about the economic Union of the whole irit Israel issued at Tel Aviv on May the 14th 1948 so what I want you to see is that in God's mind a prophet says the day the angel came to me that very night God recognized Israel as a nation I want to say this congregation and all that are listening that God it God's not concerned when the United Nations recognize it when he recognized it and he recognized it sent an angel to the messenger said take this to the world and so what he takes to the world is a gift that's never been seen before and he starts to show this gift it's at a time when there's a great great benefit great blessing and Boaz is coming to the earth oh my goodness now the Redeemer coming with fullness of redemption coming to the Earth and he sends his Forerunner Forerunner ahead of him with a gift and the Forerunner now is going to try to explain the gift to everybody he even has he even had a a a a woman whose son I know them both and he told her just watch my hand trying to explain the sign that was given and and a boy had been to a male clinic he 8 years old I know him well and they said he won't live past 10 and his father's a Pentecostal Minister sitting on the platform brother CF hu and said to me he said to me I sat there and I said if he says what's on that card what they had written on the card and they gave the three main diseas Jesus that had happened the boy drank sewage out of water out of a ditch and it attacked his heart and he was a dying boy couldn't only be in school a little time and his father said if he says what is on night my card said I'll believe he's that prophet and brother brandham took him by the hand sister hu standing right with the boy and he standing there that little humble servant and tells exactly tell her you look at my hand and if it if it becomes normal when I finish praying that God God has chosen to heal him if it does not become normal he's chosen not to heal him I love that Simplicity don't you he prayed for him and the man is living today in Idaho and then these people that write all these criticisms and things about this messenger they don't tell about those things they maybe pick one item or pick something that they think they understand they have no understanding but I'm saying to this congregation when God sent that gift and then he wanted to show the gift to all the people let all the denominations know let all the idol worshippers know and the angel came and rebuked them don't show it because they can't understand it and so now also at the same time the Christian businessmen are formed and the World Council of churches is form how is it that all of these things are coming into such a congestion of time within months of each other it's God it's repeating exactly what happened and the prophet tried to tell the people you can't and even the angel said you cannot you cannot make babies to understand spiritual things one place you call a Pentecostal babies and they were all taken up and I was troubled I was very troubled myself because I saw I saw here there was a uh kind of a movement within the ministry and the people and people were coming in from the church of England coming in from the Salvation Army coming in from all matter coming coming in and they're coming in coming in and all them and getting the gifts of speaking in tongues then they laugh and become irreverent and I said something's wrong something's wrong went into a church where the whole charismatic thing was moving in Toronto just went in someone said I said go and see what's happening they thought it was great I went in there and as I was going in here's two of the ministers from the church smoking their cigarettes outside on the on the on the steps and we go in and then they move from this place and there are people from all manner of churches then they moved from there into the into the church proper and while we're sitting there I'm troubled I'm grieved and I got my little family with me and then they were going to kneel on the uh they have a little uh a little bench there you can kneel on and then they're going to give communion those two men up there speaking tongues prophesy you know what happened the gifts the treasures had all gone back to Babylon and I said to my wife sitting beside me we're going out of here even though everyone's getting ready for communion I couldn't care less we're getting up out of here we're walking out of here as a rebuke right will I said I'll not have these men serve me communion and we all stood up and filed out and I would do the same thing today Hallelujah you think it was because I'm an old man it's not that I was a young man with little children sitting beside me and I had the same conviction I have at this moment and I'm so thankful how much more God has made known and I can share this with you today amen hallelujah and here God sent a prophet Messenger to tell them don't show these gifts this isn't for the this isn't the way it's in fact as he said it's not the initial evidence and they were determined oh they couldn't wait they could not wait till a prophet got up and began to reveal the secrets of their heart oh you ought to just listen listen to a message I just listened to he just you can cut the air It's So Silent in fact there's one message are you listening one service he preaches and he's preaching the on the way the women should dress the way they should conduct themselves and they should not be having this makeup and should not cut their hair and not dress in a sexy manner and not wear these shorts and not wear these clothes and the man he says you men you husbands not having enough gumption enough enough strength to deal with your wife and preachers that they won't preach it and he was dealing with all of that then he says to them it's just did quiet you can feel the resistance you can actually feel the hatred and he gets up says now he says how many would like to have prayer how many would like to come in Repentance after he' broke this hard message and one man came you know where I'm going he says God bless this man coming up here now he says that you might know that I have told you the truth he begins to call the people out you reveal a secret heart you secret heart this man this woman this man this woman and your name is such and such and you are in this and you have got this condition and you're in that kind of a state he says now how many and I just flooded The Altar and he said I did that to show you that you're deceived why were they deceived because they would move for a gift but would not move for the word thank God he put something in our heart to be moved by the word something in the word moves me something in his holy book moves a soul not the gift not the Glamour and where did it go I can tell you where it went it went to Babylon brother brandham speaks about in 1962 he says the pope they have now which was John the 23d and it says of John the 23rd John is not only a person of luminous human qualities this is historical quotes about him but an intuitive judge of Mankind's hopes and needs at first regarded as a transitional Pope who had only warmed the chair of Peter he took over the Catholic church in 1958 unlike his predecessor the scholarly and aloof Pious the 12th John lets his interests lets his interests range far beyond the Catholic fold to embrace the fundamental plight of man in the modern world however soon or late that humble life may end the world will not be able to ignore or forget the forces that Pope John unleashed the world will not be a able to forget the forces that Pope John released and there was a prophet speaking to the whole Pentecostal World telling them that's exactly where he's going and he's going to bring back all the brothers lost brothers and he screamed out his warning they're going back to the horor they're going back to the mother and they would because they are Daughters of hers harlots according to Revelation just preaching in a church a short while ago last year and a girl a young woman in that church who's a Believer the message spoke to one of her professors because they're in a they're in a fundamental Baptist time large over 2, 2500 2700 students and she said we're having brother bisc is coming us to come and hear him and he came and he was in the church I didn't know he was in the church and I came to perhaps not this subject because I haven't preached this before but I began to speak about the mother of harlots the of Revelation 17 and of course he identified it right away because many did believe that and I said and you hear a lot of that subject you hear a lot of the mother of harlots but I said a mother has children and they had daughters and the scripture says that God would kill him with death spiritual death and he walked out of there and said to one of the man at the back of the church one of the elders or the leaders of the church had never thought of that before and he said this I've heard about the the great but he said I didn't realize I was one of the one of the daughters and brother Brandon was out there screaming the message trying to warn the people as Isaiah said to Hezekiah who did you show this to and what did you show them we showed them everything I was amongst those brothers and that's when I was coming out I was amongst them they're determined we're going to show them how to speak in tongues put our hand upon them say this say this say this you get this gift this wonderful gift they got that gift and live like devils and the thing went right back you ought to see the movement now the movement now is the Born Again movie stars that's a big movement Born Again movie stars and those they bring all kinds of perversion to the people and the Very gifts are gone right back to them can I continue continue on just a few more minutes I I promised myself that I would not race through this so I'm not taking my time for you I'm taking it for myself this article is concluding with John Paul who brother Bram spoke about several times and he says the world will not soon forget or ignore the forces that Pope John not John Paul I'm sorry Pope John has unleashed the importance of the council this was Vatican Council 2 the importance of the counil that he called is already clear by revealing in Catholicism the deep-seated presence of a new spirit crying out for Change and Rejuvenation it scattered it shattered the Protestant view of the Catholic church has a monolithic and Absolut absolutist system and and and then it moved on here's what brother Bram said in the paman church age and notice the that Pope John the 23rd has asked all the little daughter churches to come back home isn't this amazing language Vatican Council 2 listen now was called in 19 62 brother brandham is making this statement in 1960 2 years before and he says he's asked all the little daughter churches to come back home to the mother Church don't worry she will they will you don't know how moved I am did God send you a messenger did God send you a prophet and he says they're already back they don't have to go back they're already back there and then the Bible said he said that she will take it by flatteries I don't have the time I would like to read for you what the bishop of San Francisco has said and he's a great leader listen now I have a lot of things in here I hope that you can even if it goes over your head hold it it's like a class young people brother Ed may not be able to get into this the way I'm doing it right now the first church that became organized an organized church was the Catholic Church they're the first one that came out of the movement when the church was born in the book of Acts the first one to form and become the mother was the ca Roman Catholic church and that's why she has and and well I won't get into but that's why she has all the Heathen all of heathen holidays and everything brought back and brought it and introduced it to protestan Isel okay that's the first one the last denomination as a world movement was the Pentecostal and brother Brenham says to you he says all all these revivals that God sends they become denominated within three years he said this has been going now for 15 years and longer and he says and it has not nominated and it cannot because this one was the last one and that is why when the charismatic movement was spawned and went throughout the world also even right back to the Vatican in fact is I had I had word that the Pope's secretary himself had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit or the gift of the holy spirit with the speaking in tongues a pastor who I know know very very well my sister and brother-in-law know him also very well they may not know what I'm saying just now I happened to be in Zurich Switzerland and there was about 900 Believers of the message in a room and several Ministers of Believers ministers were speaking and when I walked out into the foyer uh here I could see that there was another big Gathering taking place because this building had multiple meeting rooms large meeting rooms when I came back to America to Canada I'm walking in a store I run right into this pastor much older than myself and I and he said I was just in Zurich he said oh he said oh he said there were nuns and Priests and he said they're all speaking in tongues he said it was glorious I said that is something I said I was just in Zur what are you yeah I said we're right in Zurich and we had a meeting I said where were you in the meeting we in a certain certain place I said that's where our meeting was what day was it it was this day I said that's when we were and and he got a shock look he says oh that was you he said we knew there was a meeting taking place you know like Believers of this message we we saw that that was taking place and I said to him I said and I called him by name said I want to ask you a question if the pope speaks in tongues will he be the pope for you oh never said a word hadn't thought of that will he change his office if he gets his gift will he be the pope will he be the viker of Christ will he still explain all the scripture to you will it still be a Purgatory will you worship Mary where does this thing end and the gifts went right back to Babylon but listen friends I say here to this congregation we were many of us born in Babylon and we come back to Jerusalem hallelujah hallelujah I was born in bondage I was born in confusion but I've come out hallelujah it's from Jerusalem to Babylon and back Hallelujah and they begin to come back they begin to come back the Bible says that in in the year that's uh Darius and God put it in his heart to raise the funds and to raise up people and who will go back and God has put in my heart to build a house for the Lord God Of Heaven heaven in Jerusalem and I can tell you God put it in his heart because God put it in his word and it got to be known who's going back who's got it in their heart to build Hallelujah sometimes I'm not preaching I'm going to end in just a few moments brother brandham makes these statements nothing in the Bible types the denominations but Babylon do you believe that in the message Jehovah Gyra preaching Grass Valley California and I was with the minister that was hosting these messages and preached in his church and he says he was telling the little account I'm I'm going to dra try and draw to a close now but it's not easy I have so much that I would like to say but he was saying that the animals and had a great earthquake in India and he says the the birds they found the birds that would be in these rock walls out in the field field and they said the birds left those places where they even make their nests would leave and go out in the middle of the pasture and and be fluttering in the trees and the animals would stand the cows and The Oxen would stand near the wall to get shade from the heated sun he says they all went out into the middle of the pasture and stood in the heat something in them an instinct in them and a great earthquake came and shook those walls down and crumbled those stones and perhaps destroyed those nests but the animals lives were saved and the prophet says and if he can guide an animal by Instinct how much more ought the Church of God to get away from these man-made walls of doctrines of the churches Babylon is going to fall some of these days Jehovah Gyra has provided hisself a resting place for you he says Fly Away From The Towers of the world fly away from the glamour of Hollywood oh how Satan is so subtle so enchanting try to make and especially get a whole of the young people I tell you young people stay away from the styles of the world world that's where Satan tries to creep in well it's the style we don't care about the style stay away if you see everybody on the street doing it you go the other direction you say well this is this is the only thing this the only thing I can find in the store will you pray I had three daughters my wife prayed she even wept she said I just I have such an agony such a turmoil inside and I have to go shopping for the girls and she sold some of the girls sewed was that the end of their battles no not necessar the end of our battle but we're in a Warfare we're in a real struggle Babylon is going to fall one of these days stay away from the glamour of Hollywood the churches are trying to mock after them it's night you ought to see it today friends it's all Hollywood is it not so it's Hollywood it's a performance it's featuring this star and that star the whole thing has gone back it's all homogenized that's why some of these absolutely demon-possessed perverted rock stars that that's why they're received in the highest places of government and given great uh you know titles and even received and Pope John Paul comes and and and uh fellowships with those that are rock stars you know that's true I guess you do why the whole thing is corrupted it all has to do with money it all has to do with uh Society it all has to do with celebrity it all has to do with you know uh identification and Swinging people in we want no part of it we want no part of it whatsoever and I'm preaching this so that you can go out of this place today and say thank God I have a protection and you want a little short scripture for it it's in the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and lead us not into temptation that's exactly what God did by sending you a messenger is answering that prayer giving you the guidance so that you will not be led into temptation he said dress this way and if you dress that way you will not be led into temptation don't hold that voice boy's hand and as a young man don't touch that girl and you will not be led into temptation God made you a certain way you have certain certain strengths God Made You he gave you the sexual desires because it's there to to be kept holy it's there to be a progenitor of of life it's not there to drag down in the mud of the world and you can point your finger in the devil's faith and say I'm not ashamed that I have those strengths I'm not ashamed of my appearance I'm not ashamed of what God has put in his body but you're not going to drag it in the muden and you're not going to pervert it and you're not going to twist it and you're not going to condemn me because I have it I'm saying some pretty plain things today especially the young people they have certain desires certain drives sexual attractions and they come to me and they say I'm so condemned what are you condemned well because I have these desires don't be condemned for that God gave them to you he did of course where did you get them God gave them to you it's a devil want to drag it in the mud you don't let him drag it in the mud you don't let him tempt you some other Direction you hold that as a sacred thing from God can you say Amen have the support of this congregation one of the last messages that brother brandham preached was Modern events made clear and he said this in prayer Lord Jesus and I'll repeat the prayer from My Heart Lord Jesus we thank you we praise you Lord we give you praise for a called out people out of Babylon I think praise be to God I give him praise also I thank him from the depths of my heart for a called out people that's been called out of Babylon tell you what I could do a dance I'm rejoicing I've come back to Jerusalem and a prophet said Jerusalem is where the word issued out of I'm dwelling right where the word came from and now I close with this I am done in the message listen now i' i' I put this together I believe I was divinely led of God you can take it for what it means to you whenever I get a quote whenever I begin to see something that I feel directed the prophet of God has said certain things I go and see what he called that message because that indicates to me where we are in the program and now i' I brought this to you with a lot of dates statistics and I've left out some there's just so much but at the time he came and began to preach the message of Grace the message of Grace was in 1961 just before Vatican council is going to announce we want to bring all the brothers back we want to bring it actually they call it the lost brother and the prophet said said it was the daughters they were bringing back you got spiritual minds and so he comes and listen to this as very in fact is brother Tom it ties into the last message brother Tom preached I met him out in the hall and I don't often speak to a brother about quotes that he used but I said I use that quote so many times it's so very dear to me and brother brandom in the message of Grace read read Zechariah 41 those verses I read to you and speaks about zerubabel and talks about he that laid the foundation is also he that brings The Headstone because he's a he's a messenger representing Christ himself bringing the headstone the message is Christ Christ Christ the word is Christ amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was the Word was God God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the father full of full of full of and truth and he reads this is the word of the Lord that came under zerubabel not by might nor by power but by my spirit say the Lord who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it and he said we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple listen very close he even asked the people to listen very close so I'm asking this congregation listen very close don't miss it and he was a great Prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince zerubabel he said had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he laid the foundation stone and we find out what God Said zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the head the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know that the scripture I'm coming down to it we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger now he jumps right from Zachariah please have my have have your have my let me have your attention he he comes right from Zachariah and brings it comes a Quantum Leap and brings it right to this very moment and he says that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers that's Malachi which is one of the writers of the restoration Malachi 4 behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet because there can be no rebuilding without that Ministry and Malachi had to say it because he was one of the he was one of the people that were there at the first first return and he's saying there's going to be another return and how it's going to happen it can't happen without Elijah the prophet and he's going to return the hearts back to the fathers the faith of the fathers and so he goes on to say the seventh Messenger to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers and here's the phrase I hope you can memorize it and never forget it in other words you know Mal 4 5 and 6 h i s your Elijah the prophet and he'll restore the heart he'll restore the faith of the fathers the children back to the faith of the fathers and now he puts it another language in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit you're sitting here today you say come to clor Bible way to church if you're under the opes of this message if you've been birthed under this glorious word I want to announce to you that the Holy Spirit has sent you personally the angel of the Lord in the form of a word and to rebuild you back into the house of God and this ministry has built you back rebuilt in other words under the power of the spirit to rebuild a people my brother my sister I may be beside myself but I used to speak in tongues not that I don't now I still do but it's under the under the exact direction of the of the ministry that we've received I heard so many all of the gifts of every kind until I didn't know what to do with it I have to be honest I was a teenager I was one of you boys right here and the services were so mighty there was such an anointing we were afraid to leave and a man I just read about he just passed away he he would come to church a number of times and brother Bram talks about the latter rain movement and the latter rain movement they thought that actually brother brandham had been sent to become part of their movement and they came out of birthed out of North Battleford Saskatchewan I know quite a bit about them my father was even there for a year at their Bible school not studying but seeing what it was all about and they believ that they put hands on people and gave gifts and the prophet came to them clearly and says you can't give a gift you're born with it now I could to I could bring a whole another message right here you that have talent you all got gifts and you all got talents and those talents are not for the world those talents are for God hallelujah they're not to throw out and say I'll spend all my energy I'll give all my talents to the world you go right back into a mess you believe that and I sat in the service and it began to to prophesy they prophesied over one couple said prophesied over my father said you're going to go to Africa my own dad said to me you better save your pennies we're going to Africa my father never left the shores of this country my sister and her husband were prophesied over they may not even remember I remember well you're going to go to Indochina they never went to Indochina his brother was prophesied over they're going to go to Indochina they went to to Jamaica prophesied over another couple you're going to go to the Arctic they in Vancouver Island what are you supposed to do with that and people are misled and the prophet comes and it's so true God can't speak a lie we can say write it off and say well it's just a mistake to me it's not a mistake it misleads the people and now we have a perfect word now we have an absolute that keeps us out of that mess and they showed all the gift to the world here's our gifts here's our Treasures here our talent and it all went back to Rome and good Pentecostal Brothers of mine a pastor friends of mine going in and mingling with all the nuns and the priest and everything else and I I have a quote right here I have I have Pope John Paul Paul's words to the Seminary here on the West Coast instructing the priests and telling them you cannot deviate from the doctrine of the church this charismatic movement it's good for us but you cannot deviate from the doctrine of the church the church still becomes the absolute we've got another absolute and it's called the word of God as revealed and spoken in the mouth of a prophet and now friends I can say as he has said now it's off of my hands and it's onto yours and you do what you wish with it I feel as though I have relieved myself of a tremendous responsibility God help us you young people take heed of these things you're the ones that's got to stand up who's going to do this you got to stand up you got to take the load you got to be the example young ladies who's going to do it if you don't do it someone else going to rise up out in the world God has given you a message God's giv you protection God's giv you leadership and everything how to conduct yourself in school how to be in the home your relationship with your parents how to remain a virgin how to remain how to remain pure how to come how to have courtship how to be married all of these things are found in the word of God we don't take them lightly can you say say amen I thank God for this word

Zion you can't march sitting down so we might as well stand up you know I've seen I've seen them when they get the Marines all line up and the sergeant he doesn't whisper fact is I was whispering at

military exercise he they just scream at them Hallelujah tension we're in a great exercise hallelujah we're marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion all right you sing it I've better about exercise my voice everyone now come we that love the Lord and let your join [Music] let to sing God [Music] children before we read s the next verse I started three services ago and I call it being impressed by Revelation and whether you believe it or not that theme still lingers on it's what we're impressed with and I never got a chance to tell you I was referring back and I did touch on I touched on the mixed multitude that came came out with Moses because they were impressed by the signs and the gifts and they were the persons that gave trouble once they got out into the Wilderness in this if you read in Ezra you go in there just a short distance and they begin to rebuild the walls and rebuild the kingdom the temple once again and there came a whole group of people another mixed multitude they were impressed all the treasures and the gifts were coming back to Jerusalem and they said we're going to build with you we're going to be a part of this thing we've never seen anything like this before and the leader don't have his name just now in my mind he says you have no part of this thing you have no part of this thing where the elect of God we're going to build it ourselves we don't need your money we don't need your talents we don't need your schemes we don't need your glamour we don't need the celebrity we don't need it the elect of God we'll build this thing amen and that is why that second verse said if we just go back the second verse please let those refuse to sing who never knew our God maybe I'm off in a my own little world but just leave me there I'm having a great time quite frankly I'm not interested who gets impressed with what this message produces they got to be impressed with the one who brings them they got to be impressed with him and the prophet says the bride the bride is attracted to the bridegroom Ruth in the field was not attracted to The Barley not attracted to her bracelets not attracted to his gifts she was attracted to Boaz I'm attracted I'm impressed with Boaz I'm impressed with him who's made himself known to us all right let next verse I'm sorry next verse the [Music] beautiful beautiful do you plan on being there amen I want to
