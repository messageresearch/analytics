[Music] Got some brothers going to help me sing. So uh [Music] [Music] I'll start with a verse. I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the ages lies.

My hope, my hope is in the Lord. And this time on and forever more. Oh my hope is in the Lord. Forever more. Stand and sing it with us. Oh my hope, my hope is in the Lord. From this time on and ever more. All my hope is in the Lord forever more. Let's sing the first verse together. I stand in all within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the aes lies. For whom the raging of the seas subside. The living sacrifice. The only source of life. My home is in the Lord from this high and ever is forever. to the second verse. His tender mercies come with every rising sun to beat the sinner in his brokenness to offer healing and forgiveness. And those who trust in him will find their hearts at rest. My home is in the time and my is forever. Let's sing it again as brother comes. Oh my go from this time. My hope is in forever. Oh my go [Music] [Applause] once again. [Music] My hope, my hope is his from this time on and my home is in forever. [Music] Hallelujah. Praise God. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You may be seated. We're going to have a a dedication of two children. Our sister Darlene Hildebrand has her children here and we're going to ask her to come forward. Yes. Jesus loves me. We're all children, aren't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's nice to start nice to start lives out so that they can sing like you do when they get to be your age that their hope is in the Lord. This is where it starts. Amen. This is where it begins. So, we're going to ask our sister Darlene if she will come, please. And while we're saying, "Yes, Jesus loves me." All right. Would you please? Yes. Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. Yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus loves me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, Sister Darlene has been desiring to have her two daughters dedicated for some time and uh I was really blessed by the email you sent uh Darlene. She is uh her eldest here is Bethany Cila. &gt;&gt; So when you read in the psalm Sila, you can think of this one Bethany Cila. God bless you Bethany. And the youngest one is Caitlyn Sarah. That's wonderful. You gave them good names. I was uh mindful while I was meditating on the dedication of these two children of how God how how this has been uppermost in God's mind, how children would be raised. And what caused me to think about that is sister Darlene had sent me was going to send me sometimes they just send me the names of the children and to remind me that we're going to have the dedication. But Sister Darlene went into her testimony and in her testimony she said even in her lowest moments in the world she thought of her children. She thought of raising them for God. and in her lowest moments felt unworthy to do that and the grace of God was extended to her in a wonderful way and is able to stand. This is not a small matter, sister Darlene, that you're able to stand here on the platform today holding the hands of your two children and uh and God saw you in those moments and God has given you this wonderful opportunity. She said she noticed that the children, her children thrived. And that was the word you used and it really anchored in my heart. She said, "My girls thrived when they came to church under the sound of the gospel. They thrived." Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; No wonder God spoke about rearing and bringing up the children. And even in the in his discussion, you imagine God did not speak very many moments, not too many minutes. I've timed it out that God's words that he spoke to Abraham. As great as that is, it is only a a few minutes of actual conversation that God had. But he did say when he was when he was speaking to Abraham in the form of Elohim which p which comes right connects to the ministry whereunder and he said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I'm going to do which was the destruction of Sodom seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great nation a mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed by him. And here's his next line. For I know that he will command his children and his household after him. I thought that was amazing. So, so upfront to this great promise of God to Abraham was how he would raise his children. And so God put that in your heart, Sister Darlene. And in so doing, you're not only raising them right, but you're protecting them. And if you love these children, which you do very deeply by having them here and the sound of the gospel, letting them come under the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, you're actually protecting them against many hurts and many evil things, and you're protecting them. And God bless you as a mother as you do that. and to have your mother here and is uh a special blessing our brother Nathan Hilda Brand who takes these as his children. God bless you. Um in brother Brandham's last service, this is his last service before God took him which was leadership. And he prayed a prayer and he included the children and he made this reference. He said, "Dear Jesus, one day in your pilgrimage here on earth, they brought you such little fellows." He had some with him in the church. This is his last service. And he's taking time to to deal with this. And he says, uh, they brought such little fellows as I have been speaking to this afternoon. And the disciples said, "The master is too tired. He's been preaching and this morning and he he preached this and that and he's too tired. Don't trouble him." But Jesus said, "Suffer the little children to come to me for such is the kingdom of heaven." And he continues on with this prayer. I want to go to the end of it. He says, "Oh dear God, creator of heavens and earth, guide our feet, Lord, that we'll do we'll not do nothing before these little ones that would put a stumbling block in their way. For it is said it'd be better if we had a millstone tied around our neck and cast into the sea than to offend one of these little ones." That's what God thinks about them. And he said, "They're angels always. Behold my father's face which is in heaven, the great angel and guardian angel over each of these little souls. And then at the end of his prayer, he said this. Oh Jehovah God, lead them, protect them, and may they find this great leader, Jesus Christ, that will lead them when father and mother and the teachers are finished with them. May you lead them to eternal life. He said, "I you did to Moses as their humble little child prayer went to you. I give them to you, Lord, as your servants, as trophies and gems for your crown. Use them, Lord, to honor you on the earth in Jesus Christ's name." And that's the prayer I'm going to pray that God will take these little gems. Come to me, Bethany. I know all about girls. Let's pray together. Lord Jesus, I lay my hands upon these blessed children. I pray, Father, that Bethany and Caitlyn will be not always not only always in your care, but hold them in your hand. Put your arms about them. And as the prophet of God prayed, I pray I echo that prayer. Be their guide. After they've grown and perhaps if time shall go on and and mother or grandparents aren't with them, be their guide. When they're alone, you watch over them. Keep them in health, I pray. Keep evil away from them. Keep them from the snares. Keep them from the pitfalls. Keep them, I pray, so their lives will be a testimony of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. I dedicate Bethany and Caitlyn to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, that they might always walk in your ways and walk in truth. And may they always thrive in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. May they be a blessing, I pray, to other children, Lord. And I ask, Father, that your love, your love, oh God, will be extended to them in abundant measure in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, Sister Darlene. Give you wisdom and strength. Amen. Isn't &gt;&gt; that wonderful? It is uh it was just really nice to see and I haven't had an opportunity to even shake hands with our our brother Gilbert and I'm looking for them. I saw them on the brother Gilbert, sister Lois, God bless you. Welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are so happy to have you. These people have come a long ways. A long ways. Some people travel across the continent and some people travel across seas. But our brother Gilbert and Citra Lois, which originally came from Kenya and have been working in Saudi Arabia and uh last year we prayed for a couple that were they were at the convention 207 convention and on the way home they stopped at Nairobi, Kenya which is their city where they came from originally and took a taxi and the taxi hijacked them, took them out, robbed them of absolutely everything and they thought that their life would surely end there. And I believe if I have it right, Sister Lois, the these men either asked you to leave the car or asked you to leave the car and she feared then she said, "No, my children will go with me." And they said, "No, you get out." And she was certain that she would be killed and or the children some harm's going to come to them. And she took them quickly out of the car with you, didn't you? and and they were spared but were left with nothing. We respect that that you came and your former pastor brother Obadiah Kamwati told me of of something of the thing that he knew. We're happy to have this couple once again. I want you and the family to rise so that everyone can see this is a couple that under great duress have come now to dwell with us and have the children in school. God bless you brother. That's believers &gt;&gt; and we're so happy. We need believers. We need believers who can have faith and who can pray. Amen. All right, Sister uh yes, Sister Donaldson, Sister Brother Derek Donaldson, pastor in in New Zealand, uh is here with us, has been here a couple weeks, but has been out at the out at the camp. And so I just got to shake. Sister Donaldson, could you just stand? We we so love your husband's ministry. God bless you. Amen. Well, I'm going to have you stand once again now, Brother Rod. If you can help me because of the message and to put us in the theme, I have a couple of songs, but I want to sing a verse or two of my faith looks up to thee. I want to speak this morning, Lord willing, and with the help of the Holy Spirit and with you saying amen. And I read about amen. You know, it was a custom. They would say amen before the reading and amen after the reading. It was like saying shalom when you meet somebody and shalom when you leave. So, we're saying amen before the service, before the reading, and we're saying amen after the service, and anywhere in between. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because it would you it's an acknowledgment and it is actually saying I am saying amen let it be let it be a part of me let that which has been spoken be a part of me amen so be it hallelujah my faith looks up to thee thou lamb of Calvary faith looks up to thee th lamb of calary Savior now [Music] take all my away [Music] [Applause] from this Great. &gt;&gt; Just verse two. Thy grad strength to my fing heart is thousing. [Music] [Applause] [Music] And I want to sing a verse of Draw Me Nearer, Nearer because uh I'm not singing for you to put you in the atmosphere. This been on these songs have been on my heart since very early this morning. And I've just been singing them to the Lord. And I love these words. I am thine, O Lord. [Music] How many want to join me? &gt;&gt; I am thine, O Lord. How many want to join me the next line? I've heard thy voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've heard thy voice and it told thy love to me. &gt;&gt; I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So be it. That's been the truth of God's word. Sing it with me. And just this verse and one chorus. I am thy Lord. I have heard thy voice and it's full thy love to me. [Music] I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer from to thee. Oh, draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed to the cross where I die. Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to thy preious. [Music] Our dear gracious heavenly father, we love and thank you for these words that we believe has been inspired by the Holy Spirit and people who've been inspired and as your prophet has said, all inspiration has come from you. But the so much of it is so perverted. But this is pure and it speaks to our hearts, Lord. Oh God, oh God, I am thine, oh Lord, and I've heard thy voice and it told thy love to me. But I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee. This is our desire. This is our prayer, especially in this hour in which we are living. You've called on us, oh God, to stand and to be an expression, to be a witness. I pray, Father, as your word lays before me, open that it may indeed be open. Open, I pray, to each that are here, oh God. And I pray that you will uh just encompass us by your presence and your nearness and do what is pleasing to you. We give ourselves un unreservedly to you Lord. Take us, cleanse us, give us a clean heart. Give us clean thoughts. Oh God, let us draw into your presence. Oh God, we come humbly. We come seeking your face. Lord, we come seeking, oh God, your forgiveness for anything that wrong we have done. Oh God, we pray that you will do mighty things amongst us and put us in position and in condition, oh God, to receive this morning from you. Anoint the people, I pray. Anoint the speaker, oh God, according to your word. And all those who are connected with us and are one with us now streaming the service. Bless them wherever they may be in the world. I ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you'll take your Bible, please, I'd like to have you turn to Hebrews, the 11th chapter for a a reading of just the first six verses of Hebrews 11. I would just ask you earnestly, I covet your prayers this coming week. Uh my wife and I will be going to brother uh Jose Joe Greens, brother Joseph Green. He is now the pastor where brother Dan Daisley was. And I thought I should just tell tell you this. I feel very much to be at home with the family this morning. And I'm going to just speak to you that way. But when brother Dan Daisley passed away, I held it in my heart for a few days. But the Lord spoke to me and said, "They're going to call you and ask you to come and speak these meetings." And there was no pastor at that time. Brother Dan had just passed away a very very short time. And so I just waited. And then after actually it was a maybe a couple of months or two or three months. Then I got a phone call from brother Joseph Green. They had asked him to take the uh pa the position of pastor in the church. And then it was sometime after that that he called and said, 'We'd like you to have come and take the services for this mission mission convention they've had every year for many years. And I have spoken there when brother Henry Green was the pastor and then he passed away and brother Dan Daisley became the pastor and now he has passed away and brother brother Henry Green's son now that's Joseph and he has become the pastor and then when he called I said I would I felt it so strong in my heart and then I discovered they were having it the same week as our camp and I was in a terrible terrible position. So I phoned them back or told them I couldn't come and if they had it at a different time. And yet I had this in my heart that they would ask me and I would be there. And so they postponed it. But they've had it the first week of August for maybe 30 years. And now they so they put it so I would be able to be with them. And I don't know what the Lord has in store whether for them or for myself. But uh I just go trusting and believing that God has made these arrangements. So I have a number of services to speak and then on to brother uh brother Ron Spencer's for three services. So you pray for me. I need strength. I need wisdom. I need the presence of the Holy Spirit. I depend on him. But we've got seven services in the next two weeks. God bless us this morning. I so enjoyed the service before we went to the camp and I have seen the effects of the camp friends. Uh the effects of the camp are here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful to God &gt;&gt; for his eternal work. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaketh. By faith, Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. May God bless his word to us. You may be seated. The scriptures are are infallible and the scriptures are wonderfully put together. &gt;&gt; Even in the reading of these six verses, the first one that makes reference to faith is able. And he was the he was the first one that whose life was taken, but he was a type of Christ. The scripture speaks of the blood of Christ that speaks better things than that of Abel. Isn't it amazing that it says by faith Abel? And then the very next one is Enoch, who's our type. &gt;&gt; That's going right from the beginning to the end in two verses. &gt;&gt; I thought that was really, really remarkable. And by faith Enoch was translated. I want to uh speak to you on the achievements of faith. The achievements of faith in the message perfect faith. And I'm just giving this as a as a starting point. Brother Brandham said faith is based on forgiveness. And then as as we said this morning, trying to get the church Oh, here's brother Brandham trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving amongst us. I'm not reading that so much for you as I'm reading it for myself. I have a great hunger. I told God this morning early early in the morning and throughout even to this time, I have a great hunger to see days that many of you have never seen, apostolic times again. And here is the prophet of God with the things that his church saw, with the things that Brandham Tabernacle experienced. and he is still having a craving that they would see apostolic times again. We don't want to just merely be hearers of the word and we can have wonderful services and wonderful preaching. We want it to go beyond preaching. We want it to come down into reality within our hearts and within the congregation and within our homes wherever it might be. the supernatural God doing supernatural things. And then he went on to say that they may see apostolic times moving amongst us. He said, "That's what we all hunger." I said, "Oh God, I had not read this, but I was in prayer before I even got out of bed this morning. I have a hunger, Lord. I have a hunger to see you move and take control of the of our services. Take control of our lives. Take control of our home and our bodies and our whole being. Take control. &gt;&gt; He may want to do something you've never even experienced yet. &gt;&gt; Let him have his way. &gt;&gt; Say, "Come, oh Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; And my next prayer was create in me a clean heart. We have things, we have issues, we have thoughts, we have feelings. And faith can't operate with some of those. It won't coexist with another spirit. Even brother Brandham is saying here, faith is based on forgiveness. If we hold anything in our heart, God will not move. Faith will not operate. It is based on forgiveness. We have to receive forgiveness and we have to give forgiveness. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's what we hunger for." And he said, "Furthermore, it's just laying at the door." I announced to the congregation this morning, it's just laying at the door. It's not far away. It's just laying at the door. He said, "We see it, but we want to see more of it. We want it in such a flow that it'll be a help to us and flow out to others. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You know, I feel that we have heard enough already &gt;&gt; if we acted upon that. &gt;&gt; That would be a big step. &gt;&gt; Let's resolve in our heart. Let's say in our heart, let's dedicate ourselves. We just dedicated two children, but let's all be children this morning. Let's all be children. Let's all just say, "Oh God, empty me out. &gt;&gt; Whatever there may be that you can use, take it and use it for your glory. There have been many achievements in the world. And throughout history, there's been a lot of achievements. And some have changed the world for the better. Others have faded away and aren't remembered anymore. I suppose one day the steam engine was a great achievement, but it's not it's not relevant anymore. Maybe one day the horse harness was really something that, you know, would work and get uh animals, domesticated animals to work and serve. But it's not relevant anymore. It's gone the way of the horse hornness, gone the way of the steam engine, some of these things. And so they're great achievements for the time. Then other great achievements have uh really changed things and in that they have been built upon. And brother Brandham speaks about that. There's been scientific achievements that have advanced civilization and they are remembered. Now, brother Brandham states that the advancement of civilization and man's achievements, listen closely, are directly connected to what God is doing in his churchise. &gt;&gt; It's not just some poetic license. It's it's kind of like it. He said they're connected to it. in the message countdown he said and I'm just laying this as a fundamental basis for everything else I wish to say this morning he said everything testifies all nature testifies the word testifies to it the very spirit itself that's in our heart testifies to it something within us is calling out that there is a resurrection of the dead that's what he's pointing to then he said there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body of of people. There's a natural bride and being that there is a natural bride, it's only a testimony that there's a spiritual bride. &gt;&gt; Oh my, the natural brides, it's important. We have all kinds of things that take place. and with sister Katie and brother Michael and their week. I'm sure no one has to remind us that their week's going to be a busy week and the family's going to be busy and all this. They're all What are they doing? Getting ready. &gt;&gt; And that's just for time. That's just for a brief moment of time. What about where you're headed &gt;&gt; as a spiritual bride? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about that wedding? that's taken place now taking place getting ready for the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; It's only a testimony of a spiritual bride and there is a spiritual bride because there is a natural bride. All these natural happenings they forerun spiritual happenings. Each happening accompanies the other happening only it improves it. &gt;&gt; You say what what like? He said well something like a spiritual life when it comes into the natural life. We all are here with a natural life. I think the reason you're here is because you've had a spiritual life come into the natural life. And what does he say about that? He said it comes into the natural life and it makes you in a better condition &gt;&gt; than you wear in your natural life. &gt;&gt; So it has spiritual life has come in and it makes us in a better condition. If it hasn't, I'd give it up. &gt;&gt; Here I have this underlined. All the natural achievements that's happened in the earth has been forerunners of spiritual achievements that God has done by his church. All the natural things are types of the spiritual things. all the natural things. And one place I'm going to read a little later on, he said they're actually warnings. The natural achievements, scientific achievements are actual warnings or they're signals or their alerts that something spiritual is on the road. &gt;&gt; This is this is probably worth mentioning. They say that not a single human being had ever flown a powered aircraft when the 20th century began. Hey, people been on the earth for few thousand years that we know of and no one until the 20th century had flown. The first piloted powered controlled flight lasted 12 seconds. You wouldn't even get to the end of the runway. Now, it lasted 12 seconds and carried one man 120 ft. Today, non-stop commercial flights lasting as long as 15 hours carry hundreds of passengers halfway around the world. I'm sure if you've flown on some of these big beasts, you've had the same feeling. I I've I've looked at that luggage going in, and I feel like the little woman that threw her apron in the air when the first steam engine train started moving down the tracks. She said, "It'll never go. It'll never go." And when it got started, she threw her apron in the air again and said, "It'll never stop. It'll never stop." And I feel like that little woman, because I see all that baggage, I look at my wife and I say, "This thing's never going to get off the ground." And it gets off the ground, then I worry that it'll land safely because uh that's just I I look at all those rivets in the Ever looked at those rivets in the wing. Say, "I hope those things stay in place. Do you ever watch the wings go like this? Said, "This thing's flapping just like a great big eagle." And I hope it just stays up here. Well, pray first. We got to be on one tomorrow. And I got to think about this. The first man in the 20th century, what about all the other centuries? Weren't they smart back then? Of course they were. This was the signal because the church was moving and was directly connected what God was doing in the church. Why didn't they have this in the Old Testament? Because the church was not moving at that level in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; You have to you have to conclude that. Listen to the telephone. The telephone. I hope you don't have your cell phones turned off. In 1877, which isn't that long ago, Alexander Graham Bell, he wrote a prospectus. He wrote a prospectus to drum up support for his new invention. And the telephone was was to be briefly described as an electrical and this was his this was his explanation. The telephone is to be uh briefly described as a an electrical contrivance for re reproducing in distant places the tones and articulations of a speaker's voice. As for connecting one such contrivance to another, he suggested possibilities that admittedly sounded utopian. This is he said it is conceivable that cables of telephone wires could be laid underground or suspended overhead communicating by branch wires with private dwellings, country houses, shops and factories, etc. that could even possibly happen. &gt;&gt; Hey, we've only gone a little overund and some years &gt;&gt; in a hundred years. Why wasn't this happening when Elijah was here? &gt;&gt; You know, you need to ask yourself that. It's just not an accident. It came in this hour because there was something God allowed it to take place in the natural because there was something to take place in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; And just one more and that is our research in space. In our daily life, we are literally a wash in a shifting tide of signals, frequencies and codes. Our eyes and ears can receive some small part of these and pass them along to our brains for interpretation. But what of the rest of those signals which reach us and even pass through our very bodies on a level which the flesh is not sensitive enough to detect unaded. Do you know that back I think in the 1950s the prophet of God said that these signals pass right through our bodies. &gt;&gt; How could he say that? Because he was connected to a science these fellas hadn't even discovered yet. &gt;&gt; He was connected to a mind that wasn't even discovered as yet because it was a time. It was an era. He said that these signals they're passing through your body right now. And the prophet of God said there's there's images passing through here. He said bodies are passing through here. If you had the instrument, it would pick it up. The television camera doesn't produce it. It only produces and and and brings a signal so that you can you can see what is happening. Colors are going through. &gt;&gt; Colors are going through here right now. &gt;&gt; Your birthmark is going through here. if it if you catch it. Is that strange? Not a bit. And so the theme of the countdown message is based on comparing the achievement in science to the spiritual advancement. And so in the just a little bit on on in the countdown message, it just talks about the horse and the buggy and the transportation and the right brothers, etc. I won't read that. But he said, "One happening accompanies the other happening all the time." He said, "Now don't fail to get this." And so I'd like the congregation this morning, don't fail to get this. Open up ears, heart, and everything now. And listen close. When anything happens on earth, it's a warning to us that something is fixing to happen from heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; What man does on earth by his achievement is something that God's fixing to do by his achievement in the church. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that &gt;&gt; God has been able in the spiritual line to achieve from justification and he goes on now from justification through Luther and sanctification through Wesley to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now it's a type of shadow achievement what God has been able to do and by God by Luther with the Holy Spirit power was able to achieve by Luther to the church justification. Isn't that a glorious truth? &gt;&gt; Wasn't that a marvelous achievement? &gt;&gt; Lu Luther's not down in the annals of uh of science and scientific uh uh development, but he's down in God's records. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a messenger in God's records. And he achieved a a message to the people, a great achievement by the power of the Holy Spirit. The just shall live by faith, &gt;&gt; not by works. How wonderful that was &gt;&gt; for the multitudes of people who came out of all of that works and trying to be righteous and holy and it's not possible. And so God moved the church up. And then when the church got justification out of the Roman creeds, it began to get life and begin to move through justification. God was able to do through his achievement to get one man to stand still long enough that he could protect him or project himself to it and get his message to the people. The next achievement he said God was able to do. He got a man by John Wesley. And then he goes on to sanctification, these achievements. And then he says there came an Isuza Street where they left the ground and and and and hit the air through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. These are achievements and they could only happen in this hour because it was a natural achievements were taking place and they're working in in concert with one another. They're connected to one another. And then he goes on, he said, "The same horsepower that can pulse the horse did the same thing to the automobile and did the same thing to the airplane. And the same Holy Ghost that brought justification to the church, it brought more of it when it brought sanctification &gt;&gt; and the and it poured it in with the Holy Ghost till the same power. It brought the same thing. It took the church off it off its feet into the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; The same power &gt;&gt; just more of it. &gt;&gt; Building on what was there. &gt;&gt; The message today is built on &gt;&gt; what God has achieved in the past. &gt;&gt; It's not something they threw that away and then just start something all new. It's built on. It's advancing the It's the same power that's been in the church only. It's advancing in its stages. &gt;&gt; Said now things has changed altogether because science is moving on. Things have changed altogether. Then as you know he talks about the astronauts and he said well they talk about astronauts in this day in the 20th century but we had astronauts in the scripture. Enoch was an astronaut. Elijah was an astronaut. Jesus was an astronaut. Why? They simply went into space. Why should that be so strange? Hey, God, he doesn't need he doesn't need a a a tube of of metal around him &gt;&gt; or around his people. &gt;&gt; And so these are these are true uh achievements which took place. But then he said this this is astronaut age. Oh, what a great thing. &gt;&gt; The horse and buggy was earthbound. But now we are in an astronaut age and so has the church. He said that's that's the big swing over that I can't get before the people. That's the big swing from that one age to get them into into this mind into this thought into this development into this achievement. Friends, we don't want to be earthbound. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be so attached to this earth that we can't get heavenly bound. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen close. Now, that's a form of evolution. Listen very, very close because I got some preaching to do. The true message of evolution I'm talk the true message of evolution. Evolution is gradual development. Brother Brandon says one moved to the other. It was just more of the same. More horsepower, more Holy Ghost power, revelation but more revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost but more of the Holy Ghost. The presence of God, but more of the presence of God. The word, but more of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Supernatural things, but more supernatural things. That way, we don't want to settle back. We want to move on forward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm depending on you, and you have to depend on on someone else. We're depending on one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so in we have a we have uh evolution in in creation into higher forms of life. Now we do not believe in evolution of the species but we believe in evolution of the creation of the species. Brother Brown said he began to create the lower forms of life and then he built up higher and higher and higher. He didn't do away with the lower things to get to the higher things. It was just more of the same creation. &gt;&gt; So, we don't agree with Darwin, of course, &gt;&gt; not a He said, "If there was," Well, I got it here in a moment. He said, "If there was, then why why has there never been anything get higher than man?" &gt;&gt; If everything just developed to us, Brother Brandham says, "I got one for them." I'd like to ask why has there never been any any indication through all of their evolution theory that something evolved higher than man? He said the reason why it can't be because man is in the image of God &gt;&gt; and it can't get any higher. And that defeats their own doctrine, &gt;&gt; their own theory. They call it a theory. It's more than a theory. They try to teach it like a doctrine. And they won't let you bring the Bible into the school, but they'll teach Darwinism and say, "Well, it's just a theory." Well, someone else said, "Why don't we just teach this as a theory then?" The theory of creation, not the theory of the ele evolution of the species, but the evolution of the creation of the species. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we believe in the evolution which is the gradual development in revelation of greater truth. We believe in the evolution of the building of the bride body of Jesus Christ. Prophet of God. It shows clearly in the scriptures also that it grew from you know just from the from the feet all the way up and now come to a head age. So now we're we're not in the uh I just got a couple of quotes I'd like to make in the message demonology said I believe in the right kind of evolution in the present stage of my ministry said I believe in evolution but not the way that man evoluted from some lower species. Their own theory backfires upon them when they try to hybrid anything. even when they try to, you know, bring a horse and a mule together and a horse and a donkey together and end up with a mule and it can't go any further. So, it backfired in the message. It wasn't so from the beginning. He said, "I'd like for science to answer this one. If there's such a thing as evolution, he says, "And they claim that it could uh that it could come some other way. Why doesn't something rise higher than a man? We have no species higher than a man?" because he's in the image of God. Nothing can go beyond its creator. He said, I'd like them for to answer that one for me and they can't do it. Why? He said it's the highest species in seal of God. He said, I believe in evolution. The first thing maybe there was just nothing but just plain chaos, volcanic eruption. You know, God's a great contractor. And uh and he was moving the earth around, creating calcium, pot ash, petroleum, etc. And then uh he said what came up next? He says probably flowers and then vegetation vegetations and the birds flew out of the dust of the earth. And then came the animal life and it kept getting higher life, higher life, higher life, higher life until finally a man came up in the very image of God. Now having said that I want you to think about the higher life more revelation more revelation in the world more achievement more achievement until today there's a tremendous fascination and a a tremendous amount of research that's taking place in the space and space labs China is coming up with one. Europe has one. United States has one. They're not up there playing Scrabble. They're doing research. &gt;&gt; And they're trying to determine how they can make things better on Earth &gt;&gt; and even to get dwellings up in space and how many might dwell and to get cities, etc. If time were to go on, they probably would have all kinds of people living in space and some very very, you know, uh uh something special up there. I I don't want to be there. I I I'm already going to go to space. &gt;&gt; Are you &gt;&gt; plan to be there? &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll have a great time. Amen. &gt;&gt; But why are they so why are they at this time so gripped and so consumed by that? Because spiritually it has come to that time &gt;&gt; building one upon the other. And God is going to have another achievement. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it's going to be a masterpiece of achievement. Abel, we've just read, Abel was the first one to offer a sacrifice acceptable. Just listen to me closely. Abel, a man like you and I was able to offer an acceptable sacrifice to the creator of heavens and earth, all things. I want to say that was an achievement. man like you and I to the creator of heavens and earth that that brought all the universe into being and all the galaxies into being that we could even approach God. That was an achievement. &gt;&gt; They could bring something that God Almighty would look upon and and and accept that sacrifice. I think that's a major achievement. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enoch was the first astronaut, became weightless, defied gravity. You can say amen if you think it's an achievement. &gt;&gt; That was very early to do that. And was translated and defeated death. &gt;&gt; That was an achievement. &gt;&gt; I think he should go down in the annals of of history. However, they they they think that that's not a reality. I think that Noah being warned of God, of things that was yet to come, prepared an arc to the saving of his family, the saving of his household. I think that's an achievement &gt;&gt; when a man with another seven souls would be saved &gt;&gt; off of destruction. &gt;&gt; What would you do if we said there were seven to be saved out of this entire Pacific Northwest and there was only seven, you're one of them? Would that be an achievement? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did that happen? Is that a myth? It happened. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a few people in the Pacific Northwest. It was the entire earth. Why? Because he believed God's word &gt;&gt; regardless of how absurd it sounded. He believed it. Abraham and Sarah reversed the aging process &gt;&gt; and produced a son &gt;&gt; when he was 100 and she was 90. Was that an achievement? I'm talking about the achievements of faith. &gt;&gt; I think even today if we could if we could say thank God I know I know that I know that I know I am able to offer an acceptable sacrifice to God because I believe him. I believe his word. That's an achievement. &gt;&gt; So when I go to church, millions go to church. I put something in the offering. Millions put things in the offering. I prayed, millions pray. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Millions sacrifice. People give their lives do so even more than perhaps pray more than you pray &gt;&gt; or I pray. &gt;&gt; It's not based on that. It's based on believing &gt;&gt; the word that God sends. &gt;&gt; And it's not necessarily just our doctrine or what we believe. It's what God confirms that is his voice &gt;&gt; that God confirms. That's why I go back to the uh to the vindication so very very much. Outside of the vindication, you only got another doctrine. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. Outside of the vindication, you're only another church. &gt;&gt; Outside of that supernatural vindication, people think, "Oh, well, that was the first pull, second pull." When a prophet of God is standing there saying your name is such and such and you live at such and such a place that happens to be the only thing that separates it from any other message. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that separates it from all other millions of religious books. &gt;&gt; That one thing &gt;&gt; that's why I'm very careful with the message to stay with what it says. You can get all kinds of types and all kinds of glamorous things even out of the scripture. But when the prophet of God comes to it, he he maybe doesn't say a thing about it. If he doesn't say a thing about it, I'd stay away from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've seen I've seen things in this groups and this message goes as sideways and is haywire. And if you go down to the very bottom of they start saying something he didn't say. Did they get excited? Oh, were they excited? Were they inspired? Absolutely they were inspired. Brother Brandham says David was inspired when he was singing, even bringing the word back to the people the wrong way. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. That's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; It's not only the word. It's the word coming back the right way &gt;&gt; through the right vessel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is why when the word was coming back, it couldn't be on a new cart. Had to be on the shoulders of the of the priesthood, the priests. That's the only way it comes back. &gt;&gt; And sisters, be very careful. There was no women amongst the priests. &gt;&gt; They're not authorized to handle the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, keep it where you where you belong. I told you I was going to preach. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching quietly, &gt;&gt; but I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; And things that you need to hear, things that we need to keep in line because it's contrary to the spirit of this age. The word comes on the shoulders of the priests. And then Moses conquered the superpower of military power of the world. The superpower with the word of God and a rod in his hand. That's an achievement. &gt;&gt; And Rahab the harlot ascended so high until she passed into the New Testament as one of the mothers of Jesus Christ. to go from harlot to the mother, one of the four running mothers of Jesus Christ. That to me is an achievement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know what that means to me right here in this congregation saying that right now. I've done counseling with people. I've had people write me. I've had people send me and say, "You said just a certain thing." and it lifted them up from the drags and the depths of despair and sin. The power of the word of God, &gt;&gt; it has that same power. We're building on the same power that was in the book of Acts. It's the same power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There people sitting in this congregation at just even prior to camp. I saw the heaviness. I saw the cloud. I saw the rebellion. I saw all of those things. I saw the word night after night. Break that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And lives changed. Not an emotional thing, but a a a substance by faith. We saw the substance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a lifechanging word. &gt;&gt; Believe me, friends, if I never would preach another service, don't miss one thing for sure. You are going to pass as an individual. You're going to pass from this world. You're going to pass from this brief brief time. The Bible says your life is a vapor. &gt;&gt; Look at yourself and tell yourself, "I'm a vapor. I'm just here for a short time." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm going to give you a word today to hold before you a promise to hold before you because God's given us a promise that's not back in the horse and buggy age. It's not back in some distant age. It's right here now. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has given us a word now. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Not just reading the Bible, the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; God's not going to tell you how to make a yoke for an oxen. It's not for that age. He's going to tell you about space. &gt;&gt; He's going to tell you how to be changed. &gt;&gt; He's going to make statements to you. You'll be changed in your atoms. So you can say ah the word for this hour &gt;&gt; I understand that &gt;&gt; being changed in my atoms that's where I focus now all my attention that's where I focus my faith that's my language that's for this generation God didn't preach you an antique message through the prophet he didn't give you an antique message not 500y old services not an antique message it's tomorrow's message. &gt;&gt; It's today's message. It's a word that you believe that word that word will change your body. That word will change your very structure. &gt;&gt; It was in this age they discovered DNA. What is it? It's a structure. The DNA, the structure of your body, the structure of your cells. And they say you can go on and and and join into some uh some websites that will for a fee trace your DNA because they said find out who your ancestor is. I looked at that. I said, "Thank God I know who my ancestor is." &gt;&gt; I had someone had had had a key to the structure of the DNA. a prophet of God &gt;&gt; that could tell me where I come from, tell me how the structure was, tell me who my ancestry. They said, "Do you want to go deep, deep into your ancestry?" I've gone deep into my ancestry. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God gave you your spiritual DNA. &gt;&gt; And the scripture has the structure of your DNA. It just took the spiritual science to bring it out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And show you how it was structured. Because the word of God, you can't read it like a paperback book. You just can't read it like a book. Man put it into a book. But you have to have to be able to understand the spiritual structure. &gt;&gt; It takes a scientist. Why didn't they discover your DNA hundreds of years ago? It wasn't the time. &gt;&gt; It's the time now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They've proven now we've had several within the in the penal system. We've had men I feel very sorry for them that have been in prison for 15 years and more for the murder of perhaps a young woman. One in Ontario has been spent most of his life in prison for murdering a young girl, but his DNA proved he didn't do it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil, he tried to lay a lot of things on us. &gt;&gt; He tried to lay He like, he like to heat condemnation. But God God rich in mercy. God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Have you ever had a condemnation? Has he ever come your way, tried to condemn you and put a cloud on your life? But God came and read your DNA. Not your DNA that came from your mother and dad. By that you were a sinner, but the DNA that came back into God's body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The very righteousness, the scripture says, the very righteousness of Jesus Christ, we are the righteousness of Christ. &gt;&gt; And by that DNA, there was no sin cannot find any sin. Even Pilate had to say, "I find no fault in him." His DNA, there was no sin in the DNA of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And our righteousness is in him. But we had to have a messenger that could come and read the structure of your spiritual DNA. You knew nothing about that. And there isn't a denomination in the world that can tell you anything about that. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It's the power of God under salvation. &gt;&gt; The DNA, your spiritual DNA. Without that, you can just go ahead and accept all your condemnation. But for my part, I want nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Don't allow Satan to point to your human side &gt;&gt; because that will surely bring you into a deep pit of despair and condemnation. Who has not failed? We've all failed. Okay. What makes you different then? We've believed a word. &gt;&gt; That God sent. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends. &gt;&gt; Listen. If this is just William Brandham speaking, we're all gone. We're all gone. &gt;&gt; We're all gone. &gt;&gt; We're no further off than people who believe that Jesus was just a man that died. &gt;&gt; No further off than the Muslims or anyone else. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your confidence is, I believe, a word &gt;&gt; that God sent to this hour. &gt;&gt; It's an astronaut word. It's a space word. &gt;&gt; It's a centuries word. It's a season for It's a word for this season, for this time. It's a rapture word. &gt;&gt; It's a change of the body message. &gt;&gt; And that's where our faith is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Paul says in the Hebrews, "What shall I say more? Time will fail me to speak of Gideon and Bareric and Samson and Jeff." And David also and Samuel and the prophets, they're all achievers. They all made great achievements. They quenched they quench the fire that they quenched the violence of fire. They escaped the edge of the sword. Out of weakness was made strong and they waxed valiant in fight. Women received their dead raised to life again. That's an achievement. &gt;&gt; I heard of a man in Central America. I don't know him personally. I don't remember whether I met him or not. Here's a minister and this message very very poor very poor but I know a minister that knows him real well and he was away in the mountains of Central America Guatemala or one of the places Nicaragua someplace down there and this particular minister who I was acquainted with was very close to them and this man is up in the mountains and he's preaching And word comes to him that his mother has pip died. And it just threw him into desperation. But he told he got down. He told the Lord, "I have no money. I don't even have the money to bury her." And so he told him, "Just wait till he gets home." So she was dead for I don't know, one day, two days, three days. And he came back and I don't know all the details, but I heard from the mouth of this pastor that knows him real well. He went in and he prayed and he told the Lord all about it and his situation, his condition. And God raised that mother up to life again. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that. &gt;&gt; Has it ever come into my heart? Yep. Yeah, it has. &gt;&gt; There was one of our people that passed away and I was in my car when I got the message and I thought that this is not to happen. This shall not happen. And I said to I said to the Lord, I will go right now. I'm going to the hospital and raise her from the dead. of course you're sitting quiet. But I just was absolutely adamant that was just not to happen. And for my own sake, I was totally convinced. And I was at that moment on my way to the Langley Hospital. And I was absolutely certain she would just rise from the dead. I had a tape on the car. I don't even know what tape it was. And I just pushed it in. And brother Brandham said,"Well, now he said, "We wouldn't dare do that unless God told you to." &gt;&gt; And I was smitten. &gt;&gt; Because I knew this wasn't an accident. And so then I told the Lord, "If you say so, I will go." &gt;&gt; And there was no voice, no nothing inside. I've heard that voice inside. &gt;&gt; I would just love that. I love that challenge. I'd love to go and raise somebody from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What an achievement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I haven't invented anything in my life. I'd love to go. Is there anything that I'd love to do more? Yes. I would like to be alive and feel or sense somehow that sweep. I don't need to feel anything. I don't need to tickle. I don't need a chill. I don't need nothing. I don't need anything going up and down my spine. I just want to know the presence. Uh I believe it'll just be the presence of God will be such an intensity. It'll just be a sweep. &gt;&gt; It will be in another realm. &gt;&gt; And we're going to start seeing. We're going to start to see a lot of people. &gt;&gt; Won't necessarily be you there. Just the way you're dressed. It won't be me the way I am this morning. We just start seeing a lot of people &gt;&gt; and they're going to start saying, "Welcome. Welcome. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, that is a an achievement that God has set aside for this age. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Let me ask you something. When Jesus said to the disciples, "Don't go preaching. Go and tar in Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost. Try until you're filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you something sincerely. Do you think they were sitting there thinking, "Boy, I wonder how my farm's doing. Oh my goodness. I wonder how I wonder how my wonder hope my hope my people employees aren't running the business into the ground. Oh my goodness, the bills I got to pay. Oh, you think they were thinking about that? No, they were just thinking they only had one thing in their mind. He said, Terry, wait. Wait until the Holy Spirit comes. Wait, what are you doing? I'm just waiting till the Holy Spirit comes. What? Their whole faith was focused on the word that had been given for that moment. &gt;&gt; What should we be thinking about? We should wake up in the morning thinking about the change. This body's going to be changed. I'm here for the rapture. I'm a rapture person. I'm one that God has sent to this age to experience this experience. [Applause] [Music] died believing in case it wasn't them. They died in the faith. And the Bible says that those that raised, those that died in Christ, they will raise &gt;&gt; with the same faith that was in their heart. Is this making sense to you, friends? &gt;&gt; We have a a 21st century message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can go back. You can go back home and become all entangled and engulfed. But I would say to you this morning, refrain from being swallowed up &gt;&gt; by this life. &gt;&gt; If we're swallowed up with this life, we'll stay with this life. I don't want to be hung here to this life. I don't want to be attached to this life. We want to be in the world, but not of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's achievement in the evolution of his redemptive work. The prophet of God said the evolution of the spirit being given more and more. And I'll give you the quote. He said because the body is building coming to the head which is Christ in invisible union. He said in each generation, in each generation, this is another one. You young people who are just at camp. This is your generation. In each generation, God has allotted his word. It's all here. &gt;&gt; It's all here. And you don't you don't really need me to try to enthuse you to a certain level. That's not the point. The point is that I take we take we accept and acknowledge and I know that this assembly will agree with me. We acknowledge that God has sent his word for this day to this generation. &gt;&gt; Within this generation, all various age groups, all various backgrounds, but there are those amongst us, and I put myself in that number by God's grace, I trust that I may experience this thing. You know, I just said to the Lord, "Well, if if you're making this a reality to me, I'm just renewed in my faith that I will experience the change of the body and the going home by the rapture." &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't happen, let me enthuse someone else. Let me inspire someone else to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you that are here and you have your youth and you have your strength, let me say to you, I would either I would sooner believe it and die believing it than just settle back and not believe it. &gt;&gt; I don't think that should be the foremost thought in our minds. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; An invisible union. He said, let's say he created botney life. Here's the evolution. Then he created animal life. Next he created human life and kind of an evolution rising higher. So so has it been in God in his church. And then he goes through a justification, sanctification. He said that's pulling his bride out. Now he's creating. Why do you think that the prophet is speaking this at the very ending of his ministry? Because he's trying to tell them and this is invisible union. trying to tell them unequivocally that it's been going higher and higher and then he calls it the evolution of the spirit being given more and more. You can read all you want. Go into all the scientific achievements. Go into all the all the writings and readings and whatever more on evolution. You'll never hear that kind of phrase, the evolution of the spirit. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that motion. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of what's happening there. &gt;&gt; The evolution of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pulling it higher and higher. &gt;&gt; I want to go on record this morning in front of you people. I'm calling on God. Take me higher and higher in the evolution of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; If no one else wants to go, let them stay. If they want to stay with their little things and little pep things, let them stay. They want to stay attached to the world, let them stay. But by God's grace, [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to go higher and higher. &gt;&gt; I want to enthuse you to go higher and higher. &gt;&gt; Become a part of this evolution. I'm not preaching a sermon. I'm talking to you. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what God has spoken to my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm in danger of becoming a fanatic here this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean business. &gt;&gt; Lest we lest we have spent our time in vain. &gt;&gt; What are we doing here? &gt;&gt; Just coming to church, spending all these years. I've labored among him for over 35 years. Tried to be an example. What would be the purpose of all this energy and loss of life? &gt;&gt; I and my family want to take a a vacation in in September. I think it's the second time that we've been able to take some days together as a family. We've given that up. &gt;&gt; Many of you maybe go with your families. We haven't been able to go as a family because of the gospel, the burden of the gospel. And I don't think that's a big sacrifice. I really don't. Our focus, my focus has to be the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Either this is a reality. &gt;&gt; Or it's a just a vain emptiness. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in religion. Everybody's got religion. You understand? We're not interested in just going to church and having camp meetings. We're interested in the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; And then the preaching of that word will create faith &gt;&gt; to receive what that promise is. &gt;&gt; Did I make that clear? It's not just simply believing in something of of a past day, but it's believing what God sent you. &gt;&gt; That's why I so appreciate what that brother, the Chinese brother, who was released out of prison and then being interrogated uh by the authorities and they said, "Why do you believe this man, William Brham?" He said, "I don't. It's not William Brham. It's what God sent through him to me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not just somebody from Jeffersonville, Indiana. Not just somebody from any place, but it's what God sent through him to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not just how to be better people, just how to get along in this world, but it's how to get you from this place to that place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; After he saw it. After he saw it. and and I'm standing in front of his one just after the curtain after be going beyond the curtain of time I sat on a hillside with him and he just looked at that great expanse of marvelous creation of God's beauty just so marvelous and looking this way I didn't know even what he was doing looked up and down said brother Eddie on the other side it's very much like this &gt;&gt; gave me such a desire &gt;&gt; to go there. &gt;&gt; And when you get there, he said, you'll find little paths, little trails. You walk down one of those one day, you'll find me. &gt;&gt; I'm planning on it. &gt;&gt; I'm planning on it. As much as I plan to go out that door this afternoon, I'm planning on it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That trail is there. &gt;&gt; Long before this church was here, that trail was there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a reality, friends. &gt;&gt; It's not just some foggy uh mystical thing out there. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Don't let anything stop you. &gt;&gt; I say in the name of the Lord, don't let anything stop you. Don't let job stop you. Don't let economics stop you. Don't let anything stop you. &gt;&gt; Is it all right? I tell you something, friends. They get down to these fairs and they get down at these ball games and the gym the world Olympics are on. My goodness, supposed to be some great achievements. This is the achievement. This is faith's achievement. In each age he said God sent out his word. So the scripture says then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Not merely just reading the word of God that I want to emphasize, but the word of God that he sent to you. In fact, is because we're so individual, so much individuals, God may speak something to you and it wouldn't mean anything to anyone else. That's true. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because it is to you. &gt;&gt; It is to your situation. It involves your circumstances and God will speak to you and give you an opportunity to believe that and you can say I accept that. &gt;&gt; I accept that. I would like to I would like to have a greater measure of faith. I really would. I have a great desire. And I was speaking to the Lord this morning and that's why that prayer and that quote of brother Brandham's meant so much to me. He said we hunger for apostolic times again in this age of the resurrection and the rapture. These are just my notes to myself. It was absolutely necessary that God would send a word that is focused around those events. And we may I may I may say something now that you may not understand. The focus of the message, the objective of the message is not to gather just a bride. That's not the objective. The objective of the message is to take that bride to her bridegroom. &gt;&gt; That's the objective. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to fall short of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's to take you from here &gt;&gt; to there. &gt;&gt; And that is so that is so out of this world. It is so beyond the earthly. Well, we're in contact with that every day. I'm in my study there and I had the brothers from the sound up there come and they said, "Shut your cell phone off." Why? Well, because I got it on I You can never hear it anyway. I just got it on vibrate. No, but they says that interferes with our our system, our sound system up there. It does. Now, if I sat there at my desk, I could have really been distracted. Now, I want to figure that one out. How is something coming on my hip that's affecting things out there coming through these speakers up here and going out over on the internet? I I'm not going to do it till I figure that one out. How are you going to understand that? There's waves and sounds going through you right now. There's voices going through you right now. &gt;&gt; How are you going to understand that? This whole uh you know electric magnetic field. How are we going to understand that? We don't understand it. So it's already way beyond us. Just this life &gt;&gt; just something that they achieved in some laboratory. It's way beyond us. And that's man &gt;&gt; with a little brain, &gt;&gt; a little insignificant brain &gt;&gt; that has that has achieved that. What do you think God's achieving? &gt;&gt; I'd like your mind I'd like you just to release your mind. Release your faith. What is God wanting to achieve? Don't go back. Please don't go back tomorrow morning to the normal humrum of your everyday life. While you still have to perhaps engage in many of the same thing, the same duties, but let your mind be completely focused on the supernatural. Join me, would you? [Music] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking so much about this And especially you young people, this is your word. This is your message. While you got your life in front of you, while you got things to do, while you got uh you know goals to reach and achievements to make, let me tell you something. This is the achievement. &gt;&gt; This is the achievement. &gt;&gt; If you miss that, you'll you haven't achieved anything. Oh, but I retired early. Oh, I made a fistful of money. Oh, I got some I won I won some great, you know, things in life. No, you failed. &gt;&gt; You failed. Regardless of what you came to in life, you're a failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we don't make that [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to give you two or three things. I'm preaching this way on purpose. Incidentally, I'd like to lay before the congregation an achievement that I trust. I don't want to preach at you. I want to say I trust that we can all attain to it. That is the achievement of not having only received the message but believing it in such simplicity that we are we achieve rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; And here's what he said. I pray father that they'll realize it isn't trying to condemn them what they had. It's only trying to give them more rapturing grace. For the hour will come when we will we will have to have rapture power. Not only to heal the body, but to change in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, Christ will be so real into their bodies till he can change it by his great death and what he purchased. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message Leodysian church age, he said he is the true witness. And he said that he said in that the the true witness is not true as opposed to false. But he said that but one day we'll be changed in the atoms because he said it is the true witness is taking that which is partial and that which is the realization of that. So the true witness and listen. Oh I wish I just hope you can see it. That was the that was what the Lord spoke to the seventh church age messenger. Not to any of the others but to the last one. Why the last one? Cuz we're the people of that message. And he's saying this is the true witness. Not true as opposed to false. He said, not true as opposed to false. This is the true witness. Because the true witness is this is the realization message. This is the full realization. Hallelujah. This is what everyone else prayed for. This is what they sought to enter into. This is the realization perfect realization message &gt;&gt; and it's been given so that you can take it and believe it &gt;&gt; with everything that's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Now I don't perhaps if I speak very very openly I don't want you to go away in in some a negative way but you know we we we pray for things. How many here have tried to have faith? I have to put up both my hands. We've tried to have faith. We've prayed for things and it didn't happen. And then another time comes and and it just something's dropped into you. Brother talks about faith. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's a substance. Now, friends, I feel that I fall short of this. very short of this because I had a man say to me once. He was sitting in a congregation, not while I was pastoring. It was another church. He was sitting in his congregation and he was just observing. He was observing people being prayed for, the sick being prayed for. And he wasn't professing anything. And I stepped back and I kind of put my hand on his shoulder and said, 'You know, do you feel that this this Christ and this gospel and salvation is for you? And he said, well, actually, he said, you know, I I I don't know. He said, uh, I see you up there praying for people that are sick and so on, and they're not getting healed, so how would I have any confidence you pray for me that I'd be saved? And &gt;&gt; that threw me for a loop &gt;&gt; cuz he was sitting there watching what was happening in the church. He says, "I I don't see it happening. So, how do I know that if you pray for me, I'll have I'll have eternal life?" He would just ask you an honest question. How do I know I'll have eternal life? Well, we don't stop there because on the other hand, there is the sovereignty, the sovereignty of God. God not only does what he wishes to do, but he does it when he wishes to do it. &gt;&gt; And I have prayed for things and they didn't happen. And then other things that I I knew were there. They were in need and they were on my heart and so on. And then God just sends a word and says, "It's done." &gt;&gt; It's actually done. &gt;&gt; Now I'm bringing you down. Now I know that you would say, "Amen. We have received the message with rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; It's where I want to bring you this morning because I'm bringing myself to that point. The way the messenger, the way brother Brandham talked about real faith, if we have the kind of faith that that message is to bring us, we're already over there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not trying to have it. We're not trying to see ourselves over there. We're not We're not trying to generate some faith. You're already over there. &gt;&gt; Hey, I've had it. I've had those kind of experiences where it is already been done. Just forget it. It's already finished. I've had it more than once on things that I didn't were not, you know, critical to my life, but it was done. It was already finished. I've had it in the church. I've had God speak and said, "It's all finished. Tell that person." I didn't even know where the I didn't even know where the information came from. I thought, "Who told me that?" say somebody must have told me that because I was pregnantated with with the knowledge the mind of God. So I was trying to think who told me that. I couldn't even think who told me that. So I thought well I'll go and tell them anyway and go and told them and they wanted to know where'd you hear that. I didn't even know that myself till just now. See that's God. It's already done. Brother Brandham said and and he and he takes that infallible the infallibility of God and links it to the message to the visions. So he said when I see the vision I know that it's all finished. &gt;&gt; That's what God did for him. See as a messenger. Oh friends I hope I get this across here. When he saw the vision it was done. &gt;&gt; He said if God gave me a vision he was going to that I was to go and raise George Washington and go to the grave. He says, "I'd call the world to say it." &gt;&gt; And then he relates the the boy in Finland &gt;&gt; that was raised from the dead. He said to the brothers who were around him, "Are you listening?" He said to the brothers, "If this boy doesn't come to life, I'm a false prophet." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger. And because that never failed, because that never failed. I put all my confidence, all my trust, I'm not I'm not putting all my trust in a bunch of books. I'm not putting all my trust in just that. I'm putting my trust in the God that sent that messenger. &gt;&gt; And the fact that that boy raised from the dead, the fact that a brother sat in my house that has visited him. The fact that I spoke to the woman who drove whose husband drove the car that killed the boy. I can tell you that today because that has happened. I have absolute confidence if that man then takes that and then comes over here and says I was transported beyond the curtain of time. I I I don't want that to be a pie in the sky. I don't want that to be a hope. Everybody, hey, all kinds of people, Pentecost, Baptist, all kinds of people, they all plan to go to heaven. They believe that word with everything that's in them. What makes it different is because this one went by visions &gt;&gt; and the visions never failed. &gt;&gt; He saw the place, saw the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where our faith I'm just trying to now increase your faith. &gt;&gt; To increase your faith, not your desire. We all have the desire but to increase your faith that you can and when faith drops in you see yourself there. &gt;&gt; You don't imagine yourself there you see yourself there. &gt;&gt; And when faith takes hold it affect your own life. &gt;&gt; You live different. &gt;&gt; You have a different a different uh you have a different view of life. You really do. You have a different view of life. Sometimes things go well. Sometimes they go difficult. But that should never change that that perspective that you have, that direction that you have. He said, u just a couple more here before I close. Brother Brandham talks about uh rapturing faith as being like the harvest rain. And then he said God isn't going to plant a new church. He's going to bring his original planting back to the original seed. He is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or the former reign. Next will come the harvest rain or the rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The harvest rain and that is the message coming is the harvest rain. &gt;&gt; And he said that is rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke about the scripture speaks about those that were rich in faith. The scripture speaks about those and several times Jesus talked about those that were weak in faith. You know, here we sit as as believers, but Jesus talked even to his apostles. Why couldn't we cast him out? Oh, ye of little faith. &gt;&gt; Little faith. and and and your messenger. I want you to be really really take this home. Your messenger, I don't want us to live in a in a in a message bubble. &gt;&gt; I don't want us to live just in a message excitement. We've just come out of camp. I don't want to live in a in a message emotion. &gt;&gt; I want to live in a reality. I'd sooner people have be serious and be in a reality and be solid, be unmovable. That's what I like to see. And we have the same the same messenger. He said rapturing faith takes more than divine healing faith. That that that's that smites me because I've prayed for lots of healings and it hasn't happened and then I I have that in my mind. Rapturing faith takes more. So I intend to do something about it. &gt;&gt; I intend to make this a focus. &gt;&gt; I intend to have this on my mind. &gt;&gt; I intend to be obsessed by it. &gt;&gt; I intend to be occupied by it. I intend to be preoccupied by it. &gt;&gt; And I want to suggest to you that we do that together. &gt;&gt; I want to suggest to you that you fill your daytime and you fill and when you go to bed at night that you have this on your mind. &gt;&gt; What do I have in my mind, brother Bisc? What is what you have in your mind? The message for the change of this body has already come. Let me lay hold of that promise. And with this I'm closing. It'd be good for you to take the message, I would encourage you to take the message of perfect faith and I'd like you to pay special attention when brother Brandham begins to relate refer to Jesus Christ. You know of all of all the years of ministry which he had profound city shaking nation shaking ministry I don't have to tell you about it go and read about it yourself Durban Cape Town Johannesburg Bombay India all over United States all over Canada shook millions millions of people. &gt;&gt; I don't have to I don't have to pump up the ministry. It was what it is. &gt;&gt; It's already been done. &gt;&gt; That whole thing came for one specific purpose. To move you and I &gt;&gt; up out of where we are &gt;&gt; and to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose. &gt;&gt; If that message fails in that, then then the message hasn't failed, but we failed to grasp why it came. That's what it came for. And if we believe it and live it and have ourselves focused in that direction and we just keep moving in that way day after day and we bring up our children, we speak to our friends about it. And that is the thing that if I have to go, if I have to go the way of the grave, I would like to go by saying he did whatever he could. He spoke about it all the time. He spoke about this this passing from this life to another place &gt;&gt; and he encouraged everybody else that he could. That's that's the testimony that I would like to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said this of Christ. He said, "Now I want to speak about a different kind of faith, not faith for healing, a different kind of faith." And he said, "In order for this faith to operate," he said, "you must know your position." &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, you must know, you must know I have been called by almighty God to to this particular place in my life. I've been called by God. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; See Jesus Jesus. Now, let me let me just say it so that it would be uh in utter simplicity. Jesus didn't come and think, "Oh, I I know what's going to happen in the future. Oh, I wish I was in I'd like to be in the time of the book of Acts. Oh, I'd like to see those thousands. I've seen thousands leave me. I know that just in the future there's going to be 3,000 come in. There'll be 5,000 come in. Oh, I just want to be at that time. That wasn't it." Or he wasn't going back. Oh, I wish I'd been back in the time of Moses and see all these two million people come out of bondage. No, he knew who he was &gt;&gt; in the day that he was there &gt;&gt; and he believed in that. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. The prophet said he believed in who he was &gt;&gt; and his position that God had given him. &gt;&gt; You have to believe in all your heart. Don't so many so many look in the past. Oh, if we only had those times of the past. That's not what we're after. We're after what God wants right now. &gt;&gt; I want what God wants out of this service. &gt;&gt; I want to see what God wants to do out of this meeting. &gt;&gt; The effect of it. And he said, "In order for that happen, you have to have faith. You have to have faith in the faith. &gt;&gt; You have to actually believe in the God that brought you to this place." &gt;&gt; Then you believe them. say, "Well, I know that God brought me, not this physical building here, but I know God brought me to this position. &gt;&gt; What is your position? I'm a member of the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; according to what has been spoken. I'm a masterpiece because he said I was a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; I am justified because he said I'm justified." This is all part of your position. &gt;&gt; Your position. And once you recognize your position, then you can believe the word that came for this time. I have been called &gt;&gt; to be changed. &gt;&gt; I've been called &gt;&gt; for a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's my whole calling. &gt;&gt; So, we don't get all engaged and involved with, you know, just the little tidbits of life. I know they're important, but don't let them consume you. Whatever you do, don't let them consume you. Let the good times come. Let the good times go. Let the hard times come. Let the hard times go. You have to do it. You just have to do it. &gt;&gt; Have we had it? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We know. I know something about it, friends. I know something about it. And do not become encumbered with just the things of this life. I say it in the name of the Lord. Do not become just encumbered with the things of this life. This thing needs to be your focus. &gt;&gt; When you're at work tomorrow, when you're in the house tomorrow, wherever you are, I would like to see the effect of that as we gather service after service. The effect of a whole body of people that have one single focus in mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see God looking upon us and he's saying, "That's why I sent this message. That's why I sent it. &gt;&gt; I sent it for that one purpose." And I got a people that are believing it. &gt;&gt; Moving on up out of there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he said this, "You must have faith. You must believe it. If you don't believe it, then it won't work. You know, I read that. I'm thinking very very deep. And the reason why I'm being a little hesitant because a lot of it's personal, but like I've said to people, there's a degree of importance of timing. You're going to get in your car this morning and uh or this afternoon and you turn on the key and you drive out of this parking lot. You're not going to go and check the tires and check the gas gauge and check every last thing and check all your instrumentation. You're just going to go in there and turn the key on. Way you go. May I get down the road and go put put I'm out of gas. I'm going to have to call aa or get somebody to come and get me. Doesn't make any difference with a car. It's not that important. Don't do that in an airplane. Yeah, &gt;&gt; don't do that in an airplane. &gt;&gt; This might surprise you. I have a private pilot's license. That's one of the first things they tell you to do. You check the tires, you check your instruments, and you make sure you got fuel. Cuz if you run out, there isn't any gas station in the sky. You're coming down where you didn't plan to come down. See, so when when when the messenger says this, he had faith in his power and he says, "If you don't," he said he said, "If you don't if you don't believe it, then it won't work." Oh well. Oh, I got a pain in my back and I, you know, somehow I'm a little weak in my faith and it doesn't really work and I go on with the pain so I got the pain. That's like having gas, running out of gas in your car and it doesn't work. You don't want that with regards to rapture. &gt;&gt; You don't want that when we're going to space. &gt;&gt; You get the point? &gt;&gt; Get my point? &gt;&gt; We can have these little afflictions and these little things that afflict us in this life and we pray for it and say, "Well, yeah, I guess I haven't got faith." Okay. But you can't afford to take that attitude &gt;&gt; with regards to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Okay, while we're in church, you know, kind of, oh, how we're going through another service. No, you want to come in this service. You want to come in the next service. You want to come every time and say, God, give that man something &gt;&gt; having to do with my eternal welfare. Give that man something that will contribute to my going home. &gt;&gt; Give that man something that'll help me to get out of this place. &gt;&gt; Inspire him. Cause him to say something and cause me to hear it. &gt;&gt; Let me be anointed to receive that nugget &gt;&gt; to help me get out of this place. This is my focus. This is my life. This is my whole purpose. &gt;&gt; It's why I go to church. That's why I pray. &gt;&gt; That's why I believe the message. That's why we hear these things. That's why we've gone through what we've gone through is to get out of this place. If without that, &gt;&gt; the Apostle Paul said, you know, if we lose that, we've lost everything. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said we gain the whole world and lose our soul. We lost everything. Apostle Paul spoke about it. So friends, that's my message to you this morning. That will be the greatest achievement of your faith and I pray that you will and I will achieve that great achievement. Let's just have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, how how important how impressed I am. Oh God, how moved I am, Father, to think that you in your kindness to you in your extra measure of grace would actually bring a message of rapturing grace, rapturing faith, and lay it out. Oh God. Oh God. I don't want to be part of the group or part of those that remain and still will come to altars and still will hear messages preached. I don't want to be here during that time. I want to be beyond in that other dimension, another realm. Oh God, that you have prepared the place that you have prepared and you have called us for that express purpose. And that's why we are where we are today, Lord, because we have received it. We have believed it. But now, if you send a messenger, Lord, to his own church trying to inspire and trying to increase their faith. Surely, surely that would be a burden of my own heart, Lord, to see that faith increases, God, to put it in their minds. Take, I pray, by the Holy Spirit and lodge it in their hearts. and lodge it in their minds. Oh God, I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, deal with every heart. Father, speak with us. I pray in Jesus Christ's name and for your glory. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to just say a word about the after effects of the services and the camps. I want to speak to those of you that God dealt with and God spoke to in the camp and in the services. I won't say the camp, but in the services. Whatever you do, go from that point, go from that that uh level where God brought you and drive a stake there and go on from there. &gt;&gt; There's a good number. I know that you were prayed with and I prayed with a good number. I I actually visually saw God doing things, great things in the lives of the people. And I felt on my heart today to say, don't don't settle back at that point. Don't lose any of what God gave you. Be a soldier. &gt;&gt; Be a brave warrior. and take your sword in your hand and the shield of faith and say, "I go from this place forward. I'm not going to lose any ground." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go from here forward. I want to sing faith of our fathers living still. You can stand if you would please. We're not looking back, but we've built on from there. Hallelujah. We've built from that place onto where we are now. [Music] Faith of our father living still today in spite of dark and fire and sword. Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy when we hear that glorious word. Faith of our father's glory faith. We will be true to thee till death. Our father's chain in prison dark. We're still in heart and conscious free. How sweet would be their children's faith if they like could die for thee. Faith of our father. Holy faith we will be true to thee till death. Faith of our father. We will love both and fool in all our strife and preach thee. as knows how by timely works and meryallel [Music] And I would like to just we sang uh consecrate me now to thy service, Lord. Uh draw me nearer. I like because I want to sing the first and the second verse. And before we sing this, you know, if we were sitting together in your home, I could tell you the same thing. But I'll just tell you as a whole congregation, I was very, very affected this morning. I was affected by his presence. [Music] And I just couldn't I couldn't move away from the fact this whole message to me. The whole message came and all I saw was the promises of the catching away. I went to the Bible and I read. I show you a great mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. I just like I anchored my faith. We shall all be changed. We shall all be changed. And I felt almost a commission go to the people. And I also understood they may not understand it. They may not un really understand but tell them tell them we shall all be changed and that the word that they have believed is that transforming word &gt;&gt; and they must believe that word. You must believe that word. You must believe that you've been called to that word. &gt;&gt; I've been called to it. &gt;&gt; And thus he will give me the grace to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe in your position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe in it with everything that's in you. Believe in your position. The prophet said that's the only way that the word worked for Jesus Christ. Think of it. The only way it worked. And if that's the only way it worked for him, it's the only way it'll work for you and I. &gt;&gt; I am thine. I am. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. I have heard thy voice and thy love to me. [Music] you in the arms of faith as we lift up to thee. So draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to the cross where [Music] drawer nearer nearer blessing to thy preious leading We're only going to sing the second verse as the last verse. I'm going to ask you to look at the words very, very carefully. Consecrate me now. Not tomorrow, but now to thy service. You've been called to be a farmer, be the best farmer there is. You're called to be a carpenter, whatever that is. Called to be a housewife, be the best that there is. But be in your position. Know your position. Know your place. Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord, by the power of grace divine. Let's look to him as we sing it. Consecrate me now to thy service by the power of grace. and let my soul look up with [Applause] [Music] and I will be lost in drawer [Music] to the cross. There [Music] to thy precious [Music] a gracious loving Lord Jesus. [Music] You have reserved a place near to you, near to the heart of God, near to your bleeding side where we are invited. We can come and be near you. Oh shepherd, shepherd of the flock. &gt;&gt; Oh high priest, touched with the feeling of our infirmities. Oh high priest that knows the need and sees the desire. Lord, you are a great burdenbearer. You see, father what is upon our hearts, each individual at this moment. And I pray, oh God of Israel, oh God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, God of the flock, God who led the flock, who led the flock under Moses, God who led the flock. And today, Lord, you've sent your angel. You have led us so tenderly. We can say my guide. We can say you are our leader. We have leadership. Thank you, Father, for your kindness. And oh Lord, there are so many other generations of people that have lived and lived, I pray, faithful to their time. You did not call us for ages past. You've called us to this moment. And what a time, what a day that we're in. And Lord, regardless of the wall of sin, as it would be, regardless of the power of temptation, I can declare, Lord, that you have given us. And we thank you for the power that you've given us that is greater than any temptation of the world. I pray for those, oh Lord, that have dedicated their lives, not only this morning, but in the services of the last week. Oh God. Oh God. I know that you hear me, Lord. And I pray with all that is in me with all the hearts that are united together. Father, see our faith as we as we reach forward for these lives, oh God. And I pray you'll keep them in the way of holiness and righteousness. I pray that you'll keep them, oh God. May it be a settled and anchored thing that you have done. And may they set their sights on eternal life. May they set their sights, oh God, on this marvelous, marvelous promise of this age. Oh God, the change and the transformation of these lives and these bodies into the eternal. For you have said through your mighty apostle Paul, immortality must the mortal must put on must put on immortality and corruption must put on incorruption. Oh God, here we are. Here we are, oh God, in our lives. Tomorrow will be a day older and the next year older if time should go on. But you have given us a word that all of that process be reversed, oh God, and we step into that theophony realm. Oh, thank you, Father. Thank you, Father, for the reality. Bless your people this day, I pray. And may their lives be a rich testimony and be a pleasure to you in your sight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. Going to dismiss you in the name of our Lord Jesus and pray you'll just go be a blessing to someone else. God bless you. You're dismissed. Amen. [Music] [Music] Come on. Okay.
