But that's not the truth that God was talking about in the scriptures when he said, "Whatsoever [music] things are true to think on these things. For when God speaks truth, it's the truth that sets us free. Amen.

Brother Bis, God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Happy new year. &gt;&gt; I was speaking to the Lord this morning and I was thinking and saying what would really make us happy or make me happy if the rapture took place. &gt;&gt; So I will kind of be preaching from that direction. I don't think you'll be disappointed. You wouldn't be disappointed if the rapture took place. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're studying. I don't care what your goal in life is. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much uh you know we put into life, we wouldn't be discouraged or we wouldn't be saddened by &gt;&gt; changing. And I'll be along that line this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] I just want to say that uh I believe brother Tim Dodd and Sister Sarah will be returning this week uh having a time in Johannesburg and South Africa and also in Durban. Uh so we're thankful for that. We're also thankful for the greetings also that I heard brother Ryan give from different places and uh we just want to uh show our appreciation also for the saints from Reton, Seattle, Tacoma. God bless you from Victoria. God bless you. And uh we appreciate it, don't we? And for those that are streaming, I we had so many comments also from the local congregation uh for the watch night service and actually my wife was the first one to speak to me. She said it was just so spectacular to see the different groups, groups from China uh sing for us. the group from uh Congo. And they weren't all from Congo, but we give Congo the credit. [laughter] And uh the worship uh we're we're here to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not here to play church. &gt;&gt; We're here to receive something from God. &gt;&gt; I would like everyone to give their full attention to the word today. Uh the Lord began to speak to me. I've been on this subject for quite some time. Uh then I was awakened very very early this morning and I finally I just the thoughts were coming. The message was coming. Uh I thought I was all done last night. Uh, I had to get up and uh early this morning and so I'll be just speaking to you, taking my [clears throat] taking my time if that's all right with you. And while you're standing, I'm going to have brother John come and read the scripture for me. Uh, can you do you have a microphone you could use? I want to read and you can turn in your Bibles please to Luke the 24th chapter. And I know that I've spoken from it quite a few times. I'm not going to be preaching from it. I'm going to make a I'm going to make a proposal to you and uh that proposal has to do with the turning a corner. I think before we read, I will just uh give you a give you perhaps a head start on where I want to go, Lord willing. I have not been able to shake from my mind that Luke 24, Luke 24 has been uh has been the what shall I say the uh has been put forward by the messenger as as a prophetic event. uh Luke 24 as I thought about it this morning and and and uh it says more about the event of the after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And I know soon as we read Luke 24, we think of Easter. Do not think of Easter. I I want to you to see that the life and ministry of Jesus Christ started very simply. Started with the sermon on the mount. Had healings and miracles of various kinds, simple and difficult, raising the dead and so on so forth. And the and and the feeding the people, the multiplication of the the bread and the fishes, all of those things. But then those things tapered off. Then he began to speak very very seriously about the son of man will be slain will be in the grave three days. But all of this had to do because now we have a messenger in this time that explains he comes as son of man as a prophet. He comes on earth God word in flesh as a son of man is on earth and then he becomes son of God because God is a spirit. So he he returns as the holy spirit. So now Luke 24 is just a junction between the resurrection and the ending of the son of man ministry and the beginning of the son of god. And they and he tells them to go and tarry in Jerusalem until you be endued. It's not enough for me to be with you. It must be I must be in you. &gt;&gt; And that is the only way that could happen. So there was a great event taking place. &gt;&gt; And uh and so I would say and then brother Brennham he puts it in our language. We turn a corner. He said anybody can build a wall &gt;&gt; but it takes a master mason to turn a corner. And uh and and if you want my opinion, my sincere opinion, there's no corner that has been turned in the scripture like the one Jesus turned from mortal to immortal. &gt;&gt; Raising from the dead, &gt;&gt; paying the cost of our sins, &gt;&gt; and raising from the dead, and then saying, "You will have a body like my glorious body. That's what I trust 2016 would bring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we'll read in the Bible, if you would, Brother John, please, from Luke the 13th, the 24th chapter, starting with verse 13 down to 32. And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem, about three score furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass that while they communed together, and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, "What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad?" And the one of them whose name was Cleopus answering, said unto him, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?" And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty indeed, and word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Yay, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the separ. And when they found not his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepre and found it even so as the women had said, but him they saw not. And he said unto them, "Oh fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?" And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village whether they went. And he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent." And he went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them, he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them, and their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, "Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?" &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll bow in a prayer. Dear heavenly father, we are here gathered today and all of those that may be streaming. I pray that your holy divine presence will surround every individual &gt;&gt; and that the Holy Spirit will not only surround us but brood over every individual. Oh God, let it be an individual experience. I pray that while we're here on this first uh Lord's day of the 2016, I pray, oh God, you will emphasize and make it a profound gathering. I pray that the people, oh God, will be made ready for whatever you have in store for us in this coming year. May it not be just so many church services. May it not just be driving, oh God, to church to be here in attendance, even though we appreciate that, but meet the people in their homes. Meet them in their jobs. Meet them in their schools, oh God. Be with them, I pray, and reveal yourself to them. In the name of Jesus Christ, and for the glory of God himself, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I I want to speak to you on Jesus himself drew near, but the phrase that I wish for to impress you is he went with them. I I stood here or I sat on the platform. I can't remember whether I was standing or sitting. And uh I've been pondering this subject for some weeks. And I thought and I was in prayer and I was just saying Lord Jesus. There were three things that I wanted to stress. [clears throat] And the first one was he opened the scriptures and the second one is he opened their eyes and the third one is he opened their understanding. And I can tell you that it's not sufficient just to have our eyes opened. We need to go further. Many have had their eyes open to the they've heard the scriptures. They've heard the messenger. They've felt the impression and the impulse of the Holy Spirit opening scripture. But it's more than opening scripture. Then you have to have your eyes opened. And then last but not least is the understanding needs to be expanded so you know how that relates to the your life and the time that you're in. This is what's important. And so I feel uh I feel a great responsibility from the perspective of the ministry uh from myself and the other ministers that minister here because I see Jesus as a great shepherd leading those people and persistently staying with them until the scriptures were opened until their eyes were opened and until their understanding was opened and then he vanished from them. &gt;&gt; He left from them and the corner had been turned. &gt;&gt; I knew that brother Brandham had said that. He said it in December of 1964. at the end of 1964 in December [clears throat] in the in the message. Now friends, when I refer to him, I want you to think I'm I want you to remember I'm not just referring to a man. I'm referring to someone who I believe was ordained of God to uh for his life to act out and to function in a certain way. So it will replay uh the very life of Jesus Christ. And we all sing the chorus to be like Jesus, to be like Jesus. All I ask is to be like him. I don't know if that's really all we ask. You know, that's all we really want. Do you really want to live like him? Uh he became poor that others could become rich. He suffered terribly on behalf of other people and we want but we do want to be like him. But I sat on the platform here and I said, "Lord, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me till the scriptures are opened. Stay with me until my eyes are opened to those scriptures. And stay with me until I have my understanding opened that I might be able to relate those scriptures to the time that we're in. Uh, I [clears throat] want you to try to put, you'll have to be very, very alert to not just hear, don't don't look on this as a sermon. I I want to try to impart to you some instruction of what the message is all about and why we believe what we believe. Uh, [clears throat] in the me in the sermon in the message, who do you say this is? That was in December of 1964. And that's the first time that I can find brother Brandham refers now any builder can build a wall. He can build that. But it takes a real master mechanic to turn a corner. When you got to cut the corner, that's the time it takes. It shows whether you really are a stonemason or not. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now on these corners is when trouble comes." Spiritually speaking, when Luther turned the corner, that's where the problem came. When Wesley turned the corner, that's where the problem came. When the power of the Pentecost came and the people turned the corner, that's where the problem. And in the message there's not not the great healings and not the discerning of the hearts and not almost like an entertainment and they wanted that to continue because they were building a wall. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's a wall and then they wanted that to continue and they expected to continue but he turned a corner. Then they were disappointed. &gt;&gt; Oh then that's so harsh. And he was telling them you're backsliding. You're take adopting the traits of the world, becoming more worldly in fashion and in dress and in all the mannerisms and in conversation and in in in religion and in worship and and the worship has gone entirely to entertainment. &gt;&gt; You know that it's a show. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come here for a show. &gt;&gt; Jesus came here for salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it's not just a show. &gt;&gt; So he turned a corner. And then the next time he refers to it is January of 65, the next month. He says, "But we're not building a wall like we start off with Luther's message. You go right on straight line or a Pentecostal message." He said, "We're turning a corner." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in December of 1965, we're coming right to the end. Those of you that are followers and believers of the message, I want you to pay very strict attention. Then in December of 1965, in the rapture, he says, "It's easy when somebody turns a corner. It's easy when somebody turns a corner of a of a brickmason. Turns a corner. starts everybody laying their bricks right down the same row. The message didn't come to give us better quality bricks. &gt;&gt; The message came to show us the word and the and the time that we're in. And uh so I just want to say stay with us a wee bit, please. and starts everybody laying their bricks right down the same row like a certain denomination starts and starts rolling down the row. It's all right. But when you get to them turns when you have to turn back the other way. Now God isn't building a wall. &gt;&gt; He's building a house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's many cuts and turns that he's predicted here in the Bible. and the turns. Anybody could try to make a turn, but it must be according to the blueprint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said in the rapture, starts out a paragraph, we're at a corner. &gt;&gt; The rapture will be a big major corner. &gt;&gt; That's the promise of the scripture. And Apostle Paul says it, we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; That's going to be a corner of all corners. &gt;&gt; When a mass of people, a group of people defeat death, &gt;&gt; which is the purpose Jesus died, &gt;&gt; he died that we might live. &gt;&gt; Not this ordinary life, but he died that we might have eternal life. Eternal life is is something we haven't tasted of yet in in a physical way. But we will have a body like under his glorious body and we will live eternal. That's eternal life. &gt;&gt; And that's the corner that I'm looking for. He said as long as we're he said we're we're at a corner in the rapture message which was December the 4th, 1965. And his last message to the public was in 1965. I listened to it. Leadership. It was on the 7th of December. And we just I believe that's 50 years on the 7th of December. That's Jubilee. I I I think I'm correct in saying that we're in the Jubilee year because the 49th year is not the beginning of a jubilee, but the 50th year. You know, those things might not be significant, but they might be very significant. So, I wouldn't downplay it, &gt;&gt; but we're in 2016 now. We're in a jubilee year. Uh we have passed the 50th and we're into a jubilee time. And now he preaches his last message. Lips are sealed and he vanishes. He's taken from the face of the earth. And he speaks starts off with the rapture. Things that are to be modern events. Modern events made clear by prophecy. Luke 24. That's the chapter I'm going to be in now. Luke 24. The modern events. There's something impending. Modern events mean something that's overhanging almost. It's just almost almost uh delayed. And uh so I I've been pondering for weeks if not years Luke 24 and seeing more and more and more. And then this morning uh this turning the corner. I just I had to get up and start making these notes and let you know that in the in the message leadership, excuse me if I'm chopping up my thought a wee bit here. He said, "As long as you're building a wall one straight way, it's fine. But the the brick layers can go right down the row." But then you have to turn a corner. So I would have to say he's he's saying something to us in 12 months and especially in the last few hours of his life. He's talking about turning a corner. never talked about it in all the 30 years of ministry, but now he's talking about turning a corner. I would say he's trying to point the people who are following and Jesus and he chooses the scripture where Jesus is walking with the two men on the way to Emmas. &gt;&gt; He's trying to let them know the corner's been turned. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you remember the things that were spoken? And uh and they're continuing on with their normal life. The women are preparing spices for the body. Uh Joseph of Arythea has taken the body down and begged it from Pilate. And you you we we think of all that. Well, that's just the crucifixion and the resurrection. and that is Easter and so on so forth. We've just come through what they considered the Christmas season and they got it all wrong to begin with. &gt;&gt; He wasn't born in December the 25th anyway. That's just somebody's concocted that in their mind and they built a huge huge religion out of it. But that's not what it is. God sent his son from the bosom of the father &gt;&gt; for this was his desire. He's going to he's going to redeem the earth. And this is the one he's going to do it through, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing. And here's Jesus himself walking with his two with his disciples who they have heard that he was going to be risen. He he told them plainly that he was going to be slain by the leaders and he's going to be raised. I have a question for the congregation. I have a question. And the question is, how is it that all those people saw the bread, saw the fishes, saw the miracles, had the healings, raised from the dead, all of these things, and then his own disciples, even at the last Passover, how he tells them that he will be slain. He they're with him when he goes to Gethsemane. And and how come there's nobody at the tomb? H how come nobody's at the mouth of the seeler? Not one. &gt;&gt; Not one person. &gt;&gt; The only people that go there are some women to anoint his body which they find isn't there. So they've made the spices. How is it? You know, you know why it is? We're the same kind of people. &gt;&gt; We're the same kind of people. the word of God and we God can send a messenger with the most infallible uh gift of God and have the Lord Jesus Christ speak directly out of his mouth and have him say and you can hear it and some people won't even pick up a tape to hear it. &gt;&gt; Put yourself in the same place and say, "Well, well, the the the message is full of it, but I've never heard it. I've never heard him say, "That's my voice, but that's not me speaking." You need to hear it. &gt;&gt; And if you don't, then put yourself in the same bracket of those who wouldn't go to the tomb. &gt;&gt; I I I don't I don't I'm just not involved enough. Well, then it's just church to you. It's got to go beyond church. It's got to go beyond all the scriptures. Oh my, I've never heard that before. That is so wonderful. It's not enough. &gt;&gt; I'm here today to say it's not enough. You've got to go till the personal eyes are opened and you know who he is and it's got to go beyond that. You got to go to where the understanding is open. &gt;&gt; And then he was ready to depart and bless them and tell them to tar in Jerusalem. So we do not want to be just builders of a wall. But I want to say that there is a correlation between uh Luke 24 and what it is that you're expecting. You're not just sitting here to take in a Sunday morning service, but I'm sure that you're sitting here to be to be better prepared, to be made better, more aware of uh of what it is we're expecting. Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to have suggest to you that we we should just go on and on and on. There should be preparation &gt;&gt; and right over this pulpit and you listening should be on the edge of your seats in preparation. We're in preparation. God called me into this message for something. And and the if the Bible has pre has preached anything or persuaded us about anything, it has said this. Apostle Paul, I'm sure you'll agree with Apostle Paul. He says, "And behold, I send the promise of my father." Jesus said, "Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you." But Apostle Paul says, "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither do corruption inherit uh incorruption. And behold, I show you a great mystery." That's Apostle Paul. Behold, I show you a great mystery. Here's the mystery. We shall not all sleep, &gt;&gt; but we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus himself didn't sleep, he he didn't continue to sleep. He was resurrected and he rose and he's awake and walked with the disciples. He's trying to show them exactly what Paul is saying. Behold, I show you a great mystery. &gt;&gt; I'm awake. &gt;&gt; I'm alive. I'm with you. And I'm going to stay with you. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that two disciples were on their way to Emmas. &gt;&gt; I want to say to everyone here today, you're on your way someplace. You're on your way in your job. You're on your way in your profession. You're on your way in your studies. But you're on your way someplace. &gt;&gt; You're going someplace. You're headed someplace. &gt;&gt; I'm here announcing to you, uh, I I know it. You are you you have some plan. You've got some agenda. You've got some program. Oh, I want to, you know, I I I anticipate getting married or I anticipate having a family or I anticipate retiring or I anticipate doing something this next year. Maybe we should all agree that we should anticipate that a change and and and it's not sufficient that we just make uh uh a tradition out of the phrases of the message. I hear the body change. I don't want to just hear about it. I want to know that I'm moving towards it that something is happening within my own experience that I that I'm being in tune with the scripture. I'm being in tune with the time and it's important for us to I feel that I have a solemn duty today. I show you a great mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; And in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, we'll be changed, &gt;&gt; transformed. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So the the Bible tells us that the two of them went that same day to the village called Emmas. They're on their way to Emmas because they live there. You may live in Vancouver or Suri or Tacoma or Victoria. You live there and you you're going to after this service you're going to return there. And they were on their way. It was totally unexpected. &gt;&gt; It wasn't unexpected that they would go back to Emmas, but it was unexpected that they'd have company. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And this person that was with them. And when you leave this place, I've already prayed that the God who went with them, that that same Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, will make himself so real to you, so near to you that you'll begin to understand. You'll begin to grasp things that were spoken. Oh, and maybe things that you heard, things that you've read in the scripture and it starts coming in like a wave. Don't don't push it off. Give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; Yield to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And something starts to twinge within you. Maybe some of you haven't been baptized in his name yet, and you need to represent his resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to come up out of this water &gt;&gt; being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And it's one of the fundamental things. Maybe you say, "Well, that is such a simple thing." And this was just a simple thing, too. We're going home to we're going home to Emmas. &gt;&gt; And and furthermore, we're very discouraged about everything. &gt;&gt; They should have been at the tomb. They should have been at the tomb and not walking towards a mass. &gt;&gt; They could have been happy. &gt;&gt; But they're on their way to a mass. And you're sitting here today. You've driven to church. Oh, and maybe it's a uh, you know, the first Sunday of New Year's, we ought to be. If that's all, I can tell you it's a whole lot more than that. And in the mind of God, I can tell you I speak on behalf of him today. He has much more in mind for than for you to just be here to church and to hear some words. He he has ordained certain words to come down into your lodge into your soul and to stay there and to bring forth uh some eternal fruit to him. &gt;&gt; He wants a glory out of this service. and they talked together of all the things which had happened and I've heard as I've sat down and spoken with different ones and your conversation is about our conversation I could say may be about those some have left maybe very dear friends, maybe family. Hey folks, listen. Don't let me have to say it again. These folks all went through that. &gt;&gt; That's all part of turning the corner. &gt;&gt; Everybody ain't going to turn the corner. &gt;&gt; Some may not turn the corner, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if my family goes with me, fine. If they don't go with me, I just continue on because I must carry on. This is the direction God has headed me and I'm on my way. And I have somebody walking beside me. He has brought me to this message. He has spoken something very clear to my soul and it has it's it's been such a such a surge, such an enlightenment, so glorious. This is not some emotional thing, friends. This is something you can't escape. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother John. Sister Sephora, wonderful to see you. And they talked about the things. And the Bible says, "And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them." That was wonderful, wasn't it? And he said unto them, "What manner of communications are these that you have one to another and are sad?" He noticed that you're not happy, you're sad, you're heavy-hearted. What are what are your communications about? You may you may think that I'm just talking to somebody and may not realize that you actually have another person listening to you &gt;&gt; from another realm, from another dimension. And his determination is I want to make myself so real to them that they will live for nothing nothing more than coming to where I am. and I am determined to bring them to where I am. And the Bible says, "And they said unto them, what manner of communications are these?" And the bi Bible also said that they were they communed together and they reasoned together. And uh I I'd like to just enlarge on that please a wee bit. when they communed together and reasoned together and the Bible says that their eyes were Holden and Holden has two has two meanings. One is that they were not permitted to see but that's not just by itself. That's not the full meaning of it. that they were not permitted to see, but that someone was actually holding back what they needed to say. &gt;&gt; And their eyes were holding and the and it it is to lay hold. The actual word that is used is to lay hold on, to hold fast, to get possession of. and their eyes were holden so that they would continue on in the direction that they were going because Jesus knew that when they got to their place they were going to ex they were going to express what they really were and that was they had the character &gt;&gt; to invite and constrain him &gt;&gt; to literally constrain him to come in &gt;&gt; because in in that act of constraining him they sat and had food. And while they sat sat and had food, he broke the bread. And and I've said it before many times, but it was in he was made known in the breaking of the bread. And so many uh feel that that is just exclusively how he breaks the word. It's more than that. It is the head of the house &gt;&gt; breaks the bread. &gt;&gt; Only the father of the house breaks the bread. And so when they sat down, he took the bread. He took the bread and broke the bread. And then they say, "Oh, the head of the house is here." &gt;&gt; The one representing the father is here. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the house. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham refers to it many times when he took and broke the bread. He said he did something like he did before. He had done this before. He broke the bread before and it clicked in their memory. Oh, this is how he did it before. And the thing was people that people that listened and the full gospel businessmen and the thousands of people that came, they saw now here a little servant of God speaking to a person telling them the secrets of their heart. He did that before. &gt;&gt; It wasn't somebody with a seventh grade education from Kentucky. It was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ speaking through a yielded vessel and telling them it was a an ordinary man that we call brother William Brandham. But it was that's why he could say that's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Who knows us? That's the one that's going with you. &gt;&gt; That's the one I'm stressing this morning. That's the one I want you to have your attention on today. And he laid hold. He held back. And it says their eyes were holding that they shouldn't know him. But they were speaking all the things. And listen friends, it's not enough to speak about our individual difficulties and filling our our time and our mind with someone. Oh. Oh my. Uh I'm going to be a wee bit rep reproving now. I have such a dear friend and they're not walking with me and they've turned and they've turned this message down, etc. Don't don't consider me wrong, but I say, "So what? &gt;&gt; Is that going to affect you? Is that going to afflict me?" Well, I was so attached to them. Oh, how were you attached? Emotionally attached. &gt;&gt; But be attached to the scripture. And the scripture says, "No man can pluck them out of my hand." &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I want you to respond to this, "All that the Father has given me will come." &gt;&gt; And no man can pluck them out of my hand. &gt;&gt; No man, no woman, no job, no success, nothing can pluck them out of my hand. I say glory to God. I want to walk with that kind of person. &gt;&gt; I want to go. I want to see you walk out of this place today associated with him &gt;&gt; and saying to him, "Oh Lord Jesus, you're so wonderful. Sometimes I feel weak, but I know that nobody can pluck me out of your hand." &gt;&gt; How wonderful that is. What a what a start to 2016. I face this year with courage. I know that nobody can pluck me out of his hand. &gt;&gt; I face this year with courage because I know he's going to stay right with me till my and he'll open the scriptures &gt;&gt; and he'll open my eyes and he'll open my understanding and he won't leave me till the appointed moment. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Lord, &gt;&gt; they told them all of the accounts and I never saw this. Never meant so much to me as it did today. When Jesus had to say and I I listened to the last services, when you listen to those last four services, you almost see this bleeding heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Jesus said, "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe here they've related all the things of how this one we had looked upon him and we had expected him and we expected so much out of this message. We expected so much out of what you taught us and here we are and uh the secretary of the church the trustee the secretary whatever he's committed suicide tried to do betray he betrayed you for 30 pieces of silver and and our leader gone he'd been crucified with a couple of thieves and is is has Israel come to a halt no they're just going on. And now we have another messenger. And he says, "They'll just keep coming on. They'll you'll just keep going to church and they'll just keep coming down and believing that they're getting saved after the church is gone. &gt;&gt; Don't think it's going to be so startling that all the graves are going to be opened and the dirt's going to be flying out of that's not the case. &gt;&gt; That's a dream world that the religion has put upon us. That's not the case. &gt;&gt; Said it'll be h it'll they'll slip away. They'll be gone. They'll be taken. He's talking about the rapture. &gt;&gt; And he slipped away and he came back in another dimension. &gt;&gt; Said, "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken." Then he says these words, "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory never meant so much to me, brother Tom, as this morning." It was as though I was being impressed with that same heaviness. You speak it, &gt;&gt; you preach it, the Holy Spirit makes it so clear. The scriptures are being opened. But now I want to speak right to you. When he opened the scriptures, they said later, "Didn't our hearts burn &gt;&gt; within us &gt;&gt; when he talked to us in the way?" &gt;&gt; So their hearts were burning, but it wasn't enough. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I'm giving some instruction. It's not enough to come to church and have your heart burn &gt;&gt; you've got to pursue it and continue on the journey with him &gt;&gt; and talking to him &gt;&gt; about the thing that's really on your heart. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, stay with me. &gt;&gt; Stay with me till my eyes are opened. &gt;&gt; Stay with me till I see who you are. Stay with me until my mind &gt;&gt; is open. &gt;&gt; I'm human. I know tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; We have to do that, do we? &gt;&gt; Is it all that important? might be better just to tone down a wee bit and start this year and say, "Well, I'll do what I need to do. I'll do and keep life together. I'll do I I know how some of you give yourself to your studies and higher education, and I'm not against that." Be very clear. I'm not against that. Get all education, earn all you can, give all you can. But I would not say get education at the expense of learning these things. &gt;&gt; Education will long be gone when this will still remain. &gt;&gt; This one is walking with the two on the way to Emmas. And I'm here to say to you very clearly, he may not be going, you may not be going to Emmas, but he's going to go where you're going to go. &gt;&gt; Don't just you got to stay with me now. &gt;&gt; Because I have some words that are very, very important. [sighs] says, "And two that same day were going to Emmas, and he went with them." &gt;&gt; He knew who had been chosen. &gt;&gt; He knows who he's called. &gt;&gt; He knows what has brought you here to this service. And sometimes it might just be an invite. Sometimes it might be as far as the natural is concerned it's kind of an accident that he doesn't operate by accidents. He operates by program. He operates by a plan that is in the mind of God. I have you here because I'm going to go with you and I'm going to stay with you and I'm going to open up the scriptures to you. I'm going to bring them back to your remembrance by the Holy Spirit. You're going to think upon these things. You're going to be may be troubled about these things, but I'll make those scriptures real until you see it's me. It is none other than the living, revealed Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Once again, &gt;&gt; and furthermore, I'll stay with you beyond that. &gt;&gt; I know your heart's burning. &gt;&gt; I know your heart's burning. And that's not enough. I'm going to stay with you. Your heart will still continue to burn and your eyes will be open. You'll see things that your neighbors don't see and your family doesn't see. You'll see things that's going to anchor you and hold you. And beyond that, then I'll open up your mind &gt;&gt; and your understanding. And for sure, people will think you're crazy. &gt;&gt; For sure. They'll think you went over the edge. And you did. Amen. &gt;&gt; Their hearts were burning. Not everyone's was burning. &gt;&gt; Their hearts were burning. &gt;&gt; That's where you have to settle it. I don't know about him or her or them or whatever more. I do know one thing. I know what's going on here. &gt;&gt; And I'm giving myself to that. What is going on here is eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have met eternal life. &gt;&gt; I have met the Lord Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you, this will be new to you. Some of you, you've heard it before. In in May, in the end of March this year is Easter and they have the meetings in Switzerland. And some of you know about people have gone from Switzerland. Brother Spencer's gone to Switzerland. Brother Craig Bur has gone to Switzerland. But you know how that started? I was sitting at my chair at my computer. You get emails. I get emails. So I got an email. There's a sister here that was in one of those meetings. Where's the sister? It's your You're in Victoria now. You right here. Why don't you just stand here? This sister came to one of the meetings. What year was that in Switzerland? What year? Could you say louder? Okay. I think we had we I think we had been about three years and she heard about the meetings was going to university in Nice France. Thank you. And came to the meeting and I met her and I thought what a what a lovely young lady. So full of life and so vibrant and so excited about what God was doing. But you know how it happened? This is this is just how supernatural it is. You're just in your daytoday thing. You're just doing your work. So I just slid up my chair to my computer and turn the computer on and opened up my emails and there was one there. So I clicked on it and it's about that long. I don't I don't know who it's from. And it just says, uh, uh, I streamed the meeting and I really enjoyed I enjoyed the service. That's how far I got. Now listen, friends, I'm not a liar. I'm going to tell you exactly what happened. I heard a voice. I heard a voice inside. Not with these ears, inside. But these are the exact words. This is a wounded one and her husband doesn't know she's written this. Isn't that specific? This is a wounded one and her husband doesn't know she's written this. And then maybe two weeks, three weeks, I got another one. Then another two, three weeks, I got another one. Maybe got over three, four months, I got a few. And then one day I opened up the computer. same thing. I just opened it up and there was quite a long all text. I thought, "Woo, this is a this is a long text, a lot of material." And I just started to read and the same voice, you think he doesn't know exactly whatever atmosphere they were in came into my study &gt;&gt; and surrounded me. And I got a heaviness from reading. This is a wounded one. I felt the wound. I felt I felt the darkness. I felt the heaviness. And now I'm reading this one. I read read about two lines and and the same voice, the same atmosphere says, "Now her husband knows." &gt;&gt; Isn't that specific? &gt;&gt; Hey, listen friends. I'm just Brother Ed just up here talking to you. That's why I said I wasn't going to preach. I'm just talking to you. I'm telling you as a live witness. That's just how real this one who walked with the two on the way to Emmas. I wasn't walking to Emmas. I was just going into my study and sitting down at the computer, which I do every day. And and and who was there? Who talked? Who said those words? I don't know where it came from, but I know it was him. &gt;&gt; And went there and I said, "Don't tell anybody I'm here. I just come here to see you. I wanted to see. I never seen these people. Never laid eyes on them before. And you're just doing living every day. And now last year was 400 people that came. They come from Africa. They come from the UK. They came from Romania. They came from Croatia. They do. You know why? People are thirsty. &gt;&gt; People are thirsty for reality. &gt;&gt; They don't want more religion. They want something real. &gt;&gt; They want to be introduced to this Christ. &gt;&gt; They want to walk with him. &gt;&gt; They want to be told you have somebody beside you that you may not be aware of. &gt;&gt; And I'm announcing that to you today. When you go out those doors, it's not going to be the same as you came in because you heard a message this morning. You heard an account from the scripture. You've heard a a messenger came in this time and he came and his life was so ordained that he said certain things at certain times. And he started warning the people and telling them, you know, because they were puzzled. It's no different than the two on the way to Emmas. They came to a a Christian businessman's convention, but they heard the same Lord Jesus telling them, "I know where you're at." &gt;&gt; And he's with the Full Gospel Businessman's Convention when he's talking about leadership, his last service. And he said, "When you were your mother, your old mother probably took your hand and took the first step with you. and her hands are laying silent today in a grave somewhere. And then she handed you off to the school teacher and the school teacher handed you off to your father and he taught you about business. He's talking about businessmen. You became a businessman. you became a successful businessman. And he and the Bible says that when the young man came to Jesus, he said, "What must I do to have eternal life?" And he was talking to eternal life. &gt;&gt; He was talking to the possessor. Do you hear me? The possessor of eternal life. Ask him, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?" Have you ever asked that? What must I do to have eternal life? It's nothing to get in the car and start the car up and drive to Cloverdale. By the way, it's more than that. &gt;&gt; It's more than hearing an exciting service. It's more than having being pricricked in your heart and having your heart burned. I am telling you, if it's my last service here, I would tell you it's more than that. &gt;&gt; It's not enough to have a burning heart, &gt;&gt; but you have to stay with him. He will. I'm announcing to you, he'll stay with you. I want you to be aware of who it is that's beside you. Who it is that's walking and driving with you. He knows where your address is. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was just used of God to let people know &gt;&gt; where they were, &gt;&gt; who it was that was beside them. Listen to me. I'm talking now as a elder that has been away a long time. When I first went to Switzerland, I thought of the message conference with God. Conference with God. Brother Brandham says when there's a conference, I when there's a crisis in the world, they call a conference. And then men leave their families and leave all their business and leave everything and they go to to where the people are aside from everyone and they have left all their troubles at home and they come to a place maybe a very pretty place like perhaps Geneva and I said I'm in Geneva. I didn't come here to preach a sermon to you people. I came here to tell you because I knew what God spoke to me in my study. I said, "You people are in a crisis &gt;&gt; and you need a conference with God." And I knew also we're under an anointing of this word of God. This word is the word is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're not out of some seminary or got something cooked up out of a book &gt;&gt; or out of our own mind that won't do it. It has to be by the Holy Spirit. Something come down and the man of God surrender himself to the voice of God and speak to the people. &gt;&gt; So I said, "You're in a crisis." They sat about 120 quiet and I said, "And he's called you for a conference." And in that service, Brother Brandham starts talking. Now, here's a man who has healing healing meetings. Hundreds of thousands of people come to healing meetings. But he says to the doctors, such a fine man. And he says, "And they labor, they study, and they labor to make life easier for the people. And the doctor will take his patient and deal with that patient and [clears throat] do everything he can to make life easier." and he talks and he speaks so nice and then he goes on starts to preach maybe for an hour and a half. Are you listening sir? &gt;&gt; And when he's done they call a prayer line and the first person I happen to know something about the minister and the first person that stands there he's just quiet and brother Brandham's first words are you believe doctor don't you? What are you going to do with that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? Well, there's another accident. Are we just going from accident to accident? Or is this a plan? Is this a program? &gt;&gt; Is this something that God is doing to catch our attention? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm just a simple man, but he caught my attention. Brother Jean Manasse, you asked me, "When did I see Malachi 4?" He just told he talked about John in Malachi 4 before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And I was in such a state I was like the two men on the way to Emmas. I said, "This thing, where's this great sweep? Where's this great revival? Where are all these great things happening? It's all going downhill. I said, "Where is it all?" When he talked about Malachi 4, I said, "Of course. Of course." And that was the only ministry that fit it. &gt;&gt; Friends, all I can tell you is that he came to me. &gt;&gt; We sing that song, He came to me. And when you sing it next time and perhaps we'll sing it at the end of this service. I want you to say within your heart, repeat his words. He came to me &gt;&gt; and he's not going to leave me &gt;&gt; until what I have heard is quickened. Until my heart burned when I was in that service listening to that man preaching. I'm not interested in trying to convince a whole congregation. I know that maybe it's one, maybe it's two, maybe it's more that your heart is going to burn. And I'm going to instruct you now when you leave this place, you say, "Oh, spirit of God, you caused my heart to burn. I don't understand much of what was said. I don't understand a lot of the things, but do stay with me. Stay with me till my eyes are opened. Stay with me till I know you. Stay with me till my understanding is open. &gt;&gt; I need my understanding open. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of folks that remembered Christmas. It came upon a midnight clear. They sing about the angels and they sing about the manger and they sing about all of these things. But the Christ of that manger haven't met him. Do I have a little more time? I'm not going to keep you very long because I know this is a heavy duty message. I know that I speak to perhaps most of the people here when I say there's an area of your life that perhaps is troubled about something. Everybody has a burden. Everybody has a concern. I wonder how many people would like to raise their hands and say, "I I do I have a burden." Maybe it's a personal burden. Maybe it's a family burden. But I have a burden. I'm thinking about all across I have both hands up. I have a burden. I was blessed yesterday when I saw a word and the prophet Isaiah spoke it and he said with stammering lips and when tongues stammering lips and with tongues, how does that say that? Stammering lips and with stammering tongues. He said and in the time of refreshment and I I I wanted to find out as more than refreshments as we sorry you know have some refreshments but the refreshment is actually the peace. &gt;&gt; I said amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to the congregation this morning and say here is the peace. [applause] This message brings you the peace. &gt;&gt; If you believe every word of it, it will bring you peace. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be distressed about this and the other thing that happens in life because the one who's walking with you, he didn't live in Emmas, but he was going to Emmas. He may not live in Bellingham or in Blaine or in Suriri, but he's going wherever you're going. And he's the refreshment. &gt;&gt; He's the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; He's the peace. &gt;&gt; He's the revealed word. And he already has sent a messenger to reveal that word. And I can tell you, we are in the season of the revelation of the word. I say to this congregation, in the name of the Lord God Almighty, turn the corner. &gt;&gt; Don't stay on. You can stay on in your religion or this religion. You can stay on forever. We're not going to build a wall 2016. We're not going to continue building a wall. We're going to inform the people of the corner. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus went with them to inform them, to conduct them around the corner. And uh I'm saying something to you. It's not just a curve. It's a sharp one. It's a sharp curve. &gt;&gt; A corner is a corner. He said it takes a real master Mason, there's nobody, no human that could turn that corner. I can tell you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who directed this word, this message to even come in the fashion that it came for certain things to be introduced. He started to introduce in in uh in in about 12 months before his lips were sealed that there are corner and I need a mason to build a corner. You can go on in a straight wall. You can go to a seminary and say the same thing and build a tradition around anything and and talk about the godhead or whatever more. But when you turn the corner then you get some specifics. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a blueprint that comes out. You got to turn a corner. And we have turned a corner. &gt;&gt; And he says, "We're at the corner in the rapture." And we're in the 50th year Jubilee from that time. And I will tell you, in the name of Jesus Christ, the corner's been turned. And he's here now presently to conduct us around the corner in our faith and in our belief that we can say, "Oh Lord, I've heard things." I only want to get one thing across to you today. If you hear something and the Holy Spirit I can't do it, but if the Holy Spirit comes down and causes a burning inside your heart, a burning that you can't explain, then be it known to you, that burning didn't come from me. That burning didn't come from these brothers. That burning didn't come from the song leader. That burden came, that burning came from the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And that is the one that is with you. &gt;&gt; And that is the one that will not leave you. &gt;&gt; I want you to to turn your attention to him. And when you leave this building, you say, "Oh Jesus, you that caused this burning, stay with me. &gt;&gt; Stay with me. &gt;&gt; Stay near me. Keep talking to me &gt;&gt; until my eyes are opened &gt;&gt; and I come to a whole new level of seeing you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And stay with me. Continue on. Pray Brother Ed's prayer. Stay with me till my understanding is expanded. until I know what it is that you said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you trust just this little brain, don't forget it's just a teaspoon of ashes. &gt;&gt; It'll never figure out the way for you. But trust him. &gt;&gt; Trust him. &gt;&gt; And he'll do two things. Number one, he'll stay with you. &gt;&gt; Number one, he'll go with you to your place of residence. He will stay. He knows all about your problem. He knows all about the heaviness. He knows all about those things. And he knows what you still need to know. &gt;&gt; And he'll conduct you around this curve &gt;&gt; from mortal. I trust that 2016 is when we can be conducted in a rapture from mortal season to immortal. Won't that be wonderful? &gt;&gt; I'll ask brother Ryan to come and I want to sing. He came to me, but let's bow our heads, please. Heavenly Father, I sense it would be a strange time. Perhaps a strange meeting. This is the first of this year and we know that you are timeless. You're not conscious and you're not restricted to our time and our our watches and yet you have set everything in motion. All the galaxies and the planets and you are conscious of the things that have taken place. And I believe that Jesus Christ was born exactly when he should be born. [music] He lived his life. He was guided by all things that the father showed him. [music] And he guided his life. And at the end of his life, he begins to speak very differently. He begins to speak his third pull. And the prophet refers to it so much [music] in the when souls were in prison. When they thought you were on the cross or maybe in the tomb, you preached to the souls that were in prison to verify and confirm Noah's message was true. Abraham's message was true. The apostles and the disciples or rather the prophets of the Old Testament, their message was true. and you came that living Christ all down through and confirmed that it was true and you emptied out paradise. And Lord, we're facing something like that. We're facing something like that now. Oh God, when the walking that are walking on the face of the earth, we know not about who is who is yours and who is not yours, but we know one thing. We must know within ourselves, you have called me and I'm on the way to Emmas. I may not be on the way to Emmas, but today perhaps I need to go to West Vancouver or North Vancouver or Burnaby or Surrey or Langley or Abbottzford or Lynen or Bellingham or Blaine or Tacoma, Seattle. Lord [music] Jesus, let this be known that you shall be there. &gt;&gt; You are here presently and you will not leave them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will stay with them. Open our eyes and open our understanding in the name of Jesus Christ. I wonder who needs to [music] be prayed for. And you want to simply stand where you are. Or you may want to come and [music] stand here and join with me. Oh God. &gt;&gt; And he went with them. &gt;&gt; The people need you. &gt;&gt; I know [music] they need you. &gt;&gt; Conduct us around this curve, Lord. &gt;&gt; Conduct us around this corner. Oh God, this incredible corner from life, from this mortal life to the immortal. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray for everyone who has the same hunger, the same craving, I pray, Father, that you will visit them now. Come to them now in our own personal way. Speak, Lord. speak for you are a God that speaks. &gt;&gt; You are also a God that hears, so we will speak. &gt;&gt; We will pray and you shall hear. &gt;&gt; You will answer for you love to answer. You love to do things for your children. Oh God, let this not be just another service when people just pray or when they would come forward or stand or whatever, but may it be indeed indeed indelible indelibly marked upon their mind. [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus, you are alive. &gt;&gt; You are present. &gt;&gt; We believe in the message that you sent through your messenger. &gt;&gt; We believe the order of the word was perfect. We believe that the rapture message means more than just a message. There's a great time, oh God. We are awaiting it. We are your children. We are awaiting this moment. We've been anticipating it. We're not interested in just having church. We're not interested in just having a school or a camp. We want to go home. Oh God, we desire to go home. We desire to go home. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord Jesus. [music] How lovely you are. I wonder, brother Ryan, if we would sing and the [music] people we can sing together, he came to me. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When I could not [music and singing] come to where he was, he came to [music] me. That's why he died. [singing and music] That's why he died on [music] [singing] [music] where he was. He [singing] came to [music] me. You've had your hearts burning now. He came. [music] &gt;&gt; That's why he come. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; He sees that deep thing in your heart. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. [music] &gt;&gt; He sees a heavy heart. &gt;&gt; He sees the questions. [music] &gt;&gt; You glad he came to me. To me. &gt;&gt; That's why he &gt;&gt; That's why he died on Calary. Calvary. That's why he died. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; He came to [music] me. &gt;&gt; Let him hear your voice in just a moment, but I want to ask. I don't know among you where he came to you, [music] but this word came to me as I sat on a log. Not very not very a glorious or glamorous thing. I'm in my old work clothes. [music] I'm just sitting on a log. But he came to me. I poured out my heart. How is it all this um [music] this anointing and this this preaching and this thing that I see, how is it that it's failing and people aren't able to live the life? Let me tell you friends, I have with all the strength that's in me. There's a strength in this word. You can live that life. You just surrender yourself to him. Call upon him even now. He'll come to you. Maybe this is your turn. Maybe this is your time. Perhaps you heard something and say, "Lord, the burning is taking place. [music] Come to this burning soul. Oh Lord Jesus, make yourself known." Now that I might say, "I see him. I see him." [music] Once again, &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to me. [music and singing] When I could not come to where he was, [singing and music] he came to me. And that's why [music] he died. [singing] Just pray and ask him. [music and singing] [music and singing] to where he was he to come to my soul. Precious Jesus, [music] come [singing] [music] to my soul. Precious Jesus, my Lord, [singing and music] hear me. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; mountain [singing] [music] me. [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Pray like you never prayed before. [music] Oh, come to my [singing] soul. Precious Jesus, my Lord, my Lord. [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; He's listening. [singing] [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Pass me on a gentle savior. He won't pass you by. He's going to walk right with you. Roy, [music] this is reality. How many believes that it's a reality? [music] Pass me now. Oh, gentle savior. Listen, some of you that may not, you just have a burning in your heart. Say, I I've been so touched. There's more for you just now. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; call and he said he will answer [music] me not [music] to say [singing and music] my Heat. Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [singing] All [music] are [music] not seeior. [singing] [music] [singing] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Is this [music] in your heart [singing] [music] now? [singing] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing and chant] &gt;&gt; of all my [music] shame. [singing] [music] [singing] Oh God, [music] [singing] we have nobody. [music] [singing] [music] [music] [singing] Oh, [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] holy, holy. for you. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Blessed [music] Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm so privileged to call your name. &gt;&gt; His name shall be called Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; For he shall save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; There's a group of people here today, Lord. this audience of people. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; They've come to this church service to hear something of you. And Lord Jesus, I seek to lift you up. You're the one that's directing us. Here we are at this great time of the ending of the Gentile dispensation. [music] You have sent such a word. Oh God, we will not miss it. We will not miss it. We've embraced it. We love it, oh God. And we pray that you'll open to us the scriptures. Open to us the scriptures. There may be some, Lord, that have not had it opened. I say on behalf of those to whom it's not been opened, you [music] pray with me now as I say, may the scriptures be open to them by the Holy Ghost. Open the scriptures. Speak out of the scriptures. And then father stay with us till we come to our place to our home. We love you. You're the king of our house, king of our life. Oh God, come in. Eat with us. Be in our place. Be at our table. Be in our conversation. Oh God, stay with us till our eyes are open. Oh God. And not only our eyes open, stay with us, Lord. before you leave. Stay with us, oh God. And your word says, "And you blessed them and departed from them." Stay with us, Lord. Open our understanding. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. For everyone that is standing here, [music] for everyone in the audience, in the name of Jesus Christ, grip Cloverdale Bible Way with a mighty sweep of the Holy Spirit. Oh God, I pray in your name. [music] This year will be a transformation year, &gt;&gt; a changing year. &gt;&gt; Let it be a rapture year. This is my desire. Let us go, God, to our eternal home. How? We do not know. And just when we do not know, but we say we're ready. We're ready. We're ready. Let everyone say we're ready. We're ready to go. Thank you, Father. In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. And with that, we'll be dismissed. [music] Oh, how I love Jesus. Everyone, show your love to him. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] how [music] [singing] [music] I love Jesus. He [music and singing] [music] and [singing] how I love. [music] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You paid the supreme price. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus. [music and singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; coming. &gt;&gt; My final words here to this waiting people. If you haven't sensed him, [music] here's my instruction. When you leave here, you continue to talk about him and you ask him, "Come [music] to me, Lord. You see exactly where I'm at. I haven't really felt anything. I didn't sense anything, but I know that [music] you're true. I believe in it. I believe in you. And he'll come come to me. [music] And then stay with me in Jesus name. God bless you all. You're [music] dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. And we want to have a truly happy year. I want to meet you on the [music] other side. and I'll say happy eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're [music] dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you all. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; God's [music] way [music] of &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Say with me [music] [music] [music] Jesus. I just pray the rightus [music] to walk. We believe in the same [music] world. [music] [music] I will [music] stay in Jesus blood.
