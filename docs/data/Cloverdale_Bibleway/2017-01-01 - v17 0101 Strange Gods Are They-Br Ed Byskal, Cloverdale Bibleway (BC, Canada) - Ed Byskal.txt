========================================
[Music] to the lamb with all my strength with all I am. I will seek to honor his command. I pledge to I al let's just blend our voices now. I pledge alce to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Word of God speak. Word of God ever true. Hallelujah. What a wonderful way to start 2017. Pledge your allegiance to the lamb of God. We used to do that in schools. You know, we used to pledge our allegiance to the United States of America and down in the US. And you say that pledge every morning. It instills something within the citizens of the country of the United States. You grow up, you're proud of your nation. Well, I don't know if they actually do that in every school across the nation anymore. And it shows in the lives of the people where their allegiance is. They're scattered. They don't really have a they don't really have anything firm down inside them hold them. But we do. &gt;&gt; We pledge allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ. Not just today and not just tomorrow, but we've given him our lives. He gave his life that we might live. And we're proud to stand and we're proud to say that our allegiance is to the Lord Jesus. Happy New Year. Thank you for being here today. We're looking forward to hearing our pastor speak this morning. So, we're just going to sing a couple of songs. Why don't we stand this morning? We'll have prayer and have the deacons come and take the offering. We just want to dedicate the day to the Lord Jesus. Is this the Yeah, the one on the screen. Can you put that up? Holy words long preserved for our in this world. We resound with God's heart. Oh, let the word of God be [Music] words of life. There words of hope. Give us strength. Help us all. In this world where we are, the word of God will guide us. Word of God. Word of God ever truth changing me, changing you with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. &gt;&gt; Holy words of our faith. Holy words are great handed down. Oh the sacrifice to us. Oh ye the faithful word of Christ. Holy words long reserve for our in this world with God's heart. Oh, and the word of God in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're changing. changing. Oh, we have come with all the word of God. Word of God. Word of God. [Music] Changing me. Changing you. Lord, we have come all the word of God. [Music] Amen. Ask brother Tim Dodd. Brother Tim, if you'd come just have a quick testimony and one prayer request to read before the church. Sister Faith How wants to ask for a prayer for a c-orker who's asked for prayer for wisdom raising her two children. Sister Heidi Neighbor wants to thank all the saints for their prayers for me. I could feel your support. After months of pain, I am now pain-free. Our Lord is a wondrous healer. I give him all the praise and thanks. Amen. God bless you this morning, Sister Heidi. Amen. Good to see you here, Brother Tim. Amen. We're so thankful for that testimony this morning. &gt;&gt; Isn't our Lord wonderful? &gt;&gt; He's just as wonderful and more so in 2017 &gt;&gt; than he was in 2016. We bow our heads together. How many would say, "Lord, make 2017 a year that this burden on my heart gets answered. Lord, I have something that I desire this morning." Maybe you have a need physical. Maybe you just have something in your life that you just like to say, "Lord, this year, this I'm patient. Lord, Sister Heidi was patient and you came on the scene and you delivered her. And Lord, you're able to deliver, to touch, to bless each and everyone. Heavenly Father, Lord, we bow in your presence this morning, the beginning of a year. Oh God, we ended the year last night rejoicing, giving you praise and glory and honor for all the great things that you have done for us. And Lord, the end of the year brings that kind of a memory, oh Lord. Memories of victories, memory of battles that were won, memory, Lord, of how you came on the scene when we needed you. And we may not know what this coming year does hold, but we know that you hold the future. We know, Father, that we can cast our cares upon you because you care for us. And Lord, we lay all of our burdens down this morning. You see the hands that are raised, Lord, everyone. The needs that are in this sanctuary may be out on the internet. There might be some streaming that say, "Lord, I have need of you. Lord, you're no different today than you were yesterday, and you will be the same tomorrow. And so, Lord, may you come on the scene, granting each and every request. May this be a special day. May this be a special service that starts out the year, oh God, and sets the trajectory right, oh Lord, as our pastor brings a word. May you anoint him with a special uncction for the church. Lord, may you inspire him with things perhaps even has not he has not put into his notes, but Lord, you want to say something to your people. Here we are so far into the 2000s, 17 years. It's amazing, Lord, that we've looked for the marriage supper of the lamb. It may be just around the corner. And Lord, we want you to prepare us for that, oh God. We remember these needs, oh Lord, a coworker of a sister, Lord, that desires prayer this morning. Lord, may you come to her. You are wisdom, oh God. You are what she has need of, oh God. May she surrender herself to you and yield her life to the leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ. We remember Sister Leverne this morning also, Lord, who's not with us. Lord, she's had an operation. And Lord, we pray that you'll quickly strengthen her. Lord, you'll take away the pain. And Lord, you'll deliver her as you did our sister Heidi. And Lord, we commit all to you. Bless this service. Lord, we pray. We take up the first offering of the year. Lord, as it goes forth into the new year, may the needs be met. Lord, you don't work by money, but you're able to take these offerings and multiply them for the use in the kingdom of God. May you supernaturally work in our midst in this year like never before. Lord, we commit all things to you in this service to you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Amen. The deacons take up the offering. Appreciate our deacons this morning. Thank you, brother Martin. God bless you. We have uh one announcement here. Brother EA, you're going to be singing this morning. Is Brother EA here? Was he able to make it? You are. No, I don't see him. All right. Okay, Brother Wes, you got upgraded first class. You're going to have to sing twice. Yeah, I know. It's terrible, isn't it? I have a microphone and he doesn't. So, we're going to let you sing first and then we're going to have your sister and your brother sing with you just after that. That'd be all right. I'll let you pick the order then. Okay, good. I love Brother Wes. Many of you may not know, but uh Brother Wes and I just connected when I I first got saved. And uh I I told him I said I feel like because he moved to Atlanta shortly after I I got saved and I said uh I said I feel like I got robbed in broad daylight. I just show up here and you're gone. I couldn't believe it. But uh so when he's back I like to let him know how much I appreciate him and uh we'll pull on the gift that God has placed within him. Amen. Because I do believe that that's the way that it is. So, I have an announcement here for young people's service this Friday, January the 6th, for all young people ages 13 and up. It will be at 7:30. So, that's January the 6th. Um, believe the weather is supposed to be pretty nice, a little bit chilly, but uh shouldn't be any weather delays for this young people's service. So, I don't think we have any more announcements that I can think of. Okay, brother Wes. Matt, if you want to come and sing with Hannah or not with Hannah, I'm sorry. Your sister Leah, you want to sing after after brother Wes sings one? All right. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Well, it's good to be home. Like I said, uh last Sunday, we just appreciate seeing each and every one of you and we just love you so much again. Uh happy new year to you. And uh this is a song that I remember listening to many, many times when the Lord touched my heart and changed my life. Um it was it's called A Place called Grace and I haven't sung it in a long time but um just just pray for me and I trust it'll be a blessing to you. Amen. [Music] For so many years I've heard it told the story of compassion. The prodal son who left the fold [Music] and felt no satisfaction on my knees. Lord, I cried out to you. I'm so alone. But if there's room in your house for one more, Lord, I'm ready to come back home. I know there is a place where arms of compassion welcome me home so mercy falls like rain and I know there's a [Applause] Call grace. [Music] For so many days I've trusted grace. Yet I had to wonder [Music] how many times my human strength has kept me from surrender. Oh the more I learn just to lean on the cross. Oh, the more that I see that when I fall, I will fall to the place where his mercy reaches me. Oh, reaches me. And I know there is a place your arms of compassion they welcome me home. Sweet mercy falls like grave. And I know there's a place [Applause] called grace. And when it seems like my courage is strong, there's just one one reason. is the rock that my faith is built on. He holds me in his arms and he gives me strength to carry on. And I know there is a place where arms of compassion they welcome me home. Sweet mercy falls like rain. And I know there's a place. Yes, I know. I know there's a place. Oh, aren't you glad? You know, I know there's a place called grace. [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's easy to walk in the footprints of another who has walked here before. But when those footprints disappear and my future seems unclear, my only hope is in a still small voice. Follow me when the footprints you followed are gone. Follow me. When friends leave you standing alone, don't be afraid. I won't lead you on. The Savior has spoken. Follow me. [Music] Oh my friend, are you troubled with nowhere to turn? Have you lost your way in the night? Well, there's one who is watching and he knows where you are. He wants to lead you into the light. &gt;&gt; Follow me when the foot still follow God. Follow me. When friends leave you standing alone, don't be afraid. I won't leave you around. The Savior has spoken. Follow me. Follow me. When the footprints you followed are gone, follow me. When friends leave standing alone, don't be afraid. I won't leave you alone. The Savior has spoken. Follow me. [Music] Don't be afraid. I won't leave you. [Music] The Savior has spoken. Follow me. [Music] Amen. Amen. We appreciate that. Brother Wes, Brother Matthew, Sister Leah. Why don't we turn the service to our pastor this morning? That'd be all right. Amen. Let's sing together. Blessed assurance. Jesus is mine. This is my story. This is my song. We'll invite brother Ed to come this morning. &gt;&gt; Blessed assure Jesus is mine. Oh, what a taste of glory. The near of salvation, purchase of God, Lord of his spirit, washed in his blood. This is my song. This is my song. [Music] Praising my savior all the day long. This is my soul. This is my song.

Whispers of love. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. [Music] This is my story. This is my song. [Music] Praising my singior. Let's sing the chorus again as brother Ed comes. Oh, this is my story. This is my song. [Applause] Praising myior all. [Music] This is my song. This is my song. This is myior. [Music] wonderful evening last night. &gt;&gt; We want to say not only a happy new year to you, but it's uh it's already a wonderful year. It was wonderful evening last night. &gt;&gt; I want to thank everybody for participating in the different groups that sang God bless you. &gt;&gt; It was just wonderful. took me back uh to listening to some of the singing in uh in different countries and it was just wonderful to hear the uh group from Philippines, from Africa, different places, just wonderful &gt;&gt; and I got thinking in the scripture it says uh every tongue. &gt;&gt; So there's different tongues, every tongue, every tribe, every nation, every kingdom. Hallelujah. What a time. What a time of rejoicing. We're going to have a ordination just now and we're going to ask brother Peter Ivano if he will please come and stand here at the front. We want to have prayer and we want to make some comments as well. If you'd come, brother Peter. God bless you. Sister Yolena is with you. Do you have your children as well? You do. All right. &gt;&gt; Maybe Sister Elena, if you could come. Do you have the boys? The boys are twins. Two of them. I want to read some scripture and brother brother Peter has been uh taking the responsibility in Seattle in Reton and I want to say a little bit about Seattle and the Reton area. Uh, I really believe that it it justifies a real lighthouse. I believe it should be. How many the congregation agree that with me? &gt;&gt; I really believe it does. We have labored there many many years before the present work was there. And uh even in the days of the radio when we had the radio broadcast the Philadelphia Bible school down there, we went down to show the 20th century prophet film. And um also they asked for a library of brother Brandham's books and I don't know was the red volumes or what it was. So we took that the the attitude that I personally have always had and the people I believe have had is that whatever door God opens that's the door to go through. Person wants books here's the books. Man needs a Bible here's a Bible. Need a song book here's a song book. Anything that can contribute to their spiritual life. I need it in another language. We'll find a translator, do what we can. And I think that that really needs to be the needs to be the uh spirit of the work there. The work in Reton must not be just looked on as a gathering place. We just gather here to, you know, to worship and hear a preacher. That's that's really not it. This is to be a lighthouse. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is to be a lighthouse to get the message out to the people and that's the message that God loves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the true saying. Uh this 1 Timothy 3 and 1. If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work. A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, and apt to teach. Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy, a filthy luer, but patient, not a brawler, not covetous. One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity. For a man knoweth not how to rule, if a man For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must have a good report of them which are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Now the prophet of God has said in the message indictment now we do not believe that gifts come by laying on the hands and we are going to lay hands on you brother Peter the ministers here we believe that laying on of hands is a sanction of what we've already seen It's an amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what it really is. In the message influence, he said the office of a man in the church is anointed. Not appointed. It's anointed. He said the church, the pastor, the evangelist, the prophet, the apostle must be the anointed office of God, not elected by man. Man tried to elect that office one time. They cast lots for it. Poor ma Matias never did nothing. But God chose Paul and he did something because he was anointed. &gt;&gt; That's the key. Why are people so tossed about? The prophet said in part, "There's about three major things that usually brings a minister to his back to the rut." Back to the rut. I thought that was quite a phrase. And noticing them, one of them was money, women, or popularity. And this is the three major causes that I see in the Bible that caused men to fall. And I asked our heavenly father to please let me shun all these all at all times those things especially these three major things and had kept a covering over them. That was the prophet himself. He prayed concerning those things. in Revelation book of symbols he said uh he said to see visions in part now to see visions and they're wonderful and I thank God for it but yet the preaching of the word is a million miles beyond that when I see the lame walk when I see the lame walk or the blind see the preaching of the gospel and I I've pondered this and I believe The reason that he would even say or be directed to say such a thing is that when you have a vision, it's usually singular. Sees a vision of a man or a life or a home or whatever. But when the gospel is preached, who knows where it goes? It's a scattering the seed and and and if someone is saved, &gt;&gt; 10,000 worlds &gt;&gt; has come into the kingdom. And who knows where that's going to go. Or young young men like you have as sons to see lives like that uh cultivated and strengthened and brought up in the faith. How wonderful that is. And we saw families last night, young men, young women whose parents are here in the congregation. What a glory it is. What a strength it is. Perhaps not everyone has that uh has that privilege but nevertheless we have the privilege to have faith. &gt;&gt; And if you believe the prophet has said that when someone believes and doesn't doubt then God God who cannot lie when they raise in the resurrection has to answer to that faith. &gt;&gt; I think that's wonderful. Don't ask me where the quote is. I've been looking for it for a long time, but I know I read it. And then Romans has said, and we'll close with this just before we pray, how then shall they call on him in whom they have not heard or believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? So that's a wonderful, wonderful thing. And uh we uh want to encourage you, brother Peter, preach the word without fear or favor of man. Amen. I wonder if the brethren if you would all come and would you sing a verse of that song for us. Speak my lord. Speak my lord. When the coal of fire had touched the prophet, making him as pure as pure behind. &gt;&gt; When the voice of God said for us, then he answered, "Here I am. Send me. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be waiting to answer thee. Speak my own. Speak my own. Speak and I will answer. Lord send me. &gt;&gt; Father Tom, would you lead in prayer, please? [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh mighty God. &gt;&gt; Father, we lay our hands to say amen to the call of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Peter has desired, &gt;&gt; oh God, ordination. &gt;&gt; He's desired this Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscart, [Music] God say amen. A soul given &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit take hold of the gift &gt;&gt; of the world for every good gift. &gt;&gt; Cultivate oh God the gift from the father. &gt;&gt; May he give himself to the gift of God. &gt;&gt; May give himself to the ministry. &gt;&gt; Mighty God may see the purpose of the messenger and the message. &gt;&gt; Oh mighty God. May your thoughts be made known to him in the name of Jesus by the power of the word of God. Lord, we lay hands on him. But we pray that the love of God would descend and use and anoint the gifts of God within brother Peter. We're thankful for it when you call man Lord that you will bless our God. Lord as they join their lives and the whole dedication we renew this family we pray and the name of Jesus Christ would you take the vessel now this ordination would you anoint the glory of God we pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus Holy Spirit, use this vessel &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Use the vessel. Use the mouth. &gt;&gt; Vessel of peace. &gt;&gt; We pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You expect it to be different. God bless you, brother. God bless you, brother Peter. God bless your voice. God bless you. God bless. God bless you. God bless you. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me. [Music] Amen. I think we may have been disconnected here. &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles to uh Deuteronomy the 4th chapter. What words? Are we connected? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Good. We do this just to show we're not perfect. That should relax everybody. I'm going to have brother John come and read the scripture. And uh I want to read Deuteronomy the 4th chapter starting at verse 23. Then we'll read verse 25 and 25 down through to 31. And then I wish to read Matthew the first chapter starting with verse 18 down to 23. those scriptures. I'm going to give you a little capsule of of the thought I wish to approach and uh if you're visiting, I'll disregard that you're visiting and you can uh perhaps be benefited by what's being said. But I want to approach some very serious things, not within the church or within the congregation, but with within the uh bride body of Jesus Christ. And when I say that, I refer to whether it be Russia or Siberia or Europe or Africa. You might say, well, how do you know what's uh taking place over there? Well, we're pretty well connected and furthermore have have spent uh resources, energy, have spent many many days. Uh it might be a surprise to some of you, but we've spent probably close to two years in Africa. If we were to take we've made about 20 trips there, had radio broadcast in Swasi music radio. You might say, "Oh, that's in the past." No, no, it's right here and it's it's part of my life. &gt;&gt; And we've uh we spent a lot of energy and the and the words that were gone from there. Uh perhaps brother Tom may have selected some of the uh tape sections and then we put those over Swansea Music Radio which is 100,000 watt not FM but AM covering an area inhabited by 87 million people and it was there for several years. Uh we were on about 20 25 26 27 stations for as long as close to 9 years. That was every week. So there's been a lot of labors. &gt;&gt; And then you you see the the gathering of uh churches and people and and messages gone out. I've been in countries where people have the message now that did not have the message. And we're not talking we're not talking about statistics now. This is not a missions report. There's no such a thing as missions. They're bride uh in another country. &gt;&gt; That's all they are. And uh and that's a wonderful thing. And God came in the form of Jesus Christ uh who was God in the flesh. And I want to speak about uh uh I I want to speak something of that. But but the thing that's very very heavy on my heart is when I see Satan trying to tamper with uh the work of God &gt;&gt; and he's a he's a cunning he's a cunning worker. He's a cunning adversary. He's not our friend. &gt;&gt; He's an enemy. &gt;&gt; He's not God's friend. &gt;&gt; He's God's enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And whether whether we see it within the congregation or within the school or within some other country or within the bride as a as a whole, I uh I I you'll have to don't excuse me, but I get on the war path &gt;&gt; and and the weapon is the sword of the spirit. And so I want to convey to you so that uh you know in this day of technology we hear things and and it comes and it afflicts you whether you realize it or not. It maybe makes you downcast or makes you discouraged. I'm on the war path. &gt;&gt; I I He has no right to come in and discourage the saints of God. He has no place in your home and no place in your mind. &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh, brother John, could you come forward please and read those scriptures for me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 4 verse 23-2. Take heed unto yourselves, lest you forget the command covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image or the likeness of anything which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee. 25 when thou shalt beget children and children's children and ye shall have remain long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of anything and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God to provoke him to anger &gt;&gt; on down 26. I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land, where unto ye go over Jordan to possess it. Ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whether the Lord shall lead you. And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood, wood, and stone, which neither see nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. I I just want to stomp on that. We'll read that verse again. And my title is, "Strange gods are they." &gt;&gt; Amen. can a a a whole nation be delivered out of Egypt, out of the cruelty of Egypt? And then when they get into the land, &gt;&gt; and and you'll raise families and you'll have children and you'll you'll be enjoying the inheritance of the land. &gt;&gt; That that is this was the word of warning from Moses here. &gt;&gt; Yes. and uh lest you make these gods and and they were the work of men's hands. Now I'm going to take a quantum leap in the service to this present day which is the work of men's minds. &gt;&gt; Science has brought the the capability of of of men's minds. All they have to do it is with a mind uh uh a mind the strength of their minds or the smartness of their minds. But then brother Brandham says alo also one other thing. He said science &gt;&gt; uh what has science in store for you? &gt;&gt; And he stops. He asks a question. What has science got for you in store? More death. &gt;&gt; And I will say what has been produced by men's minds with the technology of this age is far more destructive. &gt;&gt; Far more. Satan has one ambition that is to bring death &gt;&gt; to the people and to bring havoc and play havoc amongst the saints of God. But I also have a clear distinct promise that uh that the bride of Jesus Christ is beyond his deceptive powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Carry on, brother John. &gt;&gt; Verse 28 again. And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear, nor eat nor smell. But if it from then thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If thou seek him with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shall be obedient unto his voice, for the Lord thy God is a merciful God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will not forsake thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither destroy thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swore unto them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if you'll read in Matthew 1 and Matthew 1 and8 Matthew 118 to 23. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." Now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us." &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to say, "God with us." &gt;&gt; God with us. the absolute with us, &gt;&gt; the object of worship with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. You may be seated. Thanks, brother John. Some have taken it upon themselves to discover and point out what they think are flaws within the message. I'm getting right down where the rubber hits the road. Who has the voice and the words? Who has the words to form an image like unto God? And the scripture says, "And she shall be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and shall bring forth a son, and that son will be virgin born." God is beginning a whole new creation. People may go thousands of years ago. I I'm not interested in time. I'm interested in what happened. &gt;&gt; And what happened was I Jesus was the beginning of the new creation of God. And that's why the blood that brought forth Jesus Christ was sufficient for the sacrifice and for the penalty of death. And it is it is our pardon. &gt;&gt; Just just hold on to these words. But who has the words? The scripture tells us clearly that Jesus uh Jesus himself even when the words of the prophets it says unto us a child is born a virgin shall conceive he he became that he had to believe that &gt;&gt; and not only did he believe that we have to believe that &gt;&gt; and we do believe that but how twisted the uh they they managed to man in his uh uh a man in his ignorance and in his blindness and Satan inspiring him has taken the blessed virgin Mary and and a lady elevated her to an immaculate uh birth and so on and so forth and replacing almost Christ as it was as it were and and Christ is the virgin born because he had to go to death. &gt;&gt; Mary didn't go to death. Mary didn't go to the cross. But there's a over a billion people that glamorize or glorify actually make her a goddess &gt;&gt; by changing the interpretation of the word of God. He shall he shall be the one. Right. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says he'll be called Emmanuel, which is God with us. &gt;&gt; Now, we have a privilege of having that God, &gt;&gt; the living God, &gt;&gt; the creator, &gt;&gt; the giver of every good gift, and the and the God that keeps his judgments as well as his promises. But I want to ask the question who has the voice and I'm just laying a very basic foundation here because uh in the in the message before the prophet left just before he left in the message I believe it is uh uh modern events made clear by the prophecy he meets the two men on the way to Emmas and uh And brother Brandham says, "Would you like to hear what he said?" &gt;&gt; Did you ever catch that? &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear? Would you sitting here today would like to hear what he said to the two men &gt;&gt; as he began to quote his life out of the scripture? And he quoted uh he quoted out of uh Psalms 22 and1. He cried at the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" In Psalms 22:17, I may tell all my bones that they look and they stare at me. Uh in Isaiah 9 and6, unto us a child is born, and a virgin shall conceive and so forth. And unto us a child is born. And the scripture actually says, "Unto us a son is given. The government shall be upon his shoulders. And his name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace." And also in Psalms 20, this is what brother Brandham is is repeating in Psalms 22:18. They parted his garments among them. Psalms 8 and and they parted my garments among them. This is what the scripture says. And cast my lot and cast lots upon my vesture. Isaiah 7 and4 a virgin shall conceive. Psalms 22 and 7 and 8 made him they mocked by his enemies. uh he his uh supposed to be friends, his enemies, the church. In Psalms 22 again, not a bone was to be broken, but they pierced his hands and his feet. In Isaiah 53 and 12, he died with male factors. In Isaiah 53:9, bruised and burned, I'm sorry, bruised and buried with the rich brother. In Psalms 16 and10, he was resurrected from the dead. David said, "So, I will not suffer my holy one to see corruption, neither will I leave his soul in hell. He was raised from the dead." Malachi 3, John the Baptist was his forerunner. And uh and and and he he continues on all of these scriptures. Now my question to this congregation and all who are streaming or listening is who is authorized to give those words that actually shaped and formed this one that it says and now God is with us. And then as time went on, he had some disciples and uh and uh then he comes to the garden of Gethsemane and the crowd comes. They're not his friends. They have become his enemies. Perhaps those that even were in his healing meetings. And now he has these people that have risen up against him and deci his he has close friends. He has a disciple by the name of Peter and he raises this takes his sword out and he's going to kill somebody. &gt;&gt; He's not going to just cut off somebody's ear. He he was aiming for something more than his ear. I can assure you. And when you get across, you can ask him just to make certain. I I I believe that he was going to split that guy right down the middle. But Jesus said, "Put up your sword. They that live by the sword will die by the sword." And and uh he says, "And then how how else will the scriptures be fulfilled?" &gt;&gt; His life was not only being shaped by the word, but he was allowing it to be shaped by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got that far. &gt;&gt; He was He was submitting himself. &gt;&gt; Put up your sword. We're not here to defend ourselves. &gt;&gt; We're not here to, you know, toh uh escape the hardships that have been promised. In other words, we give ourselves to the molding and the shaping. And thus the scripture could say he was the image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; Now we have God. Now we have an image of God. &gt;&gt; And if I ask that question, I want to ask a second question. Who has the words or the authority? And where did their authority come from to say, "Oh, well, we don't believe that. We believe something else." and and uh we're we're departing the message. Fine, go their way. &gt;&gt; But I say now, what's going to shape them into a bride of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; What form? &gt;&gt; What form do they expect to come in? &gt;&gt; And and will now this God that they have are shaping because they say, "Well, uh I have certain thoughts." Now you folks have to stay with me. &gt;&gt; I have certain thoughts. Well, who are you? &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; Who's a preacher? &gt;&gt; Who some wise person? Well, we we get on the internet and we can discover things. Get on the internet. What a tool of Satan. You're going to get on a tool of Satan, an advancement of science, and you think you're going to find out something about the truth. Let's get real. The truth is here in God's word &gt;&gt; and he was full of truth and grace and truth and that and and this is the absolute &gt;&gt; it's absolute truth. &gt;&gt; You know, you talk about simple uh I I I may raise some things that you'll have to ponder very very deeply. I had a I had a minister who's a pastor may be preaching this morning. He called me after I preached about the great the big brown bear vision and I spoke it for a purpose so that you would know that incidentally I'm going to just say something say it plainly I w I was there I have people speaking about it and telling all about it and they weren't even there You folks are privileged. &gt;&gt; You have an eyewitness. &gt;&gt; I was there. &gt;&gt; And I held that for many, many, many, many years. And what was what took place and the storm and the rain and the storm that left and so on. I had a a pastor call me and he said, "Can a prophet prophesy something in the name of the Lord?" and then it doesn't happen. He said, "I I I just want I understood you spoke on it." Yeah, I did. I said, "Well, I'll send it to you. I I've held it and kept it for many, many years, but I'll send it to you." And uh but to answer your question, I said, "Uh Jonah did." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now you're looking at me like you've never read about Jonah. &gt;&gt; Jonah went into Nineveh and he said, "In 40 days, this thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; 40 days this city will be destroyed." &gt;&gt; It wasn't. &gt;&gt; Well, someone says, "Well, because they repented." But that's the that didn't say that if they repented, it wouldn't be destroyed. He said it would be destroyed. And it was a prophecy by a prophet and it didn't happen. &gt;&gt; You want to hear the rest of this? Who has the who has the words? And who would be foolish enough in this congregation or in any congregation to submit their lives to the words of whoever to shape their life? And fact is if it happens to be a word of doubt, how is doubt going to shape your life? And if you think for a moment that your life isn't being shaped, it is. &gt;&gt; Something is shaping your life. &gt;&gt; And then you'll end up either an image of God &gt;&gt; or an image of uh an unknown image because because I can tell you that men now my heart is burning. See, uh I can tell you that men women say, "Well, I don't know about this and I'm kind of turning. I'm not a believer like I'm not committed like you folks are or whatever more. What are they &gt;&gt; and what shape what kind of form are they going to take? What kind of image are they going to are they going to be a image of the bride of Jesus Christ? And I'm asking who has the authority to shape that bride? Now here's the subtle here's the subtility. Say well if we only going to be a church anybody can be a church. You say well we have music we have choir we have uh you know we have missions or we have singers or we have whatever more. And these things can take the same place, can take the same shape. So they say, well, this is the same shape as that. And and uh if if that's all it is, but it has to be something more than than just a church. &gt;&gt; All right. Want as little movement as possible. Words actually shape lives. And I'm down the road quite a ways. And I don't want anyone to tamper with my testimony. I don't want anyone to tamper with my life. Don't want anyone to try to bear an influence on on your life either. We're not here to become lax. &gt;&gt; We're not here to become uh uh shall I say just casual and restive and relaxed about things. Now, you know, you might as well just uh uh I'm not just preaching here, but I'm preaching elsewhere also. And you'd be surprised where we get emails from. and questions from. And so I want to just deal with some things so that people will know we're not we're not casual about the message. &gt;&gt; We're not just building a church around a message. We're not going to just bear the name or identification as being uh you know where we're we're followers but we're not really committed to uh uh we we don't want to be too fanatical about things. I want to take the message exactly as it says &gt;&gt; and and if people have uh h have uh questions about it, well fine, then they can go and establish their own doctrine and their own. Now, do you know what denominations are? There are people who have this Bible &gt;&gt; in their pulpits &gt;&gt; and in their shelf and but but they don't quite agree with what it says or they don't see what it says. Now, if somebody wants to talk about the visions of Malachi 4 or visions that brother Brandham had, let let me tell you something. you go to Ezekiel and you interpret Ezekiel for me first. &gt;&gt; And when you've got that done, then then I then you'll have an ear you'll have my ear to I'll at least listen to you. But until you can go to Ezekiel, it it's I've read Ezekiel recently and I don't know exactly what he's saying because he's up in some other who who said that I have to be able to understand him and then people and theologians and everything and they go and do all kinds of research. You can't research and find out. And furthermore, let me make a statement. You can't take the God who is eternal with no beginning and no ending. Let me stop there. &gt;&gt; People are going to figure out God first. Tell me, do you understand something that's without beginning &gt;&gt; and without end? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, he says, you can't even figure out a blade of grass &gt;&gt; and they're going to understand the creator &gt;&gt; of all things. Let's be real friends and let's just say God is God &gt;&gt; and he does what he pleases to do and he says how he wants to say it and all he looks for and all all we have to do is commit ourselves to believing and &gt;&gt; saying well I I'm just a believer &gt;&gt; say well that's very very dangerous I don't think so I don't think so because God is God You're not going to turn nations around. They're going in a certain direction. And and uh uh you know, if we could just change things, we'd change things in Syria right away. For uh I'm I'm not pleased that people are suffering on the other side of the world, but it happens to be a reality. I'm not I'm not happy that innocent children are being killed. I'm not interested. Uh I'm I'm very interested, but I can't change that. Can you? &gt;&gt; No. you're sitting here today, children are being burned and so on under bombs and all of these things. We can't change that, but we have to believe that it's happening. &gt;&gt; It's in the news. So, it's happening. &gt;&gt; Am I being too plain? &gt;&gt; But but there's something that is uh critical here. And the critical part is we talk about a rapture uh who's going to go on a rapture a bride who is going to shape this bride. If God in his wisdom, if God in his mercy, if God in his extended mercy sends um a Malachi 4, which we believe in, sends a Malachi 4 with such a word. That word didn't come just idly to adjust our lives. That word comes to shape our lives. And when we're done being shaped and formed and in that is why that is why I am so obsessed by seeing that the word of God has preeminence because it's the only tool and the word of God is the only tool. And if and if that is God's tool, you can be absolutely certain. Satan wants to adjust it so it won't be quite as accurate. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; And so that we don't end up being exactly what God desires us to be. &gt;&gt; God has given us a thus sayaith the Lord and his purpose. his purpose and his purpose is to have that word do the molding, do the forming, do the shaping. And if someone raises their mind above that, then then they are uh giving themselves the uh the privilege. I I wouldn't say it's a privilege, but they are taking to themselves that that they can shape with their own minds the way their life should be. And listen friends, I've lived a long time &gt;&gt; and I have I've seen people you wouldn't believe the mess that people get into. Absolute disastrous mess &gt;&gt; because they're going to do it by their own self. by their own mind. I'm going to I'm going to direct my own self to be happy. I'm going to direct my own self to do certain things. And they disregard the scripture. Listen friends, without the scripture, your life is headed for disaster. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to just take my time. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I asked the question, who has the words or the that can form a bride for Jesus Christ and dare a corruptible human mind? Corruptible human mind. And friends, we have minds that are very degraded outside of the word of God. the mind. Satan is absolutely uh uh ready and present to sew seeds of doubt &gt;&gt; and even just a doubt. Now I'm I'm going to I'm going to ask some very specific questions and here's one of them and I have observed this. If somebody sews a doubt in a person's mind, what they're actually doing is taking away your absolute. &gt;&gt; They've removed the absolute. Now, where is the absolute? Well, if it's not here precisely, I could have taken time to be very very specific about uh certain uh maybe certain parts of life, but you you can fit it to yourself and they remove your absolute then then what this is what creates such confusion. Well, maybe it's here. Oh, may maybe it's over there. No, maybe it's here. Maybe it's with this group. No, maybe it's with this group. Maybe it's with that group. &gt;&gt; Where's the absolute? The absolute, the only absolute that we have is the word of God. &gt;&gt; I've listened to I've actually labored with people who only listen to tapes. You know what? They don't listen to the tapes. They play the tapes, &gt;&gt; but they don't listen to the tapes. &gt;&gt; They don't do what the tapes say. Are you sitting listen now? A lot of people read the messages. I got all of them there. And I I love them and have them marked up, but I can tell you that there's things on those books, things that I read in those books, and they're sharp tools. It's a very sharp tool because when I read it, I realize I don't just need to read this, but I need to submit myself &gt;&gt; to it. &gt;&gt; I need to submit myself. I need to submit myself so that my life can be shaped. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the word we say the word is Jesus Christ. So if we are kind of holding back from having Jesus Christ shape our lives, who's going to shape it? all somebody and and they've said all kinds of things and become uh well I don't know if I have you know I I'm going to be I'm going to be very very blunt today people become very very not only casual But well, what do you believe? Well, I don't know what I believe. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; You don't know what you believe. &gt;&gt; And where are you headed? &gt;&gt; Well, uh, where am I headed? The the country is full of it. &gt;&gt; The world is full of it. &gt;&gt; People are aimless. &gt;&gt; People are are without without direction. Your neighbors are that way. You're Your peers are that way. Other people that go to school with you or go to university, they don't have they don't have the answer. So, are you going to submit your life to someone who doesn't have the answer? &gt;&gt; I'd say not. That wouldn't be wise. &gt;&gt; That's true. So now there had to be there has to be one that could fulfill all the prophecies, all the things that were spoken of Jesus Christ. And then he said right when it come and he's facing he's facing probably the most difficult. He's facing the cross. He's facing the suffering. He's facing the death. He's facing all of those things. And his friend doesn't want him to endure that. But he says this scripture which I have here. I'll read it later. But how then? How then will the scriptures be fulfilled? He's not even talking about how his life but he he was the person who could fulfill it and he was the person who would fulfill it because he was giving himself to it. Now we can come to church here. We can come to church. We can have all the fellowship. We can uh join in all the activities and be accepted and all the rest of it. But it takes more than that. It takes something more than that. And that's not I'm not preaching something you have to do. I'm just saying if you do it, that's the only way to have your life shaped. &gt;&gt; Now, quite a few of you graduated from school, graduated from high school, and you're I'm right down where you live. Some of you have graduated from school and you've got decisions to make. Now what will I do? Which direction am I going to go etc? What is the best place for uh me to put my energies and uh and my studies and so on. Well, what do you want to be? So you imagine I want to be a mechanic or I want to be a carpenter or I want to be a housewife or I want to be whatever whatever. And you you make a choice and then you will start to do some study. Don't say I'm wrong because I'm not wrong. You'll do some studying and and you'll need to apply yourself. give yourself to it and your life will be shaped &gt;&gt; by what you study. And those words on the book are going to come into your life and you're going to make it practical if you're going to get anywhere and you're going to become if you're going to be successful, you're going to have to let those words shape your life. &gt;&gt; I want to just say something to you. If you plan to go to heaven, &gt;&gt; you better let these words shape your life. [Applause] And you better know what it says. &gt;&gt; You need to know what it says. &gt;&gt; I need to know what it says. So, I'm not taking my time up here lightly. I I I feel that there are things that need to be said and and it's not it's not a uh it's not a private matter that people you know they today they get all all use all the tactics and all the blogs and all the rest of it. I don't have time for it. People you want to say well I'm ignorant. I'm thankful I'm very ignorant. I I just by accident I come across too much stuff and I and when I do see some stuff I think what would happen if some of you young people read that. &gt;&gt; What would happen? It's not going to be healthy for you. &gt;&gt; I've talked to some of you and you say, "Well, I've I've read this and it's left me discouraged." Of course, it leaves you discouraged. And furthermore, it leaves you in a state you don't know what to believe. &gt;&gt; And I will say this that the it's much easier on the flesh to go the way that Satan offers you. But it is a it's not a lifechanging experience. Your life takes on no form at all. no form. It just, you know, flows with goes with the flow sort of thing. I want to take we're only having one service and I'm not going to keep you long, but I want to uh get across some things. Is that all right? Thank you. I'm going to just go quickly for a few moments uh because I want to I want to get past some things here. You know, the first one to ever give a prophecy, you know, the first one that ever gave a prophecy was God himself. &gt;&gt; And here's the prophecy. and he's speaking. This is going to shock you. He didn't give it to a believer. He didn't give it to a prophet. He didn't give it to him. He gave it to the serpent. The first prophecy was given by God to the serpent. In other words, he prophesied to the devil himself what he was going to do. And he says, "Now I'm going to put enmity between you and the woman." &gt;&gt; And between your seed and her seed. You know, anyone who wants to argue about the serpent's seed. Figure that one out. I just want you to tell me who the who who the serpent seed. Here's God who can't lie talking to the serpent saying, "I'm going to put enmity between you and the woman." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And between her seed. Yes. &gt;&gt; And your seed &gt;&gt; tutfony. &gt;&gt; That's the end of it. &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. &gt;&gt; And then he says, "And you will bruise and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Who's going to fulfill that? Well, uh, I I don't want to just preach a happy time for you out of the Bible. I want to preach some things that you have to really deal with. So God gave that prophecy. Jesus Christ was the only one who conquered death. &gt;&gt; Is the only one who crushed the head of the serpent. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm building. He's the only one who defeated the devil and is the only one who fulfilled every word. And that was where Jesus said in Matthew 26 and it was at Gethsemane. He said, "But how then shall the scripture be fulfilled?" He's asking a question. And I want to ask a awaiting congregation of people. We could talk about the rapture and we believe in it. We can speak about the change of the bodies and we can believe on it. But I say I want to say to you, who is going to inherit that? Who's going to inherit those scriptures? And there are things that you know things that is not negative necessarily but there are things that the prophet of God has spoken which cause me to think very very deeply and he says there'll be few. &gt;&gt; There'll be very few and I could get up and sing the chorus real quickly. I'm one of the few. But that won't do it in itself. It's one there are things. So that then I start asking myself and I've got it written down here friends. What is the bride going to fulfill? &gt;&gt; He's already fulfilled his part. &gt;&gt; He said, "How else will the scripture be fulfilled? I'm prepared to go all the way." Are you prepared to go all the way? We can sing about it. All the way. All the way. I'm prepared to go all the way. But now we have to uh come to grips in this world. What I see taking place in this world really I agree I have to agree I say amen is a devil's world. &gt;&gt; This is a devil's world. And I have to agree with the prophet of God when he says every every government &gt;&gt; is of the devil &gt;&gt; and education is of the devil. Not that two and two equals four. He's not talking about that kind of education. Learn and get all that you can and use all that you can for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you still say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now God spoke says that he might present himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. Now, that's not a group of people that's going to try to make themselves holy. Try to make themselves He's already said it. &gt;&gt; He's already spoken it. &gt;&gt; So, the equipment is all in place. &gt;&gt; All we need to do is material as material is just submit and give ourselves to it. I'm going to take you now. I'm I'm just going to take you into some You'll have to stay with me. I'm going to take you into some thoughts. I know exactly what I'm doing. I know exactly how I'm presenting this to you, but I want you to think about some things. Says, "Strange gods are they." And he said, "Thou shalt make no grave in image." And he said, "Ears they have but they don't hear. Eyes they have but they don't see." And we are sitting here as living creatures. We have eyes. We have ears. And we are going to need a God &gt;&gt; that hears and sees. and a God that speaks &gt;&gt; and speaks truth &gt;&gt; so that our lives will be shaped &gt;&gt; according to the author's plan. And brother Bram talks about Michelangelo and the years that he took to make a make an image to Moses as Moses. And it was so real and that he struck the image and cried out speak &gt;&gt; because it was so much like the image of Moses. I have a I have a quote here I'll come to and and brother Brandon was talking about the bride becoming so much like the bridegroom &gt;&gt; that the two are actually one. Yes. &gt;&gt; She's so much like it. &gt;&gt; Tell me folks, what word is going to shape the bride? &gt;&gt; What word is it? And uh how much are we going to give ourselves to it? I've spoken to people about the message. They they don't know it. Plain don't know the message at all. But it is a message. What would you do if your children I think now brother Mr. Tatch you're going through some studies. I've talked to others of you that are doing advanced studies and you tell me when I ask you how are you doing says well it's pretty hard it's difficult you know I have a bit of a problem and we're wanting to get from this life to another life but we'll study much harder you tell me if it's True. We'll study much harder for a job or some further education. &gt;&gt; You'll give much more time to that than we even give trying to get to heaven. &gt;&gt; Is it so? &gt;&gt; Is that the way it should be? &gt;&gt; Or is should there be a change? &gt;&gt; And what kind of a change? Is it going to come easy? Well, it may not come easy. Will it take will it take some devotion? Will it take some deep consideration? I think it will. &gt;&gt; I really think it will. In the rapture message, I'll just I'm going to just read this and see why I have it here. But in the sight of God, the bride is justified in the sight of God. She never done it in the first place. You know what, friends? I've pondered that real deep. I pondered it real deep because there isn't a man, woman, or young person. There isn't a man, woman, or child that when they read that don't have things in their mind that God who spoke it doesn't have in his mind. Isn't that the truth? And you are made to remember, caused to remember things that are are are have a a a have a decided effect upon your life. And I say to you in the name of Jesus Christ, that needs to end. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how will it end?" I don't know. But I'm going to I'm going to give you a little personal testimony here in a few moments of what I believe that we as a congregation need. I believe that believers of this message need I really believe they need it and mass whatever whatever uh whatever God can do in their life. I really believe it's ne necessary and that is that there is a there is a a place and I pondered this very very deeply and I'm taking my deliberate time. There is a place there's an element where we go beyond this is the Bible but I need to go beyond the Bible not in its words not in its saying but in what the purp what is the purpose of this Bible it come to make known to me an invisible God and the purpose of it is that I will have a connection with that God &gt;&gt; know that's exactly what people need that you have a connection. Why did God send William Brandham? Why did he send him? Why did he send any prophet? It was actually to bring the people back to God. But why did he send a messenger of our time? Why did he send it? Well, I had some rare opportunities. I had some rare rare privileges. I have an email on my phone right now all the way from South America. And a man is in need, in desperate need, and he's crying out for deliverance. Satan is has played havoc with his life and he's bound and he's he he's even spoken about I think he's a businessman sounds like a professional man and the only reason I'm mentioning it is because it's current it's right now and he speaks about the only thing that he really has as an option is suicide He must have deliverance from this way of life. What led him there? But he's he's he he'sard of a testimony and something that took place in the in the prophet's life and you were there. He said you were there and I would like to hear what is it that brought the deliverance and brought the release. That's what I need. So he's identified that and that's right. That's as of now. But now I'm talking about that that's fine for a brother. I trust that he will have that. But now now when we have a congregation of people, we come here to church and we sing and we pray and we do things and we have our activities and we do things and we have things over at the school and we do things. We have things at the camp and we're preparing things all the time. And friends, I I I I'm happy for the activity, but it has to go beyond activity. &gt;&gt; There's something that is, and brother Ben Brandon calls it sometimes a something. &gt;&gt; There's something that's inexplainable because it's from another realm. But I want to bring it to you. I personally believe that and you help me now, but I personally believe that there is a capability within the bride of Jesus Christ. If you are a member of the bride of Jesus, if you're called to be in the bride of Jesus Christ, then there is a a you say, well, just stop there a moment. I want to come to I'll I'll just take the woman at the well first. And what led me here is because brother Brandham spoke about two worlds. And now we have a man who said, "I'm standing I'm standing in two worlds right now." No prophet in the scripture ever said that. And now God has given you a prophet that said, "I'm standing between two worlds right now. I'm standing in two worlds." And it just tears me up because of what I see. I see this person maybe 20 years ago, 30 years ago, or in the future see things taking place. And then if this continues on and continues on, I'm in in in visions and in in in in one world and and then he said it gets to the place where I don't know where I'm at. You don't have a you don't hardly have a prophet say that. You brothers know that. It's what he said. I I'm I'm I'm coming to a point, but it'll take me a few moments. So he said, "Now I'm in in two worlds. When I read that, I'm I'm I'm I'm gripped by it. See, I don't have to get into a whole bunch of doctrinal things and what he said and how he said it and what does it mean this and then it doesn't mean that and then get into some man's mind of opinion of what he said. I don't want anything to do with that. I I I don't need that because that's not going to get me anywhere. But whatever whatever this man whatever this prophet of God is saying, I I believe with all my heart he's in two worlds. &gt;&gt; And the reason I believe that is because then he begins to speak in this world to the individual, what he's receiving from another world and what he gets from another world. He speaks to that person over and over says, "Raise your hand. Is that true?" and they raised their never once no one said it no it's not true it's always true &gt;&gt; so what I'm conveying to you is I personally want to be connected with that place &gt;&gt; where the truth comes &gt;&gt; and now we have a vessel &gt;&gt; that is in touch with this world and in touch with another world and now I'm becoming this vessel which is called Jesus Christ got weary. This vessel which we called William Brham. I don't know you've never met him. I did. He would get weary. This vessel Jesus Christ would get hungry. He would get thirsty. So he was on a certain journey but he had to go a certain place. He had to go to Samaria. It happens to be a scripture that the angel of the Lord directed brother Brandham to &gt;&gt; because it was one that was going to use all the time and he used it many many times. &gt;&gt; Why? What effect does that have on us? Said he was directed by an angel of God to use that. That must have some effect on me because this is a messenger to me. What kind of a message is this giving it? What kind of a signal is this sending me? So he starts talking about the woman at the well and I begin to ponder her again yesterday and today yesterday. So now she's a Samaritan and he's sitting on the well. And he says, "Get give me to drink cuz he's thirsty. He's a man. He's thirsty. That's this world. Here's the well. Here's a woman. Here's a man. That's all in this world. Why am I saying? Why am I even talking this way? You might even wonder where it's going. But we're not interested in staying in this world. &gt;&gt; If time goes on, there isn't going to be one of you left here. You're not going to live that long. &gt;&gt; Believe me, I know you're not just not going to live that long. And then and then what? And then where? &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you where are you going to be? &gt;&gt; And that's what a person has to come. These people are wise and they got all kinds of things that's you know all kinds of questions and they've got their own ideas and so on. Just come back in another come back in a hundred years and tell me &gt;&gt; what what are they going to have? So this woman at the well now he says uh give me to drink. It's all this world. He said if you knew who it was if you knew the gift of God you would ask me and I'll give you to drink and you'll never thirst again. Says sir give me this water. Jesus says, "Go and get your husband." Now, she comes to a part of her life that she's not proud of. She said, "Well, uh, I don't have a husband." And that would be an answer for a lot of people. I don't have a husband. And he said, "Well, that's right. What you've said is exactly right. But you've had five. And brother Bon says her eyes are flashing now. You've had five and the one that you have now is not your husband. Sir, now she's being pulled into another realm. Sir, I perceive I perceive something is working here. I perceive you are a prophet. That still isn't good enough. He's still a man. He's now he's a prophet, but he's still a man. And and and this should mean something to you. Now he they turn religious. There's there are people even in this day that are happy to talk to you about the message, &gt;&gt; happy to talk to you about church, &gt;&gt; happy to talk to you about their church. But you can't have a thing to do with their church because you don't know what they believe. &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going to shape your life. &gt;&gt; Whatever is being taught is going to shape your life. &gt;&gt; That is why you need to give yourself to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to psychology. Give yourself to something else and that's what you'll be. But if you give yourself to an a word that is proven to be a true word and a word that actually comes from another place. Say you don't have to be very smart to say one thing for sure. I want to go to another place. &gt;&gt; One thing is certain. I want to go wherever that kind of answer comes from. I was in the midst of a lot of confusion. I was in the midst of a lot of uh real trouble in my life and I spoke a word that resolved it. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's the source I want to hang on to. &gt;&gt; That's the source I want to be a part of. And now she had a she has another kind of confusion. And the confusion is not about her marital status any longer. Her confusion is about well worship. &gt;&gt; We the Samaritans, we say and she'd been taught that we need to worship in this mountain. And the Jews say we should worship in Jerusalem. Now she's getting close, isn't she? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And she got the right desire. She wants to know And he says, "Uh, well, salvation's of the Jews." And we know, we know because being a Jew, and he wasn't a Jew, we know that. But he says, and and it's what she said now. She said, "I know that when the Messiah comes, when the Messiah's come, he will tell us all things. Now friends, here's where I'm coming right to the very razor edge of something and I hope you can get it. &gt;&gt; Don't struggle too hard. But when he said, "I that speak to thee am he." Now, don't read anything into my books. Don't read anything into my message. But when he said, "I that speak to thee am he," that's where something took place. And she realized she realized that this was the this was her answer. And she reached out. Now, an unseen force had done something. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason I'm talking to you is I know exactly what that is. &gt;&gt; When a pillar of fire came into the car and the prophet of God is saying, "I I I I'm the same place that woman was. I was I was I had a lot of discouragement, a lot of failure in the in the wonderful believers. Oh, could we fellowship? Yeah. Well, wonderful fellowship. Could we visit each other's home? Absolutely, we did. We did. We hug each other. We hugged each other. We shook hands. We wept together. We had the Lord's table together. We did all of those things. But somehow there was still something that was missing. Is it in Jerusalem or is it in in the mountain? Do you have to be a Samaritan or do you what do you have to do? &gt;&gt; And now now something I'm caught into something. And she was at a well. I was in a car. What What do you think of this ministry, brother Ed? Brother Eddie, he said, "Do you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as is foretold in the in the scripture and Genesis and Revelation and so on?" Then his vase voice just trailed off and I hung my head. This is a part that's too confusing to me yet. I can't understand it. I can't sort it out. Listen, friends, when you get right down to I'm talking about where the real rubber hits the road, where we have to assess our lives in in the spiritual aspect. Not not just coming to church, not just singing a song, not just hearing watch night service, not just that. It's it can be that, but it can be so much more blessed. And the invitation is out for believers because I want to say to you within the message, you can say it's in a tape or it's in a book or it's in a a disc or whatever form. I don't care what form it's in. I am here telling you there's an element &gt;&gt; in that message &gt;&gt; that your soul &gt;&gt; cries out for &gt;&gt; and that you need &gt;&gt; to get from this place to that place &gt;&gt; and that is what you must pursue &gt;&gt; whether it's at an altar &gt;&gt; I don't say whether it's at home whether it's in your car whether it's in your business. &gt;&gt; But all I can tell you, it's a real element. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. &gt;&gt; And I want to go a step further. It is a person. &gt;&gt; And it is the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't know what figure you have, what shape you have of Jesus Christ. What do you think of him going in long flowing gowns and walking along the shores of Galilee? I don't. It's not my business to say how you view him, but I can tell you that so many many that come to church don't have that understanding of him. He's what you need as an individual. And you should you should stop at nothing &gt;&gt; until you have that because someday someday &gt;&gt; you're going to need him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I want to make another statement. If you make that kind of contact, and I would stop at nothing until you I would urge you to stop at nothing till you have made that kind of contact. And once you make that kind of contact and you know that this is a person when you even bow your head and say whether it's over the table or as I did this morning I said father it's different it's not some feeling out of the emotion it's something that you know it's something you've experienced I know you're my Father, &gt;&gt; it's not because I'm old and and you're young. It's not that I was young once also, but I experienced him in some simple ways. And I knew one thing. I knew one thing. And friends, I'm pouring my life's blood out to you right now. I know one thing. Whether it's a god that just raised a little flower out of the out of the woods and as I would walk through the woods and sees the little flower I just stand there and weep because I knew it was my God &gt;&gt; that created that and I'm here able to enjoy it. &gt;&gt; I knew that something was different. When I see the mountains or see the streams or see something it is it is that something people feel connected with nature. It's more than feeling connected with nature. You're being connected with the one who made the nature, one who made the all of the things, whether it be the streams and all of these things. And I understand people today wanting to be connected with nature. I feel a connection with with nature and with creation and so on. It's more than that. You have to have a connection with the creator &gt;&gt; himself. And once you have that, the Bible's different. &gt;&gt; The message is different. &gt;&gt; Believers are different. &gt;&gt; So I go to a message church and that's different. You just feel different about it. You come and you're different. And people say, "Well, I I you know, they they maybe admire a certain part of your life." And I know what it is they're admiring. I really do. I really do because it's an abstract. It's a part that you can't define. And so I said I said to brother Benham, I don't know for for all I would know. I said I I I and I think I'm talking like the woman was to Jesus. For all I know, it must be. It has every appearance of being. And a being. People say, "Well, well, did you see it?" No, you're in the wrong channel. If I could see it, it wouldn't be real. &gt;&gt; Well, how did you know? Well, I mean, how do I know I'm beside you? I I I I look at your face. I have some senses that tell me that I'm there. But you know, you know, even science has proven that you could get you can be around you can be in an elevator and there's all kinds of conversation going place and elevator doors open and and in stops uh in comes another stranger and suddenly nobody has anything to say. people looking at their watches because they feel the subconscious and they are because there's a a aura there's a presence all I can tell you you cannot friends I'd love to go down to your seat and tell you you cannot be in his presence &gt;&gt; without feeling him &gt;&gt; you cannot be in his presence without feeling like you're going to die &gt;&gt; you can't be in his presence is till you're so touched. Now you're talking to you're you are right beside the one who brought you and gave you life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then you find out that he has a he has a purpose in your life. You know friends, some of the most precious things I can't tell you about because they're so precious. I wouldn't want them be to be doubted. But there isn't anybody here that wouldn't want the same thing to happen. Have you ever been in a dilemma? You know what I mean by a dilemma? Have you ever been in a time where you don't know where you can go forward or backward or have you been Have you experienced those times? Have you experienced those times? &gt;&gt; It just seems like the whole world, you've experienced those times. I'm going to tell you something. I stood right on this platform not far from where Tom is sitting. this last year and I was in a an incredible insoluble problems so many problems I didn't know what more to do deep problems difficult insoluble problems what is the answer where is the answer say well God is the answer Christ is the answer. Yeah, I know he's the answer, but he seems silent. Have you ever been there? When he's been silent, I tell you, when he works, when he does something, when he takes a step, he can cause things to just turn to ether &gt;&gt; and they disappear. &gt;&gt; And I stood right there where Brother Tom is at the close of a service. I'm talking about reality now. I I realize this is a service and this isn't a customary service and this isn't the way I usually preach, but I knew where I was coming to. I want to get right down where you live. I want to get right down where some of you young men and young ladies and so on. I've had such a I've been burdened the last few days because I've been harboring this. I know he's real. I know he's so real. There isn't a young person here. There isn't a man or woman here. And I'm holding this in my heart and people come into my office and they they're seeking answers and I know what the answers are. I haven't got time to kind of bring people to this place. But it is this this element that's in the message, this element that's in the word of God. How how was it that Jesus could do so many miracles and feed thousands of people and with the bread? Who who can I'm baffled. How do you get around a miracle like that? How How is it those people aren't following him? &gt;&gt; How is it those people where are they at the cross? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And after these ministries and after all of this effort of getting the message out and to getting people and churches are formed and pastors and preachers and all these things and then have a prophet listen to me, friends. &gt;&gt; You better listen to He says, "There'll only be few." &gt;&gt; Well, I I don't know what few means. I don't know how many is, but I know one thing. I want to be one of those. &gt;&gt; And if I want to be connected with that, then I better be connected now. And and that's why the message came is to connect us &gt;&gt; with that &gt;&gt; to let you know it's more than just a song. It's more than clapping your hands. It's more than a good sermon. It's more than having this physical things. It's more than a well. and more than a water and more than a bucket and more than being thirsty. It's more than being confused. It's more than having five husbands and more than living with one now, more than all of that. It was just there was the answer was right there sitting on the well, but she had to get connected with another place &gt;&gt; and then acknowledge it and give herself to it. &gt;&gt; And that's why the message has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just a bunch of books, friends. It is not just a bunch of books. You can sit here forever and thinking it's a bunch of books or a bunch of tapes or a bunch of quotes. I get sick of that because there's so much more. I I I can my wife can tell you I can I can sit over two or three pages in a message because I'm having a a an interaction with the one who was giving himself to this vessel, this prophet to show to these people to bring it in such a way and in such simplicity. And with what people perceive as mistakes, I think, oh my goodness, you haven't even you're not even in the right ballpark. &gt;&gt; You're not even on the right planet. &gt;&gt; He even did those things for his own reasons. And it's not for us to try to figure out what his reason is. He just does it because he's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And that's the reality. I think that's the key. That's the secret. And you might say, and I don't want to be necessarily flooded, but I'm trying to make it as plain to you as possible. There's a certain characteristic within the message. And one day you'll find out, you know what? This is a person. This is a person. This is a person that I I really love. I don't just sing, Jesus, I love you. &gt;&gt; But this is a person that now. And that person comes and tells you. He tells you things that you need to hear &gt;&gt; and he told me things as I stood right on this platform here and I'm giving that testimony at the beginning of this year. I was happy to know that this was the Lord's day. I want to use this Lord today to honor him and say Lord Jesus say to you people you talk to me and you took some took real things matters of life that were insoluble and the wisest people of this world couldn't give me the answer. You go to the finest people and like you say you've been to a doctor. Yes. Yes. Yes, I've been to a doctor and he told you this and told you that. Yes. Yes. Raise your hand. That's true. Yes, that's true. That's fine. But that's not enough. &gt;&gt; They got to hear an answer coming from another place and give themselves to that answer because friends, one day you're going to need that connection to go from this place to that place. &gt;&gt; And you want to live in that place. you want to live in that place. &gt;&gt; And in the automobile, in the car when he was he was there and you may not know or understand. We're just driving. Brother Brandon's driving. That's this world to drive around a curve. That's this world. I have a gun. That's this world. I'm a hunter. That's this world. There stands a great big animal right in the middle of the road. Some power from another world made him stand there. His creator made him stand there. And now this vessel, this prophet of God. I said, "Oh, there's a moose. Stop brother Brandon. I'll get him." because he was an easy shot from there. Stop and I'll get him. No, no, his voice is heavy. It's okay. It's all right, Brother Eddie. Just get your gun and your bullets. It's all right. And he keeps driving within about 30 m, 30 yards of that animal and stops. And I step out and shoot that animal. Then I'm worried. Is he going to drop in the road? If he could, there could be an accident cuz there's a little hill and all these things are flooding my mind. Is he going to just go in the ditch and fall there and somebody will steal him? We haven't got room. All of these things are and and it he just walks over and goes through a couple of trees and falls between on after a big windfall and laid there. Now I'm finishing and we dressed him out. Brother, another person was there, Brother Blaine Southwick, eldest son of Brother Southwick. I've never ever heard a word out of his mouth. He did. He didn't feel anything. Friends, I wish I could get it across to you. You can be sitting right next to one person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And one person gets it and next one doesn't get it. He was sitting right behind me. It didn't mean it didn't mean a thing to him. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't go out of this meeting without it meaning something to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want I want to put you in contact with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, you believe me and I I want to tell you how real he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we just finished and we got back in the car and there was um there was just a presence. I'm sorry to take so much time, but there was just a I kind of sat back and I thought I'd like to live here forever. And he just looked at me a little bit and he said, "Brother Eddie, every time he comes, something good happens." And that's my testimony to you. every time he comes. When you come here to this building that human hands have built and brothers built, some of them aren't here. We labored. When you come here, just say, "I'm here for one purpose. I want to talk to you. I want to sense that you're nearby. I'm going to need that someday. might be sooner than you think. Some of you young people, you might feel today that you don't really need it, but the day will come when you do need it. &gt;&gt; When you do need it. And you that are older, we never know. But you know, there'll be a time when you need that person. say, "I'm a believer, and I'm happy that we can say we're are believers of this message, but you're going to need the one that was being revealed. You're going to need the author." Please don't just come don't don't don't fail and just make this a a church or a central place of your fellowship. We should have an fellowship amongst the saints, but whatever you do, whatever you do, come to meet him. come come to know him. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you even get lost in some other. This is how I was. My heart was almost broken. I was crushed. How long does it take? You might be crushed for a year. You might be crushed for two years. This had been going on for me for it was my load. It was a man's load. It was a husband's load. It was dad's load. This wasn't anyone else's load. But I knew one who knew it. I knew that the Lord Jesus had said in his word, "Certain things are to take place." and I'm to bear certain burdens and I was in that but I needed I needed a connection. I needed a connection elsewhere. &gt;&gt; And friends, you might be a woman, you might be a teenager, but mark my word, I don't care what station of life you're in, one day will come when you'll need that connection. &gt;&gt; And you might be in a dilemma right now. You might be in a young person's dilemma. You might be in your teens and I know that when you're in your teens and there's all kinds of things flood your mind and but what kind of home your life going to have and what kind of wife or what kind of a husband? All of these things flood your mind. Where am I going to go? What what what how should I give what should I give myself to? What should I study? Where do I go? What kind of a profession should I have? I'll tell you one thing. I'm not ashamed of it. Make your profession. I want to make heaven my home. &gt;&gt; That's my profession. That's the only thing. God sent me a message and sent me a messenger so I wouldn't miss it. &gt;&gt; And I don't plan to miss it. &gt;&gt; Will you bow your head with me, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus? Sometimes it's not easy to speak those things that the closest to your heart, but the people have been so kind. They've been so receptive in a way. They've been so attentive and so listening. And Lord Jesus, I can't even equate myself with how you love the people. But we do love them. We don't want to see harm come to any. We want to see each one, Lord. We look we look beyond the veil, beyond the curtain of time. And there we want to embrace and greet one another and know it's over. It's over. It's over. As your messenger said, it's over. The battle's over. The last sermon's been preached. And here we are now. We're entering it to 2017. We don't know what the future holds. By the end of this year, things dramatic things could happen and we do not know when they likely will happen. But then, oh God, we want to have that uh divine connection. Oh God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. I want to pray for each one, Lord. each one that have been so loyal and dear friends. And we've journeyied with some a short time and with others a longer period of time. But oh God, Father, hear my prayer now. I pray Lord that we may be able to not only greet one another but with such joy, with such a uh such a release, such an unspeakable joy and thanksgiving when the world is done, turmoil is done, temptation is done, all the evil is done, oh God, in the generation you've called us to live, live. I know that you've given us the answer. Let us derive the answer from your message, oh God. From your prophet's message, Father, may we hear him, may we hear you. When we read a passage, oh God, may we not only see that this is a man speaking in his in in in his utterance, perhaps failing in his utterance, but oh God, you will not fail in making yourself known. And all we need to know, oh God, is that you know, you know, you understand, and you have made a way. I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ you'll cause us to absorb what we needed to absorb in this meeting Lord you'll take these words as frail as they are and you will implant them into hearts of faith oh God I see the earnestness in the faces looking oh god into the eternities looking beyond father this world this world this world. We leave this world, oh God, to whoever wants it. But we want the world to come, oh, Father, that's what we're that's what we're being uh that's what we're being indoctrinated towards, oh Father. And you send us and there certain so many aspects within the within the message and in the messengers's voice. Father, we feel drawn. We feel drawn, Lord. I feel a drawing. and I feel a pull. I pray you'll bless this people, Father, in Jesus name. This day, this first day of this year, &gt;&gt; bless them, I pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Does someone feel like they'd like to stand? &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, you've just somehow moved my heart and I'm one that's yearning. I'm one that's longing. I'm one that's craving. I'm craving for that supernatural aspect, that supernatural element, oh God. So that we within this congregation join attribute to attribute, desire to desire, oh God. And when the people are in one place and in one mind and in one accord, oh God, the supernatural takes place and how we need it. Oh father, in Jesus name. Oh God, I pray. Pray for the people that are here, those that may stand and those that are kneeling. Oh God, you'll grant. Grant to them, I pray. Come, oh Savior. Come, oh, come, oh holy one. Come, oh Holy Spirit.
