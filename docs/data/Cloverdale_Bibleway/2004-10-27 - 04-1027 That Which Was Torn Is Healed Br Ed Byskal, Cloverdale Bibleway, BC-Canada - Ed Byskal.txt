We have one prayer request from uh Sister Brittney Moore, please pray for my 2-year-old brother Ryan, who will be undergoing undergoing ear surgery uh tomorrow morning. So, we want to remember Sister Britney Moore. Amen. If you've got a prayer request or something heavy on your heart, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. Amen. And if you're on the internet, telephone hookup, just join us. Stand where you are and raise your hand to him as we go to prayer. Brother John. I know it's customary for the person leading in prayer to pray, but I wonder tonight if we could just have each one of you pray in your own special way. The Bible says when the people shall begin to pray. &gt;&gt; So why don't you just pray what's in your own heart. Just lift up your voice tonight. Amen. Father, we lift up our hearts to you and our hands together. Our voices coming before your throne. Not just one, but a whole congregation of believers. First of all, we want to get out of the way. Father, we want to thank you, Lord, for amazing grace. It's because of your hand on our lives that we can stand in your presence. Lifting up our hands, lifting up our hearts, yielding our members, surrendering ourselves, asking that you would come tonight in a special way, visit this address here in Cloverdale. Lord, let all the sin of any lives here be under the blood. Let nothing stand between us tonight. Father, what could you do in your presence, in your house tonight? If every brother and sister here would get out of the way, yield their members. Father, speak to us tonight. Father, let there be a channel opened up, Lord, of praise, of adoration. Father, on a Wednesday night, Lord, we can lift up our voices, lift up our hearts, lift up our needs, Father. Lord, one word spoken from you into our lives. One word from your presence. God, we're waiting on you. For thus sayeth the Lord, in every situation. Hands are lifted up. Father, needs are being expressed. Lord, we believe you're the creator. You're the one, Lord, that same yesterday, today, and forever. You stand in the sanctuary. Lord, we believe men and women bought by your blood, purchased by your very own blood. We've been washed by your cleansing blood. Tonight we stand redeemed. Father, minister to every life that's here. Those out on the internet, those on the phone hook up. Father, may there be a spiritual contact into that other dimension. Jesus, speak to us tonight by your word. Lord, get a hold of the minister's mind. Get a hold of the gift in his life. Speak to every young lady, every young man, every brother, every sister. Father, we're hungry for your voice tonight, Lord. We're happy to be in your presence. Lord, we're grateful that we can be in a place where we can let off the pressure. That in the midst of gross darkness, there's still light. Your spirit is still alive. Your word is still fresh. Father, we pray you'd minister to Brother Ryan. Father, two-year-old Father having a surgery tomorrow. Father, would you open up his hearing? Father, open up our hearing. Father, do a surgery tonight in this building. Let our eyes be open. and let our hearts be opened. Let our desires be quickened. Father, fill our lamps, Lord, with oil. Trim the lamps, Lord. If there's any blackness, any suiness, Lord, take it away, Lord. Anything that would hinder anything that would cause us to fall short or miss the mark, Father, may your spirit, Lord, just go from heart to heart, lamp to lamp, Lord. Quicken us tonight, Jesus. Let there be miracles even tonight, Lord. We believe we're in the season of adoption, Lord, where men and women can speak to the mountain in their lives. They can speak, Lord. He that is in you, Lord. We confess it is you, Lord, that's among us tonight. We're here to give you glory. Here to bow down. Here to worship. Here to say yes to your word. Have your way tonight, Jesus. We sense your presence already. Father, something good is going to happen tonight. You're among us, Lord. You're here. Two or three gathered in your name, Lord. And we've gathered in your name, Jesus. Confirm your word and vindicate your nearness &gt;&gt; by bringing it to pass &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, I want to welcome everyone tonight. name of our Lord Jesus Christ. You're visiting with us. We want to say God bless you. It's good to have you. I trust you feel welcome in his presence. Amen. Why don't we as we get ready for the word, let's sing that little song. Oh, what a friend who walks beside me, holds my hand. Oh, what a friend who walks beside me to hold my hand and safely guide me. Make me always. Oh, what a friend. He is to me. He knows the way. He knows the way. I go his way and he can't see around my pathway standing. He'll take me through when he is standing. Oh, what a friend. to me for a friend. Oh, what a friend who walks beside me to hold my hand and safely guide me. Safely height me. All I know you are to me. He knows the way. He knows the way. My road is winding and he can't see around my pathway landing. will take me through when he Oh my turn and service brother. Let's sing that little chorus. He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. Amen. He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. He is here. Oh, holy, holy. Oh, I will bless his holy name. Oh, he is here just you will never be the same. Well, a great deal depends on what kind of an order we put in. &gt;&gt; You have to put in an order. I know you've heard it many times, but it's true. You get what you expect. &gt;&gt; So often that's why special meetings are special. There's nothing really a nothing really that different with the preaching or with the preacher or with the people or with the place. What is really different in a special meeting is people come with a whole different expectation &gt;&gt; and they're coming expecting to receive. I'm going to hear something and and they do. Amen. I'm going to receive something and they do. So it shouldn't surprise us &gt;&gt; when people expect to do it &gt;&gt; because that's exactly what he promised. You expect it, you'll receive it. &gt;&gt; So I hope you're expecting something tonight. &gt;&gt; If you didn't put in any order, well, don't be disappointed when you go home with an empty basket. But if you came expecting something, you certainly won't go home empty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I suppose most of you saw the eclipse of the moon. &gt;&gt; God declaring things in the heavens. &gt;&gt; We don't know uh exactly what's taking place, but something taking place for sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh the light testifying once again church ages. The light the light uh being the world getting in the way. the light. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what was wrong with Leodysia. &gt;&gt; But we're not in that age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're in a bright age. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad for bride age. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I uh I I want to give you just a few uh quick announcements because we don't want to be that long this evening. But on Sunday, which we've announced, we're having a communion, Lord's table, footwashing Sunday evening. And on there will be quite a number coming up from Seattle. I don't know how many, but as many as possibly can are coming up from Seattle. My wife and I went to uh Tacoma uh yesterday. Going to have to do something with this equipment. Let's use this one. Let's take it off. This is exactly what I had to do at the last series of meetings. They had me one of these new fan tangle things. I said, "Take it off and let me preach with this old one. I'm going to learn that song. There'll be no wires in heaven." For sure. &gt;&gt; My dislike for wires is growing into something that's even deeper than dislike. I can guarantee you there's no wires in heaven. &gt;&gt; We just get into something important and then they start to fail us. Uh but on uh we went down and were with our brother Anatoli from Usbekiststan. He has just arrived from touring a number of places in the states. Some places he had relatives and people from his city that are scattered in different places in Europe and also in the states. Some are in Germany and I think he was with some down in Florida. His brother-in-law is in the Tri Cities, Washington State. And so he was there and his brother-in-law I think and sister drove him over to brother Machmoods. And then we drove down and spent the evening with them about 3 hours or so to late uh last evening and uh then drove back partly last night and partly this morning making it quite a long day. But he said that some of the people from Tri Cities, he doesn't know how many, but they're going to drive all the way so they can be here for Sunday evening service. And I understand that one or maybe more want to be rebaptized. So, uh, he said his brother-in-law wants to be rebaptized. They're Pentecostal people. Uh, so we don't know what to expect for Sunday evening, but we're just expecting a great time, and quite frankly, we don't care how long the service goes on. We're going to have the Lord's table. We're going to have foot washing. We're going to probably have baptism. We're going to take our time and just let God have his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's so wonderful. One of the things that I wanted to ask you as a congregation to do, if you could please open your homes to those that come up, quite often they just stay in their vans or maybe stay around the church or something. They have to start very early to drive two and a half, three hours to get here for the service at 10:30. Then they want to stay for the evening service. So they have the whole afternoon and uh and then go into the evening service. I think we might even start the evening service a little bit early. I didn't say anything about that, but it wouldn't hurt. And started just a wee bit early. Uh, and then if you could have some of them over to your home, what I suggest is that you call Sister Bonnie and say, "We could have four over." If you have children, there are some of them that have children, but what I really am requesting that you do is do not visit throughout the afternoon. give them a bite of lunch and show them a bed where they can rest and and get some rest so they can be refreshed for the evening service and and be refreshed to drive home because then they have another three-hour trip home. So, I appreciate them coming. I appreciate it very very deeply and I think as a congregation and some of you young couples that just got married I tell you what as I I've said to in fact as one of the sisters one of the weddings I conducted uh sister told my wife today she said she remembers standing here and her and her husband to be as they were being united and I said to them you be given to hospitality open your home and be given to hospitality and God will bless you and they said that became a part of their life they said they have a small place, just small quarters, a small rented place, but their home is open. And they fed probably hundreds of people in that home that I know about. And I would suggest that you do that. Don't lift to yourself. That's this society. Don't lift to yourself. Open it up and have them sleeping in there and whatever more. &gt;&gt; And the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God will bless you for it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely will bless you for it. Uh, I have a special announcement here. A special evening. You want to listen to this real close. Those of you that it pertains to. A special evening for young wives and mothers with babies or children 12 years and under. Don't say mine was just 12 and just turned 13 last week. This is 12 and under and this will be on Tuesday, November the 9th. The time will be 700 p.m. It will be in the fellowship room. And uh if you are a young married woman without children as yet or if you are a mother with a baby or children 12 years and under, this meeting is for you. Mothers, bring your nursing babies, but arrange for someone to care for your toddlers and other children at home. And this announcement will be on the bulletin board, Tuesday, November the 9th. Brother Ernie called just before I came to church and we had a couple times to get through. And uh this week, this coming week starting Monday is what is called All Saints in the Catholic Church, a Catholic religion. It's called All Saints Day or All Saints Week. And they have some kind of festivities throughout that time. It's a big deal in nations that are largely Catholic. So the Philippines almost shuts down. This is the week that they chose to have a whole week of special meetings. And brother Michelle is leaving tomorrow morning because brother brother Tony, brother Ernie wanted to really give a a first class video, a report of what takes place in these mystery expos. This is really remarkable things that are happening in the Philippines. and they're expecting about 1,500 people on Monday, this coming Monday. Then they expect out of that will be about 250 ministers. He was telling me that uh quite a few ministers who have been uh to the mystery expose are and are wrestling with the message. They of course they haven't had a whole lot of instruction, but they're coming back for the second time because they want to hear more things. and uh and some of them from the islands. There's as you know the Philippines or maybe you don't know Philippines has about 7,000 islands and ministers are calling from the islands and so it's difficult for them to make their way but they're going to make their way and come during this week. And then on Tuesday and Wednesday they'll be having ministers meetings and on Thursday and Friday they're going to have a mystery expo right in Manila. And then uh Saturday and Sunday we'll be closing with special meetings. Uh so this is a whole week of meetings uh and different different types of meetings that are taking place and uh uh so we want to pray that the Holy Spirit will really move through these brothers and some of the senior pastors in Manila are are taking the uh the most of the responsibility and brother Ernie will be speaking as well. I would like to tell you also on Sunday you opened your hearts and an offering was given for uh brother and sister childers. I I want to let you know it was $4,445 and they just broke down and wept when when I I gave them the check. And so we want to thank you for that. And I felt you needed to know and they certainly have place for that. Uh those funds, they needed them very very badly. But thank you so much. Yesterday when we were with or day before yesterday when we were with brother Anatoli, I asked him uh because brother Makmood brought out his little computer and I brought mine out because he had some questions and so I was looking uh up some references and I said, "Do you have a computer?" He said, "No." I said, "Uh, would you like a computer?" He says, "It's the dream of my life." Uh, Brother Makmood said, he said, "But my computer has the Russian Bible in it. It has all the Russian messages, 260ome messages, all in Russian language. It's all here." And he said, "I have all the pictures of Brother Brandham. I have all the things loaded down." And I said, "Well, I just knew that you would want to do it." and we want to do it as a church. So, we have bought brother Anatoli a computer and he's going to go home with a notebook computer all loaded up. He leaves tomorrow and I think that that is uh something that you would want have wanted me to do. And so, how many computers do we have here in this church? Hold your hands up high. Look at that. And here's a minister with 250 people in his church and in his area and ministering to all kinds of other people and doesn't have that very valuable uh resource and technology. It was the only right thing. It would have been a sin for me to walk out of that house and leave him to go home empty-handed. I just felt smitten. I said, "No, this is so when you give, you must know that this is what happens on a pretty regular basis." &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that's why God has blessed the church here &gt;&gt; because we've just given. That's been a part of our whole part of our whole uh character. It's a It should be the character of the church. Should be the character of our assemblies, our our homes, our families. And if you give, I have a law right here, it shall be given &gt;&gt; to you again. &gt;&gt; Shaken down, &gt;&gt; pressed down, &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. That's good. All right. Uh, brother Ken Ken Ardal and and brother Vin are in Grenada right now. I don't know if brother Vin has left but they went together on Monday morning from Trinidad and there is materials that are coming in to build 15 of the believers homes. Now these aren't homes as I said earlier not like we have but 15 places of shelter and will be a home for them similar to what they had before the destruction came and probably a lot better. So I'd like you to remember praying for them. Uh I got a quite a lengthy email from brother Milco today who's in Slovenia. He's been there I think 12 days. He his uh his sister who lost her husband not too long ago. Oh, there's so many things to say. Uh brother Milo's uh family have been Catholic, you know, and uh his sister uh Maria, I believe her name is, and her husband's name was Eddie. and he passed away not very long ago. Well, he was a engineer on a train and his train ran into uh ran ran into Italy and we needed to get the messages into Yugoslavia when it was still very very tight. You couldn't get them in or get turned away at the border. So we asked him if he would, you know, take the if we could ship them into Italy and he'd pick them up there in Triesta and take them on his train back. Oh, he thought that was the greatest thing in the world if he could just smuggle in some books into the country. So he became our main smuggler for a few years. And uh he was just delighted. He just delighted that he could smuggle those books into the country. So now here, brother Milo was there with uh his wife, Milco's sister, and uh she had a kidney stone. He had to take her to the hospital. So he took her to the hospital and they in the hospital they got her in a room where there was I think three other women. Uh he said two of them were at least in their 70s. And so they they, you know, they were just visiting together uh on nothing special. And in walks the priest and soon as the priest walked in, one woman quickly put her hand to her face like that. So I guess so he couldn't really see who she was, but she wanted to give Milo a signal and she just opened her eyes big and rolled them, you know, around and oh boy, you know, here he is sort of thing. And uh uh and the priest saw her and and had a reaction. He just he just hustled right out of there and got right out of there. And she just starts saying, "He's the biggest crook in the world. This and that. I've had so many things happen." And so on and she just began to pour it all out. And of course then another woman got into the act with her and they were kind of one mind. So they went at it for about 45 minutes. and mil and brother Milco, he just sitting there listening. So he said finally he wanted to let them know not everything in the world was bad. So he started to bring to them the message and and if they'd be interested, he has some books in the Slovenian language out in his car. Yes, they would love to have those books. So he goes out, gets all the books he has and distributes them to these women. And soon as he looks to his sister, his sister's all disgusted and she's almost angry that he didn't give her some books all these years later. So he had to plead with these other ladies to please release a book or two and give it to his sister to appease her. And so here her husband years ago uh uh you know he smuggled all these books into the country and now his wife is desiring these books and and it just opened such a wonderful door. Brother Milco said please have the congregation remember me in prayer right now at this time and remember his sister. So we want to do that just as we're going to be turning to the word in a few moments. Uh I believe that I have covered everything that I need to cover. So God bless you. Let's stand to our feet and I'd like to sing more of you. More of you. We're going to come to the word and and uh tonight I would like to lay a foundation for Sunday morning. the Lord willing. More of you. I tell it all of you. of things that have my heart s and Lord hear my prayer. All of you once again. Lord hear my prayer. Lord, I know that this is the cry of every single person that is here and those of our internet congregation. God bless them. Bless those that are not able to be with us tonight. I pray in a special way that you will be present with us in Sunday's services. Oh Lord, you'll anoint the word, anoint the ministry. Oh God, be with our brother Thomas. is uh speaking in Saskatchewan. Oh God, our brother Murphy, Father, Brother Tony, Sister Rebecca, Brother Ernie, oh God, I pray that you'll bless them. Anoint each one of us, Father, according to your perfect will and what you purpose to do in each service. And I pray tonight, Lord, that you will just take in a very divine, sovereign way your word and touch us, Lord. Touch us with a divine touch &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint us, Lord. And Father, as I saw the eclipse tonight, couldn't help but pray. May the cross eclipse the speaker tonight. We want to see Christ and him crucified and the preaching which is of the cross, which is the power of God. Anoint us, we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I'm reading out of uh Ephesians the 2 chapter and we'll start with verse one. And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others. But God who is rich in mercy. For this great love wherewith he hath loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved. And hath raised us up together and made us sit in sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship. If you would please uh look at this 10th verse. We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who were called uncircumcision, by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh, made by hands, that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Uh if you keep your Bible just opened, I'm looking at verse 12. that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. Scripture uses a a strange word here that we don't see too often in the Bible, that you are aliens. uh aliens from the and and strangers, but you are aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. An alien is one uh we're familiar with it, but say it's one that's from another country, a foreigner. We were foreign to the Commonwealth of Israel. It refers also to difference of birth. If you're a foreigner, you have a different birth. And so, we were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel because we didn't have the right birth. &gt;&gt; We were born in the world, but we weren't born again. &gt;&gt; So, we were foreigners to the and aliens to the commonwealth of Israel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we were one estranged or excluded from We were excluded from the commonwealth of Israel. Another uh another adjective is we were disconnected. &gt;&gt; We were disconnected from it. There was no connection. &gt;&gt; It took Calvary to connect us. &gt;&gt; We were disconnected from the commonwealth. We were hostile. We were opposed &gt;&gt; from the commonwealth, from that which was holy. We didn't have any rapport with that which was clean, that which was holy, till the Holy Spirit began to brood over us. We went our own way, &gt;&gt; desiring our own things and doing our own things. And lastly, but not least, we were not only opposed, but we were contrary. Paul is saying we were aliens, foreigners, disconnected from another birth by a wrong birth and we were disassociated. We were made so through our parents, Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "In works is faith expressed." And I I have some of these prepared to show you on the screen, but Lord willing, I will do it on on Sunday. I already have some of it prepared because it's it's nice when you see it visually and can see in the quote what is emphasized to myself. So it was be emphasized to you. But he says here in works of faith expressed he said like my little eagle the little eagle story that he tells. He said he knew when he heard that scream of that mother eagle he said there's a lot of difference between that and the cluck of a hen. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, a lot of times all we knew is that the clock didn't mean a whole lot to us, &gt;&gt; but we hadn't heard the scream yet. &gt;&gt; We only heard the clock and we heard the clock and it didn't sound right and the food wasn't quite right and we weren't satisfied and and and and yet we just kind of went in our own way, but we we didn't feel fully connected with that and we weren't connected with with eternal life. He said, "But see because he was an eagle from the egg. He was right eagle from the egg. He wasn't made an eagle eagle right then." &gt;&gt; See, he always was an eagle. &gt;&gt; You weren't made a Christian. And then he goes on to say, "And a Christian always was." &gt;&gt; I like that. A Christian always was. You didn't know it till God brooded upon you and brought you to the realization. A Christian always was. And that's the reason the divorce when you're divorced because you were trapped into it. See, we were divorced from God. I want to I want to enlarge on that. We were divorced by our parents who who had absolute fellowship and complete communion with God through them because they were separated from God. They became divorced from God. That's the terminology brother Brandham's using here. And because we were trapped into it by that natural birth, we we were born in the world, divorced from God, disconnected from him. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. And we were trapped into it. He said, "By your first parent, Adam and Eve." You know, Brother Brandham uses the term parent singular quite often when he refers to Adam and Eve because the Bible does exactly the same thing. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible uses that same thing. Do you have your Bible with you? Just turn with me to uh Genesis the 5th chapter. Many of you are familiar with this and some are not. And I just want to do it because it's a bit of a study. Genesis 5 and1. This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him. Now let's read together the second verse. Male and female created he them. Stop. Plural them. Plural. We'll carry on. and blessed them and called their plural name Adam singular. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the day when they plural were created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham states it that way. &gt;&gt; Their your parent Adam and Eve &gt;&gt; singular. And he says you were first by your first parent Adam and Eve. He said you be you become a sinner by nature. You didn't want to be but now you heard the gospel and faith cometh by hearing. Revelation comes by hearing. And there's a little something inside of you. Paul says in Romans, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so sin passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Brother Brandham says the first nature was to love the world. And thus, if the love for the world is still in us, I'm saying this now. If the love for the world is still in us, we have never been born of the spirit of God. Because the spirit of God can't love the world. &gt;&gt; They're opposed one to the other. &gt;&gt; So that's why the scripture says if we love the world, the love of the father, love of the father, not love for the father, but the love of the father is not in us. Right? &gt;&gt; And so Paul is saying, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world because Adam took the responsibility for his wife Eve." And I want to come into that now in the invisible union. Brother Brandham says, "For your first na your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth." &gt;&gt; Your first husband. That's why you had to have a divorce &gt;&gt; from him. &gt;&gt; Your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth. Natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world. Is that right? Your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of. I need to establish this and need to really nail it down. You're you're a part of nature. &gt;&gt; You believe that and that's your natural thing. That's the reason you have to be born again. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; and you couldn't be born again till your first husband died. And the only way he could die, the only way that nature could die was Christ took it to the cross and it died. and you were separated by the death of his body, so you could be married again to another, even to him, Paul said, who raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not united to the image that the denominational in the church world has of a Christ that walked here 2,000 years ago, even though it's the same Christ, but yet it's not exactly the same Christ because he will never come and suffer again in that kind of a body. So the one that the people have in their im image, the image that they have in their mind is not is not the one that is raised from the dead because he who raised from the dead was never seen by them. He showed himself alive after his passion to above 500 brethren, Paul said. So they were the ones who saw him. They were the ones who gave testimony to the resurrection. And those who saw him on the shores of Galilee didn't believe he was raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; But the apostles and the disciples and those that were with him, they believed. And those that believed in their preaching, they believed that he was raised from the dead. And the gospel, the gospel of the book of Acts, the whole church was born on the message that he's raised from the dead. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the church was came into into its its existence on the message of the resurrection. And it goes out in this last stage on the message of the resurrection. And that is why a prophet had to come and say he is raised from history &gt;&gt; because they had him buried, &gt;&gt; buried in history, buried in tradition. And he needed to prove I'll prove to you tonight. He's raised from history. He's raised from your dead creeds and and you can't keep him buried any longer. And he brought him forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so you were united by your nature. Your nature, your old nature was your first husband. He said, "Now you have to be born again. You have to separate. You have to die to that first husband. You can't live with it. You just can't say, "Well, I'll divorce him and hang him up here till the occasion." No, sir. No writing of divorcement. He dies. See, the nature of the world has to die. Every speck of them has to die. You have to be reunited again with another nature. Notice what he said. He didn't say you have to be united again with another nature. He said you have to be reunited again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. His wording is absolutely supreme. It's just superb. You have to be reunited, which means you were united at one time and you have to be reconnected. &gt;&gt; Amen. You always were a Christian. &gt;&gt; You just experienced a disconnection. Now you have to be reconnected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Separated from the old man. He has to die. He has to rot. and you're reunited &gt;&gt; to the nature that you always were intended to have. &gt;&gt; I'll be showing you this slide on Sunday, Lord willing. Out of the message oneness, he says the word oneness means to be one with oneness, united. And now he said this is quite a subject. It's going to be quite a subject tonight even just as we start. It's quite a subject and it deserves a lot more attention than I'm able to give it and more than most any person on earth could be able to give it. But I would like to express to you my opinion of it and with what God will give us. Now he said now in its teaching it in it is teaching doctrine. I want to establish that oneness. This this being unified with God. Brother Brandham said that is teaching doctrine. It's not just a little preaching service. Wasn't his message on oneness was not just an evangelism meeting. &gt;&gt; This was teaching doctrine. &gt;&gt; This is the doctrine that you as a church are founded on. &gt;&gt; You have to be one with God. It's doctrine. And to the brethren who may hear this tape, I trust that you will not be an offense. That it will not be an offense, but it will be to cause you to take this very considerably. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm only emphasizing this to you because you're believers, but he was stressing this particular doctrine, and he said, "Take it under consideration." He said, "And that you would study it prayerfully and carefully and weigh it out in the balance of God's word and see whether it be of God or not." &gt;&gt; Now he goes on in the message and I want this for a complete foundation. The first man and I spoke of our parent. See we we are where we are this evening because of our first parents. And the fact is that we are in a physical condition outside of the change of the body which is promised to us a as a rapture promise. A change of this body. We shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed. But outside of that we are in a body a mortal frame that is quickly vanishing. &gt;&gt; What is man? It what is this life? It's even as a vapor that appearth for a little while and then it vanishes. See, we're in that frame. The very fact that we're sitting here tonight in this mortal existence is a testimony that we've been disconnected from something &gt;&gt; and and we are to be associated or to be connected with something that is eternal. the very fact you may wonder about, you know, uh, eternal life or Satan may even come and try and make you question on on your spiritual, uh, welfare and whatever more and he likes to do that because he is a author of doubt &gt;&gt; and he'd like to have you doubt that. But let it be known to you the very fact that you're living in a body that's getting aging day by day. You're living in a mortal life. That if time shall go on, you're you're going to pass off the scene down here. That is evidence. &gt;&gt; That is evidence that that we are to be united with with another life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God certainly who made a tree to last for may some of these trees last for centuries &gt;&gt; and the epitome of his creation last 70 years, 80 years. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; I can't believe that. &gt;&gt; I can't believe that that man in the image of God, a tree lives longer, a turtle lives 300 years, a peacock lives for or some uh not a peacock but uh parrot live for decades &gt;&gt; and here we are masters of the whole thing and we drop over at 49 and 50 and on and on 60 years old &gt;&gt; something's not right &gt;&gt; that's evidence that there's another connection &gt;&gt; so now he said the first man and first woman in in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God now here I want if you can Remember this and I will be showing this to you also in slide two on Sunday. They were in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness. I can tell you I know of one man &gt;&gt; in this generation &gt;&gt; that God could come down at any time &gt;&gt; and talk to him lip to earph this generation &gt;&gt; and and and he says right here that is perfect oneness. Adam and Eve had that perfect oneness that was experienced. This message came to give us this to unite us &gt;&gt; in this. This didn't come to give us a a better grade &gt;&gt; of of religion. &gt;&gt; Didn't come to give us just a different way to worship or you sisters a different way to dress or the men a different way to act and to speak and whatever more. The message didn't come just to give us uh church doctrine. &gt;&gt; Didn't come for that. Just didn't come to give us a new mission. The message came and God is bringing forth one thing. The the God's purpose and his striving is to bring man back to what he lost into oneness with him. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's such a blessed place. &gt;&gt; It's such a blessed place for us. And he says he desired to talk. He came at any time he desired to talk lipto ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness. God and his creation. God speaking lipto ear with Adam and Eve. And they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God. &gt;&gt; God and his family was one. Quote three, slide three. I'll show you. Any man in his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family, is one with another, any family. And if there's something in that in the family that moves them apart, then it's not right. The family's broken somewhere. They should all be one. Father and mother, mother with father, children with parent, parent with children, all in agreement. And when you see that, you see one lovely picture. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He says that's God's purpose. You just hang on. I'll preach in a few moments. And his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family, earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't only that he could come and speak lip to ear with them, but that his nature was actually in them. &gt;&gt; That's why the baptism of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential &gt;&gt; because a person takes on the very nature of God. So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they became all one. He said, "Isn't that a beautiful picture? God in his family." Now I'm going slowly over these things because brother Brandham said as he was uh just entering into the subject, he said, "This deserves a lot more attention than I can give it." That's right. &gt;&gt; And so when you read and take these statements because he was very concise, very definitive in his in his speaking as he approaches this subject. And he said it needs it takes a lot more deserves a lot more attention than he could give it. And I can tell you this evening, it deserves a lot more attention than we're able to give it. Can you say amen? And so as we say these things and as we read these things, I want you to absorb them as much as possible. Then we will rehearse them again on Sunday morning and take it from perhaps a little bit further, a little deeper. &gt;&gt; He said, "God and his family, Father overall, supreme, no death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing, just joy unspeakable, never to be sick, never to have a heartache, just one with God." Oh, what a picture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one. &gt;&gt; Now the first thing that Satan offered Eve was something better. You know, better is not always best. It might be better, but it doesn't mean it's better. And and the offer of something better because it is within our human structure to desire to improve ourselves, to better our position, to to increase. That's part of it. We don't sew a we don't sew seeds in the garden or a farmer doesn't sew seeds in the field and he he sews 100 bushels. He doesn't want 100 bushels back. That's futility. &gt;&gt; We grow a garden and God believes in increase. He believes in multiplication. He swn the earth and he plans to reap a harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's just within us. We we we don't go into a house or even rent a little room or apartment or own a home or buy a home or whatever more. It's just not in us to go from one thing to a worse thing and a worse thing and a worse thing unless you know it just happens that way and and sometimes it is that way. But when you come back, you know, I I read my I read my grandfather's uh immigration documents when he came in 1901 on a on a ship from uh he was Austrian uh born but Ukraine in in language and so on. So he had a homestead in Saskatchewan and uh he had to report year by year because there's a homestead and as you improved it they call it improving proving up the land. So he he he he he would report on he cleared, you know, two acres and he had a pig and a cow and then the next year he had five acres and he had three pigs and four cows and two horses the next year. But it always was increasing a little bit, you know, &gt;&gt; that's the way it was supposed to go. And of course when I saw him I was just a boy. I I I didn't have much of rapport with him. He I don't know whether he could speak much English or not. But anyway, uh we never had much conversation. And was he tight? Oh, was he tight? I remember getting a nickel from him once. I thought he was going to have a heart attack giving me a nickel. So when I feel a little bit like Scrooge, I know where it come from. It's in the jeans someplace. That's the way we're made. We like to increase just a wee bit from time to time, but better is not always the best. On the message uh that day at Calvary, Brother Bram says when Lucifer was given the preeminences to make his choice, he wanted something better than God. Can you imagine? Now, that's in his that is just a part of his perverted nature. You might ask, where'd he come from? I don't know. There's all kinds of questions about that that perhaps I can't answer. But he says he wanted something better than God had. And that started the trouble. &gt;&gt; Brother uh was preaching here the other day from Ghana. Brother Aubrey Hunt. He was talking about Ahab and Nabboth and how Ahab lusted after and desired Nabboth's garden or his vineyard. And notice what he said. And brother Brandham says Ahab was the most wicked king that Israel had. And this is what he said. And Ahab said to Nabboth, "Give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near my house. And I will give thee for a And I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it. I'm going to give you a better one than this one. When Satan approached through the serpent Eve, he offered her something that in her eyes was better. you'll be like God. And this enticement of something better is a very subtle thing. Sometimes it's a better job. Sometimes it's a better higher education. Sometimes it's a bigger and a more beautiful church. Sometimes it's a better class of people. Sometimes it's just something that's more refined, something that's better. But it's not always good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to get that point. And when he came and offered her, it says he said in message one, let's once again, Eve was united until she broke one word or doubted one word being true and that separated her. Now I'm going to come to a specific part of this message. And here here here we see uh Satan's design by offering her something better. He literally tore her away. Tore away from Adam's headship. &gt;&gt; This was not listen to me close now. This was not some little clean surgical slice that separated them. This was a brutal act &gt;&gt; and ripped her away &gt;&gt; from the very headship of her husband and began to dismember that family. And then the prophet said that Adam he knew whatever he knew he knew that and brother Vand said she should have been burned with a serpent. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. should have suffered the consequence because he's going to be burned. &gt;&gt; But Adam went in and as a part of Christ, he retrieved her quickly. He he took her to himself quickly. Do you remember me speaking about that sometime? He took her her to himself quickly. And exactly what he did, she had already been polluted, contaminated with the seed of the serpent because that was the act. And Adam took and swed his seed into her. He didn't just embrace her. He took and swed his seed into her. And he knew that God could not destroy her &gt;&gt; because his life was in her. &gt;&gt; The serpent gave her Cain and he gave her Abel. &gt;&gt; And God could not destroy his own life. &gt;&gt; He couldn't take her life. It's as clear as can be. &gt;&gt; Just nothing could be clearer than that. And preserved her. But he had to do it. He had to do it to act out the part of Christ. &gt;&gt; And in and and in so doing, in saving her, he separated himself from God. &gt;&gt; And that was precisely the part of Christ. Because when Christ came, when he finally identified himself with us &gt;&gt; in flesh &gt;&gt; as a sinner, &gt;&gt; even though he'd never sinned, he became sin &gt;&gt; for us. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, God turned his face from him and he had to cry out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? &gt;&gt; You have left me." We become disconnected. &gt;&gt; You have forsaken me. &gt;&gt; I'll give you the words later on. And and Adam was playing out exactly the same part that Christ was and it was exactly the same purpose. It was exactly the same objective. Christ went there and went through that entire exercise. It wasn't some uh clean surgical cut. This prophet says he was he he tore the soul out of him. &gt;&gt; Wish we could see it tonight. I wish we could see it. I wish I was here on the platform and you could hear the very voice of Christ and see that body riven to the ribs with the stripes on his back and see him mutilated and see the cruel spit hanging on his face and down his beard and seeing his beard and his hairs plucked out and seeing that kind of suffering. It was not a neat little surgical slice. &gt;&gt; It tore the soul out of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a an incredible act that was taking place on our behalf to take your sin and my sin. And he had to cry out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why have you separated yourself?" Cuz God couldn't look on it any longer. He took the full penalty of your judgment, my judgment. I say, "Praise be to God and thank you, Lord Jesus." He had to do it. Adam took her quickly to himself. Christ took us quickly to himself. And if he had not, God would have destroyed us. In the message cruelty of sin, he says, "So Adam taken Eve as his wife." And then when sin came in, he said, "I have my idea of that of what that was. I don't express it out in the church unless I have having a little class uh of some sort of what the sin was in the beginning. But anyhow, when it did, it separated them from the fellowship of God. that first family. He said, "Uh, Eve should have been burned with that serpent and their awful deed, but Adam intervened, taking her to himself so that she was saved." &gt;&gt; He took her to himself and she was saved. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And in so doing, she was tore from him and he took her quickly and he was tore from God and lost fellowship and went into a world of darkness and Jesus Christ taking our sin. Now when he said, "My God, my God, why thou forsaken me?" That is a uh he was speaking actually a scripture out of Psalms 22:1. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me? And from the from the words of my roaring, words of my roaring. The roaring is my distress cry. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me and from the words of my distress cry? I'm crying in my distress and you don't hear me. It wasn't a neat. It was it was a tearing &gt;&gt; that was taking place. And that is in the Hebrew in the Hebrew to leave to depart. You've departed from me. You've left me. My God, my God. You've abandoned me. You've deserted me. That is what the word is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think of it. God could not look on his own son in the judgment that he placed upon upon our sins. In Matthew when Jesus about the ninth hour didn't say he whispered, didn't say he spoke. I'm speaking fairly clearly. But the scripture says, "And he cried with a loud voice, Eli, Eli, &gt;&gt; Lamus, back tonight. Why hast thou forsaken me?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I love and I never tire and I trust you never tire of me ever quoting &gt;&gt; these these words. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, "God confirmed the covenant with Abraham." Abraham said, "What'll you do? What'll you do for me? I only have this Eleazar. I don't have an heir. I don't have a son." In other words, there's no continuity of life here. &gt;&gt; I don't have a son. Nothing has come from my loins. Nothing is bone on my bone and flesh of my flesh. nothing is one with me. What will you give me that I can have a confirmation? And he told him to take the animals, take a heer, take these three animals and take a turtle but a turtle dove and uh and and these two birds. He says, "And when God confirmed the covenant with Abraham, did you notice what he did? He killed those animals and put the doves and so forth in there and there made a covenant. He did not take he he he did not take the birds apart. He did not dissect them. And brother Brandham says because they represented healing. &gt;&gt; There had to be something that was h an entire piece, something that was not separated because they represented healing. And the others now they were taken apart. They were cut in pieces. And he talks about in the orient in the time of Abraham when they when they made a covenant they and many of you you've heard this uh many times but I want you to hear it again in the context of this service. And they would cut the beast, slay the beast, kill it like Abraham did, and divided the ram and so forth and the she goat and whatever he divided there these animals and laid them apart. And then they would write a covenant on a piece of paper or he said would on a skin on a hide on a lambkin. They would write this covenant and make a vow to one another in a in Abraham's in Abraham and his seed. It's another message. He said it was it was in them days that the skin which they wrote on the skin now was tore apart. &gt;&gt; I wish I could demonstrate that for you. And one man took one piece and the other took the other piece. And then when this covenant was brought to its fullness, when this covenant was brought to its fullness, both those pieces came back together again. &gt;&gt; And he made it so nicely when he said, "And every every word, every letter had to fit with the next one." Word upon word and line upon line, it couldn't and nothing else. He said, you could not impersonate it with anything else. There isn't any Bible school over there that could make that piece of skin. There was no other place. There was no wise theologians or astrologers or astronomers or scientists. Nobody could make another piece of hide say, "Oh, we've developed a great we we've got a uh we can make that skin look just exactly like that and we can write words on it." But when they would bring them, they wouldn't fit. &gt;&gt; That's why they can have 900 denominations. They can have 1,500 or as they have today 3,000 and their words won't fit with the true hide, the true skin. &gt;&gt; And what we're talking about is oneness, unity. And this one over here, it can't fit. You can never get to a oneness. That is why my brother, my sister, you can have a church in every corner. You can have a church in every block in the city. But only thus sayeth the Lord will fit with the original covenant. That's why that's why he stresses and in this message oneness he stresses with such emphasis and such sternness and he cries it out and screams it out. Every word, every word. Not one word can miss. You got to live by every word. Every word. Every word. And the reason he's saying is every word is because you can't have oneness with unless there's every word there. &gt;&gt; It has to fit. the message Israel in Egypt. You should get it. You should print this out for yourself to do your good. You ought to read it on a regular basis. And God showed Abraham because Abraham was saying, "What are you going to give me that I'll have a confirmation that I'm going to have a son?" Strange thing. And God said, "Take these animals and cut them up." You wouldn't think that that would have any any reference to his question. What are you going to do that I'm going to have a son? How will I know I'm going to have a son? Take these animals and divide them up and put the birds and don't divide them up. And he stands, he sits there amongst them and takes a switch perhaps and keeps the birds from coming on them and eating and partaking off of them. And a horror of darkness comes down. Death. And in the midst of it was a little light. &gt;&gt; And that light was moving through the pieces. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, with the darkness there was a light. What was God? God was saying through this entire ceremony, by this you'll know that you're going to be one. You're going to have a son come out of your own body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we see the darkness, when we see the sun hiding its face, when we hear the see that the earth, we have the rest of we have the record and the testimony and the earth belched and the rocks quake and the earthquake struck and and people cried out in fear and a man is crying out, Eli, Eli, Lamas back tonight, why hast thou forsaken me? and he into thy hands I commit my spirit. He hung his head and gave up the ghost. He was torn to pieces so that it would be a covenant that there was a people that would be able to come back together again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you look back to that, that is a testimony. That is evidence that that the body you're going to be separated from, it's not the end of the road. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been united back with God through the supreme sacrifice. &gt;&gt; He says, "And God showed Abraham," listen to this language. It is absolutely eloquent. God showed Abraham what he was going to do. that through the seed of Isaac, he would bring forth his only begotten son, Christ, and was slain yonder between heavens and earth. When the sun went down in the blackness over the earth, and there he tore him apart, God pulled his soul out of him, and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth. I love that phrase. He pulled his soul out of him. This was not some delicate operation. This was not some painless thing. He tore the soul out of him. God, the creator who knows how to do things, tore the soul out of him and wrote &gt;&gt; a covenant &gt;&gt; with the families of the earth. Oh, I'm glad I have got that covenant. I got that evidence of that covenant. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when the that precious unadulterated blood of Almighty God dripping from Emanuel's veins, he tore that soul out of him and he said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And his face full of mockery spit. A crown of cruel mockery pulled down over his brow, his nails drove with Roman spikes, his back riven until his ribs showed through. swinging on the cross, screaming, dying a sinner's death, the sin of the world upon him, and there God rivened his sides, tore his soul out of him, when he said, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit." And he dropped his head, and the earth shook and belched out its rocks. And there he is. There's God's covenant, the fulfilling of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so it was tore and the body the body went to the tomb but the spirit left him and it was the spirit. Oh I want to cut on to that on Sunday because he says that when Eve was taken out of Adam she was a byproduct something that was after the in the original creation. But when God made Eve, he took the same spirit, not another spirit, but the same spirit out of Adam, just the feminist part. It was a part of the same spirit and put it into her. And on the day of Pentecost, the pieces were coming back together again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is why a prophet had to come in this generation to give the original word. Thus sayaith the lord because the spirit can only come to the word. &gt;&gt; It can't come to what you think I think you think somebody else thinks. Some woman, some man, some church, some priest, some pope, some prespter, smart people. We all have our idea. Let me tell you. And not to be disgraceful or not to be disrespectful. Your idea means absolutely nothing to God. God doesn't come to an idea. God doesn't come to some reasoning. God comes to his word. &gt;&gt; Only his word. &gt;&gt; And when the two come together, you have unity once again, &gt;&gt; brought together. &gt;&gt; It's a oneness. That's oneness. And when oneness comes, that's when harmony &gt;&gt; begins. &gt;&gt; That's when fellowship takes place. Mid rendering rocks and darkening skies. This poem he quotes, "My savior bowed his head and died. The opening veil revealed the way to heaven's joys and endless day." I said to you as a congregation, young people, old people, relatives, whoever you are, friends, dear ones, you can have this world if you wish, but I'm going to the next one. By his grace, I want the next one. This one's full of trouble. This one's full of darkness and chaos and sin, and I want nothing to do with it. I want to make a mark while we're here and get out of here and go out of here in a blaze of victory. &gt;&gt; Don't count on staying here. You won't last here very long anyway. &gt;&gt; He says, "We know that the word death means separation. I'm only going to be another few minutes and I'm going to close. So I want to start on a I want to close on a certain note. Death means separation. You know, we've become a callous people. That's not a negative thing against you. It's due to the civilization and the society that we're in. We become we become callous. We've had to &gt;&gt; to kind of protect ourselves. &gt;&gt; This is a harsh environment. &gt;&gt; Separations are not painless experiences. &gt;&gt; Separations can have horrific consequences. Absolutely horrific. I began to think of just some of them. And perhaps I have not covered near all of them. I thought of war. And when we were on this trip, every place we went to, they said, "Oh, this kingdom, this civilization, these armies and the Romans and the Ottoman Empire and the Byzantine and the Inquisition that took place and Spain and this took place and these armies went this way and those armies went that way and they slaughtered the people and burned the cities and and we were just faced with war. War. We stood on the ground knowing that the the the ground was soaked with blood &gt;&gt; of men, women, families, children, babies, and the whole works. &gt;&gt; You read it even in the scriptures. I tell you, the earth has grown. &gt;&gt; And I thought of the war. This nation of Canada when it only had about 15 million during the Second World War as a population, we committed more of our young men, &gt;&gt; Amen. to fighting men than any nation that was in the Second World War per capita. &gt;&gt; As per capita, &gt;&gt; over 1 million of our boys &gt;&gt; were in the war, Second World War. And many of them are still over there &gt;&gt; at 18 and 19 and 20 years old and Australian and British and American and whatever more. our war and we can say our boys gave their lives. That's only a small part of it. Mothers went without their sons. They were torn from the family. And even to this day comes the news comes a certain kind of a letter comes a a diplomat from from the White House or from the military executive to say, "Sorry, your son was a valiant young man. and your daughter was a wonderful young lady and gave her life and service. Tell you what, that's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; Now it's the next year. It's the next Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; It's the next Christmas and the chair is empty &gt;&gt; and the heart is torn and the heart bleeds. And in the evening, in the nighttime, uh they're waiting for the sound that would be normal to that young person and the tears flow down the faces. I talked to a man here not long ago. In fact, it was just a few weeks ago. Met him just as a we were total strangers and we found out we had an acquaintance, a mutual acquaintance. And he said to me, he said, "Uh oh, I he was telling me something about his business." He said, "That was when that was when when my my son was still with me." He said, "My son was killed." And I said, "I'm very sorry to hear that." He said, "It was hard." He said, "He was absolute trouble-free young man. Worked with me in my business." He was 27. And he said it was just kind of a needless thing. He was riding a dirt bike, but he said he was not he was not an adventurist. He wasn't he wasn't that kind of a person. and he had the best equipment. Had on the best suit and the best helmet that money can buy. He just went over a little bump and and the bike slid out from under him and the back wheel came around tapped him on the head. And he said even though he had the best helmet on that you can, his brain swelled, he said, and we flew him into Royal Colombian, but in two days he was gone. He said, 'You know, everybody tried to say something, the minister, whoever they were, and I told him, I'm a pastor. Told him the church, Cloverdale Bible Way. He said, you know, ministers and friends and family, everybody tries to say something, but they don't know what to say. I said, "No, that's right. There isn't really anything you can say." He said, "Uh, I don't go to church as much as I should." He said, "Uh, when I go to church, it reminds me of my son." He said, "I'll lay home on a on a Sunday afternoon, I'll just be laying on my sofa, and for no reason at all," he says, "Tears just start streaming out of my eyes." He said, "It just comes over me with with waves. It's hard to forget." I said, "How long ago was it?" He said, "Seven years." So I began to speak to him about this me message and then I began to speak to him directly brother Brown's ministry and I was able to tell him of the a part of my testimony and seeing the girl healed blind and I just took him a church age book and one of the girls CDs so he could listen to the music. He said, "The most comfort I got was a man who was a total stranger walked into my office one day. He walked over to me and he reached out his hand and took my hand and shook it." He said, "I know what you're going through. I lost a son, too." Says he walked out. I've never seen him again. He says, "And such a peace went over me." He said, "And I got more peace from that man's visit than any person that spoke to me." And he's totally mystified by it. He doesn't know who he was. Never saw him again. And that was all there was to it. Said, "I I lost a son, too. I I'm trusting for I went and saw him again. I'm trusting for an open door. He was very moved when he heard about the ministry of today. These experiences are not pleasant. They're not easy. Listen to me close. I won't be much longer. Another five minutes. Sickness. Now, some of this is won't mean a whole lot to you, but sickness. Only the person that was robust and had their health and got up in the morning and had their breakfast and scooted off to work and went through the traffic and handled the things they knew how to conduct their business and affairs and so on and so forth and suddenly they're smitten and health is tore from them. It's not a nice little cut. &gt;&gt; It's not just a nice little thing that happens. It's a sudden jarring. It's an awakening. This can't happen. How does this happen? I'm perfectly healthy person. How does this happen? But it happens every day. And we we we you know, we get accustomed to it. But what I'm saying is that something is tore from that person. It's not just gently taken, but just tore away from them. I was talking to Dr. Forester not long before he passed away and I was taking a certain need to him or a certain person I should say and uh I said have you encountered this kind of thing before where a person just goes down so quickly so suddenly loses weight losses interest in life everything just just degenerates. Oh yes. No. He said this happens. There's an emotional upheaval and a shock to the system. He said I usually encountered in my practice when a husband has lost a wife or a wife have lost a husband. He says and in two weeks they just go down to skin and bones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said it's such an effect upon them. You see, it wasn't just a nice little. Now, with some folks, we become callous. And there are people today, they're so fed up of their partners, and they they'd be almost happy if they The sooner you get out of my life, the better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, that's the way so many in this day are. And we we think about that. &gt;&gt; But that's this callous generation. The kind of home and the kind of family that God is talking about is one where that would be an excruciating painful &gt;&gt; tearing. &gt;&gt; I think of David uh when Abselum did what he tried to do. &gt;&gt; Tried to take the throne. tried to dethrone his own father and all the evil and get the whole kingdom and try to take it away Judas style and then finally when he's slain and his life is gone from them David expressed the heart of a real father Abselum Abselum my son Abselum that's not maybe a 21st century feeling or re response, but that was the response of a real father. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what he did, he was still my son. &gt;&gt; I think what alcohol does, oh, to us it doesn't hardly mean a thing. We hear it all the time. Oh, he's just a drunk. He's an alcoholic. He's a this. He's a that. But if we could only write a story of what it was uh of what the whole background was, what the scene is in behind. &gt;&gt; Some of you have had parents or some of you have had relatives that have been alcoholic. And I'll tell you what, that not the person, nothing against the person. Some of them are just trapped into it. And that demon, and it is a demon &gt;&gt; of alcohol tries to take them. and I've seen them and I've labored with them and I've worked with them and I've prayed with them and and I've seen them delivered &gt;&gt; and thank God &gt;&gt; for everyone that's been delivered. There's some right in this congregation been absolutely delivered from alcohol and it's a demon and the word was was ministered to the individual and they were prayed for and they were set free but that devil robs them and tears them away from their children &gt;&gt; and the and and from their family and maybe from their wife or the wife from the husband and whatever more. Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, I'm not preaching for my health tonight. I'm preaching to tell you this is the truth of God's word. That's a brutal that's a brutal enemy. &gt;&gt; And God, how glorious it would be if that one was reunited under the banner of the gospel. &gt;&gt; My sister and I had a father that drank. They made their own home brew. Drank till he was unconscious. I never knew him as a drunk. I only knew him as a believer. Oh, how I thank God for the power of this word. &gt;&gt; I'm sure our brother Ed Nicaruk won't mind me saying out of his sadness and out of his sorrow and out of his grief, he decided to drown himself in alcohol. Because of the loss of his wife by death, I'm using this for the glory of God, brother Ed, Sister Marie, that you might allow me this. And he used to he used to drown himself with the other fellows who drank on the weekend after because he's a construction worker and they would decide where they're going to be. He got interested in Sister Marie and came to church and I thought it might disturb Sister Marie. So I did everything I could in my power to sever that whole relationship. So he came to a Wednesday night service and on that Wednesday night I played a tape and after the service was over I went and shook hands with him outside and said, "What did you think of that?" He said, "My wife had a prophet, but it was nothing like this prophet." Believer's wife was Mormon if I'm not mistaken. If I'm doing something wrong, Brother Ed, you can you must forgive me. But he said it was nothing like this prophet. And he he was given a bag of tapes. I believe Darren, was it you that gave him some tapes? Someone else? No, his brother Jim Bner gave him some tapes. And the boys had decided on the weekend they'd go down to Blaine and drink. And that's where they'd spend the weekend. He said he'd get into an absolute stuper. They hardly know one day from the next. And while he's driving down to the border, which is only six miles. While he's on his way to the border, he thinks about these tapes. He doesn't know anything about this message. He knows nothing about the prophet of God. He reaches in, takes a tape. It's a tape called the token. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God speaking of the token Jesus Christ, the token lamb of God. And he puts that he puts that message in there. He starts listening to a voice he knows nothing about a ministry he knows nothing about and he's in a certain situation and before he reaches the border he's an absolute converted soul &gt;&gt; and his alcoholism left him completely before that time what did it sent his word and healed him and restored him back again and it left him brother Ed Nicaruk's been a blessing here in the church and a wonderful husband to Sister Marie and their family. What is it? It's the power of the word. Is there power in this message? Absolutely. But that would have tore away all the happiness, all the joy, all the respect, everything else. I saw it amongst the native Indian people. I tell you, talk about brutal demon that is. I had men sitting in the congregation with the glory of God shining on their face that not very long ago were crawling out in front of the same house in the mud on their hands and knees in a stuper. They didn't even know who their not their name was. One of them, his name was brother Fred something uh and got on the ferry, black ball ferry going from Victoria over to Port Angeles. He was so drunk he didn't even know when they arrived in Port Angeles he's crawling around on there and just a a laughing stalk to the people but in his soul he craved for a reality and he found God one day and was was reunited was separated from that enemy and reunited with Christ. Is this thing real? We're not here just on a Wednesday night. I'm saying this tearing this and he tore the soul out of Christ. so that we wouldn't have to experience this thing anymore. &gt;&gt; I say praise be to his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We mentioned sickness a moment ago. I'm just five minutes over, but just give me a couple minutes. I want to close this part. Now, some of you I you don't quote this very often. You say, "Oh, God pulled this card and that was it." And that was, Brother Brand, we use this quite a few times, a premature death. &gt;&gt; And faith is a substance. He says, "How this demon who's come to send him to a premature grave, come out of him." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the vibration has ceased." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh friends, &gt;&gt; I I don't care what what day of the week this is. This has nothing to do with days of the week where we're talking about a gospel of that's alive, a gospel of power. &gt;&gt; We're not here wasting our time, wasting our breath. This God is real and we're talking about this isn't religion. &gt;&gt; This is reality. He said, "Lord, Satan's determined to send this woman to a premature grave, but Lord, I come tonight in the name of your son, Jesus Christ. Satan, turn the woman loose." &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke thee in future home. Future home is 64. He says, "There are many that are sick and needy in the land, and they haven't completed their journey. and our great enemy, not only our enemy, but your enemy, he's speaking in prayer, has come to beset them and to stop their life and to send them to a premature grave. And we're asking for them today that you and your mercy and grace, Lord, will extend their days to the allotted time. And there's people in this assembly that the same devil trying to tear out of our assembly, trying to tear out of the arms of their loved ones. And we rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to lay hands on them even. We send a word, this word of life. &gt;&gt; What about our sister Marge Miller? In the name of Jesus, let this demon of cancer leave her. &gt;&gt; Let her be set free. The habit that is held and holds people back. That demon of condemnation and oppression. In the name of Jesus, we rebuke him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let them go free. Satan trying to tear you out of fellowship and tear you out of communion and tear you out of what is what is supposed to be rightfully yours. &gt;&gt; There's people we have to pray for tonight in the name of Jesus. May that demon trying to afflict them leave them now. &gt;&gt; You think we don't have a right to do that? Absolutely. That's what the scripture says we must do. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What for? To bring you back and make you one with health make you one with Christ. &gt;&gt; If you're backsliden and lukewarm in your experience, may that demon that's drawn you aside, that desire and lust for the world in the name of Jesus, I rebuke him. as a minister of Christ, as a servant of Christ authorized by this word, I rebuke that devil, &gt;&gt; I have a right to do so and call you to come in the name of Jesus Christ and let your life be yielded to Christ for whomsoever you yield yourself to his his you are who you yield your members to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. so we can be one with him. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is about tonight. &gt;&gt; We'll bow. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we're here in your service. &gt;&gt; We're here to do business for the kingdom of God. We're here to serve your people. And the enemy certainly is on a rampage on a as a roaring line. He would lie to the minds of of the individuals. He do everything that he can, but we have withstood him tonight. And your power breaks every feder. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, let the Holy Spirit hover over this entire congregation of people. In your name, we ask it for the glory of God that you might be glorified. Lord, it's glorious when people are delivered and healed and and saved and whatever more. But all of these things are for one purpose and that is that the name of Christ might be lifted up and glorified. Let it let the effect of this meeting continue in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory alone. We ask it humbly now Lord. We ask it humbly. Oh God. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Your lamb Jesus Christ. He's the one that was torn. He was the one that was severed. He paid the full debt that we could be free. I wonder who needs that deliverance tonight. I wonder who needs it. You can stand to your feet now physically, emotionally, spiritually, every other way. You can stand to your feet now. And this congregation will pray and I will pray. We are going to sing Jesus breaks every feder and he sets me free. Before you stand, determined and resolve in your heart. I I'm standing with faith in my heart. There is no other word but this word that can set me free. Jesus breaks every Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and he sets me free. Let's give him all the glory as we sing. I will shout hallelujah. Shut it in face mouth. I will shout hallelujah for he set me free for he sets me free. Once again everyone now for he set me free. Almighty God, giver of life, creator of deliverance, author of faith and author of salvation. This congregation of people and those that have stood have stood with an individual need, an individual request. And these requests are coming before you now, Lord, as incense along with worship. We are praising you for your power. We're praising you that the work is already finished. We are praising you because you're the God who has provided. Oh, more than we have need of. You're the God. You're the God of complete oneness and healing and unity and harmony. You're the God that is ordained that we should walk in such sweet sweet union with you, Lord. I pray father now that as you hear our voice and it is united together with your voice. Oh God you said that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And you said in another place that we should simply speak the word. And so we speak healing. Oh God we speak deliverance. Oh God we speak we speak defeat to the enemy. We speak that he must be separated. We speak that he must be cast out. We speak that he must depart in the name of Jesus. Let that spirit of condemnation, let that sickness, let that disease leave the people. Let that condemnation, oh God, be gone. Let that doubt depart. Oh God, my sister, in the name of Jesus Christ, send your messenger to these homes. Send your messenger, Lord. Deliver my brother out of that bed, oh God of affliction and infirmity, and set him on his feet rejoicing. We will give you praise and glory. A lot of people won't thank you, but we will thank you. We will glorify your name. Oh, bless the Lord. Oh, bless you. And all that is within me. Bless your holy name. Oh Jesus, you're ministering to us. You're ministering to us, Lord. Oh, you're ministering to us. How we love you. How we thank you. How we thank you for these people, Lord. Open with open face, looking into your word as you reveal yourself to them from glory to glory that they might come into your very image and likeness. &gt;&gt; Strengthen us and be with us &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's all everyone stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Matthew, would you like to bring Sister Hannah? I wonder, brother Lance, if you would come, please. Hallelujah. Jesus breaks. Jesus praise every Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he sets meal. All things are possible for me. Holy. All things are possible. Holy believe. All things are possible for we believe. All things are all I receive. Oh Lord, I receive. Lord I receive that and all things are Lord I receive. Lord I receive. Lord I receive. All things are possible. Lord, I Lord I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. For I believe all things are possible, Lord. I really &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's someone who's been struggling, who've been bound. You have not been able to get free. You've tried church. You've tried this. Maybe you've tried this church. You've tried to read the Bible. You've tried to read a message. You've tried this. You've tried that. But there have been no deliverance. And somehow tonight you feel it's over. You feel that God, you don't have to come forward. You can do it right where you're at. But if you feel you need prayer, we'll be happy to pray for you. I want to tell I want to say something because a lot of people say, "I want to be healed because I need to come back to good health, etc." That's wonderful. I need to be delivered so I can live h a a the kind of life, a fruitful life, a life that's a delight to the Lord. That's all good. But when the blind man in in the Gospel of John, his disciples had a question and they said to Jesus, "Who hath sinned? &gt;&gt; This man or his parents?" Jesus said, "Neither, not his parents and not him, but this has been done so that the God will be glorified." Sometime we feel I'm sick. I did something wrong. What did I do wrong? Uh uh something's happened. Uh maybe God is uh uh God is punishing me. No, think about that blind man. Maybe had a wife. Maybe had children. I don't know. Think about what he went through. Never perhaps saw a flower in all of his life. Never saw the beauty of life. Never saw a child's face. And God allowed him to go through that. You don't understand that kind of a God. Neither do I. But God allowed that so that this moment could come and he could give glory to God. and he was made perfectly whole. Maybe that's your m maybe that's your moment. Maybe this is that moment. And if it is, we'll be happy to pray with you. I want Sister Calder, Sister Jenna, Jessica, I would like you to come. Come, please. I wonder if there's anyone. Let's sing it once again and maybe someone else. This is the atmosphere. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why do why do these things happen? We don't know. But we know one thing. God delivers people that his name may be glorified. It's not so we can even be well. It's so that he can be glorified. And the fact that you're made well is only a side benefit. &gt;&gt; The fact you're delivered is only a side benefit. That's why a lot of people aren't delivered say, "I want to be delivered. I want to do this. I, you know, I need to I need to be happy again." That's not the point. The point is that God can be glorified so you can go through the rest of your life and say, "He delivered me. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he delivered me. I'm so glad he set me free. Oh, I could rejoice tonight and do a dance. He set me free as he's done that for you. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I receive." Heavenly Father, say and pray with us as you would. there's someone else that really is in that particular state, you come. We got brethren, we got ministers, we got deacons, we got men of faith. &gt;&gt; We got a people of faith here, friends. We got people here who are accustomed to miracles. &gt;&gt; We've seen all kinds of them. &gt;&gt; And I say we shouldn't let down the bars. We should say, "Oh God, let us be a let us be a devastation to the kingdom of darkness and Satan in the name of Jesus Christ." I believe in preaching and power. And the prophet said, "Preaching is demonstrating the gospel." I'm preaching tonight that the gospel may be demonstrated. May these who are prayed for walk out of here absolutely healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I receive. Lord, I receive. All things are possible. Lord, I receive. &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. All things are possible. Oh Lord I receive. Yes Lord I receive. Oh Lord I receive. All things are possible. Lord I receive. Yes Lord I receive Lord I receive. Thank you. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Lord God we dance. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord I receive all things. &gt;&gt; Praise your name. Yes, Lord I receive. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive. All things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. For I receive only believe now just that all things are Just all just all things are possible. Lord, Lord, I believe now. Yes, Lord I believe. Our hearts will be Lord I all things are Lord I believe I believe Lord I All things are possible. We place you in the highest place for you. Our great high priest we place you.

All day long price Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. Before we dismiss, I want to turn and sing then Jesus came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus came. &gt;&gt; And it was all different from that time on. I don't know what your thoughts are but I believe tonight Jesus came in a special way to the various individuals and that's why we have the atmosphere we have I say God bless you you come expecting on the Lord's day say this is a resurrection day I come to expecting to see life &gt;&gt; manifested &gt;&gt; in me and in others hallelujah &gt;&gt; glory to God is anything too hard for our Lord nothing.

When Jesus comes, the tears are the way. Listen now. He takes the glue and fills the night with glory. For all is change when Jesus comes to listen now. One side alone beside the highway. His eyes were blind, but the light he could not see. He lost his breath and shivered in the shadow. But this changed death. Then Jesus came and saved his flee. When Jesus comes, the tender is broken. Oh, when Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; where's the word? our cry away. He takes the world and it fills my life with glory for all when Jesus comes. Just in prayer now. Our heavenly father. Many requests have been made known. Prayers have been uttered. Requests and we have come to you asking, beseeching you. For there is none other that can answer. There's no other that can do these things. And we identify you as the living Christ, the bleeding word of this day, the one who has come and walked amongst us. We believe that you are indeed here not in song and not only in word but in manifestation. You are here to manifest yourself and we are here Lord to open our mouths and to give glory to you. &gt;&gt; We feel as though we have been made and created and sent to the world at such a time as this to give you praise and glory. And may this congregation feel that as a solemn commission. I have been here to praise and glorify my Lord. I pray that they will go from this place with praise on their lips. Oh God of glory to the name of Jesus Christ for the great things that you have done and you are doing and will do. &gt;&gt; I ask you to send us now from this place and may you give a special blessing to the people protection along the roads and in the parking lot and the children and keep them in good health.
