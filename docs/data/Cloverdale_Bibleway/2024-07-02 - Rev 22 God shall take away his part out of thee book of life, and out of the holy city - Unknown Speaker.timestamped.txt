[0:00] the revelation of St John the Divine
[0:03] chapter 22 and whosoever will let him
[0:06] take the Water of Life freely for I
[0:09] testify unto every man that heareth the
[0:11] words of the prophecy of this book If
[0:13] any man shall add unto these things God
[0:16] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[0:17] written in this book and if any man
[0:19] shall take away from the words of the
[0:21] book of this prophecy God shall take
[0:24] away his part out of the book of life
[0:26] and out of the holy city and from the
[0:28] things which are written in this book
[0:30] he which testifieth these things saith
[0:33] surely I come quickly amen even so come
[0:37] Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus
[0:40] Christ be with you all amen
