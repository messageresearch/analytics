couple announcements before we turn to the word and just about tall mentioned a little bit just to tighten up our chains a little bit on sunday with uh just our how we're conducting here at the services and here in the chapels the supplies to every every one of us some of this some specifics to hear but um we're just wanting to be very aware of of of how we're handling ourselves both inside here and the deacons are just helping keep the order for our distancing etcetera but it also applies outside and and so i i know in some of our guidelines we stated you know just to kind of go out and hit the cars and kind of limit that time there but i i don't have a problem with the fellowship out there and that's a big part of being able to come to the chapel at the camp or here be able to just to fellowship but it is very important that we maintain some distance i came out on sunday and i was a little bit uh woo dear we're just a little bit bunched too much and so we need to be very aware of that we are on 186th we have neighbors across the back that are very very keen and then they just see a whole lot of cars in our parking lot and all they need to say is yeah there's there's way more than than uh then they're allowed there and someone needs to come and we don't need that you know so i just want everybody both here and out on the internet as well please be very conscious of how it's perceived uh from from the road and uh from our neighbors so just when you're outside please uh fellowship but distanced as as we should and just be that testimony here in at the church and uh those that do come for the balcony please you do need to still park over on that side of the parking lot and so we're not all sitting here again it just comes out and it's like whoa there's a lot of cars there we're essentially allowed 50 cars but we don't need to pack them all in one spot so so just please if you're on the balcony you need to park on the far side past the pylons there and and we'll just be as conscious as we can and we just kind of jerk our chains a little bit so that we follow what we need to do and and uh not bring any ill needed attention to ourselves good all right amen well we're gonna sing a couple songs here there's a couple courses we haven't sang in a while and then brother timmy can come out as he desires we're ready for the word tonight not not uh not me

evening we thank you for this service this time that we can have together here canada united states even around the world people will be streaming right now and lord we thank you for each and every one lord may your presence just connect us all together in heavenly places in jesus christ lord you look down upon if if not a sparrow falls from heaven but what you knoweth surely lord you know each and every one that's gathered together in the name of jesus christ right now we ask your blessing upon them we ask you lord to lead your word to meet the need of every individual we commit the service to you in jesus christ's name amen amen good to be in the house of the lord thank you brother michael for that song service we love brother michael being brother michael amen we wouldn't want him to be anybody else don't be an old stodgy person like me you know just it's just good the way you are and we appreciate each and every one of you the way you are amen it's good to be yourself you know prophet god once said be yourself he says everybody will like you better and god will too i'm paraphrasing but that's kind of what he said you know that's the way the lord loves us is the way he made us amen so let's take our bibles and turn together to the book of luke this evening i have a little thought thank you musicians and i appreciate each and every one contributing to the service praise the lord luke chapter 10 we'll begin reading at verse 17. i want to take a subject a kind of a carry forward from the last subject of after love comes joy i want to zero in on the joy because your name is written in heaven the joy because your name is written in heaven and we'll just see how far we get tonight see whether we finish tonight or continue on sunday morning which lord willing will take the sunday morning as well so you be praying and above all just pray that the lord will have his way luke chapter 10 and verse 17 is where we will begin and the 70 returned again with joy now remember jesus had sent out the seventy two by two to go and minister he gave them power over devils and and all sorts of things over diseases and they returned with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name so there was great joy here this is a particular type of joy and there's many aspects of joy throughout the scripture for different reasons but jesus said unto them i bel i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you if this is the kind of power they had without the holy ghost what kind of power do we have by the holy ghost all right and he says notwithstanding notwithstanding all of that power and i'm sorry to keep you standing but let me just say who wouldn't be happy to see devil's subject unto them who wouldn't be happy to see satan fall from heaven like lightning who wouldn't be happy and rejoicing at that and go boy we had a meeting did you see that one get healed did you see the devil come out of that one did you see that that one there and jesus says notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them amen the lord had his blessing to the word you may be seated rejoice that because your names are written in heaven what does it mean to be written in heaven what does it mean to be written what does it mean when you write something down when you record something obviously the purpose is that it's something worth remembering can you say amen to that some of you even come to church and you have your notepads and your pens and because you're not going to write down every word that i say you're not a scribe that's going to record every part of the service we have recording equipment that does that but but you want to record what speaks to you when something inspires something within yourself you want to make a record of it because you want to look at it again you might even go back to the service later on and say oh there was something brother tim said there there's a scripture he read or there was a quote that he read and i just didn't quite get it but it sure inspired me and so you might listen to it again or watch it again in order to pick something up so it's a record it's something that's recorded for future reference it's something that that then it be at the time that it's recorded then you expect that that recording or that writing is going to have a future application can you go with me there now in malachi chapter 3 and and if you brothers that are in the booth can i'll be referring to some scriptures and you can put it up on the screen for the people at home uh in malachi chapter 3 and verse 14 you can refer to that in your bibles if you want he said you have said god's speaking to israel now remember the burden of the word of the lord to israel through malachi you know god said to them you say i don't love you or you say wherein do you love me and and god says was not uh was not esau jacob's brother but jacob have i loved he saw have i hated and so this book of malachi is about the relationship between god and israel and as he's expressing this now he says to them you have said it is vain to serve god and what prophet is it that we have kept his ordinance now remember well last time i spoke i referred to the psalm of asif who said i got guilty of looking at the world and i i beheld the world and i thought well you know they don't suffer and they're not condemned and they seem to have a good life and they're increased and everything like that he says but when i went to the house of god then i discovered the truth of the matter then and so his eyes became open and so now he's god is speaking to israel kind of in the same context and he says you have said it's vain to serve god what prophet is it that we have kept his ordinances that we have walked mournfully before the lord of hosts and now we call that proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt god or even delivered then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written amen before him for them that feared the lord and that thought on his name so when when you're pondering the things of god when you're fellowshipping around the word of god there is a remembrance before god even as brother branham said when you speak about him he draws near so there's a spiritual heavenly connection based on fellowship and thoughts on the word of god and so he goes on and he says they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts i say amen to that in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall you return and be and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not now this is a powerful scripture because he's saying now you that have thought on me now why are you thinking on god the reason you're thinking of god is because a you're fellowshipping in what god has done for you or b you're maybe pondering a question that you don't understand brother branham often did that he talks about that in uh new ministry and and he talks about how that he was out squirrel hunting and he was pondering that scripture if you say to this mountain and so he was pondering and he thought and he was thinking of himself how it fit in the scriptures and how it fit in the atonement because all things were in atonement but that was spoken before the atonement was made and so as he's thinking on these things he's not realizing but god is dealing with him so often that's the way it is even with ministers and i trust with all of us but with ministers we don't just get a thought because it's our turn to preach we're often pondering the word of god we're often thinking about things someone will say something or or a little statement or or something or you'll get into an atmosphere and god will begin to quicken things because when you get into the presence of the lord the gift within you begins to operate it's just the way it is listen let somebody get up here preach it i don't care who it is brother murphy brother michael brother john whoever it is i'm sure brother tom will agree with me let them stand up here preaching and we'll be sitting there and it's like i could get up right now and finish that thought you know why because the gift begins to operate it's not the man it's not the intelligence but there's something that god put in the man he ascended up on high and gave gifts unto men some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers and so this is all in god's great economy and so now as the scripture says he says as you ponder these things as you're in these things he says then you will return now when he's talking about returning to israel he's talking about their restoration to their inheritance but we can apply it to our restoration to our inheritance because we have an inheritance that adam lost in the beginning and since the inheritance was lost in the beginning that jesus said blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear for kings and great men have desired to hear these things they desire to see the things that you're seeing you see what he's saying is they have pondered these things they have thought about these things they have wandered at these things but it wasn't for their time but now things are being revealed in your day and blessed are your eyes and blessed are your ears and so he begins to express that to to the disciples but but the scripture here says you shall return then then you will discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serves god and him that serveth him not he's not saying you will discern between the religious and the non-religious catch it now he's not saying you'll discern between what seems good and what's not what's moral and not moral no he says you'll be discerned between the righteous i'll dwell on righteousness a little bit because abraham believed god and that it was accounted to him for righteousness is that right what is the righteous those that believe god and god accounts it to them for righteous when god sends his word in their day they believe god and so abraham believe god and you'll be able to discern god said to israel and now say it to us as we come to our inheritance i'm way ahead of myself but as we come to our inheritance i'll just drop this in now and then we'll take a loop around back to it but as we come now in these last days to our inheritance the purpose is that you can know who the righteous are and who the unrighteous are let's go to jesus day peter thought it was a good thing to say lord you won't suffer we won't let you suffer matter of fact we're not you know you talk about these med evil men taking you and and and and beating you or whatever more he says we're not going to let that happen we're your disciples and we're here to protect you and what did jesus say get behind me satan why because he was inspired with the wrong inspiration that was not of god the inspiration of god for that hour was that jesus was the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world that's what jesus was trying to get them to see the devil was trying to push jesus at by the disciples even to take the throne of david but that wasn't the time there had to be a bride first come into existence that would sit with him in his throne and so there's a discernment that must happen there must be an understanding that happens what is righteous and what is wickedness isn't righteousness just to do good paul says though i speak with tongue of men and angels and have not love i'm a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol though i have all faith to move mountains though i understand all mysteries and have not love he says i'm nothing sometimes we think oh if i could understand all mysteries that's righteous paul says if you miss this key ingredient you're not oh if i had faith to move mountains but if you miss love oh if i you know be careful jesus said you need to come to the revelation of what is right and what is wrong in god's sight amen you're with me so far so what does it mean to have a revelation of your name written in heaven to know rejoice that your name is written in heaven does it mean just to understand the doctrine that you know there's no new name written in heaven and we know god's eternal and and it's written before the foundation of the world jesus in john 17 as he's praying for the church and praying in that chapter he says he says father i will that they also whom now has given me this is verse 24 be that thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world so now jesus himself praying which of course he was the word but he's praying lord a father i'm praying understanding that i'm in your love before the foundation of the world amen okay so now remember that was jesus now paul in ephesians 1 and verse 3 and i'm just taking this slowly just to kind of lay this in here ephesians 1 and verse 3 it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world jesus said you love me before the foundation of the world i'm praying for these that they may be one even as we are one and brother branham often goes from that one ship to where jesus says in that day you'll know i am in the father the father me i in you and you and me so there's a revelation in there and so as he's laying it out now in ephesians the apostle paul picking up he's chosen us in him in christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so as jesus prayed father i thank you that you loved me before the foundation of the world we can also pray father i thank you that you love me before the foundation of the world amen it's not something he didn't love you because you behaved yourself today he didn't love you because you didn't make a mistake today is there anyone like that did anyone not make a mistake today we make mistakes every day brother branham said but yet he loved us before the foundation of the world i always loved spurgeon who said i know that he loved me before i was born because i know he would never have loved me after i was born come on we all can put an amen to that one amen he didn't love you because he felt sorry for you he loved you because you're in your thought in his thoughts before the foundation of the world chosen us in him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved amen we know the scripture in revelation 17 talking about the beast and the great and it says the beast that thou saust was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast which was and is not and yet is there'll be those that worship the beasts they'll be those that worship the system of religion that is antichrist because their names were never written in the book all right so then we so then if we talk about jesus saying rejoice that your name is written in heaven then it then do we say just knowing those facts is that the rejoicing i say that's not the rejoicing because that's just the doctrine doctrine doesn't bring joy revelation brings joy all right doctrine if you look at the at the uh bride tree as brother brown talks about the cankerworm palmwarm caterpillar locust eating off the tree down to a stump in the dark ages one of the things that it ate off or one of the last things that it ate off was the bark and the bark was the protection of the tree the doctrine the church has doctrine the church has something that it knows where it stands we have the truth of the word of god but that's not our joy our joy is the revelation that god opens our eyes to because joy is a fruit not bark and so the fruit of the spirit is love joy and so forth so before the foundation of the world we were in the mind of god we were written in a book so to speak and that is when we can say the logos comes into view that is this time that god begins to manifest himself and we were in christ there all of the attributes of god were in christ there the logos in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god in the beginning was the logos amen amen the and the word the logos was with god the logos was god all that was god he poured himself into another form called the logos brother brahm says that's where the lamb's book of life comes into view it says that's where king theophany comes into you there's so many things that come into view at that time so so here we are manifested in this hour stay with me i know i'm just laying these little nuggets in here but we are manifested in this day as a realization now of the reference that god wrote back here he wrote your name there but now as he wrote your name here here you are today he wrote that for a reason these are the ones i love these are the ones who is in christ that i love and you become materialized here today hallelujah and you are the ones that he loves and you are the ones that he reveals himself to because when he wrote your name he was writing his own characteristics back then in christ and now in this hour we become materialized as the written reference now brought forward into the present hour amen all right now we're we're at the start as john recorded in revelation chapter five and i just have to just refer briefly to my notes because this is too much joy just to go by notes all right but as john come to a place in revelation chapter 5 that represented what would take place in our day as he was in a vision remember he was in a vision the seals were not opened in john's day he was in a vision the seals were opened in our day but john recorded what he saw in the vision to describe the thoughts of god that would be materialized in the future that's prophecy all right prophecy as i said before is the thoughts of god not yet materialized prediction is a is deduction from inspiration and the bible that it looks like this is what's going to happen but prophecy or the mind of god or the thoughts of god that were expressed back there must come to pass heavens and earth will pass away but god's word will never fail all right we all believe and understand these things and so when john was caught up into this heaven after he received the revelation of the seven church ages then in revelation chapter 4 the throne and and now revelation chapter 5 he sees the book now come into view and one sitting on the throne in his right hand he had this book and and it was announced who's worthy to open the book and to loose the seals and it was searched through heaven and earth and under the earth to find one that was worthy and nobody was found worthy and so then the bible says john wept he did not rejoice he wept he was sad there was something about it that that he just felt like there needs to be a fulfillment and i'm not happy there's something in me welling up see a lot of times there's there there is in you things that are eternal that you don't even understand yet there were things happening to the disciples that they didn't even understand yet that jesus had to explain to them when they saw supernatural power and demons were subject to them they were rejoicing as though it was a great thing and jesus said don't bother rejoicing that's really not what you need to rejoice about but what you need to rejoice about and they maybe never even understood this statement you need to rejoice that your names are written in heaven now here's john one of those disciples that's back there now in a vision in revelation chapter 5 seeing a book is there something about that book i don't think john was a super genius he was just recording what god showed him he's a prophet and that's what a prophet does a prophet doesn't figure things out a prophet speaks what god tells him to speak sometimes people say oh brother branham thought this and brother branham thought that you know i was talking to a brother recently about translation and and i he said you know people are upset you know people say this about translation and who has the rights to translate who has this i said i said look in the scripture it says the bible says god in sundry times in diverse matters spake unto us by the prophets but now has spoken to us by his son i said that son in revelation chapter 2 in revelation chapter 3 said to the churches he told the messenger right to the churches unto the church of the laodiceans write these things i says so whose message is it brother branham was the messenger he was not the author hello sometimes we want to put brother branham as the author he he he just spoke the things that god told him to speak amen it's thus saith the lord not thus saith william branham and so as a result he's the messenger that speaks it so here's john is a prophet and the isle of patmos now recording these things that he's being shown in a vision being told to write them down and he's catching a revelation this book and then someone's not worthy to open the book and he starts to weep and one of the elders says to john now john don't weep because the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and john turned to see the lion and he saw the lamb as it had been saying he saw christ he saw the one who was his lord his savior his redeemer a lamb that was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world in time 2000 years ago now step forward to claim the book he had made the propitiation and as he took the book out of the right hand of him let me just read it for you him here as he took the book and in verse 11 it picks it up it says and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands what's 10 000 times 10 000 that's 100 million isn't it something like that and so 100 million millions of angels and millions and millions saying with a loud voice now there's a choir for you hello you can be quiet tonight if you want to but when john redeemed the book there was a hundred million angels rejoicing glory to god they were shouting were they were saying the bible says and they weren't just talking they were saying with a loud voice the scripture says worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing hallelujah they were shouting they were rejoicing and then he goes on to say in every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever hallelujah what were they doing they were having a jubilee because now the book was redeemed brother branham picks it up in the in the third seal and he talks about i talk he's actually speaking about ruth and the kinsman redeemer now here in the third seal now third seal remembers hurting out the oil and the wine and uh michael so so wonderfully preached on that it says now so ruth was just waiting because she'd already labored she'd done all these other things she was waiting so he's arrived now at the end of the book of ruth we'll come back to ruth lord willing and then when the church is waiting resting many of them most of them in the dust of the earth while he's doing his kinsmen work the world's still going worse and sin is heaping up and sickness and trouble and death and sorrow that doesn't sound very exciting the world is in a bad shape he says the godless men and godless women die right down cancer eats them up and everything else when they can't appropriate enough faith to reach out there and take hold of it then he says he comes forth takes the book out of the hand of him and then john and everything in heaven the souls under the altar begin screaming we get that in the sixth seal again he says and how they rejoiced and fell down the elders and poured out the prayers of the saints and the souls unto the altar cried worthy art thou because you redeemed us we're going back to live on the earth as kings and priests he says john said everybody in heaven everything beneath the earth everything heard him praising god about it john must have found his name there hallelujah now maybe john could say that's what he was talking about don't rejoice that devils are subject unto you but rejoice that your name is written in heaven and here's john caught up in this vision which was not actually happening it was a vision but it actually happened in our day come on i i don't know if you understand this do you know what day you're living in not only have kings and priests desire to understand these things they've desired to live in your day in the day when the word becomes open john saw it in a vision and rejoiced in a vision but when you see in this day because of the open book that your name is written in heaven hallelujah everybody ought to hear you rejoicing now brother branham said the world's getting worse sickness is getting worse the the the world is going on in sin men and women become an evil all the time but john in the midst of all of that he was rejoicing in heaven because he could see his name written there hallelujah john must have found his name on there now in the church age book brother branham talks about the lamb's book of life he goes into a lengthy uh section on it in the church bro you can read it when you go home it's page 265 to 286 of the exposition of the seven church ages and it's that's 21 pages and brother branham goes into the details of the lamb's book of life you can put the slides up for me if you like i thought i'd just go through an aspect of this because i wanted you to see something here obviously the reason that this is on my heart on the subject of joy is to dis is that the lord would show us what really brings joy and if we can see that then we have something to rejoice about amen and i say if we can see it i don't mean if we can see what i'm preaching tonight i mean if we can see our name on the book amen all right let me just talk about this the lamb's book of life now brother brown describes in this section here how the book of life and and the lamb's book of life it's all one book relates to four different types of lives here on the earth and he goes into it in detail and the first thing that he mentions or the first of the four groups as he goes through the four groups and this is all out of the church age book he talks about is the bride and he says it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride it was a it was a purpose i said i i want to talk about maybe as we get to the end this brother brown talks about the armor girl the the armor company and the boss's son that went to find a wife and he found this girl who wasn't a part of the festivities but she was kind of just laboring in the camp kind of like a rebecca and doing the character things and and the one of the first things he says he asked her was do you know the purpose of why i'm here and you know that's really something that god comes to us to bring to us do you really understand the purpose of why i came it's not because i felt sorry for sinners it's not because you know i i just hope somebody would believe in me no he had a purpose it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him now i understand why i read those scriptures she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him as jesus recognized that she's to recognize that she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation oh if we could really let these individual sentences anchor in our hearts it was his purpose to have a word bride she was chosen before the world she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever on the earth put your name there you were foreknown you were chosen you're redeemed by his blood and you can never come into condemnation further he says she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her hallelujah oh lord let that revelation be a part of our existence let it quicken us within our soul realm all right so he's talking about this first group that was god's purpose then after that he goes into the foolish virgin and i'll just quickly go through these other groups and come back to the bride the foolish virgin and the righteous of matthew chapter 25 he says secondary secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in matthew 25. all right what remember what is righteous to believe god all right in this class also are those who do not worship the beast or become involved in the antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again all right what are they lacking they're the foolish virgin lacking the oil but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life as you read through this section of the church age book you'll find that why do these come up in this judgment because there's nowhere else to come up the first resurrection is for the bride this resurrection at the end of the world at the white throne judgment is for everybody else we want to go into all the details on that so that's the foolish virgin virgin and the righteous then he talks about borderline believers israel in the wilderness judah etc he says thirdly there's there are borderline christians such as we saw in israel coming out of egypt these had their names in the book of life in their works written in the books they have days having failed to obey god and being void of the spirit though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from the book of life among this group will be ones like judas who was in that group that jesus said don't rejoice that devils are subject to you but rather that your name is written in heaven judas didn't have anything to rejoice about cain never had anything to rejoice about all right they're religious excuse me but their names are not written there amongst this group will be ones like judas who will though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have the manifestation in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him such also as balaam will be in that group all right so that's the third group fourth group being those that never were written in the book fourth and finally brother brown says are the ones whose names have never been or ever will be written on the books what a sad place to be but god and again we could go into the many things that brother branham brings out in this section god is sovereign he's he made the whole world he's able to make one vessel to honor and another vessel to dishonor he's able to make a moses and make a pharaoh amen god chooses the ones he will do to he will make to fulfill his purpose and he brings everything to pass according to his own glory we live in an age where people think they have some kind of say in how things happen an age of people's rights and they feel like they got some kind of opinion that's worth something let me tell you if you're listening tonight god is god he does as he chooses no man has been his counselor nobody tells god what to do god does what god will do but to the believer that's in him that's a rest because god has revealed his purpose to us god has shown himself to us so there's these four groups the bride of jesus christ is the one we're dwelling on tonight and brother branham says also in the church age book he says make no mistake about it he says a purpose a person rather that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the full fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way. amen god god's spirit in a believer doesn't believe anything else except the word of god that's just the reality of it amen let me let me just take a step back here i was thinking about these four groups as i was staring at this i was thinking you know those are in number from the least to the most as far as i don't have any proof of saying that i just say statistically your pride is probably the fewest and then the next fewest would be the foolish virgin and the righteous and then the next fewest would be borderline believers and the most are those that are never written in the book i am one of the few one of the few and by faith in god's word i can claim it amen in the word all the way i want to look at a couple things in in perfect faith before we finish these slides here and move on brother brown says in the message perfect faith he says now these are the are real deep lessons and i'll catch the top of it then you dig down in it not to offend anybody but if you're only listening to tapes how are you ever going to fulfill this there there are those that think the that to be in the message is only to listen to tapes you don't need preachers i'll tell you what you need the fivefold ministry you need the gifts that god put in the body to dig down into these things that a prophet of god said i'll catch the top of it but you dig down into it amen so there's wonderful truths that brother branham brings out in these things that he wants us as a church to get into the meat of it all right i'll explain that as i go on here there's a reason i say that he says in perfect faith he says now here's where many people fail to receive their healing what they're asking for because they take faith to be something that it is not they don't believe it it's not an imagination it's an actual substance now listen close see it is not what you imagine it's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else it's as real as my eye says this is a piece of paper all right so he takes a piece of paper i'll take a piece of paper this is a piece of paper you say well that's elementary brother tim but he says that's just as real as faith should be to you he says it's just as real to say that that is a light i'll say it's just as real to say that this is a pulpit it's solid now if i didn't believe it i would just walk through it but i would run into it because it's real and as real as that is is as real as faith is when a person has faith it says by his stripes i am healed they have to understand all the aspects not understand don't get me wrong i'm not trying to say intellectual understanding but they have to catch every part of that revelation by his stripes whose stripes who's the his it's the lamb that was slain for our sins that was that what that was the price the propitiation the sacrifice for our salvation and our healing that it's a twofold covenant by his stripes he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes i am healed amen by his stripes i i am healed i not there is healing i am healed who am i that word's for me i am a part of the one that scripture was written for i'm a part of the redeemed i'm a part of the blessed of the lord i'm a part of those that was in his mind before the foundation of the world i see myself there because i see myself here my name was in the book rejoice that your name was written in heaven because if you can see your name written in heaven you can see your name written in the promises hallelujah i am healed every blessing is mine it's all mine it's my inheritance i'm the one that he's speaking about hallelujah he says that's what faith is it's just as real to you ron spencer is holding to that tonight you know he's a soldier he's a warrior he's a he's a battler i was praying for him today we're all praying for him today and i'm not anything special we're all praying for him he's a man he knows what pain is he knows what it is to suffer that's why we pray for brother tom he's a man he's not a superhuman hello but he's a man but he walks by faith nothing is impossible with god amen any man any woman that sees their name in the book says nothing's impossible with my god i was in him before the foundation of the world i was in christ in him i was in christ in him in love before the foundation of the world all of his promises are mine i'm claiming them because my name's on the book not because i'm special not because i'm superhuman not because i got some special gift matter of fact if i had a gift it wouldn't be for me anyway it'd be for the body but because i'm his my name's on the book hallelujah i'm sorry did i skip over one here he says now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are jesus had faith in the word of god that said what he was it is written of me didn't david in the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him i am the bread of life that came down from god out of heaven what a testimony to stand there on that day when they're standing there saying our fathers ate manna in the wilderness jesus says i am the bread of life that came talk about a revelation he walked by perfect faith in what the word said he was he's not interested in the contradiction of sinners that he endured with day after day after day at they had an intellectual understanding of the scripture they had a they had a religious understanding by their traditions they made the word of god of no effect but he stood there and he spoke to them this is what the word says i am and it's going to come to pass destroy this temple in three days i'll raise it up again as jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights so shall the son of man be in the heart of the earth what was he saying he says that word cannot fail that's speaking of me the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel and the trump of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air that's speaking of me whatever you ask the father in my name i will give it to you as speaking of me in that day you'll know that i am in the father the father me i and you and you and me i am the you in that sentence hallelujah jesus john 17 says neither do i pray for these alone but i pray for those who will believe because of their words that's me he was praying for hallelujah and it has nothing to do with how i feel it's revealed hallelujah brother michael talked about revelation stimulation of revelation touched on it last time i spoke and but stimulation of revelation there's a reason for that there's a reason it's oil and wine it's not just oil and it's not just wine oil represents the holy spirit but the wine represents the stimulation of revelation because it takes revelation to operate the holy spirit because the power of the holy spirit is bound by a law and that law is a law of faith or revelation so the wine has to go with the oil that always has to be in the church it's not just the oil say oh we had a wonderful holy ghost meeting but the revelation has got to be there to quicken the promise to you show you who you are and show you who your rights is and that the power of god is in you you claim it and walk in it and it must happen exactly the way god said it hallelujah much teaching is it more like preaching he knew that he knew with that a perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him and he said now i myself do nothing but it's my faith in god and god was in him and the word excuse me the word made manifest and when the word of god comes in you it's made manifest for you are a believer see and a believer is the faith of god that moves in you let me put it in another phrase a believer is the revelation from god that moves in you because faith is a revelation faith comes by hearing hearing by the word so you are the revelation of what god showed you and it has nothing to do with how you're feeling you might come through just have come through the worst week of your life beat up drug out all kinds of situations that maybe the devil is trying to tell you how can you be a son of god but it's real to you i believe the word of god i believe it more than anything i'll tell you what that's your joy never lose that your joy and as that is real to you then you deny your own flesh you deny your own feelings and you walk by faith in the word it's like the one man i think brother biscuit even quoted at one time he's in a hole you know he says lord i'm in this hole or he says lord we're in this hole says lord it's a deep hole but he said you get out i'll hang on and we'll both be out god is with you i'll be with you even in you unto the end of the age i'll never leave you forsake you all that the father has given me will come to me those are yea and amen that's absolutely thus saith the lord god won't lose a single one is this all right tonight if it's not i'll stand alone and preach it i'll still believe it amen a believer is the faith of god that moves in you jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person you ever feel that way he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are did you catch that if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you i trust you're there this was spoken in 1963 or 65. i can't remember 65 maybe and and and this is now 2020. this is almost 60 years ago the church should be here are you here you ever wonder why the world doesn't understand you because you're called to be a mystic to this world they won't understand you he says the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you'd not do hallelujah you sound odd to the world you you don't fit into the realm of human emotion and sympathy you know like jesus when he was walking on the earth a mystic to the world one man says oh lord i'll come and follow you let me go and i think he said bury my dad or something and jesus said let the dead bury the dead what is that to you come and follow me what an unsympathetic man my what what no it was a different realm he was a mystic to the world this isn't about an earthly kingdom this is about a heavenly kingdom this isn't about a name written on a birth certificate in canada or united states this is about a name written on a book before the foundation of the world i'm a part of that book hallelujah i'm a part of that book you're a part of that book it's not just a book with a bunch of letters in it it's a book of the very attributes of god god revealing himself is describing what you are in him oh my let's just carry on here i'll never get where where i want to get to tonight excuse me for always looking at my watch he says you'd the people wouldn't understand you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you'd not do amen and that's the slides amen so the scripture we read a couple weeks ago hebrews 1 and verse 8 says but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is forever and every paul introducing christ to the hebrews the deity of jesus christ emmanuel the messiah god in flesh and he takes from chapter one to chapter seven of melchizedek to describe who jesus is and what his authority and position is that's why i always wondered you probably did too brother tom wondered maybe you already knew but why did brother branham only preach the hebrew series to chapter 7 because he's just preaching the deity of jesus christ he didn't go into all the rest of it that wasn't the subject that he was preaching on but as he's preaching the hebrew series and he goes through it and that's what paul's breaking down to the church in the deity of jesus christ he says the but unto the son not angels unto the son he said thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness what's righteousness to believe god and it's accounted to him for righteousness that's his authority i believe god i am the bread that came down from heaven i am what the word spoke of me i am the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world that's his scepter and if he's made us kings and priests then that's your scepter too that's your right of rule that's your your instrument of authority i believe what he told me i believe what the word says about me it doesn't matter what the circumstances are it doesn't matter what the world says it doesn't matter what the government says it doesn't matter all those things what matters is what god said he says thou hast loved righteousness there it is again and hated iniquity knowing what his right to do and not doing it iniquity therefore god even thy god has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows there's the rejoicing the gladness once again as jesus was walking in it why because he was walking with a scepter of righteousness of perfect faith in what the word said he was he had a rejoicing that nobody else knew he was anointed above his fellows he was the book of life he was the fullness of god dwelling bodily in flesh he was all in all of it and you were in him there and because you were in him there you came to be manifested now but now we've come to the hour of rejoicing where god now reveals himself to the church not as god but as bridegroom god reveals himself that way to you to bring a level of gladness that the church hasn't had till this age now bear with me this only comes to the bride i'm going to take 10 minutes to get down this road here then we'll close this level of gladness only can come to the bride because it's based on revelation and this revelation only came in this hour this is bride time this is where a prophet could say i no longer call you church i call you bride where he could say the church has the the bride has been united to him in the marriage on this side we go to the marriage supper are you with me so far so let me ask you a question you believe in him and because you believe him it imparts more joy the more you see yourself in the word the only thing that brings joy is revelation i'll say it again he says what i'm sorry the only thing that brings this joy is revelation there's other types of joy he says and then i'll say this why do you love the message why do you love the man i'm not talking about why you should love the message why do you love the message it's because you see yourself there [Applause] like john in revelation chapter 5 there was something about that book as somebody's got to redeem that book and then brother brown says when it was redeemed then john saw his name there and they created such a great rejoicing so is it when the revelation of that book the message of the hour comes to you personally it produces a rejoicing now i've got to stop here for a moment and say if you're not there you just stay in god's presence till you get there god has it for you it's it's not something that you've got to work yourself up into because revelation is sovereignly given of god god sent this message to bring you to a level of revelation and stimulation by revelation that can only be attained in the message of the hour i feel sorry for people that leave the message i just love the message i don't claim to know everything i just love it whenever i listen to a message i get something out of it whenever i read a message book i get something out of it because of the message this book became a new book to me amen because i understood it in a way i never understood it before it became personal it was no longer this is the precepts of god it's this is what my soul has always desired so the joy of the bride of christ that is comparable to the to the joy that jaw that john felt there's many joys in the bible we won't go into it but as i was thinking of this and i was thinking about how john felt i was thinking about the oil of gladness it suddenly began to dawn on me that the only comparable is the joy of a bride and brothers i hate to say it to you in the natural you have no clue because you've never been a natural bride but i sat my wife down and i said i want to quiz you here about certain things in a relationship i just preached on femininity so i felt like i can maybe go down that road a little bit and because i wanted to know because i'm not feminine i'm masculine is that okay i know which side of the street i walk on let's let's put it that way praise the lord but we need to see the feminine side to see this joy because don't laugh at me it's the joy of ruth when naomi showed her the true interest of boaz that he will not rest till all things be fulfilled it's the joy of esther to know the place she held in the kingdom it's the joy of the armored girl that she as she begin to discover as brother brown describes that in the third seal or the sixth seal i think it is he describes that and and he as he begins to describe this uh this girl who felt she was nothing and then discovered she had obtained the interest of the man that everybody wanted to marry it brought something in her and it brought something out of her and i'll say it this way it's the joy of weakness in finding its strength what does it mean for a woman i had to ask my wife now these are not her thoughts i asked her certain questions so that i could discern from those questions so don't worry i'm not telling you what my wife told me i'm telling you about the general picture here so firstly sisters you can pull a little bit on this all right firstly there's the joy of anticipation boy meets girl girl meets boy all of a sudden events in life take on a new meaning because the girl who grew up thinking about one day being married or being swept off her feet by night in shining armor or whatever way you want to turn return it now it's like is this the time so now there's an initial joy of anticipation and maybe mixed with that some possible trepidation what if what if it isn't real what if it isn't true what if it doesn't work out what if it doesn't happen the way i thought it would happen what if i don't know the real hymn now that's the natural i'll go to the spiritual just in uganda just this last week there was a meeting in uganda brother stephen o'bally was introducing the message to 25 methodist ministers the pentecostals heard the message the baptist heard the message now the methodists are hearing the message i got the video you'll see the video on the website in the near future now as he's talking to them and preaching them they had heard the radio broadcast that we had sponsored they had listened to it and so they wanted to hear in person the things of this message and they wanted to ask questions and so they were gathered together they weren't allowed to have church so they're kind of outside socially distanced you would say and and and sitting and listening to brother stephen preach and at the end of it all they they confessed this is the truth and we need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but there became now some trepidation well if we embrace this message what happens to the buildings we currently occupy if we believe the message what will take place see i'm speaking like paul tonight i i show you a mystery but really i'm speaking about christ and the church i'm not just speaking about a woman that's finding love i'm speaking about christ in the church when you first became a christian or what if what will my family say what will my friends say what will my my what will my business associates say what will happen to my wait what about my job what about this what about my ambitions what about all these things brother stephen gave these myths these ministers good advice don't worry about that now whatever will happen will happen but you just need to embrace the truth so they experience the joy of their great anticipation of coming into the light of the word then comes the next stage of relationship of the joy of getting to know the person we call it courtship and uh you may be you're able to now talk with the person the the little girl the young lady is able to maybe have conversation brother branham even said about the armor girl you know he kept in touch with her he kept talking to her over time maybe sending letters whatever it would be in that day and and so she was expecting him to come to the marriage she was expecting him for that certain time and and other people didn't really know about it but she was getting to understand him and so it is in the believer as christ begins to reveal himself to you you begin to understand him more you begin to see yourself a little bit more in his eyes and the talk becomes deeper about the meaning of life and then it becomes the hopes and the dreams and the ambitions and where is he going in other words try beginning to catch his purpose are you with me so far and so all of these things now the woman begins to see is the is he really the right one for me the joy begins to build are you with me there there's another level of joy here in the courtship as they begin to as brother brown would say their hearts begin to beat as one and they begin to understand each other and so so if he if he does it right i remember a young man coming to me for one of my daughters and and and wanted to court her and i i said you know well what are you doing for a living i kind of already knew he says well he says i'm delivering pizza and i said well what's what's your objective he says well i don't know i said well that ain't gonna cut it see and i said you better find yourself a trade or something and and to his credit he did he went out got a trade became in a position where he could raise a family and provide for that family and god bless them for that and all those things so that so there's this stage of getting to know and then after that comes the joy of engagement and that's really where the church has been through seven church ages is the joy of engaged engagement the betrothed the commitment of life together but not yet life together the questions should be over the that now is the time to relax it's kind of like ruth uh resting now for boaz who as he said i will i will do that what you've asked me to do and she's resting and naomi is explaining to her he will not rest till all is fulfilled and and so on and so so forth the decision is made to be forever joined together brother branham says about engagement she's your wife but you're not married yet all right and that's the way the church was through seven church ages they were the betrothed but now in the last days now we come to the great time because nothing beats the joy of marriage oh i didn't get very many amens i thought you'd say amen to that one brother tom not not he did say amen such a joy and i'm just giving a rough time nothing beats the joy of marriage there's other joys but nothing beats the joy of marriage my wife told me it's the best day of her life and whether you believe me she said that or not that's up to you but she did say it it's the happiest most joyous day and i thought it was interesting because as i begin to pull out of her the emotions of a woman in going because i know how i felt and maybe i knew a little bit about how she felt but i began to ask certain questions as i studied it but there becomes and you married couples can can fellowship with me on this there becomes a relaxing of being able to give yourself unreservedly and trust him more than there ever was before so now i'll speak about it in the church in the opening of the word there is a relaxing and a greater trust that is built up in christ than ever has been down through the church ages praise be to god now parents are nice we all appreciate parents but the joy of the one that loves you who had now becomes the only authority becomes a great thrill in the woman's life as brother bradham describes it in the church age book under the key of david as he says under the marriage ceremony he says no other man no other power has any right or authority over that woman but he the bridegroom alone hallelujah now i'm saying all this to say this that this woman now begins to realize a part of her life that she never we could realize before because while entering into the bonds of matrimony it is actually freedom by coming a bond slave to christ it is actually freedom it is actually a liberty from all the things that restrain you from being who you were called to be now you are loose to fully manifest what christ has put in you before the foundation of the world hallelujah and i i love this statement this one my wife did make she made a few others but i this one she did me she says after marriage life becomes a new book oh saints brother brown said after the opening of the seals this become a new book hallelujah this become a new book and when god reveals himself what's the opening of the seals it's revealing to you your name that's written in heaven hallelujah that brings a rejoicing in the church that she sees her name which was written in heaven now revealed because the lamb has tore back the seals the lamb has revealed the mystery it's like you found the answer to your life hallelujah rejoice not of the things that happen in this physical realm whether devils are subject to you or not whether whether sickness strikes you or not it's you have the victory anyway whatever happens in this natural realm don't just rejoice there that's a certain level but rejoice that your name is in him before the foundation of the world you always were in christ jesus every promise in the book always was yours there never was a time it didn't belong to you you just had to come to the realization it's all paid for it's already yours as the musicians come let's close this service it's already belongs to you brother branham says in the sardisian age in that same section actually the last paragraph of the sardisian age he says once more the spirit is spoken once again we have reviewed the record of what the spirit has said to another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by and it was fulfilled exactly as he said it would be what a consolation for us this is to us to who hoped to be in the last day bride for it causes our hearts to leap for joy that he is faithful and will perform his every promise hallelujah when you see your name it causes your heart to rejoice and say he is faithful i might be weak i might be be miserable i might be the least of all the saints i might be the least in the body of christ but if i'm the skin on the bottom of his feet i'm still on the head of satan hallelujah i found my name in the book oh let's stand together i want to sing that song it was a great thing that he did for me it's a flat i think oh it was a great thing when you see it when john saw the book being redeemed it's not just an event of the last days it's not just a lord help me it's not just a a mystery that's made known even though it is mysteries that are made known but it's not just that it's the fulfillment of his redemptive purpose and a revealing of it to his bride this is you this is you praise god this is me hallelujah i am that bride i am that people it's got nothing to do with my mistakes i was waiting for that quiet spot i'll say it again it's got nothing to do with my mistakes because with the devil would have bind you up by your own humanity and as long as we're in this humanity we will make mistakes that's why we make mistakes because this body is not yet redeemed but we are of them that crucify the flesh we are of them that deny and renounce the things of the flesh even the flesh that tells me you have to suffer no i have been redeemed it was a great thing that he did for me can i have the words please the lord has brought my soul me [Music] seems too old for me [Music] [Music] when i'm [Music] [Music] hey [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] it [Music] therefore the redeem of the lord shall return [Music] shall be upon their head [Music] therefore [Music] an everlasting joy [Music] and sorrow and morning [Music] foreign joy shall be upon there is [Music] [Music] therefore [Music] and everlasting joy shall be upon their head therefore i have anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows everlasting joy showing you who you are in him tearing the seals back so that you could see yourself in the book no longer a sealed book not just the bible but the eternal book the eternal redemptive purpose of god all that he had in his mind made known through the scriptures now made known you are what it's all about hallelujah you're not just a church you're not just betrothed anymore you've come into union with the word that you could have a joy that no one else knew let's bow our heads together jesus knew he was the word [Music] jesus walked by perfect faith in that word [Music] nobody could rob jesus of his joy you are the word that's been called to manifest in this age that's what the mysteries have been that have been revealed to show us who we are oh praise be to god what a revelation unlike any other revelation it's not a churchianity it's not a greater holiness it's not a extreme puritanism it's a reality of a relationship with jesus christ that goes back before the garden of eden that's the reality if you're here tonight as our heads are bowed our eyes are closed whether here or somewhere else you haven't entered into this relationship that's there for you [Music] why did you just say lift your hand lift your heart whatever you feel yourself why don't you as we pray you just commit yourself to christ say lord take me beyond earthly thinking let me become a mystic to the world fill me with your word until joy and a peace that passes all understanding moves through my life heavenly father as we as we struggle in this world [Music] lord when you are on the earth the scripture records that you endured the contradiction of sinners or you endured the unbelief that was constantly being hurled at you but you stood in the word standing for what the word said you are lord as we stand in these last days lord i was reading about the little girl that brother branham talked about the young lady that was betrothed to the rich man's son and how that lord she forgot her wedding garments ready and lord the others snickered at her they laughed at her they tried to tell her it's not like you think it is but she believed and he came for her at the appointed time the world is trying to tell the bride it's not like you think it is but we believe lord the church might say all these people in this so-called message they don't know what they're talking about but we believe lord we've seen your vindication we've seen what you sent us and we believe there might be a few out of all those that are in the book but lord we're the few that are waiting with our garments unsoiled by the world washed in the water of the word quickened by the power of your resurrection standing in the strength that is yours alone though we are weak your strength is made perfect in our weakness we commit our lives to you we commit this service to you we ask lord you go with us now as we go our way as we go to our homes as the people turn off their their internet connections lord and ponder the things that you have spoken tonight may it strike a deep resonating cord within their heart that they are the one that you are coming for they're that one that you sent this message for they're the one that you're revealing unveiling yourself to we commit each one to you lord we ask your blessing now upon each life may you just go with each one may your faith drop into each heart may sickness flee away may sorrow and mourning flee away o god lord may the heaviness
