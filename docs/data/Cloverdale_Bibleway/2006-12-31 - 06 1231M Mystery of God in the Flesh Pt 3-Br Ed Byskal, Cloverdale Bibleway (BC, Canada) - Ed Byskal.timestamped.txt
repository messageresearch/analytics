[8:50] today is guilt. People are guilty. They
[8:53] feel guilty for the things they've done
[8:54] in their life. God washed it away. He
[8:57] doesn't remember it anymore. We should

[15:18] Amen. Lord, we believe your word this

[15:22] Lord Jesus, we believe you are here in
[15:24] our midst, oh God.
[15:27] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you,
[15:29] Father. We've got a number of requests
[15:31] here this morning we want to take before
[15:33] the throne of grace. I'm going to ask
[15:34] brother Ernie
[15:36] if you'd come and lead us before the
[15:38] throne. There's a request we pray for an
[15:41] elder elderly couple in Lynon. Uh it's
[15:45] by the names of Jean and Jean. Um a wife
[15:49] is suffering from Alzheimer's and they
[15:51] are having to sell their property. They
[15:53] have lived on for over 50 years. And
[15:56] because they're Jehovah's Witnesses,
[15:57] they don't go to the doctor. they can't
[15:59] go to the doctor. So, just requesting we
[16:02] remember them in prayer this morning
[16:03] that God would speak to them, work out
[16:05] the situation for them. There's a
[16:07] request from a brother Milco for uh Mr.
[16:10] and Mrs. Hoffner in Bogan, Germany. My
[16:15] brother-in-law's uh neighbors and uh
[16:19] Johanna and brother Milco stayed in
[16:21] their house for a week after Johanna's
[16:23] mother passed away. They're both plagued
[16:25] with diabetes, very serious. And they
[16:27] know that the believers around the world
[16:29] are praying for them. The Milco sent
[16:31] them uh German Bibles and message books
[16:34] and CDs in the German language. They're
[16:36] very open to the gospel. We want to
[16:37] remember them this morning. Pray that
[16:39] God would touch them. Um uh brother Todd
[16:43] and Sister Faith Neighbor requesting
[16:45] prayer for an elderly neighbor of
[16:47] theirs. Uh we want to remember brother
[16:49] Mike Cosalino this morning requesting
[16:52] prayer that his stolen vehicle would be
[16:54] would be stolen. Brother Mike, I know,
[16:56] is uh diligent to pick up another number
[16:59] of people in his van every Sunday
[17:01] morning and bring him to the service and
[17:03] we want to just pray that the Lord would
[17:05] have brother Mike's vehicle returned for
[17:07] him. Amen. Also, sister Lan is at home
[17:10] sick was requesting that the Lord would
[17:13] give her the faith to receive her
[17:14] healing. How many have a need this
[17:16] morning that want to be remembered in
[17:17] prayer? Amen. And and if you're
[17:19] listening in on the internet this
[17:20] morning and have a need, you just bring
[17:22] it before the Lord as we go to be before
[17:24] the throne of grace. Whether any
[17:29] pray,
[17:31] [Music]
[17:36] we come before you this morning
[17:38] with hearts that are thankful
[17:41] for the many blessings that you send our
[17:44] way on a daily basis.
[17:47] Lord, we thank you for the sanctuary
[17:49] that we can come to and Lord, how you
[17:54] have anointed the gifts,
[17:57] Lord, the song leaders and the
[17:59] musicians, Lord, to bring us into that
[18:01] place of worship and that we may praise
[18:05] you, Lord, and that we may we may honor
[18:08] you for who you are.
[18:12] Lord, we thank you for the supernatural
[18:14] intelligence that you have sent our way,
[18:17] for the ability to hear and to to see
[18:20] into another realm, Lord, to know that
[18:23] that this message has come to take the
[18:26] fear off of the people and as brother
[18:28] Rod said, to give us an opportunity for
[18:30] guilt-free living. Lord, how thankful we
[18:34] are.
[18:35] Lord, our our our our desires, our
[18:38] motives, our goals, our ambitions.
[18:40] Everything about our life has changed
[18:43] since coming into contact with the
[18:46] message of Malachi 4. Lord, how
[18:49] privileged we are. And Lord, with that
[18:52] privilege comes a a great opportunity
[18:54] and a great responsibility and a great
[18:56] accountability.
[18:58] Lord, we we have great joy in our hearts
[19:01] for what you have done for us. But Lord,
[19:04] like Abraham, when when he heard about
[19:06] Lot, he wanted to do everything he could
[19:08] to restore Lot. And there are many out
[19:10] there, Lord, that are still trapped.
[19:12] Lord, I pray that we would be able to
[19:15] reach out to them. Lord, a country like
[19:17] China,
[19:19] over a billion people, 1.4 billion
[19:22] people, hundreds of millions have never
[19:24] heard the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God,
[19:27] there must be there must be a way that
[19:30] that that you have for getting the
[19:32] message into these places in India.
[19:35] Father, Lord, we we commit ourselves to
[19:39] you to do all that we can to fulfill
[19:40] that great commission. And now, Lord,
[19:42] for these requests that have been pinned
[19:45] down, Lord, for this uh the Hoffnner
[19:48] family, oh God, that brother Milco has
[19:52] has asked to be remembered in prayer.
[19:56] Lord, I pray that you would open their
[19:58] eyes. Brother Milco has been diligent,
[20:01] Lord, to apply the token, to send the
[20:03] materials. Lord, let that material be
[20:06] like fire in their hands, Lord. fire in
[20:09] their hearts, Father, to illuminate them
[20:11] and to quicken them, to energize them,
[20:14] Lord, to see that that God is moving in
[20:17] their hearts. Father, for Sister Lana at
[20:21] home sick today, Lord, Lord, we pray
[20:23] that you would bless our sister, that
[20:25] you would raise her up in newness of
[20:27] life, Father, let every
[20:30] every germ or every bacteria, Lord,
[20:32] whatever it is that that is affecting
[20:34] her body, Lord, let it be annihilated.
[20:37] Let it be sent back to where it comes
[20:39] from and rise her up in into perfect
[20:41] supernatural health. And Lord, for this
[20:44] family and Lyndon, oh God, Lord, to be
[20:47] in a a system that doesn't allow them to
[20:49] go to doctors and Lord, to be afflicted
[20:52] with this Alzheimer's disease, Lord,
[20:55] only only you can move upon that
[20:58] situation. Man man is lost when it comes
[21:01] to this disease. But Lord, you are the
[21:04] great physician. You can take whatever's
[21:06] whatever's wrong in that mind and you
[21:09] can take it and turn around and and make
[21:11] it right, Father, and put them on the
[21:13] right track for salvation.
[21:17] And Lord, for brother Mike Castelino,
[21:19] Father, our gallant brother, Lord, who
[21:21] who continues to go the extra mile all
[21:24] the time. Father, I pray that you would
[21:26] bring his vehicle back. I pray Lord that
[21:29] whoever whoever has it Lord would
[21:32] abandon it and and that it would be
[21:33] found by the police and it would be
[21:36] brought back and it would be brought
[21:37] back without damage
[21:40] &gt;&gt; and that brother Mike would be able to
[21:41] rejoice knowing that God has moved upon
[21:45] the scene for them. And uh one more uh
[21:51] [Music]
[21:57] like to also pray for brother Jim Log,
[21:59] Father, down in Florida. Lord, the
[22:01] doctors have not given him much hope.
[22:04] Father, a demon of cancer has stricken
[22:08] his body. It's been a long fight for
[22:10] him. And God, he needs a miracle in his
[22:14] life.
[22:15] He's been such a gallant soldier. I
[22:17] pray, Lord, that you would move upon the
[22:19] scene. I pray that you would anoint
[22:21] faith in his heart, Lord, that he would
[22:24] be able to feel that quickening power
[22:27] and be able to rise up in newness of
[22:30] life. Lord, you are the high priest of
[22:32] our confession, sitting at the right
[22:33] hand of majesty, waiting to make good
[22:36] every promise that you have signed with
[22:39] your blood, Father. And Lord, we call
[22:42] for for for for the blood of Jesus
[22:44] Christ to have its impact upon brother
[22:47] Jim's life. Raise him up in newness of
[22:49] life, Father. Lord, I pray you'd bless
[22:51] Brother Tony and Sister Rebecca away on
[22:53] the mission field, Father. Lord, I pray
[22:56] that you would guide them like a like a
[22:58] heat seeeking missile to the saints of
[23:00] God that you want them to meet. Let them
[23:02] have a great victory, Lord. and for
[23:05] brother Ed Lord coming to minister this
[23:07] morning. I pray Lord for for you to be
[23:11] able to give him a liberty and a freedom
[23:13] and an anointing Lord. Let him come to
[23:15] the pulpit. Let him get right into that
[23:17] channel, right into that stream of
[23:19] consciousness that that that you have
[23:21] led him into, Father. And let us be
[23:24] brought into that stream of
[23:25] consciousness, Father. And Lord, we ask
[23:27] all these blessings in your precious
[23:29] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[30:55] are worthy.
[30:58] For you are
[31:02] worthy.
[31:05] For you are
[31:09] worthy.
[31:13] Christ
[31:16] the Lord
[31:19] will give you all the glory.
[31:26] We give you all the glory.
[31:33] We give you all the glory.
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] Christ
[31:44] the Lord.
[31:47] I adore you.
[31:51] Lamb of glory,
[31:54] I adore you.
[31:58] Blessed,
[32:02] I adore you.
[32:05] Lord and father,
[32:09] I adore you.
[32:11] [Applause]
[32:12] Holy one,
[32:16] I adore you.
[32:20] Holy one.
[32:25] [Applause]
[32:43] Praise God.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning?
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:49] I always enjoy watching the children.
[32:52] Praise the Lord. Amen. We're going to
[32:56] turn now to uh turn the service to
[32:58] brother Bisco. We have a baby dedication
[33:00] this morning. And uh just as brother Ed
[33:03] comes and brother John and sister
[33:05] Vanessa come as well, let's sing
[33:07] together. I am so glad that our father
[33:09] in heaven tells of his love in the book
[33:13] he has given.
[33:18] I am so glad that our father in heaven
[33:23] tells of his love in the book he has
[33:27] given
[33:28] wonderful things in the Bible I see.
[33:33] This is the dearest that Jesus loves me.
[33:38] Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[33:43] Jesus loves me.
[33:46] Jesus loves me.
[33:49] I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[33:54] Jesus loves even me. The fourth verse.
[33:59] Jesus loves me and I know I love him.
[34:03] Love brought him down my soul full to
[34:07] redeem.
[34:08] Yes, it was love made him die on that
[34:12] tree. Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves
[34:17] me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves
[34:22] me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh,
[34:28] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[34:34] loves even me.
[34:37] Oh, if one should ask of me, how can I
[34:41] tell? Glory to Jesus. I know very well.
[34:48] God's Holy Spirit with my dust agree.
[34:53] Constantly witnessing Jesus loves me.
[34:57] Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[35:02] Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me.
[35:08] Are you a glad that Jesus loves me?
[35:12] Jesus loves me.
[35:16] God bless you.
[35:19] Hallelujah.
[35:22] Nice to see such a
[35:25] family as this. our brother John and
[35:29] sister Vanessa Kirk
[35:32] wanting to dedicate their latest arrival
[35:38] and her name is Anna
[35:41] Ruth.
[35:43] I've been calling her Anna Grace all the
[35:46] time because Anna stands for Grace.
[35:49] So I thought when I get up here I must
[35:52] be able to say Anna Ruth. I certainly
[35:55] cannot forget the name Ruth,
[35:58] can we?
[36:01] I think it's a a wonderful choice.
[36:08] The uh the scripture says a verse that
[36:12] you know so well and we all know train
[36:15] up a child in the way
[36:18] that he should go and when he's old he
[36:22] will not depart from it.
[36:24] And I was uh pondering yesterday very
[36:28] much standing here with you, Sister
[36:31] Vanessa, Brother John,
[36:33] and I know that
[36:36] they as a couple and as a father and a
[36:38] mother are prepared emotionally,
[36:43] prepared,
[36:45] I believe,
[36:46] materially,
[36:49] and we all want to be and feel as though
[36:52] we are prepared spiritually.
[36:55] to give to the child what it will need.
[37:00] But because we don't know what the
[37:02] future holds,
[37:04] we have to just resolve within our
[37:06] hearts that we ourselves will be
[37:09] prepared for whatever this child needs,
[37:13] especially spiritually.
[37:15] And in thinking about that,
[37:18] I thought of children. And I always
[37:20] marvel,
[37:22] which I did just recently
[37:24] when I am in another country. I marvel
[37:28] how those little ones are are speaking
[37:31] so fluently a foreign language,
[37:34] but they pick up and as you as parents
[37:36] that are here know, children learn
[37:39] largely by observation.
[37:43] and what they hear. And brother Brham
[37:46] even said the little ones that called
[37:49] Elisha old baldhead.
[37:52] He said they heard it at around the
[37:54] dinner table,
[37:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing what they pick up. So
[37:59] what this child, Brother John, sister
[38:01] Vanessa,
[38:03] it will learn by observation. It will
[38:05] learn by what it's heard. it will learn
[38:09] mostly by the example of the parents and
[38:13] this is this is an incredible thing. So
[38:15] the scripture can say train up a child
[38:18] in the way that it should go. But that
[38:20] training I would say is much more
[38:24] effectual
[38:26] by our lives than it is by our words
[38:30] because we can we can say it and say it
[38:32] and say it, but eventually the child is
[38:35] going to really do what we do.
[38:39] And so I want to say to you, brother
[38:41] John and sister Vanessa,
[38:45] because you have infinitely more time
[38:47] with them. And perhaps Vanessa, you will
[38:49] have more time with Anna Ruth than John
[38:53] will. And both of you will have much
[38:54] more time than we will or I will or the
[38:58] church or the minister will.
[39:00] So I would like to say to you that pave
[39:03] the way
[39:06] before her by your example.
[39:09] And brother Brandham tells uh he tells
[39:11] an account of a shepherd
[39:14] going down. He saw the shepherd going
[39:17] down a marketplace. And he said he had a
[39:20] string of sheep behind him about a block
[39:24] long.
[39:26] and and on the marketplace was produce
[39:29] and all kinds of things which could have
[39:30] attracted them. But the shepherd just
[39:33] kept walking and they just kept walking
[39:35] in a single file one right after the
[39:37] other after the other. They ignored
[39:39] everything else because the shepherd was
[39:41] just going in that one direction. And so
[39:44] I would say to you two, you are the
[39:46] you're the shepherd for this little one.
[39:49] And if you follow just along on a
[39:51] straight line, this little one's going
[39:54] to follow along the way. And then you
[39:56] know well the story of the man it was
[39:58] Christmas
[40:00] and he wasn't a man that drank but he
[40:02] did go and see some colleagues and they
[40:05] enticed him to have a little to drink
[40:07] and of course he wasn't accustomed to
[40:09] it. So on the way home he staggered all
[40:12] over the place and this boy got way
[40:14] behind him and he said why did you take
[40:17] so long? He said well I was trying to
[40:19] follow in your footsteps. So, we want to
[40:22] leave footsteps that are easy to walk
[40:24] in. Footsteps that will lead this life
[40:28] to Christ.
[40:30] Amen.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Anna Ruth,
[40:35] we're going to dedicate her to the Lord
[40:36] Jesus Christ.
[40:40] And Jesus took them up in his arms. And
[40:42] I'm a poor representation of him, but
[40:45] she's a sweet little one.
[40:48] We'll pray. Heavenly Father,
[40:51] this lovely gift that you have given to
[40:53] our brother John and sister Vanessa, and
[40:56] they so desire to raise her, to raise
[41:00] her so that her footsteps will follow in
[41:02] the footsteps of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[41:04] the great shepherd. But she will be
[41:07] following along in the footsteps of her
[41:09] mother and her father. And I pray, oh
[41:12] God, you will endure, Brother John and
[41:14] Sister Vanessa, with that spiritual
[41:16] leadership.
[41:17] That they will lead by example, that
[41:20] they will lead by their conversation,
[41:22] that they will lead, oh God, by the
[41:25] environment and the atmosphere of their
[41:27] home. And as you have given this one who
[41:30] they have called Anna Ruth to them,
[41:33] they're standing here today before this
[41:35] company of witnesses to dedicate her to
[41:39] the Lord's service. And as a prophet
[41:42] would so many times even with the little
[41:44] girls would dedicate them to the service
[41:47] of the Lord. I dedicate Anna Ruth to the
[41:50] service of the Lord. And I pray, oh God,
[41:52] that as her name implies, father,
[41:57] grace
[41:59] and friendship, and may her life exude
[42:03] both of those. I pray in the name of
[42:06] Jesus Christ, your hand will be upon her
[42:09] in a special way from this day on. May
[42:13] there be something angelic about her
[42:15] nature. I pray, Father, you'll keep her
[42:17] in good health and make her a blessing
[42:20] and a joy to this family in the name of
[42:23] Jesus Christ.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:32] She's a perfect peace.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Vanessa.
[42:40] God bless you, dear.
[42:43] Bless you. God bless you, brother John.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:48] Isn't that lovely?
[42:51] I think of the scripture so often. And
[42:53] he took them up in his arms and blessed
[42:56] them.
[42:57] Our Lord Jesus had the time. Brother
[43:00] Ernie, it's so good to see you. And
[43:05] that phone call the other day really
[43:07] fired me up. And I told the people
[43:10] sounded to me like you might immigrate
[43:12] to China.
[43:14] So, we're anxious to hear about those
[43:16] things and we'll have to arrange that
[43:19] very soon. Uh, I'm so thankful for
[43:24] the witness of the ministry.
[43:28] Tonight, we will be having a a watch
[43:30] night service starting at 9:00 as
[43:32] brother Rod has already announced.
[43:35] But I have just felt in my heart that
[43:38] this year will be a year that we will
[43:41] celebrate the whole year as a year of
[43:44] witness.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; The message has been going now for over
[43:48] 40 years, a generation
[43:51] and the effect of it has been so
[43:54] powerful
[43:56] around the globe. We will be hearing uh
[44:00] a lot of that as we focus and come on
[44:02] down towards July when we will be having
[44:06] and hosting a whole week July 1st to
[44:09] July the 8th of a international
[44:13] convention and be tying together with
[44:16] congregations the Lord willing
[44:18] throughout the world with brethren I've
[44:21] even been meeting with them this last
[44:23] week uh getting all of things in place
[44:27] so that congregations will be able to
[44:30] tie together with us in other parts of
[44:33] the world and join in on the convention
[44:36] or some aspects of the convention. But I
[44:40] want to take the opportunity today
[44:43] to thank the ministry
[44:46] uh that is in this congregation and has
[44:49] gone out from this congregation.
[44:51] I'm very very deeply
[44:54] indebted and appreciate the brethren. I
[44:58] know their lives, the time they spend
[45:01] before the Lord in prayer and study and
[45:04] I know that you appreciate it. I want to
[45:06] just express my appreciation for the
[45:10] deacons and they, you know, they labor
[45:13] sacrificially.
[45:15] They miss much of the meetings which
[45:17] they would like to be in because they
[45:18] have to tend to other things and they're
[45:21] just so faithful and I appreciate them.
[45:25] And the trustees of the congregation,
[45:28] they're diligent. They are uh they they
[45:31] deal with the matters of the church as
[45:34] it would be their own and under uh under
[45:38] the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And I'm
[45:41] so thankful to God that uh the the the
[45:48] I won't say the power of God, but I will
[45:50] say that the care of the great shepherd,
[45:54] the Lord Jesus, has led us in footsteps
[45:58] and has led us in a path. So the church
[46:02] has continued to be healthy financially
[46:06] and whatever God called on us to do that
[46:10] there was always the resources to do it.
[46:13] That to me is a incredible blessing. You
[46:18] have never had in over 30 years have we
[46:21] ever stood at the pulpit and begged for
[46:24] money or offerings or whatever. We've
[46:28] never had to put out gimmicks or you
[46:31] know whatever uh other people perhaps do
[46:34] or other churches. We don't believe in
[46:37] it and God has always provided. I want
[46:40] to thank you for your uh faithfulness
[46:44] and your giving pro and providing
[46:47] because and your trust that uh between
[46:51] myself and the trustees you would uh
[46:54] have confidence that it would be given
[46:57] in the right direction and to and to
[47:00] achieve the right goals and I am
[47:03] thankful that so thankful to God that
[47:06] from the congregation and your
[47:08] faithfulness
[47:09] Uh we have been able to send the message
[47:12] as a witness
[47:14] uh to many places around the globe and
[47:17] today brother Tony and sister Rebecca
[47:20] are away and I I I wish them God's speed
[47:24] and God's protection. They will be in
[47:27] places you want to be praying for them.
[47:29] They will be in places that are not
[47:32] necessarily not as safe as where you are
[47:35] today. We need they need to be wise as
[47:38] serpents and harmless as doves in the
[47:41] countries some of the countries that
[47:43] they are in. I am so thankful for the
[47:48] Bible believers and the missions and uh
[47:51] and all of the
[47:54] one of the outstanding characteristics
[47:56] I'm just going to take a few moments but
[47:57] one of the outstanding characteristics
[48:00] with Bible believers has been and Bible
[48:02] believers in incidentally is not some
[48:04] institution it is simply a conduit
[48:08] people you people give people from
[48:11] elsewhere give and they have confidence
[48:14] because I get I hear it all the time
[48:16] from people from many other places. They
[48:20] say we see uh what you do and we and the
[48:24] and the one outstanding characteristic
[48:26] is we have not engaged in shotgun
[48:31] efforts that boom a great big you know
[48:34] going to do big thing and then boom and
[48:36] it just uh you know 6 months from now
[48:39] you can't see it but we just kind of a
[48:42] door is open so we move in cautiously
[48:46] review it have a look at it see what the
[48:48] need is see if God raises up God called
[48:52] men in the country because we go back to
[48:55] the scripture and back to the message
[48:57] that the pastors in the country are
[49:00] sovereign. And so we see what God has
[49:03] placed in the hearts of the men that's
[49:05] in the country. And then we see that God
[49:08] raises up solid men, men of the word,
[49:11] men of prayer, men of leadership. And
[49:15] then we move under their opaces. What do
[49:18] you have? What is the burden for the
[49:20] country? And then in one country it'll
[49:23] be one thing, another country it'll be
[49:25] another. So we just try to move
[49:27] alongside of them honoring their burden
[49:30] and their vision and then God begins to
[49:34] prosper the work in the country. So we
[49:36] never go in for the short term. It's
[49:39] always the long term. And one of the
[49:41] longest has been uh India. Other
[49:45] countries where God has allowed us to
[49:47] have uh a fruitful endeavor. They have
[49:52] been countries where
[49:54] once the work was started and they saw
[49:57] how it was done, they took it over
[49:59] themselves. And we just think that is uh
[50:01] that's God's way. We're so thankful for
[50:04] that. And we could just enumerate the
[50:06] countries, but I won't bother doing that
[50:08] today. But and then there are other
[50:11] places like India for example where it's
[50:13] needed constant care and we've been
[50:15] there almost uh 26 years in India and
[50:20] every single month there's never been a
[50:23] month in 26 years that the message books
[50:26] have not rolled off the presses and been
[50:28] distributed to the people and it just
[50:31] increases more and more. I say praise be
[50:33] to God. We are we are at our post of
[50:36] duty doing whatever we're supposed to do
[50:40] and when this life is over and it will
[50:43] be either in the change of the body and
[50:46] the resurrection. And I said just
[50:48] yesterday to my wife, I hope I live to
[50:50] see that. I just want to experience the
[50:53] rapture so bad. I want to see this old
[50:56] body defeat death while I'm walking on
[50:59] the earth. I want to see that so bad.
[51:01] and uh and but in the meantime, we'll
[51:04] just remain faithful. We'll remain
[51:05] steadfast on our post of duty. So, it
[51:08] isn't doing some big thing. It's just
[51:10] everyday living for God. Everyday
[51:13] living. And so, I'm so thankful for the
[51:16] missions. I I want to uh show uh express
[51:22] special thanks to our Sunday school and
[51:26] the teachers
[51:28] uh the children singing. Isn't it
[51:30] lovely? hear them singing and to all who
[51:33] work in in that in that endeavor and
[51:37] also to the school uh Bible way
[51:40] Christian Academy and to the principal
[51:43] and the teachers. God bless you and may
[51:47] the blessings of God through the Holy
[51:50] Spirit guide. I don't look on the school
[51:53] as being something of of a natural
[51:57] realm. To me, it's a great spiritual
[51:59] realm, and Satan would fight that with
[52:02] everything he can, but we are in support
[52:04] of it. And I I believe that it they're
[52:07] going to be having probably the greatest
[52:10] year they've ever had this coming year.
[52:13] I look forward to to expanding to uh the
[52:17] ninth grade and then on from there as
[52:20] well. So, God bless the school. I would
[52:23] like to ask God's blessing and your
[52:26] remembrance of all the people that are
[52:28] involved to make these services. To
[52:31] those of you that are on the internet,
[52:34] we so appreciate the notes, the emails
[52:37] that come on the internet. They come
[52:40] every week on the internet. There's a
[52:43] even a small group that's gathering.
[52:45] They've been some scattered families in
[52:48] Switzerland. And I say, "God bless you
[52:51] that are in Switzerland and streaming
[52:53] the meeting. This morning's meeting is
[52:55] an evening service for them." And they
[52:58] have said, you know, we were individual
[53:00] families, but we decided once a month we
[53:02] will get together in a home and perhaps
[53:05] 15 to 20 of the people there are joining
[53:08] in the service with us this morning. and
[53:10] from very many other places uh generally
[53:14] around
[53:16] 130, 140, 160 up to close to 200
[53:20] locations where people are are are
[53:23] joining with us. I want to say God bless
[53:26] them. God bless them. for those that uh
[53:30] make the music possible and uh uh labor
[53:35] in that. It's a lot of labor, not just
[53:37] here playing on the platform, but being
[53:41] with those that are singing. And worship
[53:43] is a big thing. And I I like to maintain
[53:46] it as worship to the Lord.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; We never want to go towards the
[53:51] direction of entertainment, but we
[53:54] should enjoy worship and we should join
[53:56] in worship. And I believe it's something
[53:58] that the people do. I want to I want to
[54:01] thank all the musicians for their
[54:03] dedication and the people that are in
[54:05] the sound and the people are in the
[54:07] video and those that are working right
[54:09] now to see that the internet people can
[54:12] hear. There's just a lot of people
[54:15] throughout throughout the whole uh those
[54:17] that sit up in the cubbies and translate
[54:20] the languages even as we're speaking
[54:23] now. I say God bless them. They don't
[54:25] have the same opportunity of enjoying
[54:28] the service perhaps as we do, but they
[54:30] are doing a service to the Lord and the
[54:33] Lord will bless them for it. Amen. I
[54:36] believe this is going to be a mighty
[54:37] year of witness.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for, you know, and we I I've
[54:48] mentioned a couple times, but we're
[54:49] moving towards doing a DVD that's going
[54:53] to get out into the Hutterite colonies.
[54:56] And, you know, maybe it doesn't mean
[54:58] anything to you, and I don't know what
[55:00] it even means to some of the people that
[55:01] came from the colonies, but and I've
[55:03] never lived on a colony, but I'd like to
[55:06] shake them to their roots.
[55:08] I'd like to shake them so violently that
[55:11] it just shake people right out of there.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Well, what if they're not
[55:17] predestinated to believers? I'd like to
[55:19] shake them out anyway."
[55:22] &gt;&gt; You would? Yes.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Shake them out to a life of freedom.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand all that. And
[55:30] I want to thank our office staff and
[55:33] volunteers. You know, every Sunday,
[55:35] every Sunday, every service, there's
[55:38] young sisters go in there and volunteer
[55:39] and take the calls from people who maybe
[55:42] are sick and can't be on the phone. Uh
[55:45] they can't be in the service, so they're
[55:46] on the phone hookup. And somebody has to
[55:48] look after that and manage that. And we
[55:50] have sisters here that we hardly ever
[55:52] say a word about it, but God bless the
[55:55] young sisters and those that labor and
[55:57] do everything. We're just thankful
[55:59] &gt;&gt; for the work of God. And tonight we're
[56:02] going to have a wonderful time. There's
[56:04] going to be not only some special
[56:06] saying, but there's going to be some uh
[56:08] we're going to have some selected
[56:10] testimonies tonight of things that have
[56:13] been remarkable in my view in this last
[56:17] year. Absolutely remarkable. And we're
[56:20] going to hear more about it tonight from
[56:22] a number of individuals. Isn't he good?
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So wonderful to have
[56:28] our brother Eddie and sister Jean
[56:30] Watkins.
[56:32] You stood, they stood and you welcomed
[56:34] them. But they're they're old friends.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; We We've been around a long time,
[56:43] haven't we, Brother Eddie? Sister Jane.
[56:45] We're so happy that they've been here to
[56:47] spend these days. Brother and sister
[56:49] Andes have been here with us as well.
[56:51] God bless them. And all you that are
[56:53] visiting. Well, uh, the service is not
[56:57] till 9:00 tonight. Doesn't mean I'm
[56:59] taking more time, but I I thought we
[57:02] didn't have to be in a big rush. God
[57:04] bless you all. Why don't we just stand
[57:06] and I would like to maybe just sing a a
[57:09] a chorus or two.
[57:12] Um,
[57:16] I'm going to sing probably what we're
[57:18] going to close with. Linda,
[57:22] Joanne, Ken. These three here have been
[57:25] here a long time.
[57:28] Linda's almost a a fixture that piano.
[57:33] Probably 30 years.
[57:35] That's a long time,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; isn't it?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:42] All right, we're making room for some
[57:45] more. Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; That's saying many things about
[57:48] tomorrow. I don't seem to understand.
[57:51] But I know one thing. Hallelujah.
[57:55] We know who holds tomorrow, don't we?
[57:57] And I know that he holds our hand. All
[57:59] right.
[58:01] Many things
[58:04] about tomorrow.
[58:09] I see
[58:12] I understand
[58:16] my
[58:27] Oh my
[58:31] [Music]
[58:35] god.
[58:56] Close my hand.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to sing it once more.
[59:00] But before we do, I want you to think
[59:03] about tomorrow
[59:06] and what not what you know about
[59:08] tomorrow cuz it's not very much. But
[59:11] it's what you don't know and what could
[59:13] happen. It could be great and wonderful
[59:17] things happen. It could be
[59:20] some great sadness. Your home, your life
[59:24] could be torn to shreds. Before
[59:27] the sun rises in the morning, the bottom
[59:30] could drop out. That's when you got to
[59:33] know, I know he holds my hand.
[59:36] Hallelujah. I'm interested in stability.
[59:40] I'm interested in something that is
[59:42] continuing. I'm interested in eternity.
[59:45] Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want you to sing it
[59:48] with that full consciousness.
[59:51] I also want to welcome in a special way,
[59:55] Brother Nathaniel Iverson's father,
[59:57] Brother Hank Iverson and his wife. God
[1:00:00] bless you. Haven't even had a chance to
[1:00:02] visit with them yet and we want to do
[1:00:03] that.
[1:00:05] Sister Iverson
[1:00:07] is brother Von Hayes daughter. Brother
[1:00:10] Von Hayes who pastored ministered over
[1:00:12] 40 years

[1:01:39] today that we can stand here as your
[1:01:42] children
[1:01:44] and declare that our confidence and
[1:01:47] trust is in you.
[1:01:50] This world is a moving shifting sands
[1:01:54] and we cannot build upon it but we can
[1:01:58] build upon the solid rock Jesus Christ.
[1:02:02] Oh, and our our confidence, our trust is
[1:02:06] and faith is in you. And we're here
[1:02:09] today at the post of duty. Each one
[1:02:11] standing at their post of duty. Everyone
[1:02:14] has a special task that they've been
[1:02:17] called upon to live in this life. And
[1:02:21] the very special one is to be an
[1:02:23] expression of Jesus Christ. Help us now,
[1:02:26] Father, as we come to the word. I pray
[1:02:30] Lord
[1:02:31] publicly as I prayed privately you will
[1:02:34] anoint me oh God that it will reach the
[1:02:38] hearts of the people and may the word
[1:02:40] come out oh father the way it was just
[1:02:42] made real to myself may the message beh
[1:02:47] a a bread from heaven I pray bless this
[1:02:50] congregation oh God in the name of Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ and the congregation that's
[1:02:55] invisible at this moment I pray Father,
[1:02:59] as we present ourselves now, you will
[1:03:02] illuminate us by the Holy Spirit in the
[1:03:06] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to take your
[1:03:12] Bibles to Romans the 5th chapter
[1:03:18] and we'll begin reading at verse 12.
[1:03:44] Wherefore,
[1:03:46] as by one man sin entered into the
[1:03:48] world, and death by sin, and so death
[1:03:53] passed upon all men.
[1:03:56] For that all have sinned.
[1:03:59] For until the law sin was in the world,
[1:04:03] but sin is not imputed when there is no
[1:04:06] law. Nevertheless, death reigned from
[1:04:10] Adam to Moses, even over them that had
[1:04:15] not sinned after the simultude
[1:04:19] of Adam's transgression.
[1:04:22] who is the figure of him that was to
[1:04:25] come. Like you to notice verse 14.
[1:04:29] Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to
[1:04:33] Moses, even over them that had not
[1:04:36] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[1:04:39] transgression,
[1:04:40] who is the figure of him that was to
[1:04:44] come. So the scripture is very clear.
[1:04:47] There was no law until Moses.
[1:04:51] But sin passed upon all even if there
[1:04:54] was no law and and the law came and then
[1:04:58] and sin but sin is not imputed where
[1:05:02] there is no law. So then when the law
[1:05:04] came and God gave a law that the people
[1:05:07] could in no wise keep and therefore they
[1:05:10] became under condemnation and guilty and
[1:05:14] sin was imputed to them. All right. Uh,
[1:05:17] just a couple more verses. Turn to 2
[1:05:19] Corinthians 3:18,
[1:05:24] which reads, "But we all with open face,
[1:05:28] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:05:30] Lord, are changed into the same image
[1:05:34] from glory to glory, even as by the
[1:05:37] spirit of the Lord, the the image of
[1:05:40] Christ, the image of the sinless one."
[1:05:44] Colossians 3:10. I'll just read it. And
[1:05:47] have put on the new man which is renewed
[1:05:50] in knowledge after the image of him that
[1:05:54] created him. And Romans 8:29 that
[1:05:57] brother Ken Andes read on Wednesday when
[1:06:00] he spoke for whom he did forno he also
[1:06:04] did predestinate not we don't want to
[1:06:07] put a period there. He did predestinate
[1:06:10] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:06:14] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:06:16] many brethren. May God bless his word as
[1:06:19] you have your seats.
[1:06:27] Now you'll have to
[1:06:30] just resolve at the beginning to really
[1:06:33] keep your thoughts focused and don't be
[1:06:36] distracted in any way if at all
[1:06:38] possible.
[1:06:39] The message I'd like to bring to you is
[1:06:42] really in in three parts.
[1:06:46] I have in the last two services been
[1:06:50] speaking on the mystery of God in the
[1:06:53] flesh. Part one, part two, and now this
[1:06:56] is part three. The mystery of God in the
[1:06:58] flesh. This great mystery that Paul
[1:07:01] spoke of. Christ in you. Christ in you.
[1:07:05] Said it was the mystery, a great
[1:07:07] mystery, Christ in you, the hope of
[1:07:10] glory. I hope that today, I trust that
[1:07:12] today I'll be able to enlarge on that
[1:07:15] that God dwelling in flesh. But the
[1:07:18] three parts
[1:07:21] uh
[1:07:23] first I would like to just touch on as
[1:07:27] we have in the last two services mostly
[1:07:29] dwelt on it quite largely and that is
[1:07:33] the coming of Christ the first and
[1:07:35] second coming of Christ. The first
[1:07:37] coming and we're speaking of him because
[1:07:40] he is the restored image of God. Right.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; So the first coming we showed how he all
[1:07:49] the way down through the saints of the
[1:07:51] Old Testament. He's coming. He's coming.
[1:07:54] He's coming. And then when we we've just
[1:07:56] had the world has remembered the
[1:07:57] Christmas season and many uh I'm sure
[1:08:01] have read the genealogies of the
[1:08:03] scripture and the one genealogy in
[1:08:06] Matthew tracing Joseph's lineage and the
[1:08:09] one genealogy in Luke tracing Mary's
[1:08:13] lineage and uh and and both of those
[1:08:16] lineages trace back into the uh into the
[1:08:22] lineage of David. And Jesus is called
[1:08:26] the son of Abraham, the son of David.
[1:08:30] Uh and so now that was his first coming.
[1:08:34] How he was coming down down. It wasn't
[1:08:36] just he didn't just come when he was
[1:08:39] conceived in the womb of Mary. He didn't
[1:08:42] come just when he was born in a manger.
[1:08:45] He didn't come just when he started
[1:08:47] walking and preaching. That wasn't his
[1:08:50] first coming. That was the consummation
[1:08:52] of his first coming. But he was coming
[1:08:54] all the way down. God was descending
[1:08:57] descending down from the time he said
[1:09:00] from the time he said that the seed of
[1:09:03] the woman will bruise the serpent's
[1:09:05] head.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; From the time God spoke it and even in
[1:09:09] the mind of God before the foundation of
[1:09:11] the world, he would come. But actually
[1:09:14] when it was set into motion and that
[1:09:16] lineage came all the way down, God was
[1:09:20] coming down in the form of a man to be a
[1:09:24] kinsman redeemer. And then comes the New
[1:09:27] Testament and the spirit of God was in
[1:09:30] Christ now comes into the church
[1:09:33] corporate. You see the God was working
[1:09:37] corporate in the whole corporate body of
[1:09:41] a nation called Israel. But out of that
[1:09:44] came one a virgin and she conceived by
[1:09:50] the word and brought forth the corporal
[1:09:53] body Jesus Christ. Then the Holy Spirit
[1:09:58] came into the church. And then God was
[1:10:01] now in the corporal corporate body
[1:10:05] called the church or the body of Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ which the Bible also calls the
[1:10:10] bride of Jesus Christ. Christ is the
[1:10:13] groom and the bride comes out of the New
[1:10:16] Testament. And so it here's and and the
[1:10:20] second coming of Christ really if you
[1:10:24] read any history at all that's why many
[1:10:26] of the disciples thought Christ the the
[1:10:28] coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of
[1:10:30] Pentecost that that was the second
[1:10:33] coming because he had arrived. But they
[1:10:36] and they recognized then Jesus now began
[1:10:38] to manifest in the church. And some of
[1:10:41] them historically speaking thought that
[1:10:44] was the second coming. But he was coming
[1:10:46] on down on down then until a prophet
[1:10:48] would come in the end time and say as
[1:10:51] Christ the seed went into the ground so
[1:10:54] that his wife the church likewise died
[1:10:57] at Na Rome went into organizational
[1:11:01] systems and then came on down and come
[1:11:03] out in the reformation justification
[1:11:06] sanctification a restoration of the
[1:11:09] gifts baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:11:11] then in the end time come a messenger to
[1:11:15] show the whole picture what was
[1:11:17] happening, what is happening, and what
[1:11:20] has just to happen. And all of that
[1:11:22] through the New Testament is is a is a
[1:11:25] process, but it was Christ coming on
[1:11:27] down on down on down. And I took a quote
[1:11:30] last week where brother Brandon mentions
[1:11:32] Luther, he mentions Wesley, he says God
[1:11:35] in them. God was in them uh showing what
[1:11:39] he was doing in the whole age at the
[1:11:41] whole time. So now this is just a little
[1:11:44] summary. So that was number one. And
[1:11:47] number two in the part I I would like to
[1:11:50] show that in each case both in his first
[1:11:52] coming in the old testament era and in
[1:11:55] the new testament. Now you have to just
[1:11:57] when I talk about coming I'm breaking
[1:11:59] away from the customary
[1:12:02] uh uh view or perspective of
[1:12:05] Christianity is coming. I just want to
[1:12:08] break that issue for a few moments and
[1:12:10] so you can see that it's it's a whole
[1:12:12] era. God coming down, coming down,
[1:12:15] coming down. And in the first in the
[1:12:18] first uh Old Testament and listen real
[1:12:22] closely now because we're coming to a
[1:12:24] critical spot here and then I'll go and
[1:12:26] enlarge on it.
[1:12:29] Even though Matthew records Joseph's
[1:12:32] line lineage
[1:12:34] and Luke records
[1:12:38] Mary's lineage
[1:12:41] and even though it would say in Acts the
[1:12:43] 2 chapter
[1:12:45] speaking of David as being not only a
[1:12:49] king but said he was a prophet and God
[1:12:53] swearing to David that of the fruit of
[1:12:56] his loins and the scripture says after
[1:12:59] the flesh, God would raise up Christ.
[1:13:04] When you read that, you have to conclude
[1:13:08] Jesus was either the fruit of David's
[1:13:11] flesh or he was virgin born.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I say that he was virgin born. It was a
[1:13:18] new creation in the womb of Mary. But so
[1:13:22] and and brother Brennham comes along and
[1:13:24] says Jesus he never called his Mary his
[1:13:29] mother and yet there are a number of
[1:13:32] scriptures which we'll come to that says
[1:13:34] the mother of Christ blessed be the
[1:13:36] mother of my lord and so on and so
[1:13:39] forth. So now comes this critical point
[1:13:43] and that is that God
[1:13:46] being sovereign
[1:13:49] and God being who he is. God, what are
[1:13:54] we?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; We're just pieces of clay.
[1:14:00] except God who gave into into a man's
[1:14:05] body seed, sperm, and he also and that
[1:14:10] came by the word of God.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That came by the word of God.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; God created us that way.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And an egg and a field for the woman.
[1:14:22] God created that. So God's word that
[1:14:27] permits a human life to come that way.
[1:14:30] God knowing in his infinite wisdom that
[1:14:34] man would fall. He also he also had
[1:14:38] shall I say a higher law,
[1:14:42] a higher form of life than the human
[1:14:45] life. And that life also would be thy by
[1:14:49] the word of God. And where a human, a
[1:14:53] man and a woman would fall in Eden by
[1:14:57] disobedience, God would send out a seed,
[1:15:01] a spiritual seed that would not deny his
[1:15:05] word. And because because God being who
[1:15:08] he is, he is able to attribute
[1:15:12] attribute
[1:15:15] to an individual to account to an
[1:15:18] individual. he can attribute to that
[1:15:20] individual
[1:15:23] part of himself or his plan. And so
[1:15:27] while while David did not have a son as
[1:15:33] an everlasting son to sit on his
[1:15:35] kingdom, God attributed his son
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; to be that son
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; and accounted it to David's account.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Abraham. That's why God
[1:15:50] allowed Abraham and Sarah to become the
[1:15:53] age that they became so that their
[1:15:56] bodies could be dead and so that God
[1:15:59] could attribute the son that could not
[1:16:02] come out of Abraham's loins. He
[1:16:05] attributed his son that came out of his
[1:16:08] bosom as Abraham's son. And he allowed
[1:16:13] Abraham in his old age to turn youthful
[1:16:17] and bring forth a son so that son could
[1:16:20] be the type of his son.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; So this is just a summary. I want you to
[1:16:30] hang on to that. And in the New
[1:16:32] Testament, now in the Old Testament,
[1:16:37] they could not bring forth that natural
[1:16:40] life.
[1:16:41] couldn't bring it forth.
[1:16:44] Could not bring forth a life that could
[1:16:47] be a sacrifice.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; God had to do it by attribution. He had
[1:16:54] to attribute his son to Israel.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Out of Egypt have I called my son.
[1:17:00] Speaking of his son.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; All right. You follow that? Likewise, in
[1:17:05] the New Testament, even though people
[1:17:08] became filled with the Holy Ghost, they
[1:17:12] still remained afflicted as being humans
[1:17:16] with the human weakness. And there's no
[1:17:18] man, no woman that is able to live
[1:17:22] sufficiently and satisfactorily
[1:17:26] the life of Jesus Christ. Regardless of
[1:17:29] how how devoted they are, how holy they
[1:17:33] are, whatever they are, they know that
[1:17:36] there's something yet that is of of
[1:17:38] imperfection. And there isn't a person
[1:17:41] that I'm speaking to today that could
[1:17:43] raise their hands and say, "I'm
[1:17:45] absolutely more than satisfied with the
[1:17:48] expression of Jesus Christ in my life."
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And because we can't say that, God in
[1:17:55] the New Testament has taken and by
[1:17:59] attribution has attributed the
[1:18:02] perfection of Jesus Christ to the people
[1:18:06] that are his elected people. Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And then the then the third step is that
[1:18:12] God have sent down I want to use the
[1:18:16] word representation
[1:18:18] and brother Brandham uses it frequently
[1:18:21] representation.
[1:18:22] I was going to read John the 4th chapter
[1:18:25] the woman at the well.
[1:18:27] Brother Brandham said she had
[1:18:30] representation in heaven and the priest
[1:18:34] and by because she had representation.
[1:18:37] She said, "Thou art the Messiah. You're
[1:18:40] the prophet." And brother Brand said
[1:18:41] that's all she could see at that moment.
[1:18:43] That's all she could see that he was a
[1:18:45] prophet. But she was moving in the right
[1:18:47] direction. And then she said, "I know
[1:18:50] when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us
[1:18:52] all things. I that speak to thee am he."
[1:18:56] and she identified it, recognized it and
[1:18:59] the light struck the seed. She was born
[1:19:02] again and and and he said she did that
[1:19:06] because she had representation.
[1:19:08] Now the word representation
[1:19:11] and it has a a dual meaning and that is
[1:19:14] simply as we understand it in the
[1:19:16] English language. We can have uh in the
[1:19:20] United States I have in the government
[1:19:21] the house of representatives because
[1:19:23] those are men that are representing the
[1:19:26] people. So you can have people uh you
[1:19:29] can have a representative who's
[1:19:30] representing the people or we can we
[1:19:33] ourselves can be a representative. All
[1:19:36] right. So now it's not in the sense that
[1:19:39] we are representing something although
[1:19:41] we do but I don't want to h bring that
[1:19:44] into the message this morning. I want to
[1:19:47] bring it on from the other side.
[1:19:50] You can either represent or you can be
[1:19:53] in the state of being represented.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; See in one sense I represent our
[1:19:59] country. You represent your country. We
[1:20:01] represent our countries in but on the
[1:20:03] other hand we have somebody up there in
[1:20:06] our federal government I hope that's
[1:20:08] representing us. At least we trust us
[1:20:10] that way. See now we are here
[1:20:13] representing
[1:20:15] we're representing Christ.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; We are his representatives. That's
[1:20:19] that's on one hand. But I want to take
[1:20:21] it from the other side that we had
[1:20:24] representation
[1:20:25] in heaven before you were born.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Before the earth was created. There was
[1:20:31] a lamb that was slain. Why was the lamb
[1:20:33] slain? Because there was somebody was
[1:20:35] going to fall. There was somebody was
[1:20:37] going to be in sin. So God already
[1:20:39] provided a remedy before the sickness
[1:20:41] even arrived. That is that's the
[1:20:43] infinite wisdom of God. And so now here
[1:20:46] we are uh uh and I want to take it from
[1:20:50] the direction that we have
[1:20:52] representation. the woman at the well
[1:20:56] when the Lord Jesus began to uh speak to
[1:21:01] her and you know the story well and
[1:21:04] asked her for a drink and and uh uh she
[1:21:08] said you're a Jew and we don't have
[1:21:11] dealings with the Samaritans and uh and
[1:21:14] he said if you knew it was you'd ask me
[1:21:17] and I'd give you watch how he goes and
[1:21:19] I'd give you water that you'd never
[1:21:21] thirst again. So now he was appealing to
[1:21:23] something. He knew she had a thirst
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; and you'll never thirst again. And she
[1:21:29] said, "Sir, give me this water that I
[1:21:31] won't thirst again and I won't come here
[1:21:32] to this well to draw." She still
[1:21:34] couldn't sort it out. She still had the
[1:21:36] physical mixed with the spiritual, but
[1:21:38] it was speaking to her inwardly. And so
[1:21:42] she said, "I won't come here to to to
[1:21:44] draw and that I won't thirst again."
[1:21:46] Then he said, "Go get your husband." Oh,
[1:21:49] uh, I don't have a husband. That's
[1:21:51] correct. You've you spoke exactly right.
[1:21:54] You've had five and the one you have now
[1:21:57] is not your husband. And she then she's
[1:22:00] sir, I perceive you're a prophet. See,
[1:22:03] that's all God allowed her to know at
[1:22:05] that moment. But she was moving in that
[1:22:07] direction. Why was she moving in that
[1:22:10] direction? Is because she had
[1:22:12] representation
[1:22:13] and and in heaven. And that
[1:22:15] representation now had been sent down
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; and was standing there and as the
[1:22:22] scripture said out of the lips of Jesus,
[1:22:24] "No man can come unto me except the
[1:22:27] father draw him." And that's exactly
[1:22:31] what was happening at that moment. The
[1:22:33] father was drawing her.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God was drawing her. And
[1:22:39] she she said, "I know when went into the
[1:22:42] little religious talk about where the
[1:22:44] Jews worship, where the Samaritans
[1:22:45] worship and and Jesus and then she said,
[1:22:48] "I know that when the Messiah comes,
[1:22:51] he'll tell us all things." See, she was
[1:22:53] right on target. She knew precisely.
[1:22:56] Now, because she had representation, she
[1:22:59] was actually responding to that
[1:23:01] representation. The Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:04] was representing her. Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I that speak to thee am
[1:23:10] he." And that's when she dropped her
[1:23:11] water bucket. And the disciples came and
[1:23:14] marveled that Jesus would be speaking to
[1:23:16] the woman. And and she departed, left
[1:23:18] her water bucket, went into the town,
[1:23:20] and said to the men of the city, "Come
[1:23:23] and see a man that told me all that ever
[1:23:25] I did." All Jesus told her, "You've had
[1:23:28] five husbands. The one you have now is
[1:23:29] not your husband." That's all he told
[1:23:31] her. But as far as she was concerned,
[1:23:33] she had been completely exposed,
[1:23:36] completely made known. Come see a man
[1:23:39] that told me. Now, now the prophet said
[1:23:42] she did that because she had
[1:23:45] representation.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; And he said the priest saw the same
[1:23:52] thing. Now he said the priest was a
[1:23:54] theologian. The priest was a learned
[1:23:56] man. And he said that he he learned what
[1:23:59] was right. He learned that the law was
[1:24:02] right. He learned that they should keep
[1:24:04] the Passover. He learned all of these
[1:24:06] things. That's why friends, we don't
[1:24:08] want to just learn the message.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just learn these
[1:24:12] things. I just learned how I should
[1:24:13] dress. I just learned how I should
[1:24:15] speak. I just learned how I should go to
[1:24:17] church or how I learned how I should
[1:24:19] worship. It wasn't that he said that he
[1:24:21] had no representation.
[1:24:24] And because he had no representation, he
[1:24:26] saw the same thing. He saw the same
[1:24:28] manifestation the woman saw and he
[1:24:30] called it bleub.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And the woman saw it and called it
[1:24:34] Messiah.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; There's the difference.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Well, now can I start?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; So I want to go through those. the first
[1:24:51] coming, the second coming,
[1:24:54] receiving both in the Old Testament and
[1:24:56] the New Testament by attribution. Oh,
[1:24:58] I'm so glad for that that it's
[1:25:00] attributed to us. And we're going to
[1:25:02] come into that now in just a moment. The
[1:25:05] Bible says concerning
[1:25:07] uh man, that he was made in the image of
[1:25:11] God. And so, in the beginning, God made
[1:25:14] his image, his son Adam on earth. And
[1:25:18] the Bible says that he gave him they
[1:25:22] gave him made him a little lower than
[1:25:24] the angels and crowned him with glory
[1:25:27] and honor and did set him over the work
[1:25:30] of his hands. That's what God had done.
[1:25:33] And the and the word in the Hebrew when
[1:25:36] he made him in his image said it is
[1:25:39] something that has been cut off or a
[1:25:42] piece of the original. And I like that.
[1:25:45] Something that's been broken off.
[1:25:47] something that came off of the original.
[1:25:50] And I'm going to move along quickly and
[1:25:52] made him a little lower than the angels
[1:25:55] and crowned him with glory and and God
[1:25:58] set him over the work of his hands. Then
[1:26:00] the image, the masterpiece, because he
[1:26:02] was a masterpiece, the image fell. He
[1:26:06] said, "Then this masterpiece, when Satan
[1:26:08] broke through the walls and marred this
[1:26:11] masterpiece,
[1:26:13] but the great sculptor, I believe I read
[1:26:16] it last Sunday, and I I want to I love
[1:26:18] this the way it's worded. It's just so
[1:26:20] marvelous. When he seen the fall of his
[1:26:23] family, when God saw the fall of his
[1:26:27] family, the masterpiece, he wasn't
[1:26:30] willing to just leave it, lay there face
[1:26:33] down, and ruin. And he went to work
[1:26:37] immediately to build it up again. He
[1:26:40] wasn't willing that it should perish.
[1:26:43] And he's not willing today that it
[1:26:45] should perish.
[1:26:48] And he said he he so he went to work
[1:26:50] immediately and began to build uh again
[1:26:54] unto his own image a man. And I'll say
[1:26:57] this at this at this juncture. If God
[1:27:01] would not leave his image, Adam laying
[1:27:05] in ruin in the dust in the first Eden.
[1:27:09] Do you think for a moment that he's
[1:27:11] going to leave his image which is being
[1:27:14] made in bride form in this day in human
[1:27:18] form? You think for a moment he's going
[1:27:20] to lay allow the the body of the bride
[1:27:24] of Jesus Christ to lay in ruin
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; in Satan's Eden if he wouldn't lay leave
[1:27:30] Adam in that Eden. He's certainly not
[1:27:32] going to leave us in this Eden laying in
[1:27:35] ruin or laying something short of being
[1:27:39] the image restored image.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a moment that he would
[1:27:47] leave his image broken, defeated. And
[1:27:50] I'm speaking to you individually. I
[1:27:52] don't care what your feeling is. He's
[1:27:54] not going to leave you broken. He's not
[1:27:57] going to leave you defeated. He's not
[1:27:59] going to leave you laying face down in
[1:28:02] Satan's Eden. Say, "I I just can't make
[1:28:04] it."
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; This God, this sculptor,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; he's he's already on the move. His
[1:28:12] powers here, the very the very strength
[1:28:15] of his fingers, the very stroke of the
[1:28:18] sculptor shaping again the body of Jesus
[1:28:22] Christ. He's not. Some people say the
[1:28:24] bride's a mess. I deny that. I refute
[1:28:27] that. I say it's a glorious church
[1:28:32] and say, "Well, I see this. I see that.
[1:28:34] I see I see something else. I see a
[1:28:37] glorious church." You say, "What eyes
[1:28:39] are you looking at it?" I'm looking
[1:28:41] through the eyes of attribution.
[1:28:44] What you can't do, he's done.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The victory you can't
[1:28:49] achieve, he's already achieved it.
[1:28:53] He wouldn't leave I He wouldn't leave
[1:28:55] Adam laying down there and he won't
[1:28:57] leave you laying here.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; He's not going to leave this bride
[1:29:00] church laying in the ruin in the 21st
[1:29:04] century. She's arising in her beauty and
[1:29:08] perfection
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; And God began building this image of his
[1:29:18] son all the way through the Old
[1:29:20] Testament. Christ coming down as I said
[1:29:24] earlier through the corporate body of
[1:29:26] the saints being formed by the word of
[1:29:30] the prophets as it says in Matthew 1.
[1:29:33] All this was done speaking the birth of
[1:29:35] Jesus Christ was on this wise and it
[1:29:38] details it and then says all this was
[1:29:41] done that it might be fulfilled which
[1:29:44] was spoken of the Lord by the prophets.
[1:29:48] Hallelujah. Jesus was the product of the
[1:29:51] word of God that came by the prophets.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Don't underestimate the power of God.
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to sure think I'm gone over
[1:30:07] the edge. But I can tell you the power
[1:30:09] of the spoken word that has already been
[1:30:12] delivered that you said, "Well, I got it
[1:30:14] in books or I got it in books or I got
[1:30:16] it in tape or whatever more." Before it
[1:30:18] was in book or tape form, it was spoken
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; and God said and there was
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and God said and it happened.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And God has already spoken. I'll say to
[1:30:30] you for my own satisfaction just that
[1:30:33] what I believe could possibly well be
[1:30:36] the word that's already been spoken is
[1:30:38] sufficient to bring the resurrection on.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to say it again.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; I believe the word that was spoken
[1:30:47] through the prophet's mouth brought
[1:30:48] communism down
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; because the prophet said
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; the prophet said the 144,000
[1:30:55] the Jews 144,000 must be in Israel. They
[1:30:59] must be there at this time.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And here was this great Soviet Union
[1:31:04] saying, "We're not going to let them
[1:31:06] go." And God brought them down. Brought
[1:31:09] them down so suddenly it stunned the
[1:31:11] world. Brought them down so suddenly
[1:31:13] it's still a mystery. And brought them
[1:31:16] into such humility they didn't have any
[1:31:19] fuel.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; They ran out of fuel and oil and gas and
[1:31:24] had men I saw the pictures. men at the
[1:31:26] airport and they needed fuel for the
[1:31:28] plane and they didn't have enough fuel
[1:31:31] to fuel the plane to send their
[1:31:33] engineers into into the north Siberia to
[1:31:36] turn the gas on
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; brought them into such humility.
[1:31:43] humbled that big powerful nation.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you that any nation that hasn't
[1:31:52] got God as their God is a godless
[1:31:55] nation.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Any God, any nation that makes science
[1:32:00] their God is to be pied.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And I wish for our country, America,
[1:32:08] Canada, that we don't make uh Hollywood
[1:32:12] our God. and make entertainment our God.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Our God is a holy God. The God of the
[1:32:18] word,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; the God of the Bible.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And so now here he's coming, his second
[1:32:27] coming being formed by the word of God
[1:32:31] once again through the prophets in the
[1:32:33] Old Testament. Prophet said Christ was
[1:32:36] in Abraham. If you believe it, just say
[1:32:38] amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Christ was in Isaac. Christ was in
[1:32:42] Jacob. Christ was in Joseph. Christ was
[1:32:45] in Moses. And I'll say according to
[1:32:47] Apostle Paul, and Christ is in you,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And to a greater degree.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't see what you see. Moses
[1:32:57] didn't see what you see. Moses brought a
[1:33:00] law. And God has demonstrated his grace
[1:33:03] through you.
[1:33:05] Hallelujah.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, my, it's such a positive
[1:33:10] message." You need it in 207.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; You'll need a more positive message.
[1:33:15] This world is getting waxing older and
[1:33:18] more wicked and more evil and more
[1:33:21] deceitful. And the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:33:23] is coming into more grace because where
[1:33:26] sin abounded, grace doth much more
[1:33:30] abound.
[1:33:32] Hallelujah.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; What do you have for 207? More grace.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; What do you have for 207? More
[1:33:38] revelation.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's what we have for 207. More
[1:33:44] holiness, more of the spirit.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; More dedication.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; We want to plan for it.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Actually plan for it. I give more time
[1:33:56] to God. I give more quality time.
[1:33:59] Hallelujah. I baptized in this spirit
[1:34:03] that brought this word.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Don't get caught up with the world in
[1:34:07] 207 cuz that's going to pass away.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Education is going to go.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; You need it. Get it. Get whatever you
[1:34:22] need to get through life. Your business
[1:34:25] is going to go.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's going to be gone. your status, your
[1:34:30] position.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; You're raised whatever more your bank
[1:34:33] account's going to
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; going to be gone.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; We'll be leaving it all.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; I can't leave it too soon.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; This world's not our home.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; We're just passing through.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] all down through the Old Testament. And
[1:34:59] I'm giving you this. You would say,
[1:35:00] "Well, sounds like you're repeating
[1:35:02] yourself." I am
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; because I said it. Now, I want to
[1:35:05] substantiate it with the with some of
[1:35:08] the message quotes all down through the
[1:35:10] Old Testament. God appeared in men. God
[1:35:13] appeared in Abraham as a faith believer.
[1:35:16] God appeared in David as a king. He
[1:35:19] appeared in Joseph as righteousness. He
[1:35:22] appeared in Moses as prophet, priest,
[1:35:24] lawgiver. He appeared down through the
[1:35:27] ages in the prophets. He always made
[1:35:29] himself known in man in portion through
[1:35:32] the prophets, kings, priest, lawgiver,
[1:35:35] and so forth. But in Christ, he dwelt in
[1:35:37] him, the fullness of the godhead bodily.
[1:35:40] And all that was in God was poured into
[1:35:43] Christ. And all that was in Christ was
[1:35:47] poured in. He didn't say into the Old
[1:35:48] Testament. All of us in Christ is poured
[1:35:51] into his body.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; She's bone of his bone,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; flesh of his flesh.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; She's spirit of his spirit.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; She's breath of his breath.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; The same as the husband and wife are
[1:36:07] one.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. until the perfect image of
[1:36:12] the invisible God stood on the earth in
[1:36:15] the fullness of the Godhead bodily, a
[1:36:17] bridegroom,
[1:36:19] the most eligible bachelor waiting for a
[1:36:22] bride, a worthy bride.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; A piece that would be struck off from
[1:36:28] him, the building of another
[1:36:31] masterpiece.
[1:36:32] And brother Brandham said in
[1:36:33] Masterpiece, he was so perfected, a
[1:36:36] redeemer of man, so perfect, so godly,
[1:36:39] yet there was no beauty that we should
[1:36:41] desire him. When this virgin born son of
[1:36:45] the living God became so perfect and
[1:36:48] humble in the image of God until the
[1:36:51] great master who had brought his life up
[1:36:54] through the prophets, notice I'm I'm
[1:36:56] stressing, he was coming coming. It's
[1:36:59] not something boom out of the sky. He
[1:37:02] was coming. He not only he was coming,
[1:37:04] Mary was coming.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; He's coming. They came together.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; She had a lineage. He had a lineage by
[1:37:13] attribution.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And that is why that is why he didn't
[1:37:19] call her mother. But other place in the
[1:37:21] Bible's called mother. Brother Brandham
[1:37:23] said he never called her mother.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Says to John at the cross, "Behold your
[1:37:28] mother." Right.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; But yet God attributed
[1:37:32] attributed that life to her.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; He had to
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; he attributed to all of the prophets.
[1:37:40] And now now by after I'm so glad this is
[1:37:43] a key point, friends. is a key point for
[1:37:46] us because that part that you feel
[1:37:49] insufficient, that part that Satan would
[1:37:52] needle you about, that that part that
[1:37:54] Satan would try to defeat you about,
[1:37:57] that's the part you have to recognize.
[1:37:59] But God has attributed to me the life of
[1:38:02] Jesus Christ. What I can't earn, what I
[1:38:06] can't do, the works I can't achieve,
[1:38:09] what I'm weak about, God has attributed
[1:38:12] that life to me.
[1:38:15] Do you believe it?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And he said up through the prophets,
[1:38:22] he said, speaking now like God, I've
[1:38:25] been 4,000 years bringing him to this.
[1:38:28] And now he's so perfect. I've got to
[1:38:31] smite him so that he can speak. Oh, just
[1:38:34] listen the way he says it. He didn't say
[1:38:38] that he would speak earlier. Jesus did
[1:38:41] speak and the people marvel at those
[1:38:43] words. But it says now when he came to
[1:38:45] his absolute perfection, his perfection,
[1:38:47] he's now he's going to the cross and God
[1:38:51] struck him.
[1:38:53] The sculptor struck him. And the Jews
[1:38:56] and the Catholics have been fighting for
[1:38:57] centuries over who killed the Lord
[1:38:59] Jesus. No one took his life. He said,
[1:39:02] "No man takes my life. Not Pilate, not
[1:39:05] Herod, not Caesar, not the Pope, not the
[1:39:08] Vatican. I give it up."
[1:39:12] And I will take it up again.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you needed it.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You needed the life that was
[1:39:20] coming back. Oh my
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; friends, you might as well hang on. I'm
[1:39:25] going to preach.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; I just I just feel so consumed with it.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; 4,000 years. And then when he's at the
[1:39:36] conclusion of his life on earth, the
[1:39:39] masterpiece has been here. And it is
[1:39:41] such a perfected redeemer. It's it's
[1:39:44] displaying the attribute of almighty
[1:39:46] God. In perfection is a redeemer. He's
[1:39:49] fulfilled all of the prophecies, all the
[1:39:51] word. And there he hangs on Calvary.
[1:39:54] There he is. The fulfillment of all of
[1:39:56] the scripture. And God struck him so a
[1:39:59] piece would come off.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; And that's us.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And there we are.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; God struck him. When he struck him, he
[1:40:10] said, "Speak."
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; And I say to you that can catch it. And
[1:40:15] today he did speak.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; People say William Brandham said,
[1:40:22] William Brandham said, someone says,
[1:40:24] someone else said, Luther said, whatever
[1:40:26] more. I say Jesus Christ said,
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; the masterpiece spoke. The masterpiece
[1:40:31] spoke again, and he spoke words of
[1:40:34] eternal life.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Then comes the bride body of Jesus
[1:40:41] Christ another masterpiece in the making
[1:40:44] that he might present it to himself.
[1:40:46] Paul said in Ephesians 5 and 27 that he
[1:40:49] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:40:51] church. A glorious church. I'm going to
[1:40:54] stress this friends. It's not something
[1:40:57] that is in our imagination. It's here.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; A glorious church.
[1:41:04] You know,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; somebody is here and probably quite a
[1:41:09] few that desperately need this message
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; today. You want to listen very very
[1:41:16] close because as I read this and I've
[1:41:20] preached long enough to know that when
[1:41:22] we we can read it and we can agree with
[1:41:25] it, but when it comes to a personal
[1:41:27] application and say, "But are you that?"
[1:41:30] Then we get edgy. We say uh that he
[1:41:34] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:41:36] church. Say are you that glorious church
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; having no spot
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; or wrinkle
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; or any such thing
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; you have to be able to say amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I am that church without spot without
[1:41:55] wrinkle without blemish without anything
[1:41:58] inferior. I am that church. I am that
[1:42:01] individual. I am that part of that
[1:42:04] masterpiece.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you can't say it. Some of
[1:42:09] you are too backward to say it. And
[1:42:11] here's where the here's where the crunch
[1:42:12] is. When you when you can't say it and
[1:42:16] you say, "Oh, God,
[1:42:18] you have attributed to me
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; by attribution."
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You could say like, you could say like
[1:42:25] Abraham, I can never bring forth this
[1:42:27] life. I'm dead.
[1:42:30] You feel dead.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; You feel incapable.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; You feel dormant.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; You feel like a a fence post.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Sure, we all do. That will never change
[1:42:45] what God has in his mind and what he
[1:42:48] attributes. Listen, if somebody came to
[1:42:52] the bank, your bank, and said, "I want
[1:42:57] the account of a certain certain person,
[1:42:59] that was you, and I am depositing
[1:43:02] $100,000
[1:43:04] in this account. It's all done. It's
[1:43:07] finished. Here's the $100,000." So, the
[1:43:10] bank notifies you, says certain
[1:43:13] individual came in here and deposit a h
[1:43:16] 100,000. Oh, that's impossible. I'm not
[1:43:20] worthy. Does that change the amount?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I can't even believe that. I could never
[1:43:27] make a h 100,000. I can never earn it. I
[1:43:29] can never Does that change it?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; That doesn't change it. God has already
[1:43:35] deposited into your account
[1:43:40] his righteousness.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Don't diminish the righteousness of
[1:43:44] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:46] And don't de don't diminish the thought
[1:43:48] in God's mind. It is for his children,
[1:43:51] his elect.
[1:43:53] [Applause]
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I start asking myself
[1:43:57] the question. Are you listening close?
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I start asking myself the question I
[1:44:01] read last thing before I went to sleep
[1:44:03] last night. I read what I know so so and
[1:44:07] read so many times and know so clearly
[1:44:09] the woman at the well. And I I just kept
[1:44:11] in my mind the prophet said she had
[1:44:14] representation. She had representation.
[1:44:17] And I could see how the Lord Jesus was
[1:44:20] there representing her. But she didn't
[1:44:22] know she had representation until he
[1:44:26] drew her. The father drawing her to make
[1:44:29] her known to make known to her she had
[1:44:32] representation.
[1:44:34] I thought I need to make this personal
[1:44:37] to myself then I need to make it
[1:44:39] personal to you.
[1:44:41] Said when did I discover I had
[1:44:45] representation? I've prayed at altars
[1:44:49] many times and I've left puddles of
[1:44:51] tears at altars. I've made a lot of
[1:44:55] mistakes in backsliden condition or
[1:44:57] whatever more and repented over it. But
[1:45:00] that was not it.
[1:45:03] I had a thirst
[1:45:05] and I had good brethren,
[1:45:08] good minister friends and they weren't
[1:45:11] able to in fact is often I found the
[1:45:15] thirst intensified
[1:45:17] as I saw that this was
[1:45:20] the this malfunctioned and this did not
[1:45:23] work and this did not fit and I I I I
[1:45:27] saw that it created a greater thirst
[1:45:29] because I saw greater questions out
[1:45:31] there and I I had all of those in my
[1:45:35] heart.
[1:45:37] And then when the word of God began to
[1:45:40] be spoken through a chosen mouth and I
[1:45:44] declare to you that when the word issued
[1:45:49] out of the prophet's mouth and he quoted
[1:45:51] four scriptures for me and questioned me
[1:45:54] as he did the woman at the well, I
[1:45:57] didn't think of it until today because I
[1:45:59] had to ask myself the question or last
[1:46:01] night rather. When did I recognize that
[1:46:05] I had representation?
[1:46:08] And that's when I recognized that I I
[1:46:12] had I was being represented.
[1:46:15] I had representation. I want to I want
[1:46:18] to just say it. When was your moment?
[1:46:21] And if if it hasn't arrived yet, it
[1:46:23] needs to. When was your moment? When
[1:46:27] suddenly
[1:46:30] the grace
[1:46:34] and the voice of God
[1:46:37] came and illuminated your bosom.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Everybody's experience is different. But
[1:46:44] the questions for me, I had a thousand
[1:46:46] questions, deep questions, troubling
[1:46:49] questions, and they just dissolved
[1:46:53] under that enormous light. They just
[1:46:55] dissolved. You had questions, questions
[1:46:58] about life, questions about what was
[1:47:00] right, questions about truth, questions
[1:47:03] about the inconsistencies with what
[1:47:06] people had taught you and what was
[1:47:07] right. And they said, "This is truth,
[1:47:09] but it never brought any peace, never
[1:47:11] brought any rest." And even some have
[1:47:13] come to the message. Some have come to
[1:47:14] the message. And I have to say there are
[1:47:16] a lot of distressed people in the
[1:47:18] message. Doesn't change the message.
[1:47:20] That's because a lot of people are
[1:47:22] purporting a certain thing to be the
[1:47:24] message that's not the message. And it
[1:47:26] doesn't bring peace. It doesn't bring
[1:47:28] stability. But this word as I see it
[1:47:31] come out of the prophet's mouth, it
[1:47:33] brings such rest and such peace. It's
[1:47:37] the answer. And I can say, "Come see a
[1:47:40] man that told me all that ever I did."
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; And I found I had representation. I've
[1:47:52] been thinking about it since I was in
[1:47:54] Brazil. Made a note. Made a note here.
[1:47:57] Made a note there. You have to know in
[1:48:00] fact is the reason why the word came to
[1:48:03] you and was presented to you as it has
[1:48:07] been and and and it began to match
[1:48:10] something that was on the inside. I want
[1:48:13] to announce to you that very act there's
[1:48:16] two things I want to say. That very act
[1:48:19] number one was God informing you that
[1:48:24] you had representation because you're
[1:48:27] recognizing your representative on
[1:48:29] earth.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; This message represents me.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; There is no other message that says you
[1:48:38] didn't do it in the first place.
[1:48:43] Now, the devil and all of his hordes
[1:48:46] along with my imagination and my memory
[1:48:48] channel tell me I did do it.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; I did mess up.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; I did fail.
[1:49:00] But then when I go to the truth of the
[1:49:01] word of God,
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; then I can see that God has attributed
[1:49:06] to me what I can't produce myself. You
[1:49:10] say, "Wow, that could get to be a pretty
[1:49:12] slippery slope of grace." Not a bit. Not
[1:49:15] if you see it in the light of the word.
[1:49:17] And I hope that God can allow me to
[1:49:19] bring it to you the way it should be
[1:49:21] brought to you.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; You got to see it's attributed to us.
[1:49:28] How how was David? Listen, how was
[1:49:30] David? I just I'll just make these
[1:49:32] comparison and you you give me
[1:49:33] sufficient time. I I pray that you
[1:49:35] would. How was David ever going to be a
[1:49:37] man who shed too much blood to even
[1:49:39] build a building, a physical building
[1:49:41] for the Lord? Said you can't do it.
[1:49:42] You've shed too much blood. How's that
[1:49:44] kind of man? How's the kind of man who
[1:49:46] sends a good husband to the front lines?
[1:49:48] A man Uriah who brother Brandham says
[1:49:51] one of the first people he wants to
[1:49:52] shake hands with is Uriah. And he sends
[1:49:54] him to the front lines to get killed so
[1:49:56] he can have his wife Ba Sheeba. And
[1:49:58] somehow in the great plan of God that I
[1:50:00] can't understand, Ba Sheba had to be his
[1:50:03] wife because she had to bring forth
[1:50:04] Solomon.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; You think about it.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; If you think you figured out God, you
[1:50:13] just go home and say, "I don't hardly
[1:50:14] know anything."
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; We can't figure that out.
[1:50:20] And yet God looked upon David. Says, "A
[1:50:23] man after my own heart." Because David
[1:50:25] had a had a certain uh characteristic
[1:50:28] about him. I can tell you one thing.
[1:50:30] Read the first 40 chapters and you'll
[1:50:32] find he was a man who who lived in
[1:50:34] repentance. He didn't just come to a
[1:50:36] spot and kneel down and say, "Oh, God,
[1:50:38] forgive me. I failed you." "Tet, etc."
[1:50:39] He wallowed in his repentance. He he
[1:50:42] asked God to forgive him. And he was in
[1:50:44] such a state of repentance. And God
[1:50:46] loved him
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; and loved him so much God decreed
[1:50:52] something that he couldn't produce of
[1:50:54] his own loins.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; He produced a you know he produced a son
[1:50:59] that tried to disinherit him and tried
[1:51:01] to take his throne
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; as well as producing a Solomon. We
[1:51:05] produced some pretty sure
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; sad things.
[1:51:11] You say, "Well, is God going to is God
[1:51:14] going to charge me for that? Is God
[1:51:16] going to hold me accountable for that?"
[1:51:19] But God in his great plan said, "I'm
[1:51:22] going to give David because he believes
[1:51:25] me."
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; That's the key. He believes me.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; When I gave him a promise, he believed
[1:51:31] me. Abraham believed me.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; And that meant so much to God. He said,
[1:51:37] "I'm going to nullify you.
[1:51:41] I'm going to invalidate
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; what you fell into
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; because you've been born with a sinful
[1:51:52] nature.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to invalidate it
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give I'm going to put
[1:51:58] in your bank account. you're bankrupt
[1:52:00] morally, but I'm going to put my son
[1:52:03] Jesus Christ in your bank accountus.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; And today it would even take on new
[1:52:11] dimension because he would put the
[1:52:13] spirit within us, the Holy Ghost within
[1:52:16] us.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; It would cause us to be victorious and
[1:52:19] cause us to believe more.
[1:52:44] Generations of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:48] The book,
[1:52:51] it's not a very long book. the first
[1:52:53] verse
[1:52:55] of the generation of Jesus Christ,
[1:52:58] the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[1:53:00] I'm stressing those words because as
[1:53:04] they were in the Old Testament
[1:53:06] and if you see their life back there,
[1:53:09] project that into the New Testament. And
[1:53:12] it really is no different what God did.
[1:53:13] He attributed his son to them.
[1:53:17] Jesus coming on down. Now, I just want
[1:53:20] to make some comments, some statements,
[1:53:25] and I'm I'm going to just read this.
[1:53:29] Every human child
[1:53:32] has been born
[1:53:35] with an inherited sinful nature. Could
[1:53:38] you agree with that?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; You can take a child,
[1:53:44] Brother John, sister Vanessa had their
[1:53:46] child dedicated. they could take and
[1:53:47] protect that child and keep it so to
[1:53:49] never hear an evil word, never say an
[1:53:51] evil thing, but it'll it'll kick and
[1:53:54] scream and show its nature one day along
[1:53:57] the way cuz it's in them.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Inherited sinful nature of sinful flesh.
[1:54:06] And if you wanted to put it down, you
[1:54:07] could read Romans 8 and3.
[1:54:10] This is the result of our parents,
[1:54:14] Adam and Eve, to whom we are all
[1:54:17] genetically related.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Each generation without exception
[1:54:26] has sinned. Romans 3 and 23. All have
[1:54:30] sinned
[1:54:32] and passed on. And the scripture which I
[1:54:34] read says even they that did not sin
[1:54:38] after Adam's simultude
[1:54:41] but death passed upon all.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; So what about the person says I didn't
[1:54:46] sin like Adam sinned. Why is death
[1:54:49] passed upon me? Because he got it by
[1:54:54] attribution.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; It was death was attributed to him.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Even though he didn't sin according to
[1:55:01] Adam's sin. But yet he he reaped Adam's
[1:55:04] penalty.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; See, so you say, "Well, is that fair?"
[1:55:09] Well, it's as fair as you not being able
[1:55:11] to be righteous, but God count you
[1:55:12] righteous.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; It's six of one, half a dozen of the
[1:55:15] other.
[1:55:23] And so sin is passed
[1:55:26] on and it sinful nature to each
[1:55:29] succeeding generation.
[1:55:32] Wherefore is by one man sin entered into
[1:55:34] the world and death by sin sin entered
[1:55:38] into the world by one man. Are you still
[1:55:40] alert?
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; If you get too tired I'll have you stand
[1:55:43] up, shake hands, but I should just keep
[1:55:45] on preaching. Amen.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Sin entered into the world and death by
[1:55:49] sin and so death passed upon all. Death
[1:55:53] passed upon all men. For that all have
[1:55:57] sinned.
[1:56:00] For until the law was in the world, but
[1:56:03] sin was not imputed where there is no
[1:56:05] law. It wasn't imputed
[1:56:08] where there's no law.
[1:56:11] There's only one exception
[1:56:13] to this. genetically past fallen human
[1:56:18] race which was Jesus Christ.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus grew in the womb of Mary
[1:56:26] in the same manner as any baby but he
[1:56:29] was different from all other babies.
[1:56:35] He was not genetically
[1:56:39] related to either Mary or Joseph for
[1:56:44] both had an inherited sinful nature.
[1:56:49] Jesus was sinless
[1:56:51] without genetic flaw
[1:56:54] since he was to serve as the spotless
[1:56:56] sacrificial lamb of God.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; He had no DNA.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Of Mary
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; and no DNA of Joseph.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; He was absolutely
[1:57:12] and brother Brandham says Jesus was not
[1:57:15] the blood of a Jew nor Gentile.
[1:57:18] He was a creative blood by Jehovah
[1:57:20] himself. He was the blood of God. Do you
[1:57:24] accept that? Of course we do. The Bible
[1:57:26] said that we're saved by the blood of
[1:57:28] God, not the blood of a Jew or the blood
[1:57:30] of a Gentile. It all be sex, but this
[1:57:33] was the blood of God.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; The physical body of Jesus Christ
[1:57:41] was clearly a special creation of God
[1:57:45] placed in Mary's womb. And this is the
[1:57:48] doctrine of the virgin birth.
[1:57:54] Now, this someone else wrote and I'm
[1:57:56] just going to read it and just see where
[1:57:58] people now, Brother Brandham said these
[1:58:01] things 40 years ago, but here's people
[1:58:04] at this Christmas coming up with what a
[1:58:07] prophet said a long time ago.
[1:58:11] Thus, this man wrote, "Neither Christ's
[1:58:15] spirit nor his body resulted from the
[1:58:17] DNA of Mary's egg or from any man's
[1:58:21] sperm. Both would have contained
[1:58:24] inherited genetic defects and the sin
[1:58:27] nature.
[1:58:28] As scripture tells us, Jesus was truly
[1:58:31] the second Adam. The first Adam was a
[1:58:34] special creation of God, not related to
[1:58:37] any human being.
[1:58:39] That's right.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Adam was not related to any human being.
[1:58:43] And so was the second Adam.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus was just as fully human as the
[1:58:50] first Adam.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; And just like the first Adam, he had no
[1:58:54] sin nature, no inherited sin, and no
[1:58:58] sinful flesh, which has always been
[1:59:01] passed from one generation to the next.
[1:59:03] Adam and Eve's sin. Uh
[1:59:08] he was absolutely pure and without sin
[1:59:12] from the day he was born
[1:59:14] till the day he died. He had to be he
[1:59:18] was the lamb of God without blemish or
[1:59:20] spot sacrificed for sins.
[1:59:27] So now how are we ever going to attain
[1:59:30] to something like that? Just be at
[1:59:32] peace. You never will.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Neither can you.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to go out of this
[1:59:38] service today and say, "Father, I
[1:59:41] perhaps didn't grasp everything. I don't
[1:59:43] expect you to. I've been pondering this
[1:59:45] for quite a while. I've been studying it
[1:59:47] since I was in Brazil. This mighty truth
[1:59:53] of righteousness being attributed to the
[1:59:55] individual because you can never produce
[1:59:58] the life of Jesus Christ on your own."
[2:00:01] Now, that does not make an allowance for
[2:00:03] someone to say, "Oh my, you know, now I
[2:00:06] can let down the bars and kind of do
[2:00:08] what I want to do." That proves you
[2:00:10] didn't have it in the first place.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; That proves you never had it in the
[2:00:15] first place. Anybody says, "Oh, now I
[2:00:17] can live loose. Now I can just live in
[2:00:19] the world and I can't produce it anyway,
[2:00:21] so why try?" That's not it.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; That's not it. The individual, the
[2:00:26] individual who has that seed, who has
[2:00:28] representation, they got something here
[2:00:30] that's crying for it. They got something
[2:00:32] that's craving for it. You're yearning
[2:00:34] for it. You're desiring. You're doing
[2:00:36] everything that is possible within your
[2:00:39] the scope of your ability. And
[2:00:42] furthermore, we have the uncction. This
[2:00:45] is a reality, friends. And some here
[2:00:47] need the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:00:51] Some think that brother Brandham did
[2:00:52] away with that. He didn't do away with
[2:00:54] it. He emphasized it even more and more.
[2:00:57] The Holy Spirit in an individual's life.
[2:01:00] He spoke about the things that Daniel
[2:01:02] did and and he says and they didn't even
[2:01:04] have the Holy Spirit. We have it's the
[2:01:06] Holy Spirit who gave life to the word.
[2:01:09] It's the Holy Spirit that gives
[2:01:10] revelation of the message. And we have a
[2:01:13] baptism of that Holy Spirit. It is an
[2:01:15] infusion.
[2:01:18] I listened to a message and it's from
[2:01:21] that time and I thought it was so
[2:01:23] fitting for tonight if I have any
[2:01:24] comments tonight but I'll just say from
[2:01:26] that time there is a moment when a man
[2:01:29] or a woman meets God
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; and from that time you will be a
[2:01:35] different creature. You'll be a
[2:01:38] different individual. And from that
[2:01:40] time,
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; maybe you haven't arrived there yet,
[2:01:48] but when you do,
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; when you meet God, you'll be a different
[2:01:52] person. Moses was a different person
[2:01:54] after the burning bush.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Peter was a different person after
[2:01:59] Pentecost. They're different people.
[2:02:01] Turn cowards into brave men. I won't go
[2:02:04] on with that, but but that's what we
[2:02:07] have to do.
[2:02:13] Now,
[2:02:14] I'm just going to give myself another
[2:02:16] few minutes and then I'm going to close.
[2:02:20] How many times
[2:02:23] you students of the message, how many
[2:02:26] times did the prophet use the word
[2:02:28] attribute
[2:02:30] that you are a manifested attribute of
[2:02:34] God? Now that either means what is said
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; or it has no meaning at all.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; That you sitting here today are an
[2:02:44] attribute
[2:02:46] of the mind of God. Now in this human
[2:02:49] state, there is no way that you can
[2:02:54] fulfill completely what God had in his
[2:02:58] mind physically speaking.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have the wherewithal.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; We're too filled with failures and
[2:03:05] weaknesses and the flesh is weak.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; You say things and you you say it and
[2:03:14] said, you know, Lord Jesus, help me. You
[2:03:16] would have never said that.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; We think things say, "Lord, forgive me.
[2:03:21] You'd have never thought of that." And
[2:03:22] if we and if we lived in that state, we
[2:03:25] would go down in despair. God, how can I
[2:03:28] ever believe that I am a son of God? How
[2:03:33] can I ever believe that? How can I ever
[2:03:35] believe that I'm an expression of Jesus
[2:03:37] Christ on earth? God knew exactly the
[2:03:40] picture he had in his mind of you before
[2:03:43] the foundation of the world. He knew
[2:03:46] what you were going to be. He knew that
[2:03:48] his spirit would come into you. He knew
[2:03:50] that you'd experienced a new birth and
[2:03:52] what you were not capable of because he
[2:03:54] saw you also in this fallen state by
[2:03:58] attribution.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; He's going to create and make that part
[2:04:02] that you can't do.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And you shall be the full picture. In
[2:04:08] fact, that if that revelation of
[2:04:10] attribution I I'm able to live up here,
[2:04:13] I can increase. I get higher but I
[2:04:15] always feel I'm missing something.
[2:04:16] Missing something. You are indeed
[2:04:18] missing something. And if you don't have
[2:04:20] a revelation that God by attribution
[2:04:24] as it was in the Old Testament, Israel
[2:04:26] could have said even as a nation is a
[2:04:28] corporate structure.
[2:04:31] How are we going to bring a Messiah?
[2:04:34] We we we've we've been spending 70 years
[2:04:36] in Babylon.
[2:04:38] We're in Babylon.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; We're a bunch of slaves. Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; We're 400 years in Egypt
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; and the Messiah come here. We are muders
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; and we got a prophecies. The pro the
[2:04:53] Lord your God shall raise up a prophet
[2:04:57] among you
[2:05:00] and him shall you hear.
[2:05:03] Just envision yourself not sitting in a
[2:05:05] nice church today, but envision yourself
[2:05:07] in a slime pit
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; up to your knees wallowing in mud making
[2:05:13] bricks for a tyrant
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; so he can build some name for himself in
[2:05:18] the world
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; and you have a prophet telling you
[2:05:22] you're going to bring forth a messiah.
[2:05:24] Messiah.
[2:05:27] My daddy's been here. My granddaddy died
[2:05:30] in the slime pit. My greatgranddaddy was
[2:05:33] in this. As far as I know, we've been
[2:05:35] here almost 400 years.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; And there's no hope of a deliverance.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; It's getting worse
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; now. There's no straw. Do you get my
[2:05:46] picture?
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; You think you're in a pathetic state.
[2:05:49] What about that one?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; But God attributed his son
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; to that nation.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He attributed the life of
[2:05:58] Jesus Christ by attribution.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; God out of his own will, out of his own
[2:06:04] bosom, by his own decree,
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; said, "My son shall come out of Israel."
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; This is meat.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; You want to chew on it?
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And that same principle applies to the
[2:06:25] individual. Sure,
[2:06:29] some of Israel, they they gave up.
[2:06:34] They were in wars and were defeated. If
[2:06:37] you read the Old Testament,
[2:06:40] it's a really a sad record in a lot of
[2:06:42] places. Amen.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; You read about kings and and people and
[2:06:47] and and in my own heart as I read about
[2:06:50] Joel, the the king Joel and and Josiah
[2:06:53] rather and the thing and then see such a
[2:06:54] defeat at the end of how can this
[2:06:56] happen? You know, thousands of them
[2:06:59] slaughtered and God, what is your
[2:07:01] program? What is your plan?
[2:07:04] Never change the mind of God. You say,
[2:07:06] "I can't figure that out." That's a good
[2:07:08] thing you can't figure it out. But God
[2:07:10] in his mind says, "This nation, this man
[2:07:14] Abraham, I selected. This nation came
[2:07:17] out of him by a certain line, and this
[2:07:20] nation I've chosen." And even in the
[2:07:22] world, in the state that it's in can't
[2:07:24] get God to change his mind.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Israel is God's people. And regardless
[2:07:31] of what the you think or regardless of
[2:07:33] what the church world says, regardless
[2:07:35] of what they say about this message,
[2:07:37] you'll never get God to change his mind
[2:07:40] about his vindicated message.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Wasn't William Brandon a vindicated. It
[2:07:44] was God that vindicated it.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; In case some here may not like his name,
[2:07:49] but I'll tell you, God loved his name.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I want his name to represent me,
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and he was God's representative on
[2:07:56] earth.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Who else had that? Who else said draw up
[2:08:02] the line, bring up the people and stand
[2:08:05] there before the first one and describe
[2:08:07] what a prophet is and what he says has
[2:08:09] to be true. Every time true and then
[2:08:11] stand and say, "Does anybody want to
[2:08:13] take my place?" Do you know in all the
[2:08:16] time of 33 years of ministry, no one
[2:08:19] ever stood up to take his place?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Even with all those ministers in
[2:08:25] Chicago, he said, "You you brought me
[2:08:27] here to trap me here. He said, "I want
[2:08:30] someone to come and stand beside me." No
[2:08:32] one came and stood beside him.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; They feared that presence.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; They knew that was none other than the
[2:08:38] angel of the Lord.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; And I that message and that ministry was
[2:08:46] my that's what drew me.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; And today again, it came with new
[2:08:50] appreciation. I'm so And now I know why
[2:08:54] uh we are drawn to that. Now, I know why
[2:08:57] it draws us so deeply. It's because
[2:08:59] we're looking at our representation.
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; God sent down and he said, "Am I
[2:09:05] speaking too loud?"
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; God sent down, the prophet said, "God
[2:09:10] sent down her representation."
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; God sent down to us a representation.
[2:09:20] And the fact that it called you and
[2:09:22] spoke to you and drew you was God
[2:09:25] testifying to you. You're you came from
[2:09:28] me. And I sent this down to let you know
[2:09:31] you're represented in heaven.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And we're going to close in just a few
[2:09:45] more moments now.
[2:09:52] an attribute.
[2:09:54] I want to get get this across to you
[2:09:56] before I close. Brother Brandon, we use
[2:09:59] the word so many times.
[2:10:06] An attribute is first and foremost
[2:10:10] a quality.
[2:10:12] A certain quality.
[2:10:15] Hold on to it. Please don't don't don't
[2:10:17] don't don't let your thoughts drift
[2:10:19] down. An attribute first and foremost is
[2:10:23] a certain quality.
[2:10:28] A quality denotes a thing. A quality
[2:10:33] denotes a thing or shall I say a person
[2:10:37] as being what they really are.
[2:10:44] Now the prophet says and he speaks about
[2:10:47] you being an attribute of God.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; You are a certain quality of God.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; And when he uses the word attribute, he
[2:10:58] is declaring on the earth that that's
[2:11:01] what you really are.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; And when you read all the quotes about
[2:11:08] the attributes of God, you say, "I don't
[2:11:10] measure up." No, your representation has
[2:11:13] said, "But that's what you really are."
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; And it and and and furthermore, it is an
[2:11:22] attribute is to ascribe to a person what
[2:11:26] is surely his. It's telling you that God
[2:11:31] has ascribed this to you. God has put it
[2:11:34] in your bank account.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; God has imputed it to you.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; God counted him for righteousness. And
[2:11:47] that's what it says in the scripture
[2:11:51] that God accounted
[2:11:54] I'd like to just read those uh
[2:11:57] scriptures. I just come to it. Uh
[2:12:04] what shall we say then that Abraham our
[2:12:07] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[2:12:09] found? For if Abraham was justified by
[2:12:12] works, he hath whereof to glory but not
[2:12:15] before God.
[2:12:17] And he asked, "What sayith the
[2:12:18] scripture?" Because now Paul is going to
[2:12:20] quote out of Psalms.
[2:12:23] Abraham believed God. That's what he did
[2:12:26] do. And it was counted unto him for
[2:12:30] righteousness.
[2:12:32] And this word counted is first
[2:12:37] and foremost. And God counted it to him
[2:12:41] for righteousness. You all listening?
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; The first interpretation of the word he
[2:12:47] counted it is to think.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; God thought of him because he believed
[2:12:55] God. And between believing was all of
[2:12:59] his frailties and weaknesses and and and
[2:13:02] taking Hagar and having Ishmael and
[2:13:05] going down and and calling his wife his
[2:13:08] sister, which she was his halfsister,
[2:13:10] and and telling the king things that
[2:13:13] weren't exactly right, and and on down
[2:13:16] and he backslid. The prophet said went
[2:13:17] into another country, had all of that,
[2:13:20] but between that that he believed God
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:27] And down here, God said, "I am counting
[2:13:32] you because I thought of you
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; because I thought of you."
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; I think of you as being righteous.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; That was in his thinking.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I can't stop just for a few moments.
[2:13:52] Listen, help me. God thought of you.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of scriptures.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of scriptures. It says it
[2:14:00] counted to him. It counted to him for
[2:14:03] righteousness. The very scripture says
[2:14:06] those that those that did not sin after
[2:14:10] Adam sinned, death, the same God let
[2:14:12] death pass upon all even though they
[2:14:14] didn't commit the same sin.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Death was imputed to them.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; But now life is imputed. Righteousness
[2:14:22] is imputed. Hallelujah. Everything we
[2:14:25] couldn't earn is imputed to us. It's
[2:14:27] credited to us,
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; given to us. You might say, I I've got
[2:14:31] that, brother. I've got that. I've got
[2:14:33] that. Why don't you carry on? Because
[2:14:35] surely as we get out of this service,
[2:14:36] someone say, you know, I didn't quite
[2:14:38] get it.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it till you get it.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; It's accounted to you.
[2:14:53] I know all of you here as believers have
[2:14:54] said, "Abraham's our father in the
[2:14:57] faith." Hey, where's your connection to
[2:15:00] Abraham?
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have any connection to
[2:15:02] Abraham.
[2:15:06] You don't have any natural connection
[2:15:07] connection to Abraham,
[2:15:09] but God in his word
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; has declared it so.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; So you say, "I believe that. Amen.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And when you say I believe that, even
[2:15:20] though God says, "Huh, you're you're
[2:15:24] millions of generations away from
[2:15:26] Abraham." But you know what? I'm going
[2:15:28] to close that gap. And because you
[2:15:30] believed it, I'm going to make you his
[2:15:31] daughter. I'm going to make you his son.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to decree it. You are indeed a
[2:15:37] son of Abraham.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And along with that, I'm
[2:15:41] going to pass on some benefits. You've
[2:15:43] got the faith of Abraham. You got the
[2:15:45] faithfulness of Abraham. I'm going to
[2:15:47] give you his qualities because you get
[2:15:49] them by attribution.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; You can never earn them. You can never
[2:15:52] fix it. You can never patch it up. You
[2:15:54] can never make your roots ever go back
[2:15:56] there.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; But God give it to you by attribution.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; And even so, are you a son of God?
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God thought of it
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; in a future home. And I really must
[2:16:13] close. It's hard for me to close.
[2:16:17] You know, I study for all these hours
[2:16:18] and then try and put it here in a
[2:16:20] couple. It's it's difficult.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is eternal.
[2:16:27] Then you are in eternity where you were
[2:16:30] all the time,
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; but you've just recognized what
[2:16:34] happened. Amen.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; You were made for an eternal purpose
[2:16:39] because you are the manifestation.
[2:16:42] You are the manifestation
[2:16:45] of an attribute of God. You're the
[2:16:47] manifestation of a quality of God.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; You're the manifestation of one of God's
[2:16:53] qualities, a actual part of God. The
[2:16:57] creator of heavens and earth has
[2:17:00] deposited within his elect a part of
[2:17:03] himself. Thus you can say I came from
[2:17:06] the bosom of God and I will go back to
[2:17:09] the bosom of God. And how do you know
[2:17:11] that? Because my faith declares it.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; And the message of God's message in
[2:17:18] every hour come the way. Come by the
[2:17:21] people even as Jesus came and sat on the
[2:17:24] well. So common, so natural. Who could
[2:17:29] say any great spiritual thing was going
[2:17:31] to happen before the day was out?
[2:17:35] Oh
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; friends, don't let the devil dupe you
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; right
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; and and dull your minds by the natural
[2:17:44] events of your life by the natural
[2:17:47] thing. And when when Jesus had
[2:17:49] ministered to that woman and the
[2:17:50] disciples came and the disciples were
[2:17:52] all taken up with the food, oh here
[2:17:54] master, we got we got lunch
[2:18:00] and they start getting it all ready.
[2:18:03] He wouldn't eat.
[2:18:05] Aren't you hungry?
[2:18:07] Don't you want to eat?
[2:18:10] Well, he had just given the woman.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; He had satisfied her thirst.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; So, she never would thirst again.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; And by doing that, he satisfied his
[2:18:22] hunger.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I have meat to eat that
[2:18:27] you don't know anything about. Amen.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; I have meat to eat.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Lift up your eyes."
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, they put our Well, same old hills we
[2:18:38] always looked at.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; No, look on the fields.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Fields. Fields. What fields?
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; They're white already to harvest.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Don't say there's four months to the
[2:18:49] harvest. We look into 207. I don't know
[2:18:52] what's going to happen on 207, but I
[2:18:55] know what I'm enjoying at this moment.
[2:18:59] that God because because he thought of
[2:19:02] attributes he had to think.
[2:19:06] And when he thought he thought of I'm
[2:19:10] going to attribute this now. Isn't this
[2:19:12] glorious? Isn't this more glorious?
[2:19:14] Isn't it more glorious that God would
[2:19:16] bring people that were fallen and
[2:19:17] defeated and give them by attribution
[2:19:19] perfection? Isn't that a lot more
[2:19:21] glorious than he brought a whole bunch
[2:19:23] of good people and said, "Well, you're
[2:19:25] good people anyway. Now I'll just give
[2:19:26] you something good. Amen.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; No. Be better that he brought a bunch of
[2:19:31] wretched people.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; People that were
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; in sin,
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; people that were bound. People that were
[2:19:39] possessed of devils. People who couldn't
[2:19:42] help themselves, wretches of humanity.
[2:19:46] And God in his grace picks them up.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; And he knows in his thought they can
[2:19:51] never do it in their own strength. But
[2:19:53] in my thought, I thought of them as
[2:19:55] perfection.
[2:19:57] I thought of them as my children
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take them from that
[2:20:01] point in a quantum leap right over here
[2:20:04] to perfection. They can't do it, but I
[2:20:07] have thought of them as having already
[2:20:09] done it.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I will send down
[2:20:15] I'll prove that that they have a seed in
[2:20:18] them. I'll send down representation
[2:20:23] representation that they have in heaven.
[2:20:25] I'm going to send it down. And they're
[2:20:28] going to be in such a murky condition
[2:20:30] and their mind will be so clouded.
[2:20:32] They'll be so occupied with things of
[2:20:34] this life. But I'll just come there.
[2:20:36] They'll be so burdened. They'll be so
[2:20:39] messed up. Like the woman at the well.
[2:20:41] They'll be so messed up, so defeated
[2:20:45] that I'll just come on the pathway one
[2:20:46] day.
[2:20:49] I'll just start to speak to them. I'll
[2:20:52] bring them into a meeting.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I know people I know a young
[2:20:58] man who was in the army in Singapore
[2:21:03] and one of the believers was after him
[2:21:05] and after him and after him. You need to
[2:21:06] come and see this video. You need to
[2:21:08] come and see this film. It was deep
[2:21:09] called the deep. Come on and see this
[2:21:11] film. Oh, well, he didn't want to go. He
[2:21:14] didn't want to go. He wasn't a believer.
[2:21:15] And he thought, uh, so he said to
[2:21:17] another friend of his, "Hey, I I'm going
[2:21:19] to see a film tonight. Do you want to
[2:21:20] come along and see?" Yeah, okay. I'll go
[2:21:22] with you. So, so they both go, the guy
[2:21:25] who was pressed on and invited and
[2:21:27] witnessed to and everything else, he
[2:21:28] just went away and the other guy became
[2:21:30] a believer.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it, but when he got
[2:21:33] there, how many people here?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; How many people here? I know that I
[2:21:37] don't need your hand. How many people?
[2:21:38] You're just filled with all kinds of
[2:21:40] confusion and questions and darkness and
[2:21:42] so on. And then a light shone your way.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[2:21:51] this is so glorious.
[2:21:53] And one of the first things I have to
[2:21:54] tackle with people when they come to say
[2:21:57] why me. And I have to tell them, I don't
[2:22:00] know why you,
[2:22:02] but I'm no good. You are right. You're
[2:22:05] no good. But God did it anyway. That's
[2:22:07] the grace. That's the marvelous part of
[2:22:09] this. Hallelujah.
[2:22:12] I announce to you, Amen.
[2:22:18] In the name of Jesus Christ, there will
[2:22:20] be many failures perhaps in 207.
[2:22:25] But let me announce to you for 207 the
[2:22:28] best news I can give you that God, he
[2:22:31] had a thought.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; And his thought caused him to impute or
[2:22:36] accredit to you perfection,
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; maturity.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; Can I have two more minutes?
[2:22:48] You go read the ris rising of the sun
[2:22:50] again. Go and hear rising of the sun
[2:22:51] again and you'll come to this part.
[2:22:55] Brother Brandham goes in the Old
[2:22:56] Testament. Don't don't get lost in the
[2:22:57] Old Testament. Now he goes to the Old
[2:22:59] Testament and the and and and the
[2:23:02] celebration of the sheath waving and to
[2:23:05] wave a sheath. And it's very unusual
[2:23:07] because in the Old Testament, if you
[2:23:08] read it, I think Leviticus 23, it says,
[2:23:12] "And they will cut down the first grain.
[2:23:16] that comes that is ripe and mature,
[2:23:20] he'll cut down. The man will cut it down
[2:23:23] and he'll take that first sheath to the
[2:23:26] priest,
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; not the king
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; and not the prophet.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; To the priest.
[2:23:34] Hold that. Because he comes in three
[2:23:36] sons,
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; son of man, son of God, son of David.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he'll take it to the priest
[2:23:44] and he says and the priest will wave it
[2:23:46] before God
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; not before the people he'll raise it be
[2:23:50] wave it before God as a memorial
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; to God now that's where it ends and a
[2:23:57] prophet comes and gives us an
[2:23:59] understanding why it's a memorial to God
[2:24:02] because the sheath that came out of the
[2:24:03] earth oh my
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; and be it was the first one that got
[2:24:08] ripe
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; it was cut down.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; It was the first one that was perfect.
[2:24:12] It was the first one that was mature and
[2:24:15] it was cut down and taken to the
[2:24:17] priest's office. And the priest waved it
[2:24:20] before God. And the prophet comes and
[2:24:22] tells us because why was it waved as a
[2:24:24] memorial before God? Because it was a
[2:24:26] testimony to God that there was more
[2:24:29] like that sheep in the earth.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; More like him in the earth. And you'll
[2:24:37] come to the place where brother says and
[2:24:39] again
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; in this day
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; there had to be another sheep wave.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; That one that was waved, he was cut
[2:24:53] down. It was the first image that ever
[2:24:55] came to perfection. And he was cut down,
[2:24:59] hung on a tree, and raised up again the
[2:25:02] third day. And he was waved over the
[2:25:05] people a blessing as he ascended.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; But he said there has to be another
[2:25:10] wave,
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; another sheath waving.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; That one by a virgin-born son and this
[2:25:15] one by a redeemed son.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; What would it do for us if we just saw a
[2:25:23] virgin son? He was waved over the
[2:25:25] people. But God in his mercy showing
[2:25:28] that he can attribute to a man born in
[2:25:31] sin, shape in iniquity, made mistakes.
[2:25:35] But God brought him to a mature state
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; with such maturity that the Lord Jesus
[2:25:41] Christ himself was in full attendance
[2:25:44] all the time at his side.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:25:50] And he said, "And again today in the
[2:25:52] rising of the sun, I sat in that service
[2:25:54] 1965." "And again it had to be waved
[2:25:58] over the people." And he said, "And
[2:26:00] again, what was it?" It was a ministry
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; being waved over the people.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; The reason I say 1965, hang on to it
[2:26:08] now. That was that was in the era of the
[2:26:12] dispensation of the office of the son of
[2:26:16] god which was the priesthood era.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; The priesthood era and the sheath had to
[2:26:23] be taken to the priest and before
[2:26:25] brother Brandham passed off the scene
[2:26:27] and that priesthood era is going to go
[2:26:29] to a son of David son of David office.
[2:26:34] One of the last things he did was
[2:26:36] identify that he was waving this
[2:26:38] ministry. God was waving it over the
[2:26:41] people, a mature son of God with a
[2:26:46] declaration. There's more like this in
[2:26:49] the field.
[2:26:51] And you were not even born then. Most of
[2:26:53] you were not even born. Think of the
[2:26:56] grace of God that God waved a sheath.
[2:26:58] God waved a ministry over this earth
[2:27:00] that one day you'd hear it and say, "Oh,
[2:27:04] that speaks to me. That gives me water
[2:27:07] that I never thirst again."
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Make an old man feel young again.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Can I enjoy my religion?
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Good. You enjoy it, too. Praise the
[2:27:28] Lord.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Hard to get stopped.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:40] I believe it's good news for the new
[2:27:42] year.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; We'll meet tonight at 9:00.
[2:27:47] Come a little bit early. We'll get
[2:27:48] started. We'll have our musicians. We're
[2:27:51] going to stand and sing. My goodness, I
[2:27:53] was 20 minutes beyond the time I thought
[2:27:56] I was going to quit. But when you're
[2:27:58] having fun,
[2:28:00] time passes quickly, doesn't it?
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Somehow I think that that little woman
[2:28:08] at the well,
[2:28:12] I don't think she was watching the sun
[2:28:14] dial
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; saying, you know, sir, I'm in a hurry. I
[2:28:17] got to go home and wash some clothes.
[2:28:20] Give me some more of this water. Amen.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:39] Let's just thank him a moment.
[2:28:42] Gracious Lord Jesus,
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; how lovely you are.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; We are unworthy, but we say how lovely
[2:28:50] you are.
[2:28:52] I can see in the faces of this
[2:28:54] congregation, oh God, as they hear the
[2:28:56] word and
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; in their soul
[2:29:00] rises and in their voices, in their
[2:29:03] mouth. Amen. Thanksgiving to you.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you Lord.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you personally in all the areas of
[2:29:12] our failings and oh God how how Jesus
[2:29:18] you said the flesh is weak and we have
[2:29:19] found it so. But you also said the
[2:29:22] spirit is willing and we have found that
[2:29:24] so and this morning we are here with
[2:29:26] willing spirits oh God. Our souls say
[2:29:30] yay and amen. We believe oh God that you
[2:29:34] have identified us for representation.
[2:29:37] You have represented us with a word with
[2:29:39] a message and oh God we identify with it
[2:29:43] and it has done so much for us. I pray
[2:29:45] that you'll bless this people oh Lord in
[2:29:48] the name of Jesus Christ. give them a
[2:29:50] refreshing this afternoon and this
[2:29:52] evening Lord as we come to rejoice, we
[2:29:55] come to hear testimonies, we come to
[2:29:57] sing. I pray Lord you will our worship
[2:30:00] and our testimonies will be acceptable
[2:30:03] in your sight and that you'll be
[2:30:05] glorified amongst us Jesus Christ's
[2:30:08] name. Amen.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; I started off with many things about
[2:30:13] tomorrow.

[2:33:01] he holds my hand.
[2:33:05] I don't know
[2:33:08] how to
[2:33:11] [Music]
[2:33:12] bring
[2:33:19] the
[2:33:22] fees.
[2:33:28] You stand by me.

[2:34:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:34:06] [Music]
[2:34:15] tomorrow
[2:34:18] and I know
[2:34:20] he holds my hand.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder Brother Hank Iverson. Brother
[2:34:28] Iverson, if you would come, I'd like you
[2:34:30] to pray a prayer. Give us a word of
[2:34:33] greeting from Belgium and pray a prayer
[2:34:36] of blessing upon this people as we close
[2:34:39] out this year. many things
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:45] tomorrow.
[2:34:48] I don't see
[2:34:51] I understand.
[2:34:54] [Applause]
[2:35:01] [Music]
[2:35:09] That's exactly what happened in our
[2:35:11] little church.
[2:35:14] Uh we didn't know
[2:35:16] and we still don't know.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; We had an old building and it had to be
[2:35:22] sold. We didn't know where to go and
[2:35:26] just 3 days before we came here, God
[2:35:29] gave us a solution and we believe the
[2:35:31] Lord will help us.
[2:35:34] So also in our private lives
[2:35:38] very often it's like everything is
[2:35:40] blocked
[2:35:43] but he opens the way
[2:35:45] and that's what he did yesterday
[2:35:49] he does it today and he do it tomorrow.
[2:35:53] Let us thank him
[2:35:56] heavenly father.
[2:36:00] How little we feel when we see
[2:36:05] what you have done for us day by day by
[2:36:08] day.
[2:36:11] How little faith we had by ourselves. We
[2:36:14] could bring nothing.
[2:36:18] And every time again, Lord, you came
[2:36:22] and you supplied every need.
[2:36:27] How gracious we are.
[2:36:29] How thankful you we are Lord.
[2:36:34] Help us Lord now
[2:36:37] to be able to take the next step.
[2:36:42] Thank you for every word this morning.
[2:36:47] We are sure Lord that it was not only
[2:36:51] brother Biscll
[2:36:53] but it was
[2:36:55] your spirit through every one of us
[2:36:58] speaking back to us Lord
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; and building up that faith
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; that nobody else could give us but you
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; now as we go on our ways
[2:37:11] please be with us and bring us back here
[2:37:13] tonight
[2:37:15] for a worship Lord.
[2:37:17] that the world will never understand.
[2:37:21] Praise be your holy name. Amen.
[2:37:25] Amen.
[2:37:27] Hallelujah.
[2:37:30] God bless you.
[2:37:32] And between the service of this morning
[2:37:34] and this evening,
[2:37:36] I would like to encourage you
[2:37:39] along the line of a plan. Nothing
[2:37:42] happens without a plan. And I think it
[2:37:46] would be real good if you just go home
[2:37:48] and ponder this afternoon. What is my
[2:37:52] spiritual plan
[2:37:54] in this coming year? Not a resolution, a
[2:37:57] plan. Something that
[2:38:00] say, well,
[2:38:02] you know, if you don't have a plan,
[2:38:03] nothing really happens. Say, well, I
[2:38:05] want to read the Bible more. Well, that
[2:38:07] doesn't really doesn't really work. But
[2:38:09] if you set a plan, say, you know, this
[2:38:11] is what is on my heart to do. And I I'm
[2:38:14] going to do that. I'm And I I pray for
[2:38:17] this church.
[2:38:19] This church will be the greatest witness
[2:38:23] year of our entire existence.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you. In the name of Jesus,
[2:38:28] you're dismissed.
[2:38:31] Amen.
