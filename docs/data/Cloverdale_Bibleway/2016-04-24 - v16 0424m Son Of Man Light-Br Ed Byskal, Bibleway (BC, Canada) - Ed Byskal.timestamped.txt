[2:36] morning. Amen. It's really special to

[2:41] raising of our Lord Jesus Christ, not
[2:43] only 2,000 years ago, but in our lives
[2:46] today. Amen. It's the power of the
[2:47] resurrection. It's the resurrection life
[2:49] that's being raised up in us. And we're

[3:03] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a song this morning.
[3:06] All the way my savior leads me. I'm so
[3:08] thankful for the leading of the savior
[3:10] in our lives and
[3:13] it's uh number 812.
[3:18] Brother Ed mentioned this song last
[3:20] Sunday and I uh I looked it up and it's
[3:24] a an old Fanny Crosby song and
[3:28] there's a little testimony. she had uh
[3:30] had need of a little bit of uh funds
[3:33] financially in her life and and as it
[3:36] was her way, she began to pray. And um
[3:40] it didn't take too long and someone came
[3:42] by her door and all she needed was $5,
[3:48] but the Lord provided.
[3:50] [Music]
[3:58] It's the Holy Spirit.
[4:02] Let's just sing it together.
[4:07] All the way
[4:09] my Savior leads me. What have I to ask
[4:15] beside
[4:17] can I doubt his tender mercy? Who
[4:21] through life has been my God.
[4:26] Heavenly peace divided comfort here by
[4:31] faith in him to dwell.
[4:35] For I know what air be falling.
[4:39] Jesus do with all things well.
[4:44] For I know what befall me. Jesus knew
[4:50] with all things well.
[4:54] All the way my savior leads me. Here's
[4:59] each winding time I pray.
[5:03] Gives me grace for every trial.
[5:07] Teach me with the living bread.
[5:11] Though my weary steps may alter and my
[5:17] soul of thirst may
[5:20] gushing from the rock before me. Low a
[5:25] spring of joy I see.
[5:29] Gushing from the rock before me. Lowest
[5:34] spring of joy I see.
[5:39] All the way my savior leads me. For the
[5:44] fullness
[5:45] of his love, perfect rest to me is
[5:50] promised in my father's house above.
[5:56] When my spirit clothed immortals
[6:03] realms of day,
[6:05] this my song through endless ages.
[6:09] Jesus led me all the way.
[6:14] This my song through endless ages.
[6:18] Jesus led me all the way. Let's sing
[6:22] that third verse once more. All the way
[6:26] my savior leads me. Oh, the fullness
[6:31] of his love. Perfect rest to me is
[6:36] promise in my father's house above.
[6:42] When my spirit clothed immortal
[6:46] wings its flight to realms of day.
[6:51] This my song through endless ages.
[6:55] Jesus led me all the way.
[7:00] This my song through aes
[7:04] Jesus led me all the way.
[7:11] Amen. Let's just sing. He leadeth me, oh
[7:14] blessed rock.
[7:16] We just want the shepherd to lead us.
[7:18] Amen.
[7:20] He leadth
[7:22] me, oh blessed
[7:26] are all words with heavenly
[7:31] comfort thrown.
[7:35] Whatever
[7:37] I do, wherever I be,
[7:42] still his God hand that leadth to me.
[7:50] He leadth me. He
[7:55] me by his own hand
[8:02] me.
[8:04] his faithful
[8:06] power where I would be for
[8:12] his hand.
[8:18] Sometimes
[8:19] it seems
[8:24] sometimes
[8:25] where
[8:27] I
[8:29] [Music]
[8:33] still
[8:40] his hand.
[8:46] He
[8:51] might
[8:55] be
[8:59] his faithful
[9:01] power. I would be for
[9:07] his hand. He leadth me.
[9:12] Lord I would bless my hand in mine no
[9:20] further
[9:21] glory high
[9:25] contend
[9:27] whatever
[9:29] long I seek
[9:33] is my God that
[9:39] He
[9:41] [Music]
[9:46] by his hand
[9:52] his faithful
[9:55] power I would be for my hand.
[10:03] [Music]
[10:06] And when
[10:07] My task on earth is done. In my thy gra
[10:19] even
[10:22] I will not
[10:26] say
[10:28] your name
[10:30] [Music]
[10:34] and
[10:36] [Music]
[10:39] body for and he
[10:48] all I would be for his hand.
[10:56] [Music]
[10:59] If her day, my soul indeed that ancient
[11:07] flame a fire to
[11:14] life on earth through day
[11:19] the Lord return
[11:22] to me again.
[11:25] for
[11:27] everyone.
[11:31] [Music]
[11:38] His faithful
[11:41] follow
[11:46] his hand.
[11:52] Amen. Let's just stand together and
[11:54] sing. Lead me Lord, I will follow.
[11:57] Lead me Lord,
[12:01] I
[12:03] will follow.
[12:06] Lead me, Lord.
[12:09] I will go.
[12:14] You have called me.
[12:18] I will answer.
[12:21] Lead me, Lord.
[12:24] I will go.
[12:28] Oh, lead me alone.
[12:32] I will follow.
[12:36] Lead me Lord.
[12:39] I will go.
[12:44] You have called me and I will answer
[12:51] thee, Lord.
[12:54] I will go
[12:57] holy with me Lord.
[13:02] I will fall
[13:06] me.
[13:09] I will
[13:14] call me
[13:16] and I will answer
[13:21] me Lord.
[13:23] I
[13:25] will go.
[13:28] Flow through me.
[13:32] Holy
[13:33] Spirit
[13:35] flow through me.
[13:40] Oh Jesus, have your way this morning.
[13:44] Flow through us, Lord Jesus.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, come down, Lord. Minister
[13:53] to our lives this morning, Lord.
[13:57] my hands to worship and to magnify
[14:05] me.
[14:07] Through me,
[14:09] Holy Spirit
[14:13] through me.
[14:15] Then sing that once more.
[14:21] Holy
[14:23] Spirit,
[14:24] [Music]
[14:30] Lord,
[14:33] Holy Spirit, glory
[14:42] as I lift my hands to worship
[14:48] and You magnify
[14:51] thy name.
[14:56] Holy Spirit
[15:00] through me.
[15:05] Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[15:09] Hallelujah. We have some prayer requests
[15:11] here this morning.
[15:14] um
[15:16] says, "Please pray for the Anderson's
[15:17] baby girl born this last week. Doctors
[15:20] have found a hole in her heart and will
[15:22] have to do surgery in the next couple of
[15:24] weeks. They are praying for a miracle so
[15:27] the doctors won't have to do surgery."
[15:30] Amen.
[15:32] Uh could you please pray for a young
[15:34] mother with five children? Been told she
[15:37] has arthritis that's keeping her from
[15:38] caring for her children. It's an
[15:40] unspoken
[15:42] request and
[15:44] brother Javier writes in um the
[15:48] earthquake that took place in Ecuador
[15:50] last week.
[15:52] There's a pastor that has died when the
[15:54] church crumbled and some brothers with
[15:57] him had also passed away. Others are
[16:00] still missing.
[16:02] pastor's daughter also passed away last
[16:04] night and we just want to remember that
[16:06] need before the Lord and
[16:09] it's uh very tragic and there's a church
[16:13] without a shepherd and we just pray that
[16:15] God will intervene and have his way
[16:19] and many needs here this morning. We
[16:22] just bring them before the Lord and God
[16:24] is able to supply all of our needs.
[16:29] He is that great fountain.
[16:32] The inexhaustible fountain.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; His hand is not too His arm is not too
[16:37] short. His hand is not weak, but he is
[16:41] able to provide. Amen. Just going to ask
[16:44] brother John Andes to come and take us
[16:47] before the throne of grace.
[16:51] Bless you, brother John.
[16:54] Amen. If you have a need, just hold it
[16:55] up before the Lord. He knows all about
[16:57] it, but he wants our faith just to make
[17:00] a connection.
[17:02] Our heavenly father, we thank you for
[17:04] the atmosphere that's in this service.
[17:07] We thank you for the songs that we've
[17:08] been able to sing. Each one of them have
[17:11] spoken of leadership, have spoken of our
[17:14] faith being released. To you our great
[17:17] shepherd, to you our father, to you our
[17:20] provider, to you our husband. Lord, we
[17:22] come this morning with faith believing,
[17:25] lifting up our hands, Lord, as a group
[17:27] of people, as a congregation of
[17:29] believers, just inviting your Holy
[17:32] Spirit to come into this meeting. Come
[17:34] into our lives, Lord Jesus. Each one of
[17:37] us are so needy without you, Lord. We
[17:39] are nothing, Father. We want to repent
[17:42] of any sins, Lord, and lay our lives out
[17:45] before this altar as bear, Lord. We need
[17:48] your appearing, Lord, and your presence
[17:50] this morning. As these needs were read
[17:52] out and as lives are bare before you, we
[17:55] live in a desperate time, God. We live
[17:58] in a very troublesome hour, Lord. Men's
[18:01] hearts are failing them for fear and
[18:03] lives are being shredded by Satan's
[18:05] plans and schemes, Lord. But we believe
[18:08] your plan is greater than all of Satan's
[18:11] plans. the plan of redemption, the plan
[18:14] of salvation, the plan of healing, God,
[18:17] the plan of deliverance. Father, you are
[18:20] our comforter. You are our joy. You are
[18:23] our peace, Lord. And Lord, we want to
[18:25] confess, Lord, your attributes are
[18:27] greater than any of Satan's plans from
[18:31] the from the garden. And even before
[18:33] when he was cast out of heaven, it's
[18:35] always been his scheme to undermine and
[18:38] break trust. But today, Lord, after all
[18:41] these years, Lord, we're so happy that
[18:44] you're standing on the earth and a group
[18:46] of people, Lord, that love your
[18:47] appearing, God. We're under that spirit
[18:50] of prophecy that there would be a bride
[18:52] rise up in the last days that would
[18:55] believe you for the impossible and the
[18:57] dead have been raised up, Lord. Miracles
[19:00] have been done, healings, Lord, and
[19:02] lives that have been brought out of sin,
[19:04] Lord. us listening to your prophet
[19:07] talking about the woman at the well, how
[19:09] her life was crashed and crushed going
[19:12] through five husbands and married to
[19:14] another man. And Lord, but when she
[19:16] heard the word for her day, she didn't
[19:19] need that water pot no more. She just
[19:21] dropped it, Lord, and ran into the city.
[19:24] Lord, may we today have that great
[19:26] liberation of faith that our Messiah is
[19:29] here. The answer is here. The very
[19:32] answer to our request is within this
[19:35] building, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[19:37] Heavenly Father, we want to bring these
[19:39] three requests, Lord, that were spoken
[19:41] out, Lord, so needy. Thinking of the one
[19:44] that was born with a hole in its heart,
[19:46] Lord, but Lord, there's been those in
[19:48] our own assembly. Little children have
[19:51] been born with heart problems, and you,
[19:53] Lord, have done a change within their
[19:55] lives, God, physically, spiritually.
[19:57] Lord, we all had a hole in our heart.
[20:00] Would you touch this little life, Lord
[20:02] God, and the mother, Lord, that has
[20:04] need, Lord, this arthritis attacking
[20:07] her, Lord, this request with children,
[20:09] Father. I'm just thinking, Lord, how
[20:11] Satan comes to those that are so needy
[20:14] and tries to make it even worse, Lord.
[20:17] We're holding on to your word, God.
[20:19] You're the creator of life. You're the
[20:21] creator, God, that can speak to a womb
[20:24] and bring life today. And this last
[20:27] request, Lord, the pastor and Ecuador
[20:29] and his own daughter and family and
[20:32] believers crushed, Lord. Father, would
[20:34] you come by that way today? Be the
[20:37] shepherd to the elect, oh God. You will
[20:39] not lose one of your seed, oh God. Lord,
[20:42] there's great faith within the building
[20:44] today, God. You're moving, Lord, within
[20:46] our souls, Lord. And I pray you'd
[20:49] comfort lives, Lord, and be with
[20:51] families, be with hearts that are even
[20:53] broken today, even in our own midst,
[20:55] Lord. There's unspoken requests. Some
[20:58] have their hands lifted up, Lord, like
[21:00] it was reaching out for a lifeline.
[21:03] Lord, may you come and meet our needs
[21:04] today. May you pour out your service,
[21:07] Lord. Your your spirit in the service,
[21:09] oh God, through our pastor, through the
[21:12] anointed channel, God. May you meet
[21:14] every need in divine presence, unspoken
[21:17] hearts and lives that are quivering,
[21:20] even shaking. Maybe they're so in a
[21:23] place of doubt or fear. Satan's got
[21:25] them. But may you turn it around, Lord,
[21:28] and bring faith today to our hearts.
[21:31] Lord, you have done so well over the
[21:33] years by taking care of us just right.
[21:36] And we want to give you glory, Lord, and
[21:38] believe for the impossible. There is
[21:40] nothing that is impossible with you,
[21:43] Lord. Even bless the offering and
[21:45] multiply it, God, and use it, Lord, to
[21:48] take this message around the world and
[21:50] continually even behind this pulpit. May
[21:53] the Holy Spirit continue to lead and
[21:55] guide us as we look to you today for the
[21:58] answers. Lord Jesus, we believe you,
[22:01] Lord. We believe the spoken word today
[22:03] has the answers for the very heart's cry
[22:06] within our bosom. Come, Lord Jesus,
[22:09] come. And you'll bring it across the
[22:11] platform and minister it even throughout
[22:14] Reinton today in Victoria and throughout
[22:16] this whole Northwest, Lord, and
[22:18] throughout the world. Your Holy Spirit
[22:20] is meeting the elect, the bride of Jesus
[22:23] Christ. We thank you for that, Lord. Go
[22:26] with us throughout this day, gentle
[22:28] shepherd and lead and guide us in your
[22:30] word. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. We
[22:34] thank you and give you glory, Lord, and
[22:36] appreciate you, Lord, for your present,
[22:38] close, near. Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; John, you may have your seats as you
[22:47] take up the offering this morning. God
[22:49] bless you.
[22:52] Praise the Lord.
[22:54] [Music]
[22:56] We'll sing a couple courses while they
[22:58] take up the offering. And Brother
[23:00] Andrew's got a special with the choir
[23:02] and we'll have them come up right after
[23:04] we sing a couple of courses.
[23:07] Let's just sing. Why don't you lead me
[23:09] to the rock that is higher than I? Yes,
[23:11] sir.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] Why don't you lead me to the rock that
[23:21] is higher than I
[23:25] lead?
[23:26] [Music]
[23:30] Why don't you lead me to the rock that
[23:34] is higher than I? Oh, thou has been a
[23:39] shelter for me.
[23:43] I don't believe you
[23:46] that is higher than I
[23:55] don't lead me to the rock that is higher
[24:00] behavior
[24:02] [Music]
[24:08] to the rock that is higher than
[24:16] for me.
[24:19] Why don't you
[24:21] rock that is higher than I? Thou has
[24:26] been a shelter for me.
[24:31] Amen. God bless you.
[24:37] Amen.
[24:43] God bless you this morning. Um, I just
[24:45] want to say this song was written by a
[24:47] sister in Florida who's passed away now,
[24:49] but um, she wrote it during a hurricane
[24:52] and they were all evacuated and uh, she
[24:55] worked for the state, I believe,
[24:57] documenting damage and stuff. And, um,
[24:59] when she got the report of what had
[25:01] happened to her home in her area, she
[25:02] began to write these words down. So, I
[25:04] trust that it'll bless you. And um I
[25:06] just want to thank everybody singing
[25:08] here because they didn't know about this
[25:09] until midnight last night, each one of
[25:12] them and the musicians. So just want to
[25:14] thank you all.
[25:17] [Music]
[25:34] Strong winds are blowing
[25:37] with an unrelenting force.
[25:42] People running to and fro. They don't
[25:45] know what's going on.
[25:49] Men's hearts are failing because of
[25:53] turmoil in the land.
[25:57] Church doors are closing. Preachers just
[26:01] can't take a stand. But it's going to
[26:04] take a stronger wind than this
[26:07] to keep me from my promises. It's going
[26:11] to take a stronger wind than this
[26:15] to turn
[26:17] me around. It's going to take a stronger
[26:20] wind than this
[26:22] &gt;&gt; because my feet are on solid ground.
[26:29] [Music]
[26:35] People are searching for the true and
[26:39] living God.
[26:42] There's a famine in the land and the
[26:46] word seems null and void.
[26:48] [Music]
[26:50] They have eyes but cannot see. They have
[26:53] ears but cannot hear.
[26:57] If they only knew the scripture, they
[27:00] know Jesus Christ is here. But it's
[27:03] going to take a stronger wind than this
[27:07] won't keep me from my promises. It's
[27:11] going to take a stronger wind than this
[27:15] to turn
[27:17] me around. It's going to take a stronger
[27:20] wind than this
[27:22] because my feet are on solid ground.
[27:31] [Music]
[27:34] Christians are living
[27:37] no different than the world.
[27:40] [Music]
[27:42] Claiming to know the Lord, but truly
[27:45] serving other gods.
[27:49] They call on him both day and night, but
[27:52] they can't produce the light.
[27:56] Anointed ones in the end time, rejecting
[28:00] the only Jesus Christ. But it's going to
[28:03] take a stronger wind than this. Won't
[28:07] you keep me from my promises? It's going
[28:10] to take a stronger wind than this to
[28:14] turn
[28:16] me around. It's going to take a stronger
[28:19] wind than this
[28:21] &gt;&gt; because my feet are on solid ground.
[28:27] Oh, it's going to take a stronger wind
[28:30] than this.
[28:32] to keep me from my promises. It's going
[28:36] to take a stronger wind than this
[28:40] to turn
[28:42] me around. It's going to take a stronger
[28:45] wind than this
[28:47] because my feet are on solid ground.
[28:53] Oh, it's going to take a stronger wind
[28:56] than this
[28:58] &gt;&gt; to keep me from my promises. It's going
[29:02] to take a stronger wind than this to
[29:06] turn
[29:08] me around. It's going to take a stronger
[29:11] wind than this because my feet are on
[29:16] solid ground.
[29:20] Amen.
[29:22] [Music]
[29:31] [Applause]
[29:35] Thank you, brother Andrew and choir and
[29:36] musicians. We really appreciate that so
[29:39] much. I just love songs of declaration.
[29:42] The bride rising up and taking her
[29:44] position. Amen. Just thrills my soul.
[29:48] Praise God. Let's just sing that song as
[29:50] brother Ed comes. God is good all the
[29:52] time. Puts a song of praise in this
[29:55] heart of mine.
[30:00] God is good
[30:02] [Music]
[30:04] all the time.
[30:06] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[30:11] of mine. God is good
[30:16] all the time.
[30:18] Through the dark night, it lights.
[30:24] God is good.
[30:27] God is good
[30:30] all the time.
[30:33] When you're walking
[30:36] through the valley
[30:39] and the shadow
[30:42] all around
[30:45] [Music]
[30:47] God will guide me.
[30:50] We will be sing and
[30:55] glory and bright
[30:58] [Music]
[31:04] and worthy
[31:07] [Music]
[31:10] all the time.
[31:12] He puts a song of praise in this part of
[31:17] my God is good
[31:21] all the time
[31:24] through
[31:27] his life.
[31:29] God is good.
[31:32] Oh, he's so good
[31:35] all the time. Let's all stand in the
[31:37] sixth and second verse.
[31:40] Oh, we were sinners.
[31:43] Oh, I'm worthy.
[31:46] But for I see
[31:49] to die
[31:51] to the
[31:54] Holy Spirit
[31:58] and testify
[32:02] that his love
[32:05] is everlasting
[32:08] and his mercy.
[32:10] All day
[32:12] and God is good
[32:16] all the time.
[32:19] [Music]
[32:24] God is good
[32:27] all the time.
[32:29] Through the darkest night, his light
[32:33] still shines. God is good.
[32:38] God is good.
[32:40] all the time.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen to that.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; He's certainly been faithful, hasn't he?
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Led you this week, protected you,
[32:55] provided,
[32:56] &gt;&gt; brought us all together.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Let's just have a word of prayer before
[33:01] we turn to the word.
[33:04] Dear heavenly father,
[33:06] &gt;&gt; you're the almighty one, the giver of
[33:09] all good gifts.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; You're the giver of life. You have given
[33:14] us salvation.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; You've given us a message.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; You have come down and proven it. You
[33:21] have confirmed and vindicated.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; You have been so liberal, oh God, with
[33:27] your presence.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; You've come amongst us. You've come to
[33:31] us in our homes, in our cars, in our
[33:34] bedrooms.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; You've come to us at the strangest times
[33:39] and you have spoken.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; You know how to speak to hearts. And so
[33:44] I pray that this morning you will cause
[33:46] me to say words, Lord, that will stay in
[33:50] the hearts of the people. Perhaps just a
[33:52] word or a phrase. Perhaps something you
[33:56] will take out of the message, out of the
[33:58] scriptures and illuminate us. Oh God, I
[34:01] ask that you will illuminate us. Help us
[34:04] to understand not only that where we are
[34:07] this morning in a sanctuary, but help us
[34:10] to understand Lord that you have us
[34:13] where we are in your program in Jesus
[34:16] name for your glory. Amen.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:23] I'm going to have some scripture
[34:26] reading. Going to be doing some things
[34:27] different today.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; And I guess that'll be Don't be don't be
[34:33] spooked with what's covered here. It's
[34:35] very simple. It's just I want to make
[34:37] some reference to tapes and and the
[34:40] things that we have done, things that
[34:43] you have done, and I want to bring it to
[34:46] the scripture and ask some very serious
[34:50] questions. you know, uh,
[34:53] even the prophet of God when he was
[34:55] speaking, he didn't always
[34:57] declare
[34:59] precisely where we are. It's always been
[35:02] a a a I will say a bit of a problem with
[35:06] humans.
[35:09] One of our weaknesses is we are
[35:13] uh very very weak to realize where we
[35:17] are
[35:19] and where we are in time.
[35:23] Uh for example, Jesus said to the
[35:26] disciples they they asked a question.
[35:29] And they said, "Why do the Pharisees
[35:31] say?" So now it was something that they
[35:33] were asking of the religious leaders.
[35:37] Why do the Pharisees say that Elias or
[35:40] Elijah must first come?
[35:43] And Jesus said, "Well, he he he will
[35:46] come and fulfill all things, but I say
[35:49] unto thee that he's come already,
[35:52] and you and they missed it."
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Right. That's the weakness I'm talking
[35:57] about of something happening and it
[36:01] passes by and then we Oh, that's what
[36:05] happened. We don't want to do that.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be far better to be in tune
[36:13] &gt;&gt; if God made it available for you to be
[36:16] in tune? And so maybe this morning we'll
[36:20] just tweak it a wee bit,
[36:23] &gt;&gt; turn up our our interest or our make us
[36:26] more keen. Now if you think that we've
[36:29] just come to a Sunday service and you
[36:32] know this will be another service, well
[36:34] that's what it'll be.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; But if you think well maybe there's
[36:38] something to this. I should be I should
[36:42] be a little more alert. I should just
[36:45] give myself. That's what I would ask you
[36:47] to do. And brother Brandamman, I think
[36:49] in the service of the message u souls
[36:53] that are in prison one and the other
[36:57] message would be sers is this the time
[37:00] and he asked is is this the time? Is
[37:03] this it friends? Is is this the time? He
[37:07] wasn't absolutely certain himself of is
[37:11] this the time? He said and he was so
[37:14] earnest about it. He said, "I've got
[37:15] friends. I've got family here. Is this
[37:18] the time? Is Is this where we're at?"
[37:23] So, I don't know if I'll be able to get
[37:25] to it, but I want to ask us, you know,
[37:29] when I get into some of the scriptures
[37:31] and the phrases of the messages, you
[37:34] say, "Well, I've heard that before." No,
[37:36] you haven't heard it in this particular
[37:41] vein or direction before because I've
[37:44] been asking myself this for a very long
[37:46] time and now I've been working for quite
[37:51] a long time some weeks just to try to
[37:54] put this together and uh so we will we
[37:59] will look to the scripture. I would like
[38:00] to call the service today my comments to
[38:04] you will be son of man light.
[38:09] I want to speak about the light and the
[38:12] son of man light
[38:15] and then we will be going to scriptures.
[38:18] I'm going to have the scriptures on the
[38:20] on the screen first because I'm reading
[38:24] a number of scriptures and it would be
[38:26] uh uh maybe a distraction for you to try
[38:28] to follow one verse at a time.
[38:32] So, we could dim the lights please, a
[38:34] little bit if we would.
[38:43] Then Jesus spoke again
[38:46] unto them, saying, I am the light of the
[38:51] world. He that followth, and I want to
[38:53] stop there. Followeth is a a verb. It is
[38:59] an action word. That means there's is is
[39:02] progressive.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; He that followth me.
[39:07] And you can't follow Jesus as it was
[39:11] back then because he was in a physical
[39:13] form. So what does that mean to you and
[39:17] I? He that followeth or progressive
[39:20] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[39:24] but shall have the light of life.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; So to walk is to be progressive.
[39:32] To follow is to be progressive.
[39:36] We should not be today where we were
[39:38] last week.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are to be
[39:41] progressive.
[39:43] But if we walk in the light as he is in
[39:46] the light, we have fellowship one with
[39:49] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[39:52] his son cleanseth us from all sin. Now
[39:55] friends, we're not reading a story book.
[39:58] We're not reading a paperback. We are
[40:00] reading the word of God. And it and it
[40:03] clearly declares that our fellowship is
[40:06] based upon our fellowship with one
[40:08] another is based upon walking or if we
[40:13] walk in the light as he is in the light.
[40:16] It's progressive once again. But if we
[40:19] walk in the light as he is in the light,
[40:21] we have fellowship somehow. We got that
[40:24] same one there. So we'll go on to the
[40:27] next one. F for ye were sometimes
[40:32] darkness,
[40:33] &gt;&gt; but now are you light
[40:36] &gt;&gt; in the Lord. Walk as children of light.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Ye are all the children of light and the
[40:45] children of the day. We are not of the
[40:48] night. Can you say amen?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Nor of the darkness.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[40:55] You are the children of light.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, you're the children of
[41:01] you're you're the product of life.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; You are the sons and daughters of light.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture is saying.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; We are not the product of. We are the
[41:17] offspring of the light.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters born of the light.
[41:23] You were of the light. Do you believe
[41:25] that?
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Either that or we're of a denomination
[41:29] or we're of a church or we're of a club
[41:32] or we're of a society. But the but Jesus
[41:36] is saying in the scripture, you are of
[41:39] the light. You are a product of the
[41:41] light. You stand here today. You say,
[41:44] "Well, I'm the product of my mother and
[41:46] father." It's got to go beyond that. as
[41:49] your mother and father, you'll die like
[41:52] your mother and father. You'll die like
[41:54] your grandparents, but we're something
[41:57] more than that.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; And the question is, where did the light
[42:01] come from? And that's what we'll be
[42:03] going into. You may have your seats.
[42:21] that there are many forms of light.
[42:26] The Bible tells us that God in the
[42:28] beginning he made two great lights.
[42:32] The greater light to rule the day and
[42:34] the lesser light to rule the night and
[42:38] he made the stars also.
[42:42] So he made the sun. We have electricity
[42:46] powers our homes, power so many things,
[42:51] wanting to power cars,
[42:54] equipment,
[42:56] and if we had uh a power outage, things
[43:00] really become very chaotic quickly.
[43:04] And then there's
[43:06] uh power for our equipment and power
[43:10] actually laser power. I could take a
[43:12] laser here and and and it would you'd
[43:16] have a light on the screen and you'd be
[43:19] able to see what I want to point at. A
[43:22] laser the actually the term laser which
[43:25] I didn't know until I had just run into
[43:28] this. It is the short for light
[43:32] amplification
[43:35] by stimulated emission of radiation
[43:40] laser. That's where it comes from.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And laser, they have laser therapy and
[43:46] laser. I had a very, very bad cut on
[43:48] this finger and it was black
[43:52] and it was dark and it was a large cut
[43:55] almost to the bone. Did it up hunting
[43:58] and I had to go to a hospital in
[44:00] Cornell. Got there late at night and
[44:03] they had a doctor come in and stitch the
[44:06] thing up. But it was all dark with soot
[44:09] because it happened on a with a stove.
[44:12] And I thought, well, am I going to go
[44:14] through life like that? And I spoke with
[44:17] brother Otto here and he spoke to a
[44:19] specialist and they have a special laser
[44:22] thing. I had to put lead
[44:25] uh over my eyes and so on. And he's got
[44:29] a little deal and uh he just comes and
[44:32] goes. He's zapping this thing. And I
[44:36] said, "What? Well, what is that doing?
[44:37] It just felt like a elastic was snapping
[44:40] on my hand. I said, "What is that
[44:43] doing?" And he just kind of smiles. And
[44:45] he's got special goggles on as well. And
[44:48] he says, "Well, it just breaks it up."
[44:51] And uh your blood will carry it away.
[44:54] And I thought, "Praise God, God's got a
[44:58] laser light, too." and he just zaps my
[45:01] soul and my heart and all the unbelief
[45:03] and the blood carries it away.
[45:07] So I got a message out of that.
[45:10] I thought that was fantastic and now you
[45:13] can't see it. You can't see it at all
[45:15] thanks to laser. So I'm happy that they
[45:18] have you know devised and uh uh have
[45:22] come up with some of these uh
[45:26] advancements.
[45:28] So, we have laser surgery, laser optics,
[45:31] and scanners, and laser printers, and on
[45:34] and on and on we go. So, we're thankful
[45:36] for that. And I can have a switch. I was
[45:40] going to bring a switch,
[45:42] an electrical switch. Well, it's not
[45:44] worth very much, maybe worth 30 cents,
[45:47] but and it has a switch on it. And you
[45:49] say, well, you know where we got
[45:52] switches all over here. But the switch
[45:54] wouldn't do any good if it didn't have a
[45:57] source of power.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; So, you've got to be connected. You may
[46:02] you may be able to switch things on and
[46:04] switch things off, but you've got to be
[46:06] connected to a power source.
[46:10] And then something that
[46:13] I was interested in and it's amazing how
[46:15] it spiritually applies as well. There
[46:19] are conductors.
[46:21] There are certain metals that are very
[46:24] very good to conduct power. Isn't that
[46:29] right, brother Joe Waldner?
[46:33] Our electrician
[46:35] in-house electrician.
[46:38] So you have metals that will be very
[46:40] very good to conduct power and to send
[46:44] it and in fact is I understand that
[46:47] there are three metals that are very
[46:50] very good. Pure silver,
[46:53] pure copper and pure gold. Those are the
[46:56] three top ones. Pure silver,
[47:00] pure copper and pure gold. They will be
[47:05] the best conductors of electricity
[47:09] and to give us power. But on the other
[47:12] hand, there's also something that they
[47:15] call resistors,
[47:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; So in a church, we want to be a
[47:20] conductor but not a resistor.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; And a carbon carbon are resistors. They
[47:27] make resistors, all kinds of resistors.
[47:31] And it depends on what kind of current
[47:33] it is and how you want to resist it. And
[47:36] so equipment is full of resistors,
[47:39] &gt;&gt; you know, all all electronics we've got
[47:42] up here. And we've got power coming in,
[47:45] but there will be one place, you know,
[47:48] and this is all part of the scheme and
[47:50] part of tech technology. So we want
[47:53] something to resist. But when it comes
[47:56] to the power of God
[47:58] &gt;&gt; and when it comes to the light of the
[48:00] gospel, we only want conductors.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; We don't need resistors.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And it's an amazing thing in the
[48:09] scripture. It talks about Janice and
[48:12] Jambre
[48:14] &gt;&gt; and they were resistors.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; They resisted the gospel. They resisted
[48:20] Moses and they to their own loss and
[48:23] damnation. They resisted what God was
[48:26] doing. And there are many that resist
[48:28] the message
[48:30] &gt;&gt; because they feel that it doesn't agree
[48:32] with what I think. Who cares what I
[48:35] think?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Who cares what anybody thinks? Who cares
[48:38] what a school of theology develops? Who
[48:42] cares about that? They've been in
[48:43] confusion for hundreds of years and they
[48:46] want me to extend that or they want you
[48:49] to extend it. No, I I don't want
[48:51] anything to do with that. I want to
[48:53] something that God has evidenced and
[48:56] proven this is a power
[48:59] &gt;&gt; and that this is a light
[49:01] &gt;&gt; and it's a light for your life.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; It's a light to give you a direction.
[49:06] Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't even the most
[49:09] serious things in life you are you are
[49:12] helpless to make succeed
[49:17] &gt;&gt; people there used to be a phrase and
[49:19] there still is a phrase I want to be
[49:21] happy. Oh is that something new? I want
[49:24] to be happy. Everybody wants to be
[49:26] happy. And so religious and uh Christian
[49:30] movements get on that say well you want
[49:32] to be happy come and join us. I can tell
[49:35] you that doesn't make a person happy.
[49:38] When you just join somebody, but when
[49:40] you become joined to Christ and you're
[49:43] free from your sins, you will be
[49:46] automatically happy and you will be
[49:49] connected to a supernatural power that
[49:53] will give a light into your life. And
[49:55] tell me, let me tell you friends, I've
[49:58] experienced that even recently where we
[50:00] have to have a light. We have to have
[50:02] God to do things supernaturally in our
[50:06] lives.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; And when he does, honor it.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; When he does, thank him for it.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; So, are we all right?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; You got along where I'm going.
[50:23] So, we have conductors and we have
[50:27] resistors. And we want to say that light
[50:29] serves many purposes
[50:32] but none
[50:34] as important. And I'm going slow for a
[50:36] purpose.
[50:38] Light serves many purposes but none I'm
[50:42] talking about you. None as important as
[50:45] spiritual
[50:47] enlightenment.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why I read the scriptures.
[50:53] Jesus said, "I
[50:56] am the light of the world." And I can
[50:59] tell you that's a light that the hydro
[51:01] company can never produce.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; There's no generator that can ever
[51:08] produce this kind of light.
[51:11] It's a glorious light.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire was a light.
[51:18] And it attracted Moses,
[51:20] who wasn't a prophet yet, but he was
[51:23] born a prophet.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; And he didn't know why he was what he
[51:27] was to do. And he didn't know how he was
[51:30] to do it. And he's off in the wilderness
[51:32] as a failure, as a vagabond,
[51:36] as a murderer.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; He killed a man. And this man's going to
[51:40] be a prophet.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, God knows what he's
[51:43] doing. Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And if we walk in the light, how do you
[51:50] walk in the light?
[51:51] &gt;&gt; What kind of light is this?
[51:53] &gt;&gt; It's not a light you just switch on and
[51:56] off. What kind of light is it? I'll tell
[51:58] you when you need There isn't a person
[52:01] here, I'm not preaching to just a few.
[52:03] There isn't a person here, there isn't a
[52:05] person streaming this service today that
[52:08] doesn't need a divine light of this son
[52:12] of man shining in their life or you will
[52:16] never make it successfully through life.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Never.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; There's a light of knowledge. There's a
[52:23] light of wisdom. There's a light that we
[52:25] gain educationally. But let me tell you
[52:29] that light will never guide you. There
[52:31] are people that are very very
[52:32] intelligent
[52:34] &gt;&gt; and I just saw a documentary on Einstein
[52:37] and a prophet of God said that Einstein
[52:41] uh almost broke into God's laboratory
[52:44] into God's laboratory. He almost had
[52:47] discovered but he just lacked the
[52:49] supernatural aspect. He had the theory
[52:52] of relativity and changed things of the
[52:56] uh uh was considered the brightest
[52:58] brain. And then we have Stephen Hawking
[53:01] and these men I I went and heard Stephen
[53:03] Hawking down in uh Vancouver and he has
[53:07] to speak through a computer voice and so
[53:10] he has but he took questions and I I
[53:13] admired him for taking questions from
[53:15] the public and then uh with his computer
[53:18] and his assistant he's answering complex
[53:22] questions on the universe and on the
[53:25] particles and on uh the bend ing of
[53:29] light waves and so on. All these kind of
[53:32] questions that don't really pertain to
[53:34] life and he's terribly crippled. He's in
[53:37] a terrible terrible condition in this
[53:40] wheelchair and he's all crippled up like
[53:42] this. And I thought that how how sad and
[53:47] how inequitable it is that you know I'm
[53:50] here in a full body and strength and
[53:53] there he is and all that wisdom and all
[53:56] that knowledge. But I thought if he only
[54:00] knew,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; if he only knew that the Lord Jesus
[54:04] Christ, God himself
[54:07] &gt;&gt; who spoke, "Let there be light," that
[54:10] God has to say that to you and me, has
[54:13] to say that to you as an individual. And
[54:16] the younger you get it, the better it'll
[54:18] be.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; You need God to speak, "Let there be
[54:21] light."
[54:22] &gt;&gt; I want the light. I want my blessing.
[54:25] And my blessing will bring light to this
[54:27] young person and will bring light to
[54:30] this young man, this young woman, and
[54:32] will guide this family through life.
[54:35] Listen to me, friends. You need this
[54:37] light
[54:38] &gt;&gt; that I'm preaching about.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "For God who commanded
[54:48] the light to shine out of darkness
[54:52] hath shined into our hearts."
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] to give the light. Why did he shine into
[54:59] our hearts? I want you listening very
[55:01] carefully. To give the light of
[55:04] knowledge.
[55:07] That's true knowledge.
[55:09] This isn't to give the light of an
[55:11] opinion, to give the light of some human
[55:15] decision, to give the light of what
[55:17] might come out of the a a Bible school
[55:20] or a school of theology or some other
[55:23] place or some university or Harvard or
[55:28] some other wonderful place.
[55:31] You need a personal
[55:33] encounter with the author of light
[55:37] &gt;&gt; to give you the light of knowledge of
[55:40] the knowledge of the glory of God
[55:44] &gt;&gt; in the face of Jesus Christ.
[55:49] Now,
[55:51] I'm hesitant a wee bit because I'm going
[55:55] to be getting off into areas that are
[55:58] hard to describe. You'll need every
[56:02] ounce of gray matter that you have,
[56:06] every ounce of spiritual
[56:10] guidance,
[56:12] and you need to pray, "Father,
[56:16] let me catch
[56:18] what it is you're seeking to convey.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; I can't perhaps put it into words
[56:24] exactly, but I I'm commencing now to get
[56:26] into some thick water.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Do I have your attention?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; For God who commanded the light, God
[56:39] commanded the light to shine out of
[56:42] darkness
[56:43] when you knew nothing about him.
[56:46] When you're in darkness and you have all
[56:49] kind of rig religiosity and ideas and
[56:53] your own ideas and your own culture, you
[56:56] needed God.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; We might be Canadian or American or
[57:02] African or European or whatever we are,
[57:05] but we need God.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; The spirit of our nation couldn't give
[57:10] us this light.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Your education can never give you this
[57:15] light. Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Your human intelligence from your
[57:19] background or your parents or whatever
[57:21] more, your IQ will never give you this
[57:24] light.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Settle that, friends. We're lost in
[57:28] darkness.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter where we are, we can't
[57:32] come to the house of God with any human
[57:34] pride. We have nothing to offer.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? We have nothing to
[57:40] offer.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] God who commanded the light to shine out
[57:48] of darkness hath shined into our hearts.
[57:53] And the purpose is to give us the light
[57:56] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[58:00] in the face
[58:02] in the countenance
[58:05] of Jesus Christ. And when John
[58:08] saw the Lord Jesus Christ, one like unto
[58:11] the son of man
[58:14] in the in Revelation chapter 1 when he
[58:18] saw him and he end up this was John who
[58:20] walked with him. This was John who ate
[58:22] with him. This is John who who who
[58:25] stayed in the desert with him. This was
[58:27] John who knew him so well. But when he
[58:30] saw him in this light,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; he fell down at his feet as one dead.
[58:35] He didn't have anything to offer. He
[58:37] didn't say, "Well, I was a friend of the
[58:39] high priest.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; I was a friend who got Peter into the
[58:42] judgment hall. I I I knew you so well."
[58:46] No, he didn't know this one.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; He knew him at the moment for the
[58:51] moment. You may know him
[58:54] &gt;&gt; when he spoke to you at camp.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You may know him as he spoke to you and
[58:59] dealt with you in a certain moment of
[59:01] your life. But now we're progressing on.
[59:05] You're not where you were one week ago.
[59:07] You're progressing on. You need this
[59:10] light. You don't know what's happening
[59:12] tomorrow. You don't know what's going to
[59:14] happen in the world tomorrow. I can tell
[59:16] you, you're living in a very dangerous
[59:18] world.
[59:20] Tell me that this isn't a very dangerous
[59:22] world. Earthquakes happening where they
[59:24] don't know they're supposed to happen or
[59:26] that they will happen. All kinds of all
[59:29] kinds of powers. The economy goes up,
[59:32] the economy goes down. You don't know
[59:34] anything. You can't power. You can't
[59:36] guide that power. You need a light.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; You need a light to guide your life so
[59:42] that you can say Jesus led me all the
[59:46] way.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; And so in the light of his countenance
[59:54] and that is the the word face is
[59:57] actually the first word is vision.
[1:00:00] to look at or to allow oneself to be
[1:00:05] seen to appear in the face of Jesus
[1:00:10] Christ. You need a light when the Lord
[1:00:14] Jesus even himself
[1:00:17] and the power of God is making him
[1:00:19] known. You need a special capacity
[1:00:23] to be able to say it. Think of the two
[1:00:26] men on the way to Emmas. I I I I I I
[1:00:30] cannot get away from them and I will be
[1:00:32] touching on it maybe a little bit later
[1:00:34] on. But think of the two men on the way
[1:00:36] to Emmas. Did they know him? Oh, they
[1:00:39] knew him. They had eaten with him. They
[1:00:41] had done all these things. But they
[1:00:42] didn't know this one. Why? Because this
[1:00:45] was a few hours later. This was a few
[1:00:47] days later. You say, "Do you know God?"
[1:00:50] Oh yes, I know God. I can talk all about
[1:00:52] God. No, no, no. That's not what I'm
[1:00:54] talking about. I'm talking about the God
[1:00:56] who's trying to get near to you now
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; at this moment in time.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; And I just simply want to say we need
[1:01:06] it.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; We need it.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything spiritually or
[1:01:13] supernaturally to happen and miss it
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; unnecessarily. Miss it. I don't want to
[1:01:20] be so fogged in. I don't want to be so
[1:01:23] captured, captivated by the burdens and
[1:01:27] the weariesome of life. I don't want to
[1:01:30] do that and miss it.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Miss the most important thing of life
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; in the first
[1:01:42] it says in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:01:47] in the glory of God. Please just hang on
[1:01:51] to these words. Now I'm looking at you
[1:01:52] as a class
[1:01:54] in the first seal. First seal. Now it's
[1:01:58] not just a book. We're going to the
[1:02:00] first seal.
[1:02:02] That won't be the next night because it
[1:02:05] will be progressed to the second sale.
[1:02:08] Then it'll progress to the third seal
[1:02:11] and the fourth and the fifth and the
[1:02:13] sixth and the seventh.
[1:02:16] In the first seal,
[1:02:19] brother Brennan, he goes now as uh I
[1:02:22] want you to grasp as a prophet, as a
[1:02:25] messenger God maybe has sent to you if
[1:02:28] you accept that.
[1:02:32] And the messenger is saying now in John
[1:02:35] 12:23,
[1:02:37] he said, "Now listen here now real
[1:02:41] close."
[1:02:44] And you that perhaps don't understand
[1:02:47] my English real well, listen real close.
[1:02:54] He said, "Then you won't have to wonder
[1:02:56] no more what it is."
[1:03:02] And Jesus answering them, that's in the
[1:03:05] Bible,
[1:03:07] saying, "The hour is come that the Son
[1:03:11] of Man
[1:03:13] should be glorified." Speaking about him
[1:03:17] and Brother Brandham says, "See,
[1:03:19] you were at the end of an age there."
[1:03:22] His ministry is ending
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; because he's soon going to be going to
[1:03:28] Calvary. He's soon going to be going to
[1:03:31] the cross.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; He's soon going to be silent. He's not
[1:03:35] going to say anything. He's not going to
[1:03:37] do any miracles. It's the end of an age.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And things are changing. And people who
[1:03:46] know him so well won't know him in two
[1:03:48] or three days
[1:03:50] unless the light would shine on them and
[1:03:54] into their heart. And so it says
[1:03:58] you're at the end of the age. His
[1:04:00] ministry is ending. The hour is come.
[1:04:03] This is what Jesus said. The hour has
[1:04:05] come that the son of man should be
[1:04:08] glorified.
[1:04:10] He said, "What about the hour?" He
[1:04:12] breaks. What about the hour has come
[1:04:17] when his bride must be taken away?
[1:04:22] I say to this church in this
[1:04:24] congregation, what about the hour
[1:04:27] that comes when the bride shall be taken
[1:04:31] away?
[1:04:33] What about that hour? I I I may not know
[1:04:37] a lot about it, but I can tell you this.
[1:04:39] You don't want to miss it.
[1:04:44] I don't care what your prospects of the
[1:04:47] future are. I don't care how gifted you
[1:04:49] are. I don't care what kind of IQ you
[1:04:53] have. You don't want to miss this.
[1:04:59] I don't care how successful in business
[1:05:01] you are.
[1:05:03] You don't want to miss this.
[1:05:10] when the bride must be taken away.
[1:05:14] What he said that the hour has come that
[1:05:16] time shall be no more and the angel is
[1:05:20] ready to set his foot on the land and on
[1:05:23] the other and the other on the sea. He's
[1:05:27] in the first sail. He's going to move on
[1:05:29] to the next one now.
[1:05:32] and the rainbow over his head, the the
[1:05:35] covenant declaring clearly, I'm the
[1:05:38] covenant angel
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; and with his and the rainbow over him
[1:05:44] with with feet and say, "Time has run
[1:05:48] out." And besides that, he raised his
[1:05:51] hand and swore that time should be no
[1:05:54] more when this happened. How perfect it
[1:05:58] is.
[1:06:00] And here's the words. A sworn affidavit
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; to the church. It's an affidavit is like
[1:06:08] an oath that's made on top of an oath.
[1:06:11] It's a double shity. An affidavit is
[1:06:14] only good when you have a someone who
[1:06:17] can document it, who's authorized to
[1:06:20] document. If you if you make a certain
[1:06:22] document, say with your immigration or
[1:06:25] you make a certain document and you must
[1:06:28] declare these things are true and
[1:06:30] correct, they won't just accept your
[1:06:32] signature. They want an affidavit. So
[1:06:34] you go to someone who is authorized and
[1:06:37] accepted by the government. They stamp
[1:06:39] it affidavit. And I declare that this is
[1:06:43] true. Then they take the responsibility
[1:06:45] and the government accepts it. Now
[1:06:49] we have a man and there's all kinds of
[1:06:52] preachers,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; all kinds of religious ideas. What does
[1:06:56] this mean in Revelation? What does this
[1:06:58] mean over here? And we have all kinds of
[1:07:01] preachers perhaps that have preached on
[1:07:03] Malachi 4. Behold, I send you Elijah the
[1:07:06] prophet. But then you have one come and
[1:07:09] refer to that. And then and then you
[1:07:12] have this God who creates light. And you
[1:07:15] have a man stand here and say, "Don't
[1:07:17] you see that light over this person?"
[1:07:20] And begins to tell that person what it
[1:07:24] is that is the big question and the
[1:07:26] dilemma in their life and answers that
[1:07:31] question. That kind of God I can serve.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; That kind of God is worthy of your life.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; That kind of God is worthy of your
[1:07:42] worship.
[1:07:43] That kind of God is worthy for you to
[1:07:46] come to church on Sunday
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; and give your time and give your full
[1:07:51] attention.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; That kind of God I can listen to.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Not once, thousands of times.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Friends, God, that God has made this
[1:08:06] world and this generation inexcusable.
[1:08:17] There won't weigh anyone that has an
[1:08:18] excuse.
[1:08:21] And then when it talks about the
[1:08:23] countenance, I just want to say
[1:08:25] something about the countenance. Father,
[1:08:28] the hour has come that you shall
[1:08:29] glorify.
[1:08:32] The hour has come
[1:08:37] that the son of man should be glorified.
[1:08:40] And now you have a messenger
[1:08:43] of the son of man
[1:08:46] sent to declare him to make him known to
[1:08:49] a people.
[1:08:52] Get me now? To make make him known to
[1:08:56] reveal him to a group of people
[1:09:01] and say, "Oh, but I love him."
[1:09:05] because you have a messenger that's sent
[1:09:08] to attract people out of all of the
[1:09:12] religious systems
[1:09:15] to make a wife
[1:09:17] a bride for this son of man.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And you know Jesus said the hour has
[1:09:25] come that you'll glorify him.
[1:09:29] And the Bible says speaking
[1:09:32] the apostle Paul says the woman is the
[1:09:36] glory of the man and that is why she
[1:09:42] doesn't have her she has her hair head
[1:09:44] covered
[1:09:46] and that covering is her hair
[1:09:49] but the woman is the glory of the man.
[1:09:55] I had two police officers I was speaking
[1:09:58] to
[1:09:59] last week,
[1:10:01] mounted police,
[1:10:04] and I was talking to them
[1:10:07] and they just of themselves they began
[1:10:09] to speak about women
[1:10:13] and I they're just speaking about their
[1:10:15] business, their their work as police
[1:10:19] and they said the women are these are
[1:10:21] the words they said the women today are
[1:10:22] so brash
[1:10:25] So forward
[1:10:27] and they said especially 15y old to 17
[1:10:32] that's their biggest problem.
[1:10:35] Women what what what what made them that
[1:10:38] way?
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't make them that way.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible gave them a tender spirit.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; The the Bible gave them the honor of
[1:10:51] motherhood.
[1:10:53] The Bible gave them the capacity
[1:10:57] to be compassionate.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; What made them so that even police
[1:11:01] officers say they're so brash so just
[1:11:04] you know what made them that way?
[1:11:12] I'll tell you what made them that way.
[1:11:14] I'm not wise, but darkness made them
[1:11:18] that way. Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Not light.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Not this kind of light I'm speaking
[1:11:23] about. Not this one who said, "I'm the
[1:11:26] light.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; If you follow me,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; you'll not walk in darkness anymore.
[1:11:42] The hour has come that the son of man
[1:11:44] should be glorified."
[1:11:46] And then the next verse, the next line
[1:11:48] is this. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:11:53] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:11:55] ground, it dies and abides alone.
[1:12:00] But if it die, it brings forth much
[1:12:02] fruit. If it die, it bringeth forth much
[1:12:06] fruit. He's talking about father
[1:12:11] the hour has come that the sun shall be
[1:12:14] glorified
[1:12:16] but if a seed
[1:12:19] if it doesn't except a corn of wheat
[1:12:22] fall into the ground he's talking about
[1:12:25] himself being glorified
[1:12:27] and now he goes through the death now
[1:12:31] please hang on to this I'm just getting
[1:12:33] into the meat of the subject now he's
[1:12:36] now what is talking about he's going to
[1:12:39] go to the death and he's going to be
[1:12:41] resurrected
[1:12:43] into another body beyond death and this
[1:12:47] is being glorified and the people who
[1:12:50] know him he has just had 5,000 or
[1:12:54] thousands of people and he said except
[1:12:56] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:12:58] have no life in you brother Brandham
[1:13:01] says he wants us to be vampires
[1:13:04] he said what do you think of a doctor or
[1:13:07] a nurse, a medical person would think of
[1:13:10] that phrase. He didn't explain it. He
[1:13:13] just said it.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he said it to thin
[1:13:17] down his crowd.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; He said it with a purpose.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; And there may be things today, and I
[1:13:24] trust not that would thin down the
[1:13:26] crowd.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want to thin down the crowd. I
[1:13:30] pray that the light of the gospel will
[1:13:34] shine into your heart. in the face of
[1:13:36] Jesus Christ and you'll see that there's
[1:13:40] something more
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; to the gospel of Jesus Christ than what
[1:13:44] the churches and I include this church.
[1:13:47] God help us that we never sink down and
[1:13:51] just become a a society and a club and a
[1:13:54] charity society. We're not that. This is
[1:13:58] the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; This is the lifechanging light.
[1:14:04] This is the light that exposes the
[1:14:06] darkness.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; It's lifech changing.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And into the face of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:22] For the scripture says, you may wonder
[1:14:25] about this scripture when I said the
[1:14:27] woman is the glory of the man. It's 1
[1:14:29] Corinthians 11:7. For a man indeed ought
[1:14:33] not to cover his head. For as much as he
[1:14:35] is in he is the image of and glory of
[1:14:38] God, but the woman is the glory of the
[1:14:41] man.
[1:14:44] Now I'm I'm I'm just making a little
[1:14:48] shift here
[1:14:53] on the message turn on the light. And I
[1:14:57] didn't choose that uh message for that
[1:15:00] reason.
[1:15:04] Could we just dim the lights please a
[1:15:05] wee bit?
[1:15:10] Okay. Thank you.
[1:15:12] There come another time
[1:15:16] that the church should get away from its
[1:15:18] sins and that is unbelief.
[1:15:21] Brother Brandham doesn't speak of sins.
[1:15:23] He says sins are not you know your
[1:15:27] adultery and drinking and carousing and
[1:15:30] so on. Sins is unbelief and the rest are
[1:15:34] attributes of sin
[1:15:37] and be sanctified. And along came John
[1:15:40] Wesley a little Anglican man
[1:15:43] but he saw the light on the gospel.
[1:15:47] Something happened to him. He saw the
[1:15:49] light on the gospel
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; and it was the Philadelphiaian age to
[1:15:53] come forth. He preached sanctification
[1:15:57] by the blood of Jesus Christ and nothing
[1:16:00] could stand in its light. He was
[1:16:02] considered a fanatic but he protested
[1:16:05] all the rest of them and shined forth
[1:16:08] the light because it was the light of
[1:16:12] the hour.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; God found a man, John Wesley, who could
[1:16:16] turn on the light.
[1:16:18] Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Then came the Pentecostal brethren.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; They come back in their age to the
[1:16:31] restoration of the gifts of speaking in
[1:16:34] tongues, the gifts of healing and things
[1:16:38] to the church. I want to stop there and
[1:16:41] I want your keen attention for a moment.
[1:16:44] I lived through this era
[1:16:48] and I'm probably one of very few in this
[1:16:52] body of people and for you that are on
[1:16:55] the internet I want you to listen very
[1:16:57] close. I lived in this area era in this
[1:17:01] time when there's a huge outpouring
[1:17:04] and the prophet's ministry came
[1:17:08] uh rose in that time and you can find
[1:17:11] books on it if you want in the libraries
[1:17:14] and it becomes a piece of history and
[1:17:17] and uh professor David Edwin Harold of
[1:17:21] of uh the university in Alabama
[1:17:27] I believe it is I spoke with him and he
[1:17:31] said that uh of the the two great giants
[1:17:35] of this movement and the reason he was
[1:17:37] studying it because he was a professor
[1:17:39] of history. He was studying it because
[1:17:41] he realized that there was this whole
[1:17:43] religious movement that happened. He
[1:17:46] said about 1958
[1:17:48] 1948 to 1958 it had changed in his words
[1:17:53] were changed the face of America. And
[1:17:56] now here's this uh nation that's rising
[1:17:59] in its uh mil military power to become
[1:18:04] the supreme military power of the earth.
[1:18:08] It hadn't yet. It had just come out of
[1:18:10] the second world war. But it was rising
[1:18:13] in its power of economic world power and
[1:18:18] military world power, but also would
[1:18:21] have a voice from a prophet that would
[1:18:23] say the nation would become or was the
[1:18:26] prostitute of nations because it also
[1:18:29] had a Hollywood and it also had a
[1:18:31] corruption and immortality immorality
[1:18:34] within it that would rot it from the
[1:18:36] seed from the core.
[1:18:43] But the gifts, Brother Brandham wasn't
[1:18:46] the only the gifted one. There was all
[1:18:48] kinds of gifts, gifts of healing. There
[1:18:51] was a Jack Cole and a HW
[1:18:56] uh Richard H. Hall and and Tommy Osbbor
[1:19:01] and Tommy Hicks. I've been in both of
[1:19:04] their meetings. And or Roberts, who's
[1:19:06] been here to Vancouver and all over the
[1:19:09] world. and has a huge faith city in
[1:19:11] Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there was all of
[1:19:14] these great ministries, O Jaggers and WV
[1:19:18] Grant and on and on at Infinitum, all
[1:19:22] kinds of them. And when uh when William
[1:19:25] Brandham was one, but
[1:19:29] David Ed, Professor Herald says that the
[1:19:32] two giants were William Brandham and
[1:19:34] Oral Roberts. But they said William
[1:19:36] Brandham a a meek and
[1:19:40] a man of a small stature and very
[1:19:44] humble. They said, "But he became a
[1:19:46] prophet to a generation."
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. True.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; So that's not what we said. That's what
[1:19:54] he said.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; As far as I know, he's not a believer of
[1:19:56] the message as such, but he's a good
[1:19:59] man. And I spent a day with him here. He
[1:20:01] flew up here
[1:20:03] because he was interested in some things
[1:20:05] that I had said about him.
[1:20:09] And uh
[1:20:13] but the mistake, the great error. Now
[1:20:17] friends, I will not be speaking this
[1:20:18] again. I don't expect the great error.
[1:20:21] This is to help you. The great error
[1:20:24] that was made and the reason why people
[1:20:26] have such a wrong impression of things
[1:20:29] is they thought that what William Brham
[1:20:32] was doing was a gift.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; One of the gifts
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and they missed it.
[1:20:42] And I can tell you I was on a razor's
[1:20:45] edge
[1:20:47] from missing it myself.
[1:20:50] Why? Because gifts were everywhere.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; I saw small people. I saw people you
[1:20:57] don't know and I don't know. I saw a man
[1:21:01] from California up here just on the
[1:21:04] across the Canadian border praying for
[1:21:06] people, Russian people. And they're
[1:21:09] praying for them. And the three young
[1:21:12] young people came up, teenagers, deaf
[1:21:16] and dumb, couldn't speak and couldn't
[1:21:18] hear. And he prayed for them. He's just
[1:21:21] a preacher. He prayed for them in the
[1:21:24] name of Jesus Christ. And they both
[1:21:26] spoke and could hear all three of them.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Did I forget that? Could never forget
[1:21:32] that.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But did I get that confused with this
[1:21:36] ministry? No. And and tapes. Who made
[1:21:39] tapes? Katherryn Kman made tapes. Or
[1:21:42] Roberts made tapes. Billy Graham made
[1:21:44] tapes. All kinds of people made tapes.
[1:21:47] Having tapes isn't isn't unusual.
[1:21:54] Michael, if you want to come or can
[1:21:56] come,
[1:21:58] it'll be fine.
[1:22:08] Most of you don't know what this is.
[1:22:12] For you that are over on this side,
[1:22:17] this is a tape recorder.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Say that's a monster. No, this is a
[1:22:22] small one.
[1:22:29] This is the tape.
[1:22:34] Brother Benham's voice is on that tape.
[1:22:39] This is called the real to real.
[1:22:43] And my wife has was talking to some of
[1:22:45] you young ladies that are probably here
[1:22:47] and you may remember it.
[1:22:50] And she said re realtore tape. She said
[1:22:52] you know something about the real to
[1:22:54] real. They said what what's real to
[1:22:57] real?
[1:22:59] That is from this
[1:23:04] over here.
[1:23:06] You want to put this here,
[1:23:09] Michael?
[1:23:12] We'll just put this one on here. We
[1:23:13] don't have to thread it on.
[1:23:21] This is real to real.
[1:23:30] that is I could tell you things but
[1:23:33] maybe I shouldn't take the time but
[1:23:37] uh it it's interesting that this tape
[1:23:43] is the is the I may be considered kind
[1:23:47] of kind of offthe-wall but anyway at at
[1:23:49] the expense of being off the wall this
[1:23:52] tape is is a byproduct of oil.
[1:23:56] Oil in the Bible always speaks of the
[1:23:58] Holy Spirit. I'm not making that
[1:24:01] connection, but it's strange that God
[1:24:03] would allow a byproduct of oil to make a
[1:24:07] tape way back before the foundation of
[1:24:09] the world. He said, "I'll probably let
[1:24:11] man and civilization develop a tape
[1:24:15] because I want to record my voice on
[1:24:17] it."
[1:24:20] And you want to go into the science of
[1:24:22] this tape. If you go into the science of
[1:24:26] it, and this is many, many years ago,
[1:24:29] but when the tape is made, it it lays
[1:24:33] like a whole lot of little rods.
[1:24:37] On the tape, it just like a whole lot of
[1:24:42] rods, you know, little short pieces of
[1:24:45] rods going like that.
[1:24:48] That's that's the composition of the
[1:24:50] tape. And when the tape goes by the
[1:24:54] playing head because it has a recording
[1:24:58] head.
[1:25:00] And I I want to I want to say that
[1:25:04] you go to the last book of your Bible
[1:25:07] that's called Revelation. Revelation of
[1:25:10] Jesus Christ.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; But it's strange.
[1:25:15] It's It's hard to understand.
[1:25:18] And it goes past the recording head.
[1:25:20] John was the recorder.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And when it goes by the And when this
[1:25:26] tape goes by the recording head, you're
[1:25:29] going to think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
[1:25:32] When it goes by the recording head, all
[1:25:35] those particles
[1:25:36] that come from a byproduct of oil, all
[1:25:39] those particles, they scramble into all
[1:25:42] kinds of forms that science calls
[1:25:46] symbols.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; You go into the seals book and you'll
[1:25:50] find the prophet says, "Well, they heard
[1:25:52] a thunder." Well, he said it was just in
[1:25:54] a symbol form, right?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Revelation said he heard a thunder,
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; but it was just a symbol.
[1:26:02] He said God symbolized it to the church
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; for just a season
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; and then when it goes past the play head
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; when you put it into play mode and now
[1:26:14] it's going to play it. It unscramles the
[1:26:17] symbols. And so God
[1:26:22] in Luke 17:30, Jesus
[1:26:27] was standing there on earth.
[1:26:30] And this John who wrote Revelation or
[1:26:34] recorded Revelation was standing there.
[1:26:38] And Jesus is saying when you see the
[1:26:41] time come of Sodom in the world and when
[1:26:46] you see the time come of Noah where they
[1:26:49] plant and they build and they buy and
[1:26:51] they sell and you see all the immorality
[1:26:54] and perversion. Do you see it?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Even thus
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; shall it be when the son of man that was
[1:27:04] him was on earth. He says when the son
[1:27:07] of man is revealed, there will be a time
[1:27:11] when you see the uh the the the
[1:27:15] characteristics of Sodom and when you
[1:27:18] see the time of Noah once again
[1:27:21] worldwide. That'll be the day when the
[1:27:24] son of man is revealed. And then they
[1:27:26] have the spirit of Elijah once again on
[1:27:29] the earth, not to record the events, but
[1:27:32] to to to untangle the symbols.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; And when you take this tape and you play
[1:27:41] it past the play head, it unscramles the
[1:27:45] symbols so that all the particles lay
[1:27:48] back into line once again.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Well, that's just
[1:27:53] for a little that's a bonus.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; You know why I said that? Because I know
[1:28:02] you wouldn't hear it anywhere else.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; You kids are in school, you're in high
[1:28:07] school, you're in graduation, you're in
[1:28:08] college. You'll never hear that in
[1:28:10] college.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; And you'll never hear it in in a Bible
[1:28:15] school. And you may never hear it in
[1:28:17] your classroom. Even though we have
[1:28:20] wonderful people such as brother Kim
[1:28:22] Dingwall and brother Norm Woods and Mr.
[1:28:25] T. Catch and
[1:28:28] thank God for the school,
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; but also thank God for the church.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And he takes things in time. And now
[1:28:41] here's here,
[1:28:44] like I said, that was just a bonus
[1:28:46] because this is just the beginning.
[1:28:49] Are we all right for time?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom is going to Seattle and so I
[1:28:54] don't want to
[1:28:56] uh I don't want to overstep my time.
[1:29:03] But wasn't that simple?
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:11] And God chose
[1:29:13] to commence to reveal
[1:29:16] the son of man.
[1:29:19] And it bypassed us.
[1:29:23] And they were recording these when I was
[1:29:25] your age.
[1:29:30] They were recording these. I didn't know
[1:29:32] they were recording them.
[1:29:34] I didn't know that God
[1:29:36] said, "I'll send another prophet and I
[1:29:39] will
[1:29:40] stand by him and I will confirm it's me
[1:29:43] speaking."
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Because I must have
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I must fulfill the scripture in the
[1:29:50] days.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Listen to me folks,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; don't be distracted. In the days of the
[1:29:56] voice of the seventh angel,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; when he begin to sound, the mysteries of
[1:30:01] God should be finished as he declared it
[1:30:04] to his prophets.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And now in the last 60 years,
[1:30:11] churches like this have been made.
[1:30:15] Churches like this have been
[1:30:17] constructed.
[1:30:19] And the gospel has moved on another 60
[1:30:22] years. And I can tell you that the
[1:30:24] church world has become very
[1:30:27] entertainment prone,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; very given over and become occupied with
[1:30:34] all kinds of education and all kinds of
[1:30:37] the the world has advanced so far that
[1:30:40] we've gone from this
[1:30:42] and there's you know how many there is.
[1:30:45] Who can tell me how many messages there
[1:30:47] are?
[1:30:50] Raise your hand.
[1:30:53] Hello.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Sister Reena Wit.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; How many is she signing?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; 1183.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; 1183.
[1:31:04] Brother Tim Dodd confirms 1,183
[1:31:10] real to reals that you don't know
[1:31:13] anything about.
[1:31:15] But what you do know something about is
[1:31:19] this is a chip.
[1:31:23] Anybody know what a chip is? Put your
[1:31:26] hand up. Oh, have we ever got a lot of
[1:31:29] intelligent people here? You know what a
[1:31:31] chip is? How many on this side? How many
[1:31:33] in the balcony knows what a chip is? Let
[1:31:35] me see your hands. Be honest.
[1:31:38] Good for you.
[1:31:41] Everything that's on 1,183
[1:31:46] of these is on this.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; But now I'm coming in with the
[1:31:57] I'm coming in with the heavy. I'm coming
[1:31:59] in with the artillery. Now,
[1:32:03] this did not give any of you any
[1:32:05] revelation.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; This did not make you any wiser in the
[1:32:12] gospel.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Satan, this is Satan's Eden. and all
[1:32:19] this development and all this wisdom and
[1:32:22] all of this sophisticated
[1:32:25] uh engineering of technology did not
[1:32:28] Satan didn't do that to reveal Jesus
[1:32:31] Christ to you.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in revealing Jesus
[1:32:38] Christ to you.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; He's interested in bringing you into
[1:32:43] darkness,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; into confusion.
[1:32:47] He's not interested in bringing Jesus
[1:32:49] Christ. But God said, I'll record it
[1:32:53] there.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You didn't have the privilege of walking
[1:32:58] with Jesus Christ
[1:33:00] when he was here.
[1:33:05] He was lowly.
[1:33:07] He was the son of man. He said, "The son
[1:33:10] of man hath nowhere to lay his head.
[1:33:16] He had a garment that was a nice
[1:33:18] garment. And the soldiers, they gave
[1:33:23] lots out to get his garment.
[1:33:28] And Jesus spoke some very difficult
[1:33:31] things
[1:33:33] except we hate our life
[1:33:37] and disregard it sort of thing.
[1:33:41] If you don't follow me, you have no
[1:33:43] life.
[1:33:45] You have no life, friends.
[1:33:50] And we might have been there in the
[1:33:51] crowd
[1:33:53] as we're here today.
[1:33:56] I hope you don't walk out just now.
[1:33:59] But Jesus said, "Except you eat the
[1:34:04] flesh of the Son of Man
[1:34:07] and drink his blood, you have no life in
[1:34:09] you.
[1:34:11] And no one understood that.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And because no one understood it, the
[1:34:17] Bible says, and the prophet of God
[1:34:20] emphasizes, they all left.
[1:34:25] And there were 70 who were ordained to
[1:34:27] the ministry,
[1:34:29] called by him to the ministry, sent out
[1:34:32] by this son of man to the ministry,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; and they left. That's right.
[1:34:42] Don't be surprised when people leave.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Don't be shocked when people have
[1:34:50] questions.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; They all had questions.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Don't be surprised when you say, "Well,
[1:34:59] that's a different kind of a church.
[1:35:00] He's a different kind." He wasn't just a
[1:35:02] different kind of a preacher. He was
[1:35:04] God's son.
[1:35:07] Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; On earth.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; And he owes we owe him everything.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And the fact that the world could come
[1:35:18] to oh such a sophisticated and such a
[1:35:22] cultury cultural wonderful and so high
[1:35:26] in all of our ly dawn our music and our
[1:35:30] singing and our our sound system and uh
[1:35:34] all of those things. That's fine. Use
[1:35:36] it. Use it. Use it. But we have one
[1:35:39] purpose.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And I had a man say something to me, my
[1:35:46] former partner. He was a Catholic man.
[1:35:49] He was in the fellowship room. He came
[1:35:52] here to brother Mike Hunt's funeral.
[1:35:56] He had had an had an aneurysm
[1:36:00] and from his office to the Vancouver
[1:36:02] hospital was 10 minutes. And when they
[1:36:05] rushed him to the hospital, I just
[1:36:07] learned yesterday from brother Ken
[1:36:09] Ordeal that he had a private secretary
[1:36:13] and the secretary in the next office
[1:36:15] heard a thump and and and Bob's door was
[1:36:19] open. So she walked into his office.
[1:36:22] Normally she wouldn't walk into his
[1:36:24] office. And she walked into his office
[1:36:26] and he was on the floor I guess. And
[1:36:28] they called 911, got him to hospital
[1:36:30] within about 10 minutes, the hospital
[1:36:33] said. and he told me that if I hadn't
[1:36:36] been near the hospital, I wouldn't have
[1:36:38] made it. I wouldn't have survived.
[1:36:41] And then he said this, "Here's a man
[1:36:44] who's a millionaire. Here's a man who's
[1:36:46] been very, very successful. Here's a man
[1:36:48] who works very hard, very diligently.
[1:36:50] Young man, just works very hard. He
[1:36:54] doesn't know anything about the clock.
[1:36:55] He throws the clock away. He's made all
[1:36:58] kinds of money."
[1:37:00] But he told me this right here in the
[1:37:03] fellowship room. He said, 'I have one
[1:37:05] purpose in life, and that's to enter the
[1:37:08] kingdom of God. A Catholic man, Brother
[1:37:11] Daniel,
[1:37:13] I have one purpose in life,
[1:37:16] that's to enter the kingdom of God.
[1:37:25] I'm a little broken
[1:37:27] because I have to admit I haven't had a
[1:37:29] believer say that to me.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; I have one purpose
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; in life
[1:37:38] to enter the kingdom of God.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; And this Lord Jesus, this son of man,
[1:37:45] this one that I'm telling you has been
[1:37:47] revealed. I don't have to convince you.
[1:37:50] He did it himself. He has been revealed.
[1:37:53] Everything that's on all of these tapes
[1:37:55] is on this chip, but that's not what
[1:37:57] will reveal it to you. You have more
[1:38:00] access to it. It's more available to
[1:38:02] you, but that won't reveal it to you.
[1:38:05] And then God gives you ministry. God
[1:38:07] gives you men who've given their lives.
[1:38:09] Do you think they can't do anything but
[1:38:11] preach? They absolutely can. They have
[1:38:14] all kinds of offers, all kinds of things
[1:38:17] and all kinds of people that want them
[1:38:19] maybe to preach and and and those things
[1:38:23] are are are very attractive perhaps, but
[1:38:27] they give themselves to the gospel of
[1:38:30] Jesus Christ to the needs of the people
[1:38:33] so they can encourage it on. Listen,
[1:38:36] young people, when you come for
[1:38:38] counseling, you you should pray as
[1:38:40] brother brother Joe Waldner, not brother
[1:38:43] Joe, brother Mike Walder told me,
[1:38:45] "Brother Ed, I I seldom call you, but
[1:38:48] when I do, I pray before I come and I
[1:38:51] say, God, whatever comes out of that
[1:38:53] man's mouth, I will take that as you
[1:38:56] speaking to me." Let me tell you
[1:38:58] friends, I've been here a long time.
[1:39:00] There's a lot of folks even sitting here
[1:39:02] this congregation could have saved
[1:39:04] themselves a lot of trouble if they
[1:39:07] would have come first to the office of
[1:39:09] the pastor the office of the man of God
[1:39:12] the office to the ministers and to the
[1:39:15] word of God and taken what God said they
[1:39:18] have they got disc yeah they got disc
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; have they got have have they got the
[1:39:23] reals I probably haven't got the real to
[1:39:26] reals and then every everything that's
[1:39:28] on 1183 tapes is in this in this box and
[1:39:32] now it's here in this and a person can
[1:39:34] hear it on their iPad iPod and iPad and
[1:39:38] whatever more.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; But if they took and realized that God
[1:39:44] sent a servant here on earth to catch to
[1:39:49] catch the symbol and to catch the secret
[1:39:52] and to catch the men mystery of Jesus
[1:39:56] Christ and reveal him to the people.
[1:40:00] What simplicity? If they would regard
[1:40:02] that, they'd save themselves a lot of
[1:40:05] trouble.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[1:40:14] Exactly.
[1:40:29] I want to conclude in just a few
[1:40:31] minutes.
[1:40:39] Brother Brandham had just said.
[1:40:43] Then along came the Pentecostal brother.
[1:40:47] They came back in their age of the
[1:40:49] restoration of the gifts.
[1:40:52] Restore back the gifts. This is speaking
[1:40:54] in tongues and the gifts of healing and
[1:40:56] the things to the church.
[1:41:01] But did he said, but did you realize
[1:41:04] we've moved on from that?
[1:41:08] He said, "We didn't we don't disregard
[1:41:11] that anymore than you do your youth. You
[1:41:13] you that are older, you've all been
[1:41:15] youth. We've all been children."
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; I look on my boyhood days and and it's
[1:41:22] it's very different from many of you,
[1:41:24] but we we we we don't disregard that we
[1:41:28] were children. We enjoy that.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; But now we become men and women.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Now we become married couples.
[1:41:37] Now we become fathers and mothers with
[1:41:40] responsibility and the weight and the
[1:41:42] duty.
[1:41:49] Now you realize that we've moved on from
[1:41:51] that and we are in a bride time.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Would you accept that?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; We're in a bride time. The selecting
[1:42:00] time,
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; friends. Yes, sir.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Is this where we're at?
[1:42:06] Is this what's happening?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; It's selecting time.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Do do you believe what I'm saying?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You folks back there, do you believe
[1:42:17] that? This is a selecting time, not my
[1:42:20] selection. God's selection.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; God's making the selection.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; God has sent a voice.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; And you have a big part of it yourself.
[1:42:29] You say, "I believe that. I don't
[1:42:31] understand it, but I believe it.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends from
[1:42:36] experience, that's exactly the place I
[1:42:38] came to.
[1:42:40] And I heard that prophet speaking. He
[1:42:42] just spoke about Malachi. He said when
[1:42:45] Malachi there's before the great and
[1:42:47] terrible day of the Lord
[1:42:49] and the his first coming was great. It's
[1:42:52] recorded in the Bible. And his second
[1:42:55] coming is dreadful because it's
[1:42:57] judgment.
[1:42:58] And
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; my question today is where are we?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Where are we? Is God bringing this world
[1:43:07] into judgment?
[1:43:10] Are we in almost movement into a
[1:43:13] tribulation period?
[1:43:18] I don't know. I wouldn't want to see
[1:43:19] much more violence than we see.
[1:43:22] people just blown to pieces and suicide
[1:43:26] bombers and all kinds of things. Oh
[1:43:28] well, we we can become accustomed to it.
[1:43:30] We become accustomed to it because we
[1:43:32] hear it every day. That doesn't mean
[1:43:34] that's the way it's supposed to be.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; But now I come down to something. If you
[1:43:47] think you've really been thinking, I
[1:43:49] want you to really think about this.
[1:43:52] Even thus shall it be when the Son of
[1:43:54] Man is revealed.
[1:43:57] I I about missed it
[1:44:00] when it was 1183 tapes
[1:44:08] and everybody around me was saying, "Oh,
[1:44:10] it's just a gift. It's God's gift." And
[1:44:13] isn't that wonderful? Yeah, it's
[1:44:14] wonderful. Praise the Lord. This is
[1:44:16] great.
[1:44:19] And then I begin to I had questions.
[1:44:22] Huge questions.
[1:44:26] Now I know you boys believe me
[1:44:30] and girls.
[1:44:33] But when you have a question
[1:44:36] and they go on year after year,
[1:44:40] is God one? I got this friend here. He
[1:44:43] says God's one. It's Jesus only. And
[1:44:45] it's only one. I got this one over here.
[1:44:47] And it's God's three is a father, son,
[1:44:49] and holy ghost.
[1:44:55] And we're not going to tribulation. Yes,
[1:44:58] we're going through a tribulation. And
[1:45:00] and I finally determined there's no
[1:45:02] absolute
[1:45:04] to the big questions of life. And then I
[1:45:06] saw these people, you know, get up and
[1:45:09] uh anointed of God and prophesy and
[1:45:13] speak in tongues and all kinds of gifts
[1:45:15] and praying for the sick and I've been
[1:45:18] prayed for myself and yet healed and
[1:45:21] only, oh, you got healed. So that shows
[1:45:24] we're right.
[1:45:27] Then I had a simple a man just in his
[1:45:33] jeans,
[1:45:34] a man by the name of William Brandham
[1:45:36] who I was scared of
[1:45:39] because I'd heard so many things.
[1:45:42] And he goes like this.
[1:45:46] This is a gift of William Brham,
[1:45:50] but this is not William Brham.
[1:45:53] And they have gifts.
[1:45:56] Gifts that have been given them of God,
[1:45:59] but it's not God.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; But when you hear the word of God, the
[1:46:04] word of God, are you listening? The word
[1:46:06] of God is God.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was the word.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why the word had to be
[1:46:15] recorded because it had to fulfill the
[1:46:18] scripture in the days of the voice of
[1:46:20] the seventh angel. And friends, God did
[1:46:23] a an extraordinary thing. He gave us
[1:46:26] more than he really needed to do,
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; but it so that we'd have no excuse.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; He left it here to be registered and
[1:46:35] recorded and translated into other
[1:46:37] languages. You people that speak
[1:46:39] Chinese, thank God. And you people that
[1:46:42] speak in the African language, thank
[1:46:44] God. And we're going to Russia next
[1:46:47] Sunday. I'll be in Moscow. Brother Tim
[1:46:49] Dodd will be in Moscow. This is the
[1:46:52] first time my wife heard this for the
[1:46:54] first time at breakfast and you people
[1:46:56] are hearing it for the first time. This
[1:46:58] is the first time that the faith
[1:47:00] challenge report has been re has been
[1:47:02] translated into Russian language. So the
[1:47:05] people in Moscow and Russia will be able
[1:47:08] to have it. I say thank God.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; I have a lot to say friends and I'll try
[1:47:14] to say it as fast as possible. But
[1:47:18] you see this here when the son of man is
[1:47:22] revealed
[1:47:24] and now
[1:47:28] brother Brandham comes
[1:47:34] follow me very close now. This is my
[1:47:37] hardest time. Brother Brandham preached
[1:47:40] a message.
[1:47:43] And don't don't think that this is just
[1:47:45] a sermon.
[1:47:48] This is a message,
[1:47:50] the unveiling
[1:47:52] of God.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "My subject this morning is
[1:47:58] to reveal and unveil that God." Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Now friends,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; I might not pay much attention to it if
[1:48:07] I as a preacher said that. But when I
[1:48:10] when I hear a man that the pillar of
[1:48:13] fire, the angel of the Lord stood beside
[1:48:17] year after year, year after year, month
[1:48:20] after month, whatever city, whether it
[1:48:22] was Bombay or Durban, South Africa or
[1:48:26] Johannesburg or or or Helsinki, Finland,
[1:48:30] and the boy was raised from the dead.
[1:48:32] And and when people hear about those
[1:48:34] great things, you know, friends,
[1:48:38] are you able to stay with me?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; I have things that I haven't preached
[1:48:43] here. I have testimonies of this
[1:48:45] message. I was in Helsinki
[1:48:49] in Finland and there's a small group,
[1:48:52] maybe no more than would be here,
[1:48:55] and most of the people were white hair
[1:48:56] like myself, older people.
[1:49:00] and the young man who was who was what
[1:49:03] they didn't even have a pastor
[1:49:05] and this church supported a young man
[1:49:08] called Matty Honadan who's now the voice
[1:49:11] of God representative for Finland and
[1:49:15] for that region
[1:49:17] and I said you are obviously the one
[1:49:19] that is that the people look to you
[1:49:22] arrange the meetings you take the place
[1:49:25] of the pastor
[1:49:27] I said but he said I can't he's a male
[1:49:30] nurse in a hospital about 150 km away.
[1:49:33] This church, this body of people and
[1:49:35] some of them are still here. We paid his
[1:49:38] salary to become a pastor in Helsinki,
[1:49:42] Finland. And he told me, he said, "A
[1:49:45] woman in a group here, went to visit in
[1:49:50] a senior citizen's home." Are you
[1:49:52] following me? You've never heard this
[1:49:54] before. You young people, listen very
[1:49:56] close. A woman in the group in Helseni
[1:50:00] went to a sen senior citizen's home and
[1:50:03] she's visiting an old lady and another
[1:50:05] woman who was visiting came to her and
[1:50:09] said, "Excuse me, it seems that I know
[1:50:12] you from someplace."
[1:50:15] And this sister said, "Well, I can't
[1:50:18] recognize you." Yes, but she said, "It
[1:50:21] seems that I know you." So, they begin
[1:50:23] to exchange stories.
[1:50:25] And are are you a Christian? This lady
[1:50:28] said, "Yes, yes, I I go to a little
[1:50:30] group over here." She said,
[1:50:34] "And you?" She said, "I go to a
[1:50:36] Pentecostal church."
[1:50:39] Oh, well, she said, "That's nice." And
[1:50:41] they just exchanged a few greetings. And
[1:50:43] and this woman says to her, "And and
[1:50:46] what kind of church do you go to?" She
[1:50:48] said, 'Well, we fellowship around uh uh
[1:50:51] the message that God sent through
[1:50:54] brother Brandham, William Brham. Oh,
[1:50:56] this lady said, "Do you know about
[1:51:01] William Brham?"
[1:51:03] She said, "Well, yes." She said, "Do you
[1:51:05] remember hearing about the boy that was
[1:51:07] killed and was raised from the dead?"
[1:51:10] "Oh, yes." She said, "Of course I
[1:51:12] remember." She said, "It was my husband
[1:51:16] that drove the car that killed the boy."
[1:51:22] How do you like that? I got that woman
[1:51:25] on the telephone.
[1:51:28] She spoke only Finnish and Brother Matty
[1:51:32] Honen interpreted for me and I wanted to
[1:51:36] go to her place to get her testimony.
[1:51:39] She lived about 150 kilometers out of
[1:51:42] Helseni.
[1:51:43] She was nervous to be before a camera.
[1:51:48] But you know there were two boys on the
[1:51:50] bicycle
[1:51:51] and one was hurt and unconscious.
[1:51:55] And the mother of that boy, brother
[1:51:57] Brandham told me she was at the bottom
[1:51:59] of the stairs when he would come down
[1:52:01] the platform. She would get a hold of
[1:52:03] him. Sir, sir, you you must raise up my
[1:52:06] boy. You must raise up my boy. you. The
[1:52:09] other boy was raised from the dead. You
[1:52:10] must raise up my boy. He said, "I I
[1:52:13] didn't do that. The Lord Jesus did that.
[1:52:15] God did that." No, no, no, no. She said,
[1:52:17] "You did it." He She said, "No, no. God
[1:52:20] did it."
[1:52:22] Brother Brandham told me now you fellas
[1:52:25] are able to listen to someone.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; I've been there. I'm the only witness.
[1:52:33] And brother Brandham said to me, he
[1:52:35] said, "I was in my hotel room and I was
[1:52:38] looking out the window and I saw of a
[1:52:42] vase, a flower vase with two liies in it
[1:52:46] and one was bent over like that and one
[1:52:51] was standing up straight and nice." He
[1:52:54] said, "And while I looked at the two
[1:52:56] liies, the other one came up erect and
[1:53:00] stood with this one." He said, ' And I
[1:53:03] said, call the woman.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; And he called, they called the woman and
[1:53:08] he said, 'Your son shall live.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; That was more than just one of the gifts
[1:53:14] of healing.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; That was more than just seeing a vision.
[1:53:18] You understand this, fellas? That was
[1:53:20] more I'm telling you personally things I
[1:53:23] don't have to tell you, but I'm telling
[1:53:24] you, I'm taking the time. I'm taking the
[1:53:27] time of the of of the ministry of the
[1:53:29] word today to give you this kind of
[1:53:31] testimony. This testimony is true.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I lived it.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I heard it. Yes, sir.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; I talked with the woman whose husband
[1:53:43] drove the car that killed the boy. I had
[1:53:47] a man who visited that boy became a
[1:53:50] policeman in the highway highways
[1:53:55] department of Finland and a man sat in
[1:53:59] my house up here on 180th Street who
[1:54:03] lived in my daughter's house
[1:54:07] lived in the basement for a time. His
[1:54:10] name was Nino
[1:54:14] Nylo or something. I just forget. And he
[1:54:16] brought out of his pocket. We invited
[1:54:18] him to our place for dinner. And he
[1:54:20] brought his billfold out. And he reached
[1:54:23] his billfold and got a little picture.
[1:54:26] And he said, "Do you do you know this
[1:54:28] picture?"
[1:54:30] And I said, "Yes, it's the boy that was
[1:54:32] raised from the dead. It's a picture
[1:54:34] you've all seen with his heavy head of
[1:54:36] hair and bangs across here like this.
[1:54:38] And that was the boy that was raised
[1:54:39] from the dead." He said, "I I just
[1:54:41] visited him in Finland. He's a policeman
[1:54:45] on the highways department. And I said,
[1:54:47] "Does he remember anything?" "No, he
[1:54:49] remembers nothing. He only knows." Well,
[1:54:52] you don't remember anything when you're
[1:54:53] dead. And he he he became a policeman.
[1:54:56] And he said, "Just tell the people when
[1:54:58] you go, just tell them I'm happy and I
[1:55:01] thank the Lord." Now, you know how close
[1:55:04] it is. Not many people have a minister
[1:55:09] that has talked to the woman whose
[1:55:11] husband drove the car that struck the
[1:55:15] bicycle. That's how close it is,
[1:55:17] friends. And we have here in Cloverdale,
[1:55:19] by the way, no excuse.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; No excuse but to believe it.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; And now I come to a point you have to
[1:55:29] you have to uh burden be burdened with
[1:55:32] me. That is why
[1:55:35] I'm receiving so many calls. It's a
[1:55:38] burden. I'm not happy with it.
[1:55:43] I don't want to get on a plane and
[1:55:44] travel for 15 hours this next week. I'm
[1:55:48] 81 years old. I got an email this
[1:55:52] morning from a pastor down in Tennessee
[1:55:55] said, "We're so thankful you've been on
[1:55:57] my heart for weeks. I'm so thankful that
[1:56:00] God has kept you. We have to have a
[1:56:03] witness. And you are a witness. And God
[1:56:05] has given you strength and given you
[1:56:07] health. But friends, I'm calling on this
[1:56:09] church. Maybe you've never uttered my
[1:56:11] name in prayer. But before you go home
[1:56:14] and after you go home, you utter my name
[1:56:17] in prayer and say, "God bless brother
[1:56:20] and sister Biscuit with health.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; I need my wife. I need my health. I need
[1:56:26] my voice. And I'm giving it all to the
[1:56:28] gospel. And I've never been ashamed of
[1:56:31] this gospel of Jesus Christ. And I
[1:56:34] challenge you. Live your life to this
[1:56:36] gospel. Live your life for this message.
[1:56:40] And you'll never never you'll never
[1:56:43] regret what I say. I challenge you in
[1:56:45] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And this
[1:56:56] now I'm going to close in a few minutes.
[1:57:01] This man,
[1:57:03] brother, brother Brandham, he's a
[1:57:05] Kentucky and just a ordinary person.
[1:57:17] But he's the only one that I've ever
[1:57:19] heard in all of my life
[1:57:22] that said, now I want you to listen very
[1:57:24] close.
[1:57:25] He come the first time as son of man.
[1:57:31] And then
[1:57:33] when the Holy Spirit came after his
[1:57:36] resurrection and the Holy Spirit came
[1:57:38] down on the church that was the Holy
[1:57:41] Spirit. God is the spirit.
[1:57:45] And Jesus said, "I will not leave you
[1:57:47] comfortless. I will come to you." Said
[1:57:49] he became son of God.
[1:57:53] said all he did was change his mask. We
[1:57:56] call it Easter.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; That is why Jesus was walking with those
[1:58:01] two men on the way to Emmas. He wanted
[1:58:04] them to know the mask has been changed.
[1:58:07] You're not where you were last week.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; I've changed.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; But they needed to know that he had
[1:58:15] changed.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; They needed to know where they were.
[1:58:20] That's why I'm preaching this morning.
[1:58:23] Where are we?
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And then in the unveiling of God, he
[1:58:32] said, I want to unveil that God to you.
[1:58:35] In the unveiling of God, he says, then
[1:58:38] between
[1:58:42] the son of God
[1:58:46] and there he's revealed as son of man.
[1:58:49] became a little breach.
[1:58:52] I've never said this before public, but
[1:58:54] I will say it now just because it's one
[1:58:56] of my personal thoughts. I've often
[1:58:59] wondered why Brother Brandham just
[1:59:01] before he comes to the opening of the
[1:59:03] seals,
[1:59:06] what seven angels
[1:59:09] just before the seals, there's a message
[1:59:12] that's called the breach. Yeah.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; And the breach is the breach is a word
[1:59:18] that is like there's a gusting forth.
[1:59:22] There's a gushing forth. There's like an
[1:59:25] announcement.
[1:59:27] And in the breach, go to it when you go
[1:59:30] home. Go to the breach
[1:59:33] and you'll find in the breach.
[1:59:36] In the breach, the prophet will go to
[1:59:39] Boaz and Ruth.
[1:59:43] Boaz a kinsman redeemer,
[1:59:46] taking a gentile wife
[1:59:50] and bringing her into Israel by giving
[1:59:53] seed to her.
[1:59:55] And that seed is the beginning of the
[1:59:57] lineage of the kings.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; He's on his way to be the son of David.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; And that child was from Boaz and Ruth.
[2:00:09] That was uh not Jesse, but that was OED
[2:00:14] and then Jesse
[2:00:16] and then David.
[2:00:18] And Matthew 1:1 says, "This is the
[2:00:22] generation of Jesus Christ, the son of
[2:00:25] Abraham, the son of David."
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; That would be that's what made David's
[2:00:31] throne everlasting
[2:00:34] from everlasting to everlasting. Are you
[2:00:36] following me or have I lost you? Are you
[2:00:38] okay? You following me? He's the son of
[2:00:41] David. And this now we have a messenger.
[2:00:45] It says now he comes in a breach. He
[2:00:48] comes as a son of man between the son of
[2:00:51] God.
[2:00:54] And now I'm loading it off on you. And
[2:00:57] the son of David. And he said he comes
[2:01:00] son of David to the Jews
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; in the millennium. He will be the son of
[2:01:05] David. Right.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; This voice,
[2:01:19] most of you know nothing. I had to go
[2:01:21] into my closet and get these. You don't
[2:01:24] know anything about that.
[2:01:26] [Applause]
[2:01:28] It kind of just slipped us and passed us
[2:01:30] by.
[2:01:32] He said, "Well, I wasn't even living at
[2:01:34] that time.
[2:01:38] But you were living at this time.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; But this didn't give you the revelation
[2:01:43] either.
[2:01:45] You were living at this time.
[2:01:48] Where is it?
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Surely I didn't lose my chip.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; On the pulpit. Thank you.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I can lose the chip, but I can't lose
[2:02:03] what's in here.
[2:02:11] So you lived in this time, but this
[2:02:14] won't give you the revelation.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[2:02:21] after righteousness, they shall be
[2:02:24] filled. Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you as a congregation,
[2:02:28] doesn't matter what name is on here or
[2:02:30] who you have as ministers, but
[2:02:32] Cloverdale Bible way has nothing to
[2:02:34] boast about. Not whatsoever. We cannot
[2:02:38] impart to you a revelation. But you give
[2:02:42] yourself and believe on him whom God
[2:02:44] hath sent, and you shall receive the
[2:02:47] revelation, and that revelation shall
[2:02:50] anchor you, and you will be acquainted
[2:02:53] with the son of man, and you'll you'll
[2:02:55] run into things as I have that you
[2:02:58] cannot explain entirely.
[2:03:01] I ask you, you say, "Well, what things
[2:03:04] can't you explain entirely?"
[2:03:09] Where are we at?
[2:03:11] Exactly.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Where are we at? I'm so thankful for the
[2:03:17] grace of God that he reveals what's in
[2:03:20] that Bible
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; and he reveals what's in the message and
[2:03:25] it's the same God because what he
[2:03:27] reveals is in the Bible.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; The son of man that's in the Bible. The
[2:03:35] son of David, that's in the Bible. the
[2:03:38] son of God. That's in the Bible. But to
[2:03:40] tie them together and to ask the
[2:03:42] question, where are we?
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Do we just live our lives and die like a
[2:03:53] bunch of animals and go to a grave? Or
[2:03:57] do we really have a purpose in life?
[2:04:01] I'm very very thankful
[2:04:04] for you and the young men and the young
[2:04:06] ladies for this congregation. I'm
[2:04:09] thankful for you.
[2:04:11] Do you know why we getting called?
[2:04:13] Brother
[2:04:15] John Andes is leaving on Thursday for
[2:04:19] Poland. Brother Greg Novakowski is
[2:04:22] already over there.
[2:04:25] Want to be in the meetings? Let me tell
[2:04:27] you something, friends. We've reached
[2:04:29] out for 40 years. Over 40 years, we've
[2:04:32] reached out to India, to Poland, to
[2:04:35] Norway, to Finland, to Russia, to China,
[2:04:38] all over the world. We've reached out to
[2:04:40] them. You need a tape. Do you need a
[2:04:42] book? Well, yes, we'll do whatever we
[2:04:44] can. And that is why they reach back in
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; and we got a group of people. If we
[2:04:49] didn't have, I thought of you, Brother
[2:04:52] Norm, Wood, that just retired. a man
[2:04:55] that's just retired with a full pension
[2:04:58] and all these all these things. You
[2:05:00] think he wants to go off and maybe be in
[2:05:03] a boat and fish, but instead he gives
[2:05:05] himself to you young people who've been
[2:05:08] at the school in the high school to
[2:05:10] teach you things that we couldn't afford
[2:05:12] to give you a man that could teach that.
[2:05:15] We just couldn't afford it. We couldn't
[2:05:17] afford to have a person as brother Kim
[2:05:19] Dingwall to build that school. I've told
[2:05:22] him plainly in this church ought to tell
[2:05:24] him if God hadn't sent you here we
[2:05:26] wouldn't have that kind of school and
[2:05:28] here we have brother Tatch uh Mr. Tats
[2:05:32] to you a lot of you children that man
[2:05:34] took us such a discount in his income
[2:05:38] probably $100,000
[2:05:41] less than he could make in the in the
[2:05:44] secular world to be at the school and to
[2:05:46] teach our children. I say God we thank
[2:05:50] you. Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; God, how we thank you. And you people
[2:05:55] have given. You think that you just goes
[2:05:57] into a hole in the a hole and we just
[2:06:00] spend it someplace. No, it isn't. It is
[2:06:03] that it might go out and that we might
[2:06:05] send somebody and we might send a
[2:06:08] brother Murphy or send someone to China
[2:06:10] or pay for some Bibles. Whatever it is,
[2:06:14] I say to God be blessed and God bless
[2:06:17] this congregation and God bless this
[2:06:20] ministry because we we're doing
[2:06:23] something that only God could put it in
[2:06:25] our hearts to dol
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother Matthew Redell
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; and taking the witnessing and taking and
[2:06:38] organizing the the youth and not only
[2:06:42] youth but others
[2:06:43] and going to other cities and other
[2:06:45] camps and other places. I say even if
[2:06:48] one soul, this is what I've said, even
[2:06:50] if one soul comes, we're not looking for
[2:06:52] a great big sweep. Even if one soul
[2:06:55] comes, it's worth it.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; You're living a testimony. You speak a
[2:07:00] word to somebody. It doesn't have to be
[2:07:02] a whole sermon. You sisters live the
[2:07:05] message.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Live.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; My wife gets disturbed. Says, "I haven't
[2:07:11] brought a soul." One of her this last
[2:07:14] week says, "I haven't brought a soul to
[2:07:17] Christ recently." I said, "You lived a
[2:07:19] message today. You're living a message
[2:07:22] today. I had such an opportunity to
[2:07:24] speak to those policemen." I said, "And
[2:07:26] she told them about the church and told
[2:07:28] them about the school and told them to
[2:07:30] go down to the school." Troubled men.
[2:07:33] They're policemen, but they're troubled.
[2:07:35] You know why they're troubled? Father,
[2:07:37] because they're having to deal with
[2:07:39] darkness
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; and the effects of darkness
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; and Satan wrecking lives, wrecking
[2:07:45] families. I feel sorry for them. I'm so
[2:07:48] thankful we can declare a gospel that is
[2:07:51] a positive gospel. There's nothing like
[2:07:54] this message, friends. How many will say
[2:07:56] amen for me?
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; This is my whole message. I'm done.
[2:08:10] We've gone on from here.
[2:08:13] This church was built since these were
[2:08:15] made.
[2:08:17] This church was built while these were
[2:08:20] made.
[2:08:22] This church stood here while it went
[2:08:25] onto this
[2:08:27] and while the hub was made. If we didn't
[2:08:30] have people like brother Darren Hoffman,
[2:08:33] we wouldn't have the hub. That man gave
[2:08:36] himself to write a program.
[2:08:40] We wouldn't have anything going to China
[2:08:43] if it wasn't for our brother Murphy. Who
[2:08:46] sent these people here?
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Who put it in their heart
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; to give their time?
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Who put it in their heart?
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying things. I'm not saying
[2:09:03] things to pump anybody up. But I'm
[2:09:05] saying things I've thought of these
[2:09:08] three men that are right here.
[2:09:11] Said, "Well, yeah." Oh, well, Brother
[2:09:13] Tom, raise your son-in-law. Listen, I
[2:09:15] remember when he was in a cast to his
[2:09:18] hip
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; for 20 months.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Who wants to be in a cast for 20 months?
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Almost killed in an accident.
[2:09:33] and he said, "All I want to do,"
[2:09:37] and we needed somebody
[2:09:40] to listen to the tapes
[2:09:42] and get a 27 minute segment so we could
[2:09:46] put it on the radio broadcast. That's
[2:09:48] what he did
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; as a young man as a young man in his
[2:09:54] early 20s. That's what he did. Brother
[2:09:56] John Andy's came here as a 15year-old.
[2:10:00] Brother Ken Andes, his father is here
[2:10:02] and his mother.
[2:10:05] Brother Ken Andes was here many years
[2:10:07] ago and he called me. He said, "I'd like
[2:10:09] to have breakfast with you." We met
[2:10:11] right over here in uh Willowbrook Mall.
[2:10:14] We had breakfast. He said, "Brother
[2:10:17] Biscoll, I feel to leave my family
[2:10:20] here."
[2:10:21] What do you think about that? Do you
[2:10:23] remember that, Brother Kent?
[2:10:25] I said, "Well,
[2:10:28] I I really believe that a father should
[2:10:31] be with the children."
[2:10:34] Well, anyway, he said, "That's what I
[2:10:35] feel led to do." I said, "Okay,
[2:10:40] whatever he feels led to do." And Sister
[2:10:43] Andes and the children
[2:10:47] lived here just across the border
[2:10:50] without their daddy. That was a
[2:10:53] sacrifice
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; for many months at a time
[2:10:57] while he was transcribing and and sister
[2:11:00] and is transcribing the messages off the
[2:11:02] tapes and sending them out of spoken
[2:11:06] word and then voice of God. 37 years.
[2:11:12] That's what I call people giving
[2:11:13] themselves.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; And then someone up in the up there
[2:11:20] doing the Chinese Bible. Why? Because we
[2:11:23] want to do the Bible. No, there was a
[2:11:25] need.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; So we have God brings somebody that
[2:11:29] gives themselves.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Just give themselves
[2:11:34] to God.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; You know what it is, Jeremy, to give
[2:11:36] yourself? You just live your life.
[2:11:40] Say, "Well, there's something in here."
[2:11:43] I bless you.
[2:11:46] You I shook his hand for a purpose.
[2:11:56] You You know, even as young fellows, are
[2:11:58] you 14?
[2:12:00] I was 14
[2:12:02] when a man laid his head on my
[2:12:05] back and said, "Make him a preacher."
[2:12:09] I didn't want to be a preacher. He said,
[2:12:11] "Be a preacher.
[2:12:14] God, make him a preacher."
[2:12:16] And I wept.
[2:12:18] We don't understand these things,
[2:12:20] friends. We don't understand it. There's
[2:12:23] nobody here that's not important.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Every last soul Jesus Christ shed his
[2:12:31] last drops of blood for you, for you
[2:12:34] sisters, for you brothers, for you
[2:12:36] families, for you elderly elder ones.
[2:12:40] God gave himself, he b you think that I
[2:12:43] think this is a small thing. I I realize
[2:12:46] I'm talking to the purchase of the blood
[2:12:49] of God. God God created that blood that
[2:12:53] I'm going to shed that blood and I'm
[2:12:55] going to send my spirit. I'm going to
[2:12:58] call his people and I'm going to send my
[2:13:00] messenger. I'm going to send a voice and
[2:13:03] it'll attract people and I will I will
[2:13:06] select them. I will call this one. I
[2:13:09] will call that one.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, your wife, call her while
[2:13:13] she's in a mall.
[2:13:16] And and do people agree with it? No. Our
[2:13:18] minds fight it and maybe our friends
[2:13:21] fight it and our emotions fight it, but
[2:13:24] yet we can't get away from it. God is
[2:13:27] pulling us. God is pulling us and he's
[2:13:29] pulling us straight into heaven.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:13:43] If there's a little
[2:13:45] something in your heart,
[2:13:49] give yourself to it.
[2:13:51] When you go out these doors, I can't
[2:13:53] necessarily go with you, but I have one
[2:13:56] that can go with you. The Holy Spirit,
[2:13:59] the spirit of God, the son of God, the
[2:14:03] Holy Spirit.
[2:14:07] And I have I I have things friends in
[2:14:09] this message unveiling of God.
[2:14:16] He says, then he'll he'll then he'll
[2:14:17] become when I see everything here. It's
[2:14:21] all happened. This has all happened.
[2:14:24] This has all taken place and it's gone
[2:14:27] by. Whether we have meetings Sunday
[2:14:29] after Sunday, it happens anyway.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Right. While we're sitting here singing
[2:14:35] our songs and having our specials, it's
[2:14:37] happening anyway.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how God cares for a
[2:14:42] person.
[2:14:44] Brother Tim Dodd, he worked at the bank,
[2:14:48] Royal Bank of Canada.
[2:14:52] I had my wife's my wife's sister
[2:14:59] got saved up in Edmonton. Milco took her
[2:15:01] to brother Harold Hillbrand's
[2:15:04] and she gave her heart to Christ. Just
[2:15:06] simple
[2:15:08] came and gave her life to Christ.
[2:15:13] Brother Mila, that's why you were with
[2:15:14] the airlines
[2:15:16] so he could call her and arrange to meet
[2:15:20] her and she gave her life to Christ. We
[2:15:23] weren't there. Sister Biscll, hey, you
[2:15:27] young ladies,
[2:15:28] you think life is difficult to shake
[2:15:30] hands with Sister Biscll after the
[2:15:32] service.
[2:15:34] She prayed and lived as a girl,
[2:15:37] younger than you, Jack. She lived as a
[2:15:40] girl and went to church 37 years and
[2:15:45] never saw anybody of her family come.
[2:15:50] And now God arranges for somebody to be
[2:15:53] on the airlines and her a thousand
[2:15:57] kilometers away and she comes to
[2:15:59] Edmonton and he meets her in Edmonton,
[2:16:02] takes her to church, she gives her life
[2:16:04] to Christ, everything changes.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And her mom is 82 years old. Was
[2:16:12] 82 was here in a log church and she
[2:16:16] hears the message. I baptized hermen.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; My wife. That's the first people she saw
[2:16:23] in her family.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; After 37 years of being a girl,
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; she didn't have to become my wife.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; I lived on the other side of the street.
[2:16:33] I was the vagabond.
[2:16:36] I was a drifter.
[2:16:39] I was the uneducated.
[2:16:41] Her daddy was successful businessman.
[2:16:45] Her daddy was asked to be mayor of the
[2:16:47] city.
[2:16:49] And when I first talked to him, he said
[2:16:51] maybe she wants to travel.
[2:16:55] She could travel,
[2:17:00] but she wanted to be in church. to this
[2:17:02] very day. It's one of the problems I
[2:17:06] have. Sometimes I'm too weary. Sometimes
[2:17:10] I have to study. But she wants to come
[2:17:12] to church. She wants to sit where she's
[2:17:15] sitting. I baptized her mom at 82 years
[2:17:19] old. You want to ask yourself, am I
[2:17:21] prepared to live for Christ? Am I
[2:17:23] prepared to live before my family? I
[2:17:26] don't have any encouragement at home. I
[2:17:28] don't have a mother that's saved. I
[2:17:30] don't have a father saved. In fact, as
[2:17:32] my home is broken, my mother's 2,000
[2:17:35] kilometers away.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; But God had ordained that she be part of
[2:17:43] this message, part of the bride. And on
[2:17:46] the way to be his bride, she become my
[2:17:48] bride. Friends, that's okay.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Shake hands with her after the service.
[2:17:55] She's held true to this message. And I'm
[2:17:58] challenging you now. You hold true to
[2:18:00] this message.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; It's worth every ounce of your strength.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; If anybody has any question about any
[2:18:08] testimony I've given here, I'll be happy
[2:18:10] to give you give you that testimony and
[2:18:12] give you more.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; I can tell you as a witness and I got an
[2:18:19] email this morning from a pastor in
[2:18:21] Tennessee. He says, "I'm so thankful God
[2:18:23] has preserved you as one of the
[2:18:25] witnesses of this message."
[2:18:28] and you have strength. I text him right
[2:18:30] back. I'm just on my way to church. I'm
[2:18:33] going to preach on the light, the son of
[2:18:36] man light. And friends, that's why you
[2:18:39] have some order to your life. That's why
[2:18:42] we have some order to this church. Not
[2:18:45] because we have anything to ourselves,
[2:18:47] but that the light of the gospel has
[2:18:50] shone upon us. And I have identified it.
[2:18:53] You have identified it. We recognize it.
[2:18:56] Amen.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; And we give ourselves to it.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:19:14] Brother Nathan,
[2:19:16] I'd like you to join me in the song.
[2:19:19] We'll walk in the light, the beautiful
[2:19:21] light. Would you like to stand?
[2:19:28] Bow your head with me in prayer.
[2:19:32] If you feel to raise your hand and say,
[2:19:36] "Brother Biscll, I need prayer. I'm
[2:19:39] asking that the Holy Spirit, the one who
[2:19:42] directed you in this to this message,
[2:19:46] is speaking to me. If you'll just raise
[2:19:50] your hand and I'll pray for you where
[2:19:53] our eyes are closed.
[2:19:56] Heavenly Father,
[2:19:58] it is now where you must take over.
[2:20:03] As I felt and prayed this morning, I
[2:20:06] recognize there may be sick people here.
[2:20:09] You're the healer.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; There may be those here, and there are
[2:20:14] who are in darkness. Let the light
[2:20:17] shine. And may the darkness be
[2:20:20] dissipated.
[2:20:21] May the darkness go. And may may there
[2:20:25] be a voice and a light that will shine
[2:20:27] out of darkness upon them. Oh God, save
[2:20:30] the lost. Give us one more. Give us
[2:20:34] another one. Oh God.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will establish. I thank
[2:20:37] you for these young men and young
[2:20:39] ladies. I thank you for the spirit of
[2:20:41] God that's upon them and in them. And as
[2:20:44] our brother John Andy's will be going to
[2:20:46] Poland, I pray, Father, you'll go with
[2:20:48] him and you'll be with his family and
[2:20:51] that remains behind. But I pray that
[2:20:53] you'll go with him. I pray you'll put
[2:20:56] words in his mouth. I pray, oh God, he
[2:20:59] will feel such an uncction that he'll
[2:21:01] know this is a divine event that is
[2:21:04] taking place. Move upon the believers in
[2:21:07] Poland and Czechoslovakia and that whole
[2:21:10] area. Oh God. and perhaps some may
[2:21:13] coming from the Ukraine. I don't know.
[2:21:16] But oh God, I pray you'll be with us in
[2:21:18] Moscow. Another 20 the pastor and over
[2:21:21] 20 of his congregation coming from
[2:21:23] Daesk. I pray oh God you'll move
[2:21:26] mightily. Bless brother Sergey the
[2:21:29] pastor. Give him divine wisdom during
[2:21:31] the meetings. I pray anoint oh God
[2:21:34] brother Tim Dodd and myself father as we
[2:21:38] carry a big load over there. I pray
[2:21:40] you'll anoint, oh God, brother Tom Ray
[2:21:43] as he leaves just now to go and be with
[2:21:45] the saints in Seattle. Oh God, and those
[2:21:48] that gather in Victoria and those that
[2:21:52] are gather, oh God, around the around
[2:21:54] the screen and on the live streaming in
[2:21:58] the name of Jesus Christ, use this
[2:22:01] technology for the for the glory of God.
[2:22:05] be glorified, oh son of God, be
[2:22:09] glorified, I pray. And Father, we're
[2:22:12] seeking to be exactly what we ought to
[2:22:14] be. We do not know what this week holds,
[2:22:18] but we know one thing. You hold the
[2:22:20] future. And you hold our lives. Speak to
[2:22:24] everyone, Lord, as they look so
[2:22:26] attentively. I pray you will speak to
[2:22:28] them. Take these words and cause them to
[2:22:31] ponder them in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:35] Be glorified. How many want to say,
[2:22:38] "Praise be to God." We thank you, Lord.
[2:22:41] We thank you, Lord. Join us in this
[2:22:44] song. We'll walk in the light, the

[2:24:09] Jesus the light of the world.
[2:24:16] We are walking
[2:24:18] the light to beautiful light
[2:24:23] from where the new rocks of mercy are
[2:24:28] bright.
[2:24:30] Shine all around us by day and by night.

[2:25:25] shine all around us by day and by night.
[2:25:32] Jesus
[2:25:34] the light of the world.
[2:25:39] Amen. After a sermon like that, all you
[2:25:41] can say is, "Thank you, Lord."
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; You ought to leave the place this
[2:25:45] morning just saying, "Thank you, Lord."
[2:25:47] Thank you, Lord, for that message. Thank
[2:25:50] you, Lord, for brother Biscll
[2:25:51] unburdening his heart.
[2:25:54] Thank you, Lord, for leaving us a
[2:25:55] witness.
[2:25:57] A witness of what has happened in this
[2:25:59] generation. Thank you, Lord, that I can
[2:26:01] be a part of what you're doing here in
[2:26:04] Cloverdale Bible Way. Thank you, Lord
[2:26:07] Jesus. Let's bow our heads together in a
[2:26:09] word of prayer. Heavenly Father,
[2:26:12] Lord, we thank you. We praise you. We
[2:26:16] exalt the name of Jesus Christ, that
[2:26:19] name above every name. Lord, man cannot
[2:26:23] put together
[2:26:25] these events that have unfolded in these
[2:26:27] last days. And you've allowed it to
[2:26:30] unfold right down to the present time
[2:26:33] that we're living in. And even as
[2:26:35] brother Biscll has said, Lord, do we
[2:26:37] really understand
[2:26:39] the time that we are living in, oh God?
[2:26:43] Lord, I pray that you'll take the word
[2:26:44] that was spoken this morning through
[2:26:46] your servant. And Lord, may you anoint
[2:26:49] it to each one of our hearts. May we
[2:26:51] ponder it, Lord. May we not just leave
[2:26:53] here saying it was a nice message and a
[2:26:55] nice service, but may we leave here in
[2:26:58] the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus
[2:27:01] Christ. that as we go from this place
[2:27:03] that the word would resonate within our
[2:27:06] hearts, giving us what we have need of.
[2:27:08] Oh Lord, you truly have ministered to
[2:27:11] us. Lord, we could say as the scripture
[2:27:14] said, our hearts burned within us as you
[2:27:17] spoke to us this morning. And go with us
[2:27:20] now as we refresh these mortal bodies
[2:27:23] with uh refreshment and relaxation this
[2:27:26] afternoon before the evening service.
[2:27:28] May you bless each one that's able to
[2:27:30] make it back tonight to hear your word
[2:27:33] once again. We commit ourselves to you.
[2:27:35] We commit brother Biscll to you, Lord.
[2:27:38] Strengthen him, Lord. He's committed
[2:27:41] himself to travel and at his age, it's
[2:27:44] not easy, Lord. May you pour in virtue,
[2:27:47] God. Strengthen him for the meetings
[2:27:50] ahead. We commit all to you in Jesus
[2:27:53] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. and shake
[2:27:57] hands with one another as you go. God
[2:27:59] bless you. The service is dismissed
[2:28:01] until the evening service at 5:00.
[2:28:04] Amen.
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:46] Oh, heat.
[2:28:49] [Music]
[2:30:57] Heat. Heat.
[2:31:01] [Music]
