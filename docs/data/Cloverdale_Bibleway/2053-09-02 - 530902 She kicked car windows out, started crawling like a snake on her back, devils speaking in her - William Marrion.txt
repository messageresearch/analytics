TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but many things happen along I remember another night there there something taking place I was at um at Little Rock and there was um and I rever Mr Brown if you'd like for this testimony just write Reverend GH Brown 505 Victor Street VI Victor Street and Little Rock Arkansas we'd been praying and the old the newspapers that give me the office R up saying that there was that I blocked had the ambulance was out there said a a sell Style natly dressed Baptist preacher oh you never heard such in your life but telling her so said it and they had the street cars blocked off in the streets from the ambulances and I've been praying for about 2 or 3 hours and Reverend Brown come to me which is one of the sponsors on the meeting he said brother brandom when you get finished down at the bottom of the auditorium he said there's a case like you never seen before I've been praying for the sick then about 3 or 4 months seen many things in that much time and he said when you get a chance to take a little breath I go to pray for him all night anyhow said come down I want to show you something like you've never seen before I said all right so after a while I went down to the steps and now friends when I got down I'm just telling these things for God's glory you see for the glory of Jesus Christ that you might know some of the things that's happened or millions of things oh I wouldn't say Millions but many thousands of things anyhow it's happened and I went out the bottom of the steps and there laid a lady laying on the floor she was dressed with like shars and she had both hands sticking up like this and her feet sticking right up laying on her back just laying there like that I said there's a typical old Arkansas brother standing there and I said is that your wife he said it is brother Brandon I said why is her her her legs bleeding like they are said well said she's from the insane institution said um she was going to the time of menopause and she had a baby born and it threw her into a premature menopause and the doctor gave her some shots and it went to her head and so she went wild and he'd been in the insane institution 2 years and he had heard about from over Mississippi a solders mother that had been healed and taken out of the institution so he said I brought her said brother Brandon I've got four little children in home and he said and I've I've we've sold her farm and everything he said to to try to get her well and she's taken treatment and said then today he said I I sold my m he said I had to bring her down here and said they let me bring her out just over the night and said they couldn't get her in a handling and I taken some brothers up there and five of us got her out of the place and put her in a car and so that's where she kicked all the glasses out of the car coming down for five men couldn't hold her and when they got her in the building there brother Brown said she' just taken the place said she' just throw a man every way so when they let her down or she lay on her back the store her hands and feet up like that her eyes set real glassy and that's the way she stayed well I said that's too bad I said I'll walk out and take a hold of her hand he said oh brother R don't you do that said she kid you well I said I don't think so and I and it just boy like on the way so not having too much deleting with demonology so he said brother vam I warn you don't do that and I said oh I don't think you'd hurt me brother and I walk down a little step like that walked out on the floor she was laying there her hands up I said how do you do sister tuck a hole of her hand and just as I tuck a hole of her hand I she just gripped down like that and if she gave a pull like that and she pulled me practically off of my feet and she would have threw me across the room and I watch she would have weighed about 10 I guess 70 or 80 lbs and that demon power do you ever see a person possessed with demon power they got four times their strength well the devil can give you four times strength when possessed with him what about possessed with the Holy Ghost how much power could God give you see and then that's the reason you're afraid you it's Don't Be Afraid F away them crutches and get up and start off God's with you if he's anointed you he'll give it to you that's right be Anointed with the Holy Spirit then when this woman she jerked me like that and I almost come off of my feet and I threw my foot like that and caught her right across the breast like this I caught and it pulled my hand out of hers well I I ran back towards the the steps again he said I told you brother Brandon and she started making a real funny noise going m mhm M and she started crawling like a snake on her back just a real you can hear dragging you know just drag drag like that across the floor concrete like that and she got against the wall put her great big Strong Limbs against the wall and kicked like that when she did she hit a a seat and her head hit like that and it there's a seat sitting there where the people have been sitting in before they brought her there and it broke the seat the bench it was and the hair and blood come out of her head she just started making funny noise picked up that thing in her hand like that and threw it at her husband and just knocked the claster Off the Wall where right to the side of where he was at said you see brother Brandon but now all hopes is gone said what can I do and he a poor old fellow started crying put his arms up around me like that old patched overalls on I felt so sorry for the boy and I said well brother look the only thing I know to tell you that this angel that met me told me that if I be sincere and get the people to believe when I prayed that he'd heal the sick I said do you believe that the simple Faith to believe that Jesus Christ the son of God cast out devils and he he has gone up into the father now and he's sharing the form of the Holy Spirit I said I believe he's the same Jesus the day that he was then I said I don't have to tell you what's wrong you know what's wrong he said that's right I said Do you believe if I'll ask God God will do it he said I do and about that time she turned around on her back she said William brandom you have got nothing to do with me I brought her here come crawling up towards me while her husband turned said what's this so that woman don't even know her own name said she hasn't spoke a word in two years I said that wasn't her that was that devil that's that devil he knows that he's going to have to leave the woman if you'll only believe on the Lord Jesus Christ right now and he kept calling like that you have nothing to do with me I brought her here so I said now you agree with me he said all right I said heavenly father in the name of your son Jesus Christ make that devil leave the woman so she didn't never talk no more she just he said what shall I do I said take her own back as the service is over do you believe it's got to happen he said all right so about 3 months after that I was up here at Jonesboro and I had to see somebody back there waving I didn't know who it was sitting right out like that just waving at me and it was a it was the woman sitting there she said don't you recognize me brother random I said no I don't she had her four little children all sitting around she said well the last time you see me they told me that I was bleeding all over and I was out of my head and the he had tucked the woman back had no trouble taking her back she set up and the second day when she's in the institution I said let them dismiss her so the second day they come to her and she was setting up the third day they give her a discharge from the place and her home in her right mind see that's right Jesus Christ was saying yes y today and forever
