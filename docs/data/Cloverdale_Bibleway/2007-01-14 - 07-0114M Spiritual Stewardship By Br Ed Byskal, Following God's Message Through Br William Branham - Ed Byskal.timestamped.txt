[0:03] praise the Lord happy to be in the house
[0:05] of

[0:10] before the service is over you'll even
[0:12] be more thankful you are here
[0:16] amen uh we have uh much to uh say and
[0:21] much to do before tonight is out we have
[0:25] communion this evening Lord's table foot
[0:28] washing and that's always such a
[0:30] glorious time we're happy that you're
[0:32] all here we only wish that those that
[0:35] are part of the invisible
[0:37] congregation on the internet I wish they
[0:40] were here I have a a couple of
[0:43] testimonies I want to give one we were
[0:45] so happy to hear about sister
[0:47] Isabelle uh Weber and uh the testimony
[0:51] she gave but here's another
[0:55] testimony and uh uh this is from Brother
[1:00] Daniel and sister lydy kulen Bruner from
[1:04] Switzerland and sister lyd's parents
[1:08] have been uh watching the
[1:11] congregation uh the service has here the
[1:14] streaming for about a year and a half
[1:19] maybe more than a year and a half now
[1:21] and then told their daughter and her
[1:24] husband about the services streaming and
[1:27] they've been streaming the services
[1:30] and uh here's a a letter I just received
[1:33] from from Brother Daniel and sister
[1:37] ladyy my wife and myself were so much
[1:41] blessed to listen to watch the night Ser
[1:44] the watch night's service and see all
[1:47] the testimonies for the glory of the
[1:50] Lord there is a testimony I'd like also
[1:53] to share with
[1:55] you since more than 12 years we are
[1:59] married
[2:00] a married couple and for about 8 years
[2:04] have tried to have a little baby but it
[2:06] was not
[2:07] possible after a lot of medical tests we
[2:10] were told that I Daniel had a problem
[2:14] and there was no way we could have a
[2:17] baby the doctors did their job and gave
[2:21] the medical proof of why we could not
[2:24] have a baby after all this medical exam
[2:27] our hearts were very much
[2:30] moved and there was just no way that we
[2:34] could ever believe of not having a
[2:37] little baby I always felt that there
[2:40] must be another deep responding to the
[2:42] deep in our hearts of being real parents
[2:46] there was no way we could accept the
[2:49] doctor's diagnostic to be the end of the
[2:52] story so the years went by and waiting
[2:56] sometimes was painful and not without
[2:59] tears
[3:00] in spite of the impossibilities by God's
[3:03] grace we kept the faith we bought a
[3:06] little baby bed and clothes and some
[3:10] year even some years
[3:13] ago then in summer of
[3:15] 205 we heard the testimony of one of
[3:18] your song leaders brother Jason I told
[3:21] Brother Jason I have a surprise for him
[3:24] and sister Emmy this morning we heard
[3:26] the testimony of brother Jason and how
[3:29] they could not have a baby but the Lord
[3:31] made a miracle for them we were so much
[3:35] encouraged by this testimony and our
[3:38] faith was so much strengthened also
[3:41] during the time I went through a prayer
[3:43] line believing that he is the same
[3:47] yesterday today and forever and that my
[3:51] body would be healed and some weeks
[3:54] later we found out that my wife was
[3:57] pregnant and she gave birth on May 28th
[4:00] 806 a little girl called
[4:02] Jolene and uh she is such a lovely baby
[4:06] smiling and reflecting the joy of the
[4:08] Lord we are so happy that he never
[4:11] fails amen isn't that wonderful praise
[4:14] the
[4:21] Lord I think it's just
[4:23] wonderful greetings to you from brother
[4:25] dooka in Congo and he confirmed he
[4:29] expects to be here in July to the
[4:31] convention and of course I think that
[4:34] would be absolutely it wouldn't be the
[4:37] same if we didn't have brother DEA with
[4:39] us they are also planning a Minister's
[4:43] meeting now a ministers meeting over
[4:46] there isn't like it is in anywhere else
[4:48] in the
[4:49] world the last last uh ministers meeting
[4:53] that had of the
[4:55] convention there was
[4:58] 1472 I believe
[5:01] 1476 ministers
[5:03] registered and uh they said that they uh
[5:07] there was not everyone registered so
[5:09] they expected probably over
[5:13] 1,500 ministers he said this time
[5:16] there's such momentum and so many want
[5:19] to come that they're expecting over
[5:21] 3,000
[5:23] ministers from Congo and the surrounding
[5:26] African nations now that might seem
[5:28] quite impossible to you but kinasa I
[5:31] don't know exactly how many million
[5:33] people are in kinasa but I have uh I
[5:37] have in my
[5:38] possession the names of the churches and
[5:42] the addresses of the message churches in
[5:46] kinasa
[5:49] 172
[5:51] 172 churches in the city of
[5:56] kinasa thank you for your silence
[5:59] lets me know you are in a stunned
[6:02] shocked state but that's God's doing
[6:06] that's not man's doing that's a God we
[6:09] serve and so we're so thankful for that
[6:12] brother our brother Timothy
[6:14] Ma has just arrived back a couple of
[6:17] weeks ago from Vietnam and we cannot
[6:20] report on Vietnam like we can on China
[6:23] or other places in the world but he
[6:26] traveled all the way from the north
[6:28] which is right bordering in China all
[6:30] the way to the South names which many
[6:34] are familiar with Saigon and Hanoi the
[6:37] north North Korea South Korea which now
[6:40] is I mean Vietnam which is all now
[6:43] Vietnam in one one country but he's been
[6:48] baptizing ministers and you it it is so
[6:52] different he just is By Word of Mouth
[6:55] there's no way to communicate there's no
[6:58] way to do any Mass publication it's it's
[7:02] unlawful to have a uh a photocopy
[7:06] machine and so there's only certain
[7:08] people uh businesses which have
[7:11] photocopy machines and these ministers
[7:14] are wanting they're coming from other
[7:17] denominations and those that are God is
[7:19] raising up and they're needing the
[7:21] message books the only way to get a
[7:25] message book is to go to a public
[7:28] commercial like a kingho for example uh
[7:31] printing place and have it done it's
[7:34] very expensive it cost on the average of
[7:37] about 75 cents a book a message book to
[7:41] have it done which is just on on on
[7:43] sheets such as letter size sheets and uh
[7:47] so we want to I want want that you'll
[7:51] take this burden this is an ongoing
[7:53] burden it's not something that we just
[7:55] say we'll take an offering today or
[7:56] something like that we we'd like you to
[7:58] remember
[8:00] Vietnam and we are wanting to commit
[8:03] ourselves to see that the ministers and
[8:07] those that are teachers uh we'd like to
[8:10] provide about 200 of them with the
[8:13] messages
[8:14] brother brother Timothy has translated
[8:17] about 300 or oversaw the translation of
[8:22] around 300 messages in Vietnamese in the
[8:26] last few years I'm talking about maybe
[8:29] five years and that is a mammoth Mammoth
[8:32] undertaking and now it is to get those
[8:35] uh to get fund so that we can just
[8:38] publish those and we just want to get it
[8:40] in the hands of the teachers and the
[8:42] ministers so they can teach the message
[8:45] to their people brother Timothy uh
[8:47] travels great distances and then gathers
[8:51] a few uh generally maybe around a table
[8:54] where they're having something to eat so
[8:56] everything is very much incognito
[8:59] and is able to bring the message to
[9:01] these people but I tell you God knows
[9:03] how to reach the elect you say amen God
[9:07] knows how to reach them and so we we
[9:10] want to re remember the uh need in in
[9:15] Vietnam praise God
[9:19] well I'll have you stand and we're going
[9:22] to read and while before we read I'd
[9:24] like to sing I Love You Lord 239 on the
[9:31] screen uh and may I just ask a special
[9:35] request of you that uh some of the
[9:39] things I have to say today are uh maybe
[9:42] a little bit different maybe a little
[9:44] different approach a little strange some
[9:47] of them might seem very very negative
[9:49] some of them might seem um you
[9:53] know uh well there is a negative side to
[9:55] it but I would like you
[9:57] to think
[9:59] with me and to receive from my my words
[10:03] right now that everything negative is
[10:06] for a positive purpose and sometimes we
[10:09] have to look at negative things uh for a
[10:12] positive purpose and uh God has been
[10:15] dealing with me just differently that's
[10:17] all I can say and and and pray that God
[10:20] will convey to
[10:22] you not so it'll be you know brother Ed
[10:26] speaking your pastor speaking but say
[10:29] say Lord deal with me like you're
[10:31] dealing with him and let me catch what
[10:35] it is he's attempting to say because the
[10:38] words only words are only you know only
[10:40] allow you to go so far and we're so
[10:43] limited and God is so great and so
[10:46] wonderful we want to express our love to
[10:49] him just now as we
[10:51] sing I love
[10:59] in
[11:04] my
[11:08] to
[11:09] you oh my
[11:12] [Music]
[11:25] soul you
[11:30] let be
[11:31] [Music]
[11:38] AET join all together once again please
[11:46] [Music]
[12:02] oh my
[12:05] [Music]

[12:35] author of the word to
[12:38] come father I pray that you will send
[12:42] now the Holy Spirit to bring your
[12:45] presence

[13:19] possession of these little bodies these

[13:25] mindful oh Lord I pray you will take us
[13:29] and use us use every effort use every
[13:32] word use oh God what we now surrender to
[13:36] you for we surrender ourselves
[13:38] completely and I ask father that
[13:42] whatever would be pleasing to you that
[13:44] you will accomplish it today break every
[13:47] chain and feather raise up a
[13:50] circumstance that will bind Satan and
[13:53] make his make his attempt to hinder oh
[13:56] God I pray you'll make it invalid
[13:59] render him helpless bring him down low
[14:03] oh God and may the kingdom of God be
[14:06] raised high and glorious before us Lord
[14:11] Jesus I give myself to you anoint me I
[14:14] pray and the people to hear For Your
[14:17] Glory in Jesus name we ask it amen
[14:21] amen I'm going to read out of Luke's
[14:24] gospel the 12th
[14:27] chapter and we'll begin reading at verse
[14:42] 35 let your loins be girded about and
[14:45] your lights
[14:46] burning and ye yourselves like unto men
[14:49] that wait for the Lord when he will
[14:52] return from the wedding that when he
[14:55] cometh and knocketh they may open unto
[14:58] him immediately
[15:00] blessed are those servants whom the Lord
[15:03] when he cometh shall find watching
[15:05] verily I say unto you that he shall G
[15:08] himself and make them to sit down to
[15:11] meet and will come forth and serve
[15:14] them and if he shall come in the second
[15:17] watch or come in the Third Watch and
[15:19] find them so blessed are those
[15:23] servants and this know that if the
[15:26] Goodman of the house had known what hour
[15:29] the thief would come he would have
[15:32] watched and not have suffered his house
[15:33] to be broken
[15:35] through be ye therefore ready also for
[15:38] the son of man cometh at an hour when
[15:40] you think
[15:41] not then Peter said unto him Lord
[15:44] speakest thou this Parable unto us or
[15:48] even to all and the Lord said who then
[15:52] is that faithful and wise Steward whom
[15:55] his Lord shall F shall make ruler over
[15:58] his house hold to give them their
[16:01] portion of meat in their due season
[16:04] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[16:07] when he cometh shall find so
[16:12] doing God bless you as you have your
[16:25] seats you'll need your full focus and
[16:28] full attention
[16:29] in the service this
[16:32] morning I want to speak on uh spiritual
[16:38] stewardship and Steward a steward is a
[16:42] one who is
[16:43] put in charge of the Affairs of someone
[16:48] else
[16:49] or a steward is one who is
[16:53] usted with another person's
[16:56] possessions and stewardship of course
[16:58] then is the act of of being and Jesus
[17:03] said who then is that faithful and wise
[17:08] Steward whom his Lord shall make ruler
[17:11] over his household that's everything the
[17:15] ruler has as Joseph to the Pharaoh and
[17:20] to Piper working with pitifer but to
[17:23] Pharaoh he became uh a faithful Steward
[17:27] over the entire Kingdom at that time and
[17:31] so
[17:32] stewardship is the act of uh having
[17:37] charge having full control being Master
[17:41] over a man's
[17:43] Affairs but also in the in in the
[17:48] economy of God and I'm going to use that
[17:50] word now the Apostle Paul uses the word
[17:55] dispensation four times in the uh New
[17:59] Testament and we'll read those
[18:00] scriptures later on but he says that a
[18:05] dispensation of the Gospel had been
[18:08] given to him and the dispensation in the
[18:12] Greek is from the word Eon which is
[18:14] economy the
[18:16] economy in other words God has not only
[18:20] entrusted
[18:22] man with uh uh with his Goods as it were
[18:27] and we are going to go into this deep
[18:29] and long if you don't mind he's given
[18:31] him a
[18:33] stewardship in a number of areas and
[18:36] going to we're going to give an account
[18:38] for it there's just no way that we're
[18:40] not going to give an account for our
[18:43] stewardship and we've been given we've
[18:46] been given that of God but
[18:50] uh the the the stewardship also is when
[18:54] it comes to the word
[18:56] economy you can find that there are or
[18:59] the dispensation the dispensation
[19:02] because there was we could say there was
[19:04] a dispensation of Eden and from uh from
[19:08] Adam to Noah and and and the economy or
[19:13] the conducting of the Affairs had a
[19:16] certain order to it there was a system
[19:20] we call it and I'm trying to take the
[19:24] Bible terms and bring it into modern
[19:27] terms so you can get get it and then
[19:29] take it and apply it back is that quite
[19:32] clear so we have an economic system
[19:36] today and everybody here is involved in
[19:38] it you have currency which is a means of
[19:42] obtaining things it's a means of trade
[19:45] and we have different all different
[19:47] manner of ways of we got credit and
[19:50] we've got Banking and we've got checks
[19:52] and we've got credit cards and we've got
[19:55] a local economy and we've got a a state
[19:58] economy and a federal economy and a
[20:00] world economy it's it's a system how
[20:02] things operate but from Adam to Noah
[20:07] that was kind of one system and as far
[20:09] as God holding man responsible and then
[20:12] came the judgment and the flood and then
[20:14] we could say from Noah to Moses was
[20:17] almost like a different system a
[20:19] different type of operation because God
[20:22] then said I won't destroy the world
[20:23] anymore by a flood like like that I
[20:26] won't deal with man that way seeing that
[20:28] man is but flesh and then he shortened
[20:31] the years so the system changed and then
[20:34] from Moses the people were saying don't
[20:36] let God speak to us directly because God
[20:39] was uh speaking to the people directly
[20:41] don't let them speak to us it's too too
[20:43] fearsome it's too Dreadful let them
[20:46] speak to you you get the word you come
[20:48] down and tell us and then a different
[20:50] system came into place and then through
[20:52] Moses came the law and all the slaying
[20:55] of the animals and the man become
[20:57] conscious because the law law came Thou
[20:59] shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou
[21:01] shalt not and then he found that he was
[21:03] too weak in the flesh and he couldn't he
[21:06] could not abide by the laws of God so he
[21:09] ended up carrying a guilt and so God
[21:12] made a provision you can bring an animal
[21:14] and bring this kind of an animal at this
[21:16] certain thing and when this happens
[21:18] bring this kind of animal bring a bring
[21:20] a a goat bring a kid bring a ox whatever
[21:24] and then this is what'll happen the
[21:26] priest must do this and he'll take the
[21:27] blood and he'll take the parts and take
[21:29] the innards and take the fat and burn it
[21:31] as an incense and on and on it was an
[21:34] entire system the whole system that was
[21:37] God's economy for a person to become uh
[21:40] free of their guilt for the moment and
[21:43] the high priest would go in on behalf of
[21:45] the people and offered blood once every
[21:47] year and he could not enter without
[21:49] blood it was a whole economic system and
[21:52] then when John the Baptist came on the
[21:54] scene the system began it began to have
[21:58] evidence that was going to change and he
[22:01] said don't say we got Abraham to our
[22:03] father God's able to these stones to
[22:05] raise up children to Abraham and these
[22:08] things now were shocking so we say that
[22:10] then when Christ came on the scene and
[22:12] we could go from John to Christ to the
[22:15] Apostle Paul the whole thing went
[22:18] through a seismic uh uh just a seismic
[22:22] experiences a seismic event when those
[22:25] men started to lay aside and Jesus Jesus
[22:28] was telling him the law being fulfilled
[22:31] and yet he was fulfilling it and he was
[22:33] abiding by the those uh scriptures and
[22:37] doing the things which the law commanded
[22:39] and yet at the same time seemed to be uh
[22:42] he said you know Moses has said you said
[22:45] Moses said but I say unto you what is
[22:48] happening here what was happening is
[22:50] that he was imposing on them a new
[22:52] economy because it was a new
[22:54] dispensation and letting them know the
[22:56] way that you used to get rid of your
[22:58] guilt you can't get rid of it anymore
[22:59] that way the way you used to obtain
[23:01] Mercy you can't obtain it that way
[23:03] anymore because there's a whole new
[23:05] system coming into place and then the
[23:07] Apostle Paul comes and starts to speak
[23:10] of the law and Grace and God turns the
[23:13] corner from law to Grace through the
[23:16] apostles Ministry and then we come to
[23:18] the end time and to the last messenger
[23:21] that was the first messenger when you
[23:22] come to the last messenger the whole
[23:25] economy changes again because a uh a
[23:28] bride has been called out of the church
[23:31] Ages which is the age of the woman and
[23:33] the bride gets called out and the
[23:35] bridegroom comes to the bride Weds her
[23:39] and of course you that are married you
[23:41] that are married and have entered into
[23:43] marriage and have married life you know
[23:46] the economy changes when you get
[23:49] married I'll smile you don't have to you
[23:52] men and women can sit there and look
[23:54] Pious and don't want your wife to
[23:56] see that you really know it Chang
[23:59] changed the old song used to say used to
[24:03] say when I was single my pockets did
[24:07] jingle but anyway it's all right you can
[24:11] look at me however you wish but the
[24:13] economy
[24:14] changes after marriage happens and uh
[24:19] things just are totally different when
[24:22] the husband takes the wife and it
[24:24] changes for the wife too so already now
[24:27] at least I've kind of established the
[24:30] thought and the direction that we're
[24:32] going the message this uh this morning
[24:35] and I'll probably have to uh approach it
[24:38] again but the message I'd like to deal
[24:41] with these subjects the the stewardship
[24:43] over the various things that God has
[24:46] entrusted to us that
[24:49] stewardship the dispensations and I more
[24:52] or less have given to you the
[24:54] dispensations or those eras those times
[24:58] when the system which is the system of
[25:00] the economics or the system under which
[25:03] the stewardship operated and then we as
[25:07] I've just said Adam to Noah and to Moses
[25:10] and to Christ the Apostle Paul to
[25:12] brother brandom in our day and then
[25:14] there's a dispensation of the Millennium
[25:16] Reign and that's going to be different
[25:19] and that's going to be very different
[25:20] also from the Eternal day which is the
[25:24] eighth day all right it changes all all
[25:27] through that then I want to approach
[25:29] also in connection with
[25:31] this the utter insignificance of man and
[25:35] that's where it may seem to
[25:37] be uh rather negative but it's not
[25:41] really and I have been very very much
[25:44] affected by the insignificance of man in
[25:48] connection with God in relationship to
[25:52] God and how great is our
[25:56] God and today
[26:00] so much more
[26:02] than being present in a service such as
[26:05] we are song leader Rises we sing songs
[26:08] and we worship and the musicians play
[26:10] and all the apparatuses in
[26:13] motion and we present ourselves in a
[26:15] certain way but I would like
[26:19] to
[26:21] emphasize and impress upon you that God
[26:24] is looking on the
[26:26] heart and everything that
[26:29] we do or present ourselves and how
[26:33] whatever form we present ourselves is
[26:35] really quite
[26:36] irrelevant God is looking on the heart
[26:39] and those things that may appear to be
[26:41] great are not necessarily great those
[26:44] things which appear to be very very
[26:46] insignificant may not be insignificant
[26:49] God may be looking you me you're looking
[26:51] this direction and I'm standing here at
[26:53] my post of Duty and preaching but it
[26:56] might be something that's happening
[26:57] elsewhere in the congregation that God
[27:00] is really focusing on it may be
[27:02] someone's need it may be someone's it
[27:05] may be someone who you never even hear
[27:08] speak or has never been on the platform
[27:10] or who has never risen to sing a song or
[27:12] to pray a prayer in public it may be
[27:15] that person who's actually touching this
[27:17] great
[27:18] God he's he's a very very mysterious God
[27:22] and yet a very present God and I'd like
[27:25] to you to encourage you to make that
[27:29] touch with
[27:30] him the first one to
[27:32] receive uh a stewardship from God the
[27:36] Bible says and regarding Adam and God
[27:39] blessed them and God said unto them be
[27:44] fruitful
[27:46] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[27:49] subdue it and have dominion over the
[27:53] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[27:56] air and over every living thing that
[28:00] moveth upon the
[28:02] Earth Adam was given this glorious and
[28:08] marvelous
[28:10] stewardship over this planet called
[28:13] Earth and God gave him a position as a
[28:16] Son of
[28:18] God and God of the earth and you are
[28:21] over everything he placed his son in the
[28:25] message Messiah the prophet said said
[28:28] there's something about a man he's a God
[28:31] he was made to be a god his purpose here
[28:35] on Earth was to be a God to have a
[28:38] dominion over everything of the Earth in
[28:42] the earth and in Genesis again 2:15 and
[28:45] the Lord God took the man and put him in
[28:49] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[28:53] keep
[28:54] it he was given that responsibility
[28:59] the law of
[29:00] Moses was
[29:03] certainly considered by the
[29:06] Jews as something that encompassed their
[29:09] entire economy in fact as Moses told
[29:13] them Moses told them how to employ their
[29:17] servants their their
[29:20] slaves H H how they would be free the
[29:24] Year of Jubilee the whole economy the
[29:26] entire system was actually conducted by
[29:31] God through Moses and through the
[29:34] Levites which was the priesthood the
[29:36] ministers to the
[29:40] people in the scripture Apostle Paul
[29:43] says now that's the reason I gave you
[29:46] the foundation at the beginning so I can
[29:48] go back and forth from Old Testament to
[29:50] New Testament in in Ephesians 3 and2
[29:54] Apostle Paul says if you have heard
[29:58] of the dispensation or the economy of
[30:01] the grace of God which is given to me
[30:05] for to you word in other words God has
[30:08] entrusted to me this dispensation or
[30:12] this economy which was a complete change
[30:15] of the system in fact is the Levites as
[30:18] a priesthood was done away with think of
[30:21] the think of the enormously magnitude of
[30:25] this man's position one man in the Earth
[30:28] you talk about a onean Ministry it's one
[30:31] man Ministry and here God through Moses
[30:34] and all of the prophets all down through
[30:37] the whole Old Testament to the coming of
[30:39] Christ and now here stands a man who
[30:42] never even sat under the under the
[30:45] personal Ministry of Jesus Christ on
[30:47] Earth and yet he is saying he's he he's
[30:50] displacing as it were the entire
[30:53] levitical priesthood and putting in
[30:55] pastors and teachers and
[30:58] uh evangelists Apostles and Prophets and
[31:02] establish them as a Ministry and then
[31:04] change the entire system of how the
[31:07] husband and the wife and the children
[31:10] and the deacons and and things which
[31:12] were not even referred to then takes and
[31:15] changes the high priest from the from
[31:19] the from the
[31:22] aonic The Lion of
[31:24] Aaron to the line of Judah I mean this
[31:28] this is something that's just incred it
[31:32] it's incredulous that a man would take
[31:34] this kind of responsibility but God
[31:37] backed him
[31:39] up and so he changed this as I said
[31:43] earlier four times Apostle Paul refers
[31:47] to this and this is absolutely
[31:52] essential no more slaying of animals do
[31:55] you realize animals were slayed by the
[31:57] tens of thousands every
[32:00] year and he with the stroke of his hand
[32:04] as it we is doing away no more slang of
[32:07] animals because the blood of bulls and
[32:09] goats won't do
[32:11] it and he put all the efficacy on Jesus
[32:14] Christ and if you're not washed in the
[32:17] blood of Jesus Christ you still bear
[32:19] your sin and they they could say hey
[32:22] Moses told us Moses God's Prophet with
[32:25] God's word in his mouth that is true but
[32:28] it was a different economy it was a
[32:30] different dispensation and now they
[32:32] moved under another one and he did away
[32:34] with the slang of the
[32:36] animals the shedding of their blood and
[32:40] fact is they could well have asked him
[32:43] are you saying all these millions have
[32:44] been slain in vain like people today
[32:47] said well are you saying that the whole
[32:49] denominational system all the gospel all
[32:52] down through the ages of 2,000 years has
[32:54] been in vain no it's not been in vain it
[32:57] did it thing brother vandom even said
[32:59] don't say they were wrong they were
[33:01] right they were doing their lived in the
[33:03] light that they had but now we come to
[33:05] another economy now we come to another
[33:10] dispensation in the message faith
[33:13] brother Bram said he met Abraham and he
[33:16] gave him the
[33:18] Covenant now not to Abraham if you will
[33:21] do a certain thing I'll do certain
[33:24] things he said I've already passed tense
[33:28] done it it's already settled I've
[33:31] already made the Covenant with Abraham
[33:34] I'm going to save you and I'm going to
[33:36] bring you home with your fathers in a
[33:39] ripe old age nothing you can do about it
[33:42] I've already done it there was
[33:43] completely a different economy
[33:46] completely a different dispensation than
[33:48] what had been in the past the Apostle
[33:51] Paul went on to say for if I do this
[33:54] thing willingly 1 Corinthians 9:17
[33:57] if I do this thing willingly I have a
[34:00] reward but if against my will a
[34:02] dispensation of the Gospel is committed
[34:05] unto me he's saying this whole order has
[34:09] been committed to me in Ephesians 1:10
[34:14] that in the dispensation now listen
[34:16] closely in the dispensation or in the
[34:18] economy when this system is set up in
[34:22] the dispensation of the fullness of
[34:24] [Music]
[34:26] times he might gather together in one
[34:31] all things in Christ both which are in
[34:35] heaven and which are on the earth even
[34:40] in him so now the Apostle Paul has not
[34:43] only saying a dispensation has been
[34:45] committed to me but he's saying there's
[34:47] a there's a time arriving which will be
[34:50] called the
[34:52] fullness the fullness of times and in
[34:56] that fullness will be a time
[34:58] a dispensation or a system will be set
[35:01] up when God will begin to unite the
[35:04] things that are in heaven and the all
[35:07] the things that are in worth in Earth
[35:09] into one which is in Christ which is the
[35:11] word in other words he'll send a word
[35:14] that will gather everything into it and
[35:17] there's nothing outside of
[35:20] that that is called the dispensation of
[35:24] the fullness of times I can tell you we
[35:27] have a arrived we have arrived whereof
[35:30] he said I am made a minister Colossians
[35:33] 1:25 according to the dispensation of
[35:36] God which is given to me for you to
[35:39] fulfill the word of God these are the
[35:44] times and this is the day which our Lord
[35:47] Jesus Christ has revealed himself as a
[35:51] bridegroom at no other time has he
[35:54] revealed himself in such a way he
[35:57] reveals
[35:58] himself as a bridegroom for the purpose
[36:01] of being wed to a wife to a woman to a
[36:05] bride and make her his wife a totally
[36:09] different you must recognize and
[36:12] acknowledge I believe you do in your
[36:15] heart but God sees your heart say I
[36:18] acknowledge that our Lord Jesus Christ
[36:21] has not only come but revealed himself
[36:25] revealed himself as a bridegroom
[36:28] and for the express purpose of being
[36:31] united in a new way in other words
[36:33] friend if you're sitting here today and
[36:35] you feel you're just a church member I
[36:36] got news for you there's thousands and
[36:39] millions of them all over sitting in
[36:40] church today feeling as church members
[36:43] you must not feel just as a church
[36:45] member you must not feel as though
[36:48] you're here even just to sing songs or
[36:50] hear a service you must feel and know
[36:52] within your heart by experience that I
[36:56] have been United I am led to one called
[36:59] Jesus Christ I'm led to this
[37:03] word brother Bram speaks Paul a prisoner
[37:08] and he refers to him as being bound
[37:11] being in bonds to Christ being in bonds
[37:16] being chained to the
[37:19] word you should feel that in your
[37:23] heart I
[37:25] speak especially to those that
[37:28] have have been married or are in a
[37:30] marriage
[37:32] Union and there's a certain sacredness
[37:34] with a marriage
[37:37] Union if a person is living where they
[37:40] ought to
[37:41] live in their marriage Union there's a
[37:44] certain you say oh it's just wonderful
[37:47] love it's more than that there's also
[37:50] fear there's a
[37:52] fear there ought to be an awe and a fear
[37:56] Within the heart of a man or a woman to
[38:00] keep their vows to be true to their
[38:04] partner and to live in such a way so
[38:08] that they are respected and honored and
[38:10] respect and honor one another can you
[38:12] not say Amen to that the system of the
[38:15] world the economics of the world
[38:18] spiritual economics has not been to
[38:21] support or to to encourage that but the
[38:26] the scripture teach es that Hallelujah
[38:29] and it can get quiet if you want but I
[38:31] believe that that's the way it ought to
[38:33] be that's the kind of home God intends
[38:35] on having and I believe if we live by
[38:38] every word of God we'll have that kind
[38:41] of home we'll have that kind of
[38:43] relationship that's what God
[38:46] intends Satan's on a war path trying to
[38:49] destroy it and we're on the war path to
[38:51] destroy his
[38:54] work and that is when the management of
[38:56] household Affairs changes
[39:02] dramatically I think the Book of Ruth
[39:05] and I don't want to get on that because
[39:07] that would take the rest of the service
[39:09] but I think the Book of Ruth is the best
[39:12] example of the dramatic changes that
[39:15] takes place once the bridegroom steps in
[39:18] and in her case her bridegroom was
[39:20] bridegroom Redeemer bridegroom Boaz
[39:25] Redeemer and and as soon as Boaz stepped
[39:28] into her life you talk about economics
[39:31] changing her poverty went out the
[39:34] window
[39:36] Hallelujah she wasn't gleaning a few
[39:38] grains out of somebody's field she now
[39:42] became owner of the field Hallelujah she
[39:45] owned it
[39:48] all coming from being a Barren Widow
[39:52] with no children husband dead not only
[39:55] having now a husband but a husband that
[39:57] brought her to be the mother of
[40:00] Kings Hallelujah you talk about riches
[40:04] you talk about a dramatic change you
[40:07] talk about a change of an economy
[40:09] Hallelujah and not only to be the mother
[40:11] of Kings but to be
[40:13] named glory to be named as the mother of
[40:17] Jesus
[40:20] Christ what a what a type she is for us
[40:23] what an example she is for
[40:26] us that's the kind of economy that
[40:29] changes when the bridegroom takes the
[40:32] wife and in the future home brother
[40:36] brandom
[40:38] says he got to number seven in the
[40:42] dispensations and they said now brother
[40:44] Brandon what are you going to do you've
[40:47] run out of you've run out of your
[40:49] complete sevens what are you going to do
[40:51] now now he says now you're a
[40:54] dispensationalist he said which I am and
[40:57] I believe that God is too says you've
[40:59] noticed you've run out of dispensation
[41:01] types if you're going to put something
[41:04] beyond the seventh day how are you going
[41:06] to get it where are you going now he
[41:09] says all right I'll draw your attention
[41:11] he takes them to Leviticus the uh 23rd
[41:15] chapter I believe it is 23rd chapter and
[41:19] then he begins to talk about the eighth
[41:21] day and he he closes with this I don't
[41:23] want to read it all but he closes with
[41:26] this notice he said seven days has to do
[41:29] with the old
[41:32] creation World Time seven days he said
[41:37] that's the Millennium the rest day and
[41:40] God labored six days rested on the sth
[41:45] the church labor six days and rest on
[41:48] the seventh but you're still in a time
[41:51] element but you see there's no such a
[41:54] thing as eight days there's no such such
[41:57] a thing as eight days you go back again
[42:00] to the first day there's another place
[42:03] you break into eternity friends we're in
[42:05] an element of time and we'll go into a
[42:08] millennium which will still be an
[42:10] element of time but the Millennium will
[42:13] blend into eternity the seventh day when
[42:16] you come to the first day of the week
[42:19] which is today is the first day of the
[42:21] week which is the Eighth Day of a week
[42:23] but you you go into another time another
[42:26] era as far as the dispensations are
[42:29] concerned I can tell you eternity is
[42:32] going to be completely different from
[42:33] the Millennium in the Millennium the
[42:36] world is partially cleaned partially
[42:38] judged and after the Thousand Years
[42:41] there's still certain events but let me
[42:43] announce to you even though this body
[42:46] may go to a teaspoon of Ashes there's an
[42:49] eighth day there's an eighth day and we
[42:52] that have eternal life are in that
[42:55] Eighth Day we have it we possess
[42:57] inwardly but we will have our complete
[43:00] being into an eternal
[43:03] realm how we live I don't know it's a
[43:07] mystery do we eat don't we eat we do
[43:10] those things in Millennium what it's
[43:12] going to be like what kind of body we're
[43:14] going to have I only know it'll be a
[43:16] body like his glorious
[43:21] body what is our purpose
[43:25] here talking about a story stewardship
[43:27] what is our purpose
[43:29] here brother Bram says there's no one
[43:32] that lives on the Earth but what at some
[43:36] time in his life or her
[43:38] life he's got to stop and
[43:43] think where he come
[43:46] from what's his purpose
[43:48] here and where is he going here
[43:51] after everyone Everyone likes would like
[43:55] to look Beyond
[43:57] the
[43:59] curtain maybe you're not just in that
[44:01] frame of mind this
[44:03] morning but quite frankly I would just
[44:07] give anything if I could just look
[44:09] beyond the curtain for a
[44:12] moment brother brandham was taken beyond
[44:14] the curtain he came back and said I
[44:17] cannot be the same brother brandham
[44:21] anymore even just that little
[44:24] Glimpse changed his life forever
[44:27] I say
[44:29] God help us to
[44:33] live to live the kind of
[44:37] life let's live with that in view with
[44:40] that in our
[44:42] mind you think that's all
[44:47] right man is not an island to
[44:52] themselves God has placed us here for a
[44:54] purpose
[44:57] and to give an account for our
[45:01] stewardship God is going to ultimately
[45:04] hold man responsible for what he does
[45:06] with the
[45:08] Earth what you do with your
[45:11] body which you're sitting in
[45:16] today what we do with the
[45:21] message what we do as a congregation as
[45:25] part of the community of the bright
[45:27] Jesus Christ God's going to hold us
[45:30] accountable and responsible for our
[45:33] stewardship job in the midst of his
[45:37] despair when he had his sores running
[45:40] from the top of his head to the soles of
[45:42] his feet and was in a Despicable
[45:45] condition and scraping his body and in
[45:48] such pain and despair he cried out what
[45:52] is
[45:53] man that thou should us Magnify Him
[45:57] and that thou should as set thine heart
[45:59] upon him in another place he said what
[46:02] is man that thou that th that he should
[46:05] be
[46:06] clean and he which is born of a woman
[46:09] that he should be
[46:11] righteous David said what is man that
[46:14] thou are mindful of him and the son of
[46:17] man that thou visitest him one of my
[46:21] favorite scriptures one I cry out quite
[46:23] often in prayer I say what is I think of
[46:27] God I said what is man that thou are
[46:30] mindful of him and the son of man that
[46:34] thou visitest
[46:36] him David said again what is man that
[46:38] thou mindful of him Lord he said what is
[46:42] man that thou takest knowledge of him or
[46:45] the son of man that thou makest account
[46:48] of
[46:49] him Paul in the
[46:52] Hebrews he begins in Hebrews in the
[46:56] second chapter he talks about man being
[46:58] made a little lower than the
[46:59] Angels but he says but one in a certain
[47:02] place which was
[47:04] David testified saying what is man that
[47:06] thou are mindful of him or the son of
[47:10] man that thou visitest him I'd like to
[47:12] take the next few minutes of this
[47:15] service and dwell
[47:17] on our
[47:22] insignificance and how God does not look
[47:24] on the outward appearance but God looks
[47:27] on the heart now someone might say right
[47:30] away when it come to the message and the
[47:32] message says a good deal about uh a
[47:35] woman's dress her hair and her conduct a
[47:39] good deal about men and their conduct
[47:42] and how they act and how we should be
[47:44] and so on so forth and they they'll say
[47:46] right away oh God looks on the heart
[47:49] well the reason though the motive in
[47:52] their heart for saying that is so that
[47:54] they can live worldly
[47:58] that's what's in their heart and that's
[48:00] what God saw now if you're sitting here
[48:03] today just in a certain kind of conduct
[48:08] and a certain kind of
[48:10] deportment we we we conduct ourselves we
[48:14] speak nicely we shake hands and so on
[48:17] but if that's not in our heart remember
[48:19] the handshake means nothing to
[48:22] God it's what's in the heart
[48:25] first it's see and if what God is seeing
[48:28] on the outward is a manifestation of
[48:31] what was in the heart and what was in
[48:34] the heart was pleasing to him then what
[48:36] is being manifested is also pleasing to
[48:39] him have I made that clear tonight we'll
[48:42] take the Lord's table and have foot
[48:44] washing when we are doing that the ACT
[48:47] is right but it needs to be in the heart
[48:50] before it's an act and then the ACT
[48:53] becomes acceptable to God because God
[48:56] sought it in the heart before it became
[48:58] an
[48:59] act young
[49:01] ladies and Sisters of the church if you
[49:04] only dress a certain way because you say
[49:07] well this is the status quo this is what
[49:10] we do in the message but you have no
[49:13] reason for doing it it's not in your
[49:15] heart are you saying you might say to me
[49:17] well are you saying I should just go and
[49:19] live anyway no I'm not saying that at
[49:21] all I'm saying you should get before God
[49:24] and see that it gets in your heart first
[49:27] and let let the outward be a
[49:28] manifestation of what's already in the
[49:31] heart don't do a
[49:36] Warfare when God speaks to us each one
[49:39] about our personal
[49:42] lives we want to make sure it's in the
[49:44] heart God spoke to
[49:48] Samuel I just pray the Lord help us now
[49:51] I have so much and I don't want to rush
[49:53] over too quickly so stay alert if you
[49:56] would pleas please you're a real nice
[49:57] audience this
[49:59] morning and the Lord said to Samuel look
[50:03] not on his
[50:04] countenance or on the height of his
[50:07] stature because I have refused him that
[50:09] was one of the sons David's Brothers he
[50:13] said for the Lord seeth not as a man
[50:16] seeth for a man lookth on the outward
[50:19] appearance but the Lord lookth on the
[50:22] heart God sees the heart and receives
[50:26] what's in the heart and then what what
[50:28] what's in the heart whatever is in the
[50:30] heart will come out will be manifested
[50:33] and God accepts that as well
[50:41] now the most insignificant
[50:45] thing that comes from the
[50:47] heart is infinitely
[50:50] greater than something that you know is
[50:53] out in the open and as a big eye catcher
[51:00] brother brandham was telling about Gypsy
[51:04] Smith how many have heard of gypsy
[51:07] Smith how many haven't heard of gypsy
[51:09] Smith we're going to hear about him now
[51:13] I can't tell you a whole lot about Gypsy
[51:14] Smith but I understand he was saved as a
[51:16] boy about 8 years old understand he was
[51:18] the only one that was at the altar
[51:21] nobody paid any attention that was
[51:22] nothing very great and he was a gypsy
[51:26] his uncle and his father I understand
[51:29] were great
[51:31] Christians but anyway he was in a
[51:36] service and the people and that all the
[51:39] people had give him a love offering and
[51:42] from the depths of their heart he said
[51:43] they had done it many of those people he
[51:47] said are in glory tonight and their
[51:50] reward is with them for helping that
[51:52] wonderful man of God and he said one
[51:55] striking thing now listen son Gypsy
[51:57] Smith told it brother brandham picked it
[51:58] up and now brother bram's telling
[52:01] it I want you to catch it in the
[52:05] context he said one striking thing to
[52:08] Gypsy
[52:09] Smith when he started to leave the
[52:11] audience at night now they' just taken
[52:13] up a love offering so that's quite an
[52:16] event that's happening in a
[52:18] service and when he's leaving the
[52:20] audience that night standing back behind
[52:22] a curtain was a little
[52:24] girl ragged
[52:27] and she had a little present wrapped up
[52:29] in her hand and she said Mr Smith said
[52:33] this is all I
[52:34] have but this is my love offering to
[52:38] you and when he got outside and
[52:40] unwrapped it he said it was a lollipop
[52:44] it was a
[52:46] sucker had been licked on a little
[52:50] bit but she happened to think that it
[52:52] was all that she had to give
[52:57] and he used to
[52:58] tell how it got
[53:02] him said that's right it's all that she
[53:05] had so Gypsy Smith told this a
[53:09] story over and over because it had so
[53:12] gripped
[53:13] him he didn't tell what size the
[53:16] offering was or who put the largest
[53:19] amount in or any of those things even
[53:22] though the prophet says many of them
[53:24] gone on to Glory they've gone on to the
[53:26] reward they got the reward but what got
[53:29] this great man of God's heart was a
[53:33] little licked on
[53:35] lollipop that was wrapped
[53:37] up why because it was all she
[53:43] had we might say that is so
[53:47] insignificant it is hardly worth
[53:50] mentioning but jepsy Smith mentioned
[53:53] it and God's Prophet mentioned it
[53:57] and I'm mentioning it because I want to
[54:00] emphasize there is nothing that is too
[54:03] insignificant to catch the eye of God
[54:07] and to catch the heart of his
[54:11] people and brother brandom Carries On
[54:14] from that and he says you know the one
[54:18] who watched the
[54:19] Widow who put in the two
[54:22] pennies the tithings that time he said
[54:26] he seen listen now this is your Elijah
[54:31] he seen the
[54:33] lollipop don't you believe sure so sure
[54:37] he did he sees everything no matter how
[54:41] insignificant it is he sees me telling
[54:45] this account again
[54:47] today and while it may be so
[54:50] insignificant and so to some it may be
[54:53] so void of a spiritual application
[54:57] but to me it is a it's a profound truth
[55:00] if people can grasp if you can grasp
[55:03] that this God there's nothing escapes
[55:06] him and it's not what I do or what I say
[55:09] with my mouth or what I express in my
[55:12] body my physical being but it's what's
[55:15] in my
[55:16] heart I tell you what friends if we
[55:18] could get our hearts so exposed before
[55:21] God it would change and transform your
[55:23] life your home and this congregation
[55:28] do you believe
[55:33] that then he went on he said Jesus
[55:36] said isn't Two Sparrows sold for one
[55:40] farthing said a farthing's about a
[55:42] fourth of a
[55:44] penny Two Sparrows for one
[55:48] farthing he said how
[55:50] insignificant but he said no Sparrow can
[55:53] even fall to the
[55:54] ground without the the father knowing
[55:57] about it he knows
[55:58] everything so isn't it
[56:01] wonderful to just lay our
[56:04] hearts right out before
[56:08] him brother brenon went on with the
[56:10] woman in another
[56:12] message and he said that she
[56:15] was with a
[56:17] woman now he adds to the
[56:20] story is this all right you're not
[56:24] wearied she adds to he adds to the story
[56:26] said she
[56:28] had perhaps a bunch of
[56:31] children and the little children's Papa
[56:34] was gone and she had two
[56:37] pennies and it was her tithing money
[56:41] just pennies like you all saved and she
[56:43] threw it in the treasury of
[56:48] God Jesus was standing there
[56:52] watching now don't tell me there wasn't
[56:54] a lot of other things for Jesus to see
[56:57] there was a lot of other things that he
[56:59] could have been watching people may be
[57:01] occupied with the architecture and the
[57:03] buildings and the temple and all these
[57:05] great things as his disciples were but
[57:07] here was the creator of heavens and
[57:10] earth watching a
[57:13] widow knowing her husband's dead she's
[57:16] got children at home and he's walking up
[57:19] and watching her and she drops in the
[57:22] two
[57:24] pennies he says and I
[57:27] wondered what would I have done if I'd
[57:29] been standing there he said I'd probably
[57:31] run up and say no no sister don't do
[57:34] that we don't we don't really need
[57:38] it you need it for them children now I
[57:42] said I wouldn't have let her do that but
[57:45] Jesus let her do it he let her do it
[57:49] why he knows it's more blessed to give
[57:52] than it is to receive and he knew what
[57:55] he would do for for her and so
[57:58] apparently there was some something that
[58:00] followed this he knew what he would do
[58:03] for
[58:04] her brother Brandon was
[58:07] praying after this I'm on the subject of
[58:09] insignificance for the moment oh God
[58:12] have
[58:13] mercy I look at the people father and I
[58:16] think of them I think of it here in
[58:18] America my lovely home I love it Lord oh
[58:23] how oh what a great country
[58:26] and we still got the Open Bible we got
[58:29] men of God who stands fearlessly
[58:32] proclaiming the word God how our nation
[58:36] has started off started eating on the
[58:39] other tree he begins to say this is
[58:42] early 1952 two years before I was
[58:47] married I was a young man working when
[58:49] brother Brandon was proclaiming this
[58:52] they've started eating off the other
[58:54] tree
[58:56] said this Free Nation the Bible is open
[58:59] and Men fearlessly declaring the word of
[59:01] God and I can tell you that time they
[59:03] were burning up the country Great Men
[59:06] great you know what it was nothing to
[59:08] have a tent of 20,000 25,000 30,000
[59:13] people and have it filled every night of
[59:15] the
[59:16] week that was nothing in that era we
[59:19] lived in and others are here that
[59:21] remember those times that happened and
[59:23] they were sending out their circulars
[59:25] and it was almost like a competition
[59:27] who's going to have the bigger tent
[59:28] that's what was happening but I now
[59:30] comes a prophet in the midst of that
[59:32] Revival in the midst of all of that
[59:35] great things happening said they started
[59:37] to eat off the other
[59:43] tree allog together he said by
[59:46] education our seminaries and everything
[59:48] they have to be brought out with the
[59:51] fine
[59:53] scholarships oh he says or they won't
[59:55] receive them and you have to belong to
[59:58] their
[59:59] organization they have to be well
[1:00:01] trained and taught oh he said what a
[1:00:06] hindrance how a how a called man of God
[1:00:10] could be winning thousands of souls
[1:00:12] while he's in the school Yonder taking
[1:00:14] it out of him what God put in what a
[1:00:17] Pity I want you to notice this is why
[1:00:20] reading this Lord what can I do about it
[1:00:26] is
[1:00:28] prayer I'm just a little
[1:00:31] insignificant
[1:00:32] illiterate worthy of all of God's Wrath
[1:00:36] to be poured upon me
[1:00:39] uneducated born in a sinful family
[1:00:43] raised by a bootlegged parent oh God how
[1:00:47] did you ever save me it's a mystery to
[1:00:54] me with this I have some
[1:00:59] slides every once in a while I get sent
[1:01:02] something that I think is in they don't
[1:01:05] know what they're doing but I think it's
[1:01:08] important for
[1:01:10] me
[1:01:12] I'm continuing with this our
[1:01:15] insignificance I just want I'm going to
[1:01:18] show you some
[1:01:19] slides some pictures that was
[1:01:23] taken and some comments that were made
[1:01:32] the spacecraft Voyager One sailed away
[1:01:35] from the earth in
[1:01:37] 1990 Voyager at that time was more than
[1:01:40] 4 billion miles from the Earth on its
[1:01:43] way out of the solar system and Ground
[1:01:47] Control issued a command for the distant
[1:01:50] spacecraft to turn around and looking
[1:01:54] back take photos of each of the planets
[1:01:57] it had visited from Voyager fast vast
[1:02:01] distance the Earth was captured in an
[1:02:04] infal point of light in this next slide
[1:02:08] I'll be showing to you in a moment
[1:02:10] you'll have to look between the two
[1:02:11] white tick marks actually smaller than a
[1:02:15] single
[1:02:16] Pixel of the
[1:02:21] photo and here
[1:02:30] it is just there barely
[1:02:32] visible between those two tick marks
[1:02:35] right in the middle this happens to be a
[1:02:38] a ray of sunlight which they had
[1:02:43] not it was
[1:02:46] unplanned and
[1:02:49] uh that was the Earth from 4 billion
[1:02:52] miles that was caught quite by accident
[1:02:55] acent the Earth was captured in one of
[1:02:57] the scattered light rays caused by
[1:03:00] taking the image at an angle so close to
[1:03:03] the Sun and now here is an enlargement
[1:03:06] of the area around our pale blue
[1:03:11] dot and there is the earth in this
[1:03:15] Sunbeam of light suspended there
[1:03:30] we succeeded in taking that picture from
[1:03:33] deep space and if you look at it you see
[1:03:36] a
[1:03:37] DOT that's
[1:03:40] here that's
[1:03:42] home that's
[1:03:45] us on it everyone you ever heard of
[1:03:50] every human being who ever lived lived
[1:03:53] out their lives here
[1:03:57] the aggregate of all our Joys and
[1:04:00] sufferings thousands of confident
[1:04:03] religions ideologies and economic
[1:04:07] doctrines every Hunter and
[1:04:10] forager every hero and
[1:04:12] coward every Creator and destroyer of
[1:04:17] civilizations every King and peasant
[1:04:20] every young couple in love every hopeful
[1:04:23] child every mother and father
[1:04:27] every inventor and Explorer every
[1:04:29] teacher of morals and every corrupt
[1:04:33] politician every superstar and every
[1:04:35] supreme
[1:04:36] leader every saint and sinner in the
[1:04:40] history of our species lived there on a
[1:04:44] moat of dust suspended in a
[1:04:48] Sunbeam the Earth is a very small stage
[1:04:52] in a vast Cosmic Arena think of the
[1:04:56] rivers of blood spilled by all those
[1:04:59] generals and Emperors so that in glory
[1:05:03] and in Triumph they could become a
[1:05:05] moment momentary masters of a fraction
[1:05:08] of a DOT think of the Endless cruelties
[1:05:11] visited by the inhabitants of one corner
[1:05:14] of the dot on scarcely distinguishable
[1:05:18] inhabitants on another the other corner
[1:05:21] of the
[1:05:23] dot how frequent their Mis
[1:05:26] understandings how eager they are to
[1:05:28] kill one
[1:05:29] another how fervent their
[1:05:33] hatreds our
[1:05:35] posturings our imagined self-importance
[1:05:38] the delusion that we have some
[1:05:40] privileged position in the universe are
[1:05:44] challenged by this point of pale
[1:05:48] light our planet is a lonely Speck in
[1:05:51] the great enveloping Cosmic dark in our
[1:05:55] obscur in all this vastness there is no
[1:05:58] hint that help will
[1:06:00] come from elsewhere to save us from
[1:06:06] ourselves there is perhaps no better
[1:06:08] demonstration of the Folly of human
[1:06:10] conceits than the distant image of our
[1:06:14] Tiny World it underscores our
[1:06:16] responsibility to deal more kindly and
[1:06:19] compassionately with one another and to
[1:06:22] preserve and cherish that pale blue dot
[1:06:25] the only home we've ever
[1:06:33] known that affected me very
[1:06:38] profoundly and in all of
[1:06:41] that distant
[1:06:45] expanse God is
[1:06:49] there
[1:06:51] omnipresent omniscient
[1:06:56] how does he radiate his presence out
[1:07:00] from
[1:07:01] this
[1:07:03] universe I think we have God sometimes
[1:07:06] so
[1:07:07] small we think he's
[1:07:10] just you know here and I get all
[1:07:13] swallowed up with my own Affairs and my
[1:07:15] own problems and my
[1:07:18] own and how does God view all of
[1:07:21] this and before I go on I want you to
[1:07:24] think that I'm thinking in relationship
[1:07:25] ship to the message I think of the
[1:07:28] people that rise
[1:07:29] up and it helps
[1:07:32] me to be careful of my actions and my
[1:07:39] words when I think of the enormous
[1:07:43] magnitude of a great God who will call
[1:07:46] me up and you as well and give an
[1:07:49] account for our lives here on this Earth
[1:07:51] that he's given us a an area of
[1:07:54] responsibility
[1:07:56] someone else wrote and I thought I
[1:07:57] should leave this with
[1:08:00] you the scale of the universe is
[1:08:04] awesome our sun is more than a million
[1:08:07] times greater in volume than the
[1:08:11] earth it is only a tiny Speck even the
[1:08:14] sun is only a tiny Speck in the
[1:08:16] unimaginable
[1:08:18] vastness of the Milky Way
[1:08:21] hundreds of billions of such sums Suns
[1:08:26] rather make up this galaxy most of them
[1:08:29] far greater in size than our own and the
[1:08:33] Galaxy
[1:08:34] itself is but a tiny
[1:08:37] Speck among the countless billions of
[1:08:40] galaxies that occupy the
[1:08:43] cosmos that science perceives that's
[1:08:46] what they perceive what they see to set
[1:08:49] our minds reeling you might say brother
[1:08:53] Ed this is a service we're here to
[1:08:55] worship
[1:08:55] hey my father made all
[1:09:01] this my parent made this I'm connected
[1:09:05] to
[1:09:08] this but we're here today and I'm an
[1:09:14] infal
[1:09:17] Speck on a speck of a DOT a speck on a
[1:09:23] speck insignificant
[1:09:26] you better believe
[1:09:28] it our little world and what we make is
[1:09:31] big things and so on so forth unless it
[1:09:34] has some Eternal importance unless it
[1:09:36] has some Eternal significance I say it's
[1:09:39] just going to collapse into
[1:09:44] nothing to set our minds at
[1:09:47] reings it is enough to contemplate the
[1:09:50] bare distances that astronomy has
[1:09:54] measured they haven't been able to
[1:09:55] measure everything this is what they've
[1:09:58] measured light traveling brother
[1:10:00] brandham talks about it I'll maybe make
[1:10:03] reference to it in a few moments
[1:10:05] traveling at
[1:10:06] 186,000 miles per second it's already
[1:10:10] gone some millions of miles just in our
[1:10:14] in this
[1:10:16] message 186,000 Miles a second takes 8
[1:10:21] minutes to reach us from the Sun
[1:10:26] but four years from the nearest
[1:10:29] star eight minutes from the Sun for
[1:10:32] light to reach the Earth in fact is
[1:10:35] someone said for all we know the sun
[1:10:38] could have quit Shing shining it could
[1:10:40] have exploded into nothing we won't know
[1:10:42] for eight minutes we'll have to wait to
[1:10:43] find
[1:10:46] out from the nearest
[1:10:49] star it would take 27,000 years from the
[1:10:53] nearest star
[1:11:00] from the center of the Milky Way and
[1:11:03] 800,000 years
[1:11:06] 800,000 years from the Galaxy
[1:11:12] androma yet androma is now considered a
[1:11:15] member of what is called the local
[1:11:18] cluster of galaxies Beyond which lie
[1:11:21] countless stars and groupings of stars
[1:11:24] thousand thousands of times more distant
[1:11:27] from us than this androma astronomers
[1:11:31] say the Earth is some five billion years
[1:11:35] old that's what astronomers say in the
[1:11:39] beginning God created a heaven on the
[1:11:41] earth
[1:11:44] period Millions trillions we don't know
[1:11:48] astronomers say half a million half a
[1:11:51] billion years old which means that the
[1:11:54] entire history of
[1:11:57] mankind as we record it is but a
[1:12:01] fraction of a second in the time scale
[1:12:04] of Earth just
[1:12:07] Earth it is no exaggeration to say that
[1:12:10] in this picture of the universe not the
[1:12:12] one I showed but the one that's being
[1:12:14] verbally described
[1:12:17] here it is no exaggeration I want you to
[1:12:20] catch this to
[1:12:22] say that in this picture of the Universe
[1:12:26] man is
[1:12:28] crushed within Cosmic time he is
[1:12:33] less than the blinking of an eye in size
[1:12:38] he is not even a
[1:12:40] speck and his continued his continued
[1:12:43] existence is solely at the mercy of such
[1:12:47] colossal colossal dimensions of force
[1:12:50] that the most minor momentary change in
[1:12:53] these forces would be enough to
[1:12:56] obliterate instantly the the very memory
[1:13:01] of human
[1:13:03] life just some little thing then Prophet
[1:13:07] talks about the Earth bursting with its
[1:13:11] volcanics and changing the earth I tell
[1:13:14] you what you can't you can't hardly find
[1:13:16] the Earth just from 4 billion miles
[1:13:18] which is
[1:13:19] nothing it's just a bat of an eye and
[1:13:23] he's and his astronomers say just some
[1:13:25] little change could
[1:13:27] eliminate in just a second that man even
[1:13:31] ever
[1:13:36] existed so what is your point brother
[1:13:39] why have you taken us out there number
[1:13:41] one my father made all of that number
[1:13:44] two he had a purpose in it number three
[1:13:46] he made this little pale DOT number four
[1:13:49] he put me on the DOT number five he put
[1:13:52] you on the dot and we're here for a
[1:13:55] purpose and the only purpose that could
[1:13:58] possibly be for any human is so this
[1:14:01] great God that fills all time and space
[1:14:03] somehow by his presence could come down
[1:14:06] and and and raise up a piece a speck of
[1:14:09] dust Out of the Dust of the ashes of
[1:14:12] this world out of the cosmic forces and
[1:14:15] and things that he has he has produced
[1:14:18] to bring so that he can put a part of
[1:14:21] himself down by the Holy Spirit into the
[1:14:24] IND individual and make some expression
[1:14:27] of his
[1:14:30] greatness Suns and stars and galaxies
[1:14:34] and all of these things and God chooses
[1:14:36] us that's insignificance beyond all all
[1:14:41] all intelligent words talk about
[1:14:44] insignificant we we can't even we don't
[1:14:47] even have a word for our
[1:14:51] insignificant and to think that God
[1:14:58] God Prophet says this what made him
[1:15:03] great and he sees every
[1:15:06] flea and every
[1:15:09] bug every time it bats his eyes I don't
[1:15:14] understand the Universe I certainly
[1:15:15] don't understand God I don't pretend
[1:15:19] to but the scripture
[1:15:21] says the 4 and 20 elders and those that
[1:15:24] were in Heavens and wherever that is
[1:15:28] they fell down and they gave worship to
[1:15:31] him Hallelujah and they said Thou Art
[1:15:33] Worthy oh Lord and I say today Thou Art
[1:15:36] Worthy oh God lift these lips on this
[1:15:39] little speck that's on this little speck
[1:15:41] on this little dot let these lips say
[1:15:44] something that's
[1:15:46] worthwhile we'll get out and chatter
[1:15:48] about what we're going to have for lunch
[1:15:50] and read our menu and go over and talk
[1:15:53] about the weather and about the snow and
[1:15:54] about the ice and a whole bunch of other
[1:15:56] things that just is
[1:15:58] worthless but here we are and you can
[1:16:01] hardly get people to open their mouth to
[1:16:03] say I want to praise the
[1:16:05] god that made Heaven and
[1:16:09] Earth and gave me gave me
[1:16:13] life to say something about this
[1:16:17] God we would not have known this
[1:16:20] invisible God except he came down this
[1:16:22] power this omnipresent power omnicient
[1:16:27] God we would know nothing about him
[1:16:29] except he came down in his in his Beauty
[1:16:32] in Jesus
[1:16:34] Christ and began to move about humanity
[1:16:37] and do good and he saw the sick and he
[1:16:40] healed them he started the possess and
[1:16:42] he drove the Devils out of
[1:16:44] him he's the same God
[1:16:47] today he's the same God at this moment
[1:16:51] and he deserves your life your life is
[1:16:53] worthless with without him there's not a
[1:16:56] man or a woman or a child that's worth
[1:16:59] anything outside of this
[1:17:03] God the only thing you can ever do is
[1:17:07] Express
[1:17:13] him
[1:17:15] hallelujah
[1:17:17] hallelujah friends don't think I'm
[1:17:19] beside
[1:17:21] myself our life is worthless all of our
[1:17:24] achievements and our accomplishments
[1:17:26] down here and what we attain to is is
[1:17:29] less than
[1:17:33] dust oh we get to some status we get to
[1:17:36] some position we get some knowledge we
[1:17:38] get some attitude we get some feeling of
[1:17:41] importance there's nobody here that's
[1:17:45] important there's only one that's
[1:17:47] important that's our Lord Jesus
[1:17:50] Christ and quite frankly what's been
[1:17:52] going through my heart I wish I didn't
[1:17:54] have have to be here preaching I'd like
[1:17:56] to be off in some
[1:17:59] Corner oh

[1:18:28] discover that we were
[1:18:31] here then when you see this vast
[1:18:34] darkness of billions and billions of
[1:18:37] light years of space and think that
[1:18:40] there's one little speck just one little
[1:18:42] speck and the prophet said it's his
[1:18:45] womb he made it for a womb for his seed
[1:18:49] and here comes every form of seed of
[1:18:52] life and it's lifegiving it's life in
[1:18:55] the body life in the animal life life
[1:18:59] this God of
[1:19:01] life and then he comes the in Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ the fullness of the godhead
[1:19:06] bodily and the scripture says in him was
[1:19:09] life that's why he could never attend a
[1:19:12] funeral I attend funerals he never
[1:19:15] attended a funeral he raised him
[1:19:18] up in him was
[1:19:21] life this God's not a god of death he's
[1:19:23] a god of life
[1:19:25] [Music]

[1:19:34] life he come down into this little speck

[1:22:03] all things and for thy pleasure were
[1:22:06] they created all of this was created for
[1:22:10] his pleasure and all forms of life that
[1:22:14] are on this little blue dot were created
[1:22:17] for his
[1:22:18] pleasure and he entrusted man with it
[1:22:22] and unfortunately
[1:22:24] Adam ate from the Tree of
[1:22:26] knowledge and man in this
[1:22:29] generation I think has devoured the
[1:22:33] tree they have so glorified the human
[1:22:36] mind the little
[1:22:39] fragments of indescribably small
[1:22:44] insignificant dust
[1:22:47] particles living on a little blue
[1:22:51] dot God gave man the stewardship of the
[1:22:53] Earth
[1:22:57] who is the god of the Earth the prophet
[1:22:59] says
[1:23:02] man that's his
[1:23:04] domain everything in the earth is
[1:23:06] subject to the to the
[1:23:09] man through sin he fell and through
[1:23:12] Christ's redeeming power he comes back
[1:23:14] again because the Earth belongs to
[1:23:18] man you realize a lot of folks are
[1:23:20] walking on it today that are not going
[1:23:24] to be here when you'll still be here
[1:23:27] this Earth belongs to
[1:23:30] man don't squeeze up
[1:23:33] now God gave God made this place cuz he
[1:23:37] already put you here that shouldn't be a
[1:23:39] mystery he already put you here the only
[1:23:42] thing is we don't know we don't know our
[1:23:44] rightful position and that's why a
[1:23:46] message come that to restore everything
[1:23:49] everything lost in Adam was brought back
[1:23:51] in Jesus Christ
[1:23:54] maybe we haven't come into our full
[1:23:56] inheritance and I know we haven't but
[1:23:58] nevertheless it does not change the
[1:24:00] truth of it and we should be moving
[1:24:02] forward it belongs to me it's mine it's
[1:24:06] mine it's mine in
[1:24:14] Christ the seventh angel sounded there
[1:24:17] was great voices in heaven saying the
[1:24:19] kingdom of this world are become the
[1:24:21] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[1:24:25] and he shall reign forever and ever the
[1:24:28] 4 and 20 Elders which sat before God on
[1:24:31] the seats fell upon their faces and
[1:24:33] worshiped God saying we give thee thanks
[1:24:36] oh Lord God Almighty which art which and
[1:24:40] was and art to come because thou H has
[1:24:42] taken to thee thy great power and Hast
[1:24:45] reigned and here's the scripture I want
[1:24:47] to leave with you and the nations were
[1:24:50] angry and the and the Wrath and thy
[1:24:53] wrath has come in the time of the Dead
[1:24:56] that they should be judged and that thou
[1:24:59] should give reward unto thy servants the
[1:25:02] prophets and to the Saints and to them
[1:25:05] that fear thy name small and great and
[1:25:09] should destroy them that destroy the
[1:25:13] Earth time
[1:25:15] come when God will
[1:25:18] recognize his purpose in you on the
[1:25:21] earth and we'll go and walk into a full
[1:25:23] reward for for here we suffer all kinds
[1:25:26] of things but that's there's a Time
[1:25:29] coming and there's a Time coming when
[1:25:31] all who are in the world will be judged
[1:25:36] for their
[1:25:37] responsibility just think of the world
[1:25:39] now that you live in the job where
[1:25:41] you're
[1:25:42] at the radio program you hear the
[1:25:45] newspaper you
[1:25:47] read the magazines that are confronting
[1:25:50] you
[1:25:51] regularly the television screens and the
[1:25:53] restaurant and whatever
[1:25:57] more to corrupt they that destroy the
[1:26:01] Earth to corrupt it to cause it to
[1:26:05] perish to change it for the
[1:26:09] worse isn't that
[1:26:12] so to corrupt the
[1:26:15] minds full page almost a whole page of
[1:26:18] the Vancouver son I wished I'd saved it
[1:26:20] but I wouldn't want to read
[1:26:22] it and the whole the whole the whole
[1:26:26] subject was that just a few years ago
[1:26:31] stuff that you couldn't even wouldn't
[1:26:33] even be allowed on the television screen
[1:26:36] today not only is a common place but
[1:26:40] they said that we have come to a certain
[1:26:43] maturity in the media and now
[1:26:46] pornography is on the screen all the
[1:26:50] time I say and God's going to judge them
[1:26:53] for it God's going to hold them
[1:26:55] responsible for corrupting the minds of
[1:26:58] our young people our children of every
[1:27:01] man and every woman God's going to hold
[1:27:03] somebody responsible I wouldn't want the
[1:27:05] man who wrote that software I wouldn't
[1:27:08] want to be the person who took those
[1:27:21] pictures and the word to destroy come
[1:27:23] from
[1:27:24] another word which is to
[1:27:27] accuse because he's the accuser he
[1:27:30] didn't only come to pollute he's the one
[1:27:33] who devised all of these things to
[1:27:38] corrupt they destroy the Earth and
[1:27:41] destroy this Earth he's not only doing
[1:27:44] that but now he comes in through the
[1:27:46] back door and accuses you for being what
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:50] are for being what he designed a person
[1:27:53] to be
[1:27:54] I'm not saying what you are you
[1:27:56] understand my you understand the context
[1:27:59] in which I'm speaking
[1:28:01] this he's an accuser and to accuse is
[1:28:04] from a Greek word is to throw over or AC
[1:28:08] Cross or to cross over he was the one
[1:28:11] who caused Eve to cross over the barrier
[1:28:13] of the word that was protecting her and
[1:28:16] enticed her out from the word listen
[1:28:18] especially young people how this world
[1:28:21] is designed for young people automobiles
[1:28:24] are designed for young people the
[1:28:26] clothing and everything designed for the
[1:28:28] young people and Satan is behind all of
[1:28:30] this fashion to entice you across the
[1:28:33] border of the
[1:28:35] word the boundary of the word you hold
[1:28:39] your body's sacred both men and women
[1:28:42] hold yourself sacred before God let you
[1:28:44] be oldfashioned be whatever they want
[1:28:47] remember the little blue dot and you're
[1:28:49] just here for a speck of
[1:28:52] time they can't even measure measure
[1:28:54] that time it's so
[1:28:57] brief I'm here for a long time don't you
[1:28:59] even think it one little movement in the
[1:29:03] cosmos they said they wouldn't even be
[1:29:05] able to remember the existence of
[1:29:09] man and we're
[1:29:11] important it'll help you to realize our
[1:29:15] insignificance which will cause you to
[1:29:18] say what what what is there to make my
[1:29:21] life worthwhile
[1:29:24] why do I struggle why do I study why do
[1:29:26] I work what is it all about it's
[1:29:29] worthless unless God Is In You by the
[1:29:33] Holy Spirit giving some purpose to your
[1:29:37] life I declare in the name of the Lord
[1:29:40] you'll pass off the scene and many many
[1:29:43] people who come into contact with the
[1:29:44] message will pass off the scene and and
[1:29:47] and be a spe that becomes no
[1:29:50] more unless by the new birth God is
[1:29:54] allowed to live and Reign and rule in
[1:29:57] your heart I don't even know how this
[1:29:59] God can do that I'll say with the
[1:30:03] prophet it's a mystery to
[1:30:10] me the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
[1:30:15] agency
[1:30:18] NOAA is reporting that the
[1:30:21] temperatures temperature data collected
[1:30:23] over the last over 1,200
[1:30:26] 1,200 monitoring stations just in the
[1:30:30] lower 48 states shows that 206 was the
[1:30:34] warmest year on the record and the
[1:30:37] recordkeeping began in 1895 for for a
[1:30:41] 100 107
[1:30:43] years it's been the last year was the
[1:30:47] warmest and the News encouraged media
[1:30:50] reports that the climate apocalypse is a
[1:30:54] on
[1:30:55] us if global temperatures continue to
[1:30:58] rise as projected melting ice caps could
[1:31:02] rise sea levels worldwide of up to 3
[1:31:05] feet by 2100 swamping Coastal
[1:31:08] communities and are at home that are
[1:31:11] home for millions of people right now
[1:31:12] it's in newspapers all the time
[1:31:14] continuously because at this very moment
[1:31:17] Canada has a great concern for the polar
[1:31:19] bears they don't know how to feed them
[1:31:21] and they're coming down into Churchill
[1:31:23] Manitoba coming down to civilization
[1:31:26] because because of the melting of the
[1:31:28] polar caps in fact is my neighbor who's
[1:31:30] not a Christian not a Believer as such
[1:31:33] so RCMP
[1:31:35] Sergeant who spent time on the
[1:31:37] Detachment in elmir Island up in the Far
[1:31:40] Far Arctic region he said he said a year
[1:31:43] and a half ago a huge chunk of the ice
[1:31:47] cap actually broke
[1:31:50] loose of the ice cap itself it broke
[1:31:53] free and began to drift out he said the
[1:31:55] Canadian government didn't even didn't
[1:31:57] even announce it didn't even make it
[1:31:59] known for a year and a half he said
[1:32:02] they're they're they're in real
[1:32:06] trouble
[1:32:08] man is destroying the Earth One study
[1:32:12] estimates that a third of the Earth's
[1:32:15] creatures a third of the Earth's
[1:32:17] creatures will be condemned to
[1:32:19] extinction by 2050
[1:32:24] if time goes on you young people are
[1:32:26] going to be around here most of you
[1:32:31] 2050 not that many years a third of the
[1:32:34] Earth's creatures are doomed to
[1:32:37] Extinction if we continue this direction
[1:32:40] keeping up the current pace of emissions
[1:32:43] for 10 more years will reversibly
[1:32:46] irreversibly alter the earth's climate
[1:32:49] they in other words they won't be able
[1:32:50] to bring it back to where it should be
[1:32:52] just in 10 years
[1:32:55] where did the last 10 years go
[1:33:00] folks sewage pollution you
[1:33:05] say well brother Ed I don't know if we
[1:33:07] want to hear about this well I'll tell
[1:33:08] you what this
[1:33:11] statistic is just it pales into
[1:33:14] insignificance when you think of the
[1:33:17] pollution that's being preached over
[1:33:20] pulpits right and in churches and over
[1:33:24] the radio and in television absolute
[1:33:28] spiritual pollution and I'm speaking on
[1:33:31] spiritual
[1:33:34] stewardship God has given you a great
[1:33:37] responsibility I say what are you going
[1:33:38] to do with
[1:33:39] it you say if somebody here dropped a
[1:33:42] here here's a million dollars you're in
[1:33:45] charge of this don't you let it diminish
[1:33:49] don't you lose it don't you risk it I'll
[1:33:52] be back I'm going away I'll be back at a
[1:33:55] certain time and I want to see what you
[1:33:57] did with it that
[1:33:59] stewardship not a lousy million dollars
[1:34:02] that doesn't even appear on the map of
[1:34:04] God's economy but the Mysteries the
[1:34:07] scripture says that the that the
[1:34:11] Mysteries God has made us I can read the
[1:34:14] scripture God has made us stewards of
[1:34:17] the mysteries of
[1:34:22] God I wouldn't take and waste an
[1:34:25] investment that God gave me and let
[1:34:27] somebody just trample it under fooot and
[1:34:29] neither will I take this message and let
[1:34:31] them trample it under
[1:34:33] fooot I like what brother Timothy ma
[1:34:35] said to me I questioned him I because I
[1:34:37] want accountability I said how do you
[1:34:40] get these men the these men that are are
[1:34:43] are are Servants of Christ how do you
[1:34:45] know they're Servants of Christ he said
[1:34:47] they have to want this message before I
[1:34:49] give them a book they have to want it
[1:34:52] they have to desire
[1:34:54] and I appreciated that
[1:34:58] answer the US environmental the EPA
[1:35:01] which is well recognized for all of you
[1:35:04] across the
[1:35:05] border estimates that every year every
[1:35:09] year in every County Across the
[1:35:13] Nation I know there's 48 lower States
[1:35:16] but every County across the entire
[1:35:20] nation the amount of untreated
[1:35:24] sewage that enters the
[1:35:26] environment is enough to fill both the
[1:35:29] Empire State Building and Madison Square
[1:35:32] Gardens from every
[1:35:37] County in Hamilton County
[1:35:40] Ohio a single sewage
[1:35:43] discharge one single sewage discharge is
[1:35:47] 75 million gallons of untreated sewage
[1:35:51] into mil Creek every year here including
[1:35:54] during summer months when children swim
[1:35:57] in the
[1:35:59] river in Indianapolis more than 1
[1:36:02] billion gallons of untreated sewage are
[1:36:05] discharged into the environment each
[1:36:08] year because treatment plants cannot
[1:36:10] handle the flow during the wet weather
[1:36:13] in each year 1.8 million to 3.5 million
[1:36:19] illnesses are caused by swimming in
[1:36:22] water contaminated by sewage overflows
[1:36:25] and an additional 500,000 from drinking
[1:36:29] contaminated
[1:36:31] water in Christianity are you with
[1:36:35] me in Christianity versus
[1:36:39] idolatry the prophet now said where it
[1:36:42] said baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:36:44] Jesus Christ they make Father Son and
[1:36:46] Holy Ghost three Gods out of it he said
[1:36:49] they corrupt the ways of God let the
[1:36:52] people come in the church women with
[1:36:54] bobbed hair wearing makeup dresses on
[1:36:57] that look scandalous men so sissified
[1:37:00] let a woman lead them around by the ear
[1:37:03] come to the church and playing bunkle
[1:37:05] games and Bingle and all other things of
[1:37:08] corruption things and the preachers and
[1:37:10] so forth out on the banks with naked
[1:37:12] women dressed in bathing suits and going
[1:37:15] swimming smoking cigarettes and calling
[1:37:17] themselves Servants of God when this
[1:37:20] Temple is the Temple dedicated to God
[1:37:23] not not to fills of the
[1:37:25] world say Amen
[1:37:29] am says I stood there yesterday in end
[1:37:31] time evangelism just bear with me
[1:37:34] another few minutes please I stood there
[1:37:36] yesterday and looked at that swimming
[1:37:38] pool this is
[1:37:40] 1962 I stood there at looked at the
[1:37:43] swimming pool just below us and I
[1:37:45] wondered when a man who's a Sunday
[1:37:47] school teacher said to me that ought to
[1:37:50] have been in the bible where jesus spit
[1:37:53] and said it's against the sanitation
[1:37:55] rules when Jesus spit and took his
[1:37:58] spittle when Jesus spit in the ground
[1:38:00] and took his spitt and the clay and
[1:38:02] Anointed The Man's eyes this Sunday
[1:38:05] school teacher says to the prophet that
[1:38:07] shouldn't be in allowed in the Bible
[1:38:09] because of its because of its uh uh uh
[1:38:13] because it's unsanitary and he says he
[1:38:16] took his hand and he reached down and
[1:38:17] picked up the spitt with the dirt and
[1:38:19] rubbed it to Man's eyes and said go and
[1:38:22] wash in the pool of silom and your eyes
[1:38:24] will be will come open and he went and
[1:38:27] washed and his eyes came open so this
[1:38:30] fellow said to me that would not work
[1:38:34] today that's against the sanitation
[1:38:36] rules the health rules and then that
[1:38:39] same man take his family wife and all
[1:38:42] those children down to the swimming pool
[1:38:45] where those women and men and all that
[1:38:49] water and all the water at times they in
[1:38:52] that water at times times of the month
[1:38:54] that they shouldn't be in and all that
[1:38:57] they never go into the restroom
[1:38:59] sometimes and all them dirty bodies and
[1:39:02] filth in there and them spurting it in
[1:39:05] and through their mouth and eyes and
[1:39:07] things like that and then they say that
[1:39:09] Jesus spitting in the ground to make a
[1:39:12] man
[1:39:16] see he says I brought a little boy from
[1:39:20] there the other day and he said I SW
[1:39:23] swallowed some of that
[1:39:25] water and he said I'm sick as a horse
[1:39:28] I'm going home the little fellow may be
[1:39:31] sitting here now who lives in a trailer
[1:39:34] about two or three blocks down the
[1:39:36] street where I took him and said and he
[1:39:38] said I'll never go in there
[1:39:47] again I got paper in my
[1:39:50] hands the paper industry
[1:39:55] each year due to the ongoing
[1:39:58] demand they clearcut logging a half a
[1:40:02] million Acres every year of Ontario and
[1:40:10] Alberta
[1:40:12] Primal Prim
[1:40:15] Primal fur and Spruce and so on
[1:40:24] they said there's
[1:40:25] 32% more carbon
[1:40:30] dioxide than it did at the start of the
[1:40:33] Industrial Revolution the industrial
[1:40:37] era they say that United States put 7
[1:40:42] million
[1:40:44] tons of this
[1:40:46] pollution in the
[1:40:48] air brother Bram said Satan's gospel is
[1:40:52] knowledge
[1:40:53] knowledge has done this
[1:40:55] folks we're on a little pale
[1:40:59] dot a speck in the
[1:41:02] universe but
[1:41:04] man is so caught
[1:41:07] up Bloodshed and
[1:41:10] War and all the voices you think those
[1:41:14] voices aren't heard they're circling
[1:41:17] this little
[1:41:18] Globe this little Dot and probably going
[1:41:22] off
[1:41:23] into the abyss of the darkness of the
[1:41:26] universe but God knows it
[1:41:32] all he said knowledge you know Satan's
[1:41:35] gospel is
[1:41:37] knowledge and he says do you know that
[1:41:40] he preached it in the Garden of Eden to
[1:41:43] Eve and she was deceived by his
[1:41:45] knowledge gospel and now he has polluted
[1:41:51] the whole human race with it and that's
[1:41:54] exactly right you know friends I want to
[1:41:56] say to you I'm going to be closing
[1:42:00] soon brother brandham spoke in
[1:42:04] terms I can even see it as I hear the
[1:42:08] message I'm listening to birth
[1:42:11] pains and how this
[1:42:13] Earth is in such a
[1:42:16] upheaval and he brings it down it has to
[1:42:19] it has to give birth it has
[1:42:21] to it has to conver
[1:42:23] vse says it can't stand another one but
[1:42:26] it
[1:42:27] will this next one's going to birth it
[1:42:29] into a new
[1:42:33] world and I want to be a
[1:42:37] speck in that new
[1:42:40] world and the only assurance we have
[1:42:43] today that we will be there I don't want
[1:42:46] to go off into
[1:42:47] nothing when we're held accountable for
[1:42:50] said even if we can say something so
[1:42:52] simple the little World maybe comes up
[1:42:54] before God and all you can say I gave a
[1:42:58] lollipop it was all I had I gave it to a
[1:43:02] man of God as a love offering do you
[1:43:05] know what I believe our Lord will say
[1:43:07] enter
[1:43:09] in you blessed of the Lord enter
[1:43:17] in says well master I worked I slugged
[1:43:21] it out I slaved and I I I build up this
[1:43:24] and I build up that
[1:43:28] and I went to church and I became this
[1:43:30] and I became
[1:43:32] that what was in your
[1:43:35] heart that's what's important this
[1:43:39] morning my wife doesn't like to sing
[1:43:42] anymore so I don't call on her but she
[1:43:44] sings a song maybe you'll have the
[1:43:46] musicians come how about your
[1:43:50] heart friend what would you
[1:43:54] say if your heart were made with a
[1:43:57] window on both
[1:43:59] sides and people could look through and
[1:44:02] see what's in the
[1:44:04] heart tell you what
[1:44:06] friends this God that made this
[1:44:10] universe he doesn't need a window on
[1:44:12] each side he looks right down into our
[1:44:15] heart and sees us this isn't to be a
[1:44:19] condemnation he's not looking
[1:44:21] down to bring
[1:44:23] condemnation upon us but he's looking
[1:44:25] down to really see what is there and if
[1:44:28] it's not there of reality it's not there
[1:44:30] real experience you know something
[1:44:33] friends brother red
[1:44:36] 72 I knil in my desk
[1:44:40] yesterday and something came to my
[1:44:44] mind I'm not emotional about this my
[1:44:46] sisters here we lost our mom as most of
[1:44:50] you know at an early age she was 11
[1:44:53] I was 6 and a
[1:44:55] half and then from then we didn't know
[1:44:58] much about home life we traveled a thou
[1:45:01] over a thousand miles on a
[1:45:04] train with a stepmother we didn't know
[1:45:07] either one of
[1:45:08] us and we arrived in the town where my
[1:45:11] wife was born in Dawson
[1:45:13] Creek and that day my my sister was
[1:45:16] taken to brother bre Lang's home he was
[1:45:20] overseas in the war
[1:45:23] and was taken to her home because they
[1:45:24] had a daughter sister brother Brett's
[1:45:27] about her age and that's where she would
[1:45:29] go and I was
[1:45:31] taken way into the to a Pioneer Family
[1:45:35] over a river over the piece River on a
[1:45:39] barge and that's where I spent the next
[1:45:41] eight months and then I was just tracing
[1:45:43] my life when I was I was thinking about
[1:45:45] all of
[1:45:47] this what what what am
[1:45:50] I what is a spec
[1:45:54] all of humanity to God i' I've been
[1:45:56] trying to comprehend eternity it's been
[1:45:59] such a a gripping compelling thought in
[1:46:03] my mind eternity how can it be without
[1:46:06] how can how can this being who I don't
[1:46:09] even feel worthy to come in here and
[1:46:11] talk about him when I know he never had
[1:46:13] a beginning never had an end who who am
[1:46:16] I I try to grasp that how can I ever be
[1:46:19] worthy I can't so it just magnifies
[1:46:22] Grace gets greater greater and greater
[1:46:24] and
[1:46:25] greater with the grace of
[1:46:28] God and I just was going back over my
[1:46:30] life and I
[1:46:33] thought didn't really have a home
[1:46:37] much didn't have parent it was just like
[1:46:42] a I can't explain
[1:46:44] it just like something
[1:46:47] inside I didn't call for it I didn't ask
[1:46:52] for it
[1:46:53] but something
[1:46:54] inside wasn't in my mind it was he it
[1:46:57] because it touched me
[1:46:59] immediately I'm your
[1:47:03] parent and I found out of my mouth say
[1:47:06] you're my
[1:47:08] mother you're my father I came from your
[1:47:11] seed and you're my mother you gave me
[1:47:14] birth and you gave me and then I begin
[1:47:16] to see
[1:47:19] God expressing himself through
[1:47:21] individuals and different ones and I
[1:47:24] then I begin to think of some here in
[1:47:26] the church and you mothers your mothers
[1:47:28] to more than just your family even
[1:47:31] mothers to other and you got that kind
[1:47:33] of spirit that fathers would give
[1:47:35] counsel and
[1:47:36] advice let me say to you young people in
[1:47:40] the beauty of your Youth and your
[1:47:41] strength if you spend it for anything
[1:47:44] other than God by the holy spirit in you
[1:47:47] it's a total vapor and a total
[1:47:51] waste and it'll never never be
[1:47:53] remembered anymore and your little life
[1:47:56] here as James says what is your life
[1:47:58] it's even as a vapor it appears for a
[1:48:01] little while and I showed you today with
[1:48:03] in the in the in the view of the cosmic
[1:48:06] all of mankind all of known history
[1:48:09] couldn't even be known it wouldn't be a
[1:48:11] flash all of it all of history would be
[1:48:13] gone what are we in the view of
[1:48:16] that the only thing the only thing that
[1:48:20] we can that is worthwhile
[1:48:23] and we have the little phrase only one
[1:48:26] life will soon be passed only What's
[1:48:29] Done For Christ will last and I leave
[1:48:32] that with you maybe not a great
[1:48:37] deep message of mysteries and all the
[1:48:40] rest of it to me this is the mystery of
[1:48:42] life to me this is something
[1:48:45] real this has made God so much greater
[1:48:48] to me J even in the last few days I
[1:48:51] thought how I been on the road too
[1:48:54] long I should have been feeling
[1:48:57] this have to forgive me folks said God
[1:49:01] why why didn't you why didn't I think of
[1:49:03] this when I was
[1:49:04] 20 why didn't I have somebody tell me
[1:49:07] this when I was
[1:49:09] young I I feel I could have burned out
[1:49:12] more energy I could have done
[1:49:18] more it's had an
[1:49:20] effect on me I want to serve him
[1:49:24] and do what I can
[1:49:26] do and even if it's just a
[1:49:29] lollipop or some little thing that you
[1:49:31] think is insignificant when it's from
[1:49:33] the
[1:49:33] heart when it's from the heart it's not
[1:49:37] insignificant it's great in the sight of
[1:49:41] God and I leave you with this
[1:49:57] it's not my words I think they'll mean a
[1:50:00] whole lot more to you when it's a
[1:50:02] prophet's
[1:50:05] words and I'd like to just be down I'd
[1:50:08] like to be across the table for me I'd
[1:50:09] like to have you sitting in the chair

[1:50:12] me and I'd like to say I'd like to just
[1:50:14] say well brother brand I I've repeated
[1:50:17] your words to
[1:50:19] them I don't care how insignificant

[1:59:47] who's in control of it all how important
[1:59:51] is this
[1:59:52] and that will put things into
[1:59:54] perspective for you you got a financial
[1:59:56] problem you got a maral problem you got
[1:59:58] a family problem you got some other kind
[2:00:00] of problem or some other kind of
[2:00:02] difficulty I want you to look at it in
[2:00:04] relationship to what I spoke
[2:00:07] today and just see how important it is
[2:00:10] and then that will help you determine
[2:00:12] what you should
[2:00:15] do that sounds to me like I'm speaking a
[2:00:17] mystery that to me is so simple
[2:00:24] some people hold chips on their
[2:00:25] shoulders for years you want to take
[2:00:28] that chip on your shoulder and to think
[2:00:29] well I've been hurt and someone said
[2:00:31] this and all the rest of it and you have
[2:00:33] that hurt in your heart and and we're
[2:00:35] coming to communion tonight take that
[2:00:37] hurt out hold it in front of you and
[2:00:38] just see how important it is how
[2:00:40] important is it going to be 10 billion
[2:00:42] late years from now how important is it
[2:00:45] going to be it's
[2:00:46] nothing it's nothing let God tend to it
[2:00:51] and he say amen do the right
[2:00:55] thing so what would be the right thing
[2:00:58] forgiveness I can think of
[2:01:01] forgiveness I can think of some I can
[2:01:03] think of some attributes of God and you
[2:01:05] you you can
[2:01:07] too so what would God do do what he
[2:01:11] would do and then you'll be doing the
[2:01:13] right
[2:01:14] thing
