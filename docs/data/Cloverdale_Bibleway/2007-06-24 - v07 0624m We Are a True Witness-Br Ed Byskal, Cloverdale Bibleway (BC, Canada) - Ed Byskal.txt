TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] service deacons and the ushers for the convention. So please any of you who have been contacted uh will be serving as uh ushers uh and all of the deacons uh to meet in the uh chapel immediately after the service. Um apparently up at the Pacific Academy Auditorium uh they've told us that there is only parking for 500 cars and that means that we may run into a parking problem. As a result, we'd like to have as many people as possible carpool on the way there. Um, and as well what you can do is use this parking lot as maybe a a place where you can drop your car off and then uh and this would apply for young people. So if you know if you're driving a brother or a sister and you got one person in a car, pick up some people, arrange to meet here and then go over together. And I think that would be uh uh help us a great deal as we don't want to have uh visitors uh walking a long ways. um and and really plugging up. There's a little bit of parking on the street there, but even if you know the area, there's not a lot of parking uh once you get outside. So um there is uh this is not rel well it is related to the convention, but there's going to be a young people's choir uh 7 o'clock at the church this Friday. Please be there. They really need it's really the only practice they're going to have. So, if all the young people who are in the choir could uh could be here at 7 o'clock on Friday, it'd be greatly appreciated. Parents with toddlers, um I mentioned it last Sunday. Some of you are really good. As soon as a child makes a noise, you leave. Others say, "Well, I can listen. I'm just really pressing in." and you don't realize that your child who may be not crying but is happy and uh but is distracting uh you know everyone all around you because they're very happy and very vocal. So please if your child is vocal uh remove them. Um and you know because if you're taking up a spot or they're sitting on your knee you know it's distracting people. We're going to be really packed in here uh come the convention. So uh we really as much help as possible uh with that. Uh also sisters, if you don't have anyone billeted with you um and are looking for something to do, uh it's uh we would really appreciate if you could make a casserole, bring it here to the church and leave it here uh on it. There'll be tables set up so that people who are building and have, you know, are feeding their guests and driving people back and forth, uh, and are going to be extremely busy, uh, can can maybe have some of that burden, uh, lightened a little bit. Um, Amen. Let's be in prayer. Amen. Looking forward to it. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a wonderful time in the Lord. All that thrills my soul is Jesus.

You're faithful and true, oh God, the mighty God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to your name, Lord. Glory to your name, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. And I'm going to ask brother Tom to come and pray this morning. Open the service in a word of prayer. If you've got a need this morning, you just lift it before our God as we go to prayer. If you're listening in on the internet and you've got a need, you just take it before. Father, as we come before his throne, there's a prayer cloth here. Our brother Glenn Grunard is asking that we pray for his brother Len, who many of us know he's in the uh intensive care unit in Colona. He was in critical condition after a quatting accident. And brother Glenn wants to pray for spiritual and physical healing this morning. But let's unite our hearts this morning. Amen. Hallelujah. Lord, what a grand and glorious privilege it is to stand in your August presence this morning. And Father, something within our hearts cries out, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior. Hear our humble cry. Lord, we are a needy people, needy of a great God to come down, meet us in a supernatural way, and letting the word have its effect within our lives. And so, Lord, we ask that you would come and suck with us this morning. Break the bread of life to us, Lord. And if our eyes are holden, we pray that you'll open them this morning. that our eyes of understanding would be opened up to see your glory, to see your grace, that we might magnify you and lift up that holy name of Jesus Christ this morning. Lord, we can truly say it's amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. So Lord, as we have been preparing and expecting you to come, service after service, and we've been preparing for these meetings that lay ahead, we just pray God that it would be such a refreshing to your people, Lord, as the ministers prepare. We want to prepare our own hearts that you will speak and move. Lord that we would be a different people and the things Lord God of this world would grow so strangely dim in the light of your glory and grace. We ask Lord that you will meet us in a special way and anoint our pastor. Anoint the word. Meet us Lord. We ask in Jesus holy name. And father for this request that brother Lynn Lord is has a need and Glenn has asked that we pray. Lord raise him up. open his eyes. Give him eyes sab to see. Lord, we pray God that you will move supernaturally, that you would not only awaken him, Lord, but God, you would spiritually awaken him to the realities of Christ. And so, Father, we just commit this need to you, may you be glorified. Father, for those that have joined this morning and will join, we just pray that the word would have its deep effect upon every heart and life. And so, Lord, we ask that now you take control of the service, be glorified amongst us, and bless the visitors that are in our midst this morning. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And you may be seated. [Music] I want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning. We're just uh happy to have each and every one of you. And I know that we've got some who are all already starting to come into town before the convention and uh and we're looking forward to a wonderful time of fellowship. Uh special welcome this morning to Sister Jennifer Leonard visiting us from West Virginia. Maybe we get you to stand. Happy to have you here with us. So brothers, sisters, thank you over here. God bless you. It's good to see you. Amen. happy to have you here with us from the south and any others. We just are real happy to have you here with us. Um Sister Melanie Archeletta has a song for us if you'd come, sister. And um maybe as she's come she's coming we can sing uh and we all bow down. Kings will surrender their their crowns. I think it was in D. We'll just sing the verse the uh chorus. And we all bow down. Kings will surrender their crowns and worship Jesus. He is the love unfailing love. He is the love of God and we all bow down. Kings will surrender their crowns and worship Jesus for he is the love unfailing love. He is the love of God. [Music] [Music] I come and bring my praises to the king. [Music] I lay down my life as a sincere offering. You're worthy of all [Music] this mighty presence. I just can't see [Music] you. [Music] Lord, you bring me closer to your throne. Lord, you tell me that I'm your very own. Lord, you move me to worship you alone. [Music] Lord, you draw me.

I step on into my the [Music] perfect But it will still be the world understand [Music] that might be offering me when I up here. Hallelujah. I stepped on into life. Hallelujah. [Music] Good morning. &gt;&gt; Wasn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; And that was uh Brother Ules and uh Sister Patricia Briner's uh two girls in case you didn't know. And uh he has three girls. And you know what that makes Brother Ules? Makes him a real man according to our pastor. And we appreciate him. It's a wonderful uh we appreciate the the church of God and just wanted to come up here and and I have a couple things that I wanted to say. I don't want to be lengthy, but uh I wanted to say brother Mike G's class once again has went on their own kind of and has uh they had donations and within his class of about $100 and the $100 that he has is going toward missions in uh India and he's going to uh they're going to get as many books as they can for India for uh with that $100. And I would just like to open with a little scripture. And the scripture is a well-known scripture. It's actually a scripture that they use a lot of times for dedicating children. And uh it's Mark chapter 10. You don't have to open it, but I'll just read it. And they brought, excuse me, and they brought little children to him that should that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of God. And verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. And uh we just thank the Lord for the little children. It's amazing because the next uh portion of scripture after this is the rich young ruler. And the rich young ruler came to God, you know, and ask him what he must do for eternal life. And uh he didn't come as a little child because a little child is full of obedience and they obey their father. They love their father. I've told my children in my Sunday school class over the years, I said, "How do you prove your love to your parents?" I said, uh, you might tell them you love them day in and day out. I said, 'But when you ask when they ask you to do something and you obey them. I said, 'Th that's how you prove your love to your parents and that's how we prove our love to God. And I just wanted to read uh a couple little things brother Brandham, one of the things Brother Brandham had and uh about children, he said, "Isn't that strange them little boys up not over 10, 12 years old, you say they don't?" Oh yes they do. Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not. For such is the kingdom of God. And their their little hearts hasn't been pulled through too much stuff yet. They're tender and they can't they can easily receive Christ. The spirit knocks and all they know to do is to say yes, Lord. I love those little fellows uh that do that. And I just wanted to uh say something this morning. I love Brother Richard. Have grown to uh to love him as a brother and as a a Sunday school. He's a Sunday school superintendent. He's taught for years and uh he's over in, as you know, he's over in the uh Siberia right now. And he's actually he used his own money. I talked to his wife and used his own money to get over there. He uses vacation time to go over there. And you know the uh as a son of God, we are sheep. And as a sheep, you're a sacrificial animal. And I love to see, you know, uh somebody that uh that puts out and that sacrifices unto God and for this message because it's a wonderful message. But uh I was just thinking about brother Richard a little bit and how brother Brandham says, you know, is a person sired, right? And sired means what father does he have? And I was thinking of brother Charlie Drake. And I don't know how many here knew Charlie Drake or remember brother Charlie Drake. He was a wonderful brother. He was a deacon brother. And uh brother Charlie would uh I remember one time over in the log church. He came up to me, you know, and I'm kind of like a lot of believers. I like to eat. And I was putting on weight. And brother Charlie came up to me and he said, "Brother Ron," he said, "you're kind of putting on some weight, you know. You might want to might want to calm it down, you know. And I said, 'Well, I I appreciate that. And uh the deacon brothers, you know, I I I say that, you know, Cain said, "Am I my brother's keeper?" But a deacon, he says, "I am my brother's keeper." And we're all our brother's keeper, but deacons are real good at that. And I appreciate it. And uh brother brother Gary White, one time I was coming through the sanctu coming into the sanctuary, and brother Gary White says, "Brother Ron, you're making me look skinny." I thought, I'm making Gary look skinny. I gotta calm down a little bit. But I appreciate it, you know. And if you could just take the things even that you think maybe maybe might be a little negative. You might think they're a little negative. But I know uh even if Charlie if I would listen to him earlier, you know, because I I have some health problems now that are caused from eating too much. But uh it's always good to listen to uh to brothers and especially deacons. But uh I was we had the Drake family over years ago and brother Charlie was there and sister Eleanor and we had him over for supper and uh Brother Charlie was just talking to me a little bit and he said, "Brother Ron, you know," he says, "I don't feel like I've done a whole lot for for God, you know, for for the kingdom of God." And I had just read a message and the message said like two days before that how you know how perfect God is. And two days before that I read a message and brother Bram said if you raise your children to love God and to be Christians he said that's all that's expected of you as a father as a parent. And so Charlie's telling me this. I don't feel like I've done a whole lot. And I told him I said brother Charlie I just read a message before you came. And brother Bram said, "If you've raised your children to love God and to be Christians," he said, "that's all that's expected of you." And I said, "You have a son, John Drake. He has been uh our song our sound man for years." In fact, it was no coincidence. John calls me yesterday and he asked me some things because I'm going to be up here. And I asked him, I said, "How long you been doing sound, Brother John?" and he said, "I hate to go back that far, but he said 30 plus years." And I said, "What a blessing." You know, what a what a faithful brother. &gt;&gt; And uh so he's he had John, he had David that was sound and did taping. He had Richard at that time was in the Sunday school department uh teaching. And now he's like I said, he's Sunday school superintendent. But uh I have a couple things. Brother Charlie's gone to his reward. He's fought his good fight, the good fight of faith. And uh I was in the military. I was in the uh the Air Force actually for a little over four years. And it so amazes me because I was in how how uh even how how uh parallel a natural soldier and a and a spiritual soldier are because they put you in basic training. They break you down to where you're nothing. You're absolutely nothing. You know, you can't have your own thoughts, can't have your own way. And then the military builds you back up the way they want you. And God does the same thing. He takes us, he breaks us down to nothing, and then he puts his word back in us so that we'll honor his word and love his word. And it so parallels, you know, just being a soldier. And I was talking to brother Ken Ardal here a while back, and I don't want to keep the children standing very long, but I just had this on my heart. I believe it was from the Lord. But uh the soldier, he was in Iraq, 19 years old. They throw a grenade in his Humvey vehicle and all of a sudden he yells grenade and he jumps on the grenade and pins it to him and ends up taking the blunt end of the of the blast. and uh and the other four wounded a little bit, but three of them go back to Iraq and the other one was uh being nurtured back, but he could have jumped out. He could have jumped out of the Humvey and just left everybody is what they said in the article. But he stayed and he took the end of the blunt. It killed him. And I could think of the the message, you know, in the scripture that says, "No greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." And I'm going to pin this up if you want to read it back on the bulletin board. But uh the other thing I have is a article that I actually brought to my Sunday school class because I teach Sunday school. And the title is vast majority of wounded USGIs go back to Iraq. And I just want to read this one little uh story about this man. His name's Rick Skeus. It says, "Parallel scars run down First Sergeant Rick Sketa's calf. Tell the story how he nearly lost his leg when roadside bomb blew through the door of his armored Humvey. The blast shedded muscle, ligament, tendon, leaving Sketus in a days as medics and fellow soldiers rushed to help him. Sketus remembers little of that day last November, except someone warning him that when he woke up, his foot might be gone. And after five months and six surgeries, the foot remains intact, but causes Sketus haunting numbness and searing pain caused by nerve damage. Skas 36 of Sullivan, Illinois, fought through the surgeries and therapy to return in April to Iraq, conducting the same type of patrols that nearly killed him. But the vast majority have remained in Iraq or returned later, their bodies marked by scars and their lives plagued by aches and pains. I wear my scars proudly, said Skus as he gingerly lifted up his pant leg to show his railroadike track where doctors had made incisions to save his foot. Why didn't he stay home? He felt guilty. Because I wasn't sharing the same hardship uh that they were, Ska said shily while another soldier nodded at his side. For some soldiers in Iraq, it was a road roadside blast that muffled their hearing and peppered their body and shrapnel. Others have been ripped by gunfire, sometimes leaving them with jabbing pains in their limbs and compromised movement. Their wounds are often similar, but there are many reasons for remaining at war when their wounds are a ticket home. Some can't imagine any other job than being a soldier. Some know no other life. Others like Sketus feel the guilt, an obligation to their fellow soldiers. Many of the injured soldiers have begged their commanders to let them come back. One soldier was sent home after a bomb exploded in his face and damaged his eyes. He likely will never return to Iraq, but he still asked. Another was sent home because he had heart condition and returned to Iraq three times according to Lieutenant Colonel uh Cud, a commander of the 502 second uh infantry regiment. Uh Kunk is a doctor decides every week which wounded soldiers can return to duty. Often soldiers return research regulations and argue endlessly. He said it's heartbreaking when he has to say no. And I just wanted to say this morning that we are soldiers of God and that many many wounds, you know, many roadside blasts. You don't even know where they come from. That's that's hit a lot of soldiers. They don't even know. All a sudden they blast and and it takes them out for a while. But uh we're all soldiers. And I was thinking of uh when a soldier is wounded in battle, they give him the president of the United States gives him a purple heart and that purple heart indicates that he is a wounded soldier. And uh I just want to say we're all we've all been wounded one way or another. And brother Red, you know, if I was to pass out purple hearts being wounded in battle, I mean, I'm sure he would have purple hearts all over his chest. And I just want to say that uh that we love you. We thank God. My key, and I've told my children this, my Sunday school class as a Christian growing up, I grew up in Pentecost, came into the message and love the message. But you know, the key to a Christian walk is never never giving up. &gt;&gt; No matter what has happened, no matter what uh problems we've had or how many battles, because brother Ron has lost battles and I've won battles. But all in all, I tell my children, my wife says if I die tomorrow, she said the one thing she would remember is that I've told them never never quit. Never give up. And uh because one thing you have to fight for freedom and I was talking to a man a couple months ago, he was anti- Bush, anti-war, you know, anti- everything. He had protested everything. And he he told me about it. I said I said my father fought over in Germany and he was wounded and I said if they didn't fight over in Germany for freedom and I'm thinking spiritually now you fight for freedom and if we didn't fight for freedom I said we would be we might be speaking German or we might be speaking Japanese. I said those men fought for our freedom and the same thing as us. We fight for our freedom and I appreciate every one of you. I know you all have purple hearts on you. You've all been wounded. I look through the congregation and I just see him. I've been with you a long time myself. I'm sure I'd have a lot of purple hearts, but I thank the Lord for keeping us and being with us. And wonderful God. I appreciate my shepherd. You know, always been a wonderful shepherd of God. He uh I tell my mom I grew up with a lot of hierlings, but it's nice to have a shepherd, someone that cares for your soul. &gt;&gt; And we just appreciate Brother Ed. Maybe you could come up. And I didn't mean to be very long, but I just had something on my heart that I wanted to say. And we love each and every one of you. And maybe we can bring the monies up here to carry that. might open this. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, brother Ron, for those fine words and especially enjoyed the words about brother Richard who's away in Siberia and the comments from his heritage from his father. That's really wonderful. Sunday school missionary offering. The children of Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School wish to present their missionary offering for the year 2007. The offering is $1,020.70 Canadian and $45 US for a combined total of $1,425.70. And this year's offering has been dedicated to help complete the translation and printing of the Sunday school manual started last year to guide the development of Sunday school Sunday schools for children of saints around the world. Brother Richard Drake, Cloverdale Bible Way, Sunday school superintendent. And thank you. God bless you. Thank you, brother Ron. Appreciate that. God bless you. Amen. Well, do we is that it? Are they going to sing another song? No. Thank you, children. God bless you. We love you. Amen. Isn't that uh it's just something so special and fresh when you see children? I think it's marvelous. And I think it would be appropriate for me to say just now that uh the Bible way Christian Academy, the school has uh their year-end book and I don't know even how many of them they make. They gave me one and I read through it all last evening. I and I was done studying and getting ready for shutdown the evening. I I picked this up. Uh unfortunately, if you pick it up, be prepared to go through it because you won't want to stop. That's for sure. And we had a just a little uh they had a a gathering for the uh seventh grade going into into junior high. and uh had a a graduation ceremony and we went there and then brother and sister Douly really appreciate them. They had a dinner for the teachers and uh brother Randy Timberman, the principal and and the school school board. And I uh I wasn't going to go because I thought my time was too pressed to be ready for this morning. But as I thought about it, I felt very very pressed to go. And uh I listened to brother Randy uh Timberman speak as principal to the uh parents and to the grads. There was eight or nine of them. Uh and I was very very impressed. I want to say to the congregation, I was not only impressed, I was moved because as brother Randy spoke to the grads, I found that he spoke uh far more in in far more depth than a principle having chosen some appropriate comments to children. and he began and he he he actually took a a direction that would be a a ministerial direction, something that a minister would take. And he said he was looking over the uh previous years and the pictures of years of students from previous years. And uh as he observed some of the pictures, he just said, "I don't see that one anymore. I don't see this one. And he began to feel affected by those that weren't there. And then he spoke to those that were graduating going into junior high school from a far more than just a principal of a school. But now he was taking a spiritual direction. You want to be sure and be there. You don't want to turn up missing. You want to follow through for God. And I thought that was marvelous. And I just said, "Thank God we have that kind of principle and these kind of teachers that take these young tender lives." And then brother Tom said made some comments and I thought they were so powerful also. He took I believe a quote where brother Brandham spoke about the children are our very heart and just spoke to the teachers for a moment and said you have our hearts and they have them for more hours in the day than most parents have their children. And I I say to this congregation, we want to be very thankful we have Holy Ghost teachers that can take these tender plants that we call our children. Yes, sure. Our our children, but every one of these children speaking and singing about a theophony, their theophony is the same size as yours. &gt;&gt; Not one bit different. And we want to be conscious of that. And to think that their lives can be spared such a an enormous amount of wounds and hurts. I I'm I'm ever thankful to God and it's just not so little comments about the school, but uh also I want to we've discussed this and I might as well make the announcement now. Uh, I I'd like the congregation to be mindful when you're at the offering blocks and see what God is doing through the young through the school and our children at the school and just ask God if he would have you do something for the school on a continual basis from week to week. We've got some parents, some are single parents, some parents are have a difficult time financially. And we I do not want to see a single child that ought to be in the school that the parents would like to have in the school that are unable to be there simply because they're not able to pay the tuition. And I think that as a congregation this size, we can certainly certainly make that little bit up. And so when when you're there and you're placing your tithes and offerings, just ask God, do you want me to just do something a little extra? Or perhaps God has dropped something extra in your in your pocket and blessed you in a special way. It would be nice just to do something for a child. Maybe they'll never know where it came from, but God knows where it came from. Can you say amen? We don't take offerings uh very often here in the church, but I want to ask you to do that when you're on a continual basis. Just make a habit out of it. And uh uh we're we're going to be able to do something for the school. So, God bless you in this regard. Uh we will be taking offerings during the convention and already some of the ministers are beginning to arrive. Brother uh Nikolai Steanenko from Lithuania arrived with uh brother Anton and they brother Tony delivered them to the airport yesterday. They've gone up to Edmonton for the week and then they will be coming back for the beginning of the convention. I believe a a brother from Fiji arrived. There are several arriving from uh where's our brother from Fiji? Have we welcomed him? Yeah. Please stand. God bless you. Amen. And uh I think brother Steven Kemper is going to the airport or probably already has gone. They're picking up several coming from Brazil. And I think there's there's close to about 90 ministers that are coming from uh I've counted at least 22 nations that they're that's going to be represented. And I really think that's wonderful. I'm just I'm very very excited about what God wants to do. I want you to be much in prayer if you would. I hope you're not uh too weary, but I just want to uh make sure that you hold the meetings up in prayer and the the those that will be participating. We've got quite a number that are going to be preaching. I pray the Holy Spirit come down, permeate the air, the atmosphere, and just fill us. Another. How many more would like a filling? I do. Just want to be completely filled and thoroughly charged with the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. I'm in great expectation. Uh I just want to make one more uh comment and before we go to the word and and uh we've started to send out or brother John Stall has started to send out some of the videos that were made of uh brother uh brother John's not his testimony but what he had on his heart to say to the people in the colonies and whoever might receive this uh he received a phone call last night and it's from a man in a colony yet that that also was a teacher as brother John Stall was a teacher and this man said I have received the DVD and I I have listened to it. He didn't hear it all the way through, but he had listened to about half of it, the first half of it. And he said, "I am very impressed." He said, "The sermons that we read, I have the sermons that we read here, as you say, they're just mere history." And he said, "This message that you speak of," he said, must be the prelude to the rapture. Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; That's in absolutely incredible. And uh and and he said he said it it's he speaks about where they are and the and the colony life and what they've believed. And he said it's it's it's made a 180% turn from 180 degree turn from what it supposed to be. And he's even been speaking about leaving the colony and speaking to his wife. And I, as I said, you remember I said, "Even if one, even if one, how much is one worth?" 10,000 worlds. And we spend an evening and do a little bit of video work. I say, "Glory be to God." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we want to pray as these go out and are sent out. and we really uh feel led to do so. Let's stand and let's sing a chorus. Let's sing. I'm a uh I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Old things have passed away. Hallelujah. Was there anything else, Brother Rod? Okay. [Music] All things are passed away. I've been born again. More again. More than a coner. That's what I am. I'm a new creation. I'm a new man. Let's sing it once again. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Old things are passed away. I was born again. That's what I am. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just get made so happy. Look down here and see brother and sister Stany and my goodness, how wonderful. God bless them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just ask the Lord's blessing on the word now and we're going to turn to it. Heavenly Father, you have made a provided way for us through your lamb, God's lamb. It is your lamb that was inspected and he was found perfect. It was your lamb that died and rose again and said, "Because I live, you shall live also." How we thank you for the life that you have given us. For the word that you have sent, for the spirit of revelation that you have poured out freely upon us. And I pray this morning, Lord, you will cause our hearts to just tingle with excitement and with expectation. We do not know what you will do here yet this morning, oh God. And throughout this day, I pray you'll bless this congregation, oh father, as we have worshiped you. And now we worship you in the hearing of your word. Anoint hearer and speaker. I pray for your glory. Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Would you turn in your Bibles, please, to Acts the 14th chapter. And it came to pass, this is verse one, in Iconium, that they went both together, now this is Paul and Barnabas, into the synagogue of the Jews. And so spake that a great number both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. And the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. But the multitude of the city was divided, and part held with the Jews, and part held with the apostles. And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and also of the Jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them, they were aware of it and fled to Lististra and Derby, cities of Lyonia, and unto the region that lith round about. And there they preached the gospel. And there sat a certain man at Lististra, impotent in his feet, being a from his mother's womb, who had never walked, never had walked. The same heard Paul speak and stead who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on thy feet." And he leaped and walked. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of the Lyonia, "The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men." And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people, which when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the peoples, crying out, and saying, Sir, why do ye these things? We are also, we also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, uh, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that that are therein, who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Notice the 17th verse, our last verse. Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. God bless you as you have your seats. I'd appreciate your kind attention as we approach the word. We've been a little lengthy with our preliminaries, but we just one service today and uh uh we want it to be a real blessing to you. Paul said, "Nevertheless, he left not himself without a witness." I want to speak to you, the convention is going to be the theme is witness 2007. And uh I want to speak to you today even though I had not anticipated doing so. I wanted to leave this until sometime in the convention, but I will be speaking to you Lord willing now on we are true witnesses. You are we are and this is a declaration I'm making. We are true witnesses. Paul said God has nevertheless he he left not himself without witness. God has never never left himself without a true witness in the earth. A witness. All of us are familiar with some aspect of being a witness. Probably many of you have signed a document that you are a witness to someone else's signature. And what you're saying is I I witnessed I saw this person sign this document and I'm prepared to be called on by anyone and I will be able to tell them that I I witness a signature. We understand also that a witness is someone who has either seen something happen. They have heard with their own ears or they have had personal involvement and they are personally acquainted with the event that took place that is a witness. Brother Brandham in the message at thy word he uh quoted the scripture that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold which perisheth which is first Peter 1 and7. Then he said think of it might have let you get sick. In other words, God might let you get sick in order that you might be a testimony. He might let you get sick so that you can be a testimony. And a testimony is the same thing as being a witness. The same word is used in the scripture for both both of those uh for for both testimony and witness. And that he might heal you that you can stand on his word. See, that's what God wants. He'll heal you that you can stand on his word. Then when you reach the opposition and you will reach the opposition, you will be able to say, you can say, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, you are witnesses to me in Jerusalem, Jesus said, and in Juda, Judea, Samaria. A witness is somebody who's really done something, been somewhere, and seen something. That's a witness. I've been there. I've done something. I've heard something. I've seen something. I know what it is because I was there. I was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; I ought to know. &gt;&gt; Some people come with a wonderful a wonderful argument. I had people at the door of of one of the religions that like to come and knocking on your door and going to going to tell you some things. And so they were going to prove to me there was no such a thing as uh the Holy Spirit. And I said, "Well, I'm sorry. You know, you're just a little bit late. You've got a probably a very good argument, but I happen to have an experience." And I said, "Your argument is no competition for my experience. So I'm sure this is the end of the conversation." Hallelujah. It's wonderful to experience it. &gt;&gt; So I was there. It happened to me. I've already experienced it. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful change. And our life has been rot since Jesus came in. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, a witness has to be a witness, eyewitness to know what they're speaking of. It can't be secondarily. If you go down here at the courthouse and say, "I seen a wreck on the streets." and you look at it through a window glass. You could not be a witness. Got to be right there personally. You can't double see things. You've got to be a a correct witness. One of the most important parts of of a any court case that we have, you have a court case and they call witnesses and they always allow the opposing whether it be the defense or the prosecuting attorneys. They allow them the opportunity to cross-examine the witness and say they are gifted to try and tangle you up and to ask the question from this direction and from that direction just to find out if you really know what you're talking about. And so often in the cross-examine they get the person's mind clouded and they can't remember exactly. They say, "Well, this is what you said in the hearing, but now you're saying something slightly different. you said you remembered there, but now you say you can't exactly remember. Do you really know it? And they come on strong and and get the person all flustered and then they try to destroy their evidence. And so the the crossexamination is such an important part because they try to destroy the evidence. When Satan comes to you and tries to crossexamine you about what you have experienced about what you heard, you must know where you're standing. You must be able to say, "I was there, Satan. God has already done it. I've experienced it." And furthermore, he knows very well it happened. &gt;&gt; Something I like to rub in the in the devil's face is this. My master said you are a liar and the truth is not in you. And so I conclude you can't say anything that's truthful. If you say I don't have it for certain I have it. &gt;&gt; And that's a very good position to take. Put him on the stand. Say, "What do you know about this? You don't know anything about truth. You were a liar in the beginning, weren't you? My book says you were. My Lord said you were. God said you were. And God is truth. You are a liar in the beginning. You're Furthermore, you're a murderer. You're the first one to take life. God gave life. You're a murderer. &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have on in these countries something that you may have heard of and I'm sure you're acquainted with, but we have in our countries what is known as a witness protection program where key witnesses of very very uh serious crimes or the mafia and some of these high drug dealers and whatever more and someone who's been on inside they have they have intimate knowledge of how this thing is operating and they know who is involved and then they say they'll well they say we have a the US Marshalss department has a a protection program in most these western countries where a witness protection program and the government goes to great lengths great lengths perhaps further than you realize to protect the witness witness because they want to encourage the witness to be able to say everything. And in there, I was actually into the documents to see what they would do for a a witness that's willing to tell all. They will create a complete new identity for that person. They will move that individual. They've said that there's hundreds and hundreds of cities that they would choose to move the individual. and give him a complete new identity. And in giving them an identity, that witness must choose to forget some of his associations and promise never never to make any contact with that association again. They even have to select who in their family that they want to be brought into the protection program. And those that are not that are not identified by the witness to come into the protection program, that witness must say and promise and vow that he'll never make contact with those even those of the family or distant family or extended family because he must and absolutely live a new life. And it's called falling off the end of the world, falling off the end of the earth. And they they they call it falling off the face of the earth was the exact words in fact and living a new life. And here I'm going to just give a little brief quote. They said that the witness security program is designed to create a total total anonymity for witnesses and help them blend into a new city where they most likely won't be recognized. The United States has thousands of cities in which to hide a protected witness. The Marshall Service is tasked with creating a new identity and finding a new city for the witness, his family, and any endangered associates. And this requires the coordination of multiple government agencies and good timing and total secrecy. They have said further just making two single quotes. Perhaps the riskiest part of the process is when the witness returns to testify. They have them so guarded and they have their heads all covered so you can only see their eyes and that's the riskiest part and they always have a group of marshals around with weapons and so on in these important testimony that these people are going to give. And then they say, "While witnesses are given a fresh start in a new community, their past transgressions are not completely ignored." And as I read that, I thought, how different the world is &gt;&gt; to God's witnesses. &gt;&gt; God said, "And you shall be witnesses." And he didn't tell them, "We're going to hide you in another city. We're going to sneak you off. You're going to say you're going to start right in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll spread out to Judea and out into Samaria and you'll be right out. And furthermore, your past transgressions shall be entirely forgotten. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not going to have to come back and and have some penalty for some of your past transgressions. It's certainly far different than what your government or my government suggests as a as a protection program. We haven't merely got a protection program. God gave us a new identity. &gt;&gt; Such a new identity. Hallelujah. The world doesn't know the old man. They maybe have some past memory of but you're so different &gt;&gt; as a believer. The message you're so different from the inside out, so transformed, more changed than you even realize. The last words of Jesus as he was departing into heaven, the last words that he spoke are these. But you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses. We don't want to just say you shall be witnesses, but I'd like this congregation to be able to say with an a and a an affirmation within your own soul. We are witnesses. &gt;&gt; I'd like this congregation to say those words with me. We are witnesses. I want to add a word. We are true witnesses. &gt;&gt; I'll prove it to you. I'll prove it to you by the scripture. You sitting here today having heard and been birthed by the message. The message of this hour, the message that came with great great cost. This message, God is not looking upon this message as lightly. This is not just another doctrine. This is a vindicated message where God came on the scene night after night, week after week, month after month, year after year and told people the secret of their heart. I you am a are a witness of that happening. &gt;&gt; It happened. We've heard the voice. I've heard it. &gt;&gt; Many people haven't heard it. You've heard it. &gt;&gt; You've heard the tape. You've heard it however it came to you. You have absolute evidence. I am a witness to that. &gt;&gt; That's the theme of my service today, friend. You might as well get on board. &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. &gt;&gt; How do you know? I heard it. &gt;&gt; Did your priest say it? No. Did your rabbi say it? No. Did the pope say it? No. He knows nothing about this. Does the ba mayor say it? No. Does the bishop or the overseer say it? No. They've never had it. &gt;&gt; But I have heard it. &gt;&gt; I've heard it over and over again. I've heard it till it can almost become commonplace. But God help us, that'll never become common place. When you hear that, you are hearing the fulfillment of Hebrews 4 and12, the word coming and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart. You have heard it &gt;&gt; and you are a witness. &gt;&gt; Satan would dearly love to discredit your testimony. Don't let your testimony die. Don't let your testimony be silent. Don't let you say, "Well, I know something, but I'm not going to say anything about it." Say, "I know something. I've been there. I've heard it. I've been birthed under this word. And you shall receive power. You shall be witnesses unto me. Something had to take place because a living Christ was among his people in the message. Who is this? Oh, I love the way the prophet put titles. Who is this? Then he came to the end of the service and started calling a woman out. Your name is Miss Belchure. Your name is something else. Who did this? He's asking the question. It's the title of the whole message. Who is this? &gt;&gt; William Brandham from Jefferson, Billandanda, Indiana. Not a chance. Who is this? None other than God himself coming forward and fulfilling Hebrews 4 and12. a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Hallelujah. And you're a witness to that. &gt;&gt; If you're just a witness and say, "Well, God sent some God sent some kind of a gift. It's just some gift we've received and it's passed by and now it's history." You're a false testimony. &gt;&gt; That's a false witness. This is the living word of God that never dies. That word is just alive tonight as it was back then. We've experienced it. We know what we speak of. And in this message, he said something had to take place because the living Christ was amongst the living people. The coming of the Holy Ghost. Here's a point I want to make now. The coming of the Holy Ghost in this last day. this congregation, those on the internet, those that are streaming. I want to stress that the coming of the Holy Ghost in this last day. Well, you say, "Well, he came back in Pentecost. He came back on the day of Pentecost." True. They experienced that. And they were able to go out from that place, able to go out onto the streets and live a life and travel with their ministry, whatever it was as Paul and Barnabas were doing, and give testimony that we have seen it. &gt;&gt; We've heard it and we're a part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God's looking for right now. This is not something This is not just a church service. This isn't just a some doctrine we believe. This is something my I've received a life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Transforming power has taken over in my soul. I'm not the same person I used to be. &gt;&gt; And he said that the coming of the Holy Ghost in this last days has caused somewhat in a like manner stir amongst the people of the coming of the Holy Ghost. He said again, in this last days has sent forth a revival. The coming of the Holy Ghost in these last days has sent forth a revival. A people that's called out. Separated people. I say a people that's called out. The congregation says amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A separated people. We say amen. &gt;&gt; A people that's free in their religion. And we say amen. that shouts and screams and praises God, that believes in signs and wonders. We're a free people. &gt;&gt; Not just an emotional people. We're a free people. We have emotion because we're free. &gt;&gt; We're a free people. &gt;&gt; We're witnesses of the greatest thing that God has done since man was created. There's no record in the scripture of anything like you have witnessed that you've been born under. There's no record of it from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've been birthed under it. We're identified with it. &gt;&gt; And that's important. What you're identified with, your identification. you that have different passports and from different countries, you hold that. That's your ident your ID. You have to show it all the time. And more so in this day that we have in at any time and you go through the border, you can't just show a picture of yourself. They want your ID. They want to know who you're connected with and what nation you're connected with. You may be American, you may be Canadian, British, whatever, German, whatever more. But when you go across the border, even though you show who you're identified with, you perhaps don't have some great surge of of pride or some great surge of and feeling filled, you know, with ecstasy simply because you got ID. When we're identified with this message, we're not always on cloud9 and having some great glamorous thing happening. It's not that way. You're just identified with something. But when you need it, it works. &gt;&gt; I'm identified with this and it works. And when you become to be cross-examined, say, "Who are you identified with?" I got a passport. You can look at it as long as you want, but it'll never change. That's my picture and that's my identification. That's where I was born. And I can say the same thing spiritually. This is where I was born. This is the message I was born under. This is my citizenship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have a new identity. I've been given new ID papers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got a passport right here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "The same thing as it was is now." I love statements like that. The same thing that was, it is now, &gt;&gt; nothing has changed. The same Holy Spirit, the same one. And we're talking about the witness. Now listen closely. The same now that was is now. The spirit of the living God lives in them. And that's why they cry out. &gt;&gt; You cry out. That's why they cry out. &gt;&gt; That's why they can't hold their peace. &gt;&gt; That's why you get to testifying to somebody and you just can't shut your mouth &gt;&gt; because you got something that you know is real. &gt;&gt; You know that they need it. &gt;&gt; You know the world hasn't got it and you know their church can't give it to them. &gt;&gt; If it could, it would have. The church is after members. The church is after money. The church is after all kinds of programs. We're not interested in that. We're interested in this new life. We are a witnesses and we can say we are witnesses of these things. &gt;&gt; And the religious world looks on. Do they ever? &gt;&gt; The religious world looks on. Listen friends, I'm not here to hype you up. I don't need to hype myself up. I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground right now. I've been feeling I just yesterday I just said to myself, I just can't wait to get to that pullpit. Just can't wait to tell the congregation and join with them, we are witnesses of these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't care who would try to cross-examine. We can take the serpent seeds through the scripture. We can take it until they're absolutely silenced by the word of God, the godhead and the baptism. And as the prophet said, when the when the scripture says baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, he said that's the way we do it. Aren't you glad you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? You're a witness &gt;&gt; that that's the truth. And God has testified that you are a witness to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You talk a witness protection program. How God has protected our testimony. How Satan would like to bring such division amongst the people of God. How he's protected this congregation and protected you as as families. Give praise to God. &gt;&gt; You know that you've come under a special protection. Satan would like to torn you to to shreds. He'd like to tore your family to shreds. He'd like to cause you divorce and all kinds of things. But God, my testimony. Hallelujah. God is our witness. The Holy Spirit has witnessed amongst us that we are his witnesses, true witnesses. &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't allow it to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wouldn't allow it to happen. Satan came in like a flood. But God raised up a standard against him. &gt;&gt; Standard of the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How great is this God? &gt;&gt; I give witness to him today. I give true testimony to him today. I'm so thankful we can be as a congregation a witness to this message. &gt;&gt; What an honor it is. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "What's the matter with the them people? Who is this? What causes this?" Or, or may I might say, "What is this? What is this that causes that?" If you could only read the scriptures, they'd find out that it's the spirit of Christ promised by God that in the last days, I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there will be a latter rain, a rain of the spirit of God falling upon the people in the last day. I give witness today that I've been the recipient of such an outpouring. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to my God. The stimulation of the revelation will do the same thing. Said in the fourth seal and the new wine when it brings revelation, then it's revealed. And that's the way it was at Pentecost, the new wine. When something was revealed, it brought a revelation. That's what happened at Pentecost. You a lot of people talk about say, "Well, we're Pentecostal." They don't have a clue what happened at Pentecost. At Pentecost, they spoke different languages. Came out on the street. How here we every man in our own tongue. In our own tongue. Are you with me? He said they knew that they were supposed to be a a supposed to be a spirit poured out upon them and they waited till this happened. And when the vindication of the revelation when the vindication of the revelation took place, then stimulation was on them. When the vindication, when the proof, when the evidence of the revelation took place, then stimulation was on them. Right out into the streets where they were afraid and had the door shut. And where they would go, the where they were out in the street, he said where they'd been afraid as a group of people preaching the gospel to them, something had happened because the true word of promise was vindicated. Now, let's stop here. Just stops. He wants the people saying this is what happened at Pentecost. The proof, the evidence that God had come and inhabited men and women was there. &gt;&gt; They were afraid. Now they're bold where they were hiding behind bars and locked doors. They were busting out into the streets now because something had happened to them. And he said, "Now let's stop here." He said, "If that brought such a positive to them, to them men that they nearly every one of them sealed their testimony with their blood, no matter what come along, as long as they lived, they never got over it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I read that. I said, "It's been 30ome years, almost 40 years since I come to the knowledge of this message." What a rest. &gt;&gt; What a peace. I have not go sniffing around looking for something else. Fact is when I look around I can scarcely scarcely take in what I'm seeing. I say poor people that's what they've got for religion. If it be in a newspaper or an ad or in a magazine or on a television and I see what's supposed to be religion of the poor people. I feel such a compassion for them. It seems like they're caught in some kind of a web. And here we are just in a glory cloud. Oh hallelujah. This week, last week, this month, last month, this year, last year. And Satan has been Satan tried to buff it. And God has just sent him away. &gt;&gt; He's been defeated. I say, young men, young women, Brother Ed has walked this road a long time, and there is no way like this glorious way. There's no word like this glorious word. I've proven it and I can tell you it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You surely don't mind if I get excited and enthused about that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It brought such a positive to those men and he says as long as they live they could never go get over it. It stayed there because it was the word of promise vindicated. It stayed there because it was the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; At that time, Peter could stand up and say, "This is that which was spoken of by Joel the prophet. In the last days, Seth God, I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy." Said, "This is that." &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying, "As it was then, so is it now." We're not trying to repeat that back there. But the principle is that God came down. His word was fulfilled. And when they saw the fulfillment of the word, they saw and was vindicated that that word was now being fulfilled. A new life entered them. &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened. &gt;&gt; If you come here and say, "Well, we've just heard some new doctrines and it it seems to make sense." That's not it. It is that when you realize that God who spoke the word, God who gave the prophecy, that that prophecy now has come in line with the timeline. It's right in the season. We're in the zone. And that word just explodes with life. And when that word is in you, you have an explosion also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going take my coat off and preach. [Applause] whereof we are all witnesses. And he says, "Now look at the promise of the last days." He said, "Let's stop here." Now he's coming. Let's look at the promise of the last days. Your promise, your time. And here we see it vindicated right before us. The present coming of the Holy Spirit. He's saying it again. the present coming of the Holy Spirit. Friends, we are witnesses &gt;&gt; to the coming of the Holy Spirit, not back 2,000 years ago. Some might say, "Well, he's been here all the time. So has God been here all the time. So has Christ been here all the time. God can't go anywhere. He fills all time and space, but he can make himself known or hide himself. But he has come and made himself known. He has stepped forward in this generation. He's come out of the shadows. He's come out of the scriptures. He said, "This has been a prophecy. It's been waiting. I've been waiting on it, but the season is here and the people are here and my messenger is here." And he steps out of the shadows here and the bridegroom says, "Here I am, bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here I am. I was a mystery back there just a few years ago, but it's not a mystery anymore. I'm revealing myself &gt;&gt; in the word. &gt;&gt; And the people saw the word. They saw the scriptures. It didn't just say, "Oh, this sounds new. This sounds different." Even though it was different and is different, but there was a life in the word. And it begin to begin to take a hold of our soul. Now, not emotional realm so much, but the soul realm. And then from that, of course, we get enthused about it. And he said the present coming of the Holy Spirit and the works that he was supposed to do. And we find it right here among us. The works that he was supposed to do. I'm identified with the message today. There's no place in the scripture that says I have to do what the prophet did. But it's true in the scripture that you need to believe what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; That is true. You need to be identified with what he spoke. And if you believe it, it will come into the inner region. If you're a son and daughter of God, it will transform you. This is a this is a powerhouse, friends. &gt;&gt; It's a life. &gt;&gt; Whereof we are all witnesses. I'm a witness today of this vindication. &gt;&gt; To me, it wasn't a man with a gift. To me, it was God who stepped on the scene. Sometimes in a platform, sometimes in the tent, sometimes in a house, and maybe sometimes just being interview, but God himself vindicated this message. God proved it, and he sent the Holy Spirit. So, the Holy Spirit himself is a witness. The scripture says we have this witness within ourselves. The Holy Spirit is a witness. What does the witness say? What does that witness say? Holy Ghost, what do you say? &gt;&gt; I can only speak the truth. &gt;&gt; And when he that spirit of truth has come, he will not speak of himself. I cannot speak of myself. I can only speak of he who came. I can only speak of Christ, the anointed word. And so I can tell you that this word that the people have been waiting on, I the Holy Ghost can give witness today that that scripture has now come into fulfillment. I the Holy Ghost can say that Malachi 4 has already been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; We don't care how many people are waiting for it. It's fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It's happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And your soul says, "I believe that with all my heart and soul. I believe that the life of that word comes into you." &gt;&gt; You can't describe it any more than you can describe how your breakfast came into your system today and gives you strength. Now you can't explain that to me and I can't explain how I read a certain scripture and the life comes into me not an enthusiasm, not merely an inspiration, a life. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me friends? A life &gt;&gt; filter comes in to saturate my entire being, your entire body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're in a wonderful, wonderful witness protection program. &gt;&gt; We go to new cities. &gt;&gt; Don't we, brother Tony? Don't we, brother Ernie? We go to new cities &gt;&gt; where we never been before. &gt;&gt; Can't hide it. &gt;&gt; Can't hide this vindication. We're witnesses. &gt;&gt; Something's happened. &gt;&gt; Your city needs to hear it. &gt;&gt; Your town needs to hear it. &gt;&gt; We have a new identity. Absolute new identity. You can't even Well, I've had I have people There's people right here. if they came up and told you the kind of people they used to be. I've had people of the world standing there and brothers who've been saved and delivered and birthed by this word try to tell them what kind of person they used to be. They say, "Ah, you never took drugs. You know nothing about that." You talk about being washed. &gt;&gt; You talk about being changed. We're new creatures in Christ Jesus. Indeed, in Christ Jesus is not some figment of imagination. We're new creatures in the word. That Jesus Christ is the word made flesh and he's still flesh &gt;&gt; in our flesh. &gt;&gt; We have a new name. &gt;&gt; I've been given a new name. You have a new name. &gt;&gt; The government tries to give the people a new name. But that one might fail. But this will never fail. &gt;&gt; We're indeed a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the witnesses of Jesus Christ have their past transgressions completely ignored. &gt;&gt; They'll never come back to haunt you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about some something going to come up uh you know that God is going to come and lay his finger on something and damn you for it. In fact, here's what he told you. It's forgiven. One one woman there was a sister and she was talking to my wife and God gave my wife such wisdom at that moment and this woman was relating her past and saying you know telling all the sorted details of her past and wife said to her you know God doesn't know anything about that. What do you mean God doesn't God knows everything? Well, he doesn't know things he forgot. &gt;&gt; He's forgotten that. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he doesn't have the ability to even remember it. &gt;&gt; I thought God could do all things. Well, there's something he doesn't do. He can't do because he's decreed that he can't do it. I'm not saying this to recommend it, but it's a brother here in the church and he took a very very high security position with a company that packs cash around. You know, it's like Brinks or what are some of those other companies? You know, they haul hundreds of thousands of dollars around. They need people with just impeccable backgrounds. So some months later, I got the brother and I said, "What are you doing? You know, you just deliver envelopes and, you know, stocks and things." Oh, no, no, no. He says, "You know, in an armored car." "Oh, are you?" I said, "Well, I happen to know that those people have to go through an absolute critical, exhaustive study of their past and every last thing." I didn't know anything about this brother's past, but I doubted really whether it was whether it would actually qualify for this kind of position. So, I said, "Did did you how did you do with the questionnaire?" Well, fine. He said, "If God can't remember it, I sure can't." So I said, "Well, okay. It worked." God couldn't remember it. He sure couldn't remember it. Wasn't bad. You got a good job. Held it for years. Gone on to better things. &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you. I don't go and say, "Brother Ed told you to do that." That was his conviction. Now, now I just want to hear this have this courtroom because brother Brandham, Brother Brandham called the world to court and he made the whole world a courtroom in the future home. He said the first step and that's what he's talking to us about. And it seems so fundamental to us. But let us just take it through because he I've heard about justification. I've heard about sanctification. I've heard about the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I heard about it ever since a young child. But never heard about it the way the prophet said it. And when I received it the way he said it, then I received that. I experienced that. And we are witnesses today of the kind of justification said the first step is repentance towards God. And then follows after that is water. baptism. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine or that you remit your past sins. Now he said that has nothing to do with future sin. It only it only remits. Now remember, don't just don't build a whole doctrine on that. He says it has nothing to do with future sin. It only remits. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. What for? for the remission taking away of past sin. And he says again has nothing to do with the future. He said you you can't repent for what Adam did. You never did it. Adam did. You just get forgiveness for what you have done. And the old nature is still there. He said, and then he goes to a board. Let me take this board. And he draws a three circles. Then he goes to sanctification. Sanctification. in the second stage of it cleanses the mind and sets the heart sets the heart the mind of the mind of the heart in order for holiness. A man can repent of sin and he's still thinking of it. Well, maybe he's an immoral man, even immoral looking women he finds and it's still there. Maybe he's a drunkard and every time he smells a drink, it's still there. But then when he gets sanctified, that cleanses the desire out of him. So now the process is moving forward. Listen. And it takes the want of it away. Under sanctification, it takes the want of it away. He said he can still be tempted, but he takes the want of it away. Still, he's not right yet. But then he's baptized with the Holy Ghost on fire, cleansed, burned out, cleaned up, and then put into service. But before before God can come down in the presence in the person rather, of the Holy Ghost, which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart, it first must be repented. It's going back over it. It must be baptized in water in the name of Jesus. In the name to show who it belongs to. Then secondly, it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. And finally then and and then the holy fire and the Holy Ghost from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin, all the nature of the world. And the Bible said it's impossible for a man that's been been born of God. He cannot sin. He does not sin. There's no way for him to sin. Listen now. He's come down to the full the full repentance, justification, and sanctification, and the baptism of Holy Spirit. He says, "How can he be a sinner and redeemed at the same time?" He's posing a question. How can he be that both at the same time? How can I be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop at the same time? You can't be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop. You can't be, you know, redeemed and still not redeemed. He says, "Oh, he redeemed us by his blood by his spirit. He cleansed us and then comes to dwell in us." The church, not the denomination, now the church. The scripture says this, "For by one offering," Paul said in Hebrews 10:14, "For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified." And you should get that that he has perfected forever. And the scripture says, "He that is born of God cannot sin because the seed remainth in him." the seed, the word, the token remainth in him &gt;&gt; and God looks on that. When you do something wrong, you transgress or you or you sin that as far as you're concerned and then you if you're a son or daughter of God, you'll repent quickly. That's what he said. You'll repent right away. Quickly. Doesn't have to go on and on and on. You just make it right. The Holy Spirit speaks to you. You make it right quickly. But if you're a son of God, that's the reaction. &gt;&gt; He hath perfected forever and perfected he has completed it forever them that are sanctified. And then in the 16th verse says, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, say the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins. Say it. And their sins &gt;&gt; and iniquities &gt;&gt; and iniquities &gt;&gt; will I remember no more. Why? Because he perfected it. &gt;&gt; He perfected it. I didn't perfect it. He perfected. The plan is perfect. So what are we here to do? We're here as witnesses by the Holy Spirit that that word is true. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, but I see my failures. I see my faults." That's that doesn't happen to give a true testimony. &gt;&gt; It is said in the scripture. And you need to repeat what the scripture has said is truth. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. I'm not even here to try to explain it. Say, "Well, explain that to me." You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; God's not here to necessarily explain everything. How can we understand God's grace? Who can understand grace? Who's got the equation for grace? Einstein had the equation for atomic power, but that's nothing compared to grace. &gt;&gt; Nothing compared to grace. Who's got the equation for grace? Who can tell us about the love of God? You can't understand the love of God. I can't understand the depths of God's love. I can't even I I can show you places where God extended himself in grace that I can't even begin to comprehend. &gt;&gt; How did he do that? &gt;&gt; Somebody explain Tamar her life. Somebody explain Rahab. Somebody explain how those women get to be in the motherhood of Jesus Christ. How'd explain that? &gt;&gt; I marvel at it. &gt;&gt; I'm delighted about it, but I can't understand it. I just say this is so incredible. This is so marvelous that God's great plan, he wouldn't let Satan foil it. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't let Satan thwart his plan or derail it. He had a plan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he put such a thing into the souls of the people. And if he put it back in there, listen to me. If God could so put something within within those women and within those men that their whole being was consumed with fulfilling God's word in their hour. What about us? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not here today to try to uh I I'm not gripped with an insatiable desire to to replicate the prophet's ministry or to try to do the same things. I'm I'm here with an just an insatiable thirst to believe what has really the fullness of what has really happened. You know what I would say? I would give this congregation some advice this morning. I doubt when we step over to the other side that any of us will even have the testimony that I fully grasped. I fully understood what God did in my day. &gt;&gt; I doubt if we fully grasp. We may say Malachi 4:5 and 6. We may say Luke 17:30, but I can't quite decipher the whole thing. I know that it is the revealing of the son of man. But how God took a man in flesh like you and I and stood him before the people and the and the and the veil of his skin became so transparent that God just began to talk. God begin to pass through his mind and his thoughts and how he could look out over the people and say there's a pillar of fire there hanging over that person and they're from a certain city and there that to me is so amazing. I say God I'm looking at Hebrews 4 and12 the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and I've lived in it. &gt;&gt; You've been gathered. &gt;&gt; I begin to think about the people that's going to be gathering. Brother Ernie gathering here and in the next few days and starting to gather now. Oh, I just thought of the song. Oh, what a gathering. What a gathering. What a gathering of the of the saints of God. &gt;&gt; You would not be here if it wasn't for the grace of God that sent a revelation, a a shaft of light &gt;&gt; into your dark and confused soul and caused you to see something with such clarity, you wouldn't be here. But here you are. &gt;&gt; Here you are. What are you? &gt;&gt; You want to say, I am a witness. &gt;&gt; What God has done in this hour is the truth. &gt;&gt; And because I'm a witness to the truth, I'm a true witness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that which was prophetic, that which was prophecy, God has taken me through a process. I've been justified and I've been sanctified. And now the Holy Ghost has come in. And the first the first evidence say what is the evidence? I'll speak in tongues. No, the evidence is that the word that he sent you will believe. &gt;&gt; And that that word now springs to life &gt;&gt; and you become a different person. &gt;&gt; You become to live the life of Jesus Christ. It's a different life. And then the life that you live, hear me now and pray that God will give me strength. And the life that you'll live is certain scriptures that promises which were prophecies before you came but now it begins to live in you and that prophecy begins to be made history. &gt;&gt; We are making history. We are the fulfillment of that scripture as a when apostle Peter stood up and said the prophet spoke Joel spoke in the last days sayith I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and then he could say this is that &gt;&gt; God revealed to him that what they were experiencing was that and that prophecy which had been prophetic now became a reality. &gt;&gt; You listening close? &gt;&gt; There's a strange scripture. There's a strange scripture in the in the Bible and um and it says this and they sang a new song and they sang the song rather of Moses and of the lamb. They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints." And I've been pondering this whole week. They sang the song of Moses. I want us, what was the song of Moses? And I went back and God spoke to Moses just before he was to die. Says, "Sing the people a song. Let this song be for a testimony." And he said, "Let this song be a witness against them." And Moses began to sing a song. Give ear, all ye heavens, and I will speak and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, and my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass. This is his song. And because I will publish the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness under our God. He is the rock. His work is perfect. For all his ways are judgment, a God of truth and without iniquity. Just and right is he. Next verse. They have have corrupted themselves. Their spot is not the spot of his children. They are a perverse and crooked generation. Do ye thus reququite the Lord, oh foolish people, and unwise? Is not thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee, and and established thee? Remember the days of old, and consider the years of many generations? Ask thy father, and he will show thee. and the elders and they will tell thee when the most high he's reminding them divided the nations to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam and he goes on and the Lord's portion is his people he's reestablishing Jacob is the lot of his inheritance but he goes down verse 15 verse 16 verse 17 verse 18 and verse 19 verse 29, verse 30, and verse 31. All the verses he's speaking that Jessron waxed fat and he kicked and thou art waxing fat and thou art grown thick. Thou art covered with fatness. And he talked about the blessing and how the blessing came down upon his people. And then he tells them, "This is a song. Sing a song and this song will be for a witness and you'll sing this song and you have gone after other gods and the gods of the other people and the gods of the other nations and he went on and on in his song would have been a hard song to sing. When we have people sing here, I would say almost a 100% of the time, we feel better when the song is sung because we feel inspired. We feel lifted up and we feel benefited. We feel edified. And Moses had a song and told the people in his song, "You've forgotten God. You've gone after other gods. You were prospered. You prospered and and and God dropped everything on you. He gave you the country. He gave you the gave you cities. He gave you all these things and you forgot God. And you go over to the book of Revelation. I'm so glad that that the part of the scripture that's for us doesn't stop. And they sang the song of Moses. But they sang the song of Moses and of the lamb. &gt;&gt; It was the song of the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not singing the song of Moses. We're singing the song of the lamb. We're singing a song of him that perfected us. We're singing the song of him that absolved us of our sins. We're singing a song of him that was victorious over Satan. We are witnesses that the head of the serpent has been crushed and bruised. We're singing a different song. We have a different melody &gt;&gt; because we're singing the song of the lamb, not the song of Moses, which was one of a people that had gone astray, had been blessed of God. We have indeed been blessed of God. Oh, what a glorious word we've received. Oh, what a glorious thing he has done. I'm a testimony today. You're a testimony today. You're a witness today. And we're singing another song. It's the song of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, and they said, "Come and see the lamb's wife." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's my song. &gt;&gt; That's my song. That's your song. Let's come and see the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; This is a language the world doesn't understand. They think I'm crazy, I suppose. But those that are on the internet, I hope they understand. We're singing the lamb song. Amen. &gt;&gt; What does the what does the line of the lamb song say? I'm your bride. &gt;&gt; I'm your wife. &gt;&gt; You have come from the realms of glory. You descended. I give testimony to Revelation 10:1 and another mighty angel descended. I know who that angel is. &gt;&gt; I have felt his presence. &gt;&gt; He has spoken to me. He has unveiled his word to me. I know who it was that was locked up in the seals. He took the seals off of himself. When he took the seals off of himself, he said, "Here I am." &gt;&gt; When he took the seals off himself, I don't see one wounded and fleeing from them that are holding stones in their hand. I see one that is glorious. &gt;&gt; I see one that is all powerful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see one that has gathered a people in this generation. Listen, my dear friends, my brothers, my sister, if it was not for this word, where would you be? You would be a wreck on the side of the road of humanity. &gt;&gt; You'd be destroyed. Many of you wouldn't even be here in a body. You'd be six feet under. Your homes would be destroyed. Your bodies would be destroyed. be very very few of you that would be sitting here if it was not for the grace of almighty God and sending this word. You could rise and say, "I am a witness." &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 has descended. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With an open book in his hand. &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. The book is open. &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. I know even what it says. I know what's in the book. &gt;&gt; Say, "What's in the book?" &gt;&gt; Well, I'll start off with a good one. My new name is in the book. &gt;&gt; My new life is in the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A life that I couldn't live before. &gt;&gt; Your new life. &gt;&gt; How many of you tried and tried and tried to be victorious? You couldn't be victorious. And then one day, that same Holy Spirit came down and gave you a Holy Ghost birth. And that word exploded to new depth and meaning within you and you walked out into a whole new life. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; I can tell even recently it's true. &gt;&gt; I have people in this congregation I know about whose lives were up and down and in and out and couldn't even begin to live victorious. And one day, one day it was just over. &gt;&gt; In an instant, in a moment, &gt;&gt; it was over. &gt;&gt; God's don't respect her persons. &gt;&gt; You're here today and you've not experienced that. The first thing you need to do say that is my portion. &gt;&gt; That is for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ the transforming power. He's still a transforming God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Why would we want to just know live on a popper's life if we could live and have the riches that he has ordained for us? This is what God said to Moses. Now therefore, write ye this song for you and teach it to the children of Israel. It was not a song somebody got up on the platform and took a microphone and sang. Moses didn't say, "Now, you just sit all there nice and quiet and reverended and I'm going to get my ram's horn and I'm going to sing for you this song." But first, furthermore, and I sometime I think maybe you people may feel I'm overworking you, but I say repeat this. This happens to be a long song. And God said to Moses, you teach these people that song. They got to sing this song. I'd have a hard time. I'm glad that's not my song. &gt;&gt; And you shall go out and serve idols. I say that is strange music for me. And the gods of other nations shall you serve. That just doesn't fit, does it? &gt;&gt; But I hear a different song. Hear another song with other words. You're mine. &gt;&gt; You're mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't belong to anyone else. &gt;&gt; I like to sing a song. We sing it and justified. Justified. I don't think it I don't think it really catches us. Sing the lamb song. I took your stain. You don't have it anymore. I took it. You confessed it. and it doesn't exist anymore. In fact, as it's gone so far back into the chemistry of God's thought and God's mind that it evaporated &gt;&gt; and God can't bring it back. And so a prophet could come and say, not just a nice little phrase to make you feel happy, you didn't do it in the first place. And the first place is not when you did it. The first place is when God thought of you. &gt;&gt; That's the first place. You never did it in the first place. In the beginning, it didn't exist. You're in the mind of God. You're not in the mind of God with sin. &gt;&gt; You're not in the mind of God with habits. You're not in the mind of God defeated under Satan. You're in the mind of God as a son and a daughter. &gt;&gt; And that's the lamb's song. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the lamb's song. &gt;&gt; I say sing the song of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm closing right away now. I'm trying to close in redemption in completeness. Brother Brandham refers to the Pentecost that happened back there. He calls it a shadow. And then he speaks of those that are recorded in Hebrews 11 of the Hebrews. They quenched the violence of fire and escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong and they waxed valiant in fight and turned to flight the armies of the aliens. He said all these things they did. Listen, you'd believe a vindicated messenger, wouldn't you? He said, "All these things they did. come out of the fiery furnace away from the lion's den and everything by the shadow. And then he adds a word, international word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All this they did by the shadow. &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we say hallelujah? &gt;&gt; They did it by the shadow. &gt;&gt; Just in a shadow. &gt;&gt; In the shadow of what? Of the positive. in the shadow of what was yet to come. &gt;&gt; They did this in the shadow. They were valiant. They fought. They struggled. They were freed from the lion's den and all of those things. &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, my dear precious friends, you've got you've become accustomed to the world that you live in. You'll go out and jump in your cars and jostle down through the traffic and uh and have people screeching their tires around you and you'll make your way. And some of you have flown here a long ways, brother Gary, Sister Barb, my and they've traveled and some are the kind of pressure that you live in. If you had brought some of those disciples of old, those prophets and sages and seers who you admire, some of those out of Hebrews 11, say, "I'd like to drop you and your family. like to drop you and your family into my generation. I'd like to send your children to this public school and have them under compulsion compulsory to read these kind of books and to see this cursing of God and this perversion that is being stuffed down their throats and the same-sex marriages and to teach that the children can be raised ly two men or two women and that they have to read these books. Would you like to send your children to this school? This is the school that's selected for your children. They'd say, "God, prevent me from living in such a place." &gt;&gt; And they'd have to feel the weight and the darkness and the deception. And there they would live. Maybe they had a ruthless nation and a king saying, "You bow. You bend and bow or we're going to slay you." That was an easy decision. You might say sitting here today, "That was a that was a difficult decision. You've got a lot harder one. You're making one every day. You're you if you're a son and daughter of God, you're praying, "Oh, God, give me wisdom. Give me guidance. Give me supernatural leadership. It's almost impossible to see the way, but I'm trusting you to guide me unairringly. &gt;&gt; Is it making sense to you? &gt;&gt; And if you took those heroes and said, "I'd like to drop you down into this Leodysian age where the church up there and the church over here and one over there and all kinds." I I can tell you if they were up over there in that church on 64th or down here in this church on 58th or the churches all around one over here on 184th of all these churches and they had some image up there and the people were making sacrifices and and worshiping some idol that wouldn't be a problem. When they start talking about their God like you talk about your God and they say that they love Jesus the way you love Jesus and they have certain signs and miracles and things that happen the way and they rejoice in what you rejoice and they sing the same songs you sing. Then you've got a problem. They use the same words we use. They use the same Bible I use. They rejoice in the same things I rejoice in. In fact, is they like the same spirit of my God that I like. &gt;&gt; Now, where's the line? &gt;&gt; Now, where is it? &gt;&gt; Now, what's the difference? Where's the distinction? That's only one distinction. Well, I'm a witness that Malachi 4 is not a prophecy but a fulfillment &gt;&gt; and that God has sent that man. Now you've drawn the line. &gt;&gt; For the first time you've drawn the line and then they're either going to say you're a false witness or you're a true witness. And then you say, "Well, that's my testimony." And I testify to Luke 17:30. In that day when the Son of Man will be revealed, I am here as a witness standing on the stand today before this congregation, before the world, having said and declare that has been fulfilled. Now you've drawn the line. &gt;&gt; You're either a false witness. Okay. We have something more. Let me see your people. Let me see your Let me see your children. &gt;&gt; Let me see your young men. Let me see your young ladies. Let me see your families. &gt;&gt; Let me see your wife, sir. Let me come into your home and see what it is you're entertained with. Let me have a look at what you do. And I'm afraid that I would have to declare, you are a false witness of this word. You're a false witness to a holy God. You're a false witness of the scripture. And I stand here today saying that this is a true witness. &gt;&gt; Not your argument, not how much you know, not what you've been taught in the seminary. What has it produced? &gt;&gt; And it ought to be man enough. Every man in here, every woman in here ought to be man enough and woman enough. When they see that which is of the world, say that is of the world &gt;&gt; and I am separated from that thing. &gt;&gt; I draw the line that is of the world. &gt;&gt; The suggestive clothing is of the world. &gt;&gt; Your jewelry and the way it and the way you conduct yourself is of the world. &gt;&gt; Can I just be a couple more minutes? Listen friends, I'm not quite done. Because of the way I'm speaking this morning, there was one more thing that had to happen with this prophet messenger. After he had delivered his message, he said, "I now call this generation to court." And brother Brandham took the position of prosecutor and he also took the position of defender. The Lord Jesus took the position of the prosecutor and also the defender. He said, "I don't come to condemn anyone, but the words I speak condemn you." He didn't come to condemn. He that believeth on the Son hath life. For God sent his son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world from for the world through him should be saved. If you believe, you are not condemned. &gt;&gt; He that believeth not is condemned already. &gt;&gt; He was both the defender and the prosecutor. &gt;&gt; He was the defense and the prosecuting attorney. And brother Brandham said, "I call the world. I called this generation to court and he said the prosecutor is the devil and he is he's got his witnesses Mr. unbeliever and Mr. Skeptic and Mr. impatient and they each one are coming on the stand saying the word is not true because I was prayed for and it didn't happen and all had similar testimony. My how glorious I'm identified with the message. I hope you're alert yet how glorious it was as I read those things to say I'm identified with a message. the one that's standing there as a defense to the word of God could make this word work &gt;&gt; in that service in another service. So he could speak also then he said I indict this generation &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and he said the same spirit that was on the people back there is here today against the word to crucify the word. He said, "I indict this generation." And he became the prosecutor. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I'm not just preaching a sermon and I'm ending just in a very, very few minutes. But I want to announce to you in case it hasn't really come through when you walk out these doors. Don't forget, you're walking amongst a people that has already been indicted by the greatest ministry that God sent on the earth. It is a It is a generation that's already under indictment for the judgment of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you wonder, why are things going to pieces? That's why they're going to pieces. Why are things the way they are? That's why they are that way. Oh, Brother Brandon talked about the economy of United States. I don't have the article right here. It was front page USA Today just a few weeks ago. They said the average American household is in debt for about $112,000 personal debt. But the government, the government of the United States has every single American household indebted by $516,000. You, we are indebted. Also, Brother Ron talked about a a war in the boys in Iraq. That's a very expensive place. $516,000 according to the USA Today, every American household is in debt. That's an enormous amount. And a prophet 40 years ago, saying your grandchildren 40 years from now will never be able to pay off the debt that we owe right now. That was back then because he could see the way it was going. &gt;&gt; Say, "I got 20,000 in the bank." Well, you're only 496,000 in the hole. What's the best way out of this? Not bankruptcy. It's rapture. &gt;&gt; That's the best way out of it. That's the only way out of it. Leave it all behind. &gt;&gt; Who you leaving it to? the Antichrist. Let him pay it off. He's got it all anyway. &gt;&gt; You think that's a pipe dream? This is This is statistics. This is I I gave you a little bit of history today. &gt;&gt; But a prophet saw it way ahead of time. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for this message. Thank God for the hour that we're in. And you people are a testimony. Don't forget it before you go out here. the doors of this building today. You know that this world is under indictment, but you are the people, &gt;&gt; not because I'm saying it. Tell me if if someone if someone would even dare to try to suggest that you aren't a true witness of this message, I'd say, "Well, you get me a message and a messenger that did equal or more than this prophet messenger, and I'll have reason to consider it." But until you do so, you have nothing to say. You have nothing to offer. We are in support of a word that has brought life to our being. &gt;&gt; Has made us whatever we are. &gt;&gt; Thank God we're true witnesses. And I'm singing a different song. Singing the song of the lamb. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To him all the prophets gave testimony. All the prophets gave witness. But we have been entrusted to do. I'm so I don't know. I don't have the words. I'm so beside myself to think that we've been chosen to live in this last hour. and to stand on the witness stand before this world, wherever that witness stand may be. Don't ever forget the world is looking at you very carefully. I'm not saying you're different because I'm saying you're different. You are completely a different people. you are from another world, from another place. And I could read the quote, I won't take the time. And he said, you're reflecting the world of your rebirth. Those are his words. You people here today, we are reflecting the world of our rebirth. The people that you are reflecting it to, they know nothing about that that world, but they all they ever will know about it is what they see being expressed and shining through you. That's all they'll ever know about it. And that's why you look strange. Oh, it's not your dress only. It's not your the way you are, the way you approach things. They sense it. They pick it up right away. You can meet stranger. I find it. I find it all the time. All the time. And they determine you're nice people, but it's something more than they want. They're not prepared to make that kind of a commitment. That's what the man said to our brother Frank Fletcher. You've heard the story, most of you. I'll just close with it. In his shoe store way over near the University of British Columbia, probably 30 miles from here on 4th Street, I believe it was 4th Avenue, 4th Street, over near the university. the man who was designing this church that you're sitting in, the architect that was designing this church, we told him what what money we had and he had to work within that. and he'd be designing a grand building with some enormous kind of a ceiling and roof and oh my he just was so elaborate and he sent me down to Portland to look at a similar roof and the roof was going to cost what we wanted to pay for the whole building something like the BC center with one of those polyurethane roofs blowed up with air on the inside and uh we have enough air on the inside anyway. And so we fired him. The board fired him. Said we, you know, we got to get another. And he was in brother Frank Fletcher store buying a pair of shoes. And Frank asked him a question. He says, "Where's there a church that preaches the truth? Is that what you said? Can you say it out loud? Stand up and say it again. You gota you got to yell at brother Frank as church to live it. It was too heavy for me, but it might be for you. So I asked him what it was. &gt;&gt; And that's it. It's too heavy for him, &gt;&gt; but it might be all right for you. &gt;&gt; And here he came. It was too heavy for one, but it was just right for another one. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. I can say it was just right for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't mind. I'm going to sing a couple happy songs. &gt;&gt; I was there when Jesus saved me. I I was there and I guess I ought to know. Were you there? &gt;&gt; Better be a witness. [Music] I was there when Jesus saved me. [Music] He took away my heavy burden and he gave me peace. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I was there when you save me. [Music] Christ. [Music] And I guess I ought to know. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't bad, but it wasn't really, you know, we're not there yet. like the children soon as they said, "I think you can do better." Oh, it just went right up. Maybe this is new to a lot of you, but I think we can sing it anyway. I was there when Jesus saved me. He broke me down. [Music] [Applause] Brother Rod, do you know the verses to this? I'm sure you do. Help us out. You know the verses. They're right here. How's the verse go? [Music] There are some people [Music] tell whether you are safe, whether all is well. [Music] But I was there when it happened. And I guess I ought to know I was there to save me. Microphone. [Music] You need a microphone. [Music] [Music] Jesus save [Music] the way my handace. [Music] [Applause] and I &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want to worship him a little bit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Said, "When are you going to finish, Brother Ed? As soon as we're done. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what we're doing? The convention started. &gt;&gt; It's already here. The saints are gathering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the redeemed, [Music] who? When the redeemed are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in and washed like snow and free from all sin. Oh, I will shout. I will sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, when the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin. Oh, how we'll shout. How we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, there they'll be in their blessing. And when the redeemed are gathering in, I will raise that heavenly anthem in that city in the sky. When the redeemed are gathering in when the redeemed are gathering in watch like snow free from all sin. I will shout and I will sing with redeemed. [Music] You know, it's a song that I sing quite often when we've been out in conventions and I get carried away and because a lot of folks don't know me there, I I kind of do things I never done before, but I always I I like to wave my handkerchief. Oh, I'm going do a wave offering to the Lord. If you got one, you can do it. Borrow a Kleenex or whatever you want. And what a gathering. Our brother Julius Cesar just arrived from Brazil. We're going to have him give a greeting. Hallelujah. Amen. [Applause] Let Let's sing that verse. There'll be a great uh There'll be a great procession. And we're going to have a word from a brother. Have we got an interpreter here, too? Brother Billy. God bless you. Why don't you come up here while we're singing it? All right. &gt;&gt; There will be a great streets of gold every day. I'm gathering with music singing for the city will be my [Music] free from all sin. How will we sing? Oh, God. We'll win the redeemer [Music] singing. [Music] and free from all s [Applause] [Music] and give us a word of greeting. &gt;&gt; Give us a word of greeting, please. &gt;&gt; Here we have this brother my son. And he he did all the interpreting and translation for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give him some volume here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I praise the Lord in Portuguese. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't understand it, but it sounded good. Give us a word of greeting. I'm very happy to be here for the first time. I got here at the very good moment &gt;&gt; and the moment of the breaking of the bread. &gt;&gt; It's a special moment. It was a desire in our heart to get to know this church and the saints in Christ that were reached through this message. I am certain that it was because you got to know this message that we are here on this mo right moment. &gt;&gt; This message of the evening time that united our hearts and when we see for the first time then we know each other as brothers. &gt;&gt; True brothers &gt;&gt; regardless of color. nationality or race. &gt;&gt; We are brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when I got here, &gt;&gt; I could see this wonderful church enjoying of the presence of God. And we were moved. We came from Brazil just to be here. And we believe that Jesus is here tonight. and we want to worship him on this stage with you as well. I was hearing the brother preaching a while ago when he said that we are rich &gt;&gt; and sometimes we we live like poor. &gt;&gt; That's one of the worst situations we could be in is when we are rich and we know not. But this message, it came and took it away from us, this kind of thought to bring us to get to know this true richness to be sons and daughters of God. He was the message of William Brandham, the the messenger of the brought this truth for us. I didn't know I was a son of God. I was living like a miserable person eating any kind of food. Today I have the best food for my soul. I have the message of the hour. So now I know that I am rich and I don't want to live like a poor person. I want to live like a rich person and the message of the hour. I want to thank you with all my heart. I want to thank brother Bisco for his invitation for me to come to Canada since I saw his name on the books the messages. &gt;&gt; So I I I I was interested in knowing because I know you know the message more than we do. Not all the names that brother Brandham mentioned that these men have kept in the center of the way. We know him &gt;&gt; and his ministry &gt;&gt; and his work. I I I believe his name is not on the books by chance. That was a purpose of God for this man. So we desire to come here and see so that we would have the blessings as well and I hope that during all this week and the next week we are bringing good things back home as the proverb goes when we go to the supermarket and we have money to buy we always take a cart and when we come to church and we have faith to receive. We need space to bring all the blessings back home and I believe that God will give us those blessings. &gt;&gt; You came with me. Brother Neville, my son, my wife as well, sister, she's on the way back there. &gt;&gt; May God bless you all. &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord Jesus. come and give us a greeting. God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's a great pleasure to be here this morning to see uh so many lovely faces, people a very all kinds of different people. So I started thinking how wonderful will that day be. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's been a great priv privilege to uh get to know the ministry of your pastor. &gt;&gt; I met him December last year on his trip to John Pesa. So, it was a great privilege hearing him preaching. So I extended him an invitation as well to come and preach on my congregation. &gt;&gt; So then he said if you go to if you come to my place &gt;&gt; then I will make you a human promise. &gt;&gt; I'm here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The church on which I am minister it's called El Shadai Tabernacle El Shadai. &gt;&gt; It's uh way down in Brazil in the south. And we have a website and uh the messages that he preached on that occasion I put them in there and many people were blessed through that but they were not on the meetings but they they had the chance to watch and many people asked for copies as well. They were blessed too. It's wonderful to see him preaching about the ministry of the son of man, about the opening of the seven seals. I loved it very much. When I saw him preaching about the rapture, this message is the rapture. It we are on this rapture. This message is bringing this up, the faith for the rapture. and we are looking forward to have a very blessed week. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Just a little foretaste. I mean this is Sunday is not convention doesn't start till next Sunday. So we've got two weeks of convention. Amen. All right. Well, we'll see you, Lord willing, on Wednesday. Uh we're going to let the brothers get some rest now and and we don't know what's going to happen Wednesday where we're in great expectation. Well, we're just going to bow and be and dismiss in prayer now at this time. Our gracious, loving heavenly father, we want to thank you right first, for bringing our brothers and and our sister Maya here, Lord, giving them a safe journey. &gt;&gt; We know they're weary and body, but I pray that you'll refresh them, give them good rest, and let them get their systems balanced out, Lord. We have a a very full time. Pray, oh God, you'll make their time here a blessing. bless their ministry amongst us &gt;&gt; and I pray that you will bless Lord our uh time with them and may it be just a mutual benefiting of the body of Jesus Christ. Lord, I pray that you will take the people now and send them from this place with the glory of God upon them. And may they know of a certainty that they have been elected, chosen, and called of the Almighty God to be witnesses of this truth and of this message that you have sent. Lord, I pray that you'll give them such a boldness and such a strength. I ask Father now that the word may linger along with us, nor your presence will ever go with us. In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit them to you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greet one another if you would please. And I just have one short announcement. Deacons and ushers, uh, meeting has been moved to Brother Timberman's room. Brother Timberman's office for the deacons and the ushers. You're dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you. Amen.
