[0:36] So the brothers know this uh screen here
[0:38] is not working. So it happens every time
[0:41] you have a wedding that this screen
[0:43] never works. Anyways, we had a wonderful
[0:45] time at the wedding yesterday. Just uh
[0:49] appreciate it. You love the Lord this
[0:51] morning.
[0:53] You know, I had the opportunity
[0:56] uh I
[0:58] you know, they you you get on the
[1:00] airlines and they put this stuff up in
[1:02] front of you and and uh I saw something
[1:05] most of you would never want to see, but
[1:07] you know, it just struck me. And
[1:09] sometimes the Lord lets you see this
[1:10] stuff for a reason. You know, Satan has
[1:12] a song leader.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; I saw him.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; He's on a screen
[1:18] and I won't mention his name.
[1:21] Everybody's heard of him, but I mean,
[1:23] you know,
[1:25] when he walked out, everybody was on
[1:28] their feet.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; And you know, they were in unity.
[1:32] They're there to have a good time. Was
[1:34] partying, right? I'm sure most of them
[1:36] had, you know, done some illegal
[1:38] substance before they were there.
[1:41] But I trust you came here
[1:44] &gt;&gt; on something that the world doesn't
[1:45] like,
[1:47] &gt;&gt; right? You need to be come here full of
[1:48] the Holy Ghost. Brother, you need to
[1:50] bring the lick of fire with you.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Amen, man. It'll make you do things that
[1:53] the world will think is not normal.
[1:58] [Music]
[2:00] &gt;&gt; I sometimes I think, you know, the young
[2:02] people got together the other night. My
[2:04] wife was there, my daughter, and they
[2:05] had a wonderful time. Some of them was
[2:07] just this I don't know how big the group
[2:08] was, but they were just worshiping,
[2:11] praising God. We should come in here,
[2:12] saints, and be so ready.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be so ready. in one mind, one
[2:19] accord. Brother Brandham said, "My
[2:21] loving friends, may I say this to you
[2:22] tonight? God wants us one, but he wants
[2:25] us one. Not under the foolishness of
[2:27] manhad, but he wants us one. United
[2:30] under the holy Godhead. United as one
[2:32] person, one man, one woman, one church,
[2:35] one people, one view, one purpose, one
[2:38] motive, one objective. That's Jesus
[2:40] Christ." Amen.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; One thing to serve him, one love, the
[2:45] love of God, one brotherhood,
[2:47] brotherhood of man, one fellowship of
[2:49] the Holy Ghost, then we're united.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. I want to
[2:53] sing. The love of God is greater or far.
[2:56] Amen. Let's just worship him, saints.
[2:58] Don't think about the person next to
[3:00] you.
[3:02] Just focus on God and worship him with
[3:05] all your soul, all your heart, all your
[3:07] might. everything that you have within

[23:59] Brother Andy Melma's got a song for us
[24:01] this morning. So, Brother Andy, if you
[24:03] could come and get ready while we've got
[24:05] a couple of announcements.
[24:13] on Friday night,
[24:16] uh, November 21st,
[24:19] uh, they're going to have, uh, some
[24:20] special young people's meetings. Uh,
[24:24] and so I want to go through it just now.
[24:26] I, uh, just so everyone knows what's
[24:28] going on and what's h going to be
[24:30] happening. This is next Friday night,
[24:32] November the 21st. Um, young men, okay?
[24:37] If you're a young man, you go to Young
[24:38] People's Meeting. The meeting is going
[24:40] to be at the Mount Baker Bible Way Camp,
[24:43] 7:30 p.m. Young men only, age 13 to 30
[24:49] if you're single. All the young men are
[24:52] needed at the camp Saturday, November
[24:54] 22nd for a work workbe. There's just a
[24:56] whole bunch of stuff that needs to be
[24:57] get done. So, this is Brother Kris's way
[25:00] of getting you out there. Um,
[25:03] accommodations are going to be at the
[25:04] Sequoia dorm above the cafeteria. Each
[25:06] camper will need to bring their own
[25:08] bedding. There's going to be a Friday
[25:10] evening snack provided after the
[25:13] meeting. That means you should eat ahead
[25:15] of time before you get down there. Um,
[25:19] breakfast and lunch will be provided for
[25:21] the workers on Saturday. Please give
[25:24] confirmation to the church office that
[25:26] you will be spending the night and
[25:28] available for work on Saturday. And
[25:30] obviously if some of you are working on
[25:32] Saturday um uh you know in your job, you
[25:35] may want to go down there and then and
[25:36] then just uh and then just come home
[25:38] Saturday morning. Um there is for the
[25:42] sisters, the young ladies, there's going
[25:44] to be a regular meeting here at the
[25:46] church at the fellowship hall at 7:30
[25:49] p.m. And again, this is for the young
[25:53] single sisters only, 13 to 30. There's
[25:56] going to be a special speaker for the
[25:57] sisters this evening. And as usual,
[26:00] refreshments will follow. If you have
[26:02] any questions, please contact the church
[26:04] office.
[26:06] Also, um, Brother Chris informed me that
[26:09] they are in need of seven adults to
[26:13] actually assist in the fence
[26:14] installation. I I don't know if that
[26:16] means that the young men can't actually
[26:19] work, but
[26:22] they need someone to actually assist in
[26:24] the fence installations. Some will from
[26:26] the US side in the building trades who
[26:28] have screw guns would be helpful. Other
[26:30] young people can help if they're able.
[26:32] They've got lots of shovels, picks, and
[26:34] rakes. They also need uh someone over
[26:39] the age of 18 who's able to punch a time
[26:42] clock and stay up all night because of
[26:44] the we don't have the fire system in
[26:45] there yet. It hasn't been tested. It's
[26:47] there, but it hasn't been tested and
[26:48] approved. So, they they need uh someone
[26:51] to stay up all night. So, uh I assume
[26:54] that's not one of the campers there, but
[26:56] uh if you are interested in going down
[26:58] there and uh uh and provide this help,
[27:02] they would really appreciate it. Um
[27:05] those that are needed for the fencing
[27:07] detail uh should show up at 9:00 in the
[27:10] morning and um have any questions, you
[27:14] can talk to Brother Chris Peterson.
[27:16] Amen. Brother Andy
[27:21] We come to a place this morning where we
[27:24] can cut off pressure.
[27:27] We uh we hear absolute masterpieces from
[27:30] behind this pulpit and uh it's teached
[27:32] here continually preached and teached.
[27:35] Just in the last week, we've uh we've
[27:37] heard the light behind the veil. Brother
[27:39] Ed preaching about the light is pressing
[27:41] the darkness and the darkness is
[27:43] congealing.
[27:45] God's light will never give way to
[27:47] darkness. It will always overcome.
[27:50] Sometimes what the the prophet said may
[27:52] seem strong but the light shines and
[27:55] anything less and it would not have
[27:58] pressed the darkness back.
[28:00] This church clover Bible way is a
[28:02] healing atmosphere and it's your job to
[28:04] keep it that way to bind up the
[28:06] brokenhearted. And then we heard uh
[28:09] apprehended by God brother Tom
[28:12] apprehended by love for love and always
[28:16] keep love before you. We're dead.
[28:19] Brother Tom said, we're dead earnest,
[28:22] serious about with this gospel. There's
[28:24] seven virtues and the stature of a
[28:27] perfect man.
[28:29] We're at the top of the pyramid of
[28:30] perfect love.
[28:33] And none of these virtues are
[28:34] disinished.
[28:36] Brother John preached breaking the
[28:38] chains of temptation.
[28:40] God said, "I will keep you in the hour
[28:42] of temptation."
[28:44] He said that. And we're all being
[28:47] tempted.
[28:49] We were born to crush Satan.
[28:53] These sermons have come from the word of
[28:55] God and and God himself.
[28:57] They're there for us to help us that we
[29:00] might glorify God in all we do and say.
[29:04] Something Brother Biscll said last year
[29:06] that really helped me was uh he said,
[29:09] "It's a principle. Let it be known. It's
[29:11] a principle. If we don't receive
[29:15] and embrace and reverence the light that
[29:19] has come, darkness will creep in.
[29:23] We go through fiery trials. And brother,
[29:26] brother Ed asked the question, how do we
[29:29] compensate?
[29:31] We get into the light. It's the light
[29:33] that drives out the darkness.
[29:38] going to sing until then.
[29:44] My heart can sing
[29:48] when I pause to remember
[29:54] a heartache here
[29:58] is but a stepping stone
[30:03] [Music]
[30:05] along the trail
[30:08] that's winding always upward. word.
[30:13] [Music]
[30:15] This troubled world
[30:19] is not my final home.
[30:25] But until then,
[30:29] my heart will go on singing.
[30:33] [Applause]
[30:35] [Music]
[30:36] Until then,
[30:38] [Music]
[30:39] with joy I'll carry on.
[30:45] Until the day
[30:49] mine eyes behold the city.
[30:55] Until the day
[30:59] God calls
[31:01] me home.
[31:05] The things of earth
[31:09] will dim and lose their value.
[31:15] If we recall,
[31:19] they're borrowed for a while.
[31:25] And things of earth
[31:28] that cause the heart to tremble.
[31:35] remembered there
[31:38] will only bring a smile.
[31:45] But until then,
[31:48] my heart will go on singing.
[31:54] [Music]
[31:55] Until then,
[31:58] with joy I'll carry on.
[32:04] Until the day
[32:08] mine eyes behold the city.
[32:12] [Music]
[32:14] Until the day
[32:17] God calls
[32:20] me home.
[32:24] This weary world
[32:27] with all its toil and struggle
[32:33] may take its toll
[32:37] of misery
[32:39] and strife.
[32:42] The soul of man
[32:46] is like a waiting eagle.
[32:50] [Music]
[32:52] When it's released,
[32:55] it's destined for the skies.
[33:02] But until then,
[33:05] my heart will go on singing.
[33:10] [Music]
[33:12] Until then,
[33:15] with joy I'll carry on.
[33:21] Until the day
[33:24] mine eyes behold the city.
[33:28] [Music]
[33:30] Until the day
[33:34] God calls
[33:36] me home.
[33:40] But until then
[33:44] with
[33:46] on singing
[33:50] until then
[33:52] [Music]
[33:53] with joy I'll carry on
[33:59] until the day
[34:03] mine eyes behold the city
[34:07] [Music]
[34:09] until the day
[34:12] God calls
[34:15] me home.

[36:52] of my heart. That's why I asked Brother
[36:53] Rod to sing that just as we as I would
[36:56] come to the pull pit. I am thine, O
[37:00] Lord.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; I've heard thy voice

[37:07] &gt;&gt; but I long to rise. Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; On the arms of faith
[37:12] &gt;&gt; and be closer drawn to thee. It's my
[37:14] testimony. It's my hunger, my desire, my
[37:17] craving, and yours, too. Otherwise, you
[37:20] wouldn't be here. Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for that. We're really
[37:25] happy to have our brother Murphy back
[37:28] after two intense months into many new
[37:33] places in China.
[37:35] And I can tell you that when brother
[37:37] Murphy goes to
[37:40] China, it is uh a working trip,
[37:44] working and ministering from morning
[37:46] till night.
[37:48] I'm going to just ask him to greet you,
[37:51] but I want to say China is such a a
[37:54] remarkable
[37:56] uh work
[37:59] for for myself. It's it's so remarkable
[38:02] in in how it had its beginnings. saw
[38:05] brother John lay just as I was driving
[38:07] in this morning and he and brother John
[38:10] Sack are first going there with you know
[38:12] pack sacks on their back and and handing
[38:15] out books at the three self church and
[38:18] just going in there and then then God
[38:21] just starts opening the doors and
[38:24] creating a need and creating a hunger
[38:27] and people you know coming and becoming
[38:32] real curious about the message And then
[38:35] it just begins to grow like that. And uh
[38:39] now here we are a few years later
[38:42] uh 330ome
[38:45] messages translated
[38:48] 240ome
[38:49] voice over on the voice and I can tell
[38:53] you because very dedicated people and
[38:55] brother Timothy M. God bless these
[38:58] brothers that have labored. Brother
[38:59] Ivan, uh God bless them. And then those
[39:02] that were raised up over there, they
[39:05] just, you know, some just took a hold of
[39:08] it, some didn't take a hold of it. But,
[39:11] uh, the work has spread to, to me, that
[39:15] is it's so divine because it is
[39:18] sovereign.
[39:20] Nobody has planned it out. It's God
[39:24] planned it out. He opened the doors,
[39:26] arranged the certain individuals, and it
[39:29] just came out of the burden of the heart
[39:30] of the people. And here we have this
[39:33] taking place. So, Brother Murphy, we
[39:35] have missed you, Brother Murphy, I just
[39:37] feel like he's a a son. I miss him so
[39:40] much when he's away. Now, here he is.
[39:42] And just greet the people, Brother
[39:44] Murphy, and say a few words about where
[39:46] you've been. And Amen. He looks all
[39:48] right, doesn't he?
[39:50] &gt;&gt; I told him it's hard to have sympathy
[39:52] for him when he looks so good after that
[39:54] long trip. God bless you, brother M.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Well, so glad to be back and see all the
[39:59] saints. Um my family uh that come to
[40:01] know you all that's my family and
[40:03] brothers and sisters I really been
[40:05] appreciate you uh I know this uh many
[40:07] have been praying for me and uh also my
[40:09] family I just want to say God bless you
[40:11] and um this is a unique trip for me um
[40:15] uh we uh went to uh several new places
[40:17] and the Lord really opened a door and we
[40:20] went to um um never been such a door to
[40:23] open to my life uh in the in the past
[40:25] few years for the ministry um we go to
[40:29] we went to the street self church and
[40:30] the home church and some church they
[40:33] have the hundreds of people to open door
[40:35] for us and some uh even the government
[40:38] church they said um you know we want to
[40:40] have the training class you can preach
[40:42] whatever you can preach and uh we give
[40:44] you open door for this and also uh we
[40:47] saw the pastors in the street church
[40:49] been baptized and not only be baptized
[40:51] but as afterward they sending a message
[40:53] back to us they said um our whole lives
[40:56] been upside down but for the Good.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And um they received the books and
[41:00] they've been reading that
[41:02] &gt;&gt; and they said um the prophet said after
[41:05] we read the seals book the prophet said
[41:07] we need to get out of the system. He
[41:09] said now we need uh we're going to uh
[41:12] making this decision. So you can see how
[41:14] the lord been working in them. So I just
[41:16] ask you to praying for them and um if
[41:19] lord willing and um u maybe I can share
[41:22] more detail but today I just want to
[41:24] listen to my pastor's preaching. God
[41:26] bless you.
[41:28] [Applause]
[41:30] [Music]
[41:37] If you'd be having special prayer for us
[41:39] next uh Sunday, they're having a a
[41:42] missions convention. I shouldn't say
[41:44] missions convention, but it's a focus on
[41:46] missions. And uh Lord willing, I will be
[41:50] uh there with them in Murphy'sboro. Uh
[41:52] brother Joseph Hammed has God put it in
[41:55] his heart some years ago And when he
[41:58] came up to the 27 207 convention, it
[42:03] just sparked. It came to fruition in his
[42:05] heart. He's been traveling almost he
[42:08] said a lot of this summer he was
[42:10] traveling to other churches to see how
[42:13] many would like to participate and there
[42:15] was quite a number said we want to be
[42:17] part of what's uh taking place. So they
[42:21] are uh they're joining together. One of
[42:23] the big concerns was that they didn't
[42:26] the price of fuel was so high that the
[42:30] pastors in other places other states
[42:32] said we just don't see how are people
[42:34] going to be able to drive and the price
[42:36] of motel and everything also high and so
[42:41] people were going to have be under
[42:44] financial strain. Well, guess what? A
[42:47] lot of that's gone away.
[42:49] The fuel went down about half price and
[42:52] he went around to the motel because of
[42:54] the meltdown. Nobody's traveling and
[42:57] there's literally real fine
[43:00] uh holiday in express and some of these
[43:03] they cut their price right in half.
[43:07] People are getting getting rooms for
[43:09] prices they never were able to get it
[43:10] before. Brother Kim is Kim Dingwell is
[43:13] going to be there. Brother Dier is
[43:15] coming as well. Brother Dioa is coming
[43:18] with a couple of men of his brothers
[43:20] from uh Congo and they're wanting to
[43:24] focus on uh just several countries. So
[43:28] on Africa and they thought brother Dioa
[43:30] would be such a good representative of
[43:34] what is taking place there and they want
[43:36] to get behind that work China. So
[43:39] brother Murphy is going he just got home
[43:41] but he'll turn around go for this
[43:42] weekend down there just for the three
[43:44] days Friday, Saturday, Sunday. and these
[43:47] brothers and brother Kim who's just been
[43:49] in India now and Philippines and brother
[43:53] Ernie you're going to be there as well
[43:55] and so these brothers are pray for them
[43:58] would you please pray for them because
[44:00] many of these churches they're not like
[44:03] for example here they've not heard
[44:05] they've not been kept up to date they
[44:08] maybe they don't even have an outreach
[44:10] at all and and they but they want to and
[44:13] this will give them an open door if the
[44:15] Lord lays it on their heart. So these
[44:17] brothers will just represent these
[44:19] countries and we're so thankful for
[44:21] that. I don't know whether they had
[44:23] prayer earlier. I was just locked away
[44:26] in in the study. But for Sister Deborah
[44:28] Reed, Sister Jennifer Johnson's mom, and
[44:31] Sister Jennifer is with her this
[44:32] morning. They thought that she had a
[44:35] collapsed lung and it turned out that
[44:38] she has num they think that she has
[44:40] pneumonia. So we're going to remember
[44:43] her in prayer. Also, uh I just really
[44:47] respect Sister Jennifer for standing by
[44:49] her mother the way she does. And I I the
[44:53] sisters that have been so faithful. So
[44:57] we I I prayed I prayed. I said, "Lord
[45:02] Jesus, all you have to do is come to her
[45:04] bedside and just tenderly touch her and
[45:08] awaken her." Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; And there's no reason why that could
[45:12] couldn't just happen this morning while
[45:14] we're in prayer. Amen. That's a simple
[45:17] thing to God.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand to our feet?
[45:23] We'll just pray as we going to get ready
[45:25] to turn to the word.
[45:27] Our dear heavenly father, how dear you
[45:30] are to us. And that's why we call you
[45:32] dear heavenly father who has loved
[45:36] fatherhood and has brought forth a
[45:38] family. And this this group of people
[45:41] that is here, those that are streaming,
[45:44] those that are in the fellowship room,
[45:46] the nursery, wherever, we are we are
[45:49] your children. We are representative,
[45:52] Lord. Just a representative of people
[45:54] that are all over all over the world.
[45:56] Those that Brother Murphy has just
[45:59] ministered to. Lord, we want to pray for
[46:02] them. These ministers that are part of
[46:05] the uh part of the recognized church in
[46:08] that country and there are the the word
[46:11] and the message has turned their life
[46:13] upside down and we can say amen to that.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; We have experienced the same thing. It
[46:20] is a word that certainly turns a life
[46:22] around and sometimes oh God just a
[46:26] complete reversal of direction. So we
[46:29] pray for them. We pray you'll strengthen
[46:31] them and give them courage. Oh God, give
[46:35] them discernment. Father, may the power
[46:38] of the Holy Spirit direct their every
[46:41] decision and every step. Lord, I pray
[46:44] for the service this morning. Pray that
[46:46] you will take your word, drive it to
[46:49] every heart. We're a needy people, Lord.
[46:52] I confess we're a needy people, oh God.
[46:55] We need we need everything that you can
[46:58] give us. We pray that you will so
[47:00] inspire us, Lord. So anoint us. Anoint
[47:04] me to speak. Anoint the people to
[47:06] receive. I pray that it will hit the
[47:09] target. Oh God, in the name of Jesus
[47:12] Christ, we're remembering Sister Deborah
[47:14] Reed. Oh God, out of this slumber and
[47:17] out of this unconscious state, would you
[47:20] awaken her, Lord? Go to her bedside and
[47:23] and touch her body, oh God. touch, oh
[47:27] God, the part that needs to be repaired.
[47:30] I pray that you'll just awaken her out
[47:32] of the slumber. And I pray you'll
[47:34] strengthen Sister Jennifer, dear Lord,
[47:36] as she stands by her mother so
[47:38] respectfully. God, I pray you'll
[47:41] encourage her. And now, Lord Jesus, your
[47:43] will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[47:46] is our prayer. Enable me now, Lord, to
[47:49] speak and utter the words of the Holy
[47:51] Spirit in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[47:57] I'll have you turn to 1 Corinthians 15.
[48:00] And while you're turning, I want to
[48:01] thank brother Annie Melma for that song
[48:04] until then and the comments you made.
[48:07] And uh it's wonderful, brother, you
[48:10] know, listens and makes notes and
[48:13] something speaks to him and he's able to
[48:15] share it with you at a later time. And
[48:19] uh we appreciate that. That's real real
[48:22] quality brothers. Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And a good singer, too.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we get a double benefit.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to start reading at verse 42.
[48:36] Quite a lengthy reading. 1 Corinthians
[48:39] 15:42.
[48:42] Verses 35 to 38.
[48:47] uh start out with a question, but some
[48:51] uh some man will say, "How are the dead
[48:53] raised up?" And Paul begins to
[48:57] uh equate the human body to a seed
[49:04] and whatever is buried will bring forth
[49:09] again. That is the what his thought is.
[49:13] And then he talks about the there's
[49:15] different kinds of flesh. There's flesh
[49:17] of fishes and beasts and and birds and
[49:20] so on. And then in verse 42, he said,
[49:25] "It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in
[49:28] glory. It is sown in weakness. It is
[49:32] raised in power. It is sown a natural
[49:35] body. It is raised a spiritual body.
[49:38] There is a natural body and there is a
[49:42] spiritual body." And so it is written,
[49:46] the first man Adam was made a living
[49:48] soul, but the last Adam was made a
[49:50] quickening spirit. How be it that was
[49:53] not first which is spiritual, but that
[49:56] which is natural, and afterward that
[50:00] which is spiritual. The first man is of
[50:03] the earth, earthy. The second man is the
[50:06] Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such
[50:10] are they also that are earthy. And as is
[50:14] the heavenly, such are they also that
[50:17] are heavenly. And as we have borne the
[50:20] image of the earthly, we shall also bear
[50:23] the image of the heavenly. Can we say
[50:25] amen to that?
[50:27] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
[50:30] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
[50:33] neither do corruption inherit
[50:35] incorruption. Behold, I show you a
[50:38] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[50:41] shall all be changed in a moment, in the
[50:44] twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.
[50:47] For the trumpet shall sound, and the
[50:50] dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
[50:52] we shall be changed. For this
[50:55] corruptible must put on incorruption,
[50:58] and this mortal must put on immortality.
[51:01] And when this corruptible shall have put
[51:03] on incorruption, and this mortal shall
[51:06] have put on immortality,
[51:09] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[51:11] that is written, death is swallowed up
[51:14] in victory.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[51:24] I I want to speak to you on this uh
[51:27] subject law of reproduction.
[51:34] Law of reproduction.
[51:37] And as the apostle Paul is is is taking
[51:41] us through this scripture which is the
[51:44] word of God,
[51:47] he makes clear distinctions between the
[51:50] earthly and the heavenly, between the
[51:54] natural body and the spiritual body.
[51:58] Between that which is sown in weakness,
[52:00] it's raised in power. That which is sown
[52:03] in dishonor is raised in glory. The
[52:07] first Adam and the second Adam from
[52:10] heaven. The corruptible and the
[52:13] incorruptible.
[52:15] The mortal and the immortal. All of
[52:18] these are what we have just read. And
[52:21] there are laws that control each of
[52:24] them. That's how come something is
[52:27] corruption corruptible because God has a
[52:30] law that said it would die. And there's
[52:33] an incorruptible which is another law.
[52:36] There's a natural. We have natural laws.
[52:40] We have spiritual laws. And a law is a
[52:43] law.
[52:45] A law is not something you can adjust
[52:48] and play with. A law is a law. He said
[52:51] plainly, you know, if the law says 30 m
[52:54] an hour, that's what it is.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Now, you might go 35 or you might go 25,
[53:00] but the the law is is the law. The law
[53:03] is that fire is hot. It's always been
[53:06] hot. It's hot today and it'll be hot
[53:09] tomorrow and it'll be hot thousand years
[53:11] from now if the earth should stand.
[53:14] These are laws and there are natural
[53:16] laws.
[53:18] There are spiritual laws. There's laws
[53:20] of gravity and laws of science and all
[53:24] kinds of things which we don't want to
[53:26] even spend time in this morning. But I'm
[53:31] speaking of the law of reproduction and
[53:35] the emphasis is on the seed.
[53:38] Apostle Paul begins to describe our
[53:41] bodies as a seed. But I want to go back
[53:44] and I'll just I'll give you these
[53:47] scriptures. You don't have to turn to
[53:48] them because I'm going to be going quite
[53:50] fast. But in Genesis 1 says, "And God
[53:53] said, let the earth bring forth grass
[53:55] and herb yielding seed and the fruit
[53:58] tree yielding fruit after his kind." I'm
[54:02] going to make making emphasis as I go
[54:04] along. Whose seed is in itself upon the
[54:08] earth and it was so. And the earth
[54:10] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[54:14] seed after its kind. and the tree fruit
[54:18] whose seed and the tree yielding fruit
[54:22] whose seed was in itself after its kind.
[54:26] And God saw there was good. And God
[54:28] created great whales and every living
[54:30] creature that moveth uh which the waters
[54:33] brought forth abundantly after their
[54:35] kind, and every wing foul after his
[54:38] kind. And God saw that it was good. And
[54:41] God said, "Let the earth bring forth the
[54:44] living creatures after his kind, cattle
[54:47] and creeping things, and the beast of
[54:49] the earth after his kind." And it was
[54:52] so. And God made the beast of the earth
[54:55] after his kind, and the cattle after
[54:58] their kind, and every little every
[55:00] living thing that creepeth upon the
[55:02] earth after his kind. And God saw that
[55:05] was good. And God said, "Let us make
[55:07] man." Didn't say after our kind, but in
[55:10] our image. Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; And after our likeness,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And he did so. And let them have
[55:17] dominion over all these other kinds.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; The fowl and the cattle and over all the
[55:24] earth. And so God created man in his own
[55:28] image, in the image of God created he
[55:31] him. Male and female created he them.
[55:34] And apostle Paul says, "Now that body
[55:36] was a seed, right?
[55:41] lifebearing seed is the centerpiece of
[55:45] the Bible.
[55:48] I want you to listen very carefully
[55:49] because I have some serious things to
[55:52] say.
[55:55] Someone has said and I just read they
[55:57] have never
[55:59] there have never been any instances of
[56:03] any plant growing from a kernel of corn.
[56:07] The same law, the same law
[56:10] uh any instance of any plant growing
[56:14] from a kernel of corn, the same law is
[56:16] observed with all other form farm crops
[56:20] and in fact all forms of life during the
[56:24] past 5,000 years for which written
[56:26] records are available. There are no
[56:29] documented reports of any new species of
[56:34] life that have ever been observed to
[56:36] have formed from any other species. And
[56:40] the reason I just read that little
[56:42] paragraph is because God kept saying
[56:45] after their kind,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; after its kind, after his kind. And that
[56:51] is that is God's word. And he put
[56:55] certain boundaries and a law concerning
[56:57] it. So seed giving forth its substance
[57:02] in the spring,
[57:05] just some comments on seed. Seed
[57:07] bringing forth or giving forth its
[57:09] substance into the earth and bringing
[57:12] forth new life in the spring
[57:15] is to us a reminder of the resurrection.
[57:20] seed sending forth this life force
[57:23] confirms to us that life is stronger
[57:25] than death.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; That tender little plant which the
[57:30] prophet says where's the grass the
[57:32] greenest. It's at the far edge of the
[57:35] concrete because it springs up under
[57:38] that concrete and it will move as long
[57:41] and as far as it needs to move to get to
[57:43] the edge because the sun is calling for
[57:45] it.
[57:47] Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; But when we see that, it's speaking to
[57:50] us.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; When we see the tender life coming from
[57:54] the seed, it manifests such
[57:56] indescribable strength and power over
[58:00] death.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And it reminds us and and if need be, it
[58:05] will break through stones. It will break
[58:08] through black top. And it'll find a
[58:11] crack someplace or even push it up.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the strength. And if
[58:17] you try to put that together in your
[58:19] mind, how does this little tender thing
[58:22] that all is so soft and pliable manage
[58:25] to keep pushing that black top till
[58:26] there's a hump in it
[58:28] &gt;&gt; and the two of them or one is so will
[58:30] look so durable, so strong, and yet the
[58:33] little plant will bring wind its way up
[58:35] through there. It speaks to us of the
[58:38] strength that life has, the endurance of
[58:41] it.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And it and it speaks to us of God's
[58:44] promise.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; God promised Noah, he said to Noah when
[58:51] he when he spoke to him, he says, "And
[58:53] behold, I will establish my covenant
[58:56] with you and with your seed after you."
[59:00] That's what was in God's mind
[59:02] &gt;&gt; when he came to Abraham. And the promise
[59:06] that he that that he made to Abraham,
[59:09] the centerpiece of that promise was to
[59:11] you and your seed after you.
[59:15] And the Lord appeared to Abram and said,
[59:18] "Unto thy seed
[59:20] &gt;&gt; will I give this land, and there builded
[59:22] he an altar unto the Lord that appeared
[59:24] to him." The apostle Paul is declaring
[59:28] that God has another process or law in
[59:32] bringing forth his children when he
[59:34] wrote and spoke this to the Romans. Not
[59:37] as though the word of God have taken
[59:38] none effect. For they are not all Israel
[59:42] which are of Israel.
[59:45] Now he's talking about they're not all
[59:48] Israel that are of that are of Israel.
[59:51] Neither because they are the seed of
[59:53] Abraham are they all children.
[59:57] But in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[1:00:01] So now we see a a line of demarcation
[1:00:04] taking place. Not all that are Israel.
[1:00:07] Not all who come through the physical
[1:00:09] lineage of of Abraham. Not all are are
[1:00:13] Israel that are of Israel because the
[1:00:16] children now he's talking about the
[1:00:18] children. The children are accounted of
[1:00:22] the promise. So now it's a promise
[1:00:26] that's bringing forth children.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; The promise,
[1:00:31] not just the sperm of a human, but the
[1:00:34] promise is bringing forth. It's another
[1:00:36] breed. It's another species. It's
[1:00:39] another kind
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; that will bring forth after its kind.
[1:00:44] And it can only be the kind of the one
[1:00:46] from where the promise originated.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; So that is they which are the children
[1:00:53] of the flesh. These are not the children
[1:00:56] of God but the children of the promise
[1:01:00] are counted for seed.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; See how important this is to God that
[1:01:06] even when God made the promise, his
[1:01:09] thought was on the seed.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I will use this as a tool to bring seed,
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; children to me. Children which will be
[1:01:20] of the promise. And so now we have a a
[1:01:23] process that is taking place. The law
[1:01:27] the law the law that brought forth the
[1:01:31] God man. It was the law. It was the law
[1:01:35] that brought forth Jesus Christ. The God
[1:01:38] man. It wasn't it wasn't just an
[1:01:41] accident. It wasn't, you know, that
[1:01:44] someone had a a good idea or someone
[1:01:46] even had a great desire. So, we need a
[1:01:48] Messiah. It wasn't that. And that God
[1:01:51] yielded to their crying and their
[1:01:53] desires. But the Bible says this. Now,
[1:01:57] watch the process. I'm moving very, very
[1:02:00] as accurately as I know how. The process
[1:02:04] because I'm speaking of the law of
[1:02:06] reproduction.
[1:02:08] Not as we have our children, but the law
[1:02:11] of reproduction is God.
[1:02:14] Friends, this world is a troubled place.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And you know, this isn't the this isn't
[1:02:21] our home.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And the spirit of God
[1:02:27] moved upon the prophets, moved upon the
[1:02:31] prophets to speak the word." Please
[1:02:34] watch the process closely. For the
[1:02:36] prophecy came not in old time,
[1:02:40] speaks the apostle Peter. It did not
[1:02:43] come in old time by the will of man, but
[1:02:46] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[1:02:51] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; They didn't they didn't speak just to
[1:02:56] write us a book and to give us some
[1:02:57] comforting words or to give us some
[1:02:59] instruction or better life. They spoke
[1:03:02] because God was using this this method,
[1:03:06] this process to bring forth of his own
[1:03:10] kind.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Because of the fall, Adam couldn't do
[1:03:14] it. Adam and Eve couldn't do it. No
[1:03:16] other person could do it from that time
[1:03:18] forward. God had to start a new
[1:03:21] creation. And that new creation had to
[1:03:24] come by the word of God. So he moved
[1:03:27] upon the holy men of old and spoke the
[1:03:31] word of promise.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And they came and spake as they were
[1:03:39] moved by the Holy Ghost. And the word
[1:03:42] moved is that they were making an
[1:03:44] announcement.
[1:03:46] This wasn't just some casual
[1:03:48] information. They were making
[1:03:50] announcement. Behold, behold, a virgin
[1:03:53] shall conceive. And they they made these
[1:03:56] announcements. They were moved by the
[1:03:58] burden of the word. They were moved to
[1:04:01] bring forth whatever the word was
[1:04:03] speaking in itself. The burden of the
[1:04:06] word of the Lord moved through the
[1:04:07] prophets until the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:04:11] directly through them. In Isaiah, he was
[1:04:14] one and there are many. But in Isaiah
[1:04:17] 7:14, therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:04:21] give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall
[1:04:24] conceive and bring a son, and shall call
[1:04:27] his name Emanuel. Now, I'm in a process.
[1:04:31] This is this is a law. I'm taking you
[1:04:35] through the steps of the law of another
[1:04:39] reproduction
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; of the God man.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; And he shall bring forth.
[1:04:46] And then the scripture says Isaiah
[1:04:48] again, "And unto us a child is born.
[1:04:51] Unto us a son is given, and the
[1:04:54] government shall be upon his shoulder,
[1:04:56] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:04:58] counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:05:00] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[1:05:04] And I asked the question, what process
[1:05:07] is it that took precedence
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; over the law of human reproduction?
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; We're moving through it right now,
[1:05:16] friends. This is not story time. Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; This is reality time.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; And God wants us perhaps to just get a a
[1:05:27] nugget, not a nugget of information,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; not something that is is, you know, just
[1:05:32] something new. Oh, that was wonderful.
[1:05:35] That isn't what I want. I would like
[1:05:37] that God would uh anchor into your heart
[1:05:41] a principle of his word and a principle
[1:05:44] of this law. This process of
[1:05:46] reproduction so that you can see
[1:05:48] yourself in that process.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Not in church,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; not in the choir, not in anything else,
[1:05:56] but see yourself in the process of the
[1:05:59] reproduction
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; of the God man.
[1:06:09] unto us a child is born
[1:06:12] and then the process moves forward.
[1:06:16] The process of the human life that is
[1:06:19] now it is the spiritual law of
[1:06:24] reproduction is taking place and
[1:06:27] precedence over the law of nature
[1:06:29] itself.
[1:06:30] And the angel answered and said unto her
[1:06:36] to Mary,
[1:06:38] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
[1:06:41] the power of the highest shall
[1:06:42] overshadow thee. It's just a young girl,
[1:06:48] unlike any other young lady in this
[1:06:51] congregation.
[1:06:53] Only this was her part,
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; and she does not have your part. But
[1:07:00] this was her part and she could not act
[1:07:03] out that part unless the promise had
[1:07:07] been spoken.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Holy men of God spake as they were
[1:07:12] moved. Prophets by the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; They were moved by God because God knew
[1:07:19] in his wisdom on down the road was going
[1:07:22] to rise one that was going to take that
[1:07:24] and believe it. Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; And God was in the process of bringing
[1:07:29] forth. He said, "This is how I'll bring
[1:07:31] forth my kind."
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; I'll bring forth God people.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; I'll bring forth God men and women.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; I might fail. You might fail, but God
[1:07:46] will not fail.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; He will have that family.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; He will have those children. and they
[1:07:53] are God people.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Years ago when the hippies were around
[1:07:57] and they uh even moved me because they
[1:08:00] said Jesus people and I thought that's a
[1:08:03] wonderful thing. Jesus people that's
[1:08:05] what the world really needs is Jesus
[1:08:08] people a God man.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; And the power of the highest shall
[1:08:16] overshadow thee. And therefore also that
[1:08:19] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[1:08:22] shall be called the son of God.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; It's a whole different specy,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; whole different process.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Even the process is different.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Nobody saw a twinkle in Mary's eye.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost overshadowed her.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; This isn't something where you have to
[1:08:45] have a shiver down your spine.
[1:08:48] or any emotional thing.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet came and tried to
[1:08:51] jerk us away from that.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; People were so caught up. Oh, oh, I feel
[1:08:56] it.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I sat in the church once, not to mock
[1:09:01] the brother. He's a very, very dear
[1:09:03] friend. In fact, as I lived in their
[1:09:05] home as a son, as a boy, not as a son,
[1:09:08] but as a boy, boarded out in their home.
[1:09:12] And when he used to, you know, just
[1:09:14] during his service sometime, he just his
[1:09:17] hand would shake like that. He'd just
[1:09:19] feel something in his hand would shake.
[1:09:21] It's fine. One day he got up and
[1:09:23] testified. I never forgot it.
[1:09:27] I had to smile. He said, "You know,
[1:09:31] when I got married, that was a thrill."
[1:09:35] He said, "And when I got saved, that was
[1:09:37] a thrill." But he says, "When I got
[1:09:40] this,"
[1:09:42] he thought that was the biggest thrill
[1:09:43] of them all. I just couldn't grasp it.
[1:09:47] How they could equate that with getting
[1:09:49] saved
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; or equate that with getting married.
[1:09:58] I was with a f Pentecost was so given
[1:10:00] over to that,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; right? I was talking to a fellow and I I
[1:10:06] took a there was a little picture in a
[1:10:08] metal frame and I just took it and when
[1:10:10] I took it it it opened up, you know, and
[1:10:13] metal came against metal just went
[1:10:14] click. He said, "Did you hear that?" I
[1:10:17] said, "Well, yeah." He said, "You got
[1:10:18] something wrong with your back." I said,
[1:10:20] "No, it was this right here."
[1:10:23] No, no, no. He said, "You got something
[1:10:24] wrong with your back." Well, I may have
[1:10:27] something wrong with my back, but it
[1:10:28] wasn't that sound because that was the
[1:10:30] sound of that frame going click, click.
[1:10:33] people were all full of hookie spooks
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and then they couldn't get a hold of God
[1:10:37] because they had to have you know
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; had to have that kind of hookie spook
[1:10:42] had to and then that's why they had to
[1:10:43] we were talking here uh just this last
[1:10:46] week and and and someone was telling us
[1:10:48] about how they were forcing them to get
[1:10:50] the Holy Spirit. You have to get the
[1:10:51] Holy Spirit. You have to speak in
[1:10:52] tongues. You have to speak in tongues.
[1:10:54] Just say this. Say this. Say this. Say
[1:10:55] this. Say this. And then and then they'd
[1:10:57] be so thrilled if they just said it.
[1:11:00] Well, you got it. And brother Brandham
[1:11:03] comes along says they thought they had
[1:11:05] it,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; but they didn't have it.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; The Quakers had to fall and they had to
[1:11:10] shake and other people had to do this
[1:11:12] and other people had to do that and had
[1:11:13] to speak in tongues and even in the
[1:11:15] message there's certain things you have
[1:11:17] to do. No, it's not that way, friends.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; comes down into the person and it has
[1:11:24] nothing to do with this flesh right here
[1:11:26] at all. Nothing to do with this body.
[1:11:28] It's another seed. It's another life.
[1:11:32] It's another process.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that we in this
[1:11:35] life, in this body, don't get happy,
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; clap our hands, shout, rejoice. I
[1:11:41] believe that we're supposed to do all
[1:11:42] those things. Anything that doesn't show
[1:11:44] emotion is dead.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; So, we're not against that. But that
[1:11:48] isn't that isn't the sign that it's
[1:11:50] there.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And then uh and then the scripture says,
[1:11:56] now we're watching this. and the and
[1:11:59] behold thy cousin Elizabeth. She also
[1:12:02] hath conceived a son in her old age. Now
[1:12:05] that was the other process.
[1:12:09] That was the other law.
[1:12:11] She was receiving that son by
[1:12:13] Zachcharias.
[1:12:16] Mary had a son that was of no man
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and both were coming along at the same
[1:12:22] time.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; One by the law of nature, but one by the
[1:12:27] law of creation.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; The new creation was on its way.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And from that seed, from this seed here
[1:12:36] from John, if if he would be married and
[1:12:38] have children, it would all follow the
[1:12:41] natural birth after their kind.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; But by this one, he was going to bring
[1:12:46] forth of another kind.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] You want me to say it?
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Mary didn't have a man to bring forth
[1:13:00] children and Jesus didn't have a woman.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Created after their own kind.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; A process was on its way. Instituted by
[1:13:13] God Almighty. And nothing would change
[1:13:15] that.
[1:13:19] And so
[1:13:23] for nothing for with God nothing shall
[1:13:26] be impossible. And Mary said, "Behold
[1:13:30] the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me
[1:13:34] according to thy word and the angel
[1:13:37] departed from her." I thought that was
[1:13:39] so remarkable. You know friends, we
[1:13:41] don't need to have big long discourses.
[1:13:44] We don't have to read, you know,
[1:13:47] multitudes of books. But when the word
[1:13:50] of God is spoken, you need to say as
[1:13:53] Mary
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; from a from a heart of faith, be it unto
[1:13:58] me
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; according to this word,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; be it unto me. And when she said that,
[1:14:03] be it unto me according to the word, the
[1:14:05] Bible says, and the angel departed.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, God was saying, that's
[1:14:10] it.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's all I need to hear. Hallelujah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; The process is moving on.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; All you have to say is be it unto me
[1:14:23] according to your word and it's over.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Someone the law of reproduction is
[1:14:33] moving forward.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And the angel departed.
[1:14:37] And the scripture says also, "And
[1:14:39] blessed is is she that believed, for
[1:14:42] there shall be a performance." Oh, I
[1:14:45] love this positive gospel. Don't you?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; There shall be a performance of those
[1:14:51] things which were told her from the
[1:14:55] Lord.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; That's the process.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth another kind.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; So thankful for this kind.
[1:15:06] Yes,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; and the sea will not be air.
[1:15:12] Prophet said, "And God made both egg and
[1:15:14] germ."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; He created both in the womb of Mary.
[1:15:19] And that man was nothing was not nothing
[1:15:23] but God himself made flesh and dwelt
[1:15:25] among us. Emmanuel, not just a fine man,
[1:15:30] a prophet. He was a fine man and
[1:15:33] prophet, not a teacher, a theologian.
[1:15:36] Oh, he might have been all that. He was
[1:15:39] all in all, but above all that, he was
[1:15:42] God himself.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible said we are saved by the blood
[1:15:48] of God,
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Not a third person or a second person,
[1:15:54] but the person God himself.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; All glory, all hail the name of Jesus.
[1:16:01] Let angels prostrate fall.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Like the ransomed of the Lord say so.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; This is a new man, a new species.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And from his seed, from his seed will
[1:16:14] come more of his own kind.
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; That's a law of God. It has to produce
[1:16:23] after its own kind. Let every seed bring
[1:16:26] forth of its own kind.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Hope I'm not hope I'm not yelling too
[1:16:34] loud for you.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; In the Leodysian church age, he said the
[1:16:39] new creation. It's another creation
[1:16:42] distinct from the old creation. He is
[1:16:46] the first of that creation. He was God
[1:16:49] created in the form of man. Now by his
[1:16:53] spirit he is creating many sons unto
[1:16:56] himself. God the creator creating
[1:17:00] himself a part of his creation which I
[1:17:02] read last Sunday but so fitting now that
[1:17:07] comes more down to our address
[1:17:10] personally
[1:17:12] as Jesus moved through his life
[1:17:16] now he it's true
[1:17:19] it's true he's another kind he's another
[1:17:22] specy
[1:17:24] he's a new creation
[1:17:27] never was a man like this man.
[1:17:30] Never was a man spake like this man.
[1:17:34] But now as he moved, it wasn't just
[1:17:37] Isaiah said unto us, a son is given.
[1:17:42] It wasn't just that. There were many
[1:17:43] others
[1:17:45] inspired words sent from his father. His
[1:17:49] the breath of his father issued out
[1:17:51] through the prophets. And these words
[1:17:54] also must be fulfilled. And so the Bible
[1:17:57] says, and a principle I want to really
[1:18:00] lay down here today, he took upon
[1:18:02] himself.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; He took
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; upon himself.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't imposed on him.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; He took upon himself the form of a
[1:18:16] servant,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; the form of a man.
[1:18:24] The Bible tells us that he literally
[1:18:28] took on himself.
[1:18:30] I'm putting it in my words. He literally
[1:18:32] took on himself humanity.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; But by the same process that he took
[1:18:39] upon himself humanity
[1:18:42] is the same process that God instituted
[1:18:46] and inaugurated through Christ. But he
[1:18:49] instituted that process. The same
[1:18:52] process that you will come into eternal
[1:18:56] life.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; You will you are being reproduced by the
[1:19:03] law of reproduction that God
[1:19:07] established at this time. And this was
[1:19:08] the this was the example seed. This was
[1:19:11] the example seed.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; And Jesus moved through life. He
[1:19:17] continually referred to the scriptures.
[1:19:21] The scriptures which are the very
[1:19:22] creative word of God being fulfilled.
[1:19:26] His life was the word of God in season.
[1:19:32] The word for his season. It was that
[1:19:35] word in motion.
[1:19:38] Philippians says Paul writing to the
[1:19:41] Philippians. Let let
[1:19:44] I looked and I wrestled all around
[1:19:48] for this. Let
[1:19:50] let this mind. Once again, it's a
[1:19:54] conscious decision.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; It's not that God's imposing it on you
[1:19:57] or you're going to get a shake and a
[1:19:59] jiggle and something down your spine and
[1:20:01] suddenly have it. No, this is something
[1:20:03] you do today. It's something you wake up
[1:20:05] and do tomorrow. It's something that God
[1:20:08] is part of God's process. And he's
[1:20:10] telling us through the Apostle Paul, you
[1:20:14] let
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; this mind be in you.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; How many other things we let be in our
[1:20:21] minds and in our thoughts? But the
[1:20:23] Apostle Paul saying, "Let this mind be
[1:20:26] in you which was in Christ." Isn't this
[1:20:29] amazing? He's saying literally you can
[1:20:33] have the mind of Christ.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Otherwise it would be without any
[1:20:38] there'd be no objective in saying
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; let this mind be in you if it wasn't
[1:20:43] possible.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't this glorious?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Here we sit today with this glorious uh
[1:20:51] thing being presented to us. Yes, we may
[1:20:54] at some times, you know, uh I I I trust
[1:20:57] we'd be able to walk walk in it, but
[1:20:59] this is my desire that the mind of
[1:21:02] Christ would control
[1:21:05] this body of believers, this bride body
[1:21:08] of believers, that the mind of Christ
[1:21:10] would control our daily lives in our
[1:21:14] action. And I'm not so concerned about
[1:21:15] when you're sitting here in church, but
[1:21:17] it's when we're out there that the mind
[1:21:19] of Christ in the job making decisions,
[1:21:23] raising our families, doing all the
[1:21:25] things we have to do. Oh God, if there
[1:21:28] ever was a time we needed the mind of
[1:21:30] Christ, it's today. Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it
[1:21:40] not robbery to be equal with God, but
[1:21:44] listen closely, made himself
[1:21:49] of no reputation.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; He went there by his own conscious,
[1:21:55] conscious decision and choosing. He made
[1:21:59] himself
[1:22:02] You know, so often we like to look at
[1:22:04] our weaknesses and failures and say,
[1:22:06] "Oh, well, you know, whatever God wants,
[1:22:08] God make me whatever he wants me to be."
[1:22:10] No, no, no. It's not all God's part.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; There's things for us to do
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; to make conscious decisions. Let this
[1:22:18] mind be in you. When you're rattling off
[1:22:21] something that hasn't come from the Holy
[1:22:23] Spirit, you should take this scripture.
[1:22:25] Let this mind be in you. Would Jesus say
[1:22:28] that? Would Jesus do that? Would Jesus
[1:22:30] think that? If our decision is no, he
[1:22:33] wouldn't, then it's up to us to turn
[1:22:35] aside from that and think his thoughts.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And his thoughts is his word. So it's
[1:22:41] very clear.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus took the elements. Now watch
[1:22:47] closely
[1:22:49] because all these scriptures which I'm
[1:22:52] still going to come to in just a moment.
[1:22:56] Jesus literally now took the elements of
[1:22:59] this supernatural
[1:23:03] sinless body.
[1:23:08] This is a incredibly marvelous
[1:23:13] thing that God is doing
[1:23:16] because he started with a God egg
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and a God germ,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; right? bringing forth a good man.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; But he allowed that man to be formed in
[1:23:30] a woman
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; because of what happened in the garden.
[1:23:34] And she fell and and and another seed
[1:23:38] came through the woman.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; A man called Cain.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want to even get into it, but if
[1:23:46] you can get my point. So, so they were
[1:23:49] not able to bring forth a god kind in
[1:23:52] the image of God. He made them in the
[1:23:54] image of God, but they fell. And so now
[1:23:58] the woman has a womb. The only the only
[1:24:01] one that could handle the seed like that
[1:24:04] made for seed.
[1:24:08] And the serpent came to her and sowed
[1:24:11] seed. Satan using the instrumentality
[1:24:14] of that enemy
[1:24:17] and swed seed in her womb and her
[1:24:20] husband took her quickly and swed seed
[1:24:22] in her womb. Seed is the centerpiece of
[1:24:25] creation.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Everything rests upon this. That's why
[1:24:29] when God gave first promise to the first
[1:24:32] man of promise Abraham to you and your
[1:24:34] seed,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; seed is a thing friends. Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; It hasn't got a whole lot of importance
[1:24:40] to a lot of people today, but in the
[1:24:42] eyes and the mind of God,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; it's called in the word precious seed.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And now she's sown with this seed. And
[1:24:52] so she ate of the things of the earth.
[1:24:55] Eve did as so did Mary. But now we've
[1:24:59] got a God germ
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; and a God egg. Right.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; A new creation of God that's bringing
[1:25:07] forth a God man. But that God man is
[1:25:11] being nourished of the elements of the
[1:25:13] cursed earth.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; So it's a new creation. But his body
[1:25:20] he's taking to himself. God himself is
[1:25:23] taking the elements of a cursed earth.
[1:25:25] The whole earth was cursed.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; You following me?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] And when that body came forth, but it
[1:25:36] was the life
[1:25:38] he was a God man and it was that life
[1:25:43] that's why as he began his movement
[1:25:45] through earth.
[1:25:48] It was a very thought in the minds of
[1:25:50] God, he knew what had been breathed
[1:25:54] through the prophets was the word of
[1:25:56] God. and those words that were for his
[1:25:59] season. He must take this body by that
[1:26:03] word and fulfill every one of those
[1:26:06] words at each station. And he would say,
[1:26:08] "How then shall the scriptures be
[1:26:11] fulfilled that it might be fulfilled?"
[1:26:14] He went here that it might be fulfilled.
[1:26:16] He went and lived in Nazareth that it
[1:26:19] might be fulfilled even as a child, as a
[1:26:21] babe that took him to Egypt, that he
[1:26:24] might be fulfilled. out of Egypt have I
[1:26:26] called my son.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; That it might be fulfilled. And so what
[1:26:30] is we say? Oh, that was the word of the
[1:26:32] prophet. That was the word of the
[1:26:33] prophet. No. No. Now those words are
[1:26:35] being lived out
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; through a man.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's putting on that
[1:26:42] word
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; in his daily life.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; His daily eating, his daily sleeping.
[1:26:49] He's putting on
[1:26:52] that word of life. that word that has
[1:26:55] been spoken through the prophets because
[1:26:56] he must take this body
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; to Calvary and that part of the earth
[1:27:03] must be redeemed.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And he took it to the washing and was
[1:27:08] baptized by John and came to Calvary. He
[1:27:11] must He must not just be washed. He must
[1:27:14] come to the death. He must take this
[1:27:16] earth to the death
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; and to the grave
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; and bring it back forth into the
[1:27:23] resurrection
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; and bring that earth back and make it
[1:27:28] subject to the law of supernatural
[1:27:31] reproduction.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Have you followed me?
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you have.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; And you came
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; condemned.
[1:27:45] Your daddy was condemned. Your mama was
[1:27:47] condemned. Your grandparents were
[1:27:49] condemned. You came from generations
[1:27:53] from the beginning condemned
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; with no hope at all. The prophet says,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; we're condemned creatures
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; in a body. Look at us.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Losing our hair, gray, all kinds of
[1:28:07] things. You can fix it up all you want,
[1:28:09] but you're still going the same
[1:28:10] direction. And if time goes on, you'll
[1:28:13] all end up on a slab
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; in some funeral mortuary
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; because and if you the only way you can
[1:28:21] change change that process is by
[1:28:27] the holy word
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; that's been spoken and a holy prophet
[1:28:31] that came in this time to identify the
[1:28:35] holst promise for this hour. Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And if God reveals that promise to you,
[1:28:41] then you have a life because you're
[1:28:43] coming into a different process and
[1:28:45] you're bringing this old cursed body to
[1:28:48] eternal life
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; through the law of reproduction.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; This isn't a light message, folks.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to ponder that.
[1:29:03] Very deep. And so now it's up to you and
[1:29:07] you should be saying in view of Jesus
[1:29:10] the first of the man the God mankind
[1:29:14] him his mind
[1:29:17] let this mind be in you right
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; what mind what was spoken for this hour
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; there are certain specific promises that
[1:29:28] are spoken I haven't got time to go into
[1:29:31] the oil you read the message I'm here to
[1:29:33] alert you when you do when you hear it
[1:29:36] when you hear it across the pulpit you
[1:29:38] want to garn those things that are
[1:29:39] promises for this hour
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; I'll give you one we shall all be
[1:29:45] changed
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; and this is its season
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; and that you ought to be saying that it
[1:29:54] might be fulfilled
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; which was spoken of the by the Lord
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; through the first messenger we shall all
[1:30:02] be changed
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; hallelujah Yeah,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; that is my promise for this day.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And by that faith in that word that's
[1:30:12] been confirmed by that messenger, we
[1:30:14] move
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; and we take this body of this cursed
[1:30:19] earth and we're bringing it to immortal
[1:30:21] life, a different law, a different
[1:30:24] process.
[1:30:28] By our mothers we die.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; But by God through Jesus Christ we live.
[1:30:45] Jesus took the elements
[1:30:48] that made up his body
[1:30:51] beyond the law of nature. He took it in
[1:30:55] this process until it was beyond the law
[1:30:58] of nature. And I'll tell you my brothers
[1:31:01] and sisters, according to this message
[1:31:04] which we have confirmed to us,
[1:31:06] vindicated to us today by pillar of
[1:31:08] fire, there's going to be a group of
[1:31:10] people that are going to be ready. And
[1:31:12] the longer I live, I I see the fewer
[1:31:15] there will be. But there's going to be a
[1:31:17] few that's going to take this body of
[1:31:20] these elements that came through the
[1:31:21] natural law, natural process, but
[1:31:24] they're going to literally take it
[1:31:26] beyond the reach of death.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; They're going to break.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And they that believe it now, and it's a
[1:31:34] revelation to you, we have already
[1:31:36] broken that law.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Death has no power. for the redeemed
[1:31:43] ones.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:31:50] scripture says
[1:31:55] of Jesus, he asked the questions.
[1:31:59] He says, "Now all this was done."
[1:32:02] Matthew 1:21-22
[1:32:04] that it might be fulfilled
[1:32:07] 2 and 15.
[1:32:10] that it might be fulfilled which is
[1:32:12] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[1:32:15] out of Egypt do I call my son Matthew
[1:32:18] 2:23 that it might be fulfilled which
[1:32:20] was spoken of prophets he shall be
[1:32:22] called a Nazarene 4 and4 Matthew that it
[1:32:25] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:32:27] the prophet Isaiah 8:17 that it might be
[1:32:31] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah
[1:32:33] himself took our infirmities and bore
[1:32:35] our sicknesses that it might be
[1:32:38] fulfilled Matthew 12:17 which was spoken
[1:32:41] by Isaiah the prophet, saying, Isaiah
[1:32:43] spoke so much of him. And in 13:35, that
[1:32:46] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[1:32:48] by the prophet, saying, I will open my
[1:32:50] mouth in parables, and I will utter
[1:32:52] things which have been kept secret from
[1:32:54] the foundation of the world. Matthew
[1:32:56] 21:4, all of this was done that it might
[1:32:59] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:33:01] prophet, saying, he kept referring to
[1:33:04] it. He wasn't he wasn't trying to teach
[1:33:07] his disciples what the prophet said.
[1:33:10] He was telling them and identifying.
[1:33:12] They couldn't identify it, but he was
[1:33:14] letting them know what what I'm going
[1:33:17] through now, what I'm living is that
[1:33:20] scripture.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; What was he doing in my language today?
[1:33:27] He was putting on
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; that scripture
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; consciously
[1:33:35] when even they tried to have him escape
[1:33:38] the agonies of the cross.
[1:33:41] And Jesus said, "Then how then shall the
[1:33:46] scriptures be fulfilled that thus it
[1:33:50] must be?" He gave himself to it.
[1:33:54] It wasn't God, you know, pushing him
[1:33:57] into Gethsemane. He went to Gethsemane.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was putting on the word
[1:34:03] of God.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; You know, you ought to see yourself in a
[1:34:07] different light today.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; What are you doing here today? I'm
[1:34:10] actually putting on the word of God that
[1:34:12] says I ought to assemble myself
[1:34:14] together. And the more so, as I see the
[1:34:17] day approaching, that it might be
[1:34:19] fulfilled. I'm sitting here today
[1:34:25] That's the only time it'll do you any
[1:34:27] good
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; because there's multitudes and
[1:34:29] multitudes sitting in churches today
[1:34:31] means nothing to them because it's not
[1:34:33] the mind of Christ. They're haven't even
[1:34:35] got it in their conscious awareness
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; and it's not just saying oh this nice
[1:34:39] little phrasing that we that we should
[1:34:41] gather ourselves together and we have a
[1:34:43] prophet in this day say we ought to be
[1:34:45] waiting at the doors
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; when waiting for those doors to open.
[1:34:53] Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; God has always given us an example and
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ was that example for us.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; He lived his entire life
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; putting on the word.
[1:35:13] Apostle Paul said in the Romans, for the
[1:35:14] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:35:17] Jesus, for that law,
[1:35:20] the law
[1:35:22] of the spirit of life that was in Christ
[1:35:25] Jesus, that law has made you free
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; from the law of sin and death.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; That law that was operating in Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ
[1:35:42] in you
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; has made you free
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; from another law and the law of sin and
[1:35:47] death.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Is that God's word?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Is that God's word?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Take that one out and pin it on your
[1:35:55] wall if you wish to.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and2
[1:36:00] literally speaking,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; putting on immortality.
[1:36:07] See, the reason I'm preaching this today
[1:36:08] is because too many are just sitting
[1:36:12] back. Yeah, we're believers. You know,
[1:36:14] Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, and Revelation,
[1:36:17] they're just going on their way and busy
[1:36:20] in their daily work, etc., etc., and are
[1:36:23] not conscious
[1:36:26] in the day today
[1:36:28] that I'm here to put on
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; immortality.
[1:36:34] And if you're walking in the light as he
[1:36:38] is in the light, you will I'm I'm adding
[1:36:40] this last phrase, you will not be left
[1:36:42] behind.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; If you're walking in the light
[1:36:50] as he is in the light. So the law of
[1:36:53] reproduction
[1:36:56] for it became him of whom are all
[1:36:59] things. Now I'm taking another step.
[1:37:02] It became him. Apostle Paul said in
[1:37:04] Hebrews 2:10,
[1:37:06] became him for whom are all things and
[1:37:10] by whom are all things in bringing many
[1:37:14] sons
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; unto glory.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Not bringing many sons into the world,
[1:37:21] bringing many sons unto glory.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Hello sons and daughters.
[1:37:30] Hello. The progeny of this promise.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; This is why he's here. This is why he
[1:37:36] came. It became him.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; This was his calling. This was his
[1:37:40] purpose. Say, what was the purpose of
[1:37:42] Jesus Christ? To die and go to Calvary
[1:37:45] and and to die to death, go to the grave
[1:37:46] and raise. That's part of it. But if
[1:37:49] that's all there was to it, it certainly
[1:37:51] would have not fulfilled the desire of
[1:37:54] God.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; When he says, "Where's my family?
[1:37:56] Where's my household? It became him to
[1:37:59] bring forth many sons and daughters. Oh,
[1:38:02] how glorious, friends
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; that we're seated here today.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And this became his whole his whole I
[1:38:12] won't even say his ambition, but this
[1:38:14] became his whole objective. This was his
[1:38:16] objective
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; to bring forth sons and daughters
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God. how the heart
[1:38:23] of God must beat today when he sees a a
[1:38:27] an audience of people like this that
[1:38:29] have come here to hear the word. Lay it
[1:38:32] down. I want to do it. I want to live
[1:38:35] it.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; See, we're not here to hear it. We're
[1:38:38] here to do it.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; It's not hearing it that puts on
[1:38:41] immortality. It's doing it.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Living out that scripture.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:00] Children by the original spoken word.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Children
[1:39:08] by the original
[1:39:10] spoken word.
[1:39:14] I understand we have about 3,000 plus
[1:39:17] denominations registered in the world.
[1:39:21] We have
[1:39:23] hundreds of millions of people
[1:39:26] and they're sincere.
[1:39:29] They pray and they give huge amounts
[1:39:32] and build grand edififices
[1:39:36] of a test as a testament to what they
[1:39:38] believe.
[1:39:41] I spoke to my wife just on the way here.
[1:39:44] I've said it here over this pulpit,
[1:39:47] but it has become more
[1:39:50] pronounced to me than ever before.
[1:39:56] If this message that was spoken was not
[1:40:00] attested to
[1:40:03] by God,
[1:40:05] the pillar of fire and the supernatural
[1:40:09] visions.
[1:40:12] I listened to brother Brandham coming to
[1:40:13] church this morning. He's talking about
[1:40:14] the visions.
[1:40:16] If we didn't have a prophet that had the
[1:40:19] visions
[1:40:21] and spoke it and for all these years the
[1:40:24] people said, "It's true.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; It's true. It's true."
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; In prayer last night
[1:40:35] that so touched me. I said, "God, we
[1:40:38] have a message that's an absolute.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow that message to the
[1:40:44] letter
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; because you attested to it and they said
[1:40:48] it's true.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Only truth
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; will stand."
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And then we put that on and we come into
[1:40:58] immortal life. It will bring us to our
[1:41:01] destination, friends. And after all is
[1:41:03] said and done.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm just giving you some
[1:41:06] personal.
[1:41:08] I just had to quietly sing.
[1:41:11] This world is not my home.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And how can I say that, friends? How can
[1:41:20] you say it? It's not just a song with
[1:41:23] some harmony to it and melody.
[1:41:26] This world is not my home. Because
[1:41:30] you have to have that assurance within
[1:41:32] you. I am putting on immortality
[1:41:35] by every word of God that is spoken. I'm
[1:41:38] here to do it. I'm here not just to hear
[1:41:41] it. I'm here to do it. And by doing it,
[1:41:44] I'm living out that word. I'm that word
[1:41:47] is the eternal word of God. Jesus said,
[1:41:49] "Heavens and earth will pass away. My
[1:41:50] word will never pass away." In other
[1:41:52] words, that seed will never pass away.
[1:41:54] That seed when it's dropped in the right
[1:41:56] place, it's going to bring the same
[1:41:57] kind.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And that kind doesn't die.
[1:42:03] So I said to my wife coming to church,
[1:42:06] if this message didn't have that
[1:42:09] vindication,
[1:42:10] we have nothing more than everybody
[1:42:12] else.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And I would just say to you, go and
[1:42:16] choose the best you can find and get
[1:42:18] along through life.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; It is that visitation
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; or call vindication or call pillar of
[1:42:25] fire or call the supernatural that is
[1:42:28] the one thing that separates us from
[1:42:30] everything else. Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; And that's why when they said to brother
[1:42:35] Brandham, "We're all the same." And he
[1:42:36] said, "We're not the same."
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, how glad I am. We're not the same.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not finished. Having brought
[1:42:47] you to that point, then what is it that
[1:42:50] we have? We have something that came
[1:42:54] original.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Had not been here before.
[1:42:59] This is I I I I hope you don't
[1:43:01] misunderstand me, but I'm going to make
[1:43:03] a strong statement. That's what
[1:43:05] separates us from every other movement
[1:43:08] on earth because they do not have an
[1:43:11] original word.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; We have an original message.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; And so when he came to speak that he
[1:43:19] called it the spoken word is the
[1:43:22] original
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; seed.
[1:43:25] Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] It's the original seed. It's a seed for
[1:43:30] the new species. It's a seed for you in
[1:43:33] this day. It's to tell you there's
[1:43:35] another process, the law of reproduction
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; by the spoken word of God.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; The world is full of questions and
[1:43:51] theories,
[1:43:53] but I'm speaking of children by the
[1:43:55] spoken word.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; We may not be the smartest people on
[1:44:00] earth. We may not have
[1:44:02] things that other people have or we may
[1:44:05] have more than other people have. That's
[1:44:07] irrelevant
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; to me. This building and all the
[1:44:12] accessories and everything means
[1:44:13] nothing. Everything to me is the
[1:44:16] original seed,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; the original life.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; This process of the law
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; of reproduction.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Appreciate your time.
[1:44:29] And in the message trying to do God a
[1:44:31] service, he said, "And it's my purpose
[1:44:34] here now to try to get every man not to
[1:44:38] change your theologies or nothing, but
[1:44:41] to increase your faith in God's promise
[1:44:46] in this day." He was telling those
[1:44:49] brethren, I'm not here to try to change
[1:44:51] your theology. I'm not here to try to
[1:44:53] change, you know, a whole lot of things
[1:44:55] for you.
[1:44:57] Not here just to give you something new,
[1:44:59] but I'm trying to give you something
[1:45:01] that will increase your faith in God's
[1:45:04] promise in this day.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And anointed ones at the end time. And I
[1:45:11] say this to you, you are a separated
[1:45:13] people,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; holy unto the Lord.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; This isn't brother Ed Bisll.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; This the spirit of Elijah.
[1:45:25] There's a holy prophet of God
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; saying you're separated.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say all kinds of people could say
[1:45:32] that. The key and the the ultimate is
[1:45:36] there has to be an original word.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; There has to be an original word. The
[1:45:41] only thing that makes the message
[1:45:42] original is the supernatural vindication
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; who multitudes tried to copy but they
[1:45:48] couldn't copy it. And he had to call
[1:45:50] them impersonators.
[1:45:52] said, "They're my brethren, but they're
[1:45:54] impersonating
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; because why were they impersonating?"
[1:45:58] Because he was putting on and fulfilling
[1:46:02] the scriptures concerning him. So, he
[1:46:05] pointed to Malachi 4.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Why did he point to Malachi 4? Not
[1:46:10] because we need to hear it. Because he
[1:46:12] was living it.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; He pointed to Luke 17 and 30 in the days
[1:46:18] of the revealing of the son of man.
[1:46:20] because the son of man was revealing
[1:46:23] that scripture and letting us know we're
[1:46:25] in that season.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to break loose and have a re
[1:46:34] personal revival, friends.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; And what was it? It was the law of
[1:46:41] reproduction after the God man.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; I say the prophet of God was a
[1:46:50] man of God.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; And I'll say further to that and
[1:46:55] threatening to be misunderstood, he was
[1:46:57] also a God man
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; because what was in him was God
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and what's in every believer is God. Not
[1:47:06] God diluted,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; not God somehow diminished God.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; And we become a God people
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; by another law.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. the law of reproduction.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Putting on immortality
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; by letting the God in you,
[1:47:34] let the God in you live.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; And is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:47:39] And I have a number of quotes here and
[1:47:41] it won't be that long.
[1:47:43] The only way that you can live a life
[1:47:45] that's worthy of the gospel.
[1:47:48] The only way
[1:47:53] that's absolute statement that you can
[1:47:55] live a life worthy of the gospel.
[1:47:58] So I'm sure your heart is beating saying
[1:48:00] what is it? Read on pastor.
[1:48:05] Read on.
[1:48:07] Let the gospel itself,
[1:48:10] every bit of the gospel
[1:48:13] come into you and reflect his promises
[1:48:17] back, make them vindicated
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; and let God live in you to vindicate the
[1:48:25] promises of this day.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Now, it's gone beyond the vindication
[1:48:30] which he had. But he's saying if we let
[1:48:33] the gospel, every bit of the gospel for
[1:48:36] the promised word of this hour live in
[1:48:39] us, then your life is going to vindicate
[1:48:42] that promise. Your life's going to show
[1:48:44] that that promise actually exists and is
[1:48:47] being fulfilled.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Hope I didn't lose you there.
[1:49:00] In the message God talked with Moses to
[1:49:02] Moses,
[1:49:04] he said, "A Jewish church was brought
[1:49:07] out of Egypt to Palestine was a natural
[1:49:10] church,
[1:49:12] God's natural people
[1:49:16] who had a natural law.
[1:49:20] But we today are God's supernatural
[1:49:24] spiritual rather spiritual church with a
[1:49:28] spiritual law written on the tables of
[1:49:32] our hearts
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; led in a spiritual form.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; He says now they looked up to see where
[1:49:42] the pillar of fire was the angel of the
[1:49:44] Lord. But we don't look today. He said,
[1:49:47] "There's something happens that we know
[1:49:51] he's here."
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; I use Brother Brandham's words in
[1:49:59] shalom. He said, "Oh, I feel it all over
[1:50:01] me now." And I do.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; I'd like to stay here longer.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; This is the best time we can feel it all
[1:50:10] over us cuz we're receiving that word.
[1:50:13] Yay. Yay. Amen to that word. It'll push
[1:50:17] that darkness back.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; It'll drive that darkness back.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Now, in questions and answers, this
[1:50:26] very, very important. Here's the
[1:50:28] question.
[1:50:30] Please explain the mystery of the
[1:50:33] translation
[1:50:34] of the bride.
[1:50:37] Said just to change just to change our
[1:50:40] bodies. now
[1:50:43] that Abraham was looking for a promised
[1:50:46] son that was promised him. Is that
[1:50:50] right? And the church is looking for a
[1:50:52] promised son. The bride is looking for
[1:50:54] the promised son before the promised son
[1:50:58] could come to Sarah and Abraham. Their
[1:51:00] bodies had to be changed. He said, "Is
[1:51:02] that right?" said we cannot receive the
[1:51:05] promised son that's promised to us today
[1:51:08] in these bodies that we live in. These
[1:51:11] bodies are sin. So something has to
[1:51:14] happen to these bodies.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; There has to be another law that takes
[1:51:20] precedent over the law of sin and death.
[1:51:23] And the apostle Paul has already told us
[1:51:26] that the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:51:30] hath made us free. Not will hath made us
[1:51:34] free
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; from the law of sin and death.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; And so it's another body and we are
[1:51:42] taking this body to immortality.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Literally,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; you're either doing that or you're
[1:51:52] living in a body that's just going to
[1:51:54] keel over someday.
[1:51:57] You are taking this body. I got all
[1:52:01] kinds of all kinds of proof for that.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; You can't even interpret the scripture
[1:52:08] any other way.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; That's a conscious decision. Put you on
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. Who is he?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; The word.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Well, how I can't put on all of the
[1:52:25] Bible. Didn't say the Bible. The Lord
[1:52:27] Jesus Christ. That's him. that's
[1:52:30] revealed. And that same Lord Jesus
[1:52:32] Christ came through one man to point us
[1:52:35] to the scriptures for you. You you and I
[1:52:38] are not ignorant concerning the word
[1:52:40] that's been given to us, friends. And so
[1:52:42] when we hear it and there's something
[1:52:44] that witnesses inside that's for my
[1:52:48] time, then I say that is your that
[1:52:53] that's your theme, friends.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; That's your theme.
[1:53:01] So he says and he goes into the first
[1:53:03] conscience of the body feel taste meal
[1:53:06] uh smell and hear and so on and is this
[1:53:09] all going to pass away. So then he goes
[1:53:12] on to say
[1:53:14] that this body is subject to death and
[1:53:16] will die. But the inside part of you,
[1:53:22] not just the inside part, but the inside
[1:53:25] part of you
[1:53:27] down in here inside,
[1:53:29] that is the person that cannot die.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; That's not just some illusionary, you
[1:53:35] know, feeling or substance or something.
[1:53:38] That's a person he said that cannot die.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; You you see you're you're a dual person
[1:53:45] really because you have the body that
[1:53:48] you're sitting in here now which came
[1:53:52] your mother and father under the laws of
[1:53:54] natural life and it will surely die
[1:53:59] unless it's changed.
[1:54:01] But you have another person inside and
[1:54:04] this is what he says. Listen. And that's
[1:54:07] the person that the new life starts from
[1:54:11] from this new life and it builds another
[1:54:15] person in the image of this person you
[1:54:19] are around that life.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Now I know maybe only 10% of you got
[1:54:28] that.
[1:54:31] I'm going by the words of a prophet
[1:54:34] saying you have another life person in
[1:54:39] you now.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; And he speaks he says
[1:54:46] and I have a very he makes a very
[1:54:49] profound statement and that that's the
[1:54:53] person that the new life starts from.
[1:54:56] That's when you're born again.
[1:54:59] And from this from this new birth
[1:55:03] and it builds another person in the
[1:55:06] image of this person that you are
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; around that life.
[1:55:13] Isn't it marvelous?
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; He says so puts it all together so
[1:55:17] beautifully. Other places God took a
[1:55:19] picture of you
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; when you were in the prime of your life.
[1:55:24] That's the image that he's talking
[1:55:26] about.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Says, "And that will build another
[1:55:29] person. It's going to build a person in
[1:55:32] the image that you are."
[1:55:35] Oh my,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; it's so far. It's so rich.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, here's the
[1:55:42] statements. So potentially, potentially
[1:55:47] it's in here.
[1:55:55] See, if it if it's cell upon cell, let
[1:55:57] me just take my time for a few moments.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; If it's cell upon cell, those cells must
[1:56:03] be word. He said, it's not one human
[1:56:04] cell, a dog cell, a horse cell, another
[1:56:07] cell. It's all the same cell. And he
[1:56:10] says, this has to be word upon word upon
[1:56:14] word. Listen friends, it's not the
[1:56:16] coupon package that you got in the mail
[1:56:19] that we look at. That's not a sale. It's
[1:56:22] not your phone bill or your hydro bill
[1:56:25] or your mortgage payment. That's not a
[1:56:28] cell of this life. And don't don't get
[1:56:30] me wrong. I know that those affect us
[1:56:34] and they affect us big time. And I think
[1:56:36] if the economy goes the way uh they're
[1:56:38] talking about it going, it's going to
[1:56:40] affect a whole lot more of us, a whole
[1:56:42] lot deeper than we realize. We don't
[1:56:44] know. We don't know what it's going to
[1:56:45] be on down the road. But the one thing
[1:56:48] that I know for sure, this word
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; will not fail us.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; This word
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; is not going to fail us.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; We may live in a tent or a cottage, but
[1:57:04] this word, it says, I'll not see my
[1:57:07] children baking bread,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; will not fail us.
[1:57:11] this word that there's another man,
[1:57:14] another person inside of you, another
[1:57:16] life. You've been born again. You've had
[1:57:19] a new birth. You're another person
[1:57:20] inside. But the only thing that can
[1:57:23] build that person up is not what you get
[1:57:25] in tomorrow morning's mail. It's a not
[1:57:27] not the next document you businessmen
[1:57:29] have to read. That is not that's going
[1:57:31] to pass away with this world.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; I said it emphatically going to pass
[1:57:35] away. Totally meaningless. The only
[1:57:37] thing you can live on is what has been
[1:57:39] spoken. and identified for this day as a
[1:57:42] promise for your hour. And now, brother
[1:57:44] Brandham used so many words. He calls it
[1:57:46] the promise of this day, the message of
[1:57:49] this hour. He's all pointing to the same
[1:57:51] thing. And that, my brother, my sister,
[1:57:53] is the only thing that will be cell upon
[1:57:56] cell and bring you to your immortality.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; God gave it here. That is the process.
[1:58:03] You know, wouldn't it be easy if we just
[1:58:04] sit here and say, "Well, you know, I
[1:58:06] just I just want to kind of enjoy life
[1:58:07] and, you know, have a great time and,
[1:58:10] you know, be happy and, you know, do my
[1:58:12] thing and have my have my uh, you know,
[1:58:14] my sports or my uh hunting or my
[1:58:18] whatever. I like to go fishing or
[1:58:20] something else. It's all fine. All fine.
[1:58:22] But none of that's going to put on
[1:58:24] immortality."
[1:58:27] Immortality is
[1:58:30] seeing what has been said
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; and then you let the mind of Christ as
[1:58:36] that is Christ
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; be in you
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; and you put on Christ.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; So many people have an idea of the
[1:58:47] rapture
[1:58:48] as being kind of, you know, a a quick
[1:58:51] fast exit out of here. It's not what it
[1:58:54] is. It's not what it is. It's a group of
[1:58:58] redeemed people
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; that are testifying
[1:59:02] by the life they live of the word of God
[1:59:05] for this hour. And they are a super
[1:59:07] race. The prophet said they're a super
[1:59:09] race. They're a different species. Of
[1:59:11] course, they're a different species
[1:59:12] because they come from a different kind.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't leave the image laid down
[1:59:20] there. He said he begin to build it up
[1:59:21] right quickly. He's going to build up
[1:59:23] that image.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And Jesus when he come, he was the seed.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; He was the seed of God.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; He was the new breed. He was the new
[1:59:34] species.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And they that are in him are of his
[1:59:39] kind.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; So I'm not just giving you a message now
[1:59:44] to uh to listen to this morning, but a
[1:59:48] challenge to go out from here. And when
[1:59:51] you hear the word, when you read a
[1:59:54] message,
[1:59:55] and God identifies something in there,
[1:59:59] that's for this time, you make a
[2:00:02] conscious decision. Say, I'm going to
[2:00:04] put that on.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Might say, I never did that before.
[2:00:10] But you make a conscious decision. And
[2:00:13] I'll tell you one thing,
[2:00:15] by the authority of God's word, you are
[2:00:17] putting on immortal life.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; You are adding cell upon cell
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; to that man, that new person that is in
[2:00:28] you.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; So potentially it's here just quickly
[2:00:31] now please. He said the word promised
[2:00:34] before the foundation of the world and
[2:00:36] around there he said it's only
[2:00:39] this only reflects the negative. So here
[2:00:43] we are whole group of people reflecting
[2:00:45] the negative that he said which he's
[2:00:48] referring to will reflect the positive
[2:00:50] the word and the same thing he says the
[2:00:53] same thing now the question was the
[2:00:57] mystery of the trans uh uh the the
[2:01:01] mystery of the translation of the of the
[2:01:04] bride. And so he says this reflects the
[2:01:07] negative. That which he just described
[2:01:09] inside which is growing
[2:01:12] reflects the positive.
[2:01:15] And he says in the translation of the
[2:01:17] bride will be the same thing. The word
[2:01:22] that's in you not coming to you but
[2:01:25] that's in you.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; The body will materialize around that
[2:01:31] word. And the same thing it did by
[2:01:34] Sarah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I want to emphasize it so strong that
[2:01:40] you cannot cannot escape it. When Jesus
[2:01:44] was moving
[2:01:47] through his life,
[2:01:50] the scriptures of Isaiah
[2:01:53] and of the psalmist was being
[2:01:55] materialized
[2:01:57] in him.
[2:02:01] He materialized that scripture and
[2:02:04] brought those scriptures to fulfillment.
[2:02:12] You are
[2:02:14] materializing
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; the message of this hour.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; This is not just another church and not
[2:02:22] just another doctrine and not just
[2:02:23] another little theory and oh we got a
[2:02:25] prophet. Mormon's got a prophet.
[2:02:27] Muhammadan's got a prophet. Everybody's
[2:02:28] got a prophet. Prophet. That's not what
[2:02:30] we're talking about. We're talking about
[2:02:31] a prophet that actually spoke original
[2:02:33] life, original word.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Where'd you hear the serpent seed
[2:02:39] before?
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Not like this.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; You might found people thought, well,
[2:02:44] well, we used to believe it was even the
[2:02:46] Catholic church used to believe it was a
[2:02:47] it was a sexual experience back in back
[2:02:49] in Eden. That's not all. And even Rabbi
[2:02:52] Richmond says that. But when they say
[2:02:53] when he put it together and says this
[2:02:55] was Cain was the product.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, Rible Richmond said, "No, we we
[2:03:01] don't we don't teach that." And that
[2:03:02] startled him
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; and set him into a deep deep we could
[2:03:06] communicate with him. He got so deep
[2:03:08] into his thoughts.
[2:03:11] Do you know why it's different?
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; It's an original word.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; An original word is the original seed.
[2:03:19] Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; See, when Jesus was here and he came and
[2:03:23] he came walking into Jerusalem,
[2:03:24] Jerusalem is the very heart, the very
[2:03:26] wife of God.
[2:03:29] Going a little bit deeper.
[2:03:31] So, the seed
[2:03:34] of God
[2:03:37] moving into
[2:03:40] the very womb of his wife.
[2:03:45] And other seeds were there.
[2:03:48] Pharisees,
[2:03:50] Sadducees, Herodians,
[2:03:53] Romans, they all had their own. But he
[2:03:55] was the original sick.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody had come to conception like him.
[2:04:01] No one had been birthed like him. He was
[2:04:04] the original seed. And that is why we
[2:04:07] who who receive him, we receive original
[2:04:11] seed.
[2:04:29] He said, "Here's what I'm saying.
[2:04:32] The law of reproduction is that each
[2:04:34] species brings forth after his own kind
[2:04:38] according to Genesis 1:11."
[2:04:42] And we're we're the ones of that kind
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; by virtue of and a and a message you may
[2:04:51] want to get into very very very heavy
[2:04:54] message is the spoken words the original
[2:04:57] seed
[2:04:59] be good for you to get into that just go
[2:05:02] through it slowly and prayerfully
[2:05:04] but now here we are in a strange time
[2:05:08] and I'm closing with this
[2:05:11] right up into our day, right into our
[2:05:13] time.
[2:05:20] The seed is very precious to God.
[2:05:29] The spirit of this age
[2:05:31] is one that
[2:05:33] desecrates
[2:05:38] the seed
[2:05:40] and perverts the people so that they
[2:05:43] would put it in the face of God.
[2:05:47] Now you have seed within you. You men
[2:05:50] have seed.
[2:05:55] The one movement that may well shut this
[2:05:57] church down someday
[2:06:01] is a homosexual movement
[2:06:04] which the government supports and and
[2:06:06] stands by and not only homosexual but
[2:06:09] the gay movement
[2:06:11] powerful movement very prevalent very
[2:06:15] prominent
[2:06:16] and the women and I don't speak I don't
[2:06:19] speak against the person I'm sorry
[2:06:22] they're caught in the web in the trap
[2:06:23] they
[2:06:29] But the man's seed
[2:06:32] throws it as it were in the face of God.
[2:06:36] And you're all adults.
[2:06:39] Where does that seed go?
[2:06:42] I would say it's an ultimate insult
[2:06:45] to God who put in his mind. And God
[2:06:49] attested to what he believed about seed
[2:06:52] because when Jesus came forth, Jesus
[2:06:55] said, "I've come from the bosom of the
[2:06:59] father."
[2:07:02] That's what God thinks about seed.
[2:07:06] The seed has come from the bosom of the
[2:07:09] father.
[2:07:13] That's God's thought about seed. Amen.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; And then you have a whole movement of
[2:07:18] women, lesbianism,
[2:07:22] big thing. It's on the screens. It's on
[2:07:25] the movies. And that is simply, let me
[2:07:29] say it plain, wombs that refuse seed.
[2:07:37] And then you have the abortions
[2:07:43] and they the big subject is
[2:07:47] well when does the conception take
[2:07:49] place? What are we a bunch of idiots?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; When did Mary conceive?
[2:08:03] when she conceived,
[2:08:06] you'll conceive and you'll bring forth
[2:08:08] life.
[2:08:11] But the whole tenor and the whole theme
[2:08:13] today and you take all of those things
[2:08:16] and then take the birth control
[2:08:21] and take the machines that dispense
[2:08:24] condoms in schools.
[2:08:28] You can only come up with one thing,
[2:08:30] friends, and I'm go closing with this.
[2:08:33] It happens to be Satan's Eden
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; who despises
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; the seed of God,
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; despises life.
[2:08:43] It wouldn't be so bad if someone wanted
[2:08:45] to despise it. And and people are there
[2:08:49] are unics. There are women that are and
[2:08:52] there's a great honor in the Bible. And
[2:08:54] I can tell you there's a great honor in
[2:08:55] the Bible of people that never married
[2:08:59] and served God and they had such a
[2:09:02] richful life. They actually served God
[2:09:05] and made those that had women and wives
[2:09:07] and families and all the rest of it
[2:09:11] because there's a certain burden with
[2:09:12] that.
[2:09:14] But brother Brandham never dealt in
[2:09:17] public about birth control because he
[2:09:19] dealt with individuals about birth
[2:09:21] control. But when you the whole sum in
[2:09:24] total I'm I'm I've spoken to you today
[2:09:27] on the law of reproduction.
[2:09:29] But there's massive movements in the
[2:09:31] world today that have no desire of even
[2:09:35] natural reproduction and they disdain
[2:09:40] disdain
[2:09:42] the seed and the process
[2:09:46] of law the of nature of the natural law.
[2:09:50] Having said that, then we have a very
[2:09:54] religious world
[2:09:58] and every one of them have a seed,
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; They have a seed. It's their doctrine.
[2:10:06] And the church that they serve is the
[2:10:08] wife, is the woman, but the doctrine.
[2:10:11] And that is why when brother Brandham
[2:10:13] was here
[2:10:15] and he was speaking to the priest and
[2:10:17] all of you that were former Catholics as
[2:10:20] I also was born in a Catholic home when
[2:10:23] brother Brandham got in discussion with
[2:10:25] them and the priest would say but the
[2:10:27] church says and brother Brandham says
[2:10:29] but the word says. What the church says
[2:10:32] the the the word says. What is happening
[2:10:35] really to put it in different language?
[2:10:37] One is saying but the woman says and
[2:10:39] he's saying but the man says. The woman
[2:10:41] says but the man says. The woman says
[2:10:43] but the man says. He was simply bringing
[2:10:45] the headship around where it was
[2:10:46] supposed to be. And now my brother my
[2:10:48] sister you want to go out of this place
[2:10:51] feeling very very blessed of God that
[2:10:54] you have already received the original
[2:10:56] seed
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; and a prophet has declared that your
[2:11:00] womb is sealed. You have received it
[2:11:03] into the womb of your mind and dropped
[2:11:05] down into your soul and it's sealed and
[2:11:09] over with. And all you can do now is add
[2:11:12] to that cell upon cell, word upon word.
[2:11:16] That's the only function I have this
[2:11:18] morning. We're not here to build any
[2:11:20] kingdom. We're here to convey something
[2:11:22] to you that you can go out here and I'll
[2:11:24] just say to you, put it on.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Put on the mind of Christ. put you on
[2:11:30] the Lord Jesus Christ. I repeat Apostle
[2:11:33] Paul's words to you as a challenge to
[2:11:35] this congregation. Let me go away from
[2:11:37] this pulpit saying it will be my last
[2:11:39] message. I'd say put ye on the Lord
[2:11:42] Jesus Christ.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's the only one
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; that has immortality.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:11:55] Father, what a serious moment.
[2:12:00] What a difficult time we're living in.
[2:12:04] What a dark time. No wonder your
[2:12:06] messenger
[2:12:07] cried out and said, "Gross darkness
[2:12:11] upon the people."
[2:12:14] So thankful, Father, I am thanking you
[2:12:18] for this audience and group of people
[2:12:20] that have taken their time. they have
[2:12:23] driven have come with expectation
[2:12:26] sitting in their seats sang the songs of
[2:12:30] worship oh God and now have sat and
[2:12:33] listened to the word I pray father I ask
[2:12:38] that this this whole entire message will
[2:12:42] have such a effect
[2:12:45] let it have an effect on a people when
[2:12:48] they leave here oh God I pray even if
[2:12:51] it's just one or to things that they
[2:12:54] encounter in your the voice that you
[2:12:56] sent in this hour that they will put it
[2:12:59] on. And throughout this week, there will
[2:13:01] be those of your dear children that you
[2:13:05] have put on that have put on the very
[2:13:09] eternal life, immortality
[2:13:12] for mortal mortality, you said must be
[2:13:17] swallowed up with immortality.
[2:13:21] Thank you, Father.
[2:13:23] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:26] I wonder if there's
[2:13:28] some here say,
[2:13:31] I just want to identify myself.
[2:13:35] I would ask for prayer for this
[2:13:38] congregation to pray for me right where
[2:13:40] I'm at. You'd like to raise your hand
[2:13:43] where you are. just feel to do so if we
[2:13:45] could have
[2:13:48] musician maybe just play something
[2:13:50] softly.
[2:13:54] All right,
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:05] whatever you do, friends,
[2:14:07] don't go out and just live the same
[2:14:09] patterns, the same
[2:14:13] order.
[2:14:15] It's a very, very, very serious hour
[2:14:18] that we're in.
[2:14:21] Let us live very close and snugged up to
[2:14:23] the word.
[2:14:25] Pray as you've never prayed before.
[2:14:29] Believe as you've never believed before.
[2:14:32] And ask that God would give you,
[2:14:36] give you the insight.
[2:14:38] Dear father, dear father,
[2:14:42] author of life,
[2:14:44] author of life.
[2:14:47] Out of your very bosom came the very
[2:14:50] concept of life. And when our Adam and
[2:14:54] Eve fell, Lord, then you sent forth
[2:14:57] another specy,
[2:14:59] another
[2:15:01] seed that would bring forth a super
[2:15:03] race. And you've been so kind, so
[2:15:06] faithful, oh God, to bring your word and
[2:15:09] to confirm it to us. We do not feel
[2:15:12] worthy for it, but you did it anyhow.
[2:15:16] Oh Lord, give us the give us the very
[2:15:19] simplicity of Mary that said, "Be it
[2:15:21] unto me according to thy word." And when
[2:15:24] we run into, Lord, when we read those
[2:15:26] words that you've left for us in this
[2:15:28] hour, each time I pray you'll put these
[2:15:30] words in the people's hearts and
[2:15:32] especially those that have their hands
[2:15:34] raised, may they identify, oh God, with
[2:15:36] the promise that you've made to them. If
[2:15:39] they're living below their standard,
[2:15:41] below their rights. Oh, lift them up, oh
[2:15:44] God, above every shadow and every doubt.
[2:15:48] I pray, Father, they they'll find the
[2:15:50] words in their lips. be it unto me
[2:15:53] according to thy word. In the name of
[2:15:56] Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. Amen. If
[2:16:01] you'd stand with me.
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:08] I wish I had a lot more experiences,
[2:16:11] but I have had a few.
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:18] And just simple,
[2:16:21] I can tell you that it works.
[2:16:25] Awaiting emergency operation on my neck
[2:16:30] and the only place I could get any
[2:16:32] relief whatsoever, some hot water.
[2:16:35] And I just looked up and I was breaking
[2:16:38] emotionally a wee bit because of the
[2:16:41] excruciating pain. And I looked up and I
[2:16:44] said,"Lord,
[2:16:46] if thou wilt, thou can make me whole."
[2:16:51] And that was all my prayer. That's all I
[2:16:52] intended to say. And just through me, I
[2:16:56] had to say, I had to speak. I just
[2:16:58] uttered out. I actually cried it out. I
[2:17:00] will be thou whole.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; You that attend this church
[2:17:07] knew I came here
[2:17:09] just after brother Charlie Drake passed
[2:17:11] away. And I was in the midst of that at
[2:17:14] that time at his funeral. It's the only
[2:17:16] function I was able to handle
[2:17:19] medicated in order to do it. But I came
[2:17:23] here, I couldn't pray, but I came here
[2:17:25] and stood behind this pullpit and said,
[2:17:27] "God said it."
[2:17:30] Brother Brandham indicates that standing
[2:17:32] at the river
[2:17:34] when it says and your message well as
[2:17:37] John the Baptist for ran the first
[2:17:39] coming your message
[2:17:41] he can he he says it very clearly it was
[2:17:44] his voice
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; that spoke it
[2:17:50] cares whose voice it is
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; as long as it comes from the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:56] I can tell you there's more power in you
[2:17:59] saying it and putting on the Lord Jesus
[2:18:02] Christ. Do that as a conscious a
[2:18:06] conscious decision throughout this week.
[2:18:07] And I I trust and pray that there will
[2:18:10] be
[2:18:11] hundreds and hundreds of conscious
[2:18:14] decisions. Mothers,
[2:18:17] young ladies, young men, school
[2:18:21] children,
[2:18:22] elders,
[2:18:24] we will say that and may we do it and
[2:18:28] thus be doers of the word, not hearers
[2:18:30] only. Amen.
[2:18:33] I had written down
[2:18:36] the only song I had written down
[2:18:39] and brother Rod got up and sang
[2:18:43] sang it. the love of God. But I think I
[2:18:46] have to sing a couple verses of it.
[2:18:48] Brother Rod, maybe you'll help me. Would
[2:18:50] you?
[2:18:52] And I in prayer,
[2:18:55] I said,
[2:18:57] "If every man on earth a scribe
[2:19:02] and the skies of parchment made,
[2:19:06] we couldn't and the in ocean was ink. We
[2:19:10] couldn't write the love of God
[2:19:14] has been extended to us. Someday we'll
[2:19:17] look back perhaps on this very meeting
[2:19:20] and say, "Well, I got something there."
[2:19:23] Precious brothers, sisters, children of
[2:19:25] God, let me say this to you.
[2:19:29] I will feel fully rewarded if something
[2:19:32] was spoken this morning that pushed you
[2:19:35] forward into your immortal life.
[2:19:39] Hallelujah.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; I want to shake hands again someday. Not
[2:19:46] after the service with this body of this
[2:19:48] natural nature. I'll give it a hug, too,
[2:19:50] and shake your hand. But the one I want
[2:19:53] to shake hands with is the one that's
[2:19:54] growing on the inside.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; That's the one I want to shake hand
[2:19:57] with. Are you with me? All right, let's
[2:20:01] just sing a
[2:20:06] love of God
[2:20:11] is great.
