Amen. &gt;&gt; Team number four, we love you, brother Peta. One more chemo treatment, right? That's a good birthday present. God's victorious through it all. We've learned to trust in Jesus through it all. Amen. By the things that he suffered. If he could learn all of that, what more can we learn through the things that we suffer? Amen. I'm going to ask Brother Tim, Brother Tim Dodd, if you'd come. We have several prayer requests to remember before the congregation this morning. Sister Eleanor Drake gives us a testimony to thank the Lord for and thank the saints for all their prayers for Sister Helen Bilisberger. The family is very much amazed at how well her progress has been made in such a short time. Please continue to pray as she still has a long way to go and um sorry still no visitors at this time. Praise God for the power of prayer. Amen. Thank you, Sister Eleanor, for that testimony this morning. Um, brother Hugh and sister Sylvia have a request for their daughter. It's in the hospital with um, uh, looks like a blood clot. So, we just want to remember it's a very serious need. Please pray for her. Have a request from Sister Patty Pettingale, Sister Kayla, who are both homesick today, asking for prayer from the congregation. A senior pastor has requested prayer for his wife. This is from brother John. Uh he lost a daughter to cancer 5 years ago and now his wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer and just asking that the Lord would be merciful to her and that our congregation would pray. My mother-in-law, Sister Joanne Savory is requesting prayer for herself. She has diverticulitis and is in a lot of pain and discomfort. Just asking that the Lord would touch her. Desires not to go for surgery. God's been merciful in our family over many years. She had um appendicitis. The doctor was ready to go in for surgery and just after she got saved and she said, "Just check one more time." &gt;&gt; The doctor went in and checked and he said, "How did you get a brand brand new append appendix? It looks like a newborn's." Amen. That's our God. &gt;&gt; He can do things just like that. So, she's just asking one more time. Amen. And if you have a need upon your heart as we go to prayer this morning, Brother Tim physical needs this morning certainly our burden for those you know the body is not just a local body. It's a international worldwide body and there are many needs. We are a needy body. As long as we're in these mortal bodies, we'll be a needy body. We're looking forward to a body change. &gt;&gt; And uh God is doing great things to get his bride ready for that. And I before we go to prayer, I just want to say that we've just published the latest edition of the believers faith challenge report. And it will be hitting the mail this week. Thanks to brother Matthew and his outreach group. They'll be doing a uh work effort this week to put it in the mail. We mail thousands of these uh around the world and the people that are interested in them and you can get your copy before anybody else does. They're on the back table by the office and uh there's some unique articles in here. We have one. We were actually hoping to have brother Jason Jackson with us from Arkansas here just last month, but he got uh pulled aside because of the hurricane that they had down there in Florida. And he went to have some meet with some and help some family members. Um but he helped us to put an article together of the impact of his church sponsoring a print station in Angola. And that is such a a unique article. You'll want to read that personally. It has had a huge impact on their church. I won't I won't uh give you any spoilers as they say. Uh the Uganda what's happening in Uganda is in here. Uh usually we publish one or two pages uh per we could say project or per item in Ug for Uganda. We went to four pages in this in this magazine. and and there's a lot of detail and pictures in there that you'll enjoy reading about. China and what's happening in China and some of the details brother Murphy couldn't necessarily share over the internet. They're in there in the faith challenge report. Greetings from our pastor. What's happening on the message of many other things you want to get your copy and you'll be inspired by it. That's why it's called the faith challenge report. It'll challenge your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want our faith challenged. You know, faith has to have a challenge &gt;&gt; in order to operate. &gt;&gt; If there's no need, there's no need for faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And but we thank God that he challenges us and puts a pressure to our faith, but he gives us the faith to overcome the challenge. &gt;&gt; And let's believe together uh not just for what's happening overseas, but let's believe together this morning as we pray, especially for these individual needs. I don't know if you felt that way as brother Derek was reading them. I felt that these were people that really needed a touch from God. And let's bow our heads together. And if you need also need a touch from God, have a desire in your heart, why don't you just make that known before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh wonderful heavenly father, you are our God. &gt;&gt; We are your people. We are not ashamed to be called your people, oh Lord. We are called Mrs. Jesus Christ. We are called after the name above every name. We've been baptized in that name. We have been saved by faith in that name. And we have been cleansed by the blood that flowed from that vessel. And Lord, we thank you this morning that we could come to you. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we're desiring, Lord, we're a people in need. We give testimony, Lord, for your goodness amongst us. We give testimony for your goodness to brother Peter, oh God. We thank you for him, oh Lord. And we pray, Lord, you'll continue to strengthen and heal him. Lord, continue to guide the doctor's hands as he endures the radiation treatment for the sake of his family, his loved ones. Oh God, we pray your quickening upon his mortal body. We remember Sister Helen this morning. Oh God, she's improving. And Lord, we're believing for a full improvement. That as long as she has life on the earth, that she will also have health and strength. Lord, we commit her into your hands. Oh God, these other needs that are represented here, Brother Hugh's request, the other request for a pastor and his wife. Lord Jesus, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, you suffered at Calvary those stripes that we might be healed. And we pray that the healing virtue that was loosed at Calvary would be poured out upon these requests this morning. Lord, may you go to them each and everyone individually. And Lord, may you do a supernatural work within their lives, loosing them, breaking the power of the enemy, liberating the captives, oh God, lifting up the downtrodden, unbburdening the burdened, oh God. Lord, in each and every one that has a need, we desire, Lord, that you'll just come by our way this morning. We're praying for ourselves. We're praying for loved ones. We're praying, oh God, believing that even as you have promised it in your word, it shall be, Lord, for you cannot break your word. We love you, Lord. We thank you that you've called us to serve you. We thank you for this service this morning. Thank you that our pastor is going to come and minister the word this morning. We pray Lord you'd anoint him with a double portion. Lord, you'll strengthen his hand, Lord. That you'll give him that divine inspiration that only comes from your presence. And as we take up an offering this morning, we ask that Lord, you receive it as a form of worship. We give it unto you in worship this morning. May you bless it and use it for the glor glory of the name of Jesus Christ for the furtherance of the kingdom of God. We want to say Lord that we love you &gt;&gt; and thank you for your grace in our lives and we commit this service and all of these needs to you in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning as you have your seats. Amen. Amen. How many enjoyed the special that Brother Victor sang on Wednesday night? Amen. I really appreciated that. I asked Brother Victor if it wouldn't be too much trouble if he could sing that for us again this morning. I think that'd be real nice. Brother Victor, if you'd come and get ready, that would be wonderful. We have a baby announcement here amongst my papers. I I tried not to hide it. Here it is. David and Linda Adamora are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl, Joanna Adamora. Is she precious? &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. She was born on November 18th at 11:59 a.m. Brother Victor, you might as well come on up. that they won't even notice you if that baby picture's up there. She weighed six pounds and 12 ounces. Mother and baby are doing outstanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. And grandparents are happy. I'm sure they are. We have young people's on Friday night at 7:30 in the fellowship room. And brother Michael Andy's wanted me to make sure that I remind the young people that it's press the mark and it's starting right at 7:30. So, you don't want to come in at 7:40 hoping that they're done singing. Uh cuz you'll already be late. So, make sure you get there about 7:15 so they can get everything set up and have everything going speedily at 7:30. Sound good? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. We'll invite our pastor to come just after brother Victor's done singing. Beloved, now we are the sons of God, adopted by his blood. We've been redeemed. We've been made joint hes with Jesus and to reign as kings and priests. Tell me, what do we say to these things? If God is for us, tell me who can be against us. If God is on our side, how can we be denied? In all these things, we are more than coner through Jesus Christ our Lord. Nothing can separate us from the love of God. Oh, we are told that God is working everything for our good if we promise to love him and do his will. And though the enemy tries to harm us, still the song our heart should sing. Now tell me what do we say to these things? If God is for us, tell me who can be against us. If God is on our side, how can we be denied? In all these things we are we are more than conerors through Jesus Christ our Lord. And nothing can separate us from the love of God. in joy and triumph or even your time of trouble. There's nothing to compare with the glory that's in store. For be it for thy sake, we stand justified by faith and will be glorified in him forever more. Sing it with me. If God is for us, tell me who can be against us. If God is on our side, how can we be denied? In all these things we are more than conquerors through Jesus Christ our Lord. And nothing can seeparate us from the love of God. Let's sing it one more time. If God is for us, tell me who can be. No situation, no circumstance, no sickness. God is on our side. How can we be denied? In all these things, we are more than coner through Jesus Christ our Lord. And nothing can seeparate us from the love of God. Nothing can seeparate us from the love of God. And nothing can seeparate us from the love of God. Amen. Brother Victor, thank you so very much. As our pastor comes this morning, we can sing blessed assurance. Nothing can separate us that gives us blessed assurance. Amen. And God bless you each and everyone this morning and welcome those that have joined with us on the internet today and ask that you be blessed in the service as we're blessed in his presence this morning. We appreciated this service Wednesday night. Brother Ernie, thank you for ministering. Amen. We enjoy the gifts that God's given us in this body. Blessed asssurance, Jesus is mine. Oh, what a glory of salvation. I'm virtious of God for his washing his blood. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day. This is my soul. This is my song. Praising my savior all perfect on my side. I see angels. save me and break from your mercy. You whisper. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the way. This is my soul. This is my song. Praising myior. God bless you. &gt;&gt; This is my story also &gt;&gt; all the day long. &gt;&gt; But I have another story I'd like to just sing a wee bit about. He came to me &gt;&gt; when I could not go to him. He came to me and I trust that would be your experience today. I stood right about where Tom is sitting and we were singing. He came to me. I remember even looking up in the balcony over to this side. I don't know why. I just looked over there and I I said, "Yes, you came to me. &gt;&gt; You came to me in my element. &gt;&gt; You came to me in in the wilderness as it were &gt;&gt; and you came to me there. You came to me in a prophet &gt;&gt; and you answered many questions. Yes, &gt;&gt; you came to me. &gt;&gt; And I'd like you if you would stand if you wouldn't mind and just sing that. And I'd like your thought to be upon that very thought. Perhaps this is the moment he would just come to me in a special way. So let's just sing it. He when I where he was. He ra to where he was. He came to me. &gt;&gt; I'll have you sing it. I'll have you sing it once again with me. And rather than sing it like a lullaby, we'll sing it like a song, like a putting words to your putting music to your words. He came to me. He came to me &gt;&gt; when I could not come &gt;&gt; to where he was. He came to me. &gt;&gt; Sing it like a like an event in your life. &gt;&gt; Would you do maybe you want to close your eyes and just think about that? I'm just wanting to create that kind of an atmosphere. Second, brother He came to me when I could come to where he was. He came and that's my I am when I to he'll just pray a moment, please. Our heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we're indebted forever. &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. Then you came to us when you came. Our life was changed. &gt;&gt; Our life was transformed by the transforming power which we could not even begin to comprehend. But you have done it. And we've gathered here this morning for various reasons. Perhaps some say, "Well, it's Sunday and we always go to church." But may it be more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. May it become a time when we come and speak to you and you speak to us. May it be a time, oh God, that this will be a house of prayer, a house of communicating with you, heavenly father, bless your word now. and and we pray that we'll be worthy to read your words. Things that you've spoken, things that were in your heart, things that you had intended shall be and they shall be. Oh God, whether we see it or do not see it, they shall be. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; We speak, oh Lord, to you as our father. We pray your will be done in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anoint us Lord we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well you enjoyed I'm sure brother Dodd's comments about Faith Challenge report. &gt;&gt; Well I haven't read it yet. I'm certainly going to read it. And uh I trust you'll be blessed this week as you ponder the things that God has for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May this Sunday be uh a Sunday that we different from others. I just pray that you will have a testimony such as I had just a moment ago. I maybe just said it quickly. I was standing where brother Tom is sitting and I was standing and I was just singing. He came to me. It was just another chorus. But that day it was a different chorus. &gt;&gt; That day it was different words. &gt;&gt; And I don't even know if the author of the song &gt;&gt; felt what I felt. &gt;&gt; Thought that day he came. You remember when he looked at you, &gt;&gt; saw you, what did he see in you? &gt;&gt; And so I I pray that today will be a blessed time in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'll have you take your Bible and because I'm going to uh be speaking from I'm going to speak from the old creation and the new creation, our first birth and our second birth. And why believers, even believers, have a lot of trouble, have a lot of difficulty because we're living in both places at the same time. &gt;&gt; That's and Brother Ernie, you laid a wonderful foundation for that on Wednesday. It was really wonderful. Someone was asking me, I was smiling. Of course, I was smiling through the whole time. I just enjoyed I enjoyed the word real a whole lot is what I'll say. And uh a few a few weeks ago, brother Tom preached a series and I don't know if you caught it as in a series, but I we started on the theme, hear ye him. And then the second service he spoke on uh those that heard him said, "But blessed are your ears for they hear for the things they hear and your eyes for the things a lot of people could see physically, but they weren't seeing &gt;&gt; what they were given to see." And then I think the third service was, and you'll just forgive me Tom if I'm not exactly on quue here, but I think the third service was that uh you could see and you could hear. Even if you wanted to, you could see and hear only by his grace and by his predestinated. And you'll only see and hear what you hunger and really hunger after &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; Uh it it won't come. It's God's not going to force it down your throat. &gt;&gt; It's something you will need to hunger for. You desire for. You think about it. You ponder it. &gt;&gt; And you think about his greatness and your unworthiness. and when you see things in the in the light that they really are. And I'm just seeking to prepare you for what I have further to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in that third service uh the last service at least whether it was the third or fourth service it was that we uh we are predestinated to a certain purpose and God does he opens our eyes causes us to see causes us to hear because it is to direct our life in a certain pre-planned direction and God has his intent in fact is that's why you were perhaps some of you may be born in the home you were born in he wanted you to hear certain things perhaps others of you worked with someone who you worked with a a colleague or you ran into somebody and they just casually said something to you and it just that was different &gt;&gt; and you followed on or you got invited to church. This this is a church. It's not a church church. &gt;&gt; This is just a building that we come we come to hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; We come to let the Holy Spirit have his way. &gt;&gt; And that's the whole desire. And failing that, we fail completely. There's all kinds of churches, all kinds of buildings. They're monuments is what they are. &gt;&gt; And we don't want this to be just a monument. We don't want this just to be a formality. If this is just a formality to you, ask the Holy Spirit, "Jar me from that." &gt;&gt; Amen. jar me out of that &gt;&gt; and let me know that I'm here for a divine purpose &gt;&gt; for to meet a divi have a divine meeting &gt;&gt; with the holy one of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now with I'll just have you take your Bibles if you would. If you don't have a Bible, share it with the one right next to you because I'd like you to read from John the uh 17th chapter and the 11th to the 16th verse. And while you're turning, I might as well say this to you because it came to my mind today and I said, "Father, let me be worthy to read these words." This is not just some printed words on a page. &gt;&gt; This is the prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of Jesus Christ. We're not worthy to even read it. &gt;&gt; Cause uses to be worthy. &gt;&gt; And it's a conversation earlier in John. Jesus had a conversation with Nicodemus. And we will turn to that just after. I'm going to turn this on so you can read it. And now I am no more in the world. I'd like you to notice the word in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those that thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of predition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I come to thee, and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. Not his not a distress &gt;&gt; but a joy fulfilled in themselves. Not something hilarious or jovial as such but a deep settled joy. &gt;&gt; Verse 14. I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world. And I would like you to notice now the word of O. They are not of the world. They haven't proceeded from the world. They may have gone through the school system. They may have gone through further education, but they're not of the world. They may earn a living there and survive and raise a family, but they're not of the world. They're not a product of the world. and the world hath hated them, &gt;&gt; and they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray that thou shouldest take them. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. &gt;&gt; They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. verse 16. And I'm going to turn back to uh in John's gospel to uh John the 3 chapter and I just want to read a couple of verses uh starting John 3 and the third verse. Jesus answered and said unto him, that was Nicodemus, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. So this is another birth. Except a man be born again, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus sth unto him, "How can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" And I want to answer, "No, he couldn't." Because if he with the birth that he had entered into the second second time into his mother's womb and was born, it would still be flesh. &gt;&gt; It would still be death. it would still be sinful. And I'll talk about that in just a moment. So Jesus answered, verse 5, Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." God bless you. You may be seated. Now, we had our first birth. And that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; You're all here. &gt;&gt; And uh you have a a father and a mother someplace, but you were born in sin and you were shaped in iniquities and you came with a human nature and you came uh as a result of unbelief. You're the product of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Eve disbelieved the word. Adam went to redeem her. And uh so the first birth, we're born in sin and shapen in iniquities. Secondly, we're born subject to pain, to disease, to sickness. You're born subject to those things. We have wars, all kinds of infirmities. And because of that birth, this birth that I'm speaking of now, the second birth, the second birth is the beginning of the creation of God. I'd like you to, if you have your Bible, if you just turn also to Revelation the 3 chapter. And I was very uh affected by this particular verse. Revelation the 3r chapter and the 14th verse. and unto the angel of the church of the leadyans. Write these things saith the amen. Now a few moments ago we were reading words that he spoke on earth spoke to mortal ears. There very few that will understand these words but now he's still speaking. And under the angel of the church of the leadyans, under the messenger &gt;&gt; of that church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He has a special message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he didn't even say speak. He said write. &gt;&gt; These things saith the angel. These things saith the amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. This is the beginning of another creation. The beginning of the creation of God. It isn't that God failed in the first creation. God knew it was going to go that direction because we sit here in a body through that creation and we're all born in sin. I don't care how good you are. I don't care what you've believed. That has nothing to do with it. We are born in sin and shapen iniquities. And in this body, we will get older. We will get weaker. Brother Brandham even asked a man, he said, "Is it not true that as I eat food and it's digested in this body, he may not have used those words, but he said, "As I eat food and I eat vegetables and so on, I get stronger." Yes. He said, "That's that's correct. You get stronger. is because it's bringing blood cells into the bloodstream and you get stronger. He said, "Then how is it that I eat today, I still eat the same food, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I still eat the same potatoes and eat the same meat and so on, but I get weaker." &gt;&gt; And the man didn't have an answer for him. &gt;&gt; He gets weaker. you get weaker &gt;&gt; eating the same food, but you don't regenerate the same as you do when you're younger. So, we have a mixed audience here today. We have some of you that are receiving the benefits of what you eat on that end. But gradually, as time goes on, you'll find that it it becomes more uh more weight than you want. Uh, it doesn't do what you want it to do. You I say I used to be able to always do this. I could always do this. Well, we don't anymore. &gt;&gt; Sister Biscll sitting back there. She used to run like an antelope. Uh, today it's more difficult even to walk steady. Same thing with myself. And so that is one birth. And Jesus said to Nicodemus, "You must you must be born again. &gt;&gt; You cannot see the kingdom of God until you're born again." &gt;&gt; It it isn't, friends, that you sit in this church or any other church. That will not give you the vision that you need to have. You can clean your glasses or do whatever you wish, but that doesn't give you the vision. You must be born again and then you shall see the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. He cannot enter the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that this life that you're representing today, sitting in the seat that you're in will end. Then a prophet of God, his words will mean so much to you when his words and he spoke and said that that this life. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; This life only changes the there's no change actually. You you and this life you step into another life. You just take one footstep as brother Ernie was describing to us on Wednesday night. And you take one step, it'll be in time. And you'll take another step and you'll be in eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're born again, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Allow me just to read. I want to read something that I thought of you, brother Ken Andes, because you put so much meaning and depth to the church ages, and I really appreciate that. Brother Brandham says in the church ages just a moment please. It's in the Leodysian church age page 336. He says, "But now he is standing in the midst of his church." Speaking of Christ, as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age, he calls himself the author of the creation of God, which we just read. He calls himself the author of the creation of God. This is another creation. This has to do with the church. This is a special designation of himself. He is the creator. &gt;&gt; As John's gospel says, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. All things were made by him and without him was nothing made that is made. &gt;&gt; He created all things. So now he is saying this is another creation. This has to do with the church. In other words, he's going to create something. This is a special designation of himself. He is the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the spirit of God, as the spirit of God, he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born. I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body. It was not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to a human oam supplied by Mary. That would have been sinful mankind producing a body. &gt;&gt; That would not have produced the last Adam. &gt;&gt; Are are you receiving this? &gt;&gt; Of him. It is it was said lo a body hast thou father hast thou prepared for me? God not Mary provided that body. Mary was the human incubator &gt;&gt; and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth. It was a God man. He was the son of God. He was the new creation. &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined. &gt;&gt; He was Colossians 1:18. For he is the head of the body, the church who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in and in all things, he might he might have the preeminence. 2 Corinthians 5 and:17. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, &gt;&gt; I I wish to have this on the slides, but I don't have it prepared for you. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a new creation. If any man be in Christ, &gt;&gt; he is a new creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away and behold all things become new. There you can see that uh though man was of the old order or creation now in union with Christ and here's the key in union with Christ. He has become the new creation of God. Ephesians 2:10. For we are his workmanship, &gt;&gt; created in union with Christ &gt;&gt; unto good works. Ephesians 4 and 24. And that you might put on the new man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is how you do it. Which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness, this new creation is not the old creation made over. or it could not be called a new creation. &gt;&gt; This is exactly what this this exactly what it says it is new creation. It is another creation distinct from the old one. &gt;&gt; No longer is he dealing by the ways of the flesh. This was this was how he dealt with Israel. He chose Abraham as a man of of of the flesh. And of Abraham's issue, see, God had promised him seed of Abraham's issue uh through the godly Isaac line. &gt;&gt; But now out of every kindred, tribe, and nation, he has pro proposed a new creation. He is the first of that that creation. &gt;&gt; He was God created in the form of man. Now by his spirit, he is creating many sons unto himself. &gt;&gt; God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. Isn't this wonderful? &gt;&gt; This is the new revelation. This is the new revelation of God. This was his purpose. And then I have underlined and highlighted this purpose took form through election. &gt;&gt; And I could continue on, but I want to just stop there. You cannot supersede the election of God. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here by his election. You owe a debt to him &gt;&gt; to thank him, &gt;&gt; to worship him, &gt;&gt; because he simply elected &gt;&gt; that you'd be born in a certain place. &gt;&gt; I want to just speak about these two births for a moment. I've been pondering them for days, weeks. In fact, you that are mothers and fathers. Well, by with technology, maybe you didn't know it was a boy or a girl, but you knew very little. And and and that's not thanks to you. That's thanks to technology. Uh when my daughters were born, they wouldn't even let me go into the to the see where the children were. &gt;&gt; I was not permitted. I could only look at them through a glass. You say, "How horrible." Well, that's part of my life, right? That's a horrible part of my life. Yeah. I couldn't even see my daughters. I couldn't even see my children. That's, you know, for a husband to stand there, it's very humiliating. Yeah. It's my seed, but I can't even see them. I can't They got to put this glass between me and my child. And my wife is sitting there. our last daughter that is sitting here t today, Tom's wife, Joanne. Uh, I was working and so I raced home because I was going to fix myself something to eat real quick and run down to the hospital. And so I phoned nurse's station and I said, "How's Ruth Biscll?" She said, "She's about the same." I said, "Oh, okay, fine." I had lots of time. So about 25 minutes later, I got a phone call and it was from the hospital. It was my wife was on the phone. I said, "Oh, hi. I I just talked with the nurses station." And uh she said, "Well, it's a girl." I said, "Oh, come on." I said, "I I I I know better. I've just talked to the nurse." And she said, "Everything's probably the same." No, she said, "It's a girl." I said, "You're kidding." And uh what I didn't know is that her father came in to see her and uh the bed was empty and uh there was another sister there that we knew and uh related by marriage and uh she and she was there. She said, "Well, I I think she maybe just went down to the washroom or something." So he said, "Well, I'll just go. There's another old-timer here. I'll go and visit him and then I'll come back." So he came back in about 20 minutes or half an hour. He came back after little time of visiting and and she's in her bed and uh well he said I was just in here. She said well it's a girl and that was a shock to him as well. And so I I raced down to the hospital of course it was a girl and I had prayed because I had doubted my own prayer. I guess I prayed for a son and I said, "If it's a girl, just make it that they all can sing." And so that part of my request I got, &gt;&gt; but the other part I didn't get. I I wanted a boy, but I never got a boy. I got three girls. All right, that's natural birth. But isn't it, isn't it incredible that something this dynamic, &gt;&gt; something so lifechanging, &gt;&gt; something that's going to change your entire home and your life at home and maybe your job and all of these things, you don't have anything to say about it, right? &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, something like this and I don't have anything to say about it. And I furthermore, you have nothing to say about their nature or their character &gt;&gt; or what they're going to like or what they're going to dislike. You you have very little whether they've got skills or whether they're gifted. You don't know anything about it. You say, "Well, I'll I'll do everything I can." Well, you can do everything you can, but if the kid hasn't got it, they don't have it. &gt;&gt; You can't put it in them. Uh I know a little bit about that. I had I had one daughter, you know, I I have a lot of experience and I had one daughter and she would she would come and tap on my cheek at about 3:30 in the morning. Many many mornings. Yes, Marilyn. She'd be standing there in her little night gown and tapping and and she it was like a Chinese torture treatment I believe they have. and she would just tap on she would tap on there as long as it took for me to open my eyes and uh she couldn't say her Rs either at that time which is no surprise I couldn't say it till I was about eight but she would tap on my face and then when I'd open my eyes she'd say I need a pencil and a paper because she was going to be an artist someday &gt;&gt; now you ought to see when she takes a pen in her hand and and and I sit there and say, "How do you know to do that?" Well, it was back there. I should have known when she was saying, "I need a pencil and a paper." That she was trying to tell me, "I got it in me and I have to do something about it. I need a pencil and a paper." So, I'd get up and get her a pencil and a paper. &gt;&gt; That was a natural birth. natural birth, as wonderful as it might be, we're born in sin and shaped in iniquities, regardless of how beautiful you are or how young you are or and and that has nothing to do with it. You're still going to get stooped over and you're still hair is going to turn white and you're still going to get wrinkled and and uh and shaky when you get older. If that happens, it's that that's this life. Thank God that there's a new birth. &gt;&gt; Thank God there's another birth. It's not wishful thinking. It's not in our mind. &gt;&gt; And I want to talk about these two. Do I have a few minutes? &gt;&gt; We have a second birth. &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God comes and washes away the deformities of the first birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's either a weaker birth or it's a stronger birth. &gt;&gt; And my conviction to you is it's a stronger birth. &gt;&gt; There's a light that comes within the body to this in this flesh in this beginning of the creation of God or this shall I say this old creation. And you know there's some light uh we have light. I don't know how to describe it exactly. We can say well because you can speak or because you can see or because well it it has a measure of light. But the second birth is a perfect light. &gt;&gt; The second birth your thinking will be correct. &gt;&gt; And your thinking will not be of doubt or unbelief. &gt;&gt; There's a complete change between the new birth second birth and the first birth. The beginning of the creation of God comes and washes away the deformities of sin and the mar of the effects of unbelief. You know, when the serpent and Eve had their initial conversation, it wasn't just what was spoken, but it was a displacement of headship. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The Bible says clearly that she should have been able to go and talk to her husband, &gt;&gt; right? But neither was he able to give her the kind of instruction that she needed. Uh I'm just thinking of something that I perhaps should say and I don't want to say but and I have said this over the pulpit here when brother Brandham speaks about the masterpiece and how Michelangelo struck that masterpiece when he finally saw it what was an image in his mind and he finally saw it there and he says he He may be pecked at it for years and someone maybe would say, "Why are you pecking at that? Why are you hitting that stone?" But when he finally saw the image &gt;&gt; of what he had in his mind, &gt;&gt; he thought it should speak to him &gt;&gt; and he struck it on the knee &gt;&gt; and made a mar. He marred the image and he said, "Speak." &gt;&gt; Right. because he thought it should speak to him. &gt;&gt; It looked so real. It was such a fulfillment of what he saw in his mind. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "And it could only take a prophet. You couldn't say this with human intellect." He said, "The mar is what made it the masterpiece." Amen. &gt;&gt; And we think now of the mar of the first birth &gt;&gt; and we were marred. &gt;&gt; You can take a child out of a good home out of good Christian parents and put him up in the mountain where he'll never see any evil or never uh never contact anything. He won't see other peers of his of his age. dabbling in sinful things, but he'll still have a sinful nature. &gt;&gt; He'll still come against things that are right and pure and so on. And that's because he'll be he could be better. But the gospel didn't come to make people better. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said in the message he swore by himself. He says in Jesus Christ formed from a blood cell and the outside shield of the cell itself which is billions times billion smaller than the human eye can see. But that was the body. The Lord Jesus inside of that was God himself &gt;&gt; wrapped himself around the blood cell in order to take his own blood and to spill his own blood &gt;&gt; or give it freely that we uh through the breaking of that blood cell to our to our mortal to our mortal when it when it breaks breaks and our life leaves from here to go out through the redemption of the blood that God required. We can we can be brought into that body and brought a part of God himself as a son of God. Brother, if you can digest that, &gt;&gt; it'll sure do you good. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I had some way to just show you what it what what it is. Just think of God Jehovah coming down into the womb of a woman overshadowed come down in the in the uh down in the down to spirit and he's in them. Where is he? He's the creator himself. He made the very woman in the womb. &gt;&gt; He made the very woman in the womb that uh that he was in right then. God made I excuse me, but it's not always easy to easy to read exactly as the prophet speaks. God made himself little, &gt;&gt; came down and got into his blood own into this blood cell &gt;&gt; and his and he began to build something around him. What was it? He said when the Holy Ghost overshadowed her and put a blood cell in into her womb in creation, God the creator made that made that and and that came to be the son of God. Amen. Outside of believing that, you're lost. Right. &gt;&gt; All you could do, you have to believe that in order to be saved. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, here we have the beginning of the creation of God. I have a thought that I want to convey to you and I think that I'll just um speak it to you. Now I've established there is a new birth. There's an old birth and a new birth. I want this congregation to understand except ye be born again, you cannot enter the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You can do a lot with this. You can go shopping. You can go fix it up. You can get your hair cut. You men, you can look fine. You can go to the gym and all of that other stuff. But still one day you're going to lay on a cold slab. Whether you're a Bill Gates with 20 or 30 or 40 billion dollars, &gt;&gt; just paper or where you're somebody who's in debt. &gt;&gt; You'll all lay on the slab and that's where you'll find common ground. when the ecumenical movement was moving and everybody was joining this and speaking in tongues and so on and so forth. I was in a house on Vancouver Island as a result of the radio broadcast and the family who's who owned that house there in brother Roger Smith's church in Abbottzford to this day and they invited me to come there and brother Amy Mulan. How many remembers brother Amy Mulan? Put your hands up high so he's not a stranger to the congregation. Brother Amy Mulan was in his brother was his brother in the flesh. He was a hopeless hopeless hopeless alcoholic. He was a good Catholic and he gave himself to go to Borneo and the islands in the South Sea to work on a gospel ship. He thought surely I will find peace with God and I will find freedom from this demon of alcohol. And he came to the knowledge of the message as a result of my visit over there. He wasn't there. He heard of it through his brother. But I remember they were seated on the floor. Started here, went around some in chairs. There was 22 people. And I said, I didn't know what to say really. I just came there as a visitor and I was looking to the Lord that I could say something of value. So I said, now I don't know you. You're all strangers to me. I said, this person over here may be Salvation Army. This one might be Catholic. And this one over here might be a Baptist. And I I went around. This may be Jehovah's Witness. this may be whatever. And I just named all the different groups that I could recall quickly. And I said, now I would like to have the Bible says, now I'm quoting the Bible. The Bible says that Jesus, the word was made flesh. I said, I would like the real Jesus to stand up. Nobody stood up. I said and I read from the scripture. I said, "This is Christ, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is him." &gt;&gt; And I said, "I know that the Salvation Army, they describe Jesus one way and Catholics another way and Baptists another way. And I know that they do not agree." I said, "Who has Jesus? &gt;&gt; I'm confused. I want to know who has Jesus." &gt;&gt; And and as a result, the the owner of the home gave his life to this Jesus &gt;&gt; that he was hearing. Now, I'm I'm coming to my main thought in just a moment. So, I want you're listening real nice. And I said this Jesus, this word, this, we refer often to the word, but the words of God. Please just give me your full attention. Thank you. your mother when your father's seed I'm speaking to adults now your father's seed came to the womb of your mother and your mother ate of the vegetation of the earth the herbs the fruit &gt;&gt; whatever more you are a product of the word of God. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Even this shell here, you are a product of the word of God &gt;&gt; in that in that sense. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You also are a product of Eve's Eve's disobedience &gt;&gt; of disbelief. &gt;&gt; That's why a prophet comes and says sin is not the drinking and the smoking and the gambling. That's not sinful. Those are the attributes of sin. &gt;&gt; Even adultery and all of those things as the attributes of sin. The sin is not believing the fullness of the word of God. That's the sin. &gt;&gt; I hope you get that. &gt;&gt; We all came the same way. &gt;&gt; Our mothers and fathers were product of the earth. Jesus Christ himself, the body was formed. The Bible says she believed, "Let it be unto me as thou hast spoken." She believed, the Virgin Mary believed the word of God that a virgin would conceive. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, you'll not hear it anywhere else, so pay real strict attention. The prophet of God said those words, those words that were spoken by the prophet, because it wasn't a man, it wasn't just Isaiah speaking. It was God issuing his intent &gt;&gt; concerning the new creation through her through there his mouth said, "A virgin shall conceive." And he says those words anchored in her heart in her in the womb of Mary and and and those words anchored in her womb. Here she is a vessel of the earth. And those were eternal words that were spoken by the ma mouth of God had a different intent. I hope you're able to understand. Even though even though she herself was a product of the earth, her mother ate the vegetables and so on and she's going to continue to eat to give a a a human life &gt;&gt; to a man and God would be in him &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself &gt;&gt; and that is why he went to Calvary. People celebrate Easter. They know nothing about Easter. I tell you that this is a new creation &gt;&gt; walking amongst an old creation. And friends, here's the struggle that you and I have. We are a new creation. We're a new creation by the Holy Spirit of God. &gt;&gt; He brooded over the earth &gt;&gt; and up came the flowers and up came and God said, "Let the earth bring forth and it brought forth trees and herbs. Thou shalt eat of all the herbs and the plants and the things and they could eat of it, but they could not partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil &gt;&gt; and of that tree. In other words, there was an object that would present itself and they must not partake of that. And I can tell you friends today, this is not just my own thoughts, but you have to have the wisdom of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; One person goes through further education and they can come out fine &gt;&gt; because they keep eating from another tree. They keep eating from the tree of life &gt;&gt; which is greater than the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light that's in the believer is greater than the darkness that's in the world. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is greater. And now we have a people birthed by the Holy Spirit and feeding on the word that God gives &gt;&gt; to the believer. It's a divine thing. You have nothing. You go to the you you go to the store and you go to the fruit stand and you say, "Well, I'll have some of this and I'll have some of this dill and I'll have some turnups and I'll have You had nothing to do with bringing that forth." &gt;&gt; The people who weeded the garden had nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It grew because God said it back there, "Let the earth bring forth." And I drive past the fields here on 40th Avenue and I think, "Oh, God, how man just uh is so benefited from the from what you said &gt;&gt; hundreds and thousands of years ago. Let the earth bring forth." Every season it brings forth. And we go to the store and we think that we're wonderful. I'm able to go to Sabon Foods or Safeway or wherever more and buy all of these vegetables. We didn't have anything to do. The man who put them there didn't have anything to do. The man who bought them and paid for them and the farmer who sprayed it, he doesn't have anything to do with it. The earth brought it forth &gt;&gt; and our mothers and fathers ate it &gt;&gt; and produced us &gt;&gt; by the act of marriage. &gt;&gt; We didn't have very little to do. We had very little to do with bringing ourselves forth. And then you went to a church. You went to a certain place and this one preaches that and that one preaches something else and and they made denominations and made creeds and made books and you had to believe these books or something. And then Satan is so subtle. He said, "See, they just got books. They just got something to believe." Well, Jesus also believed something. Come on. &gt;&gt; He said what Moses said to do that do. &gt;&gt; But don't be as these people who say it but don't do it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I stood here and read and I felt unworthy reading John 17. Don't John 17 ever don't ever look upon John 17 as just some verses in the Bible. It's more than that. &gt;&gt; It's a man of God, the son of God, son of the living God, speaking these things to his father. And he says, "Father, I'm no longer in the world, but these are in the world." &gt;&gt; Be with them. &gt;&gt; I've kept them from the world. &gt;&gt; He's kept you &gt;&gt; from the world. And then he turned around and said, "These are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. &gt;&gt; I'm not the product of the world. I'm the product." He He didn't even claim to be the product of Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; He was the product of almighty God. &gt;&gt; And we have been birthed by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We've been birthed, that's not just a phrase, we've been birthed by the Holy Spirit of God. It has brooded upon this word. &gt;&gt; These seeds, &gt;&gt; this happens to be God's seed. &gt;&gt; Human seed brings forth all kinds of life. &gt;&gt; Human seed brings forth all kinds of life. &gt;&gt; Some that God will destroy. &gt;&gt; And some that God will take as his own family. human seed. You know who are yours, &gt;&gt; your relatives and whatever more. &gt;&gt; But God's seed is this &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit comes and broods upon this seed &gt;&gt; and the spark to life &gt;&gt; the human seed, the sperm of the man. I'm speaking now to adults. The human sperm of the man goes, and you'll understand something in just a moment, but it goes and of all those millions of germs, one will go &gt;&gt; and attach itself &gt;&gt; to the egg of the female and to the wall where it's intended and the organs. Who put those organs there? God himself. &gt;&gt; He made the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Who did the conception? God. &gt;&gt; And by election, he elected some. He elected. &gt;&gt; This will be my child. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care where they were born. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what color they are. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what he gave them the color of their eyes and the color of their hair. He gave it all at that time. That's God's doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't we glad for God's plan. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you friends. &gt;&gt; We thank we thank our heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is such a marvelous plan. &gt;&gt; And then now here is a God. He brought about the first creation and it fell. He brought about the second creation and it does not fall. &gt;&gt; It does not fail. &gt;&gt; And down through the centuries he sent his messengers and the world slew them. Jesus said to kill the prophets. Fill up the cup of the prophets because fill up the cup of wrath because he knew they were not accepting him. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; And almighty God who created all things &gt;&gt; and the earth and all of these things, he's not going to allow &gt;&gt; He's not going to allow the product of the new birth to be overcome by the product of the earth. He's not going to he's not going to allow the new creation to be overcome by the old creation. &gt;&gt; And so the Holy Spirit brooded upon the earth. We know that. And up came the growth and the vegetables and so on and so forth. And the prophet brother Brandham even speaks of it. And I hope that you have the capacity to understand that the product of the old birth has brought this life. &gt;&gt; And Satan, he just plays games. He tantalizes with it and all kinds of things and makes things that are so uh have such an effect upon the emotions. And brother Ernie, that's why I so enjoyed the service that he took the power of the senses and how Satan so tantalizes those senses. And and anyone who has not got the new birth, they'll be taken by these. &gt;&gt; But when you have the new birth, &gt;&gt; it's not when you're old naturally. When you have the new birth, I didn't have any interest in the world. When I was just a teenager, before we were married, I had a vehicle and I had guys that had come by. They'd come by where I worked and say, "Do you want a drag race?" I thought, "Drag race? Are you crazy?" &gt;&gt; Why did I think that what he thought was exciting was a crazy to me? &gt;&gt; I don't h I don't know. I can't explain that. I just can't explain that. And here I got something now I want to ask you. I was the age of some of you young men. I had to work too. We had to work and earn very little money. It was before credit cards. And I couldn't run up the gas pumps and get money that way, get credit that way. But I had a hunger. It's what I want to ask you about. That's why I'm standing here today. Had a hunger. A hunger. I was so hungry for the things of God. So we heard that there was a meeting. My wife went with a friend and some pick up her car or something. I didn't know. It was 350 miles from where we lived. I got on a motorcycle. until I had a motorcycle. I had to work until 5 or 6:00. And after that, then I got on the motorcycle and started to drive into Alberta to northern Alberta to a city called Manning, Alberta. There was very little pavement. It was mostly It was cold, colder than it is outside. But it reminds me of the time This is still the same person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It was these legs I threw over a motorcycle. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And I got and we didn't have nice outfits that you could buy that were weatherproof. &gt;&gt; And I drove till way late in the night and it was becoming 1 and 2:00 in the morning and past Grand Prairie, Brother Tim, and over the Smoky River. And it got it got very cold at night. And I was pounding these legs to keep them from freezing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. These legs, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Legs of the earth. &gt;&gt; Legs of the first creation. &gt;&gt; But inside, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; was another creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Inside there was a hunger. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; The new man was so hungry. Amen. &gt;&gt; For God &gt;&gt; and I pulled into a place I see light off and and I just have something in the human nature. I just oh I don't want to bother people. I don't want to I don't want to interrupt their evening as one at about 2:00 in the morning and then there was light right beside the road in a little log house. So I just pulled quickly off. I couldn't go any further and I leaned the motorcycle against the wall, came to the front door and just heard the man inside yell, "Come on in." So I opened the door and here's a guy at the back and he's got his feet up on the table and he's reading a book. He said, "Do you ever hear this author?" He named the author. I thought I'm a total stranger. But you know, we never worried about anybody coming in to rob anybody that was out of our mind. And he said, "Do you ever read a book by this?" So I said, "No, I haven't. Never did." So I said, "Listen, I I just I just came up with a motorcycle." Oh, he said, "I didn't hear it." I said, "Yeah, I parked it right outside." And I said, "I'm just wondering if you got a place I can kind of camp over the night." Oh, yeah. Yeah. I says, "So, his bedroom's right there. You can stay there." I don't know. I don't know his name. I don't know anything about him. I don't know if he was married or not married. He probably wasn't, but anyway, he said, "You can just stay there. I'll make you bacon and eggs in the morning." And so, I never did find out his name. And I pray, God, just make a place, give him a bed someplace, sometime. And I got up in the morning and went the rest of the way. You know why? And then there was about 4 ines of snow, fresh snow, and the cars were going by and they started to melt and they thought it was fun. You know, they just splash splashed me up with uh with their cars. They sped by. That was the only direction only time we had a little bit of pavement and I finished off the trip. Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm just hungry for a meeting. &gt;&gt; I just want to be in church that night. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know the name of the pastor. Yes, I do. His name was Ericson. I think he was a Baptist. Baptist and organization. Didn't mean nothing. Didn't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; It was in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God's ministry was born. &gt;&gt; And that's why we just accepted it. &gt;&gt; This is just a natural thing. &gt;&gt; And you know what we said? We said he's a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't we didn't know any of the scripture. We didn't know Malachi 4. We didn't know Revelation 10. We just said, "This is a prophet. This is what a prophet does. &gt;&gt; This is what a prophet says." And so we went to that meeting and and uh I'm just going to tell you this and I'm I'm finished with it. That night I stayed in the sleeping bag with four or five other brothers at the back of the church in the kitchen or something. And I got down into that sleeping bag and I got such a burden. I got I I began to intercede. I didn't know what a hardly intercession was, but I knew what a burden was. &gt;&gt; Friends, this is a real life. &gt;&gt; This isn't just going to church Sunday morning. This is going so hungry &gt;&gt; and so sensitive to the Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit can speak or can lay something on your heart. You don't have to be thinking about what you're going to do tomorrow. It's God Almighty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thinking what he's going to do tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And so I I rolled and I wept and I groaned and I didn't know what I was praying for. And I groaned and rolled until I just was weak. And I finally just went to sleep. &gt;&gt; In the morning, the pastor, who I've never heard, he got up in the morning and he said, "We grieved the Holy Spirit last night." He said, "We grieved the Holy Spirit last night." &gt;&gt; I didn't know what he was talking about. Then he said somebody prayed and I went to him right after the service and I told him what happened to me. He said that was it. He never said anything further. So there was a almost like a little mystery to the whole thing. You know, brother Brandham speaks about people who are led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're almost mystics. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To the world. The world can't that isn't two and two makes four. &gt;&gt; That is that's above algebra. That's that's something from another realm. &gt;&gt; But when you're born again, &gt;&gt; you're dictated to by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And we have those things. I don't tell about a lot of those things that happen regularly &gt;&gt; in this congregation, supernatural things. &gt;&gt; And that's what makes me to know &gt;&gt; there's a God in heaven is ordained himself. He's ordained that we should believe. And furthermore, that is why ministry comes behind this pulpit and begins to speak from the message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; From the word. And here I'm going to make known to you something that perhaps hasn't come to your mind. The prophet said it lay cell upon cell, cell upon cell. Do you know anything about your body forming that you're sitting in right now? This is you. You know anything about it forming? You weren't around. &gt;&gt; Did you give any instruction or direction? Did your mother or father give any instruction or direction? &gt;&gt; This is how he's going to be. This how she's going to be. &gt;&gt; It didn't have anything to do with it. &gt;&gt; And now a message comes &gt;&gt; and you don't know anything about the servant, the vessel. And God is pushing himself himself &gt;&gt; through &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; clay &gt;&gt; redeemed clay &gt;&gt; and he takes a vessel &gt;&gt; and people &gt;&gt; to me it's so absurd forgive me but I think that people who rise themselves up in their mind and say well I this is what I think of William Brandham and this is what I think of the pope open. This is what I think. Who cares what you think? &gt;&gt; God's already decided. &gt;&gt; God's already got election. &gt;&gt; God is saying and I am saying on his behalf, God says election is mine. &gt;&gt; I do what I will. &gt;&gt; I do what I intend to do. &gt;&gt; And I will fulfill it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you can wrestle all you wish friends &gt;&gt; but God in the end &gt;&gt; his will shall be done &gt;&gt; and the elect say thy will &gt;&gt; be done &gt;&gt; on earth &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; This is my you are my father &gt;&gt; and this is my attitude toward you. I bless your name. I worship you because you have brought me your Holy Spirit has has brooded over the words. How will I how will I know which words it is? He has selected certain ones. He selected a message for Philadelphia and for Thotyra and for Sardis and he selected a message for Leisa. And he says to John, "Write &gt;&gt; and tell him who's speaking. I'm the faithful one. I'm the amen of God. &gt;&gt; I'm the faithful messenger." &gt;&gt; And write these things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To the angel or to the messenger, &gt;&gt; the angel of the church. Right. &gt;&gt; And I wonder I had not intended on saying much about this. You're familiar with all the destruction that's been taking place. And I'm just reading what others have said. The 2018 wildfire session is the most destructive on record in California with a total of 7,000 579 fires burning an area of 1 million 667,855 acres. the largest amount of burned acreage recorded in a fire season according the California Department of Forestry. Brother Brandham spoke a message in Yuma, Arizona, right on the border on December the 4th in 1965. Listen close now. If you were Almighty God, women, men, if you were Almighty God and you could sit on your throne, you say, "Well, now this is the last message and I sending it to the earth. And I've said to my apostle John, I've showed him gave him the message to the Leodysans. Now I want you to write write it and send it to the angel &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; of that church. And now the great eternal God when that season comes, his spirit is directed. His spirit who's the author of this word. See, now there's a certain thing that must be said, and I want you now to brood over these cells. Brood over this mighty, eternal, lifegiving word of God. There will be some elected people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There'll be living Yes, &gt;&gt; by the first birth. But I am not willing &gt;&gt; that they shall be destroyed. &gt;&gt; I am not willing that my enemy, arch enemy, Satan should foil my plan. &gt;&gt; These shall come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I shall send this Holy Spirit, my spirit, &gt;&gt; to brood over the earth. Now the word has gone. Yeah. They put it into books. They put into all kinds of theological seminaries etc. and have declared this and that and the other thing. But I have a prophet down there &gt;&gt; and I want you to get this message to him. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him identify himself &gt;&gt; in the scripture in my word. Let him identify himself. He's the one that must speak and say these things. &gt;&gt; And this is the one, this is the Almighty speaking. This is the amen, &gt;&gt; the faithful and true witness. Furthermore, this is the beginning of the creation of God. and brood over these words. &gt;&gt; And as it's brooding over the words, the brooding of the great son of God, it shines upon stones. Nothing happens. shines upon some part of earth and maybe vegetation comes but shines upon some wheat gathered into my corner. &gt;&gt; I have much to say and at the end of this age these are the things that are going to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this prophet, he spoke the message of rapture. &gt;&gt; You plan to be in the rapture. He spoke about the rapture. &gt;&gt; This is the fourth last message that he speaks. And it's 3 hours and 41 minutes by car to go to Rialto, California. And there he will preach things that are to be. &gt;&gt; And this is where much of this message even came from. &gt;&gt; He speaks of the relationship and of the coming of the children coming forth. And then 40 minutes from there, 40 minutes, he'll speak the next night in San Bernardino and he'll speak their modern events made clear by prophecy. And in that service, he says, "This is a horrible time, but it's the most glorious time in the world to preach the gospel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? The two two two creations. It's a horrible time &gt;&gt; for the lost. &gt;&gt; It's the most glorious time to preach the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can have a horrible time and a wonderful time, &gt;&gt; my friends. &gt;&gt; Believer friends, &gt;&gt; this is a horrible time, &gt;&gt; but it's a glorious time &gt;&gt; to stand for Christ &gt;&gt; and for the new creation of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the most glorious time to preach the gospel. If I could have stood on the brink of time before it came into existence and the father would have looked at me and said, "What time down through the ages would you want to preach? I'd want it right now." &gt;&gt; That's right. Just before the coming. just before the coming of him. &gt;&gt; Oh, if I could only preach, &gt;&gt; just before he comes, &gt;&gt; just before this rapture which he described just a two days ago, I would want to preach at this time &gt;&gt; even though it's a terrible time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's a wicked time &gt;&gt; and the thoughts of man's mind and intent are only evil continually. Friends, this world is fitted for destruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; California will be just child's play &gt;&gt; alongside of what's going to happen. The prophet of God spoke about the earth erupting &gt;&gt; and coming forth. I'll tell you what, even down in Hawaii, they even tried to figure out how to stop the lava. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They couldn't stop it &gt;&gt; and couldn't stop it from burning. The pro, this prophet of God said, "And you can take whatever direction you want to take. I just say I believe it." &gt;&gt; He said, "The earth will burst forth." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't believe in some someone might say I don't believe in a hell." You're standing on a you're sitting this morning, Sunday morning, on a whole globe full of it. Right. &gt;&gt; 40 minutes from San Bernardino when he was in Covena to preach the last service. I suggest you read &gt;&gt; all of those &gt;&gt; rapture 3 hours 40 minutes later things that are to be 40 minutes another direction to Cavina and there he preaches leadership and he asks in there who's leading you now &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; who's leading you Now &gt;&gt; what about a young fellas? &gt;&gt; Well, my teacher or my professor said such and such. His voice will be silent. &gt;&gt; He won't even be around. My boss, my superior said, "I was doing this. I was doing that." But what does he say? &gt;&gt; That's the one to listen to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's the one to listen to. &gt;&gt; And all these other things we may just use them, but say this life will be given to hunger after God. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean we just walk around, you know, and do nothing. No. &gt;&gt; But we have a direction &gt;&gt; and God is our direction. Right. &gt;&gt; I hope these things have meant something to you. &gt;&gt; I've been very affected by it. And so now say, well, what what did you say? And I'm I'm closing. What did you say in the last two hours? While you've sat here, there may be somebody, you may have conceived. I'm speaking very plain. There may be some mother here that is conceived and you don't even know it. You have no way of knowing it. But there may be an infant that has been conceived. We don't know. But in the new in the new birth, maybe someone has conceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe a a life &gt;&gt; has come &gt;&gt; into the individual heart, soul. I I don't know where the spot is, but wouldn't that be more important? &gt;&gt; The other one's going to bring a human. This one's going to bring a son or daughter of God, &gt;&gt; born again, &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. What are they going to do? Is it going to be another Fanny Crosby &gt;&gt; or is it going to be what is it going to be? Another minister's wife &gt;&gt; or another preacher of the gospel? We don't know. We have no way of knowing and it's not our business. &gt;&gt; I say &gt;&gt; thy will be done. &gt;&gt; We'll be faithful to this word. &gt;&gt; Somebody will hear it. &gt;&gt; Somebody will be moved. &gt;&gt; Somebody will be fed. &gt;&gt; Oh, precious young people. Precious young people, just give your strength, &gt;&gt; give your future days &gt;&gt; to him. &gt;&gt; Will you bow your head with me? Heavenly Father, we've spoken what you've laid upon our hearts and I have sought to deliver it to them to the people, the congregation that you've gathered here today. I pray, Father, you'll take this church. &gt;&gt; Pray you'll take the congregation, the song leaders and the worship leaders, the musicians. Oh God, &gt;&gt; those that attend to the streaming &gt;&gt; and sending this word out. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we want to we we are not afraid to be identified with your messenger. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you that you've sent him. &gt;&gt; We thank you that you have sent the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You've not only guided him, but now you guide us into this word. And here we are, Lord, representing the message to the Leodysian church. We see a world that is falling apart. Oh God, we see such confusion and everybody declaring to be the truth. We thank you, oh God, that you speak your truth &gt;&gt; and you confirm your truth. &gt;&gt; You vindicate your truth. And we ask you to come forward Lord &gt;&gt; and vindicate Father I pray the power of Christ, the power of Calvary in healing. Oh God, our brother Peter, oh God, raise him up, Father, &gt;&gt; not for our glory, but for your glory, raise him up, oh God. Our sister Helen Billisburgger, raise her up, oh God. give her the use of her her body. Oh father, I pray in Jesus Christ's name. There may be many others that are suffering, Lord. Or there are others that Satan has attracted and he has done everything he can, Lord, to draw them aside. I pray, Father, it will be in vain as of now. Let the Holy Spirit come, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and invalidate what he is attempting to do. Lord, there's perhaps people that have been invited and are visiting for the first time. Oh, I pray, oh God, I pray, Father, in the name of the son of God, Jesus Christ, that they will feel a a sensation of a pull, a drawing, oh God. A drawing that we cannot understand. One that will say, "I will go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will seek out these things, Lord. May they be like the Bereans. I pray father you'll bless this service and the service tonight and our brother John that will journey with his family down to Ron. Oh God moved by your holy spirit &gt;&gt; on this west coast we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we give you all the glory. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; He's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is, brother Tom. Thank you for your attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the poor. I hear the Lord Here is me to give my he to me and I for my savior soul. I feel the I feel the Lord in my ear and his spirit is moving me to give I speak to me and I Lord come and save my soul. I feel as the musicians continue to play. I thought it was just the Lord that we showed a picture of a little baby at the beginning of a service than natural. But how greater is that spiritual birth? That joy that bring that little baby will bring a home will be just tremendous. But the joy that brings the body of Christ is a new birth. And that is the most important thing. Not allowing the new creation to be overcome from the old creation. This new creation that God is creating. There's a deep calling to the deep. I don't know about you, but that's all I've been in in the last few days. Future home. Things that are to be. It's a call. It's a pull. We're living in the two realms, in the two worlds. But I'm so thankful at a horrible time, as the pastor was saying, this is the most glorious time for the elect of God. And if you haven't come to this knowledge of salvation or Jesus Christ as a personal savior, maybe this is your service and the Holy Spirit is tugging at your heart saying, "Just surrender. I feel a pull. I want to pass from death unto life. I want to go into his glorious kingdom. I want to be carried away. I want to be raptured. I want to be changed. Maybe the word is speaking to you because each and every one must be born again. &gt;&gt; I feel the pull. Lord, speak to your own this morning. Jesus, you know you're only a lamb of God. He speaks speakingly, Lord, to your children. and I Lord please come and take control. I feel the Lord. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Maybe there's somebody here this morning that actually feels the pull or the tug of the Holy Spirit. And God's dealing with your heart and you on a surrender in a greater way, a more consecrated way, a more dedicated way. As a scripture was read this morning, you must be born again. It's not an option. It's it's it's something that it comes from within. &gt;&gt; And if you're here this morning, you just want to lift up your heart, lift up your hand, and say, "Lord, save me. Deliver me. Set me free from the entanglements of sin and depression, from the burden of being lost, no hope, nowhere to go. But there's something within you that feels the pull that said, "Lord, here am I. Lord, save me. Save me, Lord." And Lord, with these hands and different ones raised around the room, you know the heart. You know the reason where some feel the pull and others it just goes right over. So, Father, I pray that that hand and lift it up, that God, you'll reach down your hand and you'll start and kindle a fire that will never be quenched, Lord. That the Holy Spirit himself would breathe upon that life and bring forth a new creation by the word of life that was spoken this morning. Confirm your word, Lord. Confirm it in the hearts of your children. and let the Holy Ghost have its free course and committing these hands and these lives and these needs to you in Jesus precious name. Amen. Let's sing this glorious old song. Down from his glory, everliving story. down from his glory. Glory my God and Savior's name and Jesus was his name in a manger. Oh to his strangeanger and oh how I how I adore you. My pray, my sun shine. Oh my all the great became my savior. All God's voice verse three without reluctance with reluctance flesh and blood. He took the form of man and revealed the healing plan. Oh glorious mystery sacriice of calary and now what a savior saints what a savior I am what a redeemer let's praise his holy name Heat. Heat. Heat. My my only heart became my savior Oh, let's just sing this chorus. Let's just all worship as we get ready to close now. Oh, you My great creatior dwell in him. Hallelujah. And all God's fullness dwelleth in him. What a savior. What a redeemer. This great mystery unfolded. And God has come today to reveal it &gt;&gt; to the sons and daughters of God. How happy we should be. &gt;&gt; How thankful we should be that actually we did feel the pull of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't know what to say cuz brother Biscll just just spoke the last half of his ser. I turn over turned over to brother John. I said I'm in a heap of trouble. I'm preaching on fire tonight. Birth by the fire of God. So God has a continuity. And we just pray that you'll come expecting, come praying that we also could have the fire of God. There's a reason why there's fires going on because there's a holy fire descending and there's another fire that's come so that we can ascend. May God bless you. May the presence of God go with you. May you ponder these things as Mary did when she heard the salutation of an angel. She pondered these things within her heart. We've heard from God this morning. So, God bless you. Greet one another. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. Wow. Oh yeah. Come on. Come on.
