[14:47] come and open the service in a word of
[14:49] prayer. If you've got a need this
[14:51] morning, if you're listening in on the
[14:53] internet and you've got a need, want to
[14:55] continue to remember our um brother Ron
[14:58] Spencer, Lord's really done a work for
[15:00] him. We appreciate it. And we just want
[15:02] to pray that God would just completely
[15:04] finish that work. Amen.
[15:06] Tom
[15:10] Father, as we sing the old songs of
[15:13] Zion, something wells up within my own
[15:16] heart, saying, "It's amazing grace."
[15:19] Lord, the anthem of the redeemed.
[15:20] Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that
[15:24] saved a wretch like me. Lord, that we
[15:26] can look within our own lives and father
[15:29] can testify this morning. It's amazing
[15:32] that that capstone would come with
[15:35] shoutings of grace, grace, grace. And
[15:38] so, Lord, we look to you, author and
[15:40] finisher of our faith. Come and inspire
[15:43] your people again. Let us look, Lord,
[15:46] into the glorious truths of your word.
[15:49] Inspire them to us, Lord. Revelate us.
[15:52] Move us, Lord, into realms that our soul
[15:55] so longs for. So, Father, as we've
[15:58] gathered this morning, we pray that you
[16:00] will meet every need in divine presence.
[16:03] Lord, with uplifted heart and hands, we
[16:06] reach within the veil by faith, claiming
[16:10] the promises for their yay and in him.
[16:14] Amen. So, Lord, bless your children.
[16:16] Strengthen them by the word and let it
[16:19] go forth healing them body, soul, and
[16:23] spirit. And father we'll be sure to give
[16:25] you all the glory, the honor and praise
[16:28] due your holy name. We thank you for
[16:31] this opportunity in Jesus name. Amen.

[33:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be acquainted with
[33:40] him?
[33:42] &gt;&gt; To know him.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Whom to know
[33:45] &gt;&gt; is life eternal.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We greet you all in the name
[33:50] of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to
[33:53] greet all the those that are streaming
[33:56] with us on the internet. We greet you
[33:59] also in the name of our Lord Jesus
[34:01] Christ. Part of the congregation here
[34:04] this morning.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; In the last two weeks, uh we just passed
[34:12] a million the million mark of visitors
[34:16] to our website. I thought that was quite
[34:19] remarkable
[34:20] and uh it's there's people who are
[34:23] interested,
[34:25] &gt;&gt; people who are being helped
[34:28] &gt;&gt; and we just want to be a blessing.
[34:32] Uh the internet may be used for a lot of
[34:35] very evil purposes, but we're determined
[34:39] to use it for a very good purpose.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; And let people all over the world,
[34:45] wherever they might be, if they feel
[34:47] inclined to do so, one thing for sure,
[34:50] it's just their own choice. they feel
[34:52] inclined to uh be united with us in a
[34:57] service and we can be of a strength to
[34:59] them. Praise God.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; We're just happy to do that. Just so
[35:04] happy and we feel united one with them.
[35:08] Amen. God's doing so many wonderful
[35:12] things. Uh we have a special greeting
[35:15] this morning to our brother Henry Hayes,
[35:18] Senior.
[35:20] Brother Henry Hayes should stand up. Uh
[35:24] he's a a notable man for a couple of
[35:26] reasons. One, he's the most senior
[35:30] brother that I've ever baptized. And I
[35:33] think that's wonderful. Baptized at 89
[35:35] and today he's 90.
[35:38] [Applause]
[35:51] Yes. And I thought of the scripture, in
[35:53] fact, as my wife and I thought of the
[35:55] same scripture as soon as we were doing
[35:58] a little card to give our brother Hayes
[36:03] and says, "With long life will I satisfy
[36:06] him and with my salvation." I said, "You
[36:09] got both."
[36:11] You got both. A lot of people have long
[36:13] life, but they don't have salvation. But
[36:15] it's wonderful to have both.
[36:18] Amen. It's wonderful. Amen.
[36:23] Well, we will go directly to the word
[36:26] and I'll have you stand and turn to the
[36:29] book of Matthew, the 27th chapter.
[36:34] Also, I would like to make a couple of
[36:36] comments before we even turn to the
[36:39] scripture.
[36:42] Please, if you would just stay very very
[36:44] closely focused on the entire message
[36:47] this morning because uh the not only the
[36:51] way that I minister but uh you can't
[36:54] change being who you are and how you see
[36:57] things and and so
[37:00] uh you need to stay from the beginning
[37:03] right to the end of the message in order
[37:06] to really catch uh the thought.
[37:09] Sometimes the principles, critical
[37:13] principles, powerful principles are
[37:16] buried in very simple things.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; And so when you see something coming in,
[37:23] you know, such utter simplicity, you'd
[37:25] think, you know, even when you read some
[37:27] of the things that Jesus spoke, they're
[37:30] they're so simple, but they're so
[37:32] powerful.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; They're profound.
[37:36] And uh they're so simple they're perhaps
[37:39] difficult to actually lay a hold of. And
[37:41] brother Brandham said it's in a
[37:43] simplicity we go right over the top of
[37:44] it. See? So may God help us and help me
[37:48] to
[37:50] uh convey what uh what's on my heart
[37:53] this morning. Then secondly, you'll keep
[37:56] your Bibles close and open because I'm
[37:59] going to be referring to a lot of
[38:01] scripture. So we'll begin to read at the
[38:04] third verse of chapter 27.
[38:09] Then Judas,
[38:12] excuse me, please.
[38:14] Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when
[38:17] he saw that he was condemned, repented
[38:20] himself, and brought again the 30 pieces
[38:23] of silver to the chief priests and
[38:26] elders,
[38:28] saying, I have sinned in that I have
[38:30] betrayed the innocent blood.
[38:34] And they said, What is that to us? See
[38:37] thou to that?
[38:40] And he cast down the pieces of silver in
[38:42] the temple and departed and went and
[38:45] hanged himself. And the chief priest
[38:48] took the piece silver pieces and said,
[38:51] "Is it it is not lawful
[38:54] for to be put into the treasury because
[38:57] it is the price of blood." And they took
[39:01] counsel and bought with them the
[39:03] potter's field to bury strangers in.
[39:08] Wherefore that field was called the
[39:10] field of blood unto this day.
[39:13] And this then was fulfilled that which
[39:16] was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
[39:19] saying, "And they took the 30 pieces of
[39:22] silver, the price of him that was
[39:25] valued, whom they of the children of
[39:28] Israel did value, and they gave them for
[39:32] the potter's field as the Lord appointed
[39:35] me." And that 10th verse is in reference
[39:39] to the prophecy in the scripture.
[39:43] Excuse me.
[39:46] The ninth verse I'd like to read again.
[39:49] then was fulfilled that which was spoken
[39:51] by Jeremy the prophet, saying, "And they
[39:55] took the 30 pieces of silver, the price
[39:58] of him that was valued, whom they of the
[40:02] children of Israel did value." Let's
[40:06] have a word of prayer. Dear Father,
[40:09] we commit this service into your hands.
[40:13] We pray that the mighty Holy Spirit will
[40:17] just take charge of everyone's thoughts
[40:20] and minds and pray dear Lord the thing
[40:23] that you would like to convey will be
[40:27] powerfully brought to the hearts of each
[40:30] individual.
[40:31] Anoint us for service Lord. Anoint me,
[40:35] oh God, I pray. anoint the people and
[40:38] all who will listen and hear this
[40:40] service and be benefited by it. We pray
[40:43] and I desire Lord that people will move
[40:47] higher and love you in a realm in a
[40:50] dimension that they have not yet
[40:52] attained. May there be something of
[40:55] depth oh God something that goes beyond
[40:58] words and beyond emotion. May it be
[41:00] something oh God that is for eternal in
[41:04] the name of Jesus Christ we ask. Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[41:13] I want to speak on the value of him.
[41:17] That's why I read the ninth verse twice.
[41:22] And he's not someone who was just 2,000
[41:25] years ago.
[41:26] The value of him
[41:29] that is present, the value of him that
[41:32] has been revealed,
[41:34] the value of the son of man as was
[41:38] revealed according to Luke 17:30. And
[41:41] we, you, I happen to be living
[41:45] at that very moment
[41:48] when he, the living Christ, is just as
[41:52] real today in word form as he was then
[41:55] in flesh form.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; And I wonder how we value him. Value
[42:03] is to
[42:05] estimate or to fix a value
[42:09] to have in honor or to revere to hold in
[42:14] reverence but more specifically for
[42:17] today's service
[42:19] to make an estimation to look at
[42:22] something make an estimation and place a
[42:25] certain value and say it's worth that.
[42:28] Once you've established a value, then
[42:30] you can also think about what you would
[42:33] give in exchange for that if you needed
[42:35] to give something in exchange.
[42:40] The value of him,
[42:43] there's a vast difference
[42:46] in a set of values.
[42:50] Vast difference.
[42:53] A value is a very very relative word.
[43:00] It goes from one pole to the other.
[43:05] You've heard the term somebody's junk is
[43:08] somebody's treasure.
[43:11] That's what all these garage sales and
[43:16] flea markets and collectible stores and
[43:20] stuff. It's what it's all about.
[43:26] Some lose interest in things that they
[43:29] one time thought was so valuable and
[43:32] occupied a prominent place in their
[43:34] home. And as time went on, it uh went
[43:37] from the home to the basement and from
[43:39] the basement to the garage and from the
[43:40] garage to the dump.
[43:44] But it was really valuable. One day
[43:47] I remember when uh I remember I began to
[43:50] see things that became popular in the
[43:53] old chrome furniture with the buttons on
[43:56] the vinyl chairs and I thought I threw
[43:59] that to the garbage and here people are
[44:02] giving their eye teeth for it. I thought
[44:05] my goodness I should have saved all that
[44:07] junk.
[44:10] We've all gone through that.
[44:14] And the world world is full of stories
[44:16] of people
[44:18] that had possessions
[44:21] and they they they cared for and they
[44:25] treasured for years only to find that it
[44:28] was worthless.
[44:30] Some have thought that they've had, you
[44:32] know, something that was priceless and
[44:34] then they find out it wasn't worth
[44:36] anything. There's been people who
[44:38] thought they had original art hanging on
[44:41] the wall only to find out it was a
[44:44] fraud.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; They thought it was worth millions and
[44:48] treated it like it was worth millions
[44:51] and it wasn't worth anything.
[44:53] And then there are others who have
[44:56] accumulations of stuff that has either
[44:59] been handed down or has been collected
[45:02] over a lifetime.
[45:04] and they discover one day that a
[45:06] discarded item was very valuable.
[45:11] I was in one of our family's homes of
[45:14] this church or here today and I walked
[45:17] in and and I said, "That's a that's a
[45:21] nice painting." Oh, is it? Yeah. I said,
[45:23] "That's a nice painting. That's a
[45:25] well-known artist." It is? Yeah. Where'd
[45:29] you get it? Well, it was, you know, my
[45:30] mother gave it to me.
[45:32] They didn't know what was hanging on the
[45:34] wall. I didn't tell them was hanging on
[45:36] the wall. They might have gone and sold
[45:37] it and bought a car or some other
[45:40] worthless thing.
[45:45] You've all heard and read you that have
[45:47] read the message. We read about the
[45:48] little boy with the stamp,
[45:51] you know, and he ends up and he sells it
[45:52] for a dollar and goes buy some ice cream
[45:54] or something and then next time it was
[45:57] sold for thousands and thousands of
[45:59] dollars. It wasn't the wasn't the size
[46:01] of it.
[46:02] what was on it.
[46:04] So there's a vast vast difference array
[46:07] of evaluation and I don't want to stay
[46:10] on that
[46:12] but we have heard many times
[46:15] that you never really fully appreciate
[46:19] what you have until it's gone.
[46:24] And especially when it comes to our
[46:27] family, our friends,
[46:29] we have someone and then they move away
[46:32] or God takes them and maybe we never put
[46:36] a whole lot of maybe they weren't very
[46:38] visible, never said a whole lot and then
[46:40] we find out really what what it is that
[46:44] we're missing and what it was that we
[46:47] had and we weren't able to really
[46:49] appreciate it.
[46:52] And there has to be some formula
[46:56] to evaluate things. You have to have
[46:58] some comparison or something that is
[47:02] that you can relate to. There are people
[47:05] for example
[47:07] employees in a corporation
[47:10] and they can be one is considered
[47:12] extremely valuable. They're valuable for
[47:16] their skills.
[47:18] They're valuable for what they
[47:19] contribute to the company. They're
[47:21] valuable because they perhaps contribute
[47:25] a great deal to the profitability of the
[47:28] company. The company's successful
[47:32] because of this individual and their
[47:37] business
[47:39] acumen or skills or whatever they call
[47:42] it. And then another person may be very
[47:45] valuable, considered valuable because
[47:47] they have uh management skills or they
[47:51] have technical skills or whatever more.
[47:54] They're they're just extremely valuable
[47:58] to the company. And so there are so many
[48:02] ways that they have a formula to value.
[48:08] The scripture says,
[48:11] "What is a man profited if he shall gain
[48:13] the whole world
[48:16] and lose his own soul? Or what shall a
[48:19] man give in exchange for his soul?"
[48:23] Quite frankly, I think there's a a lot
[48:25] of us, I say us, I include myself
[48:29] in the in the message. I really believe
[48:32] we need to have a refocusing
[48:36] of what is truly valuable.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; I really do. I believe that Satan has
[48:42] been successful at bluffing
[48:45] the population of the earth and it
[48:49] creeps in even amongst believers and
[48:51] it's hard for us to keep our focus and
[48:54] to really see what's valuable,
[48:57] &gt;&gt; what truly is valuable because it has so
[49:00] many flashing lights and things out
[49:02] there and enticements and enchantments
[49:04] and all kinds of things. and you reach
[49:07] for this and reach for that. And when
[49:09] you get a hold of it, you find out it
[49:10] was just a bubble
[49:13] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't really worth all the time
[49:16] we spent, all the energy we spent. And
[49:19] and after all, when it's all done, what
[49:21] have you got?
[49:24] You find out you're just hanging on to
[49:25] some ashes and it just dissipates out of
[49:28] your hands and is gone.
[49:31] what is truly valuable.
[49:38] You know, it's amazing. I find that when
[49:39] I'm studying often
[49:43] little things cross my pathway or
[49:46] someone sends me a little something and
[49:50] every once in a while, Brother Ernie
[49:52] just sends me a little note. And this
[49:55] wasn't even the major part of his note,
[49:58] but at the bottom he just had a little
[50:01] something and it says this. Do not value
[50:04] the things you have in your life, but
[50:08] value who you have in your life.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And I thought that was very important.
[50:16] Do not value the things you have in your
[50:18] life, but value who you have in your
[50:23] life.
[50:25] Now
[50:27] we are here today because we have
[50:30] someone
[50:32] in our life.
[50:35] We have something in common.
[50:38] We have a Christ, a living Christ that's
[50:44] been made known to us through a message.
[50:48] And we have that in common. We have a
[50:50] person.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; He's the man.
[50:53] the man
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. I've been speaking about
[50:57] him. So have others been speaking about
[51:00] him. And as believers of the message,
[51:03] one thing we know, we know.
[51:07] Would you agree with me?
[51:09] &gt;&gt; One thing we know that we're living in
[51:11] the days we sing. These are the days of
[51:14] Elijah. Well, these are the days of the
[51:16] son of man. These are the days. And in a
[51:20] different way, we could say, well,
[51:21] that's been all true all down through
[51:22] history, but not at this level of
[51:24] understanding. Not at this level. They
[51:27] didn't have a message like this back in
[51:30] the days of the martyr, the ox age. They
[51:32] didn't have it in the man age. Didn't
[51:35] have it even not very many years ago.
[51:37] But we have it today.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; We can say we know him.
[51:42] whom to know as life eternal.
[51:46] Just beyond the range of your vision
[51:49] this morning,
[51:51] just beyond the range
[51:54] of this physical eyesight is this man.
[51:59] This person
[52:02] has feelings. He's touched with the
[52:05] feelings of our infirmity.
[52:09] Far more sensitive than we could be.
[52:13] knows more about us, knows more the
[52:16] beginning to the ending, knows all of
[52:18] that. He's watching, has eyes, ears to
[52:22] hear.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; He's here. He's present.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; He has come
[52:29] in that. And that was the purpose
[52:32] of the ministry of a prophet ministry.
[52:35] He couldn't do it without that. And
[52:38] that's why that ministry also has become
[52:41] very dear,
[52:43] priceless,
[52:45] valuable.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Couldn't happen another way. It had to
[52:48] happen this way.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; This was the chosen way. This was the
[52:52] foretold way. This was the ordained way.
[52:55] This was the predestinated way. There
[52:58] was no other way.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; In the message concerned
[53:05] and convinced,
[53:07] Brother Brandham makes this statement
[53:09] and I'm going to take one phrase which
[53:11] I'll repeat when I'm done. I'm convinced
[53:14] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[53:16] forever. I'm convinced in the ministry
[53:20] and the message I'm preaching. I am
[53:23] convinced that it's the truth. I'm
[53:26] convinced that these visions come from
[53:28] God. I'm convinced we're living in the
[53:31] last days. I'm convinced that this very
[53:35] spirit that's on you now is the Holy
[53:38] Ghost.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Glory." And I can say,
[53:41] "Glory." And we should all say, "Glory."
[53:44] &gt;&gt; We're convinced of that.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm thoroughly convinced.
[53:50] I'm convinced that the Holy Ghost way is
[53:52] right. I'm convinced that the Bible way
[53:56] is the truth. I'm convinced." And here's
[53:59] the line. I'm convinced that this is
[54:03] Jesus Christ here now.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ
[54:11] here now. The same Jesus Christ that
[54:15] Judas looked on.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus Christ that he evaluated.
[54:24] The same Jesus Christ that the nation of
[54:27] Israel looked on, watched him, studied
[54:30] him, heard him, weighed out his words,
[54:33] thought about his message, put
[54:36] everything on a scale of evaluation,
[54:38] made an estimation, said he's worth 30
[54:40] pieces of silver.
[54:46] I'm convinced this is Jesus Christ right
[54:48] now.
[54:50] here. Now,
[54:52] I'm convinced if we believe him at this
[54:55] minute,
[54:57] I'm convinced that he'll heal every sick
[55:00] person in a moment, in a twinkling of an
[55:03] eye. Oh, it's wonderful to have that
[55:06] kind of confidence. I'm convinced that
[55:09] he'll heal every sick person right now
[55:12] in the twinkling of an eye.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; This isn't a quote.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[55:24] I'm convinced that he'd pour the Holy
[55:26] Ghost upon here till there'd be such a
[55:30] shout
[55:32] till hard to tell what would take place
[55:36] that I'm convinced.
[55:38] So I asked the question, how do you
[55:40] value him? And what formula do we have?
[55:46] We're going to read in a moment, but
[55:47] don't turn to it just yet. In Matthew
[55:49] 26, the chapter just before
[55:54] the one we read our text from
[55:57] in Matthew 26,
[55:59] Jesus
[56:01] arrives at Bethany.
[56:04] And actually, he arrives six days before
[56:06] the Passover. And the Passover was the
[56:08] pass his last Passover when he would be
[56:11] crucified.
[56:13] So he's coming to a very serious
[56:15] critical time. Before him is the garden
[56:20] of Gethsemane,
[56:23] the last supper,
[56:25] the betrayal, the crucifixion, and his
[56:29] death. All of that is just days ahead of
[56:31] him. And in uh Matthew 26, it's also
[56:37] related in John the 12th chapter. John
[56:40] tells more than Matthew certain details.
[56:45] And Matthew 26 starts two days before
[56:49] the Passover.
[56:52] And the chief priests are now they're
[56:55] very wound up about
[56:58] getting Jesus off the scene and
[57:00] destroying him and killing him. And they
[57:03] have gone to the palace of Caiaphas, the
[57:06] high priest,
[57:08] and they're consulting between
[57:09] themselves. How can we get him? How can
[57:12] we take him subtly? We need a plan to
[57:15] get a to get him and to destroy him.
[57:19] And so they have they have gone to
[57:23] Caiaphas's palace. And now Jesus becomes
[57:26] Jesus is invited to Simon the leper's
[57:29] house for supper. And at the supper is
[57:33] Martha, Mary, and Lazarus who had been
[57:35] raised from the dead. And that they're
[57:38] at Simon the leper's house. Mary is not
[57:41] named in Matthew 26, but she's named in
[57:44] John's gospel. She's called Mary of
[57:47] Bethany for Jesus has come to Bethany.
[57:52] And now we'll read from Matthew 26 from
[57:56] the sixth verse.
[58:01] And I'll make some comments as we
[58:03] proceed.
[58:07] Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the
[58:09] house of Simon the leper, there came
[58:12] unto him a woman who I said now is Mary
[58:15] of Bethany,
[58:17] sister of Lazarus and Martha,
[58:21] having an alabaster box of very precious
[58:25] ointment and poured it on his head as he
[58:30] sat at meat.
[58:33] Now you can just look this way if you
[58:36] would for a moment. This isn't only
[58:40] uh a very unusual thing to happen but
[58:43] it's at a very unusual time and you have
[58:46] to understand that when someone does
[58:49] something of an unusual nature uh e even
[58:53] the the act is unusual but then when
[58:56] they do it at a very unusual time almost
[58:59] could be considered an o awkward time
[59:02] he's sitting at meat and she's driven
[59:06] there's something within her. She just
[59:10] has to do this and she takes and breaks
[59:13] this alabaster box and pours it over his
[59:16] head. And there's indignation amongst
[59:19] the disciples. In fact, as John now
[59:22] mentions the disciple, it was Judas
[59:26] that was had become indignant. But this
[59:29] alabaster box, it was considered to be
[59:33] the very best material to preserve
[59:36] ointments, the very best. So she had the
[59:39] very best that she had.
[59:43] Brother Brandham said she'd probably
[59:44] earned it through a life of
[59:46] prostitution.
[59:50] And she has it in the very best of a of
[59:55] a container that it'll be that it'll be
[59:59] um maintained.
[1:00:02] It's it's precious. Perhaps it's because
[1:00:05] of its scent or its smell and its
[1:00:10] consistency or whatever more. And this
[1:00:13] was the very best container that we had.
[1:00:15] And she had kept this and preserved this
[1:00:17] and had bought this
[1:00:20] with the monies that she had earned.
[1:00:23] And now she sees this one who has
[1:00:27] brought her into this glorious
[1:00:30] experience with him,
[1:00:33] raised her brother from the dead, and
[1:00:36] now they're having a supper. She doesn't
[1:00:39] know anything about Calvary. She doesn't
[1:00:41] know anything about the suffering,
[1:00:43] what's going to happen in the next
[1:00:45] hours, but she's driven.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Let me say something. Neither do you
[1:00:50] know what's going to happen just ahead.
[1:00:52] Neither do we know just a moment that
[1:00:54] we'll be caught away. We don't know
[1:00:56] anything about the rapture except a few
[1:00:58] words, but we're we're here to
[1:01:00] experience some incredible things.
[1:01:03] And as she was and she broke the box,
[1:01:07] poured the oil over his head while he's
[1:01:09] sitting for dinner eating supper.
[1:01:12] And the and the disciples have a
[1:01:14] reaction. And Judas speaks up and why
[1:01:17] was this waste? Why is this wasted like
[1:01:20] this? This could have been sold for 300
[1:01:22] pants and it could have been given to
[1:01:24] the poor. And the scripture says not
[1:01:27] because he cared for the poor but
[1:01:28] because he was a thief.
[1:01:31] That's what was motivating his reaction.
[1:01:35] And then Jesus said this, "She's
[1:01:37] anointed me for my burial." She knew
[1:01:40] nothing about the burial.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; She knew nothing about all this event,
[1:01:44] but she knew she was being driven by the
[1:01:47] spirit of the word because it had to be
[1:01:50] in the word. And this will be told for
[1:01:52] memorial for her throughout all
[1:01:53] generations.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; When the disciples saw it, verse 8, they
[1:02:02] had indignation saying, "To what purpose
[1:02:05] is this waste?"
[1:02:07] There can be some very, very
[1:02:10] spiritual things. Get me now. Spiritual
[1:02:15] things can be considered a waste.
[1:02:18] They can appear to be a waste, a waste
[1:02:21] of time,
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; a waste of energy, a waste of strength,
[1:02:25] a waste of money.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Remember, you cannot have the evaluation
[1:02:30] of the world
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; and apply it to spiritual things.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; People worry about maybe the tithe that
[1:02:39] they give, the tenth that they give, and
[1:02:41] worry about that. And perhaps there's
[1:02:43] those here that don't give it at all.
[1:02:44] It's not your money. You're not giving
[1:02:47] anything.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; It's God's money. And furthermore, it's
[1:02:51] the best investment you can ever make.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; You got money sitting in a CD or in some
[1:02:57] uh certificate in a bank. I can tell you
[1:02:59] it's going downhill
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; just by inflation. But what you put to
[1:03:03] the Lord's work and isn't it marvelous?
[1:03:06] I have such a liberty because we're not
[1:03:08] taking an offering. We're not trying to
[1:03:10] pull anything out of your pocket. I'm
[1:03:12] trying to tell you what we have is an
[1:03:14] evaluation in God's word.
[1:03:17] And
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you that God's going to
[1:03:19] bless you and God's going to do this and
[1:03:21] God that's the wrong motivation. But I
[1:03:23] can tell you I've had people come into
[1:03:26] this congregation, get saved and come
[1:03:27] and counel with me and said, "We can't
[1:03:29] afford to give. We've here here it is."
[1:03:32] And they had it all written out. They
[1:03:34] had their income and at the bottom
[1:03:35] they're at a negative. They said, "How
[1:03:37] can we pay our tithes?" I said, "You
[1:03:40] know, it's God's business. It's not for
[1:03:41] me to tell you.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the word says. He says,
[1:03:44] "We're going to start paying our
[1:03:46] tithes." They came to me 2, three months
[1:03:48] later. They said, "We have an absolute
[1:03:50] miracle." And furthermore, it doesn't
[1:03:52] even make it doesn't even make
[1:03:54] mathematical sense. We've been paying
[1:03:56] our tithes, paying all our bills, and
[1:03:58] we've got $200 left over.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; God's got more ways.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; He owns the cattle on a thousand hills.
[1:04:09] He doesn't need our filthy lucer. But
[1:04:12] it's it's our benefit that we are able
[1:04:14] to give to God's work. Not only give of
[1:04:17] money, but give of our time, give of our
[1:04:19] home, give of our service, give and be
[1:04:22] be hospitable. Amen. Look for ways to
[1:04:26] bless. When you find those people around
[1:04:28] the church, you young people, you set
[1:04:30] those young, you set those folks, those
[1:04:32] families, those couples, you set them as
[1:04:34] an example
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; and seek to follow that example.
[1:04:41] Why are you quiet?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Open your door. Open your heart.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Open your house. Open your pocketbook.
[1:04:49] Open up everything. Say, "God, it's not
[1:04:52] mine. It's all yours. My life is yours."
[1:04:55] If you live for yourself, you lose.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What you're holding tight,
[1:05:01] you've already lost.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; You couldn't bind me up if you tried. I
[1:05:09] feel such liberty here today. I might
[1:05:11] even take an offering.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a shock?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:22] And for this ointment, verse n, for this
[1:05:25] ointment might have been sold for much,
[1:05:28] and given to the poor. And when Jesus
[1:05:30] understood it, he said unto them, Why
[1:05:33] trouble ye the woman? For she hath
[1:05:35] wrought a good work upon me.
[1:05:38] For ye have the poor always with you,
[1:05:40] but me you have not always. For in that
[1:05:43] she hath poured this ointment on my
[1:05:45] body, she did it for my burial. Verily I
[1:05:49] say unto you, wheresoever this gospel
[1:05:52] shall be preached in the whole world,
[1:05:54] there shall also this that this woman,
[1:05:57] this woman hath done, we be told for a
[1:06:01] memorial for her. Then one of the twel
[1:06:03] called Judas a scariot went unto the
[1:06:06] chief priests and said unto them, "What
[1:06:10] will you give me?"
[1:06:12] And I will deliver him unto you. And
[1:06:16] they covenanted with him
[1:06:19] for 30 pieces of silver.
[1:06:22] And from that time he sought opportunity
[1:06:25] to betray him.
[1:06:27] We have two individuals,
[1:06:30] one man
[1:06:31] and one woman.
[1:06:35] And this is an extreme paradox.
[1:06:39] One woman feels that this person is
[1:06:44] worth absolutely everything
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; that I have
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; and everything that I have ever earned.
[1:06:52] everything my entire life which is
[1:06:55] wrapped up in this alabaster box.
[1:07:02] I'll just pour it on his head.
[1:07:05] It may look like a total waste and it
[1:07:07] will be gone. I can never collect it
[1:07:09] again. My whole life savings are gone.
[1:07:14] But this moment demands it.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; This is the value of this moment. and I
[1:07:22] must do it.
[1:07:24] And here's another man who's seen the
[1:07:27] miracles, who has participated in the
[1:07:30] ministry, who sat in the message church
[1:07:33] and sat with not only the prophet but
[1:07:35] the God prophet
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; and saw the miracles and was part of it
[1:07:40] and went preaching the gospel and saw
[1:07:42] and participated in that great ministry
[1:07:45] and came back rejoicing.
[1:07:50] And he views the entire
[1:07:53] life and all the events and comes up
[1:07:57] with a value
[1:07:59] that 30 pieces of silver
[1:08:03] will be sufficient for me to betray him.
[1:08:11] Brother Brandham said, "God's gifts
[1:08:13] always find their place."
[1:08:16] This woman
[1:08:18] brought this myrr and anointed
[1:08:22] that anointed costly something to take
[1:08:25] the smell of death away.
[1:08:29] She certainly didn't know that.
[1:08:33] She didn't know she broke the alabaster
[1:08:35] box. This is going to take the smell of
[1:08:37] death away. It's a simple thing.
[1:08:42] She broke the alabaster box and poured
[1:08:44] it upon the head of Jesus. And Judas
[1:08:47] said, "Why was this ought to have been
[1:08:50] given to the poor,
[1:08:52] not that he had respect for the poor,
[1:08:54] but he was a thief to begin with?" He
[1:08:56] carried the money.
[1:08:59] Said, "This ought
[1:09:02] put it." Jesus said, "Let her alone, for
[1:09:04] she did this. She anointed him onto his
[1:09:07] burial. This woman was grateful.
[1:09:11] Now, I have this. Here's the highlighted
[1:09:14] part. This woman was grateful that her
[1:09:17] sins were forgiven
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; until she spent her all her money she
[1:09:23] had and took an alabaster box and broke
[1:09:27] it and poured the oil and just ordered
[1:09:31] the room with fine smell of this myrr
[1:09:34] that she had anointed him for his death.
[1:09:38] And now see, she did the service not
[1:09:42] knowing what she was doing, but she was
[1:09:46] so grateful to God.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, folks. You're not just
[1:09:51] hearing a sermon. There's enough people
[1:09:53] in here today with the very presence of
[1:09:56] God and the experience that you've had,
[1:09:58] you can look upon it. You can see it
[1:10:00] within you. You can say, "This is so
[1:10:02] priceless. This is so precious. I'm
[1:10:04] going to let I'm going to let the order
[1:10:07] of this experience fill this place.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to affect others. Going to
[1:10:13] influence them by the life and the
[1:10:16] association and the relationship and the
[1:10:19] love that I have. It will be visible.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Others will see it.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; She wasn't doing it to be seen. She
[1:10:27] wasn't doing it to be somebody. She was
[1:10:29] doing it because she was releasing the
[1:10:32] love she had. And the love that we have
[1:10:34] in our heart has to go a lot further
[1:10:36] than singing a song.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. And sometimes
[1:10:40] it's even hard to get people to open
[1:10:42] their mouth and to sing and to worship.
[1:10:44] I say we ought to be absolutely
[1:10:46] liberated to express what we have in our
[1:10:49] hearts for God.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; You won't scare me
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; if you raise your voice
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; and scream a praise to the Lord. Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; You won't scare me or anyone else
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; if you shouted out, "I love him."
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; You'll do somebody some good
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; if you get carried away
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; with something that's in your heart.
[1:11:23] And then it was what we read.
[1:11:26] Judas that betrayed him when he saw that
[1:11:29] he was condemned.
[1:11:32] One place brother Brandon was saying he
[1:11:34] didn't really expect it to happen like
[1:11:36] that. When he saw he was condemned he
[1:11:38] saw you know sometimes
[1:11:42] God help me. Sometimes we have some
[1:11:45] little idea. Sometime we have some
[1:11:47] thought, sometime we have some personal
[1:11:49] opinion or personal characteristic
[1:11:52] within our family or within the church
[1:11:55] or within where you work or whatever
[1:11:57] more. We have some little thing and we
[1:11:59] hold it and it's so dear and we hold it
[1:12:01] so tight and we can cause such a fuss
[1:12:03] over it and then when all is said and
[1:12:05] done, it doesn't mean anything.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; It's not worth two cents.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; But to us, it's so priceless.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But when we think of
[1:12:17] It can come down to any area of our
[1:12:20] life. As as as believers,
[1:12:23] you hear it preached, we ought to dress
[1:12:25] a certain way.
[1:12:28] You say, "Well, it's so hard.
[1:12:34] so hard to change or
[1:12:39] I mentioned once here in the church just
[1:12:41] a oneliner
[1:12:43] about women's skirts with a zipper in
[1:12:45] front. I never had such an uproar.
[1:12:50] Never had such an uproar over a oneline
[1:12:52] statement in the church. And I had some,
[1:12:58] you know, I never even expected to ever
[1:13:01] hear a remark about it ever, but I had
[1:13:04] some that contact me said, "I went home
[1:13:06] and I cleaned out my closet
[1:13:09] and I just got rid of them." I had
[1:13:11] others that said, "You can't find it in
[1:13:12] the word of God and you can't find it in
[1:13:14] the message." And and there the zipper
[1:13:17] became important,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; really valuable.
[1:13:22] But when all is said and done, what does
[1:13:24] it mean? Nothing.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; But who are you affecting? Who are you
[1:13:27] influencing?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Is it got brownie points to the plus
[1:13:32] side? Is this, you know, is this the way
[1:13:35] that I'm intending or the way that I'm
[1:13:37] determined to, you know, conduct myself
[1:13:39] or whatever more? Is it is it
[1:13:41] influencing people into a spiritual
[1:13:44] dimension and a relationship? Are are
[1:13:46] you doing something for the Lord or is
[1:13:48] it for oursel? Oh, I made a point. Oh, I
[1:13:52] want a disciple.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:13:58] You got a disciple. You got somebody on
[1:14:00] your side. You got somebody that agrees
[1:14:02] with you. I say
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; that's all it means. Just nothing.
[1:14:20] Good. I've got a long time yet.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Not really.
[1:14:31] How can we ever or we can never fully
[1:14:34] comprehend
[1:14:36] how great men of the scripture,
[1:14:40] men living honorable lives,
[1:14:43] men living a life that the prophet said
[1:14:45] you couldn't put a finger on their life.
[1:14:49] How could they ever come up and with
[1:14:53] even an inclination within them? We need
[1:14:56] to kill this man.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't these aren't light words.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; These are great,
[1:15:07] spiritually
[1:15:09] admired and honored men.
[1:15:13] Actually having a a meeting.
[1:15:18] How can we not how can we do away with
[1:15:20] this man and and send him to another
[1:15:22] place or how can we just you know remove
[1:15:24] his influence but how can we kill him
[1:15:28] how can we destroy him how can we subtly
[1:15:30] do this
[1:15:33] and in that meeting they're actually
[1:15:34] making an evaluation
[1:15:37] and how could Jesus accompany how could
[1:15:39] Judas accompany Jesus and take part of
[1:15:42] the ministry and betray him the
[1:15:45] scripture says that he may take part of
[1:15:48] this ministry, an apostilhip
[1:15:52] because they chose another
[1:15:55] another one that would take Judas's
[1:15:57] apostilhip from which Judas by
[1:16:00] transgression fell. And here's why he
[1:16:03] did it. That he might go to his own
[1:16:06] place.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about the four
[1:16:09] that died at Calvary,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; the son of God and the son of predition
[1:16:15] and one thief. The Bible says that Judas
[1:16:18] went out and hung himself.
[1:16:21] The son of God on one tree, the son of
[1:16:23] predition on another tree with the
[1:16:26] thief. One thief
[1:16:28] saw something
[1:16:30] said, "Lord, remember me
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; when you come into your kingdom." He saw
[1:16:36] he saw something that the disciples on
[1:16:38] the ground failed to see.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; They saw the kingdom crumbling. He saw
[1:16:42] it coming into power.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; He never saw the first pulls. never saw
[1:16:46] the second pull, never heard the third
[1:16:48] pull, but he had a revelation of who it
[1:16:51] was that was gasping his last breath
[1:16:53] beside him. Lord,
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. When you come into your
[1:16:58] kingdom, remember me. That's all.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Today, you'll be with me in paradise.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the other son of
[1:17:07] predition died on a tree also and took
[1:17:10] the other one, cursing his way to hell.
[1:17:14] And the prophet said, "The son of
[1:17:16] predition came from hell and went to
[1:17:18] hell.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And the son of God came from heaven and
[1:17:22] went to heaven."
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; We're in the midst of a incredible
[1:17:28] experience. Friends, you have a short
[1:17:31] life. Remember, you're not going to go
[1:17:33] this way again. You have a very short
[1:17:35] life. Wait till you get to my age. You
[1:17:36] find out how fast it went. Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You that are young and you that have
[1:17:45] your youth. And my oh how I would love
[1:17:49] to be in my teens again and be able to
[1:17:53] start give youth and my strength
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; to this one and pour out something that
[1:18:00] would be fragrant upon his name.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; How I would be careful not to bring
[1:18:05] marks against this message. I like to
[1:18:08] live such an honorable way so that
[1:18:11] people could look and find a beacon
[1:18:13] light
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; beaming out.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; People that love God, people that are
[1:18:19] stable, people who consider the message
[1:18:22] worth more than anything else in life.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Sometime people get their eyes on what
[1:18:30] God pours in. I tell you what, God pours
[1:18:32] in so we can pour out. So we can bless
[1:18:36] the bride of Jesus Christ with whatever
[1:18:38] we have or whatever God puts in our
[1:18:41] hands.
[1:18:44] Judas saw
[1:18:48] and walked with the word in flesh form.
[1:18:53] And I want to superimpose upon your
[1:18:56] minds. You are walking with the same
[1:18:59] word, the same Christ in word form. And
[1:19:03] there is no difference. The word was
[1:19:05] made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And now the now he he has been made
[1:19:13] word, revealed word and dwells among us.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Our heart our hands have handled.
[1:19:23] Our eyes have looked upon him.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; God himself in word form in the second
[1:19:31] coming message.
[1:19:34] Brother Brandham said, "It's God's
[1:19:35] infallible, eternal, everpresent word."
[1:19:38] And frankly, it's God himself living in
[1:19:42] word form.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; It's God himself. God has fills all time
[1:19:50] and space. God has funneled himself down
[1:19:52] and has come into word form.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I wonder if Judas could actually grasp.
[1:19:59] I don't believe that he could. I don't
[1:20:00] believe that he did. that this one that
[1:20:02] he was actually walking with and could
[1:20:04] see his hands and perhaps see the veins
[1:20:07] in his hands and see him as he studied
[1:20:10] him as he took the bread and broke the
[1:20:12] bread and took the fishes and and and
[1:20:14] and saw him and saw him got tired and
[1:20:16] saw him asleep in the boat. I doubt that
[1:20:19] he actually could grasp in his heart
[1:20:22] what is in him created the ground I'm
[1:20:25] standing on. What is in him caused this
[1:20:29] wheat to grow that I'm eating this bread
[1:20:32] from? I doubt if he'd grasp that.
[1:20:39] I prayed and I'm praying that even now
[1:20:42] that somehow
[1:20:44] your minds will be illuminated
[1:20:47] that this is not just a message. This
[1:20:50] isn't just something we say brother
[1:20:51] Brandham said. This isn't just that.
[1:20:54] This has been a divinelyapp appointed
[1:20:56] servant that there could be no other way
[1:20:59] had to come at this time. And God knew
[1:21:01] that you'd be born in the day you're
[1:21:03] born. He knew you'd be breathing his
[1:21:05] free air and in his sunshine at this
[1:21:07] certain time. He knew that you'd be
[1:21:09] sitting exactly where you are, hearing
[1:21:12] exactly what you're hearing and having
[1:21:14] some little uh preacher tell you it's a
[1:21:16] living Christ alive present here now.
[1:21:20] The same one
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; that the woman appraised
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; as being worth more than all she had.
[1:21:27] It's the same one that Judas appraised
[1:21:30] for 30 pieces of silver and the nation
[1:21:32] of Israel. The value of him whom they
[1:21:36] valued.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; And the infallible word of God said,
[1:21:44] "The reason I rest my faith upon this
[1:21:46] word because I believe it to be the word
[1:21:48] of God." And then if it is the word of
[1:21:50] God, it's God himself in word form.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And then in the invisible union, just
[1:21:57] exactly he said like the grain that went
[1:21:59] into the ground in the ground. The same
[1:22:02] Jesus Christ in the bride form, same
[1:22:06] power, same church, same thing, same
[1:22:09] word. Do you believe that?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; It's the same Jesus Christ, the same God
[1:22:16] has written word. The word became flesh.
[1:22:18] That was Jesus Christ. That same Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ now has come in word form in a
[1:22:24] generation that is an intellectual
[1:22:26] generation, a cultured generation. He
[1:22:29] came in word form,
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; but it's still him. Exactly. Precisely
[1:22:34] him.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; They could pour physical oil on him. You
[1:22:39] can pour the oil of your life upon him.
[1:22:41] You can pour the oil of your of what God
[1:22:44] has given you. You can pour it upon him.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, those earnings were from
[1:22:50] her sinful life. The very body that you
[1:22:54] have was born in sin and shapen
[1:22:56] iniquity." But here, it's become a
[1:22:59] vessel that you can actually contain
[1:23:01] something to pour it out upon him, the
[1:23:05] word, this Christ, this message
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; and all that it represents.
[1:23:15] As much as you've done it to one of the
[1:23:17] least of these, my brethren,
[1:23:20] you've done it unto me.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; When you give that cup of cold water,
[1:23:26] when you sisters are doing the dishes,
[1:23:29] that same Lord Jesus looking at you,
[1:23:31] you're doing those dishes for him. You
[1:23:34] served him. You served someone. You
[1:23:36] served the believers. You served your
[1:23:38] family. You served your husband. You
[1:23:40] brethren that are out working, you're
[1:23:42] laboring. You say, "What is this all
[1:23:44] about?" You're laboring for one. There's
[1:23:46] only one purpose in life. Everything
[1:23:48] else Everything else is ashes and
[1:23:51] worthless. And please tell me what this
[1:23:53] bucket of ashes is worth. It's worth
[1:23:55] nothing. Unless we use it only as a as a
[1:23:59] tool, as an instrument. We have an
[1:24:01] evaluation. We say, "If I can do this,
[1:24:04] praise God, then I can do that. I can
[1:24:07] support my home. I can have a place
[1:24:09] where I can have people. I can witness
[1:24:12] to them. I can speak to them. This is my
[1:24:14] whole life. This is what I breathe for.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Don't sit and just look at me today.
[1:24:25] I want you to say, "I'm getting it,
[1:24:27] brother Ed.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I'm getting it.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I'm getting the message. I'm
[1:24:31] understanding. I'm getting it. By God's
[1:24:33] grace, I want to pour myself into it.
[1:24:36] And I want to pour myself upon the very
[1:24:39] head of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; So it's Jesus Christ.
[1:24:50] You believe everything else. Brother
[1:24:51] Brandham said, "Let's believe this. It's
[1:24:54] Jesus Christ in bride form."
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; You're sitting beside him.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; You're sitting beside him today. This
[1:25:06] isn't some poetic license. You're
[1:25:08] sitting beside him.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; This is the bride.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; This is him
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; in bride form.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; No different. It's the same one that
[1:25:18] Judas looked on.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Let's not sell out one another. Let's
[1:25:22] not discredit one another.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And you'll never have another Christ
[1:25:29] that you can pour your life out on. He's
[1:25:32] not going to come your way physically
[1:25:33] for you to pour oil on. He's here now.
[1:25:36] This is your chance.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; If I leave the scene, don't ever forget
[1:25:45] this. This is your day.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; This is your chance. Don't miss it.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I challenge you young men. I challenge
[1:26:02] you people.
[1:26:03] Don't miss this opportunity.
[1:26:12] Each of us must make our estimation
[1:26:16] and place a value accordingly.
[1:26:21] Moses looked,
[1:26:25] Brother Brandham said, through the same
[1:26:27] window that Pharaoh looked through.
[1:26:34] When Pharaoh looked through the window,
[1:26:36] he said, "Look at those mudbers.
[1:26:39] Look at these slaves I have. Look at
[1:26:41] what they're building for me. I got this
[1:26:44] entire nation under my control. A bunch
[1:26:47] of slaves, worthless slaves."
[1:26:51] Moses came up to the window.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "They're God's seed.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; They're God's chosen. These are the
[1:27:00] children of God. These are the people
[1:27:03] that are holding a promise.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Both of them looked out the same window.
[1:27:11] Both of them had a totally different
[1:27:13] evaluation of what it was they were
[1:27:15] seeing.
[1:27:27] Wasn't just Moses.
[1:27:29] Thank God for the message.
[1:27:31] Brother Brandham said it was God. It was
[1:27:34] God, Christ in Moses.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; It was Christ and Moses that saw things
[1:27:39] the way he saw them.
[1:27:43] He said he looked he looked at the
[1:27:44] unseen. I love this.
[1:27:47] So Moses when he looked out the window,
[1:27:49] he was looking at the unseen.
[1:27:53] This is what he saw.
[1:27:56] He saw the years that were coming ahead.
[1:27:59] Oh my, I'm so touched. I'm just praying
[1:28:03] God to help me through the rest of this
[1:28:04] service.
[1:28:06] I've been waiting for this moment to
[1:28:08] come and preach to you.
[1:28:13] He said he saw Egypt destroyed.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; I wonder if God could give you that
[1:28:20] eyesight. every person here today when
[1:28:23] you go to your place of work and
[1:28:25] endeavor tomorrow. I pray that God will
[1:28:28] give you eyesight that you'll see this
[1:28:30] world destroyed.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Fire
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; is hanging in the heavens.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that this
[1:28:40] elements will melt with fervent heat
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; and Moses saw
[1:28:46] Egypt destroyed. And furthermore,
[1:28:48] brother Brandham said Moses saw when he
[1:28:52] was standing over Egypt walking in the
[1:28:55] palatial palaces of the superpower of
[1:28:58] the earth.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; He said he saw Egypt as they are today.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he says in this
[1:29:08] clock.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; He saw Egypt as they are today.
[1:29:12] Oh
[1:29:13] God, help us
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; to see this lesson age that we're in as
[1:29:18] God sees it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; All this fine things and all these fine
[1:29:22] homes and all these fine automobiles and
[1:29:25] all of this luxury. Let's see it as God
[1:29:28] sees it.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; God give you eyesight today that you'll
[1:29:32] see it's worthless. It's ashes. Yes, we
[1:29:35] must have it. We must we must do our
[1:29:38] conduct our affairs in a stewardship
[1:29:40] manner. But we can we we can deal with
[1:29:44] this world as God sees it
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; and see it as God sees it.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Get all you can, learn all you can, and
[1:29:52] give all you can.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you to remain ignores.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Don't go to school. That's all I'm
[1:30:00] saying. Get all the education you can if
[1:30:03] that's how God leads you. Earn all you
[1:30:06] can. Give all you can.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Be all you can.
[1:30:17] He saw Egypt as she is today. He saw
[1:30:21] Israel.
[1:30:23] Now this takes quite some eyesight
[1:30:25] friends.
[1:30:27] In fact is this takes a greater uh
[1:30:31] capacity of eyesight than I'm asking
[1:30:34] that God give you today.
[1:30:39] He looked on people. You haven't seen
[1:30:41] them. You haven't seen any of these
[1:30:42] people here stomping in mud and straw
[1:30:46] squeezing between their toes. You
[1:30:48] haven't seen them each other. You
[1:30:50] haven't seen that. Maybe you've seen
[1:30:52] each other in work clothes or seen each
[1:30:54] other in in our school or studies or
[1:30:56] whatever more. He saw them trampling in
[1:30:59] the mud. And when he saw them, the
[1:31:02] prophet of God says he saw them
[1:31:05] comfortably
[1:31:06] in the bosom of Abraham.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. If you could look around
[1:31:13] this congregation today and see the
[1:31:15] bride member of Jesus Christ that's
[1:31:18] beside you in this body called the body
[1:31:21] of Jesus Christ. I wish that God would
[1:31:24] give you eyesight that you could see
[1:31:26] that person comfortably in the bosom of
[1:31:29] God in the other land. If you could see
[1:31:32] them in the rapture,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; how valuable that person that's beside
[1:31:39] you. You see them in a rapture. You see
[1:31:41] them in a glorified body.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help me.
[1:31:49] That's the kind of eyesight you need in
[1:31:51] order to live the way we ought to live.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; In order to interact the way we ought to
[1:31:57] interact.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; We see them in the bosom of God.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; We see them glorified.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; It will take away the humanity.
[1:32:24] says he saw them comfortably seated
[1:32:27] around Abraham in glory.
[1:32:31] When I read that, I said, "God, we need
[1:32:33] that.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; We need that. I need that. You need
[1:32:36] that. The church needs it. Believers of
[1:32:39] the message around the world need that.
[1:32:41] They need to see one another seated
[1:32:43] comfortably in heaven in the bosom of
[1:32:46] God. Uh we need to see each other that
[1:32:49] way
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; in glory
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; and by faith he chose to take the worst
[1:33:07] the worst the religion could give him
[1:33:12] and he compared it he estimated it with
[1:33:15] the best that the world could give him.
[1:33:17] Moses looked at the very worst that
[1:33:20] religion could give him
[1:33:24] and he compared it with the very best
[1:33:26] that the world could give him and he
[1:33:28] chose to suffer the reproach of Christ
[1:33:31] and considered it a greater treasure
[1:33:34] than all of Egypt could offer or afford
[1:33:36] to give him because he endured as seeing
[1:33:39] him who was invisible. And don't think
[1:33:41] that just as a phrase if you want to
[1:33:43] endure. And there's a lot of folks that
[1:33:45] don't endure. But we need people that
[1:33:47] will endure. You're this way today.
[1:33:50] You're victorious today. You're
[1:33:51] victorious tomorrow. Say, "How do I have
[1:33:53] that kind of life?" It depends what
[1:33:55] you're looking at.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; And if you see what I'm talking about
[1:34:00] today, you live a different kind of
[1:34:03] life.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And you will endure.
[1:34:12] I haven't got time but the gentile
[1:34:15] warriors of David
[1:34:18] believe brother Vin was probably the
[1:34:20] first I remember hearing just mentioning
[1:34:22] the gentile warriors because he spoke
[1:34:24] quite a bit about it but the gentile
[1:34:26] warriors of David it wasn't just what
[1:34:30] they saw but on the other hand they were
[1:34:32] associated with someone who was rejected
[1:34:37] someone who was running for his life.
[1:34:40] Someone who appeared to be defeated,
[1:34:43] but they knew that he'd been anointed as
[1:34:45] king.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And so that's what they that's what they
[1:34:48] kept their eyes on. They knew he had
[1:34:51] been anointed as king.
[1:34:54] The the prophet said his own people
[1:34:56] kicked him out
[1:34:58] and they didn't want nothing to do with
[1:35:00] him.
[1:35:01] Saul ran him out. The head of the
[1:35:04] denomination kicked him out. have
[1:35:07] nothing to do with him. The council
[1:35:08] kicked him out and he became a fugitive.
[1:35:12] They had to go wherever they could.
[1:35:18] I wonder if we were in some warehouse.
[1:35:22] Hello.
[1:35:25] If we were in some warehouse
[1:35:28] and we never had, you know, the grand
[1:35:31] piano, but maybe something with the
[1:35:32] ivory off of the keys
[1:35:35] and maybe a little out of tune
[1:35:38] and you weren't sitting where you're
[1:35:40] sitting today, but you were sitting on
[1:35:41] some hard seats
[1:35:44] and you had a tough time at the border
[1:35:47] and you had a flat tire coming to church
[1:35:49] and you came from Chilowak or you came
[1:35:50] from the Northshore in Vancouver and you
[1:35:53] had difficult coming here and all the
[1:35:55] rest of it and then you're sitting here.
[1:35:58] I wonder if we were just in a warehouse,
[1:36:01] would we all be here?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Why do you say that? Because I'm
[1:36:09] preaching on the value.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; The value of him.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Is he worth it?
[1:36:32] I'm trying to work to a closing, but now
[1:36:35] I come to the most critical spot
[1:36:40] in Isaiah 53. Don't turn to it. I'll
[1:36:43] just speak from it because I like your
[1:36:45] attention. Now
[1:36:48] in Isaiah 53,
[1:36:52] it starts out
[1:36:54] and I just begin to see this in such
[1:36:56] powerful
[1:36:59] such a powerful way. Who has believed
[1:37:02] our report?
[1:37:06] And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:37:08] revealed? Four. Now he begins to give
[1:37:12] out the description.
[1:37:15] How can anybody believe this report?
[1:37:17] Who's going to believe this report? For
[1:37:19] he comes up out of the ground, out of
[1:37:21] dry ground
[1:37:23] as a tender plant
[1:37:26] out of dry ground.
[1:37:29] And he's rejected.
[1:37:32] He's esteemed of God.
[1:37:36] He's afflicted.
[1:37:39] He's acquainted with grief
[1:37:42] and sorrows
[1:37:44] and we all hid our face as it were from
[1:37:47] him. Who's going to believe that this is
[1:37:51] the son of God? Who's going to believe
[1:37:53] this one came from heaven? Who's going
[1:37:55] to believe he's going to be the
[1:37:57] atonement and redemption will be
[1:37:59] accomplished through him?
[1:38:01] Who's going to associate theirel with
[1:38:03] him?
[1:38:07] And there's no place in the entire
[1:38:09] chapter of of Isaiah 53, the prophecy,
[1:38:12] entire prophecy of Jesus Christ. There's
[1:38:14] no place to polish him up.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; There's no place to make him more
[1:38:19] palatable.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; There's no place to make him nicer.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; No place to make him more popular or
[1:38:26] accepted to the world.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; He is rejected. He has been rejected and
[1:38:31] he's still rejected.
[1:38:36] This is him.
[1:38:41] I can't stop speaking about him.
[1:38:44] He's gripped and captivated by life.
[1:39:00] He shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:39:02] plant
[1:39:03] and as a root out of dry dry ground.
[1:39:07] He hath no form nor calmliness. And
[1:39:10] calmliness is he has no splendor. He has
[1:39:13] no glory. He has no honor. He has no
[1:39:16] majesty.
[1:39:20] Who's going to believe this report?
[1:39:23] Who's going to believe this message is
[1:39:25] really what it is? Oh, it gathers an
[1:39:28] accumulation of people, but do they
[1:39:31] really know it's him?
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Him.
[1:39:42] And when we we shall see him,
[1:39:46] when you see him,
[1:39:49] there is no beauty.
[1:39:52] There is no beauty and there's no way to
[1:39:54] make him beautiful.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I've saved a long article.
[1:40:02] I won't even get into it now, but they
[1:40:04] just had, you know, the anniversary of
[1:40:08] Princess Diana's death.
[1:40:12] And everybody had different thought
[1:40:13] about it. And I don't read, I don't get
[1:40:15] a newspaper other than what is scattered
[1:40:17] at my door.
[1:40:20] But it was when I was away and someone
[1:40:22] in Europe wrote about
[1:40:26] how the world has caught up with
[1:40:29] her death and this anniversary and the
[1:40:31] commercialization of it.
[1:40:35] And they said this generation is a is
[1:40:39] gripped by a beauty cult.
[1:40:44] everything. I won't say everything, but
[1:40:47] so much of it, billions and billions and
[1:40:51] billions of dollars could feed, I'm
[1:40:53] sure, the entire poor world with what is
[1:40:57] spent on beauty products
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; and the operations and the cosmetic
[1:41:02] surgeries and all that takes place to
[1:41:05] reshape the body and reshape the face
[1:41:08] and to make things more more wonderful
[1:41:11] and more beautiful. And this man who I'm
[1:41:14] sure has no spiritual direction is not
[1:41:17] coming from a spiritual direction
[1:41:19] identifies a whole generation as a
[1:41:22] generation of people gripped with the
[1:41:24] beauty cult.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; You talk about a lot of cults and people
[1:41:28] call this a cult. I'll tell you those
[1:41:29] that are gripped with this whole beauty
[1:41:31] business, that's a cult
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and it's a lie.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; And it's taking people to hell
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; and it's making them something that they
[1:41:41] aren't.
[1:41:44] They're not that.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; They put on all expensive garments and
[1:41:48] shape their bodies in a certain way and
[1:41:50] all kinds of this idol and that idol and
[1:41:53] whatever. It is idolatry.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Absolutely idolatry. The magazines are
[1:41:58] full of it. The newspaper's full of it.
[1:42:00] Everything's full of it. It's all a
[1:42:01] beauty cult.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; But there's no beauty in him.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And we can't make him beautiful. But yet
[1:42:10] to us as a believer, we say as a bride
[1:42:14] in the Song of Solomon that, "Oh, he's
[1:42:17] more wonderful."
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; 10,000 times 10,000. Can't compare with
[1:42:24] him. He's all together lovely.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Do you see him that way?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[1:42:41] These are simple things, but that is why
[1:42:44] I just get so moved.
[1:42:48] And on the tape, I hear I can actually
[1:42:50] see it visibly.
[1:42:52] Brother Brand, I'm standing there and a
[1:42:53] woman comes up
[1:42:56] and in that presence,
[1:42:59] he just utters
[1:43:01] quietly,
[1:43:04] "Isn't he lovely?
[1:43:09] Oh God,
[1:43:12] how how how could the Lord Jesus stand
[1:43:15] by and not give that woman what she had
[1:43:18] need of when two people meet
[1:43:21] and that servant that knows him so well,
[1:43:25] doesn't have to preach her a sermon. He
[1:43:27] just says, "Isn't he lovely?"
[1:43:32] friends,
[1:43:34] if I never preach another service,
[1:43:38] quite frankly, I'm weary.
[1:43:41] I don't I don't I don't have a fondness.
[1:43:44] I don't have any itch to preach.
[1:43:47] I'd like to just go
[1:43:49] and spend time with him
[1:43:53] because he's lovely.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; He's altogether lovely.
[1:44:01] I would like to convey that to you.
[1:44:03] Don't go out these doors and forget
[1:44:05] that.
[1:44:09] You say, "Well, Brother Ed, yeah, you're
[1:44:12] an old white-haired man." Just let me
[1:44:14] tell you something. Some of my most
[1:44:16] precious times that I had in my life was
[1:44:20] when I was in my teens.
[1:44:23] And what he is tonight, he was then.
[1:44:28] I saw him in the flowers.
[1:44:30] I saw him in the trees. Brother Brandham
[1:44:33] talks of hearing his voice
[1:44:36] in the
[1:44:38] wind of the trees.
[1:44:41] It's simple, isn't it? But try to get
[1:44:44] that try to get into that atmosphere
[1:44:47] down in Vancouver or in the mall or at
[1:44:51] Bellis Fair. You won't find it there.
[1:45:05] He's despised.
[1:45:08] He's rejected of men.
[1:45:11] He's a man of sorrows.
[1:45:14] He's acquainted with grief.
[1:45:17] And we hid, as it were, our faces from
[1:45:19] him.
[1:45:20] He's despised,
[1:45:23] and we esteemed him not. Surely
[1:45:27] he hath borne our griefs and carried our
[1:45:31] sorrows.
[1:45:32] And when we saw him,
[1:45:35] there was no beauty. Do you know why?
[1:45:38] You were looking at your own sorrow and
[1:45:41] your own grief and your own sin.
[1:45:47] And there's no way it could be lovely.
[1:45:54] He was carrying your life.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; He was carrying your penalty.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; There's no way for it to be attractive.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; He was oppressed.
[1:46:11] He was afflicted.
[1:46:13] And he opened not his mouth. He wasn't
[1:46:16] He didn't have a command of his
[1:46:17] vocabulary. Listen, this is the same
[1:46:20] Jesus Christ. This isn't a story. This
[1:46:23] isn't just a prophecy. This is the one
[1:46:25] who you say you love and you serve. This
[1:46:28] is him.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And he can't be anything else.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Are you weary with my preaching?
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Are you getting a hold of what I'm
[1:46:39] saying?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; And it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[1:46:47] and put him to grief.
[1:46:49] You shall make his soul when thou hast
[1:46:51] made his soul an offering for sin. My
[1:46:55] sin,
[1:46:57] your sin.
[1:47:05] The atmosphere is right.
[1:47:10] The Holy Spirit is present. He's saying
[1:47:13] things to each one of us in a a personal
[1:47:18] way.
[1:47:19] And I ask you, what value is this man?
[1:47:25] What value is he?
[1:47:33] The Bible tells us, and I'll go quickly,
[1:47:35] Samuel was rejected.
[1:47:38] But when God spoke to Samuel, he said,
[1:47:40] "It's not you, it's me they rejected."
[1:47:44] God has always expressed himself
[1:47:47] in his chosen vessels, prophets, kings.
[1:47:51] David was spit on. Christ was spit on.
[1:47:54] He prophet said it was Christ and David.
[1:47:57] So David was spit on. David had dust
[1:48:00] cast on him. It was Christ. They cast
[1:48:03] dust on him. Tore his beard out.
[1:48:14] God always expressed himself
[1:48:18] in the people. The Apostle Paul said,
[1:48:22] "From henceforth, let no man trouble me.
[1:48:24] For I bear in my body the marks of the
[1:48:28] Lord Jesus." Not my marks, not the
[1:48:31] church's marks, the marks of the Lord
[1:48:33] Jesus. Those are his marks.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] Jesus expressing himself in his people.
[1:48:39] Now I come to a part
[1:48:42] that is most important to me. I said and
[1:48:44] I thank you for your very kind
[1:48:46] attention.
[1:48:51] Brother Brandham in life story and
[1:48:54] there's an there's a an entire
[1:48:58] piece big segment of brother Brandham's
[1:49:02] life and up to today perhaps you have
[1:49:05] thought it's part of his life story or
[1:49:07] this is part of his experience
[1:49:10] and it was but God
[1:49:14] didn't only allow God ordained that he
[1:49:17] would have that experience in order that
[1:49:20] he could be the vessel
[1:49:21] that he had to be for the people to whom
[1:49:24] he had to come and to the message he had
[1:49:27] to carry.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; God allowed his prophets he expressed
[1:49:31] himself
[1:49:33] in the prophets.
[1:49:39] Brother Brandham's life was shattered
[1:49:45] completely shattered
[1:49:49] when his young wife Hope
[1:49:51] passed away.
[1:49:55] And then within a few hours, his
[1:49:58] eight-month-old baby Sharon,
[1:50:02] he calls Sherry,
[1:50:05] and he prayed and he cried,
[1:50:08] "God, don't take her.
[1:50:12] Don't take her." And his prayer sound
[1:50:17] like it went nowhere.
[1:50:22] God knew what he was doing.
[1:50:25] But he was taking that young man and
[1:50:29] just crushing and tearing the soul as it
[1:50:32] were right out of him
[1:50:36] and he describes it
[1:50:40] after she died and said God wouldn't
[1:50:42] hear him and it was like the devil spoke
[1:50:44] to him said
[1:50:48] this God doesn't hear you
[1:50:52] says I went home.
[1:50:55] I stayed with mama that day and that
[1:50:58] night I was going around to the house
[1:51:02] and I picked up the mail. Doesn't it
[1:51:04] sound ordinary?
[1:51:06] It's about the same as Jesus going to
[1:51:08] supper at Simon the leper's house.
[1:51:12] It's very ordinary. I went to mama's
[1:51:14] house.
[1:51:16] His life is the world has come to a
[1:51:19] complete end.
[1:51:24] says, "As soon as I went there, the
[1:51:27] little old room there,
[1:51:30] little stove,
[1:51:34] little old cot.
[1:51:36] I stayed right there at the home. I
[1:51:40] didn't want to go nowhere else.
[1:51:43] There wasn't very much there.
[1:51:48] that little he says that old furniture
[1:51:52] but she and I live together with it.
[1:51:56] Now he's making a comparison.
[1:51:59] He's making an evaluation.
[1:52:01] The objects he's looking at
[1:52:05] are probably worth nothing.
[1:52:08] He's had to live in utter utter poverty.
[1:52:14] A little cot,
[1:52:16] little stove,
[1:52:18] little bit of old furniture.
[1:52:24] And he found a little envelope
[1:52:29] and on it was
[1:52:32] Sherry
[1:52:34] and in it was 85 cents
[1:52:37] that she had put away wanting to buy her
[1:52:40] something, I believe, for Christmas.
[1:52:43] And he saw those things said, "God, I
[1:52:46] can't live.
[1:52:48] I just can't live. I can't go on.
[1:52:53] There's nothing left. Let me go. Let me
[1:52:56] die."
[1:52:58] Is in that frame of mind.
[1:53:03] And he says, "But these things here,
[1:53:08] we live together with it and it was
[1:53:11] ours. People
[1:53:18] can think what they wish to think about
[1:53:20] this word about this Christ that I'm I'm
[1:53:22] not speaking about something that's
[1:53:24] beautified and we got fine things and
[1:53:26] all that. Forget that. There's all
[1:53:28] ashes.
[1:53:31] Everything that you brothers up in the
[1:53:34] video room and all the rest of it, just
[1:53:36] remember there's just bunch of ashes.
[1:53:39] What is this worth if we don't have a
[1:53:41] relationship? I'm talking about a
[1:53:43] relationship that's gripping, a
[1:53:46] relationship that's deep.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; And when he looked at these things,
[1:53:56] he gave the actual the heart and the
[1:53:59] essence of this message this morning.
[1:54:05] He said it was it was a whole lot. Now
[1:54:09] he said three things. He said three
[1:54:12] things. She and I lived here together
[1:54:15] with it.
[1:54:18] And it was ours. Number two.
[1:54:23] It was a whole lot.
[1:54:26] And he says this words. It ain't the
[1:54:29] value of anything.
[1:54:32] It's the way you look at it.
[1:54:38] Moses looked, he saw one thing. Pharaoh
[1:54:40] looked, he saw something else.
[1:54:43] Judas looked, he saw something worth 30
[1:54:45] pieces of silver.
[1:54:49] The safe prostitute looked and saw
[1:54:54] something worth her entire life.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, if she'd have had
[1:54:58] more ointment, she'd have poured it on
[1:55:00] him.
[1:55:02] She just was impelled, compelled to do
[1:55:05] this.
[1:55:09] And he says the angels came and had
[1:55:13] taken
[1:55:14] her away. Speaking of her little
[1:55:17] daughter,
[1:55:18] says he packed her down, put her in the
[1:55:20] arms of her mother.
[1:55:23] I went out there and I heard the
[1:55:25] undertaker say, "Ashes to ashes and dust
[1:55:29] to dust and earth to earth."
[1:55:32] And as the old clay clouds dropped upon
[1:55:36] the little casket, and the breeze came
[1:55:38] down through the trees, it seemed to
[1:55:41] say, "There's a land
[1:55:44] beyond the river
[1:55:47] that they call the sweet forever,
[1:55:51] and we only reach the shore by faith
[1:55:54] degree.
[1:55:57] One by one we'll gain the portal
[1:56:00] there to dwell with the immortal.
[1:56:05] Someday when they ring the golden bells
[1:56:10] for you and me.
[1:56:15] We're all going to be there
[1:56:17] one day.
[1:56:19] And everything that has seemed so
[1:56:21] important and so valuable.
[1:56:25] I just wonder if we'll have that moment
[1:56:28] of regret and that twinge. Why did I
[1:56:32] waste so much of my energy and my time
[1:56:36] to build something that is for not?
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; It took a crushing to bring these
[1:56:47] attributes out. Now listen close as I
[1:56:50] come to a close.
[1:56:53] I frankly believe that that was God
[1:56:59] because now there was another father
[1:57:04] and he had a place and he had prepared
[1:57:06] it
[1:57:09] and he put his son in it.
[1:57:12] Adam and Eve
[1:57:18] and death swept him.
[1:57:22] death crept in and tore them out of his
[1:57:25] bosom, tore them out of his fellowship,
[1:57:27] tore them out of his arms.
[1:57:30] There was no more fellowship. There was
[1:57:32] no more communion. It was gone. It was
[1:57:35] it was a a just a incredibly
[1:57:39] indescribable
[1:57:42] just a relentless
[1:57:44] effort of Satan and his his subility
[1:57:47] came to the utmost climax when he crept
[1:57:51] under the walls of Eden
[1:57:54] and seduced
[1:57:56] the bride.
[1:58:00] And we may be touched in our deepest of
[1:58:02] heart. But I wondered I wondered this
[1:58:05] week. Oh God, help me to convey this.
[1:58:09] The grief that Jesus experienced, he was
[1:58:12] experiencing because he was the son of
[1:58:14] God. He was he he was describing and
[1:58:17] expressing
[1:58:20] his father, God himself.
[1:58:23] He was expressing him.
[1:58:28] And God came down
[1:58:31] after death came in the cool of the day.
[1:58:38] This is the creator of heavens and
[1:58:40] earth.
[1:58:42] In his very apex, the greatest he could
[1:58:45] do is have a son.
[1:58:50] He looks around.
[1:58:53] Eden has become pretty empty.
[1:58:58] have no fellowship.
[1:59:01] We used to walk in the cool of the day.
[1:59:05] There's no communion.
[1:59:09] Can't even walk with my It's gone.
[1:59:11] Separated. A curtain has fallen. He's on
[1:59:14] the other side.
[1:59:16] A great chasm.
[1:59:19] Great chasm
[1:59:22] has happened.
[1:59:24] Here's a prophet in his little house.
[1:59:26] sees this little thing and that little
[1:59:28] thing.
[1:59:29] He said, "But it's what we had.
[1:59:32] It's all we had. We lived here. We had
[1:59:35] fellowship here. We communed here. But
[1:59:38] it's all taken away. It's torn from me."
[1:59:43] Here's God standing in.
[1:59:46] I think if brother Brandham had the
[1:59:49] power or you and I who have perhaps
[1:59:51] experienced similar things, we'd had the
[1:59:53] power to recreate it and change it.
[1:59:57] But God stood there. This is a He saw
[2:00:02] thorns coming.
[2:00:04] He saw the day that he saw an earth
[2:00:07] filled with violence. The Bible says he
[2:00:09] came down chapter six of chapter six of
[2:00:13] Genesis and the world is beauty
[2:00:15] conscious. They got a beauty cult going
[2:00:17] on and men and women take each other for
[2:00:20] husbands and wives and whatever more and
[2:00:23] the earth is filled with violence and we
[2:00:25] have it today. what we have today is
[2:00:27] what they had then and God saw that
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; fact is
[2:00:34] I just received a
[2:00:37] little article from the Temple Institute
[2:00:40] and right at the top
[2:00:43] right at the top it I'm so amazed
[2:00:48] Genesis 6 and6 says in our Bible and it
[2:00:51] repented the Lord that he had made man
[2:00:53] on the earth and it grieved him at his
[2:00:56] heart.
[2:00:58] And in the Hebrew it says, "God
[2:01:01] regretted that he had made man on the
[2:01:03] earth and he was pained. He was pained
[2:01:07] to his very core."
[2:01:11] Stay with me, folks.
[2:01:16] Brother Brandham couldn't fix it. He
[2:01:19] couldn't change it. But God stood there
[2:01:23] and beyond the cross and beyond the
[2:01:27] sinful world and beyond the Noah the
[2:01:30] days of Noah and beyond the violence and
[2:01:32] beyond the Sodom and Gomorrah and beyond
[2:01:35] Leodysia.
[2:01:37] He saw another day coming.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; He saw another day coming and he
[2:01:43] declared, "I'll make all things new."
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:50] This can't stay this way. I'll make a
[2:01:53] new I'll make a new heaven. I'll make a
[2:01:55] new earth. And there'll be no death.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; I'll take a right out of the midst of
[2:02:04] it. I'll show this enemy that I'm God.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; I'll take a people that'll defy death.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While they're living,
[2:02:13] they'll defy death. I'll change them in
[2:02:16] a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, and
[2:02:18] they'll defy death.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; And there's no wonder the heavens
[2:02:30] couldn't stay silent
[2:02:33] when Jesus walked up out of the water
[2:02:36] and a voice cried out, "This
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; is my son."
[2:02:43] The voice heaven could not remain silent
[2:02:46] on Mount Transfiguration.
[2:02:49] This is my beloved son.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[2:03:01] What do you think?
[2:03:04] And he said, "Father, glorify thyself
[2:03:08] with the glory that he had in the
[2:03:12] beginning." And a voice like a thunder
[2:03:15] roared out, "I have glorified it and I
[2:03:19] will glorify it again.
[2:03:24] Now listen.
[2:03:26] And now comes a prophet on this hand.
[2:03:30] And it's needful
[2:03:32] that he's crushed and everything is
[2:03:35] stripped away from him.
[2:03:39] What's precious is taken from him.
[2:03:43] And he goes and backs and he looks
[2:03:48] said, "God, I don't want to live
[2:03:49] anymore.
[2:03:52] I don't want to live anymore.
[2:03:55] But while he looked at those things, he
[2:03:56] said, "They were ours. We lived here."
[2:04:04] And it ain't
[2:04:07] how it ain't the value of it.
[2:04:12] It's how you look at it.
[2:04:15] Let me tell you friends, there's a lot
[2:04:18] of folks here, a lot of us,
[2:04:21] and what you're looking at, it ain't the
[2:04:24] value you think it is.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; And it ain't worth what you're giving
[2:04:29] it.
[2:04:33] You need to only use it
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; for the purpose of this one, this man,
[2:04:40] this man of Galilee,
[2:04:43] this one called Jesus Christ. And no
[2:04:46] wonder,
[2:04:49] oh God help me and God help you. No
[2:04:51] wonder that at this time here comes this
[2:04:55] little
[2:04:57] man
[2:04:59] exuding humility till people just see
[2:05:03] even see him
[2:05:06] believe it was Gordon Moore's wife her
[2:05:08] daughter just saw brother Brandham
[2:05:10] getting out of a little Model T car out
[2:05:12] on the road and she saw this little man
[2:05:15] step out of this old car and she said
[2:05:18] she had her hands I believe at the
[2:05:19] dishes in in the in the sink and she
[2:05:22] doesn't know why, but she said something
[2:05:24] just like a spirit come over and she
[2:05:26] just began to cry because she said the
[2:05:29] humility
[2:05:32] that marvelous.
[2:05:35] Isn't that marvelous?
[2:05:38] Oh, God.
[2:05:40] How I desire and yearn.
[2:05:45] People don't need to see us as
[2:05:47] successful,
[2:05:51] somebody who's accomplished,
[2:05:54] somebody who can make their way through
[2:05:55] this world and have the answers
[2:05:59] when people come into our presence. If
[2:06:01] they could sense a humility,
[2:06:04] they could sense a cleanness. They could
[2:06:07] sense an honesty and an integrity about
[2:06:10] us so that they would wonder and marvel.
[2:06:15] Who are you? What kind of person are you
[2:06:23] still coming? More important things just
[2:06:25] now.
[2:06:28] You can imagine the heart of God that he
[2:06:31] kept things in his mind. He kept
[2:06:34] secrets.
[2:06:36] He kept the plan. I'm not going to make
[2:06:39] it known. Satan and all the hordes of
[2:06:42] hell are not going to have this. I'm
[2:06:45] going to keep it a secret. I'm going to
[2:06:47] let the centuries go by. I'm going to
[2:06:50] let the world develop into some great
[2:06:53] exotic
[2:06:55] uh learned place and let them make a
[2:06:57] image to the brain and intellectual and
[2:07:01] cultural things and all the fineries.
[2:07:04] I'm going to let all of this happen. And
[2:07:06] then I'm going to bring bring along a
[2:07:09] uneducated person, a man who can't speak
[2:07:12] the queen's English, a man who hasn't
[2:07:15] been taught in the ways of religion and
[2:07:18] all. I let the world develop it. Let
[2:07:20] Satan develop his Eden. In the midst of
[2:07:22] that Eden, I'm going to bring my
[2:07:24] servant.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; And going to bring him to a time I'll
[2:07:30] crush him and make him the kind of
[2:07:32] servant that he must be. But then a time
[2:07:34] will come and he's going to open the
[2:07:37] seals. He's going to reveal the secrets
[2:07:40] that have been in my mind since before
[2:07:43] the foundation of the world. And the
[2:07:45] prophet comes in the first seal. And he
[2:07:47] he says, and Jesus said, "Glorify
[2:07:50] thyself. I have glorified it. I will
[2:07:53] glorify it again." He said, "And what
[2:07:55] about the time?" He refers to it as an
[2:07:57] affidavit. What about the time that this
[2:08:00] time? And he says this,
[2:08:03] He says, "Now the seal," and let's read
[2:08:05] a little bit. He said, "Oh, how I'd like
[2:08:08] to dwell on that for just a few minutes,
[2:08:10] and I hope that you people know these
[2:08:13] things. The first thing when the lamb
[2:08:15] broke, the lamb broke the first seal.
[2:08:17] Can you just imagine? I put the thing
[2:08:19] together from Genesis all the way to our
[2:08:22] time. God who lost it all. God who said,
[2:08:24] "I'm going to make it again." Now, he's
[2:08:26] right on the very brink of revealing the
[2:08:29] whole plan. what has been, what is, and
[2:08:33] what will be.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; And he says this, and are they're
[2:08:38] waiting for I he says, I hope all the
[2:08:40] people that know these things and are
[2:08:42] waiting for the consolation of the Lord.
[2:08:45] And he says, now study real close. He
[2:08:47] has when the lamb broke the first seal,
[2:08:49] a thunder roared. He said, and that's
[2:08:52] the significance. When the lamb broke a
[2:08:54] seal, the thunder roared. I understand
[2:08:57] that brother John Andy says, "You young
[2:09:00] people and you've been hearing the seals
[2:09:02] are just starting on the seals." And I
[2:09:04] sent him an email because I want you to
[2:09:07] I want to say to you this morning, all
[2:09:09] of you young people, even those of you
[2:09:10] that were not there, you need to be
[2:09:12] there on Friday nights and you need to
[2:09:14] read read this seal. Read the portion
[2:09:16] you're going to be studying. Read it
[2:09:18] over every day. Read it and become
[2:09:21] acquainted with it so you're not coming
[2:09:24] in as a stranger to it. Read it. These
[2:09:26] are things that God held in his mind.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From the foundation of the
[2:09:31] world.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; And then there came a voice
[2:09:36] and a thunder roared. That's a great
[2:09:39] significance. It's got a meaning. It's a
[2:09:42] meaning. He says, "Nothing happens
[2:09:44] without a meaning." Meaning a thunder.
[2:09:46] And he says, John the 12th chapter, the
[2:09:49] 23rd verse, he said, "Listen real close.
[2:09:53] Then you won't have to wonder no more
[2:09:55] what it is. And Jesus answering said,
[2:09:58] "The hour is come." Listen, before the
[2:10:01] voice spoke, Jesus is saying, "The hour
[2:10:04] has come." This man that I'm talking
[2:10:06] about is saying, "The hour has come."
[2:10:09] Now is the servant that's revealing that
[2:10:11] man, and he's saying, "The hour has
[2:10:13] come.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; The hour has come.
[2:10:24] that the Son of Man should be glorified.
[2:10:28] And he says, "See, you're at the end of
[2:10:30] an age. His ministry is ending."
[2:10:34] Referring to Christ at that time. And he
[2:10:38] says, "The hour has come that the Son of
[2:10:41] Man should be glorified." And he asks
[2:10:43] this question to those I'm asking it to
[2:10:47] you.
[2:10:48] What about the hour has come when his
[2:10:52] bride
[2:10:53] must be taken away?
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; What about that hour,
[2:11:01] folks?
[2:11:03] God has waited a long time for that hour
[2:11:08] when the bride
[2:11:11] must be taken away. A people,
[2:11:17] a people who have heard
[2:11:19] his voice,
[2:11:22] a people who have received a confir
[2:11:25] confirmation.
[2:11:27] Is there something in your heart today
[2:11:30] that says this is it
[2:11:32] and this is him? This is him.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Do you have that in your heart?
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; This is my bridegroom.
[2:11:45] Just remember friends, however long we
[2:11:48] live, let's not try to polish him up. He
[2:11:53] will always be rejected.
[2:11:55] He will always be a man of sorrows and
[2:11:58] acquainted with grief.
[2:12:02] This will always be him. He's been that
[2:12:04] from the beginning.
[2:12:08] But the hour is come
[2:12:11] that the Son of Man shall be glorified.
[2:12:14] And the hour has come, he says, "What
[2:12:16] about the hour
[2:12:19] has come
[2:12:21] that time shall be no more? And the
[2:12:24] angel is ready to set one foot on the
[2:12:27] land and the other on the sea and a
[2:12:30] rainbow over his head."
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; What about that hour? He's asking, "What
[2:12:34] about that hour?" Amen.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; And here you are.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Here we are
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; in that hour.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; We're in that hour.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to go home today
[2:12:57] and think real real deep and real hard.
[2:12:59] And I pray that the Holy Spirit will
[2:13:01] almost like be hauntingly on your
[2:13:04] footsteps
[2:13:08] and that you'll be conscious
[2:13:10] throughout your life.
[2:13:13] What value am I placing on this? And how
[2:13:17] have we valued him?
[2:13:22] This lovely one.
[2:13:26] this message did not come to us very
[2:13:28] easy and it didn't come to us cheap.
[2:13:35] And brother Brandham, he said, uh,
[2:13:39] if you only knew,
[2:13:44] brother, sister, I'm closing.
[2:13:49] You look down there and say, "Oh, this
[2:13:51] is easy.
[2:13:53] These hear things." He said, "You don't
[2:13:56] know what's behind the life." See, he
[2:13:59] goes all the way back. You don't know.
[2:14:02] They saw it in the glamour. They saw it
[2:14:03] in the power. They saw the
[2:14:05] demonstration.
[2:14:08] But he said, "You don't know
[2:14:11] what's behind the life." And he said,
[2:14:14] "This old heart's been broke and tore
[2:14:20] to pieces until God gets out." But
[2:14:24] someday it'll be over. So you're still
[2:14:28] standing there saying, "You don't know
[2:14:30] what's behind it." And we don't.
[2:14:35] I don't expect that we will sit here
[2:14:37] this morning. But I preached this
[2:14:38] service so that you
[2:14:42] may have not just a mere more
[2:14:44] information, more knowledge, but a
[2:14:47] deeper
[2:14:49] experience.
[2:14:51] Say we can say father
[2:14:58] this what I'm enjoying today
[2:15:02] has been very costly
[2:15:06] very costly
[2:15:09] and I so appreciate it.
[2:15:12] No wonder God and perhaps you have not
[2:15:16] seen it or perhaps you've not even maybe
[2:15:18] it's never passed through your mind but
[2:15:20] listen to me friend as a servant of
[2:15:22] Christ.
[2:15:23] God almighty God the one that walked in
[2:15:26] Eden whose heart was broken.
[2:15:31] He looked at what he made. All the
[2:15:34] glorious things and the cre and the
[2:15:36] creatures,
[2:15:38] millions of them extinct, but they
[2:15:40] weren't then. And he looked on it.
[2:15:44] It was empty.
[2:15:47] Wasn't very meaningful.
[2:15:49] But what he's seeing as you're sitting
[2:15:51] here today, what he's seeing is the
[2:15:54] power, the word. the word.
[2:15:58] This is the most glorious thing because
[2:16:00] what he's doing, he's making the very
[2:16:03] thing that was the very heart in the
[2:16:06] core that pained him.
[2:16:10] The very heart of it that was ripped
[2:16:12] away. He's seeing it coming back
[2:16:14] together again. And it was tore from him
[2:16:17] by a perverted word. And now I've sent a
[2:16:20] pure word. I'm opening up the secret.
[2:16:22] I'm opening up the mysteries. I have a
[2:16:24] vessel that I crushed
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; to make him ready, to make him the kind
[2:16:30] of vessel that would stay true.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Even when he was enticed by the
[2:16:35] multitudes and the wealth and the
[2:16:37] glamour and the honor and all of it, he
[2:16:40] disdained it and remained true.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Because you must speak to a people
[2:16:48] I've given everything for
[2:16:51] and they will treasure me.
[2:16:54] They will love me. They will honor me.
[2:16:58] And we I will take them in my embrace
[2:17:01] and be united with them.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; If you haven't experienced that,
[2:17:08] I pray that today
[2:17:11] in this moment
[2:17:13] that you will
[2:17:15] say, "My heart is open. Lord,
[2:17:18] take and pregnant me with your word.
[2:17:22] do something special. Bring me into that
[2:17:24] relationship. I sense it. I feel it. I'm
[2:17:28] being pulled. I'm being drawn.
[2:17:31] If you will, if you'll give over and if
[2:17:34] you'll yield,
[2:17:38] I feel ordained to tell you you can
[2:17:40] enter into a life that you have not
[2:17:44] experienced hitherto to this time.
[2:17:48] Let us pray.
[2:17:53] Father, I'm speaking about you and I'm
[2:17:56] speaking to you.
[2:18:01] This audience of people, Lord,
[2:18:04] who we have walked together,
[2:18:07] some for a shorter period of time and
[2:18:09] others for a very long time.
[2:18:13] And Lord, there I know that deep down in
[2:18:15] the recesses of the hearts
[2:18:19] of these people
[2:18:22] is a a a throbb,
[2:18:25] a desire. Satan would like to cover it
[2:18:27] over. He would like to he would like to
[2:18:30] contaminate it if he could. He would
[2:18:31] like to dilute it. He would like to
[2:18:34] encumber it if he could. But oh God, I
[2:18:38] pray that that desire that you put there
[2:18:40] for yourself, for your own glory, for
[2:18:44] your own joy, for your own pleasure, let
[2:18:46] it rise. Let it rise above all the rest
[2:18:50] of the turmoil and the den and the noise
[2:18:52] and the dust and the clamor of the
[2:18:54] world. Let it rise. Let it rise. Let it
[2:18:57] rise.
[2:18:58] Lord, take the words that I've attempted
[2:19:01] to speak this morning. Take the frailty.
[2:19:04] Take the weakness of it. Take the
[2:19:06] simplicity of it and just bring it. I
[2:19:09] feel Lord, I've said all that I could
[2:19:11] say. How you touched my own heart.
[2:19:16] How I was sensing and feeling
[2:19:19] some of the same shifting and moving of
[2:19:22] emotions as it were, the waters of the
[2:19:26] sea and the ocean washing over my own
[2:19:28] soul.
[2:19:30] And oh God,
[2:19:32] I I would desire that not only for
[2:19:35] myself but for all that are here and all
[2:19:39] that are listening and all that are
[2:19:42] viewing
[2:19:43] that they will be
[2:19:46] so drawn and so powerfully moved that
[2:19:49] they will simply say yes Lord. Yes,
[2:19:54] Lord. Yes. I I don't know how to do it
[2:19:56] and I cannot on my own strength do
[2:19:59] anything but I just give myself to you
[2:20:02] in a yielding in a yielding and in a
[2:20:04] surrender.
[2:20:05] Come Lord Jesus be in attendance here
[2:20:09] now because I'm I am convinced that
[2:20:11] you're here. Others are convinced
[2:20:16] there are those that are very needy
[2:20:17] here. I pray, oh God, you make yourself
[2:20:20] known and real to them
[2:20:23] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:26] The name of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:33] Could we just sing? Come by here, my
[2:20:36] Lord.
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:55] Invite him, will you? Will you invite
[2:20:57] him? Don't let anything hinder you. Come
[2:21:00] by here.
[2:21:02] [Music]
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Sister Katie, Sister Katie, would you
[2:21:12] come, please?
[2:21:13] Come by here.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Come by here.
[2:21:22] [Music]
[2:21:29] Come by.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Someone's praying.

[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; 783. These are the words that brother
[2:25:23] Brandham said he just heard as the wind
[2:25:27] was coming through. This is what he
[2:25:29] heard.
[2:25:31] I think it would be fine, wonderful,
[2:25:33] appropriate
[2:25:36] for us to sing it. When they ring the
[2:25:38] golden bells
[2:25:41] for you and me. Oh, when we hear the
[2:25:45] angels singing, will we hear them? Will
[2:25:47] you hear them?
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Are you happy about it?
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; Is it a reality?
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; There's a land
[2:26:03] river
[2:26:05] that they call
[2:26:08] forever
[2:26:11] and we only reach
[2:26:16] by faith.
[2:26:19] [Music]
[2:26:20] And everyone let the words speak to you
[2:26:23] now.
[2:26:24] We'll gain the mortals
[2:26:28] there to dwell with the immortals
[2:26:35] when they ring the golden
[2:26:38] bells for you and me.
[2:26:43] Oh,
[2:26:45] don't you hear the bells bow ringing?
[2:26:52] You hear the angels singing
[2:26:58] his gloral
[2:27:00] [Applause]
[2:27:01] [Music]
[2:27:03] to the
[2:27:05] [Music]
[2:27:09] far
[2:27:11] [Music]
[2:27:15] beyond the shiny river
[2:27:20] when they Ring the golden bells for you
[2:27:26] and me.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Like to have the last verse, please. The
[2:27:30] third verse.
[2:27:32] When our shall go their number
[2:27:38] when
[2:27:40] we sleep.
[2:27:44] When the king commands the spirit to be
[2:27:50] free.

[2:28:11] for you and me.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you hear the bells
[2:28:21] ringing?
[2:28:23] You hear the angels singing
[2:28:29] is the gloral
[2:28:33] to
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:43] forever
[2:28:46] just beyond the shin
[2:28:49] river.
[2:28:52] And they ring the
[2:28:55] bells for you and
[2:29:03] I thought it was so appropriate
[2:29:06] that uh Rabbi Richmond and the Temple
[2:29:09] Institute
[2:29:11] this is the they don't just select at
[2:29:14] random uh scripture
[2:29:17] but they have a a a scripture that they
[2:29:21] follow at certain times in the year. And
[2:29:25] this scripture of God's heart being
[2:29:27] pained comes just after they've had
[2:29:30] suka, which is the remembrance
[2:29:35] that they're transient here.
[2:29:39] This is not your home. You remember that
[2:29:42] you're transient. And you'll make a
[2:29:44] booth for seven days. And you'll stay in
[2:29:47] the booth seven days. But after that,
[2:29:50] and this is the next scripture, cuz God
[2:29:52] was pained to the core, but that's not
[2:29:55] where it ended. He said, "I'll make all
[2:29:57] things new."
[2:30:00] [Music]
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; I trust we can truly appreciate and put
[2:30:07] the right kind of value on the fact that
[2:30:09] God called you.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; God brought you into this.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; God allowed you to hear this. Could we
[2:30:17] not say thank God?
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; I put great value upon this.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; My prayers may God touch your hearts
[2:30:29] very very deeply.
[2:30:32] We'll pray.
[2:30:36] Our dear Lord Jesus, what a lovely
[2:30:40] atmosphere.
[2:30:44] What a lovely group of people.
[2:30:47] What a marvelous, marvelous
[2:30:50] message and word that you have sent us.
[2:30:55] We see you in it, Lord.
[2:30:59] We see you rejected. We see you
[2:31:01] esteemed, smitten. We hear all kinds of
[2:31:04] things, but it only makes us love you
[2:31:07] more.
[2:31:10] We say, "You're altogether lovely.
[2:31:13] You're the fairest of 10,000
[2:31:16] to my soul. Oh Jesus. Jesus. Living
[2:31:21] word, living Christ.
[2:31:24] I pray that you will pass through the
[2:31:28] barriers. Oh God, pass through the
[2:31:30] barriers of this material world and
[2:31:34] touch the souls of the people when they
[2:31:37] go to their home or where they go to
[2:31:39] have some refreshment. Touch them so
[2:31:42] deeply, oh God. Even in the midst of a
[2:31:44] crowd, in the midst of their family,
[2:31:48] may they feel separated to you and alone
[2:31:51] with you and in fellowship and communion
[2:31:54] with you.
[2:31:57] Let the effects of this service
[2:32:00] be longlasting.
[2:32:02] May it be eternal in the lives of those
[2:32:05] that you've ordained.
[2:32:07] People have driven long ways, Lord.
[2:32:10] Pray that you'll bless them for their
[2:32:12] efforts.
[2:32:14] Bless those that got up very early and
[2:32:16] those that are staying late
[2:32:18] to hear and be and to participate.
[2:32:21] Bless them in the home, I pray, where
[2:32:23] they are, wherever it might be at this
[2:32:25] time. And now, oh God of Abraham, God of
[2:32:30] Isaac, God of Jacob, God of the
[2:32:32] prophets, and God of the messengers,
[2:32:35] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:32:38] receive these humble words. Lord,
[2:32:41] forgive us our sins. Forgive us our
[2:32:45] failings and our mistakes and
[2:32:48] iniquities.
[2:32:50] And may the precious blood of your lamb,
[2:32:53] God's lamb, cleanse us every wit that we
[2:32:56] want to be pure and holy before you.
[2:33:02] And give us a sense of value that the
[2:33:04] world can never give us.
[2:33:08] That we might love each other as we
[2:33:10] ought to. that we might see Christ
[2:33:14] in bride form
[2:33:16] in the name of Jesus Christ. Ask you to
[2:33:20] bless the afternoon now and the service
[2:33:22] this evening
[2:33:24] for your glory, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[2:33:27] Amen.
[2:33:29] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[2:33:33] Oh,
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; how
[2:33:42] [Music]
[2:33:47] I love Jesus.
[2:33:51] [Music]
[2:33:56] How I love Jesus.
[2:34:02] [Music]
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We dismiss you in that lovely
[2:34:14] name. Go and have some rest and
[2:34:18] refreshment
[2:34:19] here this evening. And as you leave, I'd
[2:34:23] ask that no one speak in the foyer and
[2:34:28] you just mind the Lord. Do whatever he
[2:34:30] tells you to do. I dismiss you in the
[2:34:32] name of Jesus Christ. You're free to go.
[2:34:35] Greet one another. God bless you.
