For unto thee shall I praise my voice shall I hear [Music] will I direct my prayer unto thee will I stand and sing these First David here to my word. Oh s my [Music] hearken unto the voice of my cry. [Music] My king is my God. For unto me will I pray. My voice shall thou hear in the morning. Morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will and those are the words of David prophet and the king. He also said in Psalm 5, the same chapter, but as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. Later on, verse 11, he says, "But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice." Can you rejoice this morning? Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them, let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. For thou, Lord, will bless the righteous with favor. Wil thou compass them as with a shield. Amen. Praise God. When I wake up in the morning and think of the great things you've done for me. Amen. I feel like praising him. Let's sing it this morning. M when I wake up in the morning great things God has done for me in my heart there's such rejoicing today has gone on me all the glorious mysteries in God's word that he has allowed me to share. It's only an indication of his great love and how much he cares. I feel like praiseing him. Praise I feel like praise praise [Music] like to Abraham he came down in this day unto me. Showing me the things that were and things that are things that are to be. What has been hidden from the eyes of the wise and the brass to his own?

Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Brother Tony to come and open the service in a word of prayer this morning. We've got uh couple of testimonies. Brother Gordon said, "I had a small stroke on Thursday night. 18 hours later, I was walking, talking, and witnessing my healing. the power of prayer by all the saints and God's grace is here today. Amen. Thankful for that. Brother uh Emanuel Gindo says, "A year ago, my wife was involved in a car accident and IBC said it was 100% my wife's fault. We took them to court and without a lawyer and a witness, the judge changed the decision, said that my wife was not guilty. Thanks and praise to the mighty lawyer and judge Jesus Christ." Amen. Amen. Our sister uh Roxan Hoffman. Um got a note here from our brother Nelson Guy. Would like to thank you for your prayers for his grandson Jeffrey. He had surgery on Saturday night for a cyst that was pressing on his spine. He is doing well and learning to walk again with a walker. However, he still needs prayer for salvation. So, let's remember him this morning. Amen. And if you have a request that you want taken before the Lord this morning, you lift it before him as we go to prayer. If you're listening in, you do the same thing. Just We've got a God who hears, knows our our requests even before we ask. Let's remember brother Tom as well. He's down in Phoenix this morning with the saints there. Amen. Tony if you come. We also got word from China that those uh believers that were uh arrested, they are serving time right now. They're doing hard labor and uh the testimony that came back because there could be a way to maybe pay the fine or whatever. And they says we're we're prepared to leave this in the hands of Almighty God. I think that's very admirable, very honorable. And so we want to remember these brothers in prayer and also we got word from Iran that uh one of the believers there in one of the cities we visited. I don't think he was in the meetings we were in but nevertheless uh they were also picked up by the police as well. So these are trying times. Amen. Let's join our hearts together in prayer. Lord Jesus truly we have come into your presence this morning with great expectation. Lord we want to see you high and lifted up in our midst. This is our confession, Father, that you have triumphed gloriously over every evil spirit. You are the one, Lord, that descended down into hell. Oh God, you kicked the doors off of hell itself when you took the keys away from, Lord, the tormentor, the accuser of the brethren, the one who has inadvertently taken that which was not his, a dominion that you provided to Adam. And oh God, as you descended into the realms of the lost, Lord, you proved your great power. And Lord, you rose triumphant. And you, Lord, have given to us great and exceeding wonderful gifts, Lord. That whereby we can be overcomers this morning, whereby we can worship you, whereby we can honor you with the fruit of our lips, and we can praise you and bring a a sacrifice, a living sacrifice, that you may be pleased with our lives and our testimony and our confession. How thankful we are for healing our brother Gordon. Lord, Lord, how thankful we are for the other testimonies of how you've been merciful to Nelson Guy grandson or nephew, whatever he is. Lord, we we pray for his soul, Father, that you would move upon this young man, this grandson. And Lord, save his soul, Father. Lord Jesus, we hold up these other needs before you as well in China, our precious brothers that are standing firm for the testimony of your word. Father, comfort them and strengthen them and deliver them. Father, you are our great judge, our great advocate as you delivered us to Gindo. Lord, deliver these brothers out of the mouth of the lion. We pray, Lord, for our precious believers in in Iran and other places, Lord, that are under oppression. Father, we hold them up before you, Lord. We remember brother Tom and the services that he is in this weekend. We remember brother Ernie as he is in the Philippines. We pray for Brother Dier in the services this afternoon in Tacoma. Lord, may you pour out a blessing upon these saints. And Lord Jesus, as we are here now and Lord, everyone that is here in this building and by way of extended audience through the internet and telephones, Lord, we are a needy people today. We come to the house of God, a house of deliverance with great expectation. Feed our souls, Lord Jesus. Move in our midst, Lord. We need a fresh and filling father. We need the corrective word of God. We need the demonstration of your power. Lord, may you move through our pastor as our desire. And Lord, may you convict the backslider. May you, Lord Jesus, restore the joy of salvation. Lord, may you deliver those that are bound and oppressed. Meet every need in divine glory is our prayer and desire as we ask all these mercies in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And you may be seated. I want to welcome all those who are visiting with with us. We're happy to have each and every one of you here this morning and trust you'll enjoy the presence of God this morning. Um our brother David Nash I understand is here visiting with us and maybe brother David understand has a song he's going to bless us with. So maybe brother David you can come and as uh he's coming why don't we sing together that song we learned last Sunday we bow our hearts give us clean hands you bend our knees oh spirit help make us humble [Music] we bow our hearts we bend our knees Oh spirit come make us humble. [Music] We turn our eyes from evil things. Oh Lord we cast down our idols to give us clean hands. Give us your heart Lord. Let us not lift our souls to another. Give us clean hands, Lord. Give us pure hearts. Let us not lift our souls to another. Oh God, let us be a generation that sees see your face. Oh God of change. God let us be a generation that see your face. Oh God Jesus. [Music] [Music] Wandering out in the dark of night, I could not find my way. [Music] &gt;&gt; I was lost and torn apart. Alone and so araid. Tears became my company. My friends had all withdrawn. Words of prayer just seemed to fall. I found no comfort there. &gt;&gt; There a lot of voice of prayer lifted me somewhere where I've seen his glory in the holy of holies. I've seen him face to face. There I found my rapture by his word and captured. I am hardened by his grace. Standing in the presence of the King of Kings. Standing in his presence. I am living in his presence. Standing in his presence, I am changed. [Music] Now I walk much differently. A child of God. I'm found. His word revealed inside of me. It's Christ my Lord come down. Priest, the judge, the coner, the mighty God is he. His glory reigns in majesty. Christ Jesus is the king. Lifted by his presence near into eternity where I've seen his glory in the holy of holies. I've seen him face to face where I found my rapture by his word and captured. I am pardoned by his grace. Standing in the presence of the King of Kings. Standing in his presence. I am living in his presence. Standing in his presence. I am changed. [Music] [Music] And we've got a baby dedication this morning. Brother Peta and Sister Sheila are going to bring their little one. And uh as I do and as brother Episcopal comes, let's sing together. When he cometh, when he cometh to make up his jewels, number 2484 in the on the screen. When he cometh, when he cometh to make up his jewels, all his jewels, precious jewels, his love and his own. Like the stars of the morning, his bright crown adorning, they shall shine in their beauty. his love for his crown. The last verse, little children, little children who love their redeemer are the jewels, precious jewels, his love and his own. Like the stars of the morning, his bright crowns adorning, they shall shine in their beauty bright. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, it's uh always our pleasure to dedicate another one of our children. to think that they're born into this kind of a home where they're going to hear the name of Jesus Christ. And I wanted to just share a few thoughts with our brother Peter and sister Sheila from the scriptures. It's always very different and I I wonder why it's different, but I guess God knows why it's different. But right in the middle of this my scripture reading yesterday, I came on a scripture that I felt was so suited to this occasion. Our brother Peter and sister Sheila have called their son, third son, Wesley, second name, and Gabriel his first name. Gabriel, man of God. He's almost 11 months old. He's a big boy. And uh there may be relatives on the in the central part of Canada that are streaming and we certainly uh welcome them to this dedication. There's a scripture uh Moses speaking to the people. He said, "Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man, upon his son and upon his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day." And then I thought of how uh that is connected to the service today. Brother Peter as a father, Sister Sheila, as a mother. Jacob laid his hands upon his sons and upon Joseph's sons. There is a significance when the father in his place of responsibility takes and identifies that responsibility in that headship and lays his hand upon his son. I'm going to pray for dedication for Gabriel Wesley in a few moments, but I'm ask Peter to join me and lay his hand upon him as a father. And I think it's a good thing not just on this occasion but through life. And then the scripture tells us that Moses laid his hands on Joshua to identify and to pass uh from him to Joshua. Not just a blessing but a commandment and a charge. He said he gave him a charge. And I believe that Joshua didn't realize what the full responsibility that charge is. And even as we lay our hands on our children, they don't realize what it really will mean on in life. But God knows. And uh even Jacob, I thought of Jacob when he laid his hands and he he uh crossed his hands and uh and Joseph said, "No, no, no. It's a it's a wrong one." But it was the right way. That's that. And those boys didn't know what was happening. They didn't know at all what was happening. Joseph didn't understand it. But God knew when a father reaches out his hand, lays his hand on his son and then Jesus when I brought the children to have them dedicated, not dedicated but to bless them. The Bible says he touched them. I don't have to hold this child but I often do but it's the main thing is to to touch them to identify what is happening. And then I want to say sister Sheila, brother Brandham said in the message inner man, he said, "How many of you mothers?" He said, "What mother doesn't know what laying on of hands means when a little baby's ftting and crying and everything and let the mother's hand just touch that baby. That settles it." The little fellow stops crying and huddles up to his mother. It's laying your hand. It's mother. It's a contact. And in the message leadership, he said the mother, she was the first one that received the child and and and had contact with it. And then she handed it to the school teacher. Then the school teacher handed back to the father and the father taught him business. And then the father handed them to the rabbi. And the rabbi taught him spiritual things. And he said, "Then now, who's leading you?" And I'm going to say to brother Peter and sister Sheila, "We're going to have this dedication, but don't stop laying your hand on him. Keep your hand upon this son. And even if he should get to be and the Lord Jesus should tar and he should get to be a young teenager and even end up going his own way and you see him going in a direction that you feel sad and you're broken about. Keep your hand on him. Keep your hand on him. Keep your spiritual influence on him and give him some footsteps to follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gabriel, come to me my boy. Gabriel Wesley. Amen. We'll pray. Our loving heavenly father, how we thank you for this jewel that you have given into the home of our brother Peter and sister Sheila. Lord, their third son Gabriel. Lord Jesus, I put my hand upon him and I ask now that brother Peter, his father, will lay his hand on him. And I pray, Father, that the heart and desire of this father will pass onto this son. His desire for God, his desire, Lord, for eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I pray this desire will never leave this son. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I dedicate him to you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The God that gave him into this home. Father, I pray that you will now receive him into your everlasting arms and that he shall know what the name of Jesus means. He shall know what Calvary means. He shall know what the message means. He shall know, oh God, what you have done in this generation. Thank you. I dedicate him in the name of Jesus Christ. Gabriel Wesley. Amen. God bless you, sister Sheila. God bless you, brother Peter. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Well, Brother Rod sang my chorus. We lift him up to the highest place. Amen. I just so love that love that chorus. We place him in the highest place. We want to do that this morning. And perhaps we will sing a chorus or two before we're done. Was there anything else, brother Rod? You had. All right. Uh, I understand I heard you praying for the believers in China and uh not a whole lot has been said. We're not going to say a whole lot. There's five of them that have been arrested. They've been in uh they were reported by uh the local uh three self church members of the church. We understand it was reported that they had attended some meetings where a foreigner was speaking. I believe it was brother Chris Hall was having meetings and they had traveled to another city and were attending the meetings and then when they got home they witnessed about the message and what God was doing and uh now some of you young people in school you think you suffer some things and we as individuals mothers and fathers families and so they began to witness and it was uh re reported that they had attended a meeting where foreigners were speaking. Uh the police came to them and then the police handed them over to the national security and uh they were arrested and from there they were put into hard labor. So that's where they are today. uh they heard that it might be possible one of the wives of the one of the brothers is not a believer and uh she understands that she could get her husband out for quite a large sum of money. uh the the the other people are aware of it also uh that it might be possible but they said no they refused deliverance because they said you know we have been placed here for the name of Jesus Christ for the gospel of Jesus Christ and we're not prepared to accept deliverance if God wants us out he can get us out but we're staying here and uh uh I thought of that they could possibly be freed. It's not sure, but they could possibly be freed, but they've refused that. And the other reason they refused it is because if they pay once, then they authorities realize all we have to do is arrest them and we get big sums of money. So, they are not going to bend to that. I praise God. You know, they haven't had they haven't had years and years and years in the message, &gt;&gt; but already it's a reality to them. &gt;&gt; They have such a a sense of balance. Nice to see you, brother John Sacker. I see you acknowledging brother John. God bless you. Just good to see your face, Sister Esther. My God bless you. Nice to have you. And I know that's real close to your heart. I was thinking just in the last uh few days, last week or two, I thought about brother John Sacker, brother John Lei and how they initially went over and handed books and took them in pack sacks and stood outside of the three self church and handed the books as the people came out and and uh brother John, you brothers are have a reward for everything that's happening there. You're just part of it. That's all there is to it. That's what we believe. Amen. I just got in the last hour before coming to church just received an email and I'm going to take a few minutes before we turn to the word. So I hope you don't mind. Shalom our dearest brother and pastor in Christ. We have influx of brethren from the Ivory Coast. How many been hearing about the Ivory Coast? There's a terrible, terrible conflict there. People are being killed, being slaughtered. They're ready. United Nations are trying to do something. They're trying to send maybe some help in there. And uh they're fleeing from the Ivory Coast. These are some believers that are fleeing from the Ivory Coast from the crisis. And they are here with us in Liberia, but stranded. no food and even safe drinking water. Brother Biscoll, we plead to you. They are dying slowly and want you assist with funds to buy food and give some of them proper medication. God bless you. Shalom, Pastor Enoch David. Now, when we receive a a desperate uh thing like this, uh we don't just jump and respond instantly. We want to confirm what is uh really what the situation is. Sometimes that takes uh uh a little while. It takes some phoning. It takes some call. And uh I I just want to say a word about men of vision in this regard. Now, we're sitting here in in comfort today, and we're sitting here. We're going to leave here. We're going to go and eat our our dinner or lunch, whatever. We're going to fellowship. We're going to be comfortable. We're going We have what we have need of most of us. And if you don't, it is available, I'm sure. Uh but now here's some people. Uh there are believers in China. They're in hard labor. And also in the email, they said it's snowing. They're it's cold. Uh all we can do is pray for them. That we have a responsibility to do. But there's others and we can do one of two things. We can just sit up our you know close up our bowels of compassion or we can come forward and say what can we do? That was the concept behind men of vision and uh we had people just who are probably streaming right now from Switzerland and they sent two emails. They just wanted to do something for the saints in Granada. The thing is as a in the ministry, we don't have the time to follow up all of these things here. Here's a a real live need. And my heart starts to be wrenched, but I don't have I might make a phone call and say, "This is a solid brother. This is a real devoted pastor." But that's as far as I can go as far as, you know, doing all the logistics and maybe seeing how and is there a possibility and maybe we can Hey, we've sent brethren, we've had them fly over to different countries to do things just to uh set things up or to deliver uh some help or some aid. So, that's not the impossible. But what we need is men. We need devoted men. And I really feel, you know, I know that brother Rod as busy as he is, brother Ken, brother Randy Snow, these three brothers, there have been others who said, you know, what can I do? But it's not a matter of just sitting back and saying, what can I do? It's a matter of saying, I am here. I'm ready. Put me to work. What do you want me to do? Is there something that I can do? Uh, it's one thing to take up. I'm not going to take up an offering, but one thing we could take up an offering and, you know, put $20 in the plate or whatever more and then it's just out of our minds. that is isn't really what we need. It isn't what we need just that, but it is to have people that are burdened. And that is quite frankly, and I haven't told the church, but in about 3 weeks, I'm going to Ghana because there's been such uh a demand and such a pressure, a spiritual pressure to to be there. There's going to be there's going to be people from six nations. And one of the nations which was just speaking on behalf where they've had some meetings on this crisis is in Burkina Faso. In fact is brother Brett and sister Anne's son and daughter-in-law were there as missionaries for some time. So she got quite sick and had to come back. But that is where the meeting was just taking place I believe yesterday on account of this crisis. And Ghana is right next door as well right in the same region. They said there will be people from from the Ivory Coast and brethren are going to be there from the Ivory Coast. So I will be with some brothers that will know a whole lot about this probably in the next 3 weeks on the 20th. I'll leave on the 20th. The meetings are for four or five days uh right over Christmas. And I thought, well, another Christmas. I'm without the family. And uh who knows at my age it could be the last Christmas. But it's it's I'm driven with a passion and a concern for the body of Christ. And I think that that's what that's what everyone needs to be in their own place, in their own area, in their own realm. And and uh you know, it's it's not easy to do good because when you do good, evil's present. &gt;&gt; See, the devil's always there to stop, to throw up a roadblock or do something one way or another. But don't ever lose your desire. You know, if you can't do anything else, if uh you sisters, you say, "Well, men of vision, what can the sisters do?" And I tell you what, there have been women of God down through the scripture that went on their knees and prevailed upon God and accomplished great things for the kingdom of God. Can this congregation believe that? Can you say amen to that? And so we don't want to become you know just uh a information receiving station where we just hear things and you know that are happening elsewhere in the world. But I want that this congregation to be uh just involved. I want them to be uh uh a part of what is taking place and so that you feel that and you you know that you're a part of it. You're a part of it in prayer. You're a part of it in giving. You're a part of it in going. You're a part in in doing something whether it be as as you know as mundane as licking a stamp or doing assisting some way or another. And I just thought I told brother Rod I said I just want to give a a men of vision a punch because I really believe even though it's quiet even though Satan has fought that real real hard and you know I say this to I think our shame I don't say our shame here as a church but even as a movement amongst believers some of the hardest and most skeptical people to move as preachers. They're afraid they're going to lose something. They're afraid they're going to lose some able man or lose some offering or lose some nothing. We don't ask for any of that. I But I I really feel that when there's men within a congregation and you know, you you save up and maybe take a vacation someplace. Well, quite frankly, you know, I've taken just about all my grandsons, not for a trip. I took them to the Philippines. I took them to Africa. Brother Tom took one son to to Poland and let them see uh Warsaw and let them see uh where they where the Jews were were slaughtered by the millions and let you know let them become a part of the of of the work. We've taken brothers and brother Michelle to Congo and the other brothers to Congo and brother Isaac Nash to the Congo. I don't think they'll ever ever forget that. And some of the sisters have gone. They wanted to just go and observe. it'll be a part of their life forever. And I I think now it's uh anyone who has ever gone and said, "I want to do something. I want to be of help." I don't think they've ever regretted that. Not everybody can go. That's granted. But I think that we can all be a part of it. One way or another can be a part of it. So you take that for whatever. When you live for others, &gt;&gt; you're looking heaven in the face. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you still believe that? &gt;&gt; And you can live for others right here. There's needs all around us. People are needy. You find h how can I do it? Well, you might find somebody who's kind of going loose and kind of going astray. Don't don't just stand back. Just, you know, pitch in there and do what you can. Encourage them and go and see them and invite them over and put them in another atmosphere. Say they're getting in the wrong atmosphere. will create the right one for them. Have them over you. You're you're you can be at mission right here, right here. And we need it. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we need missionaries &gt;&gt; right here. &gt;&gt; Right in this countrymen. &gt;&gt; You don't believe me. This is probably the most critical place you can find. North America, land of plenty and land of ease and land of all the rest of it. We're more in danger of backsliding than anybody. We're the ones who really want to keep our our our spiritual senses sharpened. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to preach before I'm supposed to. All you young people, I want you to listen. Well, Sister Magda, I was just going to mention your name. Sister Magda, who's just standing there at the back. She uh she has been in contact with a a girl and they've been on uh internet and speaking back and forth. This girl I think is 13 or 14 14 years old and she just come in contact with the gospel through sister Magda in the church here. I think they have streamed a meeting or two. She has been streaming some meeting somehow. Her mother just died. They thought her father was going to die first from a brain tumor. Her father has survived. He's still living, but they have no place to live. The doctor, the doctor at the hospital actually took them into his own home, and they're staying at the doctor's house right now. She was at school. The school she's at is largely Muslim. At least she has mostly Muslim in her class as I understand it. And they got on her case about Jesus Christ. They said that Jesus was nothing more than a prophet. She said he was God and Jesus Christ was God. And because she stood up for Jesus and made him more than just a man, they said he was just a man. She wouldn't accept that. And so they said, "We're going to meet you after school." After school, there was a a a big fight. And she didn't know any more than to defend what she believed. And they came against her physically. And she reacted physically. And they put her, she's in the hospital with broken bones and everything else. And she put five of the six in the hospital also. It was such a fight. And they said there was blood everywhere. It was a It was a gruesome fight. But she was fighting for the defense of Jesus Christ. And they don't even know what the outcome of all of this is going to be when they're finally out of the hospital. She's in contact with us from the hospital. And I read some of her emails. are long long and this girl's name is I don't know exactly how to pronounce it but I think it's Murtha probably Murtha correct and uh I was touched by her by her account by her testimony she doesn't know what to do and she hasn't got anybody to speak to she hasn't got anybody hasn't got anybody her mother just died just just days ago and she's really alone in the world and I I think that it would be Wonderful. You talk about doing something. I think be wonderful if a 14, 15 year old, 16 year old girl or older would say, "I'd like to write her and and just really encourage her and and give her some friendship." You know, we we sit here and it it's quite easy. And maybe some of you young people think that you've gone through some hard things, but let me tell you something. You really don't know what hardship is. There's some real hardship in the world and there are some people that are standing up for what's right. And so you want to be thankful and say, "Well, what can I do?" Well, one thing you can do is be thankful to God that you're sitting here today and you're able to be under the sound of the gospel and you can just tell the Lord how much you love him &gt;&gt; and give him what he desires. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we I want you to remember Mirththa and Pastor David Enoch and the saints in Liberia, the believers in in China. Oh, it's a wonderful hour we're living in, friends. And I'll tell you what, one of these moments, you're just going to take one breath, and that's going to be your last breath here. You're going to be changed in your body, and you'll start one step. You'll be putting one foot forward and that next step will be in the millennium &gt;&gt; because he'll say in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, we're going to be changed. Then what what is all this other going to mean? &gt;&gt; What's everything going to mean? We're happy to have our brother Vern Nygard here. Brother Vern is the father of brother Wes and brother Jeff Nygard. Brother Vern, why don't you stand? Been a believer for many years there. God bless him. Well, would you mind standing with me? And I'd like to just sing that once again. We place you in the highest place. Let's just move into the realm of the Holy Spirit. Shall we do that? Would you do that? Would you pray for me this morning? I'm just I'm wanting to address something and I want to move into a subject that I can't possibly finish just now. And I don't know perhaps what exactly I should say, but I want to I want him to say it. And I've offered him already. I said, "Lord, you be my you take my lips and my tongue. I dedicate it now to you." And let's all of us within ourselves say, "I give you my mind. I give you all that I am, all that I ever can be. And I'm going to lift you in the highest place." God bless you. [Music] Place you in the highest place. For you are the great high praise. We praise you. above all else [Music] and we come to you and worship your king from the bottom of your heart. Once again please we place you in the highest place. Oh, great high priest. We bless you. Our love [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we call you worship. [Applause] [Music] their heads bowed. Heavenly Father, we're not only placing you in the highest place. There is no God that can compare with you. There is no other God that's a living God. You're the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of creation. You are the father, our father which art in heaven. And we say today, hallowed be thy holy and righteous name. &gt;&gt; And as we come in the name of Jesus Christ, we are saying, let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven just now. Lord, I pray you will work through your vessels, work through your body, work through your church. Let your word be engraved upon the tablets of our heart now Lord and give voice and give speech. Give utterance oh God by the Holy Ghost. We are helpless without you. We can do nothing. Touch lives here oh God. Touch men and women I pray. Move them into a spiritual realm and out of this natural passing fading world. Move, oh God, your children. I pray be with those that are far distant places but yet very close by internet. Lord, they're meeting in so many places. I pray that you'll bless them. Anoint me now, Lord, and anoint the people in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. We're going to turn in the Bible and I'm going to read some from Exodus the 32nd chapter. And while you're turning, I want to formally welcome our uh Brother Eric and Sister Kylie Funk. I don't know whether they have been uh where's Brother Eric and Sitra? They're on holidays. And I choose the day they're on holidays. I thought they've been on holidays for about three months in Australia or someplace. All right. Well, I'm going to wait till I get back. But brother Eric and Sister Kylie, they sold their home in the Okonogan and they have actually formerly moved here and with their family. And although we've seen them on a regular basis, always came to the family camp and as often as they could, but we're so happy for them because we love them and we're going to receive them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. All right. While you're standing, we're going to read uh selected portions from Exodus chapter 32. And then I want to read a few verses from Genesis 3, starting at verse 9. Then, and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we ought not, what is become of him. And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. And all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron. And he received them in their hand and fashioned them in uh fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf. And they said, "These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord." And they rose up early on the tomorrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Get thee down, for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves." And then I want to uh turn a little further to uh God said he was going to destroy them. But look at verse 11. And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why do thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say, for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth, turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swearest by thine own self, and saidest unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and that they shall inherit it forever. And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his unto his people. And then Moses the from verse 15 on down talks of him coming down and of his anger and he cast down the tablets of stone which were in his hand. And verse 21, and Moses said to Aaron, what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my Lord wax hot. Thou knowest the people that they are set to mischief. Uh for they said unto me, "Make us gods, which shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we ought not what has become of him." And I said unto them, "Whosoever hath any gold, let him break it off." So they gave it to me. Then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. And when Moses saw that the people were naked, for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies, then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, "Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come unto me." And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. I will read from Genesis, please. verse three, I'm sorry, chapter 3, just a few verses, starting at verse 9. And the Lord called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. And he said, "Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat?" And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to me to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the Lord said unto the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat." I'll stop reading there. You may be seated. Thank you for remaining reverend while we read the word of God. I pray that God will help me and I ask you to be as quiet and reverent as possible. After Eve said, "And the serpent beguiled me and I did eat." The Lord said unto the serpent, "Because thou hast done this," he didn't ask him. He just said, "Because you have done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days thy life, and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed, and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Brother Brandham said, "Because the woman took life out of the world, God was going to cause her to bring life into the world. I'll greatly multiply thy conception and thy sorrow." I want to speak on the blame game. One of the principles that is here in this re scripture, in fact, it's both scriptures which we read today. And these principles span the entire spectrum of our life. It's our a whole psychological makeup is in these verses. It is so human. We are so given over to it that it's I would say all of us have engaged in it at one time or another and perhaps engage in it most every day and that is what is commonly known today as the blame game. We blame someone else. Now although and I'm going to go slowly because I want to go very carefully. Although we may at times there may be times when we respond inappropriately. We may say something uh we may do something we may act in a certain way that we regret right afterwards. we may uh respond in a way that we're very discouraged about. It gets us we we feel unhappy with ourselves. Uh there are those times we afterward we regret it. We may be drawn into the affairs of others inadvertently, not willingly. Sometimes there's no way to escape it because others it might be family, it might be extended family or friends, it might be brothers or sisters in the church, it might be uh you know uh work related and uh we will get drawn into the affairs of someone else and they make decisions which affect us uh directly or indirectly and we are affected by those decisions. And those decisions are not decisions that are pleasing to us. And they may not be spiritual decisions. They may not be something that move us in a spiritual direction. And we feel spiritually affected by it. Not in a positive sense, but in a negative sense. And we may respond to such a a situation. We may be uh we may be subjected to consequences of decisions that someone else may make. Someone else makes a decision. I'm going to do this. I'm going this way. I'm going that direction. And and so much of the consequence of their decision falls upon you. And you might say, "I never asked for this. I didn't want this. This isn't good for me. I don't feel this is good. I don't feel this is spiritually beneficial but there isn't a thing in the world I can do someone else's and so then the critical thing is how do we respond to that that's the critical part and I'm going to deal with something that I have seen and observed and it's it's absolutely catastrophic in its in its consequences and that is that and I'm going to make a statement there is no O valid reason for a believer to loose or be loosed from their faith in God as a result of any of these that I've just talked about. There is no valid reason for a person to turn aside from their faith. There is no valid reason for a person to throw in the towel and say, "Well, I'm done." There is no valid reason for a person to backslide. Zero. No valid reason. Regardless of what happens, regardless of what someone says, regardless of what someone does, regardless of what comes upon us, whether God allows it or whether someone else brings it on or whether the devil does it, whatever happens in life, there's no valid reason for me to surrender up my convictions. Your convictions, there's no valid reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; And though we might have justification in laying the blame over here or laying the blame over there, that does not justify the loosening of a person's faith in God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have watched people drift away from the from the very councils of God, from the word of God, from the very message. I've seen them drift slowly, almost imperceptibly, but you can see the little danger signs has come along, but in a matter of a short period of time, they're long gone. Right. &gt;&gt; And if you follow the course of their life, almost invariably sin enters, &gt;&gt; the world enters and they become swallowed up with the world. &gt;&gt; The world, it could be education. They may throw themselves into education. You can throw yourself into into business. You could throw yourself into pleasure. You could throw yourself into sports. all of those things your life may you may live a good life but that that is that that's the very thing I'm speaking about now at this moment to me that is surrendering up your spiritual convictions your spiritual life for the things say well because this or because that it might not even be a negative thing that comes it might be a positive thing as far as the world is concerned it might be a great test that is coming your way it might come in the form of a wonderful offer. You know, it might be a rose that th Satan throws at the feet of the people. Not something negative, but something a great opportunity. And Satan is sucking you in. &gt;&gt; He's He's attracting you, sucking you in to a vortex that you won't have. It will squeeze out the God in your life unless you take up a real valiant position. I mean uh uh not just consecration. I'm talking about being determined, being resolved, being as the rock of Gibralar. You have to keep that. &gt;&gt; And I've seen others I've seen them right here in this congregation. I've seen them go through college, go through university, withstand all of the forces of the ungodly atmosphere that is there, and still come out the other end serving God. and having lived their testimony. You don't have to surrender it up. You don't have to surrender up your testimony. You can live it in the midst of all of that wickedness and evil. And that's what God intends us to do. &gt;&gt; There is no I'm going to be repeating that not because I don't think you grasp it, but because I want to make it a theme. There is no valid reason. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't ever come to me with a valid reason that you feel is valid for having surrendered up your spiritual walk with God. There is no reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that ought to be 100%. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An agreement with this congregation. Yeah, I've heard some of the weakest arguments put forward as an excuse for being in a backslid condition. I wonder what goes on in the mind or if that individual even has any concept of eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone said something, someone did something, someone. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; you're going to put that on the scale with eternal life over in this side. What is it over here that's worthy of of of missing out over here? Amen. &gt;&gt; And even though even though what we are going through and some have been dragged through vicious, terrible, horrific circumstances, some have been dragged through it, not even as a result of their own decision or their own doing. And that's when it's really, really hard. But that is the time that you need to shore up. That's the time you need to strengthen your faith in God. That's the time you need to draw nearer to Christ &gt;&gt; and seek your answers from the word. Sometimes even though we are going through some of these things and I'm going to identify some just before we turn to this some other scriptures I have uh right within this congregation and I've seen it elsewhere as you know having traveled considerable but parents we have our children and we raise them we bring them in up in a godly atmosphere. They know what it is to be in the house of God. They know what it is to hear the scriptures read. They know the songs of Zion. And they've been brought up in the right kind of atmosphere. Then they get to be, you know, uh start making their own decisions. They young men, young women, they start trailing off in a direction that is so grievous to the parents. And they may they may go into the depths of sin. And then the parents become disillusioned, disillusioned with the very gospel they have their own faith in and start surrendering up. &gt;&gt; Then they disappear. &gt;&gt; I say that is a double disaster because now the one who's away, the young person who has drifted off and gone their own way, doesn't have a beacon light anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, you know, I understand, you know, the pressures of of youth and the pressures, the peer pressure and and all of this, but where's the beacon light? Where's my where's my mother's standard? Where's my father's where's my father's integrity anymore? Where's the beacon light that I once had? &gt;&gt; Where is it? What What is all of this that was told me about this pure holy gospel? Where is it anymore?" I tell you, my brother, my sister, we need, as Moses said, who's on the Lord's side. Come and stand here. Stand by me. Stand by this word. Regardless of what happens, say, "Well, I'm disappointed. I'm disillusioned. I'm I'm uh uh uh I maybe have failed, even though all of that may be true. You might be discouraged. You might be disillusioned. You might have failed. But there's no valid reason for giving up a spiritual walk with God. &gt;&gt; None whatsoever. &gt;&gt; You'll never get me to change that sentence. &gt;&gt; There's no valid reason. &gt;&gt; You need to you need to even strengthen your stand with God so they have a they have a a a sure light, a beacon light. You can say whatever my child does, whatever my son does, whatever my daughter does, whatever my brother, my husband, my wife or whoever they are, whatever they do, I shall remain unmovable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; That means let it be so. I'm coming down to our address today. Say some weward son, some weward daughter. And then and then they get in and and and and are are being counseledled or being under the influence of the Holy Spirit say, "Wow, you know, the waring that goes on their mind. My goodness, when I turned aside from these things, my mother went out and cut her hair and put on pants and went into the world and and all the rest of it and goes around with makeup and who knows, maybe with some other man or whatever more, you talk about a struggle. They've got a horrible battle to overcome because of that. But if they can turn around and say, "My mother, she would not stop praying for me. My mother, she remained steadfast. I could go home and she was there. I could go to church and she was there. My father, he raised the standard. He told me, "Whatever happens to you, son, I'm here. I'm praying for you. Whatever happens to your wife, husband, whatever more, I'm here. I will be unmovable. I will be undaunted in my in my faith in God. &gt;&gt; And my faith goes beyond this life. Whether it happens here or I'll be believing it when I rise in the resurrection. I said, "I'll be believing it when I rise in the resurrection." &gt;&gt; There's an example in the scripture where the young people, the young man, God came and spoke to him. You'll know who it is in just a moment. God came in the form of an angel, a man to him and addressed him. His name was Gideon. And he's the one who made the statement, "If God before us, where be all his miracles? Where is this God?" His father had groves. His father had idols. His father was a circumcised Hebrew &gt;&gt; who had gone back &gt;&gt; and had idols. &gt;&gt; Had gone back to his old life. But there was something in this young man. &gt;&gt; I tell you, there was something in him. &gt;&gt; Even though father's given up and surrendered his faith in God, in the God of Israel, I will not be moved. Oh, God give us men like that. &gt;&gt; God give us young men like that. &gt;&gt; You know what kind of a message he got? God said, "Take your father's altar, throw it down, &gt;&gt; and cut down his grove and throw down his idols and destroy them." &gt;&gt; He respected him. He respected his father. He loved his father. But he was not going to surrender up &gt;&gt; what God had spoke to him, what God had made real to him. I appreciated what happened. He feared him enough. The Bible says, "And it came to pass." Judges 6, you can just jot it down if you want. Came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him, "Take thy father's young bullock, even the second Even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it, and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock." What is it that he's doing? What is it that God is doing? God is saying, "Disregard. have no respect to to what your father's gone back to, but remain absolutely steadfast and build an altar to God. Cast down this other thing. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, cast down." You know what? There's idols. Maybe a father go back who who knows? Maybe his idol in the world was some sports fans or whatever more. Who knows what it was? Maybe it was entertainment. Maybe it was the movies. Maybe it was the television. He was addicted to it. He was a couch potato. Whatever it is. But now God begins to breathe some new life into some young man, some son. And he says, "I'm going to cast that thing down. I won't have any part with that. I'm going I'm going the way of holiness. &gt;&gt; I'm going the direction of the God of Israel. I'm not going to have anything to do with that. I cast it down &gt;&gt; and I'm going to raise up I'm going to raise up an altar to God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My father going to come into my presence. He's going to know. He's going to know that I'm serving the God who sent this word to us in this hour. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to call what's clean clean. I'm going to call what's unholy unholy. I'm going to call purity purity. I'm going to call sin sin &gt;&gt; in the face of father, mother, or whoever else. And Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him. And and so it was because he feared his father's household. He did have some fear for his father's household. He respected it. And the men of the city that he could not do it by day, so he went and did it by night and he destroyed and cut down the grove. Incidentally, when they cut down groves, it took years and years and years to grow those trees. &gt;&gt; It took years to establish what was established. And when you cut down trees in that country, you were doing a very, very severe damage to a person. &gt;&gt; And he went and cut all the trees down. &gt;&gt; And cast down the idol. Brother John. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And when the men of the city rose up early in the morning, and behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second book was offered upon the altar that was built. And they said one to another, "Who hath done this thing?" And when they inquired and asked, they said, "Gideon, the son of Joash, hath done this thing. Oh my, &gt;&gt; there was something there had to be something within Gideon. &gt;&gt; They saw some integrity in him, in his life. He hadn't made a great mark in the world, but there was something in him. There was a not merely a stability, but there was a strength. &gt;&gt; I like to use the word integrity. There was a real in spiritual integrity. They could say there was something different about him. He took the things of God serious. No doubt he kept his nose in the Torah. He was in the law of Moses. And thinking about it, he was it was on his mind. He perhaps said to his friends, "Where is the where is the God of Israel? Where are these miracles that God has sent? Where is the old where is the priesthood they used to stand for the the the law and the word of God to us? Where are the men? &gt;&gt; Where are the family? Look where we are." He probably thought with grief, "My own father, my own father has gone back to his gods, &gt;&gt; living there in idolatry. which was adulterous, living there, worshiping there, probably within his own mind and imagination. Someday I'd like to go up there and cut that grove down. I'd like to destroy that old altar of Baal that was in him. And God saw that was in him. Listen to me, my brother, my sister. God sees what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God sees what's there. &gt;&gt; It's not just sitting there for not. God sees what's there. The day will come when he'll speak to an individual. Say, "Stand up." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be counted now. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, well, the church is going loose and the church is going laxidasical and this and that." Stand up then. Be counted &gt;&gt; for the God of this word. &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. If you merely sit back, this generation isn't going to take you in a God-word direction. &gt;&gt; If you just sit back, young people, your school isn't going to take you in a godward direction. &gt;&gt; For most of you, except those that are in the school that are here and and and most of you are not because you're in senior years. Your teachers are not full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They're not full of the Holy Ghost. They're not going to encourage you on you. I I trust and pray God that you have a beacon light at home where you have a father and a mother that are urging you on and putting you in an atmosphere, a spiritual atmosphere and sending you in that direction. I perhaps haven't got the best footprints in the world, but I don't want to be ashamed of them either. And I don't mind saying to my three daughters, follow dad's footsteps. &gt;&gt; And I think that's the very least we can say. &gt;&gt; Follow dad's footsteps. Maybe we didn't make a big mark in the world, but at least it'll take you back to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Dad's footsteps will lead you to an altar. Dad's footsteps will lead you to a chair. Dad's footsteps will lead you to a place where you can read the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, dad's footsteps, mother's footsteps led you shopping. Mother's footsteps led you in a big a big uh a big spree. Mother's footsteps had you led you to all the garage sales in the country. Shame. &gt;&gt; You can do what you want with this message, but I say shame." Yes. &gt;&gt; You want mother's footsteps to show that they led them to a place where where they knew how to pray, where they knew how to get answers from God. &gt;&gt; And there may be mothers here today that need to repent today. &gt;&gt; Repent means turn around. Go the other direction. We need to change our course. There are fathers today that need to repent. Don't I don't care what you think of this message. If it's a truth, if it's the truth, then say amen to the truth. If it's the truth, then say, "I'm going to do it." &gt;&gt; I'm burning up, friends. &gt;&gt; It's been on my mind for some time, and I really waited on God. I know I won't even begin to finish what is on my heart. But if you'll just help me. But my biggest concern is that you don't sit and listen and think this is just another sermon. I'm speaking directly to the individuals today. I'm speaking to families in this church. I'm speaking to individuals. I want them to hear it. Whether it's the women in the in the nursery, I want them to sit quiet and hear. Or whether it's those that are connected on the internet. Last Sunday, we had 88 88 places that were tuned to us on the internet. It doesn't do me any good if people sit here and then go out and live their own way. It's not our own selfish life anymore. &gt;&gt; We're a part of the body of Christ and we are responsible to one another. and parents especially responsible to their children. God is going to hold you responsible. How you led and the kind of light you left for your children to follow. God gave them to you. &gt;&gt; God gave that life to you. And at least of regardless of what happens to them, you want to be able to stand before God and said, "I left the best beacon light I knew. I I I did all I knew to do. &gt;&gt; Am I my brother's keeper? Amen. &gt;&gt; We might say, "I don't have any friends in the church." I've heard that. I don't have any friends in the church. I'm the only one. I don't have any friends in the church. Yeah, there's a lot of young people. There's a lot of someone else. There's a lot of families, but I don't have any friends in the church. So, &gt;&gt; I'm going to throw in the towel. God will hold you accountable for that. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to loosen up. I'm going to go and seek friends elsewhere in the world. &gt;&gt; God going to hold you accountable for that. &gt;&gt; And what you sow, you're going to reap. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You're going to reap it. That's the law of God's word. I don't have to say it. You're going to reap it. &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to prevent you from reaping it. &gt;&gt; And so, it's the blame game. Well, because of this, because of what someone did, because a set of circumstances, we make an excuse because I got a certain physical thing. I've leaned on the arm of flesh. So long that's all I trust anymore is the arm of flesh. I just run to the doctor and I haven't got anything but going to a doctor. I was to one just the other day. But I run to the doctor. I just And now I've just become so dependent. I'm going to come right down there. No use beating around the bush. &gt;&gt; I've got so depressed with my situation. And they've got me on on this kind of pill. got me on that kind of pill. And I can tell you those pills going to take you and drift you away from God, not closer to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they become dependent. &gt;&gt; I've visited people in the hospital that become absolutely dependent upon their drugs. &gt;&gt; And those drugs never took them in a direction of faith. &gt;&gt; Always took them in a direction of unbelief. And it had so many side effects they become psychotic. &gt;&gt; They weren't themselves anymore. I have visited with people years ago. They are not the same people today. &gt;&gt; And I am speaking that not against individuals. I'm speaking that against the devil himself. &gt;&gt; I despise that enemy. &gt;&gt; And it did not restore their faith. It destroyed their faith. They became so dependent upon those things. You know, one of the big things today, in fact, there's this big news last week and there's a big movement within the Canadian government and the and the First Nations, which are the native Indian people, are appealing to the government, come and help us because you have made such a great percentage of our people addicts. &gt;&gt; You have made them addicts. And they did a survey this last few days, this last week. And there were people, there were people, native people, and this also is in our community, native people taking up to 15. They were going to one doctor and then another doctor and another doctor so they could acquire all the drugs that they needed. And they had up to 15 prescriptions. Literally legal drug addicts. Say, why are you saying that? You don't have any right to claim a message and be a legal drug addict. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, then you're saying the message which is Christ is powerless. &gt;&gt; I got my power in a bottle. &gt;&gt; I got my help in a bottle. &gt;&gt; Where are we, friends? Where are we? You have a message and you got your aid in a Bible. Where's the power of God? &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Where's the God that that Gideon called upon? If God be God, where is his miracle? I'm glad we have the angel of the Lord. The same one that delivered this message is the same one that's leading us on. So, Adam did what was only natural for him. I want you to notice the words. Help me. &gt;&gt; It's not easy preaching this. &gt;&gt; Did you eat the fruit? His answer should have been yes. &gt;&gt; No, he said the woman that you gave me. &gt;&gt; This really goes right back to you. &gt;&gt; Somehow God is responsible. &gt;&gt; God is supposed to be able to He's all in and all. He's supposed to be able to look after these things. Somehow God failed. And people don't say it directly. They don't say, "God, you failed." But they will put the blame and shift it around until it's not their fault anymore. &gt;&gt; It's not my fault that you gave me this woman, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You didn't only create her, you brought her to me. &gt;&gt; And she's the problem. &gt;&gt; And if you hadn't brought her to me, I wouldn't be in this situation. It didn't cut the mustard. &gt;&gt; It didn't work. Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "The woman that you gave me, she gave it to me." Go to the woman. Did you eat it? She doesn't say yes either. &gt;&gt; Says, "Well, the serpent that you know, you made the serpent. &gt;&gt; I didn't create him. You created him. &gt;&gt; I didn't make him so handsome. Right? &gt;&gt; And he beguiled me. He had the power. And beguile is also not only it it means to to to beguile a person is to beguile them sometimes by charm &gt;&gt; or by deception. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said she was deceived. So she's simply saying, "I didn't know what I was doing." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I didn't know it was going to come out this way. How did I know this was going to happen? &gt;&gt; I didn't know. I was deceived into it. Okay. So then God goes the serpent. He didn't say did you do this? He said because you did it. I'm glad, brother Brandham, how we had a prophet in this day. Says, "Finally, in the final analysis, all of this sin and all this unbelief will be tracked right back down through history and come right back on him who created it or not created, but who invented it in the first place." And I'm going to rejoice when Satan fa when Satan feels the full impact of all of the unbelief and sin. But in the meantime, we're not to give in to him. We're not going to surrender up to him, friends. And I pray that this church here will have a sound in the earth that it has stood for truth &gt;&gt; and it has stood with a force and a strength and integrity and the people were unmoved, undaunted &gt;&gt; in their faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message token, &gt;&gt; he said, "We know that this hour is here. This hour is here now. Judgments is at hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what are we going to do with it? That's because the message had now arrived and the token was being applied. And he said, "There's only one way you could ever get it off of you." He said, "I'd hate to have his blood upon me in in that sense. There's only one way he can get it off you." He said, "You can't wash it off." Pilate tried that. He tried to pass the buck on to somebody else. He said, "Send him over to Caesar." &gt;&gt; He said, "He couldn't. You can't pass the buck. or to someone else. He said it backfired. It fell right back on him. In the message preparations said Eve wrapped herself up in some fig leaves and Adam, but when it came time to face God, they were condemned. They realized that their man-made religion wouldn't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when God called them, he said, "Now how true it is today when God had prepared himself to speak with a Adam and Adam in a man-made way was trying to prepare himself." And I see this also people try to prepare themselves to speak to God, but God had to prepare Adam to speak to him. So in order to do that, they begin to pass the buck one to the other in the old street expression. And then what happened? God went out and got some skins and made made them aprons. God was the only one that had a solution for the situation that they were in. And he's the only one this morning that has a solution for the situation that we find ourselves in. This a very complex generation, a very weward generation. I was thinking this morning as I was in prayer early this morning. Well, not that early, but it was fairly early and I was thinking I started praying for some of you children. I was thinking of this girl Merta and I was just thinking what kind of a what kind of a start did she have in life? And I begin to think of you young people here and a lot of them born now. You're young men and women, you have your own families. they've got children. I got thinking, you know, when they were just young, Lord Jesus, I'm going to be speaking to people this morning and they some of when they were five and six and four years old and they heard the gospel, they heard about Christ and they've seen the power of God and then they grew on up and they became into the age of accountability and they were baptized and they went on further. Today they're young men and young women and some of them are parents and have their children and some have drifted off. Some have gone. Parents have gone the way of the world been swallowed up by the earth as it was in the scripture. But I thought, "Oh God, help us so that we remain steadfast, &gt;&gt; unmovable." &gt;&gt; And friends, we can't do it in our own strength. But the God who sent this word, &gt;&gt; the God who delivered it, the God who proved it is the same God today. &gt;&gt; Absolutely the same today. Does this congregation believe that? You believe that? We can't pass it off to someone else. I could go on and on when the governments in the city whenever anything you know goes sideways then they see where we're going to lay the blame. There came a crisis and we read about it in chapter 32. shame a crisis and this is a crisis friends don't don't let your mind wander now this was a crisis that God never forgot and it may not have looked so bad but the people started to say where is this man Moses that brought us out and led us into this wilderness you know what they forgot you know what they forgot You know what? They forgot something that we we not the churches surrounding here, but we as believers are in grave danger. It's not a man who led us out to where we are. &gt;&gt; It's not a preacher. &gt;&gt; It's not even William Brham that led you out where you are. &gt;&gt; And the thing they were missing, they said, "Where is this man?" But God spoke to them directly through Moses and said, "The angel of the Lord shall go before you and lead you to where you're supposed to go." And they failed to remember. They failed to know that I am here because the angel of God has led us here. &gt;&gt; I say to this congregation, if you've been led for any other reason, you're in the wrong track. You're in the wrong track. If you've been following Ed Biscll, you're in the wrong track. &gt;&gt; If you just been following a man, people have thought, well, you know, if it's brother Brandham the prophet, it is indeed. But it's more than him. It's what came out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; And so, because many stay connected to the man, they got to have another man and another man. They got to have another hero, another one with a special revelation. And they have led them into some sad direction. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they went to the priest. You know, I have been called. I'm going to say some things here you probably never heard. I've been called by those that had grand revelations. I've been called. Oh, you're just a kind old priest. You're the one that kisses the babies. But those very men that uttered those words today, I don't even know where they are. Some of them, their churches have blown to pieces and they're off in the mountain someplace. They've stopped preaching the gospel. Some are backslid, whatever more. And I I just say to the glory of God, they call me what they want. But I'm still here declaring this gospel. And I intend to stay here. And I intend to preach it. And I intend to go out of this world in a blaze of fire for the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I want you to do the same. I want you to make that same commitment. Say, "The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob is my God." The God of the prophet of God, the God of William Brandham, the God of Elijah is my God. &gt;&gt; And this message is a word of God that has come to us. It's a revealed word. And I don't find another word in the world that is that is sustaining the people in this generation. And so when we say that we have this, it is here. The pillar of fire is here. And the angel of the Lord has led us here. Let us not get let us not get uh uh our minds filled with other thoughts that we're here because some man brought us here or some church brought us here. It is the God of the word. It is the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is none other than the God of Elijah that is still present here today. &gt;&gt; But the conditions got to such a place. He said, "We know not." Moses delayed to come down from the mountain. And the people gathered themselves to Aaron and said up make us gods that may they may go before us. He delayed us. He delayed. I'm going to go slowly. In the Hebrew it is that we have been brought to we're ashamed. We have been disappointed. uh we're ashamed before one another sometime we're ashamed before the people because okay and I'm just going to give you a scenario because we stood so true we stood steadfast we said this is the word this is the message of the hour it's not like any other message and then our families grew up under I committed my family I committed my wife to it I committed and maybe the wife went this way or the husband went that way or the children went this way and and and where is this God of William Brown? Where's this God that brought this message? Where is this God? And then that's just exactly what Satan wants you to say. &gt;&gt; And then that person gives up and surrenders their courageous strength and they they they just surrender it up. They surrender up their convictions. What they're saying is this man brought us out into this wilderness and now he's gone and we're we're stuck out here and now we're disappointed. &gt;&gt; And what are the nations going to say? We're we're ashamed. &gt;&gt; That's what they're saying. &gt;&gt; He has delayed. He has we're disillusioned with him this message. And that's exactly what happened to the disciples at the cross. &gt;&gt; They said, "We're disappointed. &gt;&gt; Where's the miracles? Where's the great signs? Where's the great things that are supposed to happen?" And they're not. Where's this Christ of power? Oh, my brother, my sister, God is not uh God is not being confounded with any of of the of the things that man does. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says also they made a calf. God speaks of it in Psalms. He speaks of it in Ne in Nehemiah. God never forgot that they made this calf. He never forgot it. David said they made a calf in Harb and worshiped the molten image. And Nehemiah said, "Yay, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, this is thy God, and brought thee up that brought thee up out of Egypt, and it wrought great provocations." This was a great sin. The scripture speaks of it to the people. And so now I want us to see how this progressed. Are you listening? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch how it progressed, please. The people failed to realize that was the angel of the Lord. I I referred to it, but let me read it to you. In Exodus 23, we're in Exodus 32. But long before that, God spoke and said, "Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him and obey his voice." Not even speaking about Moses now. Beware of him, the angel. Obey his voice, which would speak through the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And obey his voice, and provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thy adversary. Have we got adversaries? Yes, we have many. God said, "You follow the angel of the Lord, the one who brought the word to you, the one who brought you to it. You follow him and I'll be an enemy to your enemies. &gt;&gt; I'll be an adversary to your adversary. I tell you friends, that's the kind of that's the kind of uh language I like to hear. And Moses in his commission, he said, "And we without a leader are helpless." And Christ is our leader, and God was Moses leader, though he sent an angel to lead him. &gt;&gt; He said, "I I send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I have promised." The angel was their leader. My brother, my sister, Sunday morning, 10:30, you're here in a service. And many of you have come from all we've come from all walks of life and all kinds of geographical locations. We have one thing in common. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is that the angel of the Lord has led us to where we are. Not some man, &gt;&gt; not some shiny thing, not some program, not some other thing that enticed you, but something within you. &gt;&gt; God, the angel of the Lord brought you to where you are. Yeah, &gt;&gt; some of you came across the seas, across lands, across continents, across states, across provinces, and then you said, "Well, uh, I arrived and, uh, and my life took such a turn, and here I found my wife. You didn't find your wife." The angel of the Lord led you there. The angel of the Lord led you to where you're sitting here today. The angel of the Lord want you to hear this service this morning. You are not here by accident. None of you are here by accident. Not one person here by accident. The angel of the Lord. It has nothing to do with me. This message came from God. &gt;&gt; He's the one who vindicated it. He's the one who stood there with the pillar of fire. He's the one who spoke out of that prophet's mouth. He's the one who revealed the secrets of the heart. He's the one who delivered this message to us. &gt;&gt; And it's not complicated. It's actually rather quite simple, but we failed many times to do it. And when we fail to obey the voice, we start leaning on the arm of the flesh. You might say, "Well, what would you do, brother Bis? If you were in my case, I'd sooner trust God." In some cases, I'd sooner trust God and die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than depend on the arm of flesh. If that depending dependence on the arm of flesh was going to cause me to drift and drift and cause me to be out here and be something else. God made me who I am. God made you who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to be something else that some uh some some pharmacist has made you. &gt;&gt; If I have a pain, I don't mind taking a Tylenol or take something else. I'm talking about something that's very, very evident. Brother Herb and Sister Rita Rutherford are gone. Wonderful saints of God. Brother Tony right here. I had to call him in the wee hours of the morning one day. Sister Rita called me. She says, "Herbs on the floor. I can't get them up. It was cold." And so I called Tony. I said, "Come quick. I got to go over there. We arrived at his house. I'm telling you this because I know it. I'm telling you this because I'm speaking from experience. And he's laying on the floor. He's turned blue. Just had had just his shorts on stumbling out of bed. Knocked over and broke I think a a table and stuff was strewing around. And beside his bed is sleeping pills. quite a large bottle of them. Helium, which they've outlawed here in Canada, outlawed in the States, outlawed in Britain, because it actually destroys your mind. And I looked at the bottle, 200 pills. I even had that prescribed to me years ago for a trip to overseas. And my doctor who trusts me implicitly never gave me over 30. Said, "Who is this man who's accredited by the college of physicians and surgeons and give this man 200 sleeping pills?" He was laying on the floor. We had to call an ambulance and rush him to the hospital. become dependent on it. I asked a man once, "How many of these have you taken?" Another case, I grabbed his prescription. I says, "How many of these have you taken?" He says, "Four." I looked at the I I I looked at the the date on the on the thing. Looked on the date that we were at now. He had taken 29. Enough to put a person right out and maybe out of this life into another life. Who is this doctor? Who is this man that you're trusting? I sooner die and trust God. &gt;&gt; You got a pain, take a pill. It's not against my religion. But if that starts to make you drift away from the confidence in God, the confidence of the supernatural, if it start to destroy your faith, I would do away with it immediately. and I'd suffer the consequence. &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother Bisco, you don't know the pain. I know the pain of a slip disc that comes against the spinal cord, so I can't even hold my book. I can't hold my Bible. I can't preach a service. I'm laying with my arm over my head in excruciating pain. They said, "We'll take you right in. Here's morphine." And I had to I have the morphine bottle yet with a doctor's note on it so I can pass across borders. I took three of them and he told me, "These are very addictive. That's it. Forget it. I'm not going to become dependent on this thing. &gt;&gt; I'll spike my way through 7 weeks. Lost lost 10 lbs in two weeks from the sheer pain of it." We know a little bit about pain. Not a whole lot, but a little bit. But I know one thing more. while sitting in a tub of hot water just to get some relief, not intending to say anything more than a little short prayer, looked up to God, said, "God, if thou wilt, thou can make me whole." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I never intended on saying one more word, but it was like a rut of some supernatural thing went through me, and my own mouth spoke, I will be thou whole. I stood here in this in this pullpit and said to you that's what God said. I didn't say it. He said it. &gt;&gt; And if he said it, he's the one who has to do it. I don't have to make it happen. He has to make it happen. &gt;&gt; Two weeks later, walked right into Dr. Chan's office, a neurosurgeon who is who has conducted 800 plus operations on the neck, spinal operations, a specialist. I said, "Book me in." Out of his own mouth, he said, "There is no other remedy for you." Two weeks earlier, there's no remedy. We have to go in. We have to remove it. We have to take that. What's left? I have to suck that out. He said, "We put the two I take a bone out of your hip or take a cow bone and I have to I have to fuse those together and that's the only way he that's what came out of his mouth." Two weeks later, he said, "Sign this right here and I'll put you in the first bed. Emergency operation." I I signed it. Two weeks later, I said I cancel that. No, I I'd said that earlier. I asked them earlier to cancel it. They said, "That's the only way." So, two weeks later, I went in. I said, "Book me as soon as you can possibly get me in. Book me in." He said, "But how are you?" I said, "Well, I'm the same. I've lost 10 pounds in the last two weeks. If that's any answer," he said, "but how are you?" I said, "Well, I'm I'm the same." He said, "Well, maybe you should wait." He's the one saying now. He refused to asked him three times formally take me in and do the operation because I felt I needed to just put the word of God to the test. Not tempting him, just put it to the test. Three times he refused. When I walked out, I was just going to my car. I was going down the sidewalk. I looked at my wife who was on this side of me. I remember like it was yesterday. I said to her, "Something just happened." I said, "I feel like I've just taken a step about 25%." I said, "About 25% to my healing." And it was 7 weeks from that time. But I knew that God had spoken it. And I said here over this pulpit, for those of you that here, I said, "God didn't say be improved." &gt;&gt; God did not say be better. He said be whole. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm here tonight to witness this afternoon that that God is still a God that speaks. That's that's a God that spoke to you, Brother David Law. That's a God that spoke to you. That's a God that spoke to you, Brother Ken Bookho. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a God that speaks. I feel like giving him glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our grandson Joel just had a birthday. I said to my wife, she always keeps a little Hallmark calendar. I said, "Find the find the little calendar." When we were in India, I remember it like it was yesterday. I walked over and I knelt in my bed and had my Bible open and just a voice and I just spoke it. I said, and she's sitting in the corner reading her Bible and I said, "We'll have another grandson. His name will be Joel." March the 10th of 1984. One week later, his granddaddy, Brother Tom Ray, and they're in Phoenix today having meetings. But one week later, the note on that Saturday is Tom's dad died today. Died suddenly. They couldn't get him to the hospital fast enough. Just at 59 years old. And Joanne was not feeling real well and she went to the doctor on that day when her when her father-in-law died and he said, "You're pregnant." One week later, I'm kneeling in India. We're not even home yet. I gave it to Joel. I photocopied it and enlarged it. I want you to keep this. The God that said that has something in his mind. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, the angel that led you here, I have so much more I want to say, but the angel that led you here, he has a plan. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. &gt;&gt; Don't surrender up your conviction. Don't surrender up. Don't loosen up. &gt;&gt; Not in this age. Not in this time. &gt;&gt; Young people, don't bend for anything. Don't bend for anything that's around. None of your peers, none of your friendship, none of the suggestion. Make your atmosphere in the house of God and around the believers. I say that to everyone. &gt;&gt; I have no apology for what I spoke this morning. &gt;&gt; No apology whatsoever. &gt;&gt; I believe it's the absolute truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; And remember, one thing that won't cut it with God is I'm this way or I'm doing this because of that. That's not the reason. &gt;&gt; That's called the blame game. And we're not into that. And it didn't work with Adam. It didn't work with Eve. &gt;&gt; And it didn't work with Aaron. &gt;&gt; He said, you know, the people are given over to this mischief. &gt;&gt; Blamed it on the people. &gt;&gt; The people are are after this. You know, the people are desiring something. So, I just gave into it. The Bible says, I haven't got time. We're already through our The Bible says that Aaron told them specifically, "Break off your earrings of your wives and your daughters and your sons and put them in the fire." And the Bible says he he graved, he made, &gt;&gt; he actually constructed this image. It came out. But when it was all over, and the Bible says this, the Bible says when Moses came down, Joshua, he couldn't get the sound. He thought they're having a revival. They're rejoicing. This is the sound of victory. Moses, that old prophet, no, he said, "This is not the sound of them that have gotten the victory. This is not the sound of them who've been defeated. and he come down and the Bible says it's very curious says and Moses saw their nakedness &gt;&gt; and he saw that Aaron had made them naked and the word for nakedness is that the restraints were given over. Aaron gave in to their desire and made them naked before God. the restraints were gone. And when I I saw that, I said, "God, I'm going to come to the altar today, and I'm going to come to the pulpit today, and I'm going to come to the platform today, say, the restraints need to stay in force. The restraints need to be reestablished." And mothers and fathers, if you've allowed it to be loosened up because of the pressure of the school or the pressure of the children or the pressure of my work or the pressure of something else, don't play the blame game. Don't allow those restraints to be loosened up. &gt;&gt; Strengthen them. &gt;&gt; And this morning is a morning of repentance. Say, "I repent before God. I'm not going to go that direction anymore." &gt;&gt; You'll find one day in eternity that what I'm saying today here is absolutely the truth. And now it's not on my hands anymore. It's on yours. God's going to ask you one day. I declare before God, God's going to ask you one day, what did you do with that service? &gt;&gt; You think I put my servant through all twisted up nervous feeling and studying before God seven days a week, not six days or five days, go on Sunday and go on Monday and all day Saturday and barely squeeze a little time off to be able to deliver this to you. and you're going to sit there and just say, "Well, ho, how I'mma take it if I want to take it, or I got some other idea." Your idea won't wash with God. &gt;&gt; God's not interested in your reasoning. He's not interested in your excuses. He's not interested in your circumstances because God is greater than all of those things. What are we going to say? I'm caught in a certain situation. I'm caught in a certain and God's not big enough to deliver me. Who is your God? Your God isn't the God of this message. Then &gt;&gt; your God isn't the God of the prophet. Your God's not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's some other God. &gt;&gt; But this God is able to deliver out of any situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I look for him to do so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Our God is a mighty God. &gt;&gt; This is a God of Moses. This a God of Elijah. This is a God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ whose spirit raised him up out of the dead. This is a God that's going to change your body. &gt;&gt; This is a God that's going to raise him out of this the sleeping out of the earth. This is a God. And if we haven't got that God, I don't care what our circumstance is. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your situation is, physical, mental, financial, or any other way. We are not depending upon the arm of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Especially when those situations get us driftest further and we become more distant from God, more distant from this holy godly way. I say return to the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; To this whole congregation of Bible way, return. Some of you men, some of you fathers made weak, lame excuses. You ought to repent. You ought to fall on your face before God this morning and say, "I repent. I return to this God of Elijah. I return back to this God of the word." I've heard such lame excuses of the women. You are why you are because of something. I've heard them say, "Uh, I get headaches from long hair." I say, "Repent." &gt;&gt; Repent. &gt;&gt; There's a message for repentance. Not a message to be heard and go out and forget what you heard. It's a message to say, I changed. I turn around. &gt;&gt; I'm turning around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to obey. I'm going to heed the voice of God. &gt;&gt; You think I'm singing? I'm I'm preaching this for my own satisfaction. Far from it. I'd far far sooner be somewhere else. I'd far sooner have my feet up someplace else. I'd far sooner have a day off saying this because it's truth and because it must be spoken. It must be said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't pass it off on the husband or the wife or the parents or the young people. You can't pass it off &gt;&gt; cuz God won't hear it. I'm here to tell you God won't honor it. God will not acknowledge it at all. Say, "Well, it's because of this or because of that." God won't honor it. While those things may be true, I've been called serpent seat. I've been called the kind old priest. I've been called every kind of dastardly thing. I had two phone calls this last week. Left long messages and they are so insane. Completely way off calling brother Brandon, brother Brandon, Brother Bisl, brother Bisco. I mean, they're way off into some insane place. and and and it troubled me and I knew it was some evil spirit &gt;&gt; cuz I woke up very early in the morning about 4. You think this is not supernatural friends? I'm talking about supernatural God. I experience it every week. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I was troubled. I'd had a dream. The dream doesn't mean anything to you. Meant very little to me. But I was troubled. So, I got up and walked into my office to do something. While I was standing there, I saw the light on my phone. I thought, "That's strange. I didn't remember hearing the phone ring." And that light wasn't on when we got home from our visitation, but I'll I'll I better see what it is. It might be an emergency. a female young woman's voice came on and she began. It wasn't even she wasn't coherent in her thoughts. She was completely in insane condition. Completely insane. And I listen to every word she's been in this church. She's heard the message like you all hear the message. But somehow, and I'm sure I don't know who she is exactly, I have my ideas. I think she even held some position in the church. Somewhere along the line, something crept in and just began she began to drift. There's no end to that drifting, friends. I tell you, before God, it ends up in some dark abyss. And I doubt if even a good gospel message right now could reach her short of God giving her some sanity back in her mind. And she talks about brother Brandham and she goes off into Nostradamus off into astrology back down here again and into the into what she's heard and then she's picking out some dates and talking about a child she has and makes all kinds of incoherent references back and forth and talk. She's fluent. She's she's she's fluent. She's intelligent. Very intelligent and way off into some dark place. God, I hope there isn't a man or a woman or a young person that's sitting here today that ends up where she is. Only the grace of God could even find her and bring her back. And right in the middle of her conversation, in comes a four-letter word. That unclean demon speaking out of her mouth. Oh God, in the place she's headed right now, friends, even where she is, be like a millennium to where she's going, short of the grace of God. Is that necessary? Was it necessary for her to be there? I don't believe so. But somewhere along the line, I'm closing. Brother Brandham says, and he says it for a reason, you can believe in predestination all you want, but he says this, it's not easy to go to hell. Says you have to fight over your conscience. There was something down in here. Even when you were allowing it, even when you took that first step to loosen up and go, just when you were loosening it up and and and saying, "Well, because of this and because of that, because all you're doing, that's the blame game. And because of that, that does not justify this. &gt;&gt; It doesn't doesn't justify this movement. That might be so. Maybe they did say that. Maybe they did act that way. Maybe your husband, your wife or whatever more, your family, your children, who knows who it is, your employer, whatever your finances or your body, your sickness or whatever more. You could even say, "Why God did you allow this?" That will not suffice for making a step sideways, &gt;&gt; making a step away from the things of God. &gt;&gt; Return, &gt;&gt; I say in the name of Jesus Christ, return back to the God of our fathers. For God sent Elijah to send you back to him. &gt;&gt; And what you have here is a life. It'll all pass. It's nothing but a vapor. You got a home. I guarantee you it'll be ashes one day. &gt;&gt; You got a nice car out here. You got a bank account that's worth nothing and getting to be worth less every day. &gt;&gt; You got a secure job. God could take your health tomorrow. You wouldn't have anything. If you can't say God is my keeper, &gt;&gt; God is my God &gt;&gt; and I'm serving him with everything, all the ferveny of my soul. &gt;&gt; I say return to him in the name of Jesus Christ. We'll bow our heads. Father, you're so holy, so righteous. Your presence is so sacred. I feel unworthy, unworthy to even stand near that presence. But we are here. I am here. These people are here because we heard a voice. We are here as I've declared earlier because your angel, your angel, I know something of that angel. I've sat in the divine presence with your prophet and your servant. I've looked into eyes that reach down into my soul, down into the most inner secret parts of my soul. And Lord, you are the same God now. And I know that you have spoken. You've spoken very explicitly. And I'm praying that there will not be a man, woman, or child that shall procrastinate or put off to another day which day may never come for them. But that now, today, even now, as you not only have spoken, but are speaking, that there will be a most sincere and deep work done by the Holy Spirit of God into hearts. Oh Lord, I pray that you'll come with a sword of the spirit and cut away this world and all of its enchantments, all of its stimulants, oh God, whatever they might be. Move us from them, Father, and let us walk in the midst of this world in robes of white, untainted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Un unaffected by it. Lord, there's families here. There's parents here. And I don't know what you're going to call on them to do, but you're calling on young men and women to give themselves to give themselves so completely, so surrendered to you, Lord, that their time goes through a new adjustment. Their day has they they'll have another agenda. And oh God, help us that minister, our brother John Andy's that will be ministering tonight. Lord, I pray you'll send a flame from his mouth. And oh God, I ask that your word this morning will find its resting place into good ground. Lord, let it bring forth fruit. I don't need any credit. I don't need any accolade. I don't need any thank you. My reward will be, Lord, as I see you work in the lives of your people. And if this message thins us out, so be it. If this message increases our numbers, so be it. We're not here for popularity. We're not here to have the best or the biggest. We're here, oh God, to have a people that'll be ready. ready in that hour when you call us. When you call us, Lord, we want to hear just once more. Well done. Enter in, oh God. Well done. Enter in. I'm speaking what is so real on my own heart so often. Oh God, by your grace, by your unconditional covenant, I pray you'll exercise it upon the people today. And forgive us for our backslidings. &gt;&gt; We'll name it for what it is. Forgive us for our wewardness. And you even spoke to your own people, your own children. You asked them, "Why? Why do you turn away? Return. Return." And I pray, oh God, that that will be what takes place now. Let your word now be confirmed with the these signs following Jesus Christ in your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wonder if you're not ashamed. You're not ashamed of this gospel. And I just want those that God has spoken to very very directly and I want you to identify yourself by saying I'm I am now prepared under God to make a turnaround of repentance in my life and I do so I fear lest anyone would harden themselves against that kind of invitation. But only if God has been dealing and speaking to you as such. And you must forget about who's next to you or who's around you or what what people think of you. It's what God thinks of you. And he loves you enough to speak to you and to come to you now once again. And perhaps you'd like to stand. The only song I can think of just now, Linda, is I surrender all all to Jesus. I surrender all to Jesus. I surrender all to him. I freely. I will forever and trust you in his presence they live. I [Music] surrender all [Music] to the blessing. [Music] I surrender. [Music] &gt;&gt; All that I have, all that. Oh, [Music] all I ever [Applause] [Music] to the &gt;&gt; I wonder before we sing this song again. All that I have and you'll mean every word of it. I only would have those that would care to come forward that let me be very specific. We don't have room for everyone and you don't need to necessarily come here. But those that God has spoken to say I am not where I am in a backsliden condition. I'm before God. I am engaged in. I have drifted far from the mark. I'm not where I used to be, but I desire to be there. And I want to give I want to attest to this congregation. I want to show this congregation that I am making a a a decision under God and under this word as evidence that the Holy Spirit has spoken to me. I'm going to come and dedicate myself and give myself unreservedly to this Christ. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have a repentance in my heart. I have a godly sorrow. I want to serve him. I've been not even laxidasical. I've been wewarded in my life, oh God. And you you desire the prayers of the people and the mercy and grace of God upon your life. And if you are that one, come and stand and make that declaration. He stood openly for you and we need to stand openly for him. Confession is good for the soul. There's no way if you're going to take that kind of stand in a congregation of the believers, let it be seen right at the present, right at the right at the opening of your decision. Let it be declared. I'm here to declare it before God, before man and the world in the name of Jesus Christ. All that I have. And then I'm going to pray. There will not be another invitation. All that I have. [Applause] [Music] worthy [Music] surrender. [Music] All that I have. [Music] worthy can I go [Music] to the with everyone reverently. Father, I trust that you are pleased with what you are seeing. Some are responding, others need to. But these who willingly have come, they're making a serious admission and a serious step. Oh God, I believe they are saying with their footsteps down here. Father, you have spoken. I have heard your voice. It has tenderly called me. You have wooed me by your spirit so tenderly. You woo me and brewed over me that I might bring forth that life, that perfect reflection of Jesus Christ. Oh Lord, do it. And I am praying, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, that every obstacle in the lives of these who are standing will be removed from them. Oh God, may the fire of God come, I pray, and separate them, oh God, from every hindrance. I pray, I ask that this morning will be a morning, a decisive time, oh God. Let it be a decisive decision. Let there be nothing in heaven or the world or hell itself that can change their mind or change their thought. Come and strengthen, I pray. Strengthen the bonds, oh God. Strengthen the tie. Strengthen, oh God, the the anchor. I pray the anchor holes, oh God. We can say the anchor holes. We can say to them, cast yourself upon the Lord Jesus Christ and he will carry you through. There is nothing that can move them. Lord, let their faith, I pray, let their old unbelief depart. Let it depart in the name of Jesus Christ. I come against that demon of doubt. &gt;&gt; Let the people of God I need now. I need now your unity. Let the demon of doubt be bound in the name of Jesus Christ. And let him be cast out of the the people, the hearts that have given him place. Let him be removed in Jesus name. In the almighty name of Jesus, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Oh God, we are here, Lord, not on some kind of entertainment, but we're here to do business. We're here to see men and women chart the course towards eternal life. Oh God, let the voice, oh God, give my give me breath to cry out. Give the people hearts to believe. Let them be souls spoken to today that nothing will be able to move them from the decision they make. Let the husbands go home and say to their wives, "Honey, it's going to be different." We're setting up time around God around his word. &gt;&gt; It's going to be different. &gt;&gt; I'm going to demonstrate by the grace of God, the very life and leadership of the Holy Spirit in our home. Let the wife with dedication come and say, "It's going to be different. It's going to be different. I'm going to seek to follow the pattern of the godly women of the scriptures. to be those that are identified in Hebrews 11. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. We're a needy people. We're a needy people. We're living here in Satan's Eden. But we're living here in the most glorious age that you've ever given man to live in. You'll demonstrate your power. &gt;&gt; You'll demonstrate your power in your people. and you'll demonstrate your victory over death itself. We praise your name. We praise your name. &gt;&gt; Let's everyone stand, shall we, please? I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinner slain. Give him glory all ye people. For his blood has washed each stain. I will praise. Just give him glory and thanksgiving. Now I will [Music] sinner slave. Oh, glory on ye [Music] for his blood has washed away. &gt;&gt; Let's all in the United Way now together. Hear these words, oh Lord. Oh God. Oh God, [Music] the lamb all sinners slain. [Music] Give him glory. Glory all ye people for his blood has washed out away. The anchor holds I'm singing this not to fill in time. And the service has gone long enough. And yet with God, he's not wearied with your confession. He's not wearied with your praise. And may well be that the Holy Spirit still tenderly wooing, brooding. Son, daughter, surrender. Give up all. Give up everything. Maybe he's wooing you to set a different course. Let me say to the young couples here, it doesn't take any hero to get married and then go off and live for yourself. But it takes a real brave son and daughter of God to say, "Our home is going to be a godly home. Our home's going to be an open home. Our lives are going to be given to the service of the bride of Jesus Christ. whatever we can do for them. And that's not a works program. That's the program of Jesus Christ. He lived for others. Are you willing to do that? Are you prepared to do that? [Music] &gt;&gt; Are you prepared to do that? &gt;&gt; It's a blessed life. It's a blessed life. What have you done, Brother Bisl? Well, you kids wouldn't know it. I peeled logs to build a church. I worked on the foundation of Little Log Church when I was alone. I hired one other man who was ungodly and left at noon. Went to the beer parlor, never came back. Many of you were in that log church. [Music] wasn't just standing behind the pulpit, worked with my hands. Your prophet who brought this message worked with his hands. He climbed telephone poles. He hung on to high tension lines and power lines. And that humbles me to think that he was willing to do that. Why was he willing to do that? Cuz he had a life to live, a life of service, a life to give. Let this congregation, if it be identified for anything else, let it be a a giving, a service to the Lord Jesus Christ. Do we have a yay and an amen? God bless you. God sees that. The anchor hold the in his mat. [Music] I am all I need. Praise the Lord. [Music] Oh my [Music] god. [Music] in spite of the storms. We're just going to sing it once more and I'm going to dismiss then after we sing it once more. You do whatever God tells you to do. If you want to spend time here, just kneel and pray. Spend time in your seat. That's fine. The message is over. [Music] I this this service was uh was a meant a lot for me. I just want to take it one more step. I just want to say I'm sorry to the body cuz it's Christ's body. [Music] Years ago, brother had prayed for me up front here. He says, "A man of great faith. I haven't felt it for years. I don't feel worthy of a statement like that." And and I I haven't felt that faith in my life. I want it back. &gt;&gt; This service is for me. I take the full step. I want the body to forgive me. I want that faith. [Music] &gt;&gt; I have children here. &gt;&gt; Restore the Lord. that the Lord gave me. They're not serving him and he gave them to me. I was giving up. I was giving up. And he gave me this service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. &gt;&gt; I love you all and I love the Lord. After we've dismissed, we have brethren here, ministers, brother Tony and brother John. And if you desire prayer, you can just hold your hand and they'll come and pray with you. The anchor holds friends and the bride is coming through. She'll crest every wavel. The name of Jesus Christ in spite of the storm. [Music] Oh sh [Music] [Applause] my soul. Oh my [Music] se [Music] [Music] anor testimony. Let us be their testimony. [Music] Oh, as we march across our [Music] [Applause] [Music] face [Music] inside the soul. [Music] I'm going to close in prayer. I want to close with this statement. I would that everyone here take the service this morning with the utmost seriousness. I believe that for some God will not speak to you again this way. You want to take it with the utmost seriousness. If he's been speaking to you, I actually believe that some will never feel that pull again if you don't surrender to it this time. I've never said that in my life, but I believe that down in my soul, and I believe in before the throne of God, it will be true on that day. The spirit of God, the scripture says, "Behold, my spirit will not always strive with man." Dear Father, how merciful you are, how long-suffering. I've been so mindful of your longsuffering. But this world has perverted our thought into turning you into some dirty old grandfather as your prophet said, someone who has no principle. Someone who can be pushed any direction. That's not what you are. Your word has told us it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God. I want to fall into your loving arms, Lord. I don't want to fall in rebellion. I do not want to come and look into your eyes and know I resisted you. I turn to your side. Oh, I just thought that's some little preacher. That's some that's old brother Ed. That's his own thoughts and own ideas. Let it be known today, oh God, that it was a voice of the Holy Spirit speaking down into the very deep recesses. And that is why they even have that thought in their mind now because it is you. It is you. And the enemy would try to have them put it off. They'd like to have them slide it off and put it off on some other place. But I pray you'll bring home, oh God, bring home, I pray, to the heart, every heart, Lord, the reality of your word, the reality of your presence. &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord. And now for your faithfulness and your tender love and care for the sheep. I ask that you'll prepare us, oh God, for what else you have for us for today. And if you see fit to let us see this evening, for we know that condition of the world the way it's in, we could be gone at any moment. We could be gone at any time. And Lord, I I stand here before these people saying to you in prayer, not for our worthiness, but by your grace alone, we trust we shall stand there and hear your welcoming voice. Jesus, I commit this people to you, the words that now have been spoken. and to those that are in many places around the world just now. Lord, perhaps the saints in Switzerland, saints in New Zealand and in Europe, oh God, bless them, I pray abundantly. And if our little sister Merta is streaming, God touch and help that girl. Send somebody to be an encouragement to her. lead her, I pray, oh shepherd of the flock, I commit her to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Commit all of those that are have made a firm decision. Help them in their decision, Lord. Strengthen them in their resolve and send the Holy Spirit, I pray, to give them stamina and strength. Dismiss us now in your grace in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. We dismiss you in Jesus Christ's name. We ask you to be reverent. Those you that are leaving, just leave reverently in Jesus name. The anchor. The anchor. You're dismissed. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
