[1:58] of God. We uh
[2:01] trust that everyone appreciates this
[2:02] morning. We're in a little bit different
[2:04] setup and uh
[2:06] so the sound will sound a little
[2:08] different now that we've got the uh
[2:11] windows out of the back and we're trying
[2:13] to uh do some experimenting prior to the
[2:16] services that we have coming up for the
[2:18] convention. How many are praying Lord
[2:20] will have his way in the convention?
[2:21] Amen. Uh but we would also like you to
[2:26] appreciate that the lobby now is part of
[2:29] the sanctuary and so
[2:33] this uh will have a number of effects.
[2:35] Number one uh
[2:40] we want everyone to respect
[2:45] and govern your movement accordingly.
[2:48] Uh we don't want to have any visiting.
[2:50] What was the foyer? It's now part of the
[2:52] sanctuary. Parents, you need to keep
[2:55] your children under control. And I know
[2:56] sometimes we have children who are
[2:58] sitting away from their parents. But
[3:00] parents, you need to be aware of your
[3:01] children even if they're not with you.
[3:03] And if they move out, uh need to go to
[3:06] the washroom, uh you need to just tell,
[3:08] well, why don't you come back and sit
[3:10] with us if you can't govern yourself
[3:12] accordingly. And um so we would really
[3:16] appreciate that. And parents too with
[3:19] children. If you've got children that
[3:20] are, you know, making noise, you're
[3:23] going to have to take them out and, you
[3:25] know, you may have to stay out. I know
[3:26] sometimes there's children who, you
[3:28] know, they're not crying and they're
[3:31] just having a good time, but it's very
[3:33] distracting to the person who's next to
[3:34] you. And uh so uh just respect that and
[3:39] appreciate that while you may be trying
[3:41] to get something out of the service, so
[3:43] the so is the person next to you. And uh
[3:45] kids can be very distracting.
[3:47] Um, let's turn on the screen to number
[3:50] 618. My wonderful Lord. My wonderful
[3:53] Lord.

[16:19] There's a request for Sharon Hunter or
[16:21] Shannon Hunter with Hodkdins lymphoma.
[16:25] Also, Michael BS who has a tumor in his
[16:27] salivary gland. If you're here this
[16:30] morning, you need a touch from God, you
[16:32] just lift your hand before the Lord as
[16:33] we come before him. If you're listening
[16:35] in on the internet, on the phone, hook
[16:37] up.
[16:39] Amen. Lord's with you this morning as
[16:41] well. Will you just reach out and touch
[16:43] him as we go before him this morning.
[16:46] Amen. Brother Tom, if you'd come.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, as the song writer has
[16:52] panned,
[16:55] I was born to be a dwelling place, a
[16:58] home for the presence of the Lord.
[17:01] Father, we've gathered this resurrection
[17:02] morning in this building called
[17:04] Cloverdale Bible Way. But Lord, without
[17:07] the people of God, without the children
[17:09] of God standing here and being the true
[17:12] church of the living God, let your
[17:14] presence
[17:15] so envelop each and every life. Lord, as
[17:19] brother Rod has mentioned, these
[17:21] requests, there's many needs here this
[17:23] morning. Hands are raised and hearts are
[17:26] lifted up. We say, "Oh God, meet these
[17:28] needs. You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're
[17:32] still our provider. Lord, you've
[17:34] provided bloody skins for Adam. You've
[17:37] given us a bleeding, bloody word in this
[17:40] hour. We want to wrap ourselves within
[17:42] it. We say, God, wash us clean. Heal
[17:46] your people, Lord. And as the word of
[17:49] God shall come forth, Lord, as our
[17:52] pastor will come, let the word of God
[17:55] come with uncction. May it come with
[17:57] healing. May it come with deliverance.
[18:01] May it come, Lord God. Lifting your
[18:03] people up into heavenly places, Lord.
[18:06] That's what we've for is to dwell in
[18:09] your presence and to lift up that holy
[18:11] name. So Lord, every soul that is
[18:14] gathered, Lord, even on the internet, we
[18:16] pray that you'll minister to each and
[18:19] every one of us. And may you be
[18:21] glorified at the end of the day. May our
[18:24] hearts burn within us as this
[18:26] resurrected king will walk with us down
[18:30] this journey this morning. Speak to us
[18:32] Lord. Anoint both speaker and hearer. We
[18:37] pray in Jesus name. Amen.

[26:00] brother Jonathan.
[26:03] Um, we have a baby dedication and as
[26:05] brother Tom comes, let's sing uh number
[26:08] 753. I am so glad that our father in
[26:11] heaven.
[26:18] I am so glad that our father in heaven
[26:23] tells us his love in the book.
[26:28] Wonderful things in the Bible. I see
[26:32] this is the dearest that Jesus loves me.
[26:37] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus

[26:49] that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves even
[26:54] me.
[26:57] I am so glad that Jesus loves meus.
[27:06] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[27:12] loves
[27:14] me.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say that this morning with a
[27:19] great assurance that Jesus loves even
[27:22] me. I'm feel privileged and honored to
[27:25] be able to take this baby dedication
[27:27] this morning. It's my little
[27:29] granddaughter, Kayla Ariel Ray. Now,
[27:34] this is um I didn't have the ability to
[27:38] have girls. I just had boys. But my sons
[27:41] have been faithful to their calling and
[27:44] are bringing forth girls. And this is
[27:46] very special. Amen. Michaela who was
[27:50] like unto God feminine part of Michael
[27:53] and Ariel
[27:55] lion of God and if you want to look in
[27:57] uh in in Israel today Ariel Chiron and
[28:01] he had there was a book written of Ariel
[28:03] Chiron he's called the warrior well we
[28:05] have a little girl here this morning a
[28:07] little baby little bundle of joy middle
[28:09] name is Ariel lion of God may God give
[28:12] the boldness of a lion if God should tar
[28:16] and I just trust that God will just put
[28:18] his hand of approval on this little
[28:20] jewel.
[28:21] She has quite a heritage. She has a
[28:24] daddy here that loves the Lord. She has
[28:26] a mommy that's dedicated to Christ.
[28:30] A daddy that knows the Lord. And Brother
[28:33] Bram said, you know, that perfect little
[28:35] family and oneness of God, he said,
[28:36] standing in his presence where the daddy
[28:39] is in his place, the mother's in her
[28:40] place, and the children standing there.
[28:43] Oh, he said, isn't that a blessed sight?
[28:45] standing in harmony in his presence. And
[28:49] as I was thinking of Michael and
[28:50] Abigail, I was thinking of that little
[28:52] family coming in the Garden of Eden once
[28:55] again. And may father come down and
[28:58] grant to them their need. But in
[29:00] thinking of this baby dedication, I was
[29:05] moved to look to a scripture in Exodus
[29:08] 12 where Moses was to speak unto the
[29:11] congregation of Israel, saying, "In the
[29:13] 10th day of the month, they shall take
[29:15] to them every man a lamb according to
[29:18] the house of their fathers, a lamb
[29:22] for a house." And that's a
[29:24] responsibility, Michael, that you're to
[29:27] carry. God has blessed your home with
[29:30] two children, a a wonderful wife that we
[29:34] could also take the lamb, not something
[29:36] of 4,000 some years ago, but a a lamb of
[29:40] God this hour, a lamb for a house. And
[29:44] that blood shall be unto you a token
[29:47] where you are. And when I see the blood,
[29:50] I'll pass over you.
[29:52] and the plague shall not be unto you to
[29:55] destroy you when I smite the land of
[29:58] Egypt." And we believe the judgment
[30:00] angel has come down and is going
[30:02] throughout the land. But because of a a
[30:05] daddy that has known God has applied the
[30:08] lamb for his house, the death angel will
[30:11] pass and this little child will be
[30:13] cradled in in the arms of a mommy and
[30:15] daddy that love the Lord. He said in the
[30:18] token message, "Flee for safety. Apply
[30:21] it and believe. Here's what you want to
[30:24] do. Believe for your safety. Then apply
[30:28] the token for your whole family. See,
[30:31] claim it. It worked on you.
[30:35] Then you and the word becomes one and
[30:38] it's going to work for your family.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the presence of God
[30:45] so overshadow this little jewel,
[30:48] Michaela Ariel Ray. and may his presence
[30:51] ever guide her down life's road. Many
[30:55] people dedicate or would I would say
[30:58] offer their children to the gods of
[30:59] pleasure, the gods of sports, gods of
[31:03] music, gods of leadya.
[31:06] But a little family has come this
[31:08] morning to dedicate their little girl to
[31:10] the presence of God and to give him the
[31:13] glory in this life.
[31:18] All
[31:24] right, let's pray.
[31:30] Lord, with great joy
[31:32] I cradle within my arms the gift of God
[31:35] you've blessed his home with.
[31:38] Lord, as Michael has applied the token
[31:41] in his life, Abigail within her life,
[31:43] you've blessed their home. Lord, with
[31:46] children and now this morning, I'm
[31:48] cradling in my arms Michaela Ariel. I
[31:52] pray, Lord, that your blessing will ever
[31:54] rest upon this child. That Father, one
[31:57] that could be like unto God. Lord,
[31:59] that's our cry to be like Jesus, to be
[32:02] like you, author and finish of our
[32:04] faith. Keep your hand on this child,
[32:07] Lord. And if time should Terry give her
[32:09] the boldness of a lion to stand for this
[32:11] one that we love and adore, you've

[32:28] of Jesus Christ for your glory. Amen.
[32:34] Amen, sweetheart.
[32:50] It's good to have our brother Wes Ardel
[32:52] here with us this morning. And brother
[32:53] Wes is going to come and bless us with a
[32:55] song along with a choir. And as they're
[32:57] coming, let's sing together. So I'm

[35:15] [Music]
[35:23] [Music]
[35:31] [Music]
[35:41] [Music]
[35:43] I've seen a vision
[35:46] harsh and sweet
[35:50] of one who gave all he had for me.
[35:56] I felt the passion
[35:59] of his death
[36:03] and the forgiveness
[36:05] of his final breath.
[36:09] Now I can never
[36:12] be the same.
[36:16] My heart has been forever
[36:20] changed.
[36:22] I want to live and love and give the way
[36:29] he gave.
[36:35] Now I'm giving my life away.
[36:43] laying it down on the altar.
[36:48] Now I'm giving my life away.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; The very least I can offer
[37:01] is my own.
[37:04] [Music]
[37:07] So here I stand today,
[37:12] giving my life away.
[37:18] [Music]
[37:21] No earthly price could be too great.
[37:27] No sacrifice
[37:29] too much to make.
[37:33] No way of measuring
[37:37] the cost
[37:40] next to the blood of Calary's cross. Oh,
[37:45] so if I live, I live for him.
[37:52] Or if I die, I can.
[37:57] [Applause]
[37:58] My life is not my own. But he from this
[38:05] day on.
[38:08] This day on
[38:11] now.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Giving my life away.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Laying it down on the
[38:22] &gt;&gt; on the altar. Now I'm giving my life.
[38:27] Oh, is that your desire this morning?
[38:30] Oh, the very least I can offer
[38:36] is my own.
[38:42] So here I stand today,
[38:46] giving my life away.
[38:54] Now I'm giving my life away.
[39:01] Oh,
[39:03] laying it down on the altar.
[39:08] Now I'm giving my life away.
[39:15] Oh, the very least I can offer
[39:20] is my own.
[39:24] [Music]
[39:26] So here I stand today,
[39:31] giving my life away.
[39:37] Oh, now I'm giving my life away.
[39:44] Oh, holding
[39:47] it down on the altar.
[39:50] Now I'm giving my life home away.
[39:58] The very least I can offer
[40:03] is my own.
[40:06] [Music]
[40:09] So here I stand today
[40:13] giving my life away.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; So here I stand
[40:24] today
[40:28] giving my life
[40:32] away.
[40:34] [Music]
[40:45] Thanks, brother West. Choir,
[40:48] man. We don't want to hold anything back
[40:50] this morning. Give everything we have to

[42:03] All
[42:06] the one
[42:17] almighty
[42:21] God.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful day in his
[42:29] presence as I listened to uh Wes and the
[42:33] young people sing. I couldn't help but
[42:36] have uh just a I I I had a if I had a
[42:40] wish that could come true instantly. I
[42:44] would like to have been the ages the age
[42:47] of one of them. I'd like to be about 18,
[42:50] 19, 20 and be able to start all over
[42:53] again. just want to have another life.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Burn it up for God. And I pray that each
[43:00] one of those young people that were
[43:01] singing that it will have a new reality
[43:04] to them. I'm laying my life down. I'm
[43:08] giving it all up.
[43:11] Amen. Isn't that the desire of everyone?
[43:14] I just love to see uh don't only love to
[43:17] hear it, but I love to see it. Love to
[43:19] see it in action. Just laying it down.
[43:24] We'll be having a good opportunity of of
[43:26] giving giving out of our uh especially
[43:30] of our time and our energy and the
[43:34] convention that's upcoming because uh I
[43:38] I would like to ask as I have already on
[43:41] the last Sunday I believe I would like
[43:45] the congregation to take it very
[43:47] seriously that we want to be uh a people
[43:50] given to hospitality.
[43:53] Uh we have not had a convention like
[43:55] this for about 10 years. We don't know
[43:57] when the next one if ever because we're
[44:00] counting on a homegoing.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's one of the reasons of
[44:05] even having a gathering like this
[44:08] because we intend to have a homegoing.
[44:10] We want this to be something that moves
[44:12] the body of Christ, the bride of Christ
[44:15] in that direction. And so we think of
[44:18] those which the scripture has said and
[44:20] lays a good deal of responsibility on
[44:23] the leaders uh bishop uh must be given
[44:27] to hospitality.
[44:29] But I think also of the house of
[44:32] Stefanis or Stephanas, however they
[44:35] pronounce it, but the Bible says they
[44:37] had addicted themselves to the ministry
[44:40] of the saints. And so anyone can addict
[44:43] themselves to the ministry of the
[44:45] saints. So we want to encourage you to
[44:47] be uh to take that uh to take that to
[44:52] heart as well. And then I would like to
[44:54] say also because there's going to be a
[44:57] lot of ministers wives that are here and
[45:00] some of you sisters will be mingling
[45:02] with them and some will have more
[45:04] contact than others. Uh but I find that
[45:07] if you are going to have friends, you
[45:10] also must show yourself friendly and uh
[45:13] make yourself available.
[45:16] Uh I want to encourage the uh the
[45:20] congregation
[45:21] and to the sisters when you have a
[45:23] gathering there sometime you may feel a
[45:26] wee bit at loose ends when there's
[45:29] perhaps not a man there or your husband
[45:31] there because he may be engaged with
[45:34] other things. But you can keep the
[45:36] conversation spiritual. And by that I
[45:39] don't mean, you know, attempting to be
[45:41] super spiritual, but you can keep this
[45:44] conversation
[45:46] uh spiritual. You can keep it up from
[45:48] just the natural chatter of all kinds of
[45:51] natural things. And I find one of the
[45:54] best ways, I'm just going to give you
[45:55] just a wee bit of help here. One of the
[45:58] best ways to keep a conversation
[46:00] spiritual, whether it's a ga a gathering
[46:03] around men, a gathering around the
[46:05] ministers, or gathering of the sisters
[46:08] just together in in fellowship or around
[46:10] a table. And that is to ask one of the
[46:14] visiting
[46:16] sisters or brothers, ask, "How did you
[46:19] come to the knowledge of the message?
[46:22] How did your candle get lit?" And I
[46:25] never fail to be so blessed when I hear
[46:28] that. And the accounts, the stories, the
[46:31] the witness, the testimonies are
[46:34] absolutely incredible. And it's one of
[46:36] the best ways to find out how God dealt.
[46:39] I mean, when you hear a testimony,
[46:41] you're actually hearing how God Almighty
[46:45] reached into some foreign land or some
[46:47] place that's foreign to you, not foreign
[46:49] to them. That's their home. and find out
[46:51] how God dealt with them, how God brought
[46:54] came across their pathway and you'll
[46:56] find right away the presence of the Lord
[46:58] will be there and it's just a special
[47:00] time. Amen. And in saying that, I'll
[47:04] give you a second piece of advice. Be a
[47:06] good listener.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Be a good listener. Sometimes we feel,
[47:12] well, we've got so much to say, but oh,
[47:14] I think our lives are enriched when we
[47:17] are a good listener and we hear how God
[47:19] dealt with someone else. And then
[47:23] lastly,
[47:24] seek to be a blessing
[47:27] and seek to receive a blessing. And if
[47:30] we just keep these simple things in
[47:32] place, uh I believe it will be a a great
[47:35] time. Um there are many that are working
[47:38] hard and we we can't even begin to name
[47:40] them. Just all kinds of people are
[47:44] working hard to uh to do what they can
[47:48] do and uh many of you will be called on
[47:52] to to help to participate in some way.
[47:55] You might feel it's very small and
[47:57] insignificant but it's not. It takes it
[48:00] all and it takes all of us to uh do to
[48:04] make it what I believe God wants it to
[48:06] be. And uh uh some of the those I know
[48:11] that uh brother Tony and brother Derek
[48:14] and brother Ernie, they're working very
[48:17] hard because we are able to uh make a
[48:22] real statement as far as what has been
[48:24] happening in Bible believers and the
[48:27] missions. There's so much that happens
[48:29] on a daily basis that you're just not
[48:32] able to have enough time to tell you
[48:35] what is taking place and the
[48:37] testimonies. But we want you to rejoice
[48:39] in that as well. And we want to be able
[48:42] to let others from other congregations
[48:44] know. Uh I had two phone calls just I
[48:48] had a email and a phone call uh
[48:51] yesterday and the phone call was from
[48:54] brother Dan Daisley. I want the church
[48:57] to uh remember to pray for brother Dan.
[49:01] He had heart surgery just a short time
[49:03] ago. I believe he said it was five
[49:05] weeks. Doesn't seem that long, but he's
[49:08] had a very slow recovery. He doesn't
[49:11] have much use of his arms at this time.
[49:14] He said, and and when he told me that he
[49:17] wouldn't be able to come to the
[49:19] meetings, he actually broke down and and
[49:22] cried. He just was so sad that he
[49:25] wouldn't be able to be here to the
[49:26] meetings. And then they have special
[49:28] meetings uh coming up in in August. And
[49:33] uh it may be that brother Tony will be
[49:35] there with some of the brothers that are
[49:36] coming here. We're just not too sure how
[49:39] that is all going to work out yet. But
[49:42] uh I asked him how he was going to be
[49:45] handling his meeting and and they are
[49:48] still going ahead with it. And brother
[49:50] Harold Hillbrand is going to be their
[49:51] speaker this year. So we are uh we want
[49:56] to be remembering brother Dan. I mean I
[49:58] just uh my heart was touched very very
[50:00] deep when he just wanted to be here so
[50:03] bad. Brother William Ryerson in Norway
[50:06] had planned right up to just a few days
[50:09] ago to come. He's not strong enough. He
[50:11] also had surgery, open heart surgery and
[50:14] not able to come. He's ministering in
[50:16] his own church in Norway, but he won't
[50:19] be able to be here. So, they both wanted
[50:21] to be remembered to you. And then last
[50:25] but not least, I would like to ask you
[50:28] please
[50:30] and this this goes for everyone because
[50:34] everyone can pray. I'd like you to bathe
[50:38] literally bathe and cradle these
[50:40] meetings in prayer.
[50:42] for the song leaders, for the musicians,
[50:46] for the people that are sound and the
[50:49] video people, the streaming, the
[50:52] deacons, the trustees,
[50:55] especially the ministers, the ministry,
[50:58] and if you'll pray for myself, we I
[51:01] really solicit an earnest interest in
[51:04] your prayers. and just get under the
[51:06] burden of prayer if you would please
[51:08] because we need such divine guidance
[51:10] from moment to moment and we appreciate
[51:13] you. I appreciate you. Appreciate that
[51:14] you're here today. You see also we've
[51:17] taken the windows out of the uh of the
[51:21] sanctuary part. So we have literally
[51:24] extended the sanctuary. The sanctuary is
[51:27] out in the foyer now. So we don't want
[51:29] you to treat the foyer as a foyer.
[51:32] There's to be no visiting there.
[51:34] and and those with children and so on,
[51:37] if you need to take them out, you'll
[51:39] take them out to the children's room or
[51:42] into the fellowship room. And uh we just
[51:45] want to keep the whole area sacred. I
[51:47] believe that'll be pleasing to God,
[51:49] wouldn't you? Amen. So, having said
[51:52] that, I'll have you stand and we'll
[51:55] sing. We are standing on holy ground and
[51:58] we'll be turning to the word. Um turning
[52:02] to the book of uh Jeremiah the 29th
[52:06] chapter.
[52:10] We are standing
[52:13] [Music]
[52:16] on holy
[52:18] ground
[52:19] [Music]
[52:21] through me and I know that there are
[52:27] angels
[52:30] all around.
[52:35] Let us pray. Jesus
[52:41] [Music]
[52:47] we are standing
[52:50] in his presence.
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Let's have our sisters sing it please.
[53:01] We are standing.
[53:09] [Music]
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[53:14] And I know that there are angels
[53:21] all around.
[53:26] Let us pray.
[53:32] Jesus.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; We worship our
[53:43] presence.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; All of the brothers thou please.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; We are standing
[53:56] on holy
[53:58] ground.
[54:02] And I know that there are angels
[54:09] all around.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Let us praise
[54:20] our Jesus.
[54:26] We are standing in his presence on holy
[54:33] ground. this once for everyone. Now
[54:38] we are
[54:40] [Music]
[54:43] on
[54:45] ground
[54:53] [Music]
[54:56] all around.
[55:01] Let us pray.
[55:07] Jesus.
[55:09] [Music]
[55:13] We are standing
[55:16] in his presence on holy
[55:21] ground.
[55:25] Our Lord Jesus, we're here to worship
[55:27] you. We're here to praise and to give
[55:30] you glory. We magnify your name.
[55:34] We are here to glorify that name. And I
[55:36] pray that all that is said and done,
[55:39] Lord, will be to the glory of the name
[55:42] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Almighty God,
[55:45] God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of
[55:47] Jacob, I pray that you'll manifest
[55:50] yourself, make yourself known, and I
[55:54] pray that you will be the one that will
[55:57] do the supernatural. For man, we do not
[56:01] rest upon the arms of the arms of flesh.
[56:04] Man's strength fails. Man's wisdom
[56:09] departs. But Lord, the word of God shall
[56:12] last forever. And we pray today you'll
[56:15] make your word known. Pray that you'll
[56:18] anoint both hearers and the speaker. And
[56:21] we hide ourselves, oh God, in the shadow
[56:25] of the cross and behind that great
[56:27] sacrifice without which we are nothing.
[56:31] And so we pray, Lord, you will take this
[56:33] audience of people and those that are
[56:37] streaming at this moment and part of the
[56:39] service. Bless them, I pray, permeate
[56:42] the atmosphere in the name of Jesus
[56:45] Christ and penetrate every heart and
[56:47] mind. I pray, oh God, you will bind the
[56:50] enemy and hinder him from having any
[56:54] effect upon the service. And may your
[56:56] will, perfect will be done in Jesus
[57:00] Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[57:05] Thank you. We'll turn to the Bible now
[57:08] and read from Jeremiah the 29th chapter,
[57:13] starting at verse 8.
[57:19] down to verse 14.
[57:24] For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God
[57:27] of Israel, let not your prophets and
[57:29] your divers that be in your midst be in
[57:32] the midst of you deceive you, neither
[57:35] hearken to your to your dreams which ye
[57:39] have cause which you cause to be
[57:42] dreamed. For they prophesy falsely unto
[57:45] you in my name, I have not sent them,
[57:47] sayeth the Lord. For thus sayeth the
[57:50] Lord, that after 70 years be
[57:52] accomplished at Babylon, I will visit
[57:55] you, and
[57:59] perform my good word toward you, in
[58:04] causing you to return to this place. For
[58:07] I know the thoughts that I think toward
[58:09] you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace
[58:13] and not of evil, to give you an expected
[58:16] end. Then shall ye call upon me, and you
[58:21] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[58:23] hearken unto you, and you shall seek me,
[58:27] and find me, when you shall search for
[58:30] me with all your heart, and I will be
[58:33] found of you, sayeth the Lord. and I
[58:37] will turn away your captivity, and I
[58:40] will gather you from all the nations and
[58:42] from all the places whether I have
[58:44] driven you, said the Lord, and I will
[58:47] bring you again into the place whence I
[58:50] caused you to be carried away captive.
[58:52] Amen. You may be seated.
[58:58] I'd appreciate and we'll need your
[59:01] undivided attention if you stay just as
[59:05] focused as you can mentally on what is
[59:07] being said. Sometimes when you lose just
[59:10] a sentence, you don't pick it up. You
[59:13] don't get the thought for some time. So,
[59:15] we just want to really give ourselves
[59:17] now to the word. I'd like to give just a
[59:20] wee bit of background. uh on Wednesday I
[59:24] spoke on applying the token and that uh
[59:27] applying the token is the is the
[59:30] application of a lived out life
[59:34] and as brother Tom used a quote that I
[59:36] used Wednesday night for your own safety
[59:39] first and then you apply it to others
[59:42] which especially related to the family
[59:46] in the scripture but you are applying it
[59:49] to others for an eternal benefit and
[59:52] that the applying of the token is
[59:55] actually an action word. It is an
[59:58] activity. It's something that we are uh
[1:00:02] we are responsible to do. And I believe
[1:00:04] especially as fathers, mothers, parents,
[1:00:08] uh we are responsible to do that. and
[1:00:10] then also for one another as far as uh
[1:00:13] brothers and sisters in Christ. I
[1:00:15] believe that we are responsible to have
[1:00:17] a positive effect upon each other's
[1:00:20] life. Now the background
[1:00:23] to this scripture that we are reading
[1:00:26] today, it has to do if we were to go
[1:00:29] back and we won't have the time to do
[1:00:31] so, but if I was reading and in my
[1:00:34] studies, we go back and review the
[1:00:36] earlier chapters in uh Jeremiah. And
[1:00:41] this scripture which we read just now is
[1:00:44] the text that brother Brandham spoke in
[1:00:46] the message desperation which was the
[1:00:49] next service after the token. So about
[1:00:53] half of this service of uh half of the
[1:00:55] service of the of desperation that he
[1:00:58] spoke was actually carried over right
[1:01:00] from the token because he is he's saying
[1:01:04] and if you were to read the token which
[1:01:07] also is the scripture brother Tom used
[1:01:10] in the dedication of his grandchildren
[1:01:12] the the token was taken and the uh the
[1:01:18] blood was applied in a desperate power.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; There was great desperation that night.
[1:01:25] And so, it's not something they were
[1:01:27] just doing casually. It wasn't a
[1:01:29] tradition because they had never done it
[1:01:31] before. This was the first time. And
[1:01:34] this was to escape the judgment of God
[1:01:37] that was going to fall upon an entire
[1:01:39] nation, which incidentally was a
[1:01:41] superpower at that time. So we can just
[1:01:44] relate to it if it were America the
[1:01:47] superpower or some other superpowers
[1:01:51] which are not the superpower but it
[1:01:54] Egypt was the superpower at that time
[1:01:57] and judgment was falling upon them and
[1:01:59] God uh God was giving the token that
[1:02:02] they might escape it. Now
[1:02:06] so that was the text for the desperation
[1:02:10] which was spoken the very next day. So I
[1:02:12] will be uh tying together some things
[1:02:15] which will relate back to Wednesday's
[1:02:18] service a wee bit but the background
[1:02:21] here were and that's why the scripture
[1:02:24] uh God is speaking in the scripture that
[1:02:27] the the people are not to hear these
[1:02:30] prophets which were false prophets there
[1:02:32] were false prophets and divers and so
[1:02:34] on. So that that that was part of the
[1:02:37] background. If you were to read chapters
[1:02:38] 27 28 uh then you would find out that
[1:02:42] there was a false prophet. I'm going to
[1:02:44] refer to it just now that prophesied but
[1:02:47] they prophesied very good things. So the
[1:02:50] people were given over to hear those
[1:02:53] prophets because the prophecy sounded so
[1:02:56] good. And uh God had spoke through
[1:03:00] Jeremiah that Israel would be taken
[1:03:02] captive and would be captive in Babylon
[1:03:06] for 70 years. Now not all of the people
[1:03:09] were taken into Babylon. But uh they
[1:03:12] were nevertheless they were controlled
[1:03:14] and taken under captivity by
[1:03:16] Nebuchadnezzar which was king of
[1:03:18] Babylon. And then there was this prophet
[1:03:20] called Haniah. And Haniah is referred to
[1:03:24] brother Brandon refers to him many
[1:03:26] times. And he prophesied and his
[1:03:29] prophecy was this. Haniah the son of
[1:03:33] Azor the prophet which was of Guehon
[1:03:37] spake uh unto me in the house of the
[1:03:40] Lord. So now here's Haniah speaking to
[1:03:43] Jeremiah in the house of the Lord in the
[1:03:46] presence of the priests and all of the
[1:03:48] people.
[1:03:50] And this is what he said. Thus speaketh
[1:03:53] the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
[1:03:56] saying, I have broken the yoke of the
[1:03:59] king of Babylon. And within two full
[1:04:02] years will I bring again into this place
[1:04:06] all of the vessels of the Lord because
[1:04:08] the vessels had been taken out of the
[1:04:10] house of God and carried into Babylon.
[1:04:12] And of course, a great desecration was
[1:04:15] taking place. And so Haniah was
[1:04:17] prophesying, here's one prophet saying
[1:04:20] that you're going to go into captivity.
[1:04:21] you're going to be in Babylon 70 years.
[1:04:23] Here's another one. rises up and says,
[1:04:25] "Thus sayaeth the Lord, in the presence
[1:04:27] of all the priests and the presence of
[1:04:29] all the people that in within two full
[1:04:32] years I'm going to bring everyone back
[1:04:34] and I'm going to restore all the vessels
[1:04:36] of the Lord and I'll bring them back
[1:04:38] into this house and Nebuchadnezzar king
[1:04:41] of Babylon that that the king had taken
[1:04:43] out of this place into Babylon and I
[1:04:46] will bring again to this place Econiah
[1:04:49] the son of Jim, king of Judah, and all
[1:04:53] the captives of Judah.
[1:04:54] that went into Babylon, sayith the Lord,
[1:04:57] for I will break the yoke of the king of
[1:05:00] Babylon. Even the prophet Jeremiah said,
[1:05:04] "Amen."
[1:05:07] Said, "That sounds good." Jeremiah said,
[1:05:09] "Amen." Amen.
[1:05:11] And uh that's what the scripture says.
[1:05:13] And Jeremiah said, "Amen. The Lord do
[1:05:16] so. The Lord performed thy words which
[1:05:18] thou hast prophesied to bring again the
[1:05:21] vessels of the Lord's house and all that
[1:05:24] is carried away captive from Babylon
[1:05:26] into this place
[1:05:30] in the message influence. Brother
[1:05:31] Brandham said and Jeremiah had a yoke
[1:05:33] around his neck which he did. He had a
[1:05:35] yoke upon his neck. And God had told him
[1:05:39] no matter what prophet prophesies, what
[1:05:41] dreamer dreams or anything else contrary
[1:05:44] to what he said that contrary to what
[1:05:47] God had said, it was wrong. And there
[1:05:50] stood up Haniah just as sincere as any
[1:05:52] man could be and prophesied with a
[1:05:54] message, thus saith the Lord. Well, he
[1:05:58] said, 'Well, of course, the people could
[1:06:01] clap their hands and they rejoice and
[1:06:03] they probably would today. They get
[1:06:06] excited over this one and clap their
[1:06:08] hands. He says, "And Haniah saying
[1:06:11] they'll be back in two years in the
[1:06:13] sight of two full years and he walked up
[1:06:15] to the vindicated prophet, which he did.
[1:06:17] He walked up to Jeremiah, took the yolk
[1:06:19] off his neck, and he broke it." said,
[1:06:22] "Thus sayaith the Lord, going to break
[1:06:24] the yoke uh that that uh Nebuchadnezzar
[1:06:28] has upon Israel. We're going to break
[1:06:30] it." And remember what Jeremiah said to
[1:06:33] Haniah said, "Haniah, amen. So be it.
[1:06:36] The Lord performed your words. But let
[1:06:39] us remember, there has been prophets
[1:06:41] before us. There have been prophets
[1:06:43] before you and me.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And they prophesied against great
[1:06:47] kingdoms, against war, and so forth. But
[1:06:51] a prophet is only known when his
[1:06:53] prophecy comes to pass.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; We've had all kinds of preaching and all
[1:06:59] kinds of prophecies and all kinds of
[1:07:01] negative things or positive things.
[1:07:04] Regardless of what it is, either way,
[1:07:06] it's irrelevant unless it comes to pass.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why I have confidence
[1:07:11] in this message even this morning which
[1:07:15] I won't say anything about but we were
[1:07:17] speaking in the study and how things
[1:07:20] that this prophet spoke which when he
[1:07:23] said it seemed impossible
[1:07:26] it would the human mind would say I'll
[1:07:28] never see that I'll never witness that
[1:07:31] and here it is happening in the last few
[1:07:33] days right amongst us in our own city I
[1:07:36] can tell you my brothers and sisters not
[1:07:39] that you don't know it, but that you
[1:07:41] will just be reconfirmed that when a
[1:07:43] prophet is only known when his prophecy
[1:07:46] comes to pass, when he speaks and it's
[1:07:49] then, thus sayeth the Lord, not because
[1:07:51] I say so, not because you say so,
[1:07:53] because God does it.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; God does it. This is not a battle of the
[1:07:58] words. This is not a struggle of words,
[1:08:00] friends. God's word comes to pass. God's
[1:08:04] word materializes.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; It literally materializes. It's a word,
[1:08:08] but it becomes material. It becomes
[1:08:11] substance,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; whether it be a healing or a deliverance
[1:08:14] or whatever more.
[1:08:16] And then Jeremiah, he spoke again and he
[1:08:19] said, then said the prophet Jeremiah
[1:08:23] unto Haniah the prophet, "Hear now,
[1:08:24] Haniah,
[1:08:26] the Lord hath not sent thee." He just
[1:08:30] said amen to his prophecy. But he says,
[1:08:33] "The truth is God hasn't sent you, but
[1:08:36] thou makest this people to trust in a
[1:08:38] lie."
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; That's what's really sad. It is sad that
[1:08:42] someone prophesies a falsehood. But it
[1:08:46] is it's very much compounded when people
[1:08:50] believe it and trust in it and go
[1:08:53] headlong into it and find themselves
[1:08:55] into bondage. How many people have
[1:08:58] trusted the denominational system and
[1:09:00] look where it has taken them?
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, thus said the Lord,
[1:09:10] behold, I will cast thee from off the
[1:09:12] face of the earth. This year, thou shalt
[1:09:16] die because thou hast taught rebellion
[1:09:19] against the Lord." And even though God
[1:09:22] allowed Nebuchadnezzar to take the
[1:09:24] people captive, even though all of that
[1:09:27] had happened, it seemed like a very
[1:09:28] negative thing, but because they had
[1:09:30] they had gone into idolatry and God
[1:09:32] allowed that. And I'll tell you, my
[1:09:35] friends this morning that it's important
[1:09:36] that we keep our focus and that God is
[1:09:39] our God. Materialism isn't our God. A
[1:09:43] good life isn't our God.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; None of those things are our God. But we
[1:09:48] can make anything a god. But we're not
[1:09:50] making anything by God's grace. We don't
[1:09:53] want to make our job, our family, our
[1:09:55] work or material things or anything else
[1:09:57] or pleasure. We have one God and that is
[1:10:01] the true and living God. We must serve
[1:10:03] him with everything that is within us.
[1:10:06] Now although Nebuchadnezzar had taken
[1:10:10] Israel captive and had carried all the
[1:10:12] holy vessels out of Babylon and they
[1:10:16] became desecrated in that country. Yet
[1:10:19] God did not intend that the people would
[1:10:23] lose their inheritance. He wanted them
[1:10:25] to maintain their inheritance.
[1:10:30] in the Smyrnian church age says when
[1:10:33] Israel entered into unlawful alliances
[1:10:36] with the world and formed fellowships by
[1:10:39] marriage, the day finally came when the
[1:10:42] world took over and Babylon carried them
[1:10:46] away, carried the people away into
[1:10:49] captivity. Now, here's I want I have
[1:10:52] this highlighted for you. Now when they
[1:10:54] went into captivity, they went they went
[1:10:58] in having a priesthood,
[1:11:00] a temple, and the word.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; But when they came back, they had
[1:11:06] rabbis,
[1:11:08] a theological order of Pharisees, a
[1:11:11] synagogue, and the Talmud.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; So they went in with a priesthood, came
[1:11:18] up with rabbis. They went in having had
[1:11:21] a temple. Now they come back
[1:11:25] with uh synagogues
[1:11:27] which they needed. And when Jesus came
[1:11:31] they were so corrupt that he called them
[1:11:34] of their father the devil. And this in
[1:11:37] spite of the fact that they were
[1:11:39] Abrahams according to the flesh. In this
[1:11:42] age
[1:11:44] we see the same thing happening.
[1:11:47] However,
[1:11:48] as all Israel is not Israel, but a
[1:11:52] little group where the true spiritual
[1:11:55] Israelites, so there would always be a
[1:11:58] little group of true Christians, the
[1:12:01] bride of Christ until he come for his
[1:12:04] own.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; There will be a little group,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; true believers.
[1:12:13] So Jeremiah said this which we read and
[1:12:16] I now need to read it because now I want
[1:12:18] to start breaking into the subject. Thus
[1:12:21] sayith the Lord after 70 years be
[1:12:24] accomplished at Babylon. This is how you
[1:12:27] went in. This is what's happened. You've
[1:12:28] gone into captivity. False prophets has
[1:12:31] rise. Dreamers have dreamed all kinds of
[1:12:33] things. The people got a whole myriad of
[1:12:35] voices and all kinds of opinions. But
[1:12:38] now God's voice, God's voice and
[1:12:41] mouthpiece speaks again through his
[1:12:42] prophet. I will after 70 years are
[1:12:46] established, I will visit you.
[1:12:49] And I'm going to just give you some
[1:12:53] phrases that I want you to remember. If
[1:12:55] you're want to jot them down will be
[1:12:57] fine. Also, I will visit you
[1:13:03] and will perform my good word toward you
[1:13:06] in causing you to return to this place.
[1:13:10] Especially now verse 11, for I, God's
[1:13:14] speaking, I know the thoughts. No one
[1:13:18] else knows them, but I know the thoughts
[1:13:21] that I think toward you, sayeth the
[1:13:25] Lord. thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:13:31] to give you.
[1:13:33] This is the purpose of God's thoughts
[1:13:35] that he was thinking towards the people
[1:13:37] to give you an expected end. I'm going
[1:13:41] to dissect that down in a few moments.
[1:13:44] And it is marvelous. Absolutely
[1:13:46] marvelous. And then now here's God
[1:13:49] speaking. You will be 70 years,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; but I will visit you
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; because I know the thoughts that I have
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; towards you
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; and their thoughts of peace are not of
[1:14:02] evil to bring you to an expected end.
[1:14:07] And then the scripture says then you
[1:14:10] know when I preach, when I read, when I
[1:14:12] study, I often I I will make a great
[1:14:16] emphasis for myself and that's why I
[1:14:18] make emphasis to you. When you find the
[1:14:20] word then you need to really find out
[1:14:23] what was said prior to that. Now God is
[1:14:26] rehearsing what I said about 70 years of
[1:14:30] captivity that is still in place. I'm
[1:14:33] not changing my mind about that. That's
[1:14:35] the conditions that we're in. We have
[1:14:37] certain conditions in this age. I I wish
[1:14:40] that I I'm glad we're living in this age
[1:14:44] because God has ordained us for this
[1:14:45] age. But this age is a corrupt age. This
[1:14:48] age is a dishonest age. This age is a
[1:14:52] whirly. It's a infested with
[1:14:54] uncleanness. It's a vile and vulgar age.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed of my own community when I
[1:15:01] pick up a little local rag newspaper and
[1:15:05] find that high school girls are dragging
[1:15:08] uh teenage boys. Oh, you might smile and
[1:15:10] say, "Well, you know, they they've done
[1:15:13] that or they did that in my high
[1:15:14] school." I think it's a disgrace going
[1:15:17] and dragging young fellows and dragging
[1:15:20] them through the school and being just
[1:15:22] absolutely uh uh full of rebellion. And
[1:15:26] the teachers teachers
[1:15:28] that should be respected. Tell them we
[1:15:31] don't want this to happen. And they
[1:15:33] curse them out with the vilest of
[1:15:36] language. Vulgar, vulgar language.
[1:15:39] Teenagers, they ought to be taken by
[1:15:42] their parents and spanked.
[1:15:45] You say, "Well, that's against the law."
[1:15:47] It's not against this law.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; They ought to learn some respect
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; using a vulgar language. This has
[1:15:56] happened in the last few days. And I I'm
[1:15:59] I'm I feel a sense of disgrace within
[1:16:02] myself that I have to be associated with
[1:16:05] this kind of a thing in my community, in
[1:16:08] schools that are being supported by your
[1:16:10] taxes and my taxes. and then this kind
[1:16:13] of thing is allowed and they not able to
[1:16:15] control it and taking young fellas and
[1:16:17] and dragging their clothes off of them.
[1:16:20] It's a disgrace.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Absolute disgrace. That's the age that
[1:16:24] we're in. And we can't just, you know,
[1:16:26] kind of uh ease it off and say, "Well,
[1:16:29] you know, nothing we can do about it."
[1:16:31] Well, at least we have a testimony
[1:16:33] that's in opposition to that kind of a
[1:16:35] thing. And we don't only live it, but we
[1:16:38] speak it. We declare it. And we we we're
[1:16:40] thankful for the message that we have.
[1:16:43] I'm thankful for the young men and young
[1:16:45] women that we have. I'm thankful for the
[1:16:47] children that we have. We need to give
[1:16:48] them all the support that we can and
[1:16:51] say, "God bless you, young men. God
[1:16:53] bless you, young ladies. God bless the
[1:16:56] teachers. God bless
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; those that would live godly."
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, this is the age. It's a
[1:17:04] dark age. The light goes out.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Leodysia.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Wait. And but but God nevertheless and
[1:17:11] Leoa sent a prophet, sent a message and
[1:17:15] the message couldn't change. He had to
[1:17:17] go back to this. It was exactly like
[1:17:20] when John the Baptist came and and
[1:17:22] introducing Jesus Christ, they couldn't
[1:17:24] even recognize the word.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; They had drifted so far from it. The
[1:17:29] Jewish people had drifted so far. And in
[1:17:31] 2,000 years of the greatest some of the
[1:17:34] greatest ministries and the media and
[1:17:36] the printed page and all these things
[1:17:38] printed page for over 500 years and
[1:17:41] radios and telephones and a printed page
[1:17:44] and magazines and and tape recorders and
[1:17:48] all of these things and still it goes
[1:17:50] downhill,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; straight downhill.
[1:17:54] Even in the last hundred years when you
[1:17:57] see the kind of movement and spiritual
[1:17:59] movement that has been and that's a
[1:18:01] paradox with all of this uh tools at our
[1:18:05] disposal. Why is it going downhill?
[1:18:08] Because the scripture says it would.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Any other reason you'd think it would
[1:18:14] increase and and things would improve
[1:18:17] and spiritually improve, but it seems
[1:18:20] like all the anchors have been let go.
[1:18:22] And I can assure you because it's
[1:18:24] already been spoken, there's all kinds
[1:18:26] of Hananas that are saying it's better.
[1:18:29] Things are better. I can tell you that's
[1:18:31] not what the word of God says. The word
[1:18:33] of God says through the lips of Jesus,
[1:18:35] when when the son of man returns, shall
[1:18:37] he find faith on the earth.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "Not just
[1:18:42] faith as we know faith, but the faith
[1:18:45] the faith of God in the word of God
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; shall he find faith on the earth.
[1:18:54] Not great multitudes of revival. That's
[1:18:57] not what he said is going to happen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Saying you got some great sweep of
[1:19:04] hundreds of thousands of people being
[1:19:06] swept into the kingdom of God. That's
[1:19:08] not what the scripture says. Says few
[1:19:12] there be that enter in. Strive to enter
[1:19:16] in. I tried to come to Wednesday.
[1:19:19] Strive. That's a that's an act of
[1:19:21] desperation.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; That's not just sitting back, ho ho,
[1:19:25] it'll happen if it's supposed to happen
[1:19:27] or it won't if it's not. That's not the
[1:19:29] scripture. You can't find it in the
[1:19:31] scripture. When it came to the Passover,
[1:19:33] it was a moment of urgency. It was a
[1:19:36] moment of desperation. They were doing
[1:19:38] something for the first time they hadn't
[1:19:40] done before, but they had to do it. And
[1:19:41] they had to do it with a staff in the
[1:19:43] hand and shoes on their feet and ready
[1:19:46] to move on out. And that's the way we
[1:19:48] need to be as believers. I'm doing
[1:19:50] everything I can. This is the gospel of
[1:19:52] the hour that God has given us. A
[1:19:54] vindicated voice. And I'm I'm going to
[1:19:56] have my shoes on my feet, my staff in my
[1:19:59] hand. I'm going to influence everybody I
[1:20:02] can around me. I'm going to clean up
[1:20:05] house.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to clean up my life.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to move the things
[1:20:10] out that must not be here. Why? Because
[1:20:13] it's an hour of desperation.
[1:20:22] He says,
[1:20:23] "And I'm going to visit you."
[1:20:29] I have a little clip.
[1:20:32] I wasn't going to play it. It's going to
[1:20:33] take a few minutes.
[1:20:36] I just felt
[1:20:40] that maybe some needed to hear this.
[1:20:43] This is actually brother Brandham's
[1:20:44] voice in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And before you
[1:20:48] hear it, he's got people. He has just
[1:20:52] preached to the people. And the message
[1:20:54] he has preached is, "Is there anything
[1:20:57] too hard for the Lord?"
[1:21:00] And he was he he he was talking about
[1:21:03] the visitation.
[1:21:05] And I'm at that point just now with a
[1:21:07] message that has God visited us? Has God
[1:21:11] visited this generation? Because God
[1:21:13] said to Jeremiah, "Now after this
[1:21:15] bondage, I will visit you."
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; God didn't just We say, "Oh, God's here
[1:21:22] all the time." But there are times that
[1:21:24] he has chosen throughout the history of
[1:21:26] man where he visited in a very special
[1:21:29] way. He says to Abraham concerning
[1:21:33] Sarah, "I will visit her." And when he
[1:21:36] visited her, she she she had life. She
[1:21:40] conceived conceived life. That was an
[1:21:42] individual and one child come forth.
[1:21:45] Then he said to Moses. Now he had a
[1:21:48] whole nation.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; But he said to Moses, "I will visit you.
[1:21:53] I will visit them." And because of his
[1:21:55] visitation, a whole nation came out of a
[1:21:58] nation.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; And he prophesied he would visit us. He
[1:22:03] visited us in a special way through
[1:22:06] Jesus Christ in his first coming to
[1:22:09] purchase a people at Calvary. And then
[1:22:12] he prophesied in the end time before
[1:22:15] judgment comes. I'll visit that
[1:22:17] generation again. I will reestablish
[1:22:21] that it's God that I am God of this
[1:22:23] word. I am God of Israel and I have
[1:22:27] redeemed a people out of the Gentiles
[1:22:29] and I'm going to come and take them
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; in a rapture. I'm going to catch them
[1:22:35] away.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to defeat death.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I bought it at Calvary. I'm going to
[1:22:40] take a people. They're going to be
[1:22:42] changed in their bodies while I stand on
[1:22:45] the earth. I'm going to take them out of
[1:22:47] this dark evil age.
[1:22:51] And the token evidence of that was
[1:22:54] healing. So he sends a messenger in the
[1:22:57] end time with that gift of healing. Not
[1:23:01] just a gift of healing. Calls people
[1:23:03] out. They're sitting in the audience in
[1:23:07] Tulsa, Oklahoma. And now you'll just
[1:23:09] hear it. Please uh brother Michael if we
[1:23:12] can just have that
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; you pray in your heart and believe God
[1:23:21] say God I'm a child of Abraham and I
[1:23:24] believe with all my heart and let the
[1:23:26] Holy Spirit come and perform here
[1:23:28] tonight as he did down there. Will all
[1:23:31] of you believe on him with all your
[1:23:33] heart?
[1:23:37] Let's just on the piano ever who is the
[1:23:39] pianist there if you will sing the great
[1:23:41] it just play slowly the great position
[1:23:43] now is near if you will while we just
[1:23:45] pray now this is spiritual
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; I remember some time ago
[1:24:00] that was playing Fort Wayne Indiana
[1:24:02] something happened. A dunkered girl
[1:24:07] who didn't have the Holy Ghost. She got
[1:24:10] filled with the spirit and jumped up
[1:24:11] from the piano and run away. About 5,000
[1:24:14] people sitting there seeing that piano
[1:24:16] continually playing. The great physician
[1:24:18] now is near. People just raising up
[1:24:20] everywhere being healed. As much a bunch
[1:24:22] of Amish and dunkers,
[1:24:25] Fort Wayne, the sympathizing Jesus.
[1:24:33] I'm going to look at my brethren back
[1:24:35] here. You pray.
[1:24:39] Brethren,
[1:24:43] we're all going to meet someday in the
[1:24:45] land beyond.
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:51] We'll have to give an account for our
[1:24:53] ministries, what we do with Jesus all
[1:24:57] time.
[1:24:59] We teach our people that he's the same
[1:25:00] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; You believe that, don't you, brother?
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:12] now just a moment. There's someone to my
[1:25:16] extreme right praying.
[1:25:20] It's a man,
[1:25:22] and he's praying because he's in a
[1:25:24] serious condition. He's suffering from a
[1:25:28] like a bladder trouble.
[1:25:32] He's got tumor.
[1:25:34] He's had an operation.
[1:25:38] And if he's up for another operation,
[1:25:41] that's a man sitting right there with
[1:25:43] his hand up.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; That's true. If that's true, stand on
[1:25:46] your feet. If we're strangers one
[1:25:49] another, wave your hand.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the same angel of God is
[1:25:53] in the building?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[1:25:58] Except what did you touch, sir? You were
[1:26:02] praying, wasn't you, for your healing?
[1:26:05] Well, then if me standing here, my back
[1:26:07] turned to you, that same angel that
[1:26:10] declared this that Sodom that Jesus said
[1:26:12] would be here in the last days just
[1:26:14] before he's coming, then folks, he's on
[1:26:16] his road here. He's coming. That's
[1:26:18] right.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[1:26:27] Now, sitting close to him,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; right behind him is a woman.
[1:26:35] She's got trouble with her side and she
[1:26:36] has headaches.
[1:26:42] Mrs. Arnold, if you believe with all
[1:26:45] your heart.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I do not know you. Is that right, lady?
[1:26:52] We're strangers to one another. Is that
[1:26:54] your name? Is that your condition? You
[1:26:56] were praying, wasn't you? You touched
[1:26:58] something.
[1:27:06] The man sitting right back there with
[1:27:07] high blood pressure. If you will
[1:27:09] believe, sir, we accept it as your
[1:27:12] healing. You do. Look at me gayheaded.
[1:27:14] Sure. Rinse. You can believe with all
[1:27:17] your heart. Do you, sir? All right. Then
[1:27:19] the blood pressure will leave you. I
[1:27:21] don't know him. Never seen him in my
[1:27:22] life. Is that right, sir? Raise up your
[1:27:24] hand. If we're strangers to one another,
[1:27:26] what are them people touching? And in
[1:27:29] the midst of this all, I feel doubt
[1:27:30] moving in.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? God, being merciful.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is your thus sayeth the
[1:27:46] Lord.
[1:27:49] I see before me a woman. She's holding a
[1:27:54] water-headed baby.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; The baby has had surgery. Got water on
[1:27:59] the brain. She's sitting right down here
[1:28:02] holding the baby. You know who I'm
[1:28:05] talking to? Mrs. Jagger. Stand up and
[1:28:07] believe for the baby.
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:18] You believe on the Lord?
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:24] If thou can't believe, how about over in
[1:28:27] this section here? So what you'll see if
[1:28:29] this is in one section, you believe over
[1:28:31] here. Do you believe it?
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:44] A lady sitting here high blood pressure.
[1:28:48] If you'll believe, lady.
[1:28:51] Uh, Lord, who is she?
[1:28:54] Mrs. Bar Ly Barley. Believe with all
[1:28:57] your heart and you shall have your
[1:28:59] healing also. You believe it?
[1:29:06] What about this woman laying down here
[1:29:07] on this cop stretcher? Look over this
[1:29:10] way, lady. You have a prayer card? I
[1:29:12] guess you don't. Well, I don't think I
[1:29:14] don't forgot to tell you about prayer
[1:29:16] cards. I guess none of you don't have no
[1:29:18] prayer card. I can't heal you, lady. But
[1:29:21] do you believe if God can tell me what's
[1:29:22] your trouble, will you accept it? You're
[1:29:24] going to die laying there. That's one
[1:29:26] thing. Sure. You got an overflued body.
[1:29:29] That's fluid and everything backing up
[1:29:31] on you. Is that That's the truth, isn't
[1:29:32] it? Now, I never seen you in my life.
[1:29:34] This is the first time. And if you'll
[1:29:36] believe it with all your heart and don't
[1:29:37] doubt that fluid will leave you and you
[1:29:39] go home, be well.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe? Do you believe the angel
[1:29:44] of the Lord's here?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you believers raise up your
[1:29:48] hand?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Well, now lay your hands on one another.
[1:29:52] Put your hands on one another if you're
[1:29:54] believers.
[1:29:56] Oh, God. Holy Spirit that's present, the
[1:30:00] angel that was promised that Jesus said
[1:30:04] would be here as it was in the days of
[1:30:06] Sodom. Lord God, make Satan to leave
[1:30:10] this people. I hold on before you and
[1:30:12] zealous of them. Come out of that group,
[1:30:14] Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ. Move
[1:30:17] away from those people and be dispelled
[1:30:20] from this building and Jesus Christ take
[1:30:24] glory and power forever.
[1:30:26] Now, if you believe with all your heart,
[1:30:28] believe that he heals you. The Bible
[1:30:31] said these That's right, lady. Get right
[1:30:32] up off that cot and go on home. That's
[1:30:35] you believe. Stand up on your feet then
[1:30:38] everywhere except Jesus. The angel of
[1:30:40] the Lord is here. I pronounce the
[1:30:44] healing blessings and the power of the
[1:30:46] almighty God into your hands.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Or can you deny that?
[1:30:55] I say to us, this congregation,
[1:30:59] God has visited this generation.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That happened thousands of times.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Thousands of times. Even to one woman's
[1:31:08] name, he couldn't say, so he spelled it
[1:31:10] out first
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and said it. I see a woman behind.
[1:31:13] There's a man behind me standing there
[1:31:15] speaking to two auditoriums as it were.
[1:31:18] God visited this generation. I'd like to
[1:31:20] say to our American friends,
[1:31:24] there isn't one nation. There is a
[1:31:25] nation, then there's another nation. We
[1:31:27] are Canadians on this side of the
[1:31:28] border. Many of you here are Americans.
[1:31:31] As American, you have a great
[1:31:35] responsibility because God is going to
[1:31:37] hold you accountable for this ministry.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; God did not send it to Canada. God did
[1:31:44] not send it to England or to Germany. He
[1:31:48] sent it to America. And that is why
[1:31:52] America is the superpower today.
[1:31:55] Not because anything that the people
[1:31:57] did. It was the blessing of almighty
[1:31:59] God. And that has largely happened in
[1:32:02] just the last hundred years because you
[1:32:04] came from all corners of the earth. And
[1:32:06] God is going to hold that nation
[1:32:08] responsible for what they have done with
[1:32:10] that gift. He even said one place, if
[1:32:13] they on a national level had accepted
[1:32:15] this gift, they would have needed a
[1:32:17] hospital in the country. And one of the
[1:32:19] things that's crushing the economy right
[1:32:21] now, not only there, but in many places
[1:32:23] of the world, happens to be the health
[1:32:25] and the medical system. I'm not here to
[1:32:27] preach about politics, but you know that
[1:32:29] that is the truth. And God has said in
[1:32:32] his word that that was what was going to
[1:32:33] be at this end time. And here we are.
[1:32:36] And I only played that uh seven minutes
[1:32:39] to say to you and to confirm to you
[1:32:42] rather than me read it. Isn't it better
[1:32:44] that you hear his voice and that I can
[1:32:46] just say to you authoritatively, God
[1:32:49] visited this generation?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; God visited you people in India, brother
[1:32:54] Titus. God visited you mightily in
[1:32:57] Bombay with this ministry. God visited
[1:33:00] you that are here from South Africa,
[1:33:03] Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth.
[1:33:05] God visited that nation in incredible
[1:33:08] until there were truckloads and the
[1:33:10] deputy mayor of Durban calling brother
[1:33:12] Brennham to the window look out the
[1:33:14] window as seven truckloads with big rack
[1:33:16] truckloads loaded with stretchers and
[1:33:19] every kind of device for walking and
[1:33:22] braces and all kinds of things loaded
[1:33:25] wheelchairs and everything and and a
[1:33:27] complaint from the hospital they can't
[1:33:29] keep the people in the hospital because
[1:33:31] they were ordering ambulances I got the
[1:33:33] pictures in my office ambulances lined
[1:33:35] up people going out and and going in and
[1:33:38] they said, "You're going to die if you
[1:33:39] leave here." He says, "I'm going to die
[1:33:41] if I stay here."
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the kind of
[1:33:44] desperation that God honors.
[1:33:47] When a person gets a hold of the word of
[1:33:48] God and says God's not only working in
[1:33:51] the past or back in Moses' day or
[1:33:53] Abraham's day, that same God has not
[1:33:56] diminished one iota today.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; It is that we become self, we become
[1:34:02] like self-satisfied. We got so many
[1:34:04] things that you know to relieve your
[1:34:06] pain today and to help you along that
[1:34:08] kills our faith and destroys it. But we
[1:34:11] want to have our confidence in the word
[1:34:13] of God.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; So God visited Abraham. God visited
[1:34:19] Sarah. God visited Moses. God visited
[1:34:21] Israel. God visited when our Lord Jesus
[1:34:25] came and God visited in our time. And
[1:34:28] God said to Abraham to rather to
[1:34:31] Jeremiah and I'm coming to this now. He
[1:34:33] said I know the thoughts that I think
[1:34:37] toward you. Let me say this congregation
[1:34:40] only God knows those thoughts
[1:34:44] and only God can make them known
[1:34:48] and God has his chosen way of making
[1:34:51] them known. And I can tell you it's not
[1:34:53] through a seminary.
[1:34:56] you trust. If you're here and you trust
[1:34:57] in a seminary, you're trusting in a
[1:34:59] failing system.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; It's not just through an order of men, a
[1:35:04] priesthood
[1:35:06] or a organization
[1:35:10] or individuals. You may say, "Well, what
[1:35:12] do you think you're doing?" If I echo
[1:35:15] anything other than what God has sent in
[1:35:17] this day, God, this what you just heard,
[1:35:20] that's God's vindication. How does a man
[1:35:23] stand over with a seventh grade Kentucky
[1:35:24] education and call a woman out of the
[1:35:26] audience Joerger? Another one Arnold.
[1:35:30] Another one spell her name. How does a
[1:35:32] man do that? You say, "Oh, that's some
[1:35:34] kind of mental."
[1:35:37] If anybody would think that, I say, "God
[1:35:39] forgive you. That'd be close to
[1:35:41] blasphemy." That's none other than the
[1:35:43] Holy Spirit visiting this generation,
[1:35:46] trying to get through our hardened
[1:35:49] hearts. And I pray that he'll turn our
[1:35:51] hearts from stone, turn them from stone
[1:35:54] to flesh to receive the word and then to
[1:35:57] find that that mouthpiece God begins to
[1:36:00] use because God every time he confirmed
[1:36:02] a prophet in a generation or to a
[1:36:05] people, he would send him with the
[1:36:06] necessary signs that should have turned
[1:36:09] the people's hearts back to the word of
[1:36:11] God. And then he would declare the same
[1:36:13] word,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; say the same thing. And now comes the
[1:36:18] messenger saying, "No, I don't want to
[1:36:20] do that." That was my first pull. That
[1:36:23] was the second pull. It pulled people.
[1:36:25] It drew people out of every
[1:36:26] organization. Drew people, attracted
[1:36:29] them this great great sign. But now the
[1:36:32] sign had a voice behind it.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; A voice behind it. And the voice came so
[1:36:40] that God, listen to me, could make known
[1:36:43] his thoughts
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; when he came to the end of all of this
[1:36:49] captivity and all of this trouble and
[1:36:51] all this slavery in Babylon. And not all
[1:36:53] of it was slavery. They had a good life.
[1:36:55] Many of them in Babylon. Many of them
[1:36:57] established businesses. Many of them
[1:36:58] stayed there. Even after the captivity
[1:37:01] was over, they stayed in Babylon. And
[1:37:03] they didn't even know the Hebrew
[1:37:04] language. That's why they had Pharisees
[1:37:07] which were answer people. They would
[1:37:09] answer the questions that the people had
[1:37:11] because they had newfound problems which
[1:37:13] they had discovered while they are
[1:37:15] living in Babylon prospering much like
[1:37:18] it is today. Don't let prosperity have
[1:37:21] you settled down. That won't that will
[1:37:23] never satisfy the thirst that's in your
[1:37:26] soul.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And so when God was now ready to bring
[1:37:30] them out, he had a further word that he
[1:37:32] had not said. He had had said earlier,
[1:37:34] you're going to be there 70 years. But
[1:37:36] now when he reconfirmed it after the
[1:37:38] false prophets were were out of the way
[1:37:41] and proven to be false as they have been
[1:37:43] today
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; tell you that it was an apple in the
[1:37:49] Garden of Eden. I say false prophet.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Since someone comes up and says, "Oh, it
[1:37:55] wasn't an apple. It was an apricot."
[1:37:57] False prophet.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, there isn't one God. There's three
[1:38:01] gods. false prophet.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; You can't find it in the Bible. I am
[1:38:08] one, said God to Israel. Was he lying or
[1:38:11] was he telling the truth? That's the
[1:38:12] truth.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Don't get me onto that subject.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; After the false prophecy, God confirms
[1:38:22] the true. Then he said, then he said
[1:38:24] something new.
[1:38:27] I
[1:38:28] I will make known my thoughts.
[1:38:32] I have thoughts concerning them.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; What'd he say?
[1:38:40] Thus sayith the Lord, I know I know the
[1:38:44] thoughts
[1:38:46] that I think toward you, sayith the
[1:38:48] Lord. Thoughts of peace.
[1:38:51] I said God only knows those thoughts.
[1:38:54] And those thoughts are
[1:38:56] the plan.
[1:38:58] God and God know alone knows the plan.
[1:39:02] What are the thoughts? The thoughts are
[1:39:04] the purpose. The plan and the purpose.
[1:39:08] God is saying I know the plan.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; He's saying I know the purpose.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He's the one who knows that.
[1:39:19] And it is to make judgment to make a a
[1:39:22] decisive judgment that that is false.
[1:39:25] That is true. That is correct. This is
[1:39:28] not only God can do that. I know the
[1:39:32] thought. I know where the judgment
[1:39:34] should be.
[1:39:35] And so he has to send his his his
[1:39:37] prophet has to send a prophet who's that
[1:39:40] can never come through a human mind.
[1:39:42] That has to come through a mind. Isn't
[1:39:44] it a discernment? Even people who did
[1:39:46] not know what their sickness was, he's
[1:39:48] telling them what their sickness is. Oh
[1:39:50] my, I wish you could have been in the
[1:39:51] meetings I've been in. I wish you could
[1:39:53] have seen the things. I even prayed this
[1:39:55] morning. Oh God, if I could have a a
[1:39:57] wish, if I could have a a prayer that
[1:40:00] would come to pass. I would so love if
[1:40:02] this congregation could taste of one of
[1:40:04] those meetings and have that prophet
[1:40:06] messenger stand here and call your name
[1:40:09] and tell you your address and tell you
[1:40:12] perhaps your disease or your sickness
[1:40:14] that sometimes the people didn't even
[1:40:16] know it was there. I'd love to have him
[1:40:18] stand here and tell you I see you you
[1:40:21] were at a you were at a doctor last week
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; and he was speaking actually there was
[1:40:27] two doctors and I hear them conversing
[1:40:30] between themselves and they want to
[1:40:32] remove an organ out of your body and
[1:40:35] that organ is a spleen.
[1:40:38] How specific can you get? How could that
[1:40:41] person doubt it? I tell you what, I
[1:40:44] don't care how quiet, how formal, what
[1:40:45] your religion is. If I had that said to
[1:40:48] me, I would rise to my feet and say, "I
[1:40:51] accept it.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; I accept this kind of voice. I accept
[1:40:55] this kind of wisdom. I accept this kind
[1:40:58] of plan.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the people are like. I
[1:41:01] don't care. Oh, well, they're considered
[1:41:03] a cult. So be it.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; They're following a man. So be it.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; They're following a dead man. Since when
[1:41:10] is a prophet? Since when has a believer
[1:41:12] die? Be a dead man?" Apostle Paul. If
[1:41:15] you're a Christian, you have to believe
[1:41:17] the Apostle Paul. He said, "If this body
[1:41:19] be dissolved, we have another."
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Not we will. We have it. Apostle Paul
[1:41:26] said that if this body's dissolved, and
[1:41:29] many bodies have been dissolved. You've
[1:41:30] said goodbye to your friends, to your
[1:41:33] loved ones. And if they're a believer,
[1:41:35] they have another body.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul says it, and the prophet of
[1:41:39] this day confirms it, saying it's a
[1:41:41] theophony.
[1:41:42] Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts I think about you. I
[1:41:46] know the plan. God knows the plan. He
[1:41:49] had to make it known. I know the
[1:41:51] purpose. Only God knows the purpose.
[1:41:52] Here, you and I, we stumble through life
[1:41:54] and we wonder, "What's the purpose of
[1:41:56] God in this? What what's the plan of
[1:41:58] God? Has God got a plan? My my life
[1:42:00] doesn't seem to be going the way I tried
[1:42:02] to organize it." God, you have to hear
[1:42:04] from God's purpose.
[1:42:08] He said in Corinthians and rather in
[1:42:10] Romans, for who hath known the mind of
[1:42:13] the Lord or who hath been his counselor
[1:42:16] who knows his thoughts,
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; God alone knows his thoughts and he
[1:42:20] doesn't raise up he doesn't raise up
[1:42:22] just a five-fold ministry for that. He
[1:42:24] raised up a prophet and the prophet
[1:42:26] gives the word of God and the five-fold
[1:42:28] ministries to catch that word and bring
[1:42:30] it to the people. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Apostle Apostle Paul said in
[1:42:35] Corinthians, "But God hath revealed them
[1:42:37] unto us by his spirit, for the Spirit
[1:42:39] searchth all things, yay, the deep
[1:42:42] things of God. For what man knoweth the
[1:42:45] things of man? For what man knoweth the
[1:42:48] things of man, save the spirit of man
[1:42:50] that is in him? Even so the things of
[1:42:53] God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
[1:42:56] God."
[1:42:58] God said, "I know my thoughts
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; that I have towards them."
[1:43:03] And when God will make his thoughts
[1:43:05] known, and that's why I come now to this
[1:43:06] word. When God makes his thoughts known,
[1:43:10] he said, "Then
[1:43:14] you shall call
[1:43:17] upon me, and I will hearken unto you."
[1:43:22] When you have come to know what the
[1:43:23] thoughts of God are concerning the age
[1:43:26] that you're in, concerning the time that
[1:43:28] you're in, what God's decisive decision
[1:43:30] is about the the world, the condition of
[1:43:33] the world,
[1:43:35] when you discover God's plan and God's
[1:43:38] program in this j age, then you call
[1:43:43] upon him
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; and he says, "I will hearken."
[1:43:48] Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "And you shall seek me
[1:43:54] and you'll find me."
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that some good news?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; But the word seek is not
[1:44:03] over your food or just 10 seconds while
[1:44:05] you kneel at your bed at night. Say,
[1:44:07] "Lord Jesus, I'm so tired tonight. Just
[1:44:09] remember me and help me. I got this
[1:44:10] problem today." and jump into bed or
[1:44:12] just over the food. And no,
[1:44:16] you lose something valuable.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; You lose something that's absolutely
[1:44:21] priceless.
[1:44:24] Just priceless. You say, "I can't lose
[1:44:26] this. This is impossible.
[1:44:29] Who did it? Who had it last? Where was
[1:44:31] it last?" It's training your brain.
[1:44:33] You're thinking, "Where was it? Where
[1:44:34] did I lay it down? Where was it?" You're
[1:44:36] tearing up the cushions off of the sofa.
[1:44:38] You're going through the house. Sweep
[1:44:40] the place out. Vacuum the place out. See
[1:44:43] what you can do. Find it. Is it in the
[1:44:44] car? Take out the seats. Everything.
[1:44:46] What are you doing? You're searching
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; for something. We're not searching for
[1:44:51] some little material thing. We're
[1:44:53] searching after the living God.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; What is your plan?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; What is your program? What is it you're
[1:45:00] trying to say to us?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; What is it you're speaking to my heart?
[1:45:04] What would you have me to do?
[1:45:07] And he might be laying his finger on
[1:45:09] something just now. That's why I said
[1:45:11] cleaning house. You might have found
[1:45:13] something. Say, well, you know, I've
[1:45:15] been getting this kind of circular. I've
[1:45:17] been getting this kind of magazine been
[1:45:18] getting it just keeps coming month after
[1:45:20] month or whatever more maybe some kind
[1:45:23] of conversation or some kind of
[1:45:24] relationship you have and God's laying
[1:45:26] his finger on it. Now, don't don't have
[1:45:29] to have him scream.
[1:45:32] Don't have to have him take some
[1:45:34] desperate steps. Brother Brandham says
[1:45:36] in desperation it's it's too bad. He
[1:45:38] said that sometime we need something
[1:45:41] some crisis to come and how many times I
[1:45:44] get a phone call and we've even had it
[1:45:47] recently and soon as I get a crisis
[1:45:49] phone call I I always hope I pray I hope
[1:45:53] that they're on good terms. It's not the
[1:45:56] preacher. It's the person that has to be
[1:45:58] on good speaking terms with God.
[1:46:01] I like when Peter, the angel of God came
[1:46:04] to Peter and said, "Go to the house of
[1:46:06] Cornelius and they came into the house
[1:46:08] of Cornelius." The angel that had come
[1:46:10] to Cornelius said, "Thine arms and thy
[1:46:14] prayers have come up before God."
[1:46:18] Cornelius wasn't coming in some
[1:46:20] desperation. Oh God, oh God, I'm coming
[1:46:22] to some realization. An angel comes to
[1:46:25] him says, "Your prayers, hallelujah,
[1:46:28] they'd been coming up to before God and
[1:46:30] his arms, his giving, his liberality, a
[1:46:33] Roman.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Not even one under the promise, a
[1:46:39] Roman." And God sends one of his
[1:46:42] apostles to him, "Your prayers have been
[1:46:45] heard. Your prayers and your giving in
[1:46:48] your arms have come up before God for
[1:46:50] remembrance.
[1:46:54] We don't want to wait for an hour of
[1:46:56] desperation.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, pastor, pray. Call on us.
[1:46:59] We're in a great desperation." What were
[1:47:02] you doing before the desperation? Were
[1:47:05] you faithful to the house of God? Were
[1:47:07] you faithful to the work of God? Were
[1:47:10] you were you given over to to sacrifice
[1:47:12] of your life? And and and
[1:47:15] is you understand what I'm saying?
[1:47:19] Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Well, you're saying, you might be
[1:47:21] asking, uh, should we not call when
[1:47:23] we're in emergency? Yes, of course. Of
[1:47:25] course, I'm not saying that. What I am
[1:47:28] giving you the counsel? Stay in good
[1:47:30] terms with God. Stay in a talking terms
[1:47:32] with him. Speak to him on a daily basis.
[1:47:36] Have this friendship and this
[1:47:37] relationship with him. And when the hour
[1:47:39] of crisis comes, you can look up while
[1:47:41] you're asking others for prayer. You can
[1:47:43] look up and say, "Oh God,
[1:47:46] I've walked with you to the best of my
[1:47:49] knowledge and the best of my ability,
[1:47:51] and I'm in this crisis. Help me now."
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? I will hear you.
[1:48:04] said, "You shall seek me and find me
[1:48:07] when when you shall search for me with
[1:48:12] all of your heart.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; All of it.
[1:48:22] All of it. young people, young men,
[1:48:25] strong strapping bodies. It's not what
[1:48:28] your your profession is going to be.
[1:48:30] That's not first.
[1:48:34] That's important, but that's not first.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; How much you're going to make and your
[1:48:39] salary, that's not first.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; God is first with all your heart
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; to search for him. Search for him.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Talk to him all the time.
[1:48:54] is that
[1:48:55] when we meet on the other side and I
[1:48:57] trust by God's grace I will be there to
[1:48:59] greet you also
[1:49:01] and I trust that you'll be there to
[1:49:02] greet the other saints and myself I want
[1:49:06] to be there by his grace
[1:49:08] and I I try to examine myself every day
[1:49:13] every single day I can I believe I can
[1:49:15] honestly say not a day goes by I don't
[1:49:18] seek to examine myself brother Brandham
[1:49:22] even said and And he quoted from Apostle
[1:49:23] Paul, "Lest le I believe it's in in uh
[1:49:26] desperation also, lest after I have
[1:49:29] preached I I be a cast away." Not that
[1:49:32] he was doubting, not that he was
[1:49:34] thinking that predestination wasn't in
[1:49:36] place, but he's considering his his life
[1:49:38] and his devotion to the cause of Christ.
[1:49:41] Well, I must hurry along because I've
[1:49:43] got I've got some things I've got to say
[1:49:45] today before I before I close.
[1:49:48] And God said, "The thoughts that I think
[1:49:50] toward you
[1:49:56] in a future home
[1:49:58] said, "If there be one among you who's a
[1:50:00] prophet, I the Lord will speak to him.
[1:50:03] And if what he says happens, then that's
[1:50:06] me." Because he's not expressing his
[1:50:08] own. He's expressing my thoughts, my
[1:50:11] attributes. And so I believe that this
[1:50:13] congregation re accepts and acknowledges
[1:50:17] very readily that the voice we've heard
[1:50:19] calling people's names and so on. The
[1:50:21] purpose of that was to make his thoughts
[1:50:24] known to you on a personal level. You
[1:50:28] might say, "Oh, it' be so wonderful if
[1:50:29] you'd hear and and and and reveal my
[1:50:32] problem, my difficulty, the difficulty
[1:50:34] we have in our home or in our family or
[1:50:36] in my life. or if if he would just
[1:50:38] reveal and touch his finger, put his
[1:50:39] finger on this thing that I've struggled
[1:50:41] with all my life and it would be gone in
[1:50:43] a moment. That God is here now. All you
[1:50:47] have to do is believe the word that has
[1:50:48] been sent and that same thing will take
[1:50:51] place in this service.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; God's not a God who holds his folds his
[1:50:56] hands and say, "Well, now I just leave
[1:50:57] you to yourself, you people that have
[1:50:59] believed the message that I sent." No.
[1:51:00] the God who attended the message. The
[1:51:03] God who made his thoughts known. He made
[1:51:05] it known to us. And I'm going to go over
[1:51:07] some of those thoughts that he's made
[1:51:09] known.
[1:51:10] Who else? When else I don't care what
[1:51:13] church you come from, what minister you
[1:51:15] had, what priest you had, what rabbi you
[1:51:18] had, who told you that you are the
[1:51:21] virgin
[1:51:23] born
[1:51:25] bride of Jesus Christ? Whoever told you
[1:51:28] that your sins are so forgotten that God
[1:51:32] cannot remember them, that they have
[1:51:34] been confessed and dropped into the
[1:51:36] bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:51:39] even God himself can't find them.
[1:51:41] Whoever told you that
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; listen friends, that's not just what
[1:51:45] somebody said trying to be positive.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; They've to they've said that so that you
[1:51:50] would be guiltree,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; rid of all guilt.
[1:51:56] That's not just a positive message. That
[1:51:59] is thus sayith the Lord.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; The thoughts that I think toward you
[1:52:11] said in the Smian church age, listen
[1:52:13] this very closely. He God that is was
[1:52:17] known only as eternal spirit. the bride.
[1:52:22] And if you can identify with that, the
[1:52:24] bride
[1:52:26] was already in his mind.
[1:52:29] Yes, she was. She was existing in his
[1:52:33] thoughts.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That's not something we believe in a in
[1:52:37] a pre-existence. But you were existing
[1:52:39] in his thoughts. And what about those
[1:52:42] thoughts of God? They are eternal,
[1:52:45] aren't they?
[1:52:48] You are existing in the thoughts of God.
[1:52:50] Can God lose a thought? Can you say ah I
[1:52:55] thought of this. I thought that it will
[1:52:57] be a certain way and I will call this
[1:52:59] individual. In fact is here's some of
[1:53:02] the thoughts of God as you were the
[1:53:05] prophet speaking as you were in the gene
[1:53:08] of your father. There's no mistake you
[1:53:11] were in the gene of your father because
[1:53:12] you're here.
[1:53:16] You've got DNA that comes down and you
[1:53:19] got your own DNA that's so unique to
[1:53:21] yourself there's no one in earth has it
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; but you are in the gene of your father
[1:53:27] and a prophet now saying so likewise
[1:53:30] were you in the gene of your heavenly
[1:53:33] father and he says further you have only
[1:53:35] come down into the flesh to be tempted
[1:53:39] to be tempted and this is what he says
[1:53:41] after the word has been tried died.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; You came here not to be a carpenter or a
[1:53:48] brick layer or a housewife or just a
[1:53:50] mother. That's all part of it. That's
[1:53:52] not why you came. God sent you here. If
[1:53:56] you're a son and daughter of God, God
[1:53:58] sent you here to express a part of his
[1:54:02] word in this generation. And that part
[1:54:06] is his own attributes.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; It's his own attribute. And how can God
[1:54:11] lose his own attribute? He cannot lose
[1:54:14] his own attribute. He cannot lose. You
[1:54:17] say that God almighty, creator of
[1:54:18] heavens and earth, somehow is going to
[1:54:20] be overcome by Satan, by Lucifer and and
[1:54:23] and is going to lose some of his
[1:54:25] attributes. Never.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; I say never.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? Do you believe that?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; But who told you? When did your minister
[1:54:35] tell you? When did your priest tell you?
[1:54:37] When did your rabbi tell you? When did
[1:54:40] your pastor whoever before you came to
[1:54:42] this message, whoever told you that you
[1:54:45] were a gene in your heavenly father and
[1:54:48] you came out of his loins here to
[1:54:51] manifest a part of himself. Oh, what a
[1:54:53] high calling. No wonder this should be a
[1:54:56] desperation set within our heart. May I
[1:54:58] so perfectly, may I so accurately
[1:55:01] express that part of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:08] And he says this,
[1:55:10] "These thoughts are thoughts of peace.
[1:55:13] They're not thoughts of evil."
[1:55:16] And when he said thoughts of peace, at
[1:55:17] which we know the word real well,
[1:55:20] shalom.
[1:55:21] These are thoughts of shalom.
[1:55:25] And shalom is, in case you heard it many
[1:55:28] times, but do not know what it is in
[1:55:30] Hebrew. Shalom. These are thoughts of
[1:55:32] completeness.
[1:55:34] I know the thoughts that I thought about
[1:55:36] you. And when I thought about you, I
[1:55:39] thought of completion.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I thought of seeing you complete.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't see you in want and in need and
[1:55:46] spiritually deprived. When I think of
[1:55:48] you, he said, I think of you being
[1:55:51] complete.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Complete friends, fulfilled, not only in
[1:56:00] this life, but complete. I can't be
[1:56:02] complete unless I'm completely on the
[1:56:04] other side.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; When I think of you, I think of
[1:56:09] completeness.
[1:56:13] Beautiful friends.
[1:56:15] May not be for everybody, but it's
[1:56:17] certainly for me.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Completeness in numbers.
[1:56:23] Completeness in numbers.
[1:56:28] There's a lot of you folks sitting here
[1:56:32] as is with me.
[1:56:34] The numbers not yet quite complete.
[1:56:38] There's somebody that has to come in and
[1:56:42] experience this same birth. They have to
[1:56:45] come in. And when God thought of you,
[1:56:48] when he said, "I think when I think of
[1:56:49] you, I think of peace.
[1:56:52] I think of you being complete
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; because he knew the age that you'd come
[1:56:58] in, there'd be something in your heart.
[1:57:01] I've said many times, I don't want to be
[1:57:03] emotional about it, but I've said many
[1:57:05] times, if I got on the other side
[1:57:09] and my children were not there,
[1:57:15] heaven can't be heaven
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; because I'd be I wouldn't be fulfilled.
[1:57:21] I wouldn't be complete.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; And it does me so much good when I be
[1:57:26] able to get into this message and say
[1:57:28] God says I and he alone knows I know the
[1:57:32] thoughts I'm thinking about you
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; and they're thoughts of peace friends.
[1:57:37] They're thoughts of completion. Isn't
[1:57:39] that worth giving yourself to saying I
[1:57:42] would be desperate for this kind of a
[1:57:44] cause?
[1:57:49] I can't be complete.
[1:57:52] How much of those things I'm holding in
[1:57:53] my heart
[1:57:56] are there with me?
[1:57:59] When I think of you,
[1:58:02] I think of soundness.
[1:58:04] Somebody might be here and we're in need
[1:58:06] in your body.
[1:58:08] It needs to be made known to you that
[1:58:11] when God thinks of you as he has thought
[1:58:13] of you, he thinks of you as being sound
[1:58:17] physically as well.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could only grab a hold of it,
[1:58:21] if we could only catch it. I said it for
[1:58:23] myself as well. For my family as well.
[1:58:27] How many are here though have been
[1:58:28] prayed for and God has come on the scene
[1:58:32] and miraculously delivered you and
[1:58:34] healed you? He has me. When the doctor
[1:58:37] said it couldn't happen, yet God came on
[1:58:40] the scene. Why? Because it was God's
[1:58:42] thoughts. When I think of you,
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; put your name there. When I think of
[1:58:46] you, I think of you being sound in your
[1:58:49] body.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Think of you being complete. You might
[1:58:55] be enjoying good health today, but that
[1:58:57] may not be here tomorrow.
[1:59:00] Some of these things come suddenly, come
[1:59:03] quickly.
[1:59:04] on an individual.
[1:59:07] They're un uninvited, but they come not
[1:59:10] only on elderly people, but on young
[1:59:13] people.
[1:59:16] And if this is to be your case tomorrow,
[1:59:24] tell you what, I look over this
[1:59:25] congregation,
[1:59:28] there's people sitting here in this
[1:59:29] congregation
[1:59:31] that have fought
[1:59:34] with the demon of death.
[1:59:36] I see the Dingwall family here and I
[1:59:38] think of Sister Beth. Dingwal who's
[1:59:40] sitting right here. Stand up, Sister
[1:59:43] Beth. There's a lot of visitors here
[1:59:44] perhaps. Here's a girl that struggled
[1:59:47] with leukemia for eight years
[1:59:51] and was angelic all that time. I saw her
[1:59:53] so many times. Excuse me, Brother Kim.
[1:59:55] Sister Hedi.
[1:59:57] Our sister Beth was so angelic as a
[2:00:00] girl.
[2:00:02] My wife, I've shared this with my wife.
[2:00:06] I thought she's almost too good to stay.
[2:00:10] She's so angelic.
[2:00:13] Eight years,
[2:00:15] most of it in the hospital.
[2:00:18] Her record in the Edmonton hospital is
[2:00:22] almost a foot thick.
[2:00:25] And if you haven't seen her video, you
[2:00:28] owe it to yourself to see it. And the
[2:00:30] hospital in Calgary, Alberta, requires
[2:00:33] that every person that comes in
[2:00:36] diagnosed with her kind of a case must
[2:00:38] see her video, which was done right here
[2:00:40] in this platform. And it's gone around
[2:00:43] the world.
[2:00:45] Sister Amanda Snow,
[2:00:48] Amanda, you're are you here? She's not
[2:00:50] here just now.
[2:00:52] fought with the same devil.
[2:00:55] And the medical team trying to tell her
[2:00:57] from time to time, even since she's been
[2:00:59] here, well, you have it. It It's here
[2:01:01] and it's this and it's that. And her
[2:01:04] mother's standing here nodding her head
[2:01:05] in affirmative.
[2:01:07] But God keeps coming on the scene saying
[2:01:09] it's not there.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; And the medical team says it is there.
[2:01:13] Do we believe in doctors? We think
[2:01:15] they're fine people and we think God
[2:01:18] uses them. That's exactly what the
[2:01:21] prophet says. God can heal through a
[2:01:22] doctor. A doctor doesn't do the healing.
[2:01:25] He can only assist it.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; And any good doctor will tell you that.
[2:01:29] He can only assist it. But we have
[2:01:31] testimony here also.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I go to a doctor. I have a family
[2:01:35] doctor, which is fine. But uh uh we have
[2:01:38] things and and doctors can't go any
[2:01:41] further. And the prophet says when when
[2:01:43] the doctor when his ability ceases,
[2:01:46] that's just where God begins.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? I'm thankful for this
[2:01:51] word.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; But we can have all the healings. I'm
[2:01:56] not interested me merely in healings,
[2:01:58] friends. I'm interested in what the
[2:01:59] prophet of God has said concerning this
[2:02:01] word. And what a living word it is.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes, please.
[2:02:13] This is where I want to come to.
[2:02:21] When I think of you, I think of peace,
[2:02:26] your welfare, your prosperity
[2:02:31] in this day and age. And I don't care
[2:02:34] what your particular station in life is.
[2:02:38] This is a tough one.
[2:02:40] God says, "When I think of you,
[2:02:44] my thoughts are thoughts of peace." And
[2:02:46] that peace was quiet
[2:02:50] tranquility.
[2:02:53] I think of you having a quiet
[2:02:56] spirit. I think of you having a tranquil
[2:03:00] time. Oh, I know we're busy. We're in
[2:03:03] even desperation, but you can be
[2:03:06] tranquil. Even in desperation,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; you can be tranquil and be busy.
[2:03:13] You can have a quiet spirit and still be
[2:03:16] very much under pressure because by the
[2:03:19] same token, he said pressure is good for
[2:03:21] us because pressure shows us what we
[2:03:23] are. But in the midst of the in the
[2:03:25] midst of the fiery furnace, you can be
[2:03:28] tranquil. In the midst of the lion's
[2:03:31] den, you can be tranquil. We are not
[2:03:35] maybe in Daniel's lion's den or in the
[2:03:37] Hebrew children's furnace, but we have
[2:03:40] our own circumstance which can have the
[2:03:43] same effect. And then I want to come
[2:03:44] quickly to this and I'm going to be
[2:03:45] ending on this part
[2:03:50] that you can come
[2:03:53] to an expected end.
[2:03:56] My thoughts are thoughts of peace.
[2:03:59] They're not thoughts of evil.
[2:04:03] to give you.
[2:04:06] Now, his thoughts, now please follow me.
[2:04:08] Don't Don't tie our moment. My thoughts
[2:04:12] are to give you. My thoughts, what I've
[2:04:14] made known, what I've revealed
[2:04:17] through my prophet messenger, what I've
[2:04:19] revealed,
[2:04:21] the intent is that it will give you an
[2:04:24] expected end.
[2:04:27] And this is very very very marvelous,
[2:04:30] very wonderful, very unusual because
[2:04:33] it's unusual because it isn't what we
[2:04:35] think it would be. The word expected,
[2:04:39] the first the first meaning of that word
[2:04:42] is it's a cord. A cord like a rope. A
[2:04:45] cord.
[2:04:47] And if you were to do it, find where
[2:04:49] it's used in the Bible, the first time
[2:04:52] it's used in the Bible is when the two
[2:04:54] spies in Joshua were sent to Jericho and
[2:04:59] the city's going to be destroyed and
[2:05:01] there's a harlot whose name is Rahab has
[2:05:04] her house on the wall and it's the walls
[2:05:07] that are going to fall. She's in the
[2:05:09] most precipitous place. She's in the
[2:05:11] most critical spot. She's on the very
[2:05:13] spot that's going to crumble.
[2:05:18] and the spies come to her and after
[2:05:21] their visit with her and the things and
[2:05:24] the conversation that took place, she's
[2:05:27] gripped with a desperation.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; She said, "Our our knees have turned to
[2:05:33] water.
[2:05:34] Our the hearts of our people are smitten
[2:05:38] because we've heard what God has done
[2:05:41] for Israel. We've heard of the great
[2:05:43] things that God has done in this nation
[2:05:46] for these people. Let me tell you, my
[2:05:49] brother, my sister, the echo of the
[2:05:51] testimony of what God has done through
[2:05:53] you, through this message, you you can't
[2:05:56] even write it in volumes of books. It
[2:05:59] has rippled out far and wide. Many have
[2:06:02] heard about it. Many have been affected
[2:06:04] by it. It's not some weak little
[2:06:06] testimony. It's something powerful and
[2:06:08] it keeps reverberating and people try to
[2:06:11] shut it out of their minds but they
[2:06:13] can't get rid of it. Your life, your
[2:06:16] home, your family, your testimony keeps
[2:06:18] sounding out year after year after year.
[2:06:29] We have a brother in the church.
[2:06:34] Brother Ken Buckles are just looking for
[2:06:36] him
[2:06:39] was sitting at a table in Japan because
[2:06:41] he's a jet pilot.
[2:06:43] sitting at a table in Japan
[2:06:47] or Taiwan,
[2:06:50] believe it was in Japan,
[2:06:52] with a group of the airline staff,
[2:06:56] and they just got talking about some
[2:06:58] program that's on the television. He
[2:07:01] said, "Well, I don't have a television."
[2:07:05] They said, "Do you go to Ed Biscll's
[2:07:08] church?"
[2:07:11] and he's sitting in he's sitting in
[2:07:13] Japan around the table after a long
[2:07:17] flight just having a a little bit to eat
[2:07:19] and they're talking about he's talk
[2:07:21] about a testimony that's a minor part of
[2:07:24] it but I I tell you what what what
[2:07:26] brought that to their mind
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; something registers
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm in this church too
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we have this word to fellowship
[2:07:41] around.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; But Rahab said, "I want a true token
[2:07:47] that you will not destroy me."
[2:07:50] So now the token and the prophet said,
[2:07:53] Tom quoted this morning, "For your own
[2:07:55] safety first,
[2:07:57] not because you only think of yourself
[2:07:59] first, but before you can give it to
[2:08:01] someone else, you need to experience
[2:08:03] it."
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; You apply the token to your own life
[2:08:06] first, then let it echo out. Let it
[2:08:08] vibrate out.
[2:08:11] And she said,
[2:08:14] they said, "Take this scarlet cord.
[2:08:18] Take this scarlet expected end."
[2:08:22] Exactly the same word. Take this token.
[2:08:26] This will be a token to you and put it
[2:08:29] in the window.
[2:08:31] And now I saw something that was so
[2:08:34] priceless and so beautiful to me. I've
[2:08:35] been meditating it on it for the last
[2:08:38] couple of days.
[2:08:41] bind it in the window.
[2:08:44] And it actually means to and she now she
[2:08:47] didn't just bind it in the window. I
[2:08:49] didn't she didn't stick it on with some,
[2:08:51] you know, tape.
[2:08:55] I'm sure she put it in that window so it
[2:08:57] wasn't going to come out.
[2:08:59] She was going to fasten it there because
[2:09:01] she was now listen now. She her whole
[2:09:05] life became entwined with that cord.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that the cord was just bound
[2:09:12] in the window. She was bound to the
[2:09:14] cord.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; And when she looked at that cord, it was
[2:09:19] in the window. She couldn't look at that
[2:09:21] without thinking, "I'm safe.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; I'm safe. God's men gave me a promise.
[2:09:28] I'm saying I cannot be destroyed. She
[2:09:31] didn't have to worry about how are the
[2:09:33] walls going to go down? What's going to
[2:09:34] happen to all this mortar? What's going
[2:09:36] to happen with all these stones? All she
[2:09:37] knew is I'm saved.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; I'm bound to the promise. I'm bound to
[2:09:44] this cord.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; And that's my expected my expected end
[2:09:48] is safety.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And that was all she knew. That was all
[2:09:54] she knew. But God had something further
[2:09:57] in mind for her.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; In that cord that she was bound to
[2:10:03] was a husband.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In that cord she was bound
[2:10:10] to was a son.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; That son was Boaz.
[2:10:18] In that cord, in that cord that she was
[2:10:21] actually entwined with was her expected
[2:10:24] end, it was a husband and all her
[2:10:27] provisions for the rest of her life. All
[2:10:30] that she would need in that core that
[2:10:33] she was entwined with was a son, Boaz,
[2:10:37] who would redeem Ruth,
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; who would give life to Oed, who would
[2:10:42] give life to Jesse, which would bring
[2:10:44] forth the king of Israel.
[2:10:48] That was all in that cord.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; There was one last thing in the cord.
[2:10:54] She didn't know. It was revealed to her
[2:10:56] as time went on in that cord that she
[2:10:59] was bound to. She was actually entwined
[2:11:03] and inshed with the very lineage of
[2:11:06] Jesus Christ.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; The word that has been sent to you, my
[2:11:11] brothers, my sister, I feel authorized
[2:11:14] of almighty God to tell you uh bind
[2:11:17] yourself to the token.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Bind yourself to the word. Bind yourself
[2:11:22] to what the Holy Spirit makes real to
[2:11:24] you. Bind yourself to it. Entwine your
[2:11:28] life with it. Because in so doing, in
[2:11:31] that is your very husband, the Lord
[2:11:33] Jesus Christ. In that gives you your
[2:11:36] lineage, right? Back in the same
[2:11:38] prophecies, you are in look look at what
[2:11:40] what no one else can tell you, but you
[2:11:42] are in the father. You're in your
[2:11:44] heavenly parent. You're in his loins.
[2:11:46] You're in his gene. sitting here today
[2:11:49] in this church is the gene of almighty
[2:11:51] God has come down in the flesh.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; The gene of almighty God brought you
[2:11:58] here for one purpose that he could put
[2:12:01] his word in you and express it through
[2:12:04] you.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:12:14] She was bound.
[2:12:16] And brother Brandham in desperation, he
[2:12:18] says, "The little harlot Rahab,
[2:12:21] she was desperate.
[2:12:24] She knew that death laid before her. She
[2:12:27] was under judgment." And she got
[2:12:30] desperate and said, "I'll hide you
[2:12:32] spies. I'll do anything.
[2:12:35] Only swear.
[2:12:38] Swear to your God that my house will
[2:12:40] stand.
[2:12:42] In desperation, she bound herself
[2:12:45] to the scarlet cord
[2:12:48] and in binding herself.
[2:12:52] He also said, and the scripture said,
[2:12:55] she saved her mother,
[2:12:58] she saved her father,
[2:13:01] she saved her brothers,
[2:13:04] she saved her sisters.
[2:13:06] You might say, "That sounds too good." I
[2:13:09] don't care how it sounds. That's what
[2:13:11] the word of God says and that's what the
[2:13:13] prophet of God says. And there's all
[2:13:16] kinds of you folks here. You say, "I
[2:13:18] I've been praying for my son. I've been
[2:13:20] praying for my daughter. I'm praying for
[2:13:22] my children. I'll give you a promise.
[2:13:25] That token which could only come in the
[2:13:27] evening time. That token which the Holy
[2:13:30] Spirit has brought. That token which is
[2:13:32] the word of God. that token. It's not a
[2:13:35] phrase. It's not just a Wednesday night
[2:13:38] service where I say it's a life lived
[2:13:40] out. You are to apply the token. You are
[2:13:43] to apply it to somebody else. And maybe
[2:13:45] it'll take more than one application.
[2:13:48] You apply it by a life lived out. You
[2:13:50] apply it today and you'll apply it
[2:13:52] again. And don't forget, as I said
[2:13:54] Wednesday, you might have to apply it
[2:13:56] one way to one person, apply it another
[2:13:58] way to another person. But just keep
[2:14:00] applying that lived out life. Maybe to
[2:14:02] one person, they won't let you speak to
[2:14:04] them. They won't let you. Well, then
[2:14:05] don't speak to them. Just talk. Just
[2:14:07] live the life in front of them. Let your
[2:14:09] life speak out.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; I was telling someone yesterday,
[2:14:18] I've been called many, many times
[2:14:22] to go to a place.
[2:14:24] Sometimes the wife's a believer, the
[2:14:27] husband is not. The husband's a
[2:14:28] believer, the wife is not. The young
[2:14:30] person becomes a believer, the parents
[2:14:32] are not. And the family gets so the the
[2:14:35] family the the the relationship within
[2:14:38] the family becomes so tense, it's
[2:14:39] absolutely explosive.
[2:14:42] And I've been asked to come and visit.
[2:14:45] When I go there and the door opens,
[2:14:48] could cut that with a knife.
[2:14:51] This is tense.
[2:14:56] to walk in.
[2:14:59] And I have just a little a little
[2:15:02] secret. You know, you learn that after
[2:15:04] you've had your ears boxed a few times,
[2:15:06] you learn a few secrets. And one of the
[2:15:09] secret is let the surprise be no
[2:15:11] surprise.
[2:15:12] Don't say anything because they're
[2:15:15] expecting, you know, to be blasted.
[2:15:16] They're expecting you're going to tell
[2:15:17] them everything. Here comes the preacher
[2:15:19] now. Oh yeah. That's the last thing. It
[2:15:20] needs a preacher.
[2:15:25] The reason I look around the audience
[2:15:27] sometime is I'm looking for somebody
[2:15:28] because I get ready to tell their
[2:15:29] testimony.
[2:15:33] One of them I'll just tell this much. I
[2:15:36] won't say whoever or who it is, but it
[2:15:38] was a situation. It was a husband wife
[2:15:40] situation.
[2:15:42] It was critical. How critical? They had
[2:15:45] already identified. Well, that'll be
[2:15:46] yours in the divorce and I'll take that
[2:15:48] and you can have the sofa and I'll take
[2:15:50] this and you take that and I'll have the
[2:15:51] microwave. And so they had everything
[2:15:53] all sorted out who was taking who and as
[2:15:56] a last death wish said would you mind if
[2:15:59] I had brother Ed come over
[2:16:02] I don't care you know you want to have
[2:16:03] him over like last death wish
[2:16:07] so I came over and atmosphere
[2:16:10] and uh the sister she might be here this
[2:16:14] morning
[2:16:15] she's here most of the time she was in a
[2:16:18] pair of jeans and had her feet up on the
[2:16:19] coffee table smoking a cigarette
[2:16:23] And the husband says, "Oh, dear. Uh,
[2:16:26] here's Brother Ed." She goes, "Hi."
[2:16:32] I thought, "Boy, we got a long ways to
[2:16:33] go."
[2:16:37] So, the evening went on and on and on
[2:16:40] and on and on and I just had nothing.
[2:16:42] You know, we just talked about life,
[2:16:44] talked about things. The prophet though
[2:16:46] gave us keys. So, I was busy looking for
[2:16:49] my key.
[2:16:50] which key do I use on this one?
[2:16:54] But one wonderful key is he says just
[2:16:56] talk about what they like to talk about.
[2:16:58] You know, if they're a farmer, talk
[2:16:59] about farming. So I thought, well, she's
[2:17:03] a mother. She's got some kids, so I'll
[2:17:05] talk about her kids. I'll talk about
[2:17:06] being a mother. And man, when we got on
[2:17:09] to that, oh, just talking about the kids
[2:17:11] and how different the kids are, and we
[2:17:12] couldn't get talking about the kids and
[2:17:14] all about the kids. And finally, uh, the
[2:17:17] night is over. Time for me to go home.
[2:17:19] about 10:30 or so and I said uh called
[2:17:23] her by name and I said you know I said
[2:17:26] uh I don't know have any questions
[2:17:30] I said I may not be able to answer them.
[2:17:34] I said, "But if you have any questions,
[2:17:36] you know, I'd be happy to answer them if
[2:17:40] I can, but I know the evening's gone
[2:17:42] on."
[2:17:44] And she and she started breaking down
[2:17:45] right away, right then.
[2:17:48] And she called her husband by name. She
[2:17:50] says,
[2:17:52] "And she can't even talk. He tells me my
[2:17:55] baptisms of of the devil." I tell you,
[2:17:58] the door was open. She opened it. I
[2:18:00] didn't have to open it. She just kicked
[2:18:02] the door open. And I I walked in, I
[2:18:04] said, "Well, I wouldn't say that, but
[2:18:08] she was in the baptismal tank in about
[2:18:09] two weeks."
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; And I was able to baptize her in the
[2:18:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Just, you know, let let the conversation
[2:18:20] be something that that they opened the
[2:18:22] door.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; So, I didn't say anything. Let her open
[2:18:25] the door. And that's But I think quite
[2:18:28] frankly, I think I applied something
[2:18:30] there. I think that God allowed me to
[2:18:33] apply something there. And so with one
[2:18:35] year, real quiet, with another one, it's
[2:18:37] altogether different. But what are we
[2:18:39] doing?
[2:18:41] Giving them
[2:18:43] the expected end,
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; a tiepost.
[2:18:49] And friends, I close with that.
[2:18:53] You folks here,
[2:18:56] you believers of this message,
[2:18:59] God's given you a tiepost,
[2:19:05] a cord,
[2:19:07] an expected end. And that cord is
[2:19:09] actually to bind you also.
[2:19:15] When did you hear about your theophony
[2:19:18] body?
[2:19:19] Did you ever hear about your theophony
[2:19:21] body?
[2:19:23] I wonder if there's anyone in this in
[2:19:25] this house in this congregation that
[2:19:28] ever heard that you had a theophony
[2:19:31] body. I want to know if anyone told you
[2:19:34] outside of coming from the message
[2:19:38] and I'd be happy to I'd be happy to know
[2:19:40] because I'd like to see after the
[2:19:41] service ask you where you heard it,
[2:19:43] where it came from. I would really want
[2:19:45] to know. I'm sincerely interested. If
[2:19:46] you are, you could just raise your hand.
[2:19:48] Yeah. I heard all about my theophony
[2:19:51] body long before I came to the message
[2:19:53] and long before I was in contact with
[2:19:55] anybody from the message. It's so clear
[2:19:57] in the Bible, but I never heard about
[2:19:59] it. So, what's a prophet for? Prophets
[2:20:02] would take you to the word and give you
[2:20:04] a tiepost.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Who ever heard? Some of you been in
[2:20:09] Bible school.
[2:20:11] No, but now it goes into detail.
[2:20:15] In absolute detail. And God said, "Let
[2:20:18] us make man in our image." And you
[2:20:20] skipped around that.
[2:20:22] Then God said in in Genesis 2, "Now I'll
[2:20:25] form man out of the soil of the earth.
[2:20:28] And from that man came a woman, and from
[2:20:30] the woman came you,
[2:20:32] but we skipped around that first one.
[2:20:36] You skipped around it.
[2:20:39] And the whole program is we came through
[2:20:40] a sexual birth and we come through this
[2:20:43] world and we live in our age." But God
[2:20:45] sends his word to retie retrieve his
[2:20:48] children and bring them back to that one
[2:20:50] they skipped around.
[2:20:52] When do we hear that? Do you know what
[2:20:54] friends? I'm not a young man anymore but
[2:20:58] more and more that's a tiepost for me.
[2:21:01] Prophet has told me you have a
[2:21:03] theophony. Apostle Paul said if this
[2:21:06] wouldn't be dissolved I read it many
[2:21:08] times. I didn't know exactly what it
[2:21:09] meant. If your if this body be
[2:21:11] dissolved, if this tabernacle of this
[2:21:13] body be dissolved, we have another
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; eternal
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; that's without beginning without end
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; in the heavens in another realm in
[2:21:22] another dimension. So provides right
[2:21:24] beside you.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; You have a tiepost,
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; a token,
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; a typost gives you some comfort
[2:21:34] and that's great comfort.
[2:21:37] And then the future home.
[2:21:40] So we got a tiepost in life. Then the
[2:21:42] future home. And he comes and tells us
[2:21:45] you you came here this way so that the
[2:21:47] word could be tried in you.
[2:21:50] And then when this life is over and when
[2:21:52] the trial of the word is over, not your
[2:21:54] trial, but when the trial of the word is
[2:21:55] over, God's proving his word in you.
[2:21:57] When that trial is over, then you'll go
[2:22:02] to a future home.
[2:22:05] Oh,
[2:22:08] what a place
[2:22:12] a future home.
[2:22:19] My theophony that's beside me is a young
[2:22:22] man.
[2:22:24] And the theophony beside some of you
[2:22:26] young ladies and young men is perhaps
[2:22:28] just a little bit older than you are.
[2:22:31] But it will be in your in the perfection
[2:22:35] of what God had in his mind. The picture
[2:22:37] he took of you in his mind and all the
[2:22:40] rest of you
[2:22:43] right beside you. That ought to be a
[2:22:46] tiepost.
[2:22:50] That's your expected end
[2:22:53] right beside you. An expected end. And
[2:22:56] God said, "I made my thoughts known to
[2:22:58] you so that you would know what your
[2:23:00] expected end is." And that is your
[2:23:02] tiepost.
[2:23:04] How wonderful.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; We're on our way to a future home,
[2:23:09] little bride of Jesus Christ. We're on
[2:23:11] our way to our future home. Isn't it
[2:23:14] marvelous?
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; I want to sing a little bit about that
[2:23:20] if the musicians will come.
[2:23:27] Now, just so you don't think that I was
[2:23:31] just saying this of my own self,
[2:23:34] but brother Brandham reads and quotes
[2:23:37] first 2 Corinthians 5:1, "If this
[2:23:40] earthly body be dissolved, this earthly
[2:23:42] tabernacle,
[2:23:43] we have another."
[2:23:45] And these are his words. When but when
[2:23:48] the testing of his word is over then we
[2:23:51] are taken up to this body that was
[2:23:54] prepared for us before the foundation of
[2:23:56] the world. It is the word there that we
[2:23:59] skipped to come around to come right
[2:24:02] around down here to be tempted and
[2:24:05] tested. It was the word we skipped
[2:24:08] around.
[2:24:13] They gave Rahab a a cord
[2:24:18] and she didn't know fully what it is.
[2:24:19] And I want to say to this congregation
[2:24:21] today,
[2:24:26] let's act.
[2:24:28] Let's act in the same measure that Rahab
[2:24:32] act in desperation.
[2:24:34] Even her not knowing what the full
[2:24:36] measure of that cord was, what that
[2:24:39] token was. And I'd like to say to you,
[2:24:41] you have a message. You've received a
[2:24:44] word. But without belittling what you
[2:24:46] believe, let me say to you, you in no
[2:24:49] wise know the full measure of what God
[2:24:54] has in store in your token.
[2:24:57] There's no way for you to know it. No
[2:24:59] way for you to know it. Eye has not
[2:25:02] seen, neither is ear heard what God has
[2:25:07] prepared for them. But the spirit is
[2:25:10] attempting to make it known to us,
[2:25:13] reveal it to us.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[2:25:18] I want to sing It Is Well with my soul.
[2:25:21] I believe it's 5:48.
[2:25:24] And if you would stand with me
[2:25:26] before we sing, I'd like to pray.
[2:25:30] Dear heavenly father,
[2:25:32] oh, how I thank you for your word. How I
[2:25:36] thank you for these treasures. How I
[2:25:38] thank you, oh God, for what you have
[2:25:41] made known. And I want to Lord, before
[2:25:44] this congregation of people and all who
[2:25:47] may be connected with us, I want to make
[2:25:51] my personal declaration.
[2:25:53] Thank you, oh my father, for making
[2:25:57] known your thoughts. And in making known
[2:26:00] your thoughts, you have spoke peace to
[2:26:04] my soul. And I know that you have spoken
[2:26:07] peace to a multitude that is here today.
[2:26:12] You have spoken peace and your thoughts
[2:26:14] are not thoughts of evil but of peace
[2:26:18] and to give us an expected end to give
[2:26:22] us a token to give us a typost to give
[2:26:26] us a cord. And I say, "Oh God, in my
[2:26:30] prayer today at the close of this
[2:26:32] service, with all that is in me, Lord,
[2:26:35] I've entwined myself with this cord. And
[2:26:38] I pray it'll be an example to others to
[2:26:40] entwine themselves, to involve every
[2:26:43] part of their lives, their job, their
[2:26:46] home, their families, their worship in
[2:26:48] all parts, every aspect of their life.
[2:26:51] Oh God, may it be entwined. And if it is
[2:26:54] something that wouldn't fit in with the
[2:26:57] token life, may they may they get rid of
[2:27:00] that. May they let go of it. May they
[2:27:03] sanctify themselves and live, oh God,
[2:27:07] that life which indeed is a token life.
[2:27:10] In the name of Jesus Christ, I call for
[2:27:12] your blessings to be upon this
[2:27:14] congregation. And may they take these
[2:27:17] things, Father.
[2:27:18] I pray they will take them and allow
[2:27:20] them to be pondered deep within their
[2:27:23] heart in the name of Jesus and for his
[2:27:26] glory alone. Amen.
[2:27:30] When peace like a river,
[2:27:38] like a river,
[2:27:42] attend
[2:27:44] my way.
[2:27:47] And
[2:27:50] I see
[2:27:54] [Music]
[2:27:58] I
[2:28:01] want thou
[2:28:05] me to say
[2:28:08] it is well.
[2:28:11] It is well with my soul.
[2:28:18] It is well
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:24] with my soul.
[2:28:29] It is well.
[2:28:32] It is well with my soul.
[2:28:41] No,
[2:28:43] [Music]
[2:28:46] no trials.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. And this blessed
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:29:07] my child
[2:29:09] has made
[2:29:14] it
[2:29:16] for my soul.
[2:29:22] It is well
[2:29:27] with my soul.
[2:29:30] With my soul.
[2:29:32] It is well. It is well
[2:29:37] with my soul.
[2:29:43] My sing
[2:29:46] [Music]
[2:29:48] all his glorious
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:54] my
[2:29:56] not
[2:29:58] [Music]
[2:30:04] [Applause]
[2:30:06] to the cross
[2:30:08] and I
[2:30:11] no more.
[2:30:13] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:30:18] Oh my soul
[2:30:24] is well
[2:30:26] [Music]
[2:30:29] with my soul.
[2:30:32] My soul is well.
[2:30:37] It is well
[2:30:39] with my soul
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; and Lord haste the day
[2:30:50] when my face shall be
[2:31:00] as a
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:08] has found
[2:31:11] the Lord shall
[2:31:15] even
[2:31:20] with my soul.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; It is
[2:31:27] well
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[2:31:37] Well,
[2:31:38] [Music]
[2:31:42] my soul,
[2:31:45] this last verse is like an anthem to the
[2:31:48] believers. If you don't like singing and
[2:31:51] you don't like worship and you don't
[2:31:52] like heavenly music, don't come to my
[2:31:57] corner of heaven. So, I'm going to
[2:31:59] solicit everybody I can.
[2:32:02] Hallelujah.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, kids? We can sing
[2:32:07] with everything that's in us. I you hear
[2:32:09] at some sports events and boy, sometimes
[2:32:12] they're almost deafening.
[2:32:16] I like it. I like people that are
[2:32:18] enthusiastic,
[2:32:20] but I like people enthusiastic about
[2:32:23] their salvation.
[2:32:26] Where else can we do it?
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; You can't do it at Bellis Fair.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; At least I don't hear it there. You
[2:32:34] can't do it at Willowbrook.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; You don't do it on the street. They'll
[2:32:39] lock you up. But you can do it here.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; You can do it here.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my sin. Not in part, but the whole
[2:32:47] ought to throw everybody into
[2:32:49] desperation.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; And if you're here today and you haven't
[2:32:52] got that experience, don't let the devil
[2:32:54] lie to you.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; Realize the devil can't tell you the
[2:32:59] truth.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; Don't live part way. Don't live just
[2:33:03] with a half victory.
[2:33:05] Live it to the full.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I get a support from this
[2:33:09] congregation? Live it to the full. Enjoy
[2:33:12] it. Be fulfilled. His thoughts toward
[2:33:15] you is to completion.
[2:33:18] Be fully satisfied, fully content, full
[2:33:21] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; This last verse,
[2:33:26] the sky, not my, not the grave is our
[2:33:29] goal.
[2:33:35] But
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; for
[2:33:42] weigh
[2:33:45] the sky
[2:33:47] of the grael
[2:33:58] [Music]
[2:33:59] and The
[2:34:02] Lord
[2:34:07] [Music]
[2:34:10] my soul
[2:34:13] [Music]
[2:34:15] is well. It is well with my soul. With
[2:34:22] my soul
[2:34:24] is well
[2:34:26] [Music]
[2:34:29] with my soul.
[2:34:34] But Lord
[2:34:36] haste the day
[2:34:39] for thy coming.
[2:34:42] [Music]
[2:34:45] the sky.
[2:34:47] Lots of great
[2:34:51] [Music]
[2:35:05] [Music]
[2:35:11] soul.
[2:35:12] [Music]
[2:35:14] It is well
[2:35:19] with my soul.
[2:35:22] [Music]
[2:35:24] It is well
[2:35:27] [Music]
[2:35:30] with my soul.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise to God.
[2:35:46] Are you here without this hope? I wish
[2:35:48] that you would have it.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Don't deny him.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; He's here to give you this completion.
[2:35:57] May God reach through to you by his word
[2:36:00] and by his spirit is my prayer.
[2:36:05] We're not after people to join this
[2:36:07] church.
[2:36:08] We're after people to be included in the
[2:36:11] bride body of Jesus Christ.
[2:36:15] May God grant it is my prayer. I'll be
[2:36:18] so rewarded
[2:36:20] if just one, even one, young or old, man
[2:36:24] or woman
[2:36:26] or child
[2:36:29] can receive him
[2:36:32] in the full redemption, full measure of
[2:36:35] his redemption.
[2:36:37] God grant it. I pray can ask brother
[2:36:40] Tony Ab if you'll come
[2:36:43] pray a prayer of blessing upon this
[2:36:45] people.
[2:36:47] There's no service this evening
[2:36:50] while we're preparing now for this camp.
[2:36:52] No no no evening service on Sundays
[2:36:55] until after the when school starts
[2:36:58] again. And brother Tony, would you come
[2:37:01] please?
[2:37:06] Heavenly Father,
[2:37:09] truly the sky is our goal.
[2:37:12] Lord, that completeness of being united
[2:37:15] with you, Lord. That's what our heart
[2:37:17] and our soul longs for, Lord. How we
[2:37:20] have been brought to the knowledge and
[2:37:22] the revelation that this is what you
[2:37:25] desire, Lord. This is what was in your
[2:37:27] mind and in your thoughts, Lord, before
[2:37:29] the foundation of the world, that you
[2:37:31] would have a body. You would have a
[2:37:33] bride. you would have a people that
[2:37:34] would so emulate the love that you have
[2:37:37] shown to them. And Lord, here we are,
[2:37:39] your people, Lord, rejoicing in your
[2:37:41] great gift of love and forgiveness of
[2:37:43] sins. Lord, those who were, Lord,
[2:37:46] trapped in these bodies of sin. You have
[2:37:48] forgiven. You have justified us. We are
[2:37:51] now the word made flesh, oh God, because
[2:37:53] of your spirit living within us. Oh,
[2:37:55] what blessed thoughts these are, Lord.
[2:37:58] how that we've been enjoined into the
[2:37:59] very lifream of eternal God himself. Oh
[2:38:03] father, as we would go from this place
[2:38:05] today, Lord Jesus, may the reality of
[2:38:08] these thoughts so permeate our lives,
[2:38:11] permeate our thinking, permeate our
[2:38:13] actions, Lord, that we would be nothing
[2:38:15] less than God being expressed in this
[2:38:18] sinful world. Bless your people. We pray
[2:38:21] how we thank you for the word. Thank you
[2:38:23] for Lord a obedient humble servant to
[2:38:26] deliver the burden that you have given
[2:38:28] to him. Lord may we be strengthened to
[2:38:30] go forth and live this life to the
[2:38:33] fullness. Lord let us not be ashamed for
[2:38:36] this glorious gift that you've given to
[2:38:38] us. How we thank you and rejoice in it
[2:38:40] now. Bless your people as we would go
[2:38:42] forth Lord in the power of your spirit
[2:38:44] as we ask all these mercies. And
[2:38:47] everyone said amen. Amen. Brother Tony,
[2:38:56] God bless you. We dismiss you in the
[2:38:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Go and
[2:39:00] live this life. I say to you in the name
[2:39:03] of the Lord, apply this token. Apply it
[2:39:05] to somebody. When you walk out of here,
[2:39:06] just say, "Who am I going to apply this
[2:39:08] to? I'm going to apply this life." God
[2:39:10] bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:39:13] name.
[2:39:14] Amen.
