So, Lord, speak to us deeply from your word. Move us, Lord, into depths we have not known, Lord, and we'll be sure to give you all the glory, the honor, and praise. Speak to every one of us. Those that have joined with us, Lord, on the internet, move upon their hearts and lives. Deal with us all, Lord. We need the dealing of God within our lives. Speak, we pray once again.

Man, the Lord knows you this morning. He knows what you need. He knows your name. Let's ask uh brother Biscll is coming. 2565 I have a maker. He formed my heart. Amen. We'll sing it together.

What a savior. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we have. Amen. We're here to worship him. &gt;&gt; We're here to give him what is what is due to him. Amen. I believe you feel that way. It's how I feel. Amen. Before we turn to the word, we have uh an announcement and also uh going to have a brief testimony. Got a bit of a surprise for you. But we were surprised to receive the call on Thursday evening that our brother Jake Hoffer had suddenly passed into the presence of the Lord. And we were not only surprised but we were praying that he would be returned to us. And there was a uh when I first got the first call uh there was still a pulse in our brother's body and we thought that perhaps the Lord would bring him back to us. That was our prayer. That's always our desire. But God is sovereign. He does he does things according to his own will and we just are pleased with that. But he passed into the presence of the Lord on Thursday evening and uh his going was very sudden. He was actually in his truck at the wheel of his truck and his employer who he works for on the farm, he's been there about 12 years. He had uh just offloaded some things from the tractor to the truck and then continued on. Got to the end of the field and coming back he noticed the truck hadn't moved and brother Jake was just slumped over the wheel. So uh short time later was determined that he could not be resuscitated. We are missing him. And sister Marian, his dear wife, is here in the service this morning. And I say, God bless her. God bless the family. God bless them with peace. God bless them with comfort. And I can say that the time we spent with them that evening, it was evident. And my wife could only say when we were in the car. Uh we don't sorrow as others. &gt;&gt; Uh it's not something you have to try to put on. It's just something you possess. &gt;&gt; We do not sorrow as others. It's not something somebody tells you. It's not something that you're instructed to do. It's something that's from within. &gt;&gt; And I have experienced it. And I have seen the members of this congregation and other believers elsewhere. I've seen that strange and marvelous just supreme grace that comes to the believer even so that the uh unbelieving marvel and and many times do not believe it. Do not believe it. They believe that they're in some form of denial that will finally uh uh collapse and then they will come into such a shock. But it never happens and it never happened in my life when I have lost uh someone very very dear as my father suddenly was taken from me and uh I prayed for it was impossible. I wouldn't accept it of course but God poured in a grace that was beyond my own imagination. And I'm waiting for the sorrow to come, waiting for that separation, waiting for that terrible sting, and somehow it just doesn't arrive. The grace overpowers it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in that kind of grace? &gt;&gt; I do. And I believe in that kind of grace for our sister Marian and her entire family. And God bless them all. The service will be at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, not here in the church. It will be held in Lynen, Washington at the Third Reformed Christian Church at 514 Liberty Street in Lyndon. There's a map that's pinned up on the bulletin board, and there are printed copies there for directions for you. It's very simple and very easy to find right in Lynen 514 Liberty Street. And there will be a viewing tomorrow, Monday, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. But that will be at Gilly's Funeral Home. And the Gilly's funeral home is at 202 Front Street. That's right there on the main street, Front Street in Lynen, Washington. And I I know that Sister Marian and her family will not only be pleased to have you there at the service, but they will be strengthened by your presence and your fellowship because there is strength in the body of Christ. Amen. God bless them. Well, we have brother Deepak Titus with us. And brother Deepac, one of you just stand. Would you please be greeted? We welcome him. Brother Deepac Titus is the son of a pastor Titus in India. And you know, I have a habit and I think it would be a good habit for you to pick up if you don't already haven't already acquired it. They say often that the congregation does what the pastor does. Well, uh I wouldn't want you to do everything I do, but don't don't acquire my failings and faults, but there are some good things I think. And one of them is I always try to find out when I meet somebody, how did you come to the message? How did you hear about this message? And then I love to hear how someone else's candle got lit. It's just so inspiring. Brother Brandham says, "If you can't preach, well, you can testify how your candle got lit." So, I've taken from that and I think that's always been so wonderful. You know, I've been with people that have come like, you know, from America or Europe or something. We go to some third world country and and we always feel we have so much to offer and they're just talking and talking and talking and I I I like I like to just be quiet. I like to hear someone else talk. Then you hear them speak, you find out I shouldn't have said anything in the first place. Their testimony is so rich and so wonderful. And here brother Deepak is sitting there quiet. We just met him at the airport and this is our first time. Brother Milo came with me because I was had so many things to do and to prepare for for the services and the funeral and brother Milo maybe you can come and and be with our brother some. and this is what a program we want to do. So we're sitting there, we're having our tea. Our brothers and saying anything, you know, we're doing most the talking. Same old American habit. You know, we do the talking. Finally, I said, "Brother Deepac, how did you come to the message?" Oh, smile came across his face. You know, it's wonderful. Uh he said, "My grandfather was a pastor." Oh, your grandfather was a pastor. Well, how did was he was he in the message today? Oh, yes. Yes. He said, you know, he was in brother Brandham's meetings in Bombay. Oh, he was wonderful. Yes. He said, you you remember the account of the man whose eyes were he was blind and they were said he was a sun worshipper and his eyes was burned out. Well, yes, of course I remember. He says, "My grandfather was in the meeting." Then I decided I had nothing to say. That's about the time I'm all ears. Marvelous. Yes, he said. And not only that, but there was more to it than that. And I want him to tell you. His grandfather was in the meeting where the famous blind man was healed. &gt;&gt; I thought that was a marvelous connection. And uh I want brother Jeremy Bergen to be sure and get this testimony from our brother our brother Dpac Titus. Brother Deepak is going to be bringing his wife and young family here the Lord willing and he knows a lot of the people here because they've been streaming the meeting for a long time. And I want him to just to take a moment greet you from his father who's now the pastor of the church there in their city. and just tell you about that evening and the rest of the story. Come brother Deepac. God bless you. Amen. Just take a moment. Praise the Lord everybody. It's really a great privilege for me to be here and to stand in the fellowship of the saints. Uh I never imagined few years back that I'll be coming here and I'll ever get to meet brother Biscll and the lovely fellowship here. But um God has laid down everything in his time and uh it's really wonderful. It's a wonderful time for me to uh you know see you all. It's really a lovely bride. Uh I forgot brother yesterday to convey the greetings from my father. Uh he has conveyed his Christian love and greetings to you and your family and to all the saints in the fellowship here. uh we stream the uh the uh uh we we see the streaming video streaming on the internet and uh we we feel that we are part of this fellowship because ultimately we are part of that body. So and we really love to uh you know see the sermons hear them and they really do a lot of edification. Uh I have written down a few things. So please don't mind if I read it from the paper so that I don't miss out something. Okay. Thank you. Uh okay before that I'll give my greetings to my family who is streaming in Winnipeg and my uh parents who are in India. They also would be streaming right now. So I convey my greetings to them as well. Uh I was born in a end time message family. And uh as I grew up, I came to uh know uh the message. I came to know about the messenger. And uh I came to know the truth that's in the Bible because the Bible if I would read it alone, I wouldn't get to know much about it. But then when I saw the message, when I read the message, then it started opening to me. And that's when I learned that what my dad says is exactly the truth. because you need a person to open that book and that is the messenger. So I was born in a end time message family and as I grew up I started learning uh about the message from my father. We had a very small group in Nagpur. uh we had uh two three people coming in and we had a family worship sort of a thing and uh it started growing slowly but even when we were just uh seven eight people uh there one lady who was from denominations she used to pass by from the front of our house and she once gave the testimony that I guess there's a lot of people in your fellowship because when I go from here I hear many voices my dad said there are few people but loud voices is uh I I'll tell you something about my family before and then I'll go to the other part of the testimony. I have my wife Vandana she is a medical doctor and my two children uh their Shakina one daughter she's 5 and a half years old and my son he is Ashish he is three and a half years old. Uh yeah it's a small family. And my parents they uh they are government officers in India. And uh my dad he's working at the same time he's uh taking care of the fellowship. He's the pastor there. My mama also works. Uh my dad and mom they've given me a lot of love and through that love they've guided me into truth. Uh they were never uh they were never invective. They were always uh they always dealt with us with great love and that is a thing uh which is more than a tool to handle a child. I guess my mom, she uh really took great care of us and not only us but also of the ministers used to off and on come to our place and we used to have conventions going on and she would love to have them in the house and you know make the stay as comfortable as she could. Uh I have two sisters. Uh my elder sister her name is Joti. She's also a medical doctor and uh the second sister is Kiran. She's an engineer and they both are very strong end time message believers. Uh my second sister, she is uh uh she's not in Nagpur, she is in Pune, that's uh about 900 kilometers from our place. Uh okay. Now to come to the main part of the testimony. uh my grandparents they were Pentecostals and uh when brother Brham he came in 1952 to Bombay my grandfather's family they took my uh they took uh my grandfather's sister she was very critically ill and the doctors said that she won't be able to live more and nothing can be done about her and she would die. So they took her to the prayer meeting with the hope that God will heal her. When they went that same day when uh my my grandfather's sister got the prayer card, the prayer card number was one. Her prayer card number was one and the uh same day the man the boy who was a sun worshipper and his eyes had got burnt out. So he was healed that same day on the day when my grandfather's sister was taken there. As brother Brham saw her, he called out her name. He said Esther Titus. Uh after marriage she's known as Esther Massi. And she said you have come from Nagpur and uh you are suffering from such and such a thing and uh you are a girl who has no gu in your heart and he proclaimed her healing and she's healthy and alive even today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Music] Amen. So God is an awesome God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the time of the visitation of God's prophet in our family. He really visited our family personally. He took my family name over his lips and that's wonderful to me. Uh after that the truth gripped my grandparents, my greatgrandparents that is my daddy's daddy's dad. So it gripped my great greatgrandfather, my grandfather, my grand my father, then my grandmother and saw about nine or 10 people together of three different generations took baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and they accepted the message. &gt;&gt; And even today my dad has the same zeal &gt;&gt; as he had must have had at that time. I was not there that time but he has the same forward. So the Lord has dealt mightily in our family and three generations together got visited at the same time by our prophet and they accepted the message and it made it a part of the life. My grandfather, he was very very close with the Lord. And if you see his message books, even today, my dad uses his message books and uh the message books of brother Brandham, the ones he used to read. So he has made lots of comments and red pen and green pen and blue pen and everything and some you know connections with some other message and uh like that. And so his uh books, my grandfather's books which are still lying with my father, they have got two matters. One is the printed matter and the other one is the written matter. Lots of interconnections and everything. And my dad loves to read from it and preach from it. So that's the way and it's really wonderful to have it &gt;&gt; before uh he uh slept in the lord my grandfather he came to know through the holy spirit that he is going to leave in a few days he even knew that he's going to leave in next 5 days and there was a big convention that he he had arranged in our town and uh uh he already had suffered about seven heart attacks And he was a very well-built hefty personality and everybody was saying that please don't take the strain now there are other believers also we will manage the thing he said no when I my my meeting is scheduled on the uh on the date I have to be there that is my uh place of service and I cannot go behind it whatever it be I will be there and he wasn't well but still he preached with all enthusiasm And in the evening of that meeting at 4:00 he slept in the lord. So till the last time he performed his service after before leaving he ordained my father as the pastor because he knew that he was going to leave. He ordained my father and then my father he became the pastor of the church. He started pastoring and the work started growing slowly. Over the years a lot of people came and uh more than 100 people maybe they came to the fellowship and uh when they saw that oh okay fine the thing is truth okay it's correct but then it requires a lot of strictness there's no flexibility wearing clothes and jewelry and makeup and all every other thing so they just couldn't go ahead together and they took their own way but we have nearly 30 people who are really strong in the message. &gt;&gt; So 30 souls is a good number. &gt;&gt; We we we we visited many Islam areas. Uh we spread out the message as to as many people as we could. uh to the poor people to the people who are doing the service and every other people all the Christian homes but since the place is such it will never let anybody receive the message it's a very dry land and as it is physically physically also it's a very dry land it doesn't have any good rivers nothing and crops is also very poor and so is the uh nature of the people so whatever seed you sow there it might never reap It might never grow. But then our work is to testify. &gt;&gt; We held many message conventions and uh we try to uh do the outreach as much as uh we can. Even now we go to every other convention. Even if somebody else is holding it, we try to uh tell the people about the truth and uh some people do get interested but meanwhile somebody else comes and poisons their mind and they get lost. My dad says Nagpur is a perfect fit for the Pergamin church age because Nagpur has got the headquarters of WCC World Council of Churches. It has got the headquarters of RSS and has got a lot of other headquarters. So all the organizations the headquarters is in Bergamman that is in Nagpur. Uh my dad he suffered a heart attack in 1989 and doctor said that uh he has got a myioardial infraction and nothing much can be done about it. Maybe he'll require an open heart surgery. So they told that you should take him to the uh Apollo hospital that's in Madras and uh we went there and uh everything but then the Lord healed him completely. He gave him the verse of Isaiah 53:5 which says that the inhabitant shall not say that I am sick. So he said when the when the Lord says that the inhabitant shall not say that I am sick, I am not sick. I am not a heart patient. And then he went to the specialist, the cardiologist. He took his ECG and he said, "Oh, he just threw a stethoscope and he said, "Oh, you have a heart of an athlete. &gt;&gt; Did you ever suffer a heart attack?" You send. So that's it. The Lord is the healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was 13 years old when my sisters, my two sisters and I, we took baptism in the new Lord Jesus Christ. We have been uh experiencing the richness of the beautiful message each passing day of our life and uh the marvelous works and the vindications that we see in our church and all over the world that really strengthens us more and more each day. We greatly desire to be in this fellowship because we always have uh accepted this fellowship as our fellowship and uh we have been we though we have not been physically sitting here but we have been in the internet audience and uh our full heart is with this fellowship. uh we have been listening to brother Briscoll's video tapes more signs of the end time we have heard that more than once uh we have seen that and uh even after that we have seen many other video tapes uh when he had conventions in I guess it's in West Virginia brother Roy Shbury's church uh that we have been seeing and uh a lot of other tapes and of course uh we have been listening to uh brother Biscll's daughters uh We have few of their tapes and we have been listening to them since we were quite small. So way back in 1988 we have been listening to their tape since then. And then I love you Lord and there is a fountain and the songs that she was playing here today. Oh my, it reminded me of my little time you know when I used to listen to the same songs that she used to be singing with her sisters. So it's wonderful. It's a great blessing and I believe that the Lord is uniting the bride all over the world through his holy spirit by sending the same message the same dealing and it's too marvelous to know that when my uh dad used to preach a message in Nagpur and that's the other part of the world exactly opposite maybe and uh the same message in the evening when I hear from brother biscuit &gt;&gt; it's too good you know you know that it's the holy spirit who's giving You know that is the Holy Spirit who's dealing with you and that is the food for you food for the hour. &gt;&gt; Uh there there's been a lot of other testimonies. I won't take much of your time. But then there there was a crippled boy and his mother was a Hindu and she came when he was about four or five years old and both his feet the souls of the feet they were facing up. So they never touched the floor and he was born that way. And when he came to the fellowship and uh the faith started growing in her and then she said uh I want to take baptism in the name of Les Jesus Christ and she was baptized and you believe me within a few few months time both his feet turned and he started walking well and then he started running and he said she said the doctor said he might not be well because he's been born that way and it's all congenital and nothing can be done about it because his bones are crooked and but the Lord has made it straight. &gt;&gt; And she used to always stand up and give the testimony that though my son is not walking today, he's got his feet like that, but I know that God will heal him. And that used to be her testimony and the Lord Jesus really did it. &gt;&gt; And there's several other testimonies. &gt;&gt; So that really strengthens our faith because our God is the same God. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; What he did when brother Brandham was here, what he did when he was here on the earth, the same thing he's doing today. &gt;&gt; Uh I think I'll be shocked now. And uh I want to thank brother Biscell and uh sister Biscll we had a talk with her that day the other day and we want to thank them for all the uh support that they have given us and uh they have really uh helped us in coming here. uh they they have said that we they'll extend a small house for us to stay in. So we are very grateful to them and uh may the Lord Jesus help us to relocate here and may the Lord Jesus bless brother Briscoll his family and you all lovely saints here. &gt;&gt; God bless you brother. My how I enjoyed that. People that you never knew you'd ever meet in this life and and uh and then you find out that you are indeed one. All connected. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just stand to our feet, shall we? And uh I'd like to just sing if that course I am redeemed. Anybody ask you who I am? Every day marked with the Christ. Jesus has saved my whole life. [Music] [Applause] He ask you just who I am. Tell them I am redeemed. Let's just sing it once again, shall we? Oh, I am redeemed. One of Christ. Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am redeemed. How happy we are Lord to make that declaration. By your grace and by the provision that you made at Calvary, we can say, "I am redeemed, accepted in the beloved." Our ears, oh God, have heard glorious things as our brother Deepac has told us of his family and your dealing with them. We see how the sovereign God elects those that should hear and how oh God, it just seems that they're uh already ready for it. They're waiting for it. There's sheep waiting to hear the shepherd's call. &gt;&gt; We magnify your name and glorify your name for the great things you have done, the things you are doing, and the things you yet will do. open our eyes and our ears and our understanding. Now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ as we read the scripture. May the Holy Spirit, the author of the book, be also the interpreter of the book and be the speaker this morning in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Isn't it good to have time to hear these wonderful things? Amen. We never weary of it. I'd like you to read quickly. Turn to Matthew 23, please. We're going to read from the 23rd verse of Matthew 23. Just a few verses. Matthew 23:23. Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye pay tithe of mint and annis and come and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Amen. God bless his word. as you have your saints. I don't expect I will finish this morning. So, I will go just as far as I feel the Lord will have me do. So, I want to speak to you on something that's uh quite a burden on my heart and that is weightier matters. Yeah. uh one of the burdens of our society, I would say one of the things that we contend with and I believe I can say very honestly everybody contends with this and that is that this generation has been completely seduced into a sense of false balance. balances. &gt;&gt; Every area of our lives is permeated with false balances. And I would like to deal with some of those. I would like to just bring some of them to the surface. We're daily faced with decisions ourselves as individuals. Daily faced with decisions trying to decide between reality and falsehood. And yet we're caught in a web of this present day civilization that is actually based on false balances. The whole civilization is based on false balances. &gt;&gt; Relationships are based upon those things that are not lasting and thus are not lasting. deep relationships. Many of them are based on the appearance of the other person. What's that got to do with it? &gt;&gt; That's a false balance. &gt;&gt; Oh, how they, you know, how they spoke or or or or some other thing. It's it's a completely a false balance. and and very deep relationships have commenced on those I would say uh uh just such such uh shallow &gt;&gt; very shallow uh foundation it can never last &gt;&gt; and uh we base it upon uh relationship say with the church. They're based upon uh you know personalities. Uh someone oh we get along nicely with them. What's that got to do with it? &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual we're to be involved and led by a spiritual uh leadership. And uh we cannot have our relationships based upon compatibility or personalities or that we have a mutual interest. You know, this one's a farmer, that one's a farmer, so we get along good. Uh this one's a businessman, that one's a businessman, so we get along good. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; In the in the in the household of faith, &gt;&gt; it should be that the the farmer puts his arm around the businessman and vice versa. Uh it has nothing to do with what our profession is or what our you know our background is or let me get even closer you know uh uh I'm Ukrainian so there's a Ukrainian here and so we have we're great buddies. What's that based on? &gt;&gt; I come from England. You come from England. I come from Germany. You come from Germany. So we're great partners because we all come from the same place. And what's that based on? We're brothers in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; The other starts to get into an emotional realm and it and there's no substance there for real relationship. Now, we're talking about a relationship in God. &gt;&gt; I don't like to hear the terms, well, we Canadians and you Americans, &gt;&gt; where does that come from? &gt;&gt; Oh, the Americans are here. The Canadians, who are they? How did that come to decide who we are? Who does that identify? &gt;&gt; We're we're this, we're that. Well, we say, "Well, we're happy we're American. Well, God bless that. We're happy we're Canadian. God bless that." But that is very very shallow. We don't base any spiritual relationship on that. &gt;&gt; It is a matter, but it's a and and we don't ignore it, but it's not a weighty matter. &gt;&gt; Should I take my glasses off? Now Jesus said he said uh you have omitted the weight of your matters. So I'm going to go slow. You have omitted the weight of your matters. And the word omitted is that you have left. At one time they did have the weight of your matters but you have left the weight of your matters. To omit them is to forsake them or to let them go or just to disregard them. They're there and we're aware of them, but we just disregard the weightier matters. To omit them is to not discuss them. This is not open for discussion. You know, we all have a little private part of our heart &gt;&gt; and we all have a little private part of ourselves and some somehow we like to feel this isn't open for discussion. This is not open for discussion. This is my own private little part of my heart. But it might be a very very important part. It might be something that God is trying to touch that God wants to have a discussion with you about. &gt;&gt; To omit is to go away leaving something behind or to abandon it. We did have it. It was important at one time, but with time it became less important and less important. And the thing is it's not just that we leave something that is weightier or weighty matter and important but it is that we we acquire something else that's less important. &gt;&gt; To to omit something is to separate apart from the whole or any kind of a separation of that kind. Now it is striking to discover that after God led the children of Israel out of Egypt, he gave them commandments. And the first commandment is, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." That was the first commandment. Thou shalt have no other gods, plural before me. The first the fourth word in the Bible is in the beginning God. And that God if in the scripture is Elohim and the scripture the word that's used for gods plural false gods through the scripture is also Elohim. So you shall not have any false Elohims. &gt;&gt; You shall not have anything that replaces the Elohim. &gt;&gt; Because now we come into a state of uh responsibility for discernment. How was it that God should even say to them, "Thou shalt have no other gods. You shall have no other Elohims." There's a process that he was foreseeing that was going to take place within the minds of the people that would confuse them and displace the true God &gt;&gt; or the weighty matter &gt;&gt; for something much less important. &gt;&gt; And it's amazing to me today what has really replaced God in the hearts of the people &gt;&gt; for nothing. for absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; I have heard the lamest excuses. Many of you remember when brother Dan Daisley was here and he was preaching and he told of the pastor in the east I guess it was that noticed uh one of his members was not in church and he went out Sunday and walking down the street and he ran into him. Oh, he said uh missed you in church today. And the man says, "Yeah, I ran out of peanut butter." &gt;&gt; He said, "What's that got to do with not being in church?" He says, "Absolutely nothing, but it's as good as any other excuse." &gt;&gt; And that's about that's about how valid the excuse would have to be. He said it was just an excuse. &gt;&gt; Now, I I just want to go first into this uh for a few moments. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. And in the beginning, God created the same same word. Now, God according to uh the encyclopedia is the one supreme being, self-existent and eternal, the infinite creator, sustainer and ruler of the universe. He is a being regarded as possessing supernatural qualities and made as an object of worship. Notice that as brother Brandham says God is an object of worship and that's why he said there's was a time when God was not God because there was nothing to worship him &gt;&gt; or also that he says the encyclopedia says of God that it can be any person or thing exalted as the chief good or made an object of supreme devotion. Anything that absorbs one's attention and aspirations as money is a god. They use that as an example. So a god can be anything that's exalted as the chief good. In other words, this is the chief important thing in a person's life or made an object of supreme devotion. And I have highlighted anything that absorbs one's attention or aspirations as money could be as God. Now in the mighty God unveiled, brother Brandham says this, in the beginning he wasn't even God. Now our English word today, God means an object of worship. Notice how he just used exactly the same phrase. God an object of worship. How confusing it is to the mind. He said you can make somebody a god. Encyclopedia Bratannica says a person can be a god. &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet saying uh now I'm not having encyclopedia bratannica supporting brother Brandham. Brother Brandham states that as a prophet you could write all the books and whatever they would say wouldn't mean anything to me. But he said you can make somebody a god. You can make anything a god. But in the old testament Genesis 1 in the beginning god. He said the word that is used is Elohim which means a self-existing one. He said what a difference the word Elohim is to our word God. Elohim means a self-existing one. He said we cannot be self-existing. So now a person can be a god but they can't be Elohim. They can't be but but the scripture says thou shalt have no other gods. You shall have no other Elohims. In other words, the people in their minds, they have forsaken or omitted or left or departed the one and the one that is the the most important, the supreme being has been replaced with something else. And believe it or not, now we may smile at it. We may uh uh we may shake our heads and wag our heads at their utter ignorance and so on, but but let's not be too hasty because they took they took pieces of wood and carved it. They took metal, they took gold, they took different things and made them into gods. But I will say today, this generation takes things that are even less than a golden calf and turn them into gods because they replace God. They displace him for things that are empty, things that are vain, things that are absolutely worthless, &gt;&gt; and displace God in their lives. He says, "We cannot be self-existent. We cannot be almighty. We cannot be omnipotent, omnisient, and omnipresent." That Elohim expresses all of that. &gt;&gt; We cannot be that. The tree that that you make a god out of or the building, it's not self-existing. This building does is not self-existing. We are not self-existing. there he said you can make the piano a god uh it's not self-existing you can m you can make it and it can take the place of Elohim in a person's life in other words the self-existing one is displaced for some meaningless piece of wood or some aspiration or some desire that a individual has and without uh without real caution we find that that begins to consume us &gt;&gt; and displaces what is really important. So the Lord God in Genesis 2 and 7, the self-existent one, he that is who he is, the eternal I am. And I love this. I just want to share this with you even though it's not in direct uh relationship to what I'm speaking but I love what what God means in the in the scripture and in the Scoffield Bible. it the Jehovah the word Jehovah the title Jehovah comes also from the word hava h a va or h a w ah I believe but and from from which Jehovah is formed and hava signifies two things it also signifies to become and that is to become known so thus it points to and I love this I want to just leave it in your minds it points to a continu continuous a continuous and increasing selfrevelation. Now, now I'm I'm I'm referring to that and I'm emphasizing that because think of it, friends, as we go on in the service, think what think what there is in this society, in this generation that Satan is seeking to use to displace this one who wants to continuously and increasingly make himself known to you. But he he he is uh he's superseded by other things because other things impose themselves upon us in this kind of society. This is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; That's no surprise. This is Satan's Eden. He's designed the whole thing. He's designed an educational program. We have to be educated. He's designed the fashion world, but we have to be clothed. He's designed the whole political system, but we have to be citizens of a country. He's designed the whole the whole operation civilization of which we're members of it. But he's designed it. And so we have to walk through with the wisdom of the Holy Spirit so we can continually discern what is God and what is not of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a constant daily discernment of the Holy Spirit in our lives. If not, we'll be swallowed up. &gt;&gt; And Satan will certainly is willing to impose what he thinks we should be, what he thinks we should be doing, how he thinks we should speak, how he thinks we should act. And so that would rob us of this continual continuous and everinccreasing self-revelation of God. Now as I read the scripture also God began to warn his children very very early as soon as he'd called them out. And his first commandment is, "And God spake all these words, saying," Exodus 20. You don't have to turn to it. I'm just reading two or three scriptures. And God spake all these words, saying, here's his words right from Sinai. I am the Lord thy God. Don't make any mistake about this. I am the Lord thy God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage. and you shall have no other gods. I'm the Elohim that brought you out and you'll have no other Elohims because there is no other Elohims. But he knew that that in that Satan in his program and all the other heathen nations would impose upon the people their gods, their form of worship, their idea of how life should be. Right. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt, he goes on, thou shalt not make any graven images or likeness of anything that is in heaven above earth and in earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. You'll make no images because as I said here a few weeks ago, because as soon as you make an image, you have defined what you think God is. And that does away from his basic character which is an everinccreasing revelation of himself. &gt;&gt; How can you fix something and have it ever increasing? And that is why denominations are not of God because a denomination structures its belief and its creeds, its traditions or whatever more structures its articles of belief and this is what we believe. And when they say that then they have defined God and God departs it &gt;&gt; immediately departs it &gt;&gt; because you have defined him. Thou shalt make no other gods. It if you if you this is God &gt;&gt; and this has been spoken by the prophets &gt;&gt; and the words of the prophets because they are not the words of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel or anyone else. They are the words of God himself. And the words that come out of your mouth bear your character. &gt;&gt; They have something to say about who you are. And when the word of God came out, the very breath of God came out of the mouth of the prophets, it bore the character of God. And that is why Isaiah could say, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." And that word continues to unfold, unfold, unfold. It's not a paperback book in the bookstore. A paperback book in the bookstore says says a certain statement, that's it. It can go no further because it's been written by a man or a woman comes out of their brain, out of their imagination, and that's it. It will not expand and expand. But when God speaks, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it just keeps on rolling through time and it keeps uh it keeps expanding in its dimension and in its glory. Hallelujah. A virgin shall conceive. It meant very little perhaps to the people. It was just a startling statement. A virgin shall conceive. Imagine the scribe that scribed it for Isaiah. He probably thought that is a strange statement. But I know this is a vindicated prophet of God and I will write it down. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Then think what it meant to the disciples. Isaiah didn't have to come back and explain it. They didn't have to have another preacher to tell it. It just expanded in its depth and its meaning. 30 years later, it meant so much more. Here we are 2,000 years beyond that and it's expanded further and further and further. We say, "Oh, how glorious it is. A virgin conceived &gt;&gt; and the one became our savior and he became sin and I'm accepted in the beloved." Glory, glory to the one who came &gt;&gt; by that birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt have no other Elohims before me. In the message bomb and Gilead, notice it says, "Is there not a bomb in Gilead?" That was the question. Brother Brandham picks it up and says, "It wasn't because there wasn't a God in Israel." It was not because there was not a God in Israel. Neither was it because there wasn't a prophet in Israel. But it was the king's stubbornness and his hatred for the true prophet of Israel. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because that God hadn't supplied a remedy. &gt;&gt; It was because he was too stubborn and he didn't like Elijah because Elijah had predicted all the evil that had happened to his father. Therefore, he had created by the habits of his home to hate the man of God and to despise him and reject him. &gt;&gt; He says, "And if you reject," and here's what I want you to catch. If you reject the true and living God, there's only only one other thing you can do, and that's an untrue God &gt;&gt; or a false god. When the true God is rejected, the only thing that's left is a false god. &gt;&gt; If this people of this nation, speaking of the nation he was in, speaking in Chicago, refuses to serve the true and living God, there's only one thing left for them to accept. That's the false God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is a true religion of Jehovah and people refuse to walk in that religious order, then there's only one thing for them to do, and that's to find some other false way to walk in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, we would see Jesus says, "Whenever you pick a bogus dollar, whenever you pick up a bogus dollar and look at that bogus dollar, we have quite a few floating around here." I understand. Fact is, I had a US here and I I can't hardly get rid of it because everybody says we don't take them anymore. I said, "Well, that's amazing. you go overseas and that's all they want to take. And here I come over here and I can't even hardly get rid of them because they want to they don't have the equipment to examine them. There's too many bogus. But the prophet is saying when you see a bogus dollar just you just remember that that bogus dollar is made off of an original. &gt;&gt; For if there was no genuine dollar, then the bogus dollar would be the original copy. So, as long as you see somebody impersonating or playing the part of hypocrite, just remember there's a genuine Christian somewhere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "I'm not going to church cuz it's too full of hypocrites." I say, "You hypocrite. You're a bigger hypocrite than all the rest of them." &gt;&gt; How can you not go to church cuz there's hypocrites? &gt;&gt; Well, then if you're so good, go there and correct the thing. At least we'd have somebody there that'd be on B on track. &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If there's a hypocrite, you can be serve one thing. Serve one thing. There's a genuine somewhere. &gt;&gt; Genuine Christian somewhere. I want to be that one. &gt;&gt; I want to be that one. You want to be that one. &gt;&gt; Now, we started right at the very beginning. In the beginning, God. And then the first commandment, thou shalt have no other gods. If you were to go home today and read Malachi, the last book of the New Testament, it just took on whole new dimensions to me as I began to study. And I don't even know how I arrived there. I really can't tell you how I arrived there, but in my studies, I began to read Malachi, this last Old Testament prophet that prophesied. And he prophesied of a time when the people would be in desperate need of being restored back to the one true God. both Jews and Gentiles would need the same spirit of Elijah to restore them back to the one true God and to his word. And I'm going to give you some selected scriptures out of Malachi that will just kind of set the set the pattern here. Malachi Jesus said, "But you've omitted the weightier matters." Malachi says, "But you're departed out of the way." He's speaking now to the whole the whole nation. But you have departed out of the way. You have caused many to stumble at the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts. And now I'd like you to notice the last verse before before the scripture that foretells the coming of Elijah in the form of John the Baptist. Notice the last scripture. It's Malachi 2:17. And he says, "You have wearied the Lord with your words. And yet you say, now notice I I I'm going to be speaking again on this because there was just so much for me to try to cover. I was very very keenly interested in many things that Malachi was saying on behalf of God or God was saying through Malachi because it is one place where God keeps saying, "But you say and I thought that's amazing. You know what? What was it that the people said that caught God's attention? And he says, "But you say, wherein have we wearied him?" They didn't know, "Wherein have we wearied him?" And then God responds when you say everyone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord and he delightth in them or this is what he's saying. This is what the people were saying or where is the God of judgment. Now this is a very important part right now I'm coming to because soon as we say the word judgment people start thinking about judgment the severity of God and God coming down in and swift and judgment in the term of punishment but and and that is part of it but I I want to take your thought uh directed away from that just for a moment because what God is saying here you have said that everyone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord. Now, I want to tie that right into the scripture where Jesus said, "You have omitted the weightier matters." And and now notice he said uh uh mint and annis and common, three spices. The mint they even threw on the floor to fragrance the house. The mint, the anus, and the common. Three, three spices, three fragrances. And over here, here you have mint. And here he has judgment. Here you have annis. And here you have mercy. And here you have common. And over here you have faith. Excuse me. Is there any comparison in those? But the people had been reduced to that level where they had actually omitted. They allowed judgment. And the judgment he's talking about is this what I'm referring to right here. They they they lost their ability to determine between what was actually evil and what was actually correct, what was wrong and what is right, what's acceptable and what's not acceptable. That was the judgment. They lost the capability of making that sound decision. And that is why they finally had accepted uh mint somehow became mint. I don't know. It's not in our society, but I can tell you things I can tell you things that are more that are that that are more idiotic than mint. &gt;&gt; At at least mint's in the Bible, but a hockey puck's not in the Bible. &gt;&gt; A baseball is not in the Bible. &gt;&gt; A basketball is not in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. all kinds of other pleasurable things that people do. A can of beer is not in the Bible, &gt;&gt; but people people have those things have taken precedent &gt;&gt; over. Hey, I'm talking about real things. Your newspaper tomorrow morning or this weekend will be absolutely filled with the sports page &gt;&gt; of all kinds of activities and multitudes of people and churches are shutting down so they can go to these activities. &gt;&gt; You can be quiet if you want, &gt;&gt; but we're going to we're going to stay with it. I'm going to stay on track. &gt;&gt; At least they had a at least they had reason to have mint and anis coming because they were part of the scripture. &gt;&gt; But they allowed something in the scripture to take precedence over it and it suddenly became it became the main thing &gt;&gt; for whatever reason. It became the main thing. Now they had arrived I would say at a time as it is today power to discern right from wrong good or evil clean from unclean had vacated have today in this present time vacated the minds of the people. The prophet of Malachi 4 will restore, the scripture declares it, will restore the children back to the original faith. &gt;&gt; Not back to the original mint &gt;&gt; or back to the original common or back to the original annis, but back to the original faith. &gt;&gt; That which is of substance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who wants some material thing if I have if I have a a channel open to me that reaches into an unseen dimension that can actually bring things down and materialize them in front of me. What good is some material thing &gt;&gt; that can't heal me, &gt;&gt; can't bring peace to my soul, &gt;&gt; but I have access by faith &gt;&gt; to another realm. where we can lay hold of the promise of God and bring it down into my life and and say it work. &gt;&gt; How can that compare with some other thing that is uh not even genuine or real to the faith that's once delivered to the saints. Now, there would be no need of a restoring ministry if there was nothing to restore. There would be no need of a restoring ministry if there had been nothing lost. I want to say to you people very very quickly this generation this Leodysian age and we are in a bride age but the Leodysian age had lost not only lost something but I say they lost the essence of life. &gt;&gt; They lost the very essence of godliness and holiness and sobriety and those things which are so so important to our lives. This generation had lost it. Anybody who has found it, you have found it only because of the grace of God &gt;&gt; to your own personal life. It's been God's personal grace to you that has restored it back. &gt;&gt; And you are a privileged people. &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; I feel privileged. I hope you do. And so the question arises if this generation had so lost the faith the original faith my question is did the faith depart the children or did the children depart the faith &gt;&gt; and I'll answer that by saying the children departed the faith &gt;&gt; and that is what Jesus is speaking about you have omitted you have left you have walked walked away from that which is that that which is so significant and important. Now, we certainly need I say the leadership of the Holy Spirit in our lives so that we can discern between the gods. I've called it the gods of Leodysia and they are certainly present with us. The gods of Leodysia. judgment. God spoke to I need to lay this uh this foundation. It's quite a broad foundation in order for me to bring my point and I'm not going to try to cover it. I'm going to finish in about 15 minutes. God spoke in Deuteronomy and he said, "And it shall be, if thou if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish." In other words, if you forget, if you ignore, say, I'm not I'm not suggesting this morning to this congregation here, uh, that our love has abaded. But, but I am suggesting that Satan will do everything that he can within his within the scope of his devices. And we do not want to be ignorant. the his approach to Eve was that the thing that he was offering her was essential &gt;&gt; was necessary &gt;&gt; and that is where the danger is because we are living in a society we live in an age when there's all kinds of things that are essential. Education is essential. Our profession is essential. Our jobs are necessary. We must have an income. That's essential. But but Satan takes those things which we already have. He took something that Eve already had and promised her something further &gt;&gt; in the same realm of what she already had. And that was the snare. And so today we have a we have uh I will say you know whether it be the whole spectrum of our lives whatever it is you have a job you have a profession you some of you being educated you're going to education and so on and so forth and there is a realm where all of that is essential and necessary but my my message to you this morning is that Satan will take that which is necessary neessary and seek to extend that to the purpose of essentially swallowing you up &gt;&gt; and having you begin to serve that which is to be intended to be your servant. You become its slave. &gt;&gt; And worship, you'll be quiet now. Worship actually is bowing &gt;&gt; and being in obedience &gt;&gt; to some other power. &gt;&gt; And I say those all uh education. Now some may misunderstand me. I say get all the education you can but it must never run you. &gt;&gt; Have the best job you can be promoted as high as you can but it must never run you. It must never tell you how you're going to serve God &gt;&gt; and who you're going to worship. You're going to tell it who you're going to worship. &gt;&gt; Say, "I worship the one true God and you can never be my God." &gt;&gt; You can be my business, but you can never be my God. You can be my profession, but you can never be my God. You can be my educator, but you can never be my God. You can be a pleasurable thing to me, but you can never be my God. I love to get out in the woods, but you can never be my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you get another Elohim &gt;&gt; and the Elohim becomes displaced. &gt;&gt; So now judgment in the in the word that is used here, you have omitted, you have omitted judgment. and they left. And that is it will be an easy word in the Greek for you to remember. It's crisis. And if you certainly lose your judgment, you'll be in a crisis. &gt;&gt; And the judgment is primarily it denotes a separating and then a decision. A separating a a a discerning. In other words, a judgment you have to decide between this and between that. And once you decide between the once you discern between the two you look at them two and then you choose one. Then comes a decision. &gt;&gt; Should I do this or should I do that? See &gt;&gt; and when you do you have to think which one is the true God honoring. &gt;&gt; And then you must make your choice with him. So then comes a decision which is essentially a judgment. When you make a a decision, you know that you you're familiar with the the term a judgment call. You have to make a judgment call. I'm going to take this. I'm going to do this. I'm not going to do that. And these are the reasons I'm not going to do it for whatever is the reason. It might be legal. It might not even be sinful. It doesn't have to be. It becomes wrong. &gt;&gt; The judgment is a an opinion or discerning decision given especially concerning justice and injustice, right or wrong. That's what judgment is. It's an opinion about uh given especially concerning justice or injustice or something that is right or wrong. And sentence is a condemnation or a judgment or punishment that can be the end of it. And that is why judgment for example in the Bible we have a number of scriptures and the Bible says in Exodus 12:12 and uh death angel I'll pass through the land of Egypt this night and I'll smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods all the gods of Egypt and I will execute judgment. I am the Lord. He was saying, "I'm now he's not deciding whether Egypt is right or wrong." That's long past. They had enslaved God's people and God God had had concluded that they were under the sentence of God. And now he came to execute that punishment. &gt;&gt; And now the death angel, he had spoke to them through his prophet Moses. And brother Brandham says God was in Moses and Satan was in Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And that battle went on on earth between those two. And then God said, "Now I'll execute judgment tonight. The death angel's going to pass through the land." That was punishment. That was judgment. But that was not judgment in the sense that I am bringing it an opinion or a decision that's given between what is just as what is injustice or what is right is what is wrong. So uh now we come to this part decisions. When we allow anything what I said earlier &gt;&gt; to take the place in our heart that supersedes God, his word or his interests or the interest of his kingdom. Then we have another god. &gt;&gt; We have another god. And a person may say now I don't worship I don't worship uh you know I don't worship sports or I don't worship my education or I don't worship my business or I don't worship my job or I don't worship but if you allow listen only by neglect &gt;&gt; just by neglect &gt;&gt; it's not that a person makes a decision say now I'm going to serve this god of education I'm done with this god you know the one true god no Israel never said that Israel never said, "I'm done with Jehovah." He said, "We love Jehovah." &gt;&gt; But they had a loud religion. &gt;&gt; How many How many churches today I I drove past a church, you know, uh yesterday, and on their church billboard sign was happy to their coffee worship something, coffee worship time. I don't know whether it's true or not, but sounds to me like they got a god called Starbucks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they have to have to offer that to get the people into the church. I say those people don't know God. &gt;&gt; You don't know God if that's what you need. If you need to come here so you have coffee and have a social and if we design everything. Oh, we got something for the children and something for this and something for the young people and something and that's why you come here then I say we come here for the wrong purpose. &gt;&gt; We come here for the wrong purpose whatsoever. We come here first primarily to worship God and God is this word &gt;&gt; and we hear it and we are touched by the Holy Spirit. We say that is my God. &gt;&gt; And what he says I will do. &gt;&gt; I love what he says. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we allow anything to take the place of God in our heart and displace him or supersedes him and the rest the what what we how God became displaced is that he he just was less important as time went on and as Satan saw to it that there was plenty to crowd in and it became less important. The meetings became less important. Reading the scripture became less important. Hearing a message tape became less important. It just become less important. Less important. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, my I haven't I haven't had much time for God lately." Oh, &gt;&gt; what's been crowding him out? &gt;&gt; What's been crowding him out? Oh, well, it's, you know, it's just this and it's just that and it's just the other thing. Well, let me give that other thing a name, Elohim, &gt;&gt; because it starts to get you to bow to it. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, there is really no limit. The intent of Satan is to take whatever he can and extinguish and squeeze out &gt;&gt; because he despises the one true God &gt;&gt; who is the Elohim, the only Elohim. And furthermore, he didn't say, "Thou shalt have no other god before me. Thou sh no other gods." &gt;&gt; Because there are many out there to do that. May I go on a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Just another few minutes, please. Many forms of pleasures are gods in Israel. Many forms of pleasures. Now, this doesn't all apply to the congregation necessarily, but it's things for us to be very cautious about. We are in a star star crazed generation. Everybody's got some stars, got some heroes. I'm going to be pretty straightforward. &gt;&gt; We may not even realize it, but you know, we end up being influenced by somebody. And I will say to our ladies and our young people and our young ladies for example, I can tell you that it is not some wash woman or workw woman or some household mother that is setting the fashions for this day and age. It is some floozy &gt;&gt; that you would not want as a neighbor &gt;&gt; that is setting the fashions &gt;&gt; for the whole industry. &gt;&gt; Whether it be your blouse or your skirt or your shoes or whatever it is that you wear. And men, I'll say the same thing. It says, uh, you know, get, uh, well, they've got all kinds of names for them. And I'm not closline preaching, but I want to tell you that there is a God of fashion. &gt;&gt; There is a God of fashion that has come forward here in Leodysa and has th and is as absolutely evident everywhere. And you cannot escape it in the restaurant. You can't escape it on the street. You can go down to a place that is the most restful. And I like to go down and walk along White Rock, but it's amazing. The devil likes White Rock also. &gt;&gt; But you know what? I deny him the right to impose that I can't be there. I said, "You foul enemy. You go and do what you want. You're bringing these you bring these men and these women down into condemnation, but I am refusing to allow you to rob me of of a of a little single pleasure life that I come and walk down here. you want to throw all these uh half-dressed people around here, then they they will have their own judgment. &gt;&gt; And I think there needs to be a good testimony of somebody that's godly dressed. And once in a while, you see one and you're it's a pleasure to see them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This isn't Satan's world. This is his this is his age, Satan's Eden. But the earth has already been bought by my savior. Jesus dropped his blood on it. Don't forget, we own the earth &gt;&gt; through Christ. We own the earth. It belongs to us &gt;&gt; and you but you can't escape it. I don't care where you walk, where you walk into a mall, walk down the street, walk any place, it's there. It's in front of your face. All the rest of it. I say what we are. It's the gods of &gt;&gt; Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You turn on to hear the news. You just want to We don't have a radio one in our place, but we'll turn it on, maybe hear the news. I'll hear it while I'm still in bed in the morning, catch the news, and you got to have the the Hollywood Minute. Says, "What in this earth? What in creation makes a couple of people believe that the whole world is interested in which marriage this person is now in and which divorce they're in, and who's shacking up with who. I couldn't care less. It's all adulterous. &gt;&gt; The whole thing's total adulterous. &gt;&gt; But they are imposing it that the whole world wants to know who's with who and who's leaving who &gt;&gt; it's satanic. &gt;&gt; Absolutely satanic. &gt;&gt; And it's their style of life that Satan would like to this is the way to be, &gt;&gt; you know. I think we ought to stay away &gt;&gt; from any of the thing that the world you see that the world is suddenly, you know, putting it forward that this is important. You need to hear this. You need to look like this. This is the cool thing to do. This is the end thing to do. I stay away from the cool thing. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you're an old stogy." Well, be a young stogy. There's not a sin in education. There's not a sin in a profession. &gt;&gt; There isn't sin in books. Uh you might think I'm going east and west here. &gt;&gt; If I had a hockey puck here or I had a baseball here, there's no sin in either one of them. &gt;&gt; It's what they become &gt;&gt; to the people. I could have all the books of learning here. I could have all the history books and all the mathematics and all the rest of there's no sin in those books. You could take a television sit here as a cold machine unplugged. There's no sin in that &gt;&gt; in all of its pieces and bits and parts and whatever. There's no sin in it. It's what man has made of it. &gt;&gt; It's what man puts in it. It's what man distributes to it. &gt;&gt; There's no sin in a computer, per se, but look what the world is doing with it. They're very dangerous things. &gt;&gt; Very dangerous things. To the point is some people shouldn't have them. &gt;&gt; Some people shouldn't have them. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to have a television. &gt;&gt; Not at all. &gt;&gt; If you want to use it as a monitor, fine. But and there's no sin in it. But it's what it becomes to you. So, I hope that you're able to follow me through. &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't say that money is the is the that that it is the source of the root of all evil. It says the love of it. &gt;&gt; It's what you make out of it. &gt;&gt; And that by loving it, you begin to serve it. and that becomes evil. Then it becomes a god and it's a cruel god. So I've got, you know, I've covered business and a profession and a business. What about friends? What about relationships? Do you know? Do you know how many people I have dealt with? I'm talking about mothers and fathers and parents and they cannot break that emotional tie with their children. And their children are hellbent. And they're going to let that child begin to dictate to them what they can do and when they can go to church and when they can't go to church and when and when they can serve God and when they can't serve God. that you you you may not understand what I'm going to say now, but if you allow that, you're starting to bow to it and that child becomes an Elohim &gt;&gt; becomes a false god &gt;&gt; to that parent &gt;&gt; or vice versa or wife to husband or husband to wife. It becomes a false god. And because what now I described God just a wee bit. How do we take how do we take a human relationship here and somehow, you know, cave in and surrender to that and leave off serving the one true God, &gt;&gt; Elohim, in all of his majesty? How do we do that? But this generation has done it. &gt;&gt; And you young people, and I've heard it. I've heard it many times. Well, I have friends. We have fought that devil &gt;&gt; right in this church. We fought and that is a devil. &gt;&gt; Not your friends aren't the devil. It's what you make them &gt;&gt; to be. There's no sin in in them per se. There's no sin in the relationship with them per se. But it becomes sinful. It becomes a false worship and they are made a god. &gt;&gt; You are worshiping them and giving them obedience. And not that you turn around and say, "I don't believe in God anymore." Of course you do. There's people that are living uh living a life of debauchery. He says, "Oh, I believe in the prophet." No, no, no, no. You don't believe in the prophet. &gt;&gt; No, sir. You don't believe in the prophet I believe in. &gt;&gt; Because to believe it, he said, "To believe it is to do it." &gt;&gt; Is this preaching all right? &gt;&gt; Is it all right? Is this straight down the line? &gt;&gt; To believe it is to do it. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, no. I I don't deny God. I never deny the message. I never deny that." But in the meantime, all these other things, all these other pleasures, and all these other things, this is this becomes my life. I'm sorry. I have to announce to you today, you have other gods in that case. And those that may be listening as far as this thing goes, but a and and I don't want to just uh cover over and say, "Oh, how privileged we are that we don't have that anymore. We've been restored to the we have been." What what access that God has given us. I am so grateful today that the message gives us a a super sense a super conviction within us. It's what it becomes to us and the demands it makes upon us either by duty or by desire. And God spoke to the children of Israel. He told them that the consequence of this was that they would find themselves out of the land. they'd find themselves and I'll say that if we were if we are to serve all these other whether they come in the form of an opportunity they may come in the form of opportunity and I say thank God for the opportunity but the criteria is you make certain that you manage the opportunity &gt;&gt; rather than the opportunity manage you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it's good, friends. I really do believe it's good because I have It's been my experience. It's been my experience. And and and I have I wouldn't be preaching this if I didn't have some concerns. I didn't I if I didn't have some concerns. And you know, we're probably as far as time is concerned, as far as the day that we're living in is concerned, we're probably in one of the uh most upbeat times. There's more opportunities. There's more business being done. I don't know anybody that's unemployed in the church really. Anybody that's unemployed, you don't have to be there. I'm called on all the time wanting to know, is there somebody who wants work? Is there somebody who wants to work? There's all kinds of work. &gt;&gt; And so, there's opportunities and there's work and everything else. It's amazing that and I'm not going to get into it now, but it's amazing that Malachi deals a great deal with tithing &gt;&gt; because I have found I found that this has been my own experience. Prosperous businessmen seldom tithe. But you find a little fellow that's just grinding it out and he just gets his paycheck and he's just grinding it out. You find he tithes. I talked to well quite frankly I talked to brother Dioa because I want to know I said brother Dioa you know I know that you have you know you there's men here and they deal in diamonds and and this this country is a very wealthy nation with diamonds. Are you are you do you have some heavy givers that are supporting this mighty work? Because I know a little bit about business. And I said, "This thing's humongous. This thing is takes hundreds of thousands of dollars and I know that." So I just said, "H how are you supporting this? Is there is there quite a bit of income?" And I mentioned it from the diamond industry. And he just smiled. I says, "No, no, no." I says, "You know," he let me know that that is where the giving came. &gt;&gt; I said, "How do you support this?" He said, "Even even the Sunday school children, they just give a little bit for a book." All the Sunday school children and were able to do a book. and just the people of the church. This is the that common people, they just they're giving and that's how it's done. But the reason why Malachi speaks about it because it was one of the big things that the people vacated &gt;&gt; and we have a whole lot of young couples that are coming up in this church and I really felt it heavy heavy upon my heart. One of the first things you want to do when you get married is establish your tithing. &gt;&gt; And don't forget it. establish your tithing as soon as you get a job. And you see that that goes to God's work. &gt;&gt; We don't need it as preachers, but God's work needs it and you need it. And you need to give it more than God needs to spend it. &gt;&gt; You need to give it. And that's how God's work goes on. But even God finally said, God even said in the and I'm getting now ahead of myself, but God even said, "Will you rob me?" And the people had gone so far from it, they said, "Where did we where are we and have we robbed you?" &gt;&gt; They didn't even know. They They had so vacated &gt;&gt; and had other gods that they were busy serving. &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, where did we where'd we rob you?" He said, "In tithes, in offerings." If you'd have said, if God had come down and said, "I want all the robbers to stand up." All those who robbed God. They said, "Rob God? Who would ever rob God? We wouldn't rob God. I wouldn't. I love God." But they had gotten turned around in their thinking until they could not make a correct discernment. &gt;&gt; And so God laid it on the lines. He didn't just say, "Well, you're displacing some funds." He said, 'You stealing them. &gt;&gt; This is robbery. &gt;&gt; Robbery. Who wants to be identified as robbing God? And that that really that that covers that is in two chapters of Malachi. And do you know something? I've never preached on it because I couldn't quite understand just the way it was. But when the message began to unfold to me to see how the first commandment, thou shalt have no other gods, and then I get to Malachi and then get into Matthew right after that and Jesus comes and he was saying, "You've taken the weight of your matters." And the first one was judgment. Lost the sense, lost the capacity to determine what is truly right and what is truly wrong. And listen friends, God also said, and I and and preachers get on to this, and I don't want to get on to it, and I'm just closing this moment, but people get on to it because God's word says that I'll pour on you a blessing. And so people get on the television and get on the, you know, on the radio and and after people for their their tithe doesn't belong on television. Doesn't belong on radio. It belongs where they're spiritually fed. It doesn't even belong in voice of God. It doesn't belong some other place. It belongs in the household where you are fed, where you expect to get married or your children to get married. Where you expect us to serve serve you when you come into a time of trial and you come into into hospitals and all the rest of it so that there's brothers there that can go and pray for you and have their living and and and and to maintain the the service of the church. And if we're not doing it, then you need to be somewhere else. But as long as you feel it's a place that then it needs to be supported. You can't do it for nothing. And we don't need it per se. We are not in the hole, per se. That's not the point. We want to see your life blessed. &gt;&gt; I had a couple come here to church. I'm with this. I'm going to close. I never expect to get on to this, but I'm going to close with it. And they came to me. They were a young couple with two children. And they came to the knowledge of the message and called us in for to have a meeting with them. And they were serious. They said, "Brother Ed, on my income here, we have it tallied down." I had it all written down and this is what I earn. And when I'm at the end, what I'm saying to you now is a absolute truth before God. He says, "And here's what we need to live." And when we get to the bottom, we are at a deficit. This is plain arithmetic. We are at a deficit. And we haven't got any tithing in there. and as believers, we know we must tithe. I said, "Yeah, that's true." So he said, "I don't know how we're going to do it. I don't know what's going to happen, but that is a responsibility before God, and we have decided we are going to tithe." They were just young believers in the message. And he came to me about 3, four months later, and he said, "Brother Ed," and he was embarrassed. He said, "You're not going to believe this." He said, "I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it." He said, "We're living the same lifestyle. We pay the same bills. We started tithing and at the end of the month, we got money left over." I said, "Don't try to explain it. I don't know how it happens. Just do whatever God tells you to do." He said, "I'll pour it in." &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? I'll pour it in. You can't stop God. And it may not just be money. What about health? What about fulfillment in your life? What about happiness? Hallelujah. What about justice and judgment and good discernment? What about all those things? I say, "Oh God, pour it in." &gt;&gt; I don't care whatever comes in by money, but pour in the blessings of God. Pour it in upon us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Heavenly Father, you are our father. You are our instructor. You are our counselor. And oh, how we need this counsel, oh God. And I sought just to say some things, Lord, to kind of open this subject that's been so much on my heart. I pray you'll take these feeble words, Lord, and indelibly impose it and on the minds of the people, present it to them in the way that it should be, Lord. And if we've not said just exactly what's right, you'll make it right, Lord. You know that. You know my own heart, Father. How I just desire to build up the people to instruct them that the church may be a place that you will be pleased to dwell in. Oh God, have your way. Move mightily amongst us. Move in the service this evening, Lord, as our brother DJ comes to minister. Oh God, I pray that you'll use him and let him be a vessel for your service tonight, Lord. And I ask you'll give us a blessed afternoon, Father. Lord Jesus, may your name be lifted up and praised is my prayer in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to turn to 2036 and sing uh the song actually. Oh, How I Love Jesus. We sing the chorus quite often, but I'd like to sing the song. [Music] Is it a name you love to hear? There is a name I love to hear. I love the sing. Oh, it sounds like music in my ear. The sweetest name on earth. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Because he first love me. It tells me theior love. He died to set me free. It tells me of his preious blood. The s perfectly. [Music] Oh, I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. [Music] I'd like to sing the fourth verse. I'd like the congregation to sing it. And we're going to sing this for Sister Marian, her family. It tells of one whose loving heart can feel the deepest woe. Who in each sorrow bears a part that none can bear below. We want to be a strength to Sister Marian. [Music] They need it. And we can only we can't bear what he can bear. We cannot we cannot minister the way he can minister. But we want them to know that we want to be everything that we can be for these that have suffered such a loss. You know, here's this family and they've got family in the colony. There's many here from the colonies, but I can tell you what been is just a a blazing furnace in my heart. I wish somehow that they go in there and blast the colonies to pieces. There's brothers and family, immediate family want to come out to this service, to the funeral, and they won't let them go. I said, "Who won't let them go?" said a preacher. I said, "I bless that thing to pieces. &gt;&gt; I tell them, I'm out of here. I'm history. I'll cast my lot with God. That thing's become an Elohim. &gt;&gt; That man's lifted himself up. Those things, that whole system is so corrupt. I say to all of you that came out of there, anybody can do anything. I'd even help finance you to go there and preach the gospel in the midst of them, get thrown out, stoned, cast out, or whatever you need to do. But I I see a smiling. I I I I just got something burning in me. I I thought, who can we who can we send? Who can we uh maybe brother John Stall ought to go? He He had enough fire in him for a while to burn that thing up, but we didn't send him. Maybe they maybe they need to go. It might sound What if only one came out? What if only another one came out? &gt;&gt; I tell you, I love the I love the people that have come out of the colonies. Just platinum people. God bless them. And may there be many more if Jesus terries. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's shake that system down. And if any of them get to hear this service, I say your system's corrupted and it's not of God. &gt;&gt; It's of Satan because it it rules by fear and bondage &gt;&gt; and takes away even the human liberties that God gave to every person. No man has been no man has come into the earth to be a slave of anything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Andes. Nice to see you. Excuse had to have something distract me, I'd have been burning up here with this thing. You know, it's even illegal by the government. You can't hold people in this society like that. It's against the federal regulations. It's against But you know what? The government's corrupt, too. &gt;&gt; They cow out to it cuz it's a big industry. &gt;&gt; They're successful farmers and all the rest of it. I say Satan's the head of the whole thing. And God's going to destroy it. And God's going to pull out every single one. How do we know that there isn't another brother Joe Walner, Brother John Stall? How do we know they're not in there yet? And brother Jake, &gt;&gt; God bless him. &gt;&gt; Rest his soul. How we thank him. Thank God for the testimony he left here. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, we'll sing this last verse now. It tells me who heart can feel my wing [Music] sorrow a part that none can bear. Oh, how I love Jesus. [Music] Oh, how I love Jesus. How I love Jesus. Jesus. Brother Lance, would you please come and pray a prayer upon this congregation as we soon will leave. To me, you are so wonderful. To me, you are so wonderful. To me, you are so wonderful. because you first love me &gt;&gt; say I love him. &gt;&gt; I love him. &gt;&gt; We praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you brother lads. &gt;&gt; Heavenly father with gratitude in our hearts. We want to thank you Lord for the capacity that you have placed within us to discern between right and wrong, good and evil. that Lord Jesus within our hearts this justice, this judgment has not waned, but Father, we have held true to it. And then Lord, with the ability within our own hearts to be able to see perhaps even areas of our lives that have been intruded upon by the enemy. And Lord God, then with a determination and with a fortitude that says, "Lord, from this day forward, God, if you have been displaced, I will set you before my face. I will set you before my heart. And it'll be you that I serve with determination and with with with absolute unwavering faith. Lord, we ask that you would bless this congregation as they have sat and they have listened to the word of God. counsel, Father, right from scripture. And Lord, we know that it's the Holy Ghost that is within us that feeds only upon the word of God. And so, Lord, may that Holy Ghost receive his portion this morning.
