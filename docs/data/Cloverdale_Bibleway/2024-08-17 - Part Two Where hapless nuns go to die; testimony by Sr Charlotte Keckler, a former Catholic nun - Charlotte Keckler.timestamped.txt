[0:42] other side of Roman
[0:44] Catholicism the pope is coming sometime
[0:47] around October 12th
[0:48] 1992 wouldd like to flood Jamaica with

[1:25] the education of a
[1:26] lifetime thank you
[1:32] testimony
[1:36] [Music]
[2:11] if mayy Jesus in there is the crucifix
[2:13] and then we have a prayer board and by
[2:15] the way I assure you folk that you'll
[2:16] never want to kneel on our prayer board
[2:18] we kneel on it every day if we are able
[2:20] to walk under our own power it is a
[2:22] board uh about this high from the ground
[2:24] and they're too leading up like this one
[2:26] and this one is about that wide I'm
[2:27] going to drop my knees down on it and
[2:29] they sharp wires coming up through that
[2:31] board and then this one up here I
[2:32] prostrate my arms on there's going to be
[2:34] sharp wires after all I told you we were
[2:36] going to suffer we were going to do
[2:38] Penance and this is a part of my
[2:39] suffering and as I kneel on that prayer
[2:41] board I'm praying for lost humanity and
[2:43] I'm believing as I suffer that my
[2:45] grandmother will be released from a
[2:47] priest Purgatory sooner because of my
[2:49] suffering and I'll kneel there longer
[2:51] sometimes oh it's terrible but we don't
[2:53] know any better so we do that because
[2:55] that's all that little nun does know and
[2:57] we believe it and there we are and we
[2:58] are locked in our Sals every night the
[3:01] key is turning those doors we can't get
[3:03] up and come out of there and then more
[3:04] than that 7 Minutes of 12 we go to bed
[3:06] at 9:30 the lights are out 7 Minutes of
[3:08] 12 there's two little nuns appointed to
[3:10] unlock every door every little nun again
[3:12] gets on her feet dresses and full dress
[3:14] goes into the inner chapel and there we
[3:16] again pray one hour for lost Humanity we
[3:18] don't get very much sleep that's why and
[3:20] we don't have enough food and we work
[3:22] hard and we suffer much that's why our
[3:23] bodies are so broken that's why we
[3:25] seemingly don't have enough strength to
[3:27] carry on after we live there but i' like
[3:29] to say this to you as I go before I go
[3:31] any further now I did those various
[3:34] things we are taught to believe that as
[3:36] we spill our own blood now we must do
[3:38] this as I whip my body if I torment it
[3:41] or torture it in any way that I spill
[3:43] blood I I'm taught to believe that I'll
[3:45] have one 100 less days to spend in
[3:48] purgatory now you know we have no hope
[3:50] those little nuns don't look forward to
[3:52] anything you may think they do but we
[3:54] don't why after you live in a Convent 10
[3:56] years I began to realize the Virgin Mary
[3:59] is just a piece of metal she's a statue
[4:01] I began to realize St Peter is just a
[4:03] statue I began to realize that the
[4:06] statue of Jesus is just a piece of metal
[4:08] in other words we come to the place to
[4:10] believe that our God is a dead God and
[4:12] I'll assure you after you live in a
[4:13] Convent long enough not at first oh no
[4:16] but after we've suffered enough after
[4:18] we've uh seem many fallen down at the Fe
[4:20] of those statues and Spilled our tears
[4:22] on them and have begged them to
[4:24] intercede and get a pray through to God
[4:25] and years go vation of whatsoever a
[4:28] parent won't even know when they're
[4:29] dance so who's going to pray us out of
[4:31] purgatory or rather buy us out of
[4:33] purgatory no we realize after we're in
[4:35] there for a period of time that there is
[4:37] no purgatory and I of course you know
[4:40] there isn't and I know there isn't and
[4:41] there is no Purgatory the only Purgatory
[4:43] the Roman Catholic people have is a
[4:44] priest pocket and they're filling his
[4:46] pockets with coins in order to pray for
[4:49] the dead and may I say there are
[4:51] thousands and thousands of Roman
[4:52] Catholics in the month of November may I
[4:54] say to you in United States two years
[4:57] ago in the month of November Roman
[5:00] Catholic priest praying uh masses for
[5:02] the dead of the Roman Catholic people in
[5:05] this country in one month collected 22
[5:08] million for masses said for dead Roman
[5:10] Catholics that's just a little idea a
[5:13] sample of what's going on in this
[5:14] country and still there are thousands of
[5:17] mothers that'll work their fingers to
[5:18] the Bone to go over there and give the
[5:20] priest another $5 to say a Mass for a
[5:22] loved one that's in a Purgatory because
[5:25] that mother believes there is a
[5:26] Purgatory in the convent they have a
[5:28] painting of purgatory and there's
[5:30] nothing in the room but just that
[5:31] painting and you know every Friday we
[5:34] have to walk around that painting and
[5:35] when we walk around it I would you could
[5:37] look at the little nun's faces what do I
[5:39] see the painting as you would walk
[5:41] around it it looks like it's a big deep
[5:42] hole out there and there are people down
[5:44] in there and the flames of fire is
[5:46] lapping around the bodies of those
[5:48] people and their hands are outstretched
[5:50] like this and the mother will say to the
[5:52] little nuns you better go and put
[5:54] another Penance on your body those
[5:56] people are begging to get out of that
[5:58] fire and because we're heated since we
[5:59] don't know any better I might go
[6:01] someplace in the convent and maybe I'll
[6:03] burn my body real bad maybe I'll torture
[6:06] it some way and spill some more blood
[6:08] because as I suffer I believe they're
[6:10] going to get out of that place where a
[6:11] priest puts them and there are millions
[6:13] of people so to speak in purgatory that
[6:15] your priest have put there and when he
[6:17] knows it is the biggest fraud there is
[6:19] in the world he knows there's not a bit
[6:20] of truth to it and bless your heart I
[6:23] often say you take purgatorian Mass away
[6:24] from the Roman Catholic Church you'll
[6:25] Rob her of nine tents of her living
[6:27] she'll starve to death if you would take
[6:29] it away from her she commercializes not
[6:31] only off of the living but off of the
[6:33] dead and on and on it
[6:36] goes all right it doesn't bother a
[6:39] Mother Superior to take one of those
[6:41] dear little
[6:43] girls and may I say you know when the
[6:45] priest come into the convent they come
[6:46] as our father confessors once a month we
[6:48] go to confession and we don't want to go
[6:51] don't you worry I many the time have got
[6:53] in the very back roll I didn't want to
[6:54] go in there I know who's out there one
[6:56] of them I would may not know the
[6:57] particular man but I know he's a and I
[7:00] know those trees I I certainly have seen
[7:02] them enough I've lived there long enough
[7:04] I I certainly have had contact with
[7:06] every one of them and I'll assure you
[7:08] this one thing I don't trust one single
[7:10] one of those in the convent now we're
[7:11] not telling you about every priest I
[7:13] don't know all the priests I'm just
[7:14] talking about the Convent in my personal
[7:16] testimony of convent life and you know
[7:18] we know something about what's out in
[7:19] that room and here we are we know we're
[7:21] going to confession today it may take
[7:23] all day long and here he comes and I
[7:26] have never seen a Roman Catholic priest
[7:28] come into the convent that I was in
[7:30] without intoxicating liquor under his
[7:32] belt and I say a man or a woman
[7:34] regardless of who you may be when you
[7:36] get liquor under your Bel you're not a
[7:38] man neither are you a woman you become
[7:41] an animal and a beast and so we have a
[7:43] beast sitting out there there's a
[7:44] straight uh back heart bottom chair no
[7:46] other Furniture but the crucifix of the
[7:48] Virgin Mary but here he is sitting on
[7:50] that chair right out there in the middle
[7:51] of that room now here a little girl has
[7:53] to walk out there alone and she has to
[7:55] kneel down think of it why bless your
[7:58] heart I I really sometimes I'm saved now
[8:01] I'm out of the convent and I now look
[8:03] back at that Roman Catholic priest and I
[8:05] often say I'm sure he was a twin brother
[8:07] to the devil because he's full of sin
[8:10] he's full of Vice he's full of
[8:11] corruption and we go out there and kneel
[8:13] down at his knees now are you're a lucky
[8:15] girl if you get away from that man
[8:17] without being destroyed why he's drunk
[8:19] he's a beast he's not a man oh he has a
[8:21] holy habit on he's an ordained Roman
[8:24] Catholic priest and so I'll assure you
[8:25] we don't like to go to confession but we
[8:27] must go once a month and those little
[8:29] girls can't help themselves and nobody
[8:31] comes out out into that room but the
[8:33] priest and I until it's all over and
[8:35] then we can come back and the next one
[8:37] will have to come and I'll assure you we
[8:39] don't appreciate that day and those
[8:40] little girls don't know any better they
[8:42] don't know anything about the Plan of
[8:44] Salvation they don't know that Jesus
[8:45] went to Calvary and died for them they
[8:47] don't know that he shed his blood for
[8:49] them those little girls know nothing
[8:51] about it because to me as I repeat again
[8:54] the Bible was a hidden book to every one
[8:55] of those little girls and so now they
[8:57] can do things like this now if a Roman
[9:00] Catholic priest comes into the convent
[9:02] he may go to the Mother Superior and ask
[9:04] her to permit him to go into the sail
[9:06] where one of the nuns are and you know
[9:08] that mother with her carnal mind and her
[9:10] carnal heart and she's very hard and
[9:12] very carnal and she is the mother many
[9:15] times of many illegitimate children they
[9:16] belong to the priest Andre know she'll
[9:18] take that priest and he's drinking she
[9:20] knows it they bring liquor in with them
[9:22] sometimes some of the nuns will drink
[9:23] with them and the mother usually drinks
[9:24] with them and it's really a terrible
[9:26] place it is not a religious order it
[9:28] does not uh live up to that name
[9:30] whatsoever but here she brings that
[9:31] priest into one of our sales now I
[9:34] wonder if you realize how serious it is
[9:36] uh that Roman Catholic priest he has
[9:38] liquor under his belt we know that but
[9:40] he has a big b strong body he's had
[9:42] three square meters of food every day of
[9:44] his life he can eat all the food that he
[9:46] wants but you know there's a little nun
[9:48] that may have a broken body and she may
[9:50] not have very much strength and what he
[9:53] was e what did he come into that cell
[9:54] for for nothing other than to destroy
[9:57] that little nun I often say I wish the
[9:59] government could walk into a Convent
[10:01] just about the time one of those priests
[10:03] are let in the sail the mother will turn
[10:04] a key on the lock and you're locked in
[10:06] there with that priest now we have no
[10:08] way to defend ourselves and I often say
[10:11] I have had to nurse those little girls
[10:13] I'm an Aran I got my nurses training by
[10:15] going through the tunnel over to the
[10:16] through the hospital uh as I lived in a
[10:19] an open order Convent but may I say uh
[10:21] after that priest is taken out of there
[10:23] if you could look upon the body of that
[10:25] little nun she looks like something
[10:26] you've thrown out in a hug pan and a
[10:28] half a dozen old SS have just mauled
[10:30] that child's body and this is Convent Li
[10:33] I can understand why your priests are
[10:35] calling over the phone every day or two
[10:37] and screaming their heads off because
[10:38] I'm in this city giving this testimony
[10:40] but may I say to you I don't mind if
[10:42] they continue to scream I don't mind
[10:45] what they do I'm not one bit afraid of
[10:46] them I'll continue to give this
[10:48] testimony as long as God gives me
[10:50] strength I'll be giving this testimony
[10:52] regardless of your priests or your
[10:53] Bishops in this country I know what I'm
[10:56] doing I know what I'm saying and I'm not
[10:58] afraid of any body in all of this world
[11:00] I'm a child of God and I believe God
[11:02] won't let anybody put a hand on me until
[11:04] my work is finished and then I often say
[11:06] I don't care what you do to my body
[11:08] after I leave this body I'm sure I don't
[11:11] mind and so I I will continue to give
[11:13] the testimony regardless of what your
[11:15] priest think about it because I I think
[11:17] God saved me to pull the cover off of
[11:19] convent I believe he saved me to uncloak
[11:22] those places that are riding under the
[11:23] cloak of religion I believe that with
[11:25] all of my heart I'll assure you I do
[11:29] now if I refuse to give my body you know
[11:32] we're just supposed to give our bodies
[11:34] voluntarily to those trees many times
[11:36] the nuns are overpowered but if I refuse
[11:38] to give my body voluntarily to them then
[11:40] you know he becomes very angry and he
[11:42] goes immediately to the Mother Superior
[11:44] then when two caral minds come to come
[11:46] together they can invent things that you
[11:48] and I we don't have enough evil in our
[11:50] heart to invent things like that we
[11:52] don't have enough sin in our lives to
[11:53] even think of such terrible things and
[11:55] when those two cardal minds come
[11:57] together uh the next time I want you to
[11:59] know they're all ready now the Mother
[12:01] Superior might say to me in a day or two
[12:02] we're going to do pennis now the pennis
[12:04] that they'll inflict on me is something
[12:06] that the Mother Superior and the priest
[12:07] has invented and it can be very very
[12:09] cruel they might take me down into one
[12:11] of the dirty Dungeons and there's no
[12:13] floors in those places and you know they
[12:15] have uh a place down there there are
[12:17] rods about three feet long they have
[12:19] them a burrow down into cmit and at the
[12:21] top of it there's a ring about this big
[12:22] out sticking out of the ground they have
[12:24] some leather straps fastened there and
[12:26] when they take me down there they put my
[12:28] foot I their foot through go through
[12:30] those rings and then they strapped my
[12:31] ankle securely now I'm standing with my
[12:34] feet in those Rings all right they're
[12:36] going out of there they're going to
[12:38] leave me locked up in that place by
[12:40] myself and it's a dirty Place well I
[12:42] might stand there for two or three hours
[12:44] if I have strength enough in my body but
[12:45] what do you think's going to happen to
[12:46] me then I can't stand any longer
[12:49] sometimes we faint sometimes we just
[12:50] become exhausted and and we go down but
[12:52] when I go down he flips my ankles over
[12:54] like that and I can't do anything about
[12:56] it I don't have what it takes for me to
[12:58] get up I may have to lie in that
[13:00] position for two or three days and no
[13:02] one will come near they won't give me a
[13:04] bite of food they won't bring me one
[13:05] drop of water but I must stay there and
[13:07] the next thing you feel is the bugs
[13:08] crawling over my body and the mice
[13:10] running over me and I still have to stay
[13:12] there I can understand why they don't
[13:14] want me to uncover they don't want the
[13:16] world to know these things are going on
[13:18] no priest in this country wants it and
[13:19] if he doesn't want the these the world
[13:21] to know it then they better be pretty
[13:23] careful that nobody ever gets out of a
[13:25] Convent after they spent a few years
[13:27] back there but may I say again to you my
[13:28] God God he's greater than all the
[13:30] outside forces my God can reach his hand
[13:32] over into those convs this country any
[13:34] other country and make a way for a girl
[13:36] to come out and he won't have to ask the
[13:37] bishop to help him he won't have to ask
[13:39] the priest to help him but God can make
[13:41] a way for us to come out I'll assure you
[13:43] that well on it goes then sometimes the
[13:45] priests come and they get angry at us
[13:47] because we refuse to sin with them
[13:48] voluntarily and you know after all uh
[13:51] the uh the nun's bodies are broken after
[13:53] we're there a while and many many the
[13:55] time to have him strike you in the mouth
[13:57] is a terrible thing I've had my front
[13:59] teeth knocked out I know what it's all
[14:00] about and then we'll get you down on the
[14:02] floor and then kick you in the stomach
[14:04] many of those precious little girls have
[14:06] babies under their heart and it doesn't
[14:08] bother a priest to kick you in the
[14:09] stomach with a baby under your heart he
[14:11] doesn't mind the baby's going to be
[14:12] killed anyway because those babies are
[14:14] born into con why wouldn't babies be
[14:15] born when you run places like this under
[14:18] the cloak of religion the world thinks
[14:19] it's religious orders and there are
[14:20] babies born in Dale and most of the
[14:23] babies are premature many of them are
[14:24] abnormal very very seldom do we ever see
[14:27] a normal baby you say sister sh do you
[14:30] dare to say that I most definitely do
[14:32] dare to say this and I intend to keep on
[14:34] saying it why I've delivered those
[14:36] babies with these hands and what I've
[14:37] seen with my eyes and I've done with my
[14:39] hands I just challenge the whole world
[14:41] to say it isn't true and the only way
[14:43] they can ever prove it isn't true
[14:45] they'll have to open if they ever serve
[14:46] a summons on me and call me into court
[14:48] I'll assure you this one thing convents
[14:50] are coming open and then the world is
[14:52] going to know what convents really are
[14:54] and they'll have to open them to
[14:56] vindicate my testimony because I know
[14:58] what I'll do if they ever serve a
[14:59] summons on me I've been before the
[15:01] highest laws we have in the United
[15:02] States I know what I'm doing I know what
[15:04] I can say and I'm not one bit afraid to
[15:06] say it because I've been a part of this
[15:08] I've been connected with this system 22
[15:10] years behind Convent doors and it is a
[15:12] terrible thing after when that dear
[15:14] little gun looking forward to that day
[15:17] when her precious baby will be born most
[15:19] of you dear mothers oh you have
[15:21] everything ready the beautiful Nursery
[15:24] all the baby's beautiful clothes are
[15:26] made everything is lovely you're looking
[15:28] forward to that that precious little
[15:29] Immortal soul is going to be born into
[15:32] your home and everything is ready and oh
[15:35] I wish you could see that little nun
[15:37] she's not looking forward to that there
[15:39] won't ever be a blanket around his body
[15:41] they'll never even they'll never bathe
[15:43] the B that baby's body but he can only
[15:45] leave four or five hours and then the
[15:47] Mother Superior will take that baby and
[15:48] put her fingers in its nostril and still
[15:50] cover its mouth and snuff his little
[15:51] life out and why did they build the lime
[15:54] pitch in the convent what is the reason
[15:56] for building them if it isn't to to kill
[15:57] the babies and that baby will be taken
[15:59] into the line pit and chemical and line
[16:01] is put over its body and that's the end
[16:03] of babies oh when I think about it
[16:05] that's why I try to challenge people
[16:07] pray if you know how to pray you know
[16:09] how to contact God pray and ask God to
[16:11] deliver the con girls from behind
[16:13] Convent doors in other words pray that
[16:15] God will make a way for every Convent in
[16:16] the United States to be opened and let
[16:18] the government go in and when the
[16:20] government goes in you won't have to
[16:22] worry the convents will be open the nuns
[16:24] will be taken out and they'll be closed
[16:26] up just as they opened the convents in
[16:28] Old Mexico so in 1934 there are no
[16:30] convents in Old Mexico every cluster it
[16:33] is open and they found all of the
[16:34] corruption back there the lime pit if
[16:36] any of you are taking a vacation go over
[16:38] into Old Mexico the P the government
[16:40] owns them their public museums and go
[16:42] through the convi look with your own
[16:43] eyes touch with your own hands and then
[16:45] come home and see if you believe my
[16:47] testimony it'll stir every bit of red
[16:49] blood in your veins I mean it'll do
[16:51] something to you that nothing else has
[16:52] ever been able to do go through them and
[16:55] look at them go into the D dungeons go
[16:57] into the tunnels go through the here
[16:59] look at the skulls rooms of skulls over
[17:01] there and then ask the Guides of where
[17:03] they come from and go and see the all of
[17:06] the devices of torture they placed upon
[17:07] the bodies of the little nuns go into
[17:09] their their cells and look at their beds
[17:11] and see for yourself oh yes you can go
[17:13] it'll cost you 25 cents to go through
[17:15] each one of them you look at those
[17:17] things and see them for yourself and
[17:18] then come home and maybe it'll give you
[17:20] a greater burden to pray for little
[17:21] girls that have been enticed behind
[17:23] Convent Doors by the hierarchy of the
[17:25] Roman Catholic
[17:27] Church I wonder how you would feel if
[17:30] this was your child and remember I have
[17:32] a mother and daddy or had one and they
[17:35] love me just as much as you love your
[17:37] children and when they let me go into
[17:39] the convent I'm sure my mother and daddy
[17:41] didn't expect these things to happen
[17:42] because they didn't know they never
[17:44] dreamed a Convent was like this but you
[17:46] know I wonder how you'd feel if you
[17:48] could walk in someday and out there in
[17:50] this particular room that floor is built
[17:52] for this purpose there's a a petition
[17:56] right out there and there's just a
[17:58] little the thing they can touch it
[18:00] automatically opens and you know there's
[18:03] a deep hole underneath that floor and
[18:05] this little nun has done something I
[18:07] can't tell you what she's done because I
[18:10] wasn't there when she done it but she's
[18:11] done something and to them it's very
[18:14] serious and when they bring her they
[18:16] bring her to this particular place her
[18:18] little hands and feet are going to be
[18:20] bound securely they're going to drop her
[18:22] in that horrible horrible pit and then
[18:25] they're going to put the boards back
[18:26] down no one will ever know oh there's
[18:28] plenty of chemical and line down there
[18:30] but you know they don't do that six
[18:32] little nuns have to walk around that
[18:33] hole we'll chant as we walk around that
[18:36] hole we don't want any evil spirits to
[18:38] come out into the convent so we sprinkle
[18:40] holy water over that hole that we may
[18:42] walk for six hours and then they'll
[18:44] appoint six more nuns and on and on it
[18:46] goes until we have hear the last moan
[18:49] and that's the end of the little nun
[18:50] they place down there no she'll never be
[18:52] delivered from the convi but does it
[18:54] bother you to know that that little nun
[18:56] will die and be lost does that bother
[18:58] you
[19:01] it bothers me because I didn't know
[19:04] Jesus I couldn't tell her about God I
[19:07] didn't know him myself but it bothers me
[19:09] very very much but God won't hold me
[19:11] accountable her blood will not be on my
[19:12] hands because I didn't know the Lord and
[19:14] I couldn't tell her about it and so on
[19:16] it goes then I wonder how you like to
[19:17] see it here we are a body of those
[19:20] little nuns on this particular morning
[19:21] the Mother Superior might sa is we're
[19:23] all going to be lined up here and I
[19:25] don't know what she's lining me up for
[19:26] and then you know there might be Ken of
[19:28] us there might be 15 of us and then she
[19:29] tell us all to strip and we have to take
[19:32] every Stitch of our clothing off we're
[19:34] certainly not anything beautiful to look
[19:36] at our eyes are back in our head our
[19:38] cheeks are falling in our bodies are
[19:39] wasted God only knows what we look like
[19:42] because I never saw myself in 22 years I
[19:44] didn't know I had gray hair I didn't
[19:46] know I had lines in my face I didn't
[19:48] know how old I was I only found that out
[19:50] about six years ago you know nothing
[19:52] about what you look like and here we are
[19:54] lined up and here comes two or three
[19:56] Roman Catholic priests with liquor under
[19:58] their failed and there they're going to
[20:00] march in front of those nud girls and
[20:02] choose the girl they want to take to the
[20:03] sail with them these are convs clustered
[20:06] convin not open
[20:08] orders the priest can do anything he
[20:10] wants to in hide behind the cloak of
[20:12] religion then that same Roman Catholic
[20:14] priest will go back into the Roman
[20:16] Catholic churches and there he'll say
[20:18] mess and there he'll go into the
[20:20] confessional box and make those poor
[20:22] people believing can give them
[20:24] Absolution from their sin when he's full
[20:26] of sin when he's full of corruption and
[20:29] vice still he acts as their God what a
[20:31] terrible thing it is and all it goes
[20:33] well I live there now all the time these
[20:35] things are going on what you think's
[20:36] happening inside of Charlotte God love
[20:38] your hearts I didn't know people could
[20:39] hold so much hatred and bitterness and
[20:41] it went on and on and on I was filled
[20:43] with bitterness and hatred and I mean it
[20:45] continued to Bild I began in my heart to
[20:48] think when I can get the Mother Superior
[20:50] in a certain place I'll kill her isn't
[20:52] it awful to get murder in our hearts I
[20:54] didn't go in the convent with a heart
[20:56] like that nor a mind like that but I be
[20:58] began to plan murder in the convy how I
[21:01] could kill her how I could kill a Roman
[21:02] Catholic priest and on and on it goes
[21:04] and oh I tell you every time she did fix
[21:06] something awful on my body that I'd have
[21:08] to suffer so terribly when I could think
[21:10] sensibly again then I would begin to
[21:11] plan how could I kill that woman and on
[21:14] it goes well after all you can't help it
[21:16] for instance I wonder how you would feel
[21:18] the Mother Superior here she is and
[21:20] she's going to sit me down in a chair
[21:22] and you know H that chair is a straight
[21:24] back hard bottom and I I don't have any
[21:27] hair she's going to take care of things
[21:28] off my head and you know she's going to
[21:30] put my hands like this they'll be out
[21:32] here in stocks I'm going to have to bend
[21:34] my head over like that in order to put
[21:35] the stalks across my neck and I'm
[21:37] fastened securely and over my head there
[21:39] is a faucet of water and you
[21:42] know sorry there is a faucet of water
[21:44] just above my head and my head's over
[21:46] now that Mother's going to turn that
[21:48] water on just a drop and the drop will
[21:50] just come about this fast it'll hit me
[21:52] right there on the back of my head and
[21:54] you know I can't move either way I sat
[21:57] there one hour two hours three hours
[21:58] four hours what you think's going on I'm
[22:00] sitting there I can't move I do
[22:02] everything to get away from that drop of
[22:04] water in the same spot on my head why
[22:06] God love your heart if you could look in
[22:08] you'd see us rooing at the mouth you'd
[22:10] see those little girls they're trying so
[22:12] hard to move to get away from that water
[22:15] and they let us stay there sometimes 10
[22:17] hours all day long many many times a
[22:20] little none crack some cups cracks up
[22:23] completely she goes Stark raving mad
[22:25] under this particular pennant what in
[22:27] the world do they do with her I tell you
[22:29] in a few minutes don't you worry they
[22:30] have a place for us after we go mad in
[22:33] the convent they take care of us they
[22:35] have places for the little nuns there's
[22:37] places built down there far well on it
[22:39] goes well you know these things went on
[22:40] and went on and went on and it was
[22:42] terrible but you know I began to plan
[22:43] and plan and playing after she's done
[22:45] something like that to me it's terrible
[22:47] one day the Mother Superior took
[22:49] violently ill you say who would take her
[22:53] place there are about three sometimes
[22:56] they have four older nuns and they
[22:58] always pick the one that's hard the one
[23:00] that seem as seemingly as carnal that
[23:03] one that has no conscience To Be A
[23:04] Mother Superior and she works under this
[23:06] one one day if something happens to the
[23:08] main Mother Superior another one will
[23:10] take her place and on it goes but you
[23:12] know this time particular day they sent
[23:14] word to me the Mother Superior I was to
[23:17] come into her room she's very sick and
[23:19] quick as en lightening I began to think
[23:22] if I got in that mother superior's
[23:24] room I know what I'll do you know after
[23:27] all I'm a sinner
[23:29] I'm a nun but I'm a sinner and I don't
[23:31] know God and I have a lot of hatred in
[23:33] my heart and I walk in that room they
[23:35] have called in an outside Roman Catholic
[23:37] doctor she's a very sick woman and he
[23:39] has left all orders and they left the
[23:41] medicine and everything now I'm supposed
[23:43] to take care of her and that was
[23:45] wonderful and I do take care of her all
[23:47] day long I did what they told me to do
[23:49] what I'm supposed to do and those
[23:51] particular tablets I knew what they were
[23:52] and I knew what they would do and what
[23:53] she was thinking them for but anyway all
[23:55] day long I gave her her medicine I done
[23:57] everything I'm supposed to all evening
[23:59] long why I want to be sure what I'm
[24:02] doing what I do I have to be careful and
[24:04] you know I waited until uh 1:00 in the
[24:07] morning why because every night those
[24:10] little nuns have to be gotten out of bed
[24:11] and go chant from 1 or from 1200 to 1 7
[24:13] minutes at 12 to one I thought I'll wait
[24:15] all the nuns go back to bed then I'm
[24:17] going to do something and bless your
[24:18] hearts after they were all back in their
[24:20] beds I'll tell you what I did I took
[24:23] five or six of those tablets I was only
[24:24] supposed to take one in a half a glass
[24:27] of water ever so long and give it to her
[24:30] but because of the type they were and
[24:31] what the type of uh tablet was I knew
[24:33] what it would do I put six of them in
[24:36] the glass of water and stirred them up
[24:38] and I gave them to her I knew she would
[24:39] go into convulsions it would twist her
[24:41] completely out of shape I knew that
[24:43] woman would suffer a million deaths
[24:45] within 25 minutes on knew that and I
[24:48] thought I'm going to watch her suffer
[24:50] because she has punished us she has hurt
[24:52] us so many thousands of times I'll watch
[24:55] her suffer isn't it terrible to think a
[24:57] child can be live living a place like
[24:58] that long enough until she has the same
[25:00] kind of a heart almost the Mother
[25:02] Superior has but that's what comes When
[25:04] sin gets in your life and so I waited
[25:06] you know I gave them to her and I
[25:08] something happened to me I got scared
[25:09] and I looked at that moment and she
[25:11] began to change color and I couldn't
[25:13] find her P I couldn't find her
[25:14] respiration I was frightened and I
[25:16] thought oh what shall I do if they find
[25:17] her dead only God knows what they'll do
[25:19] to me I'll tell you what I did I got
[25:21] that stomach punk I pump as quick as I
[25:23] could I pumped that woman's stomach I'm
[25:25] a s that woman I done everything there
[25:26] was to do oh thank God she didn't die I
[25:30] said I thank God but you know I sat down
[25:32] by the bed and held her hand and watched
[25:33] her carefully until the restoration came
[25:36] back normal until her pulse was normal
[25:38] and I felt she would live and I thought
[25:40] of another thing I'll do this then I saw
[25:42] where her keys were hid in her shelf
[25:43] right there in her own room so they're
[25:45] on a big chain or on a big ring and I
[25:47] thought I'm going to take those keys I'm
[25:48] going down into that dungeon there's a
[25:50] when I say down this is two stories
[25:52] under the ground I I'm going someplace
[25:54] where she's always wanders it's a solid
[25:56] wall like that and clear to the back end
[25:58] of that wall there's one door and it's
[26:00] heavy and it's always locked and I've
[26:02] heard her tell me scores of times and
[26:03] I'm sure she has the others don't ever
[26:05] try to go through that door what in the
[26:07] world is over there and why did she tell
[26:09] us that we can't get through it it's
[26:11] locked but you know I wondered what was
[26:12] back there because when they had me in
[26:14] the dungeon for a long time once I heard
[26:16] screams under the ground I heard such
[26:18] blood curdling screams and I knew there
[26:20] were some girls locked up somewhere and
[26:22] so I'm going through there if I find the
[26:23] key and so I got her keys and I went
[26:25] into that particular place and when I
[26:27] got back there it took a while to do it
[26:28] I watch you know to find the key but all
[26:30] when didn't unlock that door I walk
[26:32] through that door and I walk into a hall
[26:34] the hall I would say was maybe five feet
[26:36] wide maybe wider than that that's just a
[26:38] a gas and anyway uh on the other side of
[26:41] the hall there were a number of sails
[26:43] over there small rooms and they had real
[26:45] heavy doors and in those cells were
[26:48] little nuns and when I went up to the
[26:50] first one uh near the top of the door
[26:51] there's a little place about this long
[26:53] it's about that wide it has iron bars
[26:54] going across there and I looked right
[26:56] into the face of a little nun that I
[26:58] knew knew one that I'd sit across the
[27:00] table from one that I prayed with in the
[27:02] chapel I knew that girl and here she is
[27:04] and they had chains and log chains
[27:05] around either of her wrist and around
[27:07] her waistline and I said when did you
[27:09] have something to eat last and no answer
[27:11] how long you been here no answer I went
[27:13] down to the second the third the fourth
[27:15] the fifth and the stench was getting so
[27:16] bad I couldn't stand it and you know
[27:18] those little girls would not talk
[27:20] why I lived in the convent you know a
[27:23] long time and every I don't care if I
[27:26] was two miles under the convent way back
[27:28] there we were working back there and we
[27:30] whisper the next day I'd have to suffer
[27:33] because the convents are wired and the
[27:36] Mother Superior can hear every voice
[27:39] every whisper and then somebody tails
[27:41] and you're in some serious trouble and
[27:43] those none has been there long enough
[27:45] what have they done I don't know but
[27:47] those nuns supposed to have cracked up
[27:48] mentally and so they have put them in
[27:50] those chains and when they die they
[27:52] can't fall down to the floor they're
[27:54] just dropping those chains and slump
[27:55] when they go in there they don't give
[27:56] them any more food no more water that's
[27:58] a slow down and so I as I saw all of
[28:01] that I became so sick from the terrible
[28:04] Stitch because many of them are already
[28:06] dead I don't know how long they've been
[28:08] dead I came out of there and walked back
[28:09] up to this room where the mother Saia
[28:11] was and she was lying there sleeping and
[28:13] I watched her carefully and she slept
[28:15] till her the next day a long long hours
[28:18] and didn't waken and when she did she
[28:20] said I've had a long sleep and I said
[28:21] yes they let me take care of her for
[28:23] three days and you know the third day I
[28:25] don't know you say did she ever find out
[28:26] she was down there well not yet
[28:29] I hope she didn't while I was there but
[28:31] anyway at three days they put me out in
[28:32] the kitchen uh in other words when we go
[28:34] to the kitchen six of us go for a six
[28:37] weeks period and this particular time
[28:39] they put me out in the kitchen with five
[28:41] other little nuns what am I there for
[28:42] I'm doing the kitchen work I'm going to
[28:44] do all the cooking that's done out there
[28:45] and take care of the the work in the
[28:46] kitchen and so when I went out in the
[28:48] kitchen we have a long table back here
[28:50] and it's a work table and our vegetables
[28:53] will be be prepared for the soup and
[28:54] that's what we were doing all six of us
[28:56] and something happened our kitchen is a
[28:58] very large room and a very long room not
[29:01] as wide as it is long and over one end
[29:02] of it you will find over here the stair
[29:04] steps leading about four of them leading
[29:06] down then there's a landing right there
[29:08] over there's a big heavy outside door
[29:10] but here there's a landing our garbage
[29:11] can sit there and right here is a
[29:13] Stairway cement one leading down one
[29:15] story under the ground now I'm up on
[29:17] first floor in this kitchen all right as
[29:19] I'm in there and we're there working
[29:21] something happen somebody catched a
[29:23] garbage can you know all my Convent life
[29:25] we are taught never to break silence we
[29:27] don't dare to make noises in the convent
[29:29] we are punished for them and when
[29:30] something touched the garbage can that's
[29:32] a noise and who in the world sixs of us
[29:34] and we're all together who's touching
[29:35] the garbage can I wheeled around and
[29:37] they wheeled around and we saw a man I
[29:39] don't you know that man was picking up
[29:41] the full can leaving an empty one I've
[29:44] never seen that before I've been in that
[29:45] Convent for years but I and in the
[29:47] kitchen but I never saw anything like
[29:48] that happen I believe God had his hand
[29:50] on me with all my heart I believe it and
[29:53] you say what happened well and we turned
[29:55] around quickly because to us it's a
[29:57] martal sin to look upon a man other than
[29:59] a Roman cathic priest and I mean we
[30:00] turned around quick and went to our work
[30:02] but you know I thought if that man comes
[30:04] back again to get another Pool can I'm
[30:07] going to give him a note and I'm going
[30:08] to ask him if I can run out with him but
[30:09] I didn't do that but you know what I did
[30:11] when we run out of something in the
[30:12] kitchen there's a pencil hanging up
[30:14] there on the chain and bless your heart
[30:15] I have to whoever it is runs out you
[30:17] have to write it on a tab and of course
[30:20] I stole a piece of paper off of a sack
[30:22] and I thought I'll carry that little
[30:23] piece of paper in my spirit pocket and
[30:25] every time I can get a hold of that
[30:27] pencil I'm going to write a word or two
[30:28] on a note and that's what I did it took
[30:30] quite a while to do it but oh I watched
[30:32] that garbage can every time I could take
[30:34] the garbage down there I did it and you
[30:36] know when it was just about full and I
[30:37] thought the next evening it'll be full
[30:39] when we put all the garbage in it and so
[30:41] the that afternoon I broke my crucifix
[30:43] and I laid it up on a shelf and I had a
[30:45] hard time doing it because they're
[30:46] watching me but I did it and I laid it
[30:48] up on a shelf and I did that to have a
[30:50] way to get back to that uh room of
[30:52] course and so I uh when our dinner work
[30:55] is over our suppar dishes everybody has
[30:57] to go out at the time and we marched by
[30:59] the Mother Superior and you know when I
[31:01] marched by I stopped and said please may
[31:02] I speak to you and I did and I said
[31:05] Mother Superior I broke my crucifix and
[31:07] I left it in the kitchen may I go for it
[31:09] and of course no none goes without her
[31:11] crucifix and she said how did you break
[31:13] it I lied to her everything she asked me
[31:15] I lied to her uh you say why did you lie
[31:18] she lies to us and we're all Sinners so
[31:21] we all lie and it doesn't make any
[31:23] difference in there and so we lied and I
[31:26] lied to her and then finally she said
[31:27] you go get the crucifix and come right
[31:29] back and that's all I wanted anyway I
[31:31] have to have a reason you can't go back
[31:32] to the kitchen after you've left it and
[31:34] so I didn't go for the crucifix but she
[31:35] thought I did and I run for this uh 10
[31:37] can why that night when I put my garbage
[31:40] in there I put a note right on top of
[31:42] that garbage and left the lid off which
[31:43] I was not supposed to do and you know I
[31:46] said on the note to the garbage man if
[31:47] you get this won't you please help me
[31:50] out won't you do something to help the
[31:52] little nuns out I told him about those
[31:53] 19 cells down there and those 19 nuns
[31:56] any I told him about some of the baby
[31:57] that have been killed I told him some
[31:59] other little nuns that are locked up in
[32:00] the Dungeons and they're bound with
[32:01] chains I told him of Plenty and I said
[32:03] won't you help us and if you will please
[32:05] leave a note under the empty can that's
[32:07] what I went back for and when I lifted
[32:09] up the can and found a note you don't
[32:10] know how I felt I froze to the floor I
[32:12] was so scared I didn't know what to do I
[32:14] picked that piece of paper up and I read
[32:16] and this is what that man said I'm
[32:17] leaving that door unlocked and I leave
[32:19] the big iron gate unlocked you come out
[32:22] oh let me tell you that's almost more
[32:24] than you D well I never dreamed I'd get
[32:26] out of a Convent I never thought of
[32:27] everything getting out I wanted out but
[32:29] you say h oh yes I when I could collect
[32:32] myself I reached over and turned the
[32:33] knob and you know it was UN open I
[32:35] walked out of that Convent and I slammed
[32:37] it too I was sure the lock was on it and
[32:39] I got out to the Big Iron Gate but oh he
[32:41] had me
[32:42] trapped that Iron Gate was just as
[32:44] locked as it was ever locked you don't
[32:46] know what it done for me to stand there
[32:47] looking at the Iron Gate I'm locked out
[32:49] of the convent I have no right out there
[32:51] you can't imagine I don't know if I grew
[32:53] old right there I don't know I know I
[32:55] suffered enough because I'm scared after
[32:56] death and what will I do if I go back
[32:58] and pound on that door what will they do
[33:00] with me and all the fear that grips your
[33:01] heart AR you say what'd you do I didn't
[33:03] have any shoes and stockings on I'd wore
[33:05] those out years ago when I think of the
[33:06] Roman Catholic Church being the richest
[33:08] Church in the world and they let those
[33:09] little nuns go winter and summer without
[33:11] any shoes and uh without any hose living
[33:14] in crucial poverty I wonder how they can
[33:16] do
[33:17] it hungry as we are your priests are all
[33:20] nice and
[33:21] fat the little nuns are so hungry I
[33:24] wonder how they do it sometimes you say
[33:26] what did you do Charlotte well I'll tell
[33:28] you I just took a hold of that big old
[33:29] iron gauge and I tried to climb it
[33:31] that's all there was for me to do and up
[33:33] about a foot and a half from the top is
[33:34] a ledge about 6 Ines wide I thought if I
[33:37] could get high enough to get my knee on
[33:38] the ledge I'm safe and I did I got one
[33:41] knee on the ledge but but this time I
[33:42] don't have any strength left over and
[33:44] you know I thought what do I do I I'll
[33:46] put one foot over then I'll get the
[33:47] other over then I realized you know I
[33:49] have three skirts on my skirts are
[33:51] gathered on the belts and they're clear
[33:52] down to my ankles my veil of course is
[33:54] down to my knees in front and that long
[33:55] in the back how will I ever get over
[33:57] those sharp points and I thought I can't
[33:59] go down I don't have strength enough so
[34:01] I'll have to jump and if I jump I'll
[34:03] break every bone because I was broken
[34:05] body of course and you know I thought I
[34:07] do well I I pulled all my clothing up
[34:09] around my body and held them with one
[34:11] hand and then I thought I'd have to jump
[34:14] and you know they have a buzzer in the
[34:16] convent and when a little nun tries to
[34:17] escape and they catch her they put a
[34:19] buzzer on and oh it's the priest tell
[34:21] you they don't come to the convent I
[34:23] would you could see the priest then
[34:25] you'll find a good many of them there
[34:27] and they immedately hour after that none
[34:29] they don't want her out if she comes out
[34:31] of that Convent she's going to give a
[34:32] testimony someday and it'll pull the
[34:34] cloak off of convent and I'll assure you
[34:36] they don't intend Force to get out and
[34:38] so I as I let loose to that uh top of
[34:41] that gate and I made that jump I just
[34:43] didn't make it my clothing caught on top
[34:45] of those points and I hung there but I'd
[34:46] let loose and I often say you know I
[34:49] don't know what I look like I don't know
[34:51] I didn't know I had gray hair but I've
[34:52] often said maybe my hair turned gray
[34:54] there maybe you'll never know what I
[34:56] suffered hanging on top of that gate
[34:58] knowing that buzzer can go on any minute
[34:59] and then what would they do to me I was
[35:01] scared so I thought I tried to wiggle my
[35:03] body and to for swing it if I can get
[35:05] back far enough to grab the gate with
[35:07] one hand maybe I can help myself and I
[35:09] did and then with the other hand I tried
[35:11] to pry the Snappers loose on my skirt
[35:13] and that let me fall between them do you
[35:15] know what happened to me I hit the
[35:17] ground I was out I was unconscious for a
[35:19] while I don't know how long no we have
[35:21] no way to tell but when I came to I had
[35:23] a shoulder broken and my arm was broken
[35:25] right in here the fles the Bon it's
[35:27] right through my flesh because I didn't
[35:29] have any meat on me and I thought what
[35:31] do I do and I I realize I'm on the
[35:32] outside and where am I going where do
[35:35] you think you'd go I'm not in the United
[35:37] States I'm in another country and I
[35:39] don't know thing about that country when
[35:40] they took me over there I was heavily
[35:42] veiled and they took me from the that
[35:44] particular car or train to the cony I
[35:46] was heavily bailed I couldn't see
[35:48] anything and I don't know where I am I
[35:50] don't know where to go I don't know if I
[35:51] have any people I don't know if I know
[35:53] anybody in the world now I'm a puffer I
[35:55] don't have any money and I I'm hungry
[35:57] and my body's broken and I'm hurt now
[35:59] where do you think you go I tell you
[36:01] with something to think about I just
[36:03] started away but get away from the
[36:04] convent and I did and I started moving
[36:06] away and all the leaves were falling and
[36:08] they made so much noise and I was scared
[36:10] and I kept on moving and finally dark
[36:12] overtook me air or rather there's no
[36:14] Twilight in that part of the country it
[36:15] just drops off into darkness and you
[36:17] know I saw this with a building beside
[36:18] the road and I I thought I'll crawl in
[36:20] it with a dogghouse or maybe Chicken
[36:22] Coop or something but it was dirty and I
[36:23] crawled in there because I was shaking
[36:25] and scared and I laid in there for a
[36:27] little while to get a hold of myself and
[36:29] then I thought I'll have to travel it's
[36:30] dark it's safer for me so I got out and
[36:32] travel that night and the next day I hid
[36:34] behind pieces of board and Tin that was
[36:36] piled up against an old building and all
[36:38] day long imagine hiding in that hot
[36:40] place and hungry as I was with broken
[36:42] bones do you realize what it was all
[36:44] about no you'll never know but I do and
[36:47] then you know when night came again I
[36:48] have to go because I'm going to get away
[36:50] from the cony I'm afraid to rrap on
[36:51] somebody's door remember I'm scared I
[36:54] don't know I might wrap on a Roman
[36:56] catholic's door they will immed Ely un
[36:58] notifying the priest and I'll be taken
[36:59] back to the convent and I'd rather they
[37:01] kill me than take me back and so I
[37:03] didn't but I went on and on and on and
[37:05] then the next night or next day I hit
[37:07] out in an old STW Stag and then that
[37:09] afternoon on the third day I was scared
[37:11] then because this arm had swollen as
[37:13] tight as it could SP well I was having
[37:15] to carry it in the other hand and all my
[37:17] fingers began to turn blue and I
[37:19] realized garine poisoning setting in and
[37:21] you know I nobody to do anything for you
[37:23] and I realize I'm going to die just like
[37:25] a rat beside the road that's a terrible
[37:27] feeling and I thought what do I do I'll
[37:30] just get out and go a little sooner
[37:31] maybe I'll have to wrap on somebody's
[37:32] door and that's what I did I remember as
[37:35] I walked I don't know how far I saw this
[37:37] lamp it was an oldfashioned lamp burning
[37:39] very poor house no paint on it and I
[37:41] knew those were poor people so I walked
[37:43] up to the screen door and I wrapped on
[37:45] it and a tall man came to the door he
[37:47] was rather old and I said please may I
[37:49] have a drink of water and you know that
[37:51] old man didn't answer me but he walked
[37:52] back in the house and called his wife
[37:54] and God bless her heart she's like most
[37:56] oldfashioned mother she came to the door
[37:58] and she didn't say who are you and what
[38:00] do you want thank God there are a lot of
[38:03] good people in this
[38:05] world that dear little woman just pushed
[38:07] that door open and said won't you come
[38:09] in and sit down do you know that's the
[38:10] most beautiful music I've ever heard in
[38:12] my life I should say I'll come in and
[38:14] sit down and she pulled out a
[38:17] chair and I sat down on it glad to sit
[38:20] down and you know the house was poor
[38:22] there was no rugs on the floor of any Ty
[38:24] a tablecloth red checkered tablecloth on
[38:26] the table and little old sto over there
[38:27] in the corner and there was a fire in it
[38:29] and that woman put some uh uh milk in a
[38:31] pan and heat it and brought it over to
[38:32] me and you know I'm hungry I don't have
[38:35] any manners I forgot how to act I forgot
[38:38] a lot of things in 22 years and I
[38:40] grabbed that glass of milk on before she
[38:42] ever set it down and I gobbled it down
[38:44] I'm so hungry I felt like I'm going St
[38:47] mad and I took it instantly and the
[38:49] moment it touched my stomach of course I
[38:50] couldn't retain it I lost it I haven't
[38:52] had any whole milk in 22 years you could
[38:55] understand why I couldn't take it and
[38:56] she knew why to do she went out in the
[38:58] kitchen she heated some water or rather
[39:00] over to the stove and heated some water
[39:03] and left her heart she put the sugar in
[39:04] that water and brought it over to me and
[39:06] she sat down and gave it to me from a
[39:08] spoon I took every bit of it oh it was
[39:12] good it was
[39:13] nourishing and then the daddy walked
[39:15] over by me and he said now tell us who
[39:17] you are and where'd you come
[39:19] from I began to cry I was scared then I
[39:23] said I run away from the convent and I'm
[39:24] not going back and I he said what
[39:27] happened to you and my hand was laying
[39:28] up the table and I said well I tried to
[39:31] get over the gate and I fail and I'm
[39:33] hurt and you know he said we'll have to
[39:35] call a doctor and bless your sweet life
[39:38] then I really became hysterical I got up
[39:40] from the table I was going to run back
[39:41] outside and they wouldn't let me he said
[39:43] wait a minute we're not going to hurt
[39:45] you you hurt you have to have help I
[39:47] said I don't have any money and I don't
[39:48] have any people and I can't pay a doctor
[39:51] bill course I was just I was just in a
[39:54] terrible mess if you want to know it and
[39:56] that man said said to me I'm going after
[39:58] a
[39:59] doctor he said and he's not a Roman
[40:02] Catholic neither am I that dear man
[40:04] didn't have a car and he start a h and
[40:06] bugging he drove nine miles to get a
[40:08] doctor the doctor came out in his car
[40:11] and when he got out to the place he got
[40:12] there ahead of the man and when the
[40:14] doctor walked in and walked around me he
[40:16] just kept walk around me and he was
[40:17] swearing maybe he didn't realize was a
[40:20] terrible effect on me when he stopped
[40:23] and looked at
[40:24] me of course he was mad
[40:28] he was mad why was he mad he was mad
[40:30] because he was looking at something was
[40:32] supposed to be a human being and I
[40:34] didn't even look like a human being
[40:35] being I was in such a horrible condition
[40:38] but finally he calmed down he came over
[40:40] to me and he said I'll have to take you
[40:41] to the hospital tonight oh I became
[40:44] hysterical I said I don't want to go
[40:46] please don't make me go and then he sat
[40:48] down carefully and took my hands and he
[40:50] began to say I'm not going to hurt you
[40:52] you have to have help and I want to help
[40:54] you that doctor took me into the
[40:56] hospital that night and that's where I
[40:57] learned how much a weigh he weighed me
[40:59] and I weighed exactly 89 lb I weigh 178
[41:03] right now and then you know they took me
[41:05] into surgery and of course they tried to
[41:07] get the swelling and the inflammation
[41:08] out of my hand and arm that they might
[41:10] do something for me it took about 12 13
[41:12] days and then of course they had it but
[41:14] this time it started to knit and they
[41:15] had all to break over it again and put
[41:16] it in a cast I did a lot of suffering
[41:18] well you know one day that a way was
[41:20] made for me to be released from the
[41:22] hospital who did they release me
[41:24] to I begged to go out to those old
[41:26] people to stay with and they let me go
[41:28] because they' been good to me and I
[41:30] trusted them and the doctor wanted to
[41:32] take me out to his home I was in that
[41:33] hospital 3 and a half months and they
[41:35] took me out there and I stayed for a
[41:36] period of time and then one day the same
[41:39] doctor he wrote a letter and you know
[41:41] what he sent in that letter uh letter he
[41:44] sent a m a check he told the people to
[41:46] go and buy me a suitcase and get me some
[41:49] clothing he was coming for me on a
[41:51] certain day he had told me I'm going to
[41:53] find your people for me you know that
[41:55] doctor's a stranger to me but oh I thank
[41:58] God that he has men and women across
[42:01] this world and those men and women are
[42:03] not so selfish that they want use some
[42:06] of the money that God has allowed them
[42:08] to have have uh to help that one that's
[42:10] less fortunate than the day he he spent
[42:13] a lot of money on me I was in the
[42:15] hospital three and a half months and I
[42:16] mean that there was a lot of money spent
[42:18] on me but he paid the bills I appreciate
[42:20] it and you know that dear doctor oh they
[42:22] took me bought my clothing for me got my
[42:24] suitcase and everything was ready and
[42:26] the day came when he come and you know
[42:27] that doctor took me to the train and he
[42:30] put me on a train in care of somebody of
[42:32] course he had found my people for me I
[42:34] was on buses and trains and boats for a
[42:36] long time and one day oh after there he
[42:39] had gotten my Visa to get back into the
[42:40] United States and I was always in charge
[42:42] of somebody because they wouldn't trust
[42:44] me to travel alone because of having
[42:45] lived under the ground so long and one
[42:48] day they called the name of the town
[42:49] where I was or where my Mother and Daddy
[42:51] lived don't you know I knew where Mother
[42:53] and Daddy lived and I got off of that
[42:54] train and run down to their home five
[42:56] blocks in that Depot just a very small
[42:58] town and when I rang the bell my daddy
[43:01] come to the door and you know I I looked
[43:04] at his face I didn't know him and I
[43:06] because I didn't know him I said do you
[43:08] know where my father lives and he said
[43:09] who are you and what's your name and I
[43:11] said my name and I didn't give him my
[43:13] church name I gave him my family name
[43:15] and that man looked at me and of course
[43:17] it was his name and he said hookie is
[43:19] this you my father didn't know me of
[43:21] course it was my dad now dear old man
[43:24] opened the door then and invited me in
[43:25] and I said dad is Mother alive because I
[43:27] didn't know about her and he took me
[43:29] back in to see her and there she was 7
[43:31] and a half years she' laid there an
[43:32] invilet a horrible horrible envolent and
[43:35] of course she didn't know me and I
[43:36] didn't know her well didn't know that
[43:38] very night I took violently sick and
[43:39] they put me back in another hospital for
[43:40] another three months but my father paid
[43:42] all of those bills he reimbursed the
[43:44] doctor and paid the doctor in another
[43:45] country and paid the old people he
[43:47] reimbursed them all all of that was
[43:49] wonderful then you know one day after my
[43:51] body was strong enough since I'm here in
[43:52] the United States or it took a long time
[43:54] several years I'm a nurse and I took the
[43:57] examination to nurse and you know what
[43:59] God did he let a woman come into that
[44:01] particular hospital it was a Roman
[44:03] Catholic Hospital this woman was a
[44:06] Church of God
[44:08] Minister she came in and I thought how
[44:11] strange just across the Mississippi
[44:13] River is two magnificent Protestant
[44:15] hospitals and she lives in one of those
[44:17] cities right there three cities joined
[44:19] together and why in the world did should
[44:21] come over here to this Roman Catholic
[44:23] Hospital why I believe God had his hand
[44:25] on it all the time you know that woman
[44:27] who came in and the doctor said I want
[44:28] you topat their case and I went into
[44:30] that room to prepare that woman for the
[44:31] operating table and I heard her praying
[44:34] and I want you to know I became that
[44:36] woman's a private nurse her special
[44:38] nurse after she left the hospital she
[44:40] went home and I became her special nurse
[44:41] in the home and that woman to ask me if
[44:43] I wouldn't go to church with her and you
[44:46] know I lived in her home long enough to
[44:47] hear her pray I lived in that home long
[44:49] enough to read the Bible to her because
[44:51] I am her nurse and I did what she told
[44:52] me to I'd never read a Bible before in
[44:55] all of my life and she'd have to find
[44:56] this scriptures and then I read them to
[44:58] her and you know as I read the word of
[45:00] God God began to get a hold of me and
[45:02] finally she said won't you go to church
[45:03] with me and you know I went to church
[45:05] with that woman and I sat back there and
[45:06] heard a gospel for the first time in my
[45:08] life and you know I tell you I went
[45:10] through four nights and it was really
[45:12] beautiful I've never heard anything like
[45:14] this and all the time she was telling me
[45:16] about the Plan of Salvation telling me
[45:18] about God and that I needed God and I
[45:20] needed to be saved and of course I I was
[45:22] believing her do you know what I do
[45:23] every night I'd go home from church with
[45:25] that woman I'd say you go to bed but let
[45:27] go to the basement I'd lay my Bible down
[45:28] on a chair and there I challenge God and
[45:30] I'd say God did you hear what the
[45:32] preacher said did you hear it God and
[45:34] then I would tell God everything that I
[45:35] could remember the preacher said I said
[45:37] God you heard every word didn't you now
[45:39] if you're God and the Bible is the word
[45:42] of God and God you're
[45:45] real I want what those people have but
[45:48] if you're not God and the word of God is
[45:50] Not Your word then God please don't give
[45:53] to me what those people have let me tell
[45:55] you I challenge God I put him to a test
[45:58] God's not going to give you anything
[46:00] that's not of God don't you worry and
[46:02] every night I continued to do that four
[46:04] or five nights and I didn't eat it
[46:05] either I couldn't sleep and I'd lost my
[46:07] appetite and I was losing a lot of
[46:08] weight it was terrific but you know one
[46:10] night I come back to church and out of a
[46:14] clear blue sky right in the middle of
[46:15] that man's service I just got out of my
[46:17] seat and with both hands up in the air I
[46:20] come running right straight down an
[46:21] aisle like that and I fell into that Al
[46:23] and I cried out my God forgive me for
[46:25] all my sins I was a sinner I mean God
[46:29] met me there praise His Wonderful Name
[46:32] there was a pool of water on that floor
[46:34] I was sorry for everything that I did in
[46:36] the convent I stole potato peelings I
[46:38] stole bread I told lies I called the
[46:41] Mother Superior names under my breath
[46:43] and I want you to know God met me down
[46:45] there and he forgave me of every sin
[46:46] there was in my life and how I thank and
[46:48] praise him for it praise His Wonderful
[46:51] Name God's been very good to
[46:53] me very good to me few nights previous
[46:56] to that I went back to
[46:59] church God filled me with the baptism of
[47:02] the Holy
[47:03] Ghost may I say to you God means more to
[47:06] me than all the material wealth you have
[47:08] in this city I'd rather have Jesus than
[47:11] anything you might have because I found
[47:13] him to be the best friend I've ever
[47:15] known I can tell him anything I want to
[47:18] tell him and he won't call you up and
[47:19] tell you what I told him I can sit at
[47:22] his feet and tell him every day of my
[47:24] life Jesus I love you Jesus I love you
[47:28] and every secret to my heart I can pour
[47:30] off to him and I don't worry about him
[47:33] calling you up and telling you what I
[47:34] told him he's the best friend you ever
[47:36] had he's able to save you he's able to
[47:39] deliver you he's able to loose you from
[47:42] the things of this world set you free to
[47:44] know him praise His name I have a
[47:47] wonderful
[47:48] God I love him supremely I'd rather have
[47:52] Jesus than anything that you might have
[47:54] God is real in my life it's really
[47:56] wonderful
[47:57] how God delivered me out of the confid
[47:59] pray for me I need much prayer I'll be
[48:02] going places where it's predominantly
[48:04] Roman Catholic I'll have to suffer much
[48:06] but I'm willing to suffer for Jesus that
[48:09] I might tell someone about him and give
[48:12] my testimonies that other dear little n
[48:14] girls might be spared from Convent so
[48:16] pray for me won't you God bless
[48:19] you well what do you think I told you at
[48:22] the beginning it would be a very very
[48:23] gripping T you'll recall that we
