[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] a man can never seek God while he's a
[0:03] sinner God has to seek man and a man as
[0:08] I was explaining to some people today
[0:11] just like a pig and a lamb well the lamb
[0:14] could say to the pig why look you're
[0:17] nothing but an old SLO eating pig the
[0:20] pig is f handle your own business I have
[0:23] no desires to be a lamb and the peig
[0:26] could not change his
[0:28] nature no more than a sinner can change
[0:31] your nature you're borned in sin shaped
[0:34] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[0:36] lies and there's not one good sound part
[0:39] about anybody but who are you
[0:43] anyhow sometimes I notice people go out
[0:45] you standing by a big Museum here not
[0:47] long ago I've seen the analysis of a
[0:50] human body a man that weighed 150 lb was
[0:53] worth 84 cents in
[0:56] chemicals could you think of it and then
[0:58] you think you're somebody you're worth
[1:00] 84
[1:01] C right put a $10 hat on 84 cents and
[1:05] think you're somebody gra a $500 chubby
[1:08] around you and think you're somebody
[1:10] when you're 84
[1:13] Cent you sure take care of that 84 Cent
[1:15] so don't you right but remember in there
[1:20] you've got a store it's worth 10,000
[1:22] world and you let the devil push that
[1:24] around
[1:26] anyway yes that's right you take a
[1:29] person Len some of these little feisty
[1:31] people out on the street don't know no
[1:34] more about God than a hot top would know
[1:36] about Egyptian KN or they belong to
[1:39] church wrap a $500 meat coat around
[1:42] stick their nose up in the air the rain
[1:43] it drown them thinking there's somebody
[1:46] what are the 84
[1:48] sa
[1:49] [Music]
[1:51] right but you got to show remember now
[1:54] in the beginning you say to that person
[1:56] you ought to be born again to say tend
[1:58] to your own business
[2:01] can't help
[2:02] it just can't help it it's a pig can
[2:06] never tell it to be a lamb no more than
[2:08] you can ever become a Christian without
[2:09] God calling him now what has to happen
[2:12] to the pig to make him want to be a lamb
[2:14] if something has to come down and change
[2:17] his
[2:18] deed is that
[2:20] right so who has to do that you your
[2:24] whole nature is the other
[2:26] way God has to do it
[2:30] God speaks and your nature begins to
[2:33] seek after
[2:34] God that's when God is dealing with you
[2:37] before anything can happen out here to
[2:40] make you be a Christian something has to
[2:42] happen in the heart here to turn you to
[2:45] Christianity that's right it's the
[2:47] election God does that the Father
[2:49] Abraham was the first one and I know of
[2:52] this side the flood that was called by
[2:55] Grace by election God chose Abraham not
[2:58] because he was Abraham not because he
[3:00] was any good person God chose him
[3:03] because he was
[3:05] elected God did
[3:08] it now I want to say
[3:10] [Music]
[3:12] something you can never make yourself
[3:15] something that you're
[3:16] not if you're just impersonating
[3:19] Christianity no matter if you're
[3:20] preaching the gospel you need an order
[3:23] calling your
[3:24] soul
[3:27] right if you're just trying to act like
[3:29] that listen that a Christian you're
[3:31] miserable yourself knowing in your heart
[3:33] if you're
[3:35] not and if the fruits of the spirit
[3:37] don't follow you longsuffering goodness
[3:39] meak this G patience and you need an
[3:42] order call in your heart
