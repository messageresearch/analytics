Just desiring to lift our voices in worship to you. Lift our hands in surrender, Lord, saying, "Have your will. Not our will, but thine be done." This morning we want to remember this need this morning from Sister Susie. Lord, for this one who's got a broken vertebrae and in a coma. Lord, there's nothing to you whether it be a coma, whether it be dead in a tomb four days, Lord, but if you would speak the word, &gt;&gt; life would come forth back into that mortal body, oh God. Lord, may it be so spiritually this morning. if there would be one dead among us.

Dear heavenly father, we are your children. We've gathered here to be around your table. &gt;&gt; We pray, oh God, that we will be so fed, so fulfilled, so satisfied. I pray that your Holy Spirit will come, Lord, hover over and brood over this congregation and all those that are streaming in whatever land they may be. I pray, oh God, you'll hover over them. Take a phrase, just take some words, whatever you would choose, oh God, bring them into the atmosphere. Bring all that standing here into the atmosphere. Lord, think of the mothers in the mother's room and those that are in the uh upstairs in the translation rooms and wherever. We pray, oh God, you'll bless them, captivate their minds, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we just surrender ourselves to you to do what you would uh be pleased to do. &gt;&gt; May the kingdom of God be benefited today. I pray let your children oh God be strengthened I pray and filled with faith in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people said &gt;&gt; amen. God bless you. I'll let you have your seats for a few moments. The other day I was uh awakened fairly early and and there was just uh the subject I'm going to speak to you about in a few moments Lord willing uh was coming within a few moments and I I actually was studying on a different line. I was studying on worship. So you can understand why the songs today are having to do with the awesome presence of God and uh that we stand and I was singing that song. I stand in awe in the presence of the Lord. And because I had experienced some of these things, I thought I've always desired I might be able to convey it to the people. uh but I felt that uh my thoughts in the night were just uh rotating over portion of scripture which we're going to read in a few moments and it just took on a whole new uh whole new meaning a whole new perspective and so I want to convey that to you the Lord willing because I believe it's the Holy Spirit speaking to us and those young people, brother Matthew, that we had here in the uh on Thursday evening, plus the others that were maybe studying the fourth chapter of John. Uh I've thought very very much upon the woman at the well because that is a scripture and I looked for the place I believe that brother Brandham even said that the that the angel of God had referred him to some of these scriptures and uh I believe it's when he's being interviewed by the Cobb brothers but uh anyway he used that scripture so many many many times And I'm we're going to read it today and I believe you'll understand it &gt;&gt; more than understand it. I'm praying that God will and you pray today while you're sitting here. You just pray and say, "Lord, cause this service to be more than a Sunday morning service for me. Just cause it. Speak to me personally. I think I desire that very very much. And for you young people that have the future laying before you, if we have a future, and we certainly don't know about that, things could change very dramatically &gt;&gt; between now and next Sunday. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's just that critical at this moment. and we're here and we hear the ministers speak about the change of our body and the rapture and we believe that we've received a rapture call message. Um you all here including myself we're going to meet the one of whom I wish to speak about tonight or this morning which is Jesus Christ. You're going to meet him. Everything here, everything here you're attached to by the senses of this body are going to fade away &gt;&gt; because these senses the prophet said were given to you to contact this world. &gt;&gt; But where I want to turn your focus to another world &gt;&gt; which is right one breath away from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is important, I would be uh reticent of my responsibility if I did not do everything that I could with God's help to prepare you for that place. &gt;&gt; There's another world &gt;&gt; and this world means nothing in that world. &gt;&gt; This is Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; and that is why you struggle. That is why you have battles. &gt;&gt; But there's a place that I'm speaking of where you will not have another temptation &gt;&gt; because there will be no one there to tempt you. &gt;&gt; There will be no criminals. &gt;&gt; There will be no lawlessness. &gt;&gt; There will be no uncleanness. &gt;&gt; There will be none of those things &gt;&gt; because it'll be just holiness, &gt;&gt; righteousness, and the thing that you crave for. That's where we're headed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I desire that u the words are spoken this morning because the message has come to reveal Jesus Christ. And if he's revealed it, I guarantee it's for those of you that are gathered here in this sanctuary. And those of you that are gathered around the word, perhaps in your homes or wherever you are, whatever country you are, I just pray that the same atmosphere will come and how I desire that you will have the experience. Now, if you would like to stand and then we're going to read going to read from John the 4th chapter. We're starting with verse three and we'll go down to verse 29. That's a rather long reading, but it'll be necessary for the rest of the service. Starting with verse three, he left Judea and departed again into Galilee and he must need go through Samaria. &gt;&gt; I'm emphasizing that who is it? Well, you said Jesus, but who is he that must needs go through Samaria? Then cometh he to a to a city of Samaria, which is called Saikar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Incidentally, it was Joseph's through his lineage and children that the Samaritans came and that is why uh they were kind of considered not pure Jews as such. Joseph, you remember, took a gentile wife &gt;&gt; and these were Samaritans and the Samaritans were hated by the Jews. I want to speak to you on our true origin. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He said, 'Well, I was born in the United States and I'm Irish. Brother Brandham was Irish. But he discovered and he said that that was not his true origin either. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't I don't care where the where you were born or what hospital or what city or what place or what race. It has absolutely nothing to do with the origin I'm speaking of this morning. &gt;&gt; So if you want to find where your roots are, we'll go a lot further into it today. Verse six. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus sth unto her, "Give me to drink." For his disciples were gone away into the city, unto the city to buy meat. Then said the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew askest, Drink of me, which am a Samar a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou kneest the gift of God, I heard brother Derek speak about that. and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have he would have given thee living water." The woman sth unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep, from whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus answered and said unto her, "If thou, uh, whosoever drinkketh this water shall thirst again, but whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into unto eternal life." The woman sth unto him, "Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither uh neither come hither to draw." Jesus sth unto unto her, "Go call thy husband, and come hither." The woman answered and said, and said, I have no husband. Jesus sith unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband. For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou hast is not thy husband. In that said thou truly. The woman sth unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain. Notice how the subject turned to worship immediately. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus sth unto her, woman, believeth, believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the father. Ye worship, you know not what uh we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, and the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. The woman sth unto him, I know that Messiah's cometh, which is called Christ, when he come, when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus sth unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. &gt;&gt; And upon this his disciples uh his uh came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, "What seekest thou? Or why talkest thou with her?" The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and said unto the man, "Come see a man which told me all things that I that ever I did. Is not this the Christ?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. The subject which we've just read, the verses we've just read involve not only woman of Samaria with Jesus but involve the following things. I would just want to take it over eight points. A very ordinary conversation. You're here in the service this morning and you perhaps wouldn't speak wouldn't think it. Well, we we didn't come here to have an or ordinary conversation, but what I'm speaking to you today may involve tomorrow morning, may involve this coming week. I just pray that someday at some point in time that this may be a preparation for you or it may even be this morning. I'm more interested in the atmosphere &gt;&gt; that you are brought into than I am in the knowledge. Faith does not come by the mind and by the mouth. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So every uh the very or the very ordinary a very ordinary conversation about a drink of water that led into the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go call thy husband and come hither. Revealing the secret of her heart. This is where I'm going to be going. her recognizing that Jesus was a prophet. Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Number five, her first question was concerning worship. Verse 20, in this mountain or in Jerusalem. She acknowledged that when the Messiah comes, he will tell us all things. Number seven, Jesus, the same one that said, "Give me to drink," is the same one who said, "I am he that speaketh with thee." The same mouth, same voice, same character to the voice when he said, "Give me to drink." She wasn't startled with that. She said, you know, how is it that you a Jew have, you know, speak to me a Samar, a woman of Samaria? That was just ordinary conversation. But that's the same mouth that a few moments later said, I'm he that speaketh with thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at that, the Bible says she quickly recognized and acknowledged that he was the Christ was the Messiah. She dropped her water pot and went into the city. &gt;&gt; I've experienced something like this woman. I experienced which I won't bother going into detail, but I I've experienced that presence of the angel of the Lord. And I'll just tell you something. You're very fortunate to feel that you can even breathe after because the songs today were divinely led about being awe a struck. I stand in presence. I stand in awe at the presence of God. And I can tell you friends, I don't care who you are. I don't care what background or what country or what nation you come from. But when the presence of God draws near to you, you can't be any different than the prophet who said it's like 10,000 volts going through a thin wire. There's something about God. There's something about his holiness. There's something about his uh Yes. about his holiness and the purity and the power of God that leaves us to reduces us to helplessness &gt;&gt; as it were and yet he loves to have contact with us. &gt;&gt; The recognition of God's gift in Christ by a seed child of God is true worship. I want to connect those two together. We can raise our hands. We can clap. And I think all of that is perfectly fine. We can shout. We can dance. We can have all kinds of expressions. &gt;&gt; But I want to enlarge on that a wee bit. And I have about three or four slides I'd like to show you. So, if we could dim the lights, please. Philippians 2:5-7 says, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being," and I've got that underlined because I'm going to just come to that now. who being in the form, and that's not the shape of God, who being in the form of God, and I'll deal with that just a moment, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. So it's not the shape of a servant but the form of a servant is his activity his action and was made in the likeness of of man out of who is this Melzdc also we see him revealed here in Ruth and Boaz as a kinsman redeemer how he had come how he had to come to be flesh Right &gt;&gt; now we see the attribute sons of his spirit and that's what we have here in this building today. The sons now we see the attribute uh sons of his spirit. &gt;&gt; God attributes to them righteousness. Right &gt;&gt; now, I'm I'm just we're we're coming into a real situation here. We're coming to a man who's of another race or looked upon as another race to a woman of Samaria of another race. Uh they were even thought of as just dogs. They were not thought highly of at all. So I I I I I really care not h how little esteem a person has of themselves or how much esteem they have of themselves. We are really nothing. We are nothing. Uh and we have nothing really to offer. Uh this almighty God that brother Tom spoke about a couple of Sundays ago. uh this almighty God. Uh there's such a holiness with him I desire. You might feel like a stick of wood. That's fine. But this woman now is has come and she's had five husbands. &gt;&gt; And the one she's with right now is not her husband. And you would not I'm very very exercised. You would not be proud to have her as a neighbor, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And she probably would not be welcome in a lot of churches in the message. &gt;&gt; And yet we have one who must needs &gt;&gt; go to Samaria &gt;&gt; because she was a seed. Her origin was not just a Samaritan. She was a seed out of the thought of God. &gt;&gt; And this one who must go to her, the prophet said was he he doesn't say it in my words, but I going to go into the scripture and into the message with you. He he speaks of Melzdc who who actually is God. I better I better just give it to you. Now uh now the difference between him and you as a son. He was the beginning the word. He was at the beginning the word anorphy body. He came in and lived in that in that morphy body. He came and lived in that in the person of MelzDC. Then later we never heard no more of Melzdc because he became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Melzdc came and visited Abraham &gt;&gt; and gave Abraham a promise &gt;&gt; to you and your seed. &gt;&gt; Now he had a literal seed, a natural seed which became the Jews. But he had a faith seed &gt;&gt; because he believed God. &gt;&gt; And because he believed God, God attributed &gt;&gt; attributed to him his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Said, "I you are my friend. You're my friend." Yeah. Even though Abraham was born like every other man, like every other sinner, you were born a sinner. So don't talk to me about where you came from or what your roots are if your roots aren't back in heaven. &gt;&gt; You don't have any roots worth talking about. &gt;&gt; And this w woman's roots were in heaven. &gt;&gt; And that is why he must go through Samaria. &gt;&gt; He must find this seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; He must find this seed of God. Because now MelzDC is the same one that became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Jesus must go as the high priest. &gt;&gt; And Melzdc showed himself to Abraham as the high priest of God. &gt;&gt; And uh is that not right? &gt;&gt; He showed himself as the high priest. That's what Paul speaks about. And now the high priest, I must go to Samaria. I must find this woman. He not He's not interested how many husbands she's had or or what her life has been like. He must redeem her &gt;&gt; because he is the redeemer. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you friends, there's nobody here that can boast about their life. Don't care how clean it is or how dirty it is. There's no one that can boast about their life. We've been born in sin and shaped in iniquities. And the prophet of God said, "Your parents were condemned. Your grandparents were condemned. Your forefathers were condemned. What can we boast about? They're all condemned. And we were born condemned. But thank God we had one who came and revealed himself as the high priest." The high priest, Melzdc, the high priest came in the form of Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ took the body sacrificed to Goltha and gave himself as a sacrifice so that you could become something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And later we never heard no more because he became Jesus Christ. Jesus was, now this is some of it's out of Strong's concordance. Jesus was in the form, this is not a quote, Jesus was in the form, that's morphe of God. Form is not the shape. Form is the essence. &gt;&gt; Now just watch it, please. The word being, the word being because the scripture, the scripture which we had just read earlier said who being in the form of God, &gt;&gt; who being in the form of God, now this service is one where I want you to think real deep. who being in the form of God indicates a condition that began in the past and continues into the present. That's why a he can say he's the same yesterday, today and forever &gt;&gt; because he has it's the condition who being in the form of God that is the condition. He's the same yesterday, today and forever. who being in the form of God a indicates a condition that began in the past and continues into the present. Therefore, while on earth, the outward expression of his innermost being was the expression of the divine essence deity. Paul means that when the one who became Jesus the word came to earth to assume the form of a man, he did not cease being God. &gt;&gt; He was God. &gt;&gt; Being God, he became a man. That God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. He did not cease being God. Strong Gordon's in on regarding the word morphe properly form or outward expression that embodies essential inner substance so that the form is in complete harmony with the inner. Your form friends, your form has nothing to do with where you were born or what race you came from. Your form is that you have uh you have you're the outward expression. You are the outward expression and the outward expression should be in harmony with the inner essence. You hunger after God. You thirst after God. You desire God. Let your outward expression be sub in submission to that. &gt;&gt; Can I hear amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it is so that the outward form were all different forms and shapes. That has nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it. I'm just waiting. It's the essence. You're simply a vessel for the essence of deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; friends. I've come here for another purpose this morning. I know brother Tom was announced even to speak, but I I I I actually sat in the middle of the night for about 3 hours and just wrote because this was so quickened to me and I I want to convey it to you. If there's anything in life that you desire, you should just ponder this. You should ponder and think about this Christ. How in the Old Testament even God, this God came as the high priest Melchzdc without beginning of days nor ending of life. And I'll be quoting some of that without beginning of days nor ending ending of life. And somehow your father Abraham, father in the faith, was so affected, he just wanted to give him tithes of a tenth of all that he had. It material things didn't mean anything to him. But he he had just won a great victory. &gt;&gt; Abraham had just gone and slaughtered a bunch of kings. &gt;&gt; It didn't have that has nothing to do with God. I mean, I'm not going to belittle the slaughter of the kings, but if there were wicked kings and this world is filled with violence and wicked people and and the prophet of God calls those who are not elected a fodder, atomic fodder. And a lot of believers don't want to say that because they think it's too rough. But that's exactly the truth. That's exactly what it is. And you can say believers that uh and you as a congregation of believers shall not in Jesus' name shall not be affected by these naysayers or unbelievers. What what does an unbeliever have? Doesn't even have a teaspoon of ashes up there in their brain. And they're going to figure out God. And they're going to tell about how a prophet How can you tell about a prophet when you you cannot even tell how how God can be without beginning and without end. &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. and you that were here at the little gathering we had the other night. Uh the team, Brother Matthew Redell's team, you'll understand a little more about that. Listen friends, I may not be preaching too many more times. I don't know. But one thing is certain. You are going to go the same direction. We all are going to live this life for a very short time. And then you're going to go where this being that I'm speaking about is. And you want to receive him on good terms. &gt;&gt; Amen. the outward expression of an inner essence. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. That of second Corinthians. God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your con concept or or thought of God is, but God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; He had to be made known. This God was in Christ when he must needs go through Samaria. This God was in Christ when he sat wearied on the well. This God was in Christ talking to a woman who was living with another man. &gt;&gt; But there was a seed buried there beneath all of that garbage and beneath all of that filth that she'd been living in and trying in life and hardship. one husband, two husbands, three husbands, four husbands, five husbands. Didn't work. &gt;&gt; So, she's with her sixth man. &gt;&gt; But there's a seed there. &gt;&gt; And that seed is all valuable. &gt;&gt; That seed is not going to become subjected to Satan's &gt;&gt; Satan's all his uh devices. &gt;&gt; And I'll just throw something else out to her. that that's not that's not in the books for a seed of God. &gt;&gt; When God said, "I'm going to redeem you and your seed," &gt;&gt; that's what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; And you hear the services and some of the men in the services and brother Tom was preaching. I believe in the last service and have heard brother John some of these brothers preaching and preaching about families and so on and so forth. We do not know how. We do not know when. But one thing is absolutely certain. God is going to redeem every one of his seed. &gt;&gt; Every one of his seed. And you need to hear that. You need to confess that. And you need to believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seeing then that we have a great high priest. Who has it? We have a great high priest. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say that with me. We have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God. Let us hold fast our profession. This great high priest must needs go through Samaria. Now to Abraham and his seed, where the promises made, he seth not, and to seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ. This woman, believe it or not, she was part of him. &gt;&gt; And he had come to redeem her. &gt;&gt; He was fulfilling the function of a priest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was going to die for her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And redeem her. and she was going to become a part of him, &gt;&gt; a part of the body of Christ. We do not know how. I don't know how it all happens, but that's what was going to happen. And he came to redeem her. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that wonderful, friends? Isn't that wonderful? Doesn't this glorify him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. I only repeat that to bring you back to it in the in the message Melzdc the great prince and king in 1955. And I'm saying it that way. You just listen now. You talk about prophet. I pray he said that God I pray God that every sick person in here that their faith will be sufficient this morning now to remember that Melchisedc. What he's praying is I pray that their faith will be sufficient to remember. I pray that your faith this morning in in 2017 shall be sufficient to remember the great high priest because that was that was almighty God that came down as a great high priest on his way on his journey and he would become Jesus Christ and uh take on a body of flesh and take that flesh as a sacrifice to Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is an incredible journey. You talk about an incredible journey. It hasn't got anything to do with cats and dogs. &gt;&gt; It has to do with someone who came from heaven. &gt;&gt; Almighty God came from heaven and took a journey down through life and gave gave promise to such men as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You can say what you wish about Abraham. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Maybe he Well, he said something that wasn't exactly true. It's all you find him in the New Testament after the cross, you'll find him only as a father of the faith. &gt;&gt; You'll find that he has a a life of perfection. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, in this world, you're a sinner. &gt;&gt; In that world, you're pure and holy. And it just depends what world you want to concentrate on. What world you want to allow your mind to have you carried away in. And I have been so pondering. I can speak with very forcibly this morning because I have been pondering for many many hours until until even as I read this this these scriptures which we read as a text. The very spirit of that atmosphere comes upon me and I begin to tremble. I begin to weep to think that Melzdc would go and get her. &gt;&gt; Let me say something to you. Melazedc, this same one came by your way. &gt;&gt; Came by your way. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was at a well. &gt;&gt; I trusted. Oh, God. Let it be in the service. Let somebody &gt;&gt; and I can tell you one thing. You'll be aruck &gt;&gt; at his very presence. &gt;&gt; You won't feel that you're a high achiever. you will just marvel that he even stopped by your way. &gt;&gt; And here he speaks to her and says, "Give me a drink." Oh, he said, "If you knew who you're talking to, &gt;&gt; that's a whole lot of the problem. We don't recognize who it is we're talking to. We don't realize who it is we're raising our arms to. We don't realize who it is that's right here. Deity &gt;&gt; becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; Faith to remember that great Melzdc back yonder who had no beginning of days. Notice where he starts. No beginning of days. had no father nor mother and he had no end of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He still lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ought to let your mouth be released and say thank you &gt;&gt; almighty God. &gt;&gt; No beginning of days that means you're present. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Means you see me in my situation. &gt;&gt; You know exactly where I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what kind of person I am &gt;&gt; and I even though I may feel no good, you're God. &gt;&gt; Even though I may I may feel not very righteous, but you are all righteousness. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then was incarnated called Jesus Christ. Became flesh. died went back went back to it again. He's still the king of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; King of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Promising uh promise promising us these great eternal things. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has been swore by God to Abraham that he would keep the covenant, the promise to him and his seed forever. &gt;&gt; If Jesus was God, he had to go to Samaria. &gt;&gt; If Jesus is God, he had to come to Cloverdale. &gt;&gt; He had to come to the Pacific Northwest. He had to come to where you're studying. He had to come to where you're working. He has to come &gt;&gt; because he's God. &gt;&gt; I made a promise. &gt;&gt; I can't break the promise. &gt;&gt; I got to get every seed that was in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then 10 years later, Brother Brandham still speaking. 10 years later in who is this Melzdc? A theophony of something helping us now to understand it. A theophony of something that you could not see. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You have a theophony beside you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it's another world. We don't understand it. We are in a body of senses and these five senses are made to contact this world. You hear me speaking. You see me standing here. But like the prophet of God said, "You don't really know him. &gt;&gt; You don't know me and I don't know you." He said, "You've never seen me. I've never seen you." the real &gt;&gt; this body, but the essence of it, &gt;&gt; the essence that cries out after God, &gt;&gt; the essence that desires him. &gt;&gt; All this body is is a framework &gt;&gt; that packs it around. &gt;&gt; And it is to be in harmony with &gt;&gt; what you really are called to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're called to be not to fill a position in this world. This world is passing away. &gt;&gt; This world's nothing but a bunch of ashes. &gt;&gt; You're called for something much higher. &gt;&gt; And I want you to recognize today, friends, you should walk. You shall walk. Not should. You shall walk with your shoulders back. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of the living God. I have no part of this stuff. If you see anything in me, you might ask and I may be able to speak to you, but God, I want to I'm the I've been made the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's not me talking. &gt;&gt; That is the word of God. &gt;&gt; You're the light of the world. &gt;&gt; You need to walk like the light of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that scare you? &gt;&gt; And he said to try to explain it, it's just like well television. That's another dimension. Television people are moving right through these rooms now. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just a switch for you. &gt;&gt; No, it's not a switch. If it wasn't going through the room, the switch wouldn't do anything. &gt;&gt; Colors are going through the room. &gt;&gt; Voices are going through the room. &gt;&gt; In other places, it says bodies are going through the room. And a television does not invent the picture. &gt;&gt; It only catches and captures what's there &gt;&gt; and transforms and sends it to a screen. &gt;&gt; But he said the eye is only subject to the five senses. Then he said your whole being your whole being is only subject to five senses rather and you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see. &gt;&gt; So we see one another. We shake one another's hands. We say God bless you &gt;&gt; and you hear the words. You see a mouth speaking. But that's in this life and it's only harmonizing the essence of what's inside. Say God bless you is not just a term. &gt;&gt; God bless you is an announcement. &gt;&gt; It's a pronouncement upon you if you receive it that way. And you are only subject to the sight that has been limited to see. But there is another dimension that can only be seen by a transformation by television. It was here when Adam was here. &gt;&gt; It was here when Elijah was here. Television was here. When Jesus Christ walked the shores of Galilee and when he sat on the well, it was here. &gt;&gt; But he said, "You're just now discovering it." Isn't that amazing? Why are we discovering it now? Because we are a people. Listen to me. We are a people designed for higher things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater things &gt;&gt; and we believe things that people earlier would have called us us crazy for. &gt;&gt; But we have received a prophet and he he lived in another world. &gt;&gt; Jesus lived in another world. &gt;&gt; They crucified him for some purpose. They crucified him because they didn't understand him and they condemned him and he was worthy of death according to that. &gt;&gt; Would you be willing to stand for your faith? &gt;&gt; If you were assigned worthy of death, I say that what we believe is too precious &gt;&gt; to give up to anybody. And so it is and this I want to impress you with he's talking about television because that helps us to understand it. But he said so it is. &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to say so it is. So it is &gt;&gt; that Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Christ is here. &gt;&gt; So it is. &gt;&gt; It should that should not surprise you anymore or me any be any more difficult for you to say that than it would be to turn on the switch. &gt;&gt; Turn on the screen. &gt;&gt; Turn on the flat screen. I don't I don't I go I don't get aruck when I turn on the flat screen in my study and see brother Derek out here leading the song and leading the worship of the people. I don't stand back say, "Oh my goodness. I expect it to come on." You come here to this service, &gt;&gt; you should expect &gt;&gt; that this Christ &gt;&gt; that this God &gt;&gt; who in the days of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; walked in a body that got weary and sat on a well. He knew which well he was sitting on. He knew that woman was coming. That didn't shock him. That didn't surprise him. He and and that God knew that you were going to come to this service. &gt;&gt; He knew that you needed to hear something today. &gt;&gt; And I am speaking these things because your theophony &gt;&gt; is calling for it. Your eternal home is calling for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you'll know after this service I'm going to be as short as I can and I'm not going to be overly long. But please give me your not only your attention but just cry out to God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; he of whom he that man is speaking of let him come and be a reality to me. caused me to be aruck &gt;&gt; at his divine presence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so is Christ is here and angels of God are here. &gt;&gt; Oh my, they're everywhere. &gt;&gt; Angels of God are here. And someday in the great millennium to come, it'll just be more real than television or anything else. &gt;&gt; It'll be more real than the flat screen in my study. It'll be more real. It'll be I won't be turning on a button. I'll just be looking up to Father. Oh, Father, &gt;&gt; I've known you. I've talked with you. You came by my way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friend, he came to my country. &gt;&gt; He came where I go hunting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He came to an old log that I sat on. &gt;&gt; He spoke through another mouth called a prophet's mouth. &gt;&gt; Spoke directly and revealed the secret in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. And I was I was in a desolate condition preaching the gospel for seven years. Didn't know how to baptize. Didn't know how whether God was one, is he two? Is he three? And I've heard everything. Heard good ministers. Had dear friends. That's all in the emotional realm, my friends. But he &gt;&gt; when he makes himself known, it's done. &gt;&gt; It's anchored forever. You never have another question about it. It's all settled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You are here because you passed by that unbelief brought you here. But faith will take you out. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said there was another prophet by the name of Moses and another one by the name of Elijah. They had both died. One one had died and his body was carried away by the angels and buried someplace that was secret. And the other one didn't die. He was actually caught away in a chariot of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Horses of fire. That's what Elisha said. &gt;&gt; Didn't look like he persuaded too many people. He didn't have big campaigns of people who believed what he was saying. &gt;&gt; But he said Elijah was caught away. It's few, friends. &gt;&gt; It's very few. It's few friends, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Be believing. &gt;&gt; It's very few. &gt;&gt; But about 800 years later, the prophet refers to this. Jesus said to his disciples, "There'll be some of you that shall not die till you'll see the Lord coming in his power." Amen. &gt;&gt; And we think of that just as his coming. No. Then he took his disciples, just three of them, &gt;&gt; Peter and John. And uh they went up on the mountain. Peter, James, and John went up in the mountain. And there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah standing there &gt;&gt; with Jesus himself glorified. &gt;&gt; Jesus was in the glistening garment. &gt;&gt; Where did the garment come from? I ask you. I tell you friends, God can do anything any time. &gt;&gt; We limit him so much. Oh, we're running by the clock and we have to do certain things by the clock. Forget it. Forget this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be slothful. You understand that? But we must not be preoccupied by Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Preoccupied. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We're all dittery and we got to do here and we got to shop and we got to get this. I'm not against shopping. My wife does it all the time. I do it with her. I'm not opposed to that. We have to live life. &gt;&gt; But we live life. We study or we if you study, do your very best. If you work for a living, do your very best. If you're a wife or a and a cooking, do your very best. But that's not what it's all about. That's not what we're preoccupied with. &gt;&gt; We can be over the sink. We can be looking after children, but our minds are on heavenly things. Oh God, you are what I heard about Sunday. You are that Mechazedc and I do have a theophony. I believe every word of it. Do you believe? &gt;&gt; Do you believe, saints? Do you believe in the balconies? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; You're believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But so it is. Is not a liar speaking the truth. And so it is. Is television here? I could bring a television, turn it on, and you get some channels. So it is. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; So it is. &gt;&gt; Angels of God are here. &gt;&gt; You can't touch him. Your body's not made for it. But the essence inside says it's true. &gt;&gt; So it is. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it is. &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here. &gt;&gt; The one who died for you. So it is. &gt;&gt; He's resurrected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's living here now. &gt;&gt; And he's walking here in this generation. &gt;&gt; So it is. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. &gt;&gt; I listen to that prophet. I get into such an atmosphere. And I hope you let me finish here just a few minutes, please. Prophet Moses and Elijah. And it says in that form, in that state on Mount Transfiguration, Peter, James, and John were there. But Jesus did not have to introduce Moses &gt;&gt; and Elijah. He said in that state, they recognized them. Your mind will not be limited. &gt;&gt; You won't have to learn things. &gt;&gt; You won't have to learn any history &gt;&gt; about them. You'll just know them &gt;&gt; and we will know even as we are known. He said, "If you're an attribute of God expressed here on earth," and that's what we have to walk around in this life and simply say, "I'm an attribute of almighty God. &gt;&gt; I'm an attribute of my father who made all this stuff. &gt;&gt; I'm an attribute of God." You kids hear me? I'm an attribute of God. My father made these mountains. &gt;&gt; My father made this ocean. My father's in control of everything. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, this is happening and all the people that are dying from overdoses and everything." I just say, "Let it go. Whatever. Whatever." It's going to be a lot worse. &gt;&gt; It's going to get a lot worse. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, shall we stop?" No. Do whatever you need to do. Let the world do it. &gt;&gt; Hope you don't take me wrong. I have here. He lived in two worlds. And you've heard me speak about it. Now it's comes crashing together. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm not of this world." &gt;&gt; And you can say exactly the same thing. You must say the same thing. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. I just come here at a short for a short period of time. &gt;&gt; I have just above my study a picture of my mom, my sister, and myself. I'm about two, two and a half, three years old or something standing there. I thank God that she bore me and brought me into this world. That's not where I came from. That's not my origin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet even spoke to his wife and his family. We're of another citizenship. &gt;&gt; You're not Americans and Canadians and Africans or whatever more. You come from God. God had to go to China. &gt;&gt; This MelzDC &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, wasn't that Murphy?" No, &gt;&gt; this is Melzdc &gt;&gt; had to go to China. &gt;&gt; Melzedc had to go to Congo &gt;&gt; to Rwanda or wherever. &gt;&gt; MelzDC went there and found you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you were just walking around &gt;&gt; hoing some dirt or whatever more. &gt;&gt; God only knows your life. &gt;&gt; God himself knows my life. &gt;&gt; He knows how to penetrate any business wall, &gt;&gt; any office wall, &gt;&gt; any educational institution. &gt;&gt; He knows how to interrupt your studies &gt;&gt; with his presence. &gt;&gt; And suddenly you are aruck. Oh, I didn't know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nathan, your father, Michael Hunt, he wanted to go to Europe. I'm telling you something now you never heard before. Andrea, your daddy. Sharon, your daddy. He had to go to he wanted to go to Europe and he wanted to build himself up and his physique his mind was on his body want to build himself up. His dad worked for the Vancouver city. I promised myself I wouldn't tell stories but I have to tell this one. So he said to his dad worked in the machine with repairing the vehicles and so on. He said, "I want to get a job at the garbage detail." So he said, "Well, you could get something else." No, he said, "I want to hoist cans and have exercise." So that's where he got. He told me many times Bibles and tracks begin to fall out of the garbage cans. &gt;&gt; And he'd pick them up. He couldn't he couldn't throw them in the garbage. He'd pick him up and stick him in his coat. &gt;&gt; And he and he saw a little tract. And I'm sure the person that wrote that track never ever dreamed that a garbage collector who was a seed of God was going to pick that up as it bounced out of a garbage can. And it showed three men climbing the a hill and three crosses on top of the hill. No one man and three crosses on top of the hill. And this man was walking with great big burden and bags waiting him down, climbing up the hill. And when he went past the crosses and through the cross at whatever had happened there, he's running down the other hill and he's a little stick man little stick drawing and he's screaming and the sound waves are showing out of him. He's screaming and the bag is dropped off and is rolling down the hill. And Michael said, "Whatever he got, &gt;&gt; that's what I need. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God can use anything. &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; God can use a cigarette package &gt;&gt; to uh to inspire profit &gt;&gt; to speak on sir &gt;&gt; the subject of man's of a man's filter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A holy man's filter. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Michael, he went home and he went down in his basement, his mother and dad's basement where he was staying in a room down there for a while. And he walked back and forth in that room. And he said, "This presence of God, this Elohim, this Yahwa, whatever you want to call him, there's no particular vernacular that can can encompass him." Almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who has come in the form of Jesus Christ. And that's why that prophet could say, "You might hear my voice, but that's not me speaking." That voice was coming from another realm. And that's why people can't understand it. And that's why we can't explain it. It didn't come for explanation. It didn't come to just be uh subject material for preaching. Are you folks with me? &gt;&gt; It didn't come just so we could have nice sermons. It came to bring you into contact with the almighty God. &gt;&gt; And he come into the form of Melzdc for Abraham's day. Came in the form of Jesus Christ in in his day and came in another form of a redeemed son. I don't make I don't make brother Brandham equal with Jesus Christ. Not at all. Jesus said, "Eat my flesh. Drink my blood." William Brandon could never say that. He was a redeemed son. He said, "I was born in sin, shapen in iniquity." He was like you, like me. But he came as a vessel. He said, "I can't help it." &gt;&gt; He couldn't help seeing what he saw. And he couldn't help telling it. And you needed to hear it, and I need to say it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You belong to another world. &gt;&gt; You shall not give yourself to this world. &gt;&gt; You must not be preoccupied with this world. We're preoccupied with another land. &gt;&gt; Another place. &gt;&gt; And you're a lot closer to it than you think. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have a theophony &gt;&gt; right by you at this time. You cannot see it. It doesn't mean it's not there. You can't see the television waves. You can't hear the radio sounds. All kinds of music going through this room. I'm glad we don't have a radio here to catch it. Amen. &gt;&gt; We could turn this atmosphere in just a moment into some booming sound that you'd say, "Oh, shut it off." &gt;&gt; But this this is not something I'm trying to get you to turn it on. &gt;&gt; You have the capacity. &gt;&gt; You were made &gt;&gt; for this other realm. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You're actually made for it. &gt;&gt; You have the inner essence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're just sitting here as physical beings, but you have the inner essence. And I can tell you what it's saying. That inner essence is saying to you, it's true. &gt;&gt; It's true. It's all true. &gt;&gt; That inner essence is saying, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; Your mind has got all kinds of other things in it, but your inner essence is saying, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just all right, brother Tom. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, now we see." And I underlined it and I put it in red and yellow highlights because I was going to stand here today. Now we see the attribute sons of his spirit. Now I see the attribute daughters of his spirit. How shall I be treating them? How shall I be speaking to them? How shall I approach them? The redeemed of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you such? &gt;&gt; Are you such? &gt;&gt; Are you from another place? You've not entered the word form yet. But a theophony, this body is subject to the word. &gt;&gt; What I'm preaching, if it be the word of God, your theophony is subject to that word. After a short conversation with this woman, the one that said, "Give me to drink," said the same voice, same person, same dress. The one who said, "Give me to drink," said also, "I am he." Great. &gt;&gt; What changed? &gt;&gt; And the moment the moment that she asked, she said, "Sir, I perceive that you're a prophet." &gt;&gt; Right away, her next statement was, "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say to work in worship in Jerusalem." And Jesus said, "The hour cometh, &gt;&gt; and now is &gt;&gt; talking about that moment." &gt;&gt; Why? Because her hour of recognition had come. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to make a statement now that I can't necessarily prove to you, but recognition of who he is that is approaching you is true worship. Because almighty God is seeing his seed come to him. &gt;&gt; He is seeing his seed aruck &gt;&gt; in his presence. &gt;&gt; That means a whole lot more than &gt;&gt; raising your hand or even clapping your hand. And don't stop doing that. &gt;&gt; That's fine. We're happy. So we clap our hands so but that's not just worship. Worship is when you are hearing this service this morning and you recognize I'm getting down here where you are. You recognize who it is &gt;&gt; speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got experience after experience. I've had some of them that made me somewhat fearful. I have a daughter back here and we had just come not out of the not out of the well, but we just came out of Starbucks. She had a son who's here is not in the same spiritual condition that he is tonight today. and I was standing on the curb and she was standing below me. I'm her daddy. She didn't say daddy. She said, "My son said, you're a man of God." That was her address. And I the appearance on her face struck fear to my soul says you're a man of God and my son has died and I want him to live again. And the boy is here. &gt;&gt; The young man holding his child is here. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that God is dead. Don't tell me these naysayers know something about this message. They know nothing about this. &gt;&gt; They're nothing about this God that this prophet identified. &gt;&gt; Are you with me friends? &gt;&gt; Nobody has a right or nobody should after this service sit on the fence. &gt;&gt; There is no fence. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ, God is God. &gt;&gt; He does whatever he wants &gt;&gt; and you're looking at a person that has experienced too many things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Too many things. This isn't something that comes by the intellect. It's something that comes in the heart &gt;&gt; of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that man who walked in the dust of the earth and sat down because he was tired and talking to a woman who was a prostitute. And she said, "I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things." And the same one that said a few minutes ago, "Give me the drink." He said, "I'm height." &gt;&gt; And she believed it. and she received it &gt;&gt; and went her way into a city. And I didn't go into a city, but I thought, I'm going I'm jumping in a car and I'm going to be driving down to Cloverdale Bible Way and I'll be there. I didn't come into a city, but I came here. Come see a man &gt;&gt; that told me all that ever I did. &gt;&gt; Is not this the Christ? I say this is the Christ. &gt;&gt; This is the Christ that's here in this building. &gt;&gt; This is the Christ that's talking to you. &gt;&gt; This is the Christ that is saying to you by his spirit, this is the truth. &gt;&gt; Take it seriously. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was the moment of true worship. when he said, "I am he." And she recognized it. The prophet of God said she quickly recognized it. She didn't need to lope around and hear it again and be made happy or something. No, she recognized it right away. Quickly recognized it. &gt;&gt; And I came here this morning with a sense of I don't know exactly what it was. I don't want anybody to miss it. Don't want you to miss it. So, well, I've never experienced anything like that. What does it take? Well, unfortunately, sometimes it takes some painful things. Sometime it involves life's decisions. Sometime it involves things that we don't invite and we don't really want to go through. But when we get down and just almost want to throw dust in our hair, it doesn't always have to be that way. But I'm saying desperation is a wonderful thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You get desperate before God. It doesn't have to be bad times, don't get me wrong. But when there's a realization, this isn't how things are always going to be. This isn't how it's always going to be. Some of you that have lost your dearest companion. That is why sometimes God will talk to a person in a special way and you realize everything is everything is meaningless. I and my wife talked about this this morning. We didn't talk about somebody passing away or anything. We talked about this world &gt;&gt; in this world how meaningless it has become. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who wants to stay here? &gt;&gt; Where in the world? I have a son. I have a grandson back there that was doing some work on Main Street and and uh what was it Sam? Maine and &gt;&gt; Hastings. &gt;&gt; Maine and Hastings doing a job down there. And three times ambulances had to come in and pick up people that had overdosed. Three times while he's doing the job. Three times. You paid for it. You paid for all those ambulance people. You paid for those men that work there. Professionals. You paid for it. But people are injecting and so on so forth. That's their that's this world. &gt;&gt; All the ambulance, all that turmoil, Samuel, that's this world. &gt;&gt; God hasn't called you to this world. &gt;&gt; He came. &gt;&gt; Melisedc came. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the prophet of God came &gt;&gt; not at his own choosing, &gt;&gt; but but but he was he he's demanded by God, &gt;&gt; commanded by God to remain faithful. &gt;&gt; I have to hurry or I won't get to where I want to go. Do you have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; I won't be. It's 25 12 and I'm going to be just a few more minutes. I want to talk about the hour of recognition just for a moment. The Jews wanted the Greeks wanted to see Jesus says they never found him in Christmas. They never found him in organizations. They didn't find him in some creeds. And I live in this world. You live in this world. We hear all kinds of people that got different forms of worship and they all worship. Maybe one and a quarter billion of of Muslim people bow down, put their head to the ground. Don't tell me that they're are insincere. Right? &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that they don't mean it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I don't mock them. They do that. And someone else does something else &gt;&gt; and they do everything to to worship. And I listen to I didn't listen to it, but I just seen a little bit on the screen. This is the way they worship and this is the way someone else worships. said you got everything under worship is for you to know him &gt;&gt; whom to know is life eternal &gt;&gt; and in his presence you will not just become giggly or enthused or just inspired. All kinds of people get inspired. Why in the world are you talking like this, Brother Biscll? Because I know what that presence is like. &gt;&gt; I have experienced it. The woman at the well experienced it. People sitting here have experienced it. And I was telling you about Mike Hunt. I'll just finish this line. One day, God saw him. Whoever was dwelling in Melzdc saw him sticking those Bibles and tracks in his pocket or in his shirt because he didn't have he just had enough respect not to throw it away in the garbage. &gt;&gt; And he would come home and put it up on the shelf. And he was pacing back and forth one day and he fell face forward for the presence, the holy presence of a being. He'd never been in church in his life. He was 26 years old. Never been in a church. Never heard a sermon. And he fell forward on the floor. And he doesn't know how long he was there, but maybe an hour or two, the grace of God. And he was weeping, sodbing over his past until his eyes didn't want to open. And in that state, he got up, brother Ernie, and he went upstairs and his mother was standing there with a big skillet, cast iron skillet in her hand, and she just saw him. I'm not talking about somebody a thousand years ago. I'm talking about somebody just a few years ago right here in Vancouver. &gt;&gt; Lived on Main Street, 57th in Maine. In Vancouver. and she's carrying this skillet cuz she was just going to be making supper. And she said, "Michael, don't come near me." He said, "It's all right, mother. I've just met God." She said, "Don't come near me. Don't come near me." What is that? The fear of the presence of God. She doesn't know what happened. She dropped the skillet on the floor. That man became a preacher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of this message and loved it with all his heart and soul. And I can tell you upon that recognition, whatever was in his past is forgiven and forgotten. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "It's as though you never did it in the first place." If you recognize him this morning &gt;&gt; and ah &gt;&gt; I think of I stand in presence. I stand in awe at the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we'll sing it in just a couple minutes. You know why this may be difficult for you? Because a prophet of God said this, "You lost your origin in the garden." You lost your origin. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching. So you might say, "Well, where is it? Where can I find it? My true origin." I tell you when you come into his presence and you realize maybe somebody I mean we got to realize that deity is in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's some brother. Maybe it's some sister. Maybe it's some service. Maybe it's this service. I don't know. I'm not going to try to excite you or inspire you to say so. But God, you met someplace along the road. You met God and God made himself known to you. That changes absolutely everything, &gt;&gt; does it not? &gt;&gt; Says one day I want to get this to you. He says the Samaritan woman, she quickly recognized that was the sign of the Messiah and that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever between the races then that he went to deal with. Isn't he the same today if he manifested himself in that way to prove he was a Messiah to them? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you agreeing with me? &gt;&gt; Don't Don't worry, please. Isn't he obligated to us in this day? Do you feel this God, unchanging God? He would be obligated to honor the same faith and do the same thing today. You say, "Oh, well that's just Brother Ed. Maybe it's not." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, that's just Brother Tom. Maybe it's not. &gt;&gt; Well, that's just my husband or that's just my wife. Maybe it's not. That's just my parents. Maybe it's not. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. Maybe God is talking through them. And he said, "Wouldn't he be obligated to do the same thing?" Excuse me. He said, "There's a lady. The lady is not here for herself. She's here for someone else. That's a brother." Listen to this, friend. This is so profound. I didn't even know how to approach it. He said, "I see them coming up together in the world he's in." He sees them both coming up together and then he continues on and the brother is in a horrible condition. right now. He's in a horrible condition right now. He's an alcoholic and he's laying drunk and he was so drunk you couldn't sober him up enough to come to this meeting. And the prophet just said, "I see you coming up together." &gt;&gt; Amen. Her faith had literally materialized him. &gt;&gt; Oh, my precious friends that go here to Cloverdale Bible Way, this God that I'm talking about is so alive and so near, &gt;&gt; nearer than you dare to make him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's able to do all manner of things that you have need of. It's us that need the faith. &gt;&gt; And she came up on his behalf. And he says this, he's an alcoholic and he's laying drunk. You couldn't get him sober enough to bring him to this meeting. And that's thus saith the Lord. Do you believe? And then he said, "Let us pray." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see the power of it, friends. The power of it. You don't understand that. &gt;&gt; I don't understand that. But when you you can even come and hold someone in your heart and that's all a prophet will say you're coming with somebody else. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Now I know I've gone over your heads. Don't look at me like a big question mark. Say amen. I believe it. God saw them both coming up together. That's what he saw. And then you want to hear some of his last words in this life. He said this after the rapture, after things that are to be, after these four services, he had one last one is communion. And while he's serving communion, speaking, he's talking about himself, walking out and he goes even back into his boyhood and he's talking about he's looking up at the trees. Oh, you'd say surely there'd be some masterful revelation. This is and he sees the trees sees a leaf fall. He said, "What was it?" He's talking about himself. He says there was another William Brandham, a little spot of eternal life down in there from the genes of God. says the word of God that was placed in there. Each one of you can think, Each one of you that are here can think of similar things. It was working. He's talking about eternal life. Your origin didn't come from here. I went I started the school and I left school and I I was born here and they were born forget it. &gt;&gt; I'm very determined friends. I may be more determined than you are. I'm determined that you understand this. &gt;&gt; You did not come from this world. &gt;&gt; You did not have a start down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You did not have a start with mommy and daddy. &gt;&gt; That was not your beginning. &gt;&gt; And neither will it be your end. &gt;&gt; If you came and are an elect of God, you came from the very thoughts and mind of God. He thought of you. He might have thought of you for millions of years. I don't know. How long did he think? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; He thought about where you were, where you're going to be born. what kind of a character you're going to come with. &gt;&gt; In order to make that, I got to have this kind of a person, that kind of a person, another kind. They'll fall in love or whatever they call it down there. And then finally, there'll be the right mix, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because I'm looking for a certain t. &gt;&gt; I've got to have a certain t. I've just got to have a certain quality because it's going to show some side of me. &gt;&gt; I want that kind of a vessel and I will be the essence inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll be the essence inside. &gt;&gt; I'll be the power that drives it. &gt;&gt; No, they won't understand it. They won't understand themselves. But a lot of people don't understand themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I knew you'd like this. I'm just just starting with this. He says, "And then he says, "What brought you here?" Maybe you can identify your mother and father, but they didn't bring you here. I'm not belittling your heritage. I'm not belittling your roots. But you can study your roots all your life and you they are not your roots. &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God or a daughter of God, they are not your roots. &gt;&gt; They can only give you more trouble. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I know. I know something about my heritage. Then one day he said, "I walked on." And that voice calling and he goes back. He he just is using a phrase, "Don't ever drink her." That's when he was about 8 years old. It's gone all the way back &gt;&gt; to when he's just a child. This is his last service. These are his last words. Friends, you never know when you're speaking some of your last words. And I would love dearly love to be able to have the same thoughts. He said it was eternal life working in the body. And one day as I walk, don't never smoke or drink and so forth. And after the young fellows and they all got older, young guys, after the young fellas get older, maybe start your f further education. He said there was something moving and yet all at once he said there came a point. He said, I looked up and I said, I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that was his case. &gt;&gt; And that's a good place to come to. &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, and he's not telling lies. Said they're not of this world even as I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said? Just winding up to a close please. He said all the world Lord help me just bring this to a close said they were sending a man up to the moon. They were sending him astronaut up by the name of John Glenn. They said all the world was captivated by it. Said they were in awe. Saw this man on the end of a rocket getting shot into space. So they were struck with awe saying that he said the whole universe the whole universe will know and the angels will welcome him with a triumph. We're living in an astronaut age. &gt;&gt; You folks that are here, you come here to church. As sure as I'm standing here. Some of you might only be 6, 8 years old. Some of you might be just in your teens. Some of you might be just starting work. Some of you may just be starting a family. Some of you may be on the other end of the spectrum. You've done raised your family and they've gone. You won't go through life without disappointments. But I can tell you one thing is certain. One thing's absolutely certain. I speak without any hesitation to young men and young ladies. You preoccupy yourself with where you're going. &gt;&gt; You preoccupy yourself with a world that's coming. &gt;&gt; And fact is that world is merged already with this world. &gt;&gt; And now you know something. I actually wrote down the statements of this man. And you may not have time to study it like I have. I spent two, three days this last week, but I can tell you I'm telling you friends, you're looking at me as your friend. I'm sure I wouldn't tell you a lie. I'll say to you without any hesitation or question, William Brham was a man expressing the essence of another world. voice. But that's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; Who's speaking? &gt;&gt; Where's it coming from? &gt;&gt; Why is it being said? &gt;&gt; Striving year after year after year to try to get people to believe to believe. Friends, I I declare to you this generation will give answer to that. said, "Didn't you hear it? Didn't you hear it? &gt;&gt; Didn't you believe it?" &gt;&gt; Well, no. I had other things. What other things? &gt;&gt; What other things was it? Well, I had my job and I had &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Friends, is that at the end of the road what's going to be important? &gt;&gt; No. Is that what's at the end of the road? I can speak about those things. And I speak to you solemnly today. I speak to you with all honesty. And I am praying I'm praying this that you will come to a spot. I pray for each one of you. I have prayed. That's what some of you need. You need that moment. And I can tell you exactly what it's like. You're afraid to breathe. You become aruck. And worship is something that has to do with being struck with awe. You know what awe is? A is a reverence that almost is overwhelming to you. A reverence and a commands a reverence. I assure you if Jesus Christ as he did with myself came and stood before you, you'd fall on your face. And now not because I ask you to do that but that would be real worship. It's not that you fall in your face that's worship. It's what happens in your heart. Oh God. And you can do that without falling on your face. Just say oh God. How how lovely you are. How wonderful you are. I wonder brother gonna have brother Derek. I want to sing uh part of that song. I stand in awe in the presence of the Lord. So have as little movement as possible. Yeah.

I don't know. But he was hanging beside the right person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that wonderful, Brother Terry? He was hanging beside the right person. Something came over him. He saw I'm hanging here. I deserve this. This man doesn't deserve it. And he asked chastise his mate. He said, "We're suffering for our evil life. This man has done nothing." And then he got a revelation. Friends, listen to me. He got a revelation even the apostles didn't have. They thought the kingdom was collapsing. And he said, "Lord, when you come into your kingdom, remember me. Remember me, [Music] Brother Bruce. You folks from China. [Music] When we were there were being held, one of the men looked very, very hard. He looked hard. He looked like he come out of the movies. He looked very hard.

[Music] I'm not wanting to touch your emotions right now, but it was really emotional. He We weren't supposed to speak anywhere walking down the hall and he said, "I think I'm going to be here for a long time." He said, "Would you look after my wife and my baby?" I said, "Yes." And the police said, "Don't speak." But this was the last night and we're sitting there having our last meal and this man seemed so hard came and he stood behind this brother John a small man and tapped his shoulder and he said I was good to you. He said, "When you're out of here." And he tapped his heart. He said, "Remember me." I thought he said the right thing. &gt;&gt; He said the right thing. I don't know how God is going to speak to him. But this one, he recognized the right thing. &gt;&gt; He wasn't the thief. He was the policeman. But he said, "When you're out of here, remember me." He's talking about He's talking to somebody was arrested for the gospel. He said, "Remember me this morning. Maybe it isn't much of a message, but happens to be the fourth chapter of John. It happens to be about someone Melzdc who became Jesus. And he was soon heading for the cross. He had done nothing. [Music] And this man was wicked and treacherous thief hanging there and he needed to hang there. But he just says to this other man, "When you come into your kingdom, remember me." That's why I want to sing it. Help me out. [Music] &gt;&gt; He remembered you where you were. &gt;&gt; Then he spoke with love and compassion. Then he took him into paradise. [Music] The ocean is bright. There are no stars in the sky. [Music] The sparrow can fly [Music] then heaven. [Music] There's no feeling like this.
