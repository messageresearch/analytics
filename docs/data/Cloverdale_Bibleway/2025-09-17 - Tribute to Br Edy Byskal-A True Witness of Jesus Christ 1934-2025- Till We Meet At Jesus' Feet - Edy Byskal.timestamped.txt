[0:01] I thank Brother Byskal,
[0:04] Edy, as I know him, a real precious
[0:07] boy. I really fell in love with this
[0:09] young lad when I met him up at Dawson
[0:12] Creek. My first time was Grand Prairie,
[0:14] but he was at Dawson Creek at the time,
[0:16] and I met him there. And and
[0:19] he was telling me about he was
[0:21] missionarying to the Indians, and I said,
[0:22] Eddie, I'm coming up to Canada
[0:25] again one of these days, and I'll drop in
[0:27] and see your friends. He said, Just fine.
[0:30] just a little story to my Indian brethren
[0:33] and all. I like to hunt,
[0:36] oh I just love to hunt my, my! That's my
[0:38] second nature. My conversion never took
[0:40] that out of me and I...I like to tell you a
[0:42] little story about hunting right here
[0:43] where God told me exactly your pastor
[0:46] brother Byskal remembers it, Brother
[0:47] Sothman back there where he told me
[0:49] exactly what I was going to do where I'd
[0:51] go a caribou I'd get where he'd be land a
[0:53] man would have a green checkered shirt on
[0:55] and would kill a grizzly bear before it
[0:57] got back that right
[1:00] Hundreds of people I told went right
[1:02] there and Edy heard me tell it. The
[1:04] day before we left down there two days
[1:07] later he stood right there and seen every
[1:08] bit of it come just to pass. I said the
[1:11] horns will be exactly 42 inches high. And
[1:13] the guide said 42 exactly. He said
[1:15] brother Banham after he said where's that
[1:17] grizzly bear up on top of this mountain?
[1:19] Said brother Branham according to what you
[1:20] told me that you're going to kill a
[1:22] grizzly bear before you get back to where
[1:23] Edy Byskal standing with a green
[1:25] checkered shirt on and his wife and put
[1:26] it in a camp bag and he told me he didn't
[1:28] even have one. Go be somebody's gonna
[1:30] have it. Well, it's going to be there.
[1:32] And he had that green checkered shirt on,
[1:34] said before we get back there. I said
[1:35] that, he said. Brother Branham, I had a
[1:37] brother had epilepsy and you told me when
[1:40] he had this fit again, to jerk his shirt
[1:42] off and throw it into the fire and he wouldn't
[1:43] have it anymore. Well. He did and God
[1:45] healed him of it. Now, he said then I
[1:47] can't disbelieve it, but where's that
[1:49] bear going to be? I said, he's Jehovah
[1:51] Jireh. He can provide himself a bear to
[1:53] make his word come to pass. And when we
[1:55] just about half a mile from him, being
[1:57] about three miles from him, was about a
[1:59] half a mile from him, said, Brother
[2:02] Branham, we just got a half a mile farther.
[2:04] Where's the bear? I said, don't you... I
[2:06] said, what's that, Bud? There was a nine-
[2:08] foot silver tipped grizzly standing up on
[2:10] top of the hill looking right at me. He
[2:13] said we got in 500 yards and said,
[2:15] brother Branham, did you ever shoot a
[2:16] grizzly? I said I shot many bear. He said
[2:18] you better shoot him from here. I said
[2:19] no, the vision said I was right up on
[2:21] him. He said, oh, brother Branham, you said
[2:24] shoot him in the back now, he said, cause
[2:25] if you don't shoot him in the back they
[2:26] are great fighters. I said I know, but
[2:28] this one in the vision I shot in the
[2:29] heart. He said ooh! And I said, just keep
[2:32] going, Bud. We went over another little
[2:33] coulee and came up and it was right close
[2:35] to him, about 200 yards. I said, this is
[2:36] just right. I said wait it until it looks
[2:38] around, looked like a big haystack. H e
[2:40] turned and looked at me, and just as he
[2:42] turned and looked at me, I shot he right
[2:43] smack in the heart. And here he rolled over
[2:45] the hill like that, as far as he could
[2:46] come like that. Bud stood there, turned
[2:48] white in the mouth. He said, brother
[2:49] Branham, I didn't want him on my lap.
[2:53] He said, now if them horn s are exactly 42
[2:56] inches when I get down there, I'm going
[2:57] to have a screaming fit. I said, you
[2:58] better have it right here because it's
[3:00] going to be. He said, I got a measure in my
[3:02] saddlebag, and we got down there. The
[3:04] vision said a little hand would
[3:06] hold the horns. I pulled up beside of Brother
[3:08] Edy there. I said I watch that boy hold
[3:10] that horn and he went around, got that
[3:11] tape measure, brought it out, put it down
[3:13] the base of the head, that little hand, his boy,
[3:16] Blayne, held it, went up there. Bud said
[3:18] mercy, Brother Branham. Right smack on
[3:20] the nose, 42 inches! I said, Bud, He
[3:22] never fails. He was
[3:26] just exactly. Oh, ohh he's God!
[3:29] When we can see something real is
[3:30] genuine. That's what that queen wanted to
[3:33] see, something real.
