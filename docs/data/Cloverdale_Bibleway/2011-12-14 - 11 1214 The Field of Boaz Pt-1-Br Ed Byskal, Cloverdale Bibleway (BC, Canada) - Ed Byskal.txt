And now, Lord, open your word. We open the pages of the book, but you're the only one that can open the word. Pray you'll make it a reality to us in Jesus name. Amen. Well, nice to see everyone out this evening. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. It was just a little delayed reaction there, but it came through. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're really thankful. See, Brother Nathaniel up there. Greetings from your family, Brother Nathaniel. uh with all of Brother Nathaniel's family and his brother David just uh drove us around like a cab driver. I had to thank him so many times I felt embarrassed. I said, "I feel so embarrassed. You pick us up and take us, you know, here and take us there and drive us someplace else." And it was just uh uh really unusual, really very very nice to be with brother Nathaniel's parents and the church there and pastor Elbert. And they send the warmest greetings to you here as well. Also from I was speaking uh to brother uh brother Gear Rudald. He was in Moscow and so we were emailing back and forth and he sends greetings and brother Pankinanin, brother Dystra and brother another brother by the name of brother Bruno. I didn't I wasn't at his church but he was at the meetings. And so it's going to be a wonderful time friends when we gather around the table. &gt;&gt; And uh not only around the table but after that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm looking forward to it. I will have you take your Bibles this evening and uh I'll have to ask for your uh your grace and ask that you will try and uh uh uh absorb things that uh perhaps you've heard or have not heard. But if something strikes your kind of strikes a chord in your heart, uh maybe you just jot it down. Uh I was going to speak on this on Sunday morning and I'm going to continue Sunday morning because I have far too much for this evening, but it's like, you know, preachers are just humans and they say, "Well, I'd like to speak that Sunday morning." Uh but uh I just felt and I said to brother Tom, I'll I'll take the service this evening because I would like to you know in introduce the this thought to the people and then uh then all of you will be here Lord willing Sunday morning and those that are able to come they drive perhaps from Seattle or Mount Vernon and different places. Mary'sville uh not able to be here this evening but uh at least we'll have you know we'll have advanced uh a distance on and we this number of people here will know what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; So on Sunday morning I'm counting on you saying amen. &gt;&gt; I know where I know where we're headed. All right. Uh turn please to the book of Ruth if you would. Now I have been speaking several services on the lamb takes the book and speaks and uh the first two services I didn't get any further than the lamb opening or taking the book and he took the book and Boaz took Ruth and there was the uh an not the analogy but the comparison that we made which is absolutely true. The lamb takes the lamb takes the book and Boaz takes Ruth for wife. And they're speaking about both exactly the same thing. One is in a shadow type and the other's symbolic. So because revelation is a book of symbols. So there's a lamb and he's taking a book. But really what it is, the lamb is a person and it's Christ taking his wife, taking the record of her life and full redemption is the abolishment of everything that we've inherited in this natural life and uh and and having the access to the very nature of Jesus Christ. So, we've been speaking about that and then I took uh one or two services just moving forward on and what the lamb said and then I I took some of what Boaz said. We're going back there now, not to repeat, but I it's like a uh it's like a corner for me in this in this message. So, uh, you'll want to try to don't take it just as a sermon. Go home and then try and remember Sunday morning if you'll take some notes cuz I'm after you sit down, keep your Bibles open because I'm going to continue on in a number of scriptures uh in in the book of Ruth and perhaps elsewhere. All right, I'm going to begin to read at Ruth the 2 chapter and verse 8 uh down to verse 12. And then we will continue down to verse 22 and 23 and read a few verses in the third chapter starting at verse one. Uh verse 8. Then said Boaz, now the lamb is speaking. See the redeemer speaking. Then said Boaz unto Ruth, thou not my daughter. Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, uh, but abide here fast by my maidens. Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them. Have I not charged the young men, that they shall not touch thee? And when thou art to thirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. Then she fell on her face and bowed herself toward the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath been f it hath fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband, and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knowest not hereto for. The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. And then now that is from verse two, from verse 8 to 12 in chapter 2. That's Boaz speaking to Ruth. And now from verse 22 and 23 and into chapter 3:es 1-5, it's Naomi's instruction to Ruth. And if you would please remember, brother Brandham said that Naomi is the old Orthodox church, the Jewish church. So now just I want you thinking for a moment. Then when brother Brham and I'll come back to this in just a moment. When brother Brandham goes to speak about the kinsman redeemer, he he doesn't take it from the New Testament. He takes it from the Old Testament and goes back to the book of Ruth, which is the Old Testament, Old Jewish Orthodox Church. He had to go back there to because that was the only place they could give a clear understanding and interpret what the redemption was actually all about. So we and now uh Ruth is instructing I'm sorry Naomi is instructing Ruth. So just put it in his language now. The old the old Orthodox Jewish church is explaining to Ruth the bride what redemption's all about. And when the prophet came, a gentile prophet came to tell us what redemption was all about, he had to go back to the book of Ruth. You had to go back to the Old Testament to the Jewish church to explain that. And you have to also be mindful that Ruth is a Moabitete. She doesn't know anything about redemption. &gt;&gt; She's never been taught. She's never heard that from her priests. She doesn't know anything about redemption. So, she's hearing something for the first time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now with that setting, and Naomi said, verse 22 of chapter 2, and Naomi said unto Ruth, her daughter-in-law, it is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and they meet thee, not in another field. I want you to get the emphasis. Not in another field. Now Boaz has told her, don't go into another field. Is going to be important between now and Sunday. Don't go into another field. &gt;&gt; And there's lots of fields. &gt;&gt; Men have fields, &gt;&gt; all kinds of fields and and other seed. But this this field happens to be the field of redemption. &gt;&gt; This is the only field of redemption. And so now a mother-in-law is saying, "It's good that you stay in that field &gt;&gt; and not in another field." So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest, and dwelt with her mother-in-law. Verse one of chapter 3. Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?" You know, she, "May I not seek rest for you?" Here's a woman who's a young widow. May I not seek rest for thee? Uh that it may be well with thee. And now is not Boaz our kindred with whose maidens thou was? Behold, he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor. Look at the instructions she's giving her. Wash thyself, therefore, and anoint thee, and put on thy raignment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. And it shall come, it shall be when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet, and lie lay there down, and and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me, I will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; God bless you. As you have your seats, keep your Bibles open, please. In a message, Redeemer Redemption, Brother Bram spoke very early in 1955, he said, notice, and and this is very he's very concise in his wording here. Notice there was a man named Limc. his wife Naomi and they had two sons and they left the land of to sojourn in Moab because they had heard there was bread in Moab. While they were over there, the two sons grew up and married two girls, one of them named Orpa and one of them named Ruth. And the two beautiful pictures. And the two beautiful pictures of the churches. And Naomi, a perfect picture of the Orthodox Church. Naomi, a picture of the Orthodox Church. Orpa, a picture of the lukewarm gentile church. And Ruth, a picture of the bride. Such a beautiful lay as God has laid out in his word by inspiration. Notice then sickness. Alimc died and the two boys died and the women were left alone. Now that's the story &gt;&gt; and you can't get it any clearer than that. And for a full understanding of of the process of redemption, brother Brandham goes back and that's where he takes it from Naomi and the old Jewish church and as as though we gentile bride Ruth is being the example receives revelation. Now, brother Brandham is going back. We wouldn't know the things that we're talking about tonight. We wouldn't know it unless a prophet had gone back and unfolded redemption out of the Old Testament. I've done reading, a little bit of reading what others have said about it. I'm so glad we have a prophet messenger. I tell you what, we'd really be lost and drifting if we didn't have that. How how gracious God has been. And so a as as Ruth is listening to her, Ruth is listening to Naomi, her mother-in-law, the old Orthodox Jewish church. She's listening saying, "Anoint yourself and wash and uh put on your garments and do this and you'll go there and and uh and she gives her all full instruction." And she doesn't know it, but she's actually being led into redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's she's being encouraged, instructed by Boaz, and being instructed by Ruth as well. So, the kinsman redeemer is instructing her and her mother-in-law, the old Orthodox church, is instructing her. And we have exactly the same thing. We've had a prophet now, Christ making himself known. Boaz has been instructing us. And the old Orthodox Church has been instructing us. and they're both saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so it's it's interesting. I whenever I get on with something like this, I then I start finding out just exactly the statistics of how brother Brandham approached the subject because to me it's become a very very important subject. And for the subject of the for the subject of the breach which was between the church ages and the seals, brother Brandham goes back to the book of Ruth and the account of how she was redeemed. And that's the breach between the two, which is Revelation 5. He refers to he refers to Boaz as the kinsman redeemer. not always as the kinsman redeemer, but he refers to Boaz and and uh in his in his ministry a total of 69 times. 69 times. 58 times prior to the breach. This is really remarkable. 58 times prior to the breach, he refers to Boaz. And in the breach uh is five times in the breach and the seals. five times in the breach in the seals and then only once in n the whole year in 1964 only mentions his name once and only once in 1965 in the whole year. Why? Because the message and redemption has been laid out and done. &gt;&gt; That should say something to us. &gt;&gt; That was his ministry. And so he's preparing the people all through the years and speaking about even you go back 1955 in the early 50s he's talking about Boaz and Ruth and Naomi and explaining the whole thing and comes all the way up and all of those times and then after it's revealed in the breach it's it's essentially over. &gt;&gt; He doesn't go back to it. Now you want to take and note that in your mind when you when you come across that now when you hear that then you'll know you'll have an overview of the picture this indeed was a messenger that was calling the bride a gentile bride uh and and Christ himself coming there the kinsman redeemer giving us instructions through that messenger. Hallelujah. and going back perfectly uh perfectly according to the scripture going back into the Old Testament in order to reveal it to the bride because that's exactly how it happened. Isn't it beautiful? &gt;&gt; It's just absolutely perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now Ruth as a Moabitete as I said earlier she does not know anything about the law of redemption. That's this is this has been given by the prophet Moses to the Israelites certainly not the Moabites. And u now in in the third chapter Ruth I'll have you look at the 11th verse with me. And now Boaz is speaking. And now, my daughter, fear not. And notice this next line, I will do to thee all that thou requireest. For all the city of For all the city of my people do know that thou art a virtuous woman. That's the only thing she has to stand on. Thou art a virtuous woman. But he but now he's talking to a a woman that uh is not only a widow. She's uh she's childless. She is in a strange country. Uh she's in a a field uh that's owned by a near kinsman to her mother-in-law. She doesn't know that. She's picking up and gleaning seeds just trying to She's so much like you and I &gt;&gt; this evening that are sitting here. &gt;&gt; She's just out there. She's working hard. She's trying to make ends meet. She's just trying to survive. She's had sorrow in her life. She's trying to cope with that. She's got a relationship with her mother-in-law and she doesn't know what the future is. Uh we can all uh identify ourselves with parts of her life. &gt;&gt; There's nothing strange about this. She's just exactly uh where you and I are or have been. &gt;&gt; We've we've experienced all those things. This isn't some nice, you know, poetic story. This is real life. &gt;&gt; In our language, this is where the rubber hits the road. &gt;&gt; She's just experiencing everyday things. And furthermore, spiritually speaking, she does not know like you and I, when we first came in contact with this uh the message and the spirit of God, the spirit of Christ be to draw us and speak to us, we didn't know that this was redemption happening. And and furthermore, I I just want you to catch a couple of these things. Now she's picking up gleaning is picking up seeds that other reapers have dropped. &gt;&gt; So she's actually living on seed that doesn't mean enough to others to pick it up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the revelation that you got and the revelation that you live on is what others have dropped. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And those are seeds of redemption. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, she's in a field of redemption, &gt;&gt; picking up seeds of redemption &gt;&gt; under the instruction of the redeemer himself. &gt;&gt; Things don't get much better, do they? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can't hardly wait till Sunday. And so she needs a lot of things done for her, &gt;&gt; but she perhaps doesn't she may not fully understand even what he's saying. I will do all I will do to thee all that thou requireest. And then in the 18th verse, then then said she, uh, this is Naomi now speaking to Ruth. Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall. For the man will not be in rest until he hath finished the thing this day." In other words, he is going to finish this work of redemption. And and and and so she's instructing her, "Just sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall, for the man will not be in rest." In other words, he has started something and he's not going to stop till this whole program is finished. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What glorious instruction. He's going to finish the work of redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the fourth chapter verse 5 now he has now Boaz has determined to uh uh do the work of redemption. There was a nearer kinsman. We won't get into that right now. And he said he cannot he he he he would redeem Naomi but he felt it would mar his inheritance if he redeemed Ruth as well. And so he says and and then said Boaz the fifth verse of the fourth chapter. What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitis, for the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. That was the stickler &gt;&gt; right there. If the day that you buy and purchase and redeem Naomi's estate, you will you must also buy it of Ruth. And the thing with Ruth was that you had to go further because redemption. Now, I'm going to just say something that is is is uh something that I had to really think about for the last two three days. Redemption was not just the purchasing of a parcel of ground. or uh redeeming a a a lost estate. In so doing, because redemption is connected with inheritance, &gt;&gt; and inheritance had to uh depended upon uh uh a lineage &gt;&gt; that could inherit it, right? And you'll find it. I I'll have it for you if not tonight, Sunday, and show you that Moses gave strict instructions. If if uh if this one could not uh inherit it, if there was no one to inherit it, then a brother would inherit it. If the brother couldn't inherit it, then uh daughters would inherit it. daughters, there's other siblings, other members, and even the brother of the of the father. It had to stay within the tribe. It had to stay there had to be an ongoing, in other words, redemption also had to have continuity. &gt;&gt; And it had to have continuity within the framework of the family. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is so rich, friends. I just need to I need to say that to you. And so he's he's saying that and when he's saying it before the people and what day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitis the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance and that is to raise up children. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why in the New Testament, the Pharisees, scribes and Pharisees and leaders said to Jesus, "There was a man and he had his wife and and he didn't have any children and uh and he died." And then his brother took him and he died. And the next brother took him and there were so a number of brothers and they all had her the wife in the resurrection. whose wife shall she be? And he said that they don't know the power of God. And they just he he rebuked them because they didn't understand what they were talking about. And uh and so now what they were what they were referring to is the law of redemption in the Old Testament. And so now redemption refers not only to a parcel of ground. Thus it was not only that a physical parcel of ground be redeemed, but that also that seed should be raised up to give continuity to the inheritance. And so redemption is tied to inheritance. Boaz clearly states that his responsibility is to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. Now, just if you think that we're way off in left field, we're not. You have an inheritance, but it's in Christ. &gt;&gt; And Paul caught this in Romans and he said, he said in Romans 7, and brother Brennham takes that for the in, I believe, the invisible union of the bride message. Notice I'm giving you a lot to think about, but he used it in the invisible union of the bride uh message and it was at a thanksgiving. He said, "What a thanksgiving message." &gt;&gt; And he goes to Romans 7. Know he not that a a woman is bound to her husband by the law of her husband as long as as he liveth. But if he's dead, if he dies, then she's free from the law of her husband. and and the and the prophet starts speaking h about that. Now, I'm just giving you a quick overview just so you can kind of see where I'm going. He says, "And but if their husband be dead, then she's no longer bound. She's free from the law of her husband." But then he goes right into and Apostle Paul says, um, he says this, "So then, if while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband be dead, she is free from that law. Free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, &gt;&gt; that you should be married to another, &gt;&gt; even to him who is raised from the dead. So I'm going to say a mouthful now. There's the the church world for much of the church world at least. They are actually married to and united to the Jesus who walked here. Now be spiritual if you would please. The Jesus who walked here a little over 2,000 years ago. Apostle Paul is saying that's not it's not that physical attachment that we're married to. We're married to another. He died so that he could rise. And the one that rose was significantly different than the one that died. The one that died got older. The one that rose doesn't age. The one that died died carrying the sins of the world. the one that rose, he he was finished with it. The battle was over. Sin was dealt with. &gt;&gt; And he says, "So that you could be married to another, even him that is raised from the dead, so that you can bear fruit unto him." &gt;&gt; This has to do with inheritance. This has to do with redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus. Now we say the bride of Christ. The bride of Christ. the bride of Christ. Just please keep this in mind. Jesus didn't take a wife. The lamb didn't take a wife to be childless. He took a wife to bring forth fruit unto himself. &gt;&gt; We are those that replicate. We are those that reproduce. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the ministry of Christ even within the body of Jesus Christ is bringing forth other children. And so that Jesus could say, "Behold, I and the brethren thou hast given me. &gt;&gt; Behold, I and the family that you've given me." &gt;&gt; And that's why he said to through Isaiah, "Where's my family? Where's my house? Where's my household?" In other words, the heavens my hand is made and the earth is my foottool. Where's my children? Where's my house? Where's my family? And we can say now with what we have uh what we understand through a message in this time and the fullness of redemption, the fullness of redemption is somebody died and Ruth's husband died. He had to die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You you don't try to figure these things out. Uh Uriah died. &gt;&gt; Even Even David played a hand in having him killed. But he had to die because she had to be married to another one who was David. &gt;&gt; You say amen if you want. I'll still preach. Even if you don't say amen. He had to die because she had to bring forth Solomon. And Uriah could never bring forth Solomon. &gt;&gt; These all are deeper truths than you know than we just take on the surface. &gt;&gt; And there's deeper things happening in the book of Ruth. And there are deeper things happening with you in this message of redemption than you ever dreamed of. Ruth never grasped. She couldn't even begin to comprehend what was happening while it was happening. And we are not comprehending what is happening now. &gt;&gt; Really what's happening? &gt;&gt; You think that she could well she's out there picking a seed trying to survive and not even knowing she's in the field of redemption. And she's she's bearing she's bringing forth seeds of redemption. She's bringing them back to Naomi. Do you think that she's going along saying, "Oh, isn't it wonderful? The God of Israel is going to bring forth the line lineage of the kings through me." Not a chance. I wasn't in her mind. And you don't even you you haven't got a clue what God is doing. You You're just out here struggling day by day trying to pay your bills to trying to put enough food on the table. That's what she was doing. And she had sorrow in her life and we have sorrow in our lives and we're trying to deal with different relationships and she was trying to deal with it and all of these things. It's exactly the same. But she was being redeemed. Hallelujah. She was right in the field of redemption. And I will say to you that uh on the authority of what the prophet of God has said and he spoke about uh uh he spoke on and you can get it in the rising of the sun, the one that is risen now and the one who's demonstrating himself now. And he said like it is today and he describes of all about Boaz and then he goes right back and speaks about Christ that was risen and he's and he's alive and risen now. So he ties what was back there with what is happening now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So now the right we talk about the rights of redemption had also to do with bringing forth seed, &gt;&gt; bringing forth children to inherit on behalf of the one that died and did or could not bring forth a child. So redemption has a much greater meaning in the Bible than for a kinsman to merely buy back the estate of the family member. And uh there's several times brother Brandham refers to the lost estate. You see the lost estate wasn't money in the bank or a piece of ground or whatever. That wasn't only the lost estate. the lost estate was something that was inherited. Now, just so on on Sunday, I'll want to go back. I'll go into this in more detail, but you know, we we we may not think of that God is mindful of certain specific places. And I thought, well, I was thinking about that and I begin to look into the scripture and uh the Bible says that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. So, he owns everything. &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. &gt;&gt; So, but then but then we find out that he planted a garden and I'll be going into this more detail, so don't don't feel I'm just repeating it on Sunday. But then he planted a garden and and it was east of Eden. And then in the midst of the garden, these are all places. These are all s specific spots. And in the midst of the garden was the tree of life. And then you go on down and then uh Adam and Eve are dismissed out of the garden. They're sent out from this place. And then you find uh uh this same God. Now he's going to commence uh the whole plan of redemption. He's going to uh choose Abraham. And he speaks to Abram. Abram. He's not Abraham yet, but he speaks to Abram and tells him where to go. And he goes and then when he when he he meets him there and he tells him to this land now where he's gone because he's been obedient. I'm going to give you and I'm going to give your seed this land from the great river from the river Euphrates to the great river of Egypt. And he begins to give the actual parameters of that land. And not just the parameters of the land, but I'm giving this land to your seed &gt;&gt; for an inheritance. And the and the prophet of God tells us so we can bring it right up to this morning or this evening rather that it that the promised land is your life in the Holy Ghost. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now a promise is not merely an inheritance. A promise is not nearly merely an inheritance because an inheritance is actually a possession. It's something that you actually possess and you uh uh you you you may enjoy it and without even knowing. The reason I'm being a little cautious is because we're streaming and people be listening to this elsewhere. you're you're sitting here in the church and and uh you know children are going to school and you go down to the camp and all this and so on and so forth and but we we perhaps don't know exactly how it all happens. I don't know how it all happens. I know that the people work, the people give, and so on so forth. But I was, and I'm I'm trying to be sensitive about this, but there's a man who none of you have met. And uh he's a very um he he's a man if he were here, he would not be visible. Uh he would not you would have a difficulty getting any words out of him. I've had he became a good friend of mine. I I had difficulty having conversation with him because he didn't say anything and I'd ask him a question and he would you yeah you know and answer the question and so on and uh I met him a lot of years ago. He passed away and left almost his entire estate to the Lord's work to this church and the missions and the Lord's work and it was several hundred,000. Now you don't know anything about that and that is some time ago. That's not, you know, ages ago. That's in recent times. you don't know anything about that. And so people have wondered, you know, well, how are we able to, you know, doing this and doing that? It's because, and that's only happened once in our we've been, you know, next year is our 40th anniversary here in Cloverdale. Should we have a meeting? &gt;&gt; I I think it's time to say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we don't know anything about that. We We don't know. and we're sitting here and you know we're enjoying things and we're you know just going on and maybe it be the missions and this is happening and we're rejoicing it but we don't know how it happens. Ruth is out there and she's just plucking a seed here and a seed there and getting a little bit and going back to her mother-in-law and and you know trying to survive and and here in and God in the meantime is doing something way beyond her understanding. And it's not it's not God that comes down and and details everything and this is what's happening and this is what I'm doing and this is where you're going and this is your reward and all of these wonderful things things that we would like to know but we don't need to know. It's like the disciples saying to the Lord Jesus, oh cuz now he had the resurrection just happened just happened a month a month and a half ago. He said is this a time now you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel? and they told him it's not for you to know the times of the seasons. They actually have described that down. &gt;&gt; I often think of that. How would you feel about being one of the fellows who want to ask the question then he tells you it's none of your business. It's none of my business. It's not for you to know the times of the seasons God put in his own hand. But they had to write that too cuz that was also the words of Jesus. &gt;&gt; All kinds of things we want to know. We just love to know all these things, but we don't need to know. And and I it's enough for us to know that what we don't know is more wonderful than what you do know. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the estate, when you talk about the estate, Naomi's estate didn't just involve some ground. It involved her. It involved all that her life was. It didn't involve Orpa because she had gone back to her gods. But it involved Ruth. There she had her. That's when she made her glorious decision. Where you go, I go. Your people be my people. She doesn't even know your God will be my God. She doesn't even understand what she's saying. You must understand what I'm saying &gt;&gt; when I say she doesn't understand what she was saying or what she didn't realize the implication of it and where it was going to carry her. But that was a glorious decision. And brother Brandham talks about Ruth deciding and Ruth serving and Ruth rewarded and so on the four stages of her life. &gt;&gt; But the estate, the lost estate included her. And it didn't only included include her. It included the fact that there was a responsibility to raise up children to her on the head of her husband. &gt;&gt; So that the inheritance could continue. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I have to just hold myself back. Now, if you want to turn to Numbers, the 27th chapter, and I'll just warn you ahead of time. I'm probably going to close the service before you want to go home, but we're only going to carry it so far. And and I know you got a busy schedule. Numbers the 27th chapter, and we'll uh start with verse 8. And thou shalt speak, God telling Moses, now thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, if a man die and have no son, then you then you shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. So now the inheritance becomes very very important. It happens to be a key issue in the Bible. and you have an inheritance. Friends, let me just stop here and you can look this way for a moment. An inheritance. We say, well, there's many, many promises. I like the message that brother Tom preached and that spoke to brother uh Ricardo so powerfully when he spoke on unclaimed promises. Oh yeah, they're there and we agree with them and they're good and all these things and it belongs to somebody. Maybe it belongs to the preacher. I don't know, but maybe I might need it. Uh and he talked about all the things that came back from the campus sitting out here in the fellowship room and it it belonged to somebody belong to you kids belong to somebody's family. We couldn't get them picked up till we're making announcements. If you don't pick it up, we're sending it to the Salvation Army. And it's always been a marvel to me, brother Richard Drake, I think he sent some tons of stuff overseas that he just picks up that people leave on the buses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right, brother Richard? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Well, wherever he gets it. I've talked to the I've talked to the airlines and they've told me, "You wouldn't believe what people leave on the airplanes." Well, somebody got a beautiful leather coat of mine cuz I just got off and ran right back in and it was gone. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die and have no son, verse 8, then thou then you shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. And if he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. And if he have no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. And if his father have no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him for his family, and he shall possess it. &gt;&gt; That's the key. He shall possess it. This inheritance isn't something to hang on the wall. &gt;&gt; This inheritance isn't something say, "Oh, I got a promise. I I I'm left in some will." That's not what he's talking about. This is a real possession. And the word inheritance in the Bible is to possess it. &gt;&gt; It's not something that somebody just promised you. Says, "Oh, God has given so many promises in his in his word." That's not sufficient. You have to come to the place to say that promise I have claimed it and it is mine. I actually possess it now. And once you possess it, then what are you going to do with it? Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, this man left an inheritance to this church and to the Lord's work. And I can tell you, we didn't just stuff it in a sack and bury it in the ground. No, it's there to be used. It's there for the people to benefit from. It's there that somebody hears the gospel. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what it's all about? That's what our life is all about. And that the kingdom of God is filled. And what do we talk about when we say until the last seed comes in? That's the last child. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the children are part of the inheritance. &gt;&gt; It's not just some promises. It's reality. &gt;&gt; It's people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That are predestinated and they must come. And that's part of our inheritance. We're going to rejoice when we see we say, "Well, I didn't know that, you know, my life was having that kind of influence." God doesn't have to explain that to us. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to tell us all of those things. And so the you can't read these few verses about four verses without finding out very quickly that the emphasis is on the inheritance. Right. &gt;&gt; And it's not just the children of Israel having some inheritance in a piece of ground. Our inheritance is much richer than that and goes far beyond uh just that. For unto this people, now we want to go turn to Joshua please. The first chapter and the first verse. Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon, that have I given unto you. Brother Brandham says footsteps are possession. &gt;&gt; I have given unto you as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. This is God speaking. &gt;&gt; And God spoke in this generation. And you know what he said? Your name is Mrs. Bishop and you live at such and such an address. He knew I would say at that moment that became a sacred thing to that individual. Oh, don't they call you Mary or don't they call you something else? And your your address and where you live is this. You live in a city. I see a city. It's a it's got a lot of trees. It's not this city. It's another city. And here's the same God identifying where that person lives. &gt;&gt; And that God has come down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To give them what the city couldn't give them, the social net couldn't give them. Nothing else could give it. Uh uh the unemployment insurance couldn't give it. Nothing else could give it. But now God himself had come down and was speaking through a messenger telling them where they live to help them believe the promise so it can go from a promise to an inheritance. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I want this congregation and all who are listening and streaming, it needs to go from a promise to a possession. If you just live it in the promise and well, it's out here someplace. It's out here. Your life will turn all kinds of dips and circles. But when you have a possession and it's in the bank, you're not hoping anymore. You got it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have it. &gt;&gt; That's important, friends. I don't want a pie in the sky religion. &gt;&gt; I don't want something that just got a bunch of hope up there. I want reality down here. &gt;&gt; And there shall verse five. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of a good courage. Now, here's why he wants them to be strong and of a good courage. For unto this people, this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give to them. Just stop there for a moment. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. But now you can't read these few verses without coming to the realization and confess that this is a there's a very special place on this earth that says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. Now suddenly a certain spot has become very very sacred and very important because now God in his mind says I have a man his name is Abraham. He I even took a part of my name and inserted his name. He's my friend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's barren. And I'm going to give his wife and him a son. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him a son of promise. &gt;&gt; God never spoke about all the others that were given, but he spoke about that one. I'm giving him a son of promise because God is speaking his own heart because I have a son who is a son of promise. Hallelujah. I'm going to give him Isaac, but my son will be Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And I've got to give him I've got to give him so that the the the inheritance that slipped out of Adam's hands can continue. And and because he died, somebody has to die uh to bring forth seed and life on the head of this one who died. So there was a first Adam, but there has to be a second Adam. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me see a little bit where I want to go. &gt;&gt; Only be thou strong. Verse seven. Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. And now Joshua 24 and verse 28 short verse but I want you to say it. So Joshua let the people depart every man &gt;&gt; unto his inheritance. &gt;&gt; I would like the congregation to read it together. So Joshua, let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every man, every person. You're sitting here on a Wednesday night, but as far as God's mind is concerned, and those of you that are streaming, I'm saying this with a certain conviction in my own heart. God who gave the promise now is saying and and he's saying to now Joshua he's saying now you go and take the people and you div and you bring them into their inheritance and divide the inheritance to them. They actually did it by lots and at the end of the book they every man departed and went and possessed his inheritance. Listen friends, that's the program. &gt;&gt; And this message has to go far beyond just a message, a book that you read or a taste that you hear. It must those promises must become possessions to you. &gt;&gt; I own that. &gt;&gt; That is mine. This obstacle comes this seems to be in reverse. It's not in reverse. God who gave this promise, I already have possessed it. I take it as a possession. &gt;&gt; And you don't hope for a possession. That is why faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; Faith when you actually have come full circle and you've gone from promise to possession, then you don't have to anymore uh worry about it or be concerned about it. You possess it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if you said, "Well, uh uh you know, someone has promised me something and they've promised me whatever whatever and and and someone promised me their car. Someone promised me $1,000 or whatever it is, and and now you have it and it's been given to you. You have it in the bank or you have the car in your parking lot or your driveway. You don't say, you don't go, you know, twisting and ringing your hands and oh, I just hope I hope I get that car. It's sitting right out there. &gt;&gt; Just have a look at it. It's a reality. Faith will make the promise real. &gt;&gt; Faith will make the promise a substance. &gt;&gt; And that's why that is what I am so thrilled with with the prophets ministry. And I don't want to just leave it back on the prophet because a lot of people say, "Well, he did it." No, he did it so that you could do it. &gt;&gt; He did it to give an example. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it is a reality, friends. And I can tell you amongst the bride of Jesus Christ, there are supernatural things that are happening on a daily and a regular basis. &gt;&gt; Because you don't hear it doesn't mean it's not happening. And then you go on down the road a little while and then you find out it did happen &gt;&gt; and it is happening. &gt;&gt; Then you say, "Well, praise the Lord." Praise the Lord before it happens. &gt;&gt; Demonstrate your faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what he loves to see and hear. &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes. Even then on into Judges, it says Judges 2 and six, which is the next book uh or the yeah the book before rather. And when and when Joshua let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. Unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land that I swear unto their fathers. That's what it's all about. God is saying, "I have swore this &gt;&gt; under I'm under oath &gt;&gt; that this must happen. This is their inheritance." He &gt;&gt; said, "Well, this this king failed and that and they've gone into they've gone into captivity. They've gone into Babylon. Didn't change anything. &gt;&gt; Didn't change anything. And you can just as listen young people you even if you read the newspapers or hear the news at all or are in touch with it and you adults you know right well the world's in an upheaval. &gt;&gt; But do you know with all of this they've called it the in the Middle East I think they call it the Arab Spring or something. I I heard quite a bit about while while I was in Europe and uh and now they're thinking that maybe Russia is actually having it because Mr. Putin is having he got himself voted in or at least they think that he got himself voted in. There's tens of thousands and normally they would crush any kind of uprising like that but there's tens of thousands all the way through Siberia and up into Moscow and all over raising. They said it's a it's the most uh riots that they've had in Russia for for I guess decades. And normally they would never have allowed it, but it's too too big to for it to uh to put down. They can't quell that. But they're talking about this and how it started. So they're saying they're hoping that maybe what happened in the Middle East, it happened here and happened in Europe and happened and we got occupy and United States and Canada and all the rest of it. But everybody jumps on the bandwagon and a lot of people perhaps don't even know what the what the cause or what the real objective is at all. They're just out there to hoot and holler and be a part of something. You have to forgive me if you don't agree with that. But nevertheless, &gt;&gt; but if you read in the fine line or the small print, when I say small print, it's because it's just maybe a just a paragraph, not even a paragraph, a line or two. And all of this was happening. It happened in Tunisia and then in uh Egypt and then uh Libya and all and it's happening even right now still in Syria and uh thousands have been killed and and they're crushing it with tanks and big guns. This is happening while we're sitting here. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The terrible unrest. But you'll find one line, a common denominator in all of them, that the world nations have to make peace with Palestine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Do you know what that's all about? That's all about what God said. &gt;&gt; I'll give them the land from the Euphrates down to the great river of Egypt from the sea over to this place. And you go on to Google and just get the original map of the promised land and you'll see what the trouble's all about &gt;&gt; cuz the devil's howling cuz it's places that he squatted on. &gt;&gt; That's right. and they'd probably throw me in jail and shoot me for saying something like that in certain parts of the world, but that's what this Bible says. &gt;&gt; And those and there are people in Israel, there are some people in Israel, not many, but there's a few in Israel that said what God has said is true &gt;&gt; and what God has promised is our possession. &gt;&gt; And we don't know how, but we believe it's going to happen. And that's why they are arc enemies and considered arc enemies. And the spirit that's driving what they call a spring, a spirit that's driving that and it's just horrific bloodshed and they're upsetting the dictators and everything. And the world thinks this is all great and wonderful. It's fine. But they'll find that there's a common denominator in all of those uprisings. And I read it with my own eyes. I because I'm just looking for it as I read the whole article. Brother Ernie, then I see. And they must make peace with the Palestinians. Uhhuh. There you are, &gt;&gt; you serpent. &gt;&gt; You can't hide behind a riot. You can't hide behind world news. There you are. We already have it in the word of God. We have a prophet telling us that that God is turning back to them. And and this may just sound like so much hot air over a pulpit. I can tell you that regardless of what the world scene is, what this says is is truth. &gt;&gt; What this says is going to happen. &gt;&gt; What this says, we got to anchor our soul on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that we can stand here today and say, "God sent us a messenger. God sent us a prophet. And you didn't know that you were in a field of vindication. You didn't know when you were first reading your first message that this is a field. I'm in the field of redemption. &gt;&gt; And then as as time went on and we've experienced this and perhaps we all have and and I've had new things come into the message and great. I mean just so wonderful. The only problem was it was in somebody else's field. &gt;&gt; So, I'll confess to you because I'm going to close now. Anyway, I'll confess to you, I have gone up to the fence and I did look over and it made me go back and study things a wee bit. And I kept looking over and the more I looked over, the more I found that that wasn't really the right field. I better stay in this one. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And that's why Boaz said, Boaz said, redeemer said, don't go in another field. &gt;&gt; And the mother of the old Orthodox church said, "It's good for you to stay in that field. Don't go in another field." And that's why we've been so strong here over this pulpit. This is the message. Don't go looking for some other seeds. This is the field of redemption. This is the word of redemption. And these are the seeds that are going to bring you to Boaz. &gt;&gt; And the further you go along, you'll find out, oh my, this is getting rich. This is more than Oh my, I don't hardly know what to do with this. This is so glorious. Of course, because he's telling them, drop a little extra down. Brother Brandham says, "Oh, don't you like getting those handfuls?" Hallelujah. And I pray God will give us a few handfuls over this weekend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so I'm just going to I'm I'm going to just read this quote and we're going to be closing so the musicians can get ready to come. And this is this is from 1953. So, I just wanted to drop that in this from 1953 before a bunch of you people were born. I won't ask you, but this is on the an end sign. An end sign. As Boaz had to be Naomi's kinsman, God to redeem the church must be a kinsman. And he came down, taken on himself the form of sinful flesh. He was worthy. He was God's son. He had to be worth it. He had all the heavens and all the earth. Boaz then gathered Israel. And then this is when he was going to make his announcement of redemption. And then remember the end sign had to be lifted up outside the gates of the city. Now watch this very very closely. The end sign had to be lifted up outside the gates of the city. And I want you to get it. And Boaz came out there and brought the Israel elders and said, "Now, if anyone has got anything to say, let them say it. And see this day that I have redeemed Naomi's lost estate." I didn't just redeem Naomi. I've redeemed Naomi's lost estate. Everything that's included in that. And part of the estate was not only Naomi, a physical one, a piece of ground, a physical piece of ground, and Ruth Moabites uh daughter-in-law, part of the estate. But the fact was that she had to have seed to raise up a to raise up a name upon her upon her dead husband so that the inheritance could continue. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And see this day I've redeemed Naomi's lost estate." And he kicked off his shoe and threw it amongst threw it amongst the Israelites, which was the custom and end sign that he had redeemed Naomi and all she had. There's the son of God. The last paragraph now. There's the son of God lifted up for your end sign. As Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so must and just the same way, same cause, same thing. Then what did he do when he lifted uh when he lifted up there? When he God lifted up the end sign to the world, he showed to his church. Tonight, he showed to the world that he had redeemed all the lost estate of the church and the people. And what is our loss if you have lost your salvation? Here's the end sign for the sins of the world. What a pity. And then do you mean to tell me that you can deny you could deny divine healing? There it is in the scripture. So he's pointing back. There it is in the scripture. And that's what Jesus said. Just as Moses lifted up the serpent, so must the son of man be lifted up. So he's going from Moses to Calvary. So must the Son of Man be lifted up for sin and sickness. And he's here tonight. So he went from Moses went from Moses to Calvary, from Calvary to 1953. And I feel authorized tonight to go from 1953 to 2011. &gt;&gt; He cannot change. He is the same yesterday. &gt;&gt; Today &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And how thankful we are. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; This God's real. &gt;&gt; Healing is real. Salvation is real. Deliverance is real. And your inheritance is more than a promise. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's here tonight. He's still lifted up and he has put he was put into the grave and God lifted him up and his spirit is among us tonight doing the doing signs and wonders and he asked do you believe it &gt;&gt; and I say yes &gt;&gt; Lord I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and you can put it to the test. &gt;&gt; It's not just a promise. &gt;&gt; It's a possession. &gt;&gt; And some of us are perhaps enjoying the benefits of the possession without even fully realizing. You know, it's it's it's something that's handed on down. It goes from, you know, family to family. But God was so uh so determined and that's why you can see it all the way back to the instructions given to Moses. And it the son will it'll go to the son. If he hasn't got a son, it'll go to the daughter. If he hasn't got a daughter, it'll go to uh go to another family member. If they haven't got any family member, if it go to his brother, if he hasn't got a brother, it'll go to the nearest kinsman. Somebody's got a In other words, what God is saying, there's got to be somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's close by. &gt;&gt; Because this thing has to continue. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends exactly what the scripture says of of this kinsman, this kinsman that has shown himself alive in this day. What he had rose up to do in this ministry, it's not going to stop till it's finished. And when a prophet talks about the last seed, you can just settle it. The last seed is out there someplace. And when he said and when he comes in or she comes in, we're out of here. &gt;&gt; And you say, "How is that going to I don't know how. And I don't care how." It's exactly like the disciples asking, "Is it now or is it are you going to restore the kingdom now?" I'm not concerned about how it's going to work and the logistics of the whole thing and how the sweep and how the body is going to change. I don't know. But it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the prophet talks about those that are left here. &gt;&gt; We don't want to we don't want to major on that. But that's a reality also. &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks about weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. God help us. I I wouldn't I hate to think that anybody sat in the congregation and had to slip into that kind of an attitude and atmosphere. This word is absolutely real, friends. And you and I of all people of the earth, all the people that have lived since there there's the people of the Old Testament, just think what they would have done if they would have uh if they would have had a a messenger that told them now, you come from a certain city and you come to a certain place and your address is such and such. I tell you what, God knew precisely where they were. Right. &gt;&gt; Look, God thought so much of it. I'm I'm I know I'm taking a couple more minutes, but God thought so much of it that when Saul was looking for the donkeys of his father that were lost that even they come before the prophet and he tells them, "Oh, they've been found. &gt;&gt; The animals have been found." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, if if if Brother Brandham had said that at the platform to somebody said, "Oh, you know, the dog that you've been looking for or the donkeys that your father's been looking for, they're found. Don't worry about it. They're found." That would hardly find a place in a message book, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Well, what's that?" God thought enough about that to put it in his holy Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not the man. &gt;&gt; It's not the donkeys that did something special. It's not any other man. It's God who arranged the whole thing. &gt;&gt; And God wants people to be simple enough to say that is supernatural. That's not a man. That's God. &gt;&gt; That's not William Brandham. That's not even some people here. This is the almighty God that has done this thing. And we're going to give him glory for that. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, as you do and you give him the respect, you'll you'll find that he'll just pour more out. &gt;&gt; More out all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let Let's stand to our feet, would you, please? and we're going to tell him how wonderful he is. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; The word that you have left us and the things that you are unfolding to us, oh God. And I'm asking you tonight, Lord, that you'll prepare the hearts of these people. And you see what's on my heart and the things I'm holding back and the things, oh God, I've been pondering, things I've been wondering, is this almost too wonderful? Oh God, give us supernatural minds. Give us understanding. Father, I pray, oh God, you lead us by the Holy Spirit that the right things will be spoken, the right things will be said. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray you'll banish every question. You'll banish every doubt, Father, and that you will uh infuse us with a spirit of revelation, Lord. I pray you'll bless the young people and the children. We know they have a busy day tomorrow and tomorrow evening. I pray, Father, in this busy time that we will not be caught up, oh God, in all of the circus of the world, but that we will be caught up with you, Father. And let us be in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. For this world is passing away, and the glory of it, and all of the all of the all of the tinsel and the flesh and the glitter will be gone. But he that does the word of God will be forever. We thank you, Father, for the group of people that are here this evening and pray you'll bless us, Lord, as we come to a a close. And we I want to worship you and thank you now in Jesus name. Amen. Let let's sing. Brother Ryan, I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed with the Christ. My Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody ask you just who I am, tell him I am redeemed. Oh yes, I am redeemed. But with the price, Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody ask you just who I am, tell them I am. [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. There's a a song I want to sing a couple verse of it and it's the same. Redeemed redeemed how I love to proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many know it? &gt;&gt; Good. We got lots of voices there. I want you to sing it. Think of the words as we go.

I know that of his presence with me as contin [Music] I And the former I know I shall see in his beauty. King my first step and give me songs in the night. redeemed my love. Redee his child and whatever I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Was it worth coming out Wednesday night? &gt;&gt; Good. Good. Turn around. Shake hands with another redeemed one. [Music] Amen. Redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed by the divine all the lamb. Redee his child and forever I am. Don't sit down. You're all dismissed in Jesus name. You got a busy day tomorrow and you've had a I appreciate you coming out this evening. And just pray God will give you a safe journey home and don't drive too fast. Uh a lot of it when the road looks black, it can be pretty icy. So you just be real real careful. God bless you in Jesus name. You're dismissed. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
