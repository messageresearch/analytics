[7:54] Father, we raise our hands to you this
[7:56] morning, Lord Jesus. And our hope this
[7:59] morning is in you, Lord Jesus. We look
[8:02] away from the things of this world this
[8:04] morning and we look into your beauty
[8:07] this morning, Lord Jesus. And we thank
[8:10] you, Father, for allowing us to come
[8:12] into your house this way this morning
[8:14] and worship you, Lord. You're worthy of
[8:17] our praise, Lord Jesus. We love you,
[8:20] Lord Jesus. We worship you, Lord Jesus.

[9:17] Oh, my home

[9:25] forever more.
[9:28] [Music]
[9:31] Amen. Aren't you thankful to have your
[9:33] hope in the Lord?
[9:35] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of places to put
[9:36] your trust and put your confidence. It's
[9:38] so wonderful to be anchored into him,
[9:40] isn't it? This morning, Amen. I have one
[9:42] prayer request. I'm going to ask brother
[9:44] John Andy's to come and take this before
[9:46] the Lord. Please pray for healing for
[9:48] sister Louise who has a bad cold and a
[9:51] cough.
[9:52] Also like to remind you to pray for
[9:55] brother Louise and his son brother
[9:57] Louise Jr. They left this morning for
[9:59] South America. You know it was just
[10:01] spent some time with him last night.
[10:02] Just such a wonderful testimony of how
[10:04] God's dealing in their life and God's
[10:06] dealing at the other end. So they're
[10:08] going to be gone for five weeks. So we
[10:10] don't want to pray for them just this
[10:11] morning. the next five weeks, who's
[10:13] going to remember brother Louise
[10:15] &gt;&gt; every day.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That God would lead him, that God
[10:19] would bless him, and make him make make
[10:20] him a blessing. Amen. Brother John.
[10:25] Amen. Let's join our hearts together.
[10:28] Heavenly Father, it's good to be in your
[10:30] house, Lord Jesus. Lord, a place that we
[10:33] can open up our hearts and our mouths
[10:35] and lift up our hands and shout
[10:38] hallelujah, Lord. Let the glories roll,
[10:41] Lord. We just come this morning into
[10:44] your presence, God. Just un knowing what
[10:48] you're going to do. Uh expecting the
[10:50] unexpected, Lord. But we want to confess
[10:53] that we are looking for you, Jesus.
[10:56] We're looking for you in the song
[10:57] service. We're looking before the
[11:00] service. We've come waiting, lingering.
[11:03] We've come praying, Lord. And even now
[11:05] throughout the congregation, we want to
[11:08] look away from any sin or any idol, any
[11:11] unbelief or any shackle of the enemy
[11:14] that he would be trying to put onto us.
[11:16] We're looking away from that and we're
[11:19] looking to your word, Father. Your word
[11:22] has the answer. Your word is our source
[11:24] of release. It's in your presence, God,
[11:28] that we can let off the pressure. You
[11:30] have made us as believers to look to you
[11:33] to look to this
[11:36] not to this place of made of wood and
[11:38] stone but to the place of your presence
[11:41] Lord where the shikina is where your
[11:44] glory is where your word is present ever
[11:47] near. And this morning we're looking
[11:49] away from our sickness. We're looking
[11:52] away from our pain or our suffering or
[11:55] what would come into our human minds.
[11:57] We're looking away from that. We're
[11:59] looking to the unseen. We're looking to
[12:02] our new bodies, Lord. We're looking to
[12:04] that eternal dimension where all things
[12:06] are possible. We're looking away from
[12:09] money and men and women and houses and
[12:12] lands. We're going beyond this earthly
[12:15] realm that we are so attached to. Lord,
[12:18] we cast it aside this morning, Jesus.
[12:21] What we can see, what we can feel, what
[12:24] we can taste. Lord, we're looking to
[12:26] that faith realm. We're looking to that
[12:28] soul ram, Lord. We've been trained as
[12:31] eagles to soar, Lord. Lord, we love
[12:34] eagle food, Lord. Where the carcass is,
[12:36] that's where the eagles are going to be
[12:38] gathered. We believe in the rapture
[12:40] season that we are in now that the dead
[12:43] in Christ shall rise. We which are alive
[12:46] and remain shall be joined with them.
[12:49] Our hearts are tuned in to that that
[12:51] channel this morning, that soul channel,
[12:54] Father. Lord, that food is coming down,
[12:57] Lord, to meet the need for the hour. And
[13:00] we're under breathtaking anticipation
[13:03] for what you're even going to do in this
[13:05] service, God. Miracles could happen,
[13:08] Lord. May the faith bank be so strong
[13:10] this morning. Let it be milky in this
[13:13] service, God. That even the minister
[13:15] wouldn't even be able to stand, Lord,
[13:17] and speak his own mind, but the mind of
[13:20] Christ would take so charge of our
[13:23] lives, Lord. That it would discern the
[13:25] very needs and hearts and situation that
[13:28] while we yet hear the word, Lord, our
[13:31] lives could be filled, sisters could be
[13:34] filled, brothers could be filled, needy
[13:36] hearts, unspoken requests. Hands are
[13:39] lifted up throughout the service. Those
[13:41] on the internet, Lord, on the phone,
[13:43] hook up Jesus. We're lifting our hand to
[13:46] you, Lord, the author and the finisher
[13:49] of our faith. Who for the joy that was
[13:51] set before you, you endured the cross.
[13:54] May we also as your bride with joy that
[13:58] is set before us, take up our cross and
[14:01] follow you today. We pray for Sister
[14:04] Louise, God. We pray that you would
[14:06] touch her, God, today. That you would
[14:08] minister to her life, minister to her
[14:11] need. And our precious brother Louise
[14:14] and his son, God, may your Holy Spirit
[14:16] be with them even as they travel today.
[14:19] May they feel a surge of your Holy
[14:22] Spirit that you are with them even in
[14:25] them all the way to the end. Father,
[14:27] you're wrapping up this Gentile
[14:30] dispensation and you're blending into
[14:32] that dispensation of the Jews. But may
[14:35] we as your people not lose heart or lose
[14:38] faith that you have not left us without
[14:40] a seed. But you are among us, God, even
[14:44] to that very hour of our taking away.
[14:46] You're our El Shadi. You're our healer.
[14:50] You're our deliverer. You're our only
[14:52] source of hope, God. Jesus, we have
[14:55] confidence in your word today that what
[14:58] you're going to speak is exactly what we
[15:00] need. And we cry, "Aba, Father. Our
[15:04] Father has adopted sons and daughters.
[15:07] We take you at your word. It's thus
[15:10] sayaith the Lord." And we're holding on
[15:12] to it, Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. Let's
[15:16] just worship him. Let's just worship him
[15:18] together. We receive your word, God.
[15:21] God, we receive this morning our need.
[15:24] Lord, we just put it before you, God.
[15:26] Believing that you have all that we have
[15:29] need of, God, we receive it today, God.
[15:32] We receive your Holy Spirit, God. We
[15:35] receive healing and deliverance, Lord.
[15:39] We receive the mind of Christ. We
[15:41] receive leadership and direction, the
[15:44] shepherd of the flock. Lord, we turn to
[15:47] you today, Lord. lead and guide us
[15:50] throughout this service, Lord. And we'll
[15:52] give you the glory and the honor and the
[15:54] praise, Lord. And we thank you, Jesus,
[15:57] for being ever present, Lord, being near
[16:00] to us as you promise you never forsake
[16:03] us. You'd be with us all the way to the
[16:06] end. Thank you, Jesus, for answering
[16:08] every prayer, God. Even before we see
[16:11] the results, we want to say thank you,
[16:13] God. Thank you for coming in this
[16:15] service, God. Thank you for coming,
[16:18] Lord. Thank you for ministering to us,
[16:21] God. Thank you that we can give back to
[16:23] you, God. And we can give to one another
[16:27] to be a hand extended, Lord. Anoint
[16:30] every life, fill every vessel, Lord. May
[16:34] Satan be defeated on every front.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; We look forward to your appearing,
[16:40] Jesus.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[16:56] me out of the miry clay.
[16:59] Amen. My soul was distressed neath
[17:01] Jehovah's dread frown. You know, some of
[17:04] you grew up in church
[17:06] and some of you grew up in message
[17:08] homes. I didn't. This song really me
[17:11] speaks to my heart. He brought me out of
[17:13] the deep deep
[17:15] deep my reclaim. Amen. He set my feet on
[17:19] a rock this day. Amen.
[17:24] My heart was distressing

[36:25] [Music]
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:33] Hallelujah.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in his
[36:36] presence?
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; So good to have you have you all here to
[36:46] worship.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be rushed.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; We just want to flow in what he has for
[36:56] us.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So good to see you, Brother
[37:00] Gary. Amen.
[37:03] Praise the Lord.
[37:07] Well, we
[37:10] we've just had a lot of thoughts in our
[37:12] our mind concerning this morning's
[37:14] service and are just praying that the
[37:17] Holy Spirit will
[37:19] place on each one of us a spirit of
[37:21] revelation.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; That we may see things that we've never
[37:27] seen before.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we may we may be impacted in a
[37:31] special way.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:38] I think of the scripture
[37:42] where Jesus said he said in Matthew 22
[37:45] he said what think ye of Christ?
[37:49] That was an interesting question.
[37:52] and uh he was speaking to very very
[37:55] learned men,
[37:58] leaders, teachers, ministers, whatever
[38:01] more. And three or four verses down, the
[38:05] Bible says, "And no man was able to
[38:08] answer him."
[38:11] I just I'm giving you a few thoughts
[38:14] before we have prayer and read the
[38:16] scripture.
[38:19] Today we're here
[38:21] and quite frankly
[38:24] I'm I'm very conscious that God
[38:27] Almighty, all knowing,
[38:31] knew of this service,
[38:35] knew precisely the time that we all
[38:37] would be here. He knew exactly who was
[38:41] going to be here.
[38:43] And I'm absolutely convinced
[38:46] there was just nothing by accident.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Now, people are gathered in all kinds of
[38:53] meetings and all kinds of churches and
[38:55] all kinds of places, all kinds of
[38:58] theories and all kinds of doctrines and
[39:00] all kinds of who knows what. And we're
[39:02] just not concerning ourselves with that
[39:05] right now. We're concerning ourselves
[39:07] with ourselves that we're here.
[39:11] And because God
[39:13] knew about this, I wonder what God's
[39:16] thought was
[39:19] &gt;&gt; for this meeting.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; And somehow I I I believe that he
[39:26] thought he would like to have a close
[39:30] fellowship with us.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:33] I think that in his thought it would be
[39:37] he'd really like to make himself known
[39:41] &gt;&gt; to us in a way that you have never known
[39:44] him before. Maybe just even a just a
[39:48] touch closer.
[39:49] Just something a little bit different
[39:51] about it. And maybe that's what was in
[39:55] his mind. So the service this morning is
[39:58] going to be going along these lines. And
[40:02] before we turn to the word where we'll
[40:05] be looking at John's gospel, the fourth
[40:07] chapter. Uh but we'll we'll have a a
[40:10] moment of prayer if you would please
[40:13] and then we'll read the scripture.
[40:16] Dear heavenly father,
[40:19] we've been so conscious
[40:22] from last night on into this morning
[40:26] as the song service has been
[40:30] uh conducted and our brother Kim leading
[40:32] the people in worship and the people so
[40:36] so openly worshiping you. Father, I pray
[40:41] that you will be pleased with it in such
[40:43] a way that you will come amongst us.
[40:48] I pray that you will speak so that the
[40:50] individual will hear you. I pray that we
[40:54] will be so attuned to the spiritual that
[40:57] we will want to uh be removed from the
[41:02] things of this life. And may we be so
[41:05] made ready, oh God, for your word. I
[41:09] pray, Father, that you will speak to us
[41:11] in a special way. And may this be a
[41:14] special day. I pray you'll bless us, oh
[41:17] God, as we are also thinking of the
[41:19] service this evening. And our brother
[41:21] Ernie Villanoeva who has not been before
[41:24] us for some time. And I pray, oh God,
[41:27] that the things which are been placed on
[41:29] his heart and and those things that he
[41:32] will tell us of of Philippines and where
[41:35] else, Lord, I pray that you'll use him.
[41:38] Bless this congregation of people in the
[41:41] name of Jesus Christ with supernatural
[41:44] blessings. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[41:52] I'm going to ask uh brother Tom if
[41:54] you'll read for me. We're going to turn
[41:57] to John's Gospel, the fourth chapter.
[42:00] Thank you, musicians.
[42:08] This is quite a lengthy reading. I'm I
[42:10] hope you won't mind. We're going to
[42:13] start reading
[42:15] from the
[42:18] fifth verse.
[42:21] and down through and including the 29th
[42:25] verse.
[42:28] It's a it's a very very familiar story,
[42:31] very familiar account. But now, while we
[42:34] read this, here's what I want you to be
[42:38] uh thinking of.
[42:42] When Jesus began to speak to this woman
[42:45] at the well,
[42:48] she had conducted her life with her own
[42:50] thinking.
[42:53] Obviously, like anyone, I'm sure that
[42:56] she did the best that she could. I
[42:59] believe she wanted happiness. I believe
[43:02] she wanted fulfillment of life. I
[43:05] believe that anything that a woman of
[43:08] Samaria may have desired, she desired
[43:10] it. And so her life was conducted with
[43:13] her own thoughts by her own thoughts.
[43:17] So Jesus had to in this process, he had
[43:22] to move her from her thoughts and
[43:26] actually bring her into the very thought
[43:28] of God. Right.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; And it's a very interesting as you as
[43:33] you listen and read it with that in
[43:36] mind. She lived her life by her own
[43:39] thoughts and now she had an in an
[43:42] interruption as it were in her normal
[43:45] life. And here's one that starts to
[43:48] speak to her about things that are not
[43:50] strange or unusual. But he moves he
[43:54] moves her and she she becomes transient
[43:59] from the natural until Jesus brings her
[44:03] into the very mind of God. Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; And when that happened
[44:10] because I want to speak on conditions
[44:12] for change part two
[44:15] &gt;&gt; and that this woman was changed.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Dramatically, wonderfully, gloriously
[44:24] changed.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother John Tom, if you
[44:28] will just read please for us
[44:32] uh from verse 5 to 29.
[44:39] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria
[44:41] which is called Saikar near to the
[44:44] parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his
[44:47] son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there,
[44:50] and Jesus therefore being wearied with
[44:52] his journey, sat thus on the well, and
[44:55] it was about the sixth hour. There
[44:57] cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.
[45:01] And Jesus said unto her, "Give me to
[45:03] drink, for his disciples were gone away
[45:06] unto the city to buy meat." Then saith
[45:09] the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it
[45:12] that thou being a Jew askest, drink of
[45:15] me, which I'm a woman of Samaria, for
[45:18] the Jews have no dealings with the
[45:20] Samaritans? And Jesus answered and said
[45:23] unto her, If thou kneest the gift of
[45:26] God, and who it is that saith thee, Give
[45:29] me the drink, thou would have asked of
[45:32] him, and he would have given thee living
[45:34] water. The woman said unto him, "Sir,
[45:37] thou has nothing to draw with,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; and the well is deep. From whence then
[45:42] hast thou living water? Art thou greater
[45:45] than our father Jacob, which gave us the
[45:48] well, and drank thereof of himself, and
[45:50] his children, and his cattle?" And Jesus
[45:53] answered and said unto her, "Whosoever
[45:56] drinkketh of this water shall thirst
[45:58] again, but whosoever drinkketh of the
[46:01] water that I shall give him shall never
[46:04] thirst. But the water that I shall give
[46:06] him shall be in him a well of water
[46:10] springing up into everlasting life."
[46:14] &gt;&gt; The woman said unto him, "Sir, give me
[46:16] this water, that I thirst not, neither
[46:18] come hither to draw." And Jesus said
[46:21] unto her, "Go call thy husband, and come
[46:24] hither." The woman answered and said, "I
[46:26] have no husband." Jesus said unto her,
[46:28] "Thou hast well said, I have no
[46:30] husband." For thou hast had five
[46:33] husbands, and he whom thou hast is not
[46:35] thy husband, in that thou, and thou
[46:38] sayest thou truly. The woman said unto
[46:41] him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
[46:43] prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this
[46:46] mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem
[46:48] is the place where men ought to worship.
[46:51] And Jesus said unto her,"Woman, believe
[46:53] me, the hour cometh when you shall
[46:56] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[46:58] Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship
[47:02] ye not know not what we know what we
[47:05] worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
[47:08] But the hour cometh, and now is, when
[47:11] the true worshipper shall worship the
[47:13] Father in spirit and in truth. For the
[47:16] Father seeketh such to worship him. God
[47:19] is a spirit, and they that worship him
[47:22] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; And the woman said unto him, I know that
[47:28] the Messiah cometh, which is called
[47:30] Christ, when he has come, he shall tell
[47:33] us all things. Jesus said unto her, I
[47:37] that speak unto thee am he.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And upon this came his disciples, and
[47:43] marveled that he talked with the woman.
[47:46] Yet no man said, Why, what seekest thou?
[47:49] Or why talkst thou with her? The woman
[47:51] then left her water pot, went her way
[47:53] into the city, and saith to the man,
[47:56] Come see a man which told me all things
[47:59] that ever I did. Is this
[48:02] is not this the Christ?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; It's almost enough to have had a service
[48:11] already. God bless you as you have your
[48:13] seats.
[48:21] You know, sometimes coming before a
[48:23] congregation, incidentally, I want to
[48:24] say to everyone that's gathered here, I
[48:27] don't want you to ever think of coming
[48:30] here to church as simply, you know,
[48:32] we're gather
[48:34] uh as individuals having fellowship.
[48:37] That's wonderful. But I want you to feel
[48:40] much closer. I want you to feel that you
[48:42] are an integral part of a body. I want
[48:45] you feel a certain level of commitment.
[48:48] Say this is my life. These are my
[48:51] people. This is where I fellowship. This
[48:54] is where I worship. This is where I
[48:57] receive spiritual food. That's way we
[48:59] want to feel that way.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to take this scripture
[49:05] uh because
[49:08] and if you'll forgive me, I just I want
[49:10] to express some very very personal
[49:14] uh thoughts uh for a moment. Uh I I feel
[49:19] this way about believers. I feel that uh
[49:23] there are most wonderful group of people
[49:27] uh in the world. I feel that they have
[49:31] such a unique belief and faith and
[49:34] message because no one else
[49:38] has followed and heard a vindicated
[49:41] prophet like they have
[49:43] &gt;&gt; like you have and because I feel that
[49:46] way I feel that the people are very
[49:49] special.
[49:51] That's not enough to say oh you're
[49:53] special you're special because now I
[49:55] want to take the other side. I feel that
[49:57] there's very much lacking
[50:00] uh and if we individually each of us
[50:03] individually
[50:05] if we and I've said this before but I
[50:08] want to uh be more clearly uh have it
[50:12] more clearly defined. If each of us now
[50:16] said uh I said put down on a list and
[50:21] think real deep for a few moments.
[50:24] What is your deepest and most important
[50:28] thing in life? What is the most
[50:31] important thing if you could change
[50:33] something or you would like to change or
[50:36] you would like to receive? Uh where
[50:39] would you like to go? What would you
[50:40] like to be? What would you what would
[50:43] you like to attain to in God? Uh at what
[50:47] spiritual level? What is it that you
[50:49] really want from him? I am absolutely
[50:53] convinced that the things which you
[50:56] would begin to list even if you put them
[50:59] and prioritize them they would start
[51:02] with spiritual thing. your spiritual
[51:05] life, something to do with your walk
[51:08] with God would be right at the top of
[51:11] the list. And I'm sure that that's in
[51:13] God's mind. And so, because we desire
[51:17] that,
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and because we've not quite attained to
[51:20] it, that's what I'm referring to. And I
[51:24] believe that we come here to the house
[51:26] of God to hear things that might even
[51:28] sound a little strange or a little
[51:31] difficult for us to grasp. But if we
[51:33] will only think on those things.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I think of the great inventions that
[51:40] happened and the great things that have
[51:43] taken place in the world in the natural
[51:45] world. You know, you know why we have
[51:48] what we have? Somebody sat down one day
[51:50] and thought about it. Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; We're flying in airplanes because, you
[51:56] know, the Wright brothers and a whole
[51:58] lot of other brothers thought about it
[52:01] &gt;&gt; and they looked at the bugs and they
[52:03] looked at the flies and they looked at
[52:06] the birds and they said, "We ought to be
[52:08] able to do that." And they thought about
[52:10] it. And by going through that thought
[52:13] process and they wouldn't stop until
[52:16] that thought process brought tremendous
[52:20] changes
[52:21] &gt;&gt; to society to the world simply because
[52:25] somebody got thinking about it.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Now there are some people that get
[52:30] something in their mind and they think
[52:32] about it and they think about it and
[52:33] they think about it and brother Brandham
[52:35] talked to them and said if you continue
[52:37] with that you'll go insane.
[52:41] So that was going to take them in
[52:42] completely a different direction.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't constructive. It wasn't
[52:47] beneficial. It wasn't they were just
[52:50] going to go insane if they harbored that
[52:53] and thought about it. And so our our
[52:56] power of thinking
[52:59] is incredibly
[53:01] important and and and and has effects
[53:04] upon us far beyond our understanding. I
[53:07] believe that. And that's kind of where
[53:10] I'm going to be going uh this morning.
[53:18] I spoke uh on conditions for change and
[53:21] that's what I'm going to speak about
[53:24] right now.
[53:26] Uh what what does change mean
[53:30] and how does it come about?
[53:33] Uh I understand that
[53:36] just from some of the meaning
[53:40] to change is to become different or to
[53:42] make something different or to make
[53:45] somebody different to exchange to
[53:48] substitute or replace something to make
[53:51] something pass from one state to
[53:53] another. As brother Brandham in the
[53:55] future home, which I'm in a great deal
[53:57] in the future home this morning, he said
[54:00] that the world will pass away and the
[54:02] heavens will pass away with a great
[54:05] noise. So he said, well, they're not
[54:07] actually annihilated. Nothing happens to
[54:09] the frame. He said he simply that he
[54:13] Satan is removed from it.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; The same as he took the devil away from
[54:18] you. He takes Satanise
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Satan's effect off of the earth
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and it passes away, but it passes into
[54:27] another into another realm. It passes
[54:31] not into another place in the universe,
[54:32] but it just passes into a a a new and
[54:36] that's why the Bible says he'll make a
[54:38] new heaven and a new earth.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Uh I want to bring one aspect here. I'm
[54:44] laying I'm just going to be ponderous
[54:46] for a few moments to get get certain
[54:48] principled foundation thoughts down.
[54:52] During the last uh US election, it was
[54:57] President Obama which actually was
[55:00] swept, I would say, on a on a frenzy of
[55:04] euphoria
[55:05] because it was change. You know, we want
[55:09] change. And so a whole nation of over
[55:13] 300 million people, not all of them
[55:15] voted for him, but it was a sweep of the
[55:19] people. Now, what I want to bring to you
[55:21] is that you can speak a certain word.
[55:26] Change. Even here in the congregation
[55:29] this morning, I could say change. We
[55:31] want change. But it would have a whole
[55:34] myriad of meetings. Whole myriad.
[55:36] Because what what perhaps this brother
[55:38] wants is not exactly what this brother
[55:40] wants. What this sister expects isn't
[55:42] what that sister expects. We all have
[55:45] different expectations. So we could say,
[55:48] "Yeah, yeah, change." And millions,
[55:51] yeah, we all want change and we're all
[55:54] swept away on it and but but what this
[55:57] guy wants and what this person wants and
[56:00] what that what that state expects and
[56:02] this state expects are completely
[56:04] different. And so then as time goes on,
[56:08] and politicians know this so well,
[56:10] they're so fine-tuned to it, you know,
[56:12] they know right well it's not going to
[56:14] happen.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; They'll try to do, you know, what what
[56:19] they can do, but there's a whole lot in
[56:22] in and much of what was put forward was
[56:25] we're going to bring our boys back from
[56:27] Iraq. Wonderful. Well, oh, there's
[56:31] hundreds of thousands that are in favor
[56:33] of that. we're going to uh you know
[56:36] bring dignity and uh seek to bring
[56:39] equality to the working man and the
[56:42] bluecollar worker. And so the unions got
[56:45] on the bandwagon. Yeah, change. We want
[56:48] this kind of change. And then uh part of
[56:52] the platform was uh Medicare and we got
[56:55] ahead Medicare for everybody and there's
[56:57] millions that are sick and they said,
[56:59] "Yay, that's the kind of change we
[57:01] want."
[57:02] Well, then as time went on, when the
[57:05] boys didn't come home, there was a bunch
[57:07] of disillusioned people, didn't change
[57:09] the way they wanted. And when maybe
[57:12] everybody didn't get their uh medical
[57:15] needs met, they weren't satisfied. And
[57:18] so now a whole bunch of people start to
[57:20] be disenchanted
[57:22] and disillusioned because the word
[57:26] means so many different things. So now
[57:29] we talk spiritually. We can say the
[57:31] coming of the Lord. Oh, the coming of
[57:33] the Lord. And the whole Christian
[57:35] community says, "Yay, we're all here for
[57:37] the coming of the Lord." One expects
[57:40] them on a cloud coming down. Another one
[57:42] says, "He's already here." And another
[57:44] one's got that they got them all over
[57:46] the place.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean? So the
[57:49] phrase the coming of the Lord, it just
[57:51] depends what it means to you or what it
[57:53] means to this person or the next person.
[57:55] And so it's it's not just the thought
[57:59] because we can make a phrase, we can
[58:01] make a statement and then we we we've
[58:04] got it all figured out what it is.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so many places I could go
[58:12] here. You just have to help me a little
[58:14] bit now. So somebody can say, uh, a
[58:17] pastor.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. I need a pastor. And
[58:22] then everybody has a different reason
[58:24] for needing a pastor. Some think, "Oh,
[58:26] I've got to sit in church and hear the
[58:28] word of God." And next one says, "He's
[58:30] going to fix my problems. He's going to
[58:31] help me raise my kids. Going to tell me
[58:33] what to do. Going to tell me if I should
[58:35] buy a car or not." Some so I've had
[58:38] people and they told me they said their
[58:40] pastor, "I couldn't even go on vacation
[58:42] till I would discuss it with the pastor
[58:44] if I could go on a vacation at a certain
[58:46] time or I felt I should buy a car." And
[58:48] they would go and discuss it with the
[58:49] pastor. Well, I'll tell you folks, if
[58:51] you intend to buy a car, don't come and
[58:53] talk to me.
[58:55] If you want to take a vacation, don't
[58:57] talk to me. Uh, you know, where the
[58:59] pastors called for certain things, but
[59:01] it depends what people have in their
[59:03] mind from the phrase,
[59:05] &gt;&gt; you know, we want change or or we we
[59:08] want a certain government or or whatever
[59:10] more. are so many things that uh that
[59:13] the people and so it's it is not only
[59:15] the word but it's what the word means to
[59:18] the individual people and I would say
[59:21] that today so many are in their
[59:25] expectation of their own brand
[59:28] uh of of of what they expect to happen
[59:34] now
[59:38] so when the results
[59:40] when the results are different from the
[59:43] expectation
[59:46] uh right away then a person's thoughts
[59:49] change because uh at one time they say
[59:54] I'm in favor of this person I'm in favor
[59:56] of this leader I'm in favor of this
[59:58] political party and then or I'm in favor
[1:00:01] of this church or I'm in favor of this
[1:00:03] doctrine because it seems to suit what I
[1:00:06] think it should it should today uh
[1:00:09] whether even when it comes to spiritual
[1:00:11] things and so I will say that untold
[1:00:15] multitudes have spiritual expectations
[1:00:21] that simply will not happen. Right.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking I've been think I I
[1:00:28] have given quite a bit of thought
[1:00:29] recently
[1:00:31] because I think of
[1:00:34] all the people every once in a while I
[1:00:36] look at the orbituary page and I see all
[1:00:39] the pictures of the people on there.
[1:00:42] We don't get a newspaper. Once in a
[1:00:44] while I get it on the weekend paper.
[1:00:45] They always have the orbituary.
[1:00:48] In this country, we never used to have
[1:00:49] pictures, but what have been over in
[1:00:51] other foreign countries. I always saw
[1:00:53] they had big pictures and big elaborate
[1:00:55] pictures of the people that died and the
[1:00:57] story of their life. And I I found the
[1:01:00] pictures very interesting. Now you see
[1:01:02] the pictures and they have it here in
[1:01:04] the Vancouver Sun. So you see all kinds
[1:01:05] of pictures of the people. I know
[1:01:10] I know
[1:01:12] that the one who stood in front of their
[1:01:15] families and the mourers and the loved
[1:01:18] ones said nice things about those
[1:01:21] people. I've conduct a lot of funerals
[1:01:24] and I know that they will strive to put
[1:01:26] the person in heaven or put them in a
[1:01:29] nice place. And I think what a serious
[1:01:34] position for a minister to stand up and
[1:01:37] have to lie
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; to the people. It's true
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; because for the most part, for the most
[1:01:45] part, and I'm not anybody's judge,
[1:01:48] but according to the scripture,
[1:01:52] few there are that are saved.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, now he stressed
[1:01:58] that. And I was listening to him the
[1:02:01] other day and uh he said, "A man came to
[1:02:03] me and said, "Brother Brandon, you
[1:02:04] really shook me because you said there's
[1:02:06] so few that'll be saved." Amen. And he
[1:02:10] said, "Well, that's right." He said,
[1:02:12] "Now, in the ark, there were eight."
[1:02:15] And but he says, "But that was a type of
[1:02:18] the church with with with Enoch there
[1:02:21] was one." Now, we're we're not, you
[1:02:25] know, speaking about numbers per se, but
[1:02:27] nevertheless, that is a that's a very
[1:02:30] significant truth. So, it's not just
[1:02:33] we're not just here to be a a glob of
[1:02:36] people. We're not here just to have a
[1:02:39] good time and we're not here just to
[1:02:41] shake hands with one another. We're here
[1:02:43] to hear truth
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; regardless of what it shake how it
[1:02:48] shakes us
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; or how it strips us.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Friends, I will sooner hear truth
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; and know that my soul is saved
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and know that I'm being brought into
[1:03:01] shape and into condition.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I want to hear what God has to say about
[1:03:06] us.
[1:03:07] That's what I'm concerned about.
[1:03:11] When Jesus started to speak to this
[1:03:13] woman, he wasn't, you know, becoming uh,
[1:03:16] shall I say, emotional and saying you've
[1:03:19] had a hard time and you've had a hard
[1:03:22] life and I know that you'd like to be
[1:03:24] you want to be happy and have joy and
[1:03:28] you've had so many reversals in life and
[1:03:30] and which would have been the way that
[1:03:32] so many of the religious people and even
[1:03:35] within the message would approach it and
[1:03:38] you know get sympathetic with
[1:03:40] Jesus wasn't that way. He just told her
[1:03:42] plainly. And when she recognized he was
[1:03:45] a prophet, and this is how she
[1:03:47] recognized when he said, "You spoken
[1:03:50] right. You haven't a husband. You've had
[1:03:53] five. And the one you have right now is
[1:03:55] not your husband." In other words,
[1:03:57] you're a prostitute.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; You're living in sin.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; He He knew what the word of God could
[1:04:04] say about it. He He said, and he just
[1:04:06] told her the truth. That was the only
[1:04:08] way to get her to his objective.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; That was the only way to get her was to
[1:04:13] deal with the truth
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; concerning it.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Brandham speaks about
[1:04:20] straight as the gate. He says there's
[1:04:22] sure going to be some great
[1:04:23] disappointments at the judgment. Oh, he
[1:04:27] said the bootleggger, he knows where
[1:04:29] he's going to be at at the judgment. So
[1:04:32] does the beer hound knows where he's
[1:04:34] going to be. So does the prostitute know
[1:04:37] where she'll stand. So does the gambler
[1:04:39] know where he'll stand. So does the
[1:04:41] drunkard know where he'll stand. He'll
[1:04:44] not be disappointed. But where the
[1:04:46] disappointment is going to be is those
[1:04:49] who at the judgment where they thought
[1:04:52] they were right.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; You know, so it's not enough for us just
[1:04:56] to think that we're right. You want to
[1:04:59] know in your heart of hearts,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I am believing this word with all. It's
[1:05:05] not a matter of doing a lot of things.
[1:05:08] It's a matter of how you believe. What's
[1:05:10] in your mind?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; So he said that's where the
[1:05:20] disappointment
[1:05:23] now
[1:05:25] in God is his own interpreter. You'll
[1:05:27] just have to follow very very close and
[1:05:29] say, "Oh God,
[1:05:31] give me capacity for thought just now."
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; God is his own interpreter.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now
[1:05:40] all we are today is the display
[1:05:45] of the attributes
[1:05:47] in God.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; All of us, all we are, we're a display
[1:05:52] of his attributes."
[1:05:55] First, he was not even God.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll put it here. I have it for
[1:06:04] you. So, why don't we do it that way?
[1:06:11] And here's the quote.
[1:06:14] Now, all we are
[1:06:17] today is the display of his attributes
[1:06:19] in God. First, he was not even God.
[1:06:24] We just have to call him the eternal
[1:06:26] one. Now friends, this is where we have
[1:06:28] to start. This isn't uh this is like a a
[1:06:32] a lesson. But a prophet of God is
[1:06:35] teaching us these things.
[1:06:39] He said because the English word God
[1:06:41] means object of worship
[1:06:44] and there was nothing to worship him. So
[1:06:47] he was the eternal one,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; the main fountain of all intelligence.
[1:06:53] Yes sir.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And in this fountain of all
[1:06:58] intelligence, there was not an atom,
[1:07:01] molecule or nothing, light, nowhere,
[1:07:05] star, moon, nothing else. God, what we
[1:07:09] know as God, the great spirit that was
[1:07:12] eternal, never did begin, never did end,
[1:07:15] he was there. And in him was attributes.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; It was attributes to be God.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; See, he wasn't a God yet. There was
[1:07:26] nothing to worship, but he had an
[1:07:27] attribute to be God.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Attributes to be a father, attributes to
[1:07:34] be a son, attributes to be a savior,
[1:07:38] attributes to be a healer.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; All these attributes was in him. These
[1:07:44] things that was unfolded, these things
[1:07:47] that has unfolded since then are just
[1:07:50] his attributes being made manifest.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; So it's a God this great fountain.
[1:07:57] You know, I have so much difficulty
[1:08:00] thinking of of a being that never began.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; I have problem with that. And a being
[1:08:06] that never ends.
[1:08:09] Eternal eternity really uh uh gives me
[1:08:14] difficulty mentally is I always feel
[1:08:17] something has to start someplace but God
[1:08:19] never had a beginning.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; So I just have to declare what he says
[1:08:23] about it.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; This great fountain and he had an
[1:08:27] attribute in him to be worshiped. He had
[1:08:29] an attribute to be God.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, an attribute to be a son and
[1:08:35] to be all of these things.
[1:08:49] Now,
[1:08:52] in uh
[1:08:54] in the future home, Brother Brandham,
[1:08:57] I'm I'm going to just take you on a
[1:08:58] little bit of a journey. He said, "I
[1:09:02] can't say post
[1:09:05] lest I think post."
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; I can't say man
[1:09:12] lest I think man. And when I think of
[1:09:15] man, then I say man. He said the
[1:09:19] thinking and here we go. The thinking
[1:09:24] is my attribute. Now I'm not talking
[1:09:25] about God's attribute. I talking about
[1:09:28] his your attribute. The thinking is my
[1:09:32] attribute
[1:09:34] and the expression is the word.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; So he says I think I can't say post
[1:09:41] unless I think post. So he thinks post
[1:09:46] or I think man. So I think of man and
[1:09:52] then he expresses it and says man
[1:09:57] or we think I may think I think
[1:10:03] vile brother vile.
[1:10:06] Now I speak it and I I express what I
[1:10:10] thought but the thought was the
[1:10:12] attribute. Now I could think it and not
[1:10:15] say it.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; So but the thought your thought is the
[1:10:21] attribute.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; It's powerful.
[1:10:31] So the attribute or thought is God's and
[1:10:36] the expression or word is through the
[1:10:38] prophet.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] Now many of you wonder
[1:10:46] how that discernment comes and I'm going
[1:10:49] to tell you.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] Now,
[1:10:54] just hear me real good for a moment.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; The discernment,
[1:11:00] we call it the discernment or the
[1:11:03] revealing of the secret of the heart.
[1:11:06] When Jesus was at the well with the
[1:11:08] woman, that is the one thing, the only
[1:11:12] thing he did was revealed the secret of
[1:11:15] her heart.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] There was nothing supernatural about the
[1:11:20] water or the well or the bucket or the
[1:11:22] rope.
[1:11:23] Are you greater than Jacob who gave us
[1:11:26] this well? None of none of that would be
[1:11:29] moving her into another dimension. None
[1:11:32] of that would bring change
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; to her. She came a prostitute. She was
[1:11:37] going to go a prostitute. She came
[1:11:39] living with a man who wasn't her
[1:11:41] husband. And she would go living with a
[1:11:43] man who wasn't her husband. None of that
[1:11:45] would change. We have become very very
[1:11:48] spoiled in that we've heard messages and
[1:11:52] heard prayer lines etc etc for for
[1:11:55] decades and for years and years and
[1:11:58] years and it it it begins to come a very
[1:12:01] very common place but I want to just say
[1:12:03] to the congregation once again today
[1:12:06] that was God Almighty
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; coming on the scene
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; to separate
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham's ministry from all
[1:12:15] other ministries.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; To separate it and to identify it as to
[1:12:21] be the mouthpiece that was going to
[1:12:24] speak the mystery secrets of the word of
[1:12:27] God.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; The the God was identifying a mouthpiece
[1:12:32] that this this mouthpiece is going to
[1:12:35] speak my thoughts.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Thoughts that I've held back. Thoughts
[1:12:41] that I have concerning the end time.
[1:12:44] thoughts I have concerning specifically,
[1:12:47] especially those people that are going
[1:12:50] to be drawn to the voice from this
[1:12:53] messenger.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; I have special things to say to them.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to attract them. Multitudes of
[1:13:01] others have been attracted, but there's
[1:13:03] going to be some that will be attracted
[1:13:05] differently, and they won't understand
[1:13:07] the attraction. But I want to bring them
[1:13:10] into the channel of my thought. And I'll
[1:13:13] have a vessel here that will speak my
[1:13:15] thought.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And that thought will change those
[1:13:22] people.
[1:13:23] That thought will even change their
[1:13:25] bodies because my thought has control
[1:13:29] over the atoms of their system. My
[1:13:32] thought has control over the cancer that
[1:13:34] Satan has tried to impose upon them. My
[1:13:38] thought is more powerful than the demons
[1:13:40] of hell that are trying to hold them and
[1:13:43] bind them. My thought when they come in
[1:13:46] contact, they won't understand it, but
[1:13:48] they will be free. They will be changed.
[1:13:54] Is it not true?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I said now, brother Brandham comes to
[1:14:05] this. He said, "You've wondered."
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Many of you wonder how that discernment
[1:14:12] comes. And I'm going to tell you,
[1:14:16] it's a word
[1:14:18] that I say
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; and it isn't my thinking.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; I've been pondering this one very, very
[1:14:25] deep.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; It's a word that I say
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't come through his mind.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I even wondered. I said, "Lord, how does
[1:14:33] he say a word?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; How do I speak a word without my
[1:14:37] thinking?"
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And I got thinking back. I got re into
[1:14:42] my memory and thinking back, I I've
[1:14:45] prayed with people. I've prayed myself.
[1:14:48] And then something just overwhelms you.
[1:14:51] And you say, "Oh, God, help me. I'm a
[1:14:53] sinner."
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; But you never even thought about it.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; You didn't sit and think, "I'm a sinner.
[1:14:58] I think I'll say I'm a sinner." Like
[1:15:00] brother Brandham says, "I can't say a
[1:15:02] post unless I think I'm a post or I
[1:15:04] think of a post." I said, "I just I have
[1:15:07] to think of it first." But when a person
[1:15:09] comes under the very uh under the
[1:15:12] dominion of the Holy Ghost, they'll
[1:15:14] start saying things that they're not
[1:15:16] thinking about.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even come to your mind.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the natural, in the
[1:15:23] natural, your own mind might be saying,
[1:15:25] "You're a failure. You're a miserable,
[1:15:28] hopeless wretch." But there's something
[1:15:30] in you that says, "I'm this blood,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; son and daughter of God."
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's how people when
[1:15:38] they are even on a on a deathbed.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; If a if the revelation of the truth of
[1:15:45] God's word, they can't they they think
[1:15:47] I'm sick. I'm weak. I'm frail. But
[1:15:51] something and it's not even a thought.
[1:15:53] But out of their mouth, they say a word.
[1:15:55] I'm healed.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I receive it.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; The promise is true.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And the devil is a liar. Yes.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Listen friends,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; it works.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And so he said, "It's not my thought.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; It's a word that I say."
[1:16:21] And brother Brandham had to say so many
[1:16:23] words that never came into his mind as a
[1:16:26] thought.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And even when he come out, he said, "I
[1:16:30] don't know what I said."
[1:16:32] because his memory channel didn't have
[1:16:35] like when you speak something then in a
[1:16:37] moment or two later your memory channel
[1:16:39] has access to that because it's in the
[1:16:42] past but he would speak things but even
[1:16:45] the memory channel which is in the in
[1:16:47] the in the realm of the spirit had no
[1:16:50] access
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; back to that
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; think of it isn't that marvelous
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; and he said he said to me personally he
[1:16:57] said it's like a record and unless un
[1:17:00] it's like it has to play again and
[1:17:03] unless God will play it again, he said,
[1:17:06] then I can't remember it. I can't recall
[1:17:08] it. He hasn't got any recall facility
[1:17:11] for this kind of thing because it's
[1:17:13] God's attribute.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have automatic
[1:17:19] access into God's mind just to draw a
[1:17:22] thought when we want to. But when God
[1:17:24] makes his thoughts known to us, my
[1:17:27] brother, my sister, we want to jump on
[1:17:29] the bandwagon. say, "I'm here to catch
[1:17:32] all that God has to say."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; So, so he said, "Because it it isn't my
[1:17:42] thinking because I don't know. I don't
[1:17:46] know of the thinking of it. How can I
[1:17:49] tell you
[1:17:52] where you were and and came from when I
[1:17:56] don't know you? How can I tell you what
[1:18:00] you done 10 years ago
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; when I never seen you in my life?
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; How can I tell you where you where you
[1:18:08] do and what you will do 10 years from
[1:18:10] now? How do I know the future?
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; But it is somebody else's thought.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; So it never even comes in his mind. It's
[1:18:19] not as though God illuminates his mind
[1:18:22] and he begins to it is a word that he
[1:18:24] speaks
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; and the thought is someone else's
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and he's he's com making a comparison
[1:18:31] now we think of a certain thing we we
[1:18:34] think of my car I'm going to go to my
[1:18:36] car and we speak a certain thing I'm
[1:18:39] going to after church I'm going to
[1:18:40] because we've got those thoughts and and
[1:18:43] the thought is our attribute you may not
[1:18:45] speak it you don't necessarily utter it
[1:18:48] but you have thoughts and their
[1:18:50] attributes. The world is full of men and
[1:18:53] women's thoughts,
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; but they're not God's thoughts.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; They are their personal attributes.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And they might they might think about
[1:19:04] something and decide, I'm going to
[1:19:06] change. I'm going to do this. I'm going
[1:19:08] to do that. And it may be perfectly
[1:19:10] fine. It may be great. It's a good thing
[1:19:12] for them to do. I'm going to take this
[1:19:14] job. I'm going to take this schooling.
[1:19:16] I'm going to I'm going to go to this
[1:19:19] city or whatever more. We can have those
[1:19:22] thoughts and it's not necessarily God's
[1:19:25] thoughts. In fact, it's for the most
[1:19:26] part, it's just human thoughts. Like
[1:19:29] brother Brandham says now, I take every
[1:19:32] spirit in this building under my control
[1:19:36] for the glory of God.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; He brought those spirits under his
[1:19:40] control. Hallelujah. Those people didn't
[1:19:43] even realize it. But God came down and
[1:19:46] took those spirits under his control for
[1:19:48] the glory of God. So that then the Holy
[1:19:51] Spirit could come and command the
[1:19:54] attention of the people. And that
[1:19:56] discernment which we call discernment
[1:19:57] which was not discernment per se. He
[1:20:00] said it is Hebrews where 4:12 where the
[1:20:04] word of God the word of God. Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; And what is the word of God? The word of
[1:20:10] God is the attribute being made known.
[1:20:14] For the word of God now, the word the
[1:20:18] word the thought was already God already
[1:20:20] had the thought, but now he's got a
[1:20:22] vessel on earth through whom he is
[1:20:24] projecting his word. And the word of God
[1:20:27] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:20:30] any two-edged sword, piercing even to
[1:20:33] the dividing aunderder of soul and
[1:20:36] spirit. Now it's the only thing that can
[1:20:38] divide us under as I said many times not
[1:20:41] between body and spirit but between soul
[1:20:44] and spirit. That is why so many people
[1:20:47] so many people so much of religion is
[1:20:50] all caught up with the emotional side of
[1:20:53] things we feel and you know and that is
[1:20:55] where our affection and our family
[1:20:58] relationships and all of these things.
[1:21:00] And let me say this to this
[1:21:02] congregation. We do not want to come
[1:21:04] here and fellowship based on that realm.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want you here because I'm here
[1:21:12] or because your wife or somebody else is
[1:21:14] here. You've got to know in your heart
[1:21:17] of hearts what is the mind of God
[1:21:20] concerning you and where you're going to
[1:21:21] hear the word of God for your life.
[1:21:24] Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And this is not speaking uh uh
[1:21:28] negatively about anyone else or any
[1:21:30] other people that worship elsewhere.
[1:21:33] People within the message. They they
[1:21:35] have all all manner and different
[1:21:38] reasons for gathering and where they
[1:21:41] gather and how they gather and their
[1:21:43] times of their services and it's a whole
[1:21:46] myriad. Everybody must have their own
[1:21:48] diet. But you must know what your diet
[1:21:51] is.
[1:21:52] definitely must know what your diet is.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And so it's someone else's thought.
[1:22:10] Now I sincerely believe
[1:22:14] that we really have no concept of the
[1:22:18] power
[1:22:20] of the attribute the thought that God
[1:22:22] has given us.
[1:22:24] And that is why the prophet also said
[1:22:27] that the mind is the battle ground.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; And in this day and age,
[1:22:35] don't lose me there. I just felt like it
[1:22:38] was a dark cloud for a moment. The mind
[1:22:43] is the battleground
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; and you should make a daily practice of
[1:22:49] kicking your enemy out of that
[1:22:51] battleground.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; He's not there for good.
[1:22:58] He's there to bring all kinds of worry
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; and toil and turmoil and confusion and
[1:23:06] all kinds of things.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; We need to kick him out and say, "Well,
[1:23:10] what would you recommend?" I'd recommend
[1:23:11] saying, "Father,
[1:23:13] I know you have an attribute, a thought
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; concerning this day that I'm living in.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; You have a thought, and I want to know
[1:23:26] what that thought is. Even if it doesn't
[1:23:28] come into my mind, help me to speak it.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Help me to say it.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Help me to live it.
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Whatever he has said about us is exactly
[1:23:45] what we must say.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now,
[1:23:49] so the prophet is saying now the
[1:23:52] thinking is my attribute
[1:23:55] and the expression is the word.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; So I think a post, I say a post. I think
[1:24:00] a man, I say a man. Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Now I want to take it a little bit
[1:24:07] further with this woman at the well.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] This is still in a quote. Let this mind
[1:24:21] be in you which was also in Christ.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Let it be in you. Let the mind that was
[1:24:26] in Christ be in you. See then it isn't
[1:24:29] your thinking.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And you're not expressing your own
[1:24:35] words. You're expressing his words.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; The supernatural
[1:24:43] is God's confirmation or agreement
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; that the attribute thought and the word
[1:24:50] confession is one of the same and the
[1:24:52] same.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Can we say that again? The supernatural
[1:24:56] is God's confirmation or agreement that
[1:25:00] the attribute thought and the word
[1:25:04] confession is one and the same. That's
[1:25:07] when you have something happen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; When a person, when we as a group of
[1:25:12] people or an individual can move into
[1:25:14] that channel,
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; catch the mind of God.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; You might say, "How do we move into that
[1:25:21] channel?" I I've been speaking a couple
[1:25:23] messages now.
[1:25:26] The messenger is the channel.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have a history channel and a
[1:25:33] sports channel and all this. We have a
[1:25:36] prophet channel.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; That was God's channel.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; God proved who that channel was.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; So, we have the channel.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Because the woman at the well was an
[1:25:55] attribute.
[1:25:57] Jesus the word spoke what the seed what
[1:26:01] the seed in her heart declared.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now just hold that as we come a
[1:26:07] little bit further here. Now here is
[1:26:10] what was in this little woman. She was
[1:26:13] one of his attributes
[1:26:18] and there was a priest representing the
[1:26:20] light
[1:26:22] and he had learned it from the Bible.
[1:26:26] He had learned that God was God.
[1:26:30] He had learned that holiness was right.
[1:26:34] And he was learned that there was a law
[1:26:36] of God.
[1:26:38] He learned it because of intellectual
[1:26:40] conception.
[1:26:42] And he was born of the right lineage. He
[1:26:45] was a Levite. But the but he only knew
[1:26:49] it only knew it by intellectual
[1:26:52] conception.
[1:26:57] They learned that Malachi 4
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; was right.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; They learned that it was to be Luke
[1:27:05] 17:30.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And they learned that there was a
[1:27:09] messenger to to the Leodysian church.
[1:27:12] And they learned it was the Leodysian
[1:27:14] church age. And they learned that the
[1:27:17] conditions of the age actually were
[1:27:19] there. They learned it and they accepted
[1:27:21] it. And they were the right lineage.
[1:27:23] They were born into families and they
[1:27:25] were they they worked with people and
[1:27:27] they learned that they learned all of
[1:27:30] these things. They learned what happened
[1:27:31] on Sunset Mountain and they they learned
[1:27:34] how the cloud and they learned all about
[1:27:36] the cloud and what the cloud was and
[1:27:38] they learned these things. Let me tell
[1:27:40] you, it takes a lot more than learning
[1:27:42] it.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; There's people aren't even in church
[1:27:50] today that have learned those things.
[1:27:53] And they can talk to you about that
[1:27:55] inside out and backwards and upward up
[1:27:58] and down. They can give quotes and all
[1:28:01] the rest of it. That's not where it's
[1:28:03] at, friends.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, if I if I went and sat down went
[1:28:08] to my study right now and left you with
[1:28:09] that, that's as true as it can be.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And that's why there's a lot of people
[1:28:15] wonder about within the message. They
[1:28:17] wonder about, you know, others around
[1:28:19] them or things that they hear from
[1:28:22] and say, "Well, how can that be in the
[1:28:24] message?" It's not in the message.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; That isn't the message.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; You can know all about, we can have
[1:28:36] learned all about it for years and
[1:28:40] years.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I want to say the learning
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; is not where it's at. Right.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; So now, Brother Brandham says that he
[1:28:52] had learned that
[1:28:54] he had learned that holiness was right
[1:28:56] and he had learned about God and he was
[1:28:59] a Levite himself. So he knew he was in
[1:29:02] position for it. He was in line for it
[1:29:04] and he had learned all these things. But
[1:29:07] he had only learned it by intellectual
[1:29:09] conception. Now God has given us all an
[1:29:11] intellect. And we hear the word this
[1:29:14] morning, but it has to go beyond that.
[1:29:16] And this is where I'm really asking God
[1:29:18] to help me and to help you especially.
[1:29:20] I've been pondering this very, very deep
[1:29:23] for a number of days now.
[1:29:27] So now
[1:29:30] the Bible says this concerning her. I
[1:29:34] guess this is where I need to go.
[1:29:37] He learned it by what? Brother Brandham
[1:29:40] says by what had happened,
[1:29:44] not what was happening.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And that's where it all hangs.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He learned it by what had happened.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; So this this had taken place. This is
[1:29:56] all part of the history, but not what
[1:30:00] was happening.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; So the woman even at the well, she says
[1:30:04] to Jesus, she says, "Are you greater
[1:30:07] than Jacob?" She knew all about Jacob.
[1:30:10] Who gave us this? Well, she knew all
[1:30:12] about this was Jacob's well. She knew
[1:30:14] that Jacob was are you greater than our
[1:30:16] fathers? She knew that he was the father
[1:30:19] of the one of the fathers of the faith.
[1:30:21] She she had a knowledge of these things.
[1:30:23] She also knew about worship. She said,
[1:30:26] well, the you know the Samaritans say we
[1:30:28] should worship in this mountain and the
[1:30:30] Jews say we should worship in Jerusalem.
[1:30:33] There was a lot of things that she knew
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; and she had learned it also.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; But the one thing that the attribute of
[1:30:41] God is determined to do is to connect
[1:30:45] the future or the past with the present.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Actually make a connection
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; and the connection was
[1:30:55] I am he.
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:31:01] And brother Vanam said she only had one
[1:31:04] one little thing down there.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; She only had one little thing. That
[1:31:08] little seed down there.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; All she knew. And it was a word.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; It was a word.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; And it was somebody else's thought.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; It was not even her own conception
[1:31:19] because she couldn't figure it out. She
[1:31:21] said, "I I I I know when the Messiah
[1:31:24] comes, he'll tell us everything."
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; She never learned that
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; because she had never experienced it,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; but she just knew when the Messiah
[1:31:34] comes, when that happens, when when when
[1:31:37] his coming and and the and and the
[1:31:40] expectation of the future and the
[1:31:42] present merge together.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I that speak to thee am
[1:31:49] he." No,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; she didn't say, you know, give me a
[1:31:53] lesson on that.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Are you following me this morning?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I that speak to thee am he.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And there was a merging together
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; of what she had understood. But Jesus
[1:32:08] Jesus kept moving her because it was
[1:32:11] that seed that was in her that was the
[1:32:14] attribute. She was an attribute of God.
[1:32:17] She was a thought of God. And now the
[1:32:20] the whole word, the whole word was
[1:32:23] standing there.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the fullness of the word.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And I read so many times in this last
[1:32:31] week, brother Brandon went over and over
[1:32:34] and over again when he talked about us
[1:32:35] being an attribute. You're an attribute
[1:32:37] of his thinking from the beginning.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; But he says, "But when he was here on
[1:32:42] earth, he was the fullness."
[1:32:44] So he included all of that that was in
[1:32:47] God in the beginning.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And that is why even in this day when he
[1:32:51] revealed himself again as a son of man,
[1:32:54] the words that he spoke out, touched and
[1:32:57] reached something within you because you
[1:32:59] were an attribute and that and he was
[1:33:02] called, he was ordained to bring you
[1:33:05] back.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, that's how redemption
[1:33:08] was to take place.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm saying this right. It's such
[1:33:13] a deep truth to me. You were an
[1:33:15] attribute in God. And then the prophet
[1:33:17] said, "That's why you went with him to
[1:33:20] Calvary.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You died. You died with him." That's not
[1:33:24] some little poetic license. You hung on
[1:33:27] Calvary with him.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; You went to the grave with him
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; and you actually raised the third day
[1:33:40] with him.
[1:33:42] because he was the fullness and you're a
[1:33:44] part of the fullness.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; You're an attribute and she was an
[1:33:49] attribute. And there they both are at
[1:33:51] the well. The the priest couldn't get it
[1:33:53] cuz he wasn't an attribute. The prophet
[1:33:55] said he had no representation.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; But but she was an attribute. And so
[1:34:01] Jesus just stood there and he just he
[1:34:03] just pushed aside all of the trouble of
[1:34:06] her life and all of the sin and all of
[1:34:09] the confusion and all of the chaos until
[1:34:12] he uncovered the attribute.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the word comes for.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; When you hear the messages and I hear
[1:34:29] them, I feel I'm not even worthy.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And oh, I I I I I look again this
[1:34:35] morning. How many times he said this
[1:34:37] this ministry, this revealing of the
[1:34:40] secret of the heart of the people, this
[1:34:42] is the sign of the resurrection.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; You and I have received the sign of the
[1:34:47] resurrection. I want to declare to you
[1:34:50] in front of the whole world today and
[1:34:52] whoever is streaming, I believe that
[1:34:54] that was the sign of the resurrection
[1:34:56] and I have received the sign of the
[1:34:59] resurrection.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; I've already received it.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It responds to that seed
[1:35:06] down inside.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; I may not see all the signs in the world
[1:35:12] that I want to see. I may not see it
[1:35:14] happening, unfolding the way I would
[1:35:16] like to see it unfolding. That's not
[1:35:20] for us to determine.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; It is for you and I to agree
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; with what he said.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; And if he said
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; this is a sign of the resurrection,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; if he said this is the last great sign,
[1:35:34] you can go along every day and say, I am
[1:35:37] identified with the sign of the
[1:35:39] resurrection.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; I am identified with the last great
[1:35:43] sign. I am identified with a messenger
[1:35:47] who actually spoke the very thoughts of
[1:35:49] God. Speaking the thoughts of God is
[1:35:53] speaking the attributes of God.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And there's no wonder that you
[1:35:58] responded. If you were an attribute, you
[1:36:00] had to respond to it.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; You could say, "You're speaking my
[1:36:06] language, prophet.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You're speaking my language.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; That's what I understand.
[1:36:13] Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And that is why
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; it is the most amazing thing I have
[1:36:21] experienced. Brother Milo and I we've
[1:36:25] been in you know
[1:36:27] in in Yugoslavia before it became
[1:36:30] Slovenia and Macedonian, Serbian, Bosnia
[1:36:34] and all these different states.
[1:36:38] And I'm just going to make a confession
[1:36:40] now.
[1:36:42] I'm a very precise person
[1:36:45] and milk is a very general person
[1:36:50] and we all know that. Oh yeah, it'll be
[1:36:52] fine. Sure. You know, just he said, you
[1:36:55] know, just a bowl full of cherries with
[1:36:58] a banana on top or a bowl full of
[1:36:59] bananas with a cherry on top. And I
[1:37:01] thought, you know, Milco, be more
[1:37:03] specific.
[1:37:05] And I found out it was a trade of the
[1:37:07] people over there.
[1:37:09] God bless our brother
[1:37:12] Larry and I'm sure brother Jonathan is
[1:37:14] translating right now. But I was so
[1:37:16] anxious to know because he was
[1:37:19] translating the message and brother
[1:37:22] Brandham and brother Brandham's message
[1:37:24] and brother Mila would read it and he
[1:37:26] said, "Oh, this is so perfect, so
[1:37:29] wonderful." And I had such difficulty
[1:37:33] because
[1:37:35] brother Lar didn't speak English.
[1:37:39] He didn't speak English.
[1:37:43] And I had I was in a dilemma. And not
[1:37:46] only that, you know, Milco remembers I
[1:37:49] said, "How can it be so perfect?
[1:37:53] How can the translation be perfect when
[1:37:55] he doesn't speak English?"
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know, but it's
[1:38:02] beautiful."
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; And after a few years, Mila won out.
[1:38:12] I lost
[1:38:15] because he I'm not Serbian. I'm not
[1:38:18] Croatian. He can read the language. He
[1:38:20] can read English book. I didn't have
[1:38:22] that advantage. He just said it's
[1:38:24] perfect. It's just beautiful. These can
[1:38:26] be translated and these can be printed.
[1:38:28] And that's exactly what's happened.
[1:38:30] Those very messages been translated been
[1:38:32] printed. So,
[1:38:35] one time I was in brother
[1:38:39] uh Eva's car. We were driving. Were we
[1:38:43] in Germany, weren't we? Had been in a
[1:38:45] had he came up from Yugoslavia to
[1:38:48] Germany and we were in a convention.
[1:38:51] And so, Brother Mila was there and I
[1:38:53] wanted to find out how the message was
[1:38:56] doing. And I'm always very keen on how
[1:39:00] it's, you know, how the translations are
[1:39:02] happening, how the books are being
[1:39:03] distributed because you're so anxious
[1:39:05] for others to enjoy this wonderful
[1:39:08] truth. So I said, "Brother Eva,
[1:39:12] how is the message, you know, how is the
[1:39:16] message uh
[1:39:19] happening? How is it taking place? How
[1:39:21] is it progressing
[1:39:23] in in uh in your country, in your area?
[1:39:29] There's quietness for a little while. He
[1:39:31] said,
[1:39:33] "Well, I live in a little village by the
[1:39:36] sea."
[1:39:38] And I thought, "What does this have to
[1:39:40] do with it? I want to know how the
[1:39:42] message is doing. He's telling me I live
[1:39:44] in a little village by the sea." And
[1:39:46] he's going to start telling me a story.
[1:39:48] You remember it? And I just kind of give
[1:39:50] up right then. I wasn't I wasn't
[1:39:52] prepared to go all the way from a
[1:39:54] village by the sea to what was
[1:39:56] happening, right? I wanted to know
[1:39:58] exactly what was taking place at that
[1:40:00] time. But I learned a great lesson. You
[1:40:04] might say to me, "Well, how how how does
[1:40:06] that work?" I don't know how that works.
[1:40:09] But I I can tell you that I have been in
[1:40:11] places I've been in Malawi and I've been
[1:40:13] in Zimbabwe and in places in Africa
[1:40:16] where the people didn't have a real good
[1:40:18] grasp of the of the perhaps the
[1:40:19] language. But it was incredible how the
[1:40:23] Holy Spirit gave them accuracy
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; in translating the message
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; because somehow they could catch the
[1:40:31] spirit of it. I don't know how. I'm not
[1:40:32] going to go any further than that, but
[1:40:34] I'm going to tell you that that has
[1:40:35] happened.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; And that is one place that I know it has
[1:40:38] happened. And there's many of those
[1:40:40] books that our brother Larga
[1:40:42] translated and they're the ones that are
[1:40:44] probably on the hub today and everything
[1:40:45] else.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; You see, it is the it is
[1:40:51] God has his own way. When brother
[1:40:52] Brandham, I want you to think about
[1:40:54] this. He said,
[1:40:56] "I just say a word."
[1:41:01] And this is where we kind of get lost.
[1:41:02] I'm kind of lost myself. But I just say
[1:41:05] a word.
[1:41:07] But I can tell you that it's very it's
[1:41:09] very very possible. It's very possible.
[1:41:12] It's a reality for a person. And I have
[1:41:16] experienced that many times here at the
[1:41:18] pulpit or praying. You start praying for
[1:41:22] someone
[1:41:23] and while you're praying or you might be
[1:41:25] at home praying over a situation and you
[1:41:28] get into prayer and you're speaking and
[1:41:31] finally you realize that it's bypassed
[1:41:34] your mind
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and you start to say things
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; and even your mind I be I pray for
[1:41:41] people this is one thing that happens
[1:41:43] quite frequently I pray for people and
[1:41:46] when you're pray in prayer and other
[1:41:48] people are praying and then suddenly
[1:41:50] Even my mind catches
[1:41:54] that the words that are coming out
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; are not my own words,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; not my own thoughts.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; now, you're going to think that I'm
[1:42:01] really, really gone off the deep end.
[1:42:06] Sometimes, and this is not unusual
[1:42:08] either, uh a man of God, I can only
[1:42:11] speak about myself. You get preaching
[1:42:14] and the preaching and the word it starts
[1:42:16] coming and the Holy Spirit and it just
[1:42:19] starts flowing through you and you're
[1:42:20] speaking and saying things
[1:42:23] not in your notes and not in your mind.
[1:42:26] In fact is my mind feels like it's over
[1:42:29] here independent and I'm listening to
[1:42:32] what's being said
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; and I actually have heard whole
[1:42:36] statement and my mind said that was
[1:42:38] good.
[1:42:45] In other words, I got blessed after the
[1:42:48] fact. Now you're going to think we're
[1:42:50] really in a loony place. No. No. The
[1:42:53] prophets spoke things that they didn't
[1:42:55] know. and they didn't understand. And
[1:42:58] brother Brandham said, "If they had
[1:42:59] known what they were saying, they would
[1:43:00] in no wise have said it." So they didn't
[1:43:03] have a comprehension. They didn't have
[1:43:05] what I'm trying to say is that and to
[1:43:07] bring to you today, friends, it's it's
[1:43:10] not just that we have a learning. It's
[1:43:12] not just that we have a history in the
[1:43:14] message. But the the what we have in the
[1:43:17] message and what we should really fully
[1:43:19] realize is that these are attributes of
[1:43:23] God.
[1:43:24] The thought is the attribute. And it's
[1:43:28] so glorious to me to think that God
[1:43:31] would rear up a man, raise a man that
[1:43:35] didn't have good learning.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And kept saying, "I have a hard time
[1:43:41] reading. I only have a grade seven
[1:43:43] education." So God even saw to it that
[1:43:46] he was he was uh uh uh hindered in that
[1:43:50] in that aspect. And yet you talk about
[1:43:54] speak things. You get into the future
[1:43:56] home of the heavenly bridegroom, earthly
[1:43:59] bride. Brother Brandham says more in
[1:44:00] three pages than Bible schools teach in
[1:44:03] years.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; You just wonder where does this wisdom
[1:44:06] come from? What is this man tapped into?
[1:44:09] I can tell you he's tapped right into
[1:44:12] the very mind of almighty God.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And he's bringing to us. And when you
[1:44:18] hear the messages and you hear it
[1:44:20] preached and you hear it declared by
[1:44:22] God's servants reminding you and and
[1:44:25] impressing you that that is not just a
[1:44:28] sermon that is not just a book and
[1:44:31] people think of it where some kind of
[1:44:33] cult or whatever they can think what
[1:44:35] they want to think but this there is no
[1:44:38] message on earth that has been so
[1:44:41] powerfully vindicated by God himself.
[1:44:45] And that's why he says, "How can I tell
[1:44:47] you where you're from and where you were
[1:44:49] 10 years ago and what you're going to do
[1:44:51] 10 years from now?" What he's trying to
[1:44:53] say, that is the dividing line.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; That is the separating line.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; That's what declares this is God's
[1:45:01] thought.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Friends, that has never happened.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Never happened in the history of
[1:45:08] mankind.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; We ought to wake up. We ought to be
[1:45:12] fully aware. say, "Oh God, why did you
[1:45:15] do this in this generation? This must be
[1:45:18] a very significant time." It is.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; It's resurrection time
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; and it's the change we all have been
[1:45:25] waiting for
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; and they shall be changed and God said
[1:45:29] because in God's mind he had in his mind
[1:45:33] I'm going to change them.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; And so he had apostle Paul says we will
[1:45:38] all be changed. But then in the end time
[1:45:41] he sends a messenger with exactly the
[1:45:44] ministry of Jesus Christ exactly with
[1:45:47] the same ministry out of the same
[1:45:50] atmosphere and environment out of
[1:45:52] poverty out of the wilderness a man of
[1:45:56] the wilderness. All the very same
[1:45:58] characteristics of Elijah. He sent it to
[1:46:01] for one purpose. Not so brother Brandham
[1:46:03] could hunt and do a number of things but
[1:46:05] so that we could look back and identify
[1:46:09] This is the mouthpiece
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; to tell us of the hour that we're in
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; so we can bring the past and tie it
[1:46:16] together with the present.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; That one who was speaking to the woman
[1:46:21] at the well. That is the one who has
[1:46:24] called you and I.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; That is the one who has spoken in this
[1:46:28] age.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; That is the one who used a prophet
[1:46:32] messenger. That is the one whose words
[1:46:35] himself is life and life eternal.
[1:46:38] Hallelujah. And so I can say to you, I'm
[1:46:41] not looking forward to the resurrection.
[1:46:43] The resurrection's already here in the
[1:46:46] in the power of the word that's already
[1:46:48] been spoken. The word for the change is
[1:46:50] already here. The word for the rapture
[1:46:53] is already present. The past and the
[1:46:56] present have united together.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And we're not speaking by intellectual
[1:47:02] what has happened. We're speaking about
[1:47:04] what is happening.
[1:47:06] Amen.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And that's the difference. That's why
[1:47:10] we're here at church this morning. You
[1:47:12] can say, "What did you do at church?" I
[1:47:13] found out about things that are
[1:47:15] happening.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; I'm involved with what is happening.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; The woman, she proved she was an
[1:47:21] attribute by identifying what was
[1:47:23] happening, what is happening.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And the priest, he only knew what had
[1:47:28] happened.
[1:47:30] Far be it
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; from Cloverdale Bible Way to have become
[1:47:34] identified as a church. Oh, we know
[1:47:37] about Sabina Canyon and we know about
[1:47:39] this place. Nothing wrong with those
[1:47:40] places. I've been there myself. That's
[1:47:43] we're we're not that's we're not living
[1:47:45] on a historical plane. We're not even
[1:47:47] living about the phenomena. We're living
[1:47:50] in how that relates to now
[1:47:53] right now.
[1:47:55] And friends, you need to pray for the
[1:47:57] ministry. We need a ministry who can
[1:47:59] identify those things in the scripture
[1:48:01] and say, "This is where we're at
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; because that's what's going to inspire
[1:48:10] faith in your heart to believe because
[1:48:13] it is by fearing. And it is by faith
[1:48:15] that cometh by hearing." And you will be
[1:48:18] inspired to believe. This is the time
[1:48:22] and this is the hour. Not whether it's
[1:48:24] today or tomorrow. I don't care. But I'm
[1:48:27] in the present.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I'm in the present.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; This word is a present word.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; How wonderful. We've had all I can say
[1:48:42] over and over and over and over again.
[1:48:44] Never tired of it. We've had the God
[1:48:46] sent channel.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; How important is that? Without that
[1:48:52] channel, there is no change.
[1:48:56] If
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; you don't identify that channel and
[1:48:59] believe in that channel,
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; there is no change.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; This will never come through a
[1:49:04] university. This will never come through
[1:49:07] learning. This will never come through
[1:49:09] school. Never come even through
[1:49:10] preaching. It'll come by a minister just
[1:49:13] being able to get before God and saying,
[1:49:15] "There it is, folks.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; There's the light there.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; There's the angel there. Follow him.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Follow this word. It'll
[1:49:25] bring about the change in your life, in
[1:49:28] your character, and in your body.
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] Now,
[1:49:54] I I won't have time to go all into this,
[1:50:00] but just some things for you to think
[1:50:01] about and go home and go back and study
[1:50:04] it.
[1:50:09] In the restoration of the bride tree.
[1:50:13] In the restoration of the bride tree.
[1:50:17] Brother Brandham
[1:50:19] he reads uh
[1:50:22] two main scriptures.
[1:50:24] He reads in Joel where the palmer worm
[1:50:27] and the canker worm and so on. Those
[1:50:29] four had eaten the tree.
[1:50:35] And he talked how about they how they
[1:50:37] had eaten the tree. Jesus was the tree
[1:50:40] of life.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; But they couldn't destroy it. The life
[1:50:43] went back to the roots and came back up.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; He talks about the bride tree which was
[1:50:49] in Eden.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; And now it's being restored again.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Now he's saying it's being restored
[1:50:56] again.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Now you might think me overboard,
[1:51:00] but I'm staying with this channel. Now,
[1:51:03] this channel, here's this channel,
[1:51:06] this identified channel,
[1:51:09] none like it. He's not talking about
[1:51:11] philosophy, and he's not talking about
[1:51:13] how to live better. And this is not a
[1:51:15] social gospel. We've got a channel now.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Who is who's speaking about the
[1:51:20] restoration of the bride tree? He says
[1:51:23] she's being restored again.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; All right. And that's why I'm tying it
[1:51:28] to future home as well. He reads two
[1:51:30] scriptures. And the one scripture is out
[1:51:33] of Joel which says I will restore again.
[1:51:37] And then he goes the second scriptures
[1:51:39] in Genesis
[1:51:41] where
[1:51:43] uh uh Abraham takes Sarah and they go
[1:51:45] down into Egypt into Gerrar and the
[1:51:49] Aimilec the young king he said sees her
[1:51:52] as beautiful as she is and he says she's
[1:51:55] a grandma but she sees beautiful and and
[1:51:58] uh this is about two different occasions
[1:52:01] and Abraham arranged with her with Sarah
[1:52:04] that you'll be my sister but she was a
[1:52:06] halfsister.
[1:52:07] but you'll be my sister because they
[1:52:09] might kill me." And so she goes down as
[1:52:12] as his sister. And the princess and so
[1:52:14] on saw her so fair and beautiful took
[1:52:16] her to Pharaoh and uh and uh the king
[1:52:20] Aimilec and Aimilec now he's brother
[1:52:24] Brandham describes getting ready for the
[1:52:25] evening and maybe put his pajamas on and
[1:52:28] whatever more. And God speaks to him
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and says, "You're as good as a dead
[1:52:33] man."
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:52:39] Now we have a messenger. Please stay
[1:52:42] with me now. Close. We have a messenger
[1:52:45] now that is bringing this out to the
[1:52:46] surface. That's not come out like that
[1:52:49] before.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; So he's actually he's an announcing
[1:52:53] messenger. He's saying back there now
[1:52:57] that's happening again. Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; See Joel, it was it was Apostle Peter
[1:53:03] stood up on the day of Pentecost and he
[1:53:06] could read back to Joel where Joel says,
[1:53:08] "In the last day, Seth God, I'll pour
[1:53:10] out my spirit upon all men." And so he
[1:53:12] went, it wasn't something he had just
[1:53:14] learned, but now he picked up what he
[1:53:16] had learned and united it with the
[1:53:18] present. And that is when the learning
[1:53:21] has it has it has effectiveness when
[1:53:25] it's united with what is happening. So
[1:53:27] this is that which was spoken of by Joel
[1:53:30] the prophet. Now brother Brandham goes
[1:53:32] to Joel and he says I will restore Seth
[1:53:35] the Lord.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And then he goes to Genesis now. So he
[1:53:38] takes uh the the scripture refers to the
[1:53:41] whole body of believers. But then he
[1:53:43] takes a scripture that refers to
[1:53:45] Abraham's wife and God speaks to Aimilec
[1:53:49] and he says restore the man his wife.
[1:53:54] God has issued an edict upon this
[1:53:58] generation through a prophet's
[1:54:00] messenger. And there's not enough devils
[1:54:03] in hell to hold back any member of the
[1:54:06] body of Jesus Christ, the bride of
[1:54:08] Christ, because God has told the devil,
[1:54:11] "You're as good as a dead man anyway.
[1:54:14] You are destined for hell, and you are
[1:54:17] going to restore every one of my kids.
[1:54:21] You're going to restore them back. You
[1:54:23] can't hold them. Why? This is the time.
[1:54:26] This is the hour. And I sent my
[1:54:28] messenger with a decree. Give her up.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:39] And that you have to know whether you're
[1:54:42] young or middle-aged or family or
[1:54:44] elderly, whatever it is, you have to
[1:54:45] know that this this whole generation is
[1:54:49] under a decree
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; of Elijah,
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; the messenger.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Who is a who was ordained to reveal
[1:55:00] Jesus Christ,
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom,
[1:55:03] speaking through him to this generation.
[1:55:07] Give her back.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:15] There's nothing can hold you.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And let that be in your thoughts.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; That is the attribute of God.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; That's the thought of God for this
[1:55:27] generation.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And this we've got the right channel.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; We've got the right time.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've got the right people.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; You've been called by that word.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let that ever leave you.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's so wonderful.
[1:56:02] Thank you.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; We can just worship him and thank him.
[1:56:12] [Applause]
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; You just want to enter into that,
[1:56:19] friends. God sent us for you.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; He sent us for you for this time.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] And that is why
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; and I really must close but but that is
[1:56:33] why in the future home you have to if
[1:56:37] you could read the messages and see them
[1:56:38] and put them all in that perspective.
[1:56:44] This is not a sermon. This not just a
[1:56:46] message by brother Brandham. This
[1:56:48] happens to be
[1:56:51] God issuing a decree.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I've called my bride.
[1:56:57] I've shown who I am.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; I expressed and manifested myself
[1:57:02] clearly.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; I did everything I did in the Bible. I
[1:57:05] did it all again.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I revealed the secrets of the hearts. I
[1:57:09] told the people. I healed them. The
[1:57:11] whatever whatever condition, nothing
[1:57:15] could stand before his prayers.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Because it wasn't a man.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; It was God in the man.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't his thoughts. This is not my
[1:57:26] thoughts.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know what I'm saying,
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; but he spoke
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; and it happened.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; And then he comes and begins to tell a
[1:57:36] people who have been called out
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; by this voice. Begins to tell them now
[1:57:41] of a future home and what it's going to
[1:57:44] be like and how how Apostle Peter spoke
[1:57:47] about it. But Apostle John, he just
[1:57:49] referred to it. I make a new heavens and
[1:57:52] a new earth. But Apostle Peter speaks
[1:57:54] about how it's going to happen and how
[1:57:56] the earth is going to be on fire and how
[1:57:59] it's going to belch and it won't lose
[1:58:01] its it's a it won't lose its identify in
[1:58:03] it as its framework the same as God
[1:58:06] cleaned you up. But you didn't lose your
[1:58:08] framework. He just took the sin away
[1:58:11] from you and he took you away from
[1:58:13] Satan. He's going to take the world away
[1:58:15] from Satan. And that's why the heavens
[1:58:18] are going to be on fire. Oh my friends,
[1:58:20] this is a time for us to rejoice.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Every demon spirit
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; is going to be annihilated.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Every spirit
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; that's ever tormented you.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Every evil thought that ever came your
[1:58:37] way,
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; the source of that thought is will be
[1:58:41] gone forever.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to just speak about a
[1:58:45] pie in the sky. I'm here to tell you
[1:58:48] that God's messenger, his validated
[1:58:51] messenger, has already put the earth
[1:58:53] under the decree.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; It's as good as finished.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; God's already declared it.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And friends, you might say, "Well, a
[1:59:05] minister can get up and say that."
[1:59:07] That's not a minister got up and said
[1:59:08] that.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; The attribute from God, God thought
[1:59:12] about the world being renewed.
[1:59:15] God thought about him coming back to the
[1:59:18] earth,
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; not to the Eden that fell, but he
[1:59:21] thought of thought of himself coming
[1:59:22] back to a multitude of people that would
[1:59:25] be sons and daughters, and he's going to
[1:59:28] live with them, and they're going to
[1:59:30] worship him.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; It's already been decreed
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; by his validated voice.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; It's already been decreed.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; You might say, "What can I do?" Agree
[1:59:40] with it.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "I believe that.
[1:59:45] Let something well up within you and
[1:59:46] say, "Yay and amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; A new heaven
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; and a new earth."
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; In the midst of all this ungodliness
[1:59:57] and darkness,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; wherein dwells righteousness,
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; let us say that. Wherein dwells
[2:00:05] righteousness a new heaven and a new
[2:00:07] earth.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; There will be no more death.
[2:00:13] There'll be no more mounds of soil on
[2:00:15] the hillside. There'll be no more
[2:00:17] earthquakes such as Haiti. There'll be
[2:00:20] no more tsunamis. There'll be no more
[2:00:23] cyclones. The prince of the power of the
[2:00:26] air will be bound and destroyed.
[2:00:30] Hallelujah.
[2:00:33] God has sent his messenger to declare
[2:00:36] that this is the time.
[2:00:40] [Applause]
[2:00:43] Glory.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; God sent you his best
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; with the announcement.
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:00:59] [Applause]
[2:01:02] And let me even say
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; even as Tommy Osburn who wasn't able to
[2:01:07] receive the fullness of the message
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; he said it is brother Brandis memorial
[2:01:12] he said I'll be misunderstood
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; but he said God walked through this
[2:01:17] generation
[2:01:18] [Applause]
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; and he said don't misunderstand me
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; there won't be another
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; and I say amen to that there won't be
[2:01:29] another.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; There's not another messenger.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; There will be no other voice like this.
[2:01:35] You'll never have a series of,00 tapes
[2:01:38] or messages like this. You'll never have
[2:01:40] someone else be able to elaborate on the
[2:01:43] future home the way this messenger told
[2:01:45] you about the future home. And he
[2:01:48] declared clearly that you are being
[2:01:50] restored back even now
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; to the bride tree.
[2:01:58] back to Eden.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; I'll make this announcement. You are on
[2:02:02] your way
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; back to Eden again.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; And this word is the empowers you. This
[2:02:10] word you just step on it and this word
[2:02:14] is taking you there.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to try to get there. This
[2:02:17] word will take you there. This word will
[2:02:20] change you. This word will rapture you
[2:02:22] if this word will resurrect you if you
[2:02:24] die. We have it all, friends. We have it
[2:02:27] all.
[2:02:29] Hallelujah.
[2:02:30] Hallelujah.
[2:02:32] Why don't we just stand to our feet?
[2:02:35] Give him praise.
[2:02:37] Hallelujah.
[2:02:39] He's provided everything.
[2:02:41] [Applause]
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; He's provided everything that we have
[2:02:50] here.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:02:57] Glory.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:03:05] [Music]
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; What grace is this and what power is
[2:03:10] this? You'd send us to a wretched people
[2:03:14] such a message as you have.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; give us a mighty voice.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Give us a voice that will reach the
[2:03:24] winds of the earth.
[2:03:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; I want the church to be in prayer for
[2:03:34] the meetings in Switzerland. God is
[2:03:37] doing marvelous things, great and
[2:03:39] glorious things. He's raising up an army
[2:03:42] of people that have been in the message
[2:03:44] for years, but they have been quickened
[2:03:47] by the Holy Spirit. praying for the
[2:03:50] ministers, the pastors, brother Frasar
[2:03:53] and also brother Jean Jax and other
[2:03:56] ministers that will be taking place. Oh,
[2:03:58] we pray that God will so inspire the
[2:04:01] ministers that will be there for these
[2:04:04] meetings up into Germany with brother
[2:04:06] Garald
[2:04:08] and about three weeks later into Moscow
[2:04:11] where the church has been built and
[2:04:13] they're just there sitting on little
[2:04:15] rough benches. They've built and worked
[2:04:18] hard all winter, but they're going to
[2:04:20] have the dedication, Lord willing, May
[2:04:22] one. Pray God send a mighty voice
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; through those people through Russia and
[2:04:29] the surrounding nations. Oh, what a day
[2:04:32] that will be, friends, when the gates
[2:04:34] swing open wide and the redeemed are
[2:04:37] marching in, marching home. Oh,
[2:04:42] to be in that number. Oh, to be in that
[2:04:44] number. Glorious, glorious Jesus Christ.
[2:04:49] Hallelujah.
[2:04:50] Hallelujah.
[2:04:52] Hallelujah.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Are you in that number?
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Not how you feel, but are you in that
[2:04:58] number? Tell the devil, I'm in that
[2:05:01] number. I'm out of your reach. I'm
[2:05:05] beyond the scope of your grip. You
[2:05:07] cannot hold me. Tell the devil he's
[2:05:10] under a decree.
[2:05:12] Elijah
[2:05:14] has brought a decree upon him. You've
[2:05:16] lost your power.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil what Elijah said. You're
[2:05:20] a bluff.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Tell your sickness what God's attribute
[2:05:30] thought about it.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; There be no more sickness.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to
[2:05:42] God. How about we just sing in I'm in
[2:05:46] that number. I'm in that number.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; I'm in that number.
[2:05:56] I'm in that number.
[2:05:59] I'm in that number.
[2:06:02] Roll in.
[2:06:05] I'm in that number.
[2:06:08] I'm in that number.
[2:06:11] I'm in that number
[2:06:14] rolling.
[2:06:17] I'm in that number
[2:06:20] that was
[2:06:23] in that number.
[2:06:29] And in that number
[2:06:32] that was the first
[2:06:35] and in that number
[2:06:41] John saw that number
[2:06:44] that was number
[2:06:47] John saw that number
[2:06:49] rolling
[2:06:52] John saw that number
[2:06:55] that was
[2:06:58] John saw that number.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother Brandham said,
[2:07:06] "I saw you all over there."
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Is that just a Is that just a little bit
[2:07:16] of
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; poetic life? Is that a reality?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; So, you over there.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; What joy is this? Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Over there, friends.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Not here at home in Cloverdale,
[2:07:34] Washington or wherever.
[2:07:36] Mary'sville, Seattle, Tacoma,
[2:07:40] Abbottzford, wherever. No, he saw us
[2:07:43] over there.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Brother never said, "I saw you here
[2:07:48] struggling and I saw you here failing
[2:07:51] and I saw you here in all your misery."
[2:07:54] No, he said, "I saw you there.
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:07:59] Amen.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; There's even a place in British Columbia
[2:08:07] that I don't think but very very few
[2:08:09] people, very few ever see, ever saw.
[2:08:14] And I've lived here all my life pretty
[2:08:16] well, but I never saw it till I was up
[2:08:18] there and we took Brother Brandham up
[2:08:21] with Brother Southwick.
[2:08:24] If I could describe it to you,
[2:08:27] it'd be hard for you to believe,
[2:08:30] but it would be right on top of the
[2:08:32] mountain ridges. They call it alpine
[2:08:34] country, but it's more than alpine.
[2:08:37] And it just grass
[2:08:39] and flowers so delicate.
[2:08:43] So delicate. About half the size of my
[2:08:47] fingernail.
[2:08:49] Just tiny pink. I put my camera down,
[2:08:51] took pictures of these flowers. I sat
[2:08:53] there and and saw them just coming and
[2:08:56] cropping up out of the shale and out of
[2:08:57] the rock and I thought, "Oh, God, why do
[2:09:01] these things even happen here?" The most
[2:09:03] delicate, magnificent flowers and the
[2:09:06] grass and everything. And and we sat
[2:09:09] there eating our lunch.
[2:09:11] Brother and I just sitting there and
[2:09:14] down there a bunch of mountain sheep,
[2:09:17] stone mountain sheep. So he just started
[2:09:18] counting 38 and they were having their
[2:09:22] lunch while we had our lunch.
[2:09:24] I thought this is like heaven, brother
[2:09:26] Nathan.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; It's like heaven.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And and Brother Graham, he just looked
[2:09:31] up. There's just a vast valley up this
[2:09:33] way and this thousands of acres of grass
[2:09:38] and way down below maybe river or
[2:09:41] streams look like human hair.
[2:09:45] and he looked down the valley this way
[2:09:47] and up this way and say, "You know,
[2:09:50] brother Eddie, on the other side,
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; it's just very much like this.
[2:09:55] [Music]
[2:09:57] Why wouldn't we want to go there? That's
[2:09:59] where we're going."
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "When you get over there,
[2:10:04] you'll find little trails."
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "You walk down one of those one
[2:10:09] day and you'll find me."
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:14] Whatever happens in this life, that's
[2:10:17] the one thing I'm counting on. I'm I'm
[2:10:19] looking for a trail.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is it just something, you
[2:10:24] know, a picture in our mind? No. No. A
[2:10:27] reality.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; It's beyond that. It's true and it's
[2:10:33] real.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. Well, I'd like to just think,
[2:10:40] too, there's been a change in me since
[2:10:42] Jesus set me free. So, we're declaring
[2:10:45] already there's been a change. And
[2:10:47] perhaps, Brother Nathan, I could have
[2:10:48] you come up and just close in prayer.
[2:10:51] Brother Ernie will be speaking tonight.
[2:10:52] Come early, please. Cuz it's a going to
[2:10:56] be a great service.
[2:11:01] in a change in me
[2:11:05] since Jesus set me free.
[2:11:11] I
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; that's the past. I'm born again.
[2:11:18] That's the present.
[2:11:22] Turn around.
[2:11:25] My feet are on solid ground.
[2:11:30] Someday I'll wear my crown.
[2:11:35] Oh, what a change. Do you believe it for
[2:11:39] yourself? There's been a change in me.
[2:11:45] Jesus set me free.
[2:11:50] I
[2:11:51] calary
[2:11:54] and born again.
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:11:59] I cannot turn around.
[2:12:04] My feet are on
[2:12:07] ground.
[2:12:08] Someday I'll wear a crown.
[2:12:13] Oh,
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; why don't you turn around and shake
[2:12:19] hands with a few people? Hands you're
[2:12:21] going to shake on the other side.
[2:12:24] Isn't that all right?
[2:12:27] [Music]
[2:12:28] See you on the other side, brother
[2:12:30] sister.
[2:12:33] Come, brother Nathan. There's been a
[2:12:36] change
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:40] since Jesus said
[2:12:45] I
[2:12:47] [Music]
[2:12:55] cannot turn around. Oh no, my feet are
[2:13:00] on
[2:13:02] ground.
[2:13:04] [Applause]
[2:13:05] I'll wear a crown.
[2:13:08] Oh, what a change.
[2:13:13] And let everyone say, I believe it.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Nathan.

[2:17:16] service tonight, our brother Ernie is
[2:17:18] going to be speaking to us on Wednesday
[2:17:21] evening and Friday evening. Uh was there
[2:17:25] young people's this coming Friday or no?
[2:17:27] Cuz we wanted to have the uh like to
[2:17:30] we're having the prayer service. We
[2:17:31] started just last Friday. Uh, and I
[2:17:35] wanted to come. I generally I'm studying
[2:17:37] on Friday night or visiting has been so
[2:17:39] hard. But we just decided I said to my
[2:17:42] wife, I want to be to the prayer
[2:17:43] service. So, we went there and it was
[2:17:45] lovely, lovely presence and a nice group
[2:17:48] of people, probably 50 people or so were
[2:17:50] there and young people and families were
[2:17:53] there. So, I just want to encourage you
[2:17:55] on Friday night, we'll be in the
[2:17:57] fellowship room and and uh in another
[2:18:00] week or two, we're going to be just
[2:18:02] adjusting the order of it a wee bit
[2:18:04] because there's certain certain ones
[2:18:06] which I have been very very blessed with
[2:18:08] their testimony and so maybe after
[2:18:10] prayer we might just hear somebody give
[2:18:12] their testimony and that way we get
[2:18:15] better acquainted with one another. And
[2:18:17] I tell you, there's some rich
[2:18:18] testimonies here. So, God bless you and
[2:18:20] all of you, brother Oed and uh Brother
[2:18:24] Israel or those that have come from
[2:18:27] Seattle. Uh I I hope that you have a
[2:18:31] place to eat and something to eat and a
[2:18:34] place to put your feet up and that
[2:18:36] you'll be looked after. Amen. We
[2:18:39] appreciate you coming this long ways.
[2:18:41] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:18:44] name.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
