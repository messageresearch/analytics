[0:00] the Lord Jesus that promised as it was
[0:03] in the days of lot so shall it be at the
[0:07] coming of the son of man the very God
[0:10] that wrote the Bible said Jesus Christ
[0:12] is the same yesterday day and forever
[0:14] and he said he that believeth on me the
[0:17] works that I do shall he also yes yes do
[0:21] you get what I mean amen then that
[0:24] honest hearted man saw the glory of God
[0:29] he saw it in action and he cried out as
[0:33] a sinner and confessed himself to be a
[0:37] sinner yes my God he had never seen
[0:39] anything like that so real before he
[0:42] confessed that he was a sinner then what
[0:45] happened when the prophet got ready to
[0:49] confess then come the real cleansing yes
[0:54] until the people gets ready to confess
[0:57] there's no need to have these healing
[0:59] services that's right amen that's right
[1:02] if you will confess your sins confess
[1:05] your
[1:05] unbelief confess the things that you're
[1:08] doing wrong then God can do something
[1:10] but until there is a
[1:13] confession there can be no cleansing yes
[1:16] and as soon as Isaiah said W is me I'm a
[1:20] man of unclean lips and I'll dwell with
[1:24] people of unclean lips then come the
[1:27] confession the then come the Chan with
[1:31] the
[1:33] father and as soon as Isaiah said who is
[1:37] me I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell
[1:41] with people of unclean lips then come
[1:44] the confession that then come the cheran
[1:49] with the
[1:50] father did you notice God never used a
[1:54] seminary to cleanse him with that's
[1:56] right he never used a a book of law to
[2:00] clean him with he cleansed him by fire
[2:03] amen amen God always cleanses his
[2:07] servants when he's ready to put him in
[2:08] Duty by the Holy Ghost and
[2:11] Fire God cleanses by fire not by books
[2:16] not by education not by intellectual
[2:19] conception not by denomination but by
[2:22] the fire of the Holy Spirit God cleanses
[2:25] his servant amen that's right amen then
[2:29] notice
[2:30] then after the
[2:32] confession after the cleansing then come
[2:36] the commission yes yes then was the
[2:39] commission after confessed and cleansed
[2:42] it was then that the clean
[2:45] Isaiah answered God and said here am I
[2:49] send
[2:50] me after he was
[2:53] cleansed confessed cleans by the fire
[2:58] then that clean eye Isaiah was ready for
[3:01] work he was ready to be an example he
[3:04] was ready to to have to put his life
[3:08] thought that others could be influenced
[3:10] by him amen but until he had confessed
[3:13] it until he was cleansed then he was a
[3:17] very poor influence just as a puppet for
[3:20] the king
