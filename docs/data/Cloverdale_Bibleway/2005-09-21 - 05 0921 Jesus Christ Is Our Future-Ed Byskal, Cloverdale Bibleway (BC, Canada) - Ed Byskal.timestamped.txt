[20:24] and rushed out and got the doctor and he
[20:25] delivered a healthy baby girl. 9 lb 14
[20:29] oz.

[21:49] six who is extremely sick with liver and
[21:51] pancre [music]
[21:52] pancreas cancer uh which is extremely

[21:56] same floor [music] as sister Marjorie
[21:58] Miller and that they told the family
[22:00] that they'd be praying their sweet
[22:02] Christian family and apparently they

[22:06] they have written here I just don't
[22:08] believe this is by chance that she's on
[22:10] the same floor. So may God move on their

[43:23] the lamb
[43:25] that was slain.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Let's bow just before we turn to the
[43:32] word. [music]
[43:34] Father, we're here to serve you. We want
[43:37] to serve you in spirit and in truth. We
[43:40] have been worshiping, Lord, in spirit
[43:42] and in truth. Now we come to your word
[43:46] which is truth. It's all true. And we
[43:50] ask that its truths will sink down into
[43:53] the v inner recesses of our souls. Take
[43:57] charge of every mind and thought. Lord,
[44:00] may the thoughts of today have passed
[44:03] away. Lord, may any concerns about
[44:05] tomorrow be forgotten. And may we now
[44:08] come into your presence and say, "Only
[44:11] you, Lord. Only you. You're the fountain
[44:14] that I run to.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; We thank you with joy in our hearts that
[44:19] we're able to be here in your divine
[44:21] presence. Now take each one of us, Lord,
[44:24] myself. I pray you'll anoint me, oh God.
[44:27] Let the people be anointed to hear, to
[44:30] receive, and be benefited. Let the seed
[44:33] now fall into good ground in Jesus
[44:36] Christ's name. Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:40] Well, here we are this evening, a
[44:42] Wednesday evening.
[44:44] At least we're not
[44:47] amongst the numbers of uh I understand
[44:50] over one and a quarter million fleeing
[44:53] another hurricane
[44:56] that has swept in over the Gulf and uh
[45:00] they say it's a a storm five now and uh
[45:05] just hundreds of thousands of people
[45:08] fleeing. For some, it's the fourth time
[45:10] this year.
[45:12] You heard me about two Sundays ago, and
[45:15] I I draw a parallel between this and
[45:19] what was happening in Israel.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And my wife and I were talking and she
[45:24] observed and I thought it was very very
[45:25] perceptive.
[45:27] But this what she had received from it.
[45:31] How that the pressure the pressure from
[45:36] this western countries and not only
[45:39] United States but from all the western
[45:40] countries
[45:42] uh but but I I would say that United
[45:44] States laid the led the charge
[45:48] to displace
[45:51] people in Israel
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and to mow their buildings down. And now
[45:56] that's exactly what's happening within
[45:58] our own coasts.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; It's being displaced by hundreds of
[46:03] thousands more than we're displaced. You
[46:05] don't touch Israel, friends. You don't
[46:07] touch Israel without being affected. And
[46:10] and the two things the two things that
[46:14] she I would say engineered was the
[46:17] removal of the people and the
[46:19] destruction of their homes. And that's
[46:21] exactly what came back. It's coming back
[46:24] even now. and may come back for it's a
[46:27] sign of the time.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; It's a sign of the time. And when God
[46:31] starts to do something, if he begins to
[46:33] use the elements, I'll tell you, it's a
[46:35] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[46:37] a living God. And you can't we we just
[46:41] can't say that the things that are
[46:42] happening in the nations, in the world
[46:44] is just happening. It's not just
[46:46] circumstance. God is ordering all of
[46:49] these things that is taking place. And
[46:52] so, of course, we're we're sad for the
[46:55] people that are, but it I tell you, a
[46:57] lot of innocent people get caught in the
[47:00] in the deeds of of men who go against
[47:04] the word of God. And so, we're here
[47:06] tonight and you you want to be very
[47:08] thankful you're here tonight to catch
[47:10] whatever the Holy Spirit will have for
[47:12] you. Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn
[47:16] to James, please.
[47:19] uh
[47:21] the fourth chapter of James which James
[47:24] comes right after Hebrews.
[47:29] And tonight I don't know how much we'll
[47:31] preach, maybe more just study.
[47:35] We'll just see how the Lord will take
[47:37] it. Nice to have you here again. Brother
[47:40] Ernie, we've been having meetings and
[47:42] brother Ernie's been down with brother
[47:44] Samuel Dale and a number of other
[47:46] pastors down there. [clears throat]
[47:49] uh
[47:50] holding up this banner.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; The fourth chapter of James, we're just
[47:57] going to start to read at the at the
[47:59] 13th verse.
[48:03] And we'll read down to verse 17, the end
[48:06] of the chapter. go to now or we would
[48:09] say come now. You that say today or
[48:13] tomorrow we will go into such a city and
[48:16] continue there a year and buy and sell
[48:20] and get gain. Whereas you know not what
[48:24] shall be on the tomorrow. [music] For
[48:26] what is your life? It is even a vapor
[48:29] that appearth for a little time and then
[48:32] vanishth away.
[48:34] For that you ought to say, "If the Lord
[48:37] will, we shall live and do this or
[48:41] that." But now ye rejoice in your
[48:43] boastings, all such rejoicing is evil.
[48:47] Therefore, to him that knoweth to do
[48:50] good, and doeth it not, to him it is
[48:53] sin. And I want you to especially notice
[48:56] the first two verses and especially 14.
[48:59] Whereas you know not what shall be on
[49:02] the tomorrow. For what is your life? It
[49:04] is even as a vapor that appearth for a
[49:06] little time and then vanishth away. You
[49:08] may be seated and keep your Bibles handy
[49:12] if you would please because I have a
[49:14] number of other scriptures we want to be
[49:16] looking at. I want to speak on your
[49:18] future
[49:20] and because it's a very we have a very
[49:23] youthful church.
[49:25] Very youthful church. I go to some
[49:26] churches and all we see is uh
[49:29] gray-haired and white-haired and
[49:31] bald-headed people and all across the
[49:34] whole congregation. We come here and and
[49:36] the gray-haired and uh bald-headed and
[49:39] uh uh and the white-haired and all the
[49:42] rest of it can't even get a seat
[49:44] &gt;&gt; down close to the front. And I've
[49:46] noticed that quite a few have gotten
[49:48] displaced. And so we have uh naturally
[49:51] the younger a person is the more future
[49:54] they feel that they have and the more
[49:56] interest they have in the future and the
[49:59] more long range plans that they have.
[50:03] But I I like to title the message
[50:05] tonight that Jesus Christ is our future.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; I want to say very very quickly and I'll
[50:12] be making some statements that you can
[50:14] write down and keep. There are things
[50:17] coming up in your future that you did
[50:20] not expect
[50:22] for sure. There are things coming up in
[50:26] your future that are going to uh this is
[50:29] for all of us but especially our young
[50:32] people. There are things coming up in
[50:33] our future that not only did we not
[50:36] expect but we're not prepared for in our
[50:39] in our own mind in our own strength.
[50:42] We're not prepared for it. And that is
[50:45] why uh things come up in people's
[50:47] future. I'm talking about believers
[50:49] future that sets them on their head.
[50:52] Turns them right upside down. And they
[50:54] said, "I never expected this." There are
[50:58] things which come up in people's future
[51:01] that only not only did they not expect
[51:03] and not only were they illprepared for
[51:06] but it simply and and not only does it
[51:08] turn them upside down but there are
[51:10] things that come up in people's future
[51:12] that turns them away from the path of
[51:14] life and that is the most tragic thing
[51:17] and I would hate to think I would just
[51:20] really dislike thinking I should put it
[51:22] that way that we would have within a
[51:25] congregation like this that we would
[51:27] have uh the prospects of such a thing
[51:30] happening but it does happen. And it
[51:32] happens to be the real world. And there
[51:34] are things that come up and people they
[51:37] you can say throw in the towel or they
[51:40] just turn their back on God or they just
[51:42] become completely despondent or I don't
[51:45] know for what all the reasons are but
[51:47] there's a whole multitude of reasons and
[51:49] they do because we've been here a long
[51:51] time and we've seen people and I've seen
[51:53] people turn out of the path of life for
[51:56] the most nonsensical thing.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; You have too. You said, "Where's so and
[52:03] so? Where's so and so?" Well, well, what
[52:06] did they go for? Well, I don't know what
[52:07] they went for, but they some of them
[52:09] went for pleasure. Some of them went for
[52:10] a job. Some of them went for an
[52:12] education. Some of them went for this.
[52:13] Some went for money. Some went for had
[52:15] all kinds of things. And some probably
[52:17] don't even know what they went for. Some
[52:19] said, "Well, I prayed and God didn't
[52:20] answer." Uh or or you know, or or God
[52:24] did this or God did that. Or they blame
[52:26] the preacher or blame the church or
[52:28] blame somebody. And you know that's just
[52:30] exactly the way it happens.
[52:33] And you want to in fact is uh when the
[52:36] little fellas were up here singing, I've
[52:39] got my heart set right. I've got my I've
[52:41] got my mind I've got my mind made up.
[52:44] I've got my heart set right. Right at
[52:46] that moment while they were singing that
[52:49] I had on the computer resolved
[52:53] resolved
[52:54] and being determined. And the Bible is
[52:57] full of it. And there's one person who
[53:00] was many that were resolved. All of them
[53:02] were resolved in the Bible. But like
[53:04] Apostle Paul said, even when he knew he
[53:07] was going to Jerusalem and he knew what
[53:10] because it had already been prophesied,
[53:12] he knew what was facing him. It had been
[53:14] prophesied what was facing him. He knew
[53:17] there was bonds coming. And a man has
[53:20] been beaten by rods and beaten by
[53:23] stripes and been shipwrecked on the
[53:25] ocean and had been in hunger, had been
[53:27] in nakedness, had suffered all of these
[53:30] things. He knew it wasn't going to be
[53:32] blissful. He knew it was trouble that
[53:34] was coming. But he said, "None of these
[53:37] things move me.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; None of these things move me." So God
[53:42] had alerted him and informed him what
[53:44] his future was. But he said, "I have" He
[53:47] wasn't concerned about the future
[53:49] because he wasn't looking for easy
[53:51] street.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; He was just looking for the perfect will
[53:55] of God. And so, we're not here tonight
[53:58] to look up for easy street or to look up
[54:00] something, you know, that is well, if
[54:02] God blesses me, that's not the point.
[54:05] The point is that we're resolved
[54:07] whatever God decides to do.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; So future in the encyclopedia says it is
[54:17] the future is the time yet to come.
[54:20] You might wonder why I look up some of
[54:22] these things because there there there
[54:25] is depths in its meaning that we es
[54:27] escape us and are just our normal
[54:29] English language.
[54:31] Our future is the time yet to come. But
[54:34] specifically,
[54:35] specifically, the encyclopedia says it's
[54:38] the state of the soul after death. And I
[54:41] really was thankful they had those two
[54:44] statements. But in the second statement,
[54:46] they came right to the point.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Number one, it is the time yet to come.
[54:52] It's tomorrow. It's five minutes from
[54:53] now. It's next week. It's next month.
[54:56] It's next year. But specifically, it's
[54:59] what happens after death.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; That's specifically,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; That's your future.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And we do have an appointment. And the
[55:08] appointment is it is appointed
[55:12] &gt;&gt; on a man
[55:13] &gt;&gt; once to die
[55:15] &gt;&gt; and after that the judgment. Well, if we
[55:18] don't die, we go in the rapture. We're
[55:21] looking for the rapture. If you're not
[55:23] raptured, one thing is certain. We're
[55:25] going to go by either by rapture or by
[55:27] way of the death. And of course, and
[55:30] then after this, the judgment. Well, we
[55:33] know that Christ was judged for us. But
[55:36] we don't want to be elusive about that
[55:38] subject because uh some say, well, how
[55:41] the message teaches Christ was judged
[55:44] for us that he was. You won't pay for
[55:46] your sins. He paid it all. There's not a
[55:48] thing that is there. But we will be
[55:50] judged for how we how we conducted
[55:52] ourselves and what we did with what God
[55:54] gave us as servants of Christ, as
[55:57] disciples of Christ. And we want to uh
[56:00] we want to be diligent about those
[56:02] things. We want to be diligent about the
[56:04] decisions that we have made. And uh I
[56:07] I'm moving forward with the young people
[56:09] as well in the service. But it applies
[56:11] to all of us. We want to be diligent
[56:13] with what God has given to us. Don't you
[56:15] not agree with that?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Everyone,
[56:21] I believe, is keenly interested in their
[56:23] in their future.
[56:25] And the question is, what does my future
[56:28] hold for me?
[56:31] Some people I find every newspaper, some
[56:33] people religiously read [music]
[56:36] the
[56:39] horoscope.
[56:41] You see how I've worded that? The horror
[56:44] scope.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I had to even think about it to try and
[56:49] say it right. I've been saying horoscope
[56:50] for so long that I had trouble trying to
[56:53] say it correct according to the
[56:55] according to the newspaper
[56:58] and um and for many it turns out to be a
[57:00] horoscope. All right.
[57:04] The horoscope is the aspect of the
[57:06] heavens with special reference to the
[57:10] positions of the planets at any instant
[57:13] from which astrologers profess to
[57:15] foretell the future especially of a
[57:19] person born at that time. Now, you
[57:22] remember brother Brandham got on a bus
[57:25] &gt;&gt; and he's standing right beside a sailor
[57:29] and he just kind of felt you you felt
[57:33] the same sometime. You just kind of felt
[57:34] strange and and you don't maybe know
[57:37] why. Maybe you never do find out why.
[57:40] Maybe someone's presence that you're in
[57:42] or maybe a situation that you're facing.
[57:45] But he was on this bus standing there
[57:48] and uh I believe he was a game warden at
[57:51] the time uh young man and this woman
[57:56] heavy set large woman looking right
[57:59] straight hard at him said I'd like to
[58:01] speak to you said do you know that
[58:03] you're a gifted person he said I I don't
[58:05] want none of that I he didn't want to
[58:07] hear any of that and this woman then
[58:10] told him you've been born under a sign
[58:12] and there's a when three planets three
[58:14] planets planets came into line when
[58:17] Jesus was born. And every time those
[58:20] planets line up, then God in in in
[58:23] remembrance of that sends a special gift
[58:25] to the earth. And you were born under
[58:27] those same three planets. He didn't want
[58:29] to have anything to do with it. He
[58:30] didn't want to hear. He said, "Tell and
[58:32] she said, I I'll tell you I'll tell you
[58:35] the day that you were born." And she
[58:38] gave him the date and the hour he was
[58:40] born by because she was a student of the
[58:44] planets. And uh he says tell the sailor
[58:47] when he was born said I can't. Now you
[58:51] know he didn't want to hear anything
[58:53] about that and we don't believe in
[58:54] astrology and we don't believe in
[58:56] horoscopes and we don't believe in all
[58:58] that stuff. Nevertheless, we do believe
[59:00] we were born at a certain season when
[59:03] God had the planets. He had the stars.
[59:04] He had everything right in place. And
[59:07] it's amazing. We may think we may never
[59:09] know of it in this world, in this life.
[59:12] I don't expect that we will. But just to
[59:14] think, I I would far sooner believe that
[59:17] than to believe I just came here by an
[59:19] accident.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I just dropped in. God knew nothing
[59:23] about me. God's got all this whole
[59:25] planetary system all going up there and
[59:27] all the stars and everything's in
[59:28] absolute precision and and it is so
[59:31] inexhaustible that man can't find it. He
[59:33] can't discover it. He's trying to
[59:35] discover it. And to think that that kind
[59:37] of God who is so infinite has has a son
[59:40] and a daughter born here on earth and
[59:43] and they just happen to arrive. No, I
[59:45] don't believe that. I believe he had
[59:47] absolutely everything in perfect
[59:49] harmony. And he knows exactly when you
[59:51] were born. He knows exactly that you're
[59:53] here right now. And he knows precisely
[59:55] what there is in store for you in the
[59:57] future. And he's the only one who knows.
[1:00:01] And the only assurance that you and I
[1:00:03] can have that that the future will be I
[1:00:07] won't say it be okay for us but and I
[1:00:10] won't say that it'll be easy for us but
[1:00:12] the only way that we know that the
[1:00:14] future will be as it ought to be and
[1:00:17] spiritually rewarding is that we see our
[1:00:21] future in Christ which is the word of
[1:00:24] God. And it it's much deeper than we can
[1:00:27] possibly even touch on tonight.
[1:00:30] all kinds there's all kinds of things
[1:00:32] and they uh and all nations and all
[1:00:35] peoples they always interested and in
[1:00:38] intrigued with the future and that's why
[1:00:40] they have you know fortune tellers and
[1:00:42] in China they have I think what they
[1:00:44] call the yin-yang and uh I know they
[1:00:46] also have a uh uh fortune telling sticks
[1:00:50] special sticks and there's 78 sticks and
[1:00:53] they have uh some some person knows how
[1:00:56] to handle them and supposed to be we
[1:00:57] don't believe in trying to peer into the
[1:01:00] future. But I can tell you one thing,
[1:01:02] the you cannot take the future out of
[1:01:05] the scripture.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; This Bible is absolutely full of the
[1:01:08] future. And it happens to be your
[1:01:10] future. And my future, the future of
[1:01:13] every believer and the future of the
[1:01:16] unbeliever and the future of the
[1:01:18] makebeliever
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; is all here in the scripture.
[1:01:24] Now, in preparation for our lives,
[1:01:28] we get an education,
[1:01:31] for our future,
[1:01:34] get a job for our future. We raise
[1:01:38] families because we anticipate a future.
[1:01:40] We instruct our children, and we
[1:01:43] instruct them to look ahead. Farmers
[1:01:46] plant a crop. Businessmen make
[1:01:49] investments. And they we instruct all of
[1:01:53] our uh those that are around us. We
[1:01:56] expect that they will look a look uh to
[1:01:58] the future, look ahead. And throughout
[1:02:00] our working years, people plan for uh a
[1:02:04] future or perhaps a retirement or
[1:02:06] whatever more
[1:02:08] all plans all plans somewhere along the
[1:02:12] line if Jesus Christ is not included
[1:02:15] will fail.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; And more people are finding, I would say
[1:02:20] more people's plans fail than plans that
[1:02:24] are fulfilled.
[1:02:26] How many people plan for just a glorious
[1:02:30] and absolutely ecstatic marriage and
[1:02:33] wedding and future and all the rest of
[1:02:36] it? And if you took a uh took a analysis
[1:02:40] of it, it is less than what they thought
[1:02:42] it was going to be when they stood at
[1:02:43] the altar. It's not the same thing. I
[1:02:45] know you're quiet now, but that happens
[1:02:47] to be the truth because because we have
[1:02:50] such great anticipations, but yet they
[1:02:53] fall short many times that and the
[1:02:56] anticipation is a uh our pursuit of
[1:02:59] things in the future.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; See, and then falls and spiritually. So,
[1:03:05] you know, a lot of you young men, young
[1:03:07] ladies, you you know, you just come with
[1:03:09] such a surge of energy and all the rest
[1:03:11] of it. But that's why resolve is
[1:03:14] absolutely essential because then it
[1:03:17] doesn't matter what the future is
[1:03:20] actually bringing you. You've resolved
[1:03:22] to serve God and you don't care whether
[1:03:24] it's up or down or backwards or inside
[1:03:27] out or whether it's good times or bad
[1:03:29] times. I I came I resolved I gave my
[1:03:32] life to God. I don't even have it
[1:03:34] anymore.
[1:03:36] Brother Donaldson put a $10 bill up here
[1:03:39] and somebody who wasn't got it.
[1:03:43] I I I thought that
[1:03:46] I thought someone else got it, but I
[1:03:48] couldn't see you from where I was
[1:03:49] sitting. She said, "My wife said, "No,
[1:03:51] no." One of the young boys got up there
[1:03:54] and got it. Well, now instead of instead
[1:03:57] of putting a $10 bill down there, put
[1:03:59] your life down there.
[1:04:03] You didn't give it back to Brother
[1:04:04] Donaldson, did you? No. You're smiling
[1:04:07] real big. You put in the bank.
[1:04:10] All right. And when you put your life
[1:04:12] there now, not a $10 bill, but you lay
[1:04:15] your life on the altar and say, "I'm not
[1:04:18] mine anymore. I give up everything." And
[1:04:21] the Lord comes and snatches that and
[1:04:23] says, "You're mine."
[1:04:25] And you never take it back. You'll never
[1:04:27] get it back because it's now his. That's
[1:04:30] the kind of surrender I'm talking about.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not mine anymore.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; My life is not my own.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price and we
[1:04:43] are not our own.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And whatever he determines
[1:04:47] to do, WE SAY, "THY WILL BE DONE, oh
[1:04:50] God, on earth as it is in heaven. Do
[1:04:53] with me as you see fit." And then when
[1:04:55] you come with that kind of resolve and
[1:04:57] that's the same today and tomorrow and
[1:05:00] this week and next week and you just go
[1:05:02] steady and straight. I know I've been
[1:05:04] saying these things. I've been making
[1:05:06] reference to these things but that
[1:05:08] happens to be a foundation stone without
[1:05:11] that it's in out up down good day bad
[1:05:15] day. But when you are resolved it a good
[1:05:18] day or a bad day is all the same day. It
[1:05:21] doesn't make one scratch of difference
[1:05:23] to God and it should not make one
[1:05:25] scratch of difference to us what kind of
[1:05:27] a day it is. Everything goes backwards.
[1:05:30] It's going to you got to expect that.
[1:05:33] That's life.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But when we think about the future,
[1:05:39] you know, usually we're thinking about
[1:05:41] uh you know things that we've prepared
[1:05:43] for and and uh we we expect uh good
[1:05:47] things to happen. I would like you to
[1:05:50] take your Bible now, please, and we're
[1:05:51] going to turn to Matthew the 6th
[1:05:53] chapter,
[1:05:55] starting at verse 25.
[1:06:00] [clears throat]
[1:06:02] [snorts]
[1:06:08] All right. Therefore, what I'll do, I'll
[1:06:12] read the I'll read verse 25, you read
[1:06:14] verse 26, and then we'll alternate.
[1:06:16] Therefore I say unto you, notice now th
[1:06:20] this phrase, take no thought for your
[1:06:22] life, what you shall eat or what you
[1:06:25] shall drink, nor yet for your body, what
[1:06:28] you shall put on. Is not the life more
[1:06:31] than meat, and the body than
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; raignnt
[1:06:46] Are you not much better than they?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Are you not much better than they?
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And the people said, "Yes."
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Which of you by taking thought, There we
[1:06:56] have it again, can add one cubit onto
[1:07:00] his stature.
[1:07:11] And yet I say unto you that even Solomon
[1:07:15] in all his glory was not a raid like one
[1:07:18] of these.
[1:07:33] Therefore, take no thought, saying,
[1:07:35] "What shall we eat, or what shall we
[1:07:37] drink, or wherewithal shall we be
[1:07:39] clothed?"
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; But seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[1:07:52] and his righteousness, and all these
[1:07:54] things shall be added unto you.
[1:08:07] I want to read the dialot for the last
[1:08:10] verse. Take take therefore no thought.
[1:08:14] The digot, the original cre says, "Be
[1:08:17] not anxious then about the moral
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; for the moral will claim anxiety for
[1:08:23] itself.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Sufficient for each day is its own
[1:08:28] trouble."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that perfect? Now, that puts the
[1:08:33] right kind of slant on it. Be not
[1:08:35] anxious then about the moral, for the
[1:08:39] moral will claim anxiety for itself.
[1:08:43] Don't borrow today the anxiety from
[1:08:46] tomorrow because when tomorrow arrives,
[1:08:48] you'll have sufficient anxiety tomorrow.
[1:08:51] So don't borrow it now and and bear it
[1:08:54] now. You'll have enough tomorrow.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Sufficient for each day is its own
[1:09:02] trouble. You might say, "Well, we didn't
[1:09:03] come to church tonight, uh, Brother Ed,
[1:09:05] to hear that." But that happens to be
[1:09:07] the reality. you will have a certain
[1:09:10] portion of anxiety tomorrow and you'll
[1:09:12] have enough for tomorrow. So, we won't
[1:09:14] borrow any from tomorrow for today.
[1:09:18] And then what Paul or rather what Jesus
[1:09:21] is speaking of here when he said and I'
[1:09:24] I'd like you to just notice please in
[1:09:26] the 25th verse he said take uh take no
[1:09:31] thought for your life.
[1:09:36] 28th verse he asks why take ye thought
[1:09:40] for arignment and so on. The 31st verse
[1:09:44] he said therefore take no thought
[1:09:48] and the 34th verse take therefore no
[1:09:52] thought. Say you know which of you by
[1:09:55] taking a thought you can add anything to
[1:09:57] your stature. No.
[1:10:00] And why take a thought therefore take no
[1:10:03] thought. And what Jesus is saying
[1:10:06] because the word thought is to have care
[1:10:09] or to be anxious to be troubled with
[1:10:13] cares. To be troubled with cares. This
[1:10:16] happens to be friends in this age is a
[1:10:19] plague.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; It's a plague. It's not one just
[1:10:22] touching, you know, the odd one here,
[1:10:24] the odd one there. It's like a blanket
[1:10:26] that covers us all. and and and and some
[1:10:29] perhaps more than others, but there's a
[1:10:31] anxious concern. To be anxious or to be
[1:10:34] troubled with cares or to look out for a
[1:10:37] thing, it's something that's on your
[1:10:39] mind. It's something that you're
[1:10:40] concerned with. Well, naturally, we have
[1:10:43] to be concerned. The other side of this
[1:10:45] is the the Bible tells us to be
[1:10:47] diligent. The Bible tells us to serve
[1:10:49] our employers with singleness of mind,
[1:10:52] singleness of eye. The Bible tells us
[1:10:54] that if we don't work, we don't eat. The
[1:10:57] Bible tells us all of those things, but
[1:10:59] this is taking it further. This is a
[1:11:02] anxious care, anxiety, and Jesus is
[1:11:06] saying, don't take any thought. Don't be
[1:11:08] anxious and and and filled with concern
[1:11:12] and troubled in your mind over tomorrow
[1:11:15] or over how I'm going to do this or
[1:11:17] what's going to be in the future because
[1:11:20] he doesn't want us to take. He says,
[1:11:22] "Take not thought. Why take thought?
[1:11:25] Which of you can by uh can can by taking
[1:11:29] thought can add your stature? We there
[1:11:31] are in other words we cannot achieve or
[1:11:35] accomplish what our objective is by all
[1:11:39] of this anxious concern anyway.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And it is this kind of thing that Jesus
[1:11:46] is referring to in another scripture
[1:11:49] in Mark 4:14. if you'd like to turn to
[1:11:52] it
[1:11:56] because he's speaking about the swer in
[1:11:59] the 14th verse Mark 4:14 the serth the
[1:12:04] seed and these are they by the wayside
[1:12:08] which the word where where the word is
[1:12:10] sown but when they have heard Satan
[1:12:14] cometh immediately and taketh away the
[1:12:17] word that was sown in their hearts Now,
[1:12:21] when we read this, you can just give me
[1:12:23] your attention for a few moments. When
[1:12:24] we read this, we've had a lot of
[1:12:27] marvelous and powerful preaching just
[1:12:30] over the last few weeks. I will say that
[1:12:32] there is on a continual basis. This seed
[1:12:36] of this message is being sown in the
[1:12:39] hearts of the people. And I feel it
[1:12:41] tonight. I need to alert you and to
[1:12:44] remind others and to bring it to your
[1:12:47] remembrance
[1:12:49] that Satan is standing ready and by to
[1:12:53] steal that word
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; and have you forget it instead of
[1:12:58] pondering on it. And then he would far
[1:13:01] sooner have you distracted over here and
[1:13:03] become all wrapped up and concerned
[1:13:06] about something and have anxiety about
[1:13:08] your life or about your future and about
[1:13:10] this that you don't have control over
[1:13:12] anyway. Not that we shouldn't prepare
[1:13:14] for it. Prepare for it and and do what
[1:13:16] you can that way. But we're living each
[1:13:19] day each day without the anxiety,
[1:13:23] without the fretting, without the
[1:13:25] turmoil, without the troubled mind.
[1:13:28] Because that troubled mind is actually
[1:13:30] displacing the very mind that God wants
[1:13:33] and needs for your spiritual life.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's exactly true. I told you this is
[1:13:41] kind of, you know, going to be meat and
[1:13:42] potatoes, but we need that once in a
[1:13:44] while.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And so we don't take the he said that
[1:13:49] the the enemy Satan cometh immediately.
[1:13:54] Verse 15. And taketh away the word that
[1:13:58] was sown in their hearts.
[1:14:00] And these are they likewise which are
[1:14:03] sown on stony ground who when they have
[1:14:06] heard the word immediately received it
[1:14:08] with gladness. And I would say there are
[1:14:11] that everyone has received the word with
[1:14:13] gladness. And that still doesn't deter
[1:14:15] the enemy.
[1:14:18] They have and have no root in
[1:14:20] themselves. And so they endure, but for
[1:14:22] a short time afterward when affliction,
[1:14:26] they didn't expect it.
[1:14:29] And persecution ariseth that was in
[1:14:32] their future, but when they were hearing
[1:14:33] the word and oh, THEY WERE SO ECSTATIC.
[1:14:36] They were receiving the word and they
[1:14:37] were just on such joy and excitement and
[1:14:39] all the rest of it. Oh, we're here at
[1:14:40] camp or we're here in a meeting or we're
[1:14:42] we just had a glorious service and I'm
[1:14:45] just so GRIPPED WITH THE OH what the
[1:14:47] pastor preached or what the special
[1:14:49] speaker spoke or one of the other
[1:14:51] ministers and we're just so moved by it.
[1:14:55] You have to make certain that it's not
[1:14:56] just moved in the emotional realm. It
[1:14:58] has to be something in the that drops
[1:15:00] down to the soul. When you hear
[1:15:02] something that enthuses and excites you,
[1:15:05] I'm going to give you some advice right
[1:15:06] now. You say and just take exactly what
[1:15:09] the prophet has said. You're a triune
[1:15:10] being and say, "Oh, God, don't leave
[1:15:13] that. Don't leave it just in my mind.
[1:15:15] Satan will take it." Don't leave it in
[1:15:17] my emotional realm because my emotions
[1:15:19] will change by tomorrow morning. But let
[1:15:22] it drop down to my soul. Let the seed
[1:15:26] come down to my soul. And once it is
[1:15:29] dropped there, it's anchored there
[1:15:31] forever. Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] And if you're not a new creature in
[1:15:35] Christ Jesus, you will become one. If
[1:15:37] you're not filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:38] you will be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:40] When that word, if you take that pattern
[1:15:42] and you come to a service even like this
[1:15:44] and walk out of these doors, maybe we
[1:15:46] don't have an altar call, you're not
[1:15:47] prayed for and all of those things.
[1:15:49] That's fine. You walk out. You don't
[1:15:51] need that. You just walk out of these
[1:15:52] doors. You say, "Father, I know
[1:15:55] according to the word, my eternal body
[1:15:58] was calling for this for this nutrition
[1:16:00] tonight. the spiritual vitamins that I
[1:16:03] received tonight. I needed that and
[1:16:05] that's why I was there. Don't let me
[1:16:07] just be excited. Don't let me just be
[1:16:09] enthused. Don't let me just say amen. I
[1:16:12] I'm asking THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT will
[1:16:14] take that word and drop it from the womb
[1:16:16] of my mind down into my soul. I will
[1:16:19] respect it.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; I will love it.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; I will cherish that word. I will ponder
[1:16:25] upon it. I'll put a note in my Bible.
[1:16:28] I'll read these verses again so I can
[1:16:31] see
[1:16:32] this person here never expected the
[1:16:35] affliction and the persecution. But when
[1:16:38] you have resolved then it doesn't make
[1:16:40] any difference. Then the next day
[1:16:42] persecution comes.
[1:16:44] Well, if it doesn't come down to the
[1:16:46] soul and you say, "Oh, I was just I I
[1:16:49] was expecting a great time. I thought
[1:16:50] we're going to have this old time. I
[1:16:52] didn't expect this. They're calling me
[1:16:53] all kinds of names or saying all kinds
[1:16:55] of nasty things or or the place that I
[1:16:57] work. This thing's going backwards. This
[1:16:59] is going sideways. I never expected
[1:17:01] that. Of course not. But we don't know
[1:17:04] our future.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; If you had never if you never even said
[1:17:08] yes to God, you still wouldn't know the
[1:17:10] future.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; So, isn't it better to trust him?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And we'll go on now [clears throat]
[1:17:19] verse 17. and had no roots in
[1:17:20] themselves, and so endure for a short
[1:17:22] time afterward, when affliction or
[1:17:24] persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
[1:17:27] immediately they are offended. And these
[1:17:30] are they which are sown among thorns,
[1:17:32] such as hear the word, and the cares of
[1:17:35] this world. Here we are now, that same
[1:17:37] word, the cares of this world. This
[1:17:41] world is filled with cares. And I want
[1:17:44] to rise up against those cares because
[1:17:47] they're destructive to your spiritual
[1:17:49] life and mine.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; They're a tool in Satan's hand.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Your cares,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; my cares. We all have them. And this
[1:18:00] world is is plagued with cares, one kind
[1:18:04] or another. There's something. Now, just
[1:18:06] assess it in your own mind. What what
[1:18:08] what consumes your thought? What
[1:18:11] occupies? And those things that cause us
[1:18:14] to be anxious about things that is
[1:18:18] actually robbing us of the time that God
[1:18:21] would like to take the word and instill
[1:18:23] it into us to give us faith to deal with
[1:18:26] that anxious time.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; It's not that the anxious time won't be
[1:18:31] there. Did you follow me? Did you follow
[1:18:33] that? I'm not saying that we're not
[1:18:35] going to have anxious time. I'm not
[1:18:37] saying that you're supposed to ignore
[1:18:39] it. I'm saying is that Satan uses he
[1:18:42] uses the cares and the the anxieties of
[1:18:46] life to displace the time that God wants
[1:18:50] for you as a believer so that you can so
[1:18:53] that you can contemplate and meditate
[1:18:56] and have time in the word and have time
[1:18:59] to to just uh be in the presence of God.
[1:19:02] You can be in your work. You can be
[1:19:04] amongst your duties. You can be as busy
[1:19:06] as can be, but your time, your thoughts
[1:19:08] are given over. You're not allowing this
[1:19:10] anxiety to to conquer you. And then God
[1:19:14] strengthens you so you can deal with
[1:19:16] that anxiety the way it ought to be.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's the order of the day of the
[1:19:21] believer's life.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And the cares of this world and the
[1:19:31] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[1:19:34] other things entering in choke the word
[1:19:38] and it becometh unfruitful. In other
[1:19:41] words, it actually came to be fruitful
[1:19:42] state but becomes unfruitful. And verse
[1:19:45] 20, and these are they which are sown on
[1:19:48] good ground, such as hear the word and
[1:19:51] receive it, and bring forth fruit, some
[1:19:54] 30fold, some 60fold, some 100fold.
[1:20:02] And the cares of this world. Now uh I
[1:20:04] was just looking in um a writer has said
[1:20:08] this about
[1:20:10] the cares of this world. anxious
[1:20:13] unreaxing attention to the business of
[1:20:16] this present life. That was what they
[1:20:18] set out as the cares of this world. Then
[1:20:21] the deceitfulness of riches of those
[1:20:24] riches which are the fruit of this
[1:20:25] worldly care. So there all kinds of
[1:20:28] anxious care about life etc. And then we
[1:20:32] reap some benefits from it. That's what
[1:20:34] keeps the person going. You reap natural
[1:20:37] benefits from the cares of this life.
[1:20:41] But he said of those riches which are
[1:20:44] the fruit of this worldly care, the
[1:20:47] pleasures of life or the lust of other
[1:20:49] things entering in. And I thought this
[1:20:52] paragraph was very, very good. I'd like
[1:20:53] you to just hear it as I read it. The
[1:20:56] enjoyments in themselves may be
[1:20:59] innocent, the pleasures of life, the
[1:21:02] enjoyments may be innocent, which
[1:21:06] worldly prosperity enables one to
[1:21:08] indulge in.
[1:21:10] In other words, the prosperity of life.
[1:21:13] Person has an anxious cares and they're
[1:21:15] we're in a rat race in this world and it
[1:21:18] has its it has its benefits. Satan has
[1:21:21] made sure it's got some perks
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; and that keeps a person going. Hey, I
[1:21:26] can tell you some of these big
[1:21:27] corporations that are very very
[1:21:29] successful, you know how they keep their
[1:21:30] you know how they keep their men and
[1:21:32] keep them burned out? Giving them perks.
[1:21:34] Perks. Perks.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; They got such wonderful perks.
[1:21:39] you know, if if I don't keep, you know,
[1:21:41] if I don't keep just exhausting myself,
[1:21:43] I don't get these perks.
[1:21:50] Hey,
[1:21:52] I was talking to a young man and he was
[1:21:55] just burning himself up. He was working
[1:21:56] 12 hours a day, every day except Sunday.
[1:21:59] 12 hours a day, every day except Sunday.
[1:22:04] But he was they were barely paying him
[1:22:06] enough to keep body and soul together.
[1:22:09] And they just had one child and just
[1:22:11] barely enough to keep paying the bills.
[1:22:15] But the car he drove was such a
[1:22:17] luxurious SUV. You know, thought, man, I
[1:22:22] can't afford to give this up. I give
[1:22:23] this up, I lose this SUV.
[1:22:25] So, I just got to keep serving this
[1:22:28] beast.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I just got to keep serving it because I
[1:22:32] got this. And not only that, when I
[1:22:34] travel, I stay at the nicest hotels
[1:22:36] and eat good food. And man, I hate to
[1:22:39] lose all those perks. You you kind of
[1:22:42] get used to it, you know, walking in the
[1:22:46] five-star hotel, you know, and fivestar
[1:22:49] room and feels nice. And to think if I
[1:22:52] if I get out of this, I'm back down to
[1:22:54] three stars
[1:22:58] or I'm just down to, you know, I can't
[1:23:01] afford this at all. So they they
[1:23:03] actually keep you going. And how and and
[1:23:05] so what did those perks do? They kept a
[1:23:08] man just grinding it out 12 hours a day
[1:23:11] going home just totally exhausted.
[1:23:14] hardly any time for the wife and hardly
[1:23:16] any time for the for the kid, you know,
[1:23:19] and you know, you're just totally
[1:23:20] exhausted. And by the time you drive to
[1:23:22] work, maybe half an hour or an hour and
[1:23:25] drive away back from work, that 12 hours
[1:23:28] is 14. And by the time you eat, it's 15.
[1:23:32] And by that time, you are dead
[1:23:34] exhausted. And they'd say, "Oh, that's
[1:23:36] just four days." No, that is this week
[1:23:38] and next week and this month and next
[1:23:41] month and in six months. And then they
[1:23:42] say these perks are six months from now
[1:23:45] we're going to make you manager. And
[1:23:46] like they said, you know, that is so you
[1:23:48] can go from up eight hours a day to work
[1:23:50] 12 hours a day to when you get to be
[1:23:52] manager.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's subtle.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Sunday, you pray for me. I want to speak
[1:24:00] on the system.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; The system. And these systems become
[1:24:06] gods.
[1:24:08] and they bow before them and they they
[1:24:11] burn up their life for them. And I
[1:24:12] better stop right there. I'm going to be
[1:24:14] be giving all the thunder away for
[1:24:16] Sunday's service.
[1:24:18] The system, the religious system.
[1:24:24] Seal my mouth right now cuz you're
[1:24:27] perceptive people. You're going to say,
[1:24:28] "Oh, we know what he's going to preach."
[1:24:32] So the enjoyments themselves may be
[1:24:34] innocent which worldly prosperity
[1:24:36] enables one to indulge. These choke or
[1:24:40] smother the word, drawing off as much of
[1:24:43] one's attention, absorbing so much of
[1:24:46] one's interest and using up so much of
[1:24:49] one's time that only the drags uh the
[1:24:52] drags of these remain for spiritual
[1:24:55] things.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Only the dregs remain for spiritual
[1:24:58] things. And a ragged, hurried and
[1:25:02] heartless formalism is at is at length
[1:25:05] all the religion of such a person. Just
[1:25:08] a heartless uh a rather a ragged,
[1:25:12] hurried and heartless formalism.
[1:25:16] What a vivid picture of today.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; It always gets quiet when we touch these
[1:25:21] things because we're all touched on it.
[1:25:23] And you can't escape when the prophet
[1:25:25] said the pressure of this age. We have
[1:25:28] that pressure and and it's not because
[1:25:30] you want that pressure. It's because the
[1:25:34] age has that pressure.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; There's nobody here who voted to pay $3
[1:25:40] a gallon for their gas and here it's
[1:25:42] about five.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Who wanted that?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay the kind of, you know,
[1:25:49] price for a roof over your head?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay the kind of taxes you
[1:25:54] pay I pay? Who wants to pay that? No,
[1:25:58] you didn't. You didn't try to you didn't
[1:26:00] vote for that. But that's the age you
[1:26:02] live in and that's the country you live
[1:26:05] in. It just happens to be that way. And
[1:26:07] we're caught in that web.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And so if Satan can, he catches us in
[1:26:13] that web. And so it used to be that if
[1:26:16] you had a grade eight education, you're
[1:26:18] well educated. Very few had a grade
[1:26:21] eight education. Then it was you got to
[1:26:23] have 12 or you're not getting anywhere.
[1:26:25] And you got to have your grade 12 uh
[1:26:27] diploma. And so when I when I was in
[1:26:30] school, that was important thing to have
[1:26:32] a grade 12 diploma. Today they just turn
[1:26:34] their nose up say, "Well, I graduated
[1:26:36] out of grade 12." They want to know what
[1:26:38] further education and the college and
[1:26:41] university and whatever more and what
[1:26:43] degrees and whatever more and and I
[1:26:45] think that that's very very important in
[1:26:47] these times. But that must never become
[1:26:49] a god. Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to have said, "Well, I
[1:26:55] served I served with all my strength and
[1:26:58] all my energy on a material level and
[1:27:02] had nothing but drags left for spiritual
[1:27:05] things. I'm talking to a lot of young
[1:27:08] people here. I would like you to set a
[1:27:10] course in your life that would guarantee
[1:27:13] that God would have first place that he
[1:27:17] will have quality time in your life.
[1:27:20] Maybe at the expense of some pleasure,
[1:27:22] maybe at the expense of something else.
[1:27:24] I don't know. But at at least that God
[1:27:28] and I don't believe that when I stand on
[1:27:29] the other side, I will have to
[1:27:33] apologize for preaching this message
[1:27:35] tonight.
[1:27:37] I don't believe I'll have to apologize
[1:27:39] for in for just really laying it on the
[1:27:43] line [clears throat]
[1:27:45] and uh so that you'd have some guidance
[1:27:51] now. And here's what brother Brandham
[1:27:54] said in the Thotyron church age.
[1:27:57] He said, "A great burden of this
[1:27:59] [clears throat] last age." And I know
[1:28:00] that some of you that are here, of
[1:28:02] course, as real students of the message,
[1:28:05] you've heard these things many times.
[1:28:07] But remember, I'm saying them not
[1:28:08] because I don't think that we've got
[1:28:10] them. I enjoy reading it. I enjoy
[1:28:13] preaching it. Again, I enjoy
[1:28:16] being able to lay it out so that the
[1:28:19] young men and the young ladies will have
[1:28:21] this as pillars in their spiritual life.
[1:28:24] Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; A great burden and it's in the Thotyron
[1:28:28] church age. You want to make a note. 239
[1:28:31] page 239 church ages. A great burden of
[1:28:34] this last age is the pressure of riches.
[1:28:37] Now, some would say the great burden of
[1:28:39] this last age is riches. That's not what
[1:28:41] it is. The great burden of this last age
[1:28:44] is the pressure of riches. And as I said
[1:28:46] a moment ago, it's not us who designed
[1:28:49] and desired an economy that is costing
[1:28:52] so much for rent. and so much for food
[1:28:55] and and all of these things going up up
[1:28:57] up and naturally your salary has to go
[1:28:59] up. It is a treadmill that every living
[1:29:02] person who's you know in the system
[1:29:05] they're they're on that and they've got
[1:29:06] to have a certain amount and a father
[1:29:09] who has uh children all the rest of it
[1:29:11] and believers of the message. You talk
[1:29:13] about a pressure
[1:29:17] where our our statistics here in Canada,
[1:29:22] which was released not very long ago,
[1:29:24] proved that here in this area, a two
[1:29:28] wage earning family cannot keep their
[1:29:31] head above water.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; A two wage earning family. And here we
[1:29:37] are,
[1:29:39] I'll say for the most part,
[1:29:41] husbands, one wage earner in a family.
[1:29:46] And I say to God's glory,
[1:29:49] doing better.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; When you talk about doing good, doing
[1:29:53] better than those that are burning it up
[1:29:56] at both ends of the candle, husband,
[1:29:59] wife working, kids cast to the
[1:30:01] television or cast to the mall or
[1:30:03] wherever they're cast to. It's a whole
[1:30:05] lot better with a one-way jourer in the
[1:30:09] in the family according to the prophet's
[1:30:11] message, according to the word of God.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] [clears throat]
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to say also because I know
[1:30:22] there's such an eagerness for spiritual
[1:30:24] things, I'll say to all of our young
[1:30:26] people, don't be anxious over your
[1:30:29] spiritual growth or your spiritual
[1:30:32] advancement. Don't be anxious over
[1:30:35] spiritual things so that they're a worry
[1:30:37] and a care and a concern. Just trust the
[1:30:39] God you gave your life to. I'm yours.
[1:30:42] You take me as far as you want. You show
[1:30:44] me whatever you want me to see. You
[1:30:46] reveal yourself to me, but I will hunger
[1:30:49] and thirst after you.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let that be the pattern of
[1:30:54] your life.
[1:30:58] Now, [clears throat]
[1:30:59] I'll tell you something else. I I
[1:31:01] believe that these little things are
[1:31:02] such lessons for us in brother
[1:31:04] Brandham's life and I take them and I
[1:31:05] observe them and they're so excellent.
[1:31:09] Now
[1:31:11] he felt this you know God dealing with
[1:31:14] him in his in his capacity which is you
[1:31:18] know as a as a prophet with a message
[1:31:21] for the world. But you have your own
[1:31:24] corner, you have your own place. I have
[1:31:27] mine. You have yours. And we we will
[1:31:30] have a
[1:31:32] uh we won't understand.
[1:31:35] Listen to me now. We will not understand
[1:31:38] all of God's dealings with within
[1:31:42] yourself. You won't understand it
[1:31:44] always.
[1:31:45] God God's leadings are sometimes very
[1:31:48] mysterious.
[1:31:50] Brother Brandham even said to his wife,
[1:31:53] he said to Sister Mey, "I can't stand
[1:31:55] this anymore.
[1:31:57] I I'm I'm leaving here. I'm going up
[1:32:01] into to my cabin or up to my cave. I'm
[1:32:04] going I'm going to get away and I got to
[1:32:07] get an answer and I won't be back till I
[1:32:10] get the answer.
[1:32:13] Now, what what is he talking about? He's
[1:32:15] he was talking about his future. He knew
[1:32:18] that, you know, somehow God was dealing
[1:32:20] with him, but he didn't know what it was
[1:32:23] going to come to. He didn't know what
[1:32:25] the future was in his spiritual life.
[1:32:29] Now you can just you can stay and just
[1:32:32] stew about it and and but you but he did
[1:32:34] the right thing and that is the pattern.
[1:32:37] He just got alone with God. God God by
[1:32:39] himself said I'm going to I'm going to
[1:32:41] find out from God what this is all
[1:32:43] about. I can't go any further because
[1:32:46] he'd wondered about it for a long time.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I hope this meaning something to you.
[1:32:59] Now, God does not tell us everything
[1:33:03] about our future.
[1:33:08] Yet, he promises us a future that you
[1:33:11] would not trade for anything else.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily an easy
[1:33:20] future, but a fulfilled future.
[1:33:24] These are chosen sentences.
[1:33:28] You want to remember them.
[1:33:30] The more future you have, the more
[1:33:33] reason you have to be keen and have a
[1:33:35] keen interest in it.
[1:33:38] The will of God and the leading of the
[1:33:41] Holy Spirit in that plan can often be a
[1:33:44] great mystery
[1:33:46] and it will be.
[1:33:49] People make plans, have short-term and
[1:33:52] long-term objectives that do not have
[1:33:55] Jesus Christ at the center of their
[1:33:57] plans.
[1:33:59] The world is filled with bitter
[1:34:02] disappointment. And those kinds of plans
[1:34:05] will end up in disappointment.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; The bornagain believer has Christ at the
[1:34:12] very heart and center of their plans and
[1:34:15] never are disappointed.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Will there be no
[1:34:20] disappointment?" There will be things
[1:34:22] happen that you never planned.
[1:34:25] But when you've made Christ the center
[1:34:27] of your plans and he is the objective in
[1:34:32] everything that you do, then whether
[1:34:34] it's a whether whatever kind of reversal
[1:34:37] or whatever happens, I'm trying to tell
[1:34:40] you friends, there are things which will
[1:34:42] pain you. There are things which will
[1:34:44] bring sorrow to you. There are things
[1:34:45] which will grieve you. But I will say
[1:34:48] that some of my greatest griefs have
[1:34:51] come from what I know the Holy Spirit is
[1:34:55] grieved with.
[1:34:57] And if you have that kind of grief, I
[1:35:00] say to you, go
[1:35:04] and bear it
[1:35:06] thankfully that you can bear some of his
[1:35:09] stripes
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; and you can bear some of his grief. And
[1:35:13] if the Holy Spirit is grieved and you
[1:35:14] are a possessor of the Holy Spirit and
[1:35:17] you are a temple of the Holy Spirit and
[1:35:19] the Holy Spirit becomes grieved about
[1:35:21] something, let me tell you something.
[1:35:23] You're going to feel it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to experience it. You're
[1:35:27] going to have it. And when you do have
[1:35:29] it, you won't want to escape it. YOU
[1:35:30] WON'T SAY, "OH, GOD, TAKE THIS AWAY from
[1:35:32] me." And you WON'T SAY, "GOD, IS THIS
[1:35:35] YOU OR IS THIS a devil?" I have all
[1:35:37] kinds of people. I hear it all the time,
[1:35:39] Brother Biscell. I don't know whether
[1:35:41] this is God or this is the devil. Well,
[1:35:43] when a person's life is totally focused
[1:35:47] on Christ and he is the center of
[1:35:50] everything, you will know that it is for
[1:35:53] Christ's sake, whatever it might be. And
[1:35:55] it may not be good because Christ didn't
[1:35:57] suffer everything good. He didn't I
[1:35:59] mean, he didn't experience everything
[1:36:00] that was good. Now, God spoke through
[1:36:04] Jeremiah.
[1:36:06] If you want to write it down, it's the
[1:36:08] 29th chapter of Jeremiah.
[1:36:11] And he said to Jeremiah through
[1:36:12] Jeremiah, thus saith the Lord of hosts,
[1:36:15] the God of Israel, unto all that are
[1:36:17] carried away captives. Now, how many
[1:36:20] knows what he's talking about? He's
[1:36:21] talking about Israel carried away into
[1:36:24] Babylon for 70 years.
[1:36:27] And so the Lord is speaking to all that
[1:36:31] were carried away captives whom I've
[1:36:33] caused to be carried away from Jerusalem
[1:36:34] unto Babylon. And here's what he's
[1:36:37] telling them to do. Build houses, dwell
[1:36:40] in them, plant gardens, and eat the
[1:36:43] fruit of them. Take your wives. In other
[1:36:45] words, don't stop getting married. Get
[1:36:48] married and beget sons and daughters.
[1:36:51] and take wives for your sons and give
[1:36:54] your daughters to husbands that they may
[1:36:56] bear sons and daughters that you may be
[1:36:58] increased there and not diminished. This
[1:37:00] was the instruction. What's he doing?
[1:37:03] He's telling them their future.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Get a house. Live in a house. I'm not
[1:37:08] telling you that. I'm telling that's
[1:37:10] what God spoke to them. Do it. And seek
[1:37:13] the peace of the city whether I have
[1:37:14] caused you to be carried away captives.
[1:37:17] And pray unto the Lord for it. For in
[1:37:20] the peace thereof, shall you have peace.
[1:37:23] For thus sayith the Lord of hosts, the
[1:37:25] God of Israel, let not your prophets and
[1:37:28] your divers, what are they? Fortune
[1:37:30] tellers. Prophets and divers. Don't let
[1:37:35] them that be in the midst of you deceive
[1:37:38] you, neither hearken to their dreams,
[1:37:41] which and neither hearken to your dreams
[1:37:44] which ye cause to be dreamed. He said,
[1:37:47] "Don't listen to the prophets and the
[1:37:49] divers who were speaking contrary to the
[1:37:52] word that was coming from the prophet.
[1:37:55] Don't listen to it." You know, there's
[1:37:56] all kinds of voices. Let me say this.
[1:37:58] There's more voices against the message
[1:38:01] than there is for it. And a lot of those
[1:38:03] voices and influence come right from
[1:38:06] within a church. Right within the
[1:38:08] message. They give all kinds of
[1:38:10] instruction and all kinds of and tell
[1:38:12] you about you know what your future is
[1:38:14] or you know and they don't put it that
[1:38:16] way that I'm going to tell you your
[1:38:17] future. I'm a fortune teller. I'm a
[1:38:19] diver. I'm a I'm a prophet or a
[1:38:21] prophetess. They don't but all kinds of
[1:38:23] advice you know and all kinds of counsel
[1:38:26] which actually is reaching into your
[1:38:28] future to shape your life to how you're
[1:38:31] going to serve God and and all of these
[1:38:33] things. And then what happens is
[1:38:37] the outcome isn't what you expected it
[1:38:41] to be. And furthermore, furthermore, he
[1:38:44] says he said here and and neither
[1:38:47] hearken to your dreams. Everybody has a
[1:38:50] dream.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Everyone has an expectation. He said
[1:38:54] which you cause to be dreamed. And and
[1:38:57] the individual themselves, they had an
[1:38:59] aspiration. They had an expectation for
[1:39:02] a certain thing. And he and he and don't
[1:39:04] trust those dreams.
[1:39:06] Don't trust them. Just trust exactly
[1:39:09] what the word and the word alone has
[1:39:11] said.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You know, you're here on a Wednesday
[1:39:15] night and there's always a very
[1:39:17] wonderful audience on a Wednesday night.
[1:39:19] You're here not to put in some time. You
[1:39:22] have left other things undone to come
[1:39:25] here. you have left uh valuable time,
[1:39:28] quality time you could have had with the
[1:39:30] family or doing something productive or
[1:39:33] or or or maybe some of you could have
[1:39:35] got some work done and you could have
[1:39:37] made some extra cash by by uh being away
[1:39:40] and working, but you're here in church
[1:39:42] and the reason you're here is because
[1:39:44] you want to make this a focal point in
[1:39:47] your spiritual life and you have and
[1:39:49] you've done that and that's why God will
[1:39:51] honor you.
[1:39:55] But we have our dreams and our
[1:39:57] aspirations. They must come subject to
[1:40:00] the word of God. And he said, "For they
[1:40:03] prophesy falsely unto you in my name. I
[1:40:06] have not sent them, saith the Lord. For
[1:40:09] thus saith the Lord, that after 70 years
[1:40:12] be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit
[1:40:15] you and perform my good word toward you
[1:40:18] in causing you to return to this place.
[1:40:22] for I know. And brother Brandham takes
[1:40:24] this scripture. You can if you have a
[1:40:27] computer system, you can look it up. But
[1:40:30] he said this was a lovely thought. And
[1:40:32] he and God says, "For I know the
[1:40:35] thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth
[1:40:38] the Lord, thoughts of peace and not
[1:40:41] evil, to give you an expected end." God
[1:40:46] is actually prophesying, I'm going to
[1:40:48] give you an expected end. And the
[1:40:52] expected end here, the word what he's
[1:40:54] using, it is a I will give you a a hope.
[1:40:58] I will give you an expectation. I will
[1:41:02] give you an outcome. I like to say to
[1:41:04] the congregation tonight, I'm not
[1:41:06] interested in anybody else's outcome for
[1:41:08] my life. None of my family. They
[1:41:12] probably wish the very best for me. And
[1:41:14] you got and and I know in a congregation
[1:41:17] you you think the best. You say, "Oh, we
[1:41:19] just wish you'll just have a prosperous
[1:41:21] and a happy and a joyfilled and a
[1:41:24] healthy life and all that." And I say,
[1:41:25] "Amen." Amen. Amen. I I hope all of
[1:41:28] those things. But the real future that I
[1:41:30] want is held in his hands.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; I want his future.
[1:41:37] You want his future. And we don't know
[1:41:41] what it is, but the consecrated life
[1:41:44] will have his future unfolded in your
[1:41:48] life.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; And he says to give you an expected end.
[1:41:54] In other words, to give you a hope or to
[1:41:58] give you his outcome, to give you
[1:42:02] something that you will wait and look
[1:42:04] eagerly for. And this is wonderful.
[1:42:07] You remember when Rahab put the cord in
[1:42:10] the window? What color was it?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Scarlet, a scarlet cord, a token. Says,
[1:42:17] "Give me a token." Says, "You put the
[1:42:19] cord in the window." And the exact word
[1:42:23] that God uses in the Bible for your
[1:42:26] expectation is the exact word for the
[1:42:29] line, the cord in Rahab's window. When
[1:42:33] she looked in that window, she had an
[1:42:35] expectation.
[1:42:37] She had a hope. And her hope and her
[1:42:40] expectation did not come from the city
[1:42:43] she lived in. It didn't come from her
[1:42:46] family. It came right out of the very
[1:42:49] out of the very source of Israel. The
[1:42:51] word of God came to her and gave her a
[1:42:54] token. YOU WILL REMAIN AND ALL THAT IS
[1:42:57] UNDER this roof shall be saved. Oh,
[1:43:00] isn't that a wonderful thing? Yeah.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And she could go to the window
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; and see that line there. You know what
[1:43:07] that line was? You know what that
[1:43:09] scarlet cord was? Was God's thought
[1:43:12] concerning her.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; God's thought concerning everyone who
[1:43:17] would be in that house. That cord was a
[1:43:21] token or a promise of God. That was a
[1:43:24] sign OF GOD'S PROMISE to her.
[1:43:27] Hallelujah.
[1:43:29] AND GOD IS SAYING TO us that I have
[1:43:32] given you an expected END. I'VE GIVEN
[1:43:36] YOU. I have given you. And there has
[1:43:38] never been a people that I know of.
[1:43:40] There's been no people throughout this
[1:43:42] 2,000 years of church ages that has had
[1:43:45] such an authorative VINDICATED VOICE
[1:43:49] THAT HAS GIVEN US A PROMISE HAS GIVEN US
[1:43:51] A PROMISE OF a rapture of a a OF AN
[1:43:54] ETERNAL LIFE AND ETERNAL body and a a a
[1:43:58] change of this body. God has given us
[1:44:01] that in this day.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, it's in the Bible."
[1:44:05] That's absolutely right. But I'm talking
[1:44:07] it's been pinpointed now. It's been
[1:44:09] specified. It's been designated to a
[1:44:12] certain people. THIS JUST ISN'T
[1:44:14] SOMETHING THAT'S OUT there for THE WHOLE
[1:44:16] WORLD. NOW HE SENDS A VOICE. NOW HE
[1:44:19] SENDS A MESSAGE AND SAYS IT'S FOR THESE
[1:44:22] PEOPLE.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I'VE GIVEN YOU AN EXPECTED END.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING YOU CAN LOOK AT AND EVERY TIME
[1:44:30] YOU LOOK AT IT SAY THERE IS MY HOPE AND
[1:44:34] THERE IS MY FUTURE. IT DOESN'T LAY
[1:44:37] ANYWHERE ELSE.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IN MY SCHOOL. IT'S NOT IN MY
[1:44:41] EDUCATION. IT'S NOT IN MY JOB. IT'S NOT
[1:44:44] IN MY RAISE. IT'S NOT IN MY PROFESSION.
[1:44:47] THIS EXPECTATION IS HERE IN THE WORD OF
[1:44:50] GOD. AND MY FUTURE IS IN THE WORD.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And that's when Joshua
[1:45:00] sent word and she said, "According unto
[1:45:03] your words, so be it." And she sent them
[1:45:06] away and departed. And she bound the
[1:45:10] scarlet expectation.
[1:45:14] The word is line. She bound the scarlet
[1:45:17] hope in her window. SHE BOUND THE
[1:45:21] SCARLET PROMISE IN HER WINDOW.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; OH, I love it that way. The same word. I
[1:45:27] WILL GIVE YOU an expectation. This was
[1:45:30] this was Rahab's back there.
[1:45:33] The people in Babylon had Jeremiah's
[1:45:36] words and we have a prophet's words. WE
[1:45:40] HAVE BROTHER BRANDON'S WORDS.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just end here in a moment.
[1:45:48] Just bear with me. The hope or
[1:45:50] expectation is from God. And that is why
[1:45:53] the psalmist David said, "My soul
[1:45:57] wait thou only upon God." Now, have you
[1:46:00] ever talked to yourself?
[1:46:04] I do all the time. So, you do? Is that
[1:46:07] where these messages come from? No. But
[1:46:10] I talk to myself all the time. David
[1:46:12] talked to himself.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "My soul,
[1:46:16] wait thou upon God, for my expectation
[1:46:19] is from him." Yeah.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; So, you walk down the street tomorrow
[1:46:23] and all the people are around there and
[1:46:25] looking at you and you just say to
[1:46:27] yourself and you're all by yourself, "My
[1:46:29] soul, WAIT THOU UPON GOD FOR MY
[1:46:31] EXPECTATIONS from him." They're going to
[1:46:34] take a side glance at you. Say,
[1:46:42] "Okay, here now here's your future.
[1:46:46] The promises of God's people are even
[1:46:49] more valid now than they were. And I'm
[1:46:52] taking these out of out of the Bible.
[1:46:55] I'll tell you in a moment where it's
[1:46:56] from
[1:47:00] now. Therefore, go
[1:47:03] and I will go. Let me ask you a
[1:47:05] question. If I can read this out of the
[1:47:07] Old Testament, do you not think it's
[1:47:09] valid for you right now? Even more so
[1:47:11] than it was there. more so today under
[1:47:15] grace than it is under law. Far more so.
[1:47:19] Far more potent.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; That was a shadow. Now this is the that
[1:47:23] was the negative. Now it's the positive.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Now therefore GO AND I WILL GO WITH THY
[1:47:32] mouth and teach thee what thou shalt
[1:47:34] say.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Your future,
[1:47:37] my people, your future
[1:47:40] involves you saying something.
[1:47:43] Your future involves you as a witness
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; because that is YOUR WHOLE PURPOSE OF
[1:47:50] BEING HERE AND YOU SHALL BE WITNESSES
[1:47:53] UNTO ME.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; What is it I should say? I pray with
[1:47:57] people regularly. I'm going I'm going to
[1:47:59] visit my relatives. We're going to see
[1:48:01] unsaved friends. Pray with me so I'll
[1:48:04] know what to say. AND I TELL THEM, God
[1:48:07] may give you something to say and he may
[1:48:10] have you be silent.
[1:48:12] He may have you preach it in your
[1:48:15] action.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; HE MAY HAVE YOU JUST DEMONSTRATE THE
[1:48:18] VERY CHRIST THAT'S IN YOU.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WILL SPEAK LOUDER THAN EVEN
[1:48:22] YOUR WORDS MANY TIMES. AND IF HE HAS YOU
[1:48:25] SAY SOMETHING, MAY IT BE CHOICE WORDS
[1:48:28] SENT BY THE HOLY SPIRIT FROM THE VERY
[1:48:31] THRONE OF GOD TO THE VERY HEART OF THE
[1:48:33] PEOPLE OF THE hearer of the word. AND HE
[1:48:36] GAVE A PROMISE. I'LL BE WITH YOUR MOUTH.
[1:48:38] AND I FELT INSPIRED tonight to give this
[1:48:40] to you, especially young men and young
[1:48:43] women, but to all THIS CONGREGATION.
[1:48:45] GOD'S PROMISE to us, I'll be with your
[1:48:48] mouth and I will TEACH YOU WHAT TO SAY.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN YOUR FUTURE.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; That might be yet tonight,
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; but it's in your future.
[1:49:02] AND HE SAYS, "AND THOU SHALT SPEAK."
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THOU SHALT
[1:49:09] BECAUSE THAT'S NOT YOU HAVE but you will
[1:49:13] you shall speak
[1:49:17] and then he says
[1:49:20] he he gave some statements concerning
[1:49:22] thou shalt said thou shalt say thou
[1:49:26] shalt stand thou shalt know that I am
[1:49:30] the Lord. Those three are powerful. And
[1:49:33] I say, God, let that be in my future. I
[1:49:37] claim that FOR MYSELF. THOU SHALT SAY,
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T SOME FALSE divination now.
[1:49:46] This isn't some false prophecy. This is
[1:49:49] the truth of GOD'S WORD. YOU SHALL
[1:49:52] SPEAK.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL SAY IT.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SHALL BE WITH YOUR MOUTH. AND HE
[1:49:59] SHALL TEACH YOU WHAT TO SAY, and thou
[1:50:02] shalt know that I am the Lord. Oh, bless
[1:50:06] his name.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; AND I'M TAKING THAT NOW FOR MYSELF. THIS
[1:50:11] NEXT ONE, AND THOU shalt teach them
[1:50:13] ordinances and laws. Thou shalt show
[1:50:17] them the way wherein they must walk and
[1:50:19] the work that they must do. There's
[1:50:22] something for us to do.
[1:50:25] And he says, "If thou shalt do this
[1:50:28] thing, and God commanded thee so, then
[1:50:32] thou shalt be able to endure."
[1:50:37] I'm saying to every person here tonight,
[1:50:39] thou shalt, this is your future.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt be able to endure.
[1:50:49] I've been down the road a long ways
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; and I've seen
[1:50:55] elder elder men
[1:50:58] even in the message I've seen them what
[1:51:02] I would say become entangled in a way
[1:51:06] that to me brought a great deal of
[1:51:08] sadness.
[1:51:10] I certainly wouldn't want that. I've
[1:51:12] seen young people do it. I've seen young
[1:51:16] people turn aside. And I'm pressing this
[1:51:18] I'm pressing this point real hard. I say
[1:51:20] to you in the name of the Lord, don't
[1:51:22] you turn aside.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You stay the course.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've been hearing you
[1:51:27] say that, Brother Biscll, and I'm going
[1:51:28] to continue to say it." You stay the
[1:51:30] course. You be resolved and say, "I am
[1:51:33] resolved and nothing can change my
[1:51:35] mind." And you speak it because when you
[1:51:38] speak it, the devil hears it.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything change that.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah. I've lived long enough. I've
[1:51:47] seen people go through sickness. Go
[1:51:50] through a tremendous amount of sickness.
[1:51:54] We were visiting I see our sister
[1:51:56] Slagger here. God bless her. A mother of
[1:52:00] Sister Marge Miller. And we were with
[1:52:02] Sister Marge. Uh I've I've spoken about
[1:52:06] her several times here, but
[1:52:10] my wife and I spent with uh Sister Sleer
[1:52:14] and uh and Sister Patricia Drake and
[1:52:18] Sister Shauna Grunard. We were all there
[1:52:21] together
[1:52:22] and and here's this woman. Sister Marge
[1:52:26] has been afflicted off and on
[1:52:29] and uh I believe since 1991.
[1:52:32] That's about 14 years. 14 years. And she
[1:52:36] says to me, "Read some scripture.
[1:52:40] Read some scripture." And she's reaching
[1:52:43] her little slim thin body ravished by
[1:52:47] this cancer. And really, I don't know
[1:52:50] why.
[1:52:51] Well, I don't know why that thing even
[1:52:53] is there. and she's wanting me to reach
[1:52:55] for her Bible to looking for it. And I
[1:52:57] find her Bible, big heavy Bible. I bring
[1:52:59] it out. I start to read some scripture
[1:53:02] and the presence of God comes in the
[1:53:04] room and and and there she is laying in
[1:53:07] this bed, what they would call, as far
[1:53:09] as the world is concerned, in the final
[1:53:11] stages of cancer. And she raises her
[1:53:14] little slim bony hands to the air and
[1:53:18] begins to worship God and worship God
[1:53:20] and worship God. I say friends, my
[1:53:23] brother, my sister, we haven't got a
[1:53:25] thing in the world to claim to complain
[1:53:27] about. We haven't got a thing in the
[1:53:29] world. And not one time, not one time
[1:53:34] does a does a negative thing come out of
[1:53:36] her mouth.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; A shame to a lot of people. We should
[1:53:41] not have that. And just I was leaving
[1:53:43] the other day, I just was slipping away
[1:53:46] and we were just getting ready to go and
[1:53:47] I just touched I said, "Sister Marge, is
[1:53:51] there anything we can do for you?" And
[1:53:53] those dark eyes flashed at that word
[1:53:57] just flashed. She said, "Yes.
[1:54:00] Yes, there is.
[1:54:02] Pray for my two sons."
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] after all those years.
[1:54:12] That is what I'm telling you tonight is
[1:54:15] a Christ centered [snorts] life.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; There's no self-pity.
[1:54:22] There's no, oh, pity me.
[1:54:25] Can I do anything? And she wasn't
[1:54:27] thinking of herself. Not one word for
[1:54:30] me. Don't do anything for me. Pray for
[1:54:33] my two sons.
[1:54:36] And I made her that promise
[1:54:39] said, "I will pray for them and I have
[1:54:42] been from that time."
[1:54:48] And whether God allows her,
[1:54:51] do you think I'd be surprised she walked
[1:54:53] through those doors right now? Not one
[1:54:55] twit.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I'll be surprised if she
[1:54:58] doesn't come to church.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; I fully expect it. Fully expect it. Not
[1:55:03] at all. It's not my stubborn mind. I
[1:55:05] just fully expect it.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; She's too young to go.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; But here's a woman and I can tell you if
[1:55:11] God takes her home, it'll be like
[1:55:13] someone said, "The good ones go and the
[1:55:16] bad ones stay."
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; I have seen people go, Brother Chris,
[1:55:22] Brother Ernie, young people, I've seen
[1:55:24] them go. And you know, when they were
[1:55:26] done, I had to speak over their coffin.
[1:55:29] And you know what was going on in my
[1:55:30] heart? They were too good to stay,
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; They were just too good to stay. And God
[1:55:37] said, "I'm not going to leave them there
[1:55:38] anymore. I want them."
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Saying to the world, "You've had them
[1:55:42] long enough. I want them. I want them
[1:55:45] right with me in my kingdom."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; We don't understand those kind of
[1:55:49] things, but that is exactly what
[1:55:51] happens.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; God takes them.
[1:55:59] And I close with this. Brother Brandham
[1:56:02] says,
[1:56:04] "Faith doesn't look at the present."
[1:56:09] Faith doesn't see this here.
[1:56:13] Faith looks to see what God wants.
[1:56:18] He says, "And works accordingly." That's
[1:56:20] what faith does. It sees what God wants
[1:56:24] and what God wants done. And faith
[1:56:26] operates through that.
[1:56:31] Listen everyone now. Faith has long
[1:56:33] range vision.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't lower its sight. It holds to
[1:56:39] the target. Any good shooter knows that.
[1:56:42] He said that it it's long range. It's a
[1:56:45] telescope. It's a binocular that you
[1:56:47] don't look around here. You don't use
[1:56:50] binoculars to look to see what time it
[1:56:52] is on your watch. You don't look
[1:56:54] binoculars to see what time it is on
[1:56:56] your watch.
[1:56:58] He said you don't use it for that, but
[1:57:00] you use binoculars to look way off. And
[1:57:04] faith does that. [clears throat] Faith
[1:57:06] picks up God's binoculars, both of them,
[1:57:08] both sides, the New and the Old
[1:57:11] Testament. And tonight, I went into the
[1:57:13] New and the Old Testament, so you could
[1:57:16] take the binoculars of God's word and
[1:57:18] look up into not my future, not your
[1:57:21] neighbor's future, but your future.
[1:57:24] And when you look up there, you want to
[1:57:26] see at every station in your life, I see
[1:57:28] Christ. I see the word right at the
[1:57:31] center of my life. I don't see anything
[1:57:33] else. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I'VE PLACED MY
[1:57:35] LIFE. I'm looking at those promises. AND
[1:57:37] WHEN HE SAYS, "THOU SHALT," I SAY, "I
[1:57:39] WILL."
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; THOU SHALT do this. THOU SHALT SPEAK. I
[1:57:42] WILL SPEAK. THOU SHALT know the LORD THY
[1:57:45] GOD. I will know the Lord my God. THOU
[1:57:47] SHALT MOUNT UP WITH WINGS AS EAGLES. I
[1:57:50] will mount up with wings as eagles.
[1:57:55] and every promise that he made and faith
[1:57:57] sees it out yonder and faith chooses
[1:58:01] that regardless of what the present
[1:58:04] tense says here.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Faith chooses that
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; out there.
[1:58:13] Hallelujah.
[1:58:15] If I look just
[1:58:17] right around us and if you looked right
[1:58:20] around us, that wouldn't give us the
[1:58:22] inspiration to press on the upward way.
[1:58:28] We have a guiding light guiding us. And
[1:58:31] I want the musicians to come. And while
[1:58:33] they're coming, if you'll bow your head
[1:58:35] with me.
[1:58:38] Oh, how
[1:58:41] Father, you're so gracious to us. and
[1:58:46] for this uh evening Lord this Wednesday
[1:58:48] evening as we have spoken and touched on
[1:58:53] just briefly as briefly as it was on the
[1:58:57] future the people the future of their
[1:58:59] homes the future their lives the future
[1:59:02] of these young people the future oh God
[1:59:04] that you have planned and programmed for
[1:59:07] us the future of what is to take place
[1:59:10] in the earth and oh God whether it's
[1:59:14] good times or bad times
[1:59:16] Whether it is uh uh whether it is joyful
[1:59:18] times or times of sorrow, we do not
[1:59:20] know. But we say, "I am thine, O Lord,
[1:59:23] and I've heard thy voice and I've give
[1:59:25] myself entirely to you." In the name of
[1:59:29] Jesus Christ, I ask that these words
[1:59:31] will linger long in the hearts of the
[1:59:33] people. It's been spoken for that
[1:59:35] purpose. And we thank you now in Jesus
[1:59:39] name. Amen.
[1:59:42] Now, [clears throat] just before we come
[1:59:44] to a close,
[1:59:48] I'm sure there's maybe any one of our
[1:59:51] young men here that would if I said,
[1:59:54] "Would you like to be Peter?" Apostle
[1:59:56] Peter. You think about Peter? Or if I
[1:59:59] said, "Would you like to be Apostle
[2:00:00] Paul?" Oh my. If I could just be Apostle
[2:00:05] Paul. If I could just be Peter.
[2:00:08] Well, those are two that I chose. Jesus
[2:00:11] told the fortune of both of them the
[2:00:13] future.
[2:00:16] And he says to Peter, "When you were
[2:00:19] young, you just went wherever you wanted
[2:00:22] to go.
[2:00:24] When you're old,"
[2:00:26] so he knew [music] just from that
[2:00:28] statement, he was going to get to be
[2:00:29] old.
[2:00:31] When you're old,
[2:00:33] they'll carry you where you would not
[2:00:36] want to go.
[2:00:38] So he knew that something was going to
[2:00:40] take place with them and tradition says
[2:00:43] brother Brham also confirms [music] it
[2:00:46] that they crucif he he said they didn't
[2:00:48] want to be crucified the way his wife
[2:00:50] his way his lord was crucified and so
[2:00:52] they crucified him upside down
[2:00:56] but that was his future and can you just
[2:00:59] imagine can you imagine now living every
[2:01:01] day of his life
[2:01:05] I got this in my future here. When I was
[2:01:08] young, I just went wherever I wanted to
[2:01:10] go. I went with all my friends. I did I
[2:01:13] did I went fishing. I did all of these
[2:01:14] things when I was young. What I have in
[2:01:17] my future is they're going to take me.
[2:01:20] Somebody's going to pack me where I
[2:01:22] don't want to go.
[2:01:24] But that is what Jesus said. And so,
[2:01:26] [music] you know what my if he made
[2:01:29] here's my whole service. If he made
[2:01:31] Jesus Christ the center of his life,
[2:01:34] [music] then he could say, "Somebody's
[2:01:36] going to take me where I don't want to
[2:01:38] go, but yet I want to go there because
[2:01:41] he said I was going to go there."
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul, he's blind. He's just
[2:01:50] been smitten down by THIS GREAT LIGHT.
[2:01:52] WHO ART THOU, LORD? I'M JESUS, whom thou
[2:01:55] persecutest. It's hard for thee to kick
[2:01:57] against the pricks.
[2:02:00] and they send him into the into the
[2:02:02] [music] city and God speaks to Ananas
[2:02:06] that he comes
[2:02:08] and pray for him and says, "Show him. I
[2:02:12] will show him what great things he will
[2:02:14] [music] suffer for me." Those are two
[2:02:16] things. We're we're not in a real
[2:02:19] suffering age. We uh it's not an age
[2:02:23] that's really uh dedicated to that.
[2:02:25] [music] But I believe that the believers
[2:02:27] of this message are going to have
[2:02:29] greater squeezes yet.
[2:02:32] We have plenty of squeezes now, but we
[2:02:34] going to have more squeezes yet. Do you
[2:02:36] know that what you believe, what you
[2:02:39] believe deep down in your heart and
[2:02:41] what's written in this word of God and
[2:02:43] written in this message is so foreign to
[2:02:46] this age. It is absolutely foreign
[2:02:48] language to this age. And the position
[2:02:51] that you have on things is considered
[2:02:53] abs. In fact, his brother Donaldson was
[2:02:55] just telling me he said, "You know this
[2:02:57] message?" He said, "Uh uh, I was called
[2:03:00] by a minister
[2:03:02] when we talked about how ladies live and
[2:03:04] how women of the message dress." You
[2:03:07] know, the pastor said, "You people are
[2:03:09] idiots."
[2:03:11] That's really what people think. They
[2:03:14] think they think it's very, very
[2:03:16] strange. They think it's absolutely
[2:03:18] strange. They think it's wild.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; They think it's insane. True.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; In fact, it's just turned completely
[2:03:25] around because the insanity is on the
[2:03:28] streets. And here, can you imagine that
[2:03:30] people with such nakedness and such
[2:03:33] debauchery and such sin that's taking
[2:03:35] place and murders and rape and all of
[2:03:38] these things and turn around and look at
[2:03:39] believers and say, "You're crazy."
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; How the things turn from that which is
[2:03:44] clean completely to the unclean.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And that which is clean, they call
[2:03:48] unclean. That which is unclean they call
[2:03:51] clean. That which is unclean they call
[2:03:53] normal.
[2:03:56] We live in a very abnormal age and this
[2:03:58] is not a this is not a negative message
[2:04:00] but that happens to be the reality. And
[2:04:02] so I'm talking to you about your future
[2:04:05] and it is going to intensify.
[2:04:08] If this would be the LAST MESSAGE I'D
[2:04:10] PREACH, you'll recall this service and
[2:04:13] you'll say that's exactly right. We've
[2:04:15] been told that well you we kind of
[2:04:17] believed it but I feel I need to enforce
[2:04:19] it so that we don't have some euphoria
[2:04:22] euphoria you know about uh how things
[2:04:26] are going to be you know it may not be
[2:04:28] that way at all. It may not just be an
[2:04:31] easy street at all. It may be very very
[2:04:33] difficult times that we enter into but I
[2:04:36] say whatever it is if we've made Christ
[2:04:39] the center then then you're going to
[2:04:42] have good success.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Glory.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing uh Sister
[2:04:48] Elizabeth, I want to sing beautiful Star
[2:04:51] of Bethlehem.
[2:04:54] I don't have the [music] a number. There
[2:04:56] we are.
[2:04:59] Giving a light,
[2:05:01] guiding the wise men on their way and
[2:05:04] are guiding wise men and wise ladies
[2:05:07] today. Wise believers. [music]
[2:05:08] Let's stand, shall we?
[2:05:21] Beautiful [music]
[2:05:22] star of Bethlehem,
[2:05:25] shining a far through shadows dim,
[2:05:30] giving [music] a light for those who
[2:05:34] long have gone, [singing]
[2:05:39] guiding [music] the wise. wise men on
[2:05:42] their way out to the place [music]
[2:05:46] where Jesus laid. Oh beautiful star of
[2:05:51] Bethlehem,
[2:05:53] [music] shine [singing] on.
[2:05:58] Beautiful star [music and singing]
[2:06:02] of Bethlehem,
[2:06:07] shine [music] upon us until the glory
[2:06:12] [singing]
[2:06:13] dawn.
[2:06:16] Give us thy light [music] to light our
[2:06:20] way unto the land. A perfect day.
[2:06:25] Beautiful [music and singing] star of
[2:06:28] Bethlehem,
[2:06:30] shine on. [singing]

[2:12:52] Gracious heavenly father,
[2:12:54] we are indeed the most blessed people on
[2:12:57] this earth. Father,
[2:12:59] Lord God, you've given us another time
[2:13:02] to gather together with our brothers
[2:13:03] [music] and sisters, Lord God, around
[2:13:05] your word, Father.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord God, you must love us so
[2:13:10] much.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, time upon time upon
[2:13:14] time upon time, we've come here with
[2:13:16] thoughts upon our heart, upon our mind,
[2:13:18] Lord God, and your Holy Spirit has gone
[2:13:21] forth and just preached to each one of
[2:13:23] us individually, Lord God.
[2:13:26] Lord God,
[2:13:28] the evil one, Lord God, would love to
[2:13:30] get our eyes off of [music] you, Lord,
[2:13:32] but
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; his ws have been uncovered, Lord God.
[2:13:38] Father God, you've given your army, your
[2:13:41] soldiers, Lord God, the weapons that we
[2:13:43] need, Father, to fight the enemy, Lord
[2:13:45] God. Father God, you've given us a
[2:13:48] yielded vessel in our pastor, Lord God.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Father, [music] he knows what we have
[2:13:52] need of. You know what we have need of.
[2:13:54] You laid it upon his heart, Lord God.
[2:13:55] You set the man to the side. Your Holy
[2:13:57] Spirit has given him uncction, Lord
[2:13:58] [music] God. And Father, we've heard.
[2:14:01] We've received, Father. Now we want to
[2:14:03] manifest what we've heard, Lord.
[2:14:05] Tomorrow morning, Lord God. Tomorrow,
[2:14:07] Satan's going to hit us [music] between
[2:14:08] the eyes, Lord God. He's going to want
[2:14:10] to take our mind upon off the word that
[2:14:12] we've heard, Father. Lord God, with
[2:14:14] laser beam accuracy, Lord. Father, while
[2:14:17] it's all dropping down around us, may we
[2:14:19] keep our eye upon you, Father, upon
[2:14:21] [music] the goal, Lord God. Father, as
[2:14:23] we're going down the road, it's just
[2:14:24] telephone poles along the side, but
[2:14:26] Father, keep us upon the road, the
[2:14:28] straight and narrow road, Lord God.
[2:14:30] Father, may we go tomorrow, [music]
[2:14:32] Father, with you upon our mind, with you
[2:14:35] in our hearts, Father God, knowing that
[2:14:36] you're leading, that you're guiding,
[2:14:38] that you're guarding our every footstep,
[2:14:40] Father, you've been so wonderful, Lord
[2:14:42] God, to give us the word, Father. So
[2:14:45] much word, like so much good food.
[2:14:46] Father, the food drives us. But Lord
[2:14:49] God, your food is eternal life unto us,
[2:14:51] Lord God. your word, Father, as he
[2:14:53] strikes us tomorrow or whenever it might
[2:14:55] happen to be, Father, may that word that
[2:14:57] you've given to us in so many times that
[2:15:00] we've been in through these doors, Lord,
[2:15:02] the word that you've laid upon our
[2:15:03] heart, Lord, let us drop from our mind
[2:15:05] to our soul to be manifested, Lord God,
[2:15:08] let it be lived out through us, Father.
[2:15:11] Lord God,
[2:15:12] may our lives be a living testimony for
[2:15:15] you, Lord God. Yielded vessels for you,
[2:15:18] Father. Lord God, we thank you for the
[2:15:21] word that you've given us tonight, Lord.
[2:15:23] Father, we just don't want it to go in
[2:15:25] our ears and be gone. Father, we want to
[2:15:28] live it. We want to manifest it. We want
[2:15:30] to be it. We want to be sons and
[2:15:32] daughters in whom you're pleased to
[2:15:34] dwell in. Father, that's our desire. And
[2:15:37] like brother Derek said, Father,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; we want to be
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; that picture that you have of us that
[2:15:44] was painted. We will be [music] what you
[2:15:46] want us to be, Father. yielded vessels,
[2:15:49] yielded children of yours, Father. Lord
[2:15:52] God, now [music] as we leave this place,
[2:15:54] Father, we ask that you go with us,
[2:15:56] Father. Each and every one of us, Lord,
[2:15:58] be with us in a special way, Father. May
[2:16:00] we go praying, Father, getting ourselves
[2:16:03] prepared for Sunday morning. Yes. Sunday
[2:16:05] evening, Lord God, praying for whoever
[2:16:07] delivers the word, Lord God, coming in
[2:16:09] anticipation, Father. [music] We've just
[2:16:11] seen your word coming forth greater and
[2:16:13] greater and greater, Lord God, not only
[2:16:15] in the word coming forth, but Lord God,
[2:16:17] your word being made manifest in our
[2:16:19] lives, Father. Lord God, now [music] we
[2:16:21] just take and turn everything over into
[2:16:23] your hands again, asking that you would
[2:16:24] go with us in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:16:26] pray. Amen.

[2:16:32] and may the life of Jesus Christ be seen

[2:16:41] he'll be visible. He will be heard. He
[2:16:43] will be seen. And he'll [music] do what
[2:16:46] he always did. Stir up the people.
