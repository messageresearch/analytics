The infection is gone. What antibiotics couldn't do, our Lord could and did. And all pain is gone. All glory and praise goes to him. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you, Sister Eileen. Amen. We don't have any written prayer requests, but we do want to remember the Vineyard family that God would be a comfort to them during this time and anything else that's on your heart. And can we sing greater than all just as we prepare to go to prayer? Greater than all my sin. Oh, greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleans it is the grace. All that sets me free. Oh, to raise him. And I don't [Music] I'm walking in this sunrise. I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb. Hallelujah. Greater than all. It's greater than all my this morning.

Do you believe the blood is greater this morning? Hallelujah. It's greater still. Whatever your need might be, you say, "God, I claim the blood this morning." And I believe he's here to answer that. Amen. As brother Wes comes, why don't we just unite our hearts together in faith and believe for the impossible this morning. Amen. God bless, brother Wes. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father, Lord God, what a privilege it is, Father, to be seated in heavenly places, Lord. Father God, the unseen hand that's led us, that's guided us, that's guarded us to this moment in time, Father, we thank you, Lord God. Nothing is a surprise to you, Father. We were ordained to be here today, Father. We are ordained to hear the word that you have to bring forward to us, Father. But Lord God, our prayer is that we just not be hearers, Lord God, but we be doers, Father, that we manifest those words, those words of life, Father, that's what we want to be our testimony, Lord God. Father, we thank you for this day, Lord God. We thank you for the ministry that you brought to us, Father. Our associate ministers, Father. Lord God, Brother John and Brother Tim. Father, um, Brother Andes, Lord God, Brother Ernie, Father, just each and every one, the missionaries around in the field, Brother Tom with Brother Murphy and China, Lord God. Father, we just ask that you'd be with them, Lord God. Father, that you would bless them, Lord God. Father, that they would be a testimony, Father, that what they have to do, what they have to say, Lord God, when the word goes forth, Father, may it change lives, Father. May souls be saved, Father. Lord, we know nothing is done in vain, Father. Lord, we're casting the bread upon the water, Lord. We know it will not return void, Father. Lord, we thank you for bringing our pastor back to us, Lord God, safely, Father. Lord, we trust that he's been rejuvenated, Father. We know that he's been busy, Father. He's been studying, Father. Lord, we just ask your hand upon him now as he prepares himself to come and bring forth the word, Lord God. Father, we just ask that you would anoint him, Father. Lord, speak through him, Lord. Father, we know that he has a gift in his life, Father. We're just asking that you would just energize that gift, Father. Lord, be with each and every one of us today, Father. Lord, you've heard the you know the prayer request, Father, and you've heard the testimonies, Father. Lord, I stand here as a testimony of your miraculous healing hand, Lord God. Father, there's many, many out here in in the congregation in the audience that can attest and testify of the same thing, Lord God. Father, you are the one. You're the one that pours in the the balm of Gilead, Lord God. Only you know what each one of us has need of. Father, Lord, we think we know what the wants of our lives are, but Lord God, you know what the needs are. And Father God, we're here because this morning we recognize a need for more of your word in our life. Father, Lord God, we take and we put this service in your hands, asking that you would just touch and anoint each hearer, touch and anoint the speaker is our prayer. In Jesus Christ's lovely name we pray. Amen. [Music] God bless. You can have your seats. Amen. Praise the Lord. Who's happy to be here today? We're uh the Lord willing, we're having a couple baptisms this evening. And if there's any one else that desires baptism and would uh like to speak to myself after the service or before the evening service, uh we believe we're at the end time. It's about time to go home. So, there's no reason to delay. There's nothing to wait for. God's given a promise and we want all that he has for us. So, we look forward to that this evening for the evening service. Uh we've been just a couple announcements. Um we've been looking forward to the prayer meetings and there's uh been some announcements about it being one on the US side. So this Friday night we're having a prayer meeting on the US side at 7:30 and the Lord willing it'll be at our home. We're just on 8th Street in Blaine right across the border. And so it'll be on the back uh notice board the address and um the time 7:30. if anyone needs directions or uh you can get those by Friday night. Amen. We want to support what the Lord's doing and give you an opportunity on this side or that side of the border to be able to enter into prayer. Amen. It's so nice to see brother Michael Vineyard here this morning. And uh Sister Cindy Vineyard uh graduated into her new body on Thursday evening uh about 10:45. the body that had been wrapped by a lot of pain and suffering and gone through some years of of uh really kind of torture. She went into a new body that was leaping and jumping and and shouting on the heels of glory. And so we want to thank God for her life and for brother Michael and his family and for their uh strong testimony. Brother Michael, you mean a lot to us and we want to welcome you to the house of the Lord. For a long, long time, Brother Michael hasn't been able to travel. He's been such a caretaker for his wife. And so now is going to be a time for us in as an assembly and your the friends of brother Michael really to pour back into his life and to be with him. And it opens up a lot of uh areas of ministry for especially you brothers and families that knew the vineyard family just to call him up, spend some time. I know he likes fishing and he loves the the water and he loves to be in nature. So, fellowship is always good. So, this Friday or sorry, this Tuesday, excuse me, at the camp, we're going to be having a memorial service uh for Sister Cindy at 11:00 in the morning. uh this Tuesday morning at 11:00. I know a lot work and school, but uh if those that can and are able to come and support the vineyard family, I know it will do them a lot of good and encouragement. So, it'll be this Tuesday at 11:00 at the camp. And Sister Debbie Paris has asked that we contact her at the camp for refreshments. Uh we'd like to just if the sisters and different ones could maybe prepare some lunch items, sandwiches, uh bring some refreshments. Uh we'll just gather together after the service around 12 up in the annex and have a little time with the family. Uh some of them can't cross the border. So that's why we had it on the US side. So that'll just give us some time on Tuesday to be with brother Vineyard and the family. And we're looking forward to that. and we're looking forward to today and maybe the brothers can come. Um we'll have uh the morning offering uh the deacons could come and we'll just prepare ourselves for that and uh there's something special the Lord has for us today. I just believe the Lord has moved all of our hearts to such a time as this and we're under anticipation. So as the brothers come, let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're just so mindful of your nearness, of your presence, and what you've mean to all of us over the years. We want to thank you for your comforting spirit, Lord, and for your virtues that you pour out into our lives for salvation, for the vineyard family, brother Mike, that's here this morning. Just an undying faith, just a resilience to continue to serve you in the good times or in the bad times. We comfort him today, Lord, and express our love to them as they've been a blessing to us. And now today, Lord, as we've gathered to give our tithes and our offerings, we want to give back, Lord, what you've given to us. And we just pray that you'd multiply it as the ministry has gone around the world and even locally that you would just continue to provide all of our needs and provide for the needs of of the the bride around this globe. Lord, we're looking for your coming and we're so happy for what you're doing among us and the stir of God. And we just pray that it would continue even today, Lord, that you would move greatly within our lives. We love you, Jesus. We just dedicate this offering to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. We just want to continue to prepare our hearts for the receiving of the word this morning. So always sing blessed be blessed be your name. Oh blessed be Lord. Blessed be Oh blessed be your name. [Music] Oh, blessed be Lord. Blessed be. Oh, blessed be your name. Oh Lord, are strong and mighty tower. You, oh Lord, are a strong and mighty tower. You're an ever present help in my darkest hours. You're my hiding place for the ancient of days. You are the rock. Lord, you are worthy of my praise. Blessed be, oh Lord. Blessed be blessed be your name. Blessed be blessed be. Oh blessed be your name. You Lord are the teeth. Oh, and you, oh Lord, you are the deep that I have searched for. You're the ever flowing fountain that my heart always thirst for. You're the one who makes me whole. You're the lover of my soul and whatever. Oh, I know you're in control. So I say, "Blessed be." Oh, blessed be. Blessed be your name. [Music] Oh, blessed be. Oh, blessed be. blessings. Hallelujah. We proclaim it this morning. Let your people Let your people proclaim. Oh, we proclaim Lord that you are holy. You are holy God. And we lift up your name and give glory. We give gloryy to Hallelujah. Let your people Let your people proclaim. You are holy. Yes, you are holy God. As we lift up your name and give glory, we give gloryy to hallelujah. Sing it once more. Let your people people proclaim you are that you are holy. You are holy God and we lift up your name [Music] and give glory. [Music] We give gloryy to. Oh, singing blessed be. Oh, blessed be Lord. Blessed be, oh blessed be your name. Blessed be blessed be. Blessed be your name. We are standing. [Music] You believe it this morning? On holy ground. And I know that there are angels, hallelujah, walking up and down each aisle. Blessed be the Lord, all around. So let us praise. Oh, we praise you Lord. Oh Jesus. Now for we are standing oh in his presence on holy ground. How it once more as we turn the service to our pastor. Oh and we are standing. on holy ground. When I know that there are angels all around, oh let us pray. Oh, let us pray. Jesus, holy ground. Hallelujah. Good to be in the house of God this morning. &gt;&gt; And good to be here with some expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank you for your prayers. We've had a good rest, Sister Biscll and I. And now uh we're back in the saddle again. Uh I'm going to uh in just a few moments have you stand with me and we're going to read some scripture. But I do want to say that uh we were I was happy to get back one day early. We had to get back one day early and that's the way the flights were arranged. And we just got back and and heard of our sister Cindy's passing and um we're certainly uh thankful that we can be part of that. That's a homegoing. It is, as brother John said, a graduation. So all that can be with us on Tuesday morning out at the Bible Bible way camp, we want to be there together with the vineyard family. There is uh besides brother Michael, then there's the eldest son Daniel, his wife Sarah, and then Bob and Novani, who many of us know, and they will be there, of course. Then there are uh there are grandchildren and one great grandchild and she got to see that great grandchild before passing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And we are thankful for brother Mike and Sister Cindy's testimony. And I'll probably might say a little bit more a little later on, brother Michael, about that. Uh, isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Nice to see you, brother Sam Walder and Sister Randy. The devil tried to attack Sister Randy yesterday morning. I'm glad you're here, Sister Randy, to say to the devil and say to all the people, "God's the same." &gt;&gt; And the devil is indeed defeated. &gt;&gt; Now, we have a lot of different names for these things. and uh and and there's a lot of things that people face today that uh actually uh the doctors don't have a remedy for. There's a precious very precious brother, pastor Dystra. He has been in hospital in uh Germany. His son-in-law is pastor in uh Crayfeld, just out of Crayfeld in Dwisburg. and uh brother Pankinan wonderful wonderful brother uh and uh brother Tim Dodd was just there speaking the convention and brother Dystra was he's one of the main pastors or I'd say kind of the main pillar pastor there in in Holland and here the doctors have not been able to find out what's wrong and week and weeks and weeks and weeks and can't find out what's wrong well brother Brandham says he just has simply, you know, you call it cancer, but he said it's the devil and we don't need a lot of names. &gt;&gt; We don't need a lot of names. We know that it is the devil. And why I certainly don't have anything against doctors. I thank God for them. The prophet thanked God for them. Some of his great friends were were uh Dr. Samadair. And uh and we're thankful for what they can do. and they can perhaps tell you something about your body that you don't know. And I know I've gone to a doctor and I said, he said, "What are you doing?" And so I I told him what I was doing. He said, "No, you're doing exactly the wrong thing." So that's when I thank God for a doctor. Okay, what should I do? We know you said do this. Okay, fine. And then go home and do what he said do and then you're okay. You know, and uh so we're thankful for that. But we want to remember our brother Dyra that God will strengthen him. It's been a miracle that he's been preserved to this time. Also just got a text from brother Tom just before coming to service and he just had the last service. He and brother Murphy they've had uh a very intense number of meetings and also ministers meetings and now uh they are there right now. Michael is over there and just arrived. They're meeting in Sanhen uh now this evening and they're going to commence uh doing a lot of video work and so on and being with the the saints and believers in Sanhan that are moving forward with the Bible project for China. I am enthused about the Bible project. I may not get enthused very quickly, but once I do, I'm like a bulldog, you know. I'm very enthused to think that we can have a primary part in giving the people of China an accurate Bible, &gt;&gt; a Bible that the prophet of God used. I think that's wonderful. Amen. Well, I'm not going to take any uh delay, but I'd like to sing that song one more time. Sister Lena, here um we're standing on holy ground. Let's all stand, shall we? When we are standing on holy ground, when I go and there are angels all around. Oh, let us praise our Jesus now. For we are standing in his presence, our holy ground. Let's sing together also the chorus of that bold hymn. He leadeth me. He leadeth me. By his own hand he leadeth me. All right. Let's sing it together. And let's sing it with uh uh with some conviction in our heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know when people just win a ball game or brother Ben a hockey game, I'm sure that there's a little more. Well, well, that was nice. No, no. We just are enthused about it. I'm enthused that God leads us. Do you believe he knows you? &gt;&gt; Has he led you? &gt;&gt; He does indeed. All right, let us sing it once again. He leadth me. Oh, he leadth me. He leadth me. By his own me. for his faithful power I would be. For by his hand he good. He me help me my high [Music] and his faithful father I would be for my heavenly Father, you are our guide. You have led us. And your ways are not our ways. They're so far beyond our ways. None of us thought that you would send a messenger such as you have in this day. None of us even dreamed or imagined there would be such a message as you have sent us in this hour. That it would be a call to the rapture. the change of these bodies. And Lord Jesus, as we see one departing us here and our sister Cindy having departed us and others have departed us in the past, we know that it's just beyond the curtain of time. And we have these phrases because your messenger used these phrases and stepped into the theophony body waiting for that glorious glorified body. Lord, we look forward to the marriage supper of the lamb. Oh God, we're planning on having a memorial service Tuesday, but we'd sooner be gathered around the marriage table. Lord Jesus, thy will be done. Take the word this morning. Take the vessel, oh God. And in our weakness and frailty, speak and may the Holy Ghost be the one that utters the words. We pray that they will find their uh per uh their their place in the heart, Lord God, and that every person will be greatly built up, strengthened, benefited, perhaps directed or redirected in Jesus Christ's name for your glory. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles, if you would, please, to Luke the 24th chapter. And then keep your Bible uh at the ready if you would please because we will be going then later on into uh other scriptures. But I'm going to be reading considerable from later on, Lord willing, out of Genesis, the 37th chapter, starting at verse 25 down through verse 27. Luke 24:2. Then he said unto them, "Oh fools and slow of heart." And that slow of heart means slow to apprehend or believe or to be dull in mind or inactive in mind. But we don't want to be that way this morning. And uh it's slow in heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. Isn't that a marvelous scripture? &gt;&gt; And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, Brother Brandham said, "Oh, he'd love to have heard him." And he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. May God bless his word to our hearts as you have your seat. I would really appreciate your full and kind attention and to be just as alert as possible and don't allow your mind to be distracted. And the reason I say that is because I'm attempting this morning to perhaps sometimes you reach out into areas that uh may not be just entirely clear to yourself, even to myself. But you know that there's something there and it's it is dealing with something in the message that perhaps you've had question about. Uh I don't question things in the message but you can have questions about the message. You understand? I don't question say well now was he right here or no I don't question that but I question uh when I may see brother Brandham lean one way in one area and then lean another way in another area say it one way at one time say it another way another time. I don't question why he does that, but I question uh in myself my own understanding that I might understand why he's doing that. There's a reason for it and we want to know why he's doing that. And just keep your heart open so that God will at the appointed time start speaking to your movie in such a way to say, "Oh, now I understand." And so this morning's service and I'll probably have to take another service or two on this but stay with me please if you would. Brother Brandham speaks of this time when uh uh uh in the rising of the sun he says that the resurrection week was the greatest week in in history. And he uses this phrase and it's the only time that I find that he uses it. He said it was the secret of life after death being not it wasn't he didn't say being revealed he calls it the secret of life because the Easter seal the seal was broken and the secret of life after death &gt;&gt; now was made known. &gt;&gt; Now they didn't know that it was being made known. They were simply walking with a man and they didn't realize it was another kind of a body. They didn't realize there was another kind of a life. Listen friends, that could happen to any one of you. &gt;&gt; That could happen to any believer in this message. And I trust that we will have that experience that we will walk with the resurrected. &gt;&gt; We will walk with the elected redeemed. &gt;&gt; You talk about achievement. To me that's the greatest achievement I think that we could possibly have. And so it was the greatest week in history. And he said the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know. Now the secret of this life that we have even right now the secret of life. I've been uh thinking about that. I I'm going be using that term in the scripture uh quite a bit in the service. The secret of this life had been foreshadowed all through the Bible. The secret of the life of Jesus Christ had been foreshadowed all through the Bible. But the secret had not been let out &gt;&gt; until this time until the Easter seal was broken or I just like to say the seal was broken and then uh the by the resurrection and then it was made known. What had been secret now had been made known. Now in our natural life and our natural life and in our birth or by birth we are born with certain gifts and traits, talents and skills. But our parents don't know exactly what's going to come of us. They don't know exactly what we're going to become. And many parents are many parents are actually very pleasantly surprised. Some may be disappointed because they have higher goals in mind for their children. But there are there are men and women we have in life maybe certain opportunities or circumstances uh of life just devolve in a certain way and move us into a certain channel and and uh you know bingo. There's uh we we we surprise ourselves. Maybe I have something here. Don't don't be afraid. But it's a masterpiece of a handmade knife. It's just magnificent. It's ironwood. It's uh turquoise stone from Arizona. It's ivory in the middle. It has special uh little buds or rivets there that come from Texas. So, it comes from many different places. The steel is very special steel because it's been sent to California to a certain place that hardens that steel to the hardest degree it can be. And uh but this has been made by a man and it's made just in a room or two of his little trailer home. And that man is brother Mike Vineyard. I I now this is right in very fitting, brother Mike, I put this in my briefcase yesterday. I never cease to look at the knives that our brother vineyard has made and I cannot conceive in my mind. I cannot grasp how that man takes a rough piece of steel and turns it into this kind of a this is a a a gifted man. And his father makes the holster for it and it just fits so perfect and snug and just a little click in there so it doesn't come out. I doubt if Mike Vineyard's parents ever dreamed that he would take a piece of coal steel and make this kind of a beautiful thing. This has special meaning to me and it was very appropriate this morning, Brother Mike. I didn't I didn't know I was going to do this, but I just thought it was so appropriate because the gift and talent that lies within a person, now I want you to catch this, remains a secret until it's manifested. And then what was in them is interpreted by what they're able to do. You could not live the life of this message &gt;&gt; unless the author and the spirit &gt;&gt; of God who wrote the word &gt;&gt; and SAID THIS IS WHAT'S going to happen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to send Elijah the prophet &gt;&gt; and he is going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. &gt;&gt; You were not able or capable within yourself. You were not born with the ability or the skills to to live the KIND OF LIFE THAT the message describes. But when God spoke and uttered and said, "THIS IS THE KIND OF LIFE these people are going to live." And somehow A SPECIAL GRACE CAME UPON A CERTAIN PEOPLE AND THAT'S CALLED ELECTED PEOPLE. It's called predestinated people. It's called THE CHILDREN OF GOD PEOPLE. IT'S CALLED BY THE PROPHET THE Exodus people. &gt;&gt; You did not have that ability. You did not have THAT SKILL. BUT GOD PLACED a seed down in there. And I want you to remember the word seed because we we cannot even be imagine or or begin to comprehend or grasp the power THAT'S WITHIN THE SEED. BUT THE PROPHET SAID THERE WAS POTENTIALS WITHIN THE seed to transform UH TO TRANSFORM WHATEVER WAS IN THE SEED INTO ITS SPECIES. &gt;&gt; So it's not you or I. &gt;&gt; It's not within us. It's not it's not we're not capable of it of it. But the word that you believe and he said if you get it in the right channel, &gt;&gt; IT WILL BRING FORTH WHAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY THE CREATOR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So even in natural sometimes we don't know that someone is gifted as a as a musician or as a uh be it a pianist or one of the other instruments. We just aren't aware of that. But it becomes known to us. The Bible speaks and says this. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself." When I say seed, I want you to think of word. I want you to think of spoken word. And everything falls on this falls at this point right here. It focuses on this point and that is there's no shortage of words in the world. &gt;&gt; There's no shortage of books in the world. There's no shortage of theories in the world. THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF opinions in the world. AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF PREACHERS IN THE WORLD. THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF OF OF WHAT people declare as truth. and one goes east and one goes west and another goes another direction. All the directions in the uh on the globe and all say it's all truth. But we CAN WE CAN ASK THEN WHERE IS TRUTH? &gt;&gt; And who is the author of truth? &gt;&gt; And if God is the author of truth then it's up to God. It's his responsibility to prove who it is that's speaking. AND THIS IS WHAT I SAY ABOUT THE MESSAGE. The one reason I have a a an unmovable unequivocal &gt;&gt; uh confidence within the message is because it is the one message that almighty God attended to and ACCOMPANIED IN A SUPERNATURAL WAY. &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to say yay or nay. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; That is true. Then here we ARE AS A PEOPLE. WHAT IS OUR NOT RESPONSIBILITY BUT WHAT IS our privilege? Our privilege if if God will grant grace so that you can believe it. And I would say that to all that are here if there's any question or hesitation in your mind you ought to move it out of the way quickly because I can say one thing from history and from all the religious history you may have. There has been no message. No message. If there has been and you know it, you come and tell me after this service and don't hesitate. Be very quick. I have not found or heard of ever in history a message THAT HAS BEEN SO CONFIRMED, &gt;&gt; SO PROVEN, &gt;&gt; so vindicated &gt;&gt; as a message THAT YOU HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO HEAR. AND YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO STAND AND SAY, "OH, GLORY TO GOD." Not because we're just enthused or excited, but because we're privileged of the people of the earth to have such a word come to us. &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory to God." &gt;&gt; And that word is a seed. &gt;&gt; It's eternal life seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someone has said and I found this phrase actually it's a large article and I was searching for what is in a seed and this gentleman said in a seed lies the fierce fierce force of life. The drive within them is stronger than any other on our planet &gt;&gt; and that to survive. &gt;&gt; It must spring forth. &gt;&gt; And he speaks of the glory and the wonder of it. It goes into the ground singular and comes up multiplied because the drive and the force within it is to reproduce. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet goes back and says, he takes the phrase BRING FORTH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S doing it. &gt;&gt; That's what's doing it. &gt;&gt; That's why you put a seed in the ground and in the fall time. Here it COMES UP. IT COMES UP MAYBE from the bloom and the flower and the stalk AND FINALLY IT'S MULTIPLIED many times. BUT IT'S THERE'S A FORCE within it. This gentleman has said the fierce force of life that's in his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if God has done that for a potato &gt;&gt; or for a carrot &gt;&gt; or for a tomato, &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH MORE FOR HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD TO BRING FORTH HIS LIFE &gt;&gt; AND TO EXPRESS WHAT HE SAID, BRING FORTH, &gt;&gt; MULTIPLY. I'm not talking about multiplying in a in a natural way, BUT MULTIPLY HIS IMAGE. BRING FORTH HIM ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; And this has been the great secret. &gt;&gt; And incidentally, I will just say this to some of you that may be more familiar with the message. While I go through this, I want you to think about the seventh seal and his coming. You're nice and quiet. There's places where brother Brandham speaks about the seventh seal as though it is opened and it's happened and the seventh seal is his coming. And then he speaks of we know that the seventh seal is isn't opened. Well, you can't have it opened and not opened. And yet on one side you're smiling on one side uh you say so we have whole groups within the message. Oh has nothing to do with us. It's not open and we got other groups and they got all the courses about it is open since the opening of the seals. So you say so here we are and and we uh say well we need somebody to explain it. Well you can't explain it. God has to just reveal it. I'll just give you a clue and then you'll kind of know where I'm going. Brother Brandham said it was Christ in Joseph. It was Christ in Isaac. It was Christ in Moses. It was Christ in David when he was rejected. And yet David and he goes to he goes into depth and he says and he says all my bones my bones the personal pronoun my bones they stare at me and he says and he was rejected and and but he said it was Christ he was acting out but there's no record anywhere in this scripture and I'm going to be going into Joseph. There's no script there's no place anywhere in the scripture where anyone of those people of the Old Testament rejoiced in in what they were typifying or what they were expressing. None of them said David never said, "Oh, but there's A GREATER ONE. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE REJECTED BECAUSE THERE'S A GREATER ONE that's coming. IT'S A MESSIAH AND HE'S GOING TO BE REJECTED AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT I CAN ACT OUT MY PART. &gt;&gt; NO, &gt;&gt; they didn't know it. &gt;&gt; It was a secret. &gt;&gt; But the secret was Christ was coming. &gt;&gt; Christ was coming. &gt;&gt; They were part of the coming. And then now we come down and forgive me, I'm kind of getting ahead of myself, but now we comes into the end time &gt;&gt; and we have a a last messenger. &gt;&gt; And I don't dispute we have a last messenger &gt;&gt; and we have the unfolding of the word. And now he's been sent to speak the opening of the seals. And he comes to the seventh. He says it's his coming. But there's a part yet that has not been fulfilled or hasn't happened because it has to be acted out. &gt;&gt; It has to be manifested in a people. AND THAT'S A SECRET PART of it because we don't even know it. &gt;&gt; When I say we don't know it, we we know it &gt;&gt; in the interpretation. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Is everybody listening? &gt;&gt; I have to lay these things out in the interpretation when we say uh this is the interpretation. So we say all right verbally or in speech we can say here's a person speaking another language but he's going to interpret what I'm saying. So he's going to take the one sound and translate it and put it into a different verbiage and someone else can. So that we say well that is interpretation or we have someone reading the scripture and we say well this is what it means and so we have an interpretation of the scripture and we have churches spotted all over the country. I thought I would try to say what is the secret in life and I went on to the website and I got on just one person's website about the secret of life or the secret in life or the secret of life and this one started out you are so lucky that you got onto this page. I thought, "Wow, I am so lucky." I got on onto this page, seeking the secret of life. You have found it. You're in the right place. I thought, "Wow, this guy must really have something to say." And so I looked to see how many people that clicked on. There was only one before me. I thought, "Well, we're two lucky people on the earth." I thought, "If this man only knew." And I read what he had to say. And you know what he had to say? nothing, absolutely zero. In fact is I WAS EXPECTING HIM TO SAY something astounding but it was really below zero. There was there was just nothing there. I thought how pathetic and here I am. I I just said I'm off of Google. I tell you what, when you got a message you don't need to Google. All these people have got all kinds of ideas. And so there's no shortage of opinions. There's no shortage of theories. There's no shortage of messages which are interpreting the word. But you know what? We have one WHO HAS ACTUALLY INTERPRETED the word AND ABLE TO SAY THUS sayaeth the Lord and then have God come behind him AND CONFIRM THAT IT IS GOD speaking because it's not a man speaking when he's revealing the secret of a heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; And so we we call that which is in you as a believer as potentials. You have the potential to uh unfold the hour. And brother Brandham, I'll give you the key. Brother Brandham says two or three times he says this. Now this is the key. He said when he was speaking to the woman at the well, when he was speaking to Nathan Nathaniel, he said his own life was the interpretation. His life, his life, what he was living. HE DIDN'T GET OUT AND SAY, "I'M the interpretation of the scripture." But what the scripture said would happen at that season. AND AND AND DID SAY MAYBE DIDN'T EVEN SAY IT WOULD BE AT THAT SEASON, BUT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. WELL, she didn't come and say, YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS, I'M GOING TO INTERPRET THAT SCRIPTURE. NO, SHE JUST lived her life like a like a young lady and believed the word of God and bore forth a child, a manchild when she was still a virgin. EVEN THOUGH SHE SAID, "HOW CAN THIS BE?" BUT IT WAS. &gt;&gt; It was. Why was it? Because the POWER AND THE STRENGTH OF THE SPOKEN WORD WAS IN THAT SEED. &gt;&gt; Are you able to follow me? &gt;&gt; But it was still a mystery. It was STILL A SECRET. SHE DIDN'T KNOW what kind of a child. SHE DIDN'T KNOW. ALL SHE KNEW THAT THE ANGEL HAD SAID, you know, she'll call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. But they DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING to happen or what the manifestation's going to be. BUT JESUS HIMSELF didn't come and say, "I'll interpret this for you." His life &gt;&gt; WAS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SCRIPTURE. I want to SAY TO THIS CONGREGATION and every believer, I'm talking about solid believers of the message, your life, &gt;&gt; your life &gt;&gt; with your hardships and with your weaknesses and with your frailties and with everything else that you EN ENCOUNTER IN LIFE. BUT YOUR LIFE ULTIMATELY INTERPRETS the word of God for this season. And you don't have to go, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND INTERPRET IT FOR PEOPLE. YOUR LIFE WILL INTERPRET IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OUR LIFE IS DECLARING MALACHI 4 &gt;&gt; HAS HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU HAVE BELIEVED THIS IS a vindicated prophet from God. Your life confirms. YOUR LIFE PROVES &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT WAS SAID HAD POWER IN IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Read brother Brown said the seed possesses the potentials and power of transformation &gt;&gt; as long as it stays in its channel. &gt;&gt; So it's not just an absolute that no matter what you do or anything it's going to happen but we have to stay with the right attitude and in the right in channel for it to take place. And this is what he said. And everything under control to bring forth of its kind. He said, "Now remember to bring to bring." And he brings that in quotation mark to bring. When he put the seed in the earth, the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it. We cannot bring forth anything more than what God has deposited in us. And anything that is achieved all glory is to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said his transform his transforming power. Now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be. &gt;&gt; So whatever he has said it would be you or somebody else is going to bring that forth &gt;&gt; and nothing is going to stop it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He went on to say, "As long as it stayed in the right category, &gt;&gt; it would be just exactly what God said it would be. &gt;&gt; It had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel." Oh, I thank God for the channel. &gt;&gt; I thank God that that channel's a reality this morning. And we can be in that channel. If you're not in the channel, you can say, "Father, you have spoken a word. You have made a channel for me. You've made an opportunity. So don't look upon this as just another service. Search out that channel. SAY, I PERHAPS I CAN'T JUST EXACTLY FIND IT, BUT YOU PUT IT in my heart and soul and cause me to believe and and that I might enter into that channel. He said that anything that stays in his channel, in his line of word, it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do. It cannot move from there. And then he says, "And each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the specy." &gt;&gt; I want to ask this congregation, you believe in the predestination. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, you do. And in God's mind, he put it was God. It's not you that wants to bring forth something. It's God. &gt;&gt; He says, "I want a palm tree to look like a palm tree. I want an oak tree to be like an oak tree." So, he put what was ever pictured in his mind. You didn't conceive how an oak tree would look. He did. &gt;&gt; We didn't conceive how a palm tree would look. He did. &gt;&gt; And he put that power in a seed. And the last of all expressions upon the earth must must be the creator himself. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring my image &gt;&gt; down onto the earth. &gt;&gt; I am the God of creation. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he allowed people who would believe his word. Though one would disbelieve or others would disbelieve, HE ALLOWED IN THE SEED a power and we believe THINGS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE BELIEVE IT. Why do you believe the message? &gt;&gt; Well, I can't give you, you know, specifics why I believe it. There's just something within that says I believe it. People say, well, uh, you know, they find all kinds of faults and so on. To me, it's just wonderful. &gt;&gt; And the more I look at it, the more wonderful it is. &gt;&gt; The more beautiful it is, &gt;&gt; THE MORE PERFECT it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus, when he was here, HE HAD FRAILTIES. LISTEN, HE HAD VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE FIND ALL kinds of fault with him. But there was a HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT SAW NO FAULT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; And in in fact is uh when he when he came BEFORE PILATE WHO'S SUPPOSED to find the fault COULD FIND NO FAULT. WHEN HE FINALLY WAS PUT under the magnifying glass of the law he said I FIND NO FAULT with him. &gt;&gt; What a rebuke &gt;&gt; to a bunch of religious people that should have been able to discover that. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; I FIND NO FAULT. AND I SAY TODAY, THIS JESUS &gt;&gt; THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED, THIS JESUS THAT HAS BEEN MANIFESTED, I find no fault with him whatsoever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is he, the author of life, who said, "I I am God and I am going to be glorified. I'm going to be seen. I'm going to be recognized. I'm going to be expressed on the earth. And you may not realize it, but I'm going to make a declaration. And that declaration is this. I don't care how you feel. I don't care how many times you failed. &gt;&gt; I don't care anything else about your life. If God &gt;&gt; has called you, &gt;&gt; if God ordained that you shall express him, &gt;&gt; there is a part of your life. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want this to sound foolish, but you know, you might say this morning, I got to go and brush my teeth. Well, that's not really here. That's just, you know, what God give you some gray matter about. I I need to What'll I wear this morning? Well, that's not part of the mystery. So, you just say, "Well, you know, I'm going to get dressed. I'm going to get I'm going to go to church. I'm going to worship God." Oh, now now you said something worthwhile. I'm gonna worship God. And then and and then and then maybe you know something happens and the toast burns and the tire is flat and this goes I just feel all all churned up. You know just take it easy. Uh you know there's power in the seed &gt;&gt; to transform it and make it the species that it's supposed to be and it works down into our into our ordinary life and our regular life. My let me carry on. So there's two parts to interpretation. Two parts. You can have a verbal interpretation. You can have someone stand up and speak an interpretation. They can declare, "I'm interpreting. This is what the Bible speaks." And then I I've had people say it and I've been aware of it for many, many years. Brother Scoffield has I was holding my Bible once and brother Brandham says, "Oh, I see." He says, "Brother Eddie, I see you have a Scullfield Bible." I said, "Yeah." And he he took it. He said, "That's that's exactly the Bible I carry." He said, "I like old Dr. Scoffield." He said, he said, you know, and that's exactly what he said. I like old Dr. Scoffield. He said, you know, he uh and and I read in the message places when he goes into the mysteries in uh out of Matthew, the mysteries of the kingdom, brother Brandham actually quotes Scoffield, word for word, but and then people say, well, brother Bam, he he just quoted Scullfield. Yeah. Uh well, he said also that it's to tie the loose ends together. He said in other places, don't say they were wrong. The there's been truth coming all the way down. But if you read all the mysteries of the kingdom that brother Brandham gives, there's one on the end. He quotes Scoffield, but he adds one because it was necessary. If you're going to get all the mysteries of the kingdom, you needed one more. And it took a prophet to add that one to it. Are you following me thus far? So there's the spoken part of interpretation of the scripture and then and here is where you and I come in. Then there's the unspoken part. It's a lived out part. And I'm going to show you from the scripture where prior to Christ's physical coming, it they lived out parts of Christ's coming, but they didn't know it. It still remained a mystery. &gt;&gt; It was a secret. It was silent. &gt;&gt; When the seventh seal was open, there was a half hour of silence. If you ask me what is a half hour, I don't know. I don't know what the half hour refers to, but I know that it was silent. There's a silent aspect to his coming. And when he slipped in and when he came and and and I read the scripture and and there was no great roar, thunder, lightning, flashes of light. He just came out of the tomb. Nobody knew he came out of the tomb. &gt;&gt; And this was all part of his coming. Now he was come. Actually, this was the key. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE SECRET OF LIFE AFTER DEATH. THERE'S NO BIG BANG, NO BIG NO BIG ANNOUNCEMENT, NO BIG PREACHER TO TELL IT HAPPENED. IT JUST HAPPENED. JUST CREPT IN. AND THAT WAS PART OF HIS COMING. IT WAS STILL HIS COMING. AND THERE IS THAT. THAT WAS THE KEY PART. HE WANTED TO SHOW THEM. THIS IS the body that you'll have a body like my glorious body because I live. You live. Oh, and and they were in the midst of their lowest moment. Hello. Maybe somebody's here in their low moment. I got good news FOR YOU. MAYBE SOMEBODY'S HERE FEELING I'M A TOTAL FAILURE. I GOT GOOD NEWS for you. THE POWER OF THAT SEED DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHAT YOU CAN DO with it or what you don't do with it. If you STAY IN THE CHANNEL, THE POWER OF THAT SEED WILL BRING FORTH HIS IMAGE &gt;&gt; FOR THIS HOUR, FOR THIS SEASON. AND I WANT TO SAY ONE MORE THING. THIS IS THE SEASON OF HIS COMING. [Music] &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; This is the season of his coming. AND YOU ARE LIVING PART OF THAT COMING. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to speak about Joseph in a few moments and you'll have to really keep your thinking cap on. Brother Brandon speaks about Joseph, Joseph's life. Now often when we think about Joseph, we think about Joseph and the and his brethren bowing to him and so on and so forth and we have Israel that but just a second Joseph's life spans the entire life of Jesus Christ really. So he spans part of his life relates to you sitting here this morning and I couldn't tie that together. And part of his life spans right when uh when we're in the millennium and Jesus is making himself known as the Messiah to his brethren. Part of that is there. So we we'll go into that. His his life spans the life of Jesus Christ on both his first and second coming. I put it that way. His life therefore relates to all of us as we are the body of Jesus Christ. If he if his life related to and expressed Jesus Christ and you have Jesus Christ in you, it's impossible to separate what he was expressing from what you're living. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Brother Bram said, "I was talking I was taking the life of Joseph in the Bible and there and he said there was a man there was nothing against. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the others had something against them, but not Joseph. What a man, a perfect man, a perfect type of Christ." He said, "When I read that, I just got to crying." One day, he said, "In my hotel room and I went over in the closet where my clothes were hanging." Look at how simple this is. And I pulled the door together and I said, "God, I want to thank you for a man like Joseph. &gt;&gt; A man who once lived on the earth, &gt;&gt; a man in flesh like I am. A man that could believe you and take your word. He was hated of his brethren &gt;&gt; and he couldn't help being spiritual. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HELP HAVING IN YOU WHAT GOD put in you. &gt;&gt; You did not ask for it. God determined. You're going to be this and I'm GOING TO PUT THIS IN YOU. AND WHETHER IT COMES EASY OR WHETHER IT COMES HARD, YOU'RE going to express me, the creator. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that gave you life. And this IS THE REAL PURPOSE OF THAT LIFE. &gt;&gt; He saw visions. He could interpret dreams and all of them hated him for it. He couldn't help that. That's just what he was. &gt;&gt; We can't help it. Sorry world &gt;&gt; and I don't apologize. &gt;&gt; DEVILS, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WISH. YOU CAN HOWL AND SCREAM AND DO WHATEVER you want. YOU CAN THROW ALL OF YOUR enchantments at our feet, but it won't work. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SOMETHING WITHIN US &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN'T WE DIDN'T ASK FOR IT. THE ALMIGHTY GOD PUT IT THERE AND THAT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE WAY IT IS. [Music] &gt;&gt; The interpretation of the word in our own life. And to interpret says to give the meaning of or to explain to give illustrative representation of. When we think of interpretation or interpreting, we usually think of somebody speaking or hearing it verbally, but I want to take it a little bit further. And Apostle Paul said, "If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, &gt;&gt; who shall prepare himself for battle?" So likewise, except ye utter by the tongue, those are words that are easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken, for you shall speak into the air. There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification signification. Therefore, if I if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. Now, I speak of the interpretation of the word in your own life. I'm taking a turning a corner. Are you rested enough? You all right? &gt;&gt; Because I wouldn't want you to be too worried. Someone said the other day to brother Brandham, he said, "Someone said the other day when I was talking said,"Brother Brandham, you don't believe then the church will go through the tribulation." I said, "I believe the church will, but not the bride." The church will go through the tribulation. Yes, sir. But the bride is free from it. She'll go in the rapture in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. She'll be caught up to meet her Lord in the air for the wedding supper. She has nothing to go through any tribulation about. Her Lord has paid her price and we're so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; He said, "You may say to me, Brother Brandham, you've got the wrong interpretation of it." Well, that's your opinion. He said, "God don't need an interpreter." &gt;&gt; Said, "You have an opinion. You have a right to an opinion. But God is his own interpreter. And that's what the trouble of it is today. &gt;&gt; That's where the trouble is today. He said, "We've got too many manmade interpreters." &gt;&gt; God can interpret himself, &gt;&gt; his own. Now, catch this, please. I had to I had to say it over several times to me. old. Now, I wish I could have had it on the on the on the screen, but please catch it this way. His own vindication of his word &gt;&gt; is the interpretation. &gt;&gt; So now the vindication is the interpretation of the word. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on, God can interpret himself. His own vindication is his word in of his word is interpretation. He said the Pharisees might have cried out too. We got the interpretation. The Sadducees says we got it. But Jesus was the interpretation. &gt;&gt; So the vindication, the vindication is the interpretation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is Christ. &gt;&gt; That's when you know you have Christ. &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about some signs and wonders and healings now and those things. He said that's what that's what they done to Jesus. They found out back there that they thought he didn't have the interpretation. He was the interpretation. God didn't have to interpret it. Jesus life interpreted it. &gt;&gt; Nothing has changed from back there to this moment. &gt;&gt; The life of Jesus Christ. IF THE IF JESUS CHRIST NOW, THERE'S MILLIONS that certainly believe this morning that the life of Jesus Christ is in them. And I'm not going to dispute that. I don't have to ridicule people. All I can say is this. If Jesus Christ who is the word is literally living in a person, their life &gt;&gt; will be the interpretation of the scripture that God wrote for this hour. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Their life will be the interpretation. So all scriptures that refer to this day would only be words in a book or preached over a pulpit. &gt;&gt; But once God fulfills that word and the called ones believe it, &gt;&gt; the ones that have been birthed in that age and they are called to believe that word, then then the word is being interpreted by a lived out life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the woman at the well, she recognized it &gt;&gt; she recognized her day &gt;&gt; by the SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's how she recognized it. &gt;&gt; Jesus life. &gt;&gt; He was living out the life of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; And she recognized it while others thought it was the devil. Bub, she thought it was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said Nathaniel, a great Hebrew, &gt;&gt; he recognized it. &gt;&gt; Jesus was that promise. Jesus was that promise &gt;&gt; of the scripture vindicated &gt;&gt; to the woman &gt;&gt; or he was the interpretation. the vindication or the interpretation. Now listen, this is so important. Jesus was the interpretation of the scripture. His own life interpreted the scripture. &gt;&gt; Multitudes of people can read. As it was in the days of Sodom, as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the day when the Son of Man &gt;&gt; is revealed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's certainly a lot of ideas and opinions about that. &gt;&gt; And and and until the message came, I was a minister. I preached for several years. I traveled in evangelistic work through Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Idaho, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, that whole area, and preached in many, many, many churches. and had minister friends of mine who preached and some were believed in three gods or three trinitarians. Some believed only in two. The one that I was ministering with believed in two. Said I can't see a third. And they baptized this way, that way, whatever way. Went to Africa. They baptized for every sin a person could remember. And brother Willie Ratif was standing on the bank and the man was coming up and they're asking, you know, do you remember another one? Yeah. Oh, down he went again. Brother Willie actually walked over to him said, you're drowning him. It is humorous, but that's just how sideways things were. It goes every direction. And this stuff, I hesitate to even tell people that I'm a minister today because in the world, they automatically put it to some television evangelist, which is so far they're even a poor they're a poor example of Hollywood. I've seen some. I know what I'm talking about. I think THIS IS SUCH TRASH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS SUCH GARBAGE. &gt;&gt; And most of it's pointed towards money somehow to make money. &gt;&gt; And it's amazing. THEY HAVE FAITH HOW GOD will give you money to give them the money, but their faith doesn't HOW COME GOD DOESN'T DO IT FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. Isn't that amazing? Let me go on your life. And this is the scripture. This is the quote rather that spoke to me so powerfully. And uh while I was away and I've been pondering and making making notes and taking the thoughts and reading, I've been I I felt led to start reading in Genesis and just read straight through Genesis and right at the end of Exodus right now just to see and I and when I got into the life of of Joseph, uh I began to feel something very very strange. There's a secret mystery in Joseph's life. Can I continue on for just a little bit? There's a secret life that a secret mystery in Joseph's life. And although we have the account of his life, now I'm I'm teaching a bit here. Although we have the account of his life written here in the scripture and you can read it as I have as I read it and prayerfully his dreams and the dreams of others recorded in the scripture. You can read it. You can hear the dream. You can hear what happened afterward. And yet the mystery that is not even written &gt;&gt; is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's nothing said. &gt;&gt; HE'S CAST INTO THE PIT. HE'S CAST INTO THE DUNGEON. HE DIDN'T SAY, "OH, HOW WONDERFUL. I'M REPRESENTING THE GREATEST WEEK OF HISTORY. He didn't even know it. &gt;&gt; To him, he's in prison. &gt;&gt; To him, he's in a pit. &gt;&gt; To him, he's in one of his lowest moments. &gt;&gt; And so, his sons, he has a dream. And the he has dreams. All right. If you want to just turn turn with me, we're just going to read a few verses and then I'm going to continue on for a bit. If you get too weary, I'll just quit. Do &gt;&gt; you want me to continue? &gt;&gt; That's good because I plan to anyway. Genesis 37. We're just going to start at verse three. And now I come really down to the crunch of it. It's good for you to have your Bibles. Now, Israel, that was Jacob, loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors. Brother Brandham said it was a covenant coat, the seven colors of the rainbow. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceibly to him. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told his brethren, and they hated him yet more. And he said, "Here, I pray you the dream which I dreamed. And behold, we were binding sheav in the field, and lo, my sheath arose, and also stood upright, and behold, your sheav stood around about and made obesence or bowed to my sheath." And his brethren said unto him, "Shalt thou indeed reign over us, or shalt thou have indeed have dominion over us?" You remember the scripture when Jesus came, they said, "We won't have this man to reign over us. And they hated him yet the more verse 8 for his dreams for his and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream and told his his brethren and said, "Behold, I've dreamed a dream more. And behold, the sun and the moon and the 11 stars made obesence to me." And he told it to his father and to his brethren. And his father rebuked him and said unto him, "What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come and to bow down ourselves to thee in the earth? And his brethren envied him, but his father observed the saying. All right. The dreams give no details of what, listen now, no details of what Joseph will go through before the dreams are fulfilled. You may know God saved me. God called me to redemption. God has called me to be a son of God. But you do not know. Perhaps you have a bit of a record now, but you don't know what it entails for you to be that. And there are, you might agree with this or you might disagree with it, but there are segments or portions of your life that are not all written in the word of God. And they don't they apply to this life. God put you here and you have God didn't say thus says the Lord, thou shalt go to school when you become six years old. He didn't say that. He didn't perhaps announce who your teacher was going to be. He didn't tell you thus sayeth the Lord, thou shalt go to college and have some further education. He didn't say, "Thou thus sayeth the Lord, thou shalt be skilled in computer sciences or you shall be gifted as a mechanic or you shall be a special woman as a mother, a housewife or whatever more." He didn't say that. &gt;&gt; But he said one thing and declared one thing. I have written certain things in this word &gt;&gt; and they are time locked and some were for Joseph's day some were for Moses day some were for Samuel's day David's day SOME WERE FOR CHRIST'S DAY SOME WERE FOR THE APOSTLES DAY AND SOME WERE FOR THIS day &gt;&gt; and there were people all along and the real gift they had is that they were called to that word &gt;&gt; BY THE HOLY SPIRIT HEAR IT. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CALLED AND THEY HEARD THAT WORD AND THEY KNEW THIS IS DIFFERENT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS SPEAKING TO A SEED THAT WAS DOWN INSIDE. AND THAT SEED WAS GIVEN POWER BY THE AUTHOR. THE CREATOR OF THE SEED SAYS, "I WILL TURN THIS PLANT, THIS TREE, THIS PERSON INTO THE SPECIES THAT I WANT HIM TO be or I desire her to be." &gt;&gt; And it's just that simple. &gt;&gt; There's people that are sitting here. You said, "Well, you know, I don't believe I'm that. And the author is saying, "Yeah, yeah, you are that you are going to do it." And you're saying, "Well, I don't think I have the strength to do it." No, he said, "You you do you will do it." Well, I didn't expect that it was going to go this direction. And the author says, "Yeah, that's correct. You didn't expect it." And you might say, I think now he's dreamed a dream. And the thing is, now here comes the scriptural punchline. Joseph was able to tell them the dream, but he wasn't able to interpret his own dream. Amen. &gt;&gt; He got put into prison with the butler and the baker uh the chief of the butler and the chief of the bakers of Pharaoh's uh kingdom and they had a dream and he could interpret their dream and even tell them what was going to happen. &gt;&gt; Your head's going to be taken off you and you're going to be restored and bear THE CUP TO PHARAOH. HE COULD TELL HIM ALL THAT, but he couldn't even interpret his own dream that he was he the real depth of his dream was I'm in prison AND I AM THE TYPE OF THE MESSIAH AND ONE IS BEING RESTORED AND ONE IS BEING LOST. HE DIDN'T SAY I SEE A CROSS. I see two crosses, one on each side. I SEE THE MESSIAH hanging there and I AM THE PRIVILEGED ONE OF THE EARTH TO REPRESENT HIM. &gt;&gt; LISTEN FOLKS, SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And neither can you interpret &gt;&gt; what is taking place because so often and I'm dealing with reality. We get the idea that things are going sideways. He had a dream that the 11 chiefs were going to bow to his chief. And in a short time, he's on a camel ride &gt;&gt; with some Israelites and merchant men ON HIS WAY TO EGYPT. HE'S GOING FURTHER AWAY FROM ANYTHING that he could put together. How in the world are these brethren going to bow to him? I'm going in the opposite direction. &gt;&gt; So, you might as well say amen because I look in your faces AND KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY where you've been. &gt;&gt; I'm going further away from what I feel should be happening. I'm I'm HEADED IN A THIS THING'S GOING IN REVERSE. NO, it's not going in reverse. You're right on side. You're right on time. You're right in the channel. And you're going TO PRODUCE JESUS CHRIST in his coming. &gt;&gt; You're going to produce. You're going TO BE THE EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS JESUS CHRIST STANDING AT THE PLATFORM. YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE EVIDENCE THAT JESUS CHRIST SPOKE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL HAVE YOUR YOU'LL HAVE YOUR TIME. You'll sit around the table. You'll sit around THE MARRIAGE TABLE. YOU'LL BE IN ANOTHER BODY. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE GREETING OTHER SAINTS BECAUSE THAT'S THE LIFE THAT'S IN the seed. &gt;&gt; So, he was going further. I've had Mike Hunt used to say to me, "Boy, never dreamed all this was going to happen. Never dreamed the message was going to go this way. never dreamed never dreamed that you know we'd go through this. No, you didn't dream we'd go through the but my announcement to you is it's right on time &gt;&gt; and it's right on track &gt;&gt; and as long as you are in the channel. &gt;&gt; As long as you're in the channel. Well, how do I know I'm in the channel? You're sitting here this morning. Your heart is open. Your spirit is open. &gt;&gt; You're willing. And oh God, whatever your will is, &gt;&gt; you're in the channel. &gt;&gt; You're in the channel. God, I I have to emphasize that because I have uh hundreds of millions of devils that are on the charge to tell you you're in the wrong place. You're in the wrong channel. I'm here to tell you, you're in the right channel. If you have the right attitude towards the word of God, GOD'S GOING TO BRING THINGS FORTH OUT OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE LEAST YOU LEAST EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; Just as I was leaving Hawaii, I tried to see a man the last time I was there. He was a salesman and now he's sales manager. And I sat down with him and actually he had left the office and was on his way home and I got a text and he says, "I'm here in the I'm here in the office." And so I stepped into the lobby and and I said, "Is is I called him by name. Is he here?" Another said, "John's left." I said, "I just talked to him." I said, "I I was on the I was listening to a voicemail as I walked over here. I talked to him in the last two minutes." Anyway, they called him and he came back. He said, "Well, I was on my way home. I didn't think you were coming." We sat down in the first few minutes. He says, "This world's a violent place." He says, "This, you know, this world is a violent place. This is shootings and killings." He says, "What's going on?" You know, the economy and everything is going all sideways. You know, here's a successful man, what's going on? says, "Well, you know, we got talking into it and finally he said, 'Well, you know," he said, "I made some trips to," he said, "I made some trips to Asia, to Vietnam, and to Thailand, and to Cambodia." He says, "I'm leaving in a few days again." And he said, "I just want to do something." What are you doing? Well, I don't know. He says, "You know, I talked to my dentist and he'll go over and fill somebody's teeth and I I talked to a sports outfit and they're giving me all their sweaters and he says, "I SEE THE KIDS LAYING ON THE STREET." HE SAID, "THEY'RE ORPHANS." He said, "I was an orphan." That's the first time I knew that I was an orphan. He said, "I see all these kids in there laying on the street." He says, "You got to do something." I DON'T KNOW. I GOT TO DO SOMETHING. And that's just the way. And I was able to tell him and I just sent him. He may be listening right now. He says, "I want the I want the your address, web address so I can stream the meeting." I just sent it to him last night. So I want to say also to John, there's several hundred people here. John that have found what the real answer to life is all about. &gt;&gt; And I told you, John, it has to start with a new birth. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful I'm with the people that were born again &gt;&gt; of another seed. &gt;&gt; Not just the seed of your father, the sperm of your father. and come from the womb of your mother. &gt;&gt; YOU CAME FROM THE MOUTH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE ORIGINAL SEED. AND THAT SPOKEN WORD HAS THE POWER INVESTED IN IT. IT WILL BRING FORTH WHAT THE AUTHOR SAID IT WOULD BRING FORTH. &gt;&gt; And I want you to have a irrevocable CONFIDENCE &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S EXACTLY what it is. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to be another few minutes and then I'm going to close the dreams give no details and even his life which interprets the dreams he doesn't even know that remains a secret and mystery. You know why I'm speaking this way? Because you came to church this morning as a believer of this message. You came because you're invited. You came because you well I I I enjoy the fellowship or I enjoy the singing or whatever more. I'll tell you why you came. You don't even know &gt;&gt; what's behind it. &gt;&gt; God has ordained that you need to be here perhaps to hear these very words &gt;&gt; and to go away from here and said, "I didn't realize that these things could be being fulfilled. I don't have to understand it. In fact, is God has held IT FROM ME. &gt;&gt; HE'S HELD IT AS A SECRET, &gt;&gt; but I've been told and I am telling you on the authority of God's word, you are manifesting THE COMING OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THE SAME AS JOSEPH WAS MANIFESTING THE COMING of the Lord. You have been called to manifest A CERTAIN PART OF HIS COMING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He's bought by Potterer, captain of Pharaoh's guard, Joseph's made overseer of potterer's possessions. Oh, things are going good. He got a raise. He's doing well. Maybe thought now I'm in the blessings of God. He's falsely accused. Oh, something's happened. and he is he re he he refuses the enticements of this beautiful woman potterer's wife and he's cast into prison because he leaves his coat and she says this man here tried to seduce me and fact is there was nothing of the truth and so because of that he's cast into prison &gt;&gt; God doesn't deliver him out of prison right away he's in prison He needs to be in prison. &gt;&gt; THAT'S PART OF THE TYPE. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT SAY THINGS ARE GOING SIDEWAYS. They need to go sideways. &gt;&gt; Things are going in reverse. They need to go in reverse. GOD IS DOING SOMETHING WHEN things are going SIDEWAYS THAT HE CAN'T DO WHEN YOU'RE ON THE MOUNTAINTOP. THERE HAS TO BE A DUNGEON. AND GOD KEPT IT FROM HIM. GOD KEEPS IT FROM YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS TRIAL. GOD DOESN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY you're going through the trial. AND GOD DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE YOU OUT OF IT UNTIL HE'S READY. &gt;&gt; SAY, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAY, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Are you BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAY, "THANK YOU FOR THE DUNGEON." &gt;&gt; GOOD. It's all about 20% of the hands. But anyway, &gt;&gt; you will learn things and things happen and God does not interpret. He never did get AN INTERPRETATION. THE INTERPRETATION OF HIS LIFE, LISTEN, you didn't EVEN KNOW TILL A PROPHET WAY hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, centuries later comes. He was loved of his father. He was hated of his brethren. He was a spiritual man. He had a coat of many colors because there was the seven colors of the rainbow. The same rainbow was over the head of the Lord Jesus. He was clothed with the covenant. &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS CAME, HIS CLOTHING WAS HIS COVENANT. He couldn't do anything outside of the word of God. &gt;&gt; I hope that this is carrying some impact to you. We didn't know that till now. Now the mystery OF HIS LIFE STARTS TO UNFOLD. THE MYSTERY OF AND FURTHERMORE, THE PROPHET SAID IT WAS Christ in Joseph. &gt;&gt; And now we realize, oh, isn't that wonderful? It was like Christ in Joseph. Come on, wake up, folks. It's Christ in you, the hope of glory. And that's what you should be rejoicing. Well, I I I shouldn't be going through this if it's Christ IN ME. WHO SAID YOU'RE NOT supposed to be going through it? &gt;&gt; I say this, whatever you do, do it all in the name and for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; I have a good job. Praise the Lord. Thank him for it. I'm going through a difficult time. Praise the Lord. You thank him for it. I'VE GOT DECISIONS. THAT'S FINE. We all have decisions. And the prophet SAID, "SOMETIMES THE PROPHET EVEN makes a wrong decision." He says they said God doesn't show a prophet everything &gt;&gt; and you have to make decisions on your own. Should I do this? Shouldn't I do that? Sometimes we just have to weigh things out &gt;&gt; and say this. Here's the key. Another key. But whatever I do, whatever trade I learn, whatever skills I achieve, all will be done with the intent of blessing the people of God. &gt;&gt; I am here to serve the body of Jesus Christ. And you shall never never be disappointed with that attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just another couple of minutes, please. Pharaoh dreamed a dream. Then now Pharaoh dreamed a dream. And in his dream, and I want you to catch this very closely now, he stood by a river, and out of the river came seven fat cattle, and they fed in a meadow. And then he dreamed immediately another dream and he saw seven poor cattle, skinny ones, come out and stand beside the others. And he, that was the first dream. The second dream, he dreamed of seven ears of corn, beautiful corn. And then he saw seven bad ears of corn, withered and blasted and bad. And he dreamed it. And he called all of his wise men and his magicians and said, "What is this dream?" And they couldn't interpret the dreams. And then that butler, the butler had forgotten and he had made a promise. And Joseph said, "Now I've told you your dreams. When you get out, remember me." That's you. Deliver me out of this dungeon. I've been here by a false accusation. It never happened. &gt;&gt; Nothing could be further from the truth. Pray that I'll be delivered out of this dungeon. And the butler forgets. Do you know why he forgot? God wanted him to forget &gt;&gt; until the appropriate moment. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT KIND OF GOD IS THIS? This is the God that makes no errors. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? congregation, the balcony. You believe that? He makes no errors. EVERY JUDGMENT IS absolutely correct. And the butler forgets him until this moment arrives. And then, ah, I remember now when I was in prison, the Hebrew down there, he interpreted my dream and told me that I would be here and lift up the cup again to you. He says, "Go and get him." &gt;&gt; So, his whiskers must have been out. The Bible says he shaved, washed, cleaned his clothes, and came and stood and heard these he heard these dreams. And Joseph tells them, "There's a God that can interpret these dreams. That's all he knows. There's a God that'll interpret these dreams." So he interprets. He interprets. Get this now, please. He's standing there interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, but he can't even interpret his own. &gt;&gt; He can't interpret his own vision. HE DOESN'T KNOW THIS. NOW, I'VE BEEN LIFTED UP OUT of the prison and here's the here's the one fellow who got restored and I am I this is the greatest thing. I am representative of the Messiah in the greatest WEEK IN ALL OF HISTORY. &gt;&gt; But he's missing it. &gt;&gt; He's missing it. &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. It's either true or it's not true. &gt;&gt; We're not here for a picnic. &gt;&gt; There's going to be some people Some people are actually going to walk with the resurrected. &gt;&gt; It's never happened before. They're going to actually walk with THE DEAD IN CHRIST THAT have risen. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be there? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to experience that? &gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST WEEK IN ALL HISTORY, brother Daniel. &gt;&gt; I'm beside myself. &gt;&gt; I want to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to walk with them? what it be like to have one of them come up right beside you and you say, "Man, had the hardest week. Has been the crulest time. I feel so far from God." In fact is I think that everything's gone not only sideways, I think everything's going totally backwards in this message. I can't understand it. I think I'll go fishing. I'll go back to my job. I'm done with this. I'm going to throw in the towel. And somebody just walks up beside you. Stand up here, Tim. How are things going? Say, well, you said good, but you got to say bad. Everything's going the wrong way. Yeah. Terrible. Have you had some disappointments? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Terrible. And it's the greatest week. Do you know what? I'm almost resurrected, but one day we'll walk along like this. I I I I want to go with you in the rapture. But just in case, expect me to come along on your shoulder &gt;&gt; and they're walking along. And brother Brandaman, Christ is the mystery of God revealed, which is talking there about the seventh seal and the coming and the secret mystery of his coming. And I wish I had time to go into it. I have in my notes, but I haven't got time. But then he comes right into the two men on the WAY TO EMMAS. WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; AND THEY DIDN'T REALIZE, BUT THEY WERE INTERPRETING THE SCRIPTURE. HERE WE ARE PREACHING ABOVE THEM. THEY WEREN'T PREACHING. THEY WEREN'T REJOICING. THEY WEREN'T HAPPY. THEY WERE SAD. AND WE'RE REJOICING BECAUSE THEY HAD A SAD TIME. &gt;&gt; WE'RE REJOICING BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT EVERYTHING fell apart. And here we are up at this end knowing that it was the conclusion of the most glorious moment [Applause] &gt;&gt; friends. This is a reality. &gt;&gt; This is true &gt;&gt; and you can't interpret what's happening in your life. YOU JUST CANNOT INTERPRET IT. But it is God himself that's interpreting it. And things go this way, they go that way. They go every direction. But don't try to interpret it yourself. It's God who's put the power and the potentials in the seed to BRING FORTH WHAT HE DESIRES AT THIS time in this season. I have to close because I said I would close, but I would like to I'd like to even say more. &gt;&gt; I was ready to get into a closet, too, and thank God for Joseph. how he just stayed so true, &gt;&gt; how he represented the first coming of Jesus and the second coming. And he represented a time that you and I are chosen. I'm saying this, friends, because I sincerely do not believe that we grasp really what this message is all about. But you stay in that channel. &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're all here. I'm looking at different ones and I'm rejoicing in my heart that you're here. Thankful you're here, Brother Jim. Not out driving. Thankful that the school teachers are here. I've been yearning in my heart that I be able to say this to you. You're God's gift. You might not feel every day, well, I'm fulfilling thus sayeth the Lord. But the segments in your life and you may notice just when you say a certain thing, Brother Terry, Mr. Tatch, you just say something to the students. You just say something. This man is saying something to me, Brother Randy Snow, and he's saying, "I just want to do something. I don't know what to do. I want to do something." He said, "There's men that want to I know all kinds of wealthy MEN," HE SAID. THEY And they're ready to do something. I've talked to him, but he has no plan, no program. He doesn't know where to go. Thought I got to put him in touch. You might think, "I'm so insignificant. I'm so simple. I'm I'm so insignificant. You could be the boy with the lunch &gt;&gt; and the loaves and the fishes and be put in the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I saw you young people at the thing at the school the other night and I'm so moved. I'm so thankful we can have that kind of an atmosphere. I want to say to you as believers, don't ever forget this. You are called to the highest calling that a human can experience. &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand with me? Dear heavenly father, this has been a sacred time for me. Begin to venture out, is it into areas of the mystery and the secret of your coming and then also to be able to bring it to the people that we are part of. We are an integral part of we are living out a part of that coming as your messenger has said. What good would it be if he came to preach if there was no one to believe it? &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; dear father by the Holy Spirit. You knew there would be people who would believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm with people that believe it. I'm so privileged to just walk with them and to be a part of them. I pray your blessings upon their homes in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray your blessings upon their individual lives in the name of Jesus Christ. And if they go through a hardship and difficulty, they shall go through it for the glory of Jesus Christ and for the kingdom of God. And we say, Lord, let thy kingdom come. A kingdom of righteousness, a kingdom of holiness, Lord, a kingdom that you have ordained shall come into being into place. And here we are as the people, the third Exodus people. I pray, Father, there will be a quickening within the very uh very depths of the soul of the people. May they ponder these things that have been said. I pray they will go back and read concerning Joseph and see themselves there, realizing, oh, Father, that there are certain things we do see and there are other things that we do not see, Lord. And in in the in your coming, there are things that have been spoken. They've been unsealed and we see them. We understand them. We understand that verbal interpretation as far as it takes us. But then there is that secret part which you have not made known to us. But you want us to trust you to have confidence just to believe THAT GOD WHO CALLED ME, he is working these things out in my life, he has ordained this for me. And I thank you for it. I thank you for the good times. I thank you for the bad times. We thank you for one another. I thank you, Father, for the people that have prayed and the people that we shake hands with and the fact that we can be together here in this place to give you praise and glory. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. For thee all the follyies of sin I resign. My gracious redeemer, my savior, art thou, if ever I love thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; My Jesus is now. Thank you, Lord, for this word. &gt;&gt; Thank you for this treasure that we have. And I pray, Father, your Holy Spirit to abide upon all, upon the young men that will be baptized tonight. I pray, oh God, the Holy Ghost will come upon them, fill them, use them, Lord. Point their life in a direction, Lord. And may this be an evening that they will never forget the word that our brother Tim Dodd will preach tonight. I pray, oh God, that the sheep will not only be fed, but built up and benefited. And may the Holy Ghost come in behind with signs and wonders following the the supernatural accompany your word. Father, in the name of Jesus, we ask it. Amen. I wonder if we could have a song. Uh perhaps we could sing that verse. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. Lift it up now as we sing it. My heart. [Applause] For the glory, all savior I reside. My gracious, my savior. [Music] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. I love thee as me and my heart on earth. My love for [Music] the Lord of my life ever my Jesus be and I'd like to sing the great emancipator like a lost sheep. I was wandering the just sing a verse or two of this. I once uh the great emancipator. Let's sing the chorus first. Oh, how we thank you Lord. Blessed be his holy name. of peace and brave and supreme. And that song and my heart and soul. Yes, it was my life Jesus. Let's give him praise. Great. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Worship him all glory glory [Music] glory the name of Jesus Christ be his holy name holy name oh he's the gra [Music] and bless the for the glory and like I was I was so [Music] seeking shepherd Thank God [Music] my father my father glory glory thankless [Music] max. That's the song. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many here remember brother Amy Mulan? Raise your hands. Many. How many don't know him in this place? More don't know him. This was one of Amy's favorite songs and my heart is so touched. That last verse was him. Like a lost lamb I was drifting. He was a Catholic. He was an alcoholic. He tried everything. His family gave up on him. Don't want nothing more to do with him. He was hopeless, a hopeless alcoholic. His brother told him about this message. He came to the log church. He told me he was delivered instantly. He called his mom over in Vancouver Island and said, "I'm delivered. I'm free." She said, "Oh." Said, "Don't I've heard that before. Don't don't talk to me about it." He came to me. He's like Joseph. He was down in the pit. He said, "They don't believe me. They don't believe anything. I don't have any confidence. What should I do?" I said, "Call her in 6 months." Okay. In 6 months, he called, "Mom, I'm still here. Still me. I'm still delivered. I'm still saved." Ah, she said, "I don't want to have anything to do with it." He said, "What' I do? He come back." He now he's really discouraged. I said, "Wait a year." A year went by. They still didn't want to. Now they're finally having to come around. There's something to it. He said, "Brother, brother Ed, when I came to this message," he says, "Things raced through my mind and I could find I could find all kinds of things wrong with it." But he said, "I knew one thing. This was the only thing that delivered me." He's crossed over. &gt;&gt; Brother Mike, [Music] probably sister Cindy, &gt;&gt; Brother Amy, shaking hands, waiting for us. Kids, you might be 8, 10, 12.
