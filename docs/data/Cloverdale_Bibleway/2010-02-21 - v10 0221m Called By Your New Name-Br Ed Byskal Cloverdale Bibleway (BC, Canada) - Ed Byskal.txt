Can't you see why I'm happy as Sister Jabber comes singing for us this morning? Can't you see why I'm so happy I accepted the word of the Lord? The revealer that was spoken by the prophet on it. [Music] I've truly known the good life filled with family and friends. I've been blessed with more than my share. But in the heart of my heart, I know there's more for me. So much more than this faded world I'm in. It's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. The more I see of this life, the less it means to me. And it's Jesus I really want to see. I've been a lot of places and I've known the great and small. I've seen the grand and noble works of man. Yet with all of my good fortune, my heart is sinking still. Oh, I just can't deny the longing there. It's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. The more I see of this world, the less it means to me. And it's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. The more I see of this world, the less it means to me. And it's Jesus I really want to see. It's Jesus I really want to see. [Applause] That's your desire this morning. &gt;&gt; I believe we'll see him in his word this morning. That's where we'll look for him. Amen. And in one another. Amen. Let's stand together as we get ready to turn to the word this morning. And I want to sing, of course, I can almost see the lights of that city. I see them gathering around the great throne. Now, I have to tell you about this song. There's only one way to sing this song. That's with your eyes closed and your hands raised. And just imagine, you know, have you ever been traveling and you've been a long way from home and you see the glow of the city way off and you're thinking, "I'm almost home." That's where we are this morning. I can almost see the lights of that city. I see them gathering around that great white throne. Amen. Let's sing it together. [Music] I can almost [Music] see the lights on that city. I see them gathering all around the great white road. to faith in my Savior and his wonderful love. Well, I can almost see the light fall. John tells of the city that he saw coming down where no for death will be known. And someday we will go there through his marvelous grace forever live in the heavenly home. [Music] Well, I can almost see the lights of that city. I see them gathering all around the great white [Music] in my savior and his wonderful love. Oh, I can almost see the light fall. [Music] Well, sometimes when I'm burdened and my cross is hard to bear and oh, Satan, he tries to deal my will. I just look unto Jesus. He is standing close by and once again his great light are shining through. Oh, I can almost see the lights on that city. I see the gathering all around the great white ro [Music] my savior and his wonderful love when I can almost see the light of well sometimes when I'm burdened and my cross seems hard to bear and go Satan. He tries to dim my view. I just look unto Jesus. He is standing close by. And once again his great light shine through. And I almost see the light on the city. I see all around the great ro [Music] my [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. That's what's nice to have in our vision. &gt;&gt; Lights of home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you. I'd like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, those that are present and those that are far away, wherever they are, wherever they're streaming. We just here right after the service people are uh writing in email or phoning mostly email and just saying how how much they appreciate being able to join with with you and they ask about different ones and different ones who perhaps sang or whatever more and where they're sitting. And so I just want to greet all that are streaming also in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Won't it be wonderful &gt;&gt; at that ultimate final gathering and we won't be you know leaving church as such and going our own directions but we'll be gathered forever together. Amen. Now I just want to make a couple comments before we read. We're going to sing another chorus song and chorus, but uh I see that the seats are pretty well full, but if you want to move and get a little bit closer, it'll be fine. I I've got a lot of material on the slides today, and I I believe that most of you can see. I try to make the uh uh my printing large so you can follow it, but it'll be very important to follow. And um so I just want you to uh you know be able to Satan has fought this uh this message. He has really really fought it and uh in in a in a in a just a literal way. you know, I I got in into the study and the brothers always ask for, you know, the title of the message and the scriptures of the people are streaming can also follow along and and there's some very very striking things that brother Brandham has said and striking things that Apostle Paul said and I wanted those highlighted and uh my printer just decided not to print the red part. So, so you know what I have to do? I have to run back to the study. And God bless brother Aaron. He said, "You all right?" And I said, "Well, I have to write all this by hand." And I was just about done. And I thought, "You devil, uh, you know, I'm just going to preach that much harder. I'm just going to I'm going to have the people pray." And that's why I'm saying this to you. And what I want you to do when we have prayer before we come to the word, I would ask you specifically if you would pray for yourself and pray that God will give you the spirit of revelation and that you'll pray for me and pray that God will give me the freedom to speak and I believe we'll have a wonderful time in his presence. Amen. Uh, I just like to sing the last verse. I believe it's the last verse of blessed assurance. It's as because it was coming to me almost in my sleep this morning. Perfect submission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All is at rest. I and my savior. So wonderfully blessed. So let's sing that together, would you please? [Music] Perfect. All is at rest. I in my Savior and so happy and blessed. and waiting [Music] with his. [Music] This is my story. This is my song praising my [Music] all day long. This is my soul. This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. Let's just join our hearts together in prayer and do pray. God grant to me the spirit of revelation. May the Holy Spirit, Father, I'm praying that as each one enters into prayer and they express it by speaking to you now, we're in prayer. And this is the house of prayer. You have called it that. We call it a sanctuary, but it's a house of prayer. It's a house of correction. It's a house of comfort. It's a house of edifying. It's a house where the Holy Spirit, Lord, will come to the people and do your office work in each of our lives. I'm praying, oh God, that you will take the speaker into your hand, oh God, into your supreme control, oh God, and you will bind the enemy which so wants to hinder your word. I pray that you'll release with a mighty release, oh God, the spirit of God upon the people, and take the word dividing it to each individual, Lord, that it might just be planted deep within our hearts. Father, you did not send us messenger in vain. You sent the prophet of God that he might speak what we need to hear. Oh, bless our precious loved ones and friends, oh God, that are in the different countries and streaming right at this moment. For some, it's evening and for others it's afternoon. But Lord, we know that we've entered into a morning time. It's good morning to the bride. Lord, I pray that you'll bless the bride of Jesus Christ in your wonderful and glorious name. And may the name of Jesus Christ be glorified. I pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be reading out of uh uh Romans the 11th chapter. And uh when we're done reading, keep your Bible if you would open because I'll have you have your seats then. And I'm going to put certain scriptures out of Romans 11 on the screen because I just put them in a certain I put them in a certain order and I just want to read them in that continuity of how uh uh in in order to help the uh help us to have our thoughts together this morning. I'll read from Romans 11 and we'll start at verse 26 down to 33. And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written, there shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Father's sake. For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance. Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out. Amen. May God bless his word to our hearts. as you have your seats and you'll keep your Bibles now open and ready. We are all very familiar with this scripture uh and brother Brandham quotes it many many times for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. And I'm going to dwell very much on the calling of God. And it will come from some very different and strange perhaps directions for you. But think of it now, the calling of God. That's not one person calling to another, but it's the calling of God. God doing the calling. And then we could ask right away, who is he calling to or what is he calling to? uh because uh you know all nature the Bible even says that uh all all all natures there's no sound without significance. So, and then when God was speaking to Job, he asked him about the animal kingdom and the life and he said, "Do do you, you know, when the young welps and the lions and so on and when the birds and he spoke of different creatures, do you hear them? Do you know what they're saying?" And and Job was so he was confounded. He because he doesn't know what these things are. But all of this all of these sounds of even of the creatures, God knows exactly what they're saying. &gt;&gt; And he knows what the what the sound is all about. So the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. I want to first just set the stage a wee bit that I'd like now to put that scripture into the context of where it is in the scripture because the apostle Paul even from chapter 10 of you don't have to turn to it but even from chapter 10 now this is just set having the setting he starts out with chapter 10 he says brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved. Now, so he's he's on to he's on to the people of Israel that they were the called of God. They were the elect of God. And then he comes on into chapter 11. And uh he begins in chapter 11 by by saying, I say then hath God cast away his people. This is the context. Are the people of God cast away? Uh, God forbid, for I also am an Israelite. And so I'm going to have you read some of this with me. Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people which he forneew. So now he has a reason for saying that, you know, is is this all all that has transpired and now the Jewish people have rejected Jesus Christ. He's just been crucified not that long before and and they've rejected him and and uh uh Paul knows exactly the scripture that because they have rejected him but he's wanting to bring has God cast them away uh those that he forneew and I'm going to five even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. Right. &gt;&gt; What then? Uh, Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. According, as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this day. So now this is the reason that it appears as though they've been cast off because God has given them the eyes of slumber that they should not see. I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness? I want to I'm going to take a portion of this service today to speak of their diminishing the diminishing of the Jews which all had a part of bringing uh bringing the gospel uh to us. For if the casting away, see now he spoke of the diminishing of them. He speaks of them having stumbled and and fell and and being cast off. But has God cast them away? For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead? For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy. And if the root be holy, so are the branches. &gt;&gt; But if some of the branches were broken off, now he's on the same theme. They stumbled, they fell, they were cast off, now he's on the branches. The branches have been broken. And he's still speaking about the nation. He's still keeping the same theme. If the branches be broken off, and thou us Gentiles being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among among them, and with them partakers of the root and the fatness of the of the olive tree. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happen to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles become in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, there shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins, as concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes. But as touching the election, they are beloved for the Father's sake. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Now, isn't that a little different slant for many because we just have referred to, well, the gifts and calling of God are are without repentance and a prophet. He He's a prophet because he's born that way. And the ministry are are sent and they have they are born that way. And we all uh we all have our gifts and our talents and we're born that way. And God's not going to take them back for the gifts and calling of God. Now, the calling of God on Israel, Apostle Paul is speaking of the nation of the people of Israel. They've stumbled, they fell, they've been broken off, they've rejected, and all of these things. Has God cast them away? Has he done? No. He's saying because the gifts and the calling of God. So now God is calling to something that even is the Jewish people or Israel themselves don't understand. I will bring it down right to ourselves uh individually. We have certain spiritual we might call them desires. We have some spiritual ambition. We have some spiritual hunger. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after. We have spiritual cravings. We have spiritual yearnings &gt;&gt; that we don't even understand. Now I believe for the elect of God, I'm just bringing this to you quickly. For the elect of God, God has placed in the seed. Let every seed bring forth after its own kind. So God has placed in the seed that eternal life seed that you came into the world. You possessed it even though you didn't know it. You perhaps wandered in the world. You wandered into this religion or that denomination or this spiritual looking, thirsting, craving. Where is it? This reality. You're in the world and perhaps trying to fill your belly full of things in the world. And even then, we're saying this isn't it, but where is it? What is it that I'm craving for? Now, now that is God put that nature in that seed. He put that craving in that seed so that it would respond to the calling of God because God is calling to it. He's calling because he knows what that is going to become. And so he keeps calling to it. Now here I'm taking the natural seed, the Jewish people, and God's calling to them. And and if you can follow this then it will be a a great uh benefit to us. Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How uncarchable are his judgment and his ways past finding out. Now I need to unite another thought uh to the subject at this point. And I'm just going to interject this and that is when we think in terms of uh uh uh someone being called, you know, well, someone called me or or I'm calling someone. We usually associate a name with that calling. Uh and so we have a name. I I'd like to really try and and have you get out of the box of of our normal type of thinking. Now, each of us have a name, but I became very very interested and I have been for a long time realizing that a name is associated with the life that we live. And I've used a simple example and I've gi I've given it to so many of of you and others that have been baptized in this tank and I have spoken to them privately. And I go to uh Romans the 6th chapter and saying that we that are dead, how that we how is it that we that are dead to sin live any longer in it? We're dead because we're baptized into into Jesus Christ. And I asked the question, how is it that you're baptized? I know that you can be baptized. I understand you can be baptized in water. You can be baptized in the Holy Spirit because you're just completely uh uh completely uh immersed in it. But how are you baptized into a person? How are you baptized into this person? Jesus Christ is a being. This is a person. How are we baptized into a person? Well, it's because we take on uh by a supernatural divine act. We take on a part of his life. There's a portion of this word that's given for you each individually to live out. God has ordained that you will live out a portion of the life of Jesus Christ. He only lived a little sliver of this space of time. for 33 years he lived and he only ministered 33 and a2 years of that time such a small and yet he is the main theme he's the main person of this entire Bible from cover to cover and so there are shadows and particular uh in the old testament you know there is shadows of him there's god has given indications of his life and so on and even when the people were living it they didn't know that they were living it because they were actually living out and acting out a part of Jesus Christ in a shadow, but it was not even known to them. Now, here we are on the other side and and we're, you know, we're not just here to earn a living and and and and go from a point A of birth and point, you know, Z or zed of of of at our death. That's that's not our purpose on earth. our purpose. We have been called by God to come here and live out a portion of the life of Jesus Christ. And it is that portion that God is calling to. And and and so now when we come to the name, you know, when you were born, our parents thought, well, you know, try to look at you and say, what do we call this child? And brother Brandham talks about names and we put some uh uh reference uh and importance to the name. But I just want to say this to you. A name is not uh just a word. We say Jesus here. You go overseas, they don't know what Jesus means. You go to someone and they'll say yau. So it's a different phrase. It's it's but but when you say Jesus and they say yesu, you're thinking of the same person. You you you've got the same concept. Now most of you know that the Jews they do not write the word God. They leave the O out of God and just have G dash D. The reason for that is the Jewish people have such a deep respect for the name of God. They do not believe that a human is worthy to utter it because the name does not speak of just a a a a word that describes a person. It's not just to call a person but the name is is that being or that person their reputation. It is that they say uh the scripture refers to and I'll come to it later on. A good name is more to be desired than great riches. What is a good name? It's a reputation. And what is a reputation? It's a life that you live. So the name really the essence of the name is the life that you and I live. You can turn the lights back on if you would please and then because I'll come back to the rest of the slides later on. So, and so when the when the when God in the scripture named say Abraham Abram and he said to Abram get out from your land etc etc and then he made promises to him and so I'm going to come to it later on so I don't want to get too deep into it right at this moment but then when he came to uh he he told him he was going to have a son but when the time came that the promise should be given when the promise should be given and should come about then God changed his name and inserted part of deity in his name and inserted part of deity the letter H into Sarah's name not so that Sarah would be you know it was Sarai now it's Sarah it is Abram now it's Abraham it's not just that his name should sound different what God was saying is You are going to live a different life. &gt;&gt; You are going to produce something you couldn't produce before. Your future is going to be changed from what you have been all of these years. It's going to be different because deity now has become a part of you &gt;&gt; and that's going to be that's going to make all the difference. So the name is not merely a word and and I have here taken a a a thought as far as the Hebrews were concerned. The name of God was therefore not a mere word and please just hang on to these things very fervently and zealously this morning. But the whole of the divine manifestation. So the name whether you say Jesus or you say Elohim, Elohim or Adoni or any of these other titles and names of God for God had many names. But it it was not that. It was it had reference to the whole of the divine manifestation the character of God as revealed in his relations to his people and in his dealings with them. Now, uh I'll read a scripture later on too. I'm just laying all of this broad foundation. Like it says in the time of Moses, God Moses asked to see God's face. He wanted to know him more. So he said uh uh uh you can't see my face, but I'll proclaim the name of the Lord. God spoke to him. I'll proclaim the name of the Lord for he is gracious and he will show mercy and so on so forth. What's he saying? that his name is associated with his attributes. He's going to show mercy. He's going to he's going to be something more than they knew of this God. &gt;&gt; And that's how they will know. It's not that his name was gracious or his name was mercy or his name but it was it was the name of the Lord but he said I'll proclaim it. The pro proclamation or proclaiming the name was that God was showing a whole new dimension of mercy to the people because God had been held in such fear and reverence and and and reverence is fine but fear that you know he it it's all judgment and he's going to come with such judgment and and justice that and he has that but he wanted them to know that he's also a god of justice. not only justice, but he's a god of grace and he's a god of mercy and I'll proclaim my name. &gt;&gt; That was the proclamation of his name. He was his name is not just he didn't he say well now you're going to say this and that'll be my name. No, it has nothing to do with that. It's the life that you live in and a human person. If you went down uh and and when I'm at when I'm counseling people about baptism, I say uh the name is is the life and you're baptized into the person you're baptized. We immerse you into and that's why we say you come up to live the life of Jesus Christ. You're dead. The old man is dead and a new man lives and a new man with a new life. And it's all through the message. Brother Brandham said, "If if I had the life of uh Dillinger in me, I'd be a criminal. If I had the life of Bach in me, I'll write music. If I had the light life of de Leonardo da Vinci in me, I will I will paint great great artwork because you have to because the life is actually calling for that to happen. That's what was in the seed in that natural human seed came out with those abilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the name in the scripture to call your name, the name is used in my message this morning is called by your new name. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; The name in the in the Hebrew now or rather in the Greek was the name is used for everything which the name covers. The name is everything. It is the thought or feeling of which is aroused in the mind by mentioning the name. You you you mention some person's name and they'll say, "Oh yeah, that fellow." I said to people, if you went to a graveyard and and I'm gone and passed on, you'll say, you know, here lies Edward Biscll and so on so forth. They say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, he didn't he had live in an old white house over here on 176th Street or Yeah, though he was connected with that log church. What? It's not it's not the name how it sounds. Edward F. Biscll that doesn't mean anything. It is what that person did. &gt;&gt; They're good, they're bad, and all the rest of it. They say, "Oh, I remember him. He shafted me one day. He took me to the cleaners." And that's the thing they remember. Or they say, you know what, he spoke to me one day about Christ and I never I never felt so affected. You know, oh, he pastored a church and I was in that church two or three times and I never had a feeling like that. You have all kinds of different things which are conjured in the mind from the sound of the name. So the name is not a word. The name is a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we're called by your new name or called by your new life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And the name is also it can it can serve as one's rank or their authority or their interests or their pleasure or deeds their deeds or whatever more. Now to the Greeks and this is in JP vine uh to the Greeks this meant and this was the name and the name is connected to knowledge to know something of that person and so to the Greeks this meant to know facts if you had knew facts but these facts may not affect one's conduct when you gain knowledge Janosco to know. Oh, I know something. And to the Greeks just they love knowledge. The scripture says, "Oh, they would learn this and they would learn that." They like to get together to gain knowledge. And and a lot of people in the message are that way. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to hear something new and new revel. Whoa, I never heard it that way before. Isn't that incredible? And oh, it is so wonderful and it's it's intoxicating and it's inspiring and it's exciting and and and if you can be made to believe this is a new revelation. You never heard this one before. You've never heard this one preached before. And this is so exclusive. It only comes from one person. You got to be sure and hear their tape. &gt;&gt; Have you heard it? You got to be sure in here that you read their message and it and actually would finally take precedent over the prophet's message. I say beware of that spirit. Be careful of that one. It's not as exciting as you think. But it's knowledge. Knowledge. Knowledge. But to the Jews, it's not merely knowledge. To the Jew, true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct. Amen. &gt;&gt; One did not know something until that fact. Now you didn't know something. Are you listening? You do not know something until that fact has worked has a practical outworking in your life. &gt;&gt; That's when you know something. Brother Brandon, when he was finished preaching the seals, he said to Billy Paul, "And this what Billy has said, did do you understand that?" "Yeah." "Yeah, I understood it." "Yeah." He said, "Billy, did you understand it?" "Yeah, yeah, Daddy, I I understood it, Billy, did you really understand what I was saying?" He said, "No, Dad, I didn't understand it." That's right. &gt;&gt; That's about the way it is sometime. You know, go God is our fathers. He's trying to teach us something. Did you understand that? Yeah, I think I got it. I think I understand it. Do you? And he asks us over and over, do we understand it? Well, it's not known until it actually begins to have an outworking in a person's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And this is in in Jewish thought. Please excuse me just giving this long introduction. In Jewish thought, a name is not merely an arbitrary designation or a random combination of sounds because your name is has got certain sounds. to the to the Hebrews. That's not what a name was. The name conveys the nature and essence of the thing named. If if I say lion, you don't think of a little mouse running across the floor, &gt;&gt; right? you think of something that's you know most powerful and roars and makes everything tremble because the name uh uh conveys the nature and the essence of the thing named and that is why Adam named all the animals and it's spoken of in the scripture because that was important he named them after their nature and and the kind of life the kind of abilities the kind of talents the kind of creature that they wear, it represents the history and reputation of the being named and it goes on to say uh when we refer to a person's reputation as a good name. Oh, he has a good name. What are we saying? When a company is sold, they may be sold in in the in the assets of the company, they say, well, part of it is their goodwill. What is their goodwill? It's their reputation and that's associated with the name of the company. say, "Well, we're buying this company and and we're buying we we also want the name and the goodwill." If you get the goodwill, then you get the name. If the company has not got a good reputation, you don't want to be associated with that name. So, you can have the name. I'll just purchase, you know, whatever of the of of the company. in uh in Exodus 3, you don't have to turn to it, but Moses, you'll remember very very well when Moses asked God, "What's his name?" He said, Moses said, "Who shall I say sent me?" When I come and tell the people, "I've met you and this is what God has said, who will I say sent me?" It isn't that he expected God to say, "S say Jehovah sent you. That wasn't it at all. That isn't even what Moses was asking. What kind of a person is it? What kind of a being are you? Who is sending me? What kind of a what kind of a being? What is your nature? What is your intent? What is it you what is it that you want to do? How will I say who sent me? What is my purpose of going? And brother Brandham refers to that. He said uh and so Moses asked God what his name is. Moses is not asking what should I call you. Rather he's asking who are you? What are you like? And what have you done? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of a being are you? &gt;&gt; And and that is clear from God's response. God replies that he's eternal. I'm the God of Abraham. I'm the God of Isaac. I'm the God of Jacob. So, he's placing himself way back. He's showing that he's eternal and he's showing that he's present. He said it it's clear from his response that he's eternal, that he is the God of our ancestors, that he has seen our affliction. He's I he I've seen their affliction and I will redeem them from bondage. &gt;&gt; And now Moses has a concept of who it is that's talking to him. This is who I have been. Uh Moses wor Abraham worshiped me. Isaac worshiped me. Jacob worshiped me. And now I've heard these people. I've heard their cry. And so he's he's a God of of of hearing. He's a God that's alive. He's a God that's touched with the bondage of the people. And he's a God of power. And he's a God that's present. And I've come down now to do something. And I'm sending you to do it. Oh, this is the kind of being. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So now he has a completely different concept of who God is. And so he he goes out. So So God to him is got a new name, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just the sound of some some verbiage or some syllable, etc. So God is calling to the life that is in you by predestination. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say that again. God is calling. You say that you you say, "Well, why are you here today, you're here?" I would say you are sitting here because God at some point called to you, &gt;&gt; did he not? &gt;&gt; You might even remember where that happened first. But you are some came right out of sin, some came out of religion, some came out of very good homes. Many of you young people etc. You have come out of godly homes with believers and Christian parents. You've come in that kind of an atmosphere. But you there will be some time as I did. I had a very godly home. But there was a time when I began to be awakened inside personally and God be to call me and talk to me. &gt;&gt; Every man, every woman, every child must experience that. And then he's he's not calling you to change your name necessarily. It's something different. What he's doing is calling you to another life. Right. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I'm I'm not I'm not speaking now about person's name and and uh you know what we call our name. And brother Brandham says, you know, if a child's name is Ricky, don't call him that. I believe that we should call our children good godly names. But I'm not on that subject today. I'm on something quite different. So now, let me make this statement again. God is calling I want to I want you to know today I'm announcing this to you which might make known some of the things you have experienced but even more so what you will experience and what we are experienced and why the message come. God is calling to the life that is in you by predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the invisible union. He said she looked down there and she seen her baby. She screamed. It was the voice of something. Now, he's speaking about the eagle. Incidentally, just just maybe a 100 meters or 100 yards from our house is a tree. And I I shared it with uh some of the staff in the office. And it it's it's really funny, you know. It's really funny because here's these uh they build a e two eagles built a nest up there. It's a massive thing, you know, probably six, eight feet across and they just picked a place right in a a tree and it the housing development is all around and they built right there. My neighbor lives right across the street. Excuse me for taking this time, but he subdivided because he has about like an acre and his house living on the acre. And so he subdivided it right in half and and and and the back part of this lot, the front part faces our street and the back part faces a nice culde-sac and subdivision where they're making new subdivision. and and right dead across the street, right dead across the street is this great big, you know, alder tree or something and this nest up in the middle of it in a it's in a kind of a they chose a place that had several, you know, wise like that and they just rested that nest in there. And so I was talking to the neighbor across who he was building the neighbor's house because they're starting to build the man died and his widow is building this house and now it faces right up front and I thought that they were going to sell it and let someone else build at the back and uh so I'm talking to this builder. He said, "Well, no, I'm building it for, you know, for Lynn as her name." And uh he said actually she's away on a trip with my wife right now and and I'm just you know building this house for them. Oh. He says I got held up. I just was so held up. The city held me up so long months. He said they held me up. I said oh I said yeah they're you know they can be really bad. And uh I said what what they hold you up for? He said eagles. Eagles. I said pardon? He said eagles. I said excuse me. I couldn't get what he was saying. Eagles. He said, "Eagles, I got the nest up there." "Oh, yeah." I said, "Yeah, I know. There's a nest back there." Well, he says, "They wouldn't let me build here for months." He said, "I had to wait till the nest was empty and the and the birds were gone." And I and he he said, "Oh, yeah, no." He said, he said, "I had environmentalists here all the time and they won't let you build." So, then I found out that's why they had to build up to the front. They couldn't even build back there. And there's a big piece of property, probably, you know, $2 million worth of property. And it's it's I often wondered why aren't they building on that property and then then you know I begin to clue in. So I was driving there just a couple of days ago and this is February you know to the middle of February and out on this limb is a great big eagle just sitting there right over the nest and I thought goodness they're back. They're back. Whoever owns this property might as well just say goodbye to it because they're never going to be able to build. And then I looked real close and I thought I saw a little white head in the nest. And I looked. Sure enough, there's one sitting in the nest. And my wife and I drive here to church in the morning. Here's both of them sitting, you know, about 2, three feet from the nest sitting there. I said, "Isn't that funny?" You know, God, he just pulls it over on these people. You know, they're going to build big million-dollar home there. And God just says, "Not here. Not going to build it here. I'm going to have a couple eagles." But you know, they got a nature in them. &gt;&gt; They got a nature and they're just there chirping to one another and I don't think they have a clue what trouble they're causing the people on the ground. And and quite frankly, I don't think they care. But that but that just happens to be their nature. Now, Brother Brandham's telling his eagle story, and you've all heard it many, many times. Listen. He said, "She looked down there, mother eagle. She looked down there and she seen her baby and she screamed. I want to I want to just say something. Brother Bram told that many times. He had never heard that sound before. &gt;&gt; He had never heard a scream, eagle scream before. &gt;&gt; He said it was the voice of something that echoed from inside of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was there by virtue of his birth. Yes. &gt;&gt; The kind of seed or the kind of egg he was hatched from. &gt;&gt; He had the capacity to understand that because that was already in his nature. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to go to school. He didn't have to go to church. He didn't have to have a chicken or anybody else teach him. He didn't even have to have another eagle come and tell him. He had it in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He understood that scream &gt;&gt; and and he could not do what she was screaming for. She was screaming for him to come up there. She was screaming for him to come into a higher level of maturity. You actually can fly. You don't have to be on that dung pile anymore. You can actually fly out of this mess up into the heavens. and and and he's but he's never done it before. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, let a real predestinated &gt;&gt; born germ predestinated by God hear the word of God. It's music to him. &gt;&gt; You maybe never heard it before, but it is a music to him." &gt;&gt; Praise God. He knows it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Mama, it sounds real. &gt;&gt; How am I going to get out of this? &gt;&gt; Just make a jump. &gt;&gt; And I'll catch you. &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do." He said, "The anointed word of God being vindicated before any man that's been born as a son of God with the predestinated germ into him for this hour, he'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll see it as sure as there's a God in heaven. And if you're a son or a daughter of God, you have it in you because it came by your spiritual birth. [Music] &gt;&gt; I may be getting ahead of myself. Abraham Abram was called of God and told to leave his country and to go to a place I'll show you and he left immediately. &gt;&gt; Lot went with him and so now he's going his wife. Now, he married, Brother Brandham said he married his young halfsister. They've been married for many years. Married for 75 years. And God didn't just start then, but God told him, "I'm going to show you a land." And God begins to Let me just ask you in all simplicity and in all truth, do you think that it was when God said to him, "I'm going to give you a seed." Do you think that was the first time he thought about having a child? No. They craved that all their lives. &gt;&gt; They desired that &gt;&gt; because they felt that was a part of, you know, their life and they they craved that. But they didn't crave it because, listen close, because as two humans, they simply want to have a baby. That's not it. They had a a deeper craving. They had a deeper calling within them because they were called to fulfill a certain part of this scripture. &gt;&gt; They were called to fulfill a a very significant part. They were called. He was called to be a father of nations, &gt;&gt; but he didn't know that. But now he's 75 and God is telling him and it and it and notice now, please, because this is important to you and I where we are, God begins to almost enchant him. You're going to have a son. Oh, well that's what I I'm going to give you a land. You're going to have a seed and at this station and another station, another station. He just keeps telling him, I'm going to bless you and through you I'm going to bless nations. I'm going to give you a seed. And he keeps telling them even till Abraham, Abraham says, "What will you give me?" &gt;&gt; You know, how will you confirm this that I'm going to have a son? And it's like God at all these different stations of his life, of your life, and he begins to speak to him things he'd never heard before. &gt;&gt; There are depths of truth &gt;&gt; in this message, which you know the phrase very well, but when you hear it, you'd say, I so wish I could attain to that. So he was he was speaking to Abraham and telling him you're going to do this and you're going to have this but he wasn't even telling him exactly how it's going to happen. And he Abraham no doubt was saying how will I do this? How can I achieve this? How can I come to this position this place? You know how's it going to happen? We see things. Let me be honest with you. We hear things in the word on a continual B. We hear about a life in Christ and you go home and go out of this place and maybe even while you're sitting listening to the word, you say, "Well, I know it's there and I know that the prophet of God spoke it and I know it, but I just haven't seem to achieve it. I haven't seemed to attain to it. I go month after month and year after year and it seems to be the same thing. I don't seem to attain to it. In fact is there's times when be honest with me now or I'll be honest to you. There are times when you say I'm lower now than I've ever been. I haven't been gaining ground. I've been losing ground. At least that's what it seems like to me. And God kept telling Abraham, "You're going to have it." Finally, his wife and you know in whatever frustration or whatever went on in their private life and so on says, "Well, take Hagar. Have a child with Hagar." And and she did. It was all part of the scripture. and he has a child with Hagar and and comes Ishmael into the world and we've had a lot of trouble ever since. &gt;&gt; But that was all part of the program. It never changed God's mind about Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "You're a son. &gt;&gt; You'll always be a son. &gt;&gt; You're a daughter. You'll always be a daughter." I'm going to read a quote for you if I have time later on. He says, "I I I'm a sinner, but I'm an heir." &gt;&gt; I may be a drunkard, but I'm an heir. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's what was important. &gt;&gt; And God had already identified, Abram, you're going to have a son. Whether you take Hagar and have another son and have Ishmael and have other children, that's irrelevant. It's what's in my mind. It's what's in God's mind. And that's what God was calling to. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. God will not change his mind. &gt;&gt; He's not going to say at some point in time, I'm sorry I called you. And brother Brandham talks about the two books. He talks about the book of life and our deeds are written in the book of life. But there's another book called the called the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; And he talks about our first nature that came by our natural birth. &gt;&gt; And so now listen, this will help us as we go along. While we are living in this cornal flesh, while we're living in the flesh is weak. Jesus said, "It was weak when he said it and it's still weak. The flesh is always weak. While we live with these prickles and stickers while we try to deal with the weaknesses and the frailties and perhaps the things we inherited, but don't blame everything on your parents." And we have these &gt;&gt; and they start showing up even with the children when you're young. Certain certain things start showing up. And we have these things. And don't anybody look too sanctimonious here because I'm prepared to say everybody has it. &gt;&gt; We have something we wish we were rid of. &gt;&gt; But let me say this to you. Even while we're in this body of flesh, even while we're in this humanity which is subjected to our environment and everything around, those elected that God has put a seed in, listen to me very close. Those elected that God has put a seed in, that seed has its own nature. &gt;&gt; And that nature did not come from your parents. That nature came from our heavenly parent which is God himself. &gt;&gt; And God will never apologize for putting his seed in the elected children. &gt;&gt; Never will he apologize. And never will he change his mind about what he plans to do and where that seed is going to go. And because he's going to keep calling for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's something you can't repent over. You can't say I've had I've had pastor's wife say to me, "I don't want to be a minister's wife." One said, "I don't want to live in a fishbowl and have people everybody looking at me because I hold a certain standard for a minister's wife. I don't want to live in it." But that wouldn't change the fact that she was that. And so God kept calling to Abram and later Abraham. And even in chapter 18 of of uh Genesis, God appeared to him again and told him after their conversation together, God always comes back to the same subject. &gt;&gt; You're going to have a son. Right. &gt;&gt; And now he's been waiting another 25 years. &gt;&gt; And he's no closer to it than he was when he first heard it. &gt;&gt; And he's no closer to it than he was when he desired it maybe as a young man &gt;&gt; with his wife Sarah. Right? &gt;&gt; You see, friends and believers in God's economy, things can go very, very backwards or sideways, but it will make no difference to God. &gt;&gt; And I'm back at that little eagle story. And this is where some of this became inspired. How am I going to do it? He already had it in him. Even even before he heard the scream, &gt;&gt; he had wings to do the flying with, but he hadn't heard the voice to call him &gt;&gt; to a higher life. &gt;&gt; And you can do it. And all they had to hear some of the things. And I hear things in the message. Quite frankly, I'm being very, very honest. I'm going to be very, very open with you this morning. I hear things in the message and I hear brother Brandham express the depths of spiritual love and holiness and how he would speak about brethren and and I just say I'm not there yet. And I hear him speak and give instruction about how we should treat one another and how we should so respect the house of God and how we should conduct ourselves and how we should give and how we should forgive one another and how all of these things and when I try to measure to the message I have to admit I fall short. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You understand? &gt;&gt; But I have confidence this morning and I came to make this announcement. The seed that is in you and has the capacity for what God is calling it too. &gt;&gt; And you would not have that desire unless God had put it in the seed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And so we're not here to put on some facade like we've arrived. No, we know folks that in in a lot of ways, you know, that's why we crave for the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's why we crave for the millennium. &gt;&gt; Because we know this struggle will be done. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you today, you can have absolute full assurance when you know that you have responded to the voice of God. You heard the eagle scream. You've responded to it. Maybe you haven't taken wings into the heavenlies yet, but the fact that you responded, I can tell you that you have the capacity within you &gt;&gt; to take wings into the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir. &gt;&gt; Notice what the scripture says. God is calling to a life that's in you. The calling of God, the gifts and calling of God is without repentance. &gt;&gt; Paul said in Romans, for the earnest expectation, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I really need your keen attention. &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the creature, &gt;&gt; would the creature happen to be you and I? for the earnest expectation of the creature uh waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. Why are they waiting? Cuz they haven't seen it yet. But there are creatures that are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. Who put that waiting? Who put that earnest expectation in there? It was in the seed. It was a part of their spiritual makeup. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he went on to say, for the creature was made subject to vanity. For the creature was made subject to vanity. What is what is vanity? It's emptiness. &gt;&gt; All vanity. Vanity. All is vanity, said the preacher in Ecclesiastes. It's all vanity. The world is vanity. But you have to make a living. You're part of it. You go to school and you get all the education that you can and you earn what you can and you pay your bills and you make whatever decisions in life, but all is vanity when and that's why you crave for the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's why you crave for millennium. &gt;&gt; That's why you you hear about the glories of the new home and it just something said, "Oh, oh, &gt;&gt; oh, for that new home. &gt;&gt; Oh, for that place." &gt;&gt; What is it in you? You might say, "Well, everybody desires heaven." I'm not talking about heaven. Their concept of heaven doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the new home as a prophet of God has declared it to be &gt;&gt; as he who has been transported beyond the curtain of time and come back to give us a personal message. Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what age you are or what station of life you are. Don't miss it. That's why he said, "Don't miss it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you have something craving in you. You've been called to this message, have you not? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that why you're here? &gt;&gt; Have you been called by this voice of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reveal revealing of Jesus Christ. And so the revealing of him, you saw him and said, "Oh, he's altogether lovely." &gt;&gt; I've been called by him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you have, then I say without any hesitation, there's something still in you that goes much deeper and further than the life that we have lived thus far. &gt;&gt; For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly. We didn't come here saying, "Oh, I want to live in this perverted generation. &gt;&gt; I want to live in the darkness of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; I want to live in this material materialistic age." No, that isn't I want to live when you can hardly make enough to pay your bills. No, that isn't what we said. So, it wasn't willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. &gt;&gt; Because the creature itself also shall be delivered &gt;&gt; from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm taking a left. We're we're going to take a left curve. Now, &gt;&gt; how many people believe you were called? &gt;&gt; And I'm sure you also recognize God also called Israel. &gt;&gt; And that's what Apostle Paul was talking about in chapter 10, chapter 11. Have they stumbled? Have they been cast off? Did God do away with them? No. No. because the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. God's not going to change his mind about Israel. &gt;&gt; But they were darkened and God allowed some things to happen. I have I'm going to take you on a quick journey and you have to read with me. I'm going to take you from 70 AD, 70 years after Christ when Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus. I can't say that this is exactly the truth, but I I understand I visited Pompei. Anybody doesn't know what Pompei who Pompei what Pompei is. Pompea city was destroyed by I believe it's Vuvius the uh eruption of the mountain and and I've I' that was a very very wicked city it's a beautiful looks down to the ocean beautiful location and I was told by a guide that it was a city where the uh great leaders of Rome would come and it It was a festive place. It was a place of sin, deep sin. And they would come and rejoice. And I was told that Titus after destroying Jerusalem came there and and rejoiced and had his had his time of rejoicing in Pompei. And then God destroyed it about two years after that. But I will start there and I will end up in Walmart in 204. So we'll take you quickly the diminishing of them. The branches were broken off. They stumbled and God allowed them. And it was even prophesied in the Old Testament. And I have so many scriptures. I I'm trying to watch my time, but I have so many scriptures where God says, "I I I'll scatter you. I'll scatter you to all the nations." Another place he says you'll your your name will become a byword, &gt;&gt; you know, and it is &gt;&gt; now this is on internet and I want to say that I'm not I'm not I'm pro- Israel, &gt;&gt; but yet their name has become a byword. When you try to get somebody to reduce something in price, they say to Jew them down &gt;&gt; and their name has become a byword in the earth. &gt;&gt; But God also promised that he would raise it up. &gt;&gt; And so the name has become a byword in the nations of the people. He said in the scripture, and I'll just try to read the scripture again, if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them be the riches of the Gentiles. Now, this is how you got rich, through the diminishing of them. And the diminishing of them. diminishing is to find fault with them. The decrease or defeat of them, the loss of respects as as to salvation even that they're beyond salvation, they're beyond redemption. to make less or to be made inferior to overcome them or to be conquered by or forced to yield to one. This is the diminishing. Apostle Paul said the diminishing of them. In 70 AD, the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem, killed over 1 million Jews, took about a 100,000 into slavery and captivity, and scattered many from Palestine to other locations in the Roman Empire. In 135 AD, serious uh serious Roman persecution of the Jews began. They were forbidden upon pain of death from participating in circumcision, which was very important to them, reading the Torah of the Bible and eating unleavened bread at the Passover. You just put yourself there. Say, you're not allowed to have you can't have the bread at the communion table. We don't allow you to make this. And not not a misdemeanor. This was on the on the sentence of death. In 135 further, a temple dedicated to the Roman pagan god Jupiter was erected on the temple mount in Jerusalem. A temple of Venus Venus was built on Goltha just outside the city. The council of Nya in 3:25, which brother Brandham refers to this council multitudes of times, decided to separate the celebration of Easter from the Jewish Passover. They stated, "For it is unbecoming beyond measure that on this holiest of festivals, we would follow the customs of the Jews. Henceforth, let us have nothing to do, nothing in common with this odious people. We ought not, therefore, to have anything in common with the Jews. Our worship follows a more convenient course. We desire, dearest brethren, to separate ourselves from the detestable company of the Jews. How then could we follow these Jews who are almost certainly blinded? In 367 to 376, St. Hillary referred to Jews as a perverse people who God has cursed forever and St. Ephra uh refers to synagogues as brothel. Now these people who we refer to these are not some quiet people. These are not some parkbench politicians. These are people who had a lot of power had a lot of p had a lot of respect. So St. Augustine, not the one brother Brandham speaks of, that's I believe is St. Augustine of of Hippo. He wrote, "The true image of the Hebrews is Judas the Scariot who sells the Lord for silver. The Jew can never understand the scriptures and forever will bear the guilt for the death of Jesus." In 613, very serious persecution began in Spain and Jews were given the option to enter to either leaving Spain or converting to Christianity. Jewish children over 6 years of age were taken from their parents and given a Christian education. In 855, Jews were exiled from Italy. In 1078, Pope Gregory IIIth decreed that Jews could not hold office or be superiors to Christians. In 1146, the second crusade began. A French monk, Rudolph, called for the destruction of the Jews. In 1180, the king of France, uh, Philip Augustus, arbitrarily seized all Jewish property and expelled the Jews from the country. There was no legal justification for this action. They were allowed to sell all movable possessions, but their land and houses was stolen by the king. In 1205, Pope Innocent III wrote to the archbishops of Sans and Paris that the Jews by their own guilt are consigned to perpetual servitude because they crucified the Lord as slaves rejected by God. In 1290, Jews are excelled, exiled rather, from England. About 16,000 left the country. 1298 Jews were persecuted in Austria, Bavaria, and Franconia. For 140 Jewish communities were destroyed. More than 100,000 Jews were killed over a 6month period. 1306 100,000 Jews are exiled from France. They left with only the clothes on their backs and food for only one day. In 1492, Jews were given the choice of being baptized as Christians or be banished from Spain and 300,000 left Spain penniless. 1497, Jews were banished from Portugal. 20,000 left the country rather than be baptized as Christians. 1915 600,000 Jews were forcibly moved from the western borders of Russia towards the interior. About a 100,000 died of exposure or starvation. 1905, this is quite a a key part here. Secret police, Russian secret police uh converted an earlier anti-semitic novel. Now this is this this is not anything of any authority. It's a novel. It's a story. And they converted this novel into a document called the protocols of the learned elders of Zion. A Russian Orthodox priest Sergius Nelis published them publicly in 1905. It was promoted as the record of secret rebbitical conferences whose aim was to subjugate and ex exterminate the Christians. So they've taken this novel, put it into a document as to make it official and then now a priest has published it publicly and given it widespread uh circulation and and and promoted it as a record of that the rabbis have have this this is part of their document to exterminate the Christians and the protocols which they call it from here on out the protocols were used by the Ukraina and the Ukraina is the Russian secret police in a propaganda campaign that was associated with massacres of of Jews. In 1917, that's the year of the Bolevik Revolution. In the civil war following the Bolevik revolution of 1917, the reactionary white armies made extensive use of the protocols to incite widespread uh slaughters of the Jews. This isn't amazing. Widespread slaughters of of a part of humanity which has been engineered from a piece of paper which was started out as a novel. just a novel out of somebody's now get it please that novel before it became a book came out of someone's mind &gt;&gt; and I think that you could agree with me that it was no less than a demon spirit that would inspire that to some possessed person in their mind and finally it would cause this incredible uh cost of life uh on humanity and I say to you I'm just stopping here. Was God mindful of this? &gt;&gt; Has he cast them off? &gt;&gt; Are they broken branches forever? Or can he graft them on in? And here's God. Here's God who called Abraham. And these people are these people who this has been taking place to. They're of the natural seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now, in conjunction, in keeping with the message this morning, you'll have to go with me. Do you think that when they're sent out with nothing but food for one day, do you think for a minute that they're any different than you and I? &gt;&gt; Do you think for a second when 140 communities and they're being slaughtered and they're being excommunicated and they're being driven and there's all kinds of decrees coming down, you cannot be a manager. You cannot be a superior over anyone else. You've got to be a subservient. You've got to serve as a slave because the pope has said so or this pope has said so. And you find yourself, I'm just asking you, do you think that that eliminated the cry that was in them? &gt;&gt; Is where is the God of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Abraham? What have I done? Do you think the little children that are like sitting here today on this front seat and they would they would have to be taking journey the same direction under the same onslaught. Do you think they understood that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Come on folks. &gt;&gt; It might come your way one day where you'll be tested for what you believe. &gt;&gt; This is the diminishing of them. You're inferior. You have a fault. There's something wrong with this people. You have wrong intention. You have a wrong program. You are you are a blight on the on the scene of humanity. You don't have a right to exist. You shouldn't exist. And they keep hearing it down through the centuries. and 200,000 Jews were murdered in the Ukraine alone. That's that's where my forefathers came from. My grandfather had just left prior to this in the Ukraine. They left in 1901. In 1920, the protocols, now we're still talking about the same document. So, it's coming back from many years before the protocols reached England and the United States and they were exposed as a forgery but are widely circulated. Henry Ford sponsored a study of international activities of Jews and this led to a series of anti-semitic articles in the Dearbornne inter in Dearbornne Michigan it would be independent their newspaper which were published in a book the international Jew the protocols back to this novel part again were sold on Walmart's online store until they were removed on September the 21st, 2004. Now, we've come from 70 AD to 2004. And uh Walmart, and I I'm going to be careful with them. I've shoed there and bought clothes there. I have nothing against Walmart. They're great organization, I suppose. But they issued a public statement that it had not been proven uh and it had not been unquestionably proven that this novel article was indeed fake. And so they were not really apologizing, but under pressure they would remove it from what? From their storeshelves. What I'm saying is that this spirit, this spirit against the Jews, and we're not even talking about the six million that were completely rendered. I mean, they were it it was a system by which their combs were taken away so they couldn't comb their hair. Then their toothbrushes were taken away so they couldn't brush their teeth. Then their shoes were taken so that they would could have to walk bare feet. Then they couldn't they couldn't ride a bus. Uh they had to walk on the street. And if they were in a certain place and uh and another gentile was there, they had to stand up and give them their seat. They were completely reduced until they had lost their identity. &gt;&gt; You can't care for yourself physically. You can't. I'm talking about the diminishing. I'm not out of the scripture. I'm in the scripture. This is what Paul was prophesying. They're diminishing and their blindness and their breaking off and their stumbling is so that you could come in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But hath God forgotten them? God forbid. &gt;&gt; Paul says, God who allowed them to be broken off is able to graft them in again. &gt;&gt; And he said, don't be wise in our own conceits. We can't just sit here and say, well, I'm so lucky I heard this message, etc. The only thing that you have that that that the only thing that you have by God's grace is that God has given you the ability to believe the word. &gt;&gt; And remember what I spoken earlier to believe it is to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To believe it is to do it. &gt;&gt; In other words, you don't know something. You haven't come to say, "Well, I know uh I know Jesus Christ. I know this message." We don't know it until it has an outworking in our lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to me, friends, but it's not going to change anything. &gt;&gt; It won't change anything. This is God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1940, the Vichy government of France collaborated with the Nazi with Nazi Germany by freezing about 80,000 Jewish bank accounts. And during the next four years, they deported about 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps. Only about 2500 survived. It was only in 1995. That's not long ago, is it? How many here in this church were living in 1995? Would you raise your hands, please? So, you were all living when this happened. In 1995, French President Jacques Shurak was able to admit that the state bore a heavy share of responsibility in the mass roundups and deportations of Jews as well as in the property and asset seizures that were that were carried out with the act act of help in the Vichy regime. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, the riches of the world because through the fall of them they rejected the gospel. They said henceforth we go to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; That's how it happened. I've taken the Jews from that time from from Christ time even till now. But I go back to I go back to the early church at the same time. And I haven't taken the early church. We haven't got time. But if we could go back to the early church and I can tell you it's an unbroken line of faith going from the from the faith of the fathers. And that is why oh my friends I just pray that God will give me the strength and the energy. That is why the messenger of this age, the message that he was given, it says that he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers, back to the original faith. How could we be turned back to the original faith unless the original faith was exposed and made known? And so the message is is unveiling to us the original faith. And if there's anything in you that that has that God has called to that has turned you back and you could say if you can say this morning, I have been turned back to the original faith. Not bits and pieces, but I've been turned back to the original faith. You might say, I hear things and I'm so far below that. &gt;&gt; That's fine. &gt;&gt; Do you see where I'm going this morning? Through all of this, from 70 AD to 2004, we have an absolute unbroken hatred and diminishing of the Jews. &gt;&gt; It never ceased. They continued to be I had I had Jewish leaders say to me, "How can I become unchosen?" Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't it wasn't a pastor's wife saying, "I don't want to be in this fishbowl anymore. I don't want to be in this position, didn't I don't want to be, you know, uh uh viewed by everybody and examined by I don't want that." But she couldn't change it. &gt;&gt; And this and this leader in in Israel said to me right in Jerusalem, "How do I become unchosen? &gt;&gt; I don't want to be chosen. We've suffered so much, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Girsten Solomon said to me with his wife, she just stepped out and had her hand on the door on the door handle to go into the motel and and I was I was telling him, you know what brother Brandham said about the Jews, about you Jews? You know what he said about the Holocaust? He said it was the tender hand of Jehovah. You'll never hear another preacher saying that. The Holocaust, 6 million. Do you see them with nothing but their bones sticking out of their skin? I've got pictures. I've got volumes of how they constructed the buildings. I've got about six or eight volumes of the construction of the of of just uh of Awitz itself. Just that one. It's a massive construction. Thousands of people are there. And and and how they designed everything and how they designed the the ovens where they were to cremate the people. I've walked past a place where they had so many that they had slain that they just threw them into a swamp. It was incredible. And as a minister, I look at that and say the diminishing of them. Has God forgotten them? And in the context of the message today, do you think for a moment that all through that time there was nothing in them craving not just to be free from, you know, you think they didn't think about having a decent meal or just enough food or just some bread or some some soup made from cabbage or something? You think they didn't crave for that? Yes, they did. But more than that, there's an element within them that had a spiritual craving because they knew we're God's people. &gt;&gt; I don't understand this. I don't understand these hundreds of years of being diminished and being hated and being exterminated. I don't understand. How can I understand that my children are subjected to this? How can I understand that there's such pain? I can understand but they could never become unJewish. &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet brings it up so many times. They were blinded for our sake. &gt;&gt; He had such an appreciation. And this is one place I trust that we could rise to where he was today. And I don't just look at and say, "I wish I could feel that way." I want you to enter into it this morning. Thank you, Father. You blinded them so I could see. You blinded them so the gospel would come to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about the calling, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; of God. And uh and brother Brandham, I wish I had the I wish I had the time. Can you give me a little bit of time this morning? &gt;&gt; He gives a he gives a quote and he speaks about the desire that is in you. The desire that God put in you. That desire for him. God put it in you that you would crave for. You would crave for this realms of maturity. You would crave for the fulfillment of the word of God in this hour. God put it in you so that you'd crave for it. &gt;&gt; And when you don't see it, the craving still doesn't go away. &gt;&gt; When you don't attain to it, like the eagle eye, how do I fly? How do I get up there? How do I do this? Like Abraham, how do I have a child? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; How do I have a land? He told me to walk all over this land. I've I've put my footsteps all over the land, but I I'm dying with I I'm come to my dying days, and I haven't got possession of it yet. But there was something in the seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can give, if you can, if you can give, I'm going way out on a limb. If you can give up this message, I invite you to go ahead and do it. Right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Biscuit, would you say that?" Yeah, I'll say that. I'll say, "If you can give up this message, if you can just turn around and deny this, God, deny this message. Say this, William Brham is not of God, go ahead and do it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because even my invitation is not nearly as powerful. It's not even to be put on the same category with the life of the seed &gt;&gt; that God has put. &gt;&gt; You'd look me right in the eye and say, "Brother Ed, I don't care what you say. I could never do it. I can never give it up. I cannot deny it. I cannot turn it aside." &gt;&gt; I said, "Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've I've given you all this diminishing of the Jews because it doesn't matter. It it it it's irrelevant what we may go through and what we may be called to go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just taking my time for a moment. You know, friends, there's no difference between us here today. We say, "Well, this is 2010. Who cares?" There's no difference between this and I' I've already taken you from 70 AD to 2004 and beyond. Those people are no different. The Jews of 70 AD that had to flee out of Jerusalem are no different than those that are living today. They have the same say, "Why can't we have peace?" And the liberal Jews, they call them liberal Jews or whatever they say, they're prepared to give up anything &gt;&gt; just to have some peace. And and and and what has Christianity done? Christianity has they've given up they've given up their standards. They've given up their spiritual convictions. They've given it all up just so that they could be accepted. so that they could have a a wider acceptance so that they wouldn't be uh considered such uh offcowering or be oddballs whatever I say anybody who follows this message going to be an oddball and and we're not here just to have a little association of of uh of of people who are of like like-minded faith. We're here for something much deeper than that. &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to just come to give me a few more minutes here. I'm going to come to and I want to I want to focus on this that we crave. Now here a a prophet of God he comes and he speaks of the new home the heavenly home and and and it starts almost to take on the feeling to us that it's you can take this off now if you wish. It starts to take a feeling to us that it's almost like fairy tale and storybook things. Friends, it's not a fairy tale. This is not a myth. This is this is eternal things. These are more real than your physical body sitting in a seat here in this church today. &gt;&gt; He talks about a theophony body and that we're just a step away from the theophony body. He speaks about things that are it is as though we start to say, "Oh, it is so wonderful. How can I attain that? How can I achieve that?" And he also tells us, you can just rest in the fact that God has put it already in the seed. &gt;&gt; It's not you that's going to attain it. It's the life that's in the seed that's going to come to it. &gt;&gt; We'll fly when we're supposed to fly. We'll be changed when we're supposed to be changed. &gt;&gt; And from that, from then on, from here on out, whether we whether we are are diminished or whether we're thought evil of or whether we're spoken well of, that becomes irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Right. I want the last. God will call his elected and that is the Jews during that time. The elected, the Bible speaks of it, Paul speaks of it. According to the election, there will be 144,000 that will believe the message out of literally millions that that'll be there. There were millions in Palestine at the days of the prophecy of Elijah and 7,000 were saved out of the millions. Now, let me just stop here. How many did Elijah think were saved? &gt;&gt; How many did he think were saved? He thought that he was the only one &gt;&gt; and I only remain. &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet of God thought. I only remain. And God says, I've reserved to myself 7,000. There were 7,000 out there feeling the same as Elijah. Said, this isn't right. This God of Baal is not right. I have no association with it. They felt completely separated to it because there was a seed in them. There was a life in them that felt exactly like Elijah felt. &gt;&gt; 7,000 was saved out of the millions. Now, according to the election where millions of the Jews are gathering into their homeland, it's become a nation. There will be millions in there, but only 144,000 elected ones will be taken and that will hear the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I have a Just give me a moment here in the message Jehovah Gyra. He's speaking of of Abraham. He said just like he appeared to him down there, Elohim, he needed a body to come down to earth in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he just gathered up the cosmic light and the petroleum and so forth and stepped into it. See, &gt;&gt; he's God. &gt;&gt; That's the way he'll do you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I come here, friends. I'm st standing before a few hundred of you and and and I have a statement here. He said he stepped down. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? In Abraham's time, he stepped down &gt;&gt; and he put together some elements and he stepped down into it. &gt;&gt; God in a human body. &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say that's the way that he'll do you. &gt;&gt; He said after you're no more than a spoonful of ashes. &gt;&gt; That's right. in the dust. &gt;&gt; He'll still speak. &gt;&gt; Why did he say he'll still speak? Because he's declaring he's speaking now. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; While you're here in this body, while this seed is expressing itself, why you have a certain anticipation and a certain earnest expectation of the word? Why do you have that? Because he's here now and he's calling to it. But you might be home reading the scripture. You might be listening to a message tape or you might be here as you are this morning and as you hear the word preach something is echoing deep inside like the little eagle that hears a scream. I don't understand it but I know that it means something to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm hearing things and I'm seeing it in a different way. I'm seeing it another light. It's because there's a seed in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Respect that seed. Thank God for that seed. Thank God for that nature that's in there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he's going on to say, even if you're gone and you're just a teaspoon of ashes after you're no more, he'll still speak. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you'll be there. As I'm I'm bas I'm prepared to say on the basis of this, your ashes &gt;&gt; will respond &gt;&gt; to the very voice of almighty God &gt;&gt; the creator. And if your ashes will respond to it, why shouldn't we respond to it? As a living creatures, oh friends and believers, this is our opportunity. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He'll call He said he'll call your name. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When you're a sp spoonful of ashes, &gt;&gt; he's not going to say Jim, Sally, Edward. He's going to call. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is death cannot even remove that nature in the seat of God. &gt;&gt; Death cannot remove it &gt;&gt; because God put it there. and that God will call and a teaspoon of ashes will hear the call. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, believers. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a lot of teaspoon of ashes in there. &gt;&gt; You can go by these graveyards and they're full. It's called the city of the dead. You can go by there, it's full of people, full of teaspoons of ashes. But when God calls, there'll only be a teaspoon here and a teaspoon over there that will hear and come forth &gt;&gt; because they were predestinated to it before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He said, notice he changed his name from Abram to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. I need your full attention as we're going to go into little just a little swimming water for a moment. &gt;&gt; Now he's saying he stepped down into a body and he just called some of the elements together. Same elements he speaks of as you are made up of. He said he just he he he put those elements together and God stepped down into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those elements when God stepped down into it did something different than other elements that were put together of the same material. &gt;&gt; When he came up, there was God in that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like God's in your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because God's in your body, you can say things that are different. than the average flesh and blood man or woman. &gt;&gt; Not even Christians. I'm talking about God's in your body and and the seed that is in you &gt;&gt; happen to hear a voice. And this is what this voice has said. &gt;&gt; He says he changed his name. He's in the same message. He's changed his name here now from Abram to Abraham which which means father of nations. He added the ham Abraham. He did this so that the complete promise could be fulfilled. That's why he came and changed it and added the ham which was the deity part to it because God was adding deity part into this age and he said go and search your history. There's never been a messenger with ham come and he goes to a graham which is six letters for the Gentiles for the church world. But he says, "Who did the bride? Who who did Abraham hear?" It was seven letters, Abraham. And as a Branham and and and Billy Graham, God bless him for his ministry. He did what he was called to do. And so did a man, William Brandham, do what he was called to do. And I have abundance. I have all kinds of quotes and things here where he begins to speak to people and tell people. He told one woman her address. And when he gave the address like it's 146 and a half, &gt;&gt; he wouldn't allow it to end with the 146 or house number or the street number. It's 146. He said and a half. &gt;&gt; I tell you, God knows where you live. &gt;&gt; God knows your post office box number. God knows your He knows everything about your physical being. He knows what he put into you &gt;&gt; and he knows what it's going to become. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He sees you sitting around the marriage table. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, it sounds so good." There's something in you says, "Oh, that sounds so good." It's not only that it sounds good. It's true. &gt;&gt; It's more true than the dinner you're going to have today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] And there's something inside that's calling for that. &gt;&gt; I've experienced things in the message. I've experienced depths of grace and I've seen the prophet ex express the grace. I've seen him live it. I've seen him display it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm your friend. You call me your pastor. I'm going to tell you I have I've been in port I put myself right there and I've heard him say things and I've s heard him express grace to people and I had to say I'm not there yet. I wish I was. There's something in here that's calling out for it. I wish I was there. I wish I could say it. not just not there yet. And it's not just saying, "Well, just, you know, just go ahead and do it." No, it's just &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work that way. &gt;&gt; But I can say there's something in the seed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We're no different. &gt;&gt; We're God's elected. &gt;&gt; And there were Jews all down through the centuries that were God's elected. And they had desires within them. They had a craving. I'm not talking about a human desire. I'm talking about something. They knew they had a purpose. We know we have a purpose in the earth as Jews, as elected people. And we know we have a purpose in the earth as the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He didn't call you to be a bench warmer. He didn't call you just to be uh you know uh in a workplace. He didn't call you for that. He called you for a much deeper purpose. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my friend. So that the deep so that the complete promise could be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the son now that had been promised so long &gt;&gt; could be seen or otherwise be revealed. &gt;&gt; The son &gt;&gt; and was only at a time that name had to be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it had to fit an event in your day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it had to fit an event when the when the Jews themselves natural be to be called back &gt;&gt; and they flew in in 1948. &gt;&gt; There was 86,000 Jews. 86,000 was the total population of Palestine as of the latest count I have is 7,411,000. That's quite an increase from eight. &gt;&gt; Did he gather them back? &gt;&gt; Has that happened? &gt;&gt; That's happened while you sat here in this church. That happened while you worked at your job. Here's God, the great eternal God. Why did those people leave everything and get on a plane and lay there like cord wood &gt;&gt; in a great big jumbo jet freighter? No seats. They just laid there like cordwood on the floor. We say, "Well, that's against all the all the regulations of aeronautics." I tell you what, God's people in Israel, they're not even interested in what's right and what's, you know, what's, you know, the correct way of doing things. These people got to get home. &gt;&gt; We've got a calling. &gt;&gt; And they just grabbed their babies and left their homes and left whatever they had and boarded on the plane. Why was it? Because there was a call inside. I've got to go back there. And I'll tell you why they had that call. Why it was revived in this time. Because this messenger said it would be that way. [Music] &gt;&gt; God doesn't do anything till he speaks it. God came down &gt;&gt; and God said it. &gt;&gt; Do you know the world is mystified yet? Why did communism fall? You should have lived. Some of you young people, you didn't live in in in a in a few few years ago. That was a major threat in the world. &gt;&gt; When my wife and I raising our family up in the north, we didn't know when they might come across from from Siberia to Alaska and invade. And the prophet of God said they had missiles in the air and they could land it. He said, on Fourth Street, I believe it was in Phoenix. This is not a ancient or historical gospel. This is a gospel that is right now up to this moment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know. I know it's a little bit late. You'll just have to give me just a wee bit of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think that the church age messengers and I can talk about Luther and talk about Wesley and talk about the prophet of God in this day? You know what he says? Help me now. He said he'd wondered why when he was just a kid and he saw women acting the way they were and it built up like a complex in them. even says one place he hated them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he says and he learned later that there was real sisters amongst them and good ones. He said, &gt;&gt; but when he was a kid, he found and saw the direction things were going and there was a resistance and a resentment. He didn't know what to do with it. &gt;&gt; What was that? Wasn't wasn't something he got from his parents. &gt;&gt; That was something that was in that seed. says, "I am opposed to this." And then he starts his early ministry and he sees all the denominations and they're all spread and they're fighting against one another and got these walls and barriers up and he said, "I'm called to I'm called to break those down." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I'm called to break it down. What was it? It was a seed that was in him that was calling for that ministry. Because what I'm saying is that the seed had the nature before he even came to the place of living it and expressing it. &gt;&gt; The seed had the nature in it. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't fulfill it until the time came. &gt;&gt; All all seven of them. If I said you were in the loins of your father, that's not a surprise to us. But your father could not have fellowship with you until you were transformed into a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "My son was in me. I wanted a son, but he was in me then. He was in me then. But through wedlock, he was transformed into a man &gt;&gt; like me. And then he becomes like me and you become like your parents &gt;&gt; because it was in you to begin with. &gt;&gt; It was always there. That's what we're talking about. That life was in you to begin with. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to close it with a couple of a couple of statements and a couple things I want to read for you. How many know Elijah and Moses are going to come back? And they're going to have a very short ministry. Brother Brandham speaks specifically what they're going to do. &gt;&gt; You know what they're going to do? Call the elected &gt;&gt; back to the word. &gt;&gt; That's the ministry. &gt;&gt; That's the ministry. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've heard the message. I believe the message." Do you know what you did? You know what you did? If you're a believer, you heard God call your name. &gt;&gt; And Job said, "He will call and I will answer him. &gt;&gt; I will answer him." &gt;&gt; Even if he was just a spoonful of ashes, he will call and I will answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation and I know so many of you from where you came and where you lived and exactly how God did it. I'm not exactly sure. I look down and see our sister Gerta here. Her husband was a superintendent in a factory in in the Okonogan. It was a very large business and that factory went bankrupt and was advertised out to be liquidated. and brother Ken and brother Tom, brother Mike, they were appointed to liquidate it and they needed somebody the trustee needed somebody to show them the plant and they suggested and called him to be there and they got witnesses and talking to him and the next thing they did was bring a bag of tapes to him and that was it. Now, isn't that now who called? Who Who did that? Who arranged that? &gt;&gt; I say to you here because this is where I'm going and I'm I'm I'm a long ways from being over, but I'm going to finish. I need you to go back. I want you to go back and identify if you can that call when God begin to deal with you and call you. Is there a time or is there a place? And if you say here today, brother Biscll, I I I really don't know when he began to call me I but I did have an awakening. Yes. And he begin to spend. So others of you might say I can remember the time and the place. And then you know who perhaps spoke to you, who prayed with you. God's never going to change his mind about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll never change his mind. that's written down in the eternal and eternal books of almighty God. And I want to say to you before I before I close today h the fact if you can identify and say and if I asked you say did God ever speak to you did God call you. I'm not asking where you are today. I'm not asking how cold or how indifferent or how what you are. I'm not interested. I want to know, do you remember when God called you? &gt;&gt; And then I will announce to you on the authority of God's word. He will never change his mind about that call. &gt;&gt; He will never change his mind &gt;&gt; of that call and how it came. &gt;&gt; He'll never change his mind. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, &gt;&gt; father calling for his seed, calling for his children. And if you become nothing more than a teaspoon of dust, brother Ernie, in in the earth, you'll still hear his voice &gt;&gt; because God will not repent for the gifts and the calling of God is without repentance. &gt;&gt; He will never take it back. &gt;&gt; He'll never repent over having called you. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Can I close with this? &gt;&gt; Your new life is in the Lamb's book of life. There's things in the scripture. Brother Brandham said he was scared about death. There's things in the scripture that are very, very serious. Says we'll give account for every deed and for every word. I've never I thank God by his grace. I've never lived in deep sin. But that's that's irrelevant. I shake hands or wash feet with I don't care. I don't care what you did in your life. I don't care where you've been. The blood that cleansed me didn't change when it cleansed somebody else. &gt;&gt; It didn't have to become more potent. It didn't have to go back and get strengthened another dose. What cleansed one cleansed another one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and brother Brandham says this, and I'm I'm glad he says it right towards the end of his life and towards the end of his ministry and towards the end of the age he was sent to minister in. And he says this, "Your name of your first nature was born and put in a book and all a ll your deeds were wrote in it too." &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything you've done under that nature was put in a book called the book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he said your old book is gone. &gt;&gt; What does he he's ministering the invisible union of the bride to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And something has happened. Friends, young people, whoever you are, use your mind this morning. Pinch your conscience and say, "God, give me an understanding. Cause me to grasp this &gt;&gt; and your old book is gone &gt;&gt; with your old union. &gt;&gt; We're not united to Satan any longer. We're not He's not our taskmaster any longer. We've been freed from him. And the same power that freed you from him took your book, your old book under the nature, under your old nature, &gt;&gt; it's gone. He says, "And now your name, your old, your old has been transferred. &gt;&gt; And now he said, now you say, do you mean to tell me that my old book?" And he breaks the sentence. God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness. You stand perfectly before God. &gt;&gt; Now you're now your name is now in the new book. &gt;&gt; Not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; The difference between the book of life and the lamb's book of life, there's one major difference, and it's blood. And there's only one thing that could erase what came by our old nature was blood. &gt;&gt; Not church, not doctrine, not preaching. Blood. &gt;&gt; Blood. &gt;&gt; Erased it. It's the perfect delete. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you must accept that. &gt;&gt; Whether you feel in need of it or not, that's irrelevant. You do need it. &gt;&gt; He said, "What the lamb redeemed, &gt;&gt; not the old book of your natural union, &gt;&gt; but your new bride, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; your new life, &gt;&gt; is in the lamb's book of life, &gt;&gt; your marriage certificate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe you and I need to take a look at the marriage certificate today. &gt;&gt; Your marriage certificate [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; where your true &gt;&gt; eternal &gt;&gt; germ &gt;&gt; from the beginning takes hold. [Music] It is based on this &gt;&gt; that he continues to say and this is we repeat this. We've quoted it. I've heard all kinds of people read it. I've read it myself. Do I grasp? Now you'll catch the whole thought of my message. Do I grasp it all? Not completely. How did you come to do this? Right. God, how did you come to do this? &gt;&gt; You were deceived into it. by your first marriage &gt;&gt; to your adulterous parent Eve. &gt;&gt; It's no fault of your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By your natural birth, you came after Eve who committed adultery. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason you were born an adulteress. You were a sinner to begin with. &gt;&gt; He said you were deceived into it. &gt;&gt; No, he said it ain't your fault. I tell you what, friends, in my mind, it's very hard for me to go there. I'm I'm being honest with you. It's hard for me to go there. I'm telling you. And I'm telling you because I believe you are no different. There's things in this message that are so powerful. &gt;&gt; It's hard to go there. &gt;&gt; It's hard to go there. And when you can say, "Oh, yeah. Well, it's them or it's out in the world or it's in another church." But if it is your neighbor &gt;&gt; or one sitting next to you &gt;&gt; or your children or whatever more, then put this into practice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, that was a lesser amen than I expected. This doesn't lose its effect &gt;&gt; simply because oh, this is in another church or this is in another family or this is in another place. This has the same effect. &gt;&gt; And that's why it's hard for me to go there. But there's something inside of me. &gt;&gt; There is something inside of me that keeps crying out, I want to go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to have that capacity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be able to to address. I want to be able to embrace the forgiven. &gt;&gt; You were deceived into it. And it ain't your fault. How about the next one? You never did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can say &gt;&gt; I don't believe that. &gt;&gt; Or you can say, I do believe that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Or you can say, God, help me to believe it. &gt;&gt; Help me to go there. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something within me that says that truly &gt;&gt; is the power of the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not to live in sin. No, that's is absolutely that's absolutely untrue. It's not to live in sin. It's to be delivered from it. &gt;&gt; To be free from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You never did it. He didn't stop there. &gt;&gt; I stopped there for a purpose. He said, "You never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; God put your name in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; So, do you see how that all ties together? God put your name in the lamb's book of life. So, he put a germ in you that would represent what he put in the lamb's book of life. You couldn't be in the lamb's book of life unforgiven. You couldn't be in the lamb's book of life marred and dirty and unclean. You had to be there cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. For God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. There was no other way. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Brother Brandham was asked, "Brother Brandham," he said, "I'm closing now." &gt;&gt; Are you worthy of that? &gt;&gt; No. He said, "You think I'm worthy?" "Do you think the bishop's worthy?" "No." "I ever a man worthy?" &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. There's nobody here worthy. &gt;&gt; If Brother Brandham wasn't worthy, none of us are worthy. Right. &gt;&gt; It's not based on worthiness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're an heir. &gt;&gt; You're an heir. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you were the biggest drunkard in the world and your father left you a million dollars, whether you're worthy or not, it's it's his heir." &gt;&gt; He said, "You're the heir of your father's heritage." &gt;&gt; Whatever he left you, it's yours. whether you're worthy or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He left it to you. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I was a sinner." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a sinner. &gt;&gt; But an heir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was no good. Not yet. &gt;&gt; But still, I'm an heir. &gt;&gt; I should die and go to hell, but I'm an heir. &gt;&gt; Can you go there? &gt;&gt; Can you go there? Can you actually go there? &gt;&gt; He said, "If I die and go to hell, &gt;&gt; I'm an heir." Now, that's a man that has his absolute confidence in the word of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, God, if he takes me to hell, he's got to deliver me out of hell &gt;&gt; cuz I'm still an air. &gt;&gt; Can you go there? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? That's what he said in invisible union. That's because it's so powerful. There's nothing that can come. So what shall separate us from the love of God? &gt;&gt; I'm still an air. &gt;&gt; I regardless of how diminished you might have been, regardless of how backwards things have gone, I want you to be able to say, "I'm still an air. &gt;&gt; I lost my job. I'm still an air. I'm going bankrupt. I'm still an air. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm depressed and despondent. I'm still an air [Applause] &gt;&gt; folks. I'm not preaching. I'm not preaching for my health. I'm preaching for your health. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Roy. &gt;&gt; We're going to rejoice in this. &gt;&gt; This is God's infallible word. [Applause] You're hes and partakers &gt;&gt; of the divine nature. &gt;&gt; I'm an heir to what? He said, eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know we're going to get it? &gt;&gt; I feel it. And the Holy Spirit brought it. &gt;&gt; And Jesus rose from the dead so I could come. &gt;&gt; So it could come. And now it's come. And it bears record and vindicates just exactly what it said it would do. I've passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; I become a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then I'm an heir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice he said it was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is in the communion message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God. &gt;&gt; It was what God did. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It what God called. &gt;&gt; Amen. You had no will to call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could have had no desire to call &gt;&gt; because your nature was completely contrary to it. &gt;&gt; But by God's election, &gt;&gt; God by election called you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you've heard the call, then you know elections in place. God by election called you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] and turned you around and set your affections towards Christ and things above. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] Once in a while, it's good for us to look at things that are so potent. And it's good to be able to confess, I'm not there yet. I'm maybe not soaring in the heavenlies like the little eagle wanted to. And I saw it all through the scripture. Saw Abraham craving the sun and craving the land. Moses, he had such he looked out on his brethren. He saw them in such bondage. He saw them in such so burdened. He saw them whipped. He saw them just degraded. &gt;&gt; Talk about diminished. And he killed a man over it and became a murderer. &gt;&gt; Was that a mistake? I guess so. I don't care what kind of mistakes you've committed. &gt;&gt; It will not change God's opinion &gt;&gt; of his calling. &gt;&gt; Will not change. &gt;&gt; Moses did not become de Moses &gt;&gt; when he killed a man. And when he was a man of temper and he struck a rock twice and broke the broke the line. He didn't become non-M Moses anymore. He still was Moses. And David took Ba Sheba and committed adultery. But he was not he didn't become david anymore. He still was David. &gt;&gt; And he still was king. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Samuel and how many others &gt;&gt; I could speak of and it never changed God's mind. All right. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul, &gt;&gt; he said because of what he spoken, because of the life he lived in, because maybe he was sharp and little hook-nosed Jew as a as a prophet of God spoke to him. And he said, "All men have left me." Do you think that that gained him any popularity points? No. But did it change God's mind about Paul? Not one iota. &gt;&gt; That's right. Do you know why? Those that had heard him, I hope you're spiritual now. Those that had heard him, those that had heard the gospel through him, and those who had the elected predestinated seed in them and had responded to that, that was eternally in God's books. &gt;&gt; And it could never and never will be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all part &gt;&gt; of this great plan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Let's stand to our feet. You've been sitting a long time. Thank you for your patience. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh Lord, for the seed. Thank you for the nature of the seed. Thank you that eternal life has a nature in it and it cannot be quenched. &gt;&gt; It cannot be derailed. Oh God, that life will forever. It will forever forever. Oh God, let me declare it. Lord Jesus, in the name of thus sayith the Lord, your word will never never cease to be and cease and diminish in its strength. It will it'll accomplish what it was set out to do. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. How about Brother Ryan? I feel feel the pull. I hear the call. I feel the pull. I hear the call [Music] and his spirit moving me to give my all. He's speaking to me. And I [Music] Lord, please come and take control. I feel the I feel the Let's just worship him now. I I hear the voice and his spirit moving me to him my own. He speaks to me and I am free. Lord, please come and take control. I hear the world. The writer here says, "And I agree." And I agree. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know that I've been some time in this service today, but I felt for myself it's a it's a landmark message for myself and I'm trying to share it with you and I think this is a a major stepping stone &gt;&gt; here in this congregation. We do not want to treat this place as merely a gathering place for service on Sunday morning. I want you to be loyal. Come to Wednesday night service. I want you to be loyal. Come to prayer service if you're able. I understand there are those who drive a long ways and I understand that. I want you to be loyal in your giving. The prophet teaches tithing, &gt;&gt; does he not? He teaches tithing and he will bless according to his word. It's not it's not that God needs your money. It's not that the church needs it. That's God's order. That's God's. And you you come to the house of God. You come to contribute of your own self, of your own spiritual being. You come to contribute with that. Do so. &gt;&gt; When do I start giving? When you start earning. &gt;&gt; When you first begin to earn, that's when you start to give. And God will and furthermore the prophet said it is a form of worship. You are worshiping in your giving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The congregation can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] I'd like you to agree. [Music] And I guess having been many many places and I draw on so many experiences that I've I've had, but I do know of churches that had more people in it than we've got here today that was padlocked after a service and the people were never permitted to use that again. Do you know what also I know about that? 600 people who were there worshiping were reduced to about 90 when it was over. When the persecution was over or when the persecution was taking place, it was about 90. I'm not standing here for my health. I'm standing here for the health of this body of people. Make sure that you're not here just for fellowship. &gt;&gt; Make sure that you're not here just to go to church. That's not why we're here. Make sure that you're here because you say, "I'm an heir. &gt;&gt; I'm here because he called me. &gt;&gt; And I heard his voice. It's not brother Biscll. It's not anyone else in the church. I heard the voice of God." And he'll never change that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again, let's just sing it once again. I feel the world. I hear the [Music] spirit moving me to give my heart. He speaks to me and I [Music] Lord please come and take control. I feel the [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for a moment. Father, there may be those and no doubt is perhaps most of the congregation would say in all truth and honesty. [Music] I feel that very deep unexplainable craving and hunger. I hear the prophet's voice. I see things in the word of God and I crave. I can say with the psalmist David, as the heart panth after the waterbrooks, so pandeth my soul after you. We hunger and thirst after righteousness. Oh God, when I read of the righteousness that Apostle Paul speaks of when I read of the righteousness and the purity and the holiness. Oh God, how my soul craves and cries out for that place. When we say, "Oh God," in the words of Jesus in his prayer, "Thy kingdom come." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom of justice and purity and holiness, thy kingdom where the seraphims can only say, "Holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord." Oh God, give us an understanding. Give us a scope of vision, Lord, today. Let the people not go out of this place as the same as they walked in. But may they indeed have received something of such substance, transforming power. I pray, oh Holy Spirit, transform. Transform us, oh God. And we are asking you that you'll transform us, oh God, into the image that you've desired that we should be. Let us rise to that level of maturity. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. In Jesus Christ's name. And if you're would like to just [Music] perhaps identify yourself or just want to lift your heart, your hand before God. Let us let us sing this prayer together. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord and I'll be quick to answer you. Sweet my [Music] sweet my sweet and I'll be quick to answer. Speak my Lord. Oh sweet oh God. Speak my Lord. Oh sweet and I will answer. Lord send me prayer now to him. Oh my Lord. Speak to me, Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak Lord. Speak my Lord. Oh, speaking and I will answer. Lord, send me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray that God will [Music] take the advantage every opportunity in the coming days in your individual life regardless of your age or position or status that he'll speak to you and he'll speak back [Music] sometimes. Did you ever feel unworthy? &gt;&gt; I guess we all have. &gt;&gt; I did this morning before I came to church. I knelt to pray about the service that God would and when I read of even some of our Jewish friends and they were explaining why why they won't even attempt to utter the word the name of God. I really was spoken to very very deep. They said because as humans we're not worthy to utter his name. And I said God even though we don't have a Jewish faith they have something of respect. And I hear people use the name of God and they use it in their business and give their all kinds of titles and I think how you know what a what a shame how disrespectful it is. I think God give me that kind of respect. I I knelt down to pray. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And felt so unworthy. And so I came to the pulpit today not feeling like some great servant of Christ. I come here feeling very unworthy. I felt unworthy for his call the first time, but I remember it. And you know, it was just after I answered God's call and said, "Here's my life. I fell in love with something. I loved your testimony, Brother Daniel. And I've mentioned it several times. I was so moved when your mother told you stories out of the Bible and your daddy who was a Catholic and was opposed to your learning. His daddy was a doctor and his daddy was against him and against Christianity, against the message, but his mother told him stories of Jesus out of the Bible. And he said he fell in love with God. That touched me so deep, brother Daniel. He said, "You fell in love with God." And then he says he went on and sometime later in his life still a young man just a young man in his teens. He was just a boy then. And later on in his teens he heard about the message that God had sent. And when he heard the message he said it just caused him to love God more. &gt;&gt; I let those things speak to me. Brother Daniel, I let those things speak to me very very deep. I want to love him. And it it spoke to me so deep when I could hear brother Brandham say, "Am I worthy?" "No." &gt;&gt; I said, "Brother Brandon, that's me." "No, but I'm an heir." &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you this now and we'll close in prayer. And I hope you can go and think of these things. young people are just a young man struggling to understand the scriptures. And I know that brother Brandham knew my big questions. I knew that he knew that. I knew that he could look down. I was just hoping he wouldn't point his finger at me saying, "You hypocrite walking out here with me and hunting with me and got those big questions and think maybe even have false doctrine." I was expecting that. He said, "Brother Eddie, the next time that you're in prayer and you feel him, draw real close to him, to me, to you." So, would you give him a message for me? And I'm just looking at him because I I can't comprehend how I'm going to give a message to the Lord Jesus. And he says, "The next time he draws near and you feel him real close to you," he says, 'W will you do something for me? I said, ' Okay. He said, "Tell him that brother Bill loves him very much." You talk about unworthy. You talk about unworthy. I felt like draw crawling under the moss out in the woods. Tell him Brother Bill loves him very much. [Music] None of us here are worthy. &gt;&gt; But I want you to go back to the original call where God called you. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't had him call, I wouldn't do anything in this life. I'd cry out to him with everything that was in you. Say, "Oh God, you call and I will answer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Speak my Lord. Speak. &gt;&gt; Speak my [Music] speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord send me. My dear Lord Jesus, [Music] you are so so very very precious and very near. You have come and I I believe that you have spoken to the people that you ordained would be here today. No one is here by accident. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I do ask that you will speak. Lord, I I've prayed earlier today and I'm praying now that you'll speak to me. Reveal yourself to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself, Lord. I feel that there's so so much yet that we need to rise to and we want to attain to. I pray that you will make it and mark the people indelibly brand their hearts and minds and souls that he that began a good work is able to finish it and that you will complete it. You will bring it to its conclusion. You'll bring every son and daughter to adoption. You'll bring us, oh God, into that rapture condition. And as we're hearing the word, may we, Lord, let our soul cry out. May we, oh God, give way to the hunger and thirst within our soul. We perhaps have desires that are within the realm of the natural man, things that we want to do, things we want to achieve and accomplish. I'm asking Lord that you'll so speak that the people will allow the things of this life to take a lower place and and be and just let it pale in it in its importance Lord so that it will be the things that we we that you have desired for us oh God call speak don't let us get away from it oh God speak after we leave the building today Lord Lord, speak while we're in our home and in our car. And if needs be, speak in the middle of the night, oh God. Speak and we will answer you. Jesus Christ, in your name, I ask your blessings upon this people. Father God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, God of Israel, go with this people, I pray, and may they rise to a whole new level and stature in the stature of the perfect man. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. You're dismissed in Jesus name. and just obey his voice. If you feel to get away quietly someplace, go ahead and do that. I want to just say we'll walk in the light. What a beautyful light where the doom drops of mercies are bright. shine all around us by day and by night. It's Jesus who light on the world. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Trust you'll have a glorious time. Tell us next Wednesday night will be the first time we'll be gathering back. Brother Tim Dawn will be with us on Wednesday night and next Sunday. Have two meetings next Sunday. You're dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you. [Music]
