And while they do, let's uh turn to number 434. He was crucified. Amen. Let's sing it together. Above all powers, above all kings, above all nature and all created things, above all wisdom and all the ways of Man, you were here before the world began. And above all kingoms and above all thrones, [Music] above all wonders the world has ever known. above all and treasures of the earth. There's no way to measure what you were. Oh, but you were crucified and laid behind [Music] you to die in my role. [Music] And you find me. [Music] Oh Lord, you were [Applause] you behind you. I rose on the ground. You know [Music] me.

If that isn't love, [Music] even in death, he remembers [Music] the thief hanging by his side. [Music] He spoke with love and compassion. [Applause] [Music] Then he took him to die. If there is a life, &gt;&gt; if there isn't. of the ocean is dry. There's no stars in sky. [Applause] Oh, and the spell can fly. &gt;&gt; Oh, if that isn't love, then heavens are made. There's no feeling like this. If that is enough, &gt;&gt; if that is. &gt;&gt; Oh, the ocean is dry. There's no stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. That is enough.

If that is enough, [Music] Michael sisters, &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; So glad for his love. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be uh turning the service to brother Ed. There's a baby dedication at this time. And just as brother Ed comes, let's sing together number uh 952. Sing the chorus. Mary came unto the tomb of Jesus. Mary came unto the tomb of Jesus. [Music] The stone the Lord had gone away. He said, "Fear not. I know who see [Music] [Applause] his heard him sing. Oh, he's gone. Stone is rolled back on. The tomb is empty to sit at the father's right hand. Jesus [Music] Christ. [Music] He lives forever. My friend, you don't know my ris. Oh, I beg of you. Don't wait too long to pray. Don't wait until his bride has been completed. And don't wait until you hear him say it's too late. Oh, don't [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Amen. Well, we're glad he lives forever more. &gt;&gt; And we're glad he's still adding to the church. &gt;&gt; So, we've got a a new member. She doesn't know she's a member yet, but she will soon discover it. And uh Ella Joy is going to sing us a song. Amen. and she wanted to sing at her sister's dedication. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I am a cure. [Music] and my life was in his hands. He knows my name and he knows my every thought. He sees each te that pass and he hears me when I come. [Music] He knows my name. He knows my hurry. He sees each tear that falls and hears me that I come. [Music] I have a maker. &gt;&gt; I have a father. &gt;&gt; Andrew said this has special meaning for them because the song says, "And every time and before time began, my life was in his hands." And that's exactly what we believe. Well, brother Rickart and Sister Andrea have brought their uh latest edition, their daughter. And this is uh Gwyneth Kate. Gwyneth Kate is her name. Gwyneth being to be blessed with happiness. And Kate is pure, genuine, and real. And we we pray that that's exactly what she will be if the Lord Jesus carries. But this uh to be blessed with happiness and I gave a prayerful thought to this uh Andrea Ricard it's from being uh conscious for her to be conscious of well-being for her to be conscious of uh being cared for having a sense of comfort for her to be conscious of peace. There will be there will be a day when she will have that she will mature to that age in her life where she will be able to be aware of things that she's not aware of right now. And in order for her to be conscious of it, she has to experience it. She has to experience the peace &gt;&gt; and experience the comfort, experience the joy in a home, experience the spiritual influence of a home. And I thought of something very different at this time. Not because uh she's my greatg granddaughter, but I just look to the Lord for each individual one. I know the other brethren do the same thing. But I thought in this day and age, what what can parents do? What what can we do? And I thought of some parents in the scripture. I thought of the woman that brought her daughter to Jesus, Andrea. And Jesus said, "It's not meat to give the children's bread to the dogs." And she said, "Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table." And I said in my heart, she said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She said the right thing. And Jesus said, "I've never heard I' never seen such faith in all of Israel." And because of that, her daughter was delivered and healed. Hadtie Wright said the right thing. She didn't say very much, but she said this. He said she was sitting there with a little dust bonnet on her head that country women wear. She put on a clean dress and came to help her mother cook a dinner. She was sitting with her hand like this. And brother Brandham had said something and she said, "That's nothing but the truth." The other woman said, "But even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table." And how do he write said, "That's nothing but the truth." And brother Bren went on to say just as she said that, I want you to notice all parents here and all individuals, just as she said that, the Holy Spirit spoke to him and said, "Give her what she asks for." That happens to be very powerful. That was a parent. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And she asked for her two sons. There was a man Rick record and he brought his tormented child to Jesus. I was thankful. I thought of this parent, he knew where to bring that child. And I say to every parent that is here, it's incumbent upon us as parents to know in a time of need where to bring our children, &gt;&gt; where to bring our young people. And if you brought your young people here with you as families, I say in the name of the Lord, you've brought them to the right place. &gt;&gt; You young people that have parents that have influenced you and worked with you and prayed with you, you thank God for them. &gt;&gt; Rick Hart and Andrea, you have brought your child to the right place. And before we dedicate her, I want you both to dedicate yourselves to be these kind of parents. And not only parents but grandparents. Apostle Paul spoke of his forefathers which is which is not parents but that's grandparents or even greatgrandparents. And he spoke about them and the faith that he had and then he spoke about Timothy and that's why he said to Timothy the faith that was first in your mother your grandmother Lois and in your mother and it came on down. So this is important and I thought of one more parent and that was the prodal the father the prodal son and the bible says the the the son he awakened he came to himself and as as and I trust that this child will never never experience those things that he experienced but even then he came to himself and he said I will arise and I will go to my father and the scripture says His father saw him a great way off. &gt;&gt; Because he was looking for him. &gt;&gt; He was expecting him to come back. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of you out there that have need that kind of faith. &gt;&gt; He was looking for him. He was looking for this son. He was expecting him. And I want you too, brother Rickart Mandrea, to expect this child to find the Lord Jesus Christ as her savior &gt;&gt; to know the God that we know. &gt;&gt; I'm going to dedicate Gwyneth Kate. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Dear heavenly father, this is a gift that you have given. Bless your name. We cannot even begin to thank you for your grace and your goodness. But please receive, oh father, our thankfulness to you. And now here stands her father Rickart and her mother Andrea desiring with everything that's in them to dedicate her back to you. And we dedicate Gwyneth Kate in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that she might be an example to other young people. And if time should continue, Lord, may she be a vessel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Keep her in good health. I pray that she will be not only an example, but that she will be a source of happiness and joy within this family and to others. Thank you, oh God, for your goodness. And we dedicate ourselves to you. We take this opportunity to dedicate ourselves, mother, father, grandparents, greatgrandparents, and and all of us that are here in the congregation. We dedicate ourselves that we might be the example to our young people. And as your prophet said, we influence them. May we influence them in the path of life in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Andrea, God bless you. Bless you, Rickart. enjoy. Thanks for that song. Hallelujah. Isn't the Lord wonderful? &gt;&gt; Well, I have a good friend here, too. Uh, I said to Brother Rod, I want to welcome our brother Eddie Hurley and his good wife Barb that is here with him. his daughter Tina and son-in-law James and their two children. Where are they? I wonder if we can have them all stand, please. My welcome. Amen. Well, we're so happy to have them and had a nice time with them last evening and and I just pray that they will uh they're they're going to escape the rain by going up higher and getting to Whistler and hoping it's snow. Well, I hope it's snow for you, too. Amen. If you haven't had an opportunity, and I don't imagine you have, there's a there's it's a newsletter that's just out, a missions newsletter, and uh brother Kim and brother Derek and brother Dier, brother Dier is in Ghana right now, but they all have contributed and and worked at putting this together and very nice. They want to put out one a month because there's just too much happening. So, we would ask also that you would just take one per family. You'll find them at the uh at the tithe and offering box I believe is where they said it would be and uh uh I I did read it as well and I had a small small hand in it not very much but it is just marvelous what is taking place a little bit maybe some of the things you heard about China and and about uh the church in Russia which also reminds me that on Tuesday we want to send uh an offering to uh to on behalf of the building of the church in Moscow and they're they've got the walls up and put the first uh uh ceiling. Some of you saw the pictures, the most recent pictures. I had a I had a phone call phone message yesterday and from brother Gear Roald which asked me also to convey greetings to the congregation to those on the internet those that are in the fellowship room uh greetings from uh brother Gear Roald and and their church is doing everything that they can towards this building of this church in Moscow. It's very urgent because there there's three congregations that have come together and they they don't have a place to worship. Uh they're under more severe restrictions than I can even begin to mention here. It takes about 15 years to get a church registration in in Russ in Russia or in that part. And uh so they have to build something that is will accommodate a a residence and a large enough building. Uh the brother uh the pastor uh brother Sergey was in Latvia recently and a and a and a pastor there is a a contractor and he just gave him some further advice on on almost doubling the size of the place at almost no extra cost. It would only take a few more uh about three or four truckloads or so of concrete blocks, but not much because they're doing a lot of the labor themselves. And so we want to send uh uh another offering on on Tuesday. And so if you just feel inclined, if you had wanted to do something, it doesn't make any difference what amount it is. We're just we gathered all together and all that has come in from elsewhere and from within the church. We've sent, as you'll see here, we've sent we have sent $56,000 to them and other churches in Europe have given. And we're getting these people the Lord the Lord helping them and they are working sacrificially. And those people themselves have given uh the the people in in Russia that congregation have given about $80,000. They say 70 here, but I know it's about $80,000 of their own money besides working. So I think that's very very honorable of them. They're sacrificing. And so if you just feel, Lord, I'm just going to do something a little extra special for them and then we're going to send it out Tuesday morning because they're in need of it right now. And don't forget to pick up your uh this mission's newsletter. Yeah, I know that you'll enjoy it. We also had a I had a uh an email that was translated to me from the Russian language and they uh I have never I've never heard directly from this brother uh before, but they they've been streaming the meetings and he's a pastor. He's got a nice church. I I've never been there, but I know that he's been pastoring there for a lot of years in the city in one of the former Soviet states. and they told me that they've been they've been really blessed by the meetings and the atmosphere and the ministry of the word from the church here and we're happy over that. We're just happy to be a blessing. &gt;&gt; That's all. And and as far as God wants to send it, that's just fine with us. But they started tra translating it into the streaming of the meetings into the uh Russian language and they they said that they're sending it to a number of countries uh Russ where Russianspeaking people are and you know that there's almost 3/4 million Jews that went from Russia to Israel and these people are sending over 110 DVDs of every service to former Soviet states to the Ukraine into Europe and into Germany wherever there's Russian speaking people that they have contact with and some and they're sending them into Israel as well. And I thought that was just really remarkable. Uh so God knows exactly what it is that he's wanting to do and trying to do and we're just saying here we are. We want to do our best. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm sure you feel exactly the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, I'd like to just have you stand and uh I'd like to sing, Brother Rod. He became me that I might become him through his grace. Aren't you glad he became me? &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross, I should have been there. &gt;&gt; You should have been there, but he was there for us. &gt;&gt; So, he became me so we could become him by his grace. Just sing it together with us, please. He became me so that I might become him by gra. He became me so that I might become by grace. He took my place so that I could take his. He became me so that I might become him by grace. Let's just take a moment, please, quietly, reverently, quietening our spirits, collecting our thoughts and focusing on the great accomplishment of Jesus Christ at Calvary. Father, our Father, and I trust that each person can say, "My Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Today, Lord, we're gathered here for that purpose. We've sung the songs. We have prayed. We have spoken and and uh greeted the friends and the people that are here visiting. I pray Lord now as we approach the word and I have the Bible open before me. Come now I pray Holy Spirit and confirm this truth to the people. We are not interested in uh history. We're not interested in theology. We're not interested in some dead tradition. But I pray that you will come and quicken this word to every person. And I pray that Satan will be soundly defeated, Lord, at every front. That you will take our minds and thoughts and bring them into captivity to the very mind and thought of Jesus Christ. I pray you will quicken and enable myself, Lord, to say what you would have said. We're praying for the service tonight. And so wonderful to have our brother Tom back, oh God, as a congregation. We want to thank you for the healing that you have done, Lord, for the supernatural act, for putting the right people together at the right time, for putting it in their hearts to do everything, Lord, being being motivated, being driven, oh God, to do even beyond beyond the call of duty. We thank you for that, Lord, because we know it is you that has done this. And now, Father, I pray that you will sew the seed and bring it down into our hearts, Lord, and it might glorify your name. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So appreciate your prayers. And uh now as we turn to the scripture, I'm going to read out of John's gospel the 12th chapter. And I'm starting to read at verse 233. We'll read down to verse 27 and then you can just uh when you're seated after the reading of the scripture I'm going to go immediately into some other scriptures that you will see on the screen and what I am attempting to do I want to just take the account of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and I've selected various scriptures out of various of the gospels and they just run in continuity and I trust it will be a benefit to you and then we will go into the into the service. We're here on uh we're not here just to play church. &gt;&gt; We're here to have a meeting and do &gt;&gt; business with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Starting at the 23rd verse of 12th chapter, John. And Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified." Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn and wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it. And he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me. And where and where I am, there shall also my servant be. If any man serve me, him will my father honor. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. You may have your seat. Now, if you'll just watch the screen. And when they were came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him and the male factors, one on the right hand and the other on the left. And the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." And having said thus, he gave up the ghost. And after this, Joseph of Arythea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave leave, and he came therefore and took the body of Jesus. And he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sappelcher that was hu in stone wherein never a man was laid. The prophecy out of Psalms and repeated in Acts because thou wil not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. And now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sephiler, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. And they and they found the stone rolled away from the sephiler. And they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, "The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again." And they remembered his words, and returned from the seeler, and told all these things to the 11, and to the rest. And when they were come to a place I'm sorry we'll just that is all the reading. Thank you. Today uh we're remembering the resurrection of Jesus Christ. But I want to take you quickly, very quickly, because the message today will require your full attention and going to come from a direction I'm sure that you're you're not expecting entirely. That is because both death and resurrection uh while we have a uh we have an immediate response mental response an immediate understanding and we interpret it uh as death being when a person expires and breathes their last breath and resurrection as one that has been raised from the dead. But there are there are other not merely meanings but it is used differently also in the scripture and I want to look at that because there is a a natural death and there's a spiritual death. There's a natural resurrection and there's a a natural physical resurrection. There's also a spiritual resurrection. And the Bible refers to uh both of these. And I want to take it further than that by God's help. And this is where you'll need to capture this first thought. And that is we can have uh uh a a death of an individual that we understand. That's what we talk about. But we can also have a uh there's been civilizations that have gone off the scene. They've essentially perished. Uh there's been there's been certain kinds of culture that's gone. And as time has moved on and the waves of of humanity have moved down through all through the centuries, we've had things that have risen and then then they've faded away and and we've had kingdoms that have been great superpowers and they're dead. They've died. They don't exist at all today. And then we've had resurrections also where man has uh there's there's there's renewals or revivals and all of those words are they they have the same kind of of reference. There's been like a a resurrection has has taken place. And so with those thoughts in your mind, uh I want to uh be approaching this subject. Brother Brandham, he speaks about Calvary first and we I want to um make a reference from the message he spoke the testimony of Jesus Christ. He said, "And I I look going up Calvary." Now, I think it's good for us to take a a prophet's insight and see how he describes this. He said, ' And I see someone going down through Jerusalem. He has a garment on that's wo throughout without a seam. And I wonder why them little red specks was all over it. After a while, they begin to get bigger. And all those specks finally ran together. It's one big bloody garment. I hear it slapping against his legs. What was it? It was the lamb of God that was going to Calvary to be crucified and had to die. For only out of death comes life. That's the phrase I want you to remember. Only out of death comes life. And he repeats it. Lest a corn of wheat falls into the ground, it abides alone, but if it dies, it produces life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said he was so dead in another message in the intunement when he bowed his head and the earth shook and the rocks rent and the temple veil tore from top to bottom and the sacrifice blocks where they sacrificed animals turned over and the son of the living God died. He was so dead till the sun recognized it. &gt;&gt; He was so dead till the moon recognized it. He was so dead till the stars recognized it. He was so dead till the earth recognized it. He was so dead till the elements recognized it, the atmosphere recognized it. Everything had to know that the son of God to know that he was the son of God and for God's word could not fail. And so we understand that and that's why we're here. But the scripture also speaks of those that were dead in trespasses and sins and unbelief, trespasses and unbelief. And unbelief will bring trespass. &gt;&gt; We think of Gyrus, the ruler of the synagogue. He had a 12year-old daughter. And this 12-year-old daughter died. I mean, she died. And the Bible says although he was a ruler of the synagogue, but he came and he fell down at the feet of Jesus and he besought him that he would come to his house and all the people wept because while he was being beseeching Jesus to come to his house, a messenger ran and said, "Don't trouble the master. She's died." And they and Jesus he went and they all wept and bewailed her passing but he said weep not for she is not dead &gt;&gt; but sleepeth. So now this has to this has to take and jerk our thinking out from you know just a tunnel vision of death is the expiration of the body because now we have the words of Jesus saying she's not dead but she sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead and he put them all out and he took her by the hand and called her saying made rise eyes and her spirit came again. Wherever it was, here was the master of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Here was the master of the destination of our spirit. &gt;&gt; Calling it back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how we rejoice. And I was with brother Brandham. He said, "We have five cases. We have five the certificates of five cases in our office." And now once again came a a a voice with authority that God honored &gt;&gt; and God was behind it &gt;&gt; calling the spirit from wherever it was to come back. &gt;&gt; So we find death as we have interpreted isn't exactly death because we have one or there is one &gt;&gt; that is greater than death itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded that they give her meat, something to eat. On another I'm just laying a little bit of foundation. On another occasion, Jesus hears of his friend Lazarus is sick and they've called for him to come and pray pray for him, come and visit him. And uh the scripture says that he waited two more days. He didn't go. He heard our friend Lazarus. Then Jesus told his disciples, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him out of his sleep." And they then said Jesus unto them plainly, because they said, "Oh, if he sleeps, he does well." And Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead." And when he had thus spoken on down, because he came to the had his conversation with Martha and Mary, and then came to the place where they had him. And he said when he had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." and he came forth bound said loose him and let him go. &gt;&gt; So death, that's death at a different level. And now still a further different level. Now we're moving in. Want your kind attention. I appreciate it. God speaking to Adam and Eve. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This is a critical verse for me this morning. Thou shalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Adam lived for 930 years. Now we know that the day is a thousand years and he could not live the thousand years. Methuselah couldn't break the thousand years. He lived 969. No man could break the thousand-year day. But in the 24-hour period or an immediate reaction of death did not happen, Adam did not expire. &gt;&gt; He did not take his last breath. He lived on to experience the pain of of his unbelief. &gt;&gt; He lived on for 930 years. And he saw a lot of things in 930 years. generations of of children and families that came up. But death was introduced to the world before he passed away. He saw the reign of death. He saw death come into its into into its uh fullfledged. He saw death. He saw murder. He saw it all happen. And the scripture says by Apostle Paul, Romans 5:12, "Wherefore by one man sin entered into the world and through death and and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned." And thus from that time we're living here uh wife and I driving to the church this morning thinking sometimes I feel so humbled almost humiliated that we look at things such as I I I said look look at this field out here look at all this black dirt just just dirt that's been here for centuries &gt;&gt; I'm here for a few years &gt;&gt; you're just here for a few years. You're just here for a breath. &gt;&gt; I look at those trees on Vancouver Island, great monster Douglas fur trees there in McMillan Park, just this side of Port Al Bernie where brother Brando's meetings was. And I look at those trees and they've been standing there for about 300 years or more. And I just look at the bark. I think this is just bark on this tree. Big rough bark on a fur Douglas fur tree. And it's been here longer than I'm here. And when I'm gone, it'll still be here. I think, you know, what is this bark worth? What is this tree worth? What is this wood worth? And here we are. Oh, humans. And we can think things and we can invent things and we've we've got all this energy and we've got all this what and God just allows it to pass off the scene. &gt;&gt; We're not here for very long, friends. Thank God that we have a promise. &gt;&gt; And thus began the reign of sin and death. And the scripture goes on to say, "Thus as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Now I'm bringing this parallel as I mentioned earlier between the uh physical and the spiritual death and resurrection. A physical death, a physical resurrection, a spiritual death and a spiritual resurrection. Whether it's applied to the individual or applied to all all of humanity, for all have sinned, all are under the reign and the sentence of death. every person I'm speaking to today, man. Here we are now as we're seated here. All we are is uh we're just dust. We all look different, but we're just dust. And if you could possibly imagine six billion plus people, all it is is God having taken the dust of the earth. Out of the dust of the earth come botney life. Out of the dust of the earth has come the animal life. And when it's and when it expires it goes back to the earth and all we are all of humanity is just waving over the earth and moving sea of humanity but all it is is earth that has been raised to its highest level. This that you're in is the highest level that God allowed the soil to reach. And God took and formed man out of the earth. And that's all you are. However many cents that's worth, but that's all we are. And these bodies are going to go back to dust. You're quiet, but that's still the truth. You've got big plans and we've got big ideas and everything else, but you are just a few a few spoonfuls of ashes, dusted ashes, and short of a rapture and short of a resurrection, that's where everybody's headed anyway. In this life we might have different status and different station and live differently and have different culture whatever more but be it known that it's all dust and ashes. That's all it is. It's good for us to keep that in mind. But that is the highest form that God allowed the dust of the earth to be raised up to. Now we've had advancement. We've had advancement in civilization. But the higher we rise, the higher the civilization becomes, it's amazing, the the more intelligent it becomes or as we understand it, the more death &gt;&gt; is associated with it. Brother Brandham said, "Now, as it was in the days of Noah, said they were smart men back there with their atomic powers and everything. They could build pyramids &gt;&gt; and the Sphinx and so forth." And then the scripture says, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be." in proving his word. He said God spoke to Noah a message that certainly was un unscientific and unbelievable and no one could believe that it was because it had never rained upon the earth. God watered it with dew. He says and perhaps there's there was they were a greater scientific age than we are now because they built pyramids and the sphinx and so forth. And in those days, he says, the things that we can't build now, he says they were acquainted with power, some kind of mechanical power, perhaps atomic or something that they could lift those big boulders that we couldn't do it today, but they did great scientific things. They had something that they could embomb a body and make it look natural for hundreds of years. and we've lost that art. &gt;&gt; They were smart people. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the son of man." And we know that we are to enter into another great scientific age. &gt;&gt; So now catch my point. There was perhaps people even of a greater intelligence and greater achievements in a different type of culture back then. And today, of course, we're in another direction. But in in one sense of the word, there has been a resurrection &gt;&gt; of that intelligence. &gt;&gt; There has been a resurrection of the scientific world as it was. Jesus said in the days of Noah because when Jesus said that it wasn't like that they didn't have the television. They didn't have atomic power when Jesus was here. They didn't have those things. They had had them but they didn't have them then. But he said there'll be a resurrection of it. In other words, &gt;&gt; it will rise again. There'll be a renewal of it. There'll be a revival of it. It will come again. those great days from back there will arrive again in the end time. And when you see that, you know that's the time. &gt;&gt; But it's a false resurrection. &gt;&gt; They'll come and they'll begin to develop cell cells and they'll begin to cross cells and they'll begin to they'll come right to the edge of creating life. Right. &gt;&gt; They will do fearful things. They have right here at the University of British Columbia. I understand a few years ago that they had a they had a discovery and it it scared them and they destroyed it because it was too frightening it might. And today, of course, there's great debates going on even in Washington, what they can do with the cells and what they will allow and and and it'll go over the edge and and will it be morally correct and and all of these things. And the Catholic Church is against it and some people are for it and and they're having all kinds of debates because they're developing and playing with the cell life. I'm not interested in the politics of it. All I say is there's there has been a false resurrection &gt;&gt; of the scientific world because man keeps feeling it'll it'll get better and it'll get better and it'll get better because he's been biting off of the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; But the tree of knowledge can never bring the resurrection you and I need. &gt;&gt; It's a false resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's a false security. It's a false joy. &gt;&gt; And now after they have come uh look at what they're discussing, look what they're debating. Look what the great nations of superpowers are trying to come to. Because even the current president of the United States wants to discuss with the w with the uh atomic uh those that have atomic power, nuclear power, that we should disband and destroy our nuclear powers, so we'll have a more peaceful world. It'll never happen. &gt;&gt; Not because I'm a pessimist. I'm an optimist. I'm going to live forever by God's grace. because I'm looking for another resurrection which we will talk about in a few minutes &gt;&gt; a different kind of a resurrection but there has been I want you to see in humanity humanity has had they've come from their greatness and it died out &gt;&gt; and then it raised again and and man is gloring in his achievements and his accomplishments he's gloring in a false resurrection &gt;&gt; you may need to think about that. But the more advanced we become, the more death there is. And here's a prophet. Oh, I thank God what insight he had even back there listening. He was talking to a doctor. And he said, "Doctor, you excuse me for talking to you like this? You're a smart man." But I said he, you know, when the trees in the Garden of Eden, there were two of them, and one of them was the tree of knowledge and the other one was the tree of life. And when he took his first bite off the tree, the tree of knowledge, he separated himself from his maker. And ever since then, he's been biting off that tree. And every time he bites off that tree, he destroys himself. Does this congregation believe &gt;&gt; what this messenger said? &gt;&gt; He said he destroys himself. He said God doesn't destroy. God destroys nothing. Man destroys himself by knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the results of living off that tree. &gt;&gt; But as long as he stayed with the tree of life, he lived forever. But when he left the tree, the tree of life, and ate off this tree, disobeying God, and then the question mark might come across God's word, he said, "And when the question mark comes across God's word, I say to this congregation today and all that may hear my voice or ever hear it, I'm repeating these words. I'm giving echo to this vindicated messenger." and all he says and when the question mark comes over God's word he says then to me death comes in &gt;&gt; and when the question mark comes across your heart &gt;&gt; of God's word and when the question mark comes in your heart across God's word death comes in So, in a sense, as I said a moment ago, man has been experiencing, and I'd like to say to this congregation, don't get caught up in a false resurrection. &gt;&gt; Things are great. you young people and we've got a lot of young blood in this congregation and fine healthy bodies and beautiful young people. You got a future ahead of you, whatever that future might be. But this isn't your future. You've got to count on a future that's beyond this. Because everything that is man touches, death is associated with it. Regardless of how fine or how nice or how refined or how cultured it becomes, it's death. &gt;&gt; The more inventions is death. &gt;&gt; And I say and declare, God's going to destroy it. Because Jesus came not just to die at Calvary and to go to the tomb and to raise out of the tomb, but the scripture says he came to destroy the works of the devil. He came to destroy these fine things that only produce death. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says they take the gas and the and the oil and so on out of the ground and put it into a car and all the rest of it. Drive down the road 90 m an hour and kill some people more killed on the highways and been killed in all the wars. The Bible says this in Revelation 9:6 says, "And in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. That's new, isn't it? They will seek death. Where is it? And they can't find it. &gt;&gt; And they will seek to die and it'll flee from them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the same God that said, "You eat of this and you'll die." It's the same God said, "You eat of this and you'll live." In the message, things that are to be, I'm following, and I trust you can follow closely. He said, 'I'll prove to you that education and science and civilization and all these things that we so seemingly enjoy is of Satan and will perish. &gt;&gt; You and I need to agree with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You say civilization?" Yes, sir. This civilization came by Satan in Genesis 4 says it started off this civilization by building cities and having organs and having music and having all of these things. Not that music is of evil, but I can tell you that it can sure be used for evil. &gt;&gt; And we certainly know that today and so forth. And the civilization came by knowledge and knowledge is what the devil sold to Eve. &gt;&gt; That was her temptation. And that was the allurement. You'll be like God's. &gt;&gt; You'll know good and evil. And caused her to transgress God's commandment. So, and this I have highlighted for you. So, there will be a civilization in a world that we're going to. I'm glad for a powerful vindication behind this voice &gt;&gt; that we're going to, but it won't be this kind of a civilization. For in this civilization, we have sickness, we have sorrow, we have lust, we have death. Everything in this civilization's wrong. But in the civilization, but in that civilization, there will be none of these things. Why? Because we're already in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; The world is having their resurrection. But there's a spiritual resurrection taking place. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope I pray God make that a reality to you. This is the focus of my of my message to you. You split a molecule. split an atom and do so and so and blow you up. Take gunpowder, bang this, kill something. You take the car, take the gasoline, the materials out of the earth and loosen up the fibers so it can blow up and go down the road 90 m an hour and kill somebody. The kingdom of God will have no none of these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the kingdom of God, I don't care if I ever see another airplane. &gt;&gt; I ever care see another automobile &gt;&gt; or gas pump. He said, "What if science What if science had found something, a little medicine that could put in a spoon and could pour it in an old man's mouth or an old woman 90 years old and watch that watch the patient for about one minute and see them return back to a young man and woman with a blood that would never get old and a being that would never die. Why? He said the whistles would blow. &gt;&gt; The nations would scream. &gt;&gt; Death was over. &gt;&gt; I hadn't intended on this, and this isn't a place for light moments, but a an old man came from way out in the country, out in the hills, out in the sticks, and he had never seen the city or civilization. And he came in, looked at all these towers and I mean all this glass and marble and stuff and I mean he was just dazzled by it and he walked into a one of these places and he saw in a department store and he just standing there and he stands. He didn't know what an elevator was and he just saw an old woman walk in this elevator and the doors closed and the whole thing and he just stand there totally amazed. He doesn't know what's happening and a couple moments later the doors open. and a young lady walked out. He said, he said, "Just a second. I'll go and get my wife." He thought that's that's what it was doing. And this is what exactly what Brother Brandham is saying. Well, if they ever developed a med medicine and some kind of development and and and and you put it in a purse and they swallowed it in a few minutes, you washed them and they just started returning. Of course, everything would the whistles would go and the nations would scream and and they they've really developed something. Friends, we're not following some idol myth. &gt;&gt; This is a reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to convey to you things that you have heard and yet you believe in your heart, but I'm praying that God will make it such a a a conscious reality to you. A conscious reality that you'll feel it even within your being. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Your theophony, you have a theophony body, not this one, &gt;&gt; but one that's not going to perish." And he said, "Furthermore, it's right beside you. &gt;&gt; It is a word." That's why this word came to introduce you to that body &gt;&gt; and to give you your life's pathway from this one to that one. &gt;&gt; And he would speak his word. That's why Jesus said, "He that believeth on me shall never die." [Music] He didn't say that this body wouldn't pass away, but you will never die. &gt;&gt; You will never be separated from God because you take and embrace his word. &gt;&gt; You embrace his promise. &gt;&gt; Say my father promised this. Amen. &gt;&gt; So even in the resurrection of Jesus Christ when the women came to the tomb and found he was not there. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And they came with spices because they had a different agenda, a different program according to their culture. They came with spices to anoint his body. But he wasn't there &gt;&gt; and angels were there. And yet somehow they could they could not reason it away. But it wasn't that strange. It was just a fearful sight. And he said, "He's not here. Why are you seeking the living among the dead?" &gt;&gt; And I think of that today. &gt;&gt; I think of the churches and the organizations and the traditions. They have history. &gt;&gt; They have tradition. &gt;&gt; They have something that they can remember from years ago. I'm not talking about 2,000 years ago. I'm talking about now. &gt;&gt; And if we have just a history, if we have just a lot of theology, if we have just ceremonies about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, I can tell you friends that that that's empty. &gt;&gt; And people are seeking the living among the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus came out of the tomb and Mary. She sees him. Listen now. She just been with him hours ago. She's looked into his eyes. She's watched his lips move. She's heard the words fall from his lips. Who knows this face any better than hermen? &gt;&gt; Who followed and ministered to him? And now something has transpired. And the scripture says his visage, his body, his face was marred more than any man. &gt;&gt; His beard was pulled out. He had the spittle of those cruel Roman soldiers hanging on his face and the and the thorns in his brow. He was mutilated. &gt;&gt; But now stands a man. He's in a body &gt;&gt; and she supposes him to be the gardener in the garden. &gt;&gt; Jesus is giving you and I an exact example &gt;&gt; of what the believer comes to. &gt;&gt; This is not a myth, not a story. And if people don't believe that, they should empty out of their churches and forget Easter alto together. This is Easter. This is what Easter's all about. &gt;&gt; Not just that he came out of the tomb, but how he came out of the tomb. And what kind of a body did he have out of the tomb? Because then he said, "Because I live, you shall live also." &gt;&gt; You'll have the same kind of life by following the same kind of word. He was the word &gt;&gt; and you are the word &gt;&gt; if you believe his word. And he gives you the opportunity to believe that word. And how do we know which word it is? He vindicates it. &gt;&gt; The word comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Doesn't come to the Bible school. Doesn't come to a school of theology. Doesn't come to all this other uh you know studious and may be very sincere. I'm nothing against that. I'm say I'm not so against something as I am for something. And when God sends a kind of ministry sent in this day, &gt;&gt; you know what brother Brandham says concerning his ministry and you need to really take it serious. &gt;&gt; He speaks of the sign of the resurrection. This is the sign of the resurrection and continues from then. This is what you've been called under. We got Canadians here. We've got Americans here. We've got people from maybe the 30 some nations here. I'm a Canadian. We got all kinds of Americans. Brother Chris, Sister Cigid, and Brother Joe, Sister Barbara, Americans, and so many others. Maybe 250 of you or more. Have you ever seen the Constitution? No. You've never looked on it. I don't I doubt it very much. I I've never seen our charter, but I have faith that it's there someplace. I guess it's in some vault or someplace, but I believe that charter speaks of me. I believe that charter gives me certain protection. I believe your constitution gives you certain liberties and gives you certain protection. I'm an American and there's a constitution. I'm a Canadian or I'm whatever more and my nation's going to stand behind me because it's written &gt;&gt; and I'm a citizen of that nation that has written these things. Well, I have a prophet &gt;&gt; and I have a Lord Jesus that has told me I'm a citizen of another country. In fact, as my Lord Jesus said, you are not of this world. &gt;&gt; Do you want to say amen to that? &gt;&gt; If you want this world, you're welcome to it. &gt;&gt; You can have my piece of it. In fact, &gt;&gt; I'll take the next one. &gt;&gt; You are not of this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; That kind of life I desire. That kind of life he promised me. That kind of body he promised me. This one has sickness. This one has pain. This one has sorrow. This one has a troubled heart. But that one knows nothing of these things. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, this is a time to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Not only that Jesus raised from the dead, but I raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; We've raised. And I'll prove to you we're in the resurrection at this moment. &gt;&gt; While the world is advancing, the bride of Jesus Christ is advancing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ is having a resurrection &gt;&gt; even at this moment. But if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies &gt;&gt; by his spirit that dwelleth in you. &gt;&gt; It will even have an effect on this mortal body. &gt;&gt; It will direct that spirit will direct this mortal body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We won't think the same. &gt;&gt; We won't speak the same. We won't go to the same places. We won't act the same. &gt;&gt; Don't let the world try to dictate how you're supposed to live. &gt;&gt; The world doesn't know how to live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember when I just moved here to Cloverdale and my girls came from school and they said, "We've got a we've got we we've been introduced now. There's a class and it's a dance class." And the teacher knows more or less that we're Christians and believers and that we don't believe in those things. But the the teacher even said very specifically and this class has credits and if you don't enter this class, you're not going to get these credits. And so I wrote a letter and I sent it to about eight other ministers throughout this area and I wrote a letter to department of education to the superintendent of the school and to the principal and I said I understand that the educational system is to teach my children the basic and the fundamental things. So to assist them into in life and the basic things of mathematics and reading and and these skills but as far as their social life is concerned as far as the social life of my children are concerned that will be our responsibility solely our responsibility and not the educational system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be ours &gt;&gt; because ours is a a million light years perhaps from someone else's. Amen. And so the teacher at the next dance class said, "Well, I understand that some of you aren't able to take this." So he said, "Uh, you can go and just, uh, play with the basketball up on the stage or something." And man, a whole bunch of the young men and a whole bunch of the young people just vacated the dance class like that. He says, "Hey, hey, no, no, come back here. I know that you can do it." Now, they didn't want it at all. The whole thing collapsed. I said, "Praise God. &gt;&gt; Devil trying to sneak in and take your children and tell them what they're going to do." And uh and and and well, I will get off that right now because thank God for the school. &gt;&gt; If the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead, how are we doing for time? All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Ephesians he said, "And hath raised us up and made us to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." The scripture says, "Buried with him in baptism." &gt;&gt; Have you been buried with him? With him in baptism. &gt;&gt; Not the father. He wasn't buried. Not the Holy Ghost. It was Jesus Christ that was buried. You're buried with him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Buried with him in water and buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you following this? &gt;&gt; See, there may be someone here, maybe someone out on the internet. If you have faith in the operation that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead and that he came to be a propitiation for your sin and for your unbelief and he was your sacrifice and I take upon me his death &gt;&gt; and I'm buried with him not sprinkled with him. He wasn't sprinkled. He was buried and we're buried in baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and take upon ourselves his death. Then the scripture tells us that you have faith in the operation, God will raise you up. &gt;&gt; For those of you that have been baptized in this tank, let me announce to you that the moment you came out of the water, you commenceed the resurrection. That's what that scripture says &gt;&gt; through faith in the operation and you the scripture says Paul said in Ephesians and you hath he quickened not you he will quicken you he hath quickened &gt;&gt; it's a finished finished program &gt;&gt; not that you experienced the whole quickening but you hath he quickened &gt;&gt; who were who were what dead. Say it. &gt;&gt; We were dead in trespasses and sins, but he has quickened you. &gt;&gt; How did Jesus come out of the tomb? It wasn't possible that he could stay there because the apostles said, and they referred right back to the scripture, his his flesh could not see corruption. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have to have some uh medical science. He didn't have to have some kind of advanced program. His faith was in what was spoken by God's prophets. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's prophets. &gt;&gt; I want to get that across to you. When God's prophets speak it, it will happen. &gt;&gt; Whatever he has spoken in this word, it will happen exactly as he said it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out. You don't have to try to make it happen. It will happen &gt;&gt; and it's not not possible that his flesh would see corruption and he came out of the tomb. He was quickened. I will say that the children of the world or the children of humanity as a whole have advanced as I said earlier in a false resurrection. And the children of God that have the very life of God in them are actually in a state of resurrection. &gt;&gt; The life of resurrection is in them. Jesus said to the people he was being questioned. He said the children of the world they marry and are given in marriage. He was being questioned by spiritual religious leaders I will say at the time says if a man dies and the way they had it back then a man would die his brother would take him it to wife as it was with Tamar going through the three sons of Judah and if he died and didn't leave any seed then the next one would take him and he died and leave no children no seed so he said all seven had her to wife in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be?" Jesus said that they hired very much. And Jesus answering said unto them, "The children of this world marry and are given in marriage. But they, the children of the world, that's a group, all living, all breathing, one could be sitting right beside another, but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage. I want to emphasize they that shall be accounted worthy. I felt very very affected as I read these scriptures and knew this congregation I would be speaking to today. The children of the world. I'm moved. I hope you're not in that group. I truly hope as a servant of Christ, you're not in that group. All they can know is death &gt;&gt; in this life and death in the next one. &gt;&gt; But they who will be counted worthy of that world &gt;&gt; and the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They have a different kind of a status and a different kind of a life. We're not going to have all this involvement and entanglement of marriage and divorce and more marriages and whatever more. They're not going to know any of that because that doesn't exist in that civilization. Neither science or airplanes or automobiles or all these fine things that have come out of the earth. Thank God it'll be gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have a jubilee because I I don't have any wherewithal within myself to say I can attain to that. But I'm holding this word to myself and saying, "You said it, Father, and I believe it. Jesus didn't stop there. But they which are accounted worthy, listen closely, they, you, me, we, whoever by faith in the operation can include yourselves in that group. They neither marry nor are given in marriage. But he didn't stop there. He says, "Neither can they die anymore. &gt;&gt; For they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection." [Applause] &gt;&gt; He didn't say they're going to come on the scene. They're already there. &gt;&gt; We're already here. They that are accounted to that, they can't die anymore &gt;&gt; because they're children of the resurrection. They're already the product of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I'm not sitting here just waiting till somebody comes out of the earth. &gt;&gt; This is earth right here. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to a lot of earth. &gt;&gt; We're all earth. This is earth. And we're in the midst of a resurrection. &gt;&gt; We're children of the resurrection. Not we shall be, we are. &gt;&gt; That's the words of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You need to declare that. You need to believe that. Don't let a question mark come over your heart because with the question mark comes death. &gt;&gt; Let Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen be in your heart. &gt;&gt; I believe that. [Applause] Don't even say, "Well, I'll get things fixed up." Don't worry about it. Let God fix the things up. &gt;&gt; Surrender now to say amen &gt;&gt; to the every word that he spoke &gt;&gt; because only in that word is there life. [Music] If you don't have this message, the rising of the sun, you get it printed for you off the hub. And if you have it, read it again very slowly. I've been preaching for over 50 years. I began reading you this message again yesterday. Brother Brandham says things he his statements I'd like to read the first three or four pages to you where I began reading. They're so profound, so powerp packed. Sentence upon sentence are so potent. I read it to my wife. I said, "There isn't a there isn't a man that could say such a thing. It's God speaking directly to me through that vessel." Amen. &gt;&gt; So profound &gt;&gt; just left me numb &gt;&gt; as I thought as I read statement by statement. For those of you that don't know, I was sitting in that service 1965. I was sitting in that service. I was That's where he took the picture of the cloud and turned it. &gt;&gt; That's where I saw it was Jesus Christ. I saw it instantly. There just a little gasp went up over the people. That's where I and my wife were baptized immediately after the service. I can tell you that now all these years later, I got more in one hour. In one hour in this message yesterday, I got more than I did in the entire service. &gt;&gt; How can that be? You're right there. No. Well, I needed a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Larry, I tell you, I needed a resurrection. And in this resurrection, while the world got smarter, I became more spiritual. I became more understanding. I begin to see the program. Oh my goodness, how wonderful this program is. Oh, how wonderful it is. I I get to places where I just feel I can take one more step and I'm going to be an immortality. &gt;&gt; Leave this all behind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what's going to happen? &gt;&gt; It's going to happen to us. &gt;&gt; Going to happen to us. He said it. Not because I'm excited. He said it. He said it. He said it. Hallelujah. God said it. God promised it. My father promised it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's my father that said, "All that I have is yours." &gt;&gt; He said it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and his messenger come. Now I'll say it and you just have to accept it. If you were to take,00 plus services that were spoken by God's messenger and you listen to not hundreds but thousands of times &gt;&gt; that he revealed the secret of the heart. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I sat right on the platform and watched it. my own people out of my own church who I knew he knew nothing about because I brought them to the town and tell them their name. Tell them about their life. Tell them who they were praying for. Tell them where that person was living, the name of the town, and the direction it was from where they were standing. Listen folks, &gt;&gt; I hope you're smart enough to say no man could do that. &gt;&gt; I hope you're smart enough in this intelligent generation to say no intelligence could do that outside of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God speaking. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, you got all your history books. That has never happened since Adam. &gt;&gt; None of the prophets of the Old Testament did things like that. We have one where where where Samuel told Saul where his fathers asked us where that he was looking for the animals. But we don't have anything where people stood and by the hundreds and by the thousands and publicly and let science record it for the generations on coming. We never had that. What is it? It's a resurrection word. &gt;&gt; And then he tells the people that this is the sign of the resurrection. So, it put the people into a resurrection, not a resurrection mindset, but into a resurrection move. That's why I said we're not here. We're in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. This word is actually moving you to an ultimate change of the body, &gt;&gt; either in a rapture or if you die, you'll come out of that earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are in a resurrection &gt;&gt; and you have the power to change this body even resident in you at this moment. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for a resurrection. We're in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Not another Jesus. The same Jesus. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's the one who stood there and said, "As it was in the days of Noah, &gt;&gt; because those days were not right at his time, &gt;&gt; so shall it be." &gt;&gt; Amen. in the revealing of the son of man, &gt;&gt; the intelligence &gt;&gt; and the the ingenuity and the advancement and the powers and the scientific achievements that were back there. They will be again. &gt;&gt; When civilization has its resurrection, &gt;&gt; when it has its falls rising once again &gt;&gt; and with it will be more death. &gt;&gt; With it will be more wickedness. With it there will be gross sin, darkness over all the people. &gt;&gt; But in that day, in the evening time, there shall be a light. &gt;&gt; In the evening time, there'll be a resurrection. &gt;&gt; I'll send the signs of the resurrection. I'll show the power of the resurrection &gt;&gt; in front of the people and I'll let science confirm it. so that their own science can condemn them. &gt;&gt; I'll let their own camera take the picture. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why don't you rejoice? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Here's what he said. You are the seed &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say to every man, woman, and child that can understand my words, don't you dare let the devil put a question mark over that in your heart. &gt;&gt; You are the seed. He said, you are the seed of that resurrection of the s has dawned and the wave sheath upon the earth to make you recognize. This message was waved over the earth to make you recognize. You say, "Brother Bisco, why are you yelling and why are you preaching so hard?" Because I'm trying to get through. &gt;&gt; To that resistance of this generation. May God tear that wall down. &gt;&gt; May God remove that resistance &gt;&gt; out of your heart so you can come into the fullness of your inheritance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Going to start preaching. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He says, "And and the wave chief upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken." This message was waved over the earth to make you recognize that you were something different. &gt;&gt; You're a different make. &gt;&gt; You have a different uh a whole different uh uh uh sense about you. &gt;&gt; A different instinct. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If the spirit that raised him up from the dead, the word, the dynamic of the word dwells you in you, it'll also quicken your mortal body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says, how are we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone? He asked the question, how are you flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone? He said, while we were yet mortal sinners to drink and run around and commit adultery and all these things, he said, it's quickened. Why? He said, "The things died &gt;&gt; and you're resurrected. &gt;&gt; It quickens your mortal body. &gt;&gt; The things I used to do, I do them no more because I'm in a resurrection." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Therefore, your body is the temple of the dynamics." &gt;&gt; Because why? From the beginning, you were part of his mechanics. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why our body is a part of the dynamics because in the beginning we're part of the mechanics. &gt;&gt; And when your body, this mechanical body had to come on the scene. He took his dynamics and poured it into the mechanics. &gt;&gt; God knew you were going to be born the way you were born. He knew who your mother and father was. But they they were only instruments to bring you on the scene so he could pour the dynamics into you for this age. &gt;&gt; Oh, help me out. I still got something to preach. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Say, I'm not preaching for you. I'm preaching for myself. &gt;&gt; I'm enjoying it. &gt;&gt; He said Easter, rising of the sun and Easter morning, not only did he Let me say this. Here's some of the things that I just want you to catch. At Easter morning, not only did he raise, but his beneficiaries raised with him. &gt;&gt; They were in Christ at his crucifixion. &gt;&gt; I was in Christ at the crucifixion. &gt;&gt; They were in him at the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I was in him. &gt;&gt; For he was the word, and the word was made flesh. The word hung on Calvary. And I was part of that word. You're part of that word. The word went to the tomb. &gt;&gt; I was with him. You were with him. The word came out of the tomb &gt;&gt; in a resurrection. We've already had that resurrection. And then God brought you on the scene 2,000 years later in a body which was the mechanics. And the spirit that raised him from the dead comes into you and gives the mechanics some dynamics &gt;&gt; and turns you away from the world. &gt;&gt; What is it? The same resurrection power continuing in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pray God make it alive to you. We are his beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness and in a darkened world of unbelief where churches and denominations and so forth had drawn us out. And there's something in us calling. Oh, we want God. We're hungering and thirsting for God. We joined the Methodists and we joined the Baptist. We joined the Pentecostals and the Presbyterians and whatever more and still there was something wrong. We just couldn't find it yet. And all of a sudden, while we were groping in darkness, the great resurrection came. The great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus spoke about the revealed word, can I take just a few more minutes, please? &gt;&gt; When Jesus spoke about the revealed word, he was talking about himself. He was talking about himself in another time, in another era, in another age. Now I just want to take you quickly and I'm going to come to a close in the Old Testament and in the in the in the message uh in the message the rising of the sun. Brother Brandham takes you back to Exodus. I'm sorry, Leviticus 23rd chapter. And you've heard it before, but listen. God tells the people, I'll just do it rather than reading a quote, I'll just do it in in in a kind of dramatize it a wee bit. So, he's telling them, you're going to go into your promised land. And when you get in the land, he didn't put any specific dates on this. He says, "When you get in the land &gt;&gt; and you have swn your crop and the first ripe mature crop, &gt;&gt; you'll cut that down and you'll take that bundle &gt;&gt; not to Moses the prophet. You'll take it to the priest." Because God even knew that the prophet's ministry, the prophet's ministry at this time, the message would would give us a a full scope of the instructions. But brother Brandham says clearly that the that the priest during the church ages from Christ till now from the Holy Spirit the coming of the Holy Spirit till now would be the era of the priesthood a high priest. And so in the end time would come a mature the first grain that came all through the Old Testament right from the beginning until Matthew. &gt;&gt; Then came Jesus Christ. He was the first ripe wheat, &gt;&gt; the first sheath &gt;&gt; and he was cut down &gt;&gt; and nailed to the cross. &gt;&gt; He was the first mature one. And and there and there's a transition that's taking place for he was the lamb of God. He was the sacrifice. He was the prophet. Follow it now. Prophet, priest, and king. &gt;&gt; He was the prophet. And he was regarded as a prophet. He was cut down. And and then when he raised then from the dead, he was entering into his priesthood. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the chief came to the priest &gt;&gt; and he said he was waved over the people at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they now for the first time humanity received the same spirit that was in him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They became a God people &gt;&gt; because the same spirit that was in him now came into them. He said it's necessary that I go away. It's expedient I go away. If I don't go away, he won't come. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I must go away. &gt;&gt; And so now, while he's departing, he's entering into his priesthood. And then at the end time, here comes a ministry. Here comes a here comes the ministry that's going to reveal him again in the end time after the world has had a false resurrection of scientific achievement and advancement that is not getting them closer to God, but further away from God. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Pray that God give me strength to finish this. &gt;&gt; And in the end time &gt;&gt; in this message he says there has to be another sheath waving. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Another sheath. The same chief doing exactly the same things. Look at how the messenger look how brother Brandham come out of such utter humility. &gt;&gt; Exactly the same as Jesus. Look how he mingled with the people exactly as it was with Jesus. Look how Jesus went into the temple. Look how the prophet went into the denominational system. Look how he went into their churches. Look how he went into the Christian businessmen. Why was it? It was the same spirit doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; And the midst of it just began simply to do miracles. Miracles begin to happen. And then the multitudes came in Jesus' life. The men miracles happened. The multitudes came. &gt;&gt; Exact duplicate. exactly the same. &gt;&gt; It wasn't him or some big team behind him that was doing that. It was God doing it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Listen to friends. If you have a question mark over your heart, I'll announce to you, you're dealing with God. &gt;&gt; You're not dealing with me. You're not dealing with this church. You're not dealing with some organization. There is no organization. You're dealing with God. God did it. And you have to answer to that. I didn't do it. Brother Brandham didn't do it. He'd even just say, "I'm your brother. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; I'm just your brother." &gt;&gt; But then say to a person, "There isn't a thing in your life you could hide right now." Who's that talking? &gt;&gt; Who's that talking? There isn't a thing in your life you could hide right now. I know what that's all about. But I looked into those into that eyes and knew my life was naked before God. What was it? The same Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dwelling in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring a mature word. &gt;&gt; Not for his enjoyment, for a people. &gt;&gt; And that mature word in the end time, there had to be another chief waving. That's the message that is waving over the people now. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't waved for the people. It wasn't waved for Israel. It wasn't waved for Moses. It was waved to God &gt;&gt; by the priest. &gt;&gt; Waved to God as a memorial, as a declaration. There's more like this still in the field. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "The field is the world." &gt;&gt; Hello, friends. &gt;&gt; Hear my announcement. You were in the field &gt;&gt; when that first chief was waved, &gt;&gt; waved before God &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God came into the people and they were full of the Holy Ghost. And the memorial was, "Father, there's more like me. &gt;&gt; There's a Jesus people down there. They're still in the field. Their bodies are there." by the great operation of God. Bring them on the scene and the faithful Holy Spirit will come and possess them and give dynamics to the mechanics. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And if they're still living in the last day, I shall raise them up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in the meantime, I'll set a resurrection in order in the end time while the world has its resurrection of wisdom and resurrection of culture and resurrection of entertainment and resurrection of all of these things so high that they almost blow their understanding that goes beyond their grasp of their imagination. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll become so so scientific. &gt;&gt; In this age of technology, &gt;&gt; they will bite off that tree of knowledge and there won't hardly be a person that can keep up to it. and I'll make things so real. Until, as I heard the other day, women are having entering into like marriage relationships with men that look so real on the screen. And they have the husband of the woman in tears saying, "I've lost my wife. She used to be an active woman. She's a professional woman, but all she does now is sit and this new game that they and and it is so real. And they enter into all kinds of relationships and and she's actually feels married &gt;&gt; to a person on the screen. &gt;&gt; Satan used one of God's creatures called a serpent. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham describes him. You say, "Why would I believe Brother Brandham?" Because Brother Brandham stood and told a woman that was standing, a woman that I know real well, friends of our family, told her, "You're praying for a man. The man doesn't live here. The man lives just north of here. He lives in a town called Fort St. John, if he if that prophet could trace down in her heart and tell her what she was praying and who she was praying for and where that man lived and the next day I was driving along the road with him and he said, "There's a woman that came into the prayer line." I said, "Brother Brandham happens to be good friend of my family. I know her ever since I was a child." He said, "She was praying for a man uh uh shadowed by death with cancer." And as we drove slowly by, there was an old farmhouse, big white old farmhouse off to the right. And he by the time he drove past he says the man's in that house. &gt;&gt; Now that kind of wisdom &gt;&gt; that could go back yesterday or one year or 10 years or or 6,000 years and describe that creature &gt;&gt; manlike, &gt;&gt; maybe better looking than Adam was. And he offered her knowledge and was so enticing that she gave herself to it and entered into a relationship with the serpent and Satan inspiring the whole thing and brought forth a Cain &gt;&gt; who was an enemy lying to God's face. &gt;&gt; Do you know that God had more conversation with Cain than he did with Abel? read it &gt;&gt; by offering them. and he offered and right in the midst of you young ladies, I can tell you right here in this church that often this world and this age offers the young ladies graduating better jobs, better living standard, better automobiles than the guys that are out there struggling real hard to do it. That why? because it's that generation. &gt;&gt; It's that age. Don't let me go there. But in the midst of that, &gt;&gt; I'll bring a resurrection. &gt;&gt; I'll bring a resurrection of a message and it will be exactly opposite to what the standard of the world or the standard of the day or the age of the day. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; And in that day, I'll raise up a mature &gt;&gt; chief once again. and there'll be another crucifixion &gt;&gt; and they'll have to indict that generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They come against a message. They don't realize they haven't got the concept that the word is Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the revelations that you and I had to get. It's not just the Bible. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not just a series of doctrines. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; The person of Christ. And now he sends his dynamics. &gt;&gt; Amen. into the mechanics and that's what makes you the kind of people you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just talked to people just just last week. They said, "All we have in our church is old gay-haired people." &gt;&gt; I said, "Will you come to our church?" I said, "The whole front end is full of young men and young women, and they fill those seats on Sunday, and they fill those seats on Wednesday." And I line up and I see the cars lined up and after 37 years I say, "Oh God, this is a supernatural act." &gt;&gt; We don't have a program. We don't have anything. Have the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. A vindicated word in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a brainwashing. It's a soul washing. &gt;&gt; Changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in a resurrection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when this message first came, I'm closing now and was waved over this whole earth. Many of you, we're still in the earth. &gt;&gt; This body you're in right now was in the soil. &gt;&gt; God in his love and mercy allowed that ministry to wave over the people, over the congregation &gt;&gt; as a memorial. Think of it. Jesus saying it. Father, there's more like me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the field. &gt;&gt; They're still in the earth, but they're going to come. I know they're going to come &gt;&gt; because I can't lose one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is my resurrection message to you today. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my Easter message today. &gt;&gt; You are the one that's in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; You are the one that's having a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he said this, and forgive me, I'm just closing. It's been hard to close. Hard to close when you're not really fully done. And every bit of life that was in the seed has to come forth again. Every bit of life. &gt;&gt; I haven't got time, but you remember and I've just been I've just been in it. For those of you that have been here, I just touched on it. When the Apostle John saw into heaven and he saw the lamb and he saw the four living creatures and out came the antichrist riding in the opening of the seals. Antichrist was riding first a white horse of deception, then a red horse, a red horse of sacrifice and martyr martyology, then a black horse for the dark ages, and then a pale horse. And that's the first time, read it in chapter six of Revelation. That's the first time the horse rider is named. He said, "It's death. Hear me please. So for all these generations all all the ages while the horse riders riding riding out trying deception that doesn't work and he's trying martyrs and he slew them by the millions 68 million. I've read of some and brother Brandham said they could do nothing else but the spirit that was anointing them. They had to do what the spirit was anointing them. I give you one account. There was a man, you've heard of me tell it before. There was 22 people standing on a scaffold in a very very cold weather, very bitterly cold. and they'd stripped them naked, men and women, and had them standing there tied to freeze to death, but they could surrender if they would just recant and give up their faith. And no one would do that. And finally, when the frost and the cold begin to bite into their bodies, one man yelled that he would surrender. And they went up and untied him. And while they were untiding untying him, Brother Burkhart, another man was undoing his garments, &gt;&gt; throwing his coat off and and mounting the ladder and said, "Let not the ranks of the Lord be broken." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They could do nothing but give themselves. &gt;&gt; That was the Ox age. And then the man age, Luther, Wesley, the reformation, wisdom, and at the same time when Martin Luther at the age then comes the printing press and and the and and the advancement of technology and God used it. But the advancement of technology is rising and at the same time the the gospel is rising because uh Luther come out of the dark ages is just a sprig of wheat and then into the stalk and into the end time and in the end time the rider would be death himself. He would be named. Why? Why is he named? Because in that time would come a ministry that would be 100% life. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Death was riding in, but life is riding in. &gt;&gt; And he said, "All the life in the seed &gt;&gt; will come forth." &gt;&gt; And I rejoiced yesterday. All the power that overcome the deception is in us. &gt;&gt; All the power of the sacrifice is in this seed. &gt;&gt; All the wisdom that Martin Luther and all of them had is in this seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All the power of Pentecost is here. &gt;&gt; All the power of the sacrifice is here. All the wisdom of the man age is here. And all the anointing of the eagle age is here. &gt;&gt; All the life that was in the sea. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the power that is resurrecting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you're not the same. You're not the same at all. &gt;&gt; You're not You're not the same as you used to be. Forget that. You're not even the same like the church you came out of. You're not the same. I didn't do it. Somebody else didn't do it. Brother Brandham didn't do it. He's not even around. &gt;&gt; There's a force. &gt;&gt; There's a power. There's an in an anointing. There's a inspiration. There's a spirit. Whatever it is, but I will say what it is. It's the spirit of that word that came. That promise that came. It's a word. It's a promise to you. &gt;&gt; And I want you to take it very personally. Everyone, &gt;&gt; I want you to see this chief that was waved in this time. &gt;&gt; It was waved over all the people, but wasn't for all the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said there's father, there's more &gt;&gt; like me. &gt;&gt; And that's why the messenger declared emphatically, if the life of Michelangelo is in you, you'll do artwork. If the life of Bach is in you, you'll write music. And if the life of Jesus Christ is in you, you'll live out his life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; I speak to you today because you're children of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I would like to sing, please. Death hath no terrors. &gt;&gt; If you musicians, come. I'm not done preaching. I'm going to preach on in this song. It's 8:11. Those of you, why don't you folks stand? Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of an Easter is this for you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What kind of a resurrection is it for you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sing with all your heart now. Glory hallelujah to the lamb. [Music] Oh, glory hallelujah to the lamb. Jesus rose from the dead. He will triumph but as he said that's the victory from the grave rose again our soul to say oh glory hallelujah to the lamb these rapers now souls die daily to the world and sing oh glory hallelujah by the spirit power as he dwells with glory. Hallelujah. Jesus. He says the victory. Glory. Hallelujah. To the lamb. We see the single [Applause] rejoice Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Glory [Applause] to the L. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. [Music] Glory. Hallelujah to the lamb. Just before we sing this next verse, we put it up. You see the words? &gt;&gt; Can you claim those? &gt;&gt; Do you think they're worth shouting out? We'll rise someday. &gt;&gt; And after hearing today's service, I declare to you on the authority of God's word, every believer is in the midst of a resurrection. &gt;&gt; You're moving perhaps sometimes imperceptibly, but you are moving according to his promise. &gt;&gt; You are in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; You aren't even where you were a year ago. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have raised. &gt;&gt; The world is raising as a false resurrection. &gt;&gt; They &gt;&gt; that are accounted worthy &gt;&gt; of the resurrection and eternal life. &gt;&gt; Jesus said clearly, they'll never die. &gt;&gt; That is more powerful than the casket. &gt;&gt; That's more powerful than six feet of earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know something? [Music] Some of our most victorious services have been funerals. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the people are rejoicing. And all the neighbors think we're going to be crying and weeping. &gt;&gt; And here we're rejoicing. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul said, "It must be sown in dishonor. And it's raised in honor. It must be sown in weakness. And it's raised in power. It must be sown mortal. And it's raised immortal." Hallelujah. What's there to be sad about? &gt;&gt; We're in a resurrection. We'll rise again. &gt;&gt; We'll rise again as our savior rose glory to the lamb. Till they shall be brought upon glory hallelujah to the lamb. Jesus rose from the dead. He rose high the victory from the grave to say oh glory hallelujah to the lamb. Want to give glory this afternoon. I'm going to ask you brother Dona.
