If there be any need here, just make a known to him by lifting your hands. Father, we thank you this morning that we can come before you, Lord. Truly, our hearts are filled with love, a love that you have shed abroad. Lord, you have made it so easy for us to love you back when we look at what you have done, Father God, and the great sacrifice that you endure on our behalf, Father, and this great message of truth that you have brought in this hour, Father, to realize even this Sunday morning, many, oh God, are gathered to worship a God that they do not know. Father, they're still locked in darkness, but you have brought us out, oh God, into this great marvelous light. How thankful we are this morning to know that we stand before the presence of the living God. And know that by simply bowing our heads and closing our eyes, we do have an audience with you, Father God, to know that you have an attentive ear to every petition this morning. It give us such confidence, oh God, and such assurance to know that we can come boldly before the throne of grace this morning. It is a throne of grace for us, Father, because the blood has been shed for us from before the foundation of the world. When the lamb was slain in the mind of God, Father, we're so thankful for this free access. We come, oh God, thanking you for we know every need. We'll meet an answer before you, Father. If we come living, we can go rejoicing today. You know every need in our hearts this morning, Father. Would you just take your servant father, anoint him, oh God, and give him liberty to speak that which the spirit desired to say to the church this morning and give us a hear to hear, oh God, and the hearts to receive and faith to believe, Father, for the promises are unto your children today. For the needs that have been mentioned this morning, Father, this man Miller, oh God, we believe that you're more than able to save his soul. Father, &gt;&gt; even as the church of the living God pray and your children believe, Lord, I ask that in a supernatural way, you may intervene there, God, and that your hand of mercy can reach down to him, oh God, even when the bodies failing, may you save the soul and bring glory to your great name. We pray for our brother Tony and Sister Rebecca in Brazil, we ask that your hand be upon them. Would you take control of the meetings there? Let your presence be with them, Father, even as we believe you here with us this morning to minister the words to us. Take control of your servant and of your people as a committee is gathering to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. want to welcome all those who are visiting with us.

How we need our understanding open. How we need the Holy Spirit, your divine presence. I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that your holy spirit will surround every person in a personal way. Touch their hearts. Touch their lives, their souls, their minds. And today Lord, we want this testimony that we indeed love you. We want to have this testimony while we live out our lives. Each day that we love you, we want to serve you. We've come here, Lord, and now we have served you in worship. We want to serve you. Now, as the word comes, penetrate us. Loose, I pray, every bound person, not only present, but those in the invisible audience. Pray that Satan will be defeated today and that this will be a day of great joy when even angels will rejoice at the lost coming and the bound being delivered and your word going forth as a sharp two-edged sword. Let it do its work. We pray, oh God, we will stand merely as your humble servants to serve you in any way that is possible in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint us now speaker and hearers for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing while the choir take their seats. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. I love him. I love you because Jesus of me [Music] is my salvation on God. Just once again. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. We love you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Love you. [Music] Oh God. [Music] Oh God. [Music] So happy that you're all here today and your presence is a strength. I'm sure the Lord is pleased that you're here as well and I trust before the service is over you'll be very happy that you're here. I'll invite you to turn with me in your Bibles to Revelation the 17th chapter. I want to get directly into the word so we can cover what's on our hearts, Lord willing. Some subjects are a lot easier than others to address. And this is not one of the easy ones. So you uh just pray that God will you know give you understanding give us all understanding uh in this scripture uh Revelation 17 I'm going to start to read at verse one. And there came one of the seven angels, which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither, I will show unto thee the judgment of the great that siteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit upon a scarletcoled beast full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and 10 horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abomination and filthiness of her fornication. And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore did thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carried her, which hath the seven heads, and 10 horns. The beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world. When they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is. The last phrase is the title of my message. The beast that was and is not and yet is. You may be seated. I'll need you to be fully focused and in full have full control of your thoughts. Try not to be distracted by any movement and let's not move any more than absolutely necessary. The beast that was and is not and yet is in the scripture and especially in the book of Revelation when we find the word beast and you that are in the message and follow it, you know that uh there are two references to the beast and it is not the same beast in each case. There's two different words in reference to using uh reference to a beast in the in the book of revelation. uh in uh chapter five you find that there's four we say living creatures that are around the throne and they are referred to as beasts uh and here we find beast the word beast and there we find it quite frequently I'm going to give you the meaning of the two the ones that are around the throne are are called a living being that is the Greek word. It is a living being. Uh to be alive. The reference to be alive, to live, to breathe, to be among the living, not lifeless, and not dead. That's those living creatures, which incidentally, brother Brandham said, they were four anointings. And they are they he links them right back. I don't want to take time with it this morning, but links it right back to Eden where cherubams were placed to protect the way of the tree of life. not to protect the tree of life, but to protect the way of the tree of life because Adam lost his sense of direction. And they were and then uh when when God began to call his people out of Egypt and the Hebrew children now become the children of Israel and they and then they established their ranks and their positions in the wilderness when the after the tabernacle was built because in the tabernacle was the word that's always the focus and around the tabernacle where the tribe tribes in their in four under four different insignities or under four different signs which was a lion uh a man, a calf or a beast, a calf and an eagle. Those were the four and they were sign they were around the tabernacle. And then when the word came in flesh, there were four that recorded the movements of the word in flesh, which was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And then when John saw the heavens open and the lamb, there were these living creatures around them. And there were four horse riders which were uh which was Satan himself under four different disguises or four different masks and coming out into the earth to permeate and cover the earth with his evil influence. And those four living creatures representing an anointing that would come upon the believer, upon the elect. So we could more than counteract what Satan was bringing at that time. And so those four living creatures, that's why the word for the living creatures, beast, and the word for beast elsewhere have to be very very different. And the other beast which is referred to here in the 17th chapter which we read and other places in the scripture, it is a wild beast or venomous beast. That is why Esau was a wild man. Ishmamail was a wild man. Cain was a wild man. That traces all the way from Genesis straight through into uh into Revelation to the end time. We have those two spirits in the world. And this beast is not only wild uh untameable and venomous, but it is it comes from a uh the a further word which uh which constructs that word for the beast which is it it has reference to a trap uh a hunting of wild beasts to destroy. The purpose is to dis to destroy them and henceforth it figuratively speaking it is a preparation or a preparing of destruction of men. So this beast the intent is to destroy men and the very structure of the name is is it it conotmentates a a trap a snare to catch men. So, it's not, you know, a snare. For those of you that have a little bit of knowledge of it, I have uh fairly good knowledge of it, having come from the wilderness in the north and all the rest of it. When you set a snare, it is just a very thin wire. And the wire is is strong enough for the animal you intend to snare. And that snare is put on the path that that animal goes every day, usually to their food or to their drink or wherever it It's just in their natural uh everyday existence and they're just moving along like that going for their food going it's on a well well uh beaten path and the snare is put there and it's it's camouflaged so you can't see it at all till it's gone through it and has it around the neck and it and it and that's the end of it. It is set there and the purpose of setting the snare is to destroy. That's to take a life which is sad. But the purpose of the purpose that's behind this beast even the very uh uh makeup of the word is to snare to trap and it will it will catch men and humanity while they're in their normal activity of existence whether it's to live or to be entertained or just their natural existence they will be snared at that time and part of man. And the prophet tells us clearly and and you know it yourself well that man has an instinct to worship. He is not made like an animal in that has that has no instinct to worship. Man has an instinct to worship and this beast has laid his snare on that path. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man wants to worship and that is where he will ensnare them. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet and I have a a lot of quotes today. So I know it's hard to follow when a person's just reading but if you'll bear with me. He said he's making reference to uh scripture that spoke of uh of kings, certain kings. And uh he said he he makes reference to this and I'll show it to you. He's talking about kings that which is fallen five kings. And if he said if you want uh if you want that on from history, he said I'll show it to you and one is and one's to come. Now he said now watch the beast. Now, the beast wasn't a king. He was one which is and which is not and yet is and is not. He yet he is and is not. What is it? He said it is a succession. It's succession of the pope's power, &gt;&gt; a beast ruling. And then he said when pagan Rome was converted to make papal Rome because at one time it was pagan it was just a brutal political power which was in the time when Jesus Christ was here in his first coming. But now it just changed its mask uh and uh when pagan Rome became married to the Christian church under Constantine and so on. Pagan Rome was converted. He said, "And then it became the papacy which they had a pope instead of a king. And the pope is the spiritual king. That's the reason he's crowned spiritual king. Claims to be the viker of Christ." And uh he's on a seat. Now, this throne, this seat is is actually a throne or it's assigned in the New Testament to kings. She was on a a a throne. She was enthroned, the scripture which we read. And uh I will show you unto you the judgment of the great that siteth upon many waters. And she is enthroned. Uh just going to look for for that scripture, but I won't take the time just now. We'll come to it perhaps. And she's assigned this uh uh this seat. It it refers to the word seat in the scriptures actually throne and it's a stately seat or a throne assigned to kings to kingly power or royalty and uh has reference to God as a governor of the world or to the Messiah referring to divine administration and hence divine power belonging to Christ. Now I said that just as a little brief background. I cannot help and you'll understand this statement now at the end of the service but I cannot help is my own words but feel that we have turned a corner &gt;&gt; or at least uh the direction that the world is moving &gt;&gt; has been put into a much sharper focus &gt;&gt; with the events of the last few days. And I speak of this the astonishing importance that the world has placed upon uh the death and funeral of the late pope Paul. There are some prophecies which were spoken by brother Brandham God's messenger that take on greater meaning and new dimension. as we see these events happen. some of the comments that were made and this is all an integral part of the service this morning. John Paul's funeral was also one of the most prestigious drawing presidents, kings, and religious leaders from all corners of the globe, including President Bush and his predecessors Bill Clinton and George HW Bush. Italy's Minister of the Interior said that 1.4 4 million managed to file past the Pope's body during the four days he lay in state after waiting in line for an average of 13 hours. Some were less, but some were much more. Some were up to 24 hours. Uh the NBC Chris Matthews commentator said from Rome, "If you're not here today, you're not part of the world scene." They said of the pope, "Gifted with a tremendous affinity for language and an engaging manner, this pope forever changed the image of what a pontiff should be and what the leader of the mother church can accomplish both spiritually and politically." and that John Paul strove to reconcile the church with other faiths and to heal the centuries old sism within Christianity itself by encouraging a strong ecumenical movement around the globe. heads of state from more than 70 countries and five continents. An unprecedented collection of power for a papal funeral. In the second row, the first US president to attend a papal funeral, never before in history. George W. Bush sat with his wife Laura, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles of Britain, President of Poland, President of Iran, President Mosha Katsav of Israel, all attended. Also present were four kings, six queens as well as the United Nations Secretary General Kofan. There were also representatives from all the world's major religions. They said that Arabs sat with their checkered uh headdress. Uh Jews were there with their keepa. Muslims. The only nation that was not officially represented was China. A head of state, a king, a president's my own words now. A head of state, a king, a president or prime minister represents their nation and its people in his or her actions. That is a scriptural principle. When the head of state of a nation is there, God has not considered every individual there, but nationally speaking, they have been represented at that site at that place. Now, just before I show you some slides and I will hold some there while I make some other comments. part of the last will and testament of this late pope. And I want you to hear this while some of it it's it's fine it's between you know him and his own conscience. However, I want you to and I'm trying to be selective with my words, but I would like as you hear just this short paragraph, which is just part of a very very long last will and testament, which I've read all of it, be rem be mindful now that these leaders are present before uh this powerful man who's deceased. and this is his last will and testament. So in a sense, I don't say that they're standing there in a full agreement necessarily, but the one that they're giving this honor to, this is what he is declaring. Now, they're the ones that have come from all all the nations of the world. They're the ones who've brought their delegations and all of their officials to be represented. They're the ones who want to be seen and want to be uh present at this historical moment. And this is the one they've come to honor who has said, "I am completely in your hands in the name of the holiest trinity." Amen. Keep watch because you do not know. It seems that he's speaking to himself in his will. Keep watch because you do not know which day when the Lord will come. These words remind me of the final call which will come. The moment that the Lord will choose. I desire to follow him and desire that all that is part of my earthly life shall prepare me for this moment. I do not know when it will come, but like all else, this moment too, I place in the hands of the mother of my master. In the same maternal hands, I place all those now he is placing everything into Mary's hands. In the same maternal hands I place all those with whom my life and vocation are bound. Into these hands I leave above all the church and also my nation and all humanity. Now don't tell me he hasn't taken a position. And the leaders of much of the earth's population were standing there giving acknowledgment to the man who spoke these words. When John saw her, he marveled. He wondered with admiration. And that's the only thing that the angel that was showing him picked up and said, "Well, why did you marvel?" And brother Brandham a little later on he makes some comments. It's in the second seal. He marveled because when he saw all this wealth and pomp and glory and majesty, he couldn't comprehend that that marvelous sight could be responsible for the blood of the martyrs. &gt;&gt; And that's why he said he he couldn't understand that. Why did you marvel? And that's that was his difficulty if we can put it that way. Now they wondered, he wondered at it. He marveled at it. And that is to have an admiration, to wonder at or to be held in admiration. And the scripture says that all who dwell on the earth shall wonder. Now, I'd like to show this first slide if I could, please. You could do it from up there. I can't. I might need Brother Darren. I don't know if you need you to help me. You got it. Okay. Could we dim the lights a we bit, please? Now remember in the second seal, brother Brandham refers to the 17th chapter of Revelation. Now he said everybody just try to open your heart and let the Holy Spirit teach you. There came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and taught to me saying come hither and I will show thee the judgment of the great that siteth upon many waters. what is that? It's a woman can't be a man. And what is the woman symbol in the church in the Bible church Christ bride and so forth it's a woman the church he said now the waters what does the waters mean watch here said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the sitth are people's multitudes and he said unto me the waters which thou sawest where the siteth are people's multitudes nations s and tongues. He said, "This church is ruling over the world, &gt;&gt; set upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, spiritual fornication is taking is taking her doctrine." Right. &gt;&gt; And the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. They've been made drunk. And he said, talk about a drunken bunch. &gt;&gt; Drunken on the fornication, the stimulation of the wine of her fornication. and the world. I I feel uh very very moved in one sense and I would say I believe that the world I hope I have sufficient time this morning. I believe the world has turned a real corner &gt;&gt; when not one, not two, but three US presidents &gt;&gt; uh come and bow and kneel &gt;&gt; and pray &gt;&gt; in front of that corpse. &gt;&gt; Now, it's not just them as individuals. They are what they are before God. And it's not just this corpse of this man. It's what he represents and what they represent. That's what God sees. What he represents and what they represent. He represents a prostitute church. &gt;&gt; He represents a mother of harlots. &gt;&gt; And they have doctrine, denominational doctrine. Not one who can take the whole word of God &gt;&gt; and therefore are drunken on that into the point if you know what an alcoholic is a drunken person you cannot make him realize his condition and you can't make these people realize their condition they will not accept it &gt;&gt; will not acknowledge that to me is an astonishing picture and I can tell you one. It's one that God saw. You might as well see it. And John was made to behold it as well in some way, in some fashion. We're seeing it in one fashion. We're seeing it in one way, but he saw it in another way. And he marveled at all of this majesty, &gt;&gt; all of this pump, all this amazing uh church. this woman, how could she ever be so cruel as to slay? Because you cannot in your mind even right now and people cannot accept that that is such a reality. But God has not forgotten that under those skirts is the blood of martyrs. &gt;&gt; The martyrs of Jesus Christ who died by the millions to stand for the truth. And the fact that they've been able to robe it and make it acceptable to the world has not changed God's mind. President Bush has said, "The Catholic Church has lost its shepherd. The world has lost a champion of human freedom, and a good, faithful servant of God has been called home." in his native Poland. That witness launched a democratic revolution that swept Eastern Europe and changed the course of history. Throughout the West, John Paul's witness reminded us of our obligation to build a culture of life in which the strong protect the weak. And during the Pope's final years, his witness was made even more powerful by his daily courage in the face of illness and great suffering. We will always remember the humble, wise, and fearless priest who became one of history's great moral leaders. Kofi Anan quite apart from his role as a spiritual guide to more than a billion men, women, and children, he was a tireless advocate of peace, a true pioneer in interfaith dialogue, and a strong force for critical self- evvaluation by the church itself. I offer my deepest condolences to Catholics and others around the world who were touched by his life and prayer and lifelong dedication to nonviolence and peace. Shimon Perez on behalf of Israel, John Paul embodied the best that is within all mankind as well as the commonness of humanity. His actions and statements transformed relations between the Catholic and Jewish faiths and made a funnal impact on the struggle against anti-semitism. I can assure you that this is moving right down the path of prophecy &gt;&gt; and bringing together the people and making dialogue between all manner of interfaiths or the faith of the different religions is precisely his role. &gt;&gt; That's what he was called to do. But you would have never had a Jewish leader saying anything of this kind before now. &gt;&gt; Tony Blair throughout. Now when they say Tony Blair, I don't see Tony Blair. I see the Philadelphiaian age. &gt;&gt; I see the nation that sent people in the last age, sent missionaries all over the earth. When I see Tony Blair and the United Kingdom and I I think of India 150 years under England and uh all different nations within Africa under England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and islands of the sea and on and on and on. This was this was the power that ruled the waves in the last age. And this was the power that this was the nation that spread English all over the world. And this was and God saw that they colonized much of the world. God saw that and he intended it to be that way. So that because he knew that the last messenger is going to come speaking not German, not some other language but English. &gt;&gt; And everybody has a thirst for English. &gt;&gt; We can't change that. That's the way it was. That's the way it is. May not be your mother tongue, but that is the message. The message came in that language. And so here's a man throat uh speaking Tony Blair uh throughout a hard and often difficult life. He stood for social justice on the side of the oppressed whether as a young man facing the Nazi occupation in Poland or later in challenging the communist regime. He never wavered, never flinched in the struggle for what he thought was good and right. Archbishop of Canterbury, Pope Paul. John Paul was the leader of manifest holiness and a faithful and prayerful friend of the Anglican Church. There will be there will be time in the days ahead for the proper tributes to be paid. For now, we remember his life and ministry with thankfulness and hold the church that he led in our thoughts and prayers. Billy Graham, Pope John Paul was unquestionably the most influential voice for morality and peace in the world during the last hundred years. Where have we gone? &gt;&gt; His extraordinary gifts, his strong Catholic faith, and his experience of human tyranny uh and suffering in his native Poland all shaped him. And yet he was respected by men and women from every conceivable background across the world. His courage and perseverance in the face of advancing age and illness were an inspiration to millions including me. And this was the Palestinian leader. We will miss him as a distinguished religious figure who devoted his life to defending the values of peace, freedom, and equality. He defended the rights of Palestinians, their freedom and independence. This morning this morning I just received notice one was thank you brother Burkhart and other came from Temple Institute from Rabbi Richmond. Rabbi Richmond had been summoned to the security department that controls the Temple Mount. And in a news item, they said that two Temple Mount activists were given a behindthecenes look at the approach Israel's police and government is taking towards Jews who visit Judaism's holiest site. You have to realize all of this is happening right at this time. And I hope you're spiritual enough. I hope you've been in the message enough. I've hope you have absorbed enough to know that a prophet has declared that Israel's coming to Israel being called back. They heard a trumpet. The feast of the trumpets was to Israel. And the and the trumpet sounds to them is that urge within that call back not just to their own land but to establish their temple worship. They have that not not only an urge they have a compelling. &gt;&gt; We must do it. And now the government has taken a position and absolutely forbid them. In fact is they said that Rabbiheim Richmond of Jerusalem's Temple Institute was summoned to a meeting with Mr. Chiron Michael, an investigator of the office of the ombbudsman of Israel's Department of Public Security today in order to present complaints about the way Jewish visitors to the site are treated and it's quite lengthy, but this is exactly what has been declared. The Israeli government's message is clear. All Jews who are interested in the Temple Mount are considered to be dangerous and must be stopped at all costs. On the one hand, I just came back from seeing all these nations gather at Awitz in support of a people that have been liberated to go back to their country. Right? &gt;&gt; But those same nations that remain silent then are silent now when they want to reach the objective for which they even have a nation &gt;&gt; so that we can worship. So we can have Can you believe that any person you can go up there and pray? Muslims can go there and pray. Arabs who never live there can go up there and pray. Buddhists can go up there and pray. But the Jews who went back there for the purpose of establishing a nation can't go there and pray. Absolutely forbidden to pray. &gt;&gt; They can go and walk around it but can't pray. Can you imagine how insane the government and the world has become? But the same ones while they could not support them to say we as the nations of the world and the United Nations say for the in the sake and in the honor of democracy, in the honor of of of a people that have been so uh persecuted, certainly they must be able to go to the site and pray. But rather than do that, they're in front of a beast system &gt;&gt; in admiration. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; Giving admiration and honor &gt;&gt; to something to a system that has brutalized humanity for centuries. And I wondered, I wondered at her, to behold, and to look and to view attentively, to contemplate. I heard some say, "I was just in an airport and I just had an urge. I had to go. I had to fly to Rome to be there. Such such inspiration. The time may well come if other things that the prophet has said will take place. time may come when you too because of the stand that the message has taken and obviously the stand which we take and the messenger declared it, we declare it, the scripture declares it and if we give voice to it, you will not be the popular person on the street. &gt;&gt; You might as well forget it. &gt;&gt; You will not be the popular person on the street. if you wanted to be abused and perhaps to be roughed up and maybe even thrown in prison. Uh if I spoke these things in Peter St. Peter's Square, uh so named uh you can be sure that uh we we would have been handled very roughly. &gt;&gt; And if you had some kind of an edict in the country that said you can no longer hear that tape, read that message or go to that place. If we had such a thing, I think that we should take the position that we ought to live as though we were banned from that &gt;&gt; and we want to get our hands on it so desperately. You are banned from going to the house of God. You cannot worship around the doctrine that you believe any longer. You would be so intent on getting there. I must see their face. I must shake their hand. I must say, God bless you at all cost. That's what you would want to do. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that's the way they feel in China right now. &gt;&gt; And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. John says he wondered with great admiration. And brother Brandham goes on to say, she was such a beautiful thing with crosses and everything on her. How in the world could she be guilty of drinking the blood of saints? It puzzled him. And now he's going to tell him. In the tyrant church age, brother Graham takes a scripture and one that's been very very much on my mind in this morning's service. Who is able to make war with the beast? tell you there was a lot of power represented in that room and none of them offensive. &gt;&gt; None of them offensive to what that system does or has done. said, "Now there are present some great names in the world." Brother Brandham says there are some mighty nations, but right now Rome is calling the tomb. This is a n wrote 1960. The pope is in the driver's seat and his power is going to hear the prophecy. His power, remember now when this messenger was declaring this on the soil of America, there had never been a president to attend a pope's funeral. But he was saying and his power is going to increase and no one can war against him. &gt;&gt; Listen this prophecy. The false groups will come together &gt;&gt; in a world council of churches. And this world council of churches is the image to the beast. &gt;&gt; It wasn't when he said it, but he said it will come that way. It will be that way. And I want to announce to you, you have arrived. &gt;&gt; You're there. &gt;&gt; It's already happened. And here's one man, one voice in the midst of a multitude of voices &gt;&gt; declaring something that sounded impossible. &gt;&gt; I have here also in my notes I have uh the first meeting of the World Council of Churches. World Council of Churches International organization that aims to bring together Christians. Now, this is not the Pope. This is not from the Vatican. They're not even represented. They only sent a represent representative to one of the later meetings. I don't know the first one as a observer. Observer in the full sense of the word. The World Council of Churches, international organization that aims to bring together Christians of different denominations, established in 1948, which incidentally was the was the same year that Billy Graham's ministry went out to the world, the same year, not the same year that the angel of the Lord came to brother Brandham, but the when his ministry really went worldwide, and that was a uh the a restoration of the of the gift, a revival that broke out at that time in 1948. Uh, Israel is recognized by the world body and it it it has a membership of more than 100 countries and more than 300 churches which is nothing now including the Orthodox, Anglican and Methodist churches. That's where they started. Orthodox, Anglican, and Methodist. You ought to see the you ought to see the uh directory now because not because they thought it was a good idea, but because the word of God in the mouth of a prophet said they will come together under this headship. &gt;&gt; And he said further that the that the Roman church will uh uh will suggest that they should get together for fellowship and for dialogue. And they have done so. And it happened right in our city. This is the first time in history that they took communion together. It happened in Vancouver. &gt;&gt; So that's where they started. But they will come together. And furthermore, uh, thus sayeth the Lord, that system of the World Council of Churches is the image erected to the beast. And I beheld another beast. If you want to turn to it, let's turn to Revelation the 13th chapter, starting at verse 11. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth, and had two horns like a lamb, and he spake like a dragon, as a dragon. And he exercisth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth, and them which dwell therein, to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire to come down come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound had the wound by a sword, had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life under the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads. and no one might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 600 three score and six or 666 in the church ages. Now in the resume of the ages, do you mind if I read? &gt;&gt; Are you following me? All right. Says, "Now remember it was imperial pagan Rome that fell by the sword." It's why the scripture says he was wounded by the sword. I'm giving you what brother Brandham said concerning that. That's why you need your full focus &gt;&gt; because you'll find a word in the quote that goes back to the scripture. It was imperial pagan Rome that was that was here when Jesus was here. That Rome was felled by the sword. But she was healed of her death stroke when she joined to the nominal church of Rome and incorporated paganism and Christianity and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire. Now if you even look at the ceremony, if you look at the ceremonial aspect of this church, which is so foreign, I'll tell you what, if we had the body of William Brandham here and you came forward and knelt at a little rostroom, they'd blast that out and every newspaper in the country, this world council of churches and every church and every Pentecostal church and every Baptist church and everybody else would call you a bunch of fanatics. You heretics, you cultists &gt;&gt; and yet they do it. &gt;&gt; Their leaders do it. &gt;&gt; Their whole nations are represented there. &gt;&gt; And it's and to even to say a word against it would be, you know, what kind of bigot are you? I say what's good for the goose is good for the gander. &gt;&gt; But they don't want the same equal thing. &gt;&gt; They would blast you right out of everybody all over this country. All over this country. They would call you and probably have a reason to do so. And that is why I say those pictures up there to me are are ashamed. We've turned a corner &gt;&gt; and God has seen where we are. &gt;&gt; People are critics of this message say, "Well, we heard that he there was people down there that thought he might raise from the dead." So what? What's wrong with that? I hope if I I hope if if there ever day comes that my coffin is here that you folks might say, "Praise God, he might come out of that thing." &gt;&gt; Do we believe it or we don't believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and it became pagan. They borrowed from they borrowed from the Levitical priesthood and taken robes, &gt;&gt; but they've glamorized them and glorified them and and waving the sensor and all of it. It's it's it's things that they've borrowed from the Old Testament &gt;&gt; and then they've invented things that aren't in the scripture at all. Multitudes. Millions and millions of candles. I wish they had fed some people for the millions of dollars. Can you imagine what this thing cost? &gt;&gt; Where do you have a candle being lit in the scripture? [Music] &gt;&gt; Where do you have that? &gt;&gt; And I put all humanity in the hands of the maternal mother. And there's Protestants who are supposed to deny such a thing. &gt;&gt; You talk about a not only a fallacy, you talk about a cult, that's a cult. They say a cult is following a man, but that church is following a woman. &gt;&gt; A woman who had to go to the upper room, a woman who had to get the Holy Spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; And they've borrowed and taken all kinds of superstitions and bring things and made a man a viker of Christ on earth. I ask, what a what an imbecillic thing to do. If indeed you believed he was a viker of Christ, why pray for his soul after he's gone? &gt;&gt; Why offer prayers? &gt;&gt; Does he need prayers? &gt;&gt; For what? Is he in purgatory or where is he? Why pray? I say their own actions deny their belief. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; This Roman Empire, Holy Roman pagan empire, &gt;&gt; that still has the all the all the cruelty of the red horse head, red horse and all the darkness of the black horse and all that which they the deception of the white horse, the deception, the cruelty and the darkness are all wrapped together to make the pale horse. And finally, she becomes identified in the end time because the prophet comes out and declares in the face of it, it's death. &gt;&gt; The rider's death. &gt;&gt; And some in the Protestant system say that horse rider, it was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And you have a messenger come and say it's not the Holy Ghost, it's Satan. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroyed her. It will endure until Jesus comes and destroys it. But Rome is not going it alone. Her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute authority by the World Council of Churches. And that is what we are viewing now. That's what your newspapers are stuffed with. That's what the Time and the rest of magazines will have. But for the believer, you see it so you don't have to marvel anymore. &gt;&gt; You're not filled with amazement. You're not viewing it with admiration. You're viewing it in truth. &gt;&gt; And you see exactly what it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's an incredible thing. And he goes on to say, "This may seem far-fetched to some, but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches, the churches are controlling politics. and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control. This ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head. Even though the people did not envision it that way in 1948, there's nothing said about Rome. They're not a member. They're not even an observer. But and they didn't envision it that way. But in the end, it will be that way because it has been spoken, thus saith the Lord. This wasn't just a Kentucky hillbelly out of Kentucky that went to the seventh grade, my brother, my sister. This is a vessel tapped into the wisdom of almighty God that is declaring this for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. may seem far-fetched and I can preach this. I can shout it out because I remember in my lifetime when I still believe these things and it was so far from reality. I've had I've had Lutheran say to me, you know, the World Council of Churches, uh, the moment they join that, I'm out of here. I'm history. It joined. They joined, but they didn't make it history. They stayed right there, bound bound to the daughter, &gt;&gt; bound to their mom whose mother was a prostitute. He said this is so because in Revelation 17 3-6 which was part of our text it states that the mystery Babylon is seated on the beast. She is controlling she is controlling the last or fourth empire. This Roman church is doing that and with the world church system. Now notice the woman that John saw was sitting on a beast. The beast was her power. The beast is always a power. So he saw this woman, the church, but she had a system. And the system was the beast. And he says so very clear. He said that this Roman church is doing that. The church as we know as the Roman church. He said with the world with with the world church system under her Rome will be controlling. So she's taking and gathering up the church system because that is her power to deliver her or take her to her goal and her objective. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding it? And John saw that and a prophet comes in this age to show us, to open it, to expose it to us. And I hope that I'm being a a wee bit of an echo this morning to make it even a greater reality to you. And some of you young people have never read it. You need to get in there and read it. Read the resume of the church ages. Read the seals and you'll find out how the the prophet of this day exposed that system and exposed what was going to happen and declared it in the simplest language. Nobody needs to miss it. He declared this is the way it's going to be. She's going to take control. And I'll tell you what, friends, this last week has real openly made it very clear. Anybody that anybody that misses it now, I say is blind, blind, blind. I say what is it? I I said it's a darkness, gross darkness has come upon the people that they can look at that and somehow feel that that the right kind of thing, the right kind of respect, the right kind of whatever and to disguise it into a a a funeral type of ceremony and call peoples of the earth in front of that uh body of a man. Now I tell you, he has much to answer for. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says clearly, a nun does not go into the nunnery to be a bad a priest does not go into the priesthood to be a bad person. This pope did not come into the priesthood to be a bad person. It's the system that corrupts them because the system has been developed over all of these centuries and they have adopted creeds. They've adopted traditions. They've taken in the doctrine of devils. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which is the seed. &gt;&gt; That's the seed. A doctrine is a seed. And when you receive a seed, you bring forth that kind. Eve received a seed of a serpent and brought forth a cane. And no wonder Cain. Can you imagine? I can understand if you sit and listen to me and reject it. I could understand if you listen to the best minister in this message and rejected it. I could perhaps understand because it's written that you could listen to Jesus Christ. You said, "Oh, no, not Jesus. I could understand if you did cuz there's many that did." But Cain is the only human I know that had God come and preach him a sermon. Right. &gt;&gt; God preached Cain a sermon &gt;&gt; and Cain turned it down. &gt;&gt; How do you turn the creator of the universe down? Goes to show if you're not birthed of the living seed of God. You can't see it. &gt;&gt; Might say, "Well, what about predestination? I God's God and he couldn't accept it. He couldn't receive it for he was of the wrong seed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You might say, "Do how do I know if I'm of the right seed?" What are you doing? Are you receiving it? Are you setting it off as unimportant? If you receive it and say, "That's my life. That's my breath." Hallelujah. The right seed. It lives off this word. The right seed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why when that seed, that light struck the seed, something happened. And if nothing happens, I'd call on God with everything was in me. &gt;&gt; You say, "What would happen if you didn't feel as though you're the right seed?" I'd live for him anyway. &gt;&gt; I'd live for him anyway. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't the chance I could be pulled out of the flames of hell and receive a better judgment. I'd live for him anyway. &gt;&gt; Only a fool says in his heart there's no God. The beast is the world church system. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. &gt;&gt; His tracks are all around us. &gt;&gt; His tracks are in your city, in your community. The tracks of this world church system that give themselves &gt;&gt; to this beast or are the beast for this power. Rome is riding to her destiny &gt;&gt; on this power. &gt;&gt; Oh, so many declared, "Oh, we're not part of it. We're not part of it." But their leaders have succumbed &gt;&gt; to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they can't withstand this kind of magnificence, &gt;&gt; the power of her, the richness of her. I looked at some of the people on my computer and they weren't even as high as as as the base of the pillars. Those pillars were raised up when it's all that gold &gt;&gt; and all this royalty and how it was decked out. Is nobody going to stand up and say you're a corrupted, filthy &gt;&gt; harlot church. &gt;&gt; But you need to see it. the way God sees it. &gt;&gt; And there is no other way to see it. &gt;&gt; She had a cup and even it was gold of her of the wine of her fornication. People were so enamored and they were so gripped and so taken by all of this doctrine and and the wine of her fornication, which is her doctrines. And people were intoxicated with it. Right. &gt;&gt; Thus he said all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in their head or hand with their intelligence or their or their fellowship. This mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine &gt;&gt; of the world church system which is trinitarianism. as his opening words in his will. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Holy Trinity, &gt;&gt; in the name of something that doesn't exist, &gt;&gt; in the name of something that they themselves invented, &gt;&gt; and I also read of the history of how it had its beginnings, the Trinity, and it definitely happened in the 300. And there was uh 325 and just beyond that when some of the theologians Tertullian was one and two others and they had definite thoughts on it. He says and the mark of the hand means they will do the will of the world church. They will do it and with this great power the church system will persecute the true bride. &gt;&gt; That's what we're in for. And if it happens, you may lose your job. They may tighten up. They may say, "Well, you go to that church." Yeah, but we haven't knelt before a dead carcass yet. I throw it right back in their face. &gt;&gt; I had a man who turned against this message. I led him to Christ. At least I thought I was when he was 28. I couldn't even recognize who he was yesterday. and he might be here. But right away the serpent seat bothers him. Said, "We're in the image of God." And I just turned my hand around to all the people walking around there and White Rocket says, "This is the image of God." Said, "Don't disgrace my God. &gt;&gt; Don't insult my God. It's not the image of God. &gt;&gt; This has come out of the serpent seed. &gt;&gt; God doesn't act like this. God doesn't look like this. &gt;&gt; I don't want to make an issue of it. Tell you what, Baptist is say whosoever will. That's exactly right. But they won't &gt;&gt; and they don't want it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, you hear me? &gt;&gt; The image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching. It's already doing it. already done everything. &gt;&gt; Thought we'd disappear. &gt;&gt; Thought we were a bad dream. &gt;&gt; Somehow close my eyes and when I open them, you'll be gone. &gt;&gt; When they open them, there was more fanatics. &gt;&gt; There's more who believed it. &gt;&gt; And we're further down the road than we were yesterday or last week. I say hallelujah to God. God by the Holy Spirit is opening up his word and we believe those things that have been laid here in the prophet's message. I'll tell you what you might say. I say prophet too much. You need to get into it. You need to hear what he said. You need to you need to take those lines and find out and discover. &gt;&gt; This wasn't some light stuff. This isn't fluff. &gt;&gt; This is meat and substance. &gt;&gt; This will give you strength. Nothing else will give you strength &gt;&gt; to withstand the spirit in this day and age. &gt;&gt; If Satan could, if he was able to, he'd even take us of the message and soften our approach and soften our our feeling to it. You know, all mankind is good and so on. We're not talking about mankind. We're talking about the system that man subjects himself to. her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it. But before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches, the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord. And I also believe that. I believe that. Looking forward to that. &gt;&gt; God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb. The prophecy. Here's a prophecy. The United States will come to a time that church and state will unite together. I'd say the United States came closer to that. this last weekend than she ever has in her 200 plus years of existence. Wake up, my dear friend. Wake up. You're closer to it than you ever thought before. &gt;&gt; There's no nation. &gt;&gt; Our prime minister was there. No surprise he is Catholic. &gt;&gt; You can well believe that they will certainly support and do everything they can for that cause. in the mark of the beast 36 years before it happened. The United States will come to a time will not might come to a time that church and state will unite together and Protestant and Catholic will throw their things together to fight communist. &gt;&gt; Where'd you ever hear that? &gt;&gt; It happened. And you people except for the smallest and youngest of you all live to see that this pulp with his power and America with her power united together to bring it down. &gt;&gt; I say that prophecy of 36 years ago happened exactly as he said it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what church you come out of, you never had a prophecy like that. You never heard another preacher say it. You people out of the callings, you never heard it that way. You never heard it that way. Out of Pentecost, you never heard it that way. &gt;&gt; You Catholics, you never heard it that way. But here come one out of the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; this nation will &gt;&gt; unite &gt;&gt; with the state and church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Unthinkable &gt;&gt; 36 years ago. absolutely unthinkable. &gt;&gt; That is the most heretical kind of statement you could imagine. &gt;&gt; America, &gt;&gt; fundamental Bible belt &gt;&gt; with all of her uh uh all of her preachers and and wide open on the radio and televisions and televangelists and all this things going to unite church and state. I tell you what, the highest office and three of the presidents of the most powerful nation on earth bowing and kneeling at a rostrm with their hands and their mouth moving in prayer was anonymous sign to me and left me feeling with a very quivering &gt;&gt; inner being at the time that we're in. &gt;&gt; And I hope you're quivering before this service is over. And don't be taken up with all the little things that would consume you. Keep your eye on the goal. Keep your eye and focus on what the message is really bringing to you. And he says the Protestants and Catholic will throw their things together to fight communists. And it's exactly playing into the hands of what God said right here. &gt;&gt; And you Protestants laying yonder sound asleep. I tell you, he's still prophet. &gt;&gt; He knew they were sound asleep. Sound asleep reading a love story magazine. &gt;&gt; I hope there's nobody here got one in your house. &gt;&gt; I'd get rid of it. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Get rid of that trash. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be rocked to sleep by some entertainment or something instead of the Bible and out gadding around somewhere in some kind of a party instead of in a prayer meeting somewhere a fussing at one another about little old petty things that don't matter that much. They might matter, but they don't matter that much. You ought to be on your knees somewhere if you know what eternity meant. &gt;&gt; You kids know what eternity means? &gt;&gt; Eternity. Eternal life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life, my brother, my sister. &gt;&gt; He talks about how the Judas spirit, because the Judas spirit held the bag, he's making direct reference. And I'm going to mention something of the nicicoatan system. I hear in the message people, oh that's nickelatan. That poor soul doesn't even know nickelan means &gt;&gt; in the light of what a messenger has said. &gt;&gt; And he said, see how the Judas spirit came back as a rider on a white horse. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; You know about Judas? You know how he betrayed Christ? Now he came back on a white horse. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here prophet just takes him right out of Eden out of out of the garden of uh garden of Gethsemane rather. Takes him right out of the garden and takes him right out of the last supper and puts him on a white horse in the book of revelation. As the same spirit there that was riding there and he rode on the next horse and he rode on the black one and he rode on the pale one. &gt;&gt; It was that same spirit and rode right into a church system and was here today &gt;&gt; last week before the world. son of predition. &gt;&gt; So close to the real just as Judas was close to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; A crown was given him a white horse rider. how he said the spirit was now in the leader of the nickelan system and he was a triple crowned pope who sat as god in his temple calling himself the viker of Christ. If viker of Christ means instead of Christ or in place of or on behalf of God then the pope is calling himself the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Maybe you never heard that before. You're hearing it now or disposing the Holy Ghost acting for him. That was the Judas spirit in him doing that. See how he conquered going forth conquering and to conquer. I say last week was the perhaps the greatest evidence and maybe the only evidence that you've seen in your newspapers, heard on your radio or saw. I I hope not a television screen, but at least on the computer, you can see it on NBC, on computer, the video clips, and you see them uh the parading down and and coming before giving great honor and uh and so on. Uh there's only one conclusion you can come to. He has conquered &gt;&gt; without a missile, without a tank, without an atomic bomb, without an army. He has conquered. Christ did not do that. The only ones that came to him were already predestinated by the father. And the church says &gt;&gt; already predestinated by the father. He didn't have to come out and ride out and conquer us as it were. He just came and showed himself. And when he we we when we saw the bridegroom, the bride fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; And so on and on it went that spirit. And one day it will become truly incarnate in a man who will head up the world council of churches. He will head up that &gt;&gt; just as we have been saying. And by this by his gold, remember Judas held the bag. &gt;&gt; Amazing how you tie the two together. Judas held the bag and I still hold the bag. That spirit still holds the bag. He will control the whole world and that antichrist system will own everything and try to control everybody. But Jesus will come back and destroy them all with the brightness of his coming and their end will be the lake of fire. I have some other things but I just want to come to this and we're going to close Some people tell me that uh when I preach so hard it's nice to see me smile once in a while. So going to smile. There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias or Elijah when the heavens were shut up three years in six months when great famine was throughout all the land. There's a lot of good people &gt;&gt; and there are a lot of widows, &gt;&gt; a lot of fine little women. There were many widows. Jesus said there were many widows. They didn't have someone helping them earn a living. And maybe they had more than a son. They may have had several children. But Jesus said, "But there was only one that Elijah was sent to." But none of them under none of them was Elias sent under Serpa, a city of Sidon, unto woman that was a widow. And many lepers, many lepers. &gt;&gt; I want you to see it as we draw to a close and make it very personal. Many lepers were on the streets crying, "Unclean, unclean, but maybe holding a little cup." Mercy, mercy, unclean, unclean. But can you help me? There were many, but only one was Elijah, &gt;&gt; the prophet, &gt;&gt; and none of them was cleansed. good people, &gt;&gt; nice people, praying people, &gt;&gt; believing people, &gt;&gt; what is it? It's a you cannot even begin to describe the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; Many were sitting at the pool of Bethesda and the prophet said waterhead babies and all kinds of people crippled who couldn't get up and whatever more and Jesus stepped over them and that was the compassion of almighty God. But don't ever think that you and I can figure God out. &gt;&gt; We You might as well say amen to that. You'll never understand God. &gt;&gt; Many people and one of the first things that comes to an individual when when the word comes and their mind becomes enlightened and the word becomes open an open book to them. One of the statements that I hear so often is, and you have said it, but why me? &gt;&gt; Why? Why me? These people are such nice people. Even the church I came from, I've got memories. Such wonderful people, excellent people, maybe better than myself or yourself. That has nothing to do with it. I don't know many very fine people and many wellestablished churches and millions of members and hundreds of thousands of ministers and perhaps more than all of you I could say. But why did God arrange that I'd sit on a log with the spirit of Elijah in a man and Elijah prophet &gt;&gt; who looked at me within a few inches of my eyes and just with that they were dull and yet penetrating and looked through my life to my earliest memory of myself said you have three questions and here's what they are. The first one which was least important, the next one which was more important and the last one which I thought was insoluble. He never started telling me what he believed or what he preached. Took immediately to the scripture &gt;&gt; and it's this that came alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; And while I had many other questions, I knew one thing that the spirit that was coming out of his mouth was the author of this book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Many young preachers at 27 was there in this country and many people Congo and the rest of you many were in your city you from the Pacific Northwest from Seattle to com wherever you're from many were in Poland many were in the UK &gt;&gt; many were in Germany many of you are scattered all over the earth. Many but to you was this Holy Spirit sent. Hallelujah. To you this grace came. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, maybe the first thing we heard from him was go and wash. We say, "Well, there's better things to do. I've heard better sermon than that." That's not the point. I tell you, when we have a thus sayith the Lord, all we do is say, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; Have you figured it out yet? No, I haven't figured it out yet. And I probably won't figure it out. I haven't got enough time to figure it out. I'm not going to waste my time trying to figure it out. I'm going to put all my focus on having my faith increased so I can believe it with all my heart. Keep me awake. Keep me alert. Keep me energized. Keep my heart filled with faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, it is love. The Savior's love. There's something within my soul today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it in your soul? &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, many good people, and they don't hear what you're hearing. Not because of me, because of God's grace to you. Many good people sat in church today. And I tell you what, I wouldn't have to have much revelation if I sat in a church and thought today this organization who I devote myself to and give my tithes and offerings to is part of a world council system. a world council of churches that's being swallowed up by this absolute fallacy. &gt;&gt; What is with this? &gt;&gt; What's all these gorgeous robes? &gt;&gt; Is that have anything to do with Christ? What's all this business of all these marble and all this glory and all this gold and all this sell it and give it to the poor? Do something. so ostentatious &gt;&gt; that it literally boggles the mind of the greatest and the wealthiest and the most powerful and whatever more and I'm just ending. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It saddened my heart to see America bow. &gt;&gt; Saddened my heart to be honest with you. I'm Canadian, but I'm Christian. &gt;&gt; If I didn't have to have a passport in my pocket, I wouldn't even own this country. You might be shocked to hear that, but I'm ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed of what it stands for. I'm ashamed of her same-sex marriages. I'm ashamed of her acceptance of all of this perversion. I'm ashamed of the weakness within the government. I'm ashamed that they don't stand for truth. I'm ashamed that you can't have a a gospel radio station. They call it a Christian nation. We don't have gospel radio stations in this so-called all we have is a a CBC uh Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with all their nonsense. &gt;&gt; Sorry, Brother Roger. I know you do a lot of work for them. Charge them double, would you, for me? &gt;&gt; Get everything you can out of Cain, his kingdom. use it for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, that's my message. [Applause] While the musicians come, one one last thing I want to leave with you in the message, feast of the trumpets. Brother Graham says the trumpets are to Israel. And I I just informed you of what Rabbi Richmond has sent and being called up and a declaration that the government has made on them. But he said, "Notice the trumpets that we're speaking of is a call together and that's called Israel." Now, here's what it's called for. Either a feast or for war or for a person or for a sacred day. And they haven't had the person revealed yet, &gt;&gt; but that's what they've been called for. And he said just a little further really pay attention now. He said when he spoke of those 200,000,000 demons that have been loosed that were bound by circumstances in the river Euphrates. They've been loosed. They've been loosed. They're loosed tonight, today, this morning. And he said the old Roman Empire being revived. Now friends, the first picture I showed you today, that first picture, do you recall it? Leaders and dignitaries standing at the feet of the the one who's the emblem or the symbol of all that that church stands for. standing there indeed with reverence I think about 170 nations represented if President Bush was here I'd love to tell him he did more to revive that nation that system than anything that's happened in modern history more to revive it to bring it to its its ultimate position They have never had such an acknowledgment. The the only superpower on earth. The one before it became a superpower. The single superpower. A prophet was walking here with that in him and that pillar of fire in attendance near him to speak through him and the spirit of Elijah within him and anointing him waiting to declare some of these things. And he was saying it many years before this event would unfold. But you believers of it are living to see it and have seen it and have experienced it. And I say, "Where are we? &gt;&gt; Where has that placed us?" And I would say I would say that Rome and the Vatican and that harlot church was elevated to a status she has not ever known &gt;&gt; in history this last week. &gt;&gt; And that's where we're at. I would say nations are breaking. Israel's awakening. And I believe while we have our liberty and so on, we ought to pray. Nobody's restraining you from coming to pray. No one's restraining you. But here are precious brother Rabbi Richmond. I'll call him Garen Solomon and all of those that associated with them. They can't go and pray where they would like to pray. All of these things happening right at this time. Oh, do you think things happen amongst leaders of the world by chance? [Music] Maybe maybe I won't be, you know, bringing you these things all that who knows how much longer. I don't even think it's an accident that the heir to the throne of England wed the woman who he's had an adulterous relationship with for years and that that is happening now. All the dignitaries are bowing before that caucus. all this pomp and hundreds of millions of dollars being spent. The leader of another nation, marrying a woman, he's had a his common lover even while he was married and raising children. And at the very same time, all these things are converging. Here is some fervent Jews being called before the security telling them, "You can't go up there." And furthermore, they declared they were going to go up there. A whole group of them said, "We're going to go up there. We're going to go up to the mount. We're going up several thousand strong." Do you know what Israel did? They responded with 3,000 policemen and said, "You will be stopped. You will not go up there." All happening in the same week. I say it's time that we have our eyes open and our understanding illuminated. God bless you as you stand. Nations are breaking. Israel's awakening. The signs that the prophets foretold [Music] the Gentile days with horrors and comfort. Eternity soon will us. The day our redemption is near our failing for fear. Be filled with the spirit. Your lamps trimmed and clear. Look out. Your redemption is near. The fig tree is growing. Israeling. Her national life throne. Today she is calling. Her lingers [Music] to your day of redemption is heart. Your redemption is near. The last verse, please. False prophets are lying. God's truth. They're denying that Jesus the Christ is our God. Through generations, first rehearsals have trust [Music] your redemption. Let's say the redemption is here. The day of redemption is here. Yes, man's heart. Oh, be filled with the spirit your look. Your redemption is &gt;&gt; I would say if there were my last words to this church, I would say don't be lax. Don't be in a relaxed mode about this message. This message is ahead of you. What the prophet has spoken is already ahead of you. He spoke of things maybe you're not experiencing yet. Whatever you do, keep in tune. &gt;&gt; Keep snugged up. Keep fervent. [Music] You know these words and all the earnestness in my voice has gone out. You'll hear it again someday. You'll hear it just the way it's been spoken. You'll hear it again. And if you don't take heed, God's going to require you to answer to what's been spoken. And you have to decide that's just a man or that's the devil or that's God. And what is in your heart will tell you what it is. You'll have a witness in your heart. Say, I know that's God. Then respond likewise. Respond in that same manner. I know that's God because it's touching my heart very, very deep. Amen. The day of redemption is here. It's now our faith for fear with the spirit in your lending and look up. Your redemption is here. Look up. Your redemption is here. &gt;&gt; Shake hands with somebody as we say it again. Look up. Your redemption is here. Oh, look up. Your redemption is here. God bless you. I'm going to ask Brother Tom while we're standing to come and dismiss us in prayer. Heavenly Father, we believe we've heard from the throne of God this morning. We can say our hearts did burn within us. It feels like we're in Bible times all over again. Lord, to see the spirit of God move by the word of God within our lives. Open our eyes, Lord, to see this glory that is amongst us. Lord, as the spirit of God was admonishing, if there be somebody here that has not moved into that channel to accepting Jesus Christ, Lord, would you move them like men of old were moved of the Holy Ghost. Would you move them, Lord, to know you in the power of your resurrection to know you as a living God, a God that is amongst his people again? We pray God that you will save the lost, redeem those, Lord, whose names have been written down. We pray God that you'll move us into deeper depths, higher objectives in the word of God. We pray go with your people now and bless your servant. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Hello. Hello. Heat. Heat. [Music]
