little announcements here we'll have prayer for the children next Sunday so everybody at school started I know this week but we'll have prayer with everyone we'll do that next Sunday if you have that keep that on your heart we'll also have family prayer meeting next Monday so not tomorrow but next Monday we'll have family prayer meeting as well you know I was pondering just prayer you know even as we always do that we just have prayer for the children and those going back to school and all of that you know I wonder if we could just have a peek if God would roll back the realm a little bit and and give us a a glimpse into the eternities as maybe as we would stand for prayer as we do each year and see really the impact of that as God starts dispatching his angels down he said okay now you take care of that one you watch over there and they start setting the order of Legions of the Angels would be coming down as they set an array as you go out to battle another year you don't say I was having prayer no we're saying Lord put a hedge about us amen we just don't do that as tradition but we're asking him to be with us each step of the way this year uh also going to have young peoples put that on your calendar for September 23rd and uh plan for as we best we can the third Friday of each month would be the uh the time that we like to do that but this so this will be September 23rd we'll have young peoples here I'll be at the uh we'll be holding that in the school recently so that'll be where that is uh indeed I bring greetings from Brother David Mayer and the assembly there we were able to spend some time with them we had a wonderful time together uh sees letter David he's like family he's pretty much like family here to the church so it's just really a little extension but they send their greetings to everybody here and say God bless you be with you and a little break there with them and we're back in the saddle boy the saddle was immediately hard the moment I got in it that's okay they have some really cushy Saddles out there if you've ever been in the cowboy store apparently some of us ride a bit more of a leather bound one it's okay I like to sing maybe before we turn to the word I just enjoyed this song I do want to sing believe for it and we can stand as we sing that we turn to the word this is a song that is a little anthem for me I love it they say this mountain Can't Be Moved no they say well that's what they say but my God says differently amen they say these chains as we sang will never break that's what they say but my God says something different why do we sing that together this morning as we turn to the word you help me out all right let them snow be special they say this mountain can be moved they say these chains [Music] but they don't know you like me [Music] we've heard that there is no way through we've heard the title will never change they have seen what you can new for there is [Music] [Music] with me [Music] no matter [Music] so much [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] been away [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen Heavenly Father this morning indeed as Believers of this Gospel of Jesus Christ Lord that next verse says you said it we believe it Lord that's our cry our heart this morning as Lord if we could just say to you we believe your word Lord Through the Ages Lord many have fallen away and Lord question this and questioned that but Lord we this morning I pray are a hundred percent group of Believers in this building that can say we believe we might not understand it all but we believe it all and Lord you said it so we believe it this morning Lord I pray you would take your word you'd break it Lord to the people Lord they would receive it as they have confessed it with their lips that you are the chain breaker you're the miracle maker Lord You're the deliverer as you were with Moses and the children of Israel put back the waves of the Red Sea this morning Lord whatever the need is I pray they would present it before you and just say Lord I believe this morning that you can meet my cry this very hour so we commit this service and all that is transpired and will Lord be said into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen he said it amen let's turn to our Bibles this morning Isaiah 50. thank you musicians I Was preparing in a bit of a different direction for most the weekend and I couldn't really shake to go to this thought she took it in Switzerland and I generally just once it's preached it's breached but uh Lord help me this morning maybe somebody is in need today Isaiah 50. verse 5. the Lord God hath opened mine ear and I was not rebellious neither turned away back man I'm so glad he's opened my ear oh man and I'm not rebellious I haven't turned around but I've ran to him I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I hid my fate hid not my faith from shame and spitting and prophesying of Jesus for the Lord God will help me therefore shall I not be confounded therefore have I set my face like a flint and I know that I shall not be ashamed he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me my I love this verse he is near that justifies me isn't that beautiful Amplified says he who declares me is right near Glory it says who will contend with me let us Stand Together who is mine adversary let him come near me again who will dare to contend with me is what another translation says let him let us stand up to each other who is my adversary let him approach me amen he knew who's by his side man when you have Lord Jesus standing near you say who's my adversary amen if God before us who can stand against us verse 9 behold the Lord God will help me who is he that shall condemn me Lo they shall wax old as a garment and the moth shall eat them up amen let's turn to Luke 9 51. sister Sheila I was looking for brother Peter this morning tell him I was had a hankering for his specials passed that message on for me verse 51 and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem amen he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and the Lord blessed the reading of his word you may have receipts this morning can I relax like already I know it's Sunday morning but that's what's worse Sunday morning I'm used to just good old-fashioned Wednesday amen well I'm gonna just take a little thought this morning uh face set Like Flint it's just been something that's been on my heart I've pondered it for a while now and I just pray that it would be a little blessing to you but face set Like Flint you know what we humans we're we're interesting we're we're uh we have a certain nature a certain drive inside of us that is is unique from the other species that are on the planet and uh you know they will sometimes go not sometimes many times will go beyond really the imaginable or what we should be doing for a certain level of gain you know we will strive you know and sometimes uh question really was it worth it per se but you know nature on a whole it it has a different um level of Drive per se they'll go to a certain limit you know if you've ever seen uh you watch bears like a man like a couple male bears as they're in maybe a season for a mating season of such and these men these male Bears they'll stand there with each other as they come against each other and they're you know they're they're combating for who is obviously the biggest and the greatest and and uh but they'll they'll they'll I won't do it because I'm no bear and then nor do I want to look like a fool up here but uh you know they have their big mouths and their snouts open real wide and they stand up on their two feet and they get pretty tall and especially like a Grizzly or something like that or a polar bear and and they'll have their gaping mouth open and they're kind of just roaring and I won't even imitate that because that would be way off the grid and and they're trying to scare the other one all right thank you brother Richard he knows these things and they're trying to prove that I've got I've got everything I need to beat you I've got it all and so he just starts to Roar and gnarl and and you know get real close and he bends his head a little bit like he's going to go in for the kill but he's just you know not quite there but he's showing that he's ready anybody ever seen that thank you yeah we've seen that in many different in nature and different animals because they're actually they're not willing to put their life on the line unless really really necessary nature does that they it's just not worth it you know there's few things that are worth it to them and showing that they're the biggest and and best is is really just right there and sometimes they will you know just someone tips over the edge and then it's game on but really other than that or maybe food and they're they're extremely uh they're gonna starve to death really a matter of life and death that's when Nature will put it all on the line that's when Nature puts it on the line and and then they'll you know as those two bears they really strap it out but humans were a little different we're just a tad different than that apparently we really don't have that threshold it's not life or death only but it can be really anything humans really put it put it on the line and go to extremes for really minimum really you don't know what I'm talking about you know many of you would know way back not too long ago there was this you know this whole series called Fear Factor who knows that that is don't even have to put your head up and they would do some Terrible Things they'd be willing to do terrible things for fifty thousand dollars he said well that's a lot of money but when they when you see what they were willing to do you say you're insane and all of nature would look at them and say you're insane and you're the top of the chain I don't know so you know people they're willing to even discuss things but if you actually go into one person they're willing to be trapped into a coffin buried in a coffin and then their partner who had to dig them out in a certain period of time really and your partner's not even a ditch digger not even a hole digger I mean it's one thing if they're power pole diggers but not so in this one case but this humans are willing to do the insane for such small gain you know I'll give you 20 bucks and all these challenges that go over the internet you know this challenge that challenge you know eat a spoonful of cinnamon and die pretty much don't do it for what you know for what what are people why are they doing it that's the human species and so they go they're willing to go to these limits really for the smallest amount whether it's for a little bit of money maybe a little popularity that's really what most of it's for right nowadays it's just so you get your picture you know with as many hits as you can and so they do the worst of things it's because they're convinced that it's worthwhile right they're convinced they're convinced that it's you know why not people will fall they'll look for a selfie and die because they felt that that was worth worth their time work to go to the edge you wouldn't believe how many people have died taking selfies it's a real deal go beyond the fence line just go beyond I just need to get the best picture and take a step back you don't think it happens it happens a lot it's terrible for the most minimal thing because apparently it's worth it I'm convinced that I need to do that and so that's what where humanity is and they assess that it's worth giving my all for something very very small and they've actually set their face like a flint they put their face towards something I said whatever it takes I'm going to do it because it's worth it you know in the scripture they use Flint Flint is super hard it's actually way up there on the scale of of hardness just under Diamond by a little bit a few few numbers on the scale and so in the scripture it's saying I've set my face like a flint just it was such a hardness with such a which was such a I got no quit in me I've got no stop I've said I'm so determined and that's what this the the line means I've set my face like a flint and so someone becomes so convinced they become so firmly believing in the truth of something and so therefore they they're willing to put it all in the line but brother Branham says you know he says God God of people ready he says better convinced in 10 days then we can get them in 10 years speaking of the upper room he says when our seminaries come out they're still not convinced because they've had tradition injected into them but when they waited on God for 10 days they certainly convinced them he says certainly convinced some of them at Pentecost couldn't even write their own name but they were convinced it was God Amen and so therefore their faces were set like a flint and man they were so convinced brother Brown says that he was all they needed amen they didn't need anything else and man he says we haven't come to this place yet he goes they were convinced they didn't need education they didn't you know Fellowship card they knew they were Abraham's seed and God is able to perform what he promised to do I'd say at that point at that moment when the Holy Spirit came down in the upper room they were all in after that they were immediately convinced this is God I don't need a question anymore I don't got a Wonder in my mind was this really him at that moment it was all in and their faces were set Like Flint on the word of God Amen and you need to be thoroughly convinced before you sell out to something if you're just a little halfway you ain't gonna you're not gonna give it all you say it's not really worth it it's just not worth me you know putting putting my everything into that if you don't actually really believe and are convinced that is true so I wonder how many Christians these days really actually aren't convinced because they haven't had an experience and so therefore the reason why their life is only half baked or a half-mast Christian Life is because they're not totally convinced that Christ is the only one they need but when you get so convinced like they did in the upper room that he is the only true God he's the one that can fill me and save me he's the one is my deliverer and he alone is who I'll serve when you are convinced like that your walk is an all-in walk and you will know it and so will those around you amen people go all in they're convinced that their sports team or their Sports drive or their desire for business their desire for fashion they believe in it and so they go all in and you can see it all over their life they'll do everything for it do everything they can to achieve the end they desire whatever they want to do but I pray this morning you're just checking your heart say Lord I'm gonna be all in today I want to fully convinced experience but around preach convinced and then concerned but you know I'm gonna there's another fella that's convinced in what he's doing and that's the Devil Himself he's convinced of what he's his objective and he is indeed willing willing to do whatever it takes to derail you so I'm telling you this morning the reason why you need to be all in the reason why you need to know that you and your God have a personal walk because your adversary the devil is all in in what he's trying to achieve he's not holding Zippo back against you so I would recommend you have a walk with God so that he can do whatever it takes amen Satan will go to the very edge the very extent the very maximum he isn't going to he's not a halfway person I'll tell you that just check out what he's done through time he isn't holding something back he's given everything he's got to try and upset God's plan and so as we would go and it very easy or or an ex account in the scripture that would would be very um familiar to you would be into job as Satan would have came and spoke to God I still always Marvel when I read that there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them can you imagine and the Lord said to Satan whence cometh thou my I just I I just try and visual visualize this this account and say an answer to the Lord and said well from going to and from for over in the earth and walking up and down so Satan's been walking around he's been looking around checking out all the different aspects of the earth and obviously job was high on the on the list because this is who comes up in the conversation and so Satan had been watching job Satan's watching you I've been going to and fro looking at God's people and job's caught his eye well you don't think Satan's walking to and fro and I sure hope you catch his eye you kind of want to I sure hope we're on his radar because if you're not you're obviously not he's all you're obviously not a problem to him may we be on his radar maybe get up in the morning and Satan's like oh dear they're back up again I got to deal with these ones again they're on my radar let's fill his radar with with our walk with God Amen so the Lord said to Satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him on Earth perfect upright one that fear God and Satan said to the lord well yeah does job fear God for not have to put a hedge about him and about his house but all he has on every side that was bless the work of his hands and his substances increased in the land of course you've done everything you can for job and he's been blessed and his hand his work he's prosperous and his substances increase but I tell you if you take your hand from him and you just step back a little bit and touch all that he hath he'll curse you to your face and imagine the challenge that the devil is giving to God imagine that like he doesn't know that God doesn't know all things he does know all things and here's Satan's saying yeah but if you do this he's going to curse you and the Lord said behold all that he hath is in thine power only upon himself put not forth that hand and so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord can you imagine Satan saying I've got this now just you watch just you wait everything is now in my control you know what I what I love about this better brand says now notice oh he says oh I love this God knowing the heart job had only one way that's through Fellowship through the shedding of the blood he had talked to God he knowed that he was God had confidence in job because he had fellowship with job can you imagine Satan's saying he's going to curse you to your face and God is sitting back there saying do what you feel I'll give you all the range you need up into his life because God knew I've actually had fellowship with job me and job we've had some communion together well I just was just with him actually just recently this is in God's mind and Satan doesn't know and he's like I just had fellowship with job and he just was talking to me about his his struggles and and his desires he was just telling me how much he loved me and and I was speaking back to him and telling him I love you too job you keep my Commandments and you're holding fast to my word I just want to bless you and he's he communed with him he had fellowship with job and so God knew Sorry Devil I've had fellowship with job I know his walk I know his desires I know his struggles I know it all because he's talking to me he's fellowshipping with me and because of that I have full confidence full confidence in his walk so do what you want I'll give you all the bandwidth you need but I know job came to this Revelation but God already knew job ain't gonna curse me for nothing amen oh he says oh god brother Brandon says may the Branham Tabernacle can have confidence in you it's not because you do something not because you do something amazing or with your faith or do something but when you have Fellowship Fellowship how important is fellowship fellowship with him oh what blessed sweet communion Jesus is a friend of mine that's the most important can you imagine if job didn't have fellowship and there was no confidence it would be a totally different story but job had conf guarded confidence in job because of a walk with God amen so Satan he says wonderful so he got to work Satan didn't take any time he didn't he didn't he didn't need a whole lot of time to figure out what to do so here he comes and the messenger came to job and oxen replying as the scripture says and they were feeding and the sabians fell upon them and took them all away this is what the messenger is saying to job messenger number one and here he comes he's speaking now to Job saying oh my goodness I was plowing with the auction and the asses were feeding beside them and the sabians fell upon him and took them all away and they've slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I'm the only one I alone am the only one to tell you you know who's read this recently nobody well all right you know what the next verse says it says while he was yet speaking while he was yet speaking and I've always been amazed at this because job is sitting there maybe at the the doorway of his tent and he's sitting maybe on his little on a little chair something that or a stool and you know it was just another normal day just woke up you know everything's you know day by day the Lord has blessed him all is wonderful but something changed he didn't know but something changed everything that Satan could do was now getting poured out on job he just woke up in the morning you wake up in the morning like my goodness what's going wrong well it could be a job moment job God and the devil had a conversation and God says do what you need to do because I'm going to prove to you I have confidence in them and this was the morning that job had he was just sitting and suddenly everything was going wrong and so here he's now trying to take in oh my goodness all my oxen and all my asses they're all gone the sabians but they haven't come and they haven't come to hurt us or or to fight with us so am I you know he's just trying to deal with that and the last words are coming out of the servant's mouth and so he would have been saying and I only and suddenly another servant comes running up and he's trying to get out what you know the first one out of his mouth and the other one comes and says oh job job the fire of God has fallen from heaven and have burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I only am escaped and he is also saying I only as the other one and another servant is barging into the into his tent area there and he says oh job job I don't know what these two are here for but I got some important news he says oh the Chaldeans have made out three bands and fell upon your camels and carried them away and I'm and slain the servants by the edge of the sword and I only am escaped I don't know what your problem is but mine's incredible job is trying to take it all in uh sabians camels oxen all my servants and while he's yet speaking he thought his news was important the next servant came in and said oh you I don't know what their your issues looks like there's a gathering here but I got some important news job your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and behold a great wind came right from out of nowhere just blew through the from the Wilderness and smote the corners of the home and all the young men and they're dead and I only am escaped one two three four and Joe's swimming what is going on it's because Satan was doing everything he could everything God didn't say yeah you can do anything you want up and to his life and Satan's like wow okay I'll uh I'll just go halfway I'll just take care of his camels or maybe just his oxen no no no Satan said all right and went all the way to the very weight and delay it it was just like bang bang bang take that this is how Satan was working and job Rose rent his mantle shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped Glory God we are jobs we are the same caliber as job I'd say because we're of that we're children of God and in those moments if you have fellowship with God there's not it's not job had a different type of Fellowship you have fellowship with God God will have confidence in you because you are communing with him and whether or not the devil is is doing halfway or all the way God has full confidence in your response and our response may it be oh God I worship you you're the king of glory what did he say he says and he said naked came I out of my mother's womb naked I return God is given God taken away blessed be the name of the Lord that can only come out of a relationship with God you can't have that response you cannot have what that man took and be like well blessed be the name of the Lord no no that came because there was a walk with God it came I can tell you it was probably I would believe it just came out of a just a burst from job she emotionally completely wrecked really wrecked how do you process all that but something inside job because he had Fellowship because he had a personal walk with almighty God something inside of him just started to well up oh God I don't know what's going on on my tip but something is well up he said oh naked came I naked I go blessed be the name of the Lord and in all this job sinned not amen nor charge God foolishly can you imagine the devil you know how upset he must have been I said come on keep everything I got still still seriously you know why you know why because God just drew a line he says all right devil you can go to there and so the devil was immediately there immediately if you read your scripture he was there he didn't delay he didn't take time and saw under his way to the line no he was immediately at the line but you know what he couldn't take one big toenail across the line he can't take a move across where God has placed him you say oh what am I going through God knows what you're going through he knows exactly what you can handle scripture states that and he'll never allow the enemy to go past it even a millimeter [Applause] this might be your Breaking Point here and God sets the line because he knows he says uh-uh Sorry Devil I just tried his fellowship with them I just had a Sweet Hour of Prayer with that sister so here you go go to there but you can't go any further amen that should put confidence in your God because he's got your back he knows exactly what you can handle so he says all right Dev I'll give you all you need except past the line foreign you know what's beautiful it's never the devil's best is never enough the devil's best actually enough you must have the most wickedest complex the I'm not good enough complex the devil has that one so if he tries to throw that on you it's because he has it himself so don't take his problem he is just not good enough God placed that one there everything he does I mean good grief he should have set back from Job and said well why do I even try but he still does just builds back up on his complex I'm sure he's fired more demons from the job they said really you couldn't do it no they just they just withstood me you're fired next one well I couldn't get them to go there I attempted him I tempted him but they just wouldn't go you're fired he'd fired so many because he cannot make it happen because he can only go so far it's not good enough second Corinthians it says and it's been spoke on and loved the scripture but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled but the Murphy spoke on this so incredibly on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair or persecuted but not forsaken we're cast down but not destroyed amen why because he just can't get all the way it's never good enough to take his son or daughter of God and take them into the wretchedness God will hold him back to your limit why can you be troubled you're going to be troubled job was troubled are you going to be destroyed are you going to be perplexed oh God why is this happening I don't understand it can you have perplexing times oh yeah you can are you going to be persecuted mm-hmm he was persecuted he bore Stripes he bore scorn he bore shame will you yes you can cast down maybe you're going to feel like you're just completely down barely feeling you can get up the next day so distraught but the scripture says yet not distressed but not despair but not forsaken but not destroyed he's gonna push against the lying put you against the line you're cast down now you're perplexed you're troubled but yes but I'm not destroyed I'm not in despair because he's got me in his hand i'm communion with my God I'm like job I have fellowship with my Jesus amen Satan another time in Scripture tried to put all the fury of hell unto one man and here was a man named Legion how it started I don't know but Satan started to lay it on again he ain't gonna hold it back everything he's gonna do everything that he can do and he started to lay it on him and Demon after demon started to wrap a legion and if I visualized it as I did in Switzerland I was just visualizing what Legion would have looked like in that Supernatural realm we'd have seen a man tearing at himself and chains and all that but in a different place if you can imagine chain after chain it would have been placed on him demon after demon started to just wrap around him as as the devil just started throwing it and started to wrap and bind him with chains of darkness and so bit by bit all you would see after the wild devil say I got some more another demon here another demon there another issue there he doesn't start to wrap him and all you would have seen is this huge rap ball of Gene and somewhere somewhere in there was Legion and the devil was saying you're going to be my example I've thrown everything I can and nothing nothing will deliver him impossible and Satan thought that he had finally been good enough to defeat God and here Legion was now amongst the tombs hurting himself all of these things breaking things men couldn't contain him and he was he was Satan's you know model that's what I can do he could point to all of his demons see what I can do that's my best that's my best [Music] you know your Bible but just one day just one day a little man stepped out of a boat stepped out of a boat he'd just gone through a storm he just calmed it and he steps on the shore and Satan is like huh that was the best I got what happened he came running up and fell down at the feet of Jesus and started to worship [Music] Satan's what's going on everything that I've done my best is what's what's happening it it was all falling apart and right there in just a matter of a few words and a short span of time Jesus said what do you say I just said a couple little words he said lose him the demons he told the flea he decided a couple little words a couple little words and the brain's chain started to break one by one if you could let step back in that realm chain after chain started to break up the noise of it would have been deafening as everything started to fall apart and the power that the devil thought he had the best that he could do started to break apart at the spoken word of almighty God all that God had to do was just speak and loose him from the power of the enemy and the chain started to break away and everything sort of fall away and there was Legion in his right mind because God spoke you might have you might say well I'm in big I have some problems my son is in Chains my daughter's in Chains I've got an issue but at the word of God if it can take a legion if it can take Legion who is Satan's picture of what he can do it was never and will never be good enough never good enough for the word of God God will speak with her across this Pulpit or across some other Pulpit or when you're reading your Bible in the morning and the word of God just speaks to you that alone is enough to break every bit that the devil can do thank you amen Satan's Fury is never good enough I'm never good enough he will Bluff you he'll Bluff you to try and tell you it's good enough but God has armed you with enough in here to show you that it's never good enough and that's why he's got a bad bad day every day because he's got to live with the complex that I'm never good enough give it to him feed his complex every day you know Satan does his best and gives it all every bit of it so convinced he sets his face like Flint before you so does God 's going to do his and everything God ain't Hold nothing back either if Satan's given it all so is our Lord amen brother Brown says he was so concerned that he came from heaven give up heaven came down here on Earth and became born in a manure stable wait this is God's best think about it Satan his best is a whole different story wait God's giving his best here in a manure's table of bleeding cattle not even with clothes not a place to lay his head not a tomb to be buried smitten stricken the way he was he was concerned enough and God so loved the world till he give his only begotten son a man love constrained him amen God by his Sovereign Grace for ordained spoke your word your life into existence before the world was ever formed and by his infinite mind knowed you'd be in the Final End he says then Grace constrained him love constrained him to project Sovereign Grace to the Earth to make a provision to save you if he's seen you desired to be saved he's seen you desired to be saved so then therefore love constrained him to through his love his great attributes would not permit him to do nothing else amen he says to make a way of Escape he must do it Glory he must do it and so God had to then say I'm going to give my everything he gave everything what he gave was himself amen he didn't hold anything back he didn't send an angel he didn't send some other somebody in his place he couldn't and he knew that and so love constrained him he said I must give it all I must set my face like flint and give my everything I'm going to give them my everything and so the scripture said he said his face steadfastly because you could say well I'm just going to give it all all right that's easier said than done that can be easier said than done and Jesus as we open in scripture in Luke said his face steadfastly and here we go through those moments of time the Jews were looking for a king they were looking for someone to overthrow Rome they were looking for the Messiah to come and Reign and get rid of this domination and set up a kingdom and here they saw that the Messiah some were seeing all the Miracles and wonders said surely this could be the one he's going to set up his kingdom here he's going to overthrow Rome some thought this this wasn't the case but there was a pressure there that was bubbling through you can imagine there was a zealots in all of this that was happening at the time oh there was wonderful things Hosanna Hosanna you know the Palms are waving but it wasn't his purpose it wasn't his purpose to overthrow an Earthly Realm and he set his face to the cross I said there sperden said there had been hundreds of thousands of cases in which men's characters appeared to be opening like a rose oh things were they were their character was was blooming but he says that the worm of wealth was gnawing at the root and air Rose could fully expand and if the flood and flood the air with his perfume and so he's speaking here how many people have gone through time and it looks like they they were on the right course and their characters blooming but because something was was said or or wealth or popularity or something it detracted them off the pathway and there the perfume could emit from their life and here is Jesus was oh that you can imagine there would have been a lot of people and it was a very a time and but God set his eyes on the cross it didn't matter I'm not setting my kingdom up here I'm not I'm not looking to that I've got a different purpose and so he kept his eyes steadfastly like a flint he says I Gotta Give It All and Satan came down and says you want Power you want power just worship me a little it's not that hard just worship me and it's all the kingdom of the Earth is Yours but his purpose was too strong oh devil my compassion for my peoples too intense to yield to the tempter I was I'm not going to voluntarily I didn't leave the throne room of glory and the royalties of heaven and strip myself of all this just to take it in a different way I must go to the Cross amen he couldn't be bribed of his purpose no no no sir he said his face like Flint on the cross this is the process of giving everything friends even tried to persuade them Matthew from that time for Jesus began to show his disciples how he must go into Jerusalem suffer many things and be killed and be raised again on the third day Jesus told his disciples this in Matthew 16 and Peter took him and says oh and began to rebuke him imagine this Peter rebuking God rebuking the Lord Jesus right to his face saying be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee it's not happening you're not going to die you're not you're not going to go through all this the sun is not and I know Peter's heart was was uh pure I'm sure but the response as we all know he turned and said get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me how many how many in the form of maybe a loved one even Peter was pretty close to Jesus Peter was pretty close to Jesus and you have someone that is really dear to you start to tell you something maybe inside you know I have a direction I must go but a loved one starts to say no no that's not the right way to go and deter somebody from really the path they should take beware his face was set steadfast on the will of God you make sure you know the will of God for your life not someone else's idea of what it should be no no no Lord be it far from you you'll never go there he says Get Behind Me Satan foreign maybe it comes down where it's just you and you alone and you and God you know God's path for you and God said well step aside I have my eyes set on the purpose I came for and Day by Day scripture by scripture he set his eyes steadfastly on the cross can you imagine you know as humans hear God is coming to die for you and me and all of the different things that people blasphemer be able to Bob and all of these things and here he's coming to die for them you know if you're here to do if you're doing something for somebody and they're just tearing 10 strips off you every day you're like forget that why am I going to do that for you careful now you live in human flesh but that's not Christ they tore strips off of him but he says it's for them I've come he didn't let any of that get his eyes off of what he came to do yeah but these were all small trials really that's when he started to come to the Garden of Gethsemane and the drops of sweat like blood started to pour from his brow even as he would go to prayer and Peter and the disciples were praying he says you know would you pray with me a little while and they couldn't even do that and he's all three times would you just pray for me a little while and they fall asleep and even his closest ones couldn't even spend a little bit of time as he agonized over what he must do sometimes what you must do it's agonizing it's agonizing all right you you know and he says oh God if this cup could pass from me but not my will and he agonized in the garden like I said doing everything it took easier said than done this isn't an easy walk Saints it's not an easy walk it wasn't an easy walk for our lord Jesus but he was showing us What It Takes he says I'm doing it for you Abraham and he set his face to the cross and felt the sorrow but he says I am resolved to achieve the Redemption of my people then came the agony the shame the whipping and God hung on the cross and then nailed him to the tree and all the Devils of Hell could jibe at him from all the parts of the earth that are mocking and jeering and who is this and he cried there on the cross my God Maybe in those moments he said I can't do it I don't have what it takes no you know the Romans they thought as they took the nail in his hand started to slam the nail down they thought that was what hung him on the cross they said that'll hold him there as they crucified your lord but it wasn't nails it was his love for me that nailed him to the train oh and bore the agony for all my sin amen he said no no I'm willing to do everything I'm gonna go all the way nail Me to the Cross with my back put the crown of thorns on my head scorn me mock me put me to shame do whatever you can give me everything you got devil give me it all and it's not gonna be enough It's never enough I'm the king of glory I'm going to give my all my everything and that is what it will take because I'm here to redeem my children amen he says I'm going to complete salvation's plan and bring Fallen man back to fellowship with me hey man I'm so glad he did everything ever he didn't hold back just a little bit and say well man I just I just cannot do it he did it he did it for you he did it for me and therefore therefore we must do it for him and so I'm challenging you this morning he did everything he had to do to save you and I everything the devil could throw at him wasn't enough to buy back your soul so now Lord Jesus I'm giving you my everything God's people will do whatever it takes because we're part of him we're part of him Saints if he had it in him to go every bit of the distance he's going all the way if you're part of him you've got what it takes to go the distance every bit of the way amen Philippians 3 says not as though I have already attained Ida was already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I am also apprehended for Christ Jesus Brethren I count on myself to have apprehended but this thing I do forgetting those things which are behind from this day today what happened last night at 11 59 PM I don't care I don't care and neither should you care this day this moment forgetting those things which are behind me I'm reaching part I'm going right ahead of me to those things which are before me I press toward I said my face as a flint on the prize amen of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen set your face I don't care what's going on leave it behind if you take this scripture every day everything's behind you all the time day by day it's behind you always looking forward don't live in rear view mirrors don't place the rear view mirror and you're going forward in light but really you're just looking at your rear view everything's behind you all the time you're living your day in the rear view forget it Paul said press forward forget the behind you and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me save the Holy Ghost witness Us in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me amen none of these things move me I don't know what I got ahead of me they're saying I have bonds and afflictions and they'll do abide me whatever they don't move me neither count I life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy amen amen let Paul we're going to give it all Esther had to do such she was in a position where she had to really actually count it all out and she came to a point where it was uh life or death was it not Haman had laid out his plan Mordecai urges her to to do what she needs to do and he says Hey Esther if you don't do this you think you're not going to make you don't think you're going to get scot-free so here she now has to Botha must approach the king or his death to all of her people and so the 13th of a Dar was the day that was set and it could have been a day of mourning and sorrow Esther she had to pondered out she fasted she said is this you know you got to put yourself in Esther's shoes she was going to open the door and she didn't know whether she was going to be the last moments of her life or their life would continue on and so she had to go through that crushing in her mind and her spirit what must I do and she fasted and she fasted but she was willing to do everything for her people and she came out of those days of fasting and I love the words and I love brother Benny Gandy who sings it if I perish I perish but I'm going before the king amen she was willing to do everything it took she put it all behind her she says whatever I'm gonna lay it all down on the line I pray that that's where you can get this morning whatever it takes I don't really care maybe you've had to have some days maybe you have to have a few days of fasting but may it not be too long where you can say no I'm gonna be like Esther I might not have come before the king for a very long time because it had been a span of time you might have a very cold walk with God right now you haven't been before the king you have She haven't really prayed is I got to go before what is God even gonna do to me how's he going to receive my prayer you say it don't matter Lord I'm coming to you and she came into that throne room not knowing and that scepter was said put down to Esther oh my what a relief that would have been but she was in it she was past wondering but that scepter came out and says oh I asked her if but to have my kingdom yeah you just go to prayer I don't care how long it's been get into prayer say Lord I I've been delinquent I I need a closer walk with you I'm willing to lay it down right now everything's behind me I'm just going to give it all I can tell you he's not gonna be like off with her head no he's gonna extend the scepter of Love out to you and say welcome home my child I've been waiting for you to come back home I sent a word that would grip your heart so that you can lay it down and so that from this day forward you can give everything you got you know that Esther went to the throne room again after that did you know that good you know she went back and went through that same process she had to have the scepter put out towards her again a few chapters later you know she didn't have fasting before that she knew who she was she didn't go back in a fast my goodness is he going to extend the scepter to OK me and him do I got to go through this whole process over again no no no she had reconnected with her King she had come in communion with her King and then she came back and that thrown in the second time she just walked in with boldness doors wide open the king is like oh oh Esther hey there's my scepter welcome into my Throne there was nothing she knew who she was she was the queen of Persia she is the Queen of Heaven you don't need to walk in oh is God gonna is he gonna hear my prayer you are the queen of Glory stand and walk in boldness why because you have the blood of Jesus that you can enter in with amen you don't need to walk in with fear and trepidation but I can tell you before that you need fellowship with Jesus amen wow it's that time you know the seraphenician woman we know the story so much there's so many accounts we could go through Jacob as you wrestle with the angel did everything he needed to do he was holding on he was holding on all night long so I ain't going nowhere let me go ain't going nowhere until you bless me we know these things seraphenician woman know it's always something I I'm just so the determination that she had to reach the need she had to reach Christ to meet her need and she went through there and she she come up but around and says cutting her way through days of Miracles are passed laugh at you your husband's Gonna Leave You Gonna put you out of the church what more call to Holy rule or what more he said she was perseverant she comes on now and meets up with Jesus and says oh now I got it I'm in his presence oh I've made it he I'm just I'm just right right with him now and here he says and notice she met up with him and met another disappointment he says yeah he said I'm not sent to your race oh the very God that she was respecting and what she give up her church and everything she had she'd give it it all somebody Brown he said she'd give up everything she had she had a daughter had epilepsy she was trying to get to Jesus because she knowed he had healed others oh why couldn't he heal her daughter so after she had left her everything she had and got to him and then this disappointment says I'm not sent to your race I'm only sent to the children of Israel can you imagine can you imagine the moment there she is at the feet of she just whatever she had to do together everything brother Branham said she left it all behind the scorn of the people her husband leave her who knows what it is that all went down she just knew I have to get to Christ he is the answer to my son's my daughter's problem my child's problem and she just gave it all and here she is and he says I'm not sent to you I'm sent to Israel and he just ignores her I tell you what would you do foreign says you know what that don't stop her faith oh that's how you know she was a child of God something inside her says she's going to press through her face was set Like Flint no no he's the one I need she was willing to Humble herself to the lowest of the lowest of the lowest that is where we have to go you got to get Pride out the door you got to get everything behind you wow what did the preacher say about me tell you you what no no no no no no he called her if you want to go forward a dog that is the lowest in Jewish a dog it's it's the way down there at the depths of the bottom right he says oh no she pressed right on again she addressed him as son of David he wasn't a son of David to her but when she said Lord that was different she come in the right way oh Lord have mercy Lord you owe me this Lord you owe me that no no no Lord have mercy on me sometimes all times we need to base ourselves to the word of God not what our thoughts think about it not what our idea is well who does he think he is to tell me that no no no no if she had said that she would have walked away and had an epileptic daughter still I said what happened but she respected and based herself to the word of God and said you know what she said he said another thing he says you're nothing but a bunch of dogs I'm not sent to you look what that poor little woman had done and the things she went through everything she had to press to get to him and then when she got to him he said I'm not sent to your race and you're nothing but a bunch of dogs Oh my he said but she was persevering why she had faith she said yes Lord yes she agreed of course she had to agree he was the word and the word is always right the word is truth no matter what she said yes Lord I'm a dog whatever you say I'm there but even the dogs they just get that little crumb just a little bit from the master's table that's all I need I I am whatever you say the word is true I am I am I am a lie the word's true but I'll take just a little crumb I'll just take that little bed that's all I need and oh God honored the faith this is oh my goodness how could he turn away from that and her daughter was healed from that day amen that's the level that we need to be to press through all of it how how low we must go how whatever the word says we put ourselves in subjection to and say hey Lord whatever you say if I can't even imagine in that moment there as he says that you're just like a bunch of dogs to me oh that's humility yes but Lord I just need to grow I just need a little crumb she wasn't a hybrid she had Thoroughbred strength and Grit as did the thief on the cross you know he did everything it took in that moment here he was for whichever reasons God gave him that time and his eyes opened I actually recognize who was there and here he was on a cross at what state I don't know almost dead almost moments away minutes away I don't know where he was and here he is hanging there trying to keep get his breath very difficult to get your breath as you're on a cross crucified that's the whole point is to basically suffocate they die without as they sag and they can't hold themselves up it's terrible and here he was at the worst time that you could imagine and it would pick everything in him to try and get a little bit out and you might feel that someone might be spiritually just almost at the limit right at the very end you feel I'm almost I'm almost lost I I just feel like there's there's no more I can't go another day if God doesn't doesn't all hail me or God doesn't mean me he was there on a cross and God opened his eyes in that moment and he did everything that he had it wasn't he goodness one thing he did a lot all that mattered was some breath but it was everything he could do to get it and he pushed himself up and he said oh remember me that's all he had to say that's all you need to say everything that you would need to do is oh God remember me that's all he needed to say he says today you'll be with me in Paradise it took everything he gave it all at the right moment at the right moment amen why why do these ones in the scripture have the ability to do that why because inside them inside them got deposited a seed because again if God went all the way and achieved what he needed to achieve and gave everything he had he's placed it inside of you and I the ability the drive the determination the ability to set our faces Like Flint and go all the way amen it's because it's a seed that has power inside to do whatever is required to reach the Final Destination as we've said in different times the little blade of grass that could come up and burst forth past all the concrete and all that would lay on top of it and that little blade seeks why because it's looking for light and it's it's the water the words brother Brown speaks about he says you can't hide life amen You Can't Hide life if it's inside of you it's gonna burst forth amen the scripture says and in second First Kings it talks about the uh Elijah that was just all he was wrestling after caramel and all these great you know this great victories and he's like I only am left you know the scripture I'm only they seek my life but you know what Jesus you know what God said he says I have left me seven thousand in Israel all the needs which would not would not have bowed to Baal and every mouth which not have kissed him and in Romans it said Paul is speaking and he says oh but what saith the answer of God to him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee I can tell you in that time it was an easy time to live they were hunted and they were found out and here they were living in caves and they were they were they were all hidden and such and even Elijah didn't even know all about them but they were there they were there God said I reserved them why because he placed something inside of them to not cut do not bow to not kiss the image of the god of that day you know what the god of that day was it was a sensual God bail you tell me what the God of this day is you tell me what the God of this day is God is placed inside of you he reserved seven thousand in that day he's reserved a people that will be hidden in the cleft of a rock that is going to come again came against the the gods of this wicked day and they will not kiss the image they'll not bow to the image because inside of them God has placed a little God Particle he says it's impossible for you to Bow it's impossible for you to kiss the image because inside of you is the same thing that was at the user Phoenician woman that's going to go everything she's got in the same thing in you that was in Naaman that said oh do I got to go all the way yeah he did all the way seven times he had to go you're willing to go every inch of the land happy amen you're God's Elite you're God's Elite I'm going to close musicians can make your way you know there's a we all know the elite armies of the day and we have these different play battalions or whatever groups that are the mightiest the SAS and all these things they're the elite of the world the elite Warriors of the world you know so these the Navy Seals they're one of these top Elites and they go through what's called hell week forward they're training hell week I wonder if we're in what would we consider this age When Death Rides that fourth seal and here we are they train super incredibly to try and get through 200 miles and they they run 200 miles in just one week they sleep for four hours 20 hours of physical training but you know whatever they all go through to get there one thing defines everybody that goes through the training and they have what they they have that hangs in the main Square of the main training area or the Gathering area it's a big Bell and it hangs there it's a big Bell and it sits in front of everybody and if you want to quit you have to go to the Bell you have to ring it three times Bang Bang and you place your hat training army hat on the ground and you walk off and you've quit and as the training goes hat upon hat gets added the Bell continues to get wrong and up to 80 plus percent ring the bell but one fellow said the one thing that defines everybody that goes through sealed training is that they didn't ring the bell they didn't quit it was it wasn't it so while it was important to be physically fit and all the training that you have to go through you find out though quickly says your background your social status your race none of this matters the only thing that matters is that you go in with purpose in mind and this that you are just not going to quit no matter what happens you know and there they are these are natural Elites that have something inside of them to willing to go all the way they just have they've something is there it's their makeup is a little bit different willing to go no matter what now how difficult and it's difficult to where they're dragging their carcasses somehow or their buddy is dragging them somehow just so they can get across the line for the day it's grueling it's difficult but something inside of them it just won't allow them to drag themselves up as much as somehow the battle in the mind just go ring the bell no I can't remember just go ring the bell if you just put your hat down there it's all over the pain is gone the agony it disappears you can be free of this wretched hell week and just go home ever had that mind battle just throw in the towel you can't do this no longer you think you've got another day left you can't do it but something inside you something inside of you because you're God's Elite in this day and age and there's some God Particle inside that just drives you on I just can't ring that Bell it's impossible for me to throw in the towel why because you're Gods he has dropped inside of you a seed that is going to grow and manifest in this day exactly what God wants say oh God I don't know how I'm going to get through it well Humanity goes through some crazy things people have dragged themselves through Wicked situations broken bone situations for miles and miles the human the natural being has something inside some people one fella fell 75 feet shattered his hip his femur and dragged himself for for eight miles through Creeks through streams just to get to a little home to get shattered body I don't even know how he did it something inside this guy he had a determination he had whatever you want to call it Inner Strength inner grit inner determination I don't care he had it that's natural there is something inside a Believer I don't know what you want to call it but I call it God I call it a seed of God that is planted inside of you that your face is set Like Flint and you say I don't care whatever it takes I'm gonna go and see my king amen amen they say well these different ones they say they shouldn't be alive well spiritually maybe some of you think well I just shouldn't be alive spiritually but you are you are you're here you're still fighting because God placed it in you it's not I that runeth but him may I say you know they have a Seal Team Six you know that they're the special ones we have Seal Team indeed may I say Seal Team seven that will overthrow this wicked generation amen I pray today we got fathers I pray we get mommies we get children I don't care teenagers I don't care who it is we need a resolve inside that we would set our face as a flint on the word of God no matter what goes on in this day and age do not lose your vision of Jesus hey man and you say Lord this morning I'm willing I'm willing you did it for me I'm willing to do whatever it takes I don't know what that looks like you know what that looks like I don't know the battle you go through I don't know where you're at in your life he called me you sit in church some have been here many many years some just recently I don't know but whatever you do I say don't leave the service this morning until you have resolved in your heart you have gone through those those moments of fasting in prayer that Esther did and she says I'm willing I'm going whether it's death or whether it's life I'm doing it all and may you come to this point and I wonder if we actually want him as much as he wonders us he was willing to do it all I said Lord may I show in my life every aspect of it that I'm willing to do whatever it takes the song that I pondered many that I that I love if someone writer wrote it down it says there's a voice calling me from an old rugged tree and it Whispers draw closer to me I said Jesus it's calling this morning and he's whispering to each one of you this morning I pray you could just take a moment and actually just quieten yourself and say Lord because he whispers in a still small voice and the songwriter penned down at Whispers to me leave this world far behind there are new heights to climb he's willing he's Desiring he wants to take you further deeper in him but he's saying I'm whispering to you but are you willing to do what it takes the verse is say take my houses and land change my dreams and all my plans you know I've had that happen to me my dreams and my plans really got changed because it's my desire to do whatever it takes for placing my life in your hands the disappointments come lonely days without the Sun and through sorrow more like you I become I'd like to sing that this morning more like a prayer as we would maybe just personally just bring ourselves right into just our own little room because maybe Esther did as she pondered and I'd like you to ponder this morning said Lord am I doing and am I willing do whatever it takes this morning foreign [Music] this morning [Music] if that's where you are this morning I know this is Sunday morning I'm not a Sunday morning Preacher I'm just preaching

just want to do the will of almighty God in our lives Lord and whatever you acquire of us Lord no matter what the situation if it's a Seer Phoenician who is seemingly Lord ignored but Lord willing to

fervent Wars of the Kingdom Lord I pray are resolve Lord as we go through these times these days ahead of us Lord it just gets Wicked her and wicker but Lord we have indeed set our face Lord to do whatever it takes Lord we have resolved no longer to linger and Lord what a what a strength it is to see different ones Lord in our congregation that have been doing that over the years Lord and Lord we can look at them as young people and younger families we can look to different ones that are in the congregation that have indeed set their face like Flint Lord and we can be strengthened by their walk with God but Lord May the younger Generations Lord that raise up thee our children Lord can see this and or not get caught up in the times in the age but they also would have the same resolve the same desire the same passion for the kingdom of God I pray Lord may you drop in nearly Heart Lord that they could have a communion and fellowship like job did with you so that Lord no matter what comes no matter what difficulty no matter what circumstance our faith Lord is in you not in the circumstances around us but we believe in the god that Lord can carry us through the waves and the difficulties of life we pray so Lord may we may we just end this little service Lord just may be in a bit more of a pondering atmosphere as Lord we each one would say Lord I'm willing I'm willing to

Mondays and in one of the lines there was one of the brothers different ones were going out into the different areas of Uganda I believe it was foreign [Music] they're going into the areas where people eat people I thought why that's somebody that's doing whatever it takes these are our brothers and sisters that are carrying this gospel because they have a drive inside of them to get the word out no matter what I pray this morning we could sit in nice cushy building cushion chairs somebody is out there holding the word of God taking maybe one little message book that he has and he's preaching the message of the hour a cannibalistic area of the world he said that shouldn't even exist it still does I said Lord this morning if we can go out burdened to do whatever we need to do in our area to project the gospel or if it's just in your own walk whatever you got to do it break my will God break my desires whatever it takes like you said it's easier said than done Saints but may you come to that point say Lord I don't care [Music] your will is all that matters to me [Music] do we know the song about Orion for one Earthly reason [Music] they're saying this just as we were just as I was coming earlier today as we close I just may be single we'll just have this on our hearts the song the course I was the reason as we said he did everything I was the guilty he was a sacrifice I was a taker I was a lot of takers in this world he's The Giver dying while I go free but that one or three reason it's me oh it became so personal this morning he said oh God you did it all just for me surely I can lay it down for you I know maybe you don't even know this song but you can just sing it with me do we know the verses but Ryan you can say it with me I know a little bit [Music]

was me amen I want you to leave that song in your hearts in your mind Lord I was the reason not to bring condemnation but to actually you can walk out of here [Music] feeling the impact of his love for you because that's what it is because he loved you so it constrained him to come from Glory Because of You Heavenly Father [Music] the Lord I sat there in my little chair and Lord this the reality of how personal a relationship you desire when we can bring it right down to just me I was the reason Lord of my mind I had to push away so many other thoughts and names and people Through the Ages that you died for but Lord it had to be personal you did it for me I was guilty but you're the sacrifice I was the taker but you are willing to give everything you had Lord Lord I pray this morning that Lord if anything Your Love would be projected to your people that loaded would just become that much more real to them that Lord then we could Lord out of our love for you lay everything down at your feet that we might all walk these last moments of time with our eyes set Like Flint on the word of God in this day so Lord I commit your people we would go from here our hearts Lord pondering on our love Lord and your love for us in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you the Saints may the Lord go with you this week may as you walk out and say you know Lord I want a fellowship with you like job communion with you like job that no matter the circumstance he has confidence in you he has confidence in you I heard a service just recently and there it was actually about a biscal he says you know we talk about a lot of us believing in God because you know God believes in you he believes in you know sometimes it's better head City so you need to hear that sometimes you might go through a difficult day you might have actually failed he made a mistake could go on a game or something like that and you just made a big mistake better bisco said you know the coach comes up to you and he says it's okay I believe in you you can do this next time and he said God does that he believes in you he believes in you he's placed his word in you and he believes in his word so with his word in you [Music] you are more than conquerors amen God bless you this morning as you go you can shake hands with one another you can just sing this song again as a prayer to him Lord I was the reason [Music] closer I was doing and he was the sacrifice [Music] where I go [Music] foreign thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign
