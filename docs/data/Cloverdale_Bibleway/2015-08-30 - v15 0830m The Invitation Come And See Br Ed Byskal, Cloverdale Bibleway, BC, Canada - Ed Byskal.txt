It has never lost its power. Praise our God. Amen. Can we sing? There's a fountain open in the house of David. Amen. We're going to prepare to go to prayer at this time. We do have a couple testimonies that we want to remember. Before we do, brother Jason and Sister Sammy have written in that a couple weeks ago we prayed for our neighbor's daughter who fell out of a second story window. She was lifellighted to Seattle with a hole in her head. And after surgery and 46 stitches and many tests, the doctors couldn't even determine that she had a concussion. They said it was a miracle. Praise God. Amen. There's power in prayer. Praise the Lord. Amen. Also, our brother Nathan Hilderbrand just wants to express his thanks to the saints of God for all their prayers and support recently on behalf of Sister Deborah. We give thanks to God for his abundant grace and mercy reflected through his people. Sister Deborah is getting stronger every day. The prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise thee up. Amen. God bless you, brother Nathan. Continue to remember sister Deborah. And why don't we sing this? I'm gonna ask our brother Tim Dodd to come. Do have one request from our brother Sterling. Just to remember a couple men that he has been witnessing to and a Christian man named Brian. Both of who have received tracks about the message. Just asking that God will show mercy and open their eyes. Amen. To the truth of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this song. There is a fountain open in the house of David to you who would believe. Are we believers this morning? Amen. And I trust that God will grant it to you according to your faith. There is a fountain that's open in the house of you will be. And there are streams of grace that's flowing down from Cal. [Music] &gt;&gt; There is a mountain. &gt;&gt; There is a mountain. And it's all in the house of David to you [Music] falling down from Calary. Just come now receive once more. There's a fountain open. There is a mountain [Music] of [Music] We are streaming the praise flowing [Music] from Cal. [Music] now and receive. Amen. And let's bow our heads together. If you're a believer this morning, if you're just a believer, the song said, "The fountain is open to those who believe." Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just raise your hand as a sign? Lord, I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; And I'm coming to the fountain this morning. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that there are streams of grace that have flowed from Calvary, oh God, that we might come and receive once again this morning. Lord, &gt;&gt; we might receive for ourselves, Lord. for our needs, for our burdens. Oh God, we might receive for our loved ones. Father, we might receive for those that have need of them this morning. Oh God, we truly are a needy people. But because you knew that we were needy, Lord, you said you're the God that meets all of our needs according to your riches and glory. You're the one that heals all of our sicknesses and diseases. We've heard the testimonies this morning, Father. How do you touch the little girl who fell from the window? Just an innocent child, Lord. And you came on the on the scene. A stream of grace flowed from Calvary for her, Lord. And she received as the saints lifted her up before you, oh God. We thank you for that, Lord. We thank you for so many answers to prayer. We thank you for your moving in the Hildebrand home. We thank you, Father, for your moving yesterday in the wedding and amongst us, Lord. And so many things you've done, Lord, in the midst of your people. We give praise to the name of Jesus Christ. That name above every name. And &gt;&gt; Father, we remember those that are away from us. Brother Tom and the needs that are there in Africa, Lord. Brother Michael's with him, Lord. Others are away on for different reasons. Some might be on vacation traveling. Others might be working in different areas. We remember them, Lord. Lord, we don't like to be away from our families, our loved ones, but sometimes it's required of us. Father, remember them, Lord, we pray. Give them each one safe journeys home. And Lord, we remember the service this morning. Father, we're here in your midst. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You have not left your children, Lord. Lord, you are right here because two or three are gathered in your name. We have come with expectation, Lord. We have come with desires in our hearts. &gt;&gt; We have come, Father, not to look at someone sitting next to us, but we've come to meet with you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, come and meet with us. We invite you speak through brother Bisco once again, Lord. Lord, we we do not count those things in the past as being sufficient. Lord, we want more this morning. &gt;&gt; We want to be drawn closer to you. We want you to wash us in the water of the word this morning. Cleanse us with that fountain that flows from on high. Lord, be with the remainder of the service as we even take up an offering. Father, money is not something that is of big consequence to you, Lord, but it is a form of our worship that we might take of the substance that you blessed us with and give it unto you. Lord, we pray, Lord, that you will bless it. And Lord, that you will multiply it to the need that you have of it. Lord, we realize, Father, it will never express how much we appreciate you. But Lord, we give it willfully and cheerfully unto you, Father, as we commit this service into your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats as we take up the morning offering. Amen. What do we sing? Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful? Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Wonderful.

Christ is our porn in God's word. Isn't Jesus my love? So wonderful. I was in an endless cycle of life. I did not know what to do. Every time I would try to change my ways, I would fall right back again. Then I came to a point where I had to say that that's it. I'm through. Lord, to you all my life I willingly give. I'm ready. [Music] I'll lay down my life. I'll carry my cross. And I'll live for you. No matter the cost. Take me through the fire to come forth this gold. Whatever you will. Take control.

He touched me." And oh, the joy that floods my soul. Amen. Something happened. Amen. And now I know you never be the same. Amen. Are you ready for the word this morning? &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to what the Lord has for us today. Amen. Maybe we could just start with the first verse. Shackled by a heavy burden. Once shackled by a heavy burden. Oh beneath the load of guilt and shame. name. But then the hand of Jesus touched me. Oh, and now I am no longer the same. For he touched me. Oh, he touched me. and all the joy that floods my soul. For something has happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole. Since I met. Oh, and since I met his blessing.

And since I had his blesses [Music] and sist [Music] is to praise. I shout in my eternity for he touch me. Oh yes, he touched me and my soul. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to turn the service to our pastor. I did forget one announcement. I'm sorry for my brother Richard. Uh due to the fact that we still need two Sunday school teachers to step forward, Sunday school will be delayed in starting this year until further notice. So, if you felt it on your heart at all, maybe you should pray about a little bit. Sunday school might be waiting on you. And maybe we just need a couple more teachers and just see our brother Richard about that. And let's sing that chorus once more as we turn the service to our pastor. He touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh the joy that floods my soul. I know something has happened. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. [Music] God bless you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We had a mighty wind yesterday, but we desire a mighty wind today. And a mighty wind that came in on the day of Pentecost. I'm I've just got a few comments to make before we will turn to the word and then uh we'll remain and I would like to sing that song. Open mine eyes that I may see. Uh we we're happy to have brother Milco back from Serbia and uh I had an email from brother Craig Bur. Uh he we actually have pictures but I won't take time this morning because I just have too many things to speak about uh that brother Milco brought back from Serbia. But uh I just thought I I just want to say a word about what brother Craig Bur had said. Uh he said, "I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know that I've returned home and I'm now with my church and family again. I want to say a very uh heartfelt thank you for sending brother Milco to assist us on our trip. He was so valuable to us in so many ways. He took very good care of us and I must say that I learned so many things from him. He shared many experiences with us that I found very enlightening. And then he went on to say further, I was also very impressed with brother Jonathan Larga. Uh and many of you know brother Jonathan Larga uh whose father was one of the first converts uh over in the former Yugoslavia which is and they live in Croatia. But he said I was very impressed with him. Jonathan I'm very impressed with him and his family and his mother. His father died as a young man and Jonathan just raised up in his teens and stepped into his dad's place and he just said he shared details with us about his Facebook outreach. His Facebook outreach is simply that he has brother Brandham on Facebook as uh uh as as not as a person as such but as a oh the word just escapes me just now but that pe a profile of brother Brandham and he's had hundreds of thousands of inquiries from all over the world and and brother Bour just said it was that the effects and what he is doing on Facebook was literally staggering and that he has written a complete program for the same thing to be run in the United States but he didn't have the sufficient funds or the or the uh people to run it but he said I think that we can handle that from us in our church and we're having a Skype conference today that was yesterday and I was tied up with the in the wedding and uh and uh uh and the reception later on. So there were just a lot of things happening. But he said uh we we have the young men and young ladies, young people within our congregation, he said, "And I believe we can handle the whole thing." Uh and it'll be just it would be staggering for you to know. And it's not even the hundreds of thousands. It's even millions that they have handled. And it's not enough for us to just look stareyed and say, "Well, you know, that's over there." No, it's it's what can I do? &gt;&gt; That's the that's the challenge. What can I do in this late hour? And everybody can do something. &gt;&gt; Everybody is, you know, just whether we're hospitable or whether we're we just a giving people. That's what we are to be. We're a giving people. We're so thankful for that. And thank you, brother Milco, for the uh good report and we'll be able to see more about these things a little later on. Uh I also uh had a email from brother Tom and uh he said I just received that this uh last night and he said I'm taking the last and final service today which will be Sunday at their time. It certainly has been very busy, but I must say a very rewarding experience, one that I will hold very dear. And your words of wisdom before I left have been very profound. I just I just felt so uh led, I guess I should say, and we just sat down, you know, and I said, I have a few words to say about about the meetings in Kinshasa. And uh he said it was just so so so fetting. But he he concluded by saying I can really see now what a jewel we have in brother Richard. That's brother Dioa. He's a he is a tremendous man of God and his love for you also runs very deep. Please greet the saints for me. So on behalf of brother Tom and and brother Michael, you have uh greetings and they're uh they're coming back wore out and that's good. We don't want them to come back, you know, all fresh and having had a having had a vacation. I remember I was in Johannesburg. had been I think it was our fifth year in Johannesburg and someone had just come over and they said well we just had them downtown etc etc and I said just a second I've been here 5 years I haven't seen downtown Johannesburg yet you know we're we're we're not here to see the sites we're here to do work and do labor and uh so God sees our hearts and there's nothing wrong with going downtown where we have nothing All right. Uh, I'll have you stand and brother Ryan, I'd like to sing. Open mine eyes that I may see. Glimpses of truth thou hast for me. Open my eyes that I can see. Graces of truth thou hast for me. Grace in my hand the wonderful king that shall set me free. Hallelujah. I wait for thee. Ready my God, th I will to see. Open my eyes to you and me. Spirit divine open my eyes open my [Music] Yes. [Music] This we pray father in the beloved name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Word made flesh &gt;&gt; walked amongst us and is here with us. &gt;&gt; This is your promise. This is your word. And we pray now, Father, that you'll just allow the Holy Spirit to have free uh free course within the service, the preeminence. We pray that you'll be glorified, lifted up, take control. Help us, Lord, to relax. Help us to be calm. Help us to just yield ourselves to the will and the mind and the voice of the Holy Ghost in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I want to just remark about the wedding yesterday and uh how thankful I was even though we had the big windstorm and the lights went out and all the rest of it. I did mention in the uh reception just briefly, but I noticed that the skylight is up right up here and uh the wind is howling outside and the lights have gone out and uh I thought, well, and then I noticed the sun started to shine right down there and the brethren pulled the curtains and light came in and I thought, "This is not bad." And so God shut off man's ingenuity and man's light and shone down himself. &gt;&gt; And I thought brother John did a wonderful job. Uh you know some of it from notes and probably some from memory. I can well imagine. I can well imagine what that said. But anyway the the main purpose of the service was to get a couple united &gt;&gt; and that happened. And then I I just happened to mention the Walner family, but I also want to mention Sister Helen Walner, whose maiden name was Dick, and her family was there. And Sister Anna, her sister sang, that was Anna Bondi. And for those of you that know, that's her sister. And then her brothers got up, four of them, and sang a quartet, I believe it was. And that's all Sister Helen's family. And without without her contribution, there wouldn't been a wedding. So, we're thankful for that. And God bless you, brother and sister, Esther Hson, for all the work and labors that you've done. And and your guests that have come also, some from South Africa and some from the States, and we're so thankful to make uh make their acquaintance and shake their hand. Once again, well, we're going to read some scripture, but uh uh would you mind standing while I before we read? I have some comments to make. Some some subjects are very very difficult to approach and this is probably one of them. Um I want to speak on the invitation come and see and how that come and see the invitation is actually in two parts. It's the come part and the see part seeing. Multitudes followed Moses. They came but they didn't see who it was that they were actually following until Moses came down from the mountain with the word and then they left and Jesus came in the early part of his ministry and it was all come oh this young prophet from Nazareth and oh they thought maybe he's a maybe he's Elias or Jeremiah or Isaiah or one of the prophets that's all very complimentary. But when he finally said, "I and my father are one." That was it. Except you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you. Oh, said, "Can you imagine what a doctor or medical people thought of that?" And people left. And the Bible says finally he was left with just a 12. He said that's when he said to Peter, "What who do men say that I am? or you're one of the prophets or you're this that or the other thing. He was a great rabbi. He was a great teacher. Whatever. But he said, "But who do you say I am?" He he made a statement which we've repeat all the time. But don't forget had never been said before. &gt;&gt; This was the first time. &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; And that had never been said before. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Blessed art thou." that was many people left and because they hadn't seen then I want to take you to and tie together the opening of the seals because a sealed book all down through the church ages we've had a sealed book and they came not that they were lost or anything but they came they came by the millions all during that time and God allowed that and they believed the word for their age or for their time. I also want to show from the scripture that God changes his form. And then I want to bring it down to the resurrection postresurrection in Luke 24, which is one of brother Brandham's last scriptures that he would read. And he calls it a prophecy. a prophecy made clear. Uh, modern events made clear. You have to hang on to that. You said, "Well, I've heard you say that. I haven't said it enough times." Modern events, events, what you're going through now, made clear by the prophecy. So, we need to look back at the prophecy, study the prophecy, ponder the prophecy. How, and that's what we'll do some this morning again. and and and see uh what was happening. And what was really happening is those disciples after the resurrection, they had come, they had followed, they went through the difficult time. They went through the falling away. They went through when everybody they hung on when they couldn't understand. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Can you identify with that? They hung on when they couldn't understand. They hung on because they couldn't let go. And Jesus in another form stayed with them till they could see him. &gt;&gt; And that's the seeing part &gt;&gt; and that's the critical part. So I firmly believe from the scriptures that Jesus Christ is lingering or desiring desiring to make himself known to his elect, the redeemed. Yet a little while in the world see me no more, seeth me no more, but you see me. Because I live, you shall live also. And in the message, the rising of the sun, prophet God said, he quotes that, "Because I live, you shall live also." Speaking to his wife, "Because I live, you live also." What a resurrection that that that was. And what a resurrection this is &gt;&gt; to be quickened from the dead. To be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power. He was waved to them. The word which was was waved back then back then on that day of Pentecost. The word made manifest now and as I say it is waved again for the last day. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; So in my my pre these are my pre-comments. It is supremely important that we, you both of us connect the scripture text that I want to refer to which is Revelation 6 which is the opening of the seals together with Luke 24 it to connect that in the opening of the seals is the invitation to come and see. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you open something, it's something to be seen. &gt;&gt; As long as it's closed, you can come to a closed book, but it doesn't mean that you will see until God ordains and allows this is open. This is to be open now. And then when the and and when the lamb took the book and opened the first seal, the the the the living creature said such beast as the living creature said, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; Who's he inviting? &gt;&gt; Us. &gt;&gt; That's who he's inviting. That in Luke 24, the post-resurrection is the record of those that did come. They did come. That's why they were there the first part of the invitation, but lost sight of him for a short time in the transition or the change, the time of change. And friends, we're not here just having church this morning. We actually happen to be in a season of change. Amen. &gt;&gt; The time when disciples are called upon to live out a prophecy that others in another age or a season will be called upon to fulfill. And there here we are. &gt;&gt; It is supremely important that we catch or see in the prophecies being fulfilled that we are there again. Uh the important thing for us at this point is not to be caught up with the Caiaphas crowd &gt;&gt; or the Judas and denying group or those that become weary and walk away. &gt;&gt; That's not our that's not what we're here for. I'm not just here to, you know, to in to reach out necessarily to that. We are not called to beckon or preach them all back. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are called to preach Christ and manifest his life in a way that those who can't let go or leave him will see him. &gt;&gt; That's what we're called to do. That's what it says. Preach Christ. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, as I laid and pondered these things which have been pondering for many days, his presence just came unexpectedly. And uh I found that I was I was pondering things that the prophet of God said. He said now he said if I can I'm not a preacher. I'm not a preacher. I can't preach like these men men of God preach. But he said I just try to yield myself &gt;&gt; relax myself quieten himself. And I just think what incredible what incredible. I began to think of the times that uh I was present and I'm conscious that with the passing of brother Perry Green and Brother Doug Mccuse and others of these men uh there's not many of my era left and I thought of the times if I'd only known or saw what I should have seen I'd have packed a recorder I would have packed a a video camera, I would have recorded these things for you. But now, all I can do is speak it &gt;&gt; and you'll be there to receive it and the Holy Spirit will witness it to you. &gt;&gt; So, we're not called to try to solve all the problems of people. We're not called to try to answer everybody's question, but we're here to tell you that this revealed word has the answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; This revealed word is none other. I can declare it with un with unsophisticated perhaps a conversation or words, but this revealed word is none other than the person of Jesus Christ. And if you can just get to see him. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'll seek to try to minister. And just before we come to the scripture, in the last last last service that brother Brown preached publicly, he says, "I have a message I feel from God. It's a little odd to some people and I can't help being no more." He breaks. I just got to be what I am. I don't mean to be different. It's just that I'm living at a changing time. And I'd like to impose that upon you. You happen to be in a changing time. &gt;&gt; Things are changing. And we're we're not concerned about the world and its condition. We know it's falling apart. We've been told that. &gt;&gt; We're not worried about all kinds of things and everybody's opinion and all that. We're not interested in it. &gt;&gt; We're interested in one thing. That this Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who walked with his disciples in Luke 24, the prophecy &gt;&gt; saying it out and then sending a prophet in the end time. You know why I think that record that that that time is only that's only recorded once where where it's called Cleopus and his friend. It's only and it was recorded and I believe recorded in such detail in Luke's gospel so that it could be picked up &gt;&gt; by Jesus Christ again using using an h a son of man a son of man don't get it wrong a son of man to reveal the son of man and now now come the time where he wanted to say now I want to reveal another aspect of myself. &gt;&gt; And that's why this has been left here because people have to hear they are the ones that are being called &gt;&gt; to live this out to experience this. &gt;&gt; And friends, the reason I'm so ardent or fervent about it is because it wasn't simple. It wasn't just we, you know, come to church and we do all the things, etc., etc., And we have uh we have our you know our our music and our uh preaching and the song service and the prayers and everything else. And I just want to I just want to caution you before we read the scripture. Brother Brandham says in this last service he said as long as you're building the wall one straight way it's all fine. The brick layers can and I feel like I'm probably a brick layer in the ministry. The brick layers can go right down the row. But when you have to turn the corner, that's where the time and we're not building a wall. We're building a house. You see? So these turns has come and we just want to pray for grace. Oh God, &gt;&gt; I don't want to just be a church goer. I want to be able to turn a corner. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, he turned a corner." Yeah, that's fine. Now, now it's our turn. &gt;&gt; We may have to turn a corner. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's down here. It's spoken. It's in word form. And now I pray that God will just help us. I'm going to read if you'd like to turn with me please to u revelation the 6th chapter. Thank you for standing. I'll be standing quite a while late yet. Verse one. And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it where the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts, and that was there's two beasts are referred to twice in the book of Revelation. And one is a wild untamed creature, but the other one is a a living creature &gt;&gt; that has active life. And it's in always in the good sense. one of the four beasts, saying, "Come and see." And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he had a bow, but no arrows. And he went forth conquering and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, "Come and see." And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him uh that sat upon uh that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there has there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, "Come and see." And I beheld, and lo, a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, "A measure of wheat for a for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine." And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, "Come and see." Thank you for standing. You may be seated. And I will I will have you follow me on the screen for one one or two slides. in the second seal are these words. So you'll read it with me now. A mysterious thing. Now when the beast told John just come and see and he didn't see what it was he just saw a symbol. Please mark that down in your minds because if you don't get that you don't you won't get you won't get anything f further. He just saw a symbol. And that symbol, the reason it was he said, "Come see." But he saw a symbol that was to symbolize it to the church in a way that they would watch until it came to the last age. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; It was spoken in a symbol. So people have always been very very keen and they've watched the symbol. It was to symbolize it to the church in a way that they would watch until it came to the last age and then the seal would be opened now and everyone understands that now the seals would be open. A symbol is something is anything that stands for or represents something else. In a story, a character uh uh an action, an object or an animal can be symbolic. Often these symbols stand for something abstract like a force of nature, a condition of the world or an idea. So, brother Venom is saying they saw it in a symbol form. That's the way John saw it and that's what he wrote in the scripture. That has been wrote in the scripture so that the church would uh hold that and see that until the last time until and and the reason he's saying the last age because in the last age the seal is opened and then it's told what it is. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm I don't want to get into it because I don't want to uh uh stray away from my my my subject. So now the the four times it is said the first four seals each time the living creature says come and see. Now, it's not only an invitation, but that encompasses the invitation. Come, and I can show you all down through the ages, multitudes came at the first part. Churches were established, people saw things, and doctrines were established, and creeds were established, and traditions were established. And many of you out there have all come from that. you've experienced that said, "Well, I was a Catholic. Well, I was a hu this or I was that. I was a Pentecostal. I was something else. I was a Luther and I was something else." And all of those have been established from and each one of them read the same symbol and have a different answer. It was absolutely essential that God bring an absolute &gt;&gt; in the end time. Otherwise, we have nothing to put our feet upon where no grounds, no absolute. And then not only to say it's an absolute, but to declare what it is. This this this horse one riding the white horse. He's everything from the Holy Spirit to the devil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he's the devil. &gt;&gt; He comes riding with deception. But uh but but then the other power that that rode out, the other power that God raised up, and he raises up one in every age to combat &gt;&gt; that power. &gt;&gt; And what God sends is always more than adequate &gt;&gt; for what Satan sends out. &gt;&gt; And so friends, it doesn't matter what he's doing. We're not interested in his scheme because we have his scheme numbered. Amen. &gt;&gt; So who is giving the invitation? The beast the living creature says come and see. And in the I don't have to give you meaning because uh the living creature is this to live to breathe to be among the living not lifeless not dead. So when you see the beast says come and see this is what the scripture this is the meaning of that to have true life and worthy of the name active blessed endless in the kingdom of God. It represents living water having vital power in itself and exerting the same upon the soul to be full of vigor to be fresh strong efficient and active and powerful. Now, aren't aren't those all sound good? &gt;&gt; That's exactly what that is. &gt;&gt; So, where is the where we can say, well, that that's fine. That's a nice representation. But where is it? Well, I can tell you friends that I don't need to excite you. It's enough to declare that God has said that. &gt;&gt; But then we have to have a a a voice that can uh not only declare it but represent it and identify it and say here it is. See this here. See there it is. And you can see it in the world and see see it all within the church world and denominations. But now here's it's not enough to find out just what's wrong. &gt;&gt; You have to have an answer &gt;&gt; for the people to believe in someplace to anchor their faith. &gt;&gt; So Jesus spoke in parables which are somewhat like a symbol. Jesus spoke in parables, but he spoke in parables in such a way that the scripture says, "And the scribes and Pharisees, especially the Pharisees, perceived that he spoke of them &gt;&gt; because a parable is like an analogy. It's it's it's descriptive of something taking place." And they perceive that he spake of them. Same thing today. Exactly the same thing. And in the first seal, it says it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal. And what did it reveal? And this is what's Please, I wanted to make a slide of this, but I I didn't have a chance. The first seal. Now, here's a prophet taking that same verse we read. It thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal. And what did it reveal? Not all of itself. First, it was with God. Next, it's in a symbol. Then, it's revealed three things. It's coming forth from the throne. First, it can't be seen, heard, or nothing. It's sealed up. You can't see who the author is in a sealed book. &gt;&gt; You getting my point? &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying it and perhaps it takes someone in the ministry to just take that's why I ponder spend so much time. First, it's a symbol. See, first he said it's with God. God has it. Then it's given and it's in a symbol form and the prophet says it's in a symbol form all through the church ages so it can be symbolized to the people and they they they ponder it and they think about it and and all kinds of doctrines. I I heard someone was on had a radio broadcast same time we had a radio broadcast. He opened the seven seals. &gt;&gt; You don't even know his name. I uh I know his name but I won't mention it just now. Uh uh. Where'd it go? Nowhere. &gt;&gt; Now here comes someone with a seventh grade education out of Kentucky and preaches the opening of the seals. And where's it gone? All over the earth. &gt;&gt; In many, many languages. &gt;&gt; Why? Because because it was so perfect. No. No. It wasn't because it was so nice and and set out just nice. It was a a gripping because it the Holy Spirit was there to reveal it to the people. The believing heart when it fell into a believing heart, &gt;&gt; it it people saw &gt;&gt; saw something. &gt;&gt; I know what I say when I say saw something. So now it was just it was just a a a symbol, he said. So it thundered. It it was sealed up. The lamb's the lamb's blood paid the price. It thundered when he spoke it out. And when he did, now don't lose. Don't lose your thought when I speak of the symbols. It thundered. That's a symbol. the lamb. It's a symbol. He's not that form. I'm gonna please if you you'll have to really pinch your conscience. It thundered. And when he spoke it out and when he did, a white horse rider started out. He said, "And it still was a symbol." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a symbol. All of those are symbols. &gt;&gt; So, one says, "Oh, the white horse rider is the Holy Ghost." And well, I I I I'm sorry. I just need to have a a prophet, please. Yeah, &gt;&gt; one who can be vindicated maybe on a completely different scale, something that I can understand. Somebody hears in front of him and they're sick. I understand that. That's not a symbol. They're sick. Uh they're crippled or there's something and and and he stands there and says, uh he's one one real outstanding a lady's there and he says, "You've been examined by doctors, etc., and they couldn't find out what's wrong. And he says, and he said, "Can I?" And he whispers, "Can I tell the people?" Because he didn't want to embarrass her. He says, "When you were a child, you fell down a well." Where do you get that? When you were a child, that's why I'm standing here. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's not a symbol. That's a That's a woman standing there and and and and and it goes to the world and it's on tape and it's public. &gt;&gt; And you fell down a well and loosened your organs and they've never been able to find out what's wrong. That's not a symbol, friends. That's reality. And to have a woman say, "That's the truth." &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we're not following some fables. We're not following some interpretation of symbols. &gt;&gt; We're following something that's been proven with clear evidence, &gt;&gt; something that you can understand. I can understand. It's not mysterious. It's reality. &gt;&gt; It's something worth being excited about. Finally, you found truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Finally, you found a mouth. Truth. And if he says truth and it's not a symbol there, then he can take the symbols of this &gt;&gt; and declare it to us. &gt;&gt; Now he said, now watch, he said it would be known in the last day, but it comes forth in a church symbol. Do you understand it, church? It comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal, but just what it is yet, they don't know because it's a white horse rider. And it is only I'm only using as an example. And it it only is to be revealed in the last day when the actual seal is broken. Broken to who? Not to Christ, but to the church. Notice now. Oh my, that just makes me tremble. I hope that the church truly understands it. You people, I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Change the whole atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You accept that? Amen. &gt;&gt; A voice is a thunder. The voice came from where? From the throne where the lamb had just left his as intercessor. Now he's standing here to take his position and his claims. &gt;&gt; The voice shook the ground. There was a thunder. The voice shook the foundations of your old religions and beliefs. &gt;&gt; The voice each of the four beasts all said, "Come and see." And that's my message today. Come. And that's why you're here. That's why you're sitting in this congregation. Come &gt;&gt; and see. &gt;&gt; It's not sufficient just to come. it and and there is something there for us as individuals, you that may be here as visitors for the first time. I I don't know perhaps those friends that have stayed over from the from the wedding. But I want you to know that this building and this uh society or this uh this church is not here just to entertain or to have the formality. We're not going in a straight line just building another wall. That's not the program. The program is there's someone to say. &gt;&gt; Someone spoke. &gt;&gt; Someone thundered. They put it in a thunder back there. It's not a thunder anymore. It's a voice that's been spoken. &gt;&gt; And it's not just a book that's been written. There's an author behind it. There's an author. It's the same Christ, same Jesus Christ yesterday and today and forever. He'll be the same again. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave some out here because I want to I want to get to some what I consider very important. I was very very touched. Not only did these riders, this is symbolic now, not only did the horse riders ride out and power and take peace from the earth and all of these things, but this voice that was crying out, come and see. There was an anointing because those living those living creatures was like an anointing that would come down upon the people to combat. And I I I h I I have that. He said, 'Now we'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church responding to the anointing and they couldn't do anything. He said in one place he said uh you he quotes the scripture don't hurt the oil and the wine. That's the uh that is the stimulation. Listen friends, their stimulation with preaching, their stimulation with believing the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They didn't care. Speaking of the believers back there, they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrifice. It was the time of the ox. There was different ages, lion, the ox, and the labor and and so on. And he said they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrifice labor. And they walked up just as freely as they could walk anointed with the true spirit of God of that age. But now we're in another age. &gt;&gt; And this is what's really heavy upon my heart. I don't want to speak to you. I don't want to just preach to you. I want to rather make an announcement to you. It might not mean as much to you as it does to me and I trust I could convey it. I believe that I'm identified that we are identified with the people in Luke 24 &gt;&gt; because I take it from the I take it from the statements. What a resurrection that was. That was their time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it wasn't easy. The ladies did what ladies do. They went home and they made spices. That was their concern. And make spices. He's already changed form. &gt;&gt; They had to have will you? I'm going to risk being considered kind of off up here for a moment. I'm going to take that risk. The ladies prepared spices and that's what they do. And here's the apostles. They're men. They got, you know, men do what men do. Men are in control and they do things. And but they're fearful now because their leader has died. And this is a very, very dim, sad time, wretchedly sad time. and and and the whole group has fallen apart. You've heard me say it before, but I want it to be such a reality. And the treasurer has committed suicide and the political system has come against him and the religious system has come against what we believe and we had believed that he would be the one that would deliver us from this Roman hand. They were looking for some political deliverance and things and it doesn't always turn out the way we anticipate it. &gt;&gt; It doesn't always happen the way we have it figured out. And you know, I I'm I'm reaching way out here. Some of our problem is a carryover from the church world. And I believe that our our anticipation and our expectation is tainted &gt;&gt; and it could be it could be that it dims our our vision and they were expecting something else. But now he had actually changed. And so the women the women just like sisters like you, what are you concerned about? Well, we're concerned about, you know, what people eat and we'll have a lunch and we'll have whatever more and we'll have a reception or we'll have, you know, we're taken up with things. This is what this is what happens in the church. This is what we do. We feel responsible to do certain things. And what we do, what our custom is here, we anoint the body with spices. And so we'll go home and prepare the spices and and then they come and then you know then they're thinking about woman things. Who's going to roll the stone away? Now what are you thinking? You're talking about the resurrection. And the prophet says what a resurrection that that was. &gt;&gt; But what a resurrection this is. &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? Things that aren't real. No, he's talking about reality. &gt;&gt; Saying that's a prophecy. Who's fulfilling it? &gt;&gt; When is it going to be fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Who's going to roll the stone away? And they come and the stones rolled away. So they come and they look in in there and they see a young man. The Bible says one place they see a young man and he's in a long garment. And he says, "Who who do you seek? Oh, he said, "I know that you seek Jesus of Nazareth. He's not here." And he said, "Remember when he said to you, and listen close now, first time I've I encountered it in a in a message this last week." And Brother Brandham says the angels were there when he he said when they they said, "Remember how he said to you?" He said they were there when he said that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said the angels are around the believers. &gt;&gt; And if that's true, then I have to say unequivocally that the angels of God are present in this building. This building isn't here to entertain people. This building isn't here just to preach services. This building isn't here just to fill some some need in your life. This building is here so that you can come to see Jesus Christ, the author of this message. &gt;&gt; He's the author of it. &gt;&gt; That's why it's here. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, you can miss a lot of things in life. Don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Don't miss this one. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; And then this is go and tell his disciples. So they ran and told the disciples and Peter and John. Two of them ran. John was a faster. He outran Peter and he looked in the tomb, but he didn't go in. I'm I'm I'm stressing this now. And then Peter went in. And then John went in. And Peter went in and he saw the linen cloth that was around his head is wrapped up separate from the other linen clothes. And I was at a Jewish wedding not too long ago. And my family was there, a very dear friend, Orthodox Jew. And with them, they, you know, they don't inbomb them. They want them to return to the dust as quickly as possible. Just hold that. And they wrap. They wrap. It doesn't matter whether the man is a popper or a billionaire. The family, the men of the family wash the body and wrap them in linen and it put into a plain box, a plain wooden box, and buried as quickly as possible. And the family, I was standing there as they poured the dirt on it. This is in this is in United States of America. This is in Los Angeles. This is in a highass cemetery, but you're buried as same as Jesus was buried into a tomb with linen. He was wrapped in linen and put in this box. I asked a funeral director over here. I said, "Is the cost any different if they don't have to embomb somebody?" No, I said it's pretty much the same. That's a racket. Excuse me. It's a racket. And brother Brandham says, "I feel," he says, "I was thinking about a corpse." He said, "I feel sorry. I feel sorry for the corpse. He's dead." And then he goes, they take him to a morg. He said, "I feel sorry for him." They take him to a morg and pump him full of fluid to make sure he stays dead. He said, he said, "Then these churches," he said, "they receive," he said, "these cold formal morgs, &gt;&gt; they take someone who's dead and pump him full of doctrine and make sure he stays dead." &gt;&gt; I say, "Thank God for some truth." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Said to brother Chris Price, you know, brother Chris Price, nobody can forget him. 6'10", I think he is. He I was talking to him and just talking about the message to him and he said, "I just want to come up there." He says, "And you just put the needle in my vein and just keep feeding it to me." That's the way he put it. Hallelujah. I just want truth to be &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the disciples then they ran. I'm glad. Now this is where if you consider this is kind of off track. Just put it to me because I enjoy it. I'm glad that somebody in this day outran me and ran to the tomb. And we had a prophet in this day look and see. He went into the darkness of Leodya and they went into the tomb and said, "He's not here. &gt;&gt; He's not here." Amen. &gt;&gt; And Cleopus and his friend are walking with him. Now we're getting into we're going from Revelation 6. Now we're back to Luke 24 and also Mark 16 and also John about 20. And he's walking and they're walking with him and now he's a different form. In Moses' time, he was a pillar of fire and a burning bush and he was a cloud by day and a fire by night. And then all through the scriptures, uh, some saw him as a man. And then they didn't even realize that they'd seen God. And they said, "We're going to die because we've seen God." And they saw him as a man. Some saw a prophet uh the the woman who who didn't have a child saw a man of God and she said to her husband, "Can't we just build a place for this man of God?" And they didn't know what they were doing. And and to her it was a man of God. Didn't know he was Elijah. And they built a place and it was a woman. So she was interested in water and a pitcher and a little table and a bed where he could lay down and rest. And after that, she didn't know what she was doing. God simply looked upon that and said, "That's it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bless you." &gt;&gt; Prophet says, "Call the woman. What can we do for her?" Says, "Everything's fine. I'm here with my people and I'm at peace and I really don't need anything." And Gahesy says, "She hasn't got a child. She hasn't got a baby. You'll have a child. you'll embrace a child and 12 years later the child dies and and then she knows where to go and she gets a child a second time. What is that? That's a blessing of God. Let me say something to you friends. I'm getting very very personal. From the very day you weren't here, many of you weren't here. I saw Sister Violet Laws and she was here in the house. There you are, Sister Violet. But the one thing and I I I I my heart is touched, but I I I just knew that something was on the tapes. Something's in that voice that these young people that these young men, they need. And that was the beginning. Then we wanted to put it on the radio and went went for about nine years on the radio. Went into Africa. New people from South Africa. People from down there told me that they were they were they were there when brother Brandham's passport was stamped. He could not preach. Billy Paul's was stamped in case he used that passport or whatever. and uh and and he said there and I've seen the little 8 mm film. He said uh at the airport I but I believe Africa will hear my voice again. And the people said a brother said do you think you can get on the radio? And we got on the radio on Swazi music radio, 100,000 watts covered an area inhabited by 87 million people and and brothers there told me that they fell on the floor when I heard brother Brandham's voice coming over in Africa hearing his voice once again. You could just see that spirit of Elijah and and right after that a big Pentecostal movement sent out a magazine which was their magazine. And they sent out this magazine and I read the headlines myself says where is Elijah &gt;&gt; and here they just had rejected him. All I'm telling you here a little group in the house and then we went into a log church. I'm not talking about us. I'm talking about him and this word. That's what I'm talking about. And and just tens of thou we didn't have didn't have any consideration of the cost. What is the cost? It wasn't the cost. was this message need to go out. &gt;&gt; God has to look after the cost. &gt;&gt; And it was it was huge. &gt;&gt; It was huge, folks. I didn't I didn't even know it at the time, but it was huge. It was about $70,000 a year. I'm not here to talk about finance. I'm here just to tell you what happened. But do you know that we never ever needed to pump? never had to ask for funds, never had to take it from the people because God always provided it. I don't know where it came from. Just came pouring in and we got to build another place. So, we built a log church and that was packed out and came into this church and packed out. And today, even today, you can ask our our our brothers, we don't pump for it. We take an offering which is considered uh that's what we're instructed to do. just receive an offering from the people. But I all I want to say is God Almighty, if this is his word, he prospers it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't I I I hesitated about this this morning because I didn't want you I didn't want to be misunderstood. Brother Milo here has traveled over about 30 years. He traveled to hundreds of places probably with me or many many maybe that's an exaggeration but many many trips and and and and it was very very necessary but he was one of two people that got lifetime free travel or next to free on the airlines and was able to come. So consequently took the prophet's message into Yugoslavia when it was absolutely rigid. who couldn't do so. And and and I was standing right there when the officer uh went like this thought we couldn't speak speak their language. So he just went like this. He wanted our suitcases open. Brother Milo's suitcase is sitting here to declare that this is the truth. He and this is the truth. Brother Milco, you raised your hand. And it was full of tapes. His suitcase was absolutely full of tapes. That wasn't only a no no. that was worth a prison sentence. And the man I opened up my case and I got my shirts and all the suit and things and and he opens up his case and it's all tapes and the man just goes like this. So we folded up our suitcase. Brother Milo looked at me right in front of right in front of him and said to me he didn't he all he saw was shirts. That's exactly what he said. All he saw was shirts. I don't know what he saw. All I know is he didn't see the tapes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, the believers over there took up a little offering. Just believers like yourself took up an offering and and and wanted to get some u the church agents or something printed and uh and they slipped it into a video into a video package. And because because the brother knew he was going to be examined by the police and saw the police come on and start to come through the uh train cars and he thought I have to get rid of this. So he tried to figure out where where they were and threw that $4,000 that came from this church in US money, stuck in a video box and threw it out the window into the grass and went back the next day with a sythe trying to find where it was and found that box &gt;&gt; with the money in it. &gt;&gt; Who loves this message more than us? God loves it. God loves his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now this is where I want to come to the one thing that is and you go home and read and ponder Luke 24. And I found another place in 1958 where brother Brandham refers to that as a prophecy. &gt;&gt; I take that very very serious. I feel that I have been a part of a part of the fulfillment that we are a part of the fulfillment. What a resurrection this is. And and if we're expecting and I hear I hear it preached. Brother John mentions it quite often, the body change. &gt;&gt; And we don't want that just to be a phrase &gt;&gt; for you to hear &gt;&gt; and to repeat. a body change. But I can tell you something that this message says in different ways. There'll be a sweep. What kind of a sweep? I don't know. But there'll be a sweep that'll come over us. He says another place there'll be a change in the atoms. &gt;&gt; I can say this to you and I will say it without apology. I believe that it is essential. You've heard this. You've heard the statement get into the word or get into the message or get into I want to say it at a different at a different level. I would ask you to take it and ponder it and go into the scripture and ponder it and read Luke 24 if you would and ponder it and recall that this is a prophecy and I'm in here someplace because really what was happening he's changing his mask he's changing his form from flesh to be a spirit. He's changing his form. And Apostle Paul saw him and he says this, "I I I was on my way to Damascus and I saw a great light &gt;&gt; and I heard a voice." &gt;&gt; Now, he Now, he wasn't just It wasn't what Mary saw in the garden. It wasn't Maybe I'm bewildering you, but it's it'll be good. it'll be productive. We don't know. We're not trying to isolate and say or define this is going to be what you're going to see. This is what going to be your form. But the Bible does say that the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; And we were that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them. &gt;&gt; That is the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is a scripture that God loves. &gt;&gt; Furthermore, it's a scripture that will be the ultimate victory &gt;&gt; over death. &gt;&gt; People have died have died for centuries, for thousands of years. People have died. But there's going to be a time that there's going to be some that are going to cheat death. &gt;&gt; They're going to ride victorious over death. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether I do, I don't know. I trust I will. But there's going to be people that are going to cheat death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have a possibility. &gt;&gt; Orin, you brothers, &gt;&gt; you families, you sisters. I'm getting right down to where you live. We have an opportunity. It's been said, "What is this message all about? If this message isn't about that, is this message about another another church or just some things that we believe?" I say, "No, &gt;&gt; that's not really what it is." &gt;&gt; You're nice and quiet. I want to say something else to you every time. Now, it's no mystery. Uh what Satan has rode out with. Oh, he's rode out with technology and he's rode out with soft living and he's rolled out with economics that puts a lot of pressure. There isn't anybody here that hasn't got some economic pressure. One way or another, you got some economic pressure. That's part of life. These things tend to uh you know dim our vision. We become involved and the burdens of life who hasn't got burdens &gt;&gt; the burdens of life become they weigh way we way down. I can I can take you to the scripture says that we get weary. can become very very weary with life and it tends to dim our vision and then we start getting you know we're where our our conversation or we become uh engaged everything that we're engaged in is you know about our work or about our what we're doing and so on and so forth and to and I laid down yesterday and as I laid there and I begin to think of the greatness of God and God became so great and I thought of the constellations and I thought of the heavens and the heavens that declare his glory and the more I thought about him friends I'm standing here speaking to you I got feeling smaller and smaller and I begin to think about you know what I think and what someone else thinks and all these tinkly little things and I thought, what does that mean to God? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. And we become so taken up with it and so involved with it and and then that he thinks this and they think that and some opinion over here and something over there. Listen friends, we we're getting out of focus. &gt;&gt; We're getting out of focus. Don't get out of focus. &gt;&gt; Keep your eye on the goal. Keep your eye on the prize. &gt;&gt; What is our prize? You say, "Oh, God, you you you've got a change. You've got a there's a possibility. There is a possibility that I can actually experience this change. There's a possibility that I will see the resurrected ones. There's a possibility. To me, that's everything. &gt;&gt; To me, that's everything in life. &gt;&gt; We can live. We can work you boys, you young ladies. We can, you know, we can have our homes and get married and all of these things and and and that can occupy us and we can just think, oh, if this could only happen or that could only happen. Let me tell you something from someone who's got some years gone. It'll go by just like that. &gt;&gt; And you will remember these words. You'll find yourself at the other end of the spectrum looking around and saying, "Well, that's gone by fast." &gt;&gt; What's the next 10 years like? &gt;&gt; Just like the last 10. &gt;&gt; That's what it's like. &gt;&gt; The next 10 is just like the last 10. Unless you say, "Here, I'm going to I'm I'm going to change I'm here in this meeting and I am preaching that we will observe the signs. I'll give you two signs. the sign of Messiah and the prophet said that you've seen it and the sign of the resurrection &gt;&gt; and we have seen that this prophet you perhaps didn't understand this prophet went into the dooms and into the gloom of this dark Leodysian age &gt;&gt; and and came out to the public and said, "He's not there. He's not in that. He's not in the world council of churches. He's not in the great denominational institutions. He's not in their schools. It's fine. He's not in that hospital system. It's fine that they're there for that." And he and he can speak so nicely. And he speaks about the doctors so so caring and so compassionate and speaks about them in such a lovely way. But that's not the anchor and that's not where the believer has his his goal and his prize fixed. Friends, we must gather here to become enthused and to become excited about this purpose and this goal. &gt;&gt; And I I I I think of the the disciples even in their dismal despair with nowhere to turn and talking to hello church talking directly to Jesus Christ in another form I I I I don't want to be misunderstood I'm just staggering around because I don't want to be misunderstood but brother Brandham said so many times you'll never be closer to God than where you're standing right now. &gt;&gt; And you have to understand he's not saying that he's God. He's not even saying he's the Messiah. But that which he that person that was with him, that one he was revealing was the Messiah. That one that's why he could say, "You hear my voice, but it's not me speaking." You've got to hear those things. You've got to you've you must receive those things and believe those things. That that that that was not for him. That was for us. &gt;&gt; That was for you and for me. That's him walking he walking with me. And yesterday I I just found tears. Uh not that that's important, but they were going out of my eyes and down my face. I thought if I had only if I could only have known. But now I want to stress it to the people that I love and the people that I know love this message. I want to stress it. Brother Bisll may not be here forever to tell you that, but I want to stress that you have this opportunity. This is what you've been called to. And I can tell you one thing with full assurance. You live for this message. You live your life for others. And you will not have anything to be concerned about. God will be in control of your life. God will make the decisions for you. Even when you're trying to do the very best you can, you'll find that God works in the background. You and you'll turn around. You'll turn around as I have done many times. And I've spent many hours with my wife now saying we didn't realize that this is the way it was going to be. We didn't realize that God was in control here. We were worrying and concerned about certain things, but ultimately God is in control. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; life may not be easy. Life is harder for some than for others. Some have life is is hard for them and we have compassion for that. But on the other hand, some through the waters and some through the flood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But all through the blood. &gt;&gt; We don't know. And if life is not easy for you, the the best way, the clearest way that I can say it for you is if you keep your eyes on him, your problems will be painless. &gt;&gt; I was glad that somebody ran before me. I'm glad, friends, that someone ran before me. I'm glad I'm certainly glad that there was someone who went to the tomb back there at the prophecy, went to the tomb, found he wasn't there. I'm glad that that resurrection took place. I'm glad he's alive. I'm glad that the disciples even they could find out and then they became apostles mighty apostles being told by the ladies that he's not there and then going there themselves finding he's not there. You know, one of my concerns, it's a very real concern, and if if this was even my last service, I would want to say this. Don't let this message and this church ever become just a place where we come and have a church on Sunday and a church on Wednesday and that we just do then you're just building a wall. You're just laying bricks in a straight line. Say I am there with full expectation that the Holy Spirit is going to continue the change in my life and not not just something fictitious or something imaginary but a reality a real change. I'm going to be in a position and and I'm awaiting a sweep. I'm awaiting I I'm I'm I'm one here to be a fulfillment of that prophecy. I'm here. It was laid out as a prophecy. A prophet came and identified that scripture and he said to me, "This is a prophecy and I am here to be a fulfillment of that prophecy." &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be worthwhile? That's what life is worthwhile. And then when you come to the end or you or or years down the road, you turn around, if it hasn't happened, that's fine. My father's eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could do it in my lifetime if he wished to. If he didn't do it in my lifetime, that's his business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the events made clear. He said, "Let's go back a few minutes and let's listen to the words quoted from himself." Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was quoting, "Hello, congregation. &gt;&gt; Say what you wish to say after this service." But Jesus kept quoting the scripture to them. Quoting the scripture to them, giving them examples until they could see who it was that was talking. &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray before God that across this pulpit and in your private life you'll hear him talking to you, &gt;&gt; giving scripture to you. That's my that's my responsibility to point out and I'm I'm steering you to Luke the 24th chapter and Mark's 16th chapter where he was changing form and he is changing form and he's here to change your form. You're not going to remain just in this human form in this weekend destined. There isn't a man or woman here. There isn't a child here. But what they're going at it getting older at a very fast pace. But we are not destined to merely get older according to the word of God. We're destined for eternal life, which we are possessors of that life. Even at this time, we now possess it. But God wants to reveal to us what's in us. And Jesus said, Jesus said, "The world will see me no more." But you shall see me &gt;&gt; because I'll be in you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said some shocking things. He spoke about the Islam and the Muhammad Muhammad belief. And he said uh I've been to the I've been to Muhammad's tomb. He said they changed the horses. The horse guards are every four hours waiting for him to resurrect. He said our Lord's tomb is empty. &gt;&gt; Muhammad is still there. But our Lord's tomb is empty. But they said they they can make any claim the Christian can make. The Christian says, "Well, he's risen." And they said, "Well, prove it." Well, he lives in our heart. They said they they can say the same thing. He lives in our heart. But the prophet took another step. &gt;&gt; Your prophet &gt;&gt; who gave these examples who had did everything to direct you to this word. He took another step. And he he goes beyond show us the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you like to see the father? &gt;&gt; And I feel it's a great responsibility upon the ministry upon us as ministers to bring you to a place where somehow faith can reach out. I feel that if if we fail that perhaps I fail but where faith can reach out because if I believe everything that has been spoken I have to believe that the angels are here I have to believe that Jesus Christ is resurrected and is here and I believe he's walking with us and he's trying to tell us not because I'm speaking but he's trying to say something extra into your heart and tell you that I am here. It's me. It's me as the author, the creator of heavens and earth, the giver of every good gift. It's me that's here. You're not to be concerned and worried about every little thing. Just listen to my voice. Listen to the guidance that he'll speak to your own heart. Not necessarily what the preacher will say, but what he speaks to your own heart. That you'll live by that. You'll live by that conviction. You'll live by that consecration. I can tell you one thing. We need a baptism of dedication, a baptism of consecration. Hallelujah. We need that this message will take a hold of us and and and literally consume everything else that's around us until the world and all the education and all the money and all the burdens and all the pressures just become tinkling tinsel that have become meaningless things. It just must not &gt;&gt; obscure &gt;&gt; our vision &gt;&gt; and occupy us. &gt;&gt; I see gifted &gt;&gt; young men, gifted, talented, and I don't apologize to say be a giver. &gt;&gt; Give your life. &gt;&gt; Don't be one that just receives what can I get out of it. You say, "What can I give? What can I do for this word? What can I do for this Christ?" When you talk about the message, I'm talking about a person. What can I do for him? &gt;&gt; What can I do for this glorious word? [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to embarrass anyone. I said this once to brother Milo. &gt;&gt; We would go to Yugoslavia and and excuse me, brother Mila, but you'd get, you know, quite excited and enthused. You're back home and with your people and you get emotionally involved and getting the word to them is such a joy. And I said, "My forefathers come from Ukraine. I've been to India. I've been to South Africa. I've been to Malawi. I've been to Zimbabwe. I've been to Congo. I've been to all these places about 45 countries. And I went for years and years and never got to the Ukraine. Never even got where my forefathers were. But the burden was when I looked into their eyes and I I looked into the eyes of some of the brothers from Africa and they said uh uh oh if we could only have the message in our language &gt;&gt; and I I just could not stand to look there. I came back. I broke down. I spoke to people such as sister Glattis Dao who became who who even built the building in Africa and rather in India for the printing of the message uh that it could be printed and we start printing in in one in in one language and then another language and then they said 2,000's not enough so we put it to 5,000 then we need 7,000 in this language and another language and t Tamil and Telugu and and all of these different languages. meages and God just kept pouring in, pouring in. And I sat back. I said, "God loves this message. &gt;&gt; God loves it. &gt;&gt; He's paying the bills. &gt;&gt; Is there no end to it? &gt;&gt; This thing is unstoppable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And friends, when you say, "Man, I'm burdened for I'm burdened for it. I'm burdened in such a way. I wonder that when I can't do it, who's going to pick up the mantle? Who's going to pick it up and say, "We're going to do something." &gt;&gt; I don't know what, but even if I get even if I reach one, even if I'm able to testify to one, even if I'm able, some of you here can &gt;&gt; can translate. &gt;&gt; I wish I could. &gt;&gt; I wish I could do it. I would certainly do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would certainly see that there were I I'd do as brother Murphy did. Brother Timothy Timothy Ma when he first came and he and it was burning out our our printing our photocopier in the office. I don't hardly know him. What are you doing here? I'm I'm printing out a message. I'm printing out uh uh I'm printing out choosing of a bride. I'm printing it out both in Vietnamese and in English at the same time because they love to see that there's English there. And I just said, "God bless you. Burn a thing out. I don't care." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Burn it out. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm preaching like this because I'm a preacher." Not a chance. Not a chance. I said, "Even if if somehow God doesn't pay the bills, God will provide another way." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God will provide a way. You think we talk about flowery things. Oh, the He owns a cattle on a thousand hills. Yes, he does. But he also gave me a pair of hands that I can work. He gave me a brain that I can think about. We don't have to stumble along in life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God. He's the source of all wisdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I might as well say it the way it is. I won't say this again. You can ask Sister Biscll after the meeting if this is correct. I'm trying to lay importance. I'm trying to lay glory upon him. I'm trying to tell you to perhaps you need to forget what your ambitions are and let them at least take a different place in your life. Say, "My first ambition is in life. I need to provide for my family." If you're a man, I need to care for my children. If you're a woman, uh, young ladies, you can kick me out of here after this. You won't have to won't have any trouble. But I would learn how to be a mother. I'd learn how to s sew clothes. I'd learn how to feed people. I'd learn how to care for people. And if you're worried about caring for somebody, maybe some of us seniors might need a hand and doing things for others. And you young men, you got good strong body. Don't just think exercising your brain. exercise your your physique and your muscle and your living and and and and and count on doing something &gt;&gt; for the church &gt;&gt; for the people of God. &gt;&gt; Count on doing something. &gt;&gt; I actually know people and their entire vision and the entire mission is to support the work of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we're blasted on uh we're blasted on the internet. I pray God forgive the poor person, &gt;&gt; a woman or whoever it is. God forgive them. &gt;&gt; If they only knew the truth. &gt;&gt; Have you people ever been Have you ever been overladen or burdened down financially? Have has it ever happened? Not in the 35 or 38 years of this church have we ever done that because we don't believe in it. Have we ever tried to build the people for money? Never have tried to do that. &gt;&gt; In fact is when I was going to the native Indian people, they didn't hardly have enough food to feed my family. I'm telling you this because I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you personal experience. I'm driving home from a Sunday service in my car on Lamson Road in Victoria and I actually jerk the car over and pull off to the side of the road. The Holy Spirit spoke in such clear tones. We didn't have anything. We're barely making barely barely living. And I said, "We're coming into some money. We're coming into a lot of money." I said, "And it has nothing to do with your father." Isn't that what I said, dear Sister Bisll? Is that what I said? I said, "I don't know how. I don't know anything more about it." And we drove away and never discussed it after that. God gave me a job. God gave me a job. One that maybe you might not even like is in the basement of an old rotten building. And when I went home at night, I couldn't feel my legs from my knees down. I'm not telling you a story. I'm telling you something that happened. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you about life. &gt;&gt; I'm the minister here today. I'm I'm telling you about reality. And I'm telling you about God. God knew I couldn't feel my legs. God knew that I got congestion and I'd come home and I couldn't hardly I after 30 days I quit. And I go to the man said, "I'm quitting." He said, "Well, I'd hope you wouldn't we kind of like what you're doing a British man." And I said, "I I can't I can't work in this basement any longer." I What? Why? What? What is I doing? Trying to get rich? You got to be kidding. I'm trying to feed my family. trying to feed my daughters who are sitting here. That's what I was trying to do. Why? Because that's what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; That's my responsibility. I wasn't trying to become rich. I was trying to feed my family. &gt;&gt; And I was barely doing that. I did janitor work. The minister had a janitor business. I washed people's floors. I washed their bathrooms. I washed their windows. That's this man. These two hands did that. I've never told you that before. And a man come down the stairs into that place before I got to leave. And he's looking around and I was just whistling and and the Holy Spirit said to me, "That's Mr. Roberts. I'd never seen him in my life. That's the president of the company. And after a few minutes, I walked over to him. I said, "Can I help you, sir?" He said, "I guess you don't know who I am." I said, "I think you're Mr. Roberts." He said, "That's exactly right." He said, "We're having a meeting, a staff meeting, and I'm going to cut this relatively short. We're having a staff meeting at 5:00 upstairs in the office. like you to be there. I understand you're doing a good job. I said, "Well, if the people are happy, that's fine." Most of the people in that company didn't even know my name. I was the kid downstairs. I was 25 or 26 years old. I was the kid downstairs. They didn't know my name. One or two did. I went up to the office. They said, "We're bidding on this big thing. Bidding on this huge liquidation. It was so large it took five months to sell out. Five months. It happened to be very, very, very expensive clothing. My wife's dad taught me something about cloth and clothing. And I, you know what? You talk about God. I was the only one that knew anything about clothing. In the first week, I was made manager of the sale. And the first second day, the president walked over and slipped $100 in my pocket. And the next day, he came over and slipped another hundred in my pocket. Was that a lot of money? Well, it was quite a bit of money then, but that wasn't what God was saying. And I I forgot all about that. I wasn't paying any attention to it. Just working hard, working long, doing all I can because I have a family and because I want to go to the native Indians and I always was supporting myself. I got one offering from someone up in northern Canada for $5. They sent me $5. That was it. I pastored the church for a long time and they sent me $5. That's just the way it was. That was life. All I can tell you, within two weeks, I was made manager of this entire sale and I was there five months selling it out in Vancouver. in here. I can take you to 744 Richard Street where I sold it out and we had robberies and we had everything else happen and so on. But I had the I had the attorney of that company say to me, "Our company made more money on this deal than we made since we were since we were uh since we were in a corporation in 1902 to that time 1961." And I had I had a I had made a con contact I should say brother Brandham made a contact with me in 1961. I have Billy Paul's letter in my study. Incidentally, I'm going to invite some of you young men to my home. I'm going to show you some of these things. I want you to see them. And Billy Paul, they they gotten my letter which I wrote a year and a half before. Just a few days ago, I had East Indian man in my home. He's 30. He said to me, "He's very, very successful here in this area. 30 years old, handsome, very fine. Jesus looked on a young man and loved him. I looked on this young man, I thought, what a fine young man you are. He said, I have an appointment, but Mr. Biscali said, "Can you please?" He said, "I I see how you handle things, how you conduct things. Can you please give me some words of wisdom?" I said, "Well, it'll be I really need more time than this." And I looked around. There's a little picture of Brother Brandham holding his Bible. Little picture of his home where he was born, holding his Bible. And I've shown it to a lot of people. I've said he is he looks just like that when he's under vision, under heavy anointing. His eyes are deep set and it was written by the full gospel businessman and I grabbed that picture behind glass and I held it up to this young man and I took it out which I don't often do and I took it out from the glass and it's written on there to brother Eddie. And as I open up the cover first I held it to him. I said, ' Do you see this? I said, ' Do you see this emblem up here? The full gospel Christian businessmen. I said, these are the elite wealthy businessmen in America. I said, I want you to see what they said. And I opened it up and it has an arrow. Brother Bram drew an arrow down and on the bottom it says this. By the editor, are you listening? In Bible days, there were prophets and seers of God, but none of them were greater than that of William Brham, who in the name of who is a prophet and seer of God and who in the name of Jesus has raised the dead. And I said, you read it and looked at it and read it. My said, raise the dead. I said, that's right. And doctor certificates to show that &gt;&gt; they were raised from the dead. I said, "I met this man." And I told him how I wrote the letter. And a year and a half later, I resigned the church and I moved down here to a place I never knew and went up and going to the native Indians. And I said, "Three weeks after I moved here, I got a letter from him, from Billy Paul. Then I got a a phone call. Then I got a letter and I said he probably gets a 100,000 letters a month and I said when I was writing it I said he'll never find this. And this young East Indian man said to me and I said I got a phone call from him. He said that was God. And I just ignored what he said and I carried on and he stopped again and he said that was God that he answered your letter. And I can tell you friends, he was smitten. Those were more than 10 words or a few words of wisdom that I could give him. He realized as he looked at that picture and read that little phrase, a man who's never ever heard of the message could say that was God. I hope to get to speak to him a little bit further. But I'll tell you what, congregation, you belong here to Bible way, you come here to church, I want to tell you something. This was founded by that God. This isn't something that some man dreamed up. &gt;&gt; This isn't something that some man had to pump the people or or try to, you know, get numbers or whatever more in spite of the enemy who tried to tear it to pieces. I said, "Oh, God, you're the preserver. &gt;&gt; You preserved us. &gt;&gt; You preserved my life. You preserved our home. You preserved this congregation. You preserved your lives. And all I say to you friends, the success is not being associated with the church or associated with the message. The success is what you do with your life in connection with his his revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In other words, this message &gt;&gt; I'll stop talking about myself just now. I want to talk about brother Dioa just for a moment. Have we got a few minutes? Brother Dioa, they they told me that when I was I was there, they said that uh Congo is the third poorest country on the globe and it has been first most poverty in Congo. And I I didn't know all I could see was presses running and the message being printed. And I said, "How many how many messages that year?" They printed 10.2 million. I said, "Where do you get your finance? Where do you Is it from the diamond industry or where I I'm trying to put things together?" "No, no, no." He said, "Even the children in Sunday school, give a give a few cents to print a message book." That was that man's answer. That that was printing 10.2 2 million messages sending it to 57 nations, French-speaking nations across across the earth. Brother Dio had never asked us for a penny. We wanted to help. We wanted to do something. He never asked for a penny. I saw here's a man. He just loves this message. You know what the difference is, friends? It comes down to my service today. come and see. &gt;&gt; He walked with him till he saw him. &gt;&gt; And you can do that. I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ. You walk with the author of this message. You walk with the author and the Bible will become an open book to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You walk with him and then you'll see him and you'll feel his heartbeat. And there's nothing on earth that can replace that. nothing on earth. &gt;&gt; God bless you and thank you for bearing with me. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Our Lord Jesus, my last words are to these people that there's nothing that can take their place. And I want to say to you, Lord Jesus, in front of this group of people, not so much the words that I felt to speak, but to convey the presence somehow, oh God, it can't be duplicated. I wouldn't try to generate that. But your presence and I hear your I hear your messenger say, I just try to yield. I just try to surrender myself and I say, "Oh God, help us to find that same channel. Help us. Help me, Lord, to just surrender myself. Help me, oh God, just to yield." And Father, I pray for a clear sight. I pray for the people, this people, and those that are perhaps streaming the service. Lord, let them not only come, but let them see. &gt;&gt; Let them have a clear vision of who it is that we're following. Oh God, for you're the one who has said, "As I live, so shall you live. Behold, I live, you shall live also." And your messenger said, speaking to his wife, "Oh God, we did not choose this. You brought it our way. We have not chosen. You found each one that is here sitting in the pews today. You found them wherever they are. Whatever state they were in, whatever country they were in, you found them. Some are here who have suffered atrocities, who have suffered such poverty, which have suffered great difficulty. You saw them, Lord. You did not keep us and hide us from all of those things. You've not promised us that we would have a necessarily an easy way, but you protected them. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, please glorify yourself. Take these lives, whatever there is left of it. Oh God, use it for your glory. Oh God, let the Holy Spirit challenge someone else. Oh father, take these young men I see here sitting here looking earnestly. Father, take them and let the Holy Spirit take something of this service and challenge their lives. Oh God, challenge them to a life of giving. Challenge them to a life of labor. Challenge them, oh God, I pray that they might say within themselves, I have strength. I have ability. I have certain things and I will lay it down at your feet. Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, I pray you'll take this work in this congregation and use it for your glory. Use us, oh God. Use us, &gt;&gt; Jesus. Use me, Jesus. Use us, I pray for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that song Jesus use me? Please Lord, don't refuse me. Surely there's a work that I can do. How many know the song Jesus use me? Yes. Yes. All right, let's stand for a second. Surely there can do my will to be great for you. Jesus hears me. There is a word that I can do [Music] is humble my will to crumble on the cross for you. While you're standing, I want you to repeat these words. Help my will to crumble. Will you say that with me? Help my will to crumble. Do you meant it? You mean it? Someday on the other side, you're going to say, "Brother Ed, thank you for that service. Thank you for that service. It helped it helped me to come to a &gt;&gt; a focus in my life. Help my will to crumble. Help my will to crumble. Though the cost be great, I'll work for you. Oh Jesus. [Music] Oh Lord. [Music] Surely the word that I can use. He is humble. Have my will to come be for you. We're going to sing it another time or two, but I'm praying that this one who walked with Cleopus [Music] will step in right beside you. and walk with you out of this building and that he'll stay and stick so close and that you can pour out all of your heart and your grief and all of your disappointment and say, "This isn't what I expected." You just keep talking to him. And the prophet of God said this, "If you'll talk about him, that's when he appears." And I want to encourage you, you talk about him. &gt;&gt; Don't talk about anything else. Don't talk about one another. Don't talk about your likes, your dislikes. Talk about him &gt;&gt; and he'll appear. &gt;&gt; He said he will appear. &gt;&gt; That makes life worthwhile. That means everything. I assure you in the name of Jesus Christ, the day will come when you need to hold someone's hand. You want to make sure it's his. Any hand here on earth is going to slip out of your out of your grasp and out of your reach. You want to make sure that you're able to hold his hand. I've held you in life. I've held you in trouble. I've held you in the good times and in the bad times. I found you're always there. and I believe in you with all my soul. &gt;&gt; Sing it again, please. [Music] Lord, don't refuse me. Great work that I can do. He will always help my will to crumble that cause the earth for you. I thank God for you. I thank God for you as a believer, as a Christian. I thank God for your life, each one of you. Brother Darren, I thank God for your tireless labor. I look on this note also the message hub update was just one on time to introduce to inform the believers in the introduction of the last camp service. Brother Darren, it was just in time at the last camp service that both Croatian, Serbian, and Slovakian languages are added to the latest website of messagehub application. This is a great thing for the believers in our country. For the first time, they pull a pull a prophet's message out of the sky and print it down. Listen friends, I'm not just taking up your time. I'm saying this is glorious. &gt;&gt; It's right here sitting on a on a pew in this congregation just now. Is it something unique? Have I ever spoken to brother Darren about it? Never have between him and God. &gt;&gt; God's a rewarder. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, well, I can't do that. I can't either. That doesn't mean I can't do something for God. It might be humble. God bless you. God bless you. [Music] Might say, "I'm weary." I said, "But I'm not tired of challenging you. [Music] Maybe I'd like to while we sing it once more time. One more time. Jesus, use me. Jesus, use me. I pray for this as a congregation that Jesus would use you. Hallelujah. Father, in the name of Jesus, as we come to the end of this service, we must close because Brother Tim, Sister Sarah must make their way down to Seattle and others may wish to go. But oh God, I pray that you'll take these words and take some statements and anchor them into the hearts of the people that make them make the statements unshakable, Lord. And perhaps they will find a place where they may just even remain if they wish to and bow down before you and say, "Oh Jesus, Jesus, use me. Whatever you'll do, let me use my energy and let me use, oh God, what you put into my hands and what you've put into my brain, help me to use it for your glory. Oh God, in this dark time, help me to be a light. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray your blessings upon this people, upon each individual according as their faith and belief is. Lord, I pray that as they as they walk out of this building, when they do, that you will walk with them. That they will only have a desire for a conversation with you. They will speak to you and realize that you are a living Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever. I ask your pe your peace to be upon them. May they depart in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Oh Jesus. [Music] Oh Lord, don't resist me. the word that I can do. He always [Music] help my will to crumble the costly rain for you. As you stand here, you may wonder where where are miracles happening. I'll tell you as a minister, as a pastor, I tell you there's a mighty mighty there's been a mighty breath of God, brother Jean, nice to see you. I bless you. We had a wedding yesterday. Brother John Waldner, one of you just look up at me. Father John, you were sitting here some months ago, long time ago, not too ter long ago. Your face was a glow with the glory of God. I didn't know who you were. [Music] And I leaned over so I could get a better look at you. is what going on in a normal service. And I said to myself, I think that is Mike and Helen Walder's son. [Music] And the glory of God was on here. And I didn't know what what was happening. Found God. But as I said to you yesterday, your father was struck by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; as he walked in the streets of Vancouver in the darkest of time. But God smoked his heart. And I see that God reignited things within the whole family. and Sister Helen, Brother Mike, it was a blessed time to sit at the table with you yesterday. And I was so glad that the Holy Spirit had an opportunity to somehow get a hold of your son's heart and then to stand there. I'm saying standing here the lights are out and you're shining a light so brother John can continue with the wedding uniting your your sister to her husband. Oh my friends, it's not just an empty wedding service. Sister Biscll said to me, I see John holding that light there. He's not too far from the pullpit. I said, that's exactly right. I say God anoints men and women. God anoint us for our purpose here on earth. &gt;&gt; Your purpose is not just to come to church next Sunday or next Wednesday. It's far beyond that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Matthew Redell. It just came back from Ohio from the state fair. They said they looked at what was happening at the Lynen fair said we want to do that. He went there to help them and to organize the people. And I say, God bless the more people can pour out. Brother Murphy's in China and Tom's in the Congo and Michael is there and brethren are going. Brother Tim's been asked someplace and all I say is let's burn ourselves out. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let me burn my life out. Jesus, &gt;&gt; use me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Just obey the Lord. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, [Music] hey. [Music] Heat. Heat.
