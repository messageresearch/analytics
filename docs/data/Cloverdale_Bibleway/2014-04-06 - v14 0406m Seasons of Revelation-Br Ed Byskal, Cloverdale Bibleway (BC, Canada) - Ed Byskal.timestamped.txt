[0:01] I trust in you
[0:05] [Music]
[0:10] that I see through
[0:15] this we
[0:19] [Music]
[0:29] will guide
[0:33] the unseen.
[0:35] [Music]
[0:42] I look back on history,
[0:46] seen a mighty God
[0:49] unveil.
[0:51] He's been proving
[0:53] for and
[0:55] that his word can never.
[1:01] [Music]
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now.
[1:08] [Music]
[1:10] Oh, Jesus.
[1:14] Oh, and he's living
[1:21] the same God.
[1:23] [Music]
[1:29] the same
[1:33] [Music]
[1:36] to
[1:39] the God
[1:41] who are in the rain
[1:45] with me.
[1:48] [Music]
[1:56] He's the same God.
[1:59] The same God
[2:00] [Music]
[2:05] and all the earth
[2:08] came back to Jesus.
[2:12] There is power.
[2:15] [Music]
[2:16] But now here is the day I see I begin
[2:23] to see
[2:26] [Music]
[2:27] the same
[2:29] [Music]
[2:46] Heat. Heat.
[2:48] [Music]
[2:56] Amazing.
[2:58] [Music]
[3:03] [Music]
[3:06] this morning.
[3:11] [Applause]
[3:12] [Music]
[3:22] Say God
[3:24] wondering
[3:30] [Music]
[3:41] the savior.
[3:50] Hallelujah. That's our declaration this
[3:52] morning, Lord. We believe that you're
[3:54] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[3:58] We're standing on that word, Lord. We're
[4:00] believing it, Lord.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Number 188. Oh, what a
[4:16] friend.
[4:22] Oh, what a friend
[4:28] who was beside me
[4:32] [Music]
[4:34] to hold my hand
[4:37] [Music]
[4:39] and save me.
[4:47] [Music]
[4:50] He always
[4:54] [Music]
[5:04] goes away.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; He goes away.
[5:11] I know is
[5:17] he
[5:19] [Music]
[5:21] my
[5:25] [Music]
[5:38] My friend
[5:41] [Music]
[5:43] is to me. You know it. Just lift up your
[5:47] hand.
[5:49] [Music]
[5:50] He knows the way. I know.
[5:58] He
[6:03] my
[6:05] [Music]
[6:21] [Music]
[6:27] &gt;&gt; real sweetly Now, oh what
[6:31] [Music]
[6:35] beside me
[6:40] hold my hand
[6:44] and safely
[6:46] guide me.
[6:48] [Music]
[6:55] You always
[6:58] [Music]
[7:05] he
[7:07] to me.
[7:09] [Music]
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You love him this
[7:17] morning
[7:18] &gt;&gt; with all your heart.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Serving him with all your might.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many served him 50% this week?
[7:25] Just you've given him 50%.
[7:29] Praise God. 100% participation. How many
[7:32] have served him with all your heart,
[7:34] &gt;&gt; all your mind, all your soul, all your
[7:37] strength? If we were under the law, we'd
[7:40] all be miserable. We'd be failures. But
[7:42] his grace, oh, it's extended past where
[7:46] we could reach. He's done more for us,
[7:48] friends,
[7:49] &gt;&gt; than we can do for him.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; And he still loves us. Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[7:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a number of prayer
[7:56] requests to read together this morning.
[7:59] Couple of specials. Our pastor is going
[8:01] to be coming and speaking this morning.
[8:04] I don't know his title, but I know what
[8:06] my heart's crying for.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord knows what your heart's
[8:11] crying for this morning. That's exactly
[8:13] what he's going to speak. Isn't that
[8:15] wonderful?
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that encouraging? A God that knows
[8:18] exactly
[8:21] &gt;&gt; what you need and your neighbor needs.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; The person across the aisle, the person
[8:25] behind you.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; We don't have to have a pitchfork
[8:27] religion. Oh, that's for them. Hope they
[8:30] caught it. Turn around to check.
[8:33] We don't have to live like that.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; How many people know somebody that's not
[8:38] a believer that's miserable?
[8:42] I mean, seriously, searching. They go to
[8:44] church,
[8:45] &gt;&gt; searching, troubled,
[8:48] &gt;&gt; scared,
[8:49] &gt;&gt; bewildered. Why is fill in the blank?
[8:52] This happening, that happening. Why
[8:54] isn't my church doing this? Why isn't my
[8:56] church doing that?
[8:58] And you say, "God, open their eyes."
[9:02] We have the tree of life literally in
[9:06] our presence.
[9:07] [Music]
[9:08] &gt;&gt; But you can't make them eat any more
[9:10] than I can make them eat. But you just
[9:13] say, "Lord, let my light so shine
[9:15] &gt;&gt; in this dark age that people would want
[9:18] to be where you're sitting."
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[9:25] Brother Ernie, just ask you to come and
[9:27] pray after I read these requests.
[9:30] Brother Murphy has a request for a
[9:33] sister in Shenzhen, China. She asked the
[9:36] church to pray for a mom who had stomach
[9:39] cancer now spread to her spine. She
[9:42] believes the Lord can heal her through
[9:44] the prayer of the saints. Amen. So, we
[9:47] want to remember that need this morning.
[9:49] Brother Tom Frey asked that we remember
[9:52] his dad in prayer. He is in a condition
[9:54] which which affects his ability to
[9:57] swallow, speak, and breathe as well. He
[9:59] is not saved. He is almost 83 years old.
[10:02] I told him that we would be praying and
[10:04] I'm asking God to save him and to show
[10:07] himself in this condition by touching
[10:09] him physically as well. Amen. Brother
[10:12] Tom, we can agree and pray with you this
[10:14] morning.
[10:17] Uh, Sister Violet Laws has an unspoken
[10:19] request that she would like us to pray
[10:22] over as well this morning. Brother
[10:24] Richard Drake asked us to pray for John
[10:26] Drake. He fell last Wednesday and has
[10:29] hurt his neck. While doctors were
[10:32] investigating that injury, they
[10:33] discovered a growth at the top of his
[10:35] neck by the skull and they feel it is
[10:37] not cancerous but it is uh placing a lot
[10:41] of pressure on the nerves and he is in a
[10:43] lot of pain. Brother John is believing
[10:45] for total healing. Amen. We can as well.
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] Uh this is from sister Victoria Adamora.
[10:56] uh she wants to mention the passing away
[10:58] of her mother who will be uh buried in
[11:01] May on May the 2nd. Thank you for your
[11:03] continued prayers. Though in sorrow, the
[11:05] joy of the Lord has been my lasting
[11:08] strength and will continue to be. Thank
[11:10] you for all the words of comfort, the
[11:12] support, the empathy received from many.
[11:14] I may not know how to physically express
[11:16] my gratitude. However, you are all
[11:19] wonderful and have shown the love of
[11:21] Jesus Christ to mourn with those that
[11:23] mourn and rejoice with those that
[11:25] rejoice in every little way. That means
[11:28] so much to me. Thank you so much and God
[11:31] bless you each and everyone. Amen. God
[11:34] bless you, Sister Victoria. Amen. If you
[11:36] have an unspoken need upon your heart
[11:38] this morning, maybe you just want to
[11:40] slip your hand up to the Lord and say,
[11:42] "Lord, I didn't write it down, but you
[11:44] know what's written on the tablets of my
[11:46] heart. If the deacons can come as well
[11:48] this morning, ask brother Ernie to pray
[11:50] over the offering. Amen. God bless you,
[11:54] brother Ernie.
[11:58] God bless your saints. Like to just give
[12:00] a quick testimony. My mom has uh has
[12:03] battled cancer for several years and
[12:05] just recently they found a little spot
[12:07] on her lung and she had to go through a
[12:11] series of chemo treatments and her
[12:14] birthday was on March the 29th. And when
[12:16] I called her, she told me and I knew
[12:19] something was different in her voice
[12:21] because I had spoken to her about four
[12:22] days ago and she wasn't real bright and
[12:25] wasn't real uh, you know, real on top of
[12:28] things. But when I called her on her
[12:30] birthday, she told me that the doctor
[12:32] had put her on a new medication and her
[12:35] testimony was, "I'm 85, but I feel like
[12:37] I'm 55." So, uh, I'm so thankful for
[12:41] that and I know many saints have have
[12:43] prayed and I appreciate so much the the
[12:46] the supernatural touch that God has
[12:48] given to her. So, let's pray.
[12:55] Father, to say that we are a blessed
[12:57] people would be the greatest
[12:58] understatement that a man could ever
[13:01] speak. Truly Lord, you have known us
[13:05] before the foundation of the world and
[13:08] predestinated us to be here at this time
[13:11] at the closing seconds of time. Father,
[13:14] as we see world events rapidly taking
[13:17] place, we see prophecies that Jesus
[13:20] spoke. We see them coming into
[13:22] manifestation quickly. We see prophecies
[13:25] that our prophet spoke about Russia and
[13:28] and about all the things that are taking
[13:30] place in the world. We see everything
[13:32] just lining up so perfectly, Father. And
[13:35] we want to line up perfectly with your
[13:37] word.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are we are in the midst of a of
[13:40] a spiritual evolution that has brought
[13:43] about a revolution. And this inspiration
[13:47] that's come from this revelation,
[13:48] Father, is lifting us up into realms and
[13:51] spheres and domains that we've never
[13:54] known before. Lord, how thrilled we are
[13:58] when we read your word and to know that
[14:00] we are a part of that word and that you
[14:03] have a plan for us throughout all of
[14:05] eternity, Lord. That throughout all of
[14:07] eternity, we'll never be bored. We'll be
[14:09] continually learning about your your
[14:12] wonders and your glory. And Lord, now we
[14:15] want to turn to the prayer requests that
[14:17] were pinned down first of all for this
[14:21] sister in China that brother Murphy has
[14:23] spoken about. And Lord, how many times
[14:26] have we heard a prophet has spoken
[14:29] cancer out of existence, that demon that
[14:32] has afflicted a person? And how many
[14:35] times through throughout our own
[14:37] experience have we heard how God has
[14:39] moved upon this scene, even in my own
[14:41] mother's life? Father, we just pray that
[14:43] you would move upon that sister's life.
[14:46] God, pray that faith would rise up in
[14:48] her life that she would be able to claim
[14:51] every one of the redemptive blessings of
[14:53] the resurrection.
[14:55] Lord, we pray for Sister Victoria
[14:57] Adamore, Lord, at the passing of her
[15:00] mom. We pray that you would give her a
[15:03] supernatural touch, Lord. Pray that you
[15:06] would give her a peace that passes all
[15:08] understanding and a peace that comes
[15:10] even in the midst of a storm, Lord. And
[15:13] we're so thankful that we don't sorrow
[15:15] as others sorrow, Lord. For we know and
[15:18] we have a promise that we're going to
[15:19] see our loved ones that are redeemed on
[15:22] the other side. Lord, we pray for this
[15:25] unspoken prayer request for Sister
[15:27] Violet Laws. Pray that whatever it is
[15:30] that you would accomplish it for her and
[15:32] do it quickly. Lord, our precious sister
[15:35] has been so faithful. Lord, bless her, I
[15:38] pray. And Lord, we also pray for for
[15:41] brother John Drake. Lord, what a
[15:44] blessing that that he and his family
[15:46] were to me when I first came to
[15:48] Cloverdale. I just pray that that you
[15:51] would be able to have the doctors
[15:53] quickly discern with supernatural wisdom
[15:57] the direction that they would go in his
[16:00] treatment.
[16:02] I pray that you would raise them up,
[16:03] God. Take the take the pain away. take
[16:06] whatever is is going on in this body and
[16:10] Lord, I pray that you would just move it
[16:12] away. Give him strength, Father, to
[16:14] overcome this challenge.
[16:17] And Lord, we
[16:21] are just so in anticipation and
[16:24] expectation of what you're going to do
[16:27] in the midst of of us today. Lord, we
[16:30] pray for our pastor as he comes to bring
[16:32] the word. Bless him, God. inspire him.
[16:36] Lift him up into that channel, Lord,
[16:38] that you would have him to be. Let Let
[16:42] each one of us, Lord, take our lick of
[16:44] fire and let it shine, Lord. Let it
[16:47] shine brightly. Let us pull from that
[16:49] word. Every bit that you have for us,
[16:51] every bit of revelation, Father, let us
[16:54] soak it up. Let us absorb it, Lord. Let
[16:57] us internalize it and metabolize it.
[16:59] Father, that we may raise up into that
[17:02] super church that you said that we would
[17:04] be. Lord, we ask all these blessings for
[17:07] we've asked them in your precious and
[17:10] holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[17:13] Amen.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you have your seats?
[17:19] The deacons receive the offering this
[17:21] morning.
[17:24] We want to welcome each and everyone
[17:26] that's here with us this morning. Those
[17:28] on the telephone internet and on the on
[17:32] the telephone hookup and on the
[17:33] internet, we certainly want to greet you
[17:35] as well.
[17:39] Why don't we sing uh victory in Jesus
[17:42] number 777
[17:44] as they're taking up the offering.
[17:47] If you're visiting here with us, uh
[17:48] who's visiting this morning? Maybe you
[17:50] can just lift up your hand. Got a
[17:52] visitor over here. God bless you this
[17:54] morning. Amen. Why don't we give him a
[17:56] warm welcome?
[17:58] Praise God.
[18:03] Amen. If you're not visiting here with
[18:05] us, just trust that you
[18:08] enjoy the service this morning. Amen.
[18:10] We've got a special I think Sister
[18:13] Brianna Dingwall is going to sing for us
[18:15] and then just after she's done singing,
[18:19] Brother Ryan and Andrew and Brother
[18:22] Daniel right here. You're going to come
[18:23] up and sing for us. So, we'll just uh
[18:26] try and get the specials in this
[18:27] morning. You've been singing really
[18:28] good, but we'll enjoy a couple specials,
[18:31] too. All right. Praise the Lord. Why
[18:33] don't we sing the first verse?
[18:36] I heard an old story how
[18:43] glory
[18:46] on
[18:49] the rest
[18:52] I
[18:56] [Music]
[19:02] see
[19:04] the victory. Heat. Heat.
[19:15] Heat. Heat.
[19:21] [Music]
[19:25] and all
[19:28] to him
[19:31] to
[19:32] [Music]
[19:34] the
[19:36] Imus.
[19:39] [Music]
[19:54] Heat. Heat.
[19:58] [Music]
[20:04] Heat. Heat.
[20:11] [Music]
[20:14] Heat. Heat.
[20:20] [Music]
[20:25] and our
[20:27] [Music]
[20:31] victory.
[20:34] [Music]
[20:55] [Music]
[21:16] As you sing
[21:20] with angels near,
[21:24] Do you know
[21:28] that he is here?
[21:31] Will you turn him away unnoticed?
[21:36] Will you close your heart in coldness?
[21:40] What is it that has brought us together?
[21:48] My friend, this could be the only day
[21:52] you have left to lift your voice in
[21:56] praise to tell him
[21:59] all he means to you.
[22:04] So reach out your hands to Jesus.
[22:09] Don't let him pass you by.
[22:13] Reach your voice and praise him.
[22:17] Halleluah.
[22:20] Don't let him leave unwelcomed
[22:24] with dirty feet once more.
[22:29] Praise his name. Constrain him to stay
[22:32] while you're here in the presence of the
[22:36] Lord.
[22:41] And like our brothers
[22:45] headed to Emmas,
[22:47] [Music]
[22:49] when he made to go on,
[22:53] they constrain him to stay.
[22:57] And like our sister,
[23:00] he was dirty and unwelcomed.
[23:05] Fell down and worshiped.
[23:08] and you washed my Savior's feet.
[23:12] So my friend, just let go of your flesh.
[23:16] God wants a sacrifice of praise. Won't
[23:20] you worship and adore him today?
[23:27] So reach out your hands to Jesus.
[23:31] Don't let him pass you by.
[23:35] Lift up your voice and praise him.
[23:40] Halleluah.
[23:43] Don't let him leave unwelcome
[23:47] with dirty feet once more.
[23:51] Praise his name. Constrain him to stay
[23:54] while you're here in the presence of the
[23:59] Lord.
[24:03] Soon there will come a day every knee
[24:07] will bow, every tongue will stay.
[24:11] While you are here today, don't take
[24:14] this moment for granted
[24:19] to reach out your hands to Jesus.
[24:23] Don't let him pass you by.
[24:27] Lift up your voice and praise him.
[24:32] Halleluah.
[24:35] Don't let him leave unwelcome
[24:38] with dirty feet once more.
[24:43] Praise his name. Constrain him to stay
[24:46] while you're here in the presence of the
[24:50] Lord.
[24:54] Reach out your hands to Jesus.
[24:58] Don't let him pass you by.
[25:01] Lift up your voice and praise him.
[25:06] Halleluah.
[25:09] Don't let him leave unwelcome
[25:13] with dirty feet once more.
[25:17] Praise his name. Constrain him to stay
[25:20] while you're here in his presence.
[25:25] Praise his name. constrain him to stay
[25:28] while you're here
[25:30] in the presence of the Lord.
[25:40] [Music]
[25:46] [Applause]
[25:52] Brother Daniel and those are coming and
[25:53] the children are coming in. Why don't we
[25:55] sing together? Touching Jesus is all
[25:57] that really matters. You remember
[25:59] brother Tom in your prayers this week.
[26:01] He's ministering down at brother Jason
[26:03] Jackson's in Hardy, Arkansas. Brother
[26:06] Kyle's ministering from Victoria today.
[26:09] Brother John, I believe, is taking the
[26:10] service down in Seattle tonight. Brother
[26:13] Tim will be ministering here. Amen. We
[26:15] just want a wonderful time in God's
[26:17] presence. Amen.
[26:22] Touching Jesus
[26:24] is all that matters.
[26:31] And your life will never be
[26:35] the same.
[26:39] And there's only
[26:42] one way to touch him.
[26:47] and just believe
[26:50] [Music]
[26:52] his name.
[26:55] Jesus
[26:59] is all that we
[27:06] [Music]
[27:10] [Applause]
[27:14] only
[27:18] touch.
[27:21] That's just
[27:23] where you are.
[27:26] What is his name?
[27:29] [Music]
[27:38] [Music]
[27:58] I see again
[28:02] the sun rising up,
[28:08] darkness disappearing.
[28:12] The skies are shining.
[28:17] It's another
[28:19] day,
[28:21] [Music]
[28:22] another
[28:24] year.
[28:25] [Music]
[28:27] It's time to remember
[28:32] your goodness to me.
[28:36] for your wondrous

[33:37] come this morning, why don't we stand
[33:39] together?
[33:41] I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice.
[33:46] Thank you for that special, Brother
[33:48] Daniel. He sings good on his birthday,
[33:50] doesn't he? He sings good every other
[33:53] day of the year, but today just happens
[33:54] to be his birthday. I bless you, Brother
[33:56] Daniel.

[36:34] Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[36:38] &gt;&gt; He is indeed. So nice to see you all
[36:42] here this morning. And
[36:45] I'm sure that you are here not just to
[36:48] uh
[36:50] attend a service but to be part of a
[36:52] service
[36:54] &gt;&gt; to participate, be a part of it. If it
[36:57] weren't for you, we wouldn't be having
[36:59] much of a service.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; So I want to thank you for coming. Thank
[37:04] you for your prayers and would ask you
[37:05] to be an expectation.
[37:11] Uh
[37:13] I looking for my grandson Nathan and his
[37:18] wife Crystal are here and I'm so happy
[37:22] &gt;&gt; to have them.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[37:27] So thankfully you came, brother Nathan,
[37:30] Christelle and their little one.
[37:34] And it's amazing really. I got uh I got
[37:37] a very long email from for the first
[37:41] time for very many many many years from
[37:46] my nephew,
[37:48] my sister Sharon who lives on Vancouver
[37:52] Island from her son. He's a teacher.
[37:55] He's actually vice principal in a school
[37:58] in South Korea
[38:01] and uh I got a long email from him this
[38:04] morning and he was addressing the time
[38:07] he lived with us. He lived he and his
[38:10] brother Michael they lived with us for a
[38:13] year in the early days of Bible way
[38:17] and uh so he was just addressing a
[38:19] couple things. I haven't read it
[38:21] thoroughly, but he was uh I I think that
[38:25] they want to promote him up to principal
[38:27] and wanted, you know, so he was giving
[38:30] his background in history. And he said,
[38:34] I I referred to I'm sending it to you
[38:36] because I referred to the time we lived
[38:39] with you. And while I don't adhere or
[38:43] follow to those things, but yet he
[38:45] remained very uh very religious in that
[38:49] he even uh sought to become a a priest
[38:52] in one of the denominational churches
[38:54] and that never happened. and he went
[38:56] into the into the education
[38:59] and uh somehow I gathered that he felt
[39:03] we were anti-education
[39:06] and uh I I thought my if he were here
[39:09] today he would certainly he he perceived
[39:12] he said I was 12 years old at that time
[39:14] but he said I I was very impressed he's
[39:17] writing this for other people he said I
[39:19] was very very impressed
[39:21] he said there was amongst that group
[39:25] There was a person that was very very
[39:28] ill and they had to have emergency uh
[39:32] surgery within I think he said 6 days
[39:36] and the in the person came and and the
[39:40] elders prayed for her and she went back
[39:43] to the doctor and it wasn't there
[39:46] anymore.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; And so he said I was very impressed with
[39:50] that. I guess I would be too.
[39:54] I'm still impressed.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; I'm still impressed with the living God.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you impressed?
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. While I was in the middle of
[40:07] my studies
[40:10] uh yesterday,
[40:12] I just want to make reference to brother
[40:15] Vio and Sister Marlin. see them sitting
[40:17] here because I just in the middle of my
[40:20] studies and sometimes things happen that
[40:23] are from another realm and I'll be
[40:25] speaking about that and uh and the
[40:28] presence of God just came
[40:31] came surrounded me and I I was seeing
[40:34] things in the word and I thought and and
[40:37] bringing it all present to the very
[40:39] present moment and uh
[40:43] and it was just like all my mind is just
[40:45] pregnantated did everything at once and
[40:47] says, "Vio and Marlin need to hear
[40:50] this." And and that was so direct. I
[40:54] reached for my phone without even
[40:56] knowing what I was doing. I reached for
[40:58] my phone and text brother Vio and he
[41:02] text me back and I'm just happy that
[41:05] you're here, Brother Vio. I don't know.
[41:07] It might just be a phrase. I don't know
[41:09] what it is. I would ask that the
[41:12] congregation very reverent if you would
[41:14] and please have as little movement as
[41:16] possible. Would you do that?
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Now we'll pray together. We're done with
[41:20] the singing. Thank you.
[41:24] Our gracious
[41:26] and loving and caring heavenly father.
[41:31] When I think of your prophet
[41:34] and the pillar of fire and visitation in
[41:37] that ministry,
[41:39] &gt;&gt; he referred to it sometimes as a gift.
[41:42] He referred to himself as a servant of
[41:45] God, other times a prophet of God. And
[41:48] we know that he was the prophet
[41:50] messenger that you sent because
[41:52] scriptures have been fulfilled. And we
[41:55] are in an incredible moment in our time,
[41:58] Lord. And I pray that we will not miss
[42:01] what's happening. Uh let us not be uh
[42:04] slow. Oh God, let us not be as those on
[42:08] the way to Emmas. Oh God, but yet let us
[42:11] be like them in that you stayed with
[42:13] them. You stayed with them. You were so
[42:16] insistent and persistent that you're
[42:18] going to bring them into the revelation
[42:20] of the secret of the tabernacle of God.
[42:22] So I pray that you will bless this
[42:24] congregation. We've come here, Lord, for
[42:26] a purpose. And I pray that you'll bless
[42:28] all that may be uh streaming this
[42:31] morning, Father, from whatever land and
[42:33] whoever may hear it later. I pray you'll
[42:36] bless them.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Father, anoint me and let me be a
[42:41] servant of Christ for your people today.
[42:44] I pray, Father, that they in tune will
[42:46] be ready to receive from you, from
[42:49] another realm, from another place. In
[42:52] the name of Jesus Christ, we commit
[42:54] every soul into your care and into your
[42:58] keeping for your glory alone, Lord
[43:01] Jesus. Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:04] I want to uh I want to speak to you on
[43:09] uh this subject, seasons of revelation.
[43:15] And uh I will read you can turn to
[43:18] Ecclesiastes the third chapter if you
[43:21] would please. Ecclesiastes is just
[43:24] immediately after Proverbs
[43:27] the third chapter.
[43:29] We'll read verses 1 down through 8. And
[43:33] then I'm going to read Genesis 1 and 14
[43:36] the one verse.
[43:46] Now, just so that you can get a capsule
[43:50] of kind of where I want to go, I want to
[43:54] I will be making references to the
[43:56] season of the word becoming flesh, which
[43:59] was the son of man, Jesus Christ as the
[44:04] son of man in a prophetic ministry.
[44:08] And how that that season
[44:11] uh that the world began to be impacted
[44:14] by another world
[44:18] uh unseen world
[44:20] &gt;&gt; things were happening for the first time
[44:22] in history. Yes.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Uh through the life of Jesus Christ as
[44:27] he revealed himself as a son of man.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; And uh and then the season of the
[44:34] indwelling Holy Spirit of God into a
[44:37] people.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; A selected people and that became the
[44:42] season of the son of God.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; So we will begin to read please.
[44:48] To everything there is a season and a
[44:51] time to every purpose under the heaven.
[44:54] A time to be born and a time to die. A
[44:57] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[45:00] that which is planted. A time to kill
[45:03] and a time to heal. A time to break down
[45:07] and a time to build up. A time to weep
[45:09] and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and
[45:12] a time to dance. A time to cast away
[45:16] stones and a time to gather stones
[45:18] together. A time to embrace and a time
[45:20] to refrain from embracing. A time to get
[45:24] and a time to lose. A time to keep and a
[45:27] time
[45:29] just a moment.
[45:31] A time to cast away.
[45:34] A time to rent and a time to sow. A time
[45:37] to keep sustenance and a time to speak.
[45:40] A time to love and a time to hate. a
[45:43] time of war and a time of peace. In
[45:47] Genesis 1 and14 says this
[45:53] and I have taken
[45:56] five items, five words or sentences,
[46:00] phrases out of this scripture. And God
[46:03] said, "Let there be lights in the
[46:06] firmament of the heaven." Two, number
[46:09] one, divide the day from the night.
[46:14] and then to let them be for signs
[46:19] and for seasons
[46:21] &gt;&gt; and for days
[46:23] &gt;&gt; and years.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[46:34] In natural life, we experience
[46:39] and are familiar with seasons. we have
[46:42] and I won't spend a lot of time on this
[46:44] but I'm just going to briefly there are
[46:47] seasons
[46:49] you know there are seasons of spring and
[46:51] summer and fall and we we experience
[46:54] those seasons
[46:57] Apostle Paul said and I'm moving very
[46:59] quickly through this Apostle Paul said
[47:03] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[47:07] understood as a child I thought as a
[47:10] child but when I became a man. I put
[47:12] away childish things.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Uh he he wasn't saying I hated what I
[47:17] was when I was a child. No, that was all
[47:20] part of his life.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; But when I was a child, I spake as a
[47:24] child. I thought as a child, I did
[47:27] things as a child. When I became a man,
[47:29] I put away childish things. He was in a
[47:31] different season of life. That's right.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; They've had a lot of studies and I won't
[47:37] even begin to try to approach the
[47:41] subject of the season of childhood and
[47:44] then the season of adolescence
[47:47] because there's an awful lot said about
[47:49] from adolescence to adulthood
[47:53] &gt;&gt; and uh
[47:56] we could spend a whole lot of time on
[47:58] that and I think that today they seek to
[48:00] keep people within adolescence or in
[48:03] almost childhood mentally
[48:06] uh when they should be coming into
[48:08] adulthood. But they've done a lot of
[48:10] studies and there was a a professor of
[48:13] uh of psychology I believe it was and he
[48:17] interviewed 300 young people ages 18 to
[48:22] 29 in cities many cities
[48:26] uh across the United States I think
[48:28] largely or maybe throughout the world I
[48:30] do not know but he was asking them
[48:33] questions about what they wanted out of
[48:36] life in this study.
[48:39] And despite the differences of their
[48:41] backgrounds, this gentleman's name was
[48:43] Arnett, he was struck by the similar
[48:47] answers he heard from his young
[48:50] respondents.
[48:52] They shared a perception of feeling.
[48:55] They all they shared a perception of
[48:58] feeling in between. they're in between
[49:02] something knowing that they were pulling
[49:04] clear of the struggles of adolescence
[49:08] and starting to feel responsible for
[49:11] themselves
[49:12] but still closely tied to their parents
[49:15] and family. And so this presented them
[49:18] with a struggle that like I'm in
[49:20] between. I'm I feel for my family. I
[49:23] feel close to my family. I have a love
[49:25] for, you know, mother, father, whatever
[49:27] more. and and yet I've got to reach out
[49:30] here and and start paddling my own
[49:32] canoe. And uh they also reported
[49:37] pondering their personal identity.
[49:40] Arnet proposed a new period of lifespan
[49:44] development he calls and he coined the
[49:47] phrase emerging adulthood.
[49:52] and he coined that term in his book and
[49:55] his book is entitled Emerging Adulthood
[49:59] and I guess he refers to the winding
[50:02] road from the late teens
[50:05] through the 20s.
[50:08] So you can see men of stature and men of
[50:13] welleducated and men who teach others.
[50:16] They're always trying to understand and
[50:19] and figure out a better way. And uh and
[50:23] because it's very very important. We've
[50:24] got a lot of uh youth and young people
[50:27] here. We have we have those that are
[50:29] children. We have those that are
[50:31] adolesccents. We have those that are
[50:33] young men, young ladies, uh, reaching
[50:35] out and and finding their own way.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; And God has a way. God has a plan
[50:41] &gt;&gt; for everyone who commits their life to
[50:44] God. But you must understand also that
[50:46] the world is opposed to that pathway and
[50:50] that direction. And so there's come all
[50:53] kinds a myriad of distractions and
[50:56] things to uh draw a person aside. We all
[51:01] experience the unexpected.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; all of us do.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; We experience the unexpected. The
[51:08] passage of life from the season of
[51:10] adolescence to adulthood
[51:13] cannot be defined or placed into any
[51:17] specific order because we're all uh on
[51:21] on this journey together. And yet we're
[51:24] very very much individuals
[51:27] and our life and background and future
[51:30] is all unique to ourselves
[51:32] &gt;&gt; as individuals and yet we share a lot of
[51:36] things in common
[51:37] &gt;&gt; and spiritually we certainly do because
[51:39] it's the body of Christ
[51:43] &gt;&gt; but the season of childhood of
[51:45] adolescence and adulthood does indeed
[51:48] come to each one of us. I'm staying
[51:52] fairly close to my notes because I just
[51:54] I want to uh desperately can have
[51:57] continuity so you can follow with me.
[52:01] Brother Brandham refers to the season of
[52:03] immortal life
[52:07] and I would like to I'd like to just
[52:09] jump way way forward and bring something
[52:12] that I think is very striking that I've
[52:14] pondered for a lot of time a lot of
[52:17] years. You've heard me refer to the last
[52:19] four messages of brother Brandham. I
[52:22] don't think it's just last four
[52:23] messages.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I believe because he was an instrument
[52:27] and a tabernacle through which God was
[52:29] going to speak certain things that he
[52:32] had never said before
[52:34] &gt;&gt; and would not repeat again.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And he's not going to send another
[52:38] messenger to say, "I want to remind you
[52:40] about this."
[52:42] In other words, you have heard it
[52:46] &gt;&gt; and we need and and one of the things
[52:48] that really is uh striking to me is that
[52:51] the disciples and the people of the
[52:53] scripture, even when God was
[52:55] tabernacled, the fullness of the Godhead
[52:59] bodily in Jesus Christ, they were
[53:02] missing it. Yes.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And you have to say, how do educated
[53:08] people, how do leaders, how do people
[53:12] who spiritually spend their entire life
[53:15] studying the Torah or the Bible of that
[53:17] day? How do they miss this?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; How come it doesn't come through?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; How come something doesn't grip them? Or
[53:27] maybe does it grip them and there's too
[53:30] much distraction or too much uh they're
[53:32] consumed too much with this world
[53:35] &gt;&gt; to fail to catch that world.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And so he talks about this in the
[53:43] testimony of a true witness.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I let me just go back a
[53:49] step. I was just saying that the last
[53:51] four messages and when when the prophet
[53:54] of God now comes with in December the
[53:57] 4th 65 and he speaks the rapture.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And he says things in there he never
[54:02] said before. He talks about the order of
[54:05] the rapture,
[54:06] &gt;&gt; the great order,
[54:08] &gt;&gt; the shout
[54:09] &gt;&gt; and the voice
[54:11] &gt;&gt; and the trumpet.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; And then he says this message that is
[54:15] the shout
[54:17] &gt;&gt; and he was just finalizing the shout.
[54:19] Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe uh six or eight more hours
[54:23] &gt;&gt; and then those lips are going to be
[54:25] sealed forever.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; No man's going to hear them again like
[54:29] that. And then to have that vessel
[54:32] speaking and saying, "That's not me
[54:35] speaking. That's my voice, but that's
[54:37] not me speaking."
[54:39] &gt;&gt; And to have him say, "Uh, now I'm
[54:42] repeating this not to preach. I'm here
[54:45] to testify to you that I have been
[54:47] profoundly affected by these words and
[54:50] phrases
[54:52] &gt;&gt; uh standing in front of a person uh than
[54:55] to demonstrate Jesus Christ exactly as
[54:58] he did on earth
[54:59] &gt;&gt; or to demonstrate the one who met
[55:02] Abraham in chapter 18 of Genesis and
[55:04] turned his back and spoke of his wife
[55:08] Sarah knew her name and and said that I
[55:11] will surely return unto you according to
[55:13] the time of life and Sarah thy wife
[55:15] shall have a son and that one and he
[55:18] said and and then to have a vessel
[55:20] standing here in front of us in our age
[55:22] and say I'll turn my back
[55:25] &gt;&gt; what what's happening friends what is
[55:27] that
[55:29] &gt;&gt; you know the this world is going to be
[55:31] held responsible for that act
[55:34] &gt;&gt; and to say what were you thinking when
[55:36] that was happening
[55:38] &gt;&gt; who did you think that was
[55:40] &gt;&gt; and now he chooses a scripture he
[55:42] chooses scripture for the rapture
[55:45] message which happens to be uh Psalms
[55:48] 27. It's a strange scripture but the
[55:51] last verse of his scripture reading was
[55:54] verse 5. For in the time of trouble
[55:59] &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And if there ever was a people or a time
[56:06] of trouble,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; it's today. Amen.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And if you if you don't have him to to
[56:15] be hidden in the secret of his pavilion
[56:17] or in the secret of his tabernacle, in
[56:20] the secret, the next phrase is in the
[56:23] secret of his tabernacle. And the
[56:25] scripture says God was in Christ.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; That was the secret.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why this messenger had to
[56:33] say Christ
[56:35] &gt;&gt; is the mystery of God
[56:38] &gt;&gt; revealed
[56:44] &gt;&gt; seasons
[56:46] of his revealing.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ
[56:51] &gt;&gt; and those that caught that secret
[56:55] &gt;&gt; were protected.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the ones who made it
[56:59] through the time when Jesus was here.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Then that spirit came into them on the
[57:05] day of Pentecost.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And at the end of this at the end of the
[57:10] days of grace, or I would say I won't
[57:12] say the end of the days of grace, but
[57:14] during this 2,000 years of the gospel,
[57:17] &gt;&gt; then comes a a vessel.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And I will say plainly, a tabernacle.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. that God could exercise himself
[57:28] and demonstrate himself as a God, a a
[57:32] prophet of God.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the God prophet
[57:36] &gt;&gt; and they missed that.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And now we have a prophet of God and
[57:42] they missed that.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; But he came for a div defined purpose.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; When Jesus Christ was here, he had a
[57:50] divine purpose to call out a certain
[57:53] number. And in John 17 in his prayer he
[57:57] says that those that were yours you have
[58:00] given them to me
[58:02] &gt;&gt; and I have lost none of them save the
[58:04] son of predition which was Judas.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[58:10] And so, brother Brandham
[58:12] says in this testimony of a true
[58:15] witness, but the life that was in the
[58:17] leaf talks about nature now goes back
[58:20] where it come from down through the tree
[58:23] to the root. And there it remains in the
[58:26] root of the tree until another season.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; There the root of David.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:38] This world has never been able to
[58:40] destroy that life.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; They're at the root of David.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The life simply goes back down to the
[58:46] root
[58:48] &gt;&gt; for another season. Waiting for another
[58:50] season
[58:51] &gt;&gt; and then it erupts again.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; God.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And to have that revealed is the secret
[58:58] of his tabernacle.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; He may change his tabernacle, but it's
[59:02] the same God.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is why the apostle Paul
[59:07] can come out this great mystery. Christ
[59:11] &gt;&gt; in you.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; What about that one?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Are we missing that one?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, oh yeah, but I, you know,
[59:22] they're this and they're that and
[59:23] there's something else." But the blood
[59:26] washed
[59:27] &gt;&gt; body of Jesus Christ
[59:29] &gt;&gt; has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit of
[59:32] God. And in that secret is your
[59:36] protection
[59:38] &gt;&gt; today. And that's the only protection
[59:40] there is
[59:44] &gt;&gt; until another season. For this season,
[59:47] for this season, the sun has rocked away
[59:50] and the earth has rocked away from the
[59:53] sun and it's following the orbit as it
[59:56] goes around and it's away and cold
[1:00:00] weather is headed for the earth.
[1:00:02] Therefore, the root holds the life of
[1:00:05] that leaf until the earth rocks back
[1:00:08] again. And then there is no way to ever
[1:00:12] hide that leaf from coming back again.
[1:00:16] It'll come back just as sure as the sun
[1:00:18] comes back.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; And I'll say it is the rising of the
[1:00:21] sun.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The sun has come out again. And that and
[1:00:28] that messenger that came at this time
[1:00:30] was sent for one reason to tell the
[1:00:33] people the sun has risen again.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And don't miss the sun rising. Don't
[1:00:39] miss it. It's another day.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Another season of revelation.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And there's no way to keep the leaf from
[1:00:52] coming back. just as sure as it sun
[1:00:55] comes back, it'll come back. But it has
[1:00:59] to wait for another season before it
[1:01:01] comes back.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, and I put in bold
[1:01:05] letters, that season, friends,
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; has arrived.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; You may wonder, you may say, well, oh,
[1:01:14] the revival amongst the young people,
[1:01:15] whatever more, it's just another season.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And the secret of God is in the
[1:01:21] revelation of that season. And it's up
[1:01:24] to us to say what's happening.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; It's not up to us to say I got to be to
[1:01:28] work tomorrow morning, 8:00, 7:00, or
[1:01:30] got to get up at 6:00. That's all fine.
[1:01:33] That's not the season. That that's the
[1:01:35] season of mortal life.
[1:01:38] Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; And today that gives a great testimony
[1:01:41] as a witness of God, the God of
[1:01:44] creation, because that when we are in
[1:01:46] the season of mortal life,
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; that's raising children,
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; marrying and bringing forth families,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; this is a life or the season of mortal
[1:01:57] life.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; We've all experienced that and we're
[1:02:00] well acquainted with the seasons
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; that we have in mortal life. And we have
[1:02:05] the whole gamut here today. We have
[1:02:09] those that are single, those that are
[1:02:11] unmarried, those that are without
[1:02:13] families, those that have families,
[1:02:16] we've had children, we've raised the
[1:02:18] children, and we've gone through our
[1:02:21] teens and all of these various things.
[1:02:23] We've experienced all these seasons, and
[1:02:26] now you have maybe empty nesters, and
[1:02:29] we're all getting adjusted to these
[1:02:31] things. Some have gone into retirement
[1:02:33] and it's all an adjustment. One thing
[1:02:36] and another. We're always adjusting
[1:02:38] because the target is moving. Life is
[1:02:41] moving. But let me tell you something.
[1:02:43] There is no satisfaction in mortal life
[1:02:47] without him.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; I don't care what little you have or how
[1:02:52] much you have. There's no satisfaction.
[1:02:55] our fulfillment and the secret of his
[1:02:58] tabernacle is our only place of
[1:03:01] fulfillment and satisfaction and safety.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And we make our way through life the
[1:03:08] best we can, make our best decisions
[1:03:10] that we can and do what we need to do.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; But when we have been born from above,
[1:03:18] the body returns to the dust from where
[1:03:20] it came
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; and the spirit goes up to where it come
[1:03:24] from, to the God who gave it. And there
[1:03:29] will come,
[1:03:31] listen, this isn't just a man's voice.
[1:03:34] And there will come another season.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; And that season that will come will be
[1:03:41] the immortal season. I believe brother
[1:03:44] Vio was about here and I just got
[1:03:47] swallowed up into the presence of the
[1:03:50] one that was speaking there this thing.
[1:03:53] There will be another season
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; and I believe we have entered into that
[1:03:58] season. That's what I planned by God's
[1:04:00] help to come to in this service. And
[1:04:03] when the son of God rises with healing
[1:04:06] in his wings, that's why the ministry
[1:04:08] started with a healing in his wings
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; and healing ministry.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; It'll be totally impossible to hold
[1:04:17] those bodies in the ground any longer.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; They'll come forth in the brightness of
[1:04:23] the son of God. Very nature itself
[1:04:27] testifies of that. Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, there were
[1:04:32] seasons.
[1:04:35] There were seasons of many seasons, but
[1:04:37] there were seasons of seven fast, seven
[1:04:40] feasts.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And the Bible talks about it. These are
[1:04:44] the feasts of the Lord,
[1:04:46] even holy convocations,
[1:04:49] which you shall proclaim in their
[1:04:52] seasons.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; When these times come, you speak of it.
[1:04:57] Yes.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; When these times come, you proclaim it.
[1:04:59] You declare it.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that God when he's
[1:05:03] changing season, I'm going to change
[1:05:06] where I'm going to tabernacle. I'm going
[1:05:08] to change where I take my people. I'm
[1:05:10] going to bring them to a change of the
[1:05:12] body. Don't you think he would send a
[1:05:14] remarkable
[1:05:16] witness that this is the season?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; You're not just going to church,
[1:05:24] friends. You're not just having a
[1:05:26] picnic.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; You're not just having camp. That has
[1:05:29] nothing to do with it. I won't say has
[1:05:31] nothing to do with it. That's only a
[1:05:32] little part of it.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; But it is your individual life with this
[1:05:37] living one, Jesus Christ.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; This one, the sun has rocked back
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; close to the earth. This earth,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; this earth
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; to bring out the life,
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; the true life. And that's why you lose
[1:05:52] the interest in this world.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You have adjustments in this world. You
[1:05:59] don't even know why you may things that
[1:06:01] were just you were so focused on them.
[1:06:04] You just had to go in a certain
[1:06:05] direction and suddenly something
[1:06:07] happens. It's a pull from within. The
[1:06:11] sun has rocked back close.
[1:06:19] Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I had it.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; I wasn't preaching every Sunday. There
[1:06:25] was a time I was working.
[1:06:28] I won't even get into it. It's
[1:06:30] unimportant.
[1:06:33] When I was vice president, they said,
[1:06:35] "You're going to be president. We've
[1:06:36] named you as president. You're going to
[1:06:38] have a handsome increase in salary
[1:06:41] already."
[1:06:43] Already. I had almost a disdain
[1:06:47] for anything to do with that
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; and I I I resigned.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I resigned. I say
[1:06:59] I wasn't a professional man. That was I
[1:07:01] needed that. He said, "What are you
[1:07:03] going to do with your family? I don't
[1:07:04] know what's going to happen to the
[1:07:05] family." I wasn't too sure, but I knew I
[1:07:08] had to take a step.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; That was the step I took.
[1:07:17] And these seven feasts,
[1:07:19] they all spoke of Christ. Every one of
[1:07:21] them.
[1:07:23] There was the feast of Passover,
[1:07:26] feast of unleavened bread, feast of the
[1:07:28] first fruits of the resurrection,
[1:07:32] the feast of Pentecost,
[1:07:34] the feast of trumpets.
[1:07:36] Prophet said is the calling of the Jews
[1:07:40] to bring them to their day of atonement
[1:07:42] because the next feast was the atonement
[1:07:45] and the next feast was tabernacles.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; The feast of tabernacles
[1:07:50] that's the last feast in the Old
[1:07:53] Testament. And that's the feast every
[1:07:55] believer comes to
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; change this tabernacle
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; from mortal from the season of mortal.
[1:08:06] to the season of immortal.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; If we miss that, we've missed
[1:08:11] everything.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care what we achieve here on
[1:08:14] earth. If we miss that. So, I'll say to
[1:08:16] this congregation and all and I feel so
[1:08:18] not merely inspired, but I feel
[1:08:20] responsible to say, don't miss this.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Even if you go away from here saying,
[1:08:28] "Well, how?" Well, that's good. and put
[1:08:31] yourself in a place say, "Oh, God, I I I
[1:08:34] didn't understand everything I heard
[1:08:36] this morning, but don't let me miss
[1:08:38] that.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Don't let me miss what you're doing.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let me miss what you're revealing
[1:08:44] at this time.
[1:08:46] this season.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; and the seasons in the scripture are,
[1:08:56] you're listening, young people, the
[1:08:59] seasons in the scripture are
[1:09:02] an appointed place.
[1:09:05] You know, maybe this morning you got up
[1:09:07] and thought, I'm going to go to church.
[1:09:10] Perhaps I can change that just a wee
[1:09:11] bit. It might well be
[1:09:14] that this is an appointment God called
[1:09:16] you to.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And in the mind of God, he may be
[1:09:20] saying, "You
[1:09:22] calling you by name."
[1:09:28] It's absolutely urgent that you hear
[1:09:30] this.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I have called you here.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And if we put it in that context,
[1:09:38] you'll feel different about where you're
[1:09:39] sitting.
[1:09:41] That's right.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You mean I have been called here? I I
[1:09:45] thought I just came to church. I thought
[1:09:46] I heard, you know, brother so and so
[1:09:48] speak.
[1:09:51] But why don't you put it in another
[1:09:52] context that God Almighty called you
[1:09:54] here?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; So, it's time for you to be real serious
[1:09:59] about this.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Because we've entered another season.
[1:10:12] It could be an appointed time, a
[1:10:14] meeting, an appointed sign. I'm going to
[1:10:17] talk about a sign,
[1:10:20] a sacred season. It could be a set feast
[1:10:23] or the tent of meeting,
[1:10:26] seasons of revelation.
[1:10:28] Jesus said, "All things are delivered
[1:10:30] unto me of my father, and no man knoweth
[1:10:34] the son but the father." Right?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Do we hear that?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; No man knoweth the Son,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; but the That was the problem.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; For those that didn't believe, no man
[1:10:46] knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither
[1:10:49] knoweth any man the Father, save the
[1:10:52] Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
[1:10:57] reveal him.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; There is no other way.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a series of other
[1:11:04] doctrines.
[1:11:05] This is the son himself. But if people
[1:11:08] within the message fail to say the son,
[1:11:10] who's going to do the revealing?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; The son is the logos. The son is the
[1:11:15] word of God revealed. The son is God
[1:11:18] himself taking his word, making his
[1:11:21] thought known and saying and with
[1:11:23] declaring and proclaiming this is me.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; This is another spiritual feast. This is
[1:11:30] a season of another spiritual feast.
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:39] to reveal.
[1:11:41] I'm going to make some statements now.
[1:11:43] Knowledge is not revelation.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; A revelation may bring you knowledge,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; but gaining knowledge is not a
[1:11:54] revelation.
[1:11:57] putting a series of statements together
[1:12:01] that connect to and come out with a
[1:12:04] final wonderful conclusion. That's not
[1:12:07] revelation.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Revelation is not you finally coming
[1:12:15] into a church and hearing a preacher say
[1:12:19] something that say, you know what, that
[1:12:21] makes a lot of sense. That's not
[1:12:23] revelation. Right?
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Revelation is not something making a lot
[1:12:28] of sense.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; In fact, revelation may make no sense at
[1:12:32] all.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; It might well be that you'd say, "Why in
[1:12:37] the world am I believing this,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; but somehow revelation, you can't let go
[1:12:43] of it.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Even if you wanted to, you can't let go
[1:12:49] of it.
[1:12:52] Hallelujah.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Revelation is not just agreeing with a
[1:12:57] group of people and being one of the
[1:13:00] community.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with revelation.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] Revelation is something that is
[1:13:15] and I don't expect that you will
[1:13:18] understand everything I'm trying to say
[1:13:19] because I don't understand it fully
[1:13:21] myself
[1:13:22] and I'm not ashamed to admit that
[1:13:26] something I pondered for a very long
[1:13:27] time.
[1:13:30] But to reveal or to be revealed is to
[1:13:33] uncover essentially uncover something.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. to lay open what has been veiled
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; or covered.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Or to make it known or to make it clear,
[1:13:46] making it manifest,
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Or to disclose what has previously been
[1:13:52] unknown.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's something that's revealed.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And revelation
[1:13:59] I won't bother getting into the Greek
[1:14:01] words apocalyppsis
[1:14:04] but revelation is is to be revealed
[1:14:08] very similar manifestation
[1:14:10] but revelation also can be coming a
[1:14:14] coming
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; the revelation of Jesus Christ can be
[1:14:19] the coming of Jesus Christ
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; and he can come in degrees.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He came as a baby.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; When he was conceived in the womb of a
[1:14:32] virgin, he was coming.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Who knew it? Mary
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and perhaps Joseph.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; What's it going to be like? What's it
[1:14:43] going to do? They didn't know anything.
[1:14:45] But he was coming.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And if someone had got up and declared,
[1:14:50] you know, I have God spoke to me. The
[1:14:53] Messiah is coming.
[1:14:55] He wouldn't persuade very many people.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have a nice congregation as
[1:15:03] we have
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; this morning.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; And then the babe was born and the
[1:15:09] shepherds come and the prophet speaks in
[1:15:12] this day. Why was the shepherds
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; still has to be shepherds?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Perhaps unlearned men.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. But they they had heard said,
[1:15:22] "We've heard angels.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; We heard an angelic host.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Uh you fellas have never persuaded
[1:15:29] anybody.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; You've never moved. You've never led a
[1:15:35] political party. You've never uh been a
[1:15:38] success in business.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Go and mind your sheep."
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus came in simplicity.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; But he was coming. And then when he was
[1:15:50] 12 or thereabouts, he's in the temple
[1:15:52] asking questions and answering
[1:15:55] questions. It was Jesus Christ.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; But to say that he was there on earth,
[1:16:00] who is going to believe it?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; But that was the secret of God's
[1:16:04] tabernacle.
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] And I'll soon be coming to the point
[1:16:17] where he walked and saw some fishermen.
[1:16:21] And don't put it back there because that
[1:16:23] one
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; who walked there and called those young
[1:16:27] men
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; is here this morning still calling young
[1:16:31] men and young ladies
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; and parents
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; and seniors.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; It's the same fire.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I was so moved as a
[1:16:43] prophet of God had a woman standing in
[1:16:45] front of him and he said, "Can't you see
[1:16:47] that pillar of fire that's on the
[1:16:49] picture?" He said, "Now it hangs between
[1:16:52] I and the woman and I'm speaking to her
[1:16:55] through that fire."
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to her through that light.
[1:17:00] Is what he said. Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; I don't recall these words before, but I
[1:17:06] was saying and I want you to be able to
[1:17:08] say, "Oh God, what is it that you
[1:17:10] declared in this ministry that has
[1:17:13] called me? This word that has called me.
[1:17:16] This thing that has become more real to
[1:17:17] me than even my friends or my parents or
[1:17:21] or my children. And it's more real to
[1:17:23] me."
[1:17:26] as I have her heard a sister say to me
[1:17:29] on the phone in fact it's sister Ellaner
[1:17:32] Drake
[1:17:34] said this is my family
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; tell you what friends
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; to say that in truth
[1:17:43] is a real not only a reality that's a
[1:17:46] revelation itself
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; this is family
[1:18:06] Revelation should not be confused with a
[1:18:08] host of other things
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; that we all experience and come in
[1:18:12] contact with and our other experiences.
[1:18:16] Revelation will produce a multitude of
[1:18:18] feelings.
[1:18:20] Revelation will produce
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; a multitude of feelings.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; You may cry. You may rejoice.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; You may scream.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; You may shout. You may clap your hands.
[1:18:33] Those things are all wonderful. They're
[1:18:35] not necessarily revelation within
[1:18:38] themselves.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; But they may well be a result
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; of revelation.
[1:18:47] They're not necessarily the evidence of
[1:18:49] revelation. For a lot of people, they
[1:18:51] clap their hands at the hockey game.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; They throw their hats in the air at the
[1:18:55] baseball game.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; They shout and become so enthused and
[1:19:00] inspired. I mean, they even entered into
[1:19:03] fighting over their favorite.
[1:19:06] What is it?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; It's certainly a cheap substitute.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; But revelation may cause a person to do
[1:19:13] some fanatical things.
[1:19:15] may cause people to turn aside from or
[1:19:18] they might cause a person to give
[1:19:20] themselves to a certain profession
[1:19:23] because God knows on down the road
[1:19:25] they're going to be used or they're
[1:19:26] going to meet somebody.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Studies and teaching
[1:19:35] and gaining wisdom may result from
[1:19:38] revelation
[1:19:40] but they in themselves are not
[1:19:42] revelation. Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; In the future home,
[1:19:47] brother Brandham was talking about the
[1:19:48] little woman at the well and the and the
[1:19:51] priests.
[1:19:53] And he said, "Now here it was in this
[1:19:56] little woman. She was one of his
[1:19:58] attributes.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Life had been very sad for her.
[1:20:04] She had gone through several marriages,
[1:20:06] five,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; and the man she was with was not her
[1:20:08] husband,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and she wouldn't be a very good
[1:20:11] candidate for most churches,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; but she was a candidate for this one.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; And she says, "Now," he said, "Now there
[1:20:26] was a priest representing the light."
[1:20:28] representing the light.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen very close friends. I feel
[1:20:35] very very different about this service
[1:20:37] and I don't want you to walk out and
[1:20:38] say, "Well, I I I I enjoyed the
[1:20:41] service." That's I don't care whether
[1:20:42] you enjoy it or don't enjoy it. I trust
[1:20:45] that you'll get what God is wanting to
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; do for you.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And so he said, and I
[1:20:56] I know, do we have that slide?
[1:21:01] I believe we do.
[1:21:07] Slide three and four.
[1:21:14] That was it. We just just passed by.
[1:21:18] Here it was.
[1:21:25] Here it was in this little woman. She
[1:21:28] was one of his attributes. Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And there was the priest representing
[1:21:34] the light.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Notice please I have underlined he had
[1:21:38] learned
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; he had learned it from the Bible.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; He had the right book.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; He had learned that God was God.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; He had learned that holiness was right.
[1:21:53] He was learned or learned that there was
[1:21:57] a law of God. He had learned it because
[1:22:01] of an intellectual conception.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; He mentally could grasp those things.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; God's God and maybe go through the
[1:22:11] studies perhaps had a preacher tell
[1:22:13] God's God. God's supernatural. He he
[1:22:16] learned those things. That's not
[1:22:18] revelation in itself.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And he was born in the right lineage.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I was born in a Christian family. I was
[1:22:29] born in a message family. I'm in the
[1:22:31] right lineage. He was a Levite.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; He was from the priesthood, but he only
[1:22:38] knew it by intellectual conception. He
[1:22:41] only knew it by intellectual conception.
[1:22:43] We're here behind the pulpit to get you
[1:22:45] beyond intellectual conception.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. to where the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:22:53] behind the preaching of the word and
[1:22:55] moves upon you until it becomes such a
[1:22:58] reality.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Your life becomes a sacrifice to gues
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; and he becomes the focal point and he's
[1:23:10] the only focal point.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to me young people,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; you that are of marriageable age and
[1:23:16] some that are going to be married.
[1:23:19] Marriage is not the end all.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Finding the right man or the right woman
[1:23:26] is not the end all. That's only the
[1:23:28] beginning of of of another season in
[1:23:33] mortal life,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; in the mortal season.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; And you'll have your disappointments and
[1:23:39] you'll have your great times and you'll
[1:23:41] have your struggles and all of these
[1:23:42] things. That all happens in mortal life
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; because that's the season of mortal
[1:23:49] life.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; You might be povertystricken. You might
[1:23:52] be rich. You might be sick. You might be
[1:23:54] healthy. I don't know.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I know one thing. You'll only make it
[1:23:58] through this mortal life
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; if you have yourself if you have a a a I
[1:24:04] would say a true understanding or a true
[1:24:07] revelation. And I believe that the word
[1:24:09] understanding is not right because you
[1:24:12] can understand things intellectually but
[1:24:15] it has to be more than that.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; It must be more than that.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, what what more?"
[1:24:24] Well, is there something more for Yes,
[1:24:27] there is something more for us.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Well, why do you say there's something
[1:24:31] more? Why am I not why am I not getting
[1:24:34] it? I'll tell you why there's something
[1:24:35] more is because we're in another season.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I will declare to you today that the
[1:24:43] coming of the messenger prophet in this
[1:24:46] end time.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And over 50 times he refers to very
[1:24:52] revealing people said, "Well, it's
[1:24:53] discernment.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a gift of discernment
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; or or whatever." He even used the word
[1:24:59] discernment. Yes,
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; that's you can have discernment without
[1:25:03] saying and your name is Mrs. Wolf.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; You have a tumor on your breast.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; It's on your left breast and you live at
[1:25:11] such and such an address. That isn't
[1:25:13] just discernment, friend.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; And that's not William Brandon speaking.
[1:25:18] That's his voice.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; But it's the son of man, Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] using that.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And he referred to it and this is what
[1:25:26] he said over 50 times. Surely we
[1:25:28] shouldn't have to have it over 50 times.
[1:25:31] This is the sign of the resurrection.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; The past resurrection which was a type
[1:25:39] of the first of this resurrection. It's
[1:25:41] a type of the resurrection. This is a
[1:25:44] sign friends in this cultured age in
[1:25:48] this electronic and digital age. This is
[1:25:51] a sign. You have received the sign of
[1:25:54] the resurrection.
[1:25:57] And don't ever forget it.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; As Tommy Osborne said, it will not be
[1:26:03] repeated again.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; You will not have another messenger.
[1:26:08] You're not going to have something come
[1:26:10] and move you into some spontaneous,
[1:26:13] incredible experience. You've had it.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; As Jesus said to his disciples, Elias
[1:26:21] has already come and you didn't know it.
[1:26:30] Isn't it incredible?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; So he learned it by what had happened.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't take any brains to know what had
[1:26:44] happened. Just read history.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Study whatever you want. That's what had
[1:26:49] happened.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; But not what was happening. And what was
[1:26:54] happening is God was tabernacled in
[1:26:58] flesh.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; That's what was happening. And that's
[1:27:01] what he was missing.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; And I will tell you in without any
[1:27:06] apology, God tabernacled himself in you
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; that are filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; to a measure that he's called you to.
[1:27:15] And God was tabernacled in the prophet
[1:27:17] of God,
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; one we call William Brandham. God was
[1:27:20] tabernacled in him to speak through him
[1:27:23] to tell people things they knew. That's
[1:27:26] why he said multitudes of times were
[1:27:28] strangers. Raise your hand if we're a
[1:27:30] stranger.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And they all raised her hand. Some would
[1:27:34] say, "Well, I was in another meeting."
[1:27:35] Yes, you were in another meeting. And
[1:27:37] this morning I'm reading and he's saying
[1:27:39] he said but this talking to this person
[1:27:42] this woman and she said yes
[1:27:45] and yes and yes
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; and yes
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; and yes that is right
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; all of those things
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; and have a person on your mind. Yes. And
[1:27:57] you're troubled about him. Yes. And it's
[1:28:00] your husband. Yes. That's right.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Who knows those things?
[1:28:07] What book did it come out of?
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Who has spoken?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Who's called you?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And may I suggest to you that one
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; who had that kind of knowledge
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; still has that kind of knowledge about
[1:28:25] where you're sitting
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; and that you need to sit in this service
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; by appointment.
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:36] This is a tent of your meeting.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to pay a bit of
[1:28:48] attention to the clock.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I want to identify with Peter.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; I want you to identify with Peter.
[1:29:03] We identify with various characters in
[1:29:05] the Bible, but I'd like you to identify
[1:29:07] with Peter in connection to the seasons
[1:29:11] of Revelation. And you'll be able to
[1:29:14] identify with him at various stages
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; of his life.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And I want you to not only feel your ups
[1:29:24] and feel your downs, but I just want you
[1:29:26] to go with him.
[1:29:34] We won't show anymore. I'm done with the
[1:29:36] slides. Thank you.
[1:29:40] The reason I've chosen Peter is because
[1:29:43] for a number of reasons that you'll
[1:29:46] understand as I work through the
[1:29:48] message,
[1:29:50] but he experienced the full cycle
[1:29:53] of a believer's life.
[1:29:56] He was called from humble beginnings as
[1:29:58] a fisherman.
[1:30:00] He experienced the supernatural in his
[1:30:02] early walk with Jesus Christ.
[1:30:07] And brother Brandham says about him
[1:30:09] speak to the rock. He said Peter just
[1:30:11] lost all his dignity and everything.
[1:30:13] He jumped upon a soap box. This is after
[1:30:16] he's filled with the Holy Spirit and
[1:30:18] begin to preach. My a soapbox preacher.
[1:30:20] Yes, sir. What was it? He had the Holy
[1:30:25] Ghost. He was eating of the godly mana.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; And why Christ speak? He said he met a
[1:30:31] man by the name of Peter. And he said to
[1:30:34] him and he told him, "Your name is Simon
[1:30:40] and you're the son of Jonas."
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And he believed him.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Moses had said before this
[1:30:49] time, the Lord your God shall raise up a
[1:30:52] prophet just like me.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; And that'll be the sign you'll know.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; He'll be a God prophet.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; The Messiah
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; will be both God and prophet.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And he'll do the same. He'll do the sign
[1:31:06] of a prophet.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; When he does.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; And he says that's what Peter caught
[1:31:12] that
[1:31:18] I'll say Peter
[1:31:21] was called with his brother Andrew.
[1:31:26] Something was made known to them. But
[1:31:27] the Bible tells us that they were
[1:31:29] casting their net.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; They were actually in action. They were
[1:31:34] they weren't just fishing with a pole.
[1:31:35] They were casting their net. This was
[1:31:37] their livelihood.
[1:31:40] And Jesus came by
[1:31:43] and called.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Did they have a revelation? I
[1:31:50] probably not. But something surely
[1:31:54] happened.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; And no doubt every person here
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; will be able to say that. Something
[1:32:02] happened. I don't know exactly what. I
[1:32:04] don't know exactly why I followed this
[1:32:06] man, but I was gripped.
[1:32:10] And I followed him and I left my net.
[1:32:12] You mean you left your job, you left
[1:32:14] your position, you left your friends or
[1:32:16] whatever more?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, I did.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; What in the world happened? I'm not too
[1:32:22] sure.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus comes to Peter's house.
[1:32:30] So he had a house and he was married and
[1:32:33] his wife's mother was sick with a fever.
[1:32:37] a little simple thing and he healed her.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; And I thought,
[1:32:43] goodness. Wow.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why I left my net.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; This is something more than I'd
[1:32:50] expected.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And he was one that was sent out to
[1:32:53] preach and to heal the sick.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; He experienced that.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; He's been called impetuous Peter because
[1:33:03] he was one that would do things on the
[1:33:05] spur of the moment.
[1:33:07] So he saw this figure on walking on the
[1:33:10] water and they were frightened. They
[1:33:12] thought it's a spirit and and he said,
[1:33:14] "Lord, if it's you, let allow call me
[1:33:16] and let me step out."
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And he stepped over the railing of that
[1:33:20] boat
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and walked on the water. Others said,
[1:33:23] "Oh yeah, but he sank." I'm proud of him
[1:33:25] that he stepped out of the boat
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; and he did spend some time moments
[1:33:35] walking on the water.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; These all were distinct seasons of
[1:33:40] revelation.
[1:33:43] To what degree, I don't know.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; But they were distinct seasons of
[1:33:48] revelation. and he had his joy and he he
[1:33:52] saw all this glorious power
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; and the people wanting to make his
[1:33:57] leader a king
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; and it must have been moving for him to
[1:34:02] be associated and not only associated he
[1:34:05] became one of the inner circle
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Peter James and John Peter James and
[1:34:10] John Peter James and John maybe even the
[1:34:14] rest didn't understand that and really
[1:34:15] didn't like it that much But Jesus
[1:34:19] sometimes would call him Peter, James,
[1:34:22] and John.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Peter already had many supernatural
[1:34:29] experiences being chosen and associated
[1:34:32] with the Lord Jesus Christ. He most
[1:34:35] definitely was one of the inner circle.
[1:34:38] He was chosen with John and James to be
[1:34:40] on the Mount Transfiguration. Now he's
[1:34:43] moved from fishing to the Mount of
[1:34:46] Transfiguration.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. for a revelation of Jesus Christ as
[1:34:50] the son of God.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And Peter sees the transfiguration.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; He sees Moses and he sees Elijah.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:35:03] The secret of the person of the Lord
[1:35:05] Jesus Christ can only come from God our
[1:35:07] father and by no other way.
[1:35:13] Peter could tell of what came. But now
[1:35:16] friends, this is not out of a book. This
[1:35:18] is just how God spoke by one heart.
[1:35:22] Peter could tell of what come over him
[1:35:24] when he heard Jesus call and and what it
[1:35:27] was that caused him to leave the fishing
[1:35:30] and to follow Christ and seeing the
[1:35:33] multitudes healed and being sent out to
[1:35:35] preach. He could talk all about that.
[1:35:37] And seeing the miracles yet there was
[1:35:40] another season. Yes,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; there was another season
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; that had to come
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; and when Jesus was coming to the coast
[1:35:54] of Cesaria Philippi,
[1:35:57] he asked his disciples saying, "Who do
[1:36:00] men say that I am?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; That I the son of man am."
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Some say they had this
[1:36:08] knowledge.
[1:36:10] Some say that you're John the Baptist
[1:36:12] and others Elias.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah or one of the prophets? And he
[1:36:18] says unto them, but who say ye that I
[1:36:21] am? And Simon Peter.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; That's why I wanted to follow through
[1:36:25] with Simon Peter.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[1:36:30] art the Christ,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God."
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:36] Now friends,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; that phrase had never been spoken
[1:36:40] before.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't learn it.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't read it in a book.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That phrase was not in the Torah or the
[1:36:53] Bible.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't learn it in Sunday school.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; He didn't hear any rabbi say it.
[1:37:02] Where did it come from?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? So specifically,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; thou art the Christ,
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Try to absorb this.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Now here comes the prophet messenger who
[1:37:26] saw that light. Saw him all the time.
[1:37:28] Yeah.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Saw him regularly.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; He said in paradox
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to be coming to the what I
[1:37:42] think is the paradox of all paradoxes.
[1:37:48] He said, you know, Paul never did see
[1:37:50] Jesus in physical form.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; He said he had to accept the revelation
[1:37:55] just like Peter did. Yes.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Paul had to receive it just like Peter
[1:38:00] did.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Peter saw him in the flesh. Paul never
[1:38:03] saw him in the flesh, but he said Pet
[1:38:05] had to receive it like Peter did.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; He said Peter
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; never knew Jesus by physical form.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to put that down. Come on.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; That's in paradox
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; in Chicago in 1963.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. I want
[1:38:34] you to absorb it into your own in your
[1:38:37] own experience
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; because we're so earthly. We're so tied
[1:38:43] to mortal life
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; and we need to be moved. If if there's
[1:38:48] any people that need to be moved out of
[1:38:51] this cycle in season of mortal life,
[1:38:54] it's you.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And me,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; and you and those up on the balcony and
[1:39:00] those
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; on the internet, it's you.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; We need to be moved out of this cycle
[1:39:07] and season of mortal life
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; because down here we suffer from
[1:39:12] sickness. We suffer from infirmities. We
[1:39:15] have financial disasters and financial
[1:39:18] things. We have educational and peer uh
[1:39:22] peer pressure. We have all kinds of
[1:39:24] things pulling on us from different
[1:39:26] directions that we have. That's part of
[1:39:30] mortal life
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; this mortal season. Let me announce to
[1:39:34] you that has no place in the immortal
[1:39:37] realm.
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:45] Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Peter never did know Jesus
[1:39:50] by physical form." And he said, "Who
[1:39:52] does men say that I, the son of man,
[1:39:55] am?" Some of them said, "You're Moses or
[1:39:57] you're Elias, you're Jeremiah."
[1:40:00] He said, "Now, that's not what I asked
[1:40:02] you.
[1:40:05] What do you say?" Peter said, "Thou art
[1:40:07] the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[1:40:11] And he said,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to be focused this way.
[1:40:22] Babies will always be babies. Young
[1:40:23] people will always be young people. But
[1:40:26] look this way.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; I'll not preach this again. Just like
[1:40:30] this.
[1:40:34] Blessed art thou
[1:40:37] Simon Barjonah.
[1:40:40] What's your name?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Put your name there.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Brother John.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Sister Briana or
[1:40:55] whoever.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou.
[1:40:59] Flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:41:03] you.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; But my father which is in heaven
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; has revealed it to you.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; What is he revealing? He's revealing the
[1:41:15] tabernacle.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; The secret of his tabernacle
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; that you might know him whom to know his
[1:41:22] life eternal.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:26] He's in you
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; in a measure. He's in me in a measure.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; He's in the prophet of God in a measure.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; But he was in Christ without measure.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And that Christ without measure has
[1:41:41] chosen you to be part of his
[1:41:43] measurement.
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; That is your calling in this life.
[1:41:52] You are not called just to work.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; You are not called just to have a
[1:41:57] profession.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; You are not called just to get an
[1:42:01] education, get all you can.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Earn all you can
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; and give all you can.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; You're not called to just come here to
[1:42:11] this church.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; That's not it. This is all part of the
[1:42:15] program.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:42:20] Thank you, Lord God.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[1:42:25] you.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; And upon this rock, I'll build my
[1:42:28] church, and the gates of hell
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; cannot prevail against it.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen very, very
[1:42:35] carefully because here is the secret of
[1:42:36] your victory.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "And there you are, a paradox."
[1:42:45] when he was standing there
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; and didn't know him in human flesh, but
[1:42:50] he knowed him by his works and his
[1:42:54] revelation. Yes.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; It take a special gift from God
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; for you to look beyond this flesh
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; or the flesh of somebody sitting next to
[1:43:16] you.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "Why are you here?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Why are you here?
[1:43:24] Why is anybody here?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; We may have a big variety of answers why
[1:43:34] I'm here. I'm here because my parents
[1:43:37] come. I'm here because my wife, my
[1:43:39] husband. I'm here because it's Sunday
[1:43:40] morning. We always go to church.
[1:43:44] Sorry folks.
[1:43:47] That's wonderful. But it's got to go a
[1:43:49] lot deeper than that.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:53] I'm here because I'm going to interact
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; with the God
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; my God
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; in other people.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I'm here to be impacted
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; and I'm here to impact somebody else.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; I'm here because I'm connected to an
[1:44:12] immortal realm.
[1:44:14] I'm here because I have identified an
[1:44:17] immortal season
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; creeping in, flowing in upon the mortal
[1:44:23] season.
[1:44:27] [Applause]
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make some statements. You
[1:44:31] might think I'm
[1:44:33] crazy. I'm going to make them anyway.
[1:44:40] as Jesus moved
[1:44:43] and as Peter moved also.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Can I say this about Peter? And then I'm
[1:44:48] going to come I want to come right to
[1:44:51] this transition time.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; And the fact that Peter came to it is
[1:44:57] not an accident.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; The fact that Jesus rose from the dead
[1:45:02] is not an accident. And it's not it is a
[1:45:04] one time in history but it was the
[1:45:07] crisis. It was the crux of history. It
[1:45:09] was the apex
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; for the redemption of the world.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And listen friends,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; don't take this as a sermon, please.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; But when that beloved son of God said it
[1:45:21] is finished,
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; that has to affect you where you're
[1:45:25] sitting today.
[1:45:27] [Applause]
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:31] Praise God.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Then came Peter to him and said, "How
[1:45:39] often we're following Peter,
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; how oft shall my brother sin against me
[1:45:44] and I forgive him till seven times
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; and you know the answer of Jesus."
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; And then Peter said unto him, "Behold,
[1:45:56] we've forsaken all and we've followed
[1:45:58] you. What shall we have?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[1:46:05] and Peter said to Jesus, "Though all men
[1:46:08] shall be offended because of thee, I
[1:46:10] will never be offended."
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And finally, Peter said, "And though I
[1:46:20] should die with thee, yet I will not
[1:46:23] deny thee." Likewise also said all the
[1:46:26] disciples.
[1:46:28] Yes, sir.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; And he took with him, Jesus did, took
[1:46:33] with him Peter and the two sons of
[1:46:35] Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and
[1:46:38] very heavy.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Here's just wondered.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; I walked on the water with him.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; I handed out bread and we took up 12
[1:46:50] baskets.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; I I saw cooked fish grow in my hands.
[1:46:59] We fed thousands.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I saw the lame walk. I saw the blind. I
[1:47:04] heard them cry out. I saw that.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:47:10] he's seeing him. He's entering another
[1:47:12] season.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And he sees him become very sorrowful.
[1:47:19] And he took with him the inner circle,
[1:47:22] Peter, James, and John. And he began to
[1:47:24] be very sorrowful.
[1:47:32] And Jesus comes to them and said and
[1:47:36] findeth them asleep. Here's the man that
[1:47:38] just said, "I'm going to die with you.
[1:47:40] I'll never be offended."
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "But could you not watch
[1:47:48] with me one hour?
[1:47:56] And then they've taken him now and
[1:47:57] they're going to take him to the
[1:47:58] judgment hall. And the Bible says, "And
[1:48:02] Peter followed a far off
[1:48:05] under the high priest place." He he
[1:48:06] wasn't in church Sunday morning.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; He wasn't staying close in his
[1:48:12] footsteps. Then
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; things were going, he was entering
[1:48:17] another season, a season he didn't
[1:48:19] expect. Listen
[1:48:21] to me now everybody. I want every
[1:48:23] visitor.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; I want you all to listen. You think this
[1:48:27] is just religion. This is a long ways
[1:48:29] from religion.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; This on another planet from religion.
[1:48:33] This has nothing to do with churchity or
[1:48:35] religiosity.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And this quite frankly never came out of
[1:48:41] a book.
[1:48:43] This
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; came from the Holy Spirit
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; stirring my own soul.
[1:48:48] Yeah,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; this is about where I was, brother Vile,
[1:48:54] when I call you.
[1:48:59] And Peter followed him a far off under
[1:49:01] the high priest's palace and went in and
[1:49:04] sat with the servants to see the end.
[1:49:08] He wasn't rejoicing. He wasn't dancing
[1:49:11] in the spirit.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying, "Hear ye me.
[1:49:19] And Peter sat without in the palace and
[1:49:21] a damsel young lady cometh to him and
[1:49:24] said, "Thou also was with Jesus of
[1:49:26] Galilee."
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; And he denied it.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; He denied before them all. Say, "I know
[1:49:32] not what you're saying."
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; You think he's forgotten, saying,
[1:49:40] "They're the Christ,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God."
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; No, he didn't forget that. Listen
[1:49:48] friends, I don't know how this going to
[1:49:50] end up, but it was just in another
[1:49:52] season.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; But that revelation
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; would hold him through anything. Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And after a while came unto him, they
[1:50:13] that stood by and said to Peter, "Surely
[1:50:15] thou art one of them, for your speech
[1:50:18] betrayeth you." You have a little
[1:50:19] different language.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; You talk about Revelation 10. You talk
[1:50:25] about the cloud. You talk about other
[1:50:28] things. You talk about the seven church
[1:50:30] ages. You talk about stuff that I know
[1:50:33] that it's identified with him.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; And he denied it. And Peter said, "Man,
[1:50:38] I know not what you're saying."
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And immediately while he spake, the
[1:50:43] crew
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; and the Lord turned
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; and just looked upon Peter.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; And Peter remembered the word of the
[1:50:55] Lord.
[1:51:06] Think about it.
[1:51:09] And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
[1:51:14] After the news of the resurrection and
[1:51:16] the women
[1:51:18] came,
[1:51:21] Peter rose and ran to the sephiler
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; and stooping down and he beheld the
[1:51:27] linen clothes laid by themselves and he
[1:51:29] departed wandering in himself at that
[1:51:31] which it had happened. The seasons are
[1:51:33] changing.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Both in this world and in the unseen
[1:51:39] world.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Now, if you ever prayed, pray for
[1:51:42] yourself right now. Say, "God, lift me
[1:51:45] up so I can see
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; what brother Ed is succumbing to."
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Angels are descending.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Here's Peter. He's just wept. He denied
[1:51:56] the Lord and he's gone out. I'm a
[1:51:58] failure
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; and are filled with fear and
[1:52:03] disillusionment.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Not just when Christ was there 2,000
[1:52:08] years ago. I'm up to today. I'm not even
[1:52:11] back just when the prophet spoke when he
[1:52:13] spoke and took the and took his second
[1:52:17] last service
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; and spoke to you and me
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; from Luke 24
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; and called it a prophecy.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make another announcement
[1:52:28] today. You are living the fulfillment of
[1:52:32] that prophecy.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; They had the deniers. Yes,
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; they had the spirit of Judas. Don't
[1:52:41] think that passed away with Judas.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That'll be even more prevalent
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; in this time.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; They had leaders, religious leaders,
[1:52:52] scholars of the word, and they believed
[1:52:54] exactly the same thing. They were
[1:52:56] completely the political system. Even
[1:52:59] Herod and and Pilate, they became
[1:53:02] friends over this denial of Jesus
[1:53:04] Christ. All this confusion had to happen
[1:53:07] at that time and must be today as well.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; And I have another announcement to make
[1:53:16] to one and to all.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; You have no business
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; becoming consumed with that.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Just because you can tap stuff,
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; but just because you're accessed
[1:53:27] digitally, you have no business being
[1:53:30] connected to that stuff.
[1:53:33] You have no business feeding on
[1:53:35] unbelief.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that in the name of the Lord
[1:53:39] Jesus Christ,
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; you forget it and leave it behind.
[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; You know it only brings a cloud of
[1:53:51] doubt,
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; a cloud of disappointment to you. You
[1:53:55] have no business feeding on it. You have
[1:53:57] no business answering it. Did Jesus ever
[1:54:00] talk about Judas again? Did he ever talk
[1:54:02] about all his other Did he talk about
[1:54:04] Ananas the high priest? Did he talk
[1:54:06] about all these that brought
[1:54:08] accusations? They don't even name the
[1:54:10] people who brought false accus. And two
[1:54:13] witnesses came in. You don't even know
[1:54:15] who they are. They're not important
[1:54:17] enough for this book.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And if they're not important enough for
[1:54:22] this book, they have no place in your
[1:54:24] mind.
[1:54:36] the seasons were changing.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about now.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about right now.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; And you probably you may not know any
[1:54:45] more than Peter knew.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't know angels
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; were stirring in heaven,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; in another world,
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; in another place.
[1:55:00] Angels were being dispatched
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; and gathered
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; and instructed
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; this is what you'll say and this is
[1:55:08] where you'll go.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; You're not going to go to some great
[1:55:12] victory revival. You're going to go to a
[1:55:14] tomb
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and you're going to talk to people who
[1:55:20] come there to to treat the dead
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; and you're going to tell them
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; this is what you're going to say. He's
[1:55:28] risen.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Angels dispatched. They didn't know it.
[1:55:34] The season was changing.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; And we talk about a prophet of God and
[1:55:42] an angel of God was with them and so on.
[1:55:45] That angel stayed with this message all
[1:55:48] the way through the years because I knew
[1:55:51] that that angel, that angel of God who's
[1:55:54] none other than Jesus Christ, is going
[1:55:56] to call a people by this voice.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; It'll be his voice.
[1:56:04] [Applause]
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Marilyn, I thought of the song that
[1:56:08] Marilyn was inspired. Samuel
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; heard a voice
[1:56:14] from a supernatural place.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; I said, Ed,
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; I've heard a voice
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; from a supernatural place.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Lazarus
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; heard the same.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Though he was in the grave.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God in this generation
[1:56:36] says, "A roll call in heaven."
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; A roll call in heaven. Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; And that master's voice.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; He said even the atoms are changing.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; And that's what transition is.
[1:56:51] Transition can be a changing of
[1:56:53] molecular change, a change of the atoms.
[1:56:56] And this prophet said there'll be a
[1:56:58] sweep
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; go over you
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and you'll change in your atoms.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; That's also that sayith the Lord.
[1:57:09] We who are alive and remain.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep,
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; but we'll be caught up together.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Not in this old carcass.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; We're in a transformation time.
[1:57:23] [Music]
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; yes, we are.
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, Lord.
[1:57:33] And while the disciples
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; are fearful
[1:57:38] and appear to be in disarray,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; their leader and captain of their faith
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; is empty out paradise.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; While they were locked up,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; hiding themselves,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; the very one that they were crying and
[1:57:57] weeping over
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; was emptying out paradise.
[1:58:02] Hallelujah.
[1:58:03] [Applause]
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; You shout if you want.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; This is the most glorious thing.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; While they were hiding,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus was bringing them out of their
[1:58:14] hiding
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; and bringing them into
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; And they were seen of many. The bodies,
[1:58:23] the bodies of the saints were seen in
[1:58:26] the streets of Jerusalem.
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:31] To whom?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Not to all the people,
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; but to those
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; that were elected
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; before time.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Is this what I'm in?
[1:58:48] This what you're in, brother John?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; This is what you're in. But Stephen had
[1:58:53] nothing to do with SFU. Right.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; That's why God had you born where you
[1:58:59] are.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; That's why God had you hear what you
[1:59:03] heard.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; And why? What's happening? What come to
[1:59:12] you, brother Bisc? What the Holy Spirit
[1:59:13] speak to me? It was the merging
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; of two worlds.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; The one that you hear on tape when the
[1:59:20] prophet says, "I'm in two worlds." That
[1:59:22] one is merging with this one.
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, girls. When there were
[1:59:30] more ladies ever called them than men,
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; more ladies came before the prophet of
[1:59:35] God. One lady after another after
[1:59:37] another after another than a man, then
[1:59:39] more ladies
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; because their spirits are more tender
[1:59:42] and more
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; closer to the surface.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; He can speak to you.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why ladies had to go to the
[1:59:50] tomb. Maybe that's why ladies had to
[1:59:53] first hear the angels speak.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; And the angels tell him, "Go and tell
[1:59:57] the men.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Go and tell these great apostles,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not here.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; He's not here.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He's risen."
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; But the merging of two worlds were
[2:00:07] coming
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; into place. Already the dead and risen
[2:00:11] were walking in the streets of
[2:00:13] Jerusalem.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And the people didn't know. They didn't
[2:00:18] know because uh the transition now was
[2:00:21] coming to a crashing climax, a vortex,
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; and there's no way for them to know the
[2:00:29] resurrection had happened.
[2:00:37] And Jesus, that one
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; knew
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; who he had spoken. This timeless one who
[2:00:45] had spoken.
[2:00:50] Now we're not
[2:00:52] ignorant
[2:00:54] and we won't be slow.
[2:01:00] when you see the days of Noah again
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; and when you see the days of Sodom and
[2:01:08] Gomorrah
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; and you be careful now how you respond
[2:01:13] to that
[2:01:15] because if you say we are there
[2:01:19] then the rest of it has to be there
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; even thus shall it be
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; when the son of man is revealed. Amen.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; And it'll be the same.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; As when Naomi said to uh to to Ruth,
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; you lay there till the morning.
[2:01:40] And once he rises, once he starts, he's
[2:01:42] not going to stop.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; This process is going to continue
[2:01:46] straight on
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; until you're married,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; until you're pregnantated,
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; until you're bringing forth the lineage
[2:01:52] of the kings.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Are you able to grasp that?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; That is why we had to have thus sayaith
[2:02:07] the Lord.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Not to hear it here
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; and to hold it here,
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; but receive it down into the womb of our
[2:02:15] soul.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Transforming power.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your dilemma is.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your weakness is. This
[2:02:25] word is greater than that.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew.
[2:02:37] He knew that his faithful messenger
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; right at the end of his life.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to be told and instructed
[2:02:45] said now you have six or eight hours to
[2:02:47] speak. He didn't have to be told that.
[2:02:49] He's going to get up and speak what God
[2:02:51] gives him to speak. Right?
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; He's going to go in the scripture where
[2:02:55] he's supposed to go.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; So he goes to Luke 24
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; and he's going to call it what he's
[2:03:01] supposed to call it,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; modern events.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Made clear
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; by prophecy.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Read it.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; And say it's a prophecy. What's
[2:03:15] happening there? Peter's there.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Peter's in that prophecy. You're here.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's there in the prophecy. You're
[2:03:23] here fulfilling it.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't know what was happening. You
[2:03:27] don't know what's happening.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; There's a merging of two worlds at that
[2:03:31] time. There's a merging of two worlds.
[2:03:33] That's why God sent you a messenger that
[2:03:35] would say over and over,
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; dozens of times.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I'm in two worlds.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; This is the sign of the resurrection.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, this is the sign of the
[2:03:50] Messiah. Amen.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Who can do this? Nobody but the Messiah.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And that's why this that's why brother
[2:03:58] Brown said it's not me.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Now you have a certain feeling. Not
[2:04:05] because of me. I'm your brother.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; But it's because of him who's here.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Who is him?
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; And where is him
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; now?
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Today
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; in this service,
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, where is he?
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Would you like to say so?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And he's indwelling me.
[2:04:34] Amen.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; I call this the paradox of all
[2:04:47] paradoxes.
[2:04:51] And you may be in it or you may be part
[2:04:52] of it right now.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, did you hear what's happening
[2:04:56] down here? Did you hear what's
[2:04:58] happening?" No, I didn't hear. I don't
[2:05:00] need to hear.
[2:05:02] And I have no desire to hear.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Why would you want to hear?
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Do you get a revelation from it?
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Do you get stimulated by it?
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Of course not. right now.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't realize
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; that. And here's my words. Two worlds
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; almost merging.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Help me brothers.
[2:05:47] I I went back into the very meetings I
[2:05:50] was in.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; You have it on tape.
[2:05:56] Almost every time I'm in a message, I
[2:05:58] scroll to the end because I'm and that's
[2:06:02] why I was so moved. I said, "I love you,
[2:06:05] Lord.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; I just love you so much
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; to think that you would even take time
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; and use this vessel. Let him just become
[2:06:16] so weakened over the visions
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; to tell a person you have sinus or this.
[2:06:21] And we're not here just to repeat those
[2:06:24] things.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Those things were done that you might
[2:06:27] know.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; He came to call your name through that.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; And something along the way, if it
[2:06:36] hasn't happened, may it happen now. And
[2:06:38] I know that there are those where it
[2:06:40] needs to happen to you.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. It needs to happen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; He'll hide you in the tabernacle or in
[2:06:50] the secret of his tabernacle.
[2:06:53] You must identify
[2:06:56] where this Christ is.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; And he gave the sign. He gave it
[2:07:02] abundantly.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; God could say, "What more can I do?"
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; What more can I do?
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:07:13] Hallelujah.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for becoming so personal. If
[2:07:22] you were God, what would you do?
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to come, you're going to
[2:07:29] bring the world to judgment.
[2:07:32] What would you do
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; if you were the Almighty?
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Creator of heaven. What would you do? I
[2:07:39] said, 'Well,
[2:07:41] I think I'll I'll send my most faithful
[2:07:44] servant,
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; my most faithful prophet,
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; that I was ever able
[2:07:51] ever raised up,
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; one that stood by me,
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; the spirit of Elijah.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; I did send him before I came in the form
[2:08:02] of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; I sent him.
[2:08:06] What a bold, brave man he was.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; And he just he wouldn't compromise on
[2:08:14] anything.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; And he only ministered for a few months
[2:08:19] and they cast him into prison.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; And then a little girl, 8 years old, I
[2:08:24] believe she was, she danced,
[2:08:27] did a little jigging.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And the king has just caught up and
[2:08:32] says, "I'll give you half of the
[2:08:33] kingdom. What do you ask?
[2:08:36] Mommy, what should I ask for? Ask for
[2:08:39] John the John the Baptist head
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; on a charger.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist head because that's
[2:08:48] where his mouth was.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; And the conviction which he held
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; was worth more than half the kingdom.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Where's that king? Where's that girl?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Where's that woman? They're gone.
[2:09:05] But the spirit that was on John the
[2:09:07] Baptist and his testimony lives on.
[2:09:11] [Applause]
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; The world can say what they wish to say
[2:09:15] about you, but the truth shall prevail
[2:09:17] every time.
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Daniel.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; You keep pressing on.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:32] This is a great revelation at this time.
[2:09:34] We're in the merging of two worlds.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why your messenger, not me.
[2:09:39] Your messenger
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; was constantly being pressed from one
[2:09:44] world to another.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; You see him on deep call to the deep.
[2:09:48] He's shaking his head because he doesn't
[2:09:51] know if he's over there or here.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; I can't even tell you what goes on in my
[2:10:03] heart right now.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; I was being crushed.
[2:10:18] I was literally crushed as a young man
[2:10:24] who's 27.
[2:10:30] I was your age, Daniel. Jessica,
[2:10:35] I was your age, Philillip.
[2:10:44] That's why I can relate to Peter.
[2:10:47] I thought everything going sideways.
[2:10:51] Yeah,
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't have enough to feed my family.
[2:10:56] And I just tell you, what a paradox.
[2:11:00] I just taken the lowest, most
[2:11:03] cumbersome, most dirty job you could
[2:11:06] imagine.
[2:11:09] Listen, kids.
[2:11:11] I washed floors.
[2:11:13] I polished floors for little widows in
[2:11:17] Victoria.
[2:11:20] I washed walls
[2:11:23] in businessmen's offices
[2:11:29] and I was barely getting enough to put
[2:11:31] bread and food on the table,
[2:11:34] but I had a burden to go to the native
[2:11:36] Indian people
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; and I was going to do that above all
[2:11:41] things.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Why? I don't know why.
[2:11:48] And now I wrote I wrote I I do go
[2:11:51] brother Vanom. I wrote a wrote him a
[2:11:53] letter
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; and he responded and ended up I'm up in
[2:11:58] the mountains. In the meantime
[2:12:00] I have I have two things that are
[2:12:03] crushing my heart. And one is a certain
[2:12:06] church organization, which I won't name,
[2:12:09] was trying to
[2:12:12] persuade the people of the church that
[2:12:14] I'd resigned from to vote the property
[2:12:16] and brand new church we had just built
[2:12:19] into their organization just by a vote
[2:12:22] and take it all. How low,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; how corrupt,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; rather than give and build it
[2:12:30] themselves,
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; take it.
[2:12:33] And one of the deacons called me
[2:12:39] to was Cindy Bergen's dad.
[2:12:42] He was my deacon, one of them. And he
[2:12:45] called me.
[2:12:47] And he said, "If you're going to save
[2:12:48] this church, you better get up here.
[2:12:53] We're losing it."
[2:12:59] But Tim knows the church.
[2:13:04] And I did go up and I spoke to some of
[2:13:06] the people
[2:13:08] and I spoke to the young pastor
[2:13:11] who was filling in for my
[2:13:13] brother-in-law, brother Brena.
[2:13:18] And my my sister,
[2:13:22] not Anne, but my other younger sister.
[2:13:24] She was in great great need.
[2:13:28] That was her son that text me this
[2:13:32] morning.
[2:13:44] I appreciate you bearing with me.
[2:13:50] It didn't come to me while I was in the
[2:13:51] study.
[2:13:53] She was carrying that boy that text me
[2:13:56] this morning for the first time. I don't
[2:13:59] remember him ever texting me. She was
[2:14:02] carrying him
[2:14:05] when this happened.
[2:14:12] And because of my job, because of
[2:14:15] because of responsibilities of mortal
[2:14:17] life this season,
[2:14:21] I had to leave the whole group that were
[2:14:23] up hunting. I had to leave them. I had
[2:14:24] arranged everything and all the rest of
[2:14:26] it, but I couldn't stay. I had to leave.
[2:14:32] It's magnificent place, but I won't talk
[2:14:34] about that. I'll talk about the morning
[2:14:37] I woke up and I was leaving everybody.
[2:14:39] And we were about 25 miles into the
[2:14:42] wilderness. Listen friends, my name
[2:14:44] isn't Peter, but this is my story.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Peter had his low moments, and this was
[2:14:51] mine.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; And here here I've got a a man that I
[2:14:57] understand as a prophet of God, Brother
[2:14:59] John. I'm not I haven't experienced very
[2:15:02] much. It's like it's like Peter was
[2:15:06] called and he left his boat and Matson
[2:15:08] went
[2:15:13] and he sees these great things happening
[2:15:15] and I was in the meetings and I saw
[2:15:16] these great things happening and I feel
[2:15:19] so privileged I'm able to take him
[2:15:22] and now right in my hour of need
[2:15:26] I have to leave
[2:15:28] and I am
[2:15:31] in capital letters crushed. Absolutely
[2:15:34] crushed.
[2:15:36] Had two things on my heart. My sister
[2:15:40] and the church that I built
[2:15:43] and we're there one week and I'm not
[2:15:45] able to get even a word in edgewise
[2:15:49] and and brother Bram and I and another
[2:15:51] brother Fred Soffman are sleeping in a
[2:15:53] tent off to the side. I always it's the
[2:15:55] only time I ever slept in another
[2:15:56] another tent. I always slept in the cook
[2:15:58] house in a cook tent.
[2:16:02] And so we finished breakfast
[2:16:05] and I I had said to brother Southwick, I
[2:16:08] said, "Brother Bud,
[2:16:10] will Blaine, will you send Blaine out
[2:16:12] with me?"
[2:16:17] I had to ride 25 miles on a horse,
[2:16:21] crossing rivers
[2:16:23] maybe 15 or 20 times.
[2:16:27] And sometime you cross a a great valley
[2:16:30] and and and and I didn't know where the
[2:16:33] trail was and going down the gravel
[2:16:38] the the gravel bar or the sand bar I
[2:16:40] could maybe see tracks but in the gravel
[2:16:42] bar I couldn't see anything there.
[2:16:43] Grizzlies all over all kinds of animals.
[2:16:48] And I woke up in the morning and we were
[2:16:50] in a snowstorm,
[2:16:52] terrible snowstorm.
[2:16:55] And I said to brother Bud, I said,
[2:16:56] 'Well, aren't you going to send Blaine
[2:16:59] with me? And he said, 'N no. I said,
[2:17:00] 'You know, the horse knows his way back.
[2:17:04] Well, folks, I've been around horses.
[2:17:07] I've had them walk into the trees, you
[2:17:09] know, they would just walk into the bush
[2:17:12] and come before a tree and just stand
[2:17:13] there
[2:17:15] waiting for me to give them some
[2:17:17] direction.
[2:17:18] I thought if the horse walks into the
[2:17:20] into the jungle and and wants some
[2:17:23] direction, I won't know which way to go.
[2:17:25] And I'm 25, 30 miles
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to ride in this snow and I
[2:17:31] go into my tent and I'm alone and I'm
[2:17:34] rolling up my sleeping bag.
[2:17:38] Those of you that have the picture of
[2:17:40] Brother Brandham,
[2:17:44] that happened the night before,
[2:17:48] you just have to excuse me. I'm not I'm
[2:17:50] not emotional because I'm emotional
[2:17:52] because of what he did.
[2:17:56] And I'm rolling up my sleeping bag and
[2:17:58] this big flakes of snow, just huge
[2:18:02] flakes of snow. You can't even see. You
[2:18:04] can't see hardly anything. And I
[2:18:06] thought, I'm going to ride out in this.
[2:18:08] And here's my friend, my good friend,
[2:18:11] and he's going to send me out of this
[2:18:12] wilderness on a horse
[2:18:15] through country. I don't have a clue
[2:18:17] where I'm going. You're going to head
[2:18:19] them down a there's no path as such.
[2:18:22] He's going to find his way out of this
[2:18:24] Rocky Mountain trench.
[2:18:27] And I'm rolling up my sleeping bag and
[2:18:29] the flaps open.
[2:18:31] And on his hands and knees comes brother
[2:18:34] Brandham.
[2:18:37] And he sits cross-legged like so. And he
[2:18:39] sits down.
[2:18:44] He said, "Really sorry to see you go,
[2:18:47] brother Eddie."
[2:18:49] Yeah. And I'm just barely holding myself
[2:18:53] together
[2:18:55] and I'm rolling up my sleeping bag.
[2:18:59] Oh, he said, ' It'd be nice if you could
[2:19:01] just stay here and the sun would come
[2:19:03] out and be nice and warm and we'd just
[2:19:07] stay up here about a month.
[2:19:10] And I bit my lip,
[2:19:12] don't do this to me, Brother Brandham.
[2:19:17] My heart is already broken
[2:19:20] and I got to leave and I'm not even
[2:19:22] didn't even have a chance. I arranged
[2:19:23] this hunt. I did all his work and came
[2:19:26] up here and now I can't even
[2:19:29] ask him about my burden.
[2:19:32] He said it would be nice and warm. We'd
[2:19:34] just stay up here maybe a month or so
[2:19:37] and you know we'd find some big rams up
[2:19:40] on the mountain and
[2:19:42] and that's just when I was my lip was
[2:19:44] trembling I suppose. I don't know but I
[2:19:46] was just breaking inside.
[2:19:49] Then then he just changed.
[2:19:52] He said but I know how it is. He said,
[2:19:54] "You're married and you have children.
[2:19:58] Now he stepped into mortal life.
[2:20:04] This is a season of mortal life.
[2:20:07] You have children. You've got
[2:20:09] responsibilities.
[2:20:11] You have to go to work."
[2:20:13] But he said, "But I know all about your
[2:20:16] sister and your church.
[2:20:23] and eternal
[2:20:26] the immortal world just came and merged
[2:20:29] with this one
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; in an instant
[2:20:34] and I knew that wasn't him. It wasn't
[2:20:36] William Brham that knew all about him,
[2:20:38] but someone else was speaking.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; And soon as he said that, I know all
[2:20:44] about your sister
[2:20:47] and the church in Dawson Creek. He said,
[2:20:54] "Why did I tell you that this morning?
[2:20:58] I want to say to you, I I love you all.
[2:21:02] That one
[2:21:05] who spoke to me when I thought that he
[2:21:06] was a million miles away and I thought
[2:21:08] that my troubles were
[2:21:10] so enormous
[2:21:13] nobody could solve them.
[2:21:17] Nobody even knew about them.
[2:21:23] I'm here to tell you that one
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; that one who spoke is closer to you than
[2:21:29] you dare think.
[2:21:33] And he's trying to tell you something
[2:21:34] this morning.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; The message that you have believed,
[2:21:39] I declare to you in the name of Jesus
[2:21:41] Christ,
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; that world, he said, I go to prepare a
[2:21:45] place for you.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; And that world, I'll send my messenger
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; and he'll declare these things.
[2:21:55] And now just before he leaves
[2:21:58] and you think we were all rejoicing. I
[2:22:00] was here in Vancouver when I got a phone
[2:22:02] call from a old friend of mine said
[2:22:05] William Brandham's been in a car
[2:22:06] accident. They don't expect him to live
[2:22:11] and I was getting ready to go with him.
[2:22:15] I was on a plane in Toronto
[2:22:18] and I don't know whether he's going to
[2:22:21] live or not.
[2:22:24] Sometimes the bottom, it's like the
[2:22:26] bottom falls out of things. But does
[2:22:29] Jesus care?
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, he cares.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I can tell you he has
[2:22:34] the answer
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; for every single person in this place.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; He was so concerned. He could tell me
[2:22:41] exactly about where all these things and
[2:22:44] what was troubling me. And he said, "I
[2:22:46] know about it."
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; And I look over this congregation. I
[2:22:50] know there are things that perhaps you
[2:22:53] can't even begin to describe to anybody.
[2:22:55] Maybe not your wife or your closest
[2:22:57] friend,
[2:23:00] but he knows
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; this one and this world. And I felt I
[2:23:06] felt
[2:23:09] responsible this morning. I felt this
[2:23:11] morning that I was to come and announce
[2:23:13] to you
[2:23:16] that he on behalf of him, he has already
[2:23:18] sent his messenger. Amen.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; And expressed through him that this is
[2:23:25] that time.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; This is that hour. And he knew that he
[2:23:28] was just here to run through it. And he
[2:23:31] ran his race finished
[2:23:34] and left a message for the people.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; And the elect will hear the call
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; and they won't know why they heard it.
[2:23:44] They won't they won't know how sometimes
[2:23:46] to even respond. and and and and and
[2:23:50] maybe things in this mortal life make
[2:23:53] you feel like giving up.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; But to the elect,
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make you elect, but to
[2:24:01] the elect, they can't give up.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; They cannot surrender it.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; And you may not realize it, but all the
[2:24:11] things that have were right precise
[2:24:14] exactly where we're supposed to be.
[2:24:17] people raise up and they have all kinds
[2:24:19] of ideas and all kinds of thoughts and
[2:24:23] ah it's this way it's that way
[2:24:26] be at peace
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; and right in the middle of this I'm not
[2:24:30] done preaching I'm just finishing I'm
[2:24:32] just winding up listen very closely and
[2:24:35] right I if I stayed with this Peter one
[2:24:38] of the next things he heard was
[2:24:41] after he heard the women and now they're
[2:24:42] all troubled next thing he hears is a
[2:24:45] voice saying, "Peace
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; be unto you."
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; And I felt so compelled
[2:24:54] of the Holy Spirit to say to this
[2:24:56] audience this morning, "Peace
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; be unto you
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; in the world."
[2:25:05] In the world, you'll have tribulation,
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; but don't fear.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; I've overcome the world.
[2:25:13] Amen.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Would you bow your head with me?
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Our precious Lord Jesus. What a delight
[2:25:27] it is
[2:25:29] to know you whom to know is life
[2:25:33] eternal.
[2:25:37] I'm so grateful to you for having
[2:25:40] you having made known yourself.
[2:25:44] the very tabernacle of God
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; and making known to us the secret of
[2:25:51] your tabernacle. How you have embodied
[2:25:53] yourself in your word and have given
[2:25:56] something that we call a message.
[2:25:59] But to us, it's not just some words.
[2:26:03] It's not some books. It's not some
[2:26:05] tapes. They can't contain
[2:26:09] everything that the almighty God
[2:26:13] is and what you would make known to us
[2:26:18] and how you would you would reveal
[2:26:20] yourself to us, Lord. And you have a
[2:26:22] selected portion for every person.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; And I look over this audience and see
[2:26:28] the balcony and the people sitting here
[2:26:32] and they even from children
[2:26:36] to those oh God who are faced with
[2:26:39] decisions
[2:26:41] I pray father in the name of Jesus in
[2:26:45] the name of Jesus you've experienced
[2:26:48] Lord all of these things and Peter who I
[2:26:51] spoke of which was one of your great
[2:26:53] apostles
[2:26:55] and he it was that stood on the day of
[2:26:57] Pentecost and he began to declare
[2:27:00] he began to declare
[2:27:03] now this indwelling the same spirit that
[2:27:05] was in you that raised you from the dead
[2:27:07] now is in them.
[2:27:10] And now at the end of the at the end of
[2:27:12] the age, here we are at the end of the
[2:27:14] days
[2:27:16] and we're certainly we have identified
[2:27:17] the day that we're living in. What a
[2:27:19] what a wicked and vile time it is. How
[2:27:22] how dark it is. And is the world filled
[2:27:25] with violence? And we will say yes. Is
[2:27:29] there perversion everywhere? We will say
[2:27:31] yes, there is. Then be it known unto you
[2:27:34] that this is the day when the son of man
[2:27:36] will be revealed and you have been
[2:27:38] revealed and we have seen you Lord. We
[2:27:40] see you in all the beauty of your word
[2:27:43] and we can say once again the father has
[2:27:48] revealed to us Jesus Christ and you are
[2:27:53] absolutely wonderful.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; You are so beautiful. So wonderful,
[2:27:59] Lord.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; And we're just here to give thanks to
[2:28:02] you.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you for remembering my name.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you for calling us by name, oh
[2:28:08] God.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; And our name that was perhaps given to
[2:28:11] us by a loving father and mother. We do
[2:28:13] not know who, but you called us by
[2:28:16] another name. You called us by what we
[2:28:18] were supposed to be and called to be.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; And now we love you, Lord. We love you.
[2:28:24] And I just pray that you will help us in
[2:28:26] the rest of this service. We're thinking
[2:28:28] of Brother Kyle and Sister Christina on
[2:28:32] the island and the saints there,
[2:28:35] Brother John going down to Seattle and
[2:28:39] Reon.
[2:28:40] And I pray, oh God, let this presence,
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; let this divine one,
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, be amongst them. Would you please?
[2:28:49] I pray that you'll walk into that
[2:28:52] gathering room. Amen.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; And tonight when we gather here and our
[2:28:56] brother Tim Dodd will stand to minister.
[2:28:58] Father, I know not what you've given him
[2:29:00] to say, but I want to be spoken to.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; And help us, oh God. I'm praying for
[2:29:06] this congregation of people at this uh
[2:29:10] conclusion, this conclusion of time, at
[2:29:13] this merging of the worlds. Help us to
[2:29:16] be Lord aware of the unseen. Help us to
[2:29:20] look upon the unseen. Help us to look
[2:29:23] upon the prize, oh God, of the high
[2:29:26] calling in Christ Jesus,
[2:29:28] oh Father, if there's any here that
[2:29:32] don't know you and would want to know
[2:29:34] you. You will make yourself known to
[2:29:36] them. I know you will. I pray, Father,
[2:29:39] you'll give them the courage.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; There may be others, Father, needing to
[2:29:45] be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; You're the baptizer.
[2:29:50] You're the only one that can do it. The
[2:29:53] needs are as many as we are as
[2:29:55] individuals. I pray you'll come to each
[2:29:58] one of us. Lord, I have my own personal
[2:30:00] need and I pray, Father, that you will
[2:30:04] minister to me today in Jesus Christ's
[2:30:08] name. Amen.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Wonder if we can have the musicians.
[2:30:13] Yes.
[2:30:17] You could stand if you would.
[2:30:26] Could we sing
[2:30:28] Christ the transforming
[2:30:31] light?
[2:30:36] [Music]
[2:30:40] Just be patient for a little bit, would
[2:30:42] you today, please?
[2:30:44] [Music]
[2:31:02] Yeah, we sickness.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing a dorser or two of this.
[2:31:18] touches his heart
[2:31:21] of mine.
[2:31:23] Is he touching it? Piercing
[2:31:27] the darkness,
[2:31:33] making his glory
[2:31:37] shine.
[2:31:39] Listen to this prayer now. Oh,
[2:31:45] his grace
[2:31:49] causing the world to see.
[2:31:57] Love that will
[2:32:02] shall go.
[2:32:05] Jesus revealing
[2:32:09] me.
[2:32:10] Second verse. Now
[2:32:13] here Lord I pray my heart
[2:32:18] [Music]
[2:32:22] my strength.
[2:32:26] Will you lay it all down now
[2:32:36] with all my spirit
[2:32:42] [Music]
[2:32:45] to
[2:32:46] his gra
[2:32:50] [Music]
[2:32:54] to
[2:32:58] Love that will
[2:33:01] still
[2:33:03] shall
[2:33:06] Jesus re.
[2:33:09] [Music]
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing this third verse.
[2:33:16] [Music]
[2:33:20] Life is no longer mine.
[2:33:24] Maybe you need to make that kind of a
[2:33:25] dedication. You can do it in your seat.
[2:33:29] You might want to stand and gather
[2:33:30] around the
[2:33:32] pulpit here. Whatever.
[2:33:36] Just between you and God.
[2:33:40] I would like these words somehow to sink
[2:33:42] down.
[2:33:44] Lay hold of the secret part of your own
[2:33:46] soul. Life is no longer mine.
[2:33:52] I want to say it. I want the Edis to
[2:33:55] say, I yield it all to thee.
[2:34:00] Fill me that I may shine
[2:34:03] [Music]
[2:34:05] until thy face I see.
[2:34:11] I know, friends. I I wouldn't be a true
[2:34:13] friend of yours if I didn't say I know
[2:34:15] that there are those here
[2:34:19] who haven't arrived there yet.
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:34:26] And maybe you want to make that kind of
[2:34:28] a declaration.
[2:34:30] Maybe you want to maybe you want to say
[2:34:32] before this assembly of people,
[2:34:36] I'm praying and I'm yearning that these
[2:34:39] words will in fact take place today in
[2:34:42] my life.
[2:34:44] And if you'd like to, if you wish to do
[2:34:46] that, I give you this opportunity.
[2:34:48] There's no pull.
[2:34:50] I'm not going to try to persuade you.
[2:34:53] Let it be between you and and this Lord
[2:34:55] Jesus.
[2:34:57] And I want to say because I'm just
[2:34:59] closing now.
[2:35:01] I want it known to you.
[2:35:04] Today was not just another service.
[2:35:08] Today God was announcing to you that we
[2:35:11] are in the midst of a transition. We are
[2:35:14] in the midst of a change of the seasons.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; This is another season of revelation.
[2:35:22] This is not the season where we just
[2:35:23] attend church.
[2:35:25] There's a season. And now you might say,
[2:35:28] "Well, I don't feel anything." There
[2:35:29] were many that were right in Brother
[2:35:30] Brandham's meetings and never felt
[2:35:32] anything. There were many that listened
[2:35:33] to Jesus Christ that didn't feel
[2:35:35] anything. Don't wait till you feel
[2:35:36] something.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Wait till you hear something. I've heard
[2:35:40] it. Now I am responding to that.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; I've held certain ideas or I've held
[2:35:45] certain things or certain feelings or
[2:35:47] whatever more. I I don't care about
[2:35:49] those. It could be about me or anybody
[2:35:51] else that's irrelevant to me. My concern
[2:35:54] is for you.
[2:35:57] [Music]
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; The season of this mortal life
[2:36:08] is merging with the immortal. I'm
[2:36:11] convinced of that.
[2:36:14] And we say there'll be a rapture.
[2:36:15] There'll be a rapture. There will indeed
[2:36:17] be a rapture. And that could happen
[2:36:20] before this service is even concluded
[2:36:22] and over.
[2:36:24] It'll not be the way we figured it out,
[2:36:27] but it will happen the way he intended
[2:36:29] it to be.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; May God have his way. We'll sing this
[2:36:33] verse together and then we're going to
[2:36:35] close soon after that.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; Life is no longer mine.
[2:36:45] So
[2:36:48] [Music]
[2:36:52] I
[2:36:55] totally
[2:36:57] [Music]
[2:37:15] Oh,
[2:37:17] [Music]
[2:37:24] the world to see
[2:37:29] [Music]
[2:37:31] that will
[2:37:32] [Music]
[2:37:35] Now
[2:37:38] Jesus
[2:37:47] came
[2:37:50] life is no longer mine.
[2:37:53] God bless you dear ones.
[2:37:56] I pray earnestly
[2:37:58] that you'll be so affected and so moved
[2:38:03] that you'll leave this place on another
[2:38:05] plane and on another level
[2:38:08] that you'll never be the same.
[2:38:13] You young people and young men and young
[2:38:15] ladies that have been spending time.
[2:38:18] I prayed for you. I thought I thought of
[2:38:20] you.
[2:38:22] May you come to know him in a dimension
[2:38:25] you never ever ever dreamed of.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; He's much more real.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; He's more than just a prayer service.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; He's more than a youth meeting.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; He's more than a Sunday morning service.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the person. The
[2:38:42] person. Can you take time for this
[2:38:44] person?
[2:38:46] [Music]
[2:38:52] [Music]
[2:38:55] Life is no longer
[2:39:01] [Music]
[2:39:03] I
[2:39:06] toe
[2:39:08] [Music]
[2:39:12] that I may shine.
[2:39:16] [Music]
[2:39:18] until I face my I see
[2:39:26] all to prepare
[2:39:29] his graing
[2:39:32] [Music]
[2:39:35] the world to see
[2:39:42] that will Oh
[2:39:46] shall
[2:39:49] Jesus reveal
[2:39:52] in
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We've come to
[2:39:59] the season of the closing of this time
[2:40:01] that we've gathered together here.
[2:40:04] We'll meet again this evening.
[2:40:07] Others are meeting now. Brother John
[2:40:10] Andy's will be ministered.
[2:40:13] I pray Lord Jesus you'll stand beside
[2:40:15] him
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; and that you'll speak through him
[2:40:20] words that need to be heard by the
[2:40:22] people your beloved in Renton.
[2:40:26] And Lord Jesus for all that are here
[2:40:28] sometimes we do not know exactly how to
[2:40:31] respond.
[2:40:33] [Music]
[2:40:53] I don't know what will take place. I
[2:40:55] don't know what kind of a meeting it
[2:40:56] will be or even if it will be a meeting
[2:40:58] or we will be whether we're at our place
[2:41:01] of duty or at our place of work. Lord,
[2:41:03] whatever it is, but help us, oh God,
[2:41:06] that we do not miss that moment. And as
[2:41:09] your prophet of God was beyond the
[2:41:10] curtain of time and saw the people and
[2:41:13] embraced them and told us of that time
[2:41:15] and exactly what it was like and Lord
[2:41:17] Jesus as you were coming back as it were
[2:41:22] and you came from a resurrected you came
[2:41:24] through a resurrected life and you began
[2:41:27] to speak to the disciples and they were
[2:41:28] filled with such fear and and there were
[2:41:31] so many many questions that were that
[2:41:33] they didn't have answers for but you you
[2:41:35] said to them feel me. It's it's me. is I
[2:41:39] don't be afraid. And Lord, how a prophet
[2:41:41] said so many times he he knew by that
[2:41:44] same voice and the thing that always was
[2:41:47] spoken, fear not. And here we are this
[2:41:49] morning, Lord. And maybe some are
[2:41:51] fearful just to yield to everything. And
[2:41:53] perhaps we don't know exactly how. Be
[2:41:56] tender with us, Lord. I pray. Be patient
[2:41:59] with us, I pray. And just show us the
[2:42:02] best way. Show us the best way, Lord
[2:42:05] Jesus. Help us as we offer ourselves to
[2:42:08] you, I pray. And dismiss us with your
[2:42:11] grace and your blessings. And may your
[2:42:14] presence go with us. And when the people
[2:42:16] close the door of the car and hear it
[2:42:18] shut, may there be that
[2:42:22] such a strange and wonderful holy
[2:42:25] presence that will surround them that
[2:42:28] they might know it is Jesus. It is none
[2:42:32] other than Jesus Christ. the same
[2:42:34] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:42:36] [Music]
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; I ask it in your name. Amen. Amen. I
[2:42:41] wonder if we could sing that chorus. I
[2:42:43] must tell Jesus. I must tell Jesus.
[2:42:46] Let's just sing the chorus together and
[2:42:49] I'll be dismissing you.

[2:53:34] wish. You may. For those that must go,
[2:53:37] you feel free to go.
[2:53:40] I pray that your lives will be entirely
[2:53:42] and eternally different.
[2:53:45] As you lose sight of the mortal season
[2:53:48] and the mortal realm,
[2:53:51] I can tell you when you look around you
[2:53:54] and you see what is taking place in the
[2:53:56] world that is screaming out to the
[2:53:59] believer,
[2:54:00] [Music]
[2:54:02] that whole realm of darkness is fading
[2:54:04] out. And the prophet said it's because
[2:54:06] the light
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; is pressing the darkness back where it
[2:54:11] came from.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.

[2:54:26] again.

[2:54:39] No
[2:54:41] touch. My heart you
