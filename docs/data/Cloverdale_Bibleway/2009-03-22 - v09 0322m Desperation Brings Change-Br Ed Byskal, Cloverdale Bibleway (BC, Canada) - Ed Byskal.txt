Got a couple of requests here this morning we want to pray over. Um, brother Ricardo has a a request for a friend um, uh, the name of Gabe who called this morning, asked for prayer for his wife, Anna, and she just I won't go into all the symptoms, but she's just very sick and she needs a touch from the Lord. Amen. So, want to remember her this morning. We also uh want to uh remember this morning um a couple in brother Dan Olsen's church back east. uh sister Cheryl and brother Matthew um I was Malloy Milot um their daughter six-year-old daughter passed away in the bathtub uh last week. So we want to pray this morning for that family. And if you've got a need this morning, whatever it would be, just lift your hand. Amen. And if you're listening in on the internet, you've got a need this morning, you just ask um the Lord this morning for whatever that need would be. He sees our needs even before we ask, saints. He knows what we need. So, let's just come before him this morning. Amen. Brother John. Lord, we have a desire to worship you this morning, God. something in our souls is just wanting to lift up our hearts, God, and lift up our hands, Lord. These are the hands you've given us. And we want to praise you this morning, Lord. These songs that we've sang, many of the world might sing those same songs, but there must be something different in your heart when the bride begins to lift up their voices, begins to lift up their hearts and sing the same words. It's coming from another person, coming from another group of people because the bride is now coming to your throne and lifting up our hearts. We're lifting up our mouths, our voices, and saying, "Thank you, Jesus, and hallelujah. We thank you, Lord. It must do something to you, Lord, to hear our lives echoing back your word that we thank you, Lord, and we love you and you are more than life to us, Lord. You're everything to us. As the song said, you are more than life to us. You are our life, Lord. You are our satisfaction. You are our joy when we see you, Lord. When we see your face. And even this morning as our brother Rod being so sensitive to your spirit. We also want to be sensitive as worshippers, Lord. We want to come humbly. We want to come thanking you, Lord. and this unthankful generation. We want to be mindful of all your benefits. Lord, for your grace that is sufficient, for your mercies that are new every morning, for health within our bodies, for the Holy Ghost, for a prophet that's come with a message, for a heart that would receive, for a heart that's been turned back. We say, "Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let our voices, Lord, ring into the eternities. We were once were lost and we are found. We were once beggars, but you've made us your wife. You've made us the queen of heaven. We want to say thank you, Lord, for that today. We were once sick, Lord, and by your stripes, you've made us well. And even this morning, there's needs in the body. And we just pray for them today. Hands are up all over the building, God. this need that's come in through our brother Ricardo and I need you today Lord. So many circumstances and situations, issues in individuals lives, but Lord, if we could just touch the hem of your garment, all the years and all the issues and all the things could be dealt with just in a stroke of your hand, God. And this family that's lost their child, be with them today, Lord. So many things around the circumstances, but you know all things, Lord. And you know our lives today. You know the needs that are unspoken all through the building on the internet. Lord, our hearts are standing in silent adoration. That you know all things. You're Jehovah Gyra. Even before we came to this meeting and offered up our lives, you were ready to consume us, Lord. So would you consume every life here today, Lord? Consume our faith that comes before you like an older. We're asking for the rapture cycle, that catching away, for that faith to come upon this congregation today that you would anoint our pastor to speak words of life, words of truth, come to the heart of the matter. Lord, I pray that we would lay aside all the outside things, all the peripheral things, all of our thoughts, Lord, that as we come to worship you in spirit and in truth, that you would be able to come to the soul, blessed Jesus, our Lord, come to our hearts today. And may you do the supernatural. Our hands are lifted up and we're asking for the supernatural to break out upon us, God. Even yet, while we hear the word, you that unseen one would walk up and down these aisles, God, into the nursery, into the fellowship hall, out across the internet waves, on the phone hookup, God, nothing is too great for you. Nothing is too small for you. You know the secrets of our hearts, and we're just quivering. We're just waiting on your appearing, Lord. We love your appearing, God. Oh Jesus, that you would come and feel so welcome. That we would kiss your feet and wash them with our tears. Lord, I pray that there would be something from our heart well up, Lord, that we would love you and receive you and that your word would be precious to us today. Bless this whole day, our brother Jason that is visiting, God, and you would speak through tonight and our pastor this morning. May you just go out today and minister to our souls. And may we minister back to you, Lord, by loving you and believing every word. We take it into our hearts, Lord, and we receive it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. [Music] Want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning. Good to have a Colossus with us from Calgary. Always appreciate fellowshipping with song leaders. Um, one announcement. There's a young people's meeting this Friday night, March the 27th at uh the church here at 7:30. Young people's meeting this Friday night, March 27th. I want to be praying for that. Um, we have a baby dedication here this morning. Brother David and Sister Jana Walner are going to bring their little one. So, while they come, let's sing together. Jesus loves me. This I know for the Bible tells me so. Aren't you glad? Amen. Jesus loves me, this I know. For the Bible tells me so. Little ones to him belong. They are weak, but he is strong. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Isn't this wonderful? &gt;&gt; Be able to have our families raised up in the presence of God as a wonderful heritage. And this is uh Sister Rebecca an this morning. She was born in August of last year. And it's so wonderful when you have brother David and Sister Jana uh having in their hearts to have their children raised and to have them named after uh sisters in the scripture where they have some meaning and some substance. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Rebecca wasn't named after a movie star or an actress. She was named after Rebecca in the scripture. &gt;&gt; We all know Isaac and what a wonderful uh relationship and the supernatural that just surrounded their lives. And Rebecca means to bind or to tie. And her middle name an means favored grace. Favored grace. And how that Rebecca to bind or to tie. We just pray for Rebecca that there would be a a tying and a binding in her heart to favor grace. &gt;&gt; And there was something, brother David and Sister Jana, I just uh fell to my heart when I was reading uh this week in Job. It came to my heart and how that when Job was going through his time of of testing actually disaster, brother Brandham called it when it struck their home and how that the children was all killed and all of uh Job's substance. He was a mighty uh man. And the in the Bible says in Job chapter 1 that he was uh one of the greatest of all the men of the east and how when it came and struck all of his household, his uh sheep, his camels, his oxen and asses as a great household and how it killed even his children. And brother Brandham spoke about that. I I just felt to speak about these things about Job because brother Brandham said God wasn't rebuking Job. He was only purging Job. And he said God had confidence in Job &gt;&gt; and he knew that Job could trust him. And so, Brother Benham spoke about how that when Satan came and God said, "All right, Satan, you go on. He's at your hands, but don't take his life. You can do anything else to him." So, Satan good at his office. Away he goes and he kills all of Job's children. Satan did. And brother Benham said, "I want you to notice a little thing. You remember the last book of Job and how he had all of his oxmen and camels and sheep, they were all restored doublefold." And the last chapter of of Job, you can read that how he was but his children, he had seven sons and three daughters. His children was restored. And brother Brandham said this, God began to restore back to Job. He restored his stock, his animals and livestock and everything double. But did you notice about his children? God restored back Job's children. It didn't say he doubled them, but he restored them to him. And and brother Bam said, "I wonder where they were at." Did you ever take a thought of that and read the book of Job? They were in glory waiting for for him because he had offered a sacrifice under the shed blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God remembered Job's children. And this thought came to me uh brother David and Sister Jana and how that there's something about restoration and redemption in God's heart for special thoughts about our children. And brother Brandham said they were waiting in glory waiting for him because he had offered a sacrifice under the shed blood. And he knowed where they were waiting for him at under the shed blood. &gt;&gt; And he never said he'd give back another bunch of children. But he restored Job's children to him because they were waiting for him under the shed blood of the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking of the power of the blood of bulls and goats. And this is for Rebecca Anna. If the power of the blood of bulls and goats could have that much kind of an effect in Job's family, what can the power of the token &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; in David's life and Janna's life and Jordan and Levi for Rebecca to be able to have an atmosphere and environment that Rebecca can be brought up in of the token life. &gt;&gt; Amen. and that God can restore and give to Rebecca that atmosphere and environment that when she comes of age that there would be something in her that would love Jesus Christ. Let's dedicate her to the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Lord, you're so wonderful to Brother David and Sister Jan and Lori to give them this child. You gave them Jordan and Levi, and now you've blessed their home with a lovely girl, Rebecca Anne, a tie that binds, something that that holds to a grace, a favored grace. this Waldner family, such a rich heritage. And we want to thank you for that, God, today. And Lord, if you can restore Job's children, seven sons and three daughters, surely you can hold this child in the palm of your hand under the power of the token under the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for Rebecca, for her parents that love you and love this message. And this token was for the end time. and they've given their lives to you, Rebecca and Jana, and now they desire to give Rebecca back to you today. I pray that you would bless this child, bless her with health, bless her, bless her, God, with a sound mind and Lord, the atmosphere in her home, Sister Jan and Brother David, that you would just give them grace and leadership and the mind of Christ and watch over this little child, her soul, her spirit, and her body. that is so wonderful to you. We dedicate her to you today, Father, and just pray that the presence of God would be her portion. and that you would walk with her and talk with her. That even at a young age when she begins to sense your presence in her life, even in the services and in her home, that there would be a tenderness and a softness that there would be something towards you, God, at an early time in her youth, that she would seek your face and that she would give her heart to you. Lord, we dedicate Rebecca an to you this morning and pray that your blessing would be upon her life in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanks, brother John. We have a song from the senior choir they're going to sing for us this morning. Maybe they can come as we sing together. Jesus, draw me close, closer, Lord, to you. Jesus, draw me close. Closer Lord to you. Let the world around me fade away. Oh Jesus is drawing closeer Lord to you. [Music] I died to worship and glory. [Music] [Music] It's hard to take the first step when I don't know the way. Each turn is so uncertain. I've learned to walk by faith. Lord, you gave me a promise that you would never leave. You will lead and guide me. And Lord I do believe me Lord [Music] I will follow. Lead me Lord. I will go. You have called me. I will answer. Lead me, Lord. I will go. Your plans for me are perfect. I never need to fear. For though at times I feel alone, I know that you are near. My heart just longs to follow. I'm willing to obey. Take my hand and lead me. I'll follow all the way. [Music] me. &gt;&gt; I will follow &gt;&gt; and I'll follow me. &gt;&gt; I will follow you. You have called me and I will just lead me Lord. I will go. Lead me Lord. &gt;&gt; I will follow. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll follow. &gt;&gt; Lead me Lord. I will you have I will answer in me Lord. I will go. You have called me Lord. I will answer &gt;&gt; me Lord. I will Lord. &gt;&gt; You have called me Lord. &gt;&gt; You have called me. &gt;&gt; You have called me Lord. &gt;&gt; I will. Lead me Lord, I will go. &gt;&gt; Lord, [Music] &gt;&gt; I will. &gt;&gt; We turn to the word. Sing that chorus together. if they could put it up on the screen. Is that your desire to be led of the Lord? [Music] Lord, I will follow [Music] me. I will you [Applause] [Music] will just leave me. I know you have [Music] me. I will stand together. You will lead me [Music] once again. Oh, [Music] heat, heat. I will answer. Lord, I will. Oh, once again, just leave me. I will leave. Heat. Heat. Heat. Leave me alone. I will. Let's just sing it once again while the choir takes their seats. Lead me. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, &gt;&gt; let's just close our eyes and say it again. [Music] I will show you. &gt;&gt; You have called me Lord and I will answer. [Music] With our heads bowed, we say to you, Almighty God, shepherd of Israel, you are our shepherd, the shepherd that goes before the sheep that leads them into green, shady pastures and besides cool waters. And Lord, I'm absolutely convinced that we gathered here this morning needing to come into green pastures, needing a drink from the fountain of God. Oh, Holy Spirit, I pray that you will gently lead us on. And as we have sung in prayerfully, lead me Lord and I will follow. Now take your word for you are that word. Cause my lips to speak that very sentence and that very phrase that will penetrate to the inner being of each individual. Oh God, those that may be in special need, I pray your word will go and meet that need. Whatever it might be, physical or mental or material or especially spiritual, lead us, Lord Jesus. Lead us. Lead me as I stand here at the post of duty. And I pray, Father, that your word and your presence will emphasize this service. Lord, pray, oh God, that you will take our brother Jason Jackson for this evening and prepare him. Lord, prepare our hearts, oh God, for this service. How we thank you that our paths have crossed. And I pray that you will not only make him a great blessing, but make us to be a blessing to him in Jesus Christ's name. Now, may the author come and open the word and interpret it to each heart in Jesus' name. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? We can commit our lives in this time to him. God bless you. If you'd like to take your Bibles, I'll have you turn to the prophet Jeremiah, the 29th chapter. We'll read a few verses. The chapter just previous prior to the 29th chapter is one in which uh Haniah who was also called a prophet prophesied in detail that the that the children of Israel would only be two years in Babylonian bondage. And he was very specific about it and did different signs and took the yoke and broke the yoke and and uh uh Jeremiah standing there and Jeremiah, you know, said amen. &gt;&gt; If that's uh you know, if that's the word of the Lord, he'd say amen to it. And uh uh so he wasn't in in opposition to it in that in in that way. He didn't uh he didn't become argumentative but he just said amen. And uh but then he spoke uh the word of God again. He because God didn't change his mind about his word and he spoke it again and told him it would be 70 years and then told Haniah that he would also die. So we find that in the previous chapter Haniah who had prophesied called him a prophet. He died and his prophecy died with him. Then we come into the 29th chapter and Jeremiah is uh reconfirming what God has said. And I'm going to uh begin at the 10th verse. For thus saith the Lord, that that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you call upon me, and you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and you shall seek me and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll read one verse in Luke the 16th chapter, uh if you'd like to turn to it. It's a very short verse. It's the 16th verse of the 16th chapter. For the law and the prophets were until John. And since that time the kingdom of God is preached, &gt;&gt; and how many men? &gt;&gt; Every man presseth into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God bless the word to us. As you have your seats, we want to greet everyone that is streaming in the other lands, other countries, wherever you might be or whatever time of the day or night it might be. But we just say God bless them as well. And may they receive what uh the Lord has intended for them. and those of you that are here visiting with us and brother Paul Clawson is wife and we're happy to have them here as well. So I want to I want to take a subject uh desperation brings change and uh I have been pondering this subject about change. Change doesn't come very easy. I don't know if you have found it easy. I found change very difficult. Uh and and desperation has a way of making change a little bit easier because when desperation comes or you become desperate about something or you're squeezed into a desperate situation, it can force some changes. It just automatically brings some changes. And so that's why I just thought you might uh register this in your heart that desperation brings uh change and and not always because in this day and age we have a unique way of of kind of accommodating desperate things. We've got a lot of crutches that we can lean on and uh you know uh for for sickness for example and physical ailments we have all kinds of remedies and and hospitals and clinics and all kinds of therapy and every kind of imaginable thing. Uh some are genuine and some are not. that we have those and and of course uh we we use them. Uh but it it would bring what would normally be if you didn't have those or if you were in a country where that wasn't available to you, it would bring you into some desperation. &gt;&gt; It would bring you into some desperation. So uh now in in Jeremiah, this is what God said to uh through Jeremiah. He says that that I know the thoughts that I think toward you and so on. Thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. Then shall you call, that's the first word. You'll call upon me and you shall go and pray. That was the second thing. And I will hearken unto you. And you shall seek me and find me. &gt;&gt; I'm happy for that. You'll seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart. &gt;&gt; When you seek uh just giving some background when you and and this kind of seeking is not just you know looking or casually looking this seek in the Hebrew is that you have a desire and you are actually requiring it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is almost like a demand. You are requiring this and you will seek for me. You are requesting it and uh and last but not least to seek to secure it, to obtain it, to find it. And then when you find it, you acquire it. What you have sought for you acquire. So it it it goes out of the realm of, you know, we're just looking for something or I mean I I have an appetite. I have a desire. I have a yearning. I have a craving and I'm kind of going in a certain direction. That's not what the Bible's talking about. That's not what Jeremiah is talking about. That's not what God is saying. He said, "When you seek for me, you will find me when you have sought for me with all of your heart." Amen. &gt;&gt; When you consult, when you inquire, when you study, when you seek with application, you are applying yourself to it. And then uh the second scripture I read and brother Brandham reads both of these scriptures. He says, "And and every man pressth into it." And that pressing is even to the point of suffering violence. it is to be uh to use force or to apply force. And the person we need to apply force to is this guy here. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure you can agree with that in the message desperation. Now, we'll be looking at that uh uh uh a good deal throughout the service, but brother Brandham says at the beginning of this, and I you have no doubt made it a mental mark in your minds, but we always have a lot of uh younger ones that are coming up and newer ones that are coming in and those newer ones perhaps that are listening and those older ones that need to be reminded. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation." It's too bad. &gt;&gt; It has to do it do that. It's too bad that desperation that we need desperation. In other words, if I read this correctly and get brother Brandham's thought, he's saying to us, you don't really need an emergency to become desperate. &gt;&gt; You don't really need an emergency. You don't have to wait until something has driven you to such extremity before you seek &gt;&gt; and find &gt;&gt; and pray. You don't have to wait for that. In other words, a bride of Jesus Christ has the wherewithal to come to a place by hearing the word. And this is what we're going to come to in a little bit. By hearing, just seeing God's will should throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; Seeing what he desires. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the he says the human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency something arises and when they do it throws them into desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out the real thing. So desperation can bring out the real thing. I would prefer seeing a person who was not squeezed into an emergency but came to desperation without that &gt;&gt; even though both are fine but it would be better to me it would be better that is why I always have a caution in my heart when I'm called to a deathbed for a deathbed repentance because I realize it doesn't need the deathbed for a person to call on God. &gt;&gt; And when a when a person is in that state, uh all kinds of people and you know, I'm not a prophet or the son of a prophet. I I don't know exactly what their intent or what their motive or what their objective. I know that all kinds of people when they're on their deathbed, they want and we get all we we get requests for prayer all the time. And I always wonder what's what is behind that request? What is did they call on God? Did they did they show that they wanted to serve him when they had their health and when they were a when they had their voice? Was it a witness then? And so that's always a question the person's mind. I'll say to anybody here that's just floating along the stream of life on easy street. I wouldn't I wouldn't stay there. &gt;&gt; You will come to an emergency. &gt;&gt; You will need to call. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there are scripture in this holy book that says, "And they will call and I will not hear them." &gt;&gt; I don't want to find myself in that place. &gt;&gt; I don't want to find myself there. Neither do you. Now, this the message that you'll have to take a a a curve with me here. We're going to move around a curve. And that is I want to bring this to our time in a dispensational way. Brother Brandham preached the token in the morning service and then he preached desperation in the evening service and the next service he preached was pardoned. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I was speaking to brother Tom before he left and I said different ones are coming to me and just in conversation say I've just been reading the des message desperation. I was just listening to desperation and here I had been in it for a couple of weeks in uh mentally turning over the different thoughts and things that brother Brandham had said and I wanted to get into it and study it. And then I was uh speaking with brother uh Dr. Otto Slutner and brother Otto was saying to me I've just been in listening to the message desperation. I said that's amazing. That's what I've been pondering for the last couple of weeks. And he said you know brother Brandham says in there why do we live? You know he said and and you're never you're never really fit to live till you're ready to die. &gt;&gt; And uh he said you should tell that to the congregation. And I said, "Well, I'm about there. We're about at that point." But now, Brother Brandham preached the token in the morning and desperation in the evening. And I hope and trust and pray and believe that when the service is over, you'll perhaps have a a different a better understanding of why it just happened that way. Uh now uh in order for me to uh really bring the kind of uh foundation that I want, I'm going to just back up a wee bit. uh in the time of the token when it was first made known through Moses. The secret of salvation, the secret of being saved from death at that time, the secret of salvation from death in the time of Moses was sealed in the word that was given to Moses. Now, I want to take you on a little mental journey. Please stay with me very closely. So the secret of salvation, this was not just death in a family. That's bad enough. But this was death coming to the eldest of all the nation, &gt;&gt; the firstborn of all the nation and the cattle. &gt;&gt; This was going to be a massive, massive happening &gt;&gt; and desperation. We're not even capable of putting ourselves there. We're sitting here relatively comfortable and and safe and we have our our uh you know our schedule for what we're planning on doing after service. But if you could just if God by the Holy Spirit could help you to go back to this moment and find that the eldest of all the families were sentenced under the sentence of death and all of the cattle. And if we could just comprehend that for a moment and I have been attempting to do so. And now the word that comes from God through the through the mouth of Moses is let every man go and get a lamb or it was even a lamb or a goat, a lamb for a household and you will slay the lamb and you'll take the blood. Now get my thought. Those are just words. Those are just sounds. Somehow Moses was made to know that. And so he's speaking this out. And so now the words become embodied in the ones that believed it. &gt;&gt; And then they went into action and went to their field or their their paddic or wherever it was and got the animal. And then they are slaying this animal and collecting this blood. And the woman is cooking this uh animal for a Passover lamb. And they're doing strange things. And they're putting the blood on the lentil and the doorpost. And now the whole thing, those words have actually materialized into an action. And for those people to believe that this whole nation is coming under the sentence of death and this how can we relate this blood is somehow and killing my lamb and putting this blood over the door and how is this going to save me? What is the mechanics? What is the psychology behind? What's the philosophy? How can I relate that this blood is going to somehow save my child, my son, from death? Where's the connection between this animal and and and the blood and the eating this meat and my wife's always cooked this? How is this now? We've killed lots of animals and we've shed lots of blood. How is this one going to save my family? The whole the only connection between that blood and their salvation. The only connection was some words that a prophet had spoken &gt;&gt; and their faith and confidence in those words to do this very strange thing. &gt;&gt; How do you connect some words to some blood and some blood to saving from being killed? That's right. &gt;&gt; How do you put that one together? Praise God. &gt;&gt; You see, and the only connection between the words that the prophet spoke and the and and connecting it to the blood getting on the door was found in a person's heart that they believed what he said &gt;&gt; regardless of how strange it was. and desperation set in because they believed it so much. &gt;&gt; They believed the word so completely. They believe the servant, vindicated servant of God so completely, they're prepared to do anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the act was strange. Kill a lamb, blood on a lentil, blood on the doorpost, eat the lamb, and burn what remains. That's a strange activity, but it was done because of their belief. In the days of Rahab, the substance was different. Rahab had a scarlet cord. Salvation was not in the fabric of the cord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Salvation was sealed in the fact that she had received the spies and believed what they said. In fact is her salvation was in the word of promise. Her salvation was actually anchored in what they said. &gt;&gt; If you'll do this, we'll keep our word. If you'll do that, then we if you'll keep your word, we'll keep our word. And for that woman to turn around and think and and you put this cord in the window and here she puts this thing in the window, you know, just as a uh as an activity, as an action, as an event. Yesterday it wasn't there. Today I've had it in the house. I' I've had that cord here for maybe for years or months or whatever more. And now I've been told by these two men who are spies that if I will put this in there, my whole house will be saved and my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and everybody that I uh that I have desired for will be saved if I put this string in the window. &gt;&gt; Now the token &gt;&gt; has transferred. I want you to see this transient movement of the token. At one time it was from word. It went to blood. &gt;&gt; This time it's from word to a cord in a window. &gt;&gt; Today salvation has moved on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it still goes from word &gt;&gt; to substance. Amen. &gt;&gt; The substance in Moses time was blood. &gt;&gt; The substance in Rahab's time was accord. &gt;&gt; The substance in the time of our Lord Jesus Christ was blood. &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying was blood. You might say it is blood. That's exactly the truth. But it is not the chemistry of the blood. It is the life that went out from the blood. And then that life now became substance again. &gt;&gt; That word became substance in a people. &gt;&gt; But it could not until a prophet spoke it. And when he spoke it, then it actually had a transformation. &gt;&gt; That lamb, that lamb had the blood the day before Moses spoke. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; That lamb had the blood coursing through its veins the day before Moses spoke. But before he spoke those words, that blood was nothing more than some red substance keeping that lamb alive. &gt;&gt; But after the prophet spoke, that blood kept the family alive. [Music] &gt;&gt; So it was not in the blood as such. It was in the the word that God had spoken. And that word did not originate with Moses. &gt;&gt; That word originated in the very essence of God &gt;&gt; in the very thoughts of God, the mind of God. &gt;&gt; So I want to go back to that. And the prophet said, "And the Passover was taken in an emergency in times of desperation." Said they'd seen the great hand of God. I want you to relate it and connect it to our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They'd seen all his miracles. They'd come under the sign of the token. And while they were under the sign of the token, they' taken the communion in desperation. For they knew all of that time God was fixing to strike with judgment. And it was a shaking time. And we'd be less than honest if we didn't say, "And we're in a shaking time. &gt;&gt; We're in a very shaking time." It was a time when every man was examining himself because the word of the prophet had not failed one time. It had been proven to be true whatever he said. And it happened just exactly that way. In case you would have any question and if you have not been in the desperation message, you should go to the end of that message and you'll come up with one conclusion. What the prophet said was exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; And the people he called out was exactly the truth. It was the same spirit at the front of the message as it was at the back of the message. So after the after the token was made known, then shall you call and pray, then you shall seek and find me. When you shall search for me with all your heart. I'm being honest with you today. I just wonder what changes might take place in your life, in your home, in your family, my life. If the Holy Spirit somehow gripped us in such a way that we began to search and seek for him with all our heart, the totality of our heart, the extremity of our heart, every fiber of our being was set on one goal. And we began to seek him. I wonder what would happen in this congregation. Wonder what would happen in the bride of Jesus Christ if this rose up to be far more than just a gathering place, a church as such uh more than just a sanctuary, more than just a place where we come and sing and worship and and have the normal course of our our meetings. I wonder what would take place. I personally believe it could be vastly different. We've seen also the great hand of God. So after the token, after the token, listen closely. After the token was made known, then he says, "Then you'll call and you'll pray." In other words, it was different after the token was made known. And perhaps for someone here today, maybe that's going to just become a reality to you today. the opening of the seals through brother Brandham into desperation in case you miss it and when you go back and I'm trusting that a lot of people here most of you I trust will go and read the message desperation and as is the case with very many of of the prophets messages they have a personal reference quite often it has a personal reference even before it has a public reference And the desperation is exactly that way. There's a a big part of the message which is for the general public. But the first part of the message, brother Brandham has himself completely integrated with the with the with the message. He's preaching the message from a p personal perspective. And I need to get convey that some of some to you today because that's very very important. So the opening of the seals threw him into desperation. He says so I'm going to read those quotes as I as I come to them then I want you to say why did that throw him into such desperation. It's because there was a realization. He came into a realization that the Holy Spirit that was moving through the spoken word &gt;&gt; was the token over the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can see the place that he was seeing himself in that the the seals were now open just a short time before maybe 3 4 months before and now he's uh led uh by this sovereign grace to speak the token to the people and to lay it out. Then he come in the evening time with desperation letting them know that it could only come and he says in the in the token message that it could only come in the evening time. He says this about the token. The token never came into existence. Never came into existence. Now the token was always there in the mind of God but it never came into existence until the evening time. And this is the evening time of the age that we live in. &gt;&gt; If it was back then, how much closer are we now? Where are you at now at this point? And this is the evening time that we live in. He said this is the evening time for the church. Hello, church. &gt;&gt; Would you say amen? I believe that. &gt;&gt; He says this is the evening time for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he often referred to himself as an old man but by today's standards he was a very young man yet &gt;&gt; to pass off the scene and be gone and taken at the age of 56 today is considered very very young and so he was a probably about 54 when he was saying this and this is the evening time for me he was feeling it he was sensing it he even said you know that two of us can't be here at the same time I must decrease and he must increase. You know, I can't be with you much longer. Here he's saying that in his mid50s &gt;&gt; and he's gone in a few months. &gt;&gt; This is the evening time for me. &gt;&gt; Did that happen? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said it's the evening time for the church. &gt;&gt; Will that happen? &gt;&gt; And he says, "And this is the evening time of my message." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm dying. I'm going. I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Did that happen? Was that so? &gt;&gt; Then it's so for you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says it throws a person into desperation. So he was realizing that the word, the spirit, the holy spirit moving through the word of this season, this hour was the token for the people. And that is why he comes blasting across. It's a shaking time. So, we can't fool around any longer. And he brought it right down to the poop the the people themselves. He said, now in the in and I'm staying in the same message, he says, watch what's come after the seals. &gt;&gt; Watch what's come after the seals. He says the uniting of the people, &gt;&gt; united signs, the red light flashing in the last days, the sign of women getting prettier and men what they would do. all these signs of the Holy Spirit leading up and then come right back here to the capping off of all those messages since the seals that's capped off in this one thing the token &gt;&gt; that we are all right &gt;&gt; that's what threw him in such desperation &gt;&gt; that the people needed to grasp that this was the evening time for the church the evening time for the message the evening time of this generation and the token had now come on the scene and must be applied. &gt;&gt; We must take the substance has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can take all the sheep or lambs or goats of this entire country and you won't have uh one ounce of salvation in it. You can have all the red cords in the country and put it in your windows. It won't do one thing for you. Won't save you from judgment at all. But but the the very word of God in each season that word becomes a substance. And that's where I want to go. He said, "Now watch what it is." And then it comes and capping off in the token that we're all right. He said, "Just check ourselves and see if we're in the faith." He says, "And I see things coming up." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can't tell the people. said, "You see, you see different things and you're forbidden." Them visions that they call on, notice them visions that they call on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you read a message, you need to read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very, very carefully. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, I read them very, very carefully. And I'll say secondly, I need to read them even more carefully. But I ponder them very, very deep. and I watch how they're phrased. He told me, he said, "The people think I have the visions." He says, "It's their faith &gt;&gt; that causes me to have the vision." &gt;&gt; Even says one place, "Don't don't p don't pull like that. Don't do that." Is what he's saying. as the people were pulling on them to have a vision for their health, for their condition, for their family, for their son, their daughter or whatever more. And he was he he was trying to index the anointing around so he could bring the word, the message, that's what the people needed. &gt;&gt; He said, so the token that we are all right. And he says, and I see things coming up and you you can't tell the people. You see different things and you're forbidden them visions that they call on and sometimes they'd be sorry if you did tell them and you know better than to do it and then you go so far into visions till everything becomes a vision and it throws you into a nervous stage and you look and say now am I in a vision like sitting here right here &gt;&gt; see where he was at &gt;&gt; is Is this a vision? He asked. Is this a vision? Where am I really standing at? And you're overworked. You're overworked yourself. Overtax yourself. And you find out things about people that you wish you didn't know. The people that desires these things to know these things, they don't realize what that type of ministry costs. &gt;&gt; You don't know what goes with it. And then it throws into desperation. Lord God, I I know I'm going to have to answer. &gt;&gt; And that's when I think it was uh uh one of the brothers that worked with him there just name just slipped me as I made reference to it and he said, "I'd hate to have to answer for what you have to answer for." Then he comes into that the realization of what a person may have to answer for. I mean even our examples in our influence and what we can be and what we are what we are and how we conduct things. Now I can tell you one thing friends if if we come to a stage and I say if we do because I'm convinced that we're not there. We're not seeking God with all of our heart. I say from the pulpit to the pew &gt;&gt; seek him with all of our heart to the full extremity to other it it begins to replace other things I've got to move on from here otherwise I'll be distracted how would anyone know just exactly what a person is to do now brother Brennham in this paragraph and I'm largely in desperation he uses this phrase flashes of the end time. I hope it lodges in your heart like it lodges into mine flashes of the end time. I I I wonder if we're, you know, perhaps casting it. He says, "Then seeing then seeing these signs coming, seeing the Holy Spirit take us out there." Now, watch what signs he's talking about. And bring these seals and lay them in like that. and bring the church ages and lay them in. Then come down in a great big pillar of fire back there and reveal himself. Then come down on the next thing on the seven seals and reveal it. Even put it in the papers, the magazines. Then what am I reading this for? This is what this is what contributed to his desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what made him desperate. &gt;&gt; We may sit and listen to it and read it may not have any effect. Other people saw the magazines, saw it in the newspapers, all the rest of it. All kinds of Egyptians, they they saw the blood they walked by, it it didn't inspire them to kill a lamb. &gt;&gt; Even if there was a hope in it, it never inspired them. And there was perhaps many Israelis or Israelites or children of Abraham that perhaps didn't do it as the as the presentation of young people did here a few years ago. &gt;&gt; Maybe things were okay for them. They were living, you know, things were all right and they weren't brought into a desperate pos place. And we're happen to be in an age that I know that no one is going to go from here and not have any any food on the table. You you got some food on the table. You got a mode of travel when you get out of here. You got some friends. You got uh if you have few friends or many friends, you have that. And we have a support structure. We have a civilization. We have an economy. We have some you're you're okay. &gt;&gt; Whether you do it or you don't do it, you're going to make it. You're you're going to you're going to live. You're going to carry on. You're going to go to work. You're going to You see what I mean? Now, here here was something in brother Brandham's life. It wasn't it wasn't a death. &gt;&gt; It wasn't his wife laying in the hospital. &gt;&gt; It wasn't some tragedy that was happening within his family. &gt;&gt; It was the things that he was seeing. He was &gt;&gt; seeing the mighty spirit of God coming, &gt;&gt; taking the word that had been sealed. He believed that with all of his heart. these secrets that have been sealed from the beginning of time and it was consuming him. Uh these things that have been held secret in the sealed book, God opened up these things. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? &gt;&gt; What does this mean for the people? What does it mean for me? What does it mean for the time that I'm in? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what was taking gripping him and to come down in the next thing he said and reveal it and put it in the papers and magazines and come and take the angels of God them seven angels with seven messages and confirmed it exactly what the Bible said. Then during that time, come up and bring those seven seals, those signs, flashes of the end time and bringing it up to the people and tell them what it is and all about it. &gt;&gt; Now, it hasn't hasn't just happened, but he's he's brought it to the people and told them what it is. &gt;&gt; He says, and and the Lord working right there, showing himself present. &gt;&gt; He never went away even during that time. Now, new things are coming forth. It didn't all turn just to doctrine. Even after the end of desperation, starts calling people out and showing that he's still present &gt;&gt; and he's the one who's revealing these things and bringing it down to a token time and letting the people know. He's still confirming that I'm still here. &gt;&gt; It may sound strange, but it's still the same person speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a It may sound different, but it's not a different one speaking. &gt;&gt; He says, "And showing himself present and then write down like this morning, come up and require that token &gt;&gt; on every person." Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what was making him tremble. &gt;&gt; He was going back. He's rehearsing. He says, "And here comes all these signs. And here comes this at the end of his ministry of the evening time." He just spoke it in the morning, the evening time of my ministry, evening time of my life, evening time for the church. It came the token came into existence in the evening time. And now it comes in desperation. And God requires it. &gt;&gt; It's not something you take and leave it. It's not just something that's optional. &gt;&gt; And require that token on every person. He makes this powerful statement. Then you're my people. All right. &gt;&gt; You're the ones that I love these and them listening to the tapes and so forth. Then you see what desperation &gt;&gt; it puts on me. &gt;&gt; That's what led him to desperation. If you go through that message just quickly, there was those who came into desperation because of famine. Women because they were barren, others because of some tragedy and death, some because of sickness. And I'm going to, Lord willing, I'm going to come to the end in a few moments. And there was one that he has in there that she had none of those. And it was called the Queen of the South. &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba. &gt;&gt; She wasn't poor. &gt;&gt; She wasn't lacking food. &gt;&gt; She wasn't coming because she had enemies. She wasn't coming because her kingdom was threatened or her home was threatened. &gt;&gt; She wasn't coming. But she had heard [Applause] &gt;&gt; of the wisdom of Solomon. &gt;&gt; And she had heard about the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I must go. &gt;&gt; I must find this out. &gt;&gt; I must hear it for myself. [Music] And something within her drove her to desperation when there was no no material thing that was causing it. There was no physical thing. There was no other thing. It was a desire within her that drove her to desperation. That's where I'm at this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh God, increase that desire until that desire eats you out. Until that desire gnaws at your soul and your spirit, when everything's going fine, may I pray that that will gnaw at your very inner being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That it'll cost you sleep &gt;&gt; and cost you food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll lose your appetite. &gt;&gt; You'll lose your hunger for all other things. You'll lose your uh the things that stimulate you. It won't stimulate you anymore. It'll become more repulsive to you &gt;&gt; when you sing. I have a craving. I have a craving in my soul for God. It's driving me to my room. It's driving me to my knees. It's driving me in desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Milco, that's why I appreciate that email this morning. So, I become so desperate. I had to tell my wife. I have to tell her. So desperate because this is this is the rapture time. This is the end time. &gt;&gt; And when we hear we hear from this vindicated mouth, things are going to go right on. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I declare they're going to have services in this church &gt;&gt; after the rapture's taken place. You might say, "Who's going to come?" Well, they'll find some people to come. There'll be people at the altar pounding the altar weeping tears believing they're getting saved and it's all over. &gt;&gt; And you shouldn't look shocked. That's what this messenger said. &gt;&gt; And that's why I said we want to shake ourselves. Make sure you're not one of those. &gt;&gt; I want to just take you quickly. Just hold this truth right now. Hold where we're at, please. I I want you to look at with me something that really intrigues me very very deeply in regard to this subject. That is the very essence. I'm I'm fascinated. I'm I believe it's something that we need to at least understand. And that is how how does this transfer? This God that fills all time and space, this essence of God, this this part of his being. And uh brother Brandham, I have to go quickly, but brother Brandham says that a thought has to be created. &gt;&gt; We hear the phrase all the time, it a word is a thought expressed. But brother Brandham says more than once, but the thought had to be created. So God, this great being perhaps even billions and billions of years ago in man's time, but God within this God, this one who spoke worlds into existence and hung stars out and perhaps is still creating, I don't know, and billions and billions of of star systems and uh all kinds of galaxies out there. Uh who who can even begin to comprehend? I don't even know how that God finds me. &gt;&gt; The speck of dust &gt;&gt; in this little speck called the earth. How God how God identified this earth as a womb for his seed. And then he let his life come and let beings like us come here on the earth and that he would love us &gt;&gt; and sent his own spirit, his own son in Jesus Christ and let the word be transformed into flesh. Yes. &gt;&gt; With newly created blood by the word of God spoken through prophets. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It came from even a the thought of God into substance. &gt;&gt; What a story. &gt;&gt; What an account. &gt;&gt; The creating of the thought. And God said, I don't think he spoke English. And I doubt if he spoke Hebrew. I don't know what he spoke, but there's a sound. There's no sound without some meaning. &gt;&gt; And God uttered something. It might have been a thunder. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it was, &gt;&gt; but it conveyed the essence of his thought. &gt;&gt; It was a sound that had a meaning. And the proof that it had a meaning is when he said it, something happened on the other end. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So watch this sequence please. This process. He created the thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he gave the thought sound, &gt;&gt; a word. And when that was uttered, it materialized into what he had thought. The essence of his thought began to materialize. Let the earth bring forth. Well, maybe it could have just covered over with some kind of a a fog, but he had something in his mind. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Let the earth bring forth." And when it began to bring forth, vegetation began to come. And if there had been, if you had been there standing there watching, you could have said, "Oh, that's what he meant." &gt;&gt; Because the materialization of it interpreted what he thought. &gt;&gt; You're staying with me. &gt;&gt; Materialized into substance in its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Based on what I've just said, you think your mother and dad brought you here? &gt;&gt; I said they had very little with bringing you here &gt;&gt; by that conception and by that birth, you're going to die. &gt;&gt; But if you were in the mind of God, &gt;&gt; in which I can say all you are now is a materialization of his thought. If you're a materialization of his thought, you're going to go back where he intended you to be. &gt;&gt; God didn't think when he be brought his sons and daughters, brought humanity, brought people in his image. He didn't think, "Oh, I'll leave them here and they'll just die and go to ashes and somehow that gets him glory." That doesn't get him glory. That doesn't get him fellowship. That doesn't achieve his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought you here as a materialization of his thought &gt;&gt; to take you back and have fellowship with you throughout eternity. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word became flesh, which is the India report. He said, "And every word in the Bible is God's thoughts &gt;&gt; laid in seed form." &gt;&gt; Notice in seed form. That's one form. &gt;&gt; That if it's received into the human being, hello human beings. &gt;&gt; If it's received in the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible, &gt;&gt; it brings the thing to pass. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not man's word. It's not man's thought. It's not man's sound. &gt;&gt; Now, this brother here, a sister over here, maybe another brother, sister over here, and I'm sure many within this congregation can say, "God spoke to me." When you say that, I doubt very much if it was uttered in any words. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was something he made you to know. &gt;&gt; And you knew it so clear. &gt;&gt; In fact, as it was so clear, you couldn't even think of any words that would make it that clear. &gt;&gt; I could say to you or I could say, "I am convinced." But oh, the thing that God made no one has got a went went much deeper than just being convinced. Oh, that's why we can say I know that I know that I know. What are we trying to say? I'm thoroughly convinced. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "If God showed you or spoke to you and and and let you know, you're healed. &gt;&gt; You are healed. &gt;&gt; That cancer is gone." And the doctor said, "You'll be dead before morning." He said you would laugh in that doctor's face. &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying you'd be disrespectful. &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying that you would dishonor him or you'd make fun of him or you want to mock him or you want to disregard him. No. Nothing changes with the doctor patient status. But it is the fact that something else was so real to you, &gt;&gt; you couldn't possibly comprehend what he's saying. And that's where the laughter part comes in. You'll be dead by morning. Oh doctor, if you only knew &gt;&gt; what has come from another diagnosis. &gt;&gt; If you only knew &gt;&gt; there are origin of another thought. &gt;&gt; That's why he said that. And he said, and God said, "Let there be a world." He said, "Before it could be a word, it had to be a thought." So God in creation created the world by his thought first, then spoke it, and the thought expressed became material. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God had to speak it to a prophet. How he spoke it, I don't know. But it was very, very concise and specific. Tell the people that every man should take a lamb for his household, a lamb for every house. Up to that moment, those lambs were frolicking and kicking around out in the pasture, and their blood was worthless. as far as saving a man from death. &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point? &gt;&gt; But that word materialized that blood into a saving power. &gt;&gt; That even the blood in that lamb became more powerful than the armies of Egypt. The blood materialized &gt;&gt; into something else &gt;&gt; and was more powerful than Pharaoh's decree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now catch it please. Now you have a vindicated &gt;&gt; prophet who speaks and it happens. &gt;&gt; Who speaks &gt;&gt; and it materializes. &gt;&gt; Who speaks and says that is the mystery of the seven seals. And there it is in the sign in the heavens and there is a cloud and that was seven angels. He's speaking and he's saying this is the interpretation thereof. This is the revelation thereof. Up to that time you read it in the Bible. Theologians read it in the Bible. All kinds of people read it in the Bible. But now it became uh it became a known. It was no more a secret. It no more a mystery. It was revealed. &gt;&gt; But not only to us who read it and say, "Ah, this has been revealed. Now I see it different." That wasn't the purpose. He went into desperation to let you know that that was the token. &gt;&gt; This is going to allow you to pass from death &gt;&gt; and judgment. For this world is under judgment. &gt;&gt; And the token could only be made known in the evening time, in the evening of his life, in the evening of his message, &gt;&gt; in the evening of the church. &gt;&gt; It could only come in our time. It came in your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say, &gt;&gt; "Well, well, I have the token on my shelf." No, that's not sufficient. That's like saying the man saying, "I have the token out in the barn. &gt;&gt; The token is out there feeding in the in the pasture." And it's so nice, you know? I really don't think I It's a child's pet. And I really that's the only really perfect one I have. And I just think that is wee bit extreme. Kill it. Take it from my kids. put the blood and I'm so emotionally attached. You know what? I think it's okay. It just out feeds out there for another day or two. I'll see how this thing unfolds. &gt;&gt; I'll just see what happens. &gt;&gt; I'll see what happens in the church. And then maybe the time will come when I'll have to get a jolt and get serious. And no, I can tell you right today, there's people that have played with this message &gt;&gt; in this area &gt;&gt; that I personally, unless God by additional grace does something for them, there's no way they're going to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; You're quiet when I say that, but I say that in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's no way. treating the message with a with a laxidasical and and and and uh without any sincerity, without any seriousness and not even knowing what the messenger said. How can you believe it's even how can you believe that your it's your escape from judgment? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we realize judgment's coming. Hey, death on a slab on a morg is nothing. That's a that's only kindergarten stuff. And look what we go through to escape that to extend our life. Well, I I don't want to die yet. I want to live. I want to continue on. And and we we'll call the whole church and send emails all over the country cuz pray for somebody cuz they're they're going to die. I tell you what, that's just child stuff. &gt;&gt; Think about dying and facing God &gt;&gt; and to give an account for what you did with the word that he sent. And he'd say, "Did I confirm it?" "Yes, you confirmed it. Did I preach it? Did I send my message? Did I send my preacher? Did I send Did I speak to you? Did I send the Holy Ghost? Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, you did. What's going to be the answer? &gt;&gt; It's not some big thunder &gt;&gt; or lightning. &gt;&gt; It's that still small voice &gt;&gt; that I'm interested in this morning. That still small voice that speaks to you. is calling you. &gt;&gt; But we're too busy. We're taken up with all kinds of other things. We're taken up with things of this life and it's all perishing. &gt;&gt; Whatever we have, whatever smart you have, whatever intelligence you have, use it for God. Whatever skills you have, use them for God. Whatever position God puts you in, use it for God. Whatever possessions God gives you, use it for the kingdom of God. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. &gt;&gt; Don't be caught into just an emotional scene. Don't be caught and say, "Well, God really spoke to me. I'm I'm weeping." I just soon have a person not weep at all. And have their life co totally transformed. Say, "I did business with God. God spoke to me. He said thus and thus and I have responded &gt;&gt; this has not been the pattern of my life but I am making a change &gt;&gt; because something was spoken by our pro by our pastor today that touched me very deep and I'm giving myself to it &gt;&gt; I want you to join me &gt;&gt; I'm seeking to do the same thing &gt;&gt; can I take just a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; He said he was in the beginning by himself. God dwelt alone with his thoughts. He'll never do that again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because his thoughts &gt;&gt; are being made manifest. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? His thoughts become manifest once they're manifest. They're not something that passes off the scene. He receives that what what the materialization of it. He receives it back to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says why we are right here this very day. God is fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. I take that God somehow beyond my comprehension, this God that we speak of is here at this moment. &gt;&gt; And like I might step up and shake hands with someone, but this God is is fellowshipping. Maybe I don't know what your thought is sitting here today, but this God according to this word is fellowshipping with his thoughts. &gt;&gt; I suppose if he could express it, and I'm a poor one to express it for him, but in he'd be saying, "I thought of them. I thought of her. &gt;&gt; I thought of him. I thought of him as a child. I thought of her as a young person. I I thought of them. I thought of their union. I thought of their marriage. I thought of who they would bring into the world and and how they would train them up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And oh, what a pleasure that is to me. &gt;&gt; What a joy that is to me. &gt;&gt; God fellowshipping with the thought. But we're sitting here and maybe wondering when's this service going to end and you know going through the Bible and reading and here God's wanting to fellowship with his thoughts &gt;&gt; and God expressed in Jesus Christ when the prophet said he only asked for one thing only one thing he didn't ask for your money he didn't ask for your houses and lands he didn't ask for your car he didn't ask for anything he asked for your fellowship It's &gt;&gt; the only thing you desire your fellowship. &gt;&gt; He says a little further. He says, "And for this word, as we've seen this morning, has to be fulfilled, it is God's thoughts made manifest by his word and brought into reality." Now he said, 'Now the same one that sent the Lord Jesus here by his spoken word, it materialized. Listen close. The same one, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that sent the Lord Jesus here. It materialized and became the word &gt;&gt; in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, there there is a there is a an unseen power. There's an unseen force in God's word. I'm talking about not all words that are preached, but in God's word, there's a force in it that actually materializes the individual. You may not change like like that blood in the lamb. It didn't it didn't change the lamb. The lamb remained in the same structure. It was it always was an animal. And the blood when it came out, it was red substance like all the other all the other animals. But there was a word associated with that lamb. &gt;&gt; You're human like all other people are human. They're walking the streets. They're around us by the millions. But there are some people, they're not structurally any different. They may be culturally different. They may speak a different language or something else. But there are some people that are under they're actually under a certain word of promise. &gt;&gt; Rahab, she didn't change at all. She had the same eyes and the same face and the same lips and the same body. She had the same pieces of furniture in the house. Nothing changed. But she came under a promise. &gt;&gt; That was the only difference with her. She came under a promise. And that promise transformed her from harlot to a child of God to a mother of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Transformed her. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here like all other people who may be sitting in church today, but God uttered a word which was a promise for this evening time season. And there are a few people, not many in the earth, but there are a few people. And the devil would like to have you say, "Well, how can I believe that that's me? Have you heard it? &gt;&gt; Have you heard it? &gt;&gt; Is there a substance within the message that spoke to you very deeply and you know that you know [Music] &gt;&gt; I respect people that even even if they have backsliden and gone into the world and gone into sin when they can say I will never deny. &gt;&gt; Amen. William Brandon was God's prophet &gt;&gt; and the word that he spoke is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I have respect to that &gt;&gt; because God has respect to it. &gt;&gt; But there's another group of people. Oh, God help me and God help you that he's actually sent. He sent a promise. It has settled down over you. It hangs over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, in whatever set of circumstances you find yourself in, you are a promised and you're connected because in your heart you have a faith and you believe that word. &gt;&gt; Everything's going sideways, folks. Maybe my health is gone. But that person laying in a hospital bed, whether it be brother Edwin Dodd or be some other person, they believe this message with all their heart and soul, they have an abiding promise over top of them sealing them beyond death, beyond the funeral home, beyond the grave, beyond anything else. And that power, that sealing power, that promise, my brother, my sister, will material. It will materialize into a change and actually change the atoms of your physical body. &gt;&gt; Not because there has to come any special power into it. It's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What happens in a woman's body when she conceives and everything, the marvel of of human life begins to come. The Bible tells us that all of this happened, I believe in uh Matthew the 2 chapter, all of this happened so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets. &gt;&gt; The word of the prophet caused the conception. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word of the prophet caused a child to be formed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if he hadn't spoken, it would never have taken place. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the word of Isaiah &gt;&gt; and the words of the prophets that materialized &gt;&gt; because the season came. And the very word that caused that body to form is the same word that will cause these bodies to transform. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's at least part of the message this morning. I just feel I've gone far enough. And if I start digging any further, we're going to be another a half hour. And I don't want to do that. We're having a a service tonight. But this is the process of it going from the essence of the bosom of God &gt;&gt; coming to a thought being created sir &gt;&gt; and then God uttering some sound. And I pray I pray with everything that's in me that he's uttering a sound. As I look across the congregation, you need to hear something specific to yourself. &gt;&gt; Even though you may have your husband or wife or your dear friend next to you, they don't know really what you need. But God knows exactly &gt;&gt; what to speak. And he'll say it. It won't be brother Disco's words, but I just pray that perhaps there was something said that put you into a certain connection. &gt;&gt; I heard God speak to me. &gt;&gt; I heard God say something. And then I'll just say to you, whatever he saith, do it. &gt;&gt; Do it. I could go into Hannah. The prophet said her desperation became so great &gt;&gt; a priest, a learned man, a man of the word thought she was drunk. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The Shunomite woman became so desperate. &gt;&gt; Yes. And when she rode up to the prophet's residence, she was in such desperation. But when the prophet finally decided that he would go himself &gt;&gt; down to the dead son and she was asked, "How is it?" She said, "All is well." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then she said, and then he said her desperation, &gt;&gt; you know, it melted away &gt;&gt; and then it became the prophet's desperation cuz there he was and the dead child down there and he went down there and laid upon that son and and let eyes to eyes and lips to lips and hands to hands and the boy sneezed and came back to life. And then his desperation was over. Said it took her desperation and his desperation. She wanted she she she wanted her desperation was for the prophet and his desperation was he wanted to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God held it from him. He said, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, and this this means something to all of us. Brother Brandham said, "Peter," and he stepped out of the boat at the Lord's command, at the Lord's invitation. He stepped out of the boat and he got into trouble. He began to sink. And brother Bradam just brought to the congregation. He says, "Maybe you're in trouble. We've tried right in the right in the uh under the commandment of God." He said, "You're right in the line of duty, but you make a mistake." And he says, "We all do." And he made a mistake, but that wasn't the end of it. Whatever it is, whatever it is, it brought him to a desperation. And he didn't say, "Now I lay me down to sleep." No. Lord, &gt;&gt; save me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was one thing about desperation, friends, it always has a way of expressing itself. And that's why it says when you call, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, &gt;&gt; it would sometimes it doesn't have to be a large volume, but it can be. I love to see when people under the under the movement of the spirit of God in all truth cry unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Find a quiet place or find any place or or do it here in the church. It's fine with me. When desperation connects, &gt;&gt; you'll do things you never expected to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like to see people when they're coming to repentance. Lord, have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Lord, save me. &gt;&gt; Lord, deliver me from this tormenting spirit. &gt;&gt; Anybody here been under some cloud, Satan afflicting you? I'm here today to declare he doesn't have a right to you. &gt;&gt; That was not in God's mind. You tell him to depart from you. You tell him to He's defeated. Announce it to him. You're defeated. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for this victory. &gt;&gt; Lord, deliver me now. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet said. He said that that that that brother that was so determined to receive the Holy Spirit, he said, "Fill me with the Holy Ghost. Baptize me with the Holy Ghost. And if you don't, there'll be a pile of bones here when you come back. &gt;&gt; That's determination. &gt;&gt; No. Well, we'll try again tomorrow sometime. We have such a we have such a I want you to think about the queen. I just want you to think about the queen of Sheba. Brother Brown brings her into this desperation. I'm closing now. She's not driven by trouble. I'm just repeating some things. She doesn't have mutiny in the kingdom. She hasn't got invading armies. She's not crying for a baby. She has nothing that we could identify or has been recorded nothing that would drive her to desperation. I think she should be a good example of the bride of Jesus Christ. All is well. I have food. I have a roof over my head. I've got family, family, friends. I got brothers, sisters. I got people that pray for me. I'm forgiven. &gt;&gt; I'm bloodwashed. &gt;&gt; I've got a message. &gt;&gt; God's given me a heart to hear. &gt;&gt; God sent me a prophet. &gt;&gt; God sent me his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have so much to be thankful. What about you young people? &gt;&gt; I got a mom. I got a father that loves God. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. Maybe some of you don't, but you have spiritual moms and dads. &gt;&gt; We have spiritual brothers or sisters. Maybe somebody who you don't even feel very close to, but if you got into trouble, they'd be the first one to run to you, say, "What can I do? &gt;&gt; Can I help you?" This woman was like that. She thought now just listen within herself she came into desperation. I must go and hear about the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen now close. I'm coming. I want to say something to me. It really speaks to me. I've got my gods. I've got my church. I've got my worship. I got my kingdom. I got all these things. We got all this. I got my friends. I got my husband. I got my wife. I got my parents. I got my children. I've got And we just are really comfortable with these things. There was something in her because she had heard that there was a man that had unusual wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we sit today. You've got the seals book, you got the church age book, their books, their discs, their tapes, whatever more. But let me say this to you in the name of the Lord. We've heard a man with unusual wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I need to not only hear about his God, but I need to know that God. &gt;&gt; And what was driving her? Here I'm coming to it because eternal God knew that he himself in his fullness is going to come down into one. And part of his thought was going to be transformed into substance. And that substance would be a virginborn man. &gt;&gt; And they would he would be called a Nazarene. And he would come and be born in a house of a of a man who was a carpenter. And he would be disdained and he would be called illegitimate and he would have he would live in a life of humility. But one day, one day he would have to stand up and be rejected by some people and he would have to utter some words. And the words would be this. The w the queen of the southmen &gt;&gt; will rise up in judgment. What was happening to her even at that moment was transforming her to an individual that would go beyond judgment, stand in judgment and condemn the very men who heard the words of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It took her, she thought she's just going to Solomon. But now here comes one who says and a greater than Solomon is here is what he said. Oh God give you revelation to understand where I'm at. &gt;&gt; And even in this country in this province came the same Lord Jesus Christ revealing himself in a son of man revealing the son of man. And that woman at that time had to go go there and do that to condemn that generation. and this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this messenger would stand and say &gt;&gt; and declare, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; Not is coming is here. &gt;&gt; And they have their churches. They have their denominations. They have all of their beliefs. Pentecostal, Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Salvation Army, and all the rest of them all here with all their theology and school. And here comes a voice out of the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it echoes all the way back &gt;&gt; from the book of Kings in the book of Chronicles. And the woman was moved. &gt;&gt; I must go. &gt;&gt; Wasn't just to hear the wisdom of Solomon, but she must lay a track record. Yes, &gt;&gt; she must lay some footsteps in the scripture &gt;&gt; because God himself wanted this to be spoken in Victoria, British Columbia, a greater than Solomon is here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he wants a group of people in Cloverdale by the way to hear it screamed out once again. It's not just something that you fell into. It's not something you were just born into. It's not just something a friend told you. But it's because a greater than Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; And as he made her desperate &gt;&gt; for us, it's making you desperate. &gt;&gt; Your opportunity for desperation. &gt;&gt; For someone around you, &gt;&gt; desperation brings change. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the musicians. We're bow prayerfully, quietly, reverently. Perhaps, Brother Rod, if you could come, I'd like to sing a song, something that I know you can sing. Let the death angel pass. God's bride safe at last. Hallelujah. Say those words with me, please. Let the death angel pass. God's bride safe at last. Hallelujah. In the token. Oh, in the token that's been made known to us in this time. Father God, how I thank you as I'm standing here behind this pull pit. Lord, I'm just being quickened and I'm quivering inside. Let me see. Let me grasp. Let these people also grasp, oh God, the depth of it that they're under they're under a banner. They're under a covering right now of a promise. And this promise has made certain declarations. The promise has been confirmed through a mouth of a vindicated prophet of God. The promise has been confirmed that it's true. It's true. It's true. And Lord, we accept it as true. We believe it is true. We give ourselves to you unreservedly. And I ask, oh God, that you'll cause this congregation of people to become may a spirit of desperation come upon them. Oh God, whatever it is that your will would be for us, I pray that we will not fail you, but that we will fulfill it. Lord, we'll fulfill it for truly, it's an evening time for us as well. Father, in Jesus Christ's name, I commit the words that have been spoken in these precious dear people, which are yours by your word of promise. Amen. Let's stand together like this. This angel [Music] &gt;&gt; in the token he gave lifted up that we could be saved. Oh hallelujah and glory to God. The blessing of life, his spirit. Let the death angel pass. Brought to Moses and told him what to say. To the children of Isel in motion that day and take the blood strike close at the door for I'll pass through this night [Music] Angel [Applause] [Music] that we could be saved. Oh hallelujah. Glory to God. The blessing of life his spelit [Music] is a token today. And those who are running will be saved outside of this door. The lost will be found. If you want your love you don't Hey. Oh, hallelujah. And glory to God. [Music] His spirit arise. Let the angel pass. Brother Belco, I'd like you to come up here just a moment, please. I got an email, but I don't know exactly what, [Music] you know, what initiated that email. So, God obviously just spoke something to you, brother Melco. Just what did he what did he say? How did it come to you? Came before this message this morning. Said desperation. Desperation. Tell you better put it in your words. &gt;&gt; Uh, well, yeah. I just realized the time we're living in and I had a burden for the family friends and I've written many letters and been very straight with with everybody that that they will come the easy or the hard way but that we also I'm praying for them. I believe for them what the prophet said, what the token is and uh I tried to tell this to my wife many times but it just didn't work. But yesterday we had a very fine day together and um uh God just opened the word and um we just spoke about these things and and I just could see that the first time that she was receiving it and um accepting it as be something is happening. She also says that she knows that the life is over that she doesn't have much longer to go and uh it's just a time I believe you know and &gt;&gt; amen just an answer to a prayer that pastor speaks on desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God bless you. [Music] Now the blood's been applied. &gt;&gt; And the prophet could say, "You're mine." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The ones I think if he stood here, I'm not putting words in his mouth, but I think if he stood here, he'd say, "I love you." &gt;&gt; You've received the word that he sent. Not my word, his word. And just before you go now, I'd like you to take a little bit of heart. We're going to sing the chorus one more time. And I'd like to see have you imagine and look down into the one of the homes of the children of Israel. And now the death angel has passed and death has covered the land. And the eldest son, he wakes up in the morning and he finds out he's alive. [Music] &gt;&gt; He finds out he's alive. I don't think he if he had discourse to sing, I think he would say, "Oh, hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; The blood's been applied." &gt;&gt; Maybe run out the door and have a look at it. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Daddy, I'm so glad that you were faithful. I'm so glad that you obeyed. I'm so glad the prophet didn't compromise. I'm so glad we did it regardless of how foolish it looked like. But we did it. The blood's been applied. Oh, hallelujah. [Music] You think I'm wild? Wait till you see me on the other side. &gt;&gt; And some of you quiet, reserved people, I got to get out of your way. You're going to be so full of you say I this has been pent up for about 40 50 years down on earth I'll have to give it out right now. Well, I'm just encouraging you. Don't wait that long. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll sing the chorus once more. Brother Rod, let the death angel pass. [Music] [Music] and glory to God. [Music] [Applause] Let's give the Lord a hand. Thank you, Lord. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Alive. Glory to God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Oh, God. How I thank you. The blood's been applied. The angel has passed. We've passed from judgment unto life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've already passed from judgment unto life. He shall not come into the condemnation of this past he that believed. Tonight, the day we believe, tonight we're coming to hear and to rejoice and to shout, oh God, the praises. I pray you'll inspire our brother Jason Jackson mightily, oh God, at his own church and his own family. We bless them, oh father, in Jesus Christ's name. dismiss us now. I pray with your love, your grace, and your blessings. And I thank you, Father. I thank you that we can be together, gathered such as we are, and have one another &gt;&gt; as brothers and sisters in the family of God in Jesus Christ's name. Send us now. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Have a wonderful day. God bless you, brother. I worship my life. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Are you Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Wonderful. [Music] Praise God. [Music] My [Music] She see you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Are you [Music] happy? [Music] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, [Music] heat. Hey. [Music]
