We have a number of prayer requests and know that God is faithful to hear and to answer every need and every prayer. He has proven it over and over and over again. and you stand in faith this morning believing that all things are possible to them that believe. Praise the name of the Lord. Brother Ellie Gindle writes in he has a friend who's having a child, a boy in the next couple weeks and the doctor said the baby may have heart problems. So he asked me to pray and bring a prayer request before the church. So we're praying for a complete recovery. Amen. All things are possible. Sister Johanna Rav Barbara the Milka's wife is in need of prayer this morning for a ongoing condition and we just want to remember her before the Lord. Remember brother Sam Waldner also and brother Frank has brother Frank Fletcher has written in that he just would like us to all remember that it's uh we're in need of rain this morning naturally also spiritually we want the Holy Spirit to rain down but it's very very dry and it's unusual to ask for rain in Vancouver but God is God knows our needs amen so just ask brother John to come and take these requests to the throne of grace [Music] [Music] We want to lift up our voices at the end that people don't come to you with burden and perplexity. But we come to you with a real love in our heart. &gt;&gt; We want to see more of your pres. We want to have the presence of our husband come throughout this service. Come into this little meeting, Lord, into this place that we've dedicated to you. We want to dedicate our hearts to you. We want to dedicate our lives to you. We see the world that has fallen apart. Satan's Eden and the God of this evil age is taking quickly to a tribulation and to a hell. But we've been called to a another dimension. We've been called to another place. We believe our home, our future home calling to us. Come up a little high. Come away, little bride. We were in the spirit of the Lord's day. Lord, we see these things in the scripture. We've heard them by this prophet's message in our day that we've received. and you sent us ministers after your own heart that would get into a channel that would deliver us to the heart and the mind of God. This morning, we're coming with our cons. Lord, we're coming as a people that are affected by the supernatural. Lord, we're a people that look to the heart of God for our direction. We look to you for our healing. We look to you for our deliverance. We look to you Lord Jesus because you are the author and the finisher Lord of our faith. So Lord every need that's in the building today out across the internet Lord or what's been spoken we believe that it's already been met Lord according to your riches and glory. Lord I just want to lift up my hand as a testimony believing that you're the God that answers every prayer every need Lord. every individual, &gt;&gt; every heart, Lord, you know our thoughts. You know our desires. You know what we have need of. Father, we pray for each one of these spoken requests. So Hannah, Lord, that you would still in her life. Brother Fletcher, Lord, was down in Louisiana one day and they had in need of rain and you begin to pray and you sent a great outpouring, a great rain came across that place. We believe you can do the same for this valley. place that we live in Vancouver that you would just come and sweep by this place of the needs that brother Ellie's request that he brought. There's many unspoken requests. Gather all of our hearts, Lord, into your bosom today, Lord. And rapture us into heavenly places. Forgive us of our sins. Forgive us of any iniquity, Lord, individually and our family and our assembly and for the body of Christ, Lord. As life flows through the body, may Jesus Christ flow through the service today across the land and other places. May you move, Lord. We're expecting, Lord, you speak to our pastor today, expecting you to use the gift of his to minister spiritual food in this season of time. anoint him for service even now. Give him strength, Lord, to deliver his heart. &gt;&gt; Deliver the burden of the word of this Lord. &gt;&gt; He will respond, Lord. &gt;&gt; We say yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, fill our hearts with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Fill us with healing in our bodies, fill him with a deliverance in our spirit. &gt;&gt; That your people would truly be a joy and rich and we would please your heart as our husband. We give you the service and the offering, Lord. Multiply it in every heart and life to give to you. And those that cannot give, Lord, bless the people, minister to the sheep today in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John. You can have your seats this morning as they take up the offering. Let's just sing hold to God's unchanging hand. [Music] Hold to God. Oh God. [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Amen. [Music] [Applause] Oh my [Music] god. [Music] [Music] I need [Music] to [Music] Oh, [Music] God. [Music] Holy [Music] name and love is not worth [Music] so again. So they will never pass away. Just hold on hand. Hold on hand with your host. Hold down. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Just going to ask brother Michael Ray to come up. He's got an announcement for camp and let him come up and do that while we sing the chorus once more. Hold to God's unchanging hand. Hold God's unchanging hand. Build your hopes on things eternal. Go to God. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; Ah, love it. Wonderful to hear you respond that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, it's one week to camp and uh we're getting all the last little pieces worked out there. And hope everybody's excited. &gt;&gt; Brother Frank, I'm just going to put a a weak cap on that prayer for rain because I do want sun for summer camp. Okay. So if you're praying, be specific. Lord, we need rain up till Okay. July 27th is the date. All right. Uh we do have a counselor's meeting after the service uh just in the chapel. So all counselors, if uh after service, if you can be there nice and prompt, that would be wonderful. Uh next Monday at 9:00, we will be starting our junior camp there. So we want to make sure that everyone is prompt. uh 9:00 for counselors, 10 o'clock for campers. And so if you're a counselor, please be uh please be prompt there. Uh we do want to make sure that if just please let us know if you don't plan to arrive on camp at the start exact starting time. We just want to know any late comers if you if you do know that. Most of you have told us, but if you haven't, please just let myself or sister Abigail know. Sunday evening service or so I should say Sunday morning service after the service on August 2nd the grounds will be open for a uh for a picnic. You can stay there on grounds. The families can stay there and bring a picnic on grounds. Uh lunch is only for the for those registered on grounds as a camper. And we're doing something a little bit different this year. Brother Kim is going to be uh we're going to be utilizing the bus and for uh we're use it as an option. And so sometimes we have people that don't uh you know aren't able to come up to the grounds and they're they're trying to get a carpool and trying to figure out a way to get up there. And so we are going to make the bus available for Thursday senior camp uh morning at 8:00 here at the church. uh if you don't if you're not able to to get a ride, uh the bus is going to be available to do that. But we want to get an idea of who's available or who's uh who could require that option. So, we want you to call the office and talk to Sister Megan and uh let us know so we can kind of get an idea of of a count. Uh it's for those that don't have a ride. If you do have a ride and you're able to uh to make your way, please do so and and leave those seats available for those that can't. We're going to do the same thing for the evening services as well. And uh departing from cost cutter in Blaine. For the evening services, we've kind of set a time of 5:30. The bus would depart from cost cutter in Blaine and will also help uh uh take people to the camp uh for each of the Sunday uh each of the evening services on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and then on Sunday morning as well. Again, if you if that is something that you could use, please call the office and let us know. uh who uh so we can get an idea of on on some numbers meals on grounds. Uh just a little bit of a a note uh for I know people come up early for the services. Sometimes they come up a bit early on the services and sometimes maybe a hair too early because we're still eating dinner. Uh dinner is again meals are for registered campers only. It's not to come into the dining hall there and and uh and uh partake of a meal. Uh please. All right. My one last one here uh is a a little bit of a different policy change. Uh we have it in our camper rules, but it's maybe been kind of looked over, but we are eliminating the electronic devices on campgrounds as much as possible. And so, senior campers, uh do not bother bringing them this year, uh or you'll just be handing them over to me at the beginning of camp. Um, we're giving you a lot of warnings. So, you can get a disposable camera or something like that or even buy an alarm clock if you use your phone for those purposes. Uh, but we are going to try and just keep keep ourselves secluded. It's one thing I I surely enjoy about the camp is you can get up there and you can disconnect. But, uh, unfortunately over the time uh, cell signal becomes more and more prevalent and and you don't get so disconnected up there anymore. So, uh, we are going to again park your device at home. Worst case scenario, going to park it in the car and lock it there and throw away the key for the week and, uh, and not let it escape. All right, that's all I have. I'll have a wonderful service and we'll see you at camp in a week. We just uh we're excited for camp to come and see what God's going to do. And we're in great anticipation, expectation, and uh just also announcement. There will also be a a prayer meeting this Friday night uh just before camp. So, we just want to gather together and uh bring the young people before the Lord and the services and we just want God to move in a mighty way. We also have a number of people here that we'd uh that are visiting us from other places and um there's a brother Darren and brother Joel from Edmonton. Um, not sure where they're sitting, but we just want to just want to welcome you. There you are. God bless you. Just welcome. And um, I don't quite know how to say this name, but uh, the Debasi family from Sydney, Australia. Is that yourselves? Yes. Would you? We welcome you, Andrew, Rebecca, and Simon. and um and a sister Miriam who's going to school in Seattle, sister-in-law, brother Oed Doca, we just want to welcome you also. God bless you and all those that are streaming with us and we just want to welcome say God bless you and just trust that you'll have a wonderful service. Yes, I can see that, brethren. Everything's connected again. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to sing a sing a chorus here and we're going to turn the service to brother Ed and he's got a so let's just sing fill my cup Lord. Fill my cup Lord. &gt;&gt; I lift it up Lord. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven. Feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Fill my cup. Fill my [Music] thirst of my soul. Oh, great of heaven. Lead me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Build it up and make me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, it's a wonderful day. Summer's still continuing. Nobody's saying amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want rain. We We like the sunshine. &gt;&gt; And we especially like the inner sunshine. Amen. Uh we're thankful for everyone that has remained here behind and after the wedding. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought it is. We need to be miked. Okay. Is that better? &gt;&gt; All right. Uh I have switched it on actually, but I guess I didn't switch it far enough. So, we want to be tuned in this morning. Uh really been looking to the Lord for the last few weeks. And just so that you know as a congregation I had uh I was moving forward on a subject. I had notes and I just thought the Lord was going to inspire it about two weeks ago. It just turn right angles or left angles whatever you want to call it. And uh uh so I began on uh began not pondering but really searching out what the mind of God might be for this service. I'm just giving these like a preamble because uh I want you to think about it a wee bit. And then and then while I was in the midst of that, you know, a a whole section of scripture came to me and I thought, well, it doesn't apply. It doesn't really fit. I I wouldn't even know where to insert that. It wasn't until yesterday it all came back and I just couldn't shake it. You know, there's one thing I've learned about God. He says the same thing every time. &gt;&gt; It'll be a still small voice, but he just keeps saying the same thing. It doesn't have to come with thunder and lightning and pillars of fire, you know. He just keeps saying the same thing. And when you can't shake that, then you want to stand still and listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a a deacon that uh has been serving as a deacon for a long time, brother Jose. I wonder, brother Jose, if you would come forward. And we never have formally installed him, but he, you know, the brother Brown taught that we should call a deacon and ask him to serve and serve for, you know, a few months and then if he likes it and the people like him uh the people we like, brother Jose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Jose is more than just a figure and he's more than someone that just seats people when there's things to do and people in need. He's always been very very helpful. We want to pray for brother Jose. We're going to formally install him. But I want to say that brother Jose has a job that's been uh keeping him away sometimes on weekend way up in the mountains. So maybe you'll join with us as we prayer to pray to install our brother Jose formally. This is just a formality because he's been operating as a deacon and we're very very happy with his work and very happy with his dedication. But more than that, uh, we we need him. We want to see you. And every time brother Jose is away, uh, for a weekend or whatever, you know, he misses us. Isn't that nice? And we miss him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'll just ask the brothers to come and we'll, Brother Jose, if you'll step forward, please. Dear heavenly father, &gt;&gt; this is an honor to lay our hands upon a brother. &gt;&gt; When he was a far from this place, he heard your voice &gt;&gt; and he responded, oh God, and he's remained steadfast &gt;&gt; to that still small voice. He has heard that voice &gt;&gt; over and over and he has heeded that voice. &gt;&gt; And I pray, Father, you'll even make him more sensitive. &gt;&gt; He's been sensitive to the needs of the people. I pray, oh God, that you will anoint him for service, &gt;&gt; even more so. Send a double portion upon him. I pray that you will look upon him, Father, with such favor that you will change his job situation, that he might be able to be near the congregation. He desired to be living near the congregation. And you gave him a home, oh God, right, right next to the parking lot. And this is one of the few families that walked to church. I pray that you will bless him, oh God. Bless his wife, oh God. bless his children, Father. May the spirit of God that sent this word reveal it to them. May they feed upon it in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord. And now we receive him and with the with the call upon his life and that you will not only hear our words for installing a deacon but he has been he's been pleasing oh God to us and we thank you for him in the name of Jesus Christ. May he now take this position father which has been on his heart and he has requested this Lord. We lay hands upon him for that purpose &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. May his life be fulfilled &gt;&gt; with service to your bride. &gt;&gt; We thank you Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Jose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, another family that we're happy to have and haven't had for a long time is Wesley Ordeal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his wife Amanda and their three children. We're going to have Wesley and his uh family. I guess the children are going to come and sing. You'll do that, Brother Wes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My, these girls are getting big. Isn't it nice to have a family that sings? Naomi and mea. Mea and Naomi. And they called her son Dawson. I was happy for that. That's where my wife was born. That's where we lived. That's where your mother was born was. And so we're thankful for that. God bless you. Uh you're going to say a word of greeting to us. Certainly. All right. God bless you. It certainly is good to be home and uh to see all the smiling faces to be in this wonderful atmosphere of worship and um certainly appreciate the hour that we're living in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's a wonderful hour to be a part of and all these things that are coming to pass &gt;&gt; uh where people are blinded to. We've been it's been revealed to us and we're certainly thankful for that. And uh as my grandfather said, it's uh this is me. She's 12 years old. my oldest daughter and Naomi who is 8 years old and Dawson who is six and my wife is also with me and I know better than to say beyond that but we're certainly happy as a family to be here together and &gt;&gt; to be a part of uh of this family of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So looking forward to camp and all those wonderful things to come. So we trust that these couple of songs will be a blessing to you. Amen. [Music] There's a country [Music] where I'm going. There are matches standing tall. Here there's trles and triulation, but he will take me through it all. Through it all, he will take me. I may stumble and I may fall, but he loves me. He'll not forsake me. [Music] He will take me through it all. When I'm burdened and broken hearted, I think of that morning when he shall call. All my trles will then be over. He will take me through it all. Through it all. &gt;&gt; He will take me. I may stumble and I may fall. Why he loves me? He'll not forsake me. He will take me. Through it all, through it all, he will take me. I may stumble and I may fall, but he loves me. will not forsake me. He will take me through it all. He will take me through it all. Girls, before you go, first I'm a mela mea. Yeah, you and you can come back if you don't mind. First time I heard uh I'm amazed &gt;&gt; that Jesus loved me was me sang it here. &gt;&gt; That was lovely. And I'd like the congregation to stand and we'll just sing that together. I'm amazed. Would you lead us, Wesley, please? I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed how you came. Through your preious blood I found for me and my sins are [Music] all washed away. All my sins are wash away. Oh, I know. I love me. Oh, I [Applause] came. Through your precious blood I found [Music] and my sins are washed away. [Music] Oh, I [Music] rol [Music] [Applause] [Music] through your precious blood. I found my sh are washed. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads, please. We thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Not only our sins are washed away, but through the blood of Jesus Christ, we've been reconciled, &gt;&gt; brought back. Oh, God. We thank you, Father, that as we read the scriptures, we are approaching the author. Now, any man with strength can just turn the pages, but it takes more than turning the pages to hear what is spoken. Oh God, we pray that you'll give us ears to hear. And may we hear the voice of the spirit in this last days. And may the bride say the same thing &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray that you will anoint the congregation to hear. Anoint those that are streaming. Father, I pray that they will hear things that they need to hear. And I ask, oh God, you'll give us the capacity to receive, Father, these things that you have for us. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Wes. Amanda Naomi, &gt;&gt; Amen. Amanda, I called your name because you're important part of this. &gt;&gt; You have to be careful what you do sometimes. I took Wesley down to Tennessee and he saw a floor uh saw an Georgia peach and he liked it better than the Okonogan peaches. So that was it. That was the end of it. Now we've got a family and we're happy for it. &gt;&gt; We're happy for them being a a blessing at brother Yansy's church uh in Covington and sent greetings for us &gt;&gt; Wesley when you get to see brother Yansy again. God bless you all. We'll turn in the Bible, please, to uh John the 14th chapter. This is the text to things that are to be on the 6th of December, 1965. And after this was modern events made clear by prophecy and after that was leadership. Brother Brandham had communion and left. He said in that message which I have here, he said uh Jesus life was fixing to end here on earth. He was talking about our lives and the body that we have been given here to live and live here. He said Jesus life was fixing to leave here on earth. Jesus knew when he said those words because he knows all things. Jesus knew that in the messenger that he would send to reveal who through he would reveal himself &gt;&gt; would take this cho choose this scripture for things that are to be &gt;&gt; and his life was fixing to end on earth &gt;&gt; in a few days that very month and so he said Jesus' life was fixing to end and brother Brandham's life was fixing to end you don't put those things together by accident. &gt;&gt; We have to realize and don't be doubting. &gt;&gt; Don't be questioning. &gt;&gt; Just realize that our Lord has done special things &gt;&gt; and just ask him to give you a special visitation &gt;&gt; this morning that you might grasp those things &gt;&gt; that are intended for us at this time so we don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Very seldom did the disciples get too much. They generally were on the, you know, kind of the bottom end of of really understanding what was happening. What's happening? Where's the miracles? Where's where where's his power? Where's all of these things happening? And now he's silent. Where's where's the voice? Where's the great messages and so on at the end of Jesus' life? and we'll find I I just pray that God will give us the capacity to take the types and take the shadows and take those things. That's why they're called shadows of the scriptures and be able to apply them and see them today. Oh, that's now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's here. That's now. We're in it. Say, help us to see that. &gt;&gt; So, we'll read starting with 14 the first verse. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. And whether I go, you know, and the way you know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord. See, they weren't grasping it. Lord, we know not whether thou goest. And how can we know the way? And Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the father but by me. If you had known me, he's talking to people that's followed him and given everything to follow. If you had known me, you should have known my father also. And from henceforth you know him and have seen him. Philip sith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus sith unto him, have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. And how sayest thou then, show us the Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're so glad we've heard a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show us the Father. And on one on one of those services, Brother Brandham says, "Would you like to see the Father?" &gt;&gt; And before that service was over, they saw the Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be have you may have your seats. I want you to notice please if you still have your Bible open to the third verse. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, not where I will be, where I am, there ye may be also. I want you to notice these four things. I go to prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also. To receive, I'm just laying this as a foundation. To receive is to take oneself as a companion. To accept or acknowledge one to be such as he professes to be to receive you to to accept and receive one &gt;&gt; as they profess to be. Well, I have a lot of questions. I don't know about this. I really don't know. That's how you'll be received. But if you say, "I believe." Lord, help thou me to believe. That's how you're accepted and received. &gt;&gt; And then to receive is not to reject. You don't reject and you're not being rejected. To receive is to claim for oneself of that which when taken is not let go. &gt;&gt; He's not going to let you go. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to receive you and seize and lay hold upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And apprehend. &gt;&gt; Now, here's a quote in this things that are to be. And this is what I hope that you can lay hold of as the Holy Spirit spoke to me many years ago and many, many, many times since. Now he was telling them that after death there was there is life because I go and prepare a place that is to receive them. I go to prepare a place that is to receive them and and I'm going to be dwelling on the message was sent to receive you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it was sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. to that is to receive them shows that there he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life is ended. And what a consolation that ought to give to all of us to know that after this life is over. There is a life that we go into. And as you get older, that becomes more of a reality to you. As you begin to see the days of your life drawing close, then you begin to pack up closer, getting ready for that great event. It's a continuing of this life, this same life in another world, another place. If we could just grasp the depth of that. &gt;&gt; Now, many of you are probably uh younger, a whole lot younger than I am. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It has to do with where we are in God's word. &gt;&gt; This world is getting old. &gt;&gt; This world has become very, very violent and wicked and sinful. This world, as the scripture says, will wax worse and worse, and God will fold it up as he doth a garment and lay it aside. But he'll create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness and his children all his children &gt;&gt; will be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now I just wanted you to uh catch if you would that is if you if you could if brother Brandham was standing here and you could hear him say these words. I go to prepare a place for you. Jesus is saying this right at the very conclusion of his days on earth. And now in in the vessel that he chose to reveal himself right in the conclusion of his time on earth, &gt;&gt; he's saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place. Not not Brandon. He's not going to prepare a place. He's talking about someone. I go to prepare a place for you that where I am. And we have to come to a final conclusion. &gt;&gt; Yes. a resolve within ourselves. I'm looking down on you. I'm looking at you. We have to come to that resolve that there was a a lot of people knew Moses, but they didn't know the one that came back with him &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; from the desert. &gt;&gt; A lot of people knew William Brandon, but they didn't know the one that came back with him. And Jesus said, "He that is with me." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They knew Jesus of Nazareth and he's, you know, we have his mother and his brethren and his father here. That wasn't him. That's why they missed him &gt;&gt; because they knew him. But they didn't know him. Didn't know the one that was speaking through him. Didn't know the one. They hadn't had a relationship, an association, a companion. they hadn't become uh knowledgeable that they were they were uh had been received. Yesterday we had a ceremony here and a young man and a young lady sister Abigail and brother Jeremy and I knew that I was going to say something about this. They had to come down willingly to stand here. Amen. &gt;&gt; They had to come with the intent. &gt;&gt; He with the intent. I am receiving her &gt;&gt; and she is receiving me and I am giving myself and she is giving herself to the offices according to the word of God. And that's precisely why we've come to church. That's why you're here this morning because I've come to receive something and I've come to be received. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it that you would like me to know something about? I I want to expand on this being received. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that God will send a man to the pullpit &gt;&gt; to say something that you need for your eternal home. &gt;&gt; Are you aware that your eternal home Jesus talked about, I have mansions. I'm gone to prepare mansions. He has gone to prepare a a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Yes. And just like your mother when she was carrying you in the womb, she had certain desires. Or or I could I I have in my notes here, the boy that ate ate the petals on his bicycle because his body was craving sulfur. &gt;&gt; Wh what who told him that there was sulfur in the rubber? &gt;&gt; Who told him that? who told him that he's eating the maybe the rubber off the ends of the pencils because of there's a call in the body for sulfur. Let me say this to you. Beyond beyond what that boy knew, beyond what you know, beyond what you understand about yourself, beyond what you think the message is, God has placed a craving within you for realities of God. And you'll never be satisfied until you come to that place. And then it's a relationship that you enter into with the person of the we say the message. The message is a person. It's it's Jesus Christ in his revealing making known himself to you. That's what the message is. &gt;&gt; And when you have a relationship, that kind of a relationship, &gt;&gt; you don't you'll never question it. &gt;&gt; Are you born? Of course I'm born. I counseledled with a man on the phone who may be streaming right now way far thousands of miles from here in the United States. He called me. He got a phone number to the office from another person. Turned out to be his mother. And I called him back. I wasn't going to. I didn't have time. And then I thought before I leave the house, I must call this man. So I called him. He said, "Brother Briscoll, I heard your name when I was just a boy. I've heard your name at church." And he said, and he began to relate his life and so on and the things and events that had taken place. And it was sad in one way. And as I begin to speak to him, he's talking about the message and the message. I just stopped him. I said, "The message." People say, "Oh, they're in the message." Or, "I'm in the message." That isn't that isn't even a phrase. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The message is a person. &gt;&gt; And when you say, "I'm in Christ." That's the only way you That's the only phrase that would even make any sense. &gt;&gt; I'm in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in Christ. We are in We are in the word and the word is in us. and we have a relationship and and it speaks to me. He speaks to me &gt;&gt; and I have a certain love that wells up in my heart and maybe a tear even come to your eye in your private time and you just you just talk to him and he talks back to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I spoke to him. He's a minister's son. ministered this message, the minister's son, and it was my privilege to talk to him. I preached to him for about half an hour. See, there's that's one thing that I must want to convey. I know all of these other ministering brethren have conveyed sought to convey to you but I feel it is uh it it's something that needs to be so emphasized that it finally will cut away and perhaps it could cut away some of the you know just relig religiosity or we're going to church and you're in church and it's a Sunday morning and so on. We could get rid of all of that just for a season. So, I'm here to hear some things and I need the Holy Spirit to come upon me and to come into me and open up my eyes. So, I I could have the same many of the questions that the that the apostles had and the disciples had. We have many of the same things, many of the same kind of questions. &gt;&gt; And so, I pray that God will answer some of those. So Jesus said in one scripture, I just like to give you a scenario. Jesus said, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I have that's not a theme, but I just felt I would like to say that the forerunner John, he certainly his message and the theme of his message was to turn his disciples and let the world know I'm a forerunner. I just I'm forerunning. Well, if he's forerunning somebody, then you want to say who is he forerunning? Who's that person? Right. &gt;&gt; And so then he, you know, he behold the lamb of God. And here's a man walking on the on the pathway and walking into the mud of the Jordan River to be baptized by his cousin. As far as the world was concerned, his cousin, let me tell you friends, that takes revelation &gt;&gt; to see that that was more than his cousin. That was more than just a man. That takes revelation. And and and no matter how much revelation person had, you could never ever grasp. But by him were all things made that was made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's the creator of heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; He's the embodiment of the godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; How can we grasp that? And we're not sitting here today saying, "I have it all." Nobody has it all. But we just pray, oh God, take this teaspoon full of ashes that are in my brain and and expand it. Oh God, I can see that. That's why the prophet spoke of things that that people, even myself, we all have read things and say, well, you know, I I don't get that. Well, help me to get it. Wasn't said for no purpose at all. Help us to understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; So to receive is to take with oneself as we said earlier to accept or acknowledge one that is that uh to accept or acknowledge one to be such as he professes to be. &gt;&gt; It's a lot of people profess to be Christians. But have they been received? The receiving is when the one unveils himself. And if he is the word, then it's the word that has unveiling. And the unveiling cannot just come in a meaning like you know uh uh a meaning that we comprehend or we understand or have you ever seen anybody dress and you might say don't can take this too personal now but somebody dresses say uh well that's maybe not your style and you might say well I do say to my wife what do they think when I put that on in the morning &gt;&gt; and and and I don't know if you've ever said that but if you have and quite a few of you are smiling so I think you have said that what do they think when they do that you know what what do they think when they look how can I think that just looks so wild that looks so terrible what do they think when they put it on &gt;&gt; I wasn't going to say this but I There was one of our sisters that was sitting down here. I don't want to embarrass anybody, but they were sitting down here in the wedding yesterday. And we had a photographer, two photographers, and her flashing pictures, etc., etc. for you that were at the wedding saw this lady and she's taking pictures and if she's streaming or she's even here that's fine. This is this is not bad. But uh one of our sisters walked in and was seated and uh I was sitting back here and I I just observed her and she become focused on this sister and she just studied it. while you study it. I was watching her study. I thought, "No, that is more than for a picture. She respected she didn't take a picture. She just studied it." And and I knew that she was being convicted in her heart when she saw the way the sister was dressed. &gt;&gt; And then she she looked up and she was, you know, like she was studying what was happening, etc., etc., but it was just like a magnet. Then she turned right back down, looked at the sister again. Then she looked up again the second or third time. And then she looked right back. And every time she looked, it was a it was a special look. She just looking. Then she began to after about three, four times, she began to kind of adjust her own garments uh just to be covered a little bit better. And uh before brother Tom got up here and preached a message, that sister had already preached a message. But she didn't know she was preaching a message. She wasn't trying to preach. She wasn't saying any words. But I know that that woman was spoke to profoundly &gt;&gt; at the wedding service. &gt;&gt; And this is the kind of thing that there's there's a call within people. There's a call within the individual &gt;&gt; to be &gt;&gt; to be what we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not because we have a bunch of doctrines and we have to live by. &gt;&gt; It's not that. &gt;&gt; If you think that then you really need this service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't live the way we live or we don't live by a certain code or dress code or whatever more. It's something that a person desires. &gt;&gt; You desire it. You desire a certain life. &gt;&gt; You want to be pleasing to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to turn a corner in a few moments here. So, I want you to really hang on, please. In the things that are to be I'm going to give this same uh same quote back again, please. Now, he was telling them Jesus was telling them that after death there is a life. So he was speaking about another life. Let's not think about death so much. We think about another life. And because I go, he wasn't going into the details of his suffering and the and Calvary and all the in in deep doctrine. I'm going to save the world and take the sins of the world. He could have been saying so much, but to his disciples, he's emphasizing a certain something that there's a a life after this life. And I'm going now to prepare a place. He wasn't talking about the the horrible agony of his going. &gt;&gt; He could have been saying so much about the suffering, &gt;&gt; about the blood, and about all the things. He could have been saying volumes about that. But he says nothing about that. He just saying simply, I'm going &gt;&gt; and the purpose is to prepare a place &gt;&gt; for you. And now a prophet he comes and he in in in in speaking about uh preparing a place to describe that he talks about you and me &gt;&gt; before we came when we were in a place before we were ushered into the world. &gt;&gt; This gets deep friends. It's fine. He talks about God before God began his creation. He removed the water off the face of the earth. And then the power of his word be to take place. And he said like you when the water was moved &gt;&gt; in the womb of your mother &gt;&gt; and you were issued into this world, &gt;&gt; there was already a a body for you. &gt;&gt; You took your breath. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the spirit was there to receive to receive you. And you were there to receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you didn't receive it, you had a stillborn &gt;&gt; five fingers here, five there, five toes, five toes, perfect maybe conception, maybe a perfect time of of of the of the pregnancy while a child was being everything was formed. The mother ate the right things and you had a healthy body. But if that spirit didn't receive you &gt;&gt; and you receive it, it was a stillborn and no one would ever know was it a gifted child, was it a a certain kind of a child, was it an aggressive child, was it a passive child? We wouldn't know because there's no spirit to be animated by that body. &gt;&gt; And friends, we're saying something more. &gt;&gt; Church and the gospel is more than just a book called a Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ is more than just coming to church on Sunday. More than hearing sermons or hearing specials or singing songs, more than a formality. If we miss the person of the gospel, we've missed absolutely everything. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He is a person. And you want to say in this service, oh Lord God, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; come make yourself personally known to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; More than coming to church &gt;&gt; because I go to prepare a place. I go to prepare a place that is receive you. Apostle Paul talks about the scattering of Israel, which I may get to a little later, and the gathering and the gathering of them. I just want to drop this in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Close. &gt;&gt; I asked God to give you, this isn't deep. This is very superficial, but it's very profound. &gt;&gt; At the same time in history, you know, I said earlier, you have to be able to take the types. All right? Jesus was saying to his disciples, don't go to the don't go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Don't go to the other places and take nothing with you. And then the next time he said, if you have a coat, take two or and take a sword and take the money and take your script and don't take all these things. It was a different kind of instruction a little later on. And now at this time here the and this is an era that we happen to live in. I happen to live in as brother Bram talks about the restoration of the gifts and all that. We saw all of that. We witnessed all of that. It was incredible. Absolutely incredible. And and you can't, you know, you can't replay it. It's not something you just replay like a tape. But we saw all that and then just because God was making ready a kind of an atmosphere for a birth and then the message comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all kinds of other voices come. Brother Bram talked about Velmer Gardner. There's WV Grant and Oel Jaggers and AA Allen and Tommy Osburn and Tommy Hicks and and uh and uh and Billy Graham and all of this is sweeping over the earth. And in the midst of it comes uh a voice. It was a different kind of a voice &gt;&gt; because they would come to the platform and say this gentleman would say good evening friends &gt;&gt; good morning friends &gt;&gt; and then a little while say you know I can't do anything &gt;&gt; until he comes &gt;&gt; and then when he would come there was like a holy hush would come upon the people. Sydney Jackson told me when there was hundreds of thousands of people in South Africa, he said when he would come to the platform and when he would say he's here, he said like a hush fell over. He said even the dogs, he said at most gatherings dogs are fighting and animals are running through. He said even dogs are not barking. There's no disturbance like something holy fell over the congregation. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said when brother Brandham prayed the last prayer, he says for several hours. And brother Cindy Jackson was there participated and he said for several hours supernatural things were taking place. He and and these things might move us but it wasn't it wasn't it. What it really was is that the Lord Jesus Christ was making himself known, doing the same thing, doing the same kind of signs and wonders. But that wasn't it. It was far more than that. It was when the word finally came, did the people digest? Did the people have the people entered into a relationship with the one who was doing the miracles? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he goes on to talk about this body. When this body dropped here into the earth like the baby is dropped, also there is a an immortal body. Also there is an immortal body. Hello. Also, there is an immortal body. There is an immortal body &gt;&gt; waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand all that? I don't understand all of that, but here we have it. Oh, what a great thing we are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; We are now. He said, in Christ Jesus. Can you make that profession so that he will receive you as you profess to be? We are now in Christ Jesus. I may not understand the depths of it, but we are now. I personally am now in Christ Jesus. Somebody calls him a message. I call him Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Uh I am in him. &gt;&gt; I'm united to him. I'm married to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a great thing. Babes in Christ, children of God, waiting for the full deliverance at the coming of our Lord Jesus to receive us up into himself when the body, this mortal will take on immortality. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And then I'm just taking one line out of another paragraph, paragraph 62. He talks about this place. He said, "This is a pest house." You don't think it's a pest house? &gt;&gt; They had a shooting here in Cloverdale late this last week. They had a shooting in in uh White Rock last night. They had four Marines shot and the fifth one has just died down there. Well, we said, "Well, that's because of communication. We hear all these things." Well, it's a whole lot more than that. They're just horrible violence. The earth, I feel, is convulsing under &gt;&gt; the violence of the world. And the scripture says, "As it was, &gt;&gt; as it was," &gt;&gt; Jesus saying, "Like it was, so will it be." &gt;&gt; So now, as it was, &gt;&gt; and I looked at that phrase all through the scripture, and there's many places. And we really need to say, "As it was, so is it." As it was in the life and ministry of so of Jesus Christ. So is it now? These things are happening. you you you you'll finally say to yourself, "It's a whole lot more than me just getting ready to preach. It's a whole lot more than me just going down to church." &gt;&gt; And and the and the people listening, it's a whole lot more than me just going into church and sitting down. Speak to me, oh God. &gt;&gt; And I've asked him to do that this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or today. And the and he said this, "Oh, but the other one." He was talking about this place being a pest house. But oh, the other one. How many know what a pest house is? Eight or 10. How many know what a pest house is? Yes. A pest house. When I was a kid and you had diptheria or some of the diseases you don't even know about, they would take a piece of paper and nail it to the door. Stick it to the door. That this was quarantined. This house is quarantined because the people who are in there are sick. The people who are in there have a a communicable disease and you must not go in there. this is a pest house. &gt;&gt; They didn't say it was a pest house, but they would say it's quarantined. You're not allowed to go in there. &gt;&gt; That was on the houses. Now, uh you'll go into a you'll go into a hospital and they'll say you're not allowed to go in there. I don't know if Jim Pritchard is here, but you know know him as David Daniels. He sits so out in the front out in the shop out in the fellowship room much of the time, but I was in the hospital a few months ago. They never expect him to live and they just about wouldn't let me in there. And I had a whole team of people just serving him. and one person who was his personal male nurse as one of the large hospitals downtown. And they were they were hesitant to let me go in. Well, you've got a scrub. I said, "Okay." So, I had to scrub gown and a mask to go in there because of the disease. Do you know why? This world is a pest house. &gt;&gt; It's a pest house. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of things floating around. &gt;&gt; It's floating on the internet. &gt;&gt; It's a floating They're they're contam they're contemptable things &gt;&gt; and they're they're contaminating things &gt;&gt; and they'll contaminate in your soul &gt;&gt; and your mind and corrupt it. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know that's true. &gt;&gt; And what are we preaching for? That we be free from that. We're not preaching some social gospel. The social gospel will never do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sharpness of the two-edged sword must come and separate us from that and say, "Oh, God, thank you." &gt;&gt; Brother Richard Drake's daddy was the deacon in our church before he passed away. And his testimony was, "When I heard the message," he said, "It just took the height off my back, but I loved it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Takes the height off our back, &gt;&gt; but we love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love it? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, he talked about a past house. Excuse me for taking my time. He said, "The other one is called my father's house." He said, "I'll go and prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; Take you out of this pest house &gt;&gt; and deliver you into my father's house." &gt;&gt; That's what the message is all about. &gt;&gt; That's what the message is. The message is the person of Jesus Christ receiving you unto himself. That the purpose of it is that where he is, where I am, he said you might be there also. How are you going to get there? By receiving him. &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can be there. And he has to receive you. And I'm trying to convey to you today the coming of the message in whatever form it comes. Say, "Well, I don't really care for that minister. He, you know, he he talks too quiet or he talks too fast or he he does this or he does that." &gt;&gt; But what if it's Christ? himself &gt;&gt; seeking to receive you a certain way. &gt;&gt; And you have to wade through some, &gt;&gt; as I said to the young couple just yesterday before we prayed, it's not always those that you admire that God is going to have. You know what an impress impressed is? Now, I'll just enlarge on it a wee bit. To impress somebody is to to take on an image by a blow. It's not, you know, velvet gloves sort of thing. Handle people real nice and do you want to be happy and do you want to be That's not the gospel of Jesus Christ. Are you ready to repent? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn from your sin. &gt;&gt; Be separated from the world. &gt;&gt; That's what God calls for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, &gt;&gt; so I said, I'll go and prepare and I'll take you out of this pest out and deliver you into my father's house. Amen. There you are. Take you out of this earthly pest house. He's gone to prepare a place. Some of the last words of the messenger, a perfect place where no evil exists, no sickness exists, no old age exists, no death exists. &gt;&gt; Only if you understand that can you understand why he says that civilization is of the devil. Because you have to add another phrase because it came by sex. &gt;&gt; We are all here by an earthly birth and by that earthly birth we die. But there's another birth that we live. &gt;&gt; There's another birth that takes us from this pest house &gt;&gt; and we're not a part of the pest house. We're not a part of the system. Don't become enamored with whether it be education or whether it be this civilization what it provides for you. the shiny cars or boats or nice homes or whatever more. It's fine. We have to have it. But that's not our life. It's part of the pest house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to deliver us from it. &gt;&gt; He said it'll be another civilization so far beyond this, &gt;&gt; so far beyond it that it can't even hardly come into our minds. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have to have it. We have to we have to have our education. We have to have our jobs. We have to do all of these natural things, pay our bills, etc., etc. But it's not our life. That's not what we make our life out of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think God's going to call you, not see you through, he's going to see you through somehow, some way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he says this, this is the phrase, it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection. &gt;&gt; I was saying just a little bit earlier, please just be alert for a moment. when when the prophet's ministry broke on the scene, somehow the Jews, natural Jews from all over Europe, and I have many, many scriptures where God says, "I will scatter you and I'll scatter you into all the nations. I'll scatter you." And then I have other scriptures that have it here, and I'll gather you. I'll gather you out of all the nations. Isn't it amazing that he scattered him for decades? Hundreds of years he scattered them. And isn't it amazing that right at the time that a messenger has come here to gather a bride for Jesus Christ that Jesus reveals himself. And isn't it amazing that God begins to call the people. I even talked to a Jew. I talked to one who's a who was the originator of a a kibbutz in Israel. And I said, "How is it that you came?" Well, he said, 'You know, it's a He said it was it was kind of strange. He couldn't explain it. He said, I'm the eldest of four sons, and I I would as being the eldest, he says I would fall heir to our business, and my father had a tailoring business, a very successful business in Austria. But he said something came over me. Something came over me, and I felt I I have to return to Israel. There was no Israel. There was no state. This was 1939. And he missed the first world, the Second World War. He missed the Holocaust. He missed everything. And he realizes that that God, my family was there. My children were there. And I was talking to him about the kibuts and the economics of the kibuts. And and he said, "You see these cows?" He said, "We get the dairy cows from the Netherlands." He said, "But here they give 30% more milk than they do there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What happened? We don't know what happened. Even a cow answered the call. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He said, "See our see our cotton that we grow." He said it they this the same cotton they grow in Egypt just over here. He said we get double the production what they get there. &gt;&gt; Think of it. What is it? God said he's going to prosper. Even the soil is answering &gt;&gt; to the creator. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And the same time God begins to gather them back. He sends a messenger to the Gentiles to gather us back to himself. Oh, I think that's so wonderful. Can't we say thank you, Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; At the same time, we say that's an accident. That's a big accident. &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful accident. &gt;&gt; That goes far beyond any doubt I ever had. &gt;&gt; I'll gather them back. And it's the power of that word. Now, &gt;&gt; what is it in? His name was Kaman. What was it in Kaman? He said something. I just began to have such a desire. I had to return to Israel. There was no Israel. There was no state. All it was was desert and rocks and and he became the originator, one of two men that originated kaboots where we were. We stayed there, stayed nearby. I saw the children went through the school, went through the places where they had the children living. And I've thought about that multitude of times. What caused him? And I met others. What was in it? What kind of a call did they hear? &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming down to my message. What kind of a call do you hear &gt;&gt; the first time? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I I wasn't even trying. Somebody handed me a book or somebody handed me a tape or or like I heard this voice. But what was it in you &gt;&gt; that kept nibbling? &gt;&gt; What was it in you that kept wanting to hear more? You had a place, &gt;&gt; God's house, &gt;&gt; calling you to it. &gt;&gt; Did he stop? No. Then you came to church. Then you began to hear about it and the call even maybe became even more distinct &gt;&gt; and you went through rough waters. That's good. You had to make tough decisions. That's good. Jesus did too. &gt;&gt; The disciples did also. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, while I was there, there was steps like this in Israel on the on the uh right to the wall of the old city. They're just outside the wall. And the guide was taking us and and said, "Now here on these steps, Gale would take his students and teach them here." And Apostle Paul was a student of Galo, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I thought maybe Apostle Paul sat right on these steps. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus walking all through Jerusalem and and he knew he was there. &gt;&gt; He knew he was getting stuffed with religion. &gt;&gt; He knew he was getting stuffed with the law and becoming a scholar of the law. But Jesus knew, I'll reveal myself to him. And as I said to the young couple just in a few words I I gave yesterday at the reception. It it was a he was one that was so articulate with the law. He knew it inside out. He said everything that he knew he counted as loss. He counted as dross that he might win Christ. &gt;&gt; And Christ was the Christ wasn't against the law. He was the fulfillment of the law. So he was saying I I I gave all that learning and that intelligence and that intellect up. Jesus could have called him. Jesus could have called him then with his own vocal cords. &gt;&gt; But rather than call him with his vocal cords. He called him by a a a heavenly calling. &gt;&gt; And he was smitten to the ground. The others weren't smitten. &gt;&gt; He was smitten. and he was going he had letters in his possession to take Christians that were following Christ into uh in in in imprisoned them. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine friends Cloverdale Bible Way and all those that may be streaming this service how absurd that may be by today's standards. &gt;&gt; This person's an enemy of Christ. And here God takes and he he falls to the ground and he cries out this man with all the answers &gt;&gt; run into a presence he didn't have an answer for. &gt;&gt; Who art thou Lord? &gt;&gt; I'm Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why? Why do you kick against the pricks? I'm Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why do you resist this? When did God begin to cut to the others? To the others, he saw some fishing. He said, "Follow me." That's what they heard. Now, I'm I'm I'm casting a net out to the congregation. I want I want to ask you seriously, what was that that they heard? Did they just hear, "Follow me. I'll make you fishers of men." Is is that what made them give everything up and give leave their father tending their net and leave family and leave all the ties that were precious to them? What was that? &gt;&gt; What is that in a person? What is that in you? &gt;&gt; Right. I can go back. I was your age. I was your age. I was your age. I was your age. My wife was the age of you girls. And I had to ask myself, this isn't this isn't a new teaching. This is an old gospel and it's still brand new and it's new for all of us. &gt;&gt; What is it that calls a person? &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, uh, I can't really explain it." I can't either. Do you have it? Is there something in there? I'm going to appeal to it this morning. H &gt;&gt; how long are we expecting it, you know, to wind all up in a rapture and all the rest of it? But we we need to realize that the preaching of the message, the preaching of Christ is actually him receiving you. &gt;&gt; Amen. from meeting to meeting, &gt;&gt; from messenger to messenger, from preacher to preacher is appealing to something that's within you. And if you look back and say, "Oh, that was a good message." That's not the point. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Calling &gt;&gt; and the miracle is you have something to respond to it that responds. As I thought about this, now I'll take you through the curve that I had to go through. What kept coming to me was the prodal son and the two sons. The two sons. And a certain man had two sons. &gt;&gt; And the one said, "Give me all the substance that be that befalls to me." And he went and took his into another country and and spent all of his substance with riotous living. And one says with harlotry and so on so forth. I don't want to bother your mind but with righteous living and after he'd spent all he became he took a took work &gt;&gt; and he was feeding the swine and you know the story and he fain would have filled his belly with the husks of the swine &gt;&gt; and and I don't know how it happens. I don't know what happened but he came to himself Right? &gt;&gt; Thought, "Hey, wait a minute. &gt;&gt; My father's got servants. They got food. And here I'm trying to eat this old hust that I feed the pigs. &gt;&gt; Uh, I'll return to my father." &gt;&gt; That was the grace of God to heal. &gt;&gt; Just him coming to himself. &gt;&gt; And there might be somebody here and no doubt is or on the internet. And I thought while I was studying, I'll just say to you brothers, you know what it is like and God will speak to you. God spoke to me and says you'll speak to somebody on the internet today. &gt;&gt; So I'm calling someone on the internet &gt;&gt; that is streaming the service. &gt;&gt; And do you know that God is calling you? &gt;&gt; And maybe you're just waking up and saying, "I'll return. &gt;&gt; I'll go back to father's house. You don't even know where Father's house is, but he went to prepare a place in Father's house. &gt;&gt; He's calling you from the pest house &gt;&gt; to Father's house. &gt;&gt; And sent a prophet to call you and let you know in his last words, &gt;&gt; there's a life beyond this life. &gt;&gt; This is a pest house. At its best, it's a pest house. &gt;&gt; And one thing is certain. If time goes on, you're going to die like every man dies. Like every dog dies, like every animal dies. Man will die. Woman will die. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; He's talking about another life. And that life isn't didn't come by sex. That life came by the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the word that he spoke was the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; In him was life. Not this life. In him was life. and the life was the light of menise. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; How marvelous it is for one at the stature of Apostle Paul &gt;&gt; to write, as I said to the young couple yesterday, a letter from prison. I thought I would start with that. 19 words from prison. Brethren, follow be be followers of me &gt;&gt; and those and mark those that do so &gt;&gt; as as I do or as we do. &gt;&gt; Mark them. That's that's good for you. All of you young men, young ladies especially. Mark them that are godly. Mark them that are feeders of the word. &gt;&gt; Talk to them. Make friends of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be in that kind of a home and that kind of an atmosphere of people that are sold out unreservedly to the message which is Christ. &gt;&gt; So this man, this son said, I I'll I'll return. I'll go to my father's house. His servants are treated better than this. And now I'm talking about receiving them. People say, "Well, I was saved and we think that that's when we were received." No, the receiving is the whole process. The Jews coming back to Israel was over many, many years. And they were answering a call. They did they couldn't define the call and they couldn't define what was in them. And we all experienced that as believers, as Christians. I became a believer then or he revealed himself to me. That's not the end all. That's the beginning of a new life. &gt;&gt; But here this morning, here today, I know because the Holy Spirit witnessed to me, &gt;&gt; there would be those here, maybe visitors, maybe those that have been here for years, but within is a hunger. And I say God is appealing to that hunger. &gt;&gt; And God is making moves. And God is giving messages. And God is opening his word for one purpose that it might come to the people to uh to create that appetite or to satisfy that appetite and know that &gt;&gt; he's receiving you. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says while the son was returning back and he was a a great far off &gt;&gt; great distance away &gt;&gt; the father saw him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm speaking to this congregation. I'm speaking to every soul that'll ever hear this message. And the father even saw you when maybe you were a long ways away. And there might be somebody who's a long ways away. And to those of you that may be uh faithful, solid believers, I want to say to you, there are times when he leaves the 90 and nine to go after one. Yes, &gt;&gt; there might be somebody that's after the one &gt;&gt; that the that the Lord Jesus, the great shepherd, is after the one. Or there are times when we as believers feel very very distant. &gt;&gt; I want you to know the father sees you. &gt;&gt; And the father just didn't look through a pair of binoculars and see him a far off. When he saw him, he got up and the Bible says he ran. The father ran. God running. to the son because it was his son. &gt;&gt; It was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh &gt;&gt; and he ran to him. People sit in church and don't realize that God is looking to see a person maybe a far off. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what you've been through. &gt;&gt; You just make a move and he'll run toward you. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was receiving him &gt;&gt; and he embraced him &gt;&gt; and kissed him. &gt;&gt; He was receiving him. &gt;&gt; But that wasn't the end of it. There was a robe hanging in the closet. &gt;&gt; His robe. &gt;&gt; That would be part of the receiving. &gt;&gt; That wasn't all. He had a ring for him. &gt;&gt; And he has he that running for you has a ring for you. It's unmmerited favor. There's nothing that you can do, nothing you can do, young people. It's no good that we can and nothing good that you can do. He has a ring for you. &gt;&gt; You may be, you may be a believer, born again and all the rest of it, but perhaps you haven't had the ring slipped on your finger yet. The ring of unmarited grace, &gt;&gt; the ring of the wedding ring. &gt;&gt; And besides that, he was still being received. Besides the robe and besides the ring, there was a calf in this stall. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The fatted calf. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lovely calf. The treasure of the family. He said, "Go and kill a fatted calf. My son that was lost has come home again." &gt;&gt; All of this was part of the receiving. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I think when I hear I hear hear the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, I'll read it for you in prayer. He says, "Almighty God, the author of this book through Jesus Christ, we pray. We're thankful for what we've already heard tonight. Yes, &gt;&gt; if we should punctuate this meeting by saying amen and go home. It was good to be here. &gt;&gt; For we know that of this word that we might know the hour that we're that we're living. That's why we're here. That you might know the hour that we're living in. If we know the hour we're living, then we can prepare for that hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we go in blindly, not knowing what we what or where, he said, then we don't know how to prepare. So, Father, we pray that you let us see the ark there. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder how many even this morning you see more than brothers and sisters, more than just someone preaching, &gt;&gt; more than just a service, but you see the ark there. &gt;&gt; He's talking about a different kind of sight. I pray, oh God, &gt;&gt; wipe the world away &gt;&gt; and clear our eyes sight &gt;&gt; and let us see the ark there. And not only the ark, he said the open door, the door open &gt;&gt; and the message calling. &gt;&gt; May you see and may you hear and may you be moved. May you see the ark there and the open door. &gt;&gt; Who's he referring to? He's going all the way back to Noah. But this now was as it was in the days of Noah &gt;&gt; at the same time. May they see the ark. May we see the ark there? who's the person of Jesus Christ and the open door &gt;&gt; and the message calling. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm so burdened. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I don't know if I can finish this service because God spoke to me. There are people that are going to fit fall into these categories. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody's been a far away. Yeah. You you know all about father's house and yeah you know about the servants and you know about you have a a knowledge of all of these things &gt;&gt; but you just been carrying on being battered back and forth by the world and yet you know well and maybe you put father's house like the prophet said after death but maybe it's a lot closer Did you think? &gt;&gt; And maybe you've been one who said, "I'll return. I'm going to return." Maybe you're one that has made that decision some time ago. Maybe you've made that decision and but it it never occurred to you that the father's running, &gt;&gt; God running &gt;&gt; to you. This is a a son Yes. &gt;&gt; He deserves a robe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He deserves a rain. &gt;&gt; He deserves a feast. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be the others. We don't want to be the other son. All he knows is to do is to work and sweat. I worked through the heat of the day. I've never never ever done anything wrong. I haven't violated my father's word. I've just stayed and I've been to church all the time and I gave my tithe and I just keep going. But I forgot how to rejoice. I forgot how to be happy. I forgot how to dance. I forgot how to be merry. I forgot how to I forgot all about my brother. In fact is I'm upset that he's having a big feast and and the people and all the neighbors are in rejoicing. And the father shows his his character and he comes out and says, "Son, son, it's meat for us. This is the right thing for us to be happy now for my our my son that was gone, that was dead, is now alive again. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's made for us that we should rejoice. &gt;&gt; And the son says, "I've never I've never contravened. I've never violated any of your laws. I've always been a good boy. I've I've worked I've gone to the fields and I've worked in the heat of the day and I I've just been faithful. And he said, "All that I have is yours. &gt;&gt; You can go anytime and have a feast. &gt;&gt; You can have the calf anytime. You can put on the best robe anytime." And I need to say to some of you faithful people, the robe is hanging there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to take another look at the ring. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I had a man look at my ring here, my wedding ring few days ago. Just a contractor. And he said, "Nice ring." &gt;&gt; Well, it's not just the ring. It's what it means. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And who slipped it on? &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "He slipped on the ring of unmarited favor." &gt;&gt; None of us are worthy of it. None of us are worthy. But he did it. He slips it on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could look at it and say, "Unmarit's favor. I wasn't worthy of this, but he gave it to me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I asked myself, and I'm going to be closing soon. What is it that called? I can tell you one thing. I just tell you this personally. Whenever I hear a tape I have never ever gotten tired of in all the years of my life. And like you young people especially, I talked to Ella who you know is she's in Portland today on her way to Portland. Her her daddy and mom are taking her down to Portland and and You know, you got it good. Here's a girl got sores on her legs in a big cast. And I don't know why. I said, "Father, if you could tell me why she's not healed. I don't know why yet. We believed." But I said to her, I said, "Ella cramp, want you to listen to the the healing lines &gt;&gt; and hear the prophet of God." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Telling the people telling the people where they are and their names and their heritage and and their sickness and disease or what's on their heart. And you're standing here for someone else. You're standing here for a man. It's the man is bes I see a man beside you. Who is that? That's not William Brandon. That's the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the message. &gt;&gt; And when I hear that, I'm pulled. &gt;&gt; I have a call and I'm being called by it. Are you feeling the call? Are you hearing the call? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I said to Ella, you listen to them. She says right away, I'll do that, Grandpa. &gt;&gt; Right away. never complains about her situation, never complains about all the pain that she's been in and months and now years. Friends, as a congregation, I'm talking to you as a man. I'm talking to you as a father. I'm talking to you as a grandfather and a great-grandfather. I would do anything. I would give anything. I'd give my own life to see that she was healed. I said, 'Well, there has to be some purpose. My father knows about it. &gt;&gt; Maybe the purpose is that it's making somebody more God conscious, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe it's making somebody &gt;&gt; not only more God conscious, but giving them a a greater intensity, a greater hunger to find out, &gt;&gt; you know, Father, what what is it that you've sent me? &gt;&gt; Maybe someone is in the message more than they would be if the child was healed. But I don't know. All I say is we have every reason &gt;&gt; to to feel very human, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Don't look at the ministry as being something way up there and they're not affected. We are affected by things. We're affected by people and we are burden bearers. &gt;&gt; We can't help that. &gt;&gt; These brothers bear a lot of burdens not only here locally but well beyond this. And why? One thing that I know that we receive and I receive it from these brothers when they preach. One thing I know, this message is nothing other than the very person of Jesus Christ moving amongst the congregation, moving amongst the people &gt;&gt; receiving them. [Music] &gt;&gt; I see it as a as a as an actual motion. And I begin to ask myself, Father, when were when was this father receiving his son? Was it when he saw him a far off? Was it when he was running? Was it when he kissed him? Was it when he received him into the house? Was it when he put the robe on? Was it when he put the finger ring on his finger? When was he receiving him? He's receiving him all the time. &gt;&gt; He's receiving you in every service. He's receiving you when you hear the men preach. You want to have a listening ear. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you're going to say something to me that's going to nudge me forward in this process of being received. And one day I'll just take a step and I'll be in Father's house. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to see someone there. Hey, we're not talking about we're not talking about some, you know, pipe dream. We're not talking about some you euphoric thing. We're talking about reality more real than this pest house. &gt;&gt; It's father's house. &gt;&gt; You're going to see a young blackheaded man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; On the other side, it won't be very different than this one. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He'll be just as happy there as he is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say it's a perfect message &gt;&gt; back to a perfect word &gt;&gt; to get that bride. That's a duty. That's what I'm here for. Glory. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to be very far from that, would you? &gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for. He said, &gt;&gt; "That's what I'm trying to do is to call out a bride. I'm closing now. Just a moment. When was Rebecca being received? And the prophet of God, he speaks about El E Ele Elizer, Abraham's servant, go find my son a wife. In the message is shamed of him. He tells about Eleazar. He said, "Let me like I let me like Eleazar." &gt;&gt; He says that help me now. He says he had to sweat it out. Ezer had to sweat it out looking for character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then when he found character and he he he said and he talks about Elizer and he said, "And if that man is here, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; if that man is here, he talks about let him find the bride with character." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then may she stand still. &gt;&gt; Yes. long enough, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then I'll dress her. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh, God. Oh, God." &gt;&gt; How we need to get out of the rat race &gt;&gt; of this pest house. &gt;&gt; When you're done your running, it'll still be a pest house. &gt;&gt; When you're done your labors, it'll still be a pest house. Need to stop, stand still, know that I'm God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The same God. Speak Lord &gt;&gt; that I might hear you. &gt;&gt; You're too good for the best house friends. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's where they pull people with diseases. &gt;&gt; That's what this world is. &gt;&gt; It's a diseased place. Don't think that he's going to leave us here. He's going to renovate this place with fire from heaven. &gt;&gt; The earth will belch forth. &gt;&gt; It might be fine today. I just had a video sent me by a believer talking about the West Coast. You're no safer anywhere else. We'd have an atomic bomb if it was possible drop on our head and we'll be as safe as if you're a believer. You're in Christ. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I I think I I think they just had the location exact. Not quite right, but I have I have a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I've I've stretched out further today and choosing a bride." And we had sister Jake and I Garner. Sister Garner was in that meeting and she said there was about 700 people. And when he stretched out and he said he spoke about oh Los Angeles, Los Angeles calls thyself after the name of the angels. Los Angeles angels. He said you're going to sink down yonder. you're going to slide into the ocean into that great ocean and the wave come back maybe to the salt and sea and he described it. &gt;&gt; We also had Dr. SC Jacob here from the University of Badras which is Chennai now I think maybe brother Titus you know brother do Dr. Jacob. Well, once when I had arrived there to see him, he had a he had a a group of people from Russia, from Moscow, from the government of Moscow in China or Russia rather, and they were there because he was a he was a a a doctor that understood the crust of the earth. And he stood in our congregation. And you may remember that Ken when he stood here and he says he's a firm believer. He says, "Brother Brandham said that that will break off and slide into the ocean." He said, "You may not know the structure of the earth, but I do." And he talked he said the the structure of the earth under Los Angeles is all the sediment and the earth and whatever more. But he says at the rock bottom, the the rock part of it, he said it's actually on a slope but slopes towards the ocean and the the great chasm that's down there. And he said, "And between that and the and the earth is a a layer," he said, "of substance." He said, "I I he could describe it, but we wouldn't understand it." So he said the best way that you could understand it, he said it's like graphite. It's very smooth, very slippery. And when he said that it'll slide when that great earthquake takes place and it'll slide into the ocean, he said that's exactly what it's going to do. &gt;&gt; It's not if, it's when. &gt;&gt; And they're predicting massive earthquake for the cascades right now. I I don't know. I know one thing. God told us to be here. &gt;&gt; God told us to send the light from here. &gt;&gt; And when he's done with us, we'll go to our father's house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he's done with you, we'll go to father's house. How many want to go to father's house? Of course we do. &gt;&gt; Said that is to receive you. &gt;&gt; That is what he's doing this morning. That's what he's doing this morning. He's receiving you. He's taking maybe maybe he's putting a garment. Maybe you haven't had a wedding robe. Brother Brandham said if she'll stand still long enough, I'll dress her. Heavenly Father, I don't know exactly what I'm going to pray, but I'm going to pray from my heart. If you feel to be included, if there's a call, you can stand and I'll we'll pray together. Father, our Lord Jesus spoke and it's recorded. I go to prepare a place for you, &gt;&gt; father's house. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It took the world, it took the religious world by surprise when you were coming again and you began to do all the miracles you did and you took a a vessel. You took a messenger, &gt;&gt; Father, that was not educated in all the education that we might have, but he knew the author real well. &gt;&gt; He knew the author of this book we call the Bible. And he could make that Bible, you through him, could make the Bible live again. God, &gt;&gt; I said myself when a walking out of a meeting, walking out of that presence, it's like I just walked out of the pages of the Bible. You became so alive when you came out of the pages of the Bible and out of that mouth you spoke. Oh God and scriptures in his mouth seemed so deep and so wonderful and so beyond hearing it with the natural ear because there was something in the soul. The ears of the soul was hearing it. Oh God. And I don't know who it is this morning who you might be ministering to. Who it is you're calling. Which son? which daughter who it is. Lord, we know not the heart, but I'm so glad you know the heart. You know the heart of man. You know our needs. Father, I pray for those that are streaming in whatever country they might be, in whatever time zone they might be. Move, I pray, oh God. And out of that screen, may they realize that God the Father's running to them to take them from where they are. There's believers here, Lord. We've walked, maybe some have walked with you for years. But we need to realize that there's another motion. There's another move. There's another aspect of being received by the father. Father, father, I pray you'll embrace this people. I pray that you'll come to their house, come to their place, come to their address, come to their seat right now. We raise our heart &gt;&gt; to you, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; oh Lord Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus, this is the most important thing that could happen. &gt;&gt; We want to put people in contact with you. &gt;&gt; I counsel to you that are here, &gt;&gt; whether you're seated or whether you're standing or whether you're on the internet, is that you profess something. Confess something to him. &gt;&gt; Tell him something of your hunger. &gt;&gt; I'm your son. I'm your daughter. &gt;&gt; And I know that I have something more. &gt;&gt; There's something more for me just now. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Wesley if you'll come please. I'd like you to sing &gt;&gt; something we're so familiar with. It is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; When peace like a river &gt;&gt; attendeth my way. &gt;&gt; Oh God, somebody needs this peace. &gt;&gt; This past house is full of distress. In the name of Jesus Christ, I resist this distress and the pressure that people are under. We know that it's a pressure life. My precious brother, my precious sister, do not allow it to persuade you.
