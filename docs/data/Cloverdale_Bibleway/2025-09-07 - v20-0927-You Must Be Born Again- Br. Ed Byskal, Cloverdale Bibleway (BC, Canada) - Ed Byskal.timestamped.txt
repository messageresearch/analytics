[0:54] I now can sing a brand new song. Amazing
[1:00] grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a
[1:06] debt that I could never pay.
[1:11] One day he's coming,
[1:13] coming back for me to live with him
[1:18] eternally. Won't it be glory
[1:23] to see him on that day?
[1:29] I now will sing a brand new song.

[12:41] [Music]
[12:45] Let's bow our hearts and our heads
[12:47] tonight. this morning.
[12:50] Gracious heavenly father,
[12:53] wonderful Lord Jesus, what grace is this
[12:56] to come before thy holy presence this
[12:58] morning, oh God, because you are an
[13:01] awesome God, Father. Lord, you hear and
[13:04] you answer our prayers, oh God. How
[13:07] thankful we are, Father, for all the
[13:09] experiences that we have gone through,
[13:11] Lord Jesus. How faithful you've been, oh
[13:14] God. For you said, "Surely goodness and
[13:17] mercy will follow you all the days of
[13:19] our life, your life. And surely it's
[13:22] been the truth to us, Father, that
[13:24] you've been so wonderful, oh God. So we
[13:27] just come before you this morning once
[13:30] again, Father. We're all asking of you,
[13:32] oh God, to remember us once again,
[13:34] Father, as we bow our hearts to thee, oh
[13:37] God, and lift up our hearts today thee
[13:39] and bow our heads, Father, in humility,
[13:41] oh God, towards the dust from which we
[13:44] were taken, oh God. And you've you've
[13:47] lifted us up, Father, into heavenly
[13:49] places in Christ Jesus, oh God, that we
[13:52] are now the sons of God. We're not just
[13:56] servants. We're not servants. We are
[13:58] sons. And as sons, we come before thee
[14:01] saying, Aba Father, our hearts, oh God,
[14:04] go out to you, Lord Jesus. Father, in
[14:07] these times of trouble, oh God, Father,
[14:10] Lord Jesus, and your children are crying
[14:12] out, oh God, for deliverance, we have so
[14:15] much, Father, already to be thankful
[14:18] for, for what you have done and for
[14:20] those you have reserved, Father, from
[14:22] the sickness and sorrows that people are
[14:25] under at this time, Lord. And we pray
[14:28] for those, oh God, that are now
[14:30] afflicted, oh Lord, friends, families,
[14:34] loved ones, Lord Jesus. We just remember
[14:36] them all, oh God. Father, and those that
[14:39] have gone through a hard time, oh God,
[14:42] we pray for brother Tom also, Lord
[14:44] Jesus, this morning. Lord, you, oh God,
[14:47] are so faithful. You're an awesome God.
[14:50] How many times have we seen you come on
[14:53] the scene and with deliverance, Father,
[14:55] you haven't changed. You said, "I'm the
[14:58] Lord God, and I change not." If we
[15:01] believe in our heart and we receive and
[15:04] accept the finished work of Calvary,
[15:06] Lord, healing is in the atonement. Lord
[15:09] God, our brother needs healing. Our
[15:12] sisters need healing. Oh God, how
[15:15] thankful we are that we can come, Lord,
[15:18] and open our hearts before thee, oh God.
[15:21] For you are our God and we are your
[15:23] children, Father. So we ask you, oh
[15:25] heavenly father, this morning that you
[15:28] will anoint our brother Ed once again.
[15:30] Oh God, that oh God, you will open the
[15:34] word to him, Father, and bring forth
[15:36] spiritual food and due season. Oh God,
[15:40] you've prepared our hearts, Father, this
[15:42] morning to receive, Father. Pour down
[15:45] your blessings upon thy people, oh God,
[15:48] to this congregation and those who are
[15:51] out listening, oh God, that cannot be
[15:53] here, Father. We pray, we pray that you
[15:56] give them a spiritual blessing this
[15:58] morning. Be with them, oh God. Lift up
[16:01] their hearts, Father. Oh God, and may
[16:03] they also look towards you this morning,
[16:06] oh God, for a blessing that you'll send
[16:09] to us this morning, Lord. Bless now the
[16:11] people, oh God. Bless the song services,
[16:14] oh God, and the rest of the service. I

[26:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Good to hear you singing.
[26:42] And I'm sure there's many others singing
[26:44] with you. Uh they're in their homes and
[26:48] they're in their rooms and wherever
[26:51] &gt;&gt; and they've been enjoying the word. I've
[26:53] heard from several
[26:55] uh during the last few days and they
[26:58] really have enjoyed the preaching of the
[27:00] word. With this, I want to thank our
[27:03] brother Tim uh Dodd
[27:07] and brother Murphy Wong
[27:11] for all of their participation
[27:16] with brother Murphy's service. He
[27:18] preached on a Wednesday night, I believe
[27:20] it was, and then he spoke on Jesus with
[27:25] dirty feet.
[27:27] And he was uh I was quite moved. And the
[27:32] reason for that was I was in a service
[27:35] in Dawson Creek that was not taped.
[27:39] and a brother who had arranged the
[27:41] meeting. I would say that he was uh you
[27:45] know
[27:47] uh he could arrange things
[27:50] but uh somehow
[27:53] he never followed through
[27:55] but uh and he
[27:58] preached Jesus with dirty feet and
[28:00] sitting right across from me was brother
[28:03] Langro my brother-in-law
[28:05] and he was weeping like a babe
[28:10] he was his face was so read. He was
[28:12] weeping so hard and brother Brandham was
[28:14] weeping while he was preaching and it
[28:18] was really quite an outstanding service
[28:21] and brother Murphy told me that he
[28:23] preached that earlier in uh
[28:26] Jeffersonville
[28:27] and was weeping then also. And it's
[28:31] wonderful when you see that a man of God
[28:34] is so gripped by the word that he's just
[28:38] preaching,
[28:40] preaching his heart out, preaching a
[28:42] reality, preaching something that he
[28:45] knows was happening right then. And so I
[28:49] pray that today God will bless the word
[28:53] to our hearts and give us uh we're going
[28:58] to bless the food
[29:03] the food that we're going to receive.
[29:06] Amen. Let's just bow a moment.
[29:10] Heavenly Father, we're so glad we can
[29:14] call you our Father, which art in
[29:17] heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
[29:20] kingdom come, and thy will be done on
[29:24] earth as it is in heaven. We pray that
[29:27] you'll bless the food to the people.
[29:30] Father, bless the spiritual food. We've
[29:34] had, I'm sure, natural food this
[29:36] morning, but the spiritual food. We're
[29:40] asking that you will bless it and break
[29:43] it to the people and distribute it to
[29:46] the individuals as they have need. We're
[29:50] thinking of those that are in uh
[29:52] hospital, Lord, and our brother Tom, oh
[29:56] God, that you'll touch him, Father, and
[30:00] give him grace. May there be an
[30:03] abundance of your presence. We pray for
[30:06] every person that is sick, oh God, or
[30:10] afflicted
[30:12] in this life. We pray that you will
[30:14] bless them in Jesus Christ's name, the
[30:18] allsufficient one who does all things
[30:22] right. Amen. God bless you. Amen. You
[30:27] may be seated.
[30:33] I want to speak on uh a subject that I
[30:37] have not spoken
[30:39] previously
[30:42] and uh if you'll just give me your kind
[30:45] attention
[30:47] I have just before coming to the service
[30:52] I found some things in the message the
[30:57] original seed the spoken word is the
[31:01] original seed. And if you haven't read
[31:03] that message,
[31:05] I think that it would be wise for you to
[31:08] do so. And I'll tell you why. One of the
[31:12] main reasons he says things in there
[31:15] that he said they're very hard to say.
[31:21] Very hard to say. And fact is I read it
[31:24] today years after he spoke it and I said
[31:28] uh I don't think I can say that yet. But
[31:32] he he said there are children and I'm
[31:37] going to be speaking about that in a in
[31:41] a few moments. But I'm going to say you
[31:44] must be born again is the title of the
[31:46] message. You must,
[31:50] no ands, ifs, or buts. You must, capital
[31:54] mus t be born again.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; I get I think there's one thing that I
[32:03] can say uh very correctly.
[32:08] We all have experienced
[32:10] the natural birth. We've got a father
[32:14] someplace. We've got a mother someplace.
[32:17] We came here by human seed into human
[32:21] life. And we have been born.
[32:25] We have been born
[32:30] of human life.
[32:32] But Jesus said, "Except
[32:36] ye be born again,
[32:38] you cannot see
[32:41] or you cannot understand.
[32:44] You cannot see." He said that it is to
[32:47] understand
[32:49] except you be born again. And so there
[32:52] is another birth. Uh but even with the
[32:55] natural birth, there is certain things
[32:58] about it that are uh mysterious to us.
[33:03] And I I'll I'll read from John's gospel
[33:07] the third chapter
[33:10] and uh the first seven verses.
[33:16] John 3:1-7
[33:18] There was a man of the Pharisees
[33:22] named Nicodemus,
[33:25] a ruler, and I want to stress a ruler of
[33:28] the Jews.
[33:33] The same came to Jesus by night and said
[33:36] unto him, "Rabbi,
[33:39] we know," and Brother Brandham stresses
[33:43] that we, the Pharisees, we know that
[33:47] thou art a teacher come from God. For no
[33:51] man can do these miracles that thou
[33:54] doest, except God be with him."
[33:59] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[34:02] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[34:06] a man be born again, he cannot see the
[34:11] kingdom of God." Nicodemus
[34:15] uh saith unto him, "How can a man be
[34:20] born when he is old? Can he enter the
[34:24] second time into his mother's womb and
[34:27] be born? You see, he goes through the
[34:30] process.
[34:33] Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say
[34:36] unto thee, except a man be born of water
[34:41] and of the spirit, he cannot enter into
[34:45] the kingdom of God."
[34:47] That which is born of the flesh is
[34:49] flesh. That we all have experienced.
[34:53] That which is born of the flesh is
[34:55] flesh. And that which is born of the
[34:59] spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said
[35:03] unto thee,
[35:05] yeah, ye must be born again. God bless
[35:09] you. You may have your saints.
[35:16] Those of us or those who have children
[35:21] and uh because there are perhaps those
[35:24] that have not had children, but you
[35:27] wonder about what are they going to
[35:29] become?
[35:31] What are they going to be? Well, uh it's
[35:35] always a surprise.
[35:38] It's a bit of a surprise because
[35:42] some are intelligent,
[35:45] some are
[35:48] lacking in intelligence,
[35:50] some have tremendous
[35:53] uh they can remember.
[35:57] I I know that I always marvel
[36:03] he recalls history.
[36:05] History was so boring to me. I remember
[36:09] writing on the it says a history of
[36:15] Britain and I put I h a t e
[36:23] history of Britain.
[36:28] So that's what I thought about it. But
[36:30] since then I have given a lot of time to
[36:33] researching different people and and
[36:36] their royalty and their noble people and
[36:39] and I I marvel how that uh you know it
[36:44] went down
[36:45] from a noble person and into royalty and
[36:51] how those were of the royal house of
[36:54] Hapsburg they were not permitted to
[36:57] marry non-royalty
[37:00] And I read of Emperor France Joseph. I
[37:04] was very interested in that because my
[37:07] grandparents, unbeknown to me, unbeknown
[37:11] to me, I just found out this last week
[37:14] that my mother's parents
[37:17] who my mother passed away when I was
[37:19] young, but her parents and my father's
[37:24] parents, grandparents
[37:26] came from Galitzia, which was
[37:30] uh they carried Austrian passports. when
[37:34] they arrived in Canada, both of those
[37:37] families, and they handed in and they've
[37:40] got their names and the Austrian
[37:42] passport and Glitzia was a great kingdom
[37:45] at that time. Doesn't exist today. And I
[37:48] I was very keen. I was interested in
[37:51] that. I was trying to find out and I I
[37:55] found out that this uh France Joseph who
[37:59] was a very
[38:02] powerful emperor
[38:05] of a very large
[38:08] area of the world at that time. And I I
[38:13] found an very interesting word holy
[38:17] emperor. And then I found out he was
[38:20] named by the Catholic Church and that's
[38:24] how they gained
[38:27] uh gained such rank and authority and
[38:30] countries and they insisted that one
[38:34] royal person shall marry another royal
[38:37] person and that way they would claim the
[38:41] whole country. But besides that,
[38:45] if in case you don't know that, and I'm
[38:48] sure that you do, but royal one royal
[38:51] person, they would marry another royal
[38:54] person and they signed a document even
[38:58] I'd listened to a woman just recently
[39:01] that was a mother and she signed a
[39:04] document that the children would be
[39:06] raised Catholic because they wanted to
[39:10] claim the whole country as a Catholic
[39:13] country and and the leader of it was a
[39:17] Holy Roman emperor and he had his
[39:20] control of the whole area. Well,
[39:25] I it it did me good because I began to
[39:28] think of I know that I had a natural
[39:31] birth,
[39:33] &gt;&gt; but who is my father?
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Who's really my father? And it's meant
[39:39] more to me in the last
[39:42] I would say in the last year than ever
[39:46] when I can say my father
[39:49] which art in heaven
[39:53] &gt;&gt; that's where we came from
[39:56] &gt;&gt; and we have his seed. We have life by
[40:00] his seed. That's not just a nice way to
[40:04] put things but it is the truth. Yes.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; And so that's where I want to uh
[40:14] in the message God perfecting his
[40:16] church.
[40:18] He said Nicodemus expressed
[40:23] expressed it for the group of them for
[40:28] the Pharisees the whole group.
[40:32] And he says he said we we
[40:36] the Pharisees this group and he's a
[40:39] ruler he said we know
[40:43] that you are a teacher come from God
[40:48] for no man could do these things and he
[40:51] went to the he went to the
[40:56] uh confirmation of his ministry. He
[40:59] went, "We know that no man can do these
[41:03] things except God be with him."
[41:08] &gt;&gt; And we know, we know it, the Pharisees.
[41:13] And then they said, "Oh, he's a devil."
[41:18] It's amazing. The group said, "He's a
[41:21] devil."
[41:22] They tried to black it out after they
[41:26] had received and knowed that he was the
[41:30] Messiah. But to be popular and to stay
[41:34] in their own church ranks,
[41:38] notice that. And to stay in their own
[41:40] church ranks.
[41:43] They despised him and cast him out and
[41:47] called him a devil.
[41:50] Well, I'll tell you what, friends.
[41:53] I I thank God more all the time that we
[41:57] Why do we see what we see?
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Why do we believe what we believe?
[42:03] Not just because we've seen a miracle or
[42:05] two or God has done something for us or
[42:09] healed us or and I speak to all those
[42:13] that are streaming because there's many
[42:16] of our people that are streaming because
[42:19] we're just we're here by be because of
[42:22] certain restrictions and uh we have to
[42:25] come in a certain way. I said, "I've
[42:27] never seen so many stop signs
[42:31] as we have in the church and say exit
[42:35] only."
[42:38] So, you've noticed that as well. Well,
[42:41] we we we do that because the authorities
[42:45] want us to do that and they say that we
[42:47] must do that. Uh and and there are some
[42:50] some groups that uh they they've just
[42:53] said, "Well, we're not going to do it."
[42:55] and and uh they've been shut down and we
[42:58] don't want that to happen. We want to
[43:00] keep up with the gospel of Jesus Christ
[43:04] and send it out.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; But I say we know that this servant was
[43:10] of God.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; We know that it's a teacher come from
[43:14] God.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; And so I want to speak a little bit
[43:20] about this subject.
[43:24] uh someone who's a father in the Greek
[43:28] word or the Hebrew word as it as used is
[43:33] one that is brings forth
[43:37] our father has brought forth
[43:41] and that's why you're here. I I believe
[43:44] that with all my heart because you're
[43:47] here even under constraints but our
[43:50] father has brought forth
[43:53] children of his own kind and in the
[43:56] creation I was thinking of the creation
[44:00] and uh in this uh in the message the
[44:03] original seed the spoken word is the
[44:05] original seed he goes back to Genesis in
[44:09] the very beginning and God said let
[44:12] there every light. And God said, "Let
[44:15] the earth bring forth." And it did. And
[44:19] God said, and whether he I've I've
[44:23] wondered what what language did he
[44:25] speak. Well, we don't know. Was it
[44:28] German? Was it English? Was it Hebrew?
[44:32] Was it Aramaic? We don't know. And we
[44:35] don't know if he spoke a language. We
[44:38] really do not know. But we know one
[44:40] thing that the Bible is the word of God.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; It's called the word of God and we
[44:48] believe it is the word of God and and
[44:50] that's the spoken word by which we are
[44:54] to be born.
[44:59] I recall and a person can only speak
[45:02] from experience but I recall sleeping.
[45:07] Do I recall sleeping? I guess so. I was
[45:11] sleeping and I recall being picked with
[45:15] a finger on my cheek. And I've told you
[45:19] that here before
[45:21] and I would open my eyes and say, "Yes,
[45:25] Marilyn,
[45:27] what do you what is what do you what do
[45:29] you want?"
[45:31] and she could hardly speak, but she
[45:33] said, she's standing there in her night
[45:36] gown and she says, "I need a pencil and
[45:41] a piece of paper." And she couldn't
[45:44] pronounce her Rs.
[45:46] But she says, "I need a pencil." Notice
[45:49] what she said. I need a pencil and a
[45:52] paper.
[45:54] Because there was something in her. And
[45:57] I wasn't I was the father, but I wasn't
[45:59] aware of it. I didn't know she needed a
[46:02] pencil. She didn't say I needed I need a
[46:05] paintbrush,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; but she said I need a pencil. And then
[46:09] that developed over the years and over
[46:13] the years. Last week we just had the
[46:18] gallery from the photographer from the
[46:21] gallery of Vancouver and she was taking
[46:24] some pictures of some paintings and uh
[46:28] Marilyn did one of that you haven't seen
[46:32] yet and I was going to have it for you
[46:34] this morning but
[46:37] it didn't work out but Sister Effie Tate
[46:42] and she was a weaver of baskets
[46:45] and she sitting on some rocks
[46:49] and she's at knitnat and you know where
[46:52] that is brother Richard
[46:55] knitnat she was she is a knitnat
[46:59] and she and she was sitting in the
[47:01] service in 1962
[47:04] in Port Bernie
[47:06] she had a son whose son had about four
[47:11] seizures a day
[47:13] They said he cannot live
[47:16] and he was in his teens at that time.
[47:21] And uh my wife and I were at Uklit
[47:25] a short time ago and we were talking to
[47:28] a former pastor's wife,
[47:32] Sister Barb Tucci. And so we said to
[47:35] Sister Barb, "Is is Sister Tate still
[47:39] living?
[47:41] And is her son still living? Oh yes, she
[47:45] said. He's in the Rainbow Lodge as you
[47:49] go into Port Al Bernie. So we went and
[47:52] saw him. The next day we saw
[47:57] uh
[47:59] that the son the Tate, what was his
[48:02] name?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; I just forget his name now.
[48:09] And he said he said, "Well, I'm here.
[48:12] I'm just I just came I I just dropped in
[48:16] here actually for a day or two, but
[48:20] Brother Brandham spoke to him at the end
[48:24] of a service and called him out and
[48:27] said, "You'll be free from this
[48:32] uh
[48:35] alp
[48:40] epilepsy.
[48:42] No,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; epilepsy.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Epilepsy. That's right.
[48:48] And I I said, "Do you remember that day
[48:52] when you were called out?" "Oh, yes." He
[48:55] says, "I remember it." And he says, and
[48:59] he went right on. He carried on. He
[49:01] said, "I haven't had a I haven't had one
[49:04] uh seizure since."
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; And so now I tell you that that is
[49:11] supernatural.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; And I was sitting on the platform and I
[49:15] knew Sister Tate, but I didn't know her
[49:18] son. And and here's a prophet of God
[49:22] calls her out. How did he know that he
[49:25] was having epilepsy?
[49:27] &gt;&gt; How did he know that? that was his
[49:30] father, our father, almighty God, that
[49:34] was illuminating him and spoke to her
[49:39] and drove that enemy far from him.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; He just passed away just a short time
[49:46] ago, but he never passed away from
[49:49] epilepsy.
[49:50] He was uh he was healthy and he was
[49:53] strong and he was in the chair and I
[49:55] took a nice picture of my wife with him
[49:59] at that time.
[50:01] And the Bible tells us
[50:05] uh shortly after Jesus said these words,
[50:07] "You must be born again."
[50:11] I want you to think about that. You must
[50:15] be born again. And he that was speaking
[50:20] it was the son. And in the beginning
[50:25] there were
[50:27] two sons. There were Cain and Abel.
[50:35] And each brought forth what was in them.
[50:38] And and the Bible says that
[50:42] Cain was a tiller of the ground.
[50:47] And a tiller is one that works it and is
[50:50] employed and he earns.
[50:54] And uh I tell you what, they have tilled
[50:58] this ground here.
[51:00] They have tilled it. and people that are
[51:04] uh smart people, scholarly people, wise
[51:09] people, they have tilled this ground and
[51:14] and held people bound as servants. And
[51:18] the Bible says that and it it was it was
[51:24] not they that uh
[51:29] maybe they paid a a minister and the
[51:32] minister spoke to them. But on the other
[51:36] hand, I want you to listen to this very
[51:38] carefully. Now he's employed.
[51:42] He's retained. Maybe he has a gift. he
[51:46] could speak. And so
[51:49] that's what caused him to be a tiller of
[51:53] the ground. He tilled the ground because
[51:56] he was paid to do it. And now here comes
[51:59] a prophet and says, "Well, uh, it's a
[52:02] it's a it's a bread basket for him. He
[52:07] knows that this is the truth." That's
[52:10] why
[52:12] that's why Nicodemus said, "We know
[52:17] &gt;&gt; that you're a man of God. We know you're
[52:21] a prophet of God." Or, "We know
[52:25] that you're a teacher come from God
[52:28] because no man could do these things
[52:31] unless God be with him."
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And God was with him. And that's why he
[52:38] could call out Sister Effie Tate, total
[52:41] stranger, and tell her son was had
[52:46] epilepsy
[52:47] and what he did. And here he is. And he
[52:52] even God knew, our father knew that my
[52:56] wife would stand beside him at 72 years
[53:00] old. And he never had another.
[53:05] I'm giving you part testimony, but but
[53:09] it's all true.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely true.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And we were anxious to visit him and we
[53:20] did. We went and we perhaps visited him
[53:24] so I could tell you about it. And there
[53:26] are a uh
[53:30] just a limited number of people in the
[53:32] world that know exactly what I'm telling
[53:35] now.
[53:36] And God bless you that you're able to be
[53:39] here. And you that are streaming, God
[53:41] bless you.
[53:43] Uh I hope that you will carry this and
[53:46] say, "A man that I know spoke these
[53:50] things. A man that I know was in that
[53:53] meeting. a man that I know was on the
[53:56] platform.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible says
[54:09] that Jesus went into a garden
[54:13] that he
[54:15] resorted often feather.
[54:19] I want you to think about that.
[54:23] Where does one who created who made the
[54:26] garden?
[54:28] What do you set a garden for? That's
[54:31] where you put seeds.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And his son
[54:40] who is from his seed.
[54:44] And and
[54:47] I I hope you'll have grace to receive
[54:50] what I'm saying just now.
[54:52] But a virgin
[54:56] was sown seed said the Holy Spirit will
[55:01] overshadow you and you'll bring forth a
[55:04] son. This was the son
[55:08] &gt;&gt; and he he was born of a seed. In the
[55:12] beginning, the Bible says when God
[55:15] created everything,
[55:17] he said, "Let the earth bring forth."
[55:20] And it did. And then he said, "Let the
[55:23] trees bring forth."
[55:26] And he said, and the scripture says,
[55:28] "Who seed is in itself,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; of his kind,
[55:36] &gt;&gt; and God himself
[55:40] also brought forth of his kind, but he
[55:45] did not
[55:46] show it right then." But
[55:50] uh it was the prophet says Christ was in
[55:55] Abraham.
[55:56] Christ was in Isaac.
[56:00] Moses he said Moses one time God said to
[56:05] him, "Step aside and I will destroy
[56:08] these rebellious people." And Moses
[56:12] threw threw himself down in the path of
[56:15] God's wrath and said, "If you destroy
[56:19] them, destroy me. Take me and let them
[56:22] go."
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And he says that was Christ in Moses
[56:27] that caused that that called that. And
[56:30] friends, that's why we can be here
[56:32] today. That's why we can stream. That's
[56:35] why we can see what we see. It was
[56:38] Christ
[56:39] in a man, Christ in a ministry,
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Christ in the prophet of God, and it's
[56:49] Christ in you as an individual. That's
[56:53] why he came is because he would have
[56:56] more children and they would identify
[56:59] themselves by believing what he said.
[57:03] And some hear it and say they read the
[57:06] same scripture but they do not believe
[57:09] every word that he says.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And into this garden.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; I I called it just before I came here to
[57:23] the pulpit. I called it the sun seed.
[57:28] the seed of the son of God whose seed
[57:32] was in himself
[57:34] and he brought forth
[57:37] Jesus Christ.
[57:39] Who's your father?
[57:43] Who who has brought you forth? Who has
[57:46] illuminated you? Who has called you to
[57:49] do things that you never dreamed that
[57:52] you would do? You never dreamed that you
[57:55] would be that. And you wouldn't be that
[57:58] if God,
[58:00] Brother Joseph, you prayed this morning
[58:03] and you spoke. And I thank God for the
[58:07] prayer. God bless you.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; You couldn't pray that if God hadn't
[58:14] sovereignly touched, touched you and
[58:18] illuminated you in the darkness of the
[58:21] colony life. in that darkness, in that
[58:25] bondage. That's why I asked our brother
[58:29] to sing, "Thank God, I'm free. Jesus
[58:34] Christ set me free." And I'll never ever
[58:37] forget, Sister Eileene, when you walked
[58:40] into the doors of the log church down in
[58:44] Cloverdale and tears were streaming down
[58:47] your face and you said, "These are not
[58:51] these are not tears of sorrow. They're
[58:53] tears of joy. I am free. I'm free." I
[58:58] thank God. Hallelujah.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And he's still the same.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; He's still the same. Darkness flees.
[59:05] Darkness goes back to where it came
[59:08] from.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it and the prophet says it has
[59:14] to congregate together.
[59:17] When the light comes,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; the darkness has to go and congregate
[59:21] together. And they think maybe because
[59:24] if they get together, they'll be
[59:26] stronger. No. No. It's just what I call
[59:30] is a spiritual goulash.
[59:38] Because
[59:40] it was the seed that could say
[59:44] where he would say not my will but thine
[59:49] be done. The seed said that.
[59:53] And secondly, he said, "If it is
[59:55] possible, if it be possible, let this
[59:59] cup
[1:00:00] pass from me.
[1:00:03] Nevertheless,"
[1:00:05] now the seed is speaking. Nevertheless,
[1:00:08] not as I will, but as thou wilt. And he
[1:00:14] went to the cross. Friends,
[1:00:19] sometimes things are not easy. Real
[1:00:22] easy.
[1:00:24] Brother Brandham says in 1965, he said,
[1:00:29] "I've been here in Tucson for three
[1:00:32] years
[1:00:34] and I haven't had one invitation."
[1:00:41] But the scripture says,
[1:00:44] "And he was outside
[1:00:46] of the door. He'd been put out."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Just think of that. The door had been
[1:00:53] shut
[1:00:55] and he'd been put out of the and Jesus
[1:00:58] himself was standing on the outside
[1:01:02] knocking entrance into what they called
[1:01:05] his church.
[1:01:07] might be a church, but it's not his
[1:01:10] church.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; His church is his people.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; His church are people that have been
[1:01:16] called out,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; and they're called out of darkness.
[1:01:20] They're called out of bondage. They're
[1:01:22] called into eternal life.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] And he went a little further and fell on
[1:01:31] his face and prayed saying, "Oh my
[1:01:34] father, if it be possible, if it be
[1:01:39] possible,
[1:01:41] this is the one that would say nothing
[1:01:43] is possible, impossible."
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And yet he says in the garden, "If it's
[1:01:50] possible, let this cup pass from me."
[1:01:55] He didn't want to die. He was a man.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But he did die. He was God.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] And God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[1:02:07] grass and herb yielding seed, and the
[1:02:11] fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[1:02:14] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[1:02:20] earth." And it was so. And now and God
[1:02:24] had created a garden. Don't forget it.
[1:02:27] In the very initial creation, he created
[1:02:31] a garden. And in the garden, the one who
[1:02:35] has a garden put seeds there.
[1:02:40] You want certain things.
[1:02:42] And this human life were acquainted with
[1:02:45] that.
[1:02:47] And spiritually
[1:02:50] God had a garden
[1:02:52] and Jesus resorted there thither with
[1:02:55] his disciples
[1:02:57] and he went there
[1:03:00] and God's seed said
[1:03:03] not my will
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; but thine be done
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; and if it's possible
[1:03:11] father if it's possible let this cup
[1:03:15] pass from me but not my will but thine
[1:03:18] be done and friends
[1:03:22] I think maybe that's where we are coming
[1:03:24] to
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; if it's possible and if it's not
[1:03:29] possible
[1:03:31] uh the seed within us says thy will be
[1:03:34] done
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; whatever it is
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; and the earth brought forth grass and
[1:03:40] herb
[1:03:42] yielding seed after his kind
[1:03:46] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[1:03:50] was in itself
[1:03:53] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[1:03:57] good. And God saw his son Jesus Christ.
[1:04:03] It was God in Christ
[1:04:06] and God in Christ
[1:04:09] in the sunship. He cried, "Not my will
[1:04:15] but thine be done." And friends, I'm so
[1:04:18] glad that he died for us.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; So, and the purpose of that is so we
[1:04:27] could bring forth
[1:04:29] after his kind.
[1:04:34] Jesus
[1:04:35] was his kind.
[1:04:40] All that had seed in itself brought
[1:04:43] forth of its own kind. However,
[1:04:47] God did not have one of his own kind.
[1:04:52] But the prophet of God said in a message
[1:04:55] masterpiece
[1:04:56] that he
[1:04:59] he chipped
[1:05:01] away
[1:05:03] at our lives
[1:05:06] at this
[1:05:08] uh shapeless stone as it was and he
[1:05:12] brought forth a church. In fact is he
[1:05:16] says she is a bride without spot and
[1:05:21] without wrinkle. That's what he's going
[1:05:24] to bring forth and that's what he is
[1:05:27] bringing forth.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And so don't don't complain over the
[1:05:33] chips. Don't complain over the of the
[1:05:38] shaping
[1:05:39] of it of it because it's the father
[1:05:42] that's doing it.
[1:05:48] Brother Brandham said something also
[1:05:50] that's very interesting.
[1:05:52] He said uh and is these are not his
[1:05:56] words. As humans we dream we dream
[1:06:00] dreams.
[1:06:02] He said and he asked several times when
[1:06:06] he's trying to explain the the ministry.
[1:06:08] He said how many dream dreams?
[1:06:11] Quite a few. He said, "How many don't
[1:06:14] dream dreams?"
[1:06:16] Well, I've known people
[1:06:18] who on both sides of the fence said,
[1:06:21] "Dream dreams and don't dream dreams."
[1:06:24] And he said with a prophet, he said,
[1:06:28] "The two conscious, the come right
[1:06:32] together,
[1:06:34] the subconscious
[1:06:36] and the conscious come right together."
[1:06:39] and he doesn't go to sleep to dream his
[1:06:42] dream. And when brother Brandham
[1:06:48] in that one and in that 16 mm
[1:06:52] which was uh
[1:06:55] we we turned it into a video.
[1:06:58] But uh when he and he says to the lady,
[1:07:01] he says and he looks to the other
[1:07:03] brethren on the platform. He said, "Is
[1:07:06] this a patient?"
[1:07:08] because he doesn't sometimes he was not
[1:07:13] aware of is he said in one place you
[1:07:17] don't know what it is to go back maybe
[1:07:21] 20 years or 30 years in a person's life
[1:07:25] and see them when they're a child see
[1:07:28] them when they're young and and and like
[1:07:33] he said to this one woman I'm I'm just
[1:07:36] saying things that have spoken to me and
[1:07:39] he says
[1:07:41] and he leans forward. He says, "Can can
[1:07:44] I tell it?" And it wasn't anything very
[1:07:47] private that I thought, but he said,
[1:07:51] "You've had several operations. I think
[1:07:54] about five operations."
[1:07:57] He says, "And the doctors can't find
[1:07:59] it." But he said,
[1:08:03] "When you were a young girl, you fell
[1:08:05] down a well."
[1:08:07] Do you remember that?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; You fell down a well
[1:08:12] and it loosened your organs and they
[1:08:15] have never been able to find it. Isn't
[1:08:18] that I'll tell you what, what would what
[1:08:21] would you do? I wouldn't be here if she
[1:08:24] said, "No, that didn't happen. I never
[1:08:27] fell down a well. She did fall down a
[1:08:30] well and she did experience those
[1:08:33] operations. She had several of the
[1:08:36] operations and the doctors could not
[1:08:39] find it because it was not possible. And
[1:08:45] furthermore, and someone just said it
[1:08:48] the other day, said, "The devil can hide
[1:08:51] from the doctors, but he can't hide from
[1:08:54] God.
[1:08:56] Aren't you glad about that?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And even today, today I'm able to say to
[1:09:02] you, we have a God that can look and
[1:09:06] find things that even the doctors can't
[1:09:09] find.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely the truth.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And you just believe that
[1:09:17] and receive it and you'll find that it's
[1:09:20] absolutely true.
[1:09:23] So as humans we dream and as humans some
[1:09:27] don't dream and then God allows some to
[1:09:32] be raised as evangelists or apostles or
[1:09:37] prophets and teachers and so on. He
[1:09:41] raises them and they are that they have
[1:09:45] a certain ability
[1:09:47] as as
[1:09:49] even in their youth but they didn't
[1:09:51] realize it till the spirit of God came
[1:09:55] upon them and she again bare his brother
[1:09:58] Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep
[1:10:03] but Cain was a tiller of the ground
[1:10:07] and uh uh uh keeper of the sheep is one
[1:10:12] that goes to pasture,
[1:10:15] tends the sheep,
[1:10:18] allows them to graze and feed,
[1:10:21] and he may be a ruler or a teacher of
[1:10:25] people as a flock. Abel was a keeper of
[1:10:29] sheep
[1:10:31] to pasture, to tend, to graze, and to
[1:10:35] feed. That was the purpose. And Cain,
[1:10:39] I'm reading the scripture the uh Genesis
[1:10:43] 4:8 right now. And Cain talked with Abel
[1:10:47] his brother. And it came to pass and the
[1:10:51] prophet of God said they both
[1:10:56] offered sacrifices
[1:10:59] that Cain was a religious man.
[1:11:03] And how religious? Oh my goodness. And
[1:11:07] when they were in the field
[1:11:10] that Cain rose up against Abel his
[1:11:13] brother and slew him, and I wrote in
[1:11:17] brackets, where did that come from?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Where did that come from?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; God's not a slayer of people.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Where did that come from?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Whose seed did that come from?
[1:11:44] And the prophet of God said,
[1:11:46] "You don't join it at all.
[1:11:50] You're born into the church." I've been
[1:11:54] with the Brandham family this coming
[1:11:57] April the 6th. I've been in the Brham
[1:12:01] family 44 years at that time.
[1:12:04] And they never did ask me to join the
[1:12:07] family.
[1:12:08] Why? I was born a Brham. I am a Branom
[1:12:14] at by birth.
[1:12:17] So what are we? I want to look down this
[1:12:20] morning and I feel
[1:12:22] the authorship of almighty God to say
[1:12:26] you can call God your father. Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; God is your father.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; You came from him.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; His seed was broken.
[1:12:40] His seed went into Gethsemane
[1:12:44] and said, "Not my will, but thine be
[1:12:46] done." And that's why that body went to
[1:12:49] the cross
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; and it was broken and burst open. And
[1:12:55] the life
[1:12:57] uh came from him.
[1:13:00] And uh the life
[1:13:04] uh it was an unusual thing.
[1:13:09] But you may be you may be here, you may
[1:13:12] be streaming, you may be listening,
[1:13:15] you may be saying,
[1:13:18] "There's something more for me." And it
[1:13:22] might just be another step.
[1:13:26] It might just be another step that
[1:13:29] you're taking or you're going to take.
[1:13:32] And God knows you're going to take it.
[1:13:34] And God is going to guide take you by
[1:13:38] the hand. And God is going to guide you.
[1:13:42] That is what he promised he would do. He
[1:13:45] said he will never leave thee nor
[1:13:50] forsake thee. Never. Never.
[1:13:53] Regardless of the circumstance,
[1:13:55] regardless of the situation, you might
[1:13:58] say, "Oh my goodness, I'm here. I am.
[1:14:02] I'm a single person. I'm not married."
[1:14:04] Or or here, I have a family or I have
[1:14:08] children that are teenagers now or
[1:14:11] whatever. Whatever your situation, God
[1:14:14] knows exactly
[1:14:16] where you are and exactly what this life
[1:14:20] calls for.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going to say to you with
[1:14:25] authority, don't pay any attention to
[1:14:28] what the devil tries to bring your way
[1:14:30] or the temptations of life. Don't pay
[1:14:34] any attention to that because our
[1:14:36] father,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; our father,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; he's telling us not to be concerned, not
[1:14:44] to be overly concerned. He said, the
[1:14:46] prophet of God said, you don't join it
[1:14:49] at all. You're born into the church.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Can I say that to you? You're born into
[1:14:57] the church.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You're birthed into it.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. by a life.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; By a life that he's not concerned and
[1:15:06] he's not affected by what what affects
[1:15:11] this life.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; It can be a virus. It can be whatever.
[1:15:17] It can be financial. It can be whatever
[1:15:20] it might be. But God is greater.
[1:15:26] our father. I don't want to just say
[1:15:29] God, but our father.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He's greater.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You don't join at all. He said, "I've
[1:15:38] been with the Brandham family this
[1:15:40] coming." That's where I read the April
[1:15:43] April the 6th, 44 years. He's never been
[1:15:47] asked to join the family. So, I don't
[1:15:50] ask you to join God's family.
[1:15:54] God's the one that's say there's there's
[1:15:57] my son, there's my daughter. Maybe they
[1:16:00] don't even know it yet, but I'll I'll
[1:16:02] just hover over them and and they'll
[1:16:05] they'll become exactly what I want them
[1:16:07] to be.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] And that's the way it is. You don't have
[1:16:16] to join the church. You just belong to
[1:16:19] it. That's all.
[1:16:23] You're just born into it. And when
[1:16:26] you're born of the spirit of God, you
[1:16:29] become a son of God
[1:16:32] and a daughter of God.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And without that, you just belong to the
[1:16:38] church then. But when you're born again,
[1:16:43] you belong to Christ.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And you must be born again. Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's my message.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; You must be born again.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's one fundamental doctrine
[1:16:58] that I believe
[1:17:01] that's uh St. John the 3 chapter.
[1:17:06] Jesus said to Nicodemus,
[1:17:08] "Except a man be born of water and of
[1:17:11] spirit, he will in no wise enter the
[1:17:14] kingdom."
[1:17:16] Brother Benham talks about a man
[1:17:21] and uh this man had
[1:17:24] jangles of chains hanging on him and
[1:17:28] crosses
[1:17:29] and he had all of these things to
[1:17:33] identify him as.
[1:17:36] Brother Brham says his titles it'll take
[1:17:39] probably two three pages to write the
[1:17:42] titles down. Do you know what I do? I
[1:17:46] try to
[1:17:49] compare myself,
[1:17:52] compare the life that is in me
[1:17:55] with the life. And I I must say that
[1:17:59] sometimes I've been too critical. Just
[1:18:02] said, "Well,
[1:18:04] that's the way they want to go. That's
[1:18:05] the way they want to go." Whatever.
[1:18:08] But often
[1:18:12] often I don't see that kind of reaction.
[1:18:17] Uh, brother Tim,
[1:18:20] your reaction when you went to Uganda
[1:18:22] affected me.
[1:18:25] I saw all those people
[1:18:28] being baptized or being rebaptized
[1:18:32] and I looked at that
[1:18:35] and I'm glad you went. I'm glad that you
[1:18:39] were able to go and see it. But one
[1:18:42] thing you said when you come back
[1:18:45] the dynamics of it had or something had
[1:18:48] changed had changed you spiritually.
[1:18:52] Uh
[1:18:54] to accept
[1:18:56] not not to accept everything that a
[1:18:59] person confesses or not to accept
[1:19:02] everything that a person says
[1:19:06] but to accept the birth. When you can
[1:19:10] tell a person's been born again,
[1:19:14] their appetite changes
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; and you begin to realize
[1:19:20] their their needs are not just I want I
[1:19:23] want I want
[1:19:25] uh but their needs are genuine needs and
[1:19:29] uh you find people at home begin to
[1:19:32] respond to that.
[1:19:38] I want to just say
[1:19:41] as a backup to what I've been preaching
[1:19:44] to you
[1:19:46] when God said
[1:19:49] the prophet said
[1:19:51] the spoken word think about this the
[1:19:55] spoken word is the original seed.
[1:20:02] Now,
[1:20:04] the reason why he's saying it is because
[1:20:07] he spoke a message here that's about 4
[1:20:10] hours long.
[1:20:15] Took about four hours to tell every side
[1:20:20] of the spoken word is the original seed.
[1:20:25] Do you know why? I I'll tell you from
[1:20:28] from my perspective
[1:20:31] is because he knew that he was coming
[1:20:34] with the spoken word
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; to the people
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and that spoken word is going to give
[1:20:42] birth
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; to the people
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and I'm so glad I can tell you as my
[1:20:50] friends I can tell you that when he
[1:20:53] spoke to me on a mountain side.
[1:20:58] I just I I I thought of it many times
[1:21:02] afterwards.
[1:21:04] I thought, well, of course,
[1:21:07] it absolutely fits the scripture. It's
[1:21:10] perfectly in line with the scripture.
[1:21:13] This wasn't even a struggle for me. I
[1:21:15] just thought I didn't even have I didn't
[1:21:18] have any resistance at all.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; I just said, "Well, of course."
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Malachi 4. Of course,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; whether they call it Elijah or what they
[1:21:30] want to call it. I do. That didn't make
[1:21:33] any difference to me. Some people are
[1:21:35] caught up with that.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; But I wasn't caught up with anything
[1:21:40] special. Of course,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; it's prophet ministry.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Of course, it is.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And the spoken word is coming. Well, I I
[1:21:52] I thought I had some uh suggestion as to
[1:21:58] what the word of God says, and there's
[1:22:01] nothing wrong with that. But when you
[1:22:03] hear
[1:22:06] I just read some this, the reason why I
[1:22:09] say this is because I just read
[1:22:12] something this morning and and I I I
[1:22:16] have a marker.
[1:22:19] It's a blue marker here. And I wondered
[1:22:22] what it was
[1:22:26] that I in the past had looked at that.
[1:22:30] And um
[1:22:37] and the paragraph says,
[1:22:40] "Who is illegitimate?"
[1:22:45] Who is illegitimate born then?
[1:22:49] They were illegitimate children
[1:22:52] professing to be gods.
[1:22:56] Jesus said, "You are of your father,
[1:23:00] the devil."
[1:23:04] Isn't that amazing?
[1:23:07] You're of your father. He's not he's not
[1:23:09] here saying it to this group of people,
[1:23:13] but he's saying to the people that were
[1:23:16] following him, to the people who wanted
[1:23:18] bread, to the people who wanted
[1:23:20] blessings, to the people who wanted all
[1:23:23] kinds of things. It's just, you know,
[1:23:25] it's just a a gathering. It's a church.
[1:23:29] It's a service. And there are people
[1:23:32] they gather around the message and they
[1:23:34] say well um you know what is it to you?
[1:23:39] Well it's uh it's just a place where I
[1:23:43] it it's a place where I go and and uh I
[1:23:47] feel comforted because I've been to
[1:23:51] church.
[1:23:52] That's not why it's here.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; That's not what it's about.
[1:23:58] Jesus didn't pray,
[1:24:01] "Not my will,
[1:24:04] but thine be done." He didn't fall on
[1:24:08] his face
[1:24:10] just so people could have the comfort of
[1:24:12] having a church.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I've had people say to me, "Well, I just
[1:24:17] want to go to church. I I you know, they
[1:24:20] feel kind of relieved that they've been
[1:24:22] to church." That's not what it's about.
[1:24:25] Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; There how many people gather in colonies
[1:24:30] or in
[1:24:34] I I just listened to a program here
[1:24:36] recently and they they go to church
[1:24:39] about three times a day a day. They just
[1:24:43] go to church
[1:24:46] and they feel that that's
[1:24:49] well I've done my duty.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's not what it's about.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; He He didn't fall on his face
[1:24:59] to make it possible for us to go to
[1:25:02] church
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; or say I'm a believer or there in the
[1:25:08] message.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That's not what it's about.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't fall on his face
[1:25:16] say oh father
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; not my will but thine be done. He fell
[1:25:23] on his face because of that seed life
[1:25:27] that was in him.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; That was going to go out. It was going
[1:25:31] to reach out to others, other sons and
[1:25:34] other daughters of God.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; You can't stop it.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; A light goes on.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And I thank God there's somebody there
[1:25:44] that can turn on the light. Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Somebody can come right to the verse to
[1:25:51] the scripture
[1:25:53] and uh and that light
[1:25:56] he doesn't say now I'm going to turn on
[1:25:58] light
[1:26:00] but he speaks something
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; and a light explodes within you.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask it to explode.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; It just did. You didn't even ask to
[1:26:12] hunger for it, but you do hunger for it.
[1:26:15] You hunger for it and it does something.
[1:26:19] It does something beyond description.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you as a father,
[1:26:28] I have my youngest daughter here, but my
[1:26:30] others, one called this morning early
[1:26:34] and said, "I I put I put my name up, but
[1:26:39] they're filled up and so I can't get to
[1:26:42] come."
[1:26:44] It's nice to have
[1:26:48] seed
[1:26:50] children
[1:26:52] of God.
[1:26:54] So I can say to father, "Father,
[1:26:57] of course, I didn't know
[1:27:00] uh what they were to become. I didn't
[1:27:03] know. I didn't give them the hunger. I
[1:27:07] didn't give them the desire
[1:27:10] for you. I didn't do that.
[1:27:14] You had to initiate that. You had to
[1:27:17] bring that upon them. You had to call
[1:27:21] them. You had to draw them.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And only your presence can satisfy them.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And friends, you may have relatives, you
[1:27:35] may have friends, you may have family
[1:27:38] that are actually in that state. And I
[1:27:41] say to you, trust him,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; your father,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; and commit your family to him,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; because he's the only one that can give
[1:27:54] them the birth
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; and give them the life that comes from
[1:27:58] it.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] And so I I marveled at the scripture.
[1:28:14] I marvel at it because
[1:28:17] there were
[1:28:22] obviously
[1:28:24] God spoke and it came forth
[1:28:28] and it brought forth of its own kind.
[1:28:33] I think that's
[1:28:36] really outstanding.
[1:28:40] And the songwriter that says to be like
[1:28:44] Jesus,
[1:28:46] to be like Jesus, all I ask is to be
[1:28:50] like him.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; God gave me a song some years ago.
[1:28:57] I may have
[1:29:01] uh I think I know my daughter sing it,
[1:29:08] but it goes like this.
[1:29:12] Jesus went
[1:29:15] to a garden,
[1:29:17] but he went not alone,
[1:29:21] for he took with him another three.
[1:29:26] And when the weight
[1:29:29] of my sin
[1:29:31] be to press
[1:29:34] him there,
[1:29:36] then he said,
[1:29:39] "Watch and pray with me.
[1:29:42] Oh, watch and pray
[1:29:45] with me."
[1:29:49] And I was very touched
[1:29:52] and moved when I
[1:29:55] heard some of the messages just
[1:29:57] recently.
[1:30:02] And friends, I feel that God is saying
[1:30:06] to us,
[1:30:09] we've arrived at a time.
[1:30:13] Watch and pray. here. We've got many
[1:30:16] empty seats and we got people out there
[1:30:19] on the that are streaming that are
[1:30:22] begging to come and deacons, faithful
[1:30:26] deacons
[1:30:28] running to the doors. I've seen them go
[1:30:31] outside to talk to some people who came
[1:30:33] up. Why did they come up? Because they
[1:30:36] don't want to come to church.
[1:30:39] It's not just church merely. We want to
[1:30:42] come in and say, "What is he? What's
[1:30:44] father going to say to us?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Is he maybe he's just going to say, "I
[1:30:51] understand.
[1:30:53] I know where you're at.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:30:58] I understand.
[1:31:00] Completely understand.
[1:31:07] I'm touched.
[1:31:09] I have a son-in-law, Joanne's h Joanne's
[1:31:13] husband.
[1:31:15] He's in serious operation
[1:31:19] starting tomorrow. He's been getting
[1:31:21] ready
[1:31:24] and he was 4 and 1/2 hours in operation
[1:31:27] yesterday.
[1:31:31] You You don't want that kind of pain.
[1:31:34] You don't want that kind of and he's in
[1:31:37] a serious operation that's never been
[1:31:40] conducted in Canada tomorrow.
[1:31:47] And so we pray for him.
[1:31:51] And this is an hour
[1:31:53] where God is saying,
[1:31:56] "Watch and pray with me."
[1:31:59] Because nothing that we endure or go
[1:32:03] through
[1:32:04] will touch. When Jesus, my Lord, fell on
[1:32:09] his face,
[1:32:12] said, "Father,
[1:32:14] nevertheless, not my will. If it's
[1:32:17] possible, let this cup pass from me."
[1:32:21] I can tell you, Joanne, if it's
[1:32:24] possible, he'd let this cup pass from
[1:32:27] Brother Tom and yourself.
[1:32:31] He would do that if he could
[1:32:34] to Ella. He would let that cup pass from
[1:32:37] you. But there's a reason.
[1:32:41] He's our father
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and he brought you here for a special
[1:32:48] specific reason. He allows us to endure
[1:32:52] the things that we endure
[1:32:56] to show that we are sons and daughters
[1:32:59] of the living God.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; We're not just churchgoers.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; We're not just people who do our duty
[1:33:08] and then we go on our way. No, we're not
[1:33:12] that. It's more than that.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; It's much more than that.
[1:33:19] And so he's saying to us,
[1:33:23] will you watch with me
[1:33:27] now today at this time?
[1:33:30] Will you wait with me?
[1:33:35] I've been patient. I've been waiting on
[1:33:39] various ones.
[1:33:42] Will you watch with me?
[1:33:45] Will you pray with me?
[1:33:48] He's He's the one who said, "I'll never
[1:33:51] leave you nor forsake you."
[1:33:56] Do you believe that?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:34:00] Can I commit you to God?
[1:34:03] Heavenly Father,
[1:34:07] you are our father
[1:34:10] and we feel so indebted to you.
[1:34:14] We feel so touched by you.
[1:34:17] We feel the arms of your strength
[1:34:21] embracing us,
[1:34:24] holding us,
[1:34:26] sustaining us. Oh God, we pray that you
[1:34:30] will bless not only those that are here
[1:34:34] and those that are gathered at the camp
[1:34:37] and those that will be streaming in the
[1:34:41] future. I pray that you'll come to them.
[1:34:45] come to the room they are in. Come to
[1:34:48] their very bedside.
[1:34:50] I pray, oh God, you'll span the miles
[1:34:55] and bless your children. Dear children,
[1:34:59] your children, our brothers and sisters
[1:35:02] in Christ, around the globe. In China,
[1:35:06] remember them. In Africa, remember them
[1:35:11] in Switzerland and in Europe. Remember
[1:35:14] them. I pray that you'll be near them.
[1:35:17] Sustain them in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:35:21] Amen. Amen. I wonder, brother Nathan,
[1:35:24] would you have a song?
[1:35:29] I appreciate our brother Benjamin.
[1:35:33] I saw you walk to the piano
[1:35:37] on the screen
[1:35:40] and I just thank God for your
[1:35:42] faithfulness. Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And Joanne,
[1:35:49] you're always here. You you cast a real
[1:35:54] uh
[1:35:55] what shall I say? A respir of
[1:35:57] responsibility.
[1:35:59] I feel well if they can be there, I can
[1:36:02] surely be there. Thank you, brother
[1:36:06] Nathan. If you
[1:36:13] Thank you, brother. Brother,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; we can sing. They that wait upon the
[1:36:19] Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:36:23] Brother Bisll, I remember you singing
[1:36:25] that song at my place
[1:36:29] many years ago.
[1:36:31] Brother Tom and Sister Joanne were
[1:36:33] there. And somewhere I have it in my
[1:36:36] email. I'm going to try to find it.
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:42] They that wait
[1:36:44] upon the Lord
[1:36:47] shall renew
[1:36:49] their strength.
[1:36:51] They shall mount up
[1:36:54] with wings
[1:36:57] as he goes.
[1:37:01] They shall run and not be weary.
[1:37:06] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:37:11] Teach me Lord,
[1:37:13] teach me Lord
[1:37:16] to wait.
[1:37:20] Oh, teach me Lord
[1:37:23] to wait.
[1:37:26] Down on my knees
[1:37:30] till in your own good time.
[1:37:35] You answer
[1:37:37] my plea.
[1:37:39] Teach me not to
[1:37:42] rely
[1:37:44] on what others
[1:37:47] do,
[1:37:48] but to wait
[1:37:51] in prayer for an answer from you. Oh,
[1:37:58] they that wait upon the Lord
[1:38:02] shall renew
[1:38:04] their strength.
[1:38:06] They shall mount up
[1:38:09] with wings like eagles
[1:38:14] and they shall run and not be weary.
[1:38:20] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:38:24] Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait.
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:33] Teach me Lord
[1:38:36] to wait
[1:38:38] while hearts are a flame.
[1:38:42] Help me humble
[1:38:45] my pride
[1:38:47] and call on your name. Keep my faith
[1:38:54] renewed.
[1:38:55] Keep my eyes
[1:38:58] on you.
[1:39:00] Help me be on this earth what you want
[1:39:06] me to be.
[1:39:08] Oh they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:39:14] renew
[1:39:15] their strength.
[1:39:18] They shall mount up with wings like
[1:39:22] eagles.
[1:39:26] They shall run and not be weary. They
[1:39:31] shall walk and not faint.
[1:39:35] Teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord,
[1:39:39] to wait.
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:45] You know that song, Brother Ben? Um, I'm
[1:39:48] not on an I'm not on an ego trip, for he
[1:39:51] knew me, yet he loved me.
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] Oh, he knew
[1:40:00] me.
[1:40:01] Let's all stand. Yet he loved
[1:40:06] me.
[1:40:10] He whose glory
[1:40:13] makes the heaven
[1:40:17] shine.
[1:40:21] Oh, unworthy
[1:40:27] of such mercy.
[1:40:33] Yet when he was on the cross,
[1:40:40] oh, I was on his mind.
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:48] I'm not on an ego trip.
[1:40:54] I'm nothing
[1:40:57] on my own.
[1:41:00] I make mistakes and often slip,
[1:41:07] just common flesh and bones.
[1:41:11] But he'll prove one day just what I say.
[1:41:18] I'm of a special kind.
[1:41:23] When he was on the cross,
[1:41:29] oh, I was on his mind.
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] Oh, he knew
[1:41:40] me
[1:41:42] yet he loved me.
[1:41:50] He whose glory makes the heaven shine.
[1:41:58] Oh, I'm so unworthy
[1:42:05] of such mercy.
[1:42:11] And when he was on the cross,
[1:42:17] oh, I was on his mind. We'll sing that
[1:42:22] chorus together once more of just
[1:42:28] while they're playing it softly. I'm
[1:42:29] going to ask our brother Tim Dodd to
[1:42:31] come in, take us to the throne of grace
[1:42:33] and closing prayer. But there's a prayer
[1:42:35] request here for Sister Rice that called
[1:42:39] in for prayer for her husband,
[1:42:42] Brother James Rice. He's got double
[1:42:45] pneumonia and COVID and has been
[1:42:47] admitted to the hospital and needs the
[1:42:50] Lord to intervene. So, we're going to
[1:42:53] take that need to the throne of grace
[1:42:55] and brother Tim comes.
[1:42:57] Aren't you glad the Lord Jesus
[1:43:00] as our brother Biscll brought out so
[1:43:03] well that
[1:43:05] he was a man but
[1:43:08] and he wanted if it was possible to
[1:43:11] bypass the cup but he was willing to do
[1:43:13] the father's will and that was for a
[1:43:16] need just like this.
[1:43:18] It was for our needs,
[1:43:21] for our
[1:43:23] for revelation,
[1:43:24] for understanding,
[1:43:26] for the Lord to become real to us so
[1:43:28] that he could come to us. He knew us and
[1:43:31] he loved us and he went all the way for
[1:43:33] us. Amen. We'll sing that once more.
[1:43:36] Brother Tim, I'll ask you to come.
[1:43:39] Oh, he knew
[1:43:42] me
[1:43:45] yet he loved
[1:43:48] me.
[1:43:52] He whose glory makes the heaven
[1:43:58] shine.
[1:44:02] No one un worthy
[1:44:08] of such mercy.
[1:44:14] Yet when he was on the cross,
[1:44:20] oh I was on his mind.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you're on his
[1:44:29] mind? His mind is eternal. He can't lose
[1:44:34] you from his mind.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; You're always on his thoughts. Let's bow
[1:44:38] our heads together in a word of prayer.
[1:44:40] If you have a need this evening, this
[1:44:42] afternoon, why don't you just hold that
[1:44:44] before the Lord as we ask God to
[1:44:47] intervene for this situation and for
[1:44:50] many others? Heavenly Father,
[1:44:55] Lord, your word so ministers to our
[1:44:59] hearts. Oh God,
[1:45:01] Lord, we thank you for the gift that you
[1:45:05] put in this body in Brother Biscll. Oh
[1:45:07] God, we thank you for his life, his
[1:45:11] testimony,
[1:45:12] his ministry, but above all, we thank
[1:45:15] you for your grace and how you provide
[1:45:18] all these things. Lord, I think of your
[1:45:21] prophets saying, "Grace provided a
[1:45:23] prophet. Grace provided water from the
[1:45:26] rock. Grace provided mana from heaven.
[1:45:29] Oh God, grace provides the church,
[1:45:32] pastors and evangelists and prophets and
[1:45:36] teachers and so forth. Oh God, it's your
[1:45:38] grace, Lord. And by your grace, Lord, we
[1:45:42] are saved. And Lord, if we can see you
[1:45:44] as our savior, we can see you as our
[1:45:46] healer. for it's a doublesided covenant
[1:45:50] as it were. Lord, it's a it didn't just
[1:45:52] provide for our eternal benefit of
[1:45:55] salvation, but it provided knowing that
[1:45:57] we would need divine healing in this
[1:46:00] hour, oh Lord, an hour of much weakness
[1:46:02] of the human flesh. You said that people
[1:46:05] would grow weaker, the wiser, oh God.
[1:46:09] And we see weakness and Lord, yet in the
[1:46:12] midst of our weakness, your strength is
[1:46:14] made perfect. And so we so Lord we ask
[1:46:18] for brother Rice we pray oh God as our
[1:46:21] sister has written in Lord may your
[1:46:23] healing virtue go to him now Lord may it
[1:46:27] drive out this demon called CO or
[1:46:30] whatever they want to call him Lord we
[1:46:33] ask that you'll strengthen his body and
[1:46:35] the body will reject the thing oh God
[1:46:38] many are the afflictions of the
[1:46:40] righteous but the Lord deliverth them
[1:46:42] out of them all doesn't matter one
[1:46:45] disease from another. Cancer is no
[1:46:47] different than a toothache, Lord.
[1:46:49] They're all the same. You are the God
[1:46:52] that heals all of our sicknesses and
[1:46:54] diseases.
[1:46:56] Lord, those that are in pain, raise them
[1:46:58] out of their pain, oh God. Those that
[1:47:01] are in trouble, raise them out of their
[1:47:03] trouble, oh Lord, we commit them. You
[1:47:05] see the hands that are raised. You see
[1:47:08] the commitments that are being made, oh
[1:47:10] God. people that are needing you, Lord.
[1:47:12] We're asking you once again, may you
[1:47:14] remember them, Lord. We commit them into
[1:47:17] your hands. We thank you for this
[1:47:19] morning's service. We thank you for each
[1:47:22] and every one. We ask, Lord, your
[1:47:24] blessing as we go our way, Lord. May you
[1:47:27] go with each one, Lord. May you watch
[1:47:29] over us on the roads. And may you watch
[1:47:32] over us in the days ahead. And Lord, if
[1:47:35] you would grant it, Lord, we would be
[1:47:37] happy if you'd lift the restrictions and
[1:47:40] allow your people to come back together
[1:47:43] around the throne of worship. Oh God,
[1:47:45] Lord, we thank you for your grace. We
[1:47:47] thank you for your blessings. We commit
[1:47:49] ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name.
