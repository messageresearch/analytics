[6:41] Can we all sing it together this
[6:43] morning? Shall we lift it up to him?
[6:46] Every morningless,
[6:56] every day.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Has he changed your life?
[7:05] You prayed on me in your
[7:09] Lord. You f me.
[7:13] [Music]
[7:16] yesterday
[7:18] forever.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; That's one thing that I hope for sure.
[7:29] [Music]
[7:33] You made your mercies
[7:36] [Music]
[7:40] every morning.
[7:42] [Music]
[7:46] Hallelujah.
[7:47] Amen. Truly wonderful to be in the house
[7:50] of the Lord gathered with saints of like
[7:53] precious faith. Look around and see the
[7:56] different ministers that are coming
[7:57] back. Brother Ernie just returning from
[7:59] the Philippines. It's like great eagles
[8:01] soaring back in. Touchdown just for a
[8:04] few minutes. Brother Tony back. Saw
[8:06] brother John I believe back from
[8:08] Edmonton. He's coming back to get
[8:10] refreshed. That's why we're here this
[8:13] morning, to get refreshed in the
[8:14] presence of the Lord. It's the last
[8:17] Sunday service of the year, 2007, close
[8:20] out the year, and we just want the Lord
[8:22] to have his way, to be pleased to come
[8:25] down and dwell with in the praises of
[8:27] his people this morning. I thought maybe
[8:29] we should start the service off with a
[8:31] song. I pledge allegiance to the lamb.
[8:34] Be a great way to end the year. Great
[8:36] way to begin the new year coming in. So,
[8:39] why don't we sing it together this
[8:40] morning?
[8:43] I have heard how
[8:47] long ago
[8:50] were brought before
[8:54] a tone.
[8:56] They were told that he would spare their
[9:02] lives if they would reounce
[9:07] the name of Christ.
[9:11] But one by one
[9:14] they chose to die.
[9:17] The son of God they would noteny
[9:24] like a great angel
[9:28] quiet.
[9:30] I can almost hear their voice.
[9:37] I pledge alance
[9:41] to the lamb
[9:43] with all my strength. With all I am, I
[9:50] will seek to honor his command.
[9:56] I pledge alce
[10:00] to
[10:03] the lamb.
[10:06] Now the years have come
[10:09] and the years have gone
[10:12] but the cause of Jesus
[10:16] it still goes on. Now our time it has
[10:21] come.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Will you count the cost today?
[10:26] reject this whole world to embrace
[10:30] the cross. So one by one,
[10:35] let us live our lives
[10:38] to the one who died
[10:42] to give us life till that trumpet sound
[10:47] on that final day.
[10:51] Let us proudly stand
[10:54] and Holy Spir
[11:00] [Music]
[11:04] with all my strength, with all I am. I
[11:10] will seek to
[11:14] his command.
[11:17] I pledge al
[11:20] to
[11:23] the lamb.
[11:25] It's to the lamb of God
[11:29] who bore my face.
[11:33] He stood there.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; He took my place.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[11:41] To
[11:43] his command.
[11:45] I bless
[11:49] It's true.
[11:58] Hallelujah.
[12:00] We pledge our allegiance to you this
[12:02] morning, Father. How the world would
[12:04] desire to take that out of us, Lord. But
[12:07] we want to stand this morning in your
[12:10] courts, oh Father, worship the lamb that
[12:12] was slain. Give glory and honor and
[12:16] praise, all power and majesty.
[12:20] We worship you this morning, Jesus.
[12:23] [Music]
[12:24] Hallelujah.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to your wonderful name, Lord.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:43] You are my strength when I am weak.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; You are the treure that I see. You are
[12:54] my
[12:55] [Music]
[12:59] morning.
[13:02] [Music]
[13:06] Oh, I want the Holy Ghost to prove you
[13:11] are my
[13:15] [Music]
[13:18] Jesus,
[13:20] [Music]
[13:22] Lamb of God.
[13:26] Worthy
[13:28] is your name
[13:34] Jesus.
[13:38] Lamb of God,
[13:42] worthy
[13:44] is your name.
[13:51] taking my same
[13:55] rising again. I bless your name. You are
[14:00] my all.
[14:07] When I fall down, you lift me up. When I
[14:12] am dry, fill my cup. You are my all in
[14:18] all.
[14:22] Jesus,
[14:24] [Music]
[14:26] lamb of God.
[14:30] Worthy
[14:32] is your name.
[14:38] Jesus.

[15:29] lamb of God.

[15:35] is your name.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; How great is that name? Jesus.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[15:48] Worthy
[15:50] is your name. The musicians just bring
[15:54] us in softly.
[15:56] Jesus,
[15:58] [Music]
[16:00] lamb of God.
[16:05] Worthy
[16:07] is your name.
[16:11] [Music]
[16:14] Jesus,
[16:18] lamb of God.
[16:22] Worthy
[16:25] is your name.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:33] How worthy is your name, Lord. Lord,
[16:36] we've set aside this day unto thee, oh
[16:38] God, that you would come down amongst
[16:41] your people this morning, Lord, that you
[16:44] would be as it was with the people of
[16:46] Israel, Lord, where your great pillar of
[16:49] fire would come down and stand in the
[16:51] camp. That's our desire this morning,
[16:54] Lord, that your fullness would be found
[16:57] amongst us. Father,
[17:00] &gt;&gt; how worthy are you, Lord, of our worship
[17:03] and our praise.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:09] Hallelujah.
[17:11] Hallelujah.
[17:13] You're all I want. You're all I need.
[17:18] [Music]
[17:20] You're all
[17:22] I want.
[17:26] Heavenly Father,
[17:29] you're all
[17:31] that I need.
[17:34] [Music]
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, we worship you
[17:40] in the beauty of holiness.
[17:44] What your word has done for us.
[17:49] Hiding in our heart. We will not let the
[17:54] enemy
[17:57] Steal it away.
[18:02] You're all
[18:04] I want.
[18:07] Heavenly Father,
[18:10] you're all
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wonder if we could all stand on
[18:14] our feet and lift it up to him this
[18:16] morning.
[18:18] You're all
[18:20] I want,
[18:23] heavenly father.
[18:26] You're all
[18:28] that I need.
[18:33] Lord, we worship you
[18:36] in the beauty of holiness.
[18:39] For what your word has done for us.
[18:44] We hide in our hearts. We will not let
[18:49] the enemy
[18:52] steal it away.
[18:57] You're all I want.
[19:02] Heavenly Father,
[19:05] you're all I want.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; It's the end of this church.
[19:12] You're all
[19:15] I want.
[19:18] Heavenly Father,
[19:20] you're all
[19:24] &gt;&gt; You're all we need this morning, Lord.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, we worship you
[19:31] in the beauty of holiness.
[19:34] What your word has done for us.
[19:39] We hide it in our heart. We will not let
[19:44] the enemy
[19:47] steal it away.
[19:52] You're all
[19:54] I want.
[19:57] Heavenly Father,
[19:59] you are all I
[20:03] [Music]
[20:22] long
[20:24] to worship.
[20:26] with you.
[20:30] [Music]
[20:38] How we long to worship
[20:43] you,
[20:45] oh Lord. We come to you
[20:50] in worship.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Do you come and worship this morning?
[20:55] No matter what your weakest,
[20:58] &gt;&gt; no matter what the circumstances are, no
[21:01] matter what
[21:04] the situation,
[21:08] Lord, we will live
[21:11] Holy.
[21:13] [Music]
[21:24] How we long
[21:26] to worship
[21:29] you?
[21:33] [Music]
[21:40] How we long to worship
[21:44] you.
[21:46] [Music]
[21:55] How we long to worship
[21:59] you.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Just shut in with God this morning.
[22:04] Just invite him into your little temple
[22:07] &gt;&gt; right there where you are. Just invite
[22:09] the Holy Spirit
[22:10] &gt;&gt; to come and minister. Minister strength.
[22:14] [Music]
[22:25] How we
[22:28] worship
[22:30] you.
[22:32] [Music]
[22:40] How we long to worship
[22:45] you.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:57] Hallelujah. Lord, we want to take time
[23:00] this morning from the abundance of our
[23:03] heart and give you thanks
[23:06] to give you praise, Lord Jesus, to let
[23:09] the formality slip away, to let your
[23:12] presence brood over us, oh God.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are welcome
[23:20] in our midst this morning.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:26] Thank you, Jesus.
[23:28] Lord, you've touched our lives. We're
[23:31] here to give you praise this morning,
[23:33] Lord. It's with thanksgiving in our
[23:35] hearts, Lord, that we approach you,
[23:37] Father.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, we give you praise, Lord Jesus.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; There's a great great welling up in our
[23:46] hearts, Lord.
[23:48] Oh, the little river can do nothing more
[23:51] than make a little sound. There's
[23:53] something pushing in behind it, Lord.
[23:56] That's the way we feel this morning,
[23:58] Father.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, you've done so much for us,
[24:03] Lord. We're such a privileged people to
[24:06] be able to stand this morning in health
[24:09] and body.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, to know the revelation of your
[24:14] word for this hour. The great light is
[24:16] shone upon us.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; You've set us free, Lord, from the
[24:23] chains of bondage.
[24:26] Oh that held us captive.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:38] Our God is wonderful.
[24:40] Our God is so great.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Beyond our comprehension, this third
[24:46] dimension would so quickly desire to
[24:48] deceive us and tell us that all we can
[24:51] see is all that really matters. But
[24:54] there's a whole another realm that he
[24:56] would desire the believers to come into
[24:58] this morning where all things are
[25:01] possible to them that believe. We want
[25:04] to be believing for the Smoltz family
[25:07] this morning. There was a prayer request
[25:09] for our brother Terry Smoltz's wife,
[25:11] Sister Shannon. Spent the night in the
[25:13] ER last night. The doctors couldn't
[25:16] quite track what the virus was that
[25:18] attacked her, quite where it came from.
[25:21] But we have a God who knows exactly how
[25:24] it came in and knows exactly how it's
[25:26] going to go out. So we just want to join
[25:28] our hearts together this morning.
[25:30] Brother Lance, would you come down and
[25:32] lead us in prayer this morning? We just
[25:34] want to join our hearts together with
[25:36] them. Ask that the Lord would have his
[25:39] will and way in their life.
[25:42] Many of the congregation may be
[25:44] traveling over the holiday weekend.
[25:49] Does your heart go out for ones who are
[25:51] not among us? Those that have
[25:55] slipped away for whatever reason they're
[25:58] not here with us. Maybe we can just join
[26:00] our hearts together as a body of
[26:02] believers would cry out to the Lord.
[26:04] Lord, do something. Send your Holy
[26:06] Spirit by their way this morning.
[26:08] Father,
[26:10] allow grace where we cannot extend
[26:13] grace, but our God is more than able to
[26:16] extend grace this morning.
[26:20] Amen. Let's pray.
[26:23] Our gracious heavenly father, with joy
[26:26] in our hearts,
[26:28] with faith in our hearts, we come to you
[26:30] this morning
[26:33] believing Lord that we are your
[26:35] children. And being children of God, we
[26:38] have a right to come before the throne
[26:40] of grace.
[26:41] And Lord, how thankful we are this
[26:43] morning that we're not approaching a God
[26:45] that one time came down on Mount Si with
[26:49] the law and there was lightnings and
[26:51] thunders. So much so that even Moses
[26:53] himself trembled and quake. But Lord,
[26:56] we're coming to Mount Zion. We're coming
[26:59] to a throne of grace. We're coming, God,
[27:01] to lay our petitions before a God that
[27:04] has redeemed us through the blood of
[27:05] Jesus Christ. And Lord, with this we can
[27:08] come with assurance, knowing God that
[27:10] you hear the prayers of your people.
[27:13] Lord, we're not coming to a God that
[27:15] cannot hear, a God that is fabricated in
[27:18] the minds of man, but we're coming to a
[27:20] living savior, one that has touched our
[27:23] hearts, one that has uh changed our
[27:26] lives, one that has wooed us from the
[27:28] pits of sin and debauchery. And we can
[27:31] come clean before you this morning, God,
[27:33] with thanksgiving in our heart and
[27:35] laying our petitions before you,
[27:37] knowing, God, that you not only hear our
[27:39] prayer, but you answer our prayer. And
[27:42] so, Lord, for every burden and every
[27:44] need that is represented here, Lord, we
[27:48] cast our care upon you because you care
[27:51] for us. And we're asking Lord that
[27:54] you'll meet every need and answer every
[27:57] prayer and release every burden heart
[28:00] Lord Jesus. And as we come Lord we come
[28:03] not just asking but Lord may we leave
[28:06] this great throne of grace with a
[28:08] thanksgiving in our heart. How often
[28:11] have we heard brother Brandham saying
[28:13] now go rejoicing whether we feel it
[28:16] whether we see it. Lord, may the eyes of
[28:19] faith just look beyond that realm of the
[28:22] mortal into the immortal realm and
[28:25] knowing that all things are possible to
[28:27] them that believe. And so God, we commit
[28:30] every need to you. every heart that is
[28:33] represented here, every burden that goes
[28:36] out even to the internet. God, we ask
[28:39] Jesus that we would just be able to
[28:42] touch the hem of your garment and have
[28:46] this faith within our heart. I know a
[28:49] God that answers prayer, Lord. And as we
[28:53] approach the word of God this morning,
[28:57] as your uh servant will stand behind the
[29:00] sacred desk, may father you anoint him.
[29:03] May you anoint every heart. May Jesus,
[29:07] every heart be uh revelated by your
[29:11] spirit. How often have we heard that a
[29:14] man can speak truth, but it takes the
[29:17] spirit of God to reveal the truth? Holy
[29:20] Spirit of God, reveal the truth to our
[29:23] hearts that we might continue to walk in
[29:25] the light as you are in the light as we
[29:28] commit all things to you in Jesus name.
[29:32] Amen and amen.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this
[29:39] morning.
[29:43] Sister Melanie Archeletta has a special
[29:45] for us this morning.
[29:47] Right after Sister Melanie, Brother
[29:48] Ryan's going to bless us with a special.
[29:50] So, if they'd come and get ready, we do
[29:53] want to greet each and every one of you
[29:54] this morning. The lovely name of our
[29:56] Lord Jesus Christ. Those on the internet
[29:58] hookup and the invisible audience on the
[30:00] telephone hookup. We want to also greet
[30:02] you, say, "God bless you." We want to
[30:05] welcome
[30:06] uh we will just have them stand. Sister
[30:09] Linda Moritz's brother Andre Ratif and
[30:12] his wife
[30:13] uh I believe it's pronounced Elsa. If
[30:17] they'd stand and I believe they have
[30:20] three children with them as well.
[30:22] Children.
[30:24] God bless you.
[30:27] Bless you. We want to welcome you into
[30:29] the service of the Lord this morning. We
[30:31] have a couple of announcements we need
[30:32] to make real quickly.
[30:35] Because of the wedding on the weekend of
[30:37] January 11th, the young people's meeting
[30:41] is going to be January 18th and the
[30:43] 25th. So those will be backtoback
[30:45] Fridays. So all the young people be
[30:47] apprised of that. There will be a New
[30:49] Year's Day family skate
[30:52] and all of that information will be on
[30:53] the back bulletin board and that's at
[30:55] Langley Twin Rinks. The senior choir
[30:57] practice has been moved up to 5:00 pm
[31:00] this evening sharp. And
[31:05] be refreshed in the Lord today. This is
[31:07] our only service. So take advantage of
[31:10] every little ounce that you can squeeze
[31:11] out of the minister this morning. He has
[31:13] the whole rest of the day off. So right,
[31:17] Brother Tom, that's right. All that we
[31:20] can get, we want to take from our pastor
[31:22] this morning. whatever the Lord would
[31:24] have laid on his heart. There will be a
[31:27] watch night service tomorrow evening,
[31:29] 900 pm
[31:31] and it says until and then there will be
[31:33] no Wednesday night service either. So
[31:36] we'll be back here regular services
[31:38] starting next Sunday.
[31:42] Bless you.
[31:47] [Music]
[32:02] You're standing in a cold valley.
[32:06] [Music]
[32:09] You dread to face the coming day and all
[32:13] you must go through. The mistakes that
[32:17] you have made of leave you so afraid.
[32:23] But you can rest in knowing I'll be with
[32:25] you
[32:27] all the way.
[32:29] [Music]
[32:31] I know the place from where you come and
[32:35] the place where you should be. I
[32:38] understand the pain you've held inside
[32:42] and your longing to be free.
[32:45] Your sins have been erased. I can no
[32:49] longer find a trace.
[32:53] My love flows to a hand of grace
[32:58] from a heart of mercy.
[33:01] [Music]
[33:07] I've taken your burdens to myself. I've
[33:11] washed them all away.
[33:14] You have no need to feel discouraged.
[33:17] I'll guide you every day.
[33:21] You're my beloved bride and you are a
[33:25] part of me.
[33:28] Come to me with all your cares. I'll
[33:31] give you sweet release.
[33:35] I know the place from where you've come
[33:39] and the place where you should be. I
[33:42] understand the pain you've held inside
[33:45] and you're longing to be free.
[33:49] Your sins have been erased. You can no
[33:53] longer find a trace.
[33:58] [Music]
[34:01] I know the place from where you come.
[34:05] Found a place where you should be. I
[34:09] understand the pain you held inside and
[34:12] you're longing to be free.
[34:16] Your sins have been erased. I can no
[34:19] longer find a trace.
[34:23] My love flows to a hand of grace.
[34:28] My love flows to a hand of grace.
[34:32] My love flows to a hand of grace
[34:37] from a heart of mercy.
[34:41] [Music]
[34:49] [Applause]
[35:32] [Music]
[35:48] The journey that we travel is a winding
[35:53] narrow road.
[35:56] And there are times we stumble
[36:00] a heavy
[36:02] load.
[36:05] Always there's a voice to tell you
[36:09] you'll never make it in.
[36:13] Reminding you of all your failures and
[36:17] long forgotten sin.
[36:21] You know within your heart God's blood
[36:25] has washed you white as snow.
[36:29] Still in your mind, the battle rages and
[36:34] threatens all you know.
[36:37] But even if you're pushed beyond where
[36:41] you feel you can stand,
[36:45] just remember you can put your faith in
[36:50] God's unfailing
[36:52] hand
[36:55] for you.
[36:59] But you won't break.
[37:03] You may stumble
[37:07] and even feel you've lost your way, but
[37:11] you won't fall.
[37:15] God's word
[37:17] remains.
[37:19] You won't be bound
[37:23] by broken chains.
[37:27] You won't be bound
[37:31] by broken
[37:33] chains.
[37:38] [Music]
[37:45] Even though a thousand storms may rage
[37:49] within your life,
[37:53] you will find a resting place within the
[37:58] arms of Christ. We've risen far beyond
[38:03] the realm of lying circumstance.
[38:08] Oh, and nothing formed against this
[38:11] bride will ever stand a chance.
[38:16] Now, you don't have to listen when that
[38:21] voice says you're not free.
[38:25] For God's ordained that you and I should
[38:29] walk in liberty.
[38:33] And freedom's been proclaimed to all the
[38:37] captive and the bound.
[38:40] And in Jesus name, you can hear those
[38:44] chains fall broken to the ground.
[38:50] Fall broken to the ground.
[38:56] You may
[38:59] but you won't pray.
[39:04] You may stumble
[39:07] and even feel you've lost your way, but
[39:12] you won't fall.
[39:15] God's word remains.
[39:19] You won't be found
[39:23] by broken chains.
[39:27] You can't be found.
[39:31] You may be,
[39:35] but you won't break.
[39:39] You may stumble.
[39:42] Oh, and even feel you've lost your way,
[39:47] but you won't fall.
[39:50] God's word
[39:52] remains.
[39:54] You won't be bound
[39:58] by broken chain.
[40:02] You won't be bound
[40:06] by broken chains.
[40:10] You won't be bound.
[40:14] My broken chains
[40:17] you can't be bound.
[40:22] Oh no.
[40:25] A broken chain
[40:29] [Music]
[40:41] by broken
[40:44] chain.
[40:51] Amen.
[40:54] Bless you, brother Ryan, sister, for
[40:57] singing those specials. We appreciate
[40:59] that from their hearts. Amen. As we
[41:02] invite our pastor to come this morning,
[41:04] why don't we just sing together? I bless
[41:06] your name. I bless your name. And
[41:07] prisoners chains
[41:10] with bleeding stripes. Paul and Silas,
[41:12] they reach down inside. They got a hold
[41:15] of something. That's what we've got a
[41:16] hold of this morning.
[41:19] In prisoners chain
[41:23] [Music]
[41:25] with
[41:31] all
[41:33] [Music]
[41:46] began to sing.
[41:54] [Music]
[42:01] I bless your name.
[42:07] I bless your
[42:09] [Music]
[42:12] I
[42:14] [Music]
[42:32] bless your
[42:33] [Music]
[42:36] My destin.
[42:38] [Music]
[42:42] I
[42:46] [Music]
[42:53] praise God.
[42:56] [Music]
[43:00] reach out and pray
[43:04] [Music]
[43:10] and they will call
[43:15] in Jesus
[43:17] name.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I bless your name.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; I bless the redeemed of the Lord this
[43:28] morning. I give you
[43:33] [Music]
[43:36] the praise.
[43:39] You are the
[43:44] truth, the way.
[43:49] I bless your name.
[43:53] I bless your name.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; As we stand on our feet, we bless your
[43:58] name.
[43:59] your name.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[44:08] We give you all
[44:12] and give you praise.
[44:17] You are the
[44:23] way.
[44:27] I bless your name.
[44:31] I bless your name.
[44:36] [Music]
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a lot of different
[44:40] ways to bless his name.
[44:43] We're here not only with our mouth but
[44:46] with our presence. We're here to bless
[44:48] his name. Amen.
[44:54] Are you happy to be alive?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful that you have some
[45:00] another opportunity to say praise God?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[45:07] thankful to be a brother, a sister in
[45:10] the family of God, that God picked you
[45:13] out of humanity,
[45:15] to be a part of the kingdom.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ernie. Nice
[45:20] to see you.
[45:23] I'm glad to be alive this morning in the
[45:25] land of the living.
[45:28] David said, "The dead, they praise not
[45:30] the Lord, who are here alive."
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you can never you can
[45:36] never wear out the praises of God.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] Uh we've had prayer this morning, but I
[45:43] just wanted to
[45:46] have the congregation remember uh
[45:49] brother Patrick Aongo.
[45:51] Uh some of you may have heard
[45:55] but our brother Patrick and incidentally
[45:57] I think every time that uh something of
[46:01] this nature is brought before the
[46:04] congregation we should also be mindful
[46:06] that this could be anybody. This could
[46:09] be me. This could be you. You know that
[46:12] uh we we don't have any guarantee that
[46:15] we're going to see the sunrise tomorrow
[46:17] morning. We have no guarantee of that.
[46:20] Uh, brother Patrick had just come back
[46:23] from Congo not very long ago.
[46:26] Sister Rebecca, his wife, is still over
[46:28] there and he wasn't feeling just 100%
[46:33] apparently, but he went into a bank and
[46:35] came out of a bank and then collapsed
[46:37] and and they called an ambulance and
[46:41] just then uh there was an African woman
[46:44] going by. So they said, "Well, do you
[46:47] know this man?" know, she didn't know,
[46:49] but she's uh from Burundi herself and is
[46:53] married to a congalles brother. They
[46:55] were just the you know, married to a
[46:58] congalles brother or a man, I should
[47:00] say. And uh so they had her apparently
[47:04] go in the ambulance uh to the hospital.
[47:08] He went into a coma and they uh thought
[47:12] they determined it was uh malaria and
[47:15] that the malaria had gone to the brain
[47:18] and become cerebral malaria which is
[47:21] actually the last stage of malaria. and
[47:24] they found on his cell phone his wife's
[47:27] number in Congo and called her and told
[47:32] her to hurry back to Canada because they
[47:36] thought that her husband could die at
[47:38] any time. Now, here's a strong man in
[47:41] his 30s and in moments you're in another
[47:46] place.
[47:47] So,
[47:49] uh,
[47:51] Brother Joim, Brother Emmanuel here, uh,
[47:56] got the phone call. Brother Joahim got
[47:58] the phone call from Sister Rebecca and
[48:01] then got our number and called us as
[48:03] well. I didn't get the message till the
[48:06] next morning, but they went to the
[48:09] hospital and and asked the staff to
[48:12] allow them to go in, which they didn't
[48:16] want to permit at first because they do
[48:20] not were not really well acquainted with
[48:22] some of the tropical diseases here and
[48:25] do not have medication for it either.
[48:28] The only medication for the malaria is
[48:31] at Vancouver General and they have some
[48:34] for the entire province, but that's the
[48:36] only place they have it. And uh so
[48:39] brother Joe, brother Emanuel were
[48:42] permitted then to go in and they prayed
[48:45] for him.
[48:47] uh they got the medication to him within
[48:49] 30 minutes from Vancouver General and uh
[48:54] yesterday, this is just day before
[48:55] yesterday and yesterday he did open his
[48:59] eyes and apparently the nurse uh said
[49:04] that he could recognize his own name
[49:08] uh but then began to struggle and so
[49:11] they have him now on an induced coma.
[49:14] He's still in a coma. And so we are
[49:17] praying uh for him now today as a
[49:19] congregation. He's been amongst us and
[49:22] Sister Rebecca is still in the Congo.
[49:25] Uh his his uh situation is grave, but
[49:29] they did they did do a a CAT scan in and
[49:32] of his brain and were able to say last
[49:35] night that the malaria had not reached
[49:38] the brain. And we are indeed thankful
[49:41] for that.
[49:43] And I would say to brother Joim, brother
[49:45] Emmanuel, that I believe their prayer
[49:48] stopped it because there was no other
[49:51] reason for it to stop.
[49:54] And they already thought that he had it
[49:55] and that's why he was in that coma and
[49:58] he's on life support because it's in his
[50:02] chest and uh and so they were pumping
[50:05] the medication into him now. But I
[50:08] believe that prayer reached it before
[50:09] medication did. That's my own firm
[50:12] belief.
[50:14] Our prayer is our most powerful weapon
[50:17] and we must never forget that. So, God
[50:20] bless the brothers. They have not stood
[50:22] behind the pulpit and preached, but as
[50:24] far as I'm concerned, they achieved a
[50:26] great victory for God.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; And so, we can pray for our brother and
[50:31] pray for sister Rebecca. And naturally,
[50:33] you can imagine what a young wife and a
[50:36] young mother her feeling this morning.
[50:38] uh or even now knowing that her husband
[50:40] is laying in a in this condition, but I
[50:44] believe that God will hear us as we
[50:47] pray.
[50:48] So, we're going to pray together and and
[50:51] we'll pray also for the service and the
[50:55] word that the Lord wants us to hear.
[50:59] Father, we will we will soon be opening
[51:02] the scriptures
[51:04] and soon be reading words that you have
[51:06] inspired for all scriptures given by
[51:09] inspiration.
[51:11] We believe that you have breathed upon
[51:14] and through your prophets and your holy
[51:18] men and the holy apostles.
[51:21] You have caused, oh God, uh a word in
[51:25] season. You have caused the word to be
[51:28] spoken and scribed down so that it could
[51:32] be read and known, oh God, that the Holy
[51:35] Spirit then would take that word which
[51:37] is Christ. A word which was time locked
[51:41] for a certain season. And now we've come
[51:43] to a season, oh God, coming now to a
[51:47] turn of another year on our calendar.
[51:50] But you are timeless. You are eternal.
[51:54] And we are eternal in you, Lord. We were
[51:57] in your thoughts before the world ever
[52:00] came into existence. Before the universe
[52:04] was made, oh God, we cannot grasp your
[52:08] greatness and how marvelous you are. But
[52:11] we are here believing that you have put
[52:13] breath into these bodies. We believe
[52:16] that you have brought us and have seen
[52:19] us all down through the lineage that we
[52:22] have come down through, Lord, to this
[52:25] moment. We believe that you've had a
[52:27] hand in bringing us from nations, uh,
[52:31] many nations and different countries and
[52:33] different cities and places. And you've
[52:35] brought us into this sanctuary today.
[52:38] And you've allowed, oh God, that the
[52:40] voice and the atmosphere, the service
[52:43] would reach into homes around the world,
[52:46] Lord, in many different lands. And they
[52:49] are our brothers and sisters, part of
[52:51] the bride body of Jesus Christ. And so
[52:54] today, Lord, we unite our hearts
[52:57] together. And we're here asking you, oh
[53:00] God, to hear our words and to see our
[53:03] hearts as we pray for Brother Patrick.
[53:06] Lord, I thank you that we've had men of
[53:08] faith that have gone and stood at the
[53:11] bedside and brought a halt to the enemy
[53:14] who's tried to take his life
[53:16] prematurely.
[53:18] Oh God, you're a God of the
[53:21] supernatural. You are supernatural,
[53:23] Lord. You're far beyond this realm that
[53:25] we're in and our faith, Lord, the sixth
[53:28] sense. We reach out there, Lord, knowing
[53:31] and giving you glory for a work already
[53:34] done. And we pray, Lord, you will raise
[53:36] him up and give him a testimony in his
[53:38] mouth, Lord, and do a work in his heart.
[53:41] I pray be with his precious wife, our
[53:44] sister Rebecca, Lord, and her mother and
[53:46] the family, oh God. I pray, Father,
[53:49] you'll just give her a comfort. Give her
[53:51] that peace that passes all
[53:53] understanding. And be with us now this
[53:56] morning, Lord, as we give you thanks for
[53:59] hearing our prayers and seeing our
[54:01] desires, Lord. And we know that it shall
[54:04] be done. You said that if we believe, if
[54:07] we ask and agree together and we agree
[54:10] today, Lord, that it shall be done that
[54:13] the desires of our heart will be met.
[54:16] This is your promise.
[54:18] Give us, I pray, Lord, the direction of
[54:21] the Holy Spirit. Now we give you all the
[54:24] praise and the glory in Jesus name.
[54:27] Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the people said agreement.
[54:31] Amen. Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[54:34] I'll ask you to take your Bibles
[54:37] and uh as you've heard the announcement,
[54:39] no service this evening, service
[54:42] tomorrow night. We're going to have a
[54:44] wonderful time and no service on
[54:47] Wednesday.
[54:48] I'd like you to turn to First
[54:50] Corinthians the 14th chapter.
[54:55] We're going to begin reading at the
[54:56] sixth verse.
[55:05] This is uh
[55:08] we're going to be not only turning a
[55:10] page in the calendar, but we're going to
[55:12] be getting another calendar. I suppose
[55:16] you'll be starting with 208 pretty soon.
[55:19] And who knows what that holds. Maybe 208
[55:22] is rapture.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; I know we get an amen on that one.
[55:28] Hallelujah.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; We're just happy to have you all here
[55:32] and participating in the meeting.
[55:35] Brother Andre and his wife and family.
[55:37] God bless you. So nice to have you. Last
[55:40] time I was with brother Andre, I think
[55:42] was out in the jungle of Africa and they
[55:45] were hunting for meat and I was there
[55:48] enjoying myself and I appreciated that.
[55:51] God bless. Give you a good time here.
[55:55] All right, we're going to read
[55:57] 1 Corinthians 14 and6. Now, brethren, if
[56:01] I come unto you speaking with tongues,
[56:04] what shall I profit you except I shall
[56:06] speak to you either by revelation or by
[56:10] knowledge or by prophesying or by
[56:13] doctrine? And even things without life
[56:17] giving sound, whether pipe or harp,
[56:21] except they give a distinction in the
[56:23] sounds, how shall it be known what is
[56:26] piped or harped? For if the trumpet give
[56:29] an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
[56:32] himself to the battle? So likewise ye,
[56:36] except ye utter by the tongue words easy
[56:40] to be understood, how shall it be known
[56:43] what is spoken? For you shall speak into
[56:46] the air.
[56:48] There are, it may be, so many kinds of
[56:52] voices in the world, and none of them is
[56:56] without signification.
[56:59] I'd like you also to turn, if you would,
[57:00] to Galatians the 2 chapter. going to
[57:03] read just verse 20.
[57:07] Galatians 2 and 20.
[57:11] I am crucified with Christ.
[57:14] Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but
[57:17] Christ liveth in me. And the life which
[57:21] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[57:25] faith of the Son of God who loved me and
[57:29] gave himself for me. That scripture is
[57:31] very personal and I would invite you to
[57:34] read it together with me. Let's read it
[57:37] together. I am crucified with Christ.
[57:41] Nevertheless, I live yet not I but
[57:45] Christ liveth in me and the life of to
[57:48] now live in the flesh. I live by the
[57:52] faith of the Son of God who loved me and
[57:55] gave himself for me. God bless his word
[57:58] to us. You're be seated.
[58:05] I'll just need your full attention now
[58:07] and I'll appreciate that. God will
[58:10] appreciate it. I want to uh take a text
[58:14] and a title for the message out of the
[58:18] scripture we just read in Galatians, the
[58:21] life which I now live.
[58:24] I thought of that in reference to we're
[58:28] closing out a year.
[58:31] The life that I now live, the life I now
[58:35] live in the flesh, in fact, but the life
[58:37] I now live,
[58:40] I live by the faith of the son of God.
[58:45] And faith cometh by hearing,
[58:48] by hearing the word of God.
[58:50] And that's the faith we live by.
[58:54] I want to take also from the first
[58:57] scripture reading in Corinthians
[59:01] that the the the sound there is there
[59:04] are so many kinds of voices in the world
[59:07] and none of them is without
[59:08] signification.
[59:10] And when we think of voice we think of
[59:14] perhaps the voice that you speak with.
[59:18] But I want to suggest to you today that
[59:21] our life, just our life,
[59:25] the kind of people we are
[59:28] is actually a sound.
[59:31] And I will prove that through the
[59:33] scripture and through the message.
[59:37] Um, we come from many, many different
[59:40] nations.
[59:41] We that are seated here today.
[59:45] And if you've traveled and become
[59:47] acquainted with other countries, other
[59:50] peoples,
[59:52] you can observe people. And I'm one that
[59:55] I'm a great I really love to observe
[59:58] people. I can sit on the side of the
[1:00:00] street or sit in an airport. I don't get
[1:00:03] bored because I really like to study
[1:00:06] people and uh study their features and
[1:00:10] study just the way their manner is. And
[1:00:12] quite often you can tell not only that
[1:00:15] this person is from Europe but uh maybe
[1:00:18] a certain part of Europe or this person
[1:00:21] is from Switzerland or Germany or this
[1:00:25] person's from Russia because there are
[1:00:28] just certain features and certain
[1:00:31] mannerisms and and you can kind of tell
[1:00:35] where a person perhaps came from and uh
[1:00:38] and so it is actually saying something
[1:00:41] to you this person is from this part of
[1:00:44] the world or and and even without them
[1:00:47] saying any words you can detect
[1:00:51] something and uh I I'm sure you're
[1:00:54] acquainted with that. I've talked to uh
[1:00:56] I talked to brother DJ about about
[1:00:59] Africa and the and the wars and
[1:01:01] everything in Africa and uh you know
[1:01:04] Congo had a lot of years of war and then
[1:01:07] there was uh uh uh Rwanda and Bundi and
[1:01:12] they were fighting and the different
[1:01:14] tribes were fighting and I just asked I
[1:01:16] was just curious how do they know you
[1:01:19] know how do they know who is of what
[1:01:21] tribe and uh oh he said they can because
[1:01:25] they the features are a little
[1:01:26] different. They can identify it right
[1:01:28] away and you know it's just amazing. So
[1:01:31] the even the features of a person or uh
[1:01:34] and how they are if you know what to
[1:01:36] look for you can see so it starts to
[1:01:39] register to you and you get a message
[1:01:41] well this person is from that part of
[1:01:43] the world.
[1:01:45] the Peter when he was trying to uh you
[1:01:49] know conceal himself in Pilate's
[1:01:52] judgment hall and they they said well
[1:01:55] you were also with him so maybe that
[1:01:57] person saw him but then the little maid
[1:02:00] came says but your speech betrays you
[1:02:03] now she didn't say your words betray you
[1:02:06] but she just could tell from the manner
[1:02:08] of his speech and how he spoke you're
[1:02:11] Galilean there were many Galileans there
[1:02:14] but she identified him. You're a
[1:02:16] Galilean from the manner of the speech.
[1:02:18] This is the way you say things. And
[1:02:21] perhaps the way you conduct yourself.
[1:02:24] And it it starts giving a sound. It
[1:02:27] begins to reverberate. What kind of an
[1:02:30] individual, what kind of a person? The
[1:02:32] Bible says that there is no sound
[1:02:35] without signific signification. And uh
[1:02:39] God when he was speaking to Job, he
[1:02:42] asked Job, "Do you hear the lion's welp?
[1:02:45] Do you hear the you know, do you hear
[1:02:47] the even the birds that cry uh for their
[1:02:50] food and so on? Do you hear that?" Well,
[1:02:53] what kind of sound is that? That and yet
[1:02:56] it had it had a signification. But God
[1:02:59] who created the creature understands
[1:03:03] understands it's crying for food
[1:03:05] understands. Do do you hear the groaning
[1:03:08] when they're bowing themselves down in
[1:03:10] birth? Do you hear that? God could hear
[1:03:14] that. It It's a sound. It meant
[1:03:17] something to God. God looked on his
[1:03:19] creation and he has pleasure in his
[1:03:21] creation. And as he was asking Job all
[1:03:24] these questions, as for Job finally
[1:03:26] says, "I'll put my hand over my mouth. I
[1:03:28] won't even try to answer this." Right?
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; So things without sound
[1:03:37] except they give a distinction of sound.
[1:03:40] How shall we know what is piped or
[1:03:42] harped?
[1:03:45] Brother Brandham uh standing before the
[1:03:48] people and very often
[1:03:52] when there the revealing of the son of
[1:03:56] man and the revelation of the secrets of
[1:03:59] the hearts of the people and he would
[1:04:02] remind them this microphone
[1:04:05] this microphone here I have one here
[1:04:07] closer you maybe can't see but this
[1:04:09] microphone he said this is mute
[1:04:13] this is just mute
[1:04:15] This has no life within itself.
[1:04:18] But but a a a sound if a sound is made
[1:04:22] through it then it is activated
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and and then you you hear something.
[1:04:28] Perhaps if you were if there was no
[1:04:30] electronics here, perhaps people up in
[1:04:33] the balcony or certainly people in the
[1:04:35] fellowship room, they wouldn't be able
[1:04:38] to hear what's going on. They might see
[1:04:40] the screen and see words and see my
[1:04:44] mouth moving say well I know he's saying
[1:04:46] something but my mind is not illuminated
[1:04:50] because I can't hear what is being said
[1:04:53] but the thing is the microphone might be
[1:04:55] there but if there was no uh no
[1:04:58] electricity or it would be mute within
[1:05:01] itself and then brother Brandham is
[1:05:04] saying now not just a microphone but
[1:05:06] he's referring to himself
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; that he is mute mute.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's mute except there be
[1:05:13] one with the knowledge uh that knows the
[1:05:16] secret of the heart of the individual.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the only one that can give
[1:05:21] the sound.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; And so the individual, we as
[1:05:25] individuals, as members of the bride
[1:05:28] body of Jesus Christ, we're mute. We
[1:05:32] don't really have a sound that's worth
[1:05:34] hearing
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; except that God by his spirit will
[1:05:38] somehow speak through this mute
[1:05:41] instrument. And it's important that we
[1:05:43] are mute. It's important that we are not
[1:05:45] here to uh express ourselves or to make
[1:05:49] known, you know, who we are. That's just
[1:05:52] that's just human ego, human pride, and
[1:05:56] it doesn't mean anything to God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; We're here for a purpose. And outside of
[1:06:01] that purpose, we haven't really got uh a
[1:06:05] great deal of of purpose in the world.
[1:06:10] When God spoke to Job, you might be
[1:06:12] interested in this scripture. He said,
[1:06:15] "Who provideth for the raven his food?"
[1:06:19] uh when his young
[1:06:22] uh cry out unto God. When his young when
[1:06:27] the raven the young raven cries out unto
[1:06:30] God, you think the raven knows he's
[1:06:32] crying out to God, but God's telling
[1:06:34] Job, he's crying to me, crying out for
[1:06:38] his food. He said, and he was asking
[1:06:40] him,
[1:06:42] who provideth this? And he says, they
[1:06:44] wonder for lack of meat. And so there
[1:06:47] are there are times when a person
[1:06:51] uh there's a specific moment they're
[1:06:53] crying out for food, but there's times
[1:06:56] for us and I'm laying quite a foundation
[1:06:59] here today and I need I need to take
[1:07:01] this time. There's times in our lives
[1:07:06] when a moment arrives when you need to
[1:07:09] speak and say something because that
[1:07:12] precise moment, it's a critical moment
[1:07:14] and you need to say something. Sometime
[1:07:18] a person needs to say, "Forgive me.
[1:07:22] I'm sorry. I did wrong." And it's
[1:07:26] amazing what those words will do.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; They fix things.
[1:07:33] Amen. There's times to say, and we have
[1:07:37] arrived, I'm sure everyone here, I trust
[1:07:39] everyone has arrived at a moment of
[1:07:42] realization. Says, Lord, I am a sinner.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That moment had to arrive to the thief
[1:07:49] on the cross.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me when you come into
[1:07:54] your kingdom. And so, I want to give you
[1:07:57] another phrase today. Speak now or
[1:08:00] forever hold your peace because this is
[1:08:03] our opportunity. You're not going to
[1:08:06] arrive to this day or this year. 207 is
[1:08:10] gone
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; and you're moving on into another year
[1:08:16] of of our understanding and we do not
[1:08:18] know what the days ahead of us uh will
[1:08:22] hold. But I say that the very fact that
[1:08:25] God has you here, the very fact that he
[1:08:28] even drew you, made himself known to
[1:08:31] you, revealed this word to you, brought
[1:08:33] the message to you, that in itself has
[1:08:36] already told you God's thoughts.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; God's thoughts is I've laid my hand on
[1:08:42] you. I've pulled you. I've drawn you.
[1:08:44] I've opened your eyes. I've opened your
[1:08:46] understanding. I've touched your heart.
[1:08:48] I've touched your spirit. And so this is
[1:08:51] the time that we must now speak with the
[1:08:54] sound of our life.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And our life speaks louder
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; than even words.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Speak now
[1:09:04] or forever hold your peace. There's a
[1:09:07] critical moment.
[1:09:10] When you draw your last breath, your
[1:09:12] life will be done sounding.
[1:09:15] But while you're here, you're still
[1:09:16] sounding. There's a sound from your life
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; and the sound you make is not the sound
[1:09:23] I make. We all make our own individual
[1:09:27] you unique sound in the earth and in our
[1:09:31] unique place wherever that may be. It's
[1:09:35] a sound that only you can make. So I
[1:09:38] want to say to this congregation today
[1:09:39] and all who are hearing the service,
[1:09:42] it's time for us. speak now
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; or forever hold our peace
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; because you'll not have this opportunity
[1:09:51] to to live the life that we're living
[1:09:53] today. You can't live it tomorrow and
[1:09:56] you can't live yesterday's life today.
[1:09:58] This is the only day we can live it. So
[1:10:01] by our very life speak now
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; the life which I now live
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; and I think that's marvelous that
[1:10:10] Apostle Paul said the life that I now
[1:10:12] live I don't live because I ate a
[1:10:14] breakfast this morning or that I had
[1:10:16] certain you know vitamins in my body the
[1:10:18] life I now live I live by the faith of
[1:10:21] the son of God
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah that's what gives us energy
[1:10:26] that's what gives us animation and
[1:10:28] motivation
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; It's a different sort of a life than we
[1:10:35] lived a few years ago.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I thought that some of the young people
[1:10:39] might might have liked and perhaps some
[1:10:42] of the older ones as well would have
[1:10:44] enjoyed. I started thinking about my own
[1:10:46] life.
[1:10:48] I got to say something in 207.
[1:10:52] I got to say something if the Lord
[1:10:54] grants me time in 208. The life has to
[1:10:57] speak. Right.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; So, I got thinking, well, got thinking
[1:11:01] about the first car I ever owned.
[1:11:05] And I thought, I just wonder what what
[1:11:08] the young people would say if I put it
[1:11:10] up on the screen. I actually did find I
[1:11:13] scanned a whole bunch of pictures and
[1:11:15] found a 1947
[1:11:18] a Plymouth Coupe
[1:11:21] and you'd enlight a whole bunch of
[1:11:23] people today said, "Oh, that's cute."
[1:11:25] Well, I thought it was a lot of work
[1:11:26] when I had it. And then I got a 47
[1:11:30] student baker. And then I got thinking
[1:11:32] about where I went to school. I thought,
[1:11:34] "Oh, the kids would like to see this. A
[1:11:36] one room log school." And there's
[1:11:39] probably a few others here that have
[1:11:41] been in similar places. So, I found a
[1:11:44] picture of a log school. I was looking
[1:11:46] for the very one I went to. I thought
[1:11:47] there might even be a picture through
[1:11:49] the marbles of Google, you know. And uh
[1:11:53] I thought that was the funniest word
[1:11:54] when I first heard it, but I use it
[1:11:56] almost every day now. It's not so
[1:11:58] strange. But I I found people that were
[1:12:01] in the same community and there's
[1:12:04] writeups about them. I thought, "Isn't
[1:12:05] that amazing? I know him and I know this
[1:12:08] one and I know that one." I lived at the
[1:12:11] one one family's place and there's their
[1:12:13] name showing up on Google. I thought,
[1:12:15] "This is incredible. This is
[1:12:17] incredible." So I thought you might like
[1:12:19] to see but I I I I'm just not going to
[1:12:22] take the time to the the log school but
[1:12:25] it's it's very different today. So 207
[1:12:28] isn't you know 1943 and 1944
[1:12:32] to but I could have said back then the
[1:12:34] life I now live.
[1:12:37] I ride a horse
[1:12:40] to school and if I haven't got a horse
[1:12:42] and they're using it, I got to walk. And
[1:12:45] the life I now live and mostly walked.
[1:12:49] But the life I now live is quite
[1:12:51] different. But still the same life,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; still the same life that's surging
[1:12:55] through the same body. But what is it
[1:12:57] that motivates it? What is it that moves
[1:13:00] it? What is it that drives it forward?
[1:13:03] And that's the key. That's the thing
[1:13:05] that we want to talk about. the life we
[1:13:07] now live.
[1:13:10] The Bible speaks through Daniel, God
[1:13:13] speaking through Daniel. And he said,
[1:13:15] "But thou, oh Daniel,
[1:13:19] shut up the words and seal the book,
[1:13:22] even to the time of the end. Many shall
[1:13:25] run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
[1:13:28] increased." And it didn't it wasn't hard
[1:13:30] for me looking at my computer and and uh
[1:13:34] just a thought come into your mind and I
[1:13:36] thought how did how's all the young
[1:13:38] people how's the folks going to go to
[1:13:40] church? How am I going to go to church
[1:13:42] tomorrow morning? Well, I'm going to get
[1:13:44] in my car inside this garage and push
[1:13:47] the button and the door's going to go up
[1:13:49] and I'm going to back out and drive on
[1:13:51] my way to church. But then I thought,
[1:13:53] you know, I'm the same person. said,
[1:13:56] "What did you do when you were young and
[1:14:00] boarded out here on this farm?" Thought,
[1:14:02] "Well, I went to church in a lumber
[1:14:04] wagon."
[1:14:06] You don't know what a lumber wagon is,
[1:14:08] but it is what it says. You know, it
[1:14:10] they hold lumber in it or coal in it.
[1:14:12] So, I pulled a picture up of that, too,
[1:14:14] for you. But I just tell you, it is so
[1:14:17] rough. That lumber wagon on a dirt road,
[1:14:20] it just jarred my inside. So, I got
[1:14:23] pains in my side, bad pains. I thought
[1:14:27] this is more torture than walking. I'm
[1:14:29] going to walk.
[1:14:31] So, that's some and then go go three
[1:14:33] miles to church, you know, at about four
[1:14:35] miles an hour. That's a pretty good
[1:14:38] pace. And here they don't think
[1:14:40] anything. Oh, I'm just going to go to
[1:14:41] Lynon. No, I think I'll go down to
[1:14:43] Bellingham. Oh, oh, let's go to Seattle
[1:14:45] or let's get on a plane and go and see
[1:14:47] my girlfriend or my boyfriend. We're all
[1:14:50] going to be going down to a wedding down
[1:14:52] in Idaho, so we can't have the young
[1:14:53] people's service because we're all going
[1:14:55] down. That was that was a nightmare.
[1:14:58] Now, that would have been a wild dream.
[1:15:01] And I thought, going to get on a plane
[1:15:04] and air's going to go out of the tail
[1:15:06] and it's going to fly across the ocean.
[1:15:09] Those things, you know, that was uh uh
[1:15:12] that was Flash Gordon or as we say,
[1:15:14] Flash Gordon.
[1:15:18] Hey. And I'd look at all those things,
[1:15:21] you know, and people with masks on and
[1:15:25] and big uh circular uh freeways and
[1:15:30] people driving in these kind of
[1:15:31] vehicles.
[1:15:33] But the life that I now live, I
[1:15:35] understand that
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; back then it was mysterious. Back then
[1:15:39] it was comic strip stuff. But today
[1:15:42] happens to be a reality. And some of it
[1:15:44] that was in comic strips then is old
[1:15:46] stuff now.
[1:15:49] The life that we now live
[1:15:52] spiritually speaking, we are not back in
[1:15:56] the horse and buggy days spiritually.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And neither are we just in a airplane
[1:16:02] day according to the countdown. We
[1:16:05] happen to be in an astronaut age.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; And a prophet identified that we're
[1:16:12] we're in an astronaut age. And then he
[1:16:15] he he didn't say, "Oh, the horse and
[1:16:17] buggy is nothing new to the scripture."
[1:16:19] But he said, "Uh, astronauts is not new
[1:16:22] to us. We have our astronauts. Enoch was
[1:16:25] one of our astronauts. Elijah was one of
[1:16:28] our astronauts. And Jesus was one." Hey,
[1:16:31] they they just they left. They actually
[1:16:33] left this earth.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Enoch walked with God. Do you believe
[1:16:39] that?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he pleased God? Do
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; you believe he had this testimony that
[1:16:45] he pleased God?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that God took him.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; God took him. It actually something
[1:16:54] physically happened and he passed into
[1:16:57] some other dimension.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] The Bible tells us in the book of Acts,
[1:17:10] the disciples,
[1:17:12] they begin to live out
[1:17:16] a different kind of a life.
[1:17:19] And it says this, "And it shall come to
[1:17:21] pass," Peter speaking, "and it shall
[1:17:24] come to pass afterward, I'm sorry, this
[1:17:26] is Joel now, and then I'm going to go to
[1:17:28] Acts. Joel speaking the prophet. And it
[1:17:31] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[1:17:34] pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and
[1:17:36] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:17:38] prophesy, and your old men shall dream
[1:17:41] dreams, and your young men shall see
[1:17:43] visions.
[1:17:44] Many, many years later, here comes uh
[1:17:48] Peter on the on in Acts two. He says,
[1:17:52] "But this is that here's the people now
[1:17:55] filled with the Holy Spirit and they're
[1:17:57] speaking in tongues and they're
[1:17:59] staggering like drunk people and they're
[1:18:00] out on the streets." And incidentally,
[1:18:02] it happens to be at a time too. I
[1:18:04] thought of this God choosing a
[1:18:07] particular time when all people from
[1:18:10] many many nations were gathered into
[1:18:12] Jerusalem. And God chose that moment to
[1:18:16] bring these people out from the upper
[1:18:18] room full of the Holy Spirit. And it
[1:18:22] says, "But this is that which was spoken
[1:18:25] by the prophet Joel." Now they heard
[1:18:27] them speaking and glorifying God, but
[1:18:30] the whole thing was a mystery to them.
[1:18:33] They didn't understand that these were
[1:18:34] the words of Joel now being manifested
[1:18:38] in their life.
[1:18:41] Now, isn't it amazing that when the Holy
[1:18:44] Spirit took charge of these people and
[1:18:47] took absolute control of them that they
[1:18:51] begin to act out something that had been
[1:18:53] written hundreds of years before
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; so that one could stand amongst them and
[1:18:59] say, "This is that word."
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; What you're seeing,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; not only what you're hearing, but what
[1:19:06] you're seeing is Joel 2. This is that
[1:19:10] which was spoken by Joel the prophet.
[1:19:13] And he says and in the 33rd verse of the
[1:19:16] same chapter, Acts two, therefore being
[1:19:20] at the right hand of God exalted and
[1:19:22] having received of the father the
[1:19:25] promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath sent
[1:19:28] forth this which you now see and hear.
[1:19:33] Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Not just what you hear, but what you see
[1:19:38] and hear. What you're seeing, Peter is
[1:19:42] saying, what you're seeing is Acts Joel
[1:19:45] 2.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's what you're seeing and you're
[1:19:48] also hearing it. We don't want to come
[1:19:50] to a place in the message where we just
[1:19:52] hear, hear, here, here, and here. We
[1:19:55] must realize what we're hearing. It's
[1:19:57] not what the world only the world
[1:19:59] doesn't only want to hear what we're
[1:20:01] saying. They want to see it.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; They want to be able to say, "This is
[1:20:06] that which has been spoken by Malachi.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Malachi prophesied and I'm living it."
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Malachi said, "The hearts of the
[1:20:16] children would be turned to the fathers
[1:20:18] and you are seeing it. You are viewing
[1:20:20] it." That's what's happened.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going?
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; You are now seeing the word of God
[1:20:30] promised. That's what Peter is saying.
[1:20:32] You're now seeing what God promised
[1:20:35] through the prophet Joel. You are seeing
[1:20:37] it. This is that
[1:20:41] the life that I now live in the flesh.
[1:20:46] I'll suggest to you and you could you
[1:20:49] should put this down. The life that I
[1:20:52] now live in the flesh is the word
[1:20:57] promised for this day.
[1:21:02] We don't want to live history.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; We want to live the word that is
[1:21:07] promised for this day. And the Bible
[1:21:10] says their sound went into all the
[1:21:13] earth. Romans 10 and 18. But I say, have
[1:21:17] they not heard? Yes, verily their sound
[1:21:22] went into all the earth. Not merely
[1:21:24] their words, not merely their voice, but
[1:21:27] their sound, their very life.
[1:21:31] Most of you here have never stood behind
[1:21:32] a pulpit to preach. You might think,
[1:21:35] "Oh, I had a wonderful opportunity to
[1:21:37] give a witness. I had a chance and I
[1:21:39] spoke. I was able to witness." Ah, but I
[1:21:42] want to say to you, you're speaking
[1:21:44] every day.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; You are speaking every day.
[1:21:50] And the prophet has said that our
[1:21:52] thoughts and our actions,
[1:21:55] our thoughts actually speak louder in
[1:21:57] heaven than our words do on earth. The
[1:22:01] sound, it says, "But their sound went
[1:22:04] into all the earth and their words unto
[1:22:08] the ends of the world."
[1:22:14] Their sound
[1:22:19] I found it very very interesting. I
[1:22:21] don't know if I can convey it to you
[1:22:23] because I don't know if you could re
[1:22:24] remember from last Sunday but I spoke on
[1:22:27] light
[1:22:29] that you you are light and that the
[1:22:32] manifested word is light. Now if you can
[1:22:34] just hold that he said that when God
[1:22:37] said let there be light said if light
[1:22:40] didn't come then it wasn't God's word.
[1:22:42] If a fog came then it wasn't God's word.
[1:22:45] When God said, "Let there be light,"
[1:22:47] might have been millions of years. I
[1:22:49] don't know. But if God said it, then
[1:22:51] it's going to happen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen exactly like that.
[1:22:55] And when light came, that light was the
[1:22:58] word of God made manifest.
[1:23:01] So God said, "I'll send Elijah
[1:23:06] the prophet, and he'll turn the hearts
[1:23:09] of the fathers to the children and the
[1:23:12] hearts of the children to the fathers."
[1:23:15] Now, that was time locked. That was
[1:23:17] that's all done. That's finished. That's
[1:23:20] concluded. Why? Because God said it.
[1:23:23] Now, if it never happened, then God
[1:23:25] didn't say it. But if God said it, has
[1:23:28] to happen exactly like that.
[1:23:33] And so I'd like to just tie that back to
[1:23:36] the prophet standing here saying now
[1:23:39] he's showing even the sign. What what
[1:23:41] was the sign for? The sign was to catch
[1:23:44] the attention of the people.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; And some of them their hearts got turned
[1:23:49] back to the faith of the fathers. Some
[1:23:52] did not. Most did not. But some did
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; and some never saw it, but they heard
[1:23:58] about it. Some heard it perhaps on a
[1:24:00] tape or they read about it or they had a
[1:24:02] witness about it and it spoke to
[1:24:04] something in their heart.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; They didn't even know the scripture, but
[1:24:08] right away a change, a transformation
[1:24:10] began to take place. What is it? It was
[1:24:13] the power of that word now anchoring in
[1:24:16] their own heart and changing them,
[1:24:19] transforming them.
[1:24:22] It is that scripture that's happening.
[1:24:25] It's Malachi that's happening. That's
[1:24:27] just one scripture. I want to come to
[1:24:29] some more after a little bit. And and if
[1:24:32] you went into the
[1:24:34] even this phrase and their sound, their
[1:24:38] sound comes the word sound comes from uh
[1:24:43] a first root word which is to speak
[1:24:46] and that word comes from another root
[1:24:49] word which is the same as light and
[1:24:52] eventually ends up at foss which is
[1:24:54] light. Arise and shine for your light
[1:24:57] has come. The light, the word light and
[1:25:01] the word sound
[1:25:04] all have come down down to the same root
[1:25:06] words. Exactly. Why? Because God in
[1:25:11] God's understanding and in the Bible's
[1:25:13] understanding to speak brings light.
[1:25:17] To speak brings knowledge.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; To speak brings understanding. and
[1:25:22] understanding and knowledge of the truth
[1:25:25] is light. So it's the same thing exactly
[1:25:28] whether it's light or whether it's
[1:25:30] voice, God has the same intention. It's
[1:25:33] to bring light.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Now not only geographically to the ends
[1:25:42] of the world,
[1:25:45] it says
[1:25:47] the Bible says, "But have they not
[1:25:50] heard? Yes, verily their sound went into
[1:25:53] all the earth and their words unto the
[1:25:56] end of the world. And the end of the
[1:25:59] world is not just geographically
[1:26:02] extending through time. Not just
[1:26:05] geographically,
[1:26:06] but it is also extending through time.
[1:26:09] Their sound went to the ends of the
[1:26:12] earth. They're sound. I don't know what
[1:26:16] how God or what God will uh determine
[1:26:20] will be the terminating point in time. I
[1:26:24] don't think that God is locked into the
[1:26:27] Roman calendar. It's a Roman calendar
[1:26:29] that you have. And brother Brandham
[1:26:31] talks about a number of different
[1:26:32] calendars. He there's an astronomical,
[1:26:35] you know, uh a calendar. There's a old
[1:26:39] uh there's scientific calendar. He said
[1:26:41] that Israel is God's time piece. And I
[1:26:46] maybe we'll touch on it a wee bit
[1:26:48] tomorrow night. We're not going to
[1:26:49] preach tomorrow night, but just I would
[1:26:52] like to throw a couple of things in. I
[1:26:54] think I found it really quite
[1:26:57] significant
[1:26:59] that just in the last few days,
[1:27:02] Russia
[1:27:05] released an intercontinental ballistic
[1:27:08] missile.
[1:27:10] Now, this was a nation that just a few
[1:27:12] years ago didn't have enough fuel to put
[1:27:16] in an airplane. They were so bankrupt
[1:27:19] they didn't have a fuel to put in an
[1:27:21] airplane to fly their men who work in
[1:27:25] the oil fields up to the oil fields.
[1:27:29] I mean, they were brought to nothing.
[1:27:33] But during that time, out came the Jews.
[1:27:37] So they had an accident
[1:27:40] and almost a million Jews left the
[1:27:44] Soviet Union
[1:27:46] and arrived back in Israel in a
[1:27:49] prophet's words which is God's word
[1:27:51] saying they have the elect have to be
[1:27:54] back there.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; That's God's word.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And once it once it's spoken nations
[1:28:02] there's no such a thing as a superpower
[1:28:04] with God. God's the superpower
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; and he can take a superpower and cause
[1:28:09] it to collapse within itself.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; And the Soviet Union imploded upon
[1:28:14] itself till the whole world was shot.
[1:28:16] And how did it happen? Well, it happened
[1:28:19] because God said that these people have
[1:28:21] to come out and they were refusing them
[1:28:24] to have exit permits to to leave the
[1:28:27] country and bleeding them of all of
[1:28:29] their money as well and having to pay to
[1:28:33] leave the country. That's God's word.
[1:28:35] You understand what I'm saying? We see
[1:28:36] things happening, but God is behind the
[1:28:39] scenes directing things. He lets nations
[1:28:42] rise and he lets them collapse. He let
[1:28:44] kingdoms rise. He lets them collapse.
[1:28:46] God's in control.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:28:51] But now and I find it very amazing and I
[1:28:55] want to say to you in all
[1:28:58] sincerity and you want to think about
[1:29:00] this very very deeply. How does a man
[1:29:04] that was so in tune with the events and
[1:29:08] could preach the 1100 and some messages
[1:29:10] that brother Brandon preached. How does
[1:29:12] a man live the most of his life
[1:29:16] when the superpowers between America and
[1:29:20] the Soviet Union, which was the USSR,
[1:29:24] it was known as the Soviet Union. It was
[1:29:27] called the Soviet Union. The map said
[1:29:31] USSR, the Soviet Union. Brother
[1:29:33] Brandham, to my knowledge, never used
[1:29:36] the words Soviet Union once.
[1:29:43] said Russia.
[1:29:46] Said Russia.
[1:29:48] Listen folks,
[1:29:50] why was that?
[1:29:52] Because in the mind of God, it was
[1:29:54] Russia. And now the Soviet Union
[1:29:57] collapsed. But what's rising out of the
[1:29:59] ruins, the phoenix, is Russia.
[1:30:04] God knew that oil, which was $15 a
[1:30:09] barrel, would almost be a hundred.
[1:30:13] And God knew that once the Soviet Union
[1:30:17] had collapsed, I'm not speaking
[1:30:18] politics, but you understand these
[1:30:20] things are involved in what we know and
[1:30:24] what our messenger spoke of. Are you
[1:30:26] following me?
[1:30:28] And now from their vast oil revenues,
[1:30:31] they're able and they they have a a very
[1:30:35] very cunning leader in Mr. Putin. I
[1:30:38] don't say that negative way. He's a very
[1:30:41] intelligent man, man trained up under
[1:30:44] their security system, the KBG.
[1:30:47] And and now they're pouring these
[1:30:50] revenues into new weapons. And this
[1:30:54] missile they just released the other
[1:30:56] day, just a few days ago, had multiple
[1:30:59] warheads. And they sent it 4,300 and
[1:31:03] some miles and release those warheads to
[1:31:06] different locations. And the news report
[1:31:09] is that everyone hit their site.
[1:31:14] Multiple warheads, which we say that's
[1:31:17] other cities.
[1:31:19] That's what the multiple warheads is all
[1:31:22] about. other cities may be hundreds of
[1:31:25] miles apart, but every one of those
[1:31:27] words, what is he saying? He's saying to
[1:31:29] the world and that nation is saying to
[1:31:31] the world, they didn't have to broadcast
[1:31:33] it. But when you see that the time has
[1:31:36] arrived, the life that we now live,
[1:31:38] we're living in a time when nations are
[1:31:41] are on the edge. are walking on
[1:31:43] eggshells
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; and are trying to manipulate and their
[1:31:48] friendship and their their ties and
[1:31:50] their military strengths and test the
[1:31:53] strengths of others and so on. And now
[1:31:55] the day that we live in now, we're
[1:31:57] living in a time that that not very many
[1:32:00] years ago in our lifetime, perhaps in my
[1:32:02] lifetime, lifetime of others here, we
[1:32:04] never had that kind of a threat.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; But today we have a global threat.
[1:32:11] Brother Brandham talks about a fanatic
[1:32:15] rising.
[1:32:18] Says all it takes is one fanatic to pull
[1:32:21] the trigger.
[1:32:25] He's talking about a consolidation of
[1:32:28] power and and destruction to be in the
[1:32:32] hands of a fanatic. Says only take one
[1:32:36] fanatic to pull the trigger.
[1:32:43] I thought also
[1:32:46] you've no doubt heard the news and been
[1:32:48] staying ab breast with a lot of these
[1:32:49] things
[1:32:51] but the assassination of
[1:32:55] Miss
[1:32:56] Bhau in Pakistan
[1:33:00] uh in last week
[1:33:03] this last week and we have a letter from
[1:33:07] brother Anoir in Pakistan man and he
[1:33:10] said that what you're hearing in the
[1:33:13] news isn't even near what is taking
[1:33:16] place. Said we they're having riots
[1:33:21] in every city the major cities and the
[1:33:25] country is very very unsettled
[1:33:28] but but beyond that
[1:33:31] I hope you can follow me and I hope you
[1:33:33] have a little time.
[1:33:36] Pakistan is the only Muslim nation on
[1:33:39] earth that has a nuclear stockpile.
[1:33:47] 165 million people, the only Muslim
[1:33:51] country.
[1:33:53] And I just thought that I would just
[1:33:55] seek and see what Pakistan's real belief
[1:33:59] concerning Israel was.
[1:34:02] and Pakistan back as far as uh uh way
[1:34:06] back when they when Britain through the
[1:34:09] Belfar Belffor declaration was
[1:34:13] controlling p Palestine
[1:34:16] and they resisted from the very
[1:34:18] beginning a Jewish state and their
[1:34:22] belief is that and they've declared it
[1:34:24] their belief is from way back there.
[1:34:27] belief is that Palestine
[1:34:30] to be not to be under if it's not under
[1:34:33] Muslim control, it's like it's a
[1:34:37] absolute unbelievable thing. It must be
[1:34:39] under Muslim control because those are
[1:34:41] the holy sites of the Muslim nation. And
[1:34:44] now,
[1:34:46] isn't this unusual? Now, we have America
[1:34:49] and the Western world and the European.
[1:34:52] And I never intended to get into this
[1:34:54] this as much as I was saving some for
[1:34:56] tomorrow night, but I'll just unload it
[1:34:58] now. And now we have uh
[1:35:02] we have America, which is the
[1:35:05] forerunner, the vanguard for freedom in
[1:35:09] the world, putting forward that
[1:35:12] democracy is the way. And Miss BH was in
[1:35:15] the elections in a few days on the 8th
[1:35:18] looked like she would be the winner in
[1:35:21] the election. and be the prime minister
[1:35:23] of the president of the nation. And
[1:35:25] America in the western world was very
[1:35:27] very happy because she stood for
[1:35:29] democracy. Democracy is almost like a
[1:35:32] god.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; The the freedom of the people. Well, you
[1:35:36] know, America put a tremendous amount of
[1:35:40] pressure on Israel
[1:35:42] and upon the Palestinian people
[1:35:46] to have which are Islamic to have a
[1:35:50] freedom of vote. If you just have a
[1:35:53] vote, then be free. You'll be like us
[1:35:55] and you'll vote in who you want as a
[1:35:58] leader. And they had a vote. They had a
[1:36:01] democratic process and they voted in the
[1:36:04] terrorists.
[1:36:09] Are you getting the picture?
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And now we've got a a Muslim nation with
[1:36:16] nuclear weapons,
[1:36:19] with fanatics
[1:36:21] that care nothing about destroying
[1:36:23] themselves. If they care nothing about
[1:36:25] destroying themselves, I guarantee you
[1:36:27] they care nothing about destroying you.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Or they care nothing about destroying
[1:36:32] Christians. or they care nothing about
[1:36:34] destroying America or they'd be
[1:36:36] delighted
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; if they had that power.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; They've demonstrated that and they've
[1:36:44] killed tens of thousands
[1:36:46] of Jewish people
[1:36:49] and of others.
[1:36:52] And they may say, well, it's not a
[1:36:54] violent people. Well, it is strange that
[1:36:57] most of the violence that has been
[1:36:59] taking place has come from those
[1:37:01] quarters.
[1:37:02] Did brother Brandham see this? I believe
[1:37:05] that he did.
[1:37:07] And he says, uh, it only takes one
[1:37:10] fanatic.
[1:37:11] And one of the concerns right now as you
[1:37:14] and I are seated here is,
[1:37:17] will there be
[1:37:19] will extremists actually win in the
[1:37:23] democratic process? Will they actually
[1:37:26] win? And then with and you could find
[1:37:29] out friends before the next 30 days is
[1:37:32] over you could find that there's a
[1:37:34] nuclear power in the world in the hands
[1:37:38] of the very terrorists they're trying to
[1:37:40] control at the border
[1:37:45] the life that I now live.
[1:37:48] We wouldn't say this maybe five years
[1:37:50] ago or 10 years ago when you young
[1:37:53] people were children. Maybe this wasn't
[1:37:54] a concern. Perhaps brother Biscll may be
[1:37:57] over the edge. I don't think so. I think
[1:37:59] probably we don't even see everything
[1:38:01] that's going on.
[1:38:04] We live in a serious time now. That's on
[1:38:07] the world scene. Now, if that's
[1:38:10] happening on the world scene and such
[1:38:11] dramatic things are happening on the
[1:38:13] world scene, what do you think God is
[1:38:16] doing on the spiritual scene? You think
[1:38:18] he's just raising up the believers of
[1:38:20] this message to be a church here and a
[1:38:22] church over there and another church
[1:38:24] there? That's not what he's raising up.
[1:38:26] He's not raising up just a people that's
[1:38:28] got another doctrine. The world's full
[1:38:30] of doctrines. He's raising up a people
[1:38:33] to fulfill the written word of God.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And there is a scripture written
[1:38:39] concerning this hour,
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; concerning this time, 207. If it wasn't
[1:38:44] a scripture here, we're here in vain.
[1:38:46] We're here wasting our lives. I say go
[1:38:49] out and eat, drink, and be merry for
[1:38:51] tomorrow we die. But that's not the
[1:38:54] case.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a word for this
[1:38:57] season. And the prophet of God said he
[1:39:00] he gave out a word for every season, for
[1:39:02] every time. He allotted so much for that
[1:39:06] time, for that day, and for this day.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God has a word for 207.
[1:39:12] God has a word for 208. And God has a
[1:39:15] people that's living it out. You may
[1:39:17] never preach a message, but your very
[1:39:19] life will give a sound. There's a sound
[1:39:22] emanating out from you.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; I've I have quite a few quotes I'm
[1:39:29] coming too. Now I've come to the nub of
[1:39:32] my message. You know, God uses strange
[1:39:34] things to anchor something. And I
[1:39:37] thought, how will I get to the people
[1:39:39] that even though they be silent, yet
[1:39:41] there is a sound that emanates out from
[1:39:43] them?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; God uses strange things I had to have. I
[1:39:48] didn't have to have but I the doctor
[1:39:50] suggested that I have a certain medical
[1:39:54] procedure says you'll have to go to the
[1:39:56] hospital okay fine so I go to the
[1:39:59] hospital and it's nuclear medicine
[1:40:03] and uh
[1:40:05] have sister Sheila she works in that
[1:40:07] department I was
[1:40:10] the sorry hospital so I'm sitting there
[1:40:13] there's a sign on the wall that says uh
[1:40:17] if you intend to cross the border,
[1:40:20] you get a letter from the hospital.
[1:40:23] So, uh when I went in the other day,
[1:40:25] because it was a two two-stage process,
[1:40:29] and uh I I don't know I've never had
[1:40:31] this kind of thing before. So, I go up
[1:40:32] to the desk and I said, "Oh, by the way,
[1:40:34] before you start this, I've got to go
[1:40:36] across the border and be with brother
[1:40:37] Chris in uh uh in just a little while."
[1:40:41] So, as soon as I'm out of here, I'm
[1:40:43] going across the border. Oh, they said,
[1:40:45] "Okay." They opened a file and pulled
[1:40:46] out a letter and stamped it and wrote my
[1:40:49] name on it and and signed it and all the
[1:40:51] rest says, "You'll need this." They put
[1:40:52] an envelope here. Just carry this with
[1:40:54] you. Fine.
[1:40:57] So, I'm laying there. They take you in
[1:40:59] for the procedure.
[1:41:01] Brother Chris told me, he says, he says,
[1:41:03] "You're going to light up like a light
[1:41:05] bulb." I said, "I am?" Yeah. He says,
[1:41:07] "You have guards running all around your
[1:41:09] car at the border."
[1:41:11] What? Oh, yeah. guy says they picked
[1:41:14] that up because they're going to put
[1:41:15] they're going to put you know radiation
[1:41:17] in you. You're it's going to you know
[1:41:20] they're they'll be around. Well, how
[1:41:22] will they even know? So, I'm thinking
[1:41:24] about this and I'm laying there and the
[1:41:26] nurse comes over and sticks that IV says
[1:41:29] this is just going to prick your hand
[1:41:30] here and put an IV. Sure, fine. Go
[1:41:32] ahead. So, she picks it in and this IV
[1:41:35] and it's dripping and I'm just watching
[1:41:38] this drip drip drip drip. thought,
[1:41:42] "Isn't this incredible?" It's just
[1:41:44] silent. I can't even hear it. Just
[1:41:47] dripping coming right down that tube
[1:41:50] into my bloodstream going right into my
[1:41:52] heart. And this is going to make a
[1:41:55] sound.
[1:41:57] This is actually going to make a sound.
[1:41:59] A total silent thing. This whole process
[1:42:02] totally silent. And I just laid there
[1:42:04] and I thought, "That's the promises of
[1:42:06] God. God dropped those promises into my
[1:42:09] bloodstream a long time ago. And I just
[1:42:12] watched and I started getting blessed.
[1:42:14] Those drips going on. Promise after
[1:42:16] promise. I started thinking about the
[1:42:17] promises going right into my
[1:42:19] bloodstream. Yep. Went right to my
[1:42:21] heart. Glory to God. Changed my heart. I
[1:42:24] could hardly keep that IV in. I was
[1:42:25] getting so blessed. Thought, "Yes." And
[1:42:27] I get up out of here after the promises
[1:42:29] of God come in, strike my heart, and my
[1:42:32] life just starts sounding out.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; They And they don't know what it is.
[1:42:36] They don't know where it came from, but
[1:42:38] it sure making a definite sound. And I
[1:42:40] was getting blessed laying there. Sure
[1:42:42] enough, I went to the border, drove my
[1:42:45] car up, and I saw him take a special
[1:42:48] pad, and he starts writing on this pad.
[1:42:51] I said, "Oh, just excuse me." I said, "I
[1:42:52] have a letter from the hospital, and uh
[1:42:55] I just had a nuclear medicine test this
[1:42:58] morning." Yeah. Yeah. He said, "It's
[1:42:59] beeping here." Said, "It is?" "Yeah, you
[1:43:02] have to go in." So I was in there for an
[1:43:05] hour.
[1:43:07] Then they put you to a put a little
[1:43:10] machine out. He said, "You go and stand
[1:43:13] over there. Just stand there and I'm
[1:43:15] going to put this machine right here."
[1:43:17] They put that machine. He went and got
[1:43:19] his little clicker, clicked it. Yeah. He
[1:43:22] says, "There it is." And uh I said, "So
[1:43:27] that and it's beeping. Beep beep beep."
[1:43:30] He said, "Now come out to the counter."
[1:43:32] and he brings that machine out and
[1:43:34] points it at me and I'm standing right
[1:43:35] there. I'm not saying a word. That
[1:43:39] machine is telling him, he says, "I can
[1:43:41] even tell you what type of radiation
[1:43:44] this is." Says, "There's two kinds. You
[1:43:46] have two kinds."
[1:43:48] And and he he's writing down, he's
[1:43:50] entering it all in. And I I'm probably
[1:43:53] logged in that computer that Edward
[1:43:56] Biscoll passport number, license number,
[1:43:58] this that. No. They got everything on
[1:44:00] you. There's no secrets anymore. Came
[1:44:02] across the border and who knows what on
[1:44:04] the date and this kind of radiation and
[1:44:06] this kind of radiation and and we're
[1:44:08] marked.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I thought I tell you I was marked long
[1:44:12] before they got me.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Something got pumped into my veins,
[1:44:17] pumped down into my heart and the
[1:44:19] promises of God silently, silently
[1:44:22] coming in.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, if science
[1:44:26] can do that, I tell you, God has gone
[1:44:28] way beyond science. Hallelujah. We've
[1:44:32] been infected
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And I thought of you, Brother Chris. I'm
[1:44:39] going to come up there and just let you
[1:44:40] put the IV in me. Well, that took on a
[1:44:42] whole new meaning to me. I hope you're
[1:44:45] still hooked up. Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that all right?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; So, something silent actually gave a
[1:44:54] sound.
[1:44:56] I couldn't believe it. The thing's
[1:44:58] actually screaming in there and the
[1:45:00] stuff that's inside of me just came in
[1:45:02] silently in my whole body. I thought,
[1:45:06] "Oh my, God's dropped the promises." The
[1:45:09] people of God, that's what we're doing
[1:45:11] here tonight, this morning rather. We're
[1:45:13] just hearing the word of God coming into
[1:45:16] your heart. Perhaps just a silent
[1:45:18] movement of God by the Holy Spirit, but
[1:45:21] it's reaching the heart. It's reaching
[1:45:23] the part it's intended to reach and it
[1:45:25] gives a beep. I believe the devil hears
[1:45:28] it.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan hears it.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; And and and and demons of hell are
[1:45:34] trembling.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; If a prophet of God could come from the
[1:45:39] back room, and he told me this with his
[1:45:41] own lips, and while the angel of the
[1:45:43] Lord is speaking to him back there is
[1:45:45] telling him, when you come to the
[1:45:46] pulpit, there'll be a woman up on the
[1:45:48] right hand balcony in a yellow coat.
[1:45:50] Hope there's no one there with the
[1:45:51] yellow coats. I'm not even looking. And
[1:45:53] he says, "And the demon that's in her is
[1:45:55] going to tie together. It's going to
[1:45:58] call out to a man sitting down in the
[1:46:00] middle section. And those two are going
[1:46:02] to come against you. You're going to war
[1:46:04] against you. Have no fear. I'll be
[1:46:07] there."
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; My friends, the spiritual realm, we know
[1:46:14] so little. Let's not get bogged down
[1:46:16] with this little life that we're in and
[1:46:18] the little details of this life. There's
[1:46:20] another whole world just a breath away.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the word that you have
[1:46:26] received is screaming out.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this. When he
[1:46:30] gets on the other side, he wants to hear
[1:46:33] his voice.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; And when I get on the other side, when
[1:46:37] you get on the other side, you want to
[1:46:39] hear your voice calling out.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to say a lot of things.
[1:46:43] Say, "Yay, Lord. I believe that.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I believe what I'm hearing.
[1:46:49] I believe this testimony.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Our life is the word of God for this day
[1:46:59] being fulfilled. And now here's some
[1:47:01] quotes. Please listen closely in a
[1:47:03] message. Why little bethlehem? He says,
[1:47:06] "Oh God, anoint us," this is in prayer,
[1:47:08] "with thy word and bring thy word
[1:47:11] promised of this day to pass. bring thy
[1:47:15] word promised for this day to pass. And
[1:47:19] may we leave this building this morning
[1:47:20] as shining instruments of God. May we go
[1:47:23] to the go with the sword, it glittering
[1:47:26] in the air to cut away every weight and
[1:47:29] everything else till we can get back to
[1:47:31] the people of Christ and bring a cool
[1:47:33] fresh drink to our Lord. In the third
[1:47:36] seal, he said they miss him, the living
[1:47:39] word manifested in the flesh by the word
[1:47:42] that is promised. The word promised to
[1:47:45] do these things and they miss it. They
[1:47:49] don't know what it is. Even like the
[1:47:51] guards, they didn't know what it was.
[1:47:52] They only knew that they only knew that
[1:47:55] it was something they needed to check
[1:47:57] out.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; The world doesn't know. They hear the
[1:48:01] sound of your life. If you just took the
[1:48:05] believers around the world of this
[1:48:07] message, it's a different sound.
[1:48:12] It's not a denominational sound.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; It's not a Pentecostal sound. It's not a
[1:48:17] Baptist sound. And even when they just
[1:48:20] see and view the believers, you haven't
[1:48:23] said a word yet, but they know it's a
[1:48:27] different sound.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Hasn't that been your experience?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; You want to thank God for that.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; It isn't just your appearance, but it's
[1:48:38] your manner. It's your department. It's
[1:48:40] how you handle yourself and how perhaps
[1:48:43] just just your conduct they say this is
[1:48:47] different.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; This is different.
[1:48:55] I think of a little testimony during the
[1:48:58] witness 2000
[1:49:01] conference and they found a man over
[1:49:03] here. Many of you people saw those huge
[1:49:05] sandwiches that they made and they
[1:49:07] handed out to all the ministers so
[1:49:08] they'd have something to eat at night
[1:49:09] because we were out too let out the
[1:49:11] service too late for them to get
[1:49:13] something in a restaurant. So they
[1:49:14] handed out these sandwiches and there's
[1:49:16] a person up here uh brother Tom knows
[1:49:18] all about it. And uh who who went with
[1:49:20] you, brother Tom?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Brother John Andy's. Okay.
[1:49:25] And uh so he heard all about it. He made
[1:49:27] marvelous marvelous sandwiches. turned
[1:49:29] out the man is a foul-mouthed man and
[1:49:32] loud and and forward and he just doesn't
[1:49:37] care for anything or anybody. And Sister
[1:49:39] Karen Ashdown went down and he walked
[1:49:44] in. She walked in. He's got people in
[1:49:47] there and he prides himself in being
[1:49:50] crude and just cra, you know,
[1:49:55] a very ungodly man.
[1:49:58] And Sister Karen Ashdon walks in. He
[1:50:02] says, "Ho ho.
[1:50:07] Here's a lady.
[1:50:10] This is different."
[1:50:12] And sometime later, here come brother
[1:50:14] John Andes and Brother Tom in because
[1:50:15] they had to make some arrangements for
[1:50:17] it. And when they walk in, now he's had
[1:50:20] all kinds of people. He goes on with his
[1:50:21] cursing and whatever more. And here
[1:50:23] comes in two other brothers from the
[1:50:26] same from the same origin.
[1:50:30] He says, "You must be connected with
[1:50:31] that lady that was here."
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; That was the first time in his life.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; I've been to a restaurant just down over
[1:50:41] the hill here and had a waitress say to
[1:50:43] me, "Are you connected to those young
[1:50:46] ladies that come in here with the real
[1:50:47] long hair?" I said, "I sure am." She
[1:50:50] said, "I thought so."
[1:50:52] I said, "You want to just come up and
[1:50:53] see where we're at? You want to come up
[1:50:55] and see where we worship? Where is it
[1:50:57] at? Maybe she's come here already. I
[1:50:59] don't know. There's a sound."
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Hear the joyful sound.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word has been fulfilled
[1:51:07] and is being fulfilled. That's my
[1:51:10] announcement to you. That's why you're
[1:51:11] here.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; You're not here to be a carpenter or a
[1:51:14] plumber or something else. You're here
[1:51:16] because the word of God is being
[1:51:18] fulfilled in you. might say, "Well, I
[1:51:21] never do anything. I never say anything.
[1:51:22] I never sing." That has nothing to do
[1:51:24] with it. Your life is sounding it out.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; You've got it in your veins.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Royal seed.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; And the seed is not air with a shot. He
[1:51:36] said,
[1:51:38] "How that this great mystery of God
[1:51:40] being made known understand how that God
[1:51:43] was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:51:46] uh reconciling the world. How that he
[1:51:48] and the father are one. How that the
[1:51:51] great mysteries of the fulfilling the
[1:51:53] mysteries the way perhaps the reason you
[1:51:56] don't understand everything because he's
[1:51:59] he referred to it as the mysteries of
[1:52:03] God. The mysteries of the fulfilling of
[1:52:06] God taking and bringing himself
[1:52:10] manifested in the age of human beings
[1:52:13] and in the strain of human beings and in
[1:52:16] the company of human beings. Hallelujah.
[1:52:19] In the strain of human beings. In the
[1:52:22] company of human beings. The great
[1:52:23] mystery of God unfolding making himself
[1:52:26] known and revealing himself and
[1:52:29] manifesting himself.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Now friends, I'm away from being done.
[1:52:32] So you just hang on, will you?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Manifesting himself.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "What if it wasn't
[1:52:39] manifested?"
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; What if it wasn't manifested? You know,
[1:52:44] God can say it, but if it's not
[1:52:46] manifested, what use is it?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; So God's concern, God's interest is is
[1:52:54] unbelievably important and it's the
[1:52:58] importance is placed upon it being
[1:53:00] manifested.
[1:53:03] What good would it be if a man came out
[1:53:06] on the platform before tens of thousands
[1:53:09] of people said the time for Malachi 4 to
[1:53:14] be fulfilled has come out and the time
[1:53:16] of the revealing of the son of man Luke
[1:53:19] 17:30 the hour has come and it all fell
[1:53:23] right there
[1:53:25] it was announced it was verbal words the
[1:53:28] the hour has come the time has come. But
[1:53:31] nothing happened. What good would it be?
[1:53:35] Where where's that going to go? But then
[1:53:38] you have that word begin to be
[1:53:43] manifested.
[1:53:44] And once it's manifested,
[1:53:47] once it's displayed, the people can look
[1:53:50] at it. They may not change, but they can
[1:53:52] look at it. And then they're faced with
[1:53:55] believe it or disbelieve it.
[1:53:58] become a believer or remain an
[1:53:59] unbeliever.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Once it's manifested,
[1:54:06] so the manifestation, and I have the
[1:54:08] quotes here now. I'm just saying this
[1:54:10] ahead of time so you'll catch it while
[1:54:11] we read it. You are, it's not me making
[1:54:14] you feel good. You are the manifestation
[1:54:17] of the word for this hour.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go, you don't have to
[1:54:22] go out and say, "I believe Malachi 4. I
[1:54:25] believe a manifestation of the promise
[1:54:27] of this hour. You don't even have to say
[1:54:29] that. I'm telling you your life like the
[1:54:33] isotopes in my veins. You've got more
[1:54:35] than isotopes in your veins. You've got
[1:54:38] a faith
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; in your heart that has made a word
[1:54:42] become active in your life.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And it lives it out.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; It's a life that's lived.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; It's not just a life that's confessed.
[1:54:52] Your confession is is is good and your
[1:54:55] confession but your confession in the
[1:54:57] life must match.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'll say amen to my own
[1:55:03] message.
[1:55:06] So the the mystery of the fulfilling in
[1:55:09] the strain of human beings and in the
[1:55:11] company of human beings. And this is why
[1:55:15] he said, "Bringing himself manifested in
[1:55:18] the age of human beings, in the company
[1:55:21] of human beings, and in the strain of
[1:55:24] human beings to make
[1:55:27] his word manifested in this day, in the
[1:55:31] eastern rising of the sun, and to do the
[1:55:35] same thing
[1:55:37] as the sun sets in the west, to make
[1:55:41] himself manifested said, "In a bride
[1:55:44] church, the word made manifested."
[1:55:50] And it shall come to pass,
[1:55:54] said Zachchariah, probably not knowing
[1:55:56] what he was speaking. It shall come to
[1:55:58] pass.
[1:56:01] It shall be one day which shall be known
[1:56:03] to the Lord. Not day, not night, but it
[1:56:08] shall come to pass that in the evening
[1:56:10] time,
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; it shall be light.
[1:56:14] And I was saying to you that a word
[1:56:18] spoken if you take it root word. A
[1:56:21] spoken word
[1:56:23] in God's vocabulary means light comes.
[1:56:29] God doesn't speak and darkness comes.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; God speaks and light comes.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And what did the prophet say? He said
[1:56:37] that the voice will be in the bride.
[1:56:41] Amen.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; The voice of God,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; whether you say anything, whether you
[1:56:44] never preach a message, the voice of God
[1:56:47] is in you.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's in you. How does it
[1:56:52] come in me? You simply surrender to it.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I simply had to. They said, "Lay there."
[1:56:57] I laid there. Put your arm out. I put my
[1:56:59] arm out. Clench your fist. I clenched my
[1:57:01] fist.
[1:57:03] Said, "Now, this is going to be a little
[1:57:04] prick." Sometimes it's a little prick,
[1:57:06] too.
[1:57:10] Surrender here.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands. Say, "Oh God, be
[1:57:15] merciful to me. Oh God, increase my
[1:57:18] faith. Oh God, I believe your word."
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; And just expect a little prick
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; might come as a little prick. You need
[1:57:28] to do this.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Need to go there. Lay down there. Go
[1:57:33] there. Make that thing right. Just a
[1:57:35] little prick. But then it it starts
[1:57:37] coming in drip drip drip drip. Every
[1:57:40] promise in the book is mine. Every
[1:57:42] chapter, every verse, every line.
[1:57:44] Hallelujah. You're not getting isotopes.
[1:57:46] You're not getting nuclear medicine.
[1:57:48] You're getting heavenly medicine.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; That medicine doesn't only tell people
[1:57:54] where you stand and who you are. And it
[1:57:56] screams out they're believers.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; It's not just how you look. It's not
[1:58:01] just the long hair, the dress or or or
[1:58:03] or how you you know just how you appear.
[1:58:07] It's not that.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; But there's something emanate out from
[1:58:10] you.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it works.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; And in the hour of trial, it really
[1:58:20] works. And when I saw it really work, I
[1:58:23] sat and saw it work is when we were in
[1:58:25] China. That's the first time I actually
[1:58:28] saw it work.
[1:58:30] I saw it with my eyes. I sat on a chair,
[1:58:34] hour after hour after hour with the
[1:58:37] deepest peace.
[1:58:39] There I am. I didn't know that. I didn't
[1:58:42] know if my wife even knew. I didn't know
[1:58:44] where I was going from here. I didn't
[1:58:46] know how long we're going to be here.
[1:58:48] And nothing bothered me. I just sat
[1:58:50] there and police coming in and police
[1:58:53] going out. And they would come in and
[1:58:56] walk around a wee bit back and forth.
[1:58:59] And it just came upon me. The power
[1:59:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ, the power of
[1:59:05] the Holy Ghost is wrenching what these
[1:59:09] men have been indoctrinated in and
[1:59:10] wrenching them down to surrender.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; And I realize greater is he that is in
[1:59:18] me than he that's in this entire nation,
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; in this entire communist government.
[1:59:24] Greater is heal.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than is in
[1:59:31] this uh decrepit,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; pleasure mad
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; nation that we live in. Greater is he
[1:59:39] than this material world. Greater is he
[1:59:42] that's in you.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting to hear it from this
[1:59:46] congregation.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; You ought to thank him for that.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Got to say, I believe that, brother. You
[1:59:53] may not feel it, but you want to say, "I
[1:59:55] believe that." And let it drip in.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Is that God's word? Greater is he that's
[2:00:01] in you. I don't care what their
[2:00:02] circumstances are. I don't care what
[2:00:04] you're going through. I don't care what
[2:00:06] the devil has said to you. Greater is
[2:00:08] this word than what Satan has spoke.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; God raises up men and women of faith.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just hear about the
[2:00:17] gospel. I want to say it.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; This world has a right to say it.
[2:00:23] Hallelujah.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; It shall be light in the evening time.
[2:00:31] Same one who said, "Let there be light
[2:00:33] said there shall be light in the evening
[2:00:34] time." There shall be light in the
[2:00:36] evening time. Is it evening time? We're
[2:00:39] not bringing darkness. We're bringing
[2:00:41] light.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; You I want you to be able to say I want
[2:00:47] you to say it.
[2:00:49] Zachchariah said, "But it shall be light
[2:00:51] in the evening time." And I want you to
[2:00:54] say, "I am that light.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; I am that scripture.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; I am that verse in flesh."
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; And if you can't say that, you need to
[2:01:07] say it so it'll drip in.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You need to surrender to it.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Need to say, "I believe it."
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And it'll drip in.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Lay here. Do that. Say that. Put your
[2:01:18] arm out here. I say reach out and touch
[2:01:22] him. Reach out and believe him. Let the
[2:01:24] word go from the here, from the ear and
[2:01:27] the mind down to the soul.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; My the time slips away on us, doesn't
[2:01:36] it?
[2:01:38] the life that we now live
[2:01:41] and the sound
[2:01:44] and after Revelation
[2:01:47] 10:7
[2:01:53] we don't have any question that has
[2:01:55] happened
[2:01:56] and in the days of the voice of the
[2:01:59] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:02:00] sound we can say oh man I heard it I've
[2:02:03] heard that sound I've heard that message
[2:02:06] oh
[2:02:07] then says John, you take this book and
[2:02:10] you eat it. He says, "And I took the
[2:02:13] little book out of the angel's hand, and
[2:02:16] I ate it up, and it was in my mouth,
[2:02:19] sweet as honey, and as soon as I had
[2:02:22] eaten it, my belly was bitter."
[2:02:27] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[2:02:29] again before many peoples and nations,
[2:02:32] and tongues, and kings."
[2:02:35] You realize we may talk about Pakistan.
[2:02:38] We may talk about nuclear powers. We may
[2:02:39] talk about the Soviet Union, about
[2:02:41] Russia and all the rest of it and these
[2:02:43] superpowers. But let's talk about the
[2:02:44] super church.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; When was there a day when we could
[2:02:48] prophesy from nation around the globe
[2:02:51] until this time
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; and here it is
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; and even this service and your voice on
[2:02:57] this service and your hand raised gone
[2:03:00] in the picture gone into the satellite
[2:03:02] gone around the globe as a testimony.
[2:03:04] There's a people there in Cloverdale
[2:03:06] that believes this word of God.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; You think it does not affect you young
[2:03:13] people, you may not even say a word.
[2:03:15] Say, "Okay, the uh the choir is going to
[2:03:18] get up and sing the junior choir,
[2:03:19] whatever more." Sometime I don't even
[2:03:21] hear the words. My hearing is not that
[2:03:24] great. But I see what I see is a group
[2:03:27] maybe 50, 60, 70 standing here and
[2:03:30] there's a sound. say, "Where do you find
[2:03:32] these kind of young people?"
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Individually, you might say, "Well, I've
[2:03:38] got my problem. I've got my weaknesses.
[2:03:40] I've got my temptations." Greater is he
[2:03:43] that's being pumped into you. Greater is
[2:03:45] he that's being dripped into you than
[2:03:47] anything that the world can do.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; All you have to do so when the world
[2:03:51] says, "Give me your arm." You say, "Not
[2:03:53] a chance.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Give me your hand of fellowship." Not a
[2:03:56] chance.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking, if you have to
[2:04:02] clench your fist, use it for a good
[2:04:04] purpose.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Give the devil a one, two, three.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you folks are enjoying
[2:04:13] this, but I'm enjoying it.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; You must prophesy again. And brother
[2:04:23] Brando says about this bitter in the
[2:04:25] belly. I thought about that when he said
[2:04:28] it's when it's being digested.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; You hear it?
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; When it's being digested,
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; you got to take this message and digest
[2:04:38] it.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; And he says in in this and he said in
[2:04:41] this sevenfold book of seven redemption
[2:04:45] plans has been brought to us. I
[2:04:49] underlined that has been brought to us.
[2:04:52] You believe this messenger? This book
[2:04:56] has been brought to us.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Now, what do we do with it?
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Has been brought to us. And that's
[2:05:04] what's this book holds. And he says,
[2:05:07] we're going to get it over in the 10th
[2:05:08] chapter where the mighty angel
[2:05:10] proclaimed something. And he had a
[2:05:13] little book that John had to eat. And
[2:05:15] when he did, he got it in his belly and
[2:05:19] it was bitter, but in his lips it was
[2:05:22] sweet. He says, "And when you digest it,
[2:05:24] then it gets bitter. Everybody's against
[2:05:27] you." When you digest it, why? When you
[2:05:29] digest it, gets into your entire system.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Then people begin to see what it is. And
[2:05:35] you and and you've all experienced this.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; You You arrive in a situation and this
[2:05:42] should just be just normal. And suddenly
[2:05:45] you suddenly you can't even understand
[2:05:49] this antagonism. It's
[2:05:52] I got on a plane once, I and my wife in
[2:05:56] another country. We got on the plane and
[2:05:59] sat down. We were in India sat down and
[2:06:02] there was a white girl sitting right in
[2:06:04] front of us
[2:06:06] sitting right against the window and I
[2:06:08] was sitting against the window and she
[2:06:10] started having everything just short of
[2:06:13] convulsions.
[2:06:15] And she was so angry.
[2:06:18] She became so angry just as we sat down
[2:06:21] and she began to, you know, hit at the
[2:06:23] seat and like this and speak out and she
[2:06:26] was just totally totally demonpossessed
[2:06:30] and the spirit in her was waring
[2:06:33] unbelievably and she went on and went on
[2:06:35] and I just knew what it was. What do you
[2:06:38] do at a time like that? Satan, in the
[2:06:41] name of Jesus Christ,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; you might as well settle down because
[2:06:44] I'm not going any place.
[2:06:48] Hallelujah.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; I was in a meeting and there's a young
[2:06:53] native uh Indian young man and they told
[2:06:58] me, "Oh,
[2:07:00] this young man is here. He's sitting in
[2:07:02] a sitting right against the wall
[2:07:04] towards the back of the church and the
[2:07:07] and the brothers gave me a message. This
[2:07:09] young man, he disturbs a meeting because
[2:07:12] he's demonpossessed and they haven't
[2:07:14] been able to do anything with him.
[2:07:18] And it was only a moment or two and he
[2:07:21] broke loose
[2:07:23] and three or four men or maybe more than
[2:07:25] that tried to get control of him. I'm
[2:07:29] sitting on the platform. I've got to
[2:07:31] preach in a few minutes. I've been
[2:07:33] called there to preach and here's this
[2:07:35] taking place and they're trying to
[2:07:37] manhandle him.
[2:07:42] I bowed my head
[2:07:45] and I said something like this. Satan,
[2:07:47] in the name of Jesus Christ, I bind you
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; and you shall not disturb this meeting.
[2:07:54] And they got him back sitting in the in
[2:07:57] the seat and he had a he had a red
[2:07:59] bandana like one of those cowboy
[2:08:00] bandanna handkerchiefs and he had that
[2:08:03] in his hand and he began to twist on
[2:08:05] that. And that's what he did for the
[2:08:07] next hour or so while I preached. He
[2:08:10] just twisted on that thing and that's as
[2:08:12] far as he could get because God was not
[2:08:14] going to have the congregation robbed of
[2:08:17] the preaching of the word and Satan was
[2:08:19] bound. Greater is he that's in you than
[2:08:22] he that's in the world. Greater is he
[2:08:24] than the temptation.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; I don't say those things to give myself
[2:08:28] any credit. I just say those things
[2:08:30] because it's so simple and it's so true.
[2:08:32] You believe it.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to practice it. Amen.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when he did, and then when
[2:08:41] he digested," he said, "Then people, it
[2:08:44] it gets bitter,
[2:08:46] everybody telling you you're a holy
[2:08:47] roller or you're this or you're that or
[2:08:50] you're the other." See, he said, "Or
[2:08:53] they say you're off your head. It's hard
[2:08:55] to digest it." But when you're
[2:08:57] testifying of his glory, it's sweet in
[2:09:00] your lips.
[2:09:02] That's all. Amen.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; What makes it better?
[2:09:09] When you become a believer,
[2:09:12] there's a new consciousness.
[2:09:19] I just look up and say, "Brother Paul,
[2:09:20] Neighbor,
[2:09:22] God bless you, Brother Paul.
[2:09:25] I've read your emails
[2:09:27] and what you've digested and what you've
[2:09:29] gone through recently
[2:09:32] has been because the message gave you a
[2:09:34] new consciousness
[2:09:36] and this congregation doesn't know you
[2:09:38] is asking brother Paul what he's gone
[2:09:40] through but Satan like to drag him
[2:09:45] to very very difficult places
[2:09:50] the world and the system of the world
[2:09:52] because his conscious
[2:09:54] the inner consciousness
[2:09:57] they talk about in these eastern
[2:09:58] religions and I'm not off my subject.
[2:10:00] Listen to me good. They talk about oh
[2:10:03] they look at the heavens and they look
[2:10:05] at the stars and they look at the moon
[2:10:06] and all these things and they get into
[2:10:08] the you know the astronomy and and it
[2:10:12] speaks to you and you tie that together
[2:10:14] with some yoga and some
[2:10:17] some things and you'll you'll get a new
[2:10:19] consciousness.
[2:10:21] Well, you probably will, but it won't be
[2:10:23] a godly consciousness.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; And then you look within yourself. You
[2:10:28] look within yourself, you see a big dark
[2:10:29] pit.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, you look into the
[2:10:32] face and the glory of God. And you look
[2:10:35] into the scriptures. You look into the
[2:10:38] promise of God. You will get a new
[2:10:40] consciousness. And the places you used
[2:10:42] to go, you can't go anymore. And the
[2:10:44] things you used to say, you can't say
[2:10:46] anymore. And the things you used to say,
[2:10:48] it's all right. I'll just go along with
[2:10:49] you. You can't do it anymore.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist had a new consciousness
[2:10:54] and he said to the Herod, "It's not
[2:10:56] lawful for you to have your brother's
[2:10:59] wife." And that cost him his head.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; In the prime of life, it cost him his
[2:11:04] head.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; You and I might have wondered about that
[2:11:07] if it happened here in Cloverdale Bible.
[2:11:09] It says somebody, well, surely he could
[2:11:12] have adjusted a wee bit. Surely could
[2:11:13] have compromised a wee bit. I tell you
[2:11:15] what, it can be can get very, very
[2:11:17] bitter. can cost a person a good job.
[2:11:20] Can because I said I have a
[2:11:21] consciousness. I can't do that.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I've counseledled with brothers sitting
[2:11:27] right here in this church said uh uh I'm
[2:11:29] driving a truck but when I go through
[2:11:32] the when I go through the wave scales
[2:11:33] they want me to lie
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; and I can't do it.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; If you can't lie then you can't have the
[2:11:41] job.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? You have to lie to
[2:11:44] have a job. lie to feed your family. And
[2:11:48] people have said because I got a new
[2:11:49] consciousness, I can't do that.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; I can't go there anymore. And you'll
[2:11:54] find that.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; I was with a group of people from a very
[2:12:07] very
[2:12:10] spiritual place as far as this message
[2:12:13] is concerned.
[2:12:15] I'm kind of letting it all out and I
[2:12:18] hope you don't mind.
[2:12:21] And these people were from a top-notch
[2:12:25] believer's church.
[2:12:28] I said to them,
[2:12:30] "What do you young people do for your
[2:12:32] entertainment?"
[2:12:34] He said, "We go to movies."
[2:12:38] You do? I got saved from that.
[2:12:42] How does the Holy Ghost save me from
[2:12:44] movies and then take other people and
[2:12:46] bring them into the message and that's
[2:12:48] what they have for their entertainment?
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends,
[2:12:57] I've seen enough just on screens and in
[2:12:59] hotel rooms. There isn't a movie in the
[2:13:02] country that comes out of Hollywood
[2:13:04] that's worth looking at.
[2:13:07] They got all kinds of influences and all
[2:13:09] kinds of innuendos and all kinds of
[2:13:12] perverted stuff they're putting across
[2:13:13] to you. And it's not exactly what you
[2:13:15] see, it's what they infer.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; It's how they're educating the people. I
[2:13:19] say to you that have families, see to it
[2:13:21] that your children don't see that stuff.
[2:13:25] I asked a congregation here just a few
[2:13:27] few weeks ago in a in a in a large
[2:13:30] meeting. How many have heard things you
[2:13:32] wished you had never heard? And you've
[2:13:34] seen things you wish you had never seen.
[2:13:37] And I would say it'd be 100% of us here
[2:13:38] today. We saw things and we've heard
[2:13:40] things we'd been better off. We had
[2:13:42] never seen it
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; or never heard it.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I believe a separated life is better for
[2:13:49] you.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; That stuff is poison.
[2:13:53] That's poison.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes. I I I'm sorry.
[2:14:07] A new consciousness, a higher standard
[2:14:10] of the revealed word, a heightened sense
[2:14:14] of what's right and what's wrong.
[2:14:16] There's so many voices claiming
[2:14:21] all this a new a new dawn especially
[2:14:24] this time of the year a new dawn of a
[2:14:27] new consciousness I wouldn't
[2:14:30] Paul said in Timothy but evil men and
[2:14:32] seducers shall wax worse that means
[2:14:35] increase
[2:14:36] worse and worse deceiving and being
[2:14:39] deceived but continue thou and that's
[2:14:42] you and me in the things which thou hast
[2:14:45] heard ed and learned and hast been
[2:14:48] assured of knowing. Listen, this the
[2:14:51] last phrase, knowing of whom thou hast
[2:14:54] learned them.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people stand for what they
[2:15:01] have believed to be the truth. But you
[2:15:03] know what's important
[2:15:05] is where was the source?
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Where did it come from?
[2:15:15] I had a conversation with a young man
[2:15:17] once out of Bible school
[2:15:21] and he wanted to come around the edge of
[2:15:22] the message and you know just
[2:15:25] he was looking at it.
[2:15:28] So I came onto the subject of the
[2:15:30] serpent seed
[2:15:32] and went through the scripture.
[2:15:36] He couldn't say anything. He fell
[2:15:39] silent, but he said, "Well,"
[2:15:42] he said, "I don't want to follow a man.
[2:15:46] I just want to follow Christ." You've
[2:15:48] all heard that.
[2:15:50] I said, "Okay."
[2:15:53] I said, "How are things at Bible school
[2:15:54] this year?" "Oh," he said, "You know,
[2:15:57] not bad. You know me." He says, "I'm not
[2:15:58] a great student." "Yeah." I said, "Yeah.
[2:16:01] Uh, did you have to study hard?" Yeah.
[2:16:03] Yeah. I said, "You know, study pretty
[2:16:05] hard.
[2:16:07] you just wrote your exams. How do you do
[2:16:08] in your exams? Well, he said, you know,
[2:16:10] kind of average sort of thing. So, but
[2:16:14] you studied hard. Yeah. He said, you
[2:16:16] know, I studied. I said, uh, what did
[2:16:19] you study?
[2:16:22] And he felt totally silent because he
[2:16:24] knew the trap door had shut.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; And when the trap door was shut, I
[2:16:30] didn't give up. I said men's words,
[2:16:35] books written by men. So, we're studying
[2:16:38] men's words. Who are you following
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; this business? The devil throwing it up.
[2:16:44] Are you following a man? They're
[2:16:46] following man. They're following women,
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; following all kinds of godless ideas
[2:16:51] dreamed up in some hatched up in some
[2:16:53] man's mind what he thinks the Bible is.
[2:16:56] I like to have a man that has a source
[2:16:59] stand behind the pulpit. say, "Thus
[2:17:01] sayaith the Lord,"
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; and then have him say, "If God doesn't
[2:17:06] come now
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; and vindicate or manifest what I spoken
[2:17:12] as being the truth, then don't believe
[2:17:14] me."
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; I like to hear that. I've asked
[2:17:17] Catholics, "Do you ever hear a pope say
[2:17:19] that?"
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; No, they've never heard a pope say that.
[2:17:22] You've never had a general overseer.
[2:17:24] You've never had a bishop say that. But
[2:17:25] a prophet can say that because he knows
[2:17:28] that God's going to come on the scene.
[2:17:30] And all of you people here listening to
[2:17:32] my voice, you're under you're under
[2:17:34] responsibility to acknowledge that.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; It's in your hands now. You got to say,
[2:17:41] "What do I do with that?"
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's not only in book. That's on tape.
[2:17:46] You can hear it with your own ears.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to me. Go home,
[2:17:50] get the tape. You'll get that same
[2:17:52] thing. If if he doesn't come now and
[2:17:55] prove that,
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; then I'm false.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; But here comes a invisible God on the
[2:18:02] scene and proves it in infallible
[2:18:06] infallibility of the word.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Seducers
[2:18:16] will increase and they certainly have.
[2:18:23] Now I'm go I'm closing in just a couple
[2:18:25] minutes.
[2:18:28] What is our life saying?
[2:18:32] Not what our words are saying, but what
[2:18:33] is our life saying?
[2:18:38] The Bible says that the spirit and the
[2:18:41] bride say,
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; say it again.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[2:18:50] Do you believe that
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; you just walk down a street, you walk
[2:18:56] into a
[2:18:59] walk into a grocery store, you walk into
[2:19:02] a restaurant
[2:19:06] and they just see,
[2:19:08] not everybody, but they see
[2:19:11] they see there's a aura. There's a
[2:19:14] there's a presence,
[2:19:16] a very real presence.
[2:19:19] And something
[2:19:21] down in their heart is echoing, "Come,
[2:19:26] come.
[2:19:28] You can have this.
[2:19:31] You can be like this." And they look at
[2:19:34] you and they see that you're free.
[2:19:37] Oh, how many bound people there is in
[2:19:41] the world? Bound.
[2:19:43] and they look upon someone and in their
[2:19:45] face there's a sound that says I'm free.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; There's a sound that says I'm alive.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; I don't need the things of the world. I
[2:19:58] have a living Christ. I have a spirit
[2:20:01] within me that's not of this world. I
[2:20:03] have a heavenly divine spirit within me.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; And it only says one word. Come. Come.
[2:20:12] Somebody sees that.
[2:20:15] Somebody sees that. I'm giving you
[2:20:17] personal testimonies here today and I
[2:20:18] hope you don't mind. It's the only
[2:20:20] service we're having and I will be
[2:20:22] closing soon.
[2:20:24] And you perhaps heard this account
[2:20:27] before. But my wife and I were sitting
[2:20:29] on a plane. We were going to South
[2:20:31] Africa
[2:20:33] and we got offloaded in the Canary
[2:20:35] Islands where they refuel.
[2:20:38] I don't know if it was the Canary
[2:20:39] Islands, one of the islands off the
[2:20:41] coast of Africa and we had to wait over
[2:20:44] two, three days and the planes coming
[2:20:46] through were packed and finally they
[2:20:49] said we could go on standby for this big
[2:20:52] jumbo jet 747.
[2:20:55] So I went there way way early. There was
[2:20:58] no staff, no staff at all at the
[2:21:01] counters for South African Airlines.
[2:21:04] And soon as a staff, soon as a two,
[2:21:07] three girls came up, one came to a
[2:21:09] counter and I went there and I was
[2:21:11] actually first. I was standing right
[2:21:13] there. The lady's right here. A woman's
[2:21:17] right on this side of me.
[2:21:20] And she'd wanted to be first, but she
[2:21:22] wasn't first. And she just went like
[2:21:24] this
[2:21:27] and just moved me out of the way
[2:21:29] physically until she was first.
[2:21:33] And you know what that does to me?
[2:21:38] I'd like to hear you laugh like that
[2:21:40] because it does the same thing to you.
[2:21:43] Get her a piece of my mind.
[2:21:49] And then I thought, well, you know, let
[2:21:52] her unload first. And they were after
[2:21:55] seats and we're after seats. And she had
[2:21:57] her whole family there. And she's
[2:21:59] telling her, whoa. said, "They offloaded
[2:22:01] us and we've been in a hotel and I need
[2:22:03] to get my family and we're five people."
[2:22:05] I thought, "Oh my goodness." You know,
[2:22:06] there's only a certain amount of seats
[2:22:08] on standby. And then I got there and
[2:22:12] then we went and sat
[2:22:14] in a a big open area. The counters were
[2:22:17] all over here and there's like a row of
[2:22:18] seats there and about this much
[2:22:21] distance. And my wife and I were sitting
[2:22:23] here and I looked across at that family,
[2:22:27] grown children in their late teens.
[2:22:30] And I thought, why that woman's rude?
[2:22:33] She's so rude
[2:22:35] and loud.
[2:22:37] And I started having compassion for her
[2:22:39] husband.
[2:22:43] Have to go home with that at night and
[2:22:45] listen to that.
[2:22:48] And then they called for everybody to go
[2:22:50] to the loading gate. She will all go to
[2:22:52] the loading gate. And we're all crowded
[2:22:54] there. And she's ahead of us again.
[2:22:57] And she says to her family, because they
[2:22:59] only got one first class seat and you
[2:23:01] know they actually put my my wife and I
[2:23:03] in first class the only seats they had.
[2:23:05] So uh and she says to her husband says,
[2:23:08] "Oh, let me go." Because they only had
[2:23:10] one seat. Let me go. I've never been
[2:23:11] first class. So they all surrendered and
[2:23:14] she was in first class.
[2:23:18] And I have to confess in my heart I was
[2:23:20] saying, "God,
[2:23:22] not anywhere near us.
[2:23:28] And when we get in there, our seats were
[2:23:30] up into the hump going up the little
[2:23:33] circle. And here she is going up that
[2:23:36] circle stairway. So I knew she was up in
[2:23:38] the same area.
[2:23:40] And then there was a, you know, two
[2:23:44] seats facing each other, these big nice
[2:23:46] easy swinging seats like that.
[2:23:49] And uh my wife as we got there first my
[2:23:52] wife sit her and while I was sitting her
[2:23:54] this woman just punk
[2:23:58] got in my seat.
[2:24:05] So now we've got about eight hours in
[2:24:07] the flight and she said now I can't even
[2:24:09] talk to my wife as I have to find
[2:24:10] another seat up there and I'm I'm some
[2:24:12] distance away.
[2:24:15] About four hours into the flight,
[2:24:18] I get up and I go to the washroom
[2:24:22] and this woman says to my wife,
[2:24:26] "What does your husband do?"
[2:24:29] She says, "He's a minister."
[2:24:33] She said, "I've been observing you while
[2:24:37] we sat in the airport, while you sat
[2:24:40] across from us." And she says, "I've
[2:24:43] been watching you and observing you."
[2:24:46] And she says,
[2:24:51] "You have a clean cleanness
[2:24:54] about you." And she said, "It's not on
[2:24:59] your face being clean, but she said it's
[2:25:01] something from within
[2:25:04] and you have a cleanness." And she says,
[2:25:07] "What is it?"
[2:25:10] and she just blasted the door wide open
[2:25:13] and from then till we landed my wife
[2:25:15] witnessed to her about Christ and about
[2:25:19] the believers in South Africa. You
[2:25:22] understand? If id let that self-will go
[2:25:24] and pushed her out of the way, we'd have
[2:25:26] never had that testimony. So it was a
[2:25:29] matter of surrendering to what God says
[2:25:31] we are to be, the kind of light we are
[2:25:33] to be. And then I'm saying why we said
[2:25:35] nothing, never said a word, but the life
[2:25:38] was sounding. I like to say to you
[2:25:41] brothers and sisters, my friends, this
[2:25:43] is kind of my New Year's my New Year's
[2:25:45] service. You're going to go into this
[2:25:47] year as lights in a dark place.
[2:25:52] Perhaps never speaking, but your life is
[2:25:55] sounding out. And it is saying come. It
[2:25:58] is speaking of cleanness. It is speaking
[2:26:00] of something holy. It's speaking of
[2:26:02] something that's unearly in this
[2:26:04] Leodysian time. In this dark age, people
[2:26:07] have enough darkness. They need to see
[2:26:10] some light.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; And the elect of God, whoever they are,
[2:26:14] they will pursue it. They will follow
[2:26:16] after it. And they will come to know the
[2:26:19] same Lord Jesus Christ revealed who you
[2:26:22] are manifesting
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; in this time.
[2:26:26] God bless you.
[2:26:30] I'd like to just have a word of prayer
[2:26:31] with you.
[2:26:33] Let's bow.
[2:26:36] Father,
[2:26:37] what a treasure we have.
[2:26:42] We are so so privileged
[2:26:45] to be able to to to have been called to
[2:26:48] be lights in this world. To have been
[2:26:51] called to be the voice of God, the
[2:26:55] extended voice of this message and this
[2:26:59] messenger to echo out and to speak of
[2:27:02] its reality
[2:27:05] in our lives.
[2:27:07] Oh God. And we've proven it. We've
[2:27:10] proven it, Lord. We've seen it active in
[2:27:12] our families. We've seen it active in
[2:27:15] our children. We see what you have
[2:27:18] accomplished and what you have achieved.
[2:27:21] And so I pray, Father, now you will hear
[2:27:24] my prayer for I ask your blessings.
[2:27:28] I ask your blessings to be doubled upon
[2:27:30] the people. I ask your blessings to be
[2:27:33] poured out upon the people. And I pray
[2:27:36] that a blessing of a desire will be
[2:27:40] created in each of our hearts for our
[2:27:43] individual walk with you, oh God.
[2:27:48] Granted, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:27:51] Christ. And may there be a surrendering
[2:27:54] Lord of each heart. And while I pray, if
[2:27:57] you feel a need in your heart to have a
[2:28:00] deeper surrender to God, God lead me.
[2:28:03] Why don't you raise your hand right now
[2:28:05] while I continue to pray? Lord, you see
[2:28:08] the hands more than the hands, you see
[2:28:10] the hearts. And we are testifying. We
[2:28:14] desire to be surrendered vessels unto
[2:28:17] the Lord in this hour, oh God. And I
[2:28:20] think of the song, Once this life is
[2:28:22] over, then what? What will it be, oh
[2:28:25] God, when we cross over? And so we want
[2:28:28] to be faithful to you. We want to be
[2:28:31] faithful to you, Lord Jesus. I pray,
[2:28:33] Father, that you will give us that
[2:28:36] faithful, faithful spirit.
[2:28:40] And now, Lord, demonstrate your word.
[2:28:42] I've spoken it. Now demonstrate it. I
[2:28:45] ask those that need to be freed from
[2:28:49] something that may have been holding
[2:28:50] them back within their within their own
[2:28:53] nature, their own character, and they
[2:28:56] feel a complex of some sort. Let them
[2:28:58] lay it aside. Let them realize that what
[2:29:01] you are dripping into them now by the
[2:29:04] Holy Spirit, by the word of God, you
[2:29:08] will manifest it, Lord. It's not us that
[2:29:10] manifest it. You manifest it in us. And
[2:29:14] we thank you for that
[2:29:16] the irrevocable promise of God. All
[2:29:20] glory to your name. We pray in the name
[2:29:23] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:29:26] I want to just sing a verse or two of a
[2:29:28] song, Faith of Our Father's Living
[2:29:30] Still. And would you have just a a few
[2:29:33] minutes? I I want to just show you uh a
[2:29:38] few pictures actually of the camp and
[2:29:41] what has been taking place. And it's
[2:29:43] only it'll only be a few minutes. Will
[2:29:44] it be all right?
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's stand and change our
[2:29:48] position as we sing a couple verses of
[2:29:50] this song. Faith of our fathers living
[2:29:52] still.
[2:29:55] of our father
[2:29:58] living
[2:30:00] still
[2:30:03] in
[2:30:07] fire and
[2:30:11] how our hearts be high
[2:30:16] with
[2:30:20] we
[2:30:23] glory.
[2:30:24] as
[2:30:28] our father.
[2:30:35] We will be true to
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:41] death.
