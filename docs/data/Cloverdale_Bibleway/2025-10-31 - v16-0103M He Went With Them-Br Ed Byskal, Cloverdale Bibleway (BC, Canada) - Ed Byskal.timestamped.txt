[7:27] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]

[9:16] Hallelujah.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we all stand together this
[9:19] morning? I mean, [music] he's got it all
[9:22] in control, Linda.
[9:24] Amen. Just been listening the last
[9:26] couple of days to the unchangeable God.
[9:30] And he was saying how many times we ask
[9:32] God for something and he doesn't do it
[9:35] in the way that we expect. But he's
[9:37] still he's still doing it, but he
[9:39] doesn't do it in the way we expect. So,
[9:40] we [music] get all discouraged. And
[9:42] brother Ramy says, "Just hold on." Amen.
[9:44] [music] He works in unexpected ways.
[9:47] Amen. So maybe we could just turn our
[9:49] eyes this [music] morning from the
[9:50] things that have been holding us down.
[9:53] Amen. Take our eyes off [music] of our
[9:54] troubles, off of our circumstances, and
[9:56] just look to Christ this morning and
[9:58] know that he truly does have it all in
[10:00] control. [music] And sometimes the enemy
[10:01] will come to us and he'll come to us
[10:03] with things that are true. And I'll use
[10:05] them just to discourage us and their
[10:07] circumstances and [music] they have
[10:08] every appearance of being true. But
[10:10] that's not the truth that God was
[10:12] talking about in the scriptures when he
[10:13] said, "Whatsoever [music] things are
[10:14] true to think on these things. For when
[10:16] God speaks truth, it's the truth that
[10:18] sets us free. Amen. So, let's take our
[10:20] eyes and turn them to Christ [music]
[10:21] this morning off of our troubles, off of
[10:24] our circumstances, and just believe that
[10:26] he truly does have all things in control
[10:28] this morning. And we can be encouraged
[10:30] this morning. Amen. Why don't [music] we
[10:32] just turn our eyes to the Lord Jesus as
[10:33] we sing this song this morning that he
[10:35] has it all in control. [music]
[10:38] Oh, [singing]
[10:40] he's got [music] it all in control. Oh.
[10:46] Oh, [singing] yes. I know he's got it
[10:50] all [music] in God from [singing]
[10:56] He's put
[11:00] [music]
[11:01] in my [singing] soul.
[11:07] He's [music]
[11:08] got it all. [singing]
[11:10] Amen. If you believe that this morning,
[11:12] sing it [music] again. He's got it all.
[11:15] He's [singing] got it all in [music]
[11:18] control.
[11:21] I [singing]
[11:25] [music] in control.
[11:29] [singing]
[11:30] He's
[11:32] reassuring [music]
[11:35] [singing]
[11:36] my soul. [music]
[11:41] He's [music]
[11:42] [singing] got it all.
[11:44] Amen. So, let's put our lives in his
[11:46] hands this morning. I put my life
[11:48] [music] I [singing] put my life in his
[11:53] hands.
[11:57] I [music]
[11:58] put my life [singing]
[11:59] in his hands.
[12:03] [music]
[12:04] So [singing]
[12:06] I walk down.
[12:08] I'm sure it's in [singing] his
[12:12] [music]
[12:15] I put my life [singing and music] in.

[37:40] Amen. Brother Bis, God bless you this
[37:43] morning.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[37:52] Happy new year.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; I was speaking to the Lord this morning
[37:56] and I was thinking and saying what would
[37:59] really make us happy or make me happy if
[38:02] the rapture took place.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; So I will kind of be preaching from that
[38:06] direction.
[38:08] I don't think you'll be disappointed.
[38:10] You wouldn't be disappointed if the
[38:12] rapture took place.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're studying. I
[38:16] don't care what your goal in life is.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[38:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much uh you know we put
[38:22] into life, we wouldn't be discouraged or
[38:27] we wouldn't be saddened by
[38:30] &gt;&gt; changing.
[38:32] And I'll be along that line this
[38:34] morning.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[38:39] I just want to say that uh I believe
[38:41] brother Tim Dodd and Sister Sarah will
[38:44] be returning this week
[38:46] uh having a time in Johannesburg and
[38:49] South Africa and also in Durban.
[38:52] Uh so we're thankful for that. We're
[38:54] also thankful for the greetings also
[38:56] that I heard brother Ryan give from
[38:59] different places and uh we just want to
[39:04] uh show our appreciation also for the
[39:06] saints from Reton, Seattle, Tacoma. God
[39:09] bless you from Victoria. God bless you.
[39:13] And uh we appreciate it, don't we? And
[39:17] for those that are streaming,
[39:19] I we had so many comments also from the
[39:22] local congregation
[39:25] uh for the watch night service and
[39:28] actually my wife was the first one to
[39:31] speak to me. She said it was just so
[39:34] spectacular to see the different groups,
[39:38] groups from China uh sing for us. the
[39:42] group from uh Congo. And they weren't
[39:46] all from Congo, but we give Congo the
[39:48] credit.
[39:51] [laughter]
[39:52] And uh the worship uh we're we're here
[39:55] to worship the Lord.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not here to play church.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; We're here to receive something from
[40:04] God.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; I would like everyone to give their full
[40:08] attention to the word today. Uh the Lord
[40:11] began to speak to me. I've been on this
[40:14] subject for quite some time. Uh then I
[40:18] was awakened very very early this
[40:20] morning and I finally I just the
[40:23] thoughts were coming. The message was
[40:25] coming. Uh I thought I was all done last
[40:28] night. Uh, I had to get up and uh early
[40:32] this morning and so I'll be just
[40:36] speaking to you,
[40:38] taking my [clears throat] taking my time
[40:41] if that's all right with you. And while
[40:44] you're standing, I'm going to have
[40:45] brother John come and read the scripture
[40:48] for me.
[40:50] Uh, can you do you have a microphone you
[40:53] could use?
[41:00] I want to read and you can turn in your
[41:02] Bibles please to Luke the 24th chapter.
[41:07] And I know that I've spoken from it
[41:09] quite a few times. I'm not going to be
[41:11] preaching from it. I'm going to make a
[41:13] I'm going to make a proposal to you
[41:17] and uh that proposal has to do with the
[41:23] turning a corner. I think before we
[41:26] read, I will just
[41:28] uh give you a give you perhaps a head
[41:33] start on where I want to go, Lord
[41:36] willing. I have not been able to shake
[41:39] from my mind
[41:42] that Luke 24, Luke 24
[41:45] has been uh
[41:49] has been the
[41:51] what shall I say the uh has been put
[41:55] forward by the messenger
[41:58] as as a prophetic event.
[42:03] uh Luke 24 as I thought about it this
[42:07] morning and and and uh it says more
[42:11] about the event of the after the
[42:15] resurrection of Jesus Christ. And I know
[42:18] soon as we read Luke 24, we think of
[42:20] Easter. Do not think of Easter.
[42:23] I I want to you to see that the life and
[42:27] ministry of Jesus Christ started very
[42:30] simply. Started with the sermon on the
[42:33] mount. Had healings and miracles of
[42:36] various kinds, simple and difficult,
[42:41] raising the dead and so on so forth. And
[42:43] the and and the feeding the people, the
[42:48] multiplication of the the bread and the
[42:50] fishes, all of those things. But then
[42:53] those things tapered off. Then he began
[42:56] to speak very very seriously about the
[42:59] son of man will be slain will be in the
[43:03] grave three days. But all of this had to
[43:06] do because now we have a messenger in
[43:09] this time that explains he comes as son
[43:13] of man as a prophet. He comes on earth
[43:17] God word in flesh as a son of man is on
[43:21] earth and then he becomes son of God
[43:24] because God is a spirit. So he he
[43:27] returns as the holy spirit. So now Luke
[43:31] 24 is just a junction between the
[43:34] resurrection
[43:36] and the ending of the son of man
[43:38] ministry and the beginning of the son of
[43:40] god. And they and he tells them to go
[43:43] and tarry in Jerusalem until you be
[43:46] endued. It's not enough for me to be
[43:48] with you. It must be I must be in you.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; And that is the only way that could
[43:54] happen. So there was a great event
[43:55] taking place.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; And uh and so I would say and then
[44:00] brother Brennham he puts it in our
[44:02] language. We turn a corner. He said
[44:05] anybody can build a wall
[44:07] &gt;&gt; but it takes a master mason to turn a
[44:10] corner.
[44:12] And uh and and if you want my opinion,
[44:16] my sincere opinion, there's no corner
[44:20] that has been turned in the scripture
[44:23] like the one Jesus turned from mortal to
[44:26] immortal.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Raising from the dead,
[44:31] &gt;&gt; paying the cost of our sins,
[44:34] &gt;&gt; and raising from the dead, and then
[44:36] saying, "You will have a body like my
[44:39] glorious body.
[44:41] That's what I trust 2016 would bring.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; So, we'll read in the Bible, if you
[44:48] would, Brother John, please, from Luke
[44:51] the 13th, the 24th chapter, starting
[44:54] with verse 13 down to 32.
[45:01] And behold, two of them went that same
[45:04] day to a village called Emmas, which was
[45:07] from Jerusalem, about three score
[45:09] furlongs. And they talked together of
[45:12] all these things which had happened. And
[45:16] it came to pass that while they communed
[45:18] together,
[45:20] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near
[45:24] and went with them. But their eyes were
[45:27] holden that they should not know him.
[45:31] And he said unto them, "What manner of
[45:33] communications are these that ye have
[45:36] one to another as you walk and are sad?"
[45:40] And the one of them whose name was
[45:42] Cleopus answering, said unto him, "Art
[45:45] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[45:48] hast not known the things which are come
[45:51] to pass there in these days?" And he
[45:54] said unto them, "What things?" And they
[45:57] said unto him concerning Jesus of
[46:00] Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty
[46:02] indeed, and word before God and all the
[46:06] people, and how the chief priests and
[46:08] our rulers delivered him to be condemned
[46:11] to death, and have crucified him. But we
[46:15] trusted that it had been he which should
[46:18] have redeemed Israel. And beside all
[46:21] this, today is the third day since these
[46:25] things were done. Yay, and certain women
[46:28] also of our company made us astonished,
[46:31] which were early at the separ. And when
[46:34] they found not his body, they came,
[46:38] saying that they had also seen a vision
[46:40] of angels, which said that he was alive.
[46:44] And certain of them which were with us
[46:47] went to the sepre and found it even so
[46:50] as the women had said, but him they saw
[46:53] not. And he said unto them, "Oh fools,
[46:57] and slow of heart to believe all that
[47:00] the prophets have spoken. Ought not
[47:03] Christ who have suffered these things
[47:06] and to enter into his glory?" And
[47:08] beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
[47:11] he expounded unto them and all the
[47:13] scriptures the things concerning
[47:15] himself. And they drew nigh unto the
[47:18] village whether they went. And he made
[47:21] as though he would have gone further.
[47:23] But they constrained him, saying, "Abide
[47:26] with us, for it is toward evening, and
[47:29] the day is far spent." And he went in to
[47:32] tarry with them. And it came to pass as
[47:35] he sat at meat with them, he took bread
[47:38] and blessed it and break and gave to
[47:41] them, and their eyes were opened, and
[47:44] they knew him, and he vanished out of
[47:47] their sight. And they said one to
[47:50] another, "Did not our heart burn within
[47:53] us while he talked with us by the way,
[47:56] and while he opened to us the
[47:59] scriptures?"
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll bow in a prayer. Dear
[48:05] heavenly father,
[48:07] we are here gathered today and all of
[48:10] those that may be streaming.
[48:13] I pray that your holy divine presence
[48:17] will surround every individual
[48:20] &gt;&gt; and that the Holy Spirit will not only
[48:23] surround us but brood over every
[48:26] individual. Oh God, let it be an
[48:29] individual experience. I pray that while
[48:33] we're here on this first uh Lord's day
[48:36] of the 2016,
[48:38] I pray, oh God, you will emphasize and
[48:41] make it a profound gathering. I pray
[48:44] that the people, oh God, will be made
[48:47] ready for whatever you have in store for
[48:50] us in this coming year. May it not be
[48:53] just so many church services. May it not
[48:56] just be driving, oh God, to church to be
[48:58] here in attendance, even though we
[49:00] appreciate that, but meet the people in
[49:03] their homes. Meet them in their jobs.
[49:06] Meet them in their schools, oh God. Be
[49:09] with them, I pray, and reveal yourself
[49:11] to them. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[49:14] and for the glory of God himself, we
[49:16] pray. Amen.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[49:27] I I want to speak to you on
[49:30] Jesus himself drew near, but the phrase
[49:33] that I wish for to impress you is he
[49:36] went with them. I I stood here or I sat
[49:40] on the platform. I can't remember
[49:42] whether I was standing or sitting.
[49:46] And uh I've been pondering this subject
[49:49] for some weeks. And I thought and I was
[49:52] in prayer and I was just saying Lord
[49:54] Jesus.
[49:56] There were three things that I wanted to
[49:58] stress. [clears throat]
[50:01] And the first one was he opened the
[50:04] scriptures
[50:06] and the second one is he opened their
[50:10] eyes and the third one is he opened
[50:13] their understanding.
[50:16] And I can tell you that it's not
[50:18] sufficient just to have our eyes opened.
[50:22] We need to go further.
[50:25] Many have had their eyes open to the
[50:28] they've heard the scriptures. They've
[50:30] heard the messenger.
[50:32] They've felt the impression and the
[50:34] impulse of the Holy Spirit opening
[50:37] scripture.
[50:39] But it's more than opening scripture.
[50:41] Then you have to have your eyes opened.
[50:44] And then last but not least is the
[50:47] understanding needs to be expanded so
[50:50] you know how that relates to the your
[50:52] life and the time that you're in. This
[50:55] is what's important. And so I feel uh I
[50:59] feel a great responsibility
[51:01] from the perspective of the ministry uh
[51:05] from myself and the other ministers that
[51:07] minister here because I see Jesus as a
[51:10] great shepherd leading those people and
[51:14] persistently staying with them until the
[51:19] scriptures were opened until their eyes
[51:22] were opened and until their
[51:24] understanding was opened and then he
[51:26] vanished from them.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; He left from them and the corner had
[51:30] been turned.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; I knew that brother Brandham had said
[51:37] that.
[51:40] He said it in December of 1964. at the
[51:43] end of 1964
[51:46] in December
[51:48] [clears throat] in the in the message.
[51:50] Now friends, when I refer to him, I want
[51:53] you to think I'm I want you to remember
[51:55] I'm not just referring to a man. I'm
[51:57] referring to someone who I believe was
[52:00] ordained of God to uh for his life to
[52:07] act out and to function in a certain
[52:09] way. So it will replay
[52:13] uh the very life of Jesus Christ. And we
[52:16] all sing the chorus to be like Jesus, to
[52:18] be like Jesus. All I ask is to be like
[52:21] him. I don't know if that's really all
[52:23] we ask. You know, that's all we really
[52:25] want. Do you really want to live like
[52:27] him? Uh he became poor that others could
[52:31] become rich. He suffered terribly on
[52:35] behalf of other people and we want but
[52:38] we do want to be like him. But I sat on
[52:41] the platform here and I said, "Lord,
[52:43] stay with me.
[52:45] Stay with me.
[52:48] Stay with me till the scriptures are
[52:51] opened.
[52:52] Stay with me until my eyes are opened to
[52:56] those scriptures.
[52:58] And stay with me until I have my
[53:01] understanding opened that I might be
[53:04] able to relate those scriptures to the
[53:07] time that we're in.
[53:09] Uh, I [clears throat] want you to try to
[53:12] put, you'll have to be very, very alert
[53:14] to not just hear, don't don't look on
[53:16] this as a sermon. I I want to try to
[53:19] impart to you some
[53:22] instruction
[53:24] of what the message is all about
[53:27] and why we believe what we believe.
[53:30] Uh, [clears throat]
[53:32] in the me in the sermon in the message,
[53:35] who do you say this is? That was in
[53:38] December of 1964.
[53:40] And that's the first time that I can
[53:42] find brother Brandham refers now any
[53:46] builder can build a wall. He can build
[53:50] that. But it takes a real master
[53:52] mechanic to turn a corner. When you got
[53:56] to cut the corner, that's the time it
[54:00] takes. It shows whether you really are a
[54:04] stonemason or not. Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now on these corners is
[54:10] when trouble comes." Spiritually
[54:12] speaking, when Luther turned the corner,
[54:16] that's where the problem came. When
[54:17] Wesley turned the corner, that's where
[54:20] the problem came. When the power of the
[54:23] Pentecost came and the people turned the
[54:25] corner, that's where the problem. And in
[54:27] the message there's not not the great
[54:30] healings and not the discerning of the
[54:32] hearts and not almost like an
[54:34] entertainment and they wanted that to
[54:37] continue because they were building a
[54:39] wall.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's a wall and then
[54:44] they wanted that to continue and they
[54:46] expected to continue but he turned a
[54:47] corner. Then they were disappointed.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Oh then that's so harsh. And he was
[54:52] telling them you're backsliding. You're
[54:55] take adopting the traits of the world,
[54:59] becoming more worldly in fashion and in
[55:03] dress and in all the mannerisms and in
[55:06] conversation and in in in religion and
[55:10] in worship and and the worship has gone
[55:13] entirely to entertainment.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; You know that it's a show.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come here for a show.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus came here for salvation. Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; And so it's not just a show.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; So he turned a corner.
[55:32] And then the next time he refers to it
[55:34] is January of 65,
[55:38] the next month. He says, "But we're not
[55:40] building a wall like we start off with
[55:44] Luther's message. You go right on
[55:46] straight line or a Pentecostal message."
[55:49] He said, "We're turning a corner." Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And then in December of 1965, we're
[55:56] coming right to the end. Those of you
[55:57] that are followers and believers of the
[56:00] message, I want you to pay very strict
[56:02] attention. Then in December of 1965, in
[56:05] the rapture,
[56:07] he says,
[56:10] "It's easy when somebody turns a corner.
[56:14] It's easy when somebody turns a corner
[56:16] of a of a brickmason.
[56:18] Turns a corner. starts everybody laying
[56:22] their bricks right down the same row.
[56:27] The message didn't come to give us
[56:29] better quality bricks.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; The message came to show us the word and
[56:36] the and the time that we're in. And uh
[56:39] so I just want to say stay with us a wee
[56:42] bit, please. and starts everybody laying
[56:45] their bricks right down the same row
[56:47] like a certain denomination starts and
[56:49] starts rolling down the row. It's all
[56:52] right. But when you get to them turns
[56:56] when you have to turn back the other
[56:58] way. Now God isn't building a wall.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; He's building a house.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; And there's many cuts and turns that
[57:08] he's predicted here in the Bible. and
[57:11] the turns. Anybody could try to make a
[57:13] turn, but it must be according to the
[57:17] blueprint.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And he said in the rapture, starts out a
[57:22] paragraph,
[57:23] we're at a corner.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; The rapture
[57:30] will be a big major corner.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; That's the promise of the scripture. And
[57:37] Apostle Paul says it,
[57:40] we shall all be changed.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; That's going to be a corner of all
[57:44] corners.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; When a mass of people, a group of people
[57:50] defeat death,
[57:52] &gt;&gt; which is the purpose Jesus died,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; he died that we might live.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Not this ordinary life, but he died that
[57:59] we might have eternal life.
[58:02] Eternal life is is something we haven't
[58:05] tasted of yet in in a physical way. But
[58:09] we will have a body like under his
[58:11] glorious body and we will live eternal.
[58:14] That's eternal life.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And that's the corner that I'm looking
[58:19] for. He said as long as we're he said
[58:22] we're we're at a corner in the rapture
[58:25] message which was December the 4th,
[58:27] 1965.
[58:29] And his last message to the public was
[58:33] in 1965. I listened to it. Leadership.
[58:38] It was on the 7th of December. And we
[58:41] just I believe that's 50 years on the
[58:44] 7th of December. That's Jubilee.
[58:48] I I I think I'm correct in saying that
[58:52] we're in the Jubilee year because the
[58:55] 49th year is not the beginning of a
[58:57] jubilee, but the 50th year. You know,
[59:00] those things might not be significant,
[59:02] but they might be very significant. So,
[59:05] I wouldn't downplay it,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; but we're in 2016 now. We're in a
[59:10] jubilee year. Uh we have passed the 50th
[59:14] and we're into a jubilee time. And now
[59:17] he preaches his last message. Lips are
[59:21] sealed and he vanishes.
[59:25] He's taken from the face of the earth.
[59:28] And he speaks starts off with the
[59:31] rapture.
[59:33] Things that are to be
[59:36] modern events.
[59:38] Modern events made clear
[59:41] by prophecy. Luke 24.
[59:45] That's the chapter I'm going to be in
[59:47] now. Luke 24. The modern events. There's
[59:51] something impending. Modern events mean
[59:54] something that's overhanging almost.
[59:57] It's just almost almost uh delayed.
[1:00:04] And uh so I I've been pondering for
[1:00:09] weeks if not years Luke 24 and seeing
[1:00:13] more and more and more. And then this
[1:00:15] morning
[1:00:17] uh this turning the corner. I just I had
[1:00:20] to get up and start making these notes
[1:00:22] and let you know that in the in the
[1:00:25] message leadership, excuse me if I'm
[1:00:27] chopping up my thought a wee bit here.
[1:00:30] He said, "As long as you're
[1:00:33] building a wall one straight way, it's
[1:00:36] fine. But the the brick layers can go
[1:00:40] right down the row." But then you have
[1:00:43] to turn a corner. So I would have to say
[1:00:47] he's he's saying something to us in 12
[1:00:50] months and especially in the last few
[1:00:54] hours of his life. He's talking about
[1:00:56] turning a corner. never talked about it
[1:00:58] in all the 30 years of ministry, but now
[1:01:01] he's talking about turning a corner. I
[1:01:03] would say he's trying to point the
[1:01:05] people who are following
[1:01:08] and Jesus and he chooses the scripture
[1:01:11] where Jesus is walking with the two men
[1:01:14] on the way to Emmas.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; He's trying to let them know the
[1:01:19] corner's been turned. Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the things that were
[1:01:27] spoken?
[1:01:29] And uh and they're continuing on with
[1:01:31] their normal life. The women are
[1:01:34] preparing spices for the body.
[1:01:37] Uh Joseph of Arythea has taken the body
[1:01:40] down and begged it from Pilate. And you
[1:01:44] you we we think of all that. Well,
[1:01:46] that's just the crucifixion and the
[1:01:47] resurrection. and that is Easter and so
[1:01:49] on so forth. We've just come through
[1:01:51] what they considered the Christmas
[1:01:53] season and they got it all wrong to
[1:01:55] begin with.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; He wasn't born in December the 25th
[1:01:59] anyway. That's just somebody's concocted
[1:02:02] that in their mind and they built a huge
[1:02:04] huge religion out of it. But that's not
[1:02:06] what it is. God sent his son from the
[1:02:09] bosom of the father
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; for this was his desire. He's going to
[1:02:14] he's going to redeem the earth. And this
[1:02:17] is the one he's going to do it through,
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing. And here's Jesus
[1:02:24] himself walking with his two with his
[1:02:27] disciples who they have heard that he
[1:02:31] was going to be risen. He he told them
[1:02:33] plainly that he was going to be slain by
[1:02:35] the leaders and he's going to be raised.
[1:02:37] I have a question for the congregation.
[1:02:40] I have a question. And the question is,
[1:02:42] how is it that all those people
[1:02:46] saw the bread, saw the fishes, saw the
[1:02:49] miracles, had the healings, raised from
[1:02:52] the dead, all of these things, and then
[1:02:55] his own disciples, even at the last
[1:02:57] Passover, how he tells them that he will
[1:03:00] be slain. He they're with him when he
[1:03:02] goes to Gethsemane. And and how come
[1:03:05] there's nobody at the tomb?
[1:03:09] H how come nobody's at the mouth of the
[1:03:12] seeler? Not one.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Not one person.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; The only people that go there are some
[1:03:18] women to anoint his body which they find
[1:03:22] isn't there. So they've made the spices.
[1:03:24] How is it? You know, you know why it is?
[1:03:28] We're the same kind of people.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; We're the same kind of people. the word
[1:03:32] of God and we God can send a messenger
[1:03:35] with the most infallible
[1:03:37] uh gift of God and have the Lord Jesus
[1:03:41] Christ speak directly out of his mouth
[1:03:43] and have him say and you can hear it and
[1:03:45] some people won't even pick up a tape to
[1:03:47] hear it.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Put yourself in the same place and say,
[1:03:53] "Well, well, the the the message is full
[1:03:55] of it, but I've never heard it. I've
[1:03:57] never heard him say, "That's my voice,
[1:03:59] but that's not me speaking." You need to
[1:04:02] hear it.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And if you don't, then put yourself in
[1:04:05] the same bracket of those who wouldn't
[1:04:07] go to the tomb.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I I I don't I don't I'm just not
[1:04:11] involved enough. Well, then it's just
[1:04:13] church to you. It's got to go beyond
[1:04:16] church. It's got to go beyond all the
[1:04:18] scriptures. Oh my, I've never heard that
[1:04:21] before. That is so wonderful. It's not
[1:04:23] enough.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; I'm here today to say it's not enough.
[1:04:28] You've got to go till the personal eyes
[1:04:30] are opened and you know who he is and
[1:04:34] it's got to go beyond that. You got to
[1:04:36] go to where the understanding is open.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And then he was ready to depart and
[1:04:44] bless them
[1:04:46] and tell them to tar in Jerusalem.
[1:04:51] So we do not want to be just builders of
[1:04:54] a wall.
[1:04:57] But I want to say that there is a
[1:05:00] correlation between
[1:05:03] uh Luke 24 and what it is that you're
[1:05:06] expecting. You're not just sitting here
[1:05:09] to take in a Sunday morning service, but
[1:05:12] I'm sure that you're sitting here to be
[1:05:15] to be better prepared, to be made
[1:05:18] better, more aware of uh of what it is
[1:05:22] we're expecting. Yes.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to have
[1:05:26] suggest to you that we we should just go
[1:05:29] on and on and on. There should be
[1:05:31] preparation
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; and right over this pulpit and you
[1:05:35] listening should be on the edge of your
[1:05:38] seats in preparation. We're in
[1:05:41] preparation. God called me into this
[1:05:43] message for something. And and the if
[1:05:46] the Bible has pre has preached anything
[1:05:48] or persuaded us about anything, it has
[1:05:51] said this. Apostle Paul, I'm sure you'll
[1:05:55] agree with Apostle Paul. He says, "And
[1:05:58] behold, I send the promise of my
[1:06:00] father." Jesus said, "Behold, I send the
[1:06:02] promise of my father upon you." But
[1:06:04] Apostle Paul says, "Now this I say,
[1:06:06] brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
[1:06:09] inherit the kingdom of God, neither do
[1:06:12] corruption inherit uh incorruption.
[1:06:16] And behold, I show you a great mystery."
[1:06:19] That's Apostle Paul. Behold, I show you
[1:06:22] a great mystery. Here's the mystery. We
[1:06:25] shall not all sleep,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; but we shall all be changed.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus himself didn't sleep, he
[1:06:39] he didn't continue to sleep. He was
[1:06:42] resurrected and he rose and he's awake
[1:06:45] and walked with the disciples. He's
[1:06:48] trying to show them exactly what Paul is
[1:06:51] saying. Behold, I show you a great
[1:06:54] mystery.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I'm awake.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; I'm alive. I'm with you. And I'm going
[1:07:02] to stay with you.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that two disciples were
[1:07:10] on their way to Emmas.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I want to say to everyone here today,
[1:07:15] you're on your way someplace.
[1:07:18] You're on your way in your job. You're
[1:07:21] on your way in your profession.
[1:07:24] You're on your way in your studies.
[1:07:27] But you're on your way someplace.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You're going someplace. You're headed
[1:07:33] someplace.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I'm here announcing to you, uh, I I know
[1:07:37] it. You are you you have some plan.
[1:07:40] You've got some agenda. You've got some
[1:07:43] program. Oh, I want to, you know, I I I
[1:07:46] anticipate getting married or I
[1:07:48] anticipate having a family or I
[1:07:51] anticipate retiring or I anticipate
[1:07:54] doing something this next year. Maybe we
[1:07:57] should all agree that we should
[1:07:59] anticipate that a change and and and
[1:08:02] it's not sufficient that we just make uh
[1:08:06] uh a tradition out of the phrases of the
[1:08:09] message. I hear the body change. I don't
[1:08:12] want to just hear about it. I want to
[1:08:14] know that I'm moving towards it that
[1:08:17] something is happening within my own
[1:08:20] experience
[1:08:21] that I that I'm being in tune with the
[1:08:24] scripture. I'm being in tune with the
[1:08:26] time and it's important for us to I feel
[1:08:30] that I have a solemn duty today.
[1:08:38] I show you a great mystery.
[1:08:41] We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
[1:08:44] be changed.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And in the moment, in the twinkling of
[1:08:47] an eye,
[1:08:49] we'll be changed,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; transformed.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; So the the Bible tells us that the two
[1:09:02] of them
[1:09:03] went that same day
[1:09:06] to the village called Emmas. They're on
[1:09:08] their way to Emmas because they live
[1:09:11] there. You may live in Vancouver or Suri
[1:09:15] or
[1:09:16] Tacoma or Victoria. You live there and
[1:09:20] you you're going to after this service
[1:09:22] you're going to return there. And they
[1:09:24] were on their way. It was totally
[1:09:26] unexpected.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; It wasn't unexpected that they would go
[1:09:30] back to Emmas, but it was unexpected
[1:09:32] that they'd have company.
[1:09:35] Yeah.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And this person that was with them. And
[1:09:39] when you leave this place, I've already
[1:09:42] prayed that the God who went with them,
[1:09:47] that that same Lord Jesus Christ, the
[1:09:49] Holy Spirit, will make himself so real
[1:09:52] to you, so near to you that you'll begin
[1:09:57] to understand. You'll begin to grasp
[1:10:00] things that were spoken. Oh, and maybe
[1:10:03] things that you heard, things that
[1:10:05] you've read in the scripture and it
[1:10:07] starts coming in like a wave. Don't
[1:10:09] don't push it off. Give yourself to it.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yield to the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And something starts to twinge within
[1:10:20] you. Maybe some of you haven't been
[1:10:22] baptized in his name yet, and you need
[1:10:26] to represent his resurrection. Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; You need to come up out of this water
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; being baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:35] Jesus Christ. And it's one of the
[1:10:37] fundamental things. Maybe you say,
[1:10:39] "Well, that is such a simple thing." And
[1:10:41] this was just a simple thing, too. We're
[1:10:43] going home to we're going home to Emmas.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; And and furthermore, we're very
[1:10:50] discouraged about everything.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; They should have been at the tomb.
[1:10:56] They should have been at the tomb and
[1:10:57] not walking towards a mass.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; They could have been happy.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But they're on their way to a mass. And
[1:11:05] you're sitting here today. You've driven
[1:11:06] to church. Oh, and maybe it's a uh, you
[1:11:10] know, the first Sunday of New Year's, we
[1:11:12] ought to be. If that's all, I can tell
[1:11:14] you it's a whole lot more than that. And
[1:11:17] in the mind of God, I can tell you I
[1:11:19] speak on behalf of him today. He has
[1:11:22] much more in mind for than for you to
[1:11:25] just be here to church and to hear some
[1:11:27] words. He he has ordained certain words
[1:11:31] to come down into your lodge into your
[1:11:33] soul and to stay there and to bring
[1:11:36] forth uh some eternal fruit to him.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; He wants a glory out of this service.
[1:11:48] and they talked together of all the
[1:11:50] things which had happened
[1:11:54] and I've heard
[1:11:57] as I've sat down and spoken with
[1:11:59] different ones
[1:12:00] and your conversation is about
[1:12:05] our conversation I could say may be
[1:12:07] about those
[1:12:10] some have left
[1:12:13] maybe very dear friends,
[1:12:15] maybe family.
[1:12:18] Hey folks, listen.
[1:12:21] Don't let me have to say it again. These
[1:12:23] folks all went through that.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; That's all part of turning the corner.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody ain't going to turn the
[1:12:35] corner.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Some may not turn the corner, friends.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And if my family goes with me, fine. If
[1:12:46] they don't go with me, I just continue
[1:12:49] on because I must carry on. This is the
[1:12:52] direction God has headed me and I'm on
[1:12:55] my way. And I have somebody walking
[1:12:58] beside me. He has brought me to this
[1:13:01] message. He has spoken something very
[1:13:03] clear to my soul and it has it's it's
[1:13:07] been such a such a surge, such an
[1:13:09] enlightenment, so glorious. This is not
[1:13:12] some emotional thing, friends. This is
[1:13:14] something you can't escape.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother John.
[1:13:24] Sister Sephora,
[1:13:26] wonderful to see you.
[1:13:32] And they talked about the things. And
[1:13:34] the Bible says, "And it came to pass
[1:13:36] that while they communed together and
[1:13:38] reasoned, Jesus himself
[1:13:41] drew near and went with them." That was
[1:13:44] wonderful, wasn't it? And he said unto
[1:13:46] them, "What manner of communications are
[1:13:49] these that you have one to another and
[1:13:52] are sad?"
[1:13:55] He noticed that you're not happy, you're
[1:13:58] sad, you're heavy-hearted. What are what
[1:14:00] are your communications about? You may
[1:14:03] you may think that I'm just talking to
[1:14:05] somebody
[1:14:08] and may not realize that you actually
[1:14:10] have another person listening to you
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; from another realm, from another
[1:14:16] dimension.
[1:14:18] And his determination is I want to make
[1:14:22] myself so real to them that they will
[1:14:24] live for nothing nothing more than
[1:14:27] coming to where I am. and I am
[1:14:30] determined to bring them to where I am.
[1:14:34] And the Bible says, "And they said unto
[1:14:36] them, what manner of communications are
[1:14:39] these?" And the bi Bible also said that
[1:14:42] they were
[1:14:44] they communed together and they reasoned
[1:14:47] together.
[1:14:49] And uh I I'd like to just enlarge on
[1:14:54] that please a wee bit. when they
[1:14:57] communed together
[1:15:00] and reasoned together
[1:15:04] and the Bible says that their eyes were
[1:15:07] Holden
[1:15:09] and Holden has two has two meanings. One
[1:15:14] is that they were not permitted to see
[1:15:19] but that's not just by itself. That's
[1:15:22] not the full meaning of it. that they
[1:15:24] were not permitted to see, but that
[1:15:27] someone was actually holding back
[1:15:31] what they needed to say.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And their eyes were holding and the and
[1:15:37] it it is to lay hold. The actual word
[1:15:40] that is used is to lay hold on, to hold
[1:15:44] fast, to get possession of. and their
[1:15:48] eyes were holden so that they would
[1:15:50] continue on in the direction that they
[1:15:53] were going because Jesus knew that when
[1:15:56] they got to their place they were going
[1:15:59] to ex they were going to express what
[1:16:01] they really were and that was they had
[1:16:03] the character
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; to invite and constrain him
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; to literally constrain him to come in
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; because in in that act of constraining
[1:16:15] him they sat and had food. And while
[1:16:18] they sat sat and had food, he broke the
[1:16:21] bread. And and I've said it before many
[1:16:24] times, but it was in he was made known
[1:16:27] in the breaking of the bread. And so
[1:16:28] many uh feel that that is just
[1:16:31] exclusively how he breaks the word. It's
[1:16:34] more than that. It is the head of the
[1:16:36] house
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; breaks the bread.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Only the father of the house breaks the
[1:16:42] bread. And so when they sat down, he
[1:16:45] took the bread. He took the bread and
[1:16:49] broke the bread. And then they say, "Oh,
[1:16:53] the head of the house is here."
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; The one representing the father is here.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the house.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham refers to it many times
[1:17:08] when he took and broke the bread. He
[1:17:11] said he did something like he did
[1:17:14] before.
[1:17:16] He had done this before. He broke the
[1:17:19] bread before and it clicked in their
[1:17:21] memory. Oh, this is how he did it
[1:17:24] before. And the thing was people that
[1:17:27] people that listened and the full gospel
[1:17:29] businessmen and the thousands of people
[1:17:32] that came, they saw now here a little
[1:17:35] servant of God speaking to a person
[1:17:38] telling them the secrets of their heart.
[1:17:40] He did that before.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; It wasn't somebody with a seventh grade
[1:17:45] education from Kentucky. It was none
[1:17:48] other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:50] speaking through a yielded vessel and
[1:17:52] telling them it was a an ordinary man
[1:17:56] that we call brother William Brandham.
[1:17:58] But it was that's why he could say
[1:18:00] that's not me speaking.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Who knows us? That's the one that's
[1:18:10] going with you.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's the one I'm stressing this
[1:18:13] morning. That's the one I want you to
[1:18:15] have your attention on today.
[1:18:25] And he laid hold. He held back. And it
[1:18:28] says their eyes were holding that they
[1:18:30] shouldn't know him. But they were
[1:18:33] speaking all the things. And listen
[1:18:35] friends, it's not enough to speak about
[1:18:37] our individual difficulties and filling
[1:18:41] our our time and our mind with someone.
[1:18:44] Oh. Oh my. Uh I'm going to be a wee bit
[1:18:48] rep reproving now.
[1:18:51] I have such a dear friend and they're
[1:18:53] not walking with me and they've turned
[1:18:54] and they've turned this message down,
[1:18:56] etc.
[1:18:59] Don't don't consider me wrong, but I
[1:19:00] say, "So what?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Is that going to affect you? Is that
[1:19:06] going to afflict me?" Well, I was so
[1:19:08] attached to them. Oh, how were you
[1:19:10] attached? Emotionally attached.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; But be attached to the scripture.
[1:19:17] And the scripture says, "No man can
[1:19:21] pluck them out of my hand."
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I want you to
[1:19:25] respond to this, "All that the Father
[1:19:28] has given me will come."
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And no man can pluck them out of my
[1:19:34] hand.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; No man, no woman, no job, no success,
[1:19:39] nothing can pluck them out of my hand. I
[1:19:43] say glory to God.
[1:19:45] I want to walk with that kind of person.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I want to go. I want to see you walk out
[1:19:50] of this place today associated with him
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; and saying to him, "Oh Lord Jesus,
[1:19:57] you're so wonderful. Sometimes I feel
[1:19:59] weak, but I know that nobody can pluck
[1:20:02] me out of your hand."
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; How wonderful that is. What a what a
[1:20:08] start to 2016.
[1:20:10] I face this year with courage. I know
[1:20:13] that nobody can pluck me out of his
[1:20:16] hand.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; I face this year with courage because I
[1:20:20] know he's going to stay right with me
[1:20:23] till my and he'll open the scriptures
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; and he'll open my eyes and he'll open my
[1:20:31] understanding and he won't leave me till
[1:20:34] the appointed moment.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:20:41] Lord,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; they told them all of the accounts
[1:20:48] and I never saw this.
[1:20:51] Never meant so much to me as it did
[1:20:53] today.
[1:20:56] When Jesus had to say and I I listened
[1:20:58] to the last services,
[1:21:02] when you listen to those last four
[1:21:04] services,
[1:21:06] you almost see this bleeding heart.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:10] And Jesus said, "Oh fools
[1:21:14] and slow of heart to believe here
[1:21:17] they've related all the things of how
[1:21:20] this one we had looked upon him and we
[1:21:22] had expected him and we expected so much
[1:21:25] out of this message. We expected so much
[1:21:27] out of what you taught us and here we
[1:21:29] are and uh the secretary of the church
[1:21:33] the trustee the secretary whatever he's
[1:21:36] committed suicide
[1:21:38] tried to do betray he betrayed you for
[1:21:40] 30 pieces of silver and and our leader
[1:21:44] gone he'd been crucified with a couple
[1:21:46] of thieves and is is
[1:21:50] has Israel come to a halt no they're
[1:21:53] just going on.
[1:21:56] And now we have another messenger. And
[1:21:59] he says, "They'll just keep coming on.
[1:22:02] They'll you'll just keep going to church
[1:22:03] and they'll just keep coming down and
[1:22:06] believing that they're getting saved
[1:22:08] after the church is gone.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Don't think it's going to be so
[1:22:13] startling that all the graves are going
[1:22:15] to be opened and the dirt's going to be
[1:22:17] flying out of that's not the case.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's a dream world that the religion
[1:22:22] has put upon us. That's not the case.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Said it'll be h it'll they'll slip away.
[1:22:30] They'll be gone. They'll be taken. He's
[1:22:32] talking about the rapture.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And he slipped away and he came back in
[1:22:42] another dimension.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "Oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:22:47] believe all that the prophets have
[1:22:49] spoken."
[1:22:51] Then he says these words,
[1:22:54] "Ought not Christ
[1:22:56] to have suffered these things and to
[1:22:59] enter into his glory
[1:23:02] never meant so much to me, brother Tom,
[1:23:05] as this morning." It was as though I was
[1:23:09] being impressed with that same
[1:23:11] heaviness.
[1:23:15] You speak it,
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; you preach it, the Holy Spirit makes it
[1:23:19] so clear.
[1:23:21] The scriptures are being opened. But now
[1:23:24] I want to speak right to you.
[1:23:28] When he opened the scriptures,
[1:23:31] they said later, "Didn't our hearts burn
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; within us
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; when he talked to us in the way?"
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; So their hearts were burning, but it
[1:23:43] wasn't enough.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I'm giving some instruction. It's not
[1:23:49] enough to come to church and have your
[1:23:51] heart burn
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; you've got to pursue it and continue on
[1:23:56] the journey with him
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and talking to him
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; about the thing that's really on your
[1:24:03] heart.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, stay with me.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Stay with me till my eyes are opened.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Stay with me till I see who you are.
[1:24:14] Stay with me until my mind
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; is open.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I'm human. I know tomorrow morning.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of things.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; We have to do that, do we?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Is it all that important?
[1:24:36] might be better just to tone down a wee
[1:24:38] bit and start this year and say, "Well,
[1:24:43] I'll do what I need to do. I'll do and
[1:24:45] keep life together. I'll
[1:24:48] do
[1:24:50] I I know how some of you give yourself
[1:24:53] to your studies and higher education,
[1:25:00] and I'm not against that."
[1:25:02] Be very clear. I'm not against that. Get
[1:25:05] all education, earn all you can, give
[1:25:08] all you can.
[1:25:10] But I would not say get education at the
[1:25:15] expense of learning these things.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Education will long be gone when this
[1:25:21] will still remain.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; This one is walking with the two on the
[1:25:26] way to Emmas. And I'm here to say to you
[1:25:29] very clearly, he may not be going, you
[1:25:31] may not be going to Emmas, but he's
[1:25:34] going to go where you're going to go.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Don't just you got to stay with me now.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Because I have some words that are very,
[1:25:46] very important. [sighs]
[1:25:49] says, "And two that same day were going
[1:25:51] to Emmas,
[1:25:53] and he went with them."
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; He knew who had been chosen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; He knows who he's called.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; He knows what has brought you here to
[1:26:06] this service. And sometimes it might
[1:26:09] just be an invite. Sometimes it might be
[1:26:13] as far as the natural is concerned it's
[1:26:15] kind of an accident that he doesn't
[1:26:18] operate by accidents. He operates by
[1:26:20] program. He operates by a plan that is
[1:26:24] in the mind of God. I have you here
[1:26:27] because I'm going to go with you and I'm
[1:26:29] going to stay with you and I'm going to
[1:26:32] open up the scriptures to you. I'm going
[1:26:34] to bring them back to your remembrance
[1:26:36] by the Holy Spirit. You're going to
[1:26:39] think upon these things. You're going to
[1:26:40] be may be troubled about these things,
[1:26:43] but I'll make those scriptures real
[1:26:45] until you see it's me. It is none other
[1:26:48] than the living, revealed Jesus Christ.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Once again,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; and furthermore, I'll stay with you
[1:26:55] beyond that.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I know your heart's burning.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I know your heart's burning. And that's
[1:27:01] not enough. I'm going to stay with you.
[1:27:03] Your heart will still continue to burn
[1:27:05] and your eyes will be open. You'll see
[1:27:08] things that your neighbors don't see and
[1:27:10] your family doesn't see. You'll see
[1:27:12] things that's going to anchor you and
[1:27:14] hold you. And beyond that, then I'll
[1:27:17] open up your mind
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; and your understanding.
[1:27:21] And for sure, people will think you're
[1:27:23] crazy.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; For sure. They'll think you went over
[1:27:30] the edge. And you did.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Their hearts
[1:27:41] were burning. Not everyone's was
[1:27:44] burning.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Their hearts were burning.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; That's where you have to settle it. I
[1:27:50] don't know about him or her or them or
[1:27:53] whatever more. I do know one thing. I
[1:27:55] know what's going on here.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm giving myself to that. What is
[1:28:02] going on here is eternal. Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I have met eternal life.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I have met the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:09] himself.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Some of you, this will be new to you.
[1:28:18] Some of you, you've heard it before.
[1:28:23] In in May,
[1:28:26] in the end of March this year is Easter
[1:28:30] and they have the meetings in
[1:28:31] Switzerland.
[1:28:33] And some of you know about
[1:28:36] people have gone from Switzerland.
[1:28:37] Brother Spencer's gone to Switzerland.
[1:28:39] Brother Craig Bur has gone to
[1:28:41] Switzerland. But you know how that
[1:28:43] started?
[1:28:45] I was sitting at my chair at my
[1:28:47] computer.
[1:28:51] You get emails. I get emails.
[1:28:54] So I got an email.
[1:28:59] There's a sister here that was in one of
[1:29:00] those meetings.
[1:29:02] Where's the sister? It's your
[1:29:06] You're in Victoria now. You
[1:29:10] right here. Why don't you just stand
[1:29:13] here? This sister came to one of the
[1:29:14] meetings. What year was that in
[1:29:17] Switzerland?
[1:29:21] What year? Could you say louder?
[1:29:24] Okay.
[1:29:25] I think we had we I think we had been
[1:29:27] about three years and she heard about
[1:29:29] the meetings was going to university in
[1:29:32] Nice France.
[1:29:35] Thank you. And came to the meeting
[1:29:39] and I met her and I thought what a what
[1:29:41] a lovely young lady. So full of life and
[1:29:45] so vibrant and so excited about what God
[1:29:49] was doing. But you know how it happened?
[1:29:51] This is this is just how supernatural it
[1:29:55] is.
[1:29:59] You're just in your daytoday thing.
[1:30:02] You're just doing your work. So I just
[1:30:04] slid up my chair to my computer and turn
[1:30:07] the computer on and opened up my emails
[1:30:11] and there was one there. So I clicked on
[1:30:15] it and it's about that long.
[1:30:19] I don't I don't know who it's from.
[1:30:21] And it just says, uh, uh, I streamed the
[1:30:25] meeting
[1:30:27] and I really enjoyed I enjoyed the
[1:30:30] service. That's how far I got. Now
[1:30:33] listen, friends, I'm not a liar.
[1:30:36] I'm going to tell you exactly what
[1:30:38] happened.
[1:30:39] I heard a voice.
[1:30:43] I heard a voice inside. Not with these
[1:30:45] ears, inside. But these are the exact
[1:30:48] words. This is a wounded one
[1:30:53] and her husband doesn't know she's
[1:30:55] written this.
[1:30:58] Isn't that specific?
[1:31:01] This is a wounded one and her husband
[1:31:04] doesn't know she's written this.
[1:31:07] And then maybe two weeks, three weeks, I
[1:31:09] got another one. Then another two, three
[1:31:11] weeks, I got another one. Maybe got over
[1:31:14] three, four months, I got a few. And
[1:31:16] then one day I opened up the computer.
[1:31:18] same thing. I just opened it up and
[1:31:22] there was quite a long all text. I
[1:31:24] thought, "Woo,
[1:31:26] this is a this is a long text, a lot of
[1:31:28] material."
[1:31:30] And I just started to read
[1:31:34] and the same voice,
[1:31:36] you think he doesn't know exactly
[1:31:38] whatever atmosphere they were in came
[1:31:41] into my study
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; and surrounded me. And I got a heaviness
[1:31:48] from reading. This is a wounded one. I
[1:31:51] felt the wound. I felt I felt the
[1:31:53] darkness. I felt the heaviness.
[1:31:56] And now I'm reading this one. I read
[1:31:58] read about two lines and and the same
[1:32:00] voice, the same atmosphere says, "Now
[1:32:04] her husband knows."
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't that specific?
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen friends. I'm just Brother Ed
[1:32:12] just up here talking to you. That's why
[1:32:15] I said I wasn't going to preach. I'm
[1:32:16] just talking to you.
[1:32:19] I'm telling you as a live witness.
[1:32:22] That's just how real this one who walked
[1:32:25] with the two on the way to Emmas. I
[1:32:28] wasn't walking to Emmas. I was just
[1:32:30] going into my study and sitting down at
[1:32:32] the computer, which I do every day. And
[1:32:35] and and who was there? Who talked? Who
[1:32:38] said those words? I don't know where it
[1:32:40] came from, but I know it was him.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And went there and I said, "Don't tell
[1:32:48] anybody I'm here. I just come here to
[1:32:50] see you. I wanted to see. I never seen
[1:32:52] these people. Never laid eyes on them
[1:32:54] before.
[1:32:57] And you're just doing
[1:33:00] living every day. And now last year was
[1:33:04] 400 people that came. They come from
[1:33:07] Africa. They come from the UK. They came
[1:33:10] from Romania. They came from Croatia.
[1:33:12] They do. You know why? People are
[1:33:14] thirsty.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; People are thirsty for reality.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; They don't want more religion. They want
[1:33:21] something real.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; They want to be introduced to this
[1:33:25] Christ.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; They want to walk with him.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; They want to be told you have somebody
[1:33:30] beside you that you may not be aware of.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm announcing that to you today.
[1:33:37] When you go out those doors, it's not
[1:33:39] going to be the same as you came in
[1:33:41] because you heard a message this
[1:33:42] morning. You heard an account from the
[1:33:44] scripture. You've heard a a messenger
[1:33:47] came in this time and he came and his
[1:33:49] life was so ordained that he said
[1:33:52] certain things at certain times. And he
[1:33:55] started warning the people and telling
[1:33:57] them, you know, because they were
[1:33:58] puzzled. It's no different than the two
[1:34:01] on the way to Emmas. They came to a a
[1:34:03] Christian businessman's convention, but
[1:34:06] they heard the same Lord Jesus telling
[1:34:08] them, "I know where you're at."
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And he's with the Full Gospel
[1:34:15] Businessman's Convention when he's
[1:34:18] talking about leadership,
[1:34:20] his last service.
[1:34:23] And he said, "When you were your mother,
[1:34:27] your old mother probably took your hand
[1:34:29] and took the first step with you.
[1:34:33] and her hands are laying silent today in
[1:34:36] a grave somewhere.
[1:34:41] And then she handed you off to the
[1:34:43] school teacher
[1:34:45] and the school teacher handed you off
[1:34:49] to your father
[1:34:52] and he taught you about business. He's
[1:34:54] talking about businessmen. You became a
[1:34:56] businessman. you became a successful
[1:34:58] businessman.
[1:35:00] And he and the Bible says that when the
[1:35:02] young man came to Jesus, he said, "What
[1:35:04] must I do to have eternal life?" And he
[1:35:07] was talking to eternal life.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He was talking to the possessor. Do you
[1:35:13] hear me? The possessor of eternal life.
[1:35:16] Ask him, "What must I do to inherit
[1:35:18] eternal life?"
[1:35:21] Have you ever asked that?
[1:35:24] What must I do to have eternal life?
[1:35:27] It's nothing to get in the car and start
[1:35:30] the car up and drive to Cloverdale. By
[1:35:33] the way, it's more than that.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; It's more than hearing an exciting
[1:35:37] service. It's more than having being
[1:35:40] pricricked in your heart and having your
[1:35:42] heart burned. I am telling you, if it's
[1:35:44] my last service here, I would tell you
[1:35:46] it's more than that.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to have a burning heart,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; but you have to stay with him. He will.
[1:35:54] I'm announcing to you, he'll stay with
[1:35:56] you. I want you to be aware of who it is
[1:36:00] that's beside you. Who it is that's
[1:36:02] walking and driving with you. He knows
[1:36:05] where your address is.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was just used of God to
[1:36:15] let people know
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; where they were,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; who it was that was beside them. Listen
[1:36:22] to me.
[1:36:24] I'm talking now as a elder that has been
[1:36:28] away a long time.
[1:36:32] When I first went to Switzerland,
[1:36:35] I thought of the message conference with
[1:36:37] God.
[1:36:38] Conference with God. Brother Brandham
[1:36:41] says when there's a conference, I when
[1:36:43] there's a crisis in the world, they call
[1:36:45] a conference. And then men leave their
[1:36:48] families and leave all their business
[1:36:50] and leave everything and they go to to
[1:36:54] where the
[1:36:56] people are aside from everyone
[1:37:00] and they have left all their troubles at
[1:37:02] home and they come to a place maybe a
[1:37:06] very pretty place like perhaps Geneva
[1:37:08] and I said I'm in Geneva.
[1:37:11] I didn't come here to preach a sermon to
[1:37:14] you people. I came here to tell you
[1:37:17] because I knew what God spoke to me in
[1:37:20] my study. I said, "You people are in a
[1:37:22] crisis
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; and you need a conference with God." And
[1:37:28] I knew also we're under an anointing of
[1:37:30] this word of God. This word is the word
[1:37:33] is Jesus Christ.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; We're not out of some seminary or got
[1:37:38] something cooked up out of a book
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; or out of our own mind that won't do it.
[1:37:43] It has to be by the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:46] Something come down and the man of God
[1:37:49] surrender himself to the voice of God
[1:37:51] and speak to the people.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; So I said, "You're in a crisis."
[1:37:59] They sat about 120 quiet
[1:38:03] and I said, "And he's called you for a
[1:38:06] conference." And in that service,
[1:38:10] Brother Brandham starts talking. Now,
[1:38:11] here's a man who has healing healing
[1:38:14] meetings.
[1:38:16] Hundreds of thousands of people come to
[1:38:18] healing meetings. But he says to the
[1:38:21] doctors, such a fine man. And he says,
[1:38:25] "And they labor, they study, and they
[1:38:27] labor to make life easier for the
[1:38:29] people.
[1:38:30] And the doctor will take his patient and
[1:38:33] deal with that patient and
[1:38:36] [clears throat] do everything he can to
[1:38:38] make life easier." and he talks and he
[1:38:40] speaks so nice and then he goes on
[1:38:43] starts to preach maybe for an hour and a
[1:38:45] half. Are you listening sir?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; And when he's done they call a prayer
[1:38:50] line and the first person I happen to
[1:38:53] know something about the minister and
[1:38:55] the first person that stands there he's
[1:38:56] just quiet
[1:38:58] and brother Brandham's first words are
[1:39:00] you believe doctor don't you?
[1:39:05] What are you going to do with that?
[1:39:06] Yeah.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? Well, there's
[1:39:09] another accident. Are we just going from
[1:39:11] accident to accident? Or is this a plan?
[1:39:13] Is this a program?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Is this something that God is doing to
[1:39:18] catch our attention?
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm just a simple man, but he
[1:39:26] caught my attention.
[1:39:30] Brother Jean Manasse, you asked me,
[1:39:34] "When did I see Malachi 4?"
[1:39:38] He just told he talked about John
[1:39:41] in Malachi 4 before the great and
[1:39:43] dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:39:45] And I was in such a state I was like the
[1:39:48] two men on the way to Emmas. I said,
[1:39:50] "This thing, where's this great sweep?
[1:39:53] Where's this great revival? Where are
[1:39:55] all these great things happening? It's
[1:39:57] all going downhill.
[1:40:00] I said, "Where is it all?" When he
[1:40:03] talked about Malachi 4, I said, "Of
[1:40:05] course. Of course." And that was the
[1:40:08] only ministry that fit it.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Friends, all I can tell you
[1:40:18] is that he came to me.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; We sing that song, He came to me. And
[1:40:24] when you sing it next time and perhaps
[1:40:26] we'll sing it at the end of this
[1:40:27] service. I want you to say within your
[1:40:30] heart,
[1:40:31] repeat his words. He came to me
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and he's not going to leave me
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; until what I have heard is quickened.
[1:40:42] Until my heart burned when I was in that
[1:40:45] service listening to that man preaching.
[1:40:48] I'm not interested in trying to convince
[1:40:50] a whole congregation. I know that maybe
[1:40:52] it's one, maybe it's two, maybe it's
[1:40:54] more that your heart is going to burn.
[1:40:57] And I'm going to instruct you now when
[1:40:59] you leave this place, you say, "Oh,
[1:41:01] spirit of God, you caused my heart to
[1:41:04] burn. I don't understand much of what
[1:41:07] was said. I don't understand a lot of
[1:41:09] the things, but do stay with me. Stay
[1:41:13] with me till my eyes are opened. Stay
[1:41:16] with me till I know you. Stay with me
[1:41:19] till my understanding is open.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; I need my understanding open.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of folks that remembered
[1:41:30] Christmas.
[1:41:32] It came upon a midnight clear.
[1:41:36] They sing about the angels and they sing
[1:41:38] about the manger and they sing about all
[1:41:40] of these things.
[1:41:42] But the Christ
[1:41:45] of that manger
[1:41:48] haven't met him.
[1:41:52] Do I have a little more time?
[1:41:57] I'm not going to keep you very long
[1:42:00] because I know this is a heavy duty
[1:42:04] message.
[1:42:17] I know that I speak to perhaps most of
[1:42:20] the people here when I say
[1:42:23] there's an area of your life
[1:42:28] that perhaps is troubled about
[1:42:30] something.
[1:42:33] Everybody has a burden.
[1:42:36] Everybody has a concern.
[1:42:40] I wonder how many people would like to
[1:42:44] raise their hands and say, "I I do I
[1:42:46] have a burden." Maybe it's a personal
[1:42:48] burden. Maybe it's a family burden. But
[1:42:50] I have a burden. I'm thinking about all
[1:42:53] across
[1:42:55] I have both hands up. I have a burden.
[1:43:01] I was blessed yesterday
[1:43:05] when I saw a word and the prophet Isaiah
[1:43:09] spoke it and he said with stammering
[1:43:12] lips
[1:43:14] and when tongues
[1:43:16] stammering lips and with tongues, how
[1:43:19] does that say that? Stammering lips and
[1:43:22] with stammering tongues.
[1:43:25] He said
[1:43:28] and in the time of refreshment
[1:43:33] and I I I wanted to find out as more
[1:43:36] than refreshments as we sorry you know
[1:43:38] have some refreshments but the
[1:43:41] refreshment is actually the peace.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I said amen.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to the congregation this
[1:43:49] morning and say here is the peace.
[1:43:53] [applause]
[1:43:54] This message brings you the peace.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; If you believe every word of it, it will
[1:44:00] bring you peace.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be distressed about
[1:44:04] this and the other thing that happens in
[1:44:06] life because the one who's walking with
[1:44:09] you, he didn't live in Emmas, but he was
[1:44:12] going to Emmas. He may not live in
[1:44:14] Bellingham or in Blaine or in Suriri,
[1:44:18] but he's going wherever you're going.
[1:44:23] And he's the refreshment.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; He's the Sabbath.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; He's the peace.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; He's the revealed word. And he already
[1:44:31] has sent a messenger to reveal that
[1:44:34] word. And I can tell you, we are in the
[1:44:37] season of the revelation of the word. I
[1:44:40] say to this congregation, in the name of
[1:44:42] the Lord God Almighty, turn the corner.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Don't stay on. You can stay on in your
[1:44:52] religion or this religion. You can stay
[1:44:55] on forever. We're not going to build a
[1:44:57] wall 2016. We're not going to continue
[1:45:01] building a wall. We're going to inform
[1:45:03] the people of the corner.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus went with them to inform
[1:45:10] them, to conduct them around the corner.
[1:45:14] And uh I'm saying something to you. It's
[1:45:17] not just a curve. It's a sharp one.
[1:45:22] It's a sharp curve.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; A corner is a corner.
[1:45:29] He said it takes a real master Mason,
[1:45:33] there's nobody, no human that could turn
[1:45:36] that corner. I can tell you in the name
[1:45:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who
[1:45:40] directed this word, this message to even
[1:45:43] come in the fashion that it came for
[1:45:46] certain things to be introduced. He
[1:45:48] started to introduce in in uh in in
[1:45:51] about 12 months before his lips were
[1:45:53] sealed that there are corner and I need
[1:45:56] a mason to build a corner. You can go on
[1:46:00] in a straight wall. You can go to a
[1:46:03] seminary and say the same thing and
[1:46:06] build a tradition around anything and
[1:46:09] and talk about the godhead or whatever
[1:46:11] more. But when you turn the corner then
[1:46:14] you get some specifics. Yeah,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; it's a blueprint that comes out. You got
[1:46:19] to turn a corner. And we have turned a
[1:46:21] corner.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "We're at the corner in the
[1:46:24] rapture." And we're in the 50th year
[1:46:27] Jubilee from that time. And I will tell
[1:46:29] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, the
[1:46:31] corner's been turned. And he's here now
[1:46:34] presently to conduct us around the
[1:46:37] corner in our faith and in our belief
[1:46:40] that we can say, "Oh Lord, I've heard
[1:46:43] things." I only want to get one thing
[1:46:45] across to you today. If you hear
[1:46:47] something and the Holy Spirit I can't do
[1:46:50] it, but if the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:46:53] and causes a burning inside your heart,
[1:46:57] a burning that you can't explain, then
[1:47:00] be it known to you, that burning didn't
[1:47:03] come from me. That burning didn't come
[1:47:05] from these brothers. That burning didn't
[1:47:08] come from the song leader. That burden
[1:47:10] came, that burning came from the Holy
[1:47:13] Spirit.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; And that is the one that is with you.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And that is the one that will not leave
[1:47:18] you.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to to turn your attention to
[1:47:22] him. And when you leave this building,
[1:47:25] you say, "Oh Jesus, you that caused this
[1:47:28] burning, stay with me.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Stay with me.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Stay near me.
[1:47:39] Keep talking to me
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; until my eyes are opened
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; and I come to a whole new level
[1:47:51] of seeing you.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; And stay with me. Continue on. Pray
[1:47:59] Brother Ed's prayer. Stay with me till
[1:48:02] my understanding is expanded.
[1:48:06] until I know what it is that you said.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; If you trust just this little brain,
[1:48:15] don't forget it's just a teaspoon of
[1:48:17] ashes.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; It'll never figure out the way for you.
[1:48:21] But trust him.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Trust him.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; And he'll do two things. Number one,
[1:48:28] he'll stay with you.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Number one, he'll go with you to your
[1:48:34] place of residence.
[1:48:36] He will stay. He knows all about your
[1:48:38] problem. He knows all about the
[1:48:39] heaviness. He knows all about those
[1:48:42] things. And he knows what you still need
[1:48:44] to know.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And he'll conduct you around this curve
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; from mortal. I trust that 2016
[1:48:55] is when we can be conducted
[1:48:58] in a rapture
[1:49:00] from mortal season
[1:49:04] to immortal. Won't
[1:49:08] that be wonderful?
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I'll ask brother Ryan to come
[1:49:16] and I want to sing. He came to me,
[1:49:20] but let's bow our heads, please.
[1:49:25] Heavenly Father,
[1:49:28] I sense it would be a strange time.
[1:49:34] Perhaps a strange meeting.
[1:49:38] This is the first of this year and we
[1:49:40] know that you are timeless.
[1:49:43] You're not conscious and you're not
[1:49:45] restricted to our time and our our
[1:49:49] watches and yet you have set everything
[1:49:51] in motion. All the galaxies and the
[1:49:53] planets
[1:49:55] and you are conscious
[1:49:58] of the things that have taken place. And
[1:50:00] I believe that Jesus Christ was born
[1:50:03] exactly when he should be born. [music]
[1:50:07] He lived his life. He was guided by all
[1:50:10] things that the father showed him.
[1:50:12] [music] And he guided his life. And at
[1:50:16] the end of his life, he begins to speak
[1:50:17] very differently. He begins to speak his
[1:50:20] third pull. And the prophet refers to it
[1:50:24] so much [music] in the when souls were
[1:50:27] in prison.
[1:50:29] When they thought you were on the cross
[1:50:31] or maybe in the tomb, you preached to
[1:50:34] the souls that were in prison to verify
[1:50:37] and confirm Noah's message was true.
[1:50:41] Abraham's message was true. The apostles
[1:50:45] and the disciples or rather the prophets
[1:50:48] of the Old Testament, their message was
[1:50:50] true. and you came that living Christ
[1:50:54] all down through and confirmed that it
[1:50:56] was true and you emptied out paradise.
[1:50:59] And Lord, we're facing something like
[1:51:01] that. We're facing something like that
[1:51:04] now.
[1:51:06] Oh God,
[1:51:08] when the walking that are walking on the
[1:51:10] face of the earth, we know not about who
[1:51:14] is who is yours and who is not yours,
[1:51:17] but we know one thing. We must know
[1:51:19] within ourselves,
[1:51:21] you have called me
[1:51:24] and I'm on the way to Emmas. I may not
[1:51:26] be on the way to Emmas, but today
[1:51:29] perhaps I need to go to West Vancouver
[1:51:31] or North Vancouver or Burnaby or Surrey
[1:51:35] or Langley or Abbottzford or Lynen or
[1:51:38] Bellingham or Blaine or Tacoma, Seattle.
[1:51:43] Lord [music] Jesus, let this be known
[1:51:46] that you shall be there.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; You are here presently and you will not
[1:51:52] leave them.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; You will stay with them. Open our eyes
[1:51:57] and open our understanding
[1:51:59] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:02] I wonder who needs to [music] be prayed
[1:52:04] for. And you want to simply stand where
[1:52:08] you are. Or you may want to come and
[1:52:11] [music] stand here
[1:52:13] and join with me.
[1:52:16] Oh God.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And he went with them.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; The people need you.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; I know [music] they need you.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Conduct us around this curve, Lord.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Conduct us around this corner. Oh God,
[1:52:36] this incredible corner from life, from
[1:52:40] this mortal life to the immortal.
[1:52:43] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:52:46] pray for everyone who has the same
[1:52:48] hunger, the same craving, I pray,
[1:52:52] Father, that you will visit them now.
[1:52:57] Come to them now in our own personal
[1:52:59] way.
[1:53:01] Speak, Lord.
[1:53:03] speak for you are a God that speaks.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; You are also a God that hears, so we
[1:53:09] will speak.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; We will pray and you shall hear.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; You will answer for you love to answer.
[1:53:19] You love to do things for your children.
[1:53:22] Oh God, let this not be just another
[1:53:24] service when people just pray or when
[1:53:27] they would come forward or stand or
[1:53:30] whatever, but may it be indeed indeed
[1:53:33] indelible indelibly marked upon their
[1:53:36] mind. [music]
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus, you are alive.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; You are present.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; We believe in the message that you sent
[1:53:45] through your messenger.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; We believe the order of the word was
[1:53:49] perfect. We believe that the rapture
[1:53:52] message means more than just a message.
[1:53:56] There's a great time, oh God. We are
[1:53:59] awaiting it. We are your children. We
[1:54:03] are awaiting this moment. We've been
[1:54:05] anticipating it. We're not interested in
[1:54:09] just having church. We're not interested
[1:54:11] in just having a school or a camp. We
[1:54:14] want to go home. Oh God, we desire to go
[1:54:18] home.
[1:54:20] We desire to go home.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless your name, Lord.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord Jesus. [music]
[1:54:31] How lovely you are. I wonder, brother
[1:54:34] Ryan, if we would sing and the [music]
[1:54:36] people we can sing together, he came to
[1:54:39] me.
[1:54:44] [music]
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; When I could not [music and singing]
[1:54:59] come
[1:55:00] to where he was,
[1:55:04] he came to [music] me.
[1:55:11] That's why he died. [singing and music]
[1:55:15] That's why he died on
[1:55:19] [music]
[1:55:24] [singing]
[1:55:27] [music]
[1:55:28] where he was.
[1:55:31] He [singing] came to [music] me.
[1:55:34] You've had your hearts burning now. He
[1:55:37] came. [music]
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; That's why he come.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; He sees that deep thing in your heart.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. [music]
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; He sees a heavy heart.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; He sees the questions.
[1:55:58] [music]
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; You glad
[1:56:01] he came to me. To me.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; That's why he
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; That's why he died
[1:56:09] on Calary.
[1:56:13] Calvary. That's why he died. [music]
[1:56:17] [singing]
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; He came to [music] me.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Let him hear your voice in just a
[1:56:28] moment, but I want to ask. I don't know
[1:56:30] among you where he came to you, [music]
[1:56:33] but this word came to me as I sat on a
[1:56:36] log. Not very not very
[1:56:40] a glorious or glamorous thing. I'm in my
[1:56:42] old work clothes. [music]
[1:56:45] I'm just sitting on a log. But he came
[1:56:48] to me. I poured out my heart. How is it
[1:56:51] all this um [music] this anointing and
[1:56:55] this this preaching and this thing that
[1:56:57] I see, how is it that it's failing and
[1:57:01] people aren't able to live the life? Let
[1:57:03] me tell you friends, I have with all the
[1:57:06] strength that's in me. There's a
[1:57:07] strength in this word. You can live that
[1:57:10] life. You just surrender yourself to
[1:57:13] him. Call upon him even now. He'll come
[1:57:16] to you. Maybe this is your turn. Maybe
[1:57:19] this is your time. Perhaps you heard
[1:57:21] something and say, "Lord, the burning is
[1:57:24] taking place. [music]
[1:57:25] Come to this burning soul. Oh Lord
[1:57:27] Jesus, make yourself known." Now that I
[1:57:30] might say, "I see him. I see him."
[1:57:35] [music]
[1:57:37] Once again,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; to me.
[1:57:46] [music and singing]
[1:57:52] When I could not come to where he was,
[1:57:58] [singing and music]
[1:57:59] he came to me.
[1:58:05] And that's why [music]
[1:58:07] he died. [singing]
[1:58:10] Just pray and ask him.
[1:58:15] [music and singing]
[1:58:20] [music and singing]
[1:58:22] to where he was
[1:58:25] he to
[1:58:28] come to my soul. Precious Jesus, [music]
[1:58:34] come [singing]
[1:58:36] [music] to my soul.
[1:58:39] Precious Jesus,
[1:58:42] my Lord, [singing and music]
[1:58:45] hear me.

[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; mountain [singing]
[1:59:00] [music]
[1:59:02] me.
[1:59:05] [singing]
[1:59:06] [music]
[1:59:10] [singing]
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Pray like you never prayed before.
[1:59:13] [music] Oh, come
[1:59:16] to my [singing] soul.
[1:59:19] Precious Jesus,
[1:59:21] my Lord, my Lord. [music]
[1:59:27] [singing]
[1:59:31] [music]
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; He's listening.
[1:59:34] [singing]
[1:59:38] [music]
[1:59:42] [singing]
[1:59:43] [music]
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Pass me on a gentle savior. He won't
[1:59:54] pass you by. He's going to walk right
[1:59:56] with you. Roy, [music]
[1:59:58] this is reality.
[2:00:01] How many believes that it's a reality?
[2:00:04] [music] Pass me now. Oh, gentle savior.
[2:00:07] Listen, some of you that may not, you
[2:00:09] just have a burning in your heart. Say,
[2:00:11] I I've been so touched. There's more for
[2:00:14] you just now.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; call and he said he will answer
[2:00:24] [music]
[2:00:27] me not [music]
[2:00:30] to say
[2:00:34] [singing and music]
[2:00:38] my Heat. Heat. Heat. [music and singing]

[2:03:01] [singing]
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Blessed [music] Lord Jesus.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; I'm so privileged to call your name.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; His name shall be called Jesus. [music]
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; For he shall save his people from their
[2:03:19] sins.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; There's a group of people here today,
[2:03:23] Lord. this audience of people. Thank
[2:03:25] you, Jesus.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; They've come to this church service to
[2:03:28] hear something of you. And Lord Jesus, I
[2:03:32] seek to lift you up. You're the one
[2:03:34] that's directing us. Here we are at this
[2:03:37] great time of the ending of the Gentile
[2:03:39] dispensation. [music] You have sent such
[2:03:42] a word. Oh God, we will not miss it. We
[2:03:46] will not miss it. We've embraced it. We
[2:03:49] love it, oh God. And we pray that you'll
[2:03:52] open to us the scriptures.
[2:03:55] Open to us the scriptures. There may be
[2:03:58] some, Lord, that have not had it opened.
[2:04:01] I say on behalf of those to whom it's
[2:04:03] not been opened, you [music] pray with
[2:04:05] me now as I say, may the scriptures be
[2:04:08] open to them by the Holy Ghost. Open the
[2:04:13] scriptures. Speak out of the scriptures.
[2:04:16] And then father stay with us till we
[2:04:19] come to our place to our home. We love
[2:04:23] you. You're the king of our house, king
[2:04:25] of our life. Oh God, come in. Eat with
[2:04:29] us. Be in our place. Be at our table. Be
[2:04:33] in our conversation.
[2:04:36] Oh God,
[2:04:38] stay with us till our eyes are open. Oh
[2:04:41] God. And not only our eyes open, stay
[2:04:44] with us, Lord. before you leave. Stay
[2:04:48] with us, oh God. And your word says,
[2:04:50] "And you blessed them and departed from
[2:04:53] them." Stay with us, Lord. Open our
[2:04:56] understanding. I pray in the name of
[2:04:59] Jesus Christ. For everyone that is
[2:05:02] standing here, [music] for everyone in
[2:05:04] the audience, in the name of Jesus
[2:05:07] Christ, grip Cloverdale Bible Way with a
[2:05:11] mighty sweep of the Holy Spirit. Oh God,
[2:05:14] I pray in your name. [music]
[2:05:17] This year will be a transformation year,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; a changing year.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Let it be a rapture year. This is my
[2:05:25] desire. Let us go, God, to our eternal
[2:05:30] home. How? We do not know. And just when
[2:05:33] we do not know, but we say we're ready.
[2:05:37] We're ready. We're ready. Let everyone
[2:05:40] say we're ready. We're ready to go.
[2:05:43] Thank you, Father. In a moment, in a
[2:05:45] twinkling of an eye. Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, how I love
[2:05:57] Jesus. And with that, we'll be
[2:05:59] dismissed. [music] Oh, how I love Jesus.

[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus.

[2:07:21] people.
[2:07:23] If you haven't sensed him,
[2:07:26] [music] here's my instruction.
[2:07:28] When you leave here, you continue to
[2:07:30] talk about him
[2:07:33] and you ask him, "Come [music] to me,
[2:07:36] Lord. You see exactly where I'm at. I
[2:07:40] haven't really felt anything. I didn't
[2:07:42] sense anything, but I know that [music]
[2:07:44] you're true. I believe in it. I believe
[2:07:47] in you. And he'll come come to me.
[2:07:50] [music] And then stay with me
[2:07:54] in Jesus name. God bless you all. You're
[2:07:58] [music] dismissed in the name of Jesus
[2:08:00] Christ.
[2:08:02] And we want to have a truly happy year.
[2:08:07] I want to meet you on the [music] other
[2:08:08] side.
[2:08:10] and I'll say happy eternity.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
