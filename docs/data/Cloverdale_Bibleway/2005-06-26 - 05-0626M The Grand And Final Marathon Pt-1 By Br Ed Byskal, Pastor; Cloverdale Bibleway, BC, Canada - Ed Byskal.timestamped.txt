[10:03] to prayer this time. Ask Brother Chris.
[10:06] Brother Chris, if you'd come and
[10:08] open the service in a word of prayer.
[10:11] Got two testimonies here. Brother Elliot
[10:14] says, "I would like to thank you for
[10:15] praying for my daughter and most of all,
[10:17] I would like to thank God because she is
[10:19] starting to recover." Just praise his
[10:21] name. Sister Millia has a testimony
[10:25] here. She gives thanks to God for she
[10:28] had surgery on her ears and all went
[10:29] well. Redhead had prayed with her.
[10:34] We want to remember brother Jose as he's
[10:37] at home with the fever and sore throat.
[10:39] Please pray for his healing. Jennifer
[10:42] Johnson
[10:44] requesting prayer for her cousin Norma
[10:47] who's having surgery tomorrow for cancer
[10:49] and she's asked that we remember her in
[10:51] prayer and we also desire that God would
[10:53] use this situation situation to draw her
[10:56] to himself.
[10:58] Also we want to pray for sister Marcy as
[11:01] she's at home sick not well in body
[11:05] and brother Nathan
[11:07] Hilly Brandt is asking prayer. Please
[11:09] remember brother Walter Hildebrandt and
[11:12] his family as they are having great
[11:15] difficulty finding a care home to look
[11:17] after their autistic son. So just ask
[11:20] that we'd remember them in prayer. If
[11:22] you have a need on your heart you hear a
[11:25] telephone on the internet just raise
[11:27] your hand as we go to prayer. Brother
[11:28] Chris if you come.
[11:34] [Music]
[11:37] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[11:39] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[11:42] Oh, we praise your name this morning, oh
[11:45] Lord. We give you honor. We give you
[11:48] praise, Father. We count it honor to
[11:51] come before your throne this morning,
[11:53] Lord. And Father, to lay all our cares
[11:57] down before your throne. For you said
[12:00] you care for us, oh Lord.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; And Father, you see the hearts that are
[12:04] in this building. You see the hearts
[12:07] that are in the internet and on the
[12:09] hookups. Oh God, you said you're

[12:25] time.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; And we give you glory, Lord Jesus. We
[12:29] give you honor, oh God.
[12:31] Father, we just thank you for this
[12:33] opportunity.
[12:35] And Father, you see the needs that have
[12:37] been spoken. And Father, we just ask
[12:40] that you touch each and every one of
[12:42] these needs right now, Lord Jesus.
[12:46] Father, we have fevers. Father, we have
[12:49] um loved ones, Lord Jesus.
[12:53] Father, we even have dear ones here in
[12:55] the body, Lord. But you see the body
[12:57] that's all around the world, Lord Jesus.
[13:00] And Father, 1 Peter 2:24
[13:03] and and Isaiah 53:5 says that by your
[13:06] stripes they are all healed. And father,
[13:09] we believe because you rose again on the
[13:12] cross that all things are healed and
[13:15] come whole in the name of Jesus. As I
[13:18] touch these prayer requests, oh God, I
[13:20] ask you, Lord Jesus, to just have p send
[13:24] your power, send your mercy, send your

[13:37] And father, we have a uh the unspoken
[13:39] requests Lord. Father, you see those
[13:41] right now in the hearts of the people.

[13:51] needs your love, Lord Jesus. And you
[13:54] really know really what's going on in

[17:37] behind
[17:38] [Music]
[17:41] him.
[17:43] [Music]
[18:19] Stones are a
[18:22] stones are a confession. Stones are
[18:25] memorials.
[18:26] The capstone is Jesus Christ. The chief
[18:29] cornerstone is Jesus Christ.
[18:33] Joshua 4 5-7. And Joshua said unto them,
[18:37] "Pass over before the ark of the Lord
[18:38] your God into the midst of Jordan, and
[18:41] take ye up every man of you a stone upon
[18:43] his shoulder, according to the number of
[18:45] the tribes of the children of Israel,
[18:47] that this may be a sign among you, that
[18:49] when your children ask their fathers in
[18:51] time to come, saying, "What mean ye by
[18:53] these stones?" Then you shall answer
[18:55] them that the water of Jordan, the
[18:57] waters of Jordan were cut off before the
[18:59] ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it
[19:01] was passed over Jordan, the waters of
[19:03] Jordan were cut off, and these stones
[19:05] shall be for memorial unto the children
[19:07] of Israel forever.
[19:11] Daniel said, I saw a stone hewed out of
[19:14] the mountain without hands, and it
[19:16] rolled into the kingdoms of this world
[19:17] and broke them to pieces, and they
[19:20] blowed away like chaff upon a summer's
[19:22] threshing floor. and a stone grow into a
[19:25] great mountain that covered all the
[19:26] earth. That's what he said about him.
[19:29] Therefore, he will rule the world
[19:31] someday. People are struggling today for
[19:33] a world ruler. Each nation wants their
[19:36] language. There their thoughts. Each
[19:39] denomination wants their groups over the
[19:41] other. But there's coming one that will
[19:43] be Jesus Christ. He is the ruler of the
[19:45] universe. Nonetheless, God himself.
[19:52] Jesus saith unto them, "Did ye never
[19:54] read the scriptures, the stone which the
[19:56] builders rejected? The same has become
[19:58] the head of the corner. This is the
[20:00] Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our
[20:02] eyes." That stone the that Christ Jesus,
[20:05] that stumbling stone to the world, a
[20:07] stone of an offense, a laughing stone, a
[20:10] stumbling block to the church, but a
[20:12] precious and a low stone to a believer,
[20:14] a stone of an assurance, a stone of
[20:16] rest.
[20:31] [Music]
[20:44] Daniel saw that stone that was out of
[20:48] the mountain.
[20:50] Daniel saw that stone that went down.
[20:56] Daniel saw that stone that was out of
[21:02] tearing out the kingdom of this world.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:08] I'm looking for that stone that was
[21:12] here.
[21:13] [Music]
[21:15] Looking for that stone that came out of
[21:19] Babylon.
[21:21] Looking for that stone that was down
[21:27] the kingdom of this world.
[21:32] Jesus is that stone that was down.
[21:38] Jesus is that stone that came rolling
[21:42] down to Babylon.
[21:44] Jesus is that stoing
[21:47] [Music]
[21:51] out the kingdom of this world.
[21:54] [Music]
[21:56] I'm glad I found that stone that was
[22:00] a mountain. I'm glad I found that stone
[22:04] that went down.
[22:08] I'm glad I found that stone that was
[22:12] mag.
[22:14] [Music]
[22:30] [Music]
[22:43] There is a flag
[22:47] from the castle of my heart. From the
[22:51] castle of my heart. From the castle of
[22:55] my heart. There is a flag.
[22:59] From the castle of my heart
[23:03] into prejudice there.
[23:08] Let it fly in the sky. Let the whole
[23:12] world know. Let the whole world know.
[23:17] Let the whole world know. Let it fly in
[23:22] the sky. Let the whole world know that
[23:26] the king is in president.
[23:29] [Music]
[23:32] The flag
[23:35] from the castle of my heart. From the
[23:39] castle of my heart. From the castle of
[23:43] my heart. There is a flow. From the
[23:47] castle of my heart. And the king is in
[23:52] president.
[23:55] Let it fly in the sky. Let the whole
[24:00] world know. Let the whole world know.
[24:04] Let the whole world know. Let it fly in
[24:09] the sky. Let the whole world know that
[24:13] the king is in preidence.
[24:29] [Applause]
[24:35] Whole stack of lively stones here.
[24:38] You don't think they're lively stones.
[24:40] Come help us out in Sunday school for a
[24:41] while.
[24:43] These children have done immensely
[24:46] huge and well beyond our expectation
[24:49] things this year. And um every year
[24:52] there's always a little something to
[24:53] tell. And I I know that this is our our
[24:56] our day of the year which we present the
[24:58] missionary offering that they've
[24:59] collected their pennies, nickels, and
[25:01] dimes over the year. And um but while
[25:05] the main body of the Sunday school were
[25:07] collecting their little things, uh we
[25:10] had another classroom that uh was
[25:12] collecting for uh for a special little
[25:17] missionary project. Out in the in the uh
[25:20] lobby here, we've got this thermometer
[25:22] that's slowly going up. I think it was
[25:24] about a year and a half ago, we wanted
[25:26] to put uh print a million books. It was
[25:28] going to take place in the Congo. Was 10
[25:30] cents US a book. And so, Brother Mike
[25:32] Ganyy's class took it on themselves to
[25:35] uh see what they could do to further
[25:37] that along. And you know, it's
[25:38] interesting in the scripture that just
[25:40] about the time things started to get
[25:41] complicated, uh the disciples were given
[25:44] power to go out and preach the gospel
[25:46] and they were coming back happy that
[25:47] even the demons were subject unto them
[25:49] and all the rest. And then they were a
[25:50] little upset because some guy that
[25:51] wasn't in their group was he, you know,
[25:54] preaching uh in healing in the name of
[25:56] Jesus. And and all these things were
[25:58] taking place. Jesus took a little child
[26:01] and he stuck it right in the middle of
[26:02] the disciples and he said except you
[26:04] become as one of these and you know he
[26:07] just brought everything down so simple
[26:09] and with children it is so simple and
[26:10] you ask them to do something and they
[26:12] get the idea they catch the vision then
[26:14] they go I'll do that so brother Mike uh
[26:17] got these kids going on uh in Canada
[26:20] here if you find a pop can it's worth a
[26:22] nickel and if you find three of them
[26:23] with the exchange rate the way it has
[26:25] been up and down you have a message book
[26:28] so it was a bottles for books campaign
[26:31] they took off on. Well, our folks in the
[26:33] states, they they don't get to do that.
[26:36] So, consequently, um uh they invented
[26:38] all kinds of ingenious ways of doing
[26:40] things. And I know even with my own son,
[26:42] we went to clean a bedroom and uh he
[26:44] declared as we started that every
[26:46] nickel, dime, penny that was in that
[26:47] room that he found lying on the floor
[26:49] belonged in that mission box because
[26:51] they took it personally. They just it
[26:52] was so simple. It was just if it's money
[26:54] lying around, it's going to make a book.
[26:56] And in fact, one one family had a uh
[27:00] money for behavior situation and uh one
[27:02] young fellow got enough funds to get to
[27:04] do 494 books on his own.
[27:07] So uh he was a well behaved little boy.
[27:10] Um Sister Lillian has a poster for us.
[27:13] You want to come forward, Sister
[27:14] Lillian? This class put together enough
[27:16] funds to make 4,323
[27:20] books.
[27:31] Anyway, and that's over and above what
[27:33] we intended to do. And um brother Tony
[27:36] made a me a need known to the Sunday
[27:38] school this year about um the ministers
[27:41] in India. They would like to um they
[27:44] wanted to be able to have a little bit
[27:46] of transportation to get around, deliver
[27:47] the uh books, do some more evangelistic
[27:50] work, and of course they walk everywhere
[27:51] they go. Um, and it brought back to mind
[27:55] what I often quote when I'm doing things
[27:57] for men of visions work, which is
[27:58] Galatians 6:9 and 10. And of course,
[28:01] Galatians 6:10 is, "As we have therefore
[28:03] opportunity, let us do good unment,
[28:06] especially to them who are of the
[28:07] household of faith." And so, these
[28:09] children took it upon themselves. We
[28:11] told them what we wanted. We wanted to
[28:12] go for about 10 books and or probably 10
[28:15] bikes. And, uh, they're about $54 US a
[28:19] piece over there. And so, um, well, I
[28:22] just left it with the children. And now
[28:24] I'm going to get brother Daryl if he'll
[28:25] come on down and take the box. Brother
[28:27] Bisl, if I could get you to come
[28:29] forward.
[28:30] And where's our sister Emily? Can bring
[28:32] down the envelope. And we'll have
[28:34] Brother Biscll read you the total.
[28:38] Actually, that's better on the floor.
[28:41] Gravity has a way with things. There we
[28:43] go.
[28:46] Sometimes I think I wish I had a drum
[28:48] roll here, you know, not the one for the
[28:50] approaching event, but rather the death
[28:51] march because we're fixing to blow the
[28:52] devil out of the water.
[29:16] Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School
[29:18] Missionary Offering 2004205.
[29:22] The Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School
[29:24] Missionary Offering for the 2004205
[29:27] Sunday school year goes to India. We
[29:30] endeavored to supply bicycles for
[29:32] ministers in India to help mobilize the
[29:36] spreading of the gospel and printed
[29:38] Christian materials.
[29:40] Brother Tony Abbma said it would cost
[29:42] around $54 US for one bicycle. So, the
[29:46] Sunday school wished to supply 10. They
[29:49] have collected over $1,000 in mixed
[29:52] currency and have achieved approximately
[29:56] the purchase of am the amount purchase
[29:58] amount of 17 bicycles.
[30:13] I would like to say on behalf of the
[30:15] church and on behalf of those that are
[30:18] in India and in Congo and those that
[30:21] will hold a book in their hand, I want
[30:23] to say to the all the Sunday school
[30:26] children,
[30:28] great is your reward in heaven.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Great is your reward.
[30:34] God bless you.
[30:41] And to brother Richard, I think he's
[30:42] done a master masterpiece of a job. God
[30:46] bless you, brother.
[30:51] Hallelujah.
[30:53] God bless uh all who sung and uh and God
[30:58] bless you for taking that thing away
[31:00] again. That's sister Elizabeth, brother
[31:03] Jeremy. Lovely. We enjoyed it so much.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:13] You can show us some appreciation.
[31:16] We clap our hands. We're saying thank
[31:18] you,
[31:19] &gt;&gt; saying, "God bless you."
[31:21] &gt;&gt; And you can remember when you see these
[31:24] young people and children passing in the
[31:26] foyer, they may seem like they have
[31:29] their own direction.
[31:31] uh they're they're busy with their own
[31:33] friends, their own peers,
[31:35] but uh you'd be surprised what's down in
[31:38] their heart. And every once in a while
[31:40] it it comes out. But as they get older,
[31:44] I can assure you that you'll never never
[31:48] regret having had your children in this
[31:52] atmosphere.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it. Sometimes it
[31:56] costs uh extra energy on your part,
[32:00] maybe to get them to school, for
[32:02] example, or to have them here a little
[32:04] bit earlier for Sunday school, which
[32:07] starts just a wee bit early, and then
[32:11] we like to have them in the service
[32:13] during the preaching of the word. Some
[32:16] churches don't do that. They have the
[32:18] children out all during the uh service
[32:21] and I don't think that's right because
[32:24] you and I do not know how much they
[32:28] absorb
[32:30] &gt;&gt; and they they have they're sensitive and
[32:32] they can absorb things uh even without
[32:35] fully understanding them. They don't
[32:37] have to understand them, but they absorb
[32:39] an atmosphere. They absorb a presence of
[32:42] the Lord. And uh we're we're really
[32:46] really grateful. We're grateful for all
[32:48] the teachers and those that have put out
[32:50] such an effort for it. But you take the
[32:53] world and those that are in
[32:57] uh in sports or any kind of uh activity
[33:03] whether it be drama or whether it be you
[33:06] know any kind of sports activity. Uh
[33:10] I've had relatives and they will get I
[33:12] in fact is I have a cousin and all she
[33:15] had was boys. She had a bunch of boys.
[33:18] She had a set of twins and then another
[33:20] son. I think she had another set of
[33:22] twins. Anyway, she ended up with five
[33:24] boys I think it was. She they were in
[33:27] hockey and in practice and they'd be
[33:31] practicing late.
[33:33] The country was cold in the winter time
[33:36] in the Midwest. She said that get home
[33:39] about 1:00 1:30 in the morning from the
[33:42] older boys and some of them had to get
[33:43] up at 6:00 in the morning. She'd just
[33:45] leave her car running out in the
[33:46] driveway. Wasn't worth shutting it off.
[33:49] They put that kind of effort for what?
[33:52] &gt;&gt; To send a little rubber puck around on
[33:55] the ice and the the boys, you know, have
[33:58] have some activity and have some uh
[34:01] social structure. And I think this
[34:04] social structure far exceeds anything in
[34:07] the world. I'd far sooner have my
[34:10] children from babes. From babies. I say
[34:13] to you that have babies and the sisters
[34:15] that are in the nursery. Uh fine, be in
[34:18] the nursery. But uh this is this is the
[34:21] atmosphere to bring them up in. I
[34:23] believe it with all my heart. And we've
[34:25] tried to practice that. So, as they get
[34:29] as the children are getting seated, uh,
[34:33] I'd like to I'd like to just sing a
[34:35] chorus if we would. Let's just sing uh
[34:38] we
[34:40] lift him up in the higher highest place.
[34:42] You'll help me out.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; We praise you
[34:49] &gt;&gt; in the highest place.
[34:54] For you
[34:57] are the great high priest
[35:02] replace you
[35:06] above
[35:08] all
[35:10] else.
[35:13] all else
[35:17] and we come to you
[35:21] and worship
[35:23] at your feet.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Let's stand as we sing it once again.
[35:31] Oh, we place you
[35:35] in the highest place.
[35:39] For you
[35:42] are the great high priest.
[35:46] We praise you.
[35:50] High above
[35:53] all
[35:55] else.
[35:58] all
[36:01] and we come to you
[36:05] to worship
[36:08] at your feet.
[36:12] [Music]
[36:15] I think most everyone has found their
[36:17] place. I'd like the congregation to
[36:20] collect their thoughts together. And uh
[36:25] we're here for one purpose.
[36:29] We want to make heaven our home
[36:34] and we want to do everything we can to
[36:38] help someone else along the journey.
[36:40] We're not here just for ourselves, but
[36:42] we're here for the those that are around
[36:45] us. I want to sing also just before we
[36:48] turn to the word worthy. Uh worthy. It's
[36:53] 2119.
[36:54] And I'd like everyone if you would
[36:57] please to be just as reverent as you can
[37:01] and no movement unless you absolutely
[37:04] emergency say
[37:06] I think sometimes people go out and back
[37:09] because it's habit
[37:11] and let's break those habits
[37:14] because it's disturbing to others that
[37:16] are sitting around. Let's keep our our
[37:19] focus on the word today and be honoring
[37:22] to the Lord Jesus Christ. And so unless
[37:25] it's emergency, let's not move. And
[37:27] those that are in other places, whether
[37:28] in a fellowship, in a nursery, or in in
[37:32] uh wherever they might be in the
[37:34] building, and those that are in homes,
[37:36] on the internet, I've seen and I have
[37:39] been on the internet with others, and
[37:41] I've seen such respect. They stand with
[37:44] us when we stand. They sing as we sing.
[37:47] They pray and whatever we do they're
[37:49] doing. And I say, "God bless them." God
[37:51] will honor that.
[37:54] Hear the cries of the shackled
[37:57] from the onset of time.
[38:00] On we're here as a group of people
[38:02] today, but I want you to be mindful that
[38:04] the shepherd will leave 90 and nine and
[38:08] go out for one. And he might do that
[38:11] even in a service.
[38:13] Go out for one. He's interested in in
[38:17] restoring everyone. All right, let's
[38:19] sing it together.
[38:22] Give him praise.
[38:26] [Music]
[38:29] from beyond
[38:32] of time
[38:34] for the tears
[38:36] of
[38:38] there is no
[38:42] see the tears
[38:45] of the broken
[38:47] the
[38:50] slave
[38:54] worthy.
[38:56] set us free.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, here it is. Now
[39:01] Christ
[39:03] is still
[39:05] as the chorus
[39:08] out
[39:13] from their
[39:15] [Music]
[39:18] mountain.
[39:20] The voices
[39:22] are swelling
[39:24] the song
[39:26] for worthy
[39:29] the lamb that was slain.
[39:36] Worthy.
[39:38] Oh worthy.
[39:42] So worthy.
[39:44] Worthy
[39:46] for the lamb that was
[39:53] worthy.
[39:56] So worthy,
[40:01] worthy
[40:03] of the lamb
[40:05] that was slain.
[40:09] and all the archangels
[40:14] the saints of all time
[40:20] their crown in their
[40:23] [Music]
[40:27] fall down before
[40:35] worthy
[40:37] worthy
[40:40] [Applause]
[40:44] Worthy
[40:45] [Music]
[40:48] worthy
[40:50] worthy
[40:52] worthy
[40:54] lamb that was slain.
[41:00] Worthy.
[41:04] So worthy
[41:12] that was
[41:16] with our heads bowed, our hearts filled
[41:19] with praise and thanksgiving.
[41:22] In one spirit, Lord, we come
[41:26] into your holy divine presence.
[41:29] We move in softly.
[41:32] We move in, oh God, only because you
[41:35] have extended grace. It is as though you
[41:38] have lifted your scepter and said to us,
[41:40] "Come."
[41:42] We have been welcomed into your presence
[41:46] and before your throne. We bow now
[41:50] reverently, oh God, realizing we are but
[41:54] vessels of dust from the earth. And we
[41:57] bow our heads down from the to the dust
[42:00] from whence we have come. Recognizing,
[42:03] oh God, that anything of value and worth
[42:06] that is in us, you have given it. And we
[42:09] give you praise because you're the giver
[42:11] of every good gift. You're the giver of
[42:14] every delivered soul that is here today.
[42:17] You're the deliverance, oh God. You are
[42:19] the healer of every sick body, those
[42:22] present and those that may now are
[42:25] listening with us. I pray, Father, that
[42:28] you will come near, very, very near to
[42:31] each one as we hunger and thirst after
[42:34] righteousness.
[42:36] Lord Jesus, I'm so glad I can testify
[42:39] you're not only my redeemer and savior
[42:41] personally, but my friend. And oh God,
[42:44] we need a friend. And we have found a
[42:47] friendship in Jesus. We have found you
[42:50] as a friend. I pray that you will be so
[42:54] near to everyone. All those that are
[42:57] present and those that may be visiting
[43:00] ask your grace upon our lives now.
[43:04] Open your word.
[43:06] May the Holy Spirit who gave author
[43:09] authorship to the word now give
[43:12] interpretation to it in Jesus Christ's
[43:15] name.
[43:16] Amen.
[43:18] I'll have you open your Bibles to First
[43:20] Corinthians,
[43:25] the ninth chapter.
[43:28] Thank you to the musicians. God bless
[43:30] you.
[43:39] We enjoy his presence.
[43:41] We like to have the service conducted.
[43:43] So
[43:46] he is welcome.
[43:48] Amen.
[43:50] The ninth chapter I'm going to begin to
[43:52] read from the 19th verse.
[43:58] For though I be free from all men, yet
[44:02] have I made myself servant unto all that
[44:06] I might gain the more.
[44:09] And unto the Jews I became as a Jew,
[44:12] that I might gain the Jews. To them that
[44:16] are under the law, as under the law,
[44:19] that I might gain them that are under
[44:21] the law. To them that are without law as
[44:25] without law, being not without law of to
[44:29] God, but under the law to Christ, that I
[44:33] might gain them that are without law. To
[44:36] the weak I became as weak that I might
[44:40] gain the weak. I made all things to all
[44:43] men that I might by all means save some.
[44:49] And this I do for the gospel's sake,
[44:51] that I might be partaker thereof with
[44:54] you.
[44:56] Know ye not that they which run in a
[44:58] race run all, but one receiveth the
[45:02] prize?
[45:04] So run that ye may obtain.
[45:08] And every man that striveth for the
[45:10] mastery is tempered in all things. Now
[45:14] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[45:16] crown, but we an incorruptible.
[45:20] I therefore so run, not as uncertainly,
[45:24] but so fight I not as one that beatth
[45:28] the air, but I keep my body I keep under
[45:32] my body and bring it unto subjection,
[45:37] lest that by any means when I have
[45:39] preached to others, I myself should be a
[45:42] cast away. May God bless his word to our
[45:45] hearts. You may have your seats. You can
[45:48] keep your Bible open if you would like
[45:51] to.
[45:56] Sometimes
[45:59] uh minister has things that he would
[46:01] like to say on his heart. Sometimes they
[46:05] are uh of a personal nature.
[46:09] And uh
[46:11] just the last two days, I guess it was,
[46:14] I I began to uh I'm not one for trying
[46:18] to keep time and dates and schedules and
[46:21] so on, but I I began to try to
[46:27] remember when it was I entered the
[46:30] ministry. And I actually had to take a
[46:32] calculator out. And I think next month
[46:36] will be 50 years in the ministry. And I
[46:41] left
[46:43] uh when my wife was just carrying a
[46:48] Linda and she was pregnant during those
[46:52] first meetings and with morning sickness
[46:55] and all the rest of it which I didn't
[46:57] understand
[46:58] because I hadn't had didn't have quite
[47:01] the same upbringing and didn't have a
[47:04] family where you learned a lot of things
[47:07] and uh
[47:09] uh that was our beginning.
[47:12] There have been years when
[47:15] uh the first church where we pastored,
[47:19] there was no concept and no
[47:20] understanding that the church supported
[47:23] a minister. It was just understood the
[47:25] minister worked. And so uh I worked uh
[47:29] we worked and uh u what came into the
[47:33] church just went to pay the church's
[47:35] bills and it uh I don't know it just
[47:38] managed to go along. I guess we didn't
[47:40] have anything to do with that because
[47:41] the church always had a secretary, a
[47:43] treasure. And uh so that seven that was
[47:48] about seven seven and a half years in
[47:50] two different at two different times for
[47:52] the same church. But uh all those years
[47:56] we we never received anything. It just
[47:59] in fact is I never even thought of it.
[48:01] It just was a natural thing. we just uh
[48:04] knew that we were to work and try and
[48:06] support ourselves and try and uh do the
[48:09] best for the church and and and
[48:12] pastored the little group. It it finally
[48:14] grew to be about 120 which was fairly
[48:16] substantial. And then going to the
[48:19] native Indian people, I'm not going to
[48:22] belabor this, but uh uh once again, you
[48:25] know, it was a matter we just had to
[48:27] find our own way.
[48:30] And uh I I can truthfully say and it
[48:33] just came to me actually this morning in
[48:35] in prayer while I was praying before
[48:38] coming to the pullpit.
[48:42] Uh it was God actually spoke to my heart
[48:46] just before the message came to us and
[48:49] the revelation of the message. And I can
[48:52] truthfully say that as we as we entered
[48:55] into our inheritance
[48:57] from that time, God just began to bless
[49:02] began to bless whether it be the family
[49:04] or the children or the labor of our
[49:07] hands or the mission work or whatever it
[49:11] seemed because the blessing was not on
[49:14] the person or the persons. The blessing
[49:17] was on the word. The blessing is on the
[49:20] promise. And as we give the promise, the
[49:24] word of God first place in your life, in
[49:28] fact is the only place in your life, the
[49:32] blessing is on the word.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And God will prosper that word
[49:38] most definitely.
[49:42] I'm going to say a couple serious
[49:43] things. I want you to listen closely.
[49:47] In a congregation of this size,
[49:51] you have
[49:53] very very distinct and different
[49:55] personalities.
[49:57] And you have some that are very passive.
[50:00] You have others that are very strong.
[50:03] You have some that don't ever declare
[50:06] themselves and you have others that are
[50:08] always declaring themselves.
[50:11] And to keep a congregation moving with a
[50:15] central focus and a central vision is
[50:18] more than a man can do. It can only be
[50:21] done and accomplished by the Holy
[50:24] Spirit. But I can tell you it is only a
[50:26] unified direction that God will bless.
[50:30] He will not bless everyone's diverse and
[50:33] personal opinions and personal likes and
[50:36] personal dislikes. It is something
[50:39] that's got to be founded solidly on the
[50:41] word of God. And it is and that's the
[50:44] only way it can be conducted. And so you
[50:47] may wonder about these things, but
[50:49] that's what Apostle Paul said. And
[50:51] perhaps you wouldn't have grasped the
[50:52] scripture as I will read it to you now.
[50:58] For though I be free from all men,
[51:02] and I personally, not to liken myself to
[51:05] the Apostle Paul, a great Apostle Paul,
[51:07] I would never never do that. But I will
[51:11] say that I feel that I am free from all
[51:14] men.
[51:16] And that I have made myself servant unto
[51:21] all. I've thought to be a servant to the
[51:24] people. and also my wife I have sought
[51:29] to that we could serve the people and I
[51:33] don't mean just locally but Paul said I
[51:36] made myself servant under all that I
[51:38] might gain the more and under the Jews I
[51:42] became as a Jew that was his lot
[51:46] that I might gain the Jews
[51:52] and them that are under the law. Even
[51:55] though grace was being introduced, there
[51:57] were those that still were hanging under
[52:00] the law.
[52:02] He didn't go and axe them and chop them
[52:04] down. He said, "As under the law, to
[52:08] those who are under the law, as under
[52:10] the law, that I might gain them
[52:15] that are under the law, and them that
[52:18] are without law
[52:20] as without law,
[52:23] being not without law of go to God."
[52:28] He certainly was wasn't without his his
[52:30] his commitment and law to God, but under
[52:33] the law to Christ, that I might gain
[52:37] them that are without law.
[52:40] And to the weak I became as weak,
[52:44] that I might gain the weak, I am made
[52:48] all things to all men, that I might by
[52:52] all means save some. Because not all are
[52:57] going to actually make it. Not all are
[53:00] going to hang in there. But the reason
[53:02] why you pour out your life and the
[53:05] reason why God has called you to pour
[53:07] out your life is to be a unifying force.
[53:11] It's not to live to yourself, not to
[53:14] live to your own personal tastes. And
[53:17] it's to live to the body and the
[53:20] betterment of the body of Christ. And I
[53:22] believe that we need to put every
[53:25] effort, every effort. I say that to all
[53:28] and I would say that to especially to
[53:30] the young people. We don't grow up to
[53:33] for your own, you know, your own
[53:35] personal likes, your own personal taste.
[53:38] You that play in the music and you that
[53:41] sing. We don't sing so that you are
[53:43] stimulated. We sing so the people should
[53:46] be blessed. We don't play instruments
[53:49] because so that you will be stimulated
[53:52] by your own uh by your own contribution
[53:56] but we play so that the uh congregation
[54:00] can be blessed and that the uh worship
[54:02] can go up to God and we as individuals
[54:06] some are some don't have a stitch of
[54:07] music in them that's fine uh you can
[54:10] make a joyful noise unto the Lord but
[54:12] don't criticize the one that does have
[54:14] music in them and you that have music in
[54:16] them you Don't criticize those that
[54:18] don't have any music in them. We We are
[54:21] not here for that. That is not our
[54:23] calling and not our purpose. Our purpose
[54:26] is to do everything that you possibly
[54:29] can to further the cause of Christ. And
[54:32] I will say something else. There's a lot
[54:34] of things that are ABCs and we need to
[54:37] be tending to some algebra.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; We need to be tending to some things. I
[54:42] tell you when you're out there when we
[54:43] sang the last song, my my concern is the
[54:47] souls of the shackled
[54:50] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit come and set them
[54:53] free.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That is our concern. That is our burden
[54:57] and that is the vision of Christ. And I
[55:00] have just said those things not because
[55:02] that's my message, but that is what's
[55:04] been on my heart. And furthermore, every
[55:07] person that calls this your church home,
[55:09] you have an obligation to myself as a
[55:12] minister, I have an obligation to you.
[55:15] And I spend hours at it to come here on
[55:18] a Sunday morning on every meeting and to
[55:21] deliver my soul before God. And we don't
[55:24] take this lightly. I don't have a I
[55:27] don't have a late sleep in on Sunday
[55:29] morning. And I don't have I don't have a
[55:31] Saturday like you have. I have Saturdays
[55:34] that are and and throughout the week
[55:36] that are filled with study and filled
[55:39] with burden and filled with concern and
[55:41] maybe on the phone an hour or two hours
[55:44] and trying to bear the burden of
[55:46] somebody else. Your responsibility is to
[55:48] make my load lighter, not heavier.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why we need your support. And
[55:54] I call on you for that support and see
[55:57] that that is if you do anything, you you
[55:59] go in prayer. If you see anything wrong,
[56:02] you pray about it. And you have you have
[56:04] to have confidence out there that this
[56:06] man here is doing absolutely everything
[56:09] he knows to do and will wait on God and
[56:12] will do the right thing.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And when there's situations to be dealt
[56:16] with, I'll tell you what I do. I wait on
[56:19] God till God gives me an answer in the
[56:21] word of God, then preach it over the
[56:23] word, and I expect the people to accept
[56:25] it.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And I think that's all right.
[56:30] I'm at the other end. I uh my record's
[56:32] already passed and I'm so glad I've been
[56:35] at it 50 years.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Won't be long, brother Ernie. It'll all
[56:40] be over.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; And so, I want to preach to you this
[56:44] morning.
[56:46] I want to preach to you about something.
[56:49] It's a strange subject. I want to preach
[56:52] on the Grand and Final Marathon.
[56:59] Paul has said,
[57:02] "I therefore so run, not as uncertainly,
[57:07] so fight, not as one that beatth the
[57:10] air."
[57:12] We're not in this
[57:14] for just some futile exercise.
[57:20] We're in this run. And I want every
[57:23] person, you've got to resolve something
[57:25] within your heart. This is a race for
[57:28] the the it's it's the grand marathon.
[57:31] It's the race of your life.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; And I have to be honest. I see believers
[57:39] that are running this race
[57:42] with a whole lot less intensity and a
[57:45] whole lot less commitment than those
[57:47] that are running the 26 mileer.
[57:52] The first marathon they said was held in
[57:55] Athens, Greece in April 1896.
[58:00] It's 26 miles 385 yards
[58:05] and it's from one place actually I guess
[58:07] it was called Marathon to to Athens and
[58:12] that was the first one. I just did a
[58:15] little look up and this is going to go
[58:16] in a very very strange direction so
[58:18] you'll need your minds completely
[58:21] captivated and I trust the Holy Spirit
[58:23] will do so.
[58:26] There are hundreds of training groups,
[58:28] hundreds, literally hundreds and
[58:31] thousands of instruction books
[58:34] and DVDs and videos and all kinds and
[58:38] all manner of of uh references
[58:43] to train people for a marathon.
[58:46] If you wanted to go on the web,
[58:49] you would I found 2,370,000
[58:54] plus
[58:56] references to training for the marathon.
[59:02] That's what the world is consumes
[59:04] themselves with. And people travel
[59:07] around the globe so they can participate
[59:10] in another marathon. And uh you might
[59:13] ask them, "What what what are you doing
[59:15] it for?" Well, I guess to get to the end
[59:18] of the race, to cross the finish line.
[59:21] And somehow there's some satisfaction.
[59:25] There's some fulfillment. There's some
[59:29] uh uh sense of achievement. I made it
[59:32] across the finish line. I flew to New
[59:34] York. I did the Boston or I did the one
[59:37] in Europe or wherever more
[59:41] just for that purpose.
[59:43] I thought, what have they got when
[59:45] they're done? Well, they've got some
[59:47] sense of inner satisfaction and they've
[59:50] got a body that is really wore out,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; I'm sure.
[59:57] And they can say, "I've done the 26
[59:59] mileer."
[1:00:01] There's a fellow, he's a shoe shine boy
[1:00:03] down in Vancouver.
[1:00:06] And uh if you observe him,
[1:00:11] and I say this very respectfully, it
[1:00:13] looks like there's a few bricks missing.
[1:00:17] Really does. Looks like he's not quite
[1:00:19] all there.
[1:00:21] And uh you know, you just you murmur a
[1:00:24] wee bit and so on so forth and and it
[1:00:27] just looks a wee bit different. It just
[1:00:30] He approaches things from kind of an
[1:00:32] he's kind of an eccentric of some sort.
[1:00:34] And uh I I've had I've had him shine my
[1:00:37] shoes cuz I just had a little pity for
[1:00:39] him. And then other fellas come around
[1:00:40] and says, "Oh, hi. How are you?" You
[1:00:42] know, and they have their little talk
[1:00:43] and so on. Did you did you do the 26
[1:00:45] mile over here? Yeah. Yeah, I did. And
[1:00:48] when they went by, I said, "Are you a
[1:00:51] marathoner?" "Yeah, yeah." He says, "I I
[1:00:54] run I run the 26 mileer." I said, "How
[1:00:57] many of you run?" you know where where
[1:00:59] where have you run? Oh, I've run here
[1:01:01] and I've run down there and New York and
[1:01:03] over here and he flies all over the
[1:01:05] country to run the 26 mileer. And I
[1:01:07] think he'd run around 40ome.
[1:01:10] And no wonder he looks so lean.
[1:01:14] And uh I thought this guy isn't missing
[1:01:16] anything. He's just he's a fanatically
[1:01:18] committed to this thing. So every time I
[1:01:21] talk to him, you know, that's the thing
[1:01:22] he wants to talk about.
[1:01:28] They say that the distance the distance
[1:01:31] runner's diet
[1:01:33] adapted from marathon
[1:01:37] the ultimate training guide. They have
[1:01:40] what to eat and drink in your next
[1:01:43] running race.
[1:01:45] They have nutrition for the endurance
[1:01:48] athlete.
[1:01:51] I'm going to tell you as a congregation
[1:01:52] today, you're not going to make it
[1:01:56] in this grand marathon if you don't eat
[1:01:59] the right thing.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You're just not going to make it.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; You're not going to make it in this
[1:02:06] marathon saying, "Well, I went to church
[1:02:08] Sunday morning." You are not going to
[1:02:10] make it.
[1:02:15] You've got to have a diet
[1:02:18] of nutrition
[1:02:20] of spiritual vitamins
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; that will uh come into you and that you
[1:02:27] will absorb in your in your spiritual
[1:02:29] body because you're going to face
[1:02:32] obstacles in this marathon. And we are.
[1:02:36] There isn't anybody here. No, no one
[1:02:39] here. You've got your burden. You've got
[1:02:41] your weight. You've got whatever you
[1:02:43] have. You've got your concerns. And they
[1:02:45] will not lessen. They will increase in
[1:02:48] this generation. And you've got to be
[1:02:51] resolved. I am running to make the
[1:02:53] finish line.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "You're not feeding."
[1:03:01] And I'll say so this morning, you're not
[1:03:03] feeding on a man.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; A man, his words will fail.
[1:03:10] But you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:03:14] word of the son of man.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; If you haven't fed, he said, if you
[1:03:20] haven't fed fully on every word to give
[1:03:24] yourself strength to fly above all
[1:03:26] these, he he mentioned denominations
[1:03:31] and things of the world.
[1:03:35] Will you at this time do it? He said and
[1:03:38] that is my
[1:03:40] my appeal to you even now
[1:03:44] things of the world the world is a uh
[1:03:48] it's a subtle place
[1:03:50] and Satan is a subtle he's a subtle
[1:03:54] master of of this generation. He has
[1:03:58] every kind of thing that he would throw
[1:04:01] out to the people and he would attempt
[1:04:05] to do everything that he can to just uh
[1:04:10] subtly move the people in the direction
[1:04:13] or a life or a home or whatever more.
[1:04:15] And there you have to be completely
[1:04:18] given over to the Holy Spirit and the
[1:04:21] voice of the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man. You're
[1:04:27] feeding on the B. And if you don't feed
[1:04:29] on that kind of nutrition,
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the whole council of
[1:04:35] the word of God.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; You'll not you'll not run successfully
[1:04:41] this grand marathon.
[1:04:45] They say another key nutrient
[1:04:48] that is a must for athletes,
[1:04:52] a must for athletes, we're talking about
[1:04:55] men who run and women who run a natural
[1:04:59] race. A must is water.
[1:05:03] And I can tell you, you can't just sit
[1:05:06] in church.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; You've got to have a fountain. You need
[1:05:12] to know that you're drinking from the
[1:05:14] fountain and that you've got a resource
[1:05:17] and that your soul becomes refreshed
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; and you're strengthened, you receive
[1:05:23] something. Do you know do you know when
[1:05:25] you have a a a cup of water in your
[1:05:27] hand? This is a foolish sounds foolish,
[1:05:30] but do you know when you have a cup of
[1:05:31] of cold water in your hand or you take a
[1:05:33] bottle of cold water and you just uh
[1:05:36] take it down how you feel, how your
[1:05:39] thirst is quenched, but you don't know
[1:05:41] everything that it's doing to your body,
[1:05:42] but it's restoring you. You've got to
[1:05:44] have water. People are uh concerned
[1:05:47] about being dehydrated. You've got to
[1:05:49] have water. I tell you, you've got to
[1:05:51] find that water of life and and and
[1:05:55] drink from it on a continual basis.
[1:05:57] You've got to be refreshed. If you
[1:05:59] don't, you're not going to you're not
[1:06:01] going to run successfully this race.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And God, the prophet said, is the
[1:06:06] fountain of all. He's the fountain of
[1:06:08] all grace.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; This fountain, it's not just like H2O.
[1:06:14] This fountain is grace
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; and this fountain is joy. Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; If you have found that this the things
[1:06:23] of this life and the burdens and the
[1:06:25] worrisome of us begins to sap your joy
[1:06:28] away from you and you don't have joy,
[1:06:30] remember there is something that you're
[1:06:32] not getting from the fountain and it's
[1:06:33] an essential nutrient.
[1:06:37] I'm not talking about frivolity.
[1:06:40] I'm not talking about joking or jesting.
[1:06:43] I'm talking about a joy that there is a
[1:06:45] a deep joy within your being. There's
[1:06:50] such a joy.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I have such a joy that I've been able to
[1:06:56] say today. I've ministered for 50 years.
[1:06:58] I have such a joy in being able to say
[1:07:01] that. I thank God for the privilege. I
[1:07:04] thank God for the burdens. I thank God
[1:07:06] for all the hardships. I thank God for
[1:07:09] the for the steep side of the mountain.
[1:07:13] Because I can look back and you you can
[1:07:16] also you can look back and say God led
[1:07:19] me all the way.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; God helped me through that time. And
[1:07:24] when I was feeling dehydrated, I found
[1:07:27] the oasis. I found an artisian well. And
[1:07:30] I drank and oh, I was restored. I fell.
[1:07:34] But I got up again and and went on.
[1:07:42] prophet said, "Come to the fountain,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; the artisian well, the everliving
[1:07:48] presence of Christ." The presence of
[1:07:50] Christ. You've got to sense it's it's
[1:07:53] not just doctrine.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And it's not just quotes. It's the
[1:07:57] presence of Christ. It is a relationship
[1:08:00] with a person.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; I believe him to be the inexhaustible
[1:08:06] fountain of life.
[1:08:09] more you get from him, the fresher it
[1:08:12] gets and the colder it gets and the
[1:08:14] better it gets and this and the sweeter
[1:08:17] it tastes the fountain of living waters.
[1:08:20] I'm not preaching you to to you a sermon
[1:08:23] this morning so much as a testimony. I'm
[1:08:25] here to testify I found that fountain
[1:08:29] and I am telling you as a congregation
[1:08:31] that fountain is sweet. that fountain is
[1:08:34] fresh. And I have never tried to just
[1:08:37] give you a bunch of uh dos and don'ts
[1:08:39] and a bunch of quotes and said you have
[1:08:41] to do this or it's chop chop. I've said
[1:08:44] that if you don't do this, you're the
[1:08:47] one that's a loser. You're the one
[1:08:49] that's missing out. But this is a
[1:08:51] blessed blessed walk with God. This is a
[1:08:54] blessed relationship. And this message
[1:08:56] is a person.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; This is a person. And it's the person of
[1:09:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; You'll know where I'm coming to and I
[1:09:05] hope I can get to it this afternoon
[1:09:09] or today.
[1:09:12] They monitor also,
[1:09:16] and I'm going to leave this. They
[1:09:18] monitor your heart and your training to
[1:09:21] make sure that everything's all right.
[1:09:24] I thought, "Oh, God, if they do that for
[1:09:27] a 26 mileer,
[1:09:30] what about us?
[1:09:32] What about you today sitting in this
[1:09:35] congregation? And you're here, I hope,
[1:09:38] because you have a you have
[1:09:42] a commitment more than a commitment.
[1:09:45] You're here because you want to and
[1:09:47] you're determined to make
[1:09:50] this goal, sir. this eternal goal
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; or you shouldn't be here. That is your
[1:09:57] that's what you're consumed with. And
[1:09:59] these people that have become so
[1:10:00] consumed that they give their lives and
[1:10:03] they practice all hours and they go
[1:10:05] through all this training and eat all
[1:10:08] the kind of food and drink what they're
[1:10:09] supposed to drink just for a uh just for
[1:10:12] a a a satisfaction, some kind of human
[1:10:16] achievement. What about us?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; What about us?
[1:10:21] We as a church cannot for a moment take
[1:10:24] this as say the church down the street.
[1:10:27] We're not another church down the
[1:10:29] street. This is a gathering of people
[1:10:30] that has heard thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:10:33] And we have heard a message that is to
[1:10:35] carry you over from mortal to
[1:10:37] immortality. And that is our prime
[1:10:39] concern. That is my prime interest today
[1:10:43] is to uh save some. To those that are
[1:10:45] under the law, I try to be under the
[1:10:47] law. And those that are free without the
[1:10:49] law, I've sought to be that way. Those
[1:10:52] that are Jews, be a Jew. Those that are
[1:10:54] this, those that are whatever more, be
[1:10:56] that for them.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You don't understand what I'm saying?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; We've got a mixed congregation here.
[1:11:03] About 40 different nationalities,
[1:11:05] cultures from all different directions.
[1:11:07] And where where you came from, I seek to
[1:11:10] make myself that. so I can talk to you
[1:11:12] and blend with you and help you along
[1:11:15] the way that I might gain some.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that example is to be
[1:11:22] your example. Be that be be you can't be
[1:11:25] all things to all men all the time, but
[1:11:27] you can some of the time. And I believe
[1:11:29] that God will help us as a congregation.
[1:11:32] God wants this assembly to be a banner
[1:11:36] light
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; of this message.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] And Satan would do everything. He hates
[1:11:43] it.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; But I declare he cannot snuff it out. He
[1:11:47] can do nothing against the work of God.
[1:11:49] He can avail nothing in his in his
[1:11:52] attempt to snuff out the life. I've
[1:11:54] proven it.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm proven it. And I'm
[1:11:58] rubbing his face in it today.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; He cannot snuff it out. He cannot stop
[1:12:04] this gospel.
[1:12:08] I've seen some that have been
[1:12:10] criticizing the message on the on the
[1:12:12] internet and and there's a whole page.
[1:12:15] Brother Ernie, you sent it to me. And
[1:12:17] that the first letter to that man, oh,
[1:12:20] he's he's even pleading for offerings
[1:12:22] and money for people to help him so he
[1:12:24] can help to get people out of this
[1:12:26] terrible doctrine.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; It's false cult. And a man wrote from
[1:12:33] Siberia. And the man was writing he he
[1:12:37] wasn't he wasn't uh agreeing with this
[1:12:40] man. He was just saying I hear about
[1:12:42] William Brandom uh you know where is uh
[1:12:45] can you place him in the Bible or what
[1:12:46] does the Bible say about it? Oh I tell
[1:12:49] you what this man feels he's absolutely
[1:12:52] uh given over and consumed with. He's
[1:12:54] got to get everybody out of it and he he
[1:12:56] even admitted himself this thing is
[1:12:58] spreading all over the country. I said
[1:13:00] praise be to God. Even the enemies of
[1:13:02] the message have to declare they can't
[1:13:04] do anything about it.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; And to those from Congo or those from
[1:13:11] Malawi or those from Zimbabwe or
[1:13:13] wherever I have tried to be, we go there
[1:13:17] and feel one with them.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; We go to the native Indians or wherever
[1:13:23] it is or maybe British or German or
[1:13:27] whatever it is. I'll tell you what,
[1:13:28] friends. We're not just a not we're not
[1:13:31] fractured because of your background or
[1:13:33] where you come from.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's not our citizenship. Our
[1:13:39] citizenship is in heaven.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Where you're heading and you're in a
[1:13:43] grand marathon today.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; You're in a grand marathon today. And
[1:13:48] some of us got some age on us and we're
[1:13:50] a lot closer to that finish line
[1:13:53] than others.
[1:13:55] And then when one completes,
[1:13:58] you're going to have to pray for me
[1:14:00] because you might be hearing the roast
[1:14:02] might burn.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; But when one completes the marathon,
[1:14:10] I've seen some pictures. Oh, and they
[1:14:12] they complete the marathon. Oh, there's
[1:14:14] congratulations and they're greeted by
[1:14:17] well-wishers and and uh uh they feel a
[1:14:21] sense of I made it. Some of them almost
[1:14:24] collapsing on the end. I see a band of
[1:14:28] people
[1:14:30] coming home
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; and a host welcome welcome them. They
[1:14:35] finished their marathon to run another
[1:14:37] one. We're in this one the grand one and
[1:14:39] we'll never run it again.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God and so run. I say to
[1:14:45] you today, so run. If this would be my
[1:14:48] last message, don't forget these words.
[1:14:50] So run.
[1:14:55] Don't let the words of Paul to the
[1:14:56] Galatians ever be your portion where he
[1:14:59] says you did run well. What happened
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; at one time? You did run well. You got a
[1:15:05] off. We're not a 100yard dasher.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; We're not a 1500 meter uh runner. We're
[1:15:12] in a grand marathon.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; We're in the marathon of life.
[1:15:23] By God's grace,
[1:15:29] Brother Brandham was nearing.
[1:15:33] Brother Brandham was nearing
[1:15:37] the finish line
[1:15:39] of his marathon.
[1:15:43] I'm very deeply moved.
[1:15:49] You've heard me speak of the last four
[1:15:51] messages.
[1:15:55] I want you to think the way God has been
[1:15:57] dealing with me.
[1:15:59] God Almighty,
[1:16:02] creator of heavens and earth that came
[1:16:04] down visibly,
[1:16:06] had a photograph taken, a moving pillar
[1:16:10] of fire, stood there at the platform,
[1:16:13] spoke out of his mouth things that a
[1:16:15] man's mind couldn't even for years and
[1:16:18] years and hundreds and thousands of
[1:16:20] times. And now God himself,
[1:16:24] it's not Malachi now that he's going to
[1:16:26] through Malachi spoke his final words.
[1:16:29] Behold, I send Elijah the prophet before
[1:16:32] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:16:34] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:16:36] fathers to the children and the hearts
[1:16:38] of the children to the fathers, lest I
[1:16:40] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[1:16:42] And he sealed it off. Then nothing was
[1:16:45] said.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; 400 years.
[1:16:50] 400 years of silence while generations
[1:16:53] came and children were born and men and
[1:16:57] women died and went to their sephilurs
[1:17:00] or their graves. But God said nothing
[1:17:03] because he determined he would be silent
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; until an angel would come.
[1:17:10] Said the virgin, you're going to
[1:17:12] conceive.
[1:17:15] Said to Joseph,
[1:17:17] you'll call his name Jesus. You'll call
[1:17:19] his name Emanuel. He'll save his people
[1:17:21] from their sins. Now we come to the end,
[1:17:24] the revealing. this same son of man
[1:17:27] being revealed.
[1:17:34] You know, we go back 1965.
[1:17:38] God took them 1965.
[1:17:40] They've never duplicated that ministry.
[1:17:44] There was nothing like it prior to it,
[1:17:45] and there's been nothing like it since.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to take what
[1:17:50] was laid down. You're going to have to
[1:17:53] take what what God left and I can assure
[1:17:56] you God left sufficient to get you
[1:17:59] through your marathon to the final line.
[1:18:03] And as he was as he was approaching the
[1:18:06] end of his now he I would take maybe to
[1:18:10] uh December the 5th on we preached the
[1:18:12] rapture spoke the rapture
[1:18:16] and then December the 5th things that
[1:18:18] are to be things that are to be. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And then December the 6th, modern events
[1:18:25] made clear by the prophecy.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; And they were all on on the 5th, things
[1:18:32] that are to be. He said, "I want this
[1:18:34] now. This service will tie into last
[1:18:37] night's meeting."
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Which was rapture. And it's the only
[1:18:41] time in all of his 33 years that he
[1:18:45] called it the order, the order of this
[1:18:49] great rapture. That's when he went into
[1:18:51] the shout, the voice, and the trumpet.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; That was the order of the rapture.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And then the very next night,
[1:19:02] things that are to be.
[1:19:05] And I took
[1:19:08] when he gave the order of the rapture, I
[1:19:11] thought he's got maybe two, four, six
[1:19:15] more hours.
[1:19:18] Six more hours.
[1:19:21] that that voice
[1:19:24] is going to speak before it's silenced.
[1:19:29] Six more hours.
[1:19:31] What is God going to say
[1:19:35] in those six hours?
[1:19:39] And I have been pouring over back and
[1:19:41] forth and back and forth, not with the
[1:19:45] view that this was his second last
[1:19:46] message or his third last message or
[1:19:48] what I've been pouring back and forth
[1:19:50] over it and letting my soul have a
[1:19:53] relationship. Almighty God, these were
[1:19:56] your last six hours, your last eight
[1:19:59] hours of speaking and going to lay it
[1:20:02] down and it'll be on tape and it'll be
[1:20:05] in book. But this is never been a
[1:20:08] ministry like this and never has been
[1:20:10] one since and neither will there be.
[1:20:12] This is a ministry the consummation of
[1:20:15] the ages. What is it that you're saying?
[1:20:17] And let those things come and resound
[1:20:20] deep within my soul. Let it echo out
[1:20:23] until I grasp what it is that's
[1:20:25] happening
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; because now we have moved on from that.
[1:20:38] The last four messages.
[1:20:41] You've heard some of these things
[1:20:42] before, but you haven't heard them in
[1:20:44] the context or like I'm saying it this
[1:20:46] morning.
[1:20:49] He took a very strange subject text for
[1:20:54] the rapture message
[1:20:57] and yet it's e extremely revealing.
[1:21:05] Brother Brennham starts
[1:21:11] in Psalms the 27th chapter.
[1:21:17] And now
[1:21:22] this marathon
[1:21:24] and when I say rapture,
[1:21:27] rapture
[1:21:30] is not so much
[1:21:34] it it's not a like a finishing line.
[1:21:36] It's not a like a certain spot, but the
[1:21:40] rapture is actually an existence.
[1:21:44] The rapture is actually a place.
[1:21:47] And I want you now to to hold this in
[1:21:50] your mind. A place
[1:21:53] for the very next night. And I'm going
[1:21:55] back and forth, but you'll you'll be
[1:21:56] acquainted with it before I'm done.
[1:21:59] The very next night in things that are
[1:22:00] to be, he goes to John the 14th chapter.
[1:22:05] Let not your heart be troubled.
[1:22:08] Now, Jesus
[1:22:10] was coming right to the end of his
[1:22:13] ministry. And brother Brandham says he
[1:22:15] he doesn't know in a few days he's gone.
[1:22:19] He hasn't said anything. But in that in
[1:22:22] that message, he's saying of Jesus now,
[1:22:27] his life and his ministry is fixing to
[1:22:30] end on earth. It is as though he is
[1:22:34] actually speaking his own life because
[1:22:38] his life also because he's the vessel
[1:22:43] through whom this son of man of 2,000
[1:22:47] years ago is going to is now going to is
[1:22:51] expressing himself and has expressed
[1:22:54] himself and has spoke his word. And the
[1:22:56] very life now of the vessel is also
[1:22:59] going to be extinguished in a few days.
[1:23:03] And he said his life was fixing to end
[1:23:06] here on earth. So he's saying to his
[1:23:08] disciples,
[1:23:11] I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place, I will
[1:23:16] come again and receive you unto myself.
[1:23:18] And I said, now his life also is fixing
[1:23:21] to end here on earth. Oh God, let me
[1:23:24] catch what it is you're saying.
[1:23:32] David has said this in part of the
[1:23:36] scripture which we read
[1:23:39] out of Psalms 27.
[1:23:43] He said, "Though a host," this is the
[1:23:46] third verse, "Though a host should
[1:23:49] encamp against me, my heart shall not
[1:23:53] fear. And though war should rise against
[1:23:57] me, in this will I be confident.
[1:24:02] Listen closely now.
[1:24:05] There isn't a person here. I've talked
[1:24:07] to too many of you,
[1:24:10] even younger and older.
[1:24:13] And and and what what David, the Bible
[1:24:17] tells us, was a man of war. He knew what
[1:24:20] war was. He knew what conflict. There
[1:24:22] isn't a person within the sound of my
[1:24:24] voice. But if what if you were to to uh
[1:24:27] uh enumerate the things that that you
[1:24:32] have surrounding you, there are times in
[1:24:34] our life,
[1:24:36] sometimes more than others, but have you
[1:24:38] thought and if you could analyze the the
[1:24:40] burdens and dig deep down into your
[1:24:42] heart and down into the dark crevices of
[1:24:45] your heart and begin to enumerate and
[1:24:47] there are certain things you could think
[1:24:48] about even now that would make you feel
[1:24:50] heavy inside because there's there are
[1:24:53] there are family situations uations and
[1:24:55] there are perhaps financial situations
[1:24:57] and all kinds of things that are too
[1:24:59] complex to even sort out but somehow the
[1:25:02] whole the whole uh uh uh the whole scene
[1:25:06] the whole scenario is like as though
[1:25:09] there's been an encampment and the and
[1:25:11] the scripture uses the word David uses
[1:25:13] the word that there's a host though a
[1:25:16] host should encamp about me and the host
[1:25:18] actually is a camp of armed company an
[1:25:22] armed army
[1:25:25] My friends,
[1:25:28] while we're in this race, I can tell you
[1:25:31] there is an armed camp
[1:25:34] and it's called the powers of darkness.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; We are not called to a picnic.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; We are called to a warfare.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; And there is an army. If things in our
[1:25:49] lives just go along relatively easy, I'd
[1:25:52] be more concerned about that than if you
[1:25:54] said, "This morning, I'm in the battle
[1:25:56] of my life. I'm in the battle of I never
[1:26:00] dreamed I'd be in such a battle as we're
[1:26:02] in today." And the more you the more you
[1:26:05] uh uh forcefully take and run this race
[1:26:09] that I'm speaking about, the more you'll
[1:26:11] feel the heat of the enemy on your
[1:26:13] heels. And David said,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; "Though host should encamp against me,
[1:26:19] those that host, this camp of armed host
[1:26:23] and encamp shall encamp against me." The
[1:26:26] scripture is the word that he uses,
[1:26:29] though this host, though this armed
[1:26:31] camp, lay siege, try to lay siege to me
[1:26:37] uh against me. And that's what the word
[1:26:39] is. And the prophet said, "You will
[1:26:41] fight for every inch of ground." That's
[1:26:43] right.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; You plan to make some headway today.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You plan to make even one inch today,
[1:26:51] you're going to fight for it.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You got to be resolved in your mind.
[1:26:55] You're going to fight for every inch of
[1:26:56] ground that you that you gain
[1:26:59] spiritually speaking.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; And and uh and uh Brother Brand refers
[1:27:07] to Jo, excuse me, to Joshua. He he said
[1:27:12] Joshua was told by God everywhere the
[1:27:15] souls of your feet steps
[1:27:18] that I have given you that God has given
[1:27:21] us these things but nevertheless and he
[1:27:23] said footsteps meant possession and
[1:27:26] every promise in the in the book is the
[1:27:28] believers. It belongs to you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; You got to fight every inch of the way
[1:27:34] and if you haven't got any fight in you
[1:27:37] then get out of the game. Do
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; you believe that also?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; This is for a fight.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; This is a battle.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; This is a race.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; And you have to have a resolve within
[1:27:48] you. I'm crossing that finish line. And
[1:27:51] the finish line I'm speaking about is
[1:27:53] not a certain time on the calendar. It's
[1:27:55] not a certain day in the calendar. It's
[1:27:57] not even at your death. That's not what
[1:27:59] it is. This message has been laid out.
[1:28:02] The word of God has been laid out
[1:28:06] so that you can enter into
[1:28:09] another realm. And this isn't some, you
[1:28:12] know, uh, pie in the sky kind of thing.
[1:28:16] Jesus,
[1:28:18] when he was coming near to the end of
[1:28:20] his ministry and his life here on earth,
[1:28:24] the disciples,
[1:28:27] they wanted him to escape the hardship.
[1:28:32] And Jesus said some words, and I I'm
[1:28:35] praying that God give you revelation. I
[1:28:37] I I tell you, I have pondered these
[1:28:39] things very very deeply. And I don't
[1:28:41] want to say it lightly this morning.
[1:28:44] The disciples said they wanted him to
[1:28:47] escape these hardships. And Jesus had
[1:28:51] one answer and he used it more than
[1:28:53] once. How then shall the scriptures be
[1:28:56] fulfilled?
[1:28:58] In other words,
[1:29:00] he was now living out
[1:29:04] what
[1:29:05] God in flesh, as I said to you last
[1:29:07] night, brother Mickey, God in flesh was
[1:29:11] living out
[1:29:15] and he was enacting
[1:29:19] the actual
[1:29:22] spoken word that God, the same God,
[1:29:25] spoke through men. Right?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He was making himself bound and subject
[1:29:31] to what he spoke through the mouths of
[1:29:33] human men
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; through the mouths of Isaiah
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; through the 53rd chapter. Now, Christ
[1:29:41] himself is bringing himself subject to
[1:29:44] that prophecy concerning himself and
[1:29:48] he's walking directly into the spoken
[1:29:51] word for his hour, for his moment.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God spoke it through mortal
[1:29:57] men. God spoke it again through mortal
[1:30:00] men. He began to speak about the
[1:30:02] rapture. It's not a date on the
[1:30:04] calendar. It is a it is an experience
[1:30:07] for the believer. And as he goes into
[1:30:10] things that are to be. He speaks about
[1:30:12] the things that we eat. He speaks about
[1:30:14] how your mother craved for certain
[1:30:16] things when you were in the womb and she
[1:30:18] wanted certain strange foods because you
[1:30:20] in that form and you had not even come
[1:30:23] to be in fellowship with your father and
[1:30:24] mother yet. But you were calling for
[1:30:27] those vitamins. And so she would eat and
[1:30:30] and the parents would pinch and so they
[1:30:32] get the right kind of thing so that the
[1:30:34] babe that was to come so that you would
[1:30:36] have the kind of body you're supposed to
[1:30:39] have in this life. And he was saying
[1:30:41] then God will call a preacher to the
[1:30:43] pulpit and begin to say certain things.
[1:30:46] And it is it is your eternal body that's
[1:30:50] actually calling right now. And that
[1:30:53] groaning is in you because you are going
[1:30:56] there. And these words have been spoken
[1:30:59] now have been spoken through the mouth
[1:31:01] of a prophet to give you what you need
[1:31:04] for that place.
[1:31:14] Jesus himself walked into it. He walked
[1:31:17] into it. When Jesus went to the cross,
[1:31:20] that's why he could say, "You can't take
[1:31:22] my life from me. No man takes my life
[1:31:24] from me. I lay it down." And you know
[1:31:26] the prophet said, "You know what brother
[1:31:27] Brandham said? You can say that
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; you can say that
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; no man takes my life from me."
[1:31:33] Hallelujah. I'm expending my life the
[1:31:36] way that God has ordained me to expend
[1:31:38] it. And furthermore, when my last breath
[1:31:41] comes, it's not the last breath. I
[1:31:43] simply take another breath into another
[1:31:45] world
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; and into another body.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; But it's just not some thought. It's
[1:31:51] just not some, you know, uh, ray of hope
[1:31:54] up in the future. That body is being
[1:31:56] formed even now. Because what is in you
[1:31:59] and what is in me, it's that body that's
[1:32:01] calling for it. And the Holy Spirit is
[1:32:04] saying to you, believe it. Believe it.
[1:32:07] Believe it. Confirming it to you.
[1:32:10] believe it
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; because your eternal home is calling for
[1:32:14] it
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; and he will call
[1:32:18] some minister
[1:32:20] and that's why you can remember back and
[1:32:21] say I remember when you know brother
[1:32:23] Lance or I remember messages he preached
[1:32:26] a long time ago they feed my soul
[1:32:28] brother Tom has preached brother Diddier
[1:32:30] has preached these brethren brother
[1:32:32] Ernie brother brother brother Andy's
[1:32:33] John Andy's and heard of the services
[1:32:35] the people been blessed just recently uh
[1:32:38] you you know what it If you take and
[1:32:40] say, "Wow, that was a wonderful service.
[1:32:42] Oh, I just remember what he said. That
[1:32:43] was just so great." And so on and so
[1:32:45] forth. You're missing it. It didn't come
[1:32:48] for a temporary blessing. It came
[1:32:50] because there's an eternal home and an
[1:32:52] eternal body calling for that word
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; and calling for you to believe it.
[1:33:09] David said, "And now we
[1:33:15] won't attempt to finish, but I'm going
[1:33:18] to start to get into it now."
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even mine enemies and
[1:33:28] my foes, came upon me to eat up my
[1:33:31] flesh, they stumbled and fell. And
[1:33:34] though in host should camp and camp
[1:33:37] against me, my heart shall not fear. The
[1:33:41] war should rise against me. Listen, now
[1:33:45] here's the key. And I spoke on it once.
[1:33:47] In this
[1:33:50] I will be confident. What? Not just in
[1:33:53] God. In this I will be confident. And
[1:33:56] the next line begins to interpret what
[1:33:58] this is. One thing. One thing. Not two,
[1:34:04] one thing I have desired of the Lord and
[1:34:08] that will I seek after.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; That's what he's confident in.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me,
[1:34:16] though Satan should try to lay siege to
[1:34:19] my life and my soul and my family or or
[1:34:22] the church or whatever more. Though he
[1:34:24] tried to lay siege to me and though I
[1:34:27] can just feel the powers of darkness
[1:34:29] pressing in, in this one thing I'll be
[1:34:32] confident. And that will I seek after.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; His confidence wasn't in his talents or
[1:34:41] his gift or what he knew or what he he
[1:34:43] memorized or or the retention of his
[1:34:45] mind or how much he could quote or how
[1:34:47] much he could remember or how gifted he
[1:34:50] was. His his he was confident in one
[1:34:52] thing. I have one desire
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; and that will I seek after and here it
[1:34:59] is that I may dwell
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord,
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; not his house, not a better position,
[1:35:11] not a better job, not to have something
[1:35:13] come out successful. This one thing,
[1:35:16] this is why I'm confident today. I
[1:35:19] desire to dwell in his house.
[1:35:27] I desired.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Here's a man that's a king. Here's a man
[1:35:31] with royalty. Here's a man with armies.
[1:35:34] Here's a man with responsibilities.
[1:35:36] Here's a man that is God is using now a
[1:35:38] prophet in the end time to show us the
[1:35:40] way. Saying this is rapture. And rapture
[1:35:44] is actually a change of dwelling places.
[1:35:47] You've heard me say that. Now I want to
[1:35:50] say it and emphasize it in a certain
[1:35:52] context. Rapture is a change of dwelling
[1:35:55] place.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; That's all it is. And the prophet said
[1:35:59] it is this same life
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; in another place.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; The same life.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You have eternal life now.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And it's simply going to go on from
[1:36:13] here. You're going to take one step and
[1:36:17] one foot will be in time. One foot will
[1:36:19] be immortality and the next one will go
[1:36:22] into immortality.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham went beyond the
[1:36:26] curtain of time, he he told me
[1:36:28] personally there was zero no no
[1:36:30] sensation whatsoever. Had no feeling of
[1:36:33] movement, no feeling. He was instantly
[1:36:35] 20 25 feet from his body with his hands
[1:36:38] behind his head
[1:36:40] saying had just finished saying Bill
[1:36:42] Brandham you're 52 you're past 50 he
[1:36:45] says some places and if you're going to
[1:36:47] do anything for God you better get up
[1:36:49] and get going you don't know how it made
[1:36:51] me feel at 27 28 years old when I heard
[1:36:55] him say that and know he'd spoken to
[1:36:57] hundreds of thousands and millions of
[1:36:59] people and seen all the miracles if
[1:37:01] you're going to do anything for God I
[1:37:02] said oh God, where do I stand? All we
[1:37:05] can be. We are what we are.
[1:37:11] Saw millions coming.
[1:37:16] Said, "This is strange.
[1:37:19] This is strange."
[1:37:21] He had prayed. He thought he'd just see,
[1:37:23] you know, going over that, you know,
[1:37:25] he'd see Brother Neville or something.
[1:37:26] It just be a spirit. It wouldn't be
[1:37:28] anybody he could shake hands with. He
[1:37:30] saw his hands,
[1:37:32] bit his finger,
[1:37:35] pinched his hand. He went like that to
[1:37:37] me. He pinched my hand. He said,
[1:37:39] "Brother Eddie, I had a body."
[1:37:42] And he knew he was baldheaded. And he
[1:37:43] felt right away. His hair, his head was
[1:37:46] full of hair. Had black curly hair. Head
[1:37:50] full of hair. Then sees the women
[1:37:52] running first, running, screaming, "Our
[1:37:57] brother, our precious brother. with long
[1:38:00] hair and robes and they ran down. I can
[1:38:04] tell you there was nothing skin tight
[1:38:06] there.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; There was nothing. There was none of
[1:38:09] these what they wear socks for blouses
[1:38:12] today.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; It's a shame.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It's a disgrace. And there's none of
[1:38:16] that over there. Hallelujah.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; They're dressed in their gowns
[1:38:24] acceptable in the presence of God come
[1:38:26] running. He said, "Who are these?"
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; They're your people.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; My people? Are they brats? No, they're
[1:38:34] your converts to Christ.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's many that are right
[1:38:39] here. I can tell you from that time when
[1:38:42] the word of God began to come out of his
[1:38:44] mouth to my soul and the word of God
[1:38:47] took on new life and new meaning and it
[1:38:50] prospered in my heart and my life.
[1:38:53] Hallelujah. And you can say the same
[1:38:55] thing. Oh, the peace that he's given
[1:38:57] you. Oh, how God has delivered you. Look
[1:38:59] at the liberty, you people from the
[1:39:01] colonies. Look where you were and look
[1:39:03] where you are.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Look at the bondage you had, Brother
[1:39:08] David. Look at the bondage you had.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; You don't even know who you're sitting
[1:39:14] beside today. Redeemed,
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; coming from the depths of sin,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; out of the prison house of the devil.
[1:39:23] Oh, hear the cries of the shackled,
[1:39:28] but we hear another voice.
[1:39:33] Those that were chained are free.
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:42] And my purpose this morning is to be
[1:39:45] what I can be to all people that I might
[1:39:48] win some
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; and take some across and as many as
[1:39:55] possible.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] Those
[1:40:08] of you from broken homes,
[1:40:10] we know it. My wife came from broken
[1:40:13] home.
[1:40:16] Some of you children live without a
[1:40:18] mother or father. We know what it is.
[1:40:20] And I get in counseling with you said,
[1:40:22] "We've been there.
[1:40:25] We've been there.
[1:40:27] My wife lived years without a mother
[1:40:32] and a father who's a businessman
[1:40:35] and could have had most anything she
[1:40:37] wanted, but she had no desire for it.
[1:40:39] She had desire play the piano at church,
[1:40:42] sing at church, be with the saints of
[1:40:45] God. Hallelujah. And I'm glad she went
[1:40:47] to brother Brandham's meeting as a girl,
[1:40:50] 12 years old, and had him say a few
[1:40:52] words to her. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; I don't say those things because I have
[1:41:00] any any human pride over it at all. I
[1:41:02] thank God for his grace.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Scripture says Paul left his kindred. I
[1:41:11] did too.
[1:41:14] Abraham left his kindred. Get up and
[1:41:16] leave them. I did also, but not
[1:41:18] willingly. God took my mother.
[1:41:22] Didn't know what a mother was.
[1:41:24] And my father had to go because of
[1:41:26] economics and drifted and shifted from
[1:41:29] pillar to post from a boy less than
[1:41:31] eight years old. But God used it.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; God gave me so I don't have that such an
[1:41:38] emotional attachment.
[1:41:42] Able to feel a certain amount of just
[1:41:46] being identified with other people in
[1:41:49] their situations and not feeling such a
[1:41:52] tie. And people say, "How do you go? How
[1:41:54] do you travel so God God made the vessel
[1:41:56] that way?" He does things his own way
[1:41:59] for his own purpose. He You find
[1:42:01] yourself in a certain situation. God saw
[1:42:03] your footsteps. He knew how it was going
[1:42:05] to be. And he has ordained it to be that
[1:42:08] way. And you're learning things even now
[1:42:10] in your present walk, what you're going
[1:42:11] through right now. And you won't know
[1:42:13] the benefit till you're down the road.
[1:42:15] But I say God's in control.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[1:42:25] He says, "And now I want you to notice
[1:42:28] very closely.
[1:42:31] One thing I've desired and that will I
[1:42:33] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:42:36] of the Lord." I'm going to go into these
[1:42:38] in some depth. Says that I might dwell
[1:42:41] in the house of the Lord, which is a
[1:42:46] dwelling. I want to be in the habitation
[1:42:49] of God.
[1:42:51] of the Lord. It can also resp speak
[1:42:55] figuratively of the human bodies or the
[1:42:59] household of faith.
[1:43:02] I tell you when I'm away I miss the
[1:43:05] house of the Lord.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with the structure.
[1:43:09] It has to do with the people that we
[1:43:12] look upon and a and see a smile on the
[1:43:16] face and feel a grip in the hand and and
[1:43:19] and and and anticipate and see something
[1:43:23] coming from the soul of that individual
[1:43:26] to another person. God bless you
[1:43:28] brother. I prayed for you. God bless you
[1:43:31] sister. Welcome back. Welcome to the
[1:43:34] congregation. We do what we can. That to
[1:43:37] me is a household. And David said, "Oh,
[1:43:41] I want to dwell in the house of God. I
[1:43:44] want to be with them." How many here? I
[1:43:46] don't even have to ask you. That's where
[1:43:48] you want to dwell.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to go home today and close
[1:43:54] the door. And some of you live alone.
[1:43:56] Some of you got your families. You'll
[1:43:57] instantly have responsibilities. Mothers
[1:43:59] will have to put food on the table. Uh
[1:44:01] but there's a land beyond the river. And
[1:44:04] it's not some pie in the sky, my
[1:44:05] brother, my sister. It's a real place.
[1:44:08] Amen.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And you're preparing for it this
[1:44:11] morning.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; June the 26th, I believe it is, 2005.
[1:44:16] You're actually preparing for it. And
[1:44:17] something in you is calling for.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I have something in me. I cannot
[1:44:24] describe it. I can't explain it. But
[1:44:26] it's groaning. It's calling. And God is
[1:44:29] giving you. You don't see it now. It's
[1:44:31] beyond your eyesight. But in another
[1:44:33] realm, God is preparing a place for you.
[1:44:37] And how he prepared the place is by the
[1:44:39] word he sent here.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; It's a creative word.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; That's swimming water.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; If you want to think about it.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; The word is here.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; What you believe here
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; is what you'll have over there.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; You give a cup of cold water here, you
[1:45:03] won't lose your reward over there. Have
[1:45:06] you done anything for any believers?
[1:45:08] Have you done something for believers?
[1:45:09] Of course you have. But when you did it,
[1:45:11] you just maybe did it involuntarily,
[1:45:14] just almost instinctively. You just did
[1:45:16] it. You thought, "Oh, you know, I'll
[1:45:18] just do this. I didn't realize it was in
[1:45:23] heaven." The answer was in heaven.
[1:45:27] You had a groan. You had a desire. You
[1:45:29] had You come to church. Oh, God. It's
[1:45:32] just uh I don't know what to do in this
[1:45:34] situation. and so on. And maybe the
[1:45:35] situation God allowed the situation. God
[1:45:38] allowed the hardship to cause and to
[1:45:41] give you a groaning inside because it's
[1:45:44] not the hardship. You got your mind on
[1:45:46] the hardship. You got your mind on the
[1:45:49] adversity. You got the mind on your
[1:45:51] difficulty, your problem. God has his
[1:45:53] mind on where you're going to live
[1:45:55] eternally.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And because of the hardship, you come
[1:45:59] burdened. You come, you come sober with
[1:46:02] sobriety to the church. You come and you
[1:46:05] sit in your minds on God. Oh God, uh the
[1:46:08] answer I I need some answers. I need
[1:46:11] some help. And God is squeezing you in
[1:46:14] that situation. So that when the word is
[1:46:16] preached, you'll believe it
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; because God is not so much concerned
[1:46:21] about your difficulty here. He's
[1:46:23] concerned about where you're going to
[1:46:24] live over there. And Jesus said, "I go,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; the son of man, I go to prepare a place
[1:46:30] for you." That's why he left the word.
[1:46:33] And the New Testament was not written,
[1:46:35] but the New Testament now was written
[1:46:37] after him. And Jesus took a cup, the cup
[1:46:40] of his blood, and the emblem of his
[1:46:43] blood. And he and he he said, "I have
[1:46:45] desired with a great desire to have this
[1:46:48] last Passover with you." And and the
[1:46:51] bread is my body. And he says, "This is
[1:46:54] the cup." of the New Testament in my
[1:46:58] blood cuz the New Testament was still in
[1:47:00] him.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And he did not drink it. He gave it to
[1:47:05] them and said, "Drink ye all of it."
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Because the bride of Jesus Christ, the
[1:47:11] church of called out ones are going to
[1:47:13] fulfill the New Testament. And so
[1:47:15] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:47:17] and the preaching of the word that comes
[1:47:19] from the word of God is for the
[1:47:21] believers at this time. You believe it?
[1:47:24] Not to help you through this life. I
[1:47:27] want you to get that out of your mind
[1:47:28] for a change. Not to help you through
[1:47:30] this life, but it is the same Christ who
[1:47:33] spoke that word that's preparing you a
[1:47:35] place
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; and preparing you simultaneously for
[1:47:41] that place.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Because the only thing you're going to
[1:47:46] take with you is your character.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Just think of it. You're only going to
[1:47:50] take your character. You're not going to
[1:47:51] take your nice clothes. You're not going
[1:47:53] to take your wardrobe. You're not going
[1:47:54] to take any of these things. You're only
[1:47:56] going to take your character. And when
[1:47:58] you shed all of this behind, I tell you
[1:48:01] what, friends, we want to be wellformed,
[1:48:06] well mature men and women of God. I long
[1:48:10] to dwell in the house of God.
[1:48:17] The house of God
[1:48:20] is something that was is established
[1:48:24] when David said to dwell in the house of
[1:48:28] the Lord saying I want to dwell in your
[1:48:31] household.
[1:48:33] I want to be where you live.
[1:48:36] Brother Bram says God lives in a house.
[1:48:41] Nothing like you could imagine. So don't
[1:48:42] try to think of what it's like.
[1:48:45] But David said, "Whatever it is, I want
[1:48:47] to dwell in your house."
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; And I want to dwell with your people.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's what Ruth said to Naomi. Your God
[1:48:55] will be my God. And she couldn't
[1:48:57] understand him. But whoever he is, he's
[1:48:59] going to be my God.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And where you live, that's where I'm
[1:49:01] going to live. And where you die, that's
[1:49:04] where I'm going to die.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And David is saying, I want to live in
[1:49:08] your household. And he's actually
[1:49:11] declaring because your household is
[1:49:13] established.
[1:49:14] He could see he's getting older. He
[1:49:17] could see that armies are around him and
[1:49:19] this kingdom may not last. And this that
[1:49:22] I'm so I have royal charge over may not
[1:49:25] be here in a few years. But oh, there's
[1:49:28] one that'll never pass away. There's a
[1:49:31] kingdom and there's a palace and there's
[1:49:33] a dwelling place that'll never pass
[1:49:35] away. Oh God, this one thing I'm
[1:49:38] confident in that I desire to come to
[1:49:40] that house.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; And you may, whatever your status is,
[1:49:46] and we're all different. We have
[1:49:47] different backgrounds,
[1:49:51] different cultures,
[1:49:53] completely different. Some may have a
[1:49:55] nice job, some you may be without a job.
[1:49:57] Some may be healthy and full of vibrant
[1:50:00] health today. And others of you may be
[1:50:02] sick. And there may be some at home
[1:50:05] laying in a bed. And I think of our
[1:50:06] sister Marge Miller. Oh God,
[1:50:09] this house is like a prison.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; How she'd love to be sitting right here.
[1:50:16] But there's another house and it's
[1:50:18] established.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And it has continuity.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; It will never perish.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; It will never be taken down. And the
[1:50:28] word he used house is it's made
[1:50:30] permanent. Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; When David said, "Your house, something
[1:50:34] established, something fixed, something
[1:50:37] permanent. I don't want something that's
[1:50:39] passing." My brother, my sister, I don't
[1:50:41] care where you live. I don't care what
[1:50:43] you drive. I don't care anything about
[1:50:46] your job or anything else. But there's
[1:50:48] one thing. There's there's something
[1:50:49] within the soul of every seed of God
[1:50:52] that's a believer. I want to come. I've
[1:50:55] got to come to that place that's
[1:50:56] permanent. That place that is
[1:50:58] established. That place that shall never
[1:51:00] decay. That place that no man can ever
[1:51:03] take down. Oh, I hope that you're with
[1:51:06] me today.
[1:51:13] That's a place.
[1:51:17] Next thing he says
[1:51:19] to behold your beauty,
[1:51:22] the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in
[1:51:26] his temple. Now we have house.
[1:51:29] Now we have temple. Now he wants to be
[1:51:31] in a temple.
[1:51:33] We could say it's also a dwelling place
[1:51:36] and the temple
[1:51:39] to inquire in his temple. He says I I
[1:51:41] he'd like to seek and search and
[1:51:43] consider and to reflect. And it's always
[1:51:45] notice notice please.
[1:51:48] It's his temple,
[1:51:51] his tabernacle,
[1:51:54] his pavilion,
[1:51:56] his house.
[1:51:58] David's not saying, "Oh, bless me here.
[1:52:00] Bless me in my bless me in my palace.
[1:52:02] Bless me in my kingdom. Bless me where I
[1:52:05] dwell. Bless me in my work. Give me
[1:52:07] wisdom." No, he's saying, "I want to go
[1:52:09] to your house.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; I want to be in your pavilion. I want to
[1:52:12] inquire in your temple.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Brham is taking all of this
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; which is a description he's pulling from
[1:52:25] the scripture. And I think of how Jesus
[1:52:27] walked and that was his last his last
[1:52:29] text in the in the in the prophecy. He
[1:52:32] said modern events made clear by the
[1:52:34] prophecy Luke the 24th chapter when
[1:52:36] Jesus himself drew near and walked with
[1:52:38] the disciples and they didn't know who
[1:52:40] it was. And the scripture says he spoke
[1:52:42] to them out of all of the prophets and
[1:52:44] the psalms.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; He was there in the psalms and now the
[1:52:49] revealing of the son of man. Here comes
[1:52:51] a vindicated prophet and he's only got
[1:52:53] us six eight hours left to preach and
[1:52:55] those things that God is going to say to
[1:52:57] you and I and then he's going to be
[1:52:59] silent
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; and people are going to put it on their
[1:53:02] shelves and think it's just a sermon.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You're missing it.
[1:53:06] It is the Lord Jesus
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; that's saying his last words
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; in that sense.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, he can speak to you individually
[1:53:13] and he does speaks to us individually.
[1:53:16] I'm talking about a word to the church,
[1:53:18] a word to the bride.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Says, I want to seek and I want to
[1:53:24] inquire in his temple.
[1:53:27] And this temple
[1:53:30] is a sanctuary.
[1:53:34] this temple.
[1:53:36] The word sanctuary, we call this a
[1:53:39] sanctuary.
[1:53:41] But the word sanctuary,
[1:53:43] which is in the Hebrew, is not just a
[1:53:46] sanctuary. He says, "Now I want to
[1:53:49] inquire.
[1:53:51] I want to seek. I want to consider. I
[1:53:54] want to reflect
[1:53:58] in your sanctuary."
[1:54:01] Even when you come here friends,
[1:54:05] I don't know whether you're here to say
[1:54:08] who's here or see what's happening.
[1:54:14] Why are you here?
[1:54:18] But David said,
[1:54:20] I want to come into your sanctuary. This
[1:54:23] is another aspect that the prophet is
[1:54:25] saying is it it is a part it's an aspect
[1:54:28] of revelation of rapture. It's part of
[1:54:31] the rapture
[1:54:34] going to be in a rapture. It's going to
[1:54:35] be people who reflect
[1:54:38] not on the fault that I see in my
[1:54:40] brother or the fault I hear in my
[1:54:42] sister. I'm not going to sit in the
[1:54:44] church and reflect on the last gossip I
[1:54:46] heard. That's going to do nothing for
[1:54:48] your body on the other side. You got to
[1:54:50] be here. you've got to be in this
[1:54:52] sanctuary. Say, "I want to be in your
[1:54:53] sanctuary."
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; When you come in that and you're
[1:54:56] thinking about your job, you're thinking
[1:54:57] about what you're going to do tomorrow
[1:54:59] or you're thinking about uh uh something
[1:55:01] else or who you're going to invite or
[1:55:03] who you're going to eat with. That has
[1:55:05] nothing to do with it. You can do that
[1:55:06] in this sanctuary, but that's not the
[1:55:08] sanctuary that that the prophet of God
[1:55:10] is talking about. He's talking about a
[1:55:12] sanctuary called the rapture.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; I asked this congregation, is that where
[1:55:19] you're going?
[1:55:21] And this sanctuary,
[1:55:23] it comes from another word and it is to
[1:55:27] prevail.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; To overcome,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; to endure,
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; and to have power.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; David is saying, let me take my core
[1:55:38] off.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; David is saying,
[1:55:44] I want to come into your sanctuary.
[1:55:47] I want to reflect.
[1:55:50] I want to consider.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I want to think about the things that
[1:55:54] you would think about.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; And I have come here in the sanctuary of
[1:55:59] God. I desire that sanctuary because
[1:56:02] there I overcome. There I am empowered.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You come here this morning
[1:56:09] and I know many of you and I'm I'm
[1:56:10] shouting it out. You come here with your
[1:56:12] defeat and you go out with your defeat.
[1:56:14] You want to say in the name of the Lord,
[1:56:16] I deny that defeat. I have come into the
[1:56:19] sanctuary to be victorious. I've come
[1:56:22] into the sanctuary to be empowered.
[1:56:25] I've come into this sanctuary to go out
[1:56:28] and overcome her.
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord,
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; that my friend
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; is part and parcel of rapture. Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say things you never heard
[1:56:44] me say before,
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; but I would say if a person's going to
[1:56:47] live their life and you're going to come
[1:56:48] in with your defeat and go out with your
[1:56:50] defeat and come under with your defeat
[1:56:51] and go out with your defeat, if you
[1:56:53] continue on, you will not go in the
[1:56:55] rapture.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; You cannot go in the rapture because the
[1:57:02] rapture is not made for that kind of
[1:57:04] life.
[1:57:06] You're living now what you're going to
[1:57:08] be over there.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; This life now you're going to live this
[1:57:12] life because you if I said who has
[1:57:14] eternal life, you'd all raise your hand.
[1:57:16] That's the life that you're going to
[1:57:17] live.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; The life you have now. He says we're
[1:57:20] going to work. We're going to live.
[1:57:22] We're going to we're going to be with
[1:57:23] one another. We're going to eat. We're
[1:57:24] going to be happy. So, we're going to
[1:57:26] eat. Yeah. I'm going to eat off the tree
[1:57:28] of life. I'm going to eat the fruit. I
[1:57:31] don't know. You say, "Well, how does it
[1:57:32] work?" I don't care how it works.
[1:57:35] I'm not even worried about how it works.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; What kind of body is it? It's going to
[1:57:40] be a glorious body.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Not like this vile body that I have now.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; But it's rapture. That's part of
[1:57:47] rapture. And the prophet is actually
[1:57:50] being he's being moved out of he's being
[1:57:52] moved out of his his his labor and life
[1:57:54] on earth. And he says of Jesus 2,000
[1:57:57] years ago, he said he said these things,
[1:57:58] behold, I go I I go and prepare a place
[1:58:01] a place another dwelling place. In
[1:58:02] chapter 14 of of John, he's back in the
[1:58:05] same He's back in the same theme.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; He said it ties into last night. I go to
[1:58:10] prepare a place for you. And if I go to
[1:58:12] prepare, I'll come back and I'll receive
[1:58:14] you under myself that where I am, there
[1:58:16] you may be also.
[1:58:22] And here now,
[1:58:24] don't think I've gone over the edge.
[1:58:27] here now
[1:58:29] that I would say the most spectacular
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; of ministry not fast not attaching it to
[1:58:37] a man as such it was Christ
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; and now he's directing those that will
[1:58:42] believe
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; he's directing to a certain it's the
[1:58:45] same son of man walking with us speaking
[1:58:48] to us out of the prophets and the psalms
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; that's what he's trying to tell them in
[1:58:54] in Luke 23 it's me
[1:58:57] Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; It's It's not another person. It's me.
[1:59:00] It's just that they couldn't see it.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get ahead of myself to
[1:59:06] overcome and to have power to be able.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; That's his temple.
[1:59:19] I've got to have just another few
[1:59:20] minutes
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; to be able
[1:59:25] to be able to endure
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; for the rapture. You may well have to
[1:59:30] endure. But let me tell you, the rapture
[1:59:33] is not it's not a certain point in time.
[1:59:37] Oh, when the rapture comes, I'll tell
[1:59:40] you right now, you are part of the
[1:59:43] rapture already.
[1:59:46] And uh the final that we're all looking
[1:59:48] for is when this body is changed and the
[1:59:51] atoms are changed and there's a sweep
[1:59:53] goes over us. And the sweep will happen
[1:59:55] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; And we'll all be changed
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; and we begin to mingle and meet with
[2:00:03] those that are resurrected.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; I fully intend if I'm standing here, if
[2:00:09] I'm alive, I look for it. I look for
[2:00:12] people. I actually look in their face
[2:00:13] and wonder now is that could be somebody
[2:00:15] that is resurrected that I'm having
[2:00:17] difficulty recognizing. They knew Jesus
[2:00:19] just a few days ago, but now they
[2:00:20] couldn't recognize him.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Mary couldn't recognize him. She thought
[2:00:26] he was the gardener.
[2:00:28] a young man working in a garden, keeping
[2:00:31] the garden which we are taught or they
[2:00:36] indicates the the garden uh the garden
[2:00:39] the garden tomb.
[2:00:44] I look for it.
[2:00:49] But if it's not tomorrow,
[2:00:53] and as time goes on, you're going to get
[2:00:55] a lot older,
[2:00:59] you're going to say, "Oh, look at look
[2:01:00] at old brother and sister Biscal, man.
[2:01:02] They're all wrinkled up and he's on a
[2:01:04] cane and she's in a walker or whatever
[2:01:06] more and hope their kids looking after
[2:01:09] them." Well, when it gets to be that
[2:01:11] time, just go and look in a mirror.
[2:01:17] One thing's for sure, you went down the
[2:01:18] road, too.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother McGriff, I was with him
[2:01:26] once. He was way up in his 80s, I guess,
[2:01:29] late 80s. He's always gun barrel gun
[2:01:32] barrel straight, you know, and he was I
[2:01:33] just so admired him and just the way he
[2:01:35] would preach and he stayed slim and all
[2:01:37] my just admired him. He said, "You know,
[2:01:39] my wife, I took my wife down. We went
[2:01:41] down to the down to the shopping center
[2:01:43] to get some groceries, he says. And and
[2:01:44] I finally decided what I would go in. So
[2:01:47] he says, "I I saw the reflection of a
[2:01:49] man, you know, in the in the in the
[2:01:51] shining in the mirror. He could just see
[2:01:52] it in the in the window, you know, on a
[2:01:54] nice sunny day." He could see the
[2:01:55] reflection of a man. He said he was all
[2:01:57] bent over and moving along like that.
[2:01:59] And he said thought, "Man, I felt sorry
[2:02:01] for him." And I had another look and it
[2:02:03] was me.
[2:02:08] Sorry, folks. That's just the way it
[2:02:10] goes. But when David was saying, when he
[2:02:13] was saying, I want to be in your temple
[2:02:17] and not only your sanctuary, but I will
[2:02:20] be empowered there.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; I will receive enduring power there.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; So that whatever comes
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; my way,
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I will I will be victorious over it.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Because I receive overcoming power in
[2:02:34] your sanctuary, not this one. Yours.
[2:02:36] Amen.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; If you want me to stop, folks, you
[2:02:42] better start praying right now.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Our brother Sir is right here from New
[2:02:49] Zealand. He and his wife June and
[2:02:50] daughter Gracie. I didn't even welcome
[2:02:52] him. He's going to be preaching tonight.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come and lay it in, Brother
[2:02:57] Howard. I I hope I have the people
[2:02:59] primed up.
[2:03:05] And then he goes on to say
[2:03:09] he'll inquire in his temple for in the
[2:03:12] time of trouble. Hello.
[2:03:16] You that have maybe almost succumbed at
[2:03:19] times to your trouble. You that wondered
[2:03:21] if you'd get through this dark tunnel.
[2:03:23] And he may be sitting here right this
[2:03:24] morning
[2:03:27] saying, "Is there light at the end of
[2:03:29] the tunnel? I haven't seen light at the
[2:03:30] end of the tunnel.
[2:03:36] He says,
[2:03:38] "In the time of trouble, he shall hide
[2:03:41] me in his pavilion." And because this,
[2:03:43] listen closely now, because this is the
[2:03:46] rapture theme.
[2:03:48] The trouble he's talking about is not
[2:03:51] your hardship at this moment. Not your
[2:03:56] hardship. It can it can refer to that,
[2:03:59] but that's not what the prophet's
[2:04:01] talking about. In the time of trouble,
[2:04:03] he'll hide me in his pavilion. His
[2:04:08] pavilion, not some man-made pavilion,
[2:04:10] but his pavilion.
[2:04:14] Because the time of trouble that brother
[2:04:17] Brandon preached for and that Jesus
[2:04:20] spoke about and that David was inspired
[2:04:22] by the Holy Spirit to say in the time of
[2:04:26] trouble, that spirit coming up out of
[2:04:28] him in the time of trouble, what God,
[2:04:31] listen to me, what God is seeking to
[2:04:34] preserve you from is the tribulation.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; That will be the time of trouble.
[2:04:44] I'm getting up in years. But many of you
[2:04:47] and I expect to see him come. I expect
[2:04:49] to I expect to depart this world. But
[2:04:52] you may well live beyond this time. And
[2:04:55] I can tell you that all the makings all
[2:04:58] the makings for the tribulation are
[2:05:00] right now present with us. Nothing has
[2:05:03] to happen except the Holy Spirit to be
[2:05:06] to to release them. Can you imagine? Can
[2:05:09] you imagine where this wickedness is
[2:05:10] going to go once the restraint of God is
[2:05:13] gone?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what is going to happen?
[2:05:16] You're not going to want to You wouldn't
[2:05:18] even want to go to school. You wouldn't
[2:05:19] want to work any You wouldn't want to go
[2:05:21] to the shopping center.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't dare want to go to a
[2:05:24] restaurant. I tell you what, it'll be
[2:05:26] perversion of all perversion. It will be
[2:05:29] iniquity and sin and blasphemy
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; and God's going to destroy it.
[2:05:37] Hallelujah.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; With a holy fire, you don't want to be
[2:05:40] here.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; He preached so you wouldn't be here.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; And this is part of the rapture.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; His house is part of the rapture. I want
[2:05:51] to go where he dwells.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; His his pavilion,
[2:05:59] his temple is part of the rapture.
[2:06:03] And now his pavilion.
[2:06:10] He said in Psalms 31:21, don't turn to
[2:06:12] it. I'm just going to read it. Thou
[2:06:14] shalt hide them in the secret of thy
[2:06:17] presence and from the pride of man. Thou
[2:06:21] shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion,
[2:06:24] from the strife of tongues.
[2:06:26] Exodus 33 and22. And it shall come to
[2:06:29] pass while my glory passeth by that I
[2:06:33] will put thee in a cliff of the rock and
[2:06:36] I will cover thee. I'm going to going to
[2:06:39] close I think on this on this pavilion
[2:06:42] but it is the one of the most moving for
[2:06:44] me. So don't let yourself be wearied.
[2:06:49] his pavilion.
[2:06:54] It's a thicket
[2:06:58] or in the old English terms a lair.
[2:07:03] That right, brother Roger? A lair which
[2:07:06] we don't use.
[2:07:08] It's another word covert or covert.
[2:07:12] It's a covering
[2:07:15] but it's also called a booth.
[2:07:19] And so when the children of Israel were
[2:07:21] coming out,
[2:07:23] they had the feast,
[2:07:26] they had the seven feasts and every one
[2:07:29] of them referred to Jesus Christ.
[2:07:34] And the last feast is the feast of
[2:07:37] tabernacles.
[2:07:39] And in that feast, God commanded Moses.
[2:07:42] Said, "Have all the children now of
[2:07:45] Israel,
[2:07:47] build a booth out of boughs." That's why
[2:07:50] they call it a thicket. You'll take
[2:07:53] these branches
[2:07:55] and you'll have these boughs and for
[2:07:57] seven days, because there's seven church
[2:08:00] ages, for seven days, you live in that.
[2:08:05] You'll leave your permanent residence
[2:08:07] that you have here as you're traveling
[2:08:09] through the wilderness and you'll be in
[2:08:11] this little booth for seven days. When I
[2:08:13] was in Israel, my wife and I on the trip
[2:08:15] the church just sent us, uh, they gave
[2:08:17] us a room and there was a balcony, quite
[2:08:18] a large balcony, and they said, "Please
[2:08:21] excuse,
[2:08:23] please excuse the the tent that's out
[2:08:26] there, the covering that's out there,
[2:08:27] because it's we're coming to the Feast
[2:08:29] of Tabernacles." And we had to have it
[2:08:31] ready because people come here from all
[2:08:33] over the world and rent these rooms and
[2:08:35] we've got to have the booth for them,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:08:38] And God said that booth
[2:08:42] is going to remind them.
[2:08:45] I want to remind them every year.
[2:08:49] This is a temporary place.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; And my brother, my sister, we need to be
[2:08:54] reminded on a continual basis. Don't get
[2:08:58] attached to this down here. This is a
[2:09:01] temporary place.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Everything's temporary. Everything's
[2:09:05] transient. Everything's moving. Don't
[2:09:08] get attached to it.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; It's not worth it.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And that booth also happens to be this
[2:09:20] one right here.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; You got a temporary booth, friends.
[2:09:30] Brother Bram says in one of these last
[2:09:32] messages he said
[2:09:34] said he may be sitting here and it could
[2:09:37] be within 5 minutes you'll be a corpse
[2:09:45] and it could be a young person
[2:09:50] could be me in five minutes you could be
[2:09:53] a corpse he says and then again in five
[2:09:55] minutes we could all be in glorymen
[2:09:57] Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he was speaking. That's why
[2:10:02] the Lord Jesus was uttering these words
[2:10:04] through there and trying to tell us what
[2:10:07] the rapture is. And so now David, he has
[2:10:11] covered he has covered the the the
[2:10:13] temple. He has covered the house of the
[2:10:16] Lord and the temple and everyone is a as
[2:10:20] a facet of the rapture itself. And now
[2:10:24] he has come. He's come to the pavilion.
[2:10:28] Oh God,
[2:10:31] I want to end
[2:10:34] this constant movement. I want to end
[2:10:38] this journey.
[2:10:40] I want to end being a transient in this
[2:10:44] wilderness of this world. I want to end
[2:10:46] with that. I want to come to your
[2:10:49] pavilion. Let me come to your booth
[2:10:52] because it will never be moved. It will
[2:10:55] never be taken down.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; That's part of the rapture. And the very
[2:11:03] next night now, he starts giving word to
[2:11:05] the people. And that Pentecostal people,
[2:11:07] they didn't want to accept it. They
[2:11:09] didn't know they were right then turning
[2:11:11] down the rapture. Right?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; And if you were with them today, they'd
[2:11:16] be believing, "Oh, I'm going to the
[2:11:18] Lord's going to come and I'm going in
[2:11:19] the rapture." And they already rejected.
[2:11:22] They rejected it right then. When God's
[2:11:24] messenger was actually giving them,
[2:11:26] shall I call the recipe, he was giving
[2:11:29] them in the in a childlike way, telling
[2:11:32] them, he was telling them just like your
[2:11:34] body in the womb of your mother's
[2:11:36] craving for it. He said, "You're you're
[2:11:38] here and you got a groaning in you and
[2:11:40] God is giving you
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; what you have need of for that home,
[2:11:50] this
[2:11:53] this booth."
[2:11:56] And the word
[2:11:58] the word is it's a a rude
[2:12:01] a rude temporary
[2:12:04] shelter.
[2:12:06] And the scripture says of it,
[2:12:09] he shall change our vile v I l e our
[2:12:15] vile body that it may be fashioned like
[2:12:18] unto his glorious body. Hallelujah.
[2:12:22] He'll change this vile body that it
[2:12:26] might be transformed or fashioned like
[2:12:28] unto his glorious body according to the
[2:12:31] working whereby he's able to subdue all
[2:12:34] things unto himself. And the vile body
[2:12:37] is that of a lower state
[2:12:40] lower. You've been brought down. And the
[2:12:44] scripture says in Hebrews says how he
[2:12:48] made man. And he said it made him a
[2:12:50] little lower than the angels. And then
[2:12:53] it speaks of Christ. And Christ came
[2:12:57] and took on a body of flesh and was made
[2:13:00] also a little lower than the angels.
[2:13:03] Made exactly the same cuz he had to be
[2:13:06] born of a woman and die on the cross.
[2:13:09] You talk about a vile body.
[2:13:12] Look at you. You're nice. When I even
[2:13:16] think of Christ, I'm ashamed of the suit
[2:13:17] I'm wearing.
[2:13:22] Nobody describes him like the prophet of
[2:13:23] God describes him going on the way to
[2:13:26] the on the way to Calvary
[2:13:29] with his beard torn out and the thorns
[2:13:33] in his brow and he allowed that body
[2:13:37] not 30 33 years old he looked 50.
[2:13:42] It's always a compliment they say how
[2:13:44] old are you? You tell them, "Oh, you
[2:13:46] don't look that old."
[2:13:49] But here is Christ.
[2:13:51] Like a 50-year-old man, stoop
[2:13:54] shouldered, not even strong enough to
[2:13:56] carry his cross, bleeding profusely. And
[2:14:00] human man's spit, hanging on his beard,
[2:14:05] going to Calvary. How he took that body
[2:14:08] and became so vile. It's a body of
[2:14:11] humiliation.
[2:14:13] That's right.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; It's a vile body. It's a lower body.
[2:14:16] It's a lower state. And the scripture
[2:14:18] says he took on the form of man
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; so that we could take on the form of
[2:14:23] God.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; He became us
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; so you could become him.
[2:14:32] And this is part of the rapture. Part of
[2:14:34] the rapture, my friend, my brother, my
[2:14:36] sister. Otherwise, we're sitting here
[2:14:38] today wasting our time. you're wasting
[2:14:42] your time coming and I'm wasting my time
[2:14:44] preaching. And I tell you that God sent
[2:14:47] a vindicated voice to instruct us and to
[2:14:50] tell us exactly. And here he's coming to
[2:14:52] the end of his life laying down the the
[2:14:54] the stepping stones for the rapture. And
[2:14:57] don't let us sit here and say, "Oh, it's
[2:14:59] something, you know, off in the future."
[2:15:01] Here the Lord Jesus Christ trying to get
[2:15:03] you to realize that you're stepping into
[2:15:05] it now by the life you live now by the
[2:15:08] victories you win now. Hallelujah.
[2:15:11] You're stepping into it now.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh,
[2:15:23] I want to I want to go to your booth.
[2:15:27] I want to dwell in your pavilion."
[2:15:32] And the prophet is telling us,
[2:15:37] you follow this,
[2:15:39] you'll come to a permanent pavilion
[2:15:42] that'll never be taken down.
[2:15:45] It won't be temporary anymore. And it
[2:15:47] won't be vile. It won't be of that type.
[2:15:51] But the booth also
[2:15:55] is fenced. It's you're hedged in. You're
[2:15:58] fenced in.
[2:16:01] I thought of that
[2:16:03] just the other day down in
[2:16:07] I believe it was Seattle
[2:16:11] Tacoma.
[2:16:13] There's a woman, she's 90 years old.
[2:16:18] She's spry
[2:16:21] and just last week she walked two miles
[2:16:24] every day from the senior citizens home.
[2:16:28] She walked two miles
[2:16:33] and some man
[2:16:38] took and struck her
[2:16:41] to take her purse
[2:16:43] and took her purse from her and all her
[2:16:45] identification and whatever she had in
[2:16:47] her purse and struck her to the ground
[2:16:51] and shattered her hip.
[2:16:54] and they made a a nurse
[2:16:58] and the woman spoke
[2:17:01] and I thought it was so remarkable. The
[2:17:04] thing that she resented the most is he
[2:17:07] stole my freedom.
[2:17:10] He stole my freedom. He's made me a
[2:17:13] prisoner. In these last maybe months or
[2:17:17] year or two of her life, he's made me a
[2:17:20] prisoner. She wasn't so concerned about
[2:17:23] her money, but he's made me a prisoner.
[2:17:29] And I've seen
[2:17:31] I've witnessed and you don't know what
[2:17:33] goes through my heart to stand by the
[2:17:34] bed of someone and I see their life
[2:17:37] ebbing away
[2:17:40] and I realize they're a prisoner.
[2:17:44] They're a prisoner of this body.
[2:17:47] And I thought of the words of this song.
[2:17:52] This house of clay
[2:17:56] is but a prison.
[2:18:00] Bars of bone.
[2:18:04] Hold my soul.
[2:18:07] But the doors of flesh
[2:18:10] are going to burst wide open.
[2:18:13] Hallelujah. When I move to my pavilion
[2:18:15] in the sky, not his, not mine, but his.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Let me be hedged about in his.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; When the angels come,
[2:18:28] set my spirit free.
[2:18:31] I'll take my flight
[2:18:33] like a mighty a eagle
[2:18:37] when the hills of home
[2:18:40] are calling me.
[2:18:43] Why did the messenger
[2:18:46] preach December the 4th
[2:18:49] rapture? Now, what I want you to do,
[2:18:53] I want you to get those four messages
[2:18:56] because I'm going to be on them in the
[2:18:58] next services.
[2:19:01] And don't you read them like a book
[2:19:05] and don't you listen to it as a message.
[2:19:08] I want you to do what I have been doing,
[2:19:11] saying,
[2:19:14] "Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:19:18] it is you that's preparing me
[2:19:21] to leave this temporary place,
[2:19:26] this vile body.
[2:19:29] Now you speak to me.
[2:19:32] you speak to me what you want me to hear
[2:19:35] and let me be prepared. Let me be made
[2:19:38] ready for the next words. And and just
[2:19:41] see friends, if there's a groaning
[2:19:42] that's going on, there's a desire within
[2:19:45] you. Because as soon as there is and you
[2:19:47] feel and you sense that desire, I want
[2:19:49] you I want you to think immediately
[2:19:52] of the place that he's preparing for
[2:19:54] you.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Immediately because it's that place that
[2:19:59] is causing that desire.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Have you followed that?
[2:20:06] It's that place the same as it was when
[2:20:08] you were in the womb of your mother. You
[2:20:09] didn't know nothing about it. Maybe
[2:20:10] you've walked, you've gone to church,
[2:20:11] you've heard many, many sermons. You
[2:20:13] didn't quite realize it. But today, I
[2:20:16] feel urged of the Holy Spirit.
[2:20:22] I don't know. I may not be with you that
[2:20:24] much longer. I don't know. And I have
[2:20:26] felt strangely moved for me to say what
[2:20:32] needs to be said. And the most important
[2:20:35] thing for you to hear is how God has
[2:20:38] prepared for you to leave this place
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; and move and take that final step. Tell
[2:20:44] you what, there's going to be more
[2:20:46] people disappointed
[2:20:48] than there is that's going to be
[2:20:50] pleased. Few there be that find it.
[2:20:55] Make your calling and election sure.
[2:20:58] Don't let anything anything stand your
[2:21:01] way. And if you get the least little
[2:21:02] twinge in your heart about something
[2:21:04] that you're doing or something that
[2:21:06] you're allowing, the least little twinge
[2:21:08] in your heart,
[2:21:12] forsake it immediately.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Cut it off immediately. I should have
[2:21:16] had a larger amen out of that.
[2:21:21] Forsake it immediately. It's not worth
[2:21:22] it. And let us enter in
[2:21:26] to the kingdom.
[2:21:29] I have a song. Probably most of you
[2:21:34] may not know it,
[2:21:40] but I want to
[2:21:43] say it in closing.
[2:21:54] And our musicians, please.
[2:22:00] Wonder, brother Gary, would you give my
[2:22:02] wife the cordless?
[2:22:06] [Music]
[2:22:08] It's a 2406
[2:22:10] near to the heart of God. How many know
[2:22:13] it?
[2:22:16] Not that many. I'd like everybody.
[2:22:23] This is what the words have been on my
[2:22:25] heart for days now.
[2:22:28] There is a place there is a place there
[2:22:32] is a place of quiet rest
[2:22:36] that is near to the heart of God.
[2:22:41] A place
[2:22:43] where sin cannot molest
[2:22:47] is near to the heart of God. I pray this
[2:22:51] congregation, all of you, even if you're
[2:22:53] here just visiting, maybe you're here
[2:22:54] for the first time.
[2:22:56] Maybe you've been here for 30 years.
[2:23:00] I've been here a long time, but I I want
[2:23:04] to move right into the inspiration of
[2:23:06] this hymn.
[2:23:08] There is a place near to the heart of
[2:23:10] God. Oh God, let me move into that place
[2:23:15] that you have prepared for us.
[2:23:19] Before we sing, let us just bow our
[2:23:21] heads.
[2:23:24] Our Lord Jesus,
[2:23:26] [Music]
[2:23:29] I'm so glad that you have been with us.
[2:23:34] And each person
[2:23:36] would have their own line to fill in,
[2:23:40] their own space to fill in.
[2:23:43] They've walked with you for months, for
[2:23:45] years, or whatever.
[2:23:48] And Lord, how pleased and how thankful I
[2:23:51] am
[2:23:54] with unspeakable
[2:23:57] thanksgiving
[2:24:00] for having been able to walk with you
[2:24:03] [Music]
[2:24:05] and having been able to walk with your
[2:24:07] people,
[2:24:08] [Music]
[2:24:10] having been privileged to walk with your
[2:24:12] prophets,
[2:24:14] having been privileged that these eyes
[2:24:16] saw saw what they saw and ears have
[2:24:18] heard what they've heard.
[2:24:21] And for this congregation, oh God, each
[2:24:23] one of them, I think of how
[2:24:26] you called them,
[2:24:29] how you brought them and how you have
[2:24:31] tenderly led them.
[2:24:34] And we're here today, Lord, having come
[2:24:36] from many different
[2:24:39] lands and languages
[2:24:41] and countries.
[2:24:44] And yet we all can say you're the same
[2:24:47] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:24:50] And your voice is so
[2:24:53] sweet to us, Lord.
[2:24:55] And I ask that you will
[2:24:58] take us tenderly.
[2:25:01] Speak to us, Father,
[2:25:03] God of Israel, God of Abraham, Isaac,
[2:25:06] and Jacob.
[2:25:07] [Music]
[2:25:09] I pray that you'll hear me as I ask that
[2:25:13] your blessing, your blessing
[2:25:16] will be upon
[2:25:18] each precious life, each person,
[2:25:23] each brother and sister, oh God, each
[2:25:26] one listening, whether they be in
[2:25:29] Switzerland or Norway or Africa or New
[2:25:32] Zealand or wherever they may be,
[2:25:34] wherever they may have opportunity to
[2:25:36] hear. Oh God, the services today,
[2:25:40] bless them, I pray. And Lord, as as we
[2:25:45] as we sing and as we meditate, we desire
[2:25:48] to enter into
[2:25:50] that temple, that tabernacle,
[2:25:54] that house, that pavilion, yours, oh
[2:25:58] God.
[2:26:00] Jesus, in your name, may the service end
[2:26:02] the way you want it to end. I pray.
[2:26:06] Shall we stand?
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; There is a place of quiet
[2:26:20] rest
[2:26:21] near to the heart of God.
[2:26:27] A place where sin cannot
[2:26:32] molest.
[2:26:34] near to the heart of God.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus,
[2:26:41] blessed redeemer
[2:26:46] sent from the heart of God.
[2:26:52] Hold us to wait before
[2:26:57] thee
[2:26:58] near to the heart of God. I'll just ask
[2:27:03] you now to just hold silence. I want my
[2:27:06] wife to sing please the second verse and
[2:27:09] we can join her in the chorus.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; There is a place of comfort
[2:27:21] sweet
[2:27:22] near to the heart of God.
[2:27:28] A place where we our savior meet
[2:27:35] near to the heart of God.
[2:27:41] Oh Jesus
[2:27:43] blessed redeemer
[2:27:48] sent from the heart of God.
[2:27:54] Hold us who wait before for the
[2:28:00] near to the heart of God.
[2:28:06] There is a place of full release
[2:28:13] near to the heart of God.
[2:28:18] A place where all is joy and peace. near
[2:28:26] to the heart of God.
[2:28:30] Oh Jesus
[2:28:32] blessed redeemer
[2:28:37] sent from the heart of God.
[2:28:42] Oh
[2:28:44] wait before
[2:28:47] thee
[2:28:49] near to the heart of God.
[2:28:54] I wonder, brother Gary Stany, would you
[2:28:56] please come and pray a prayer of
[2:28:59] blessing upon the people? We're so happy
[2:29:01] to have you.
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:06] You're a good wife, Sister Barbara.
[2:29:11] They say new friends are like silver,
[2:29:13] old friends are like gold, and then
[2:29:14] there's some that are platinum. God
[2:29:17] bless you, brother Gary.
[2:29:21] Ask God's bless you on the people, would
[2:29:23] you?
[2:29:30] Oh great eternal God,
[2:29:34] how can we as mortals ever express
[2:29:39] [Music]
[2:29:40] what you have done for us?
[2:29:44] Surely we've been in your presence this
[2:29:46] morning.
[2:29:48] Surely we've heard from the throne of
[2:29:50] God.
[2:29:52] And surely you have prepared a place for
[2:29:55] those that are part of your children.
[2:30:01] Oh eternal God, we
[2:30:04] are so grateful Lord in your great plan
[2:30:08] of wisdom knowledge.
[2:30:11] You knew there would be a group of
[2:30:13] people
[2:30:14] right here in the 21st century
[2:30:18] that were preparing for a rapture.
[2:30:22] preparing for a translation preparing
[2:30:24] for a move to a better place.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; And Lord, God,
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; it's not one that we pack up to go to,
[2:30:33] God.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; But it's one we're unpacking to go to.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; It's one, Lord, all we need is you Lord,
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; your Holy Spirit will prepare us, Lord,
[2:30:43] for that land
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; and that better place.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Doing so, Lord. And now, Lord, will you
[2:30:48] bless the people?
[2:30:51] And may Lord, as we go, may we keep in
[2:30:54] mind what we've heard this morning.
[2:30:58] And may we take those last four
[2:31:00] messages, as brother Ed has said,
[2:31:05] and may we look at it in a new way.
[2:31:08] This was you speaking through your
[2:31:10] prophet
[2:31:12] for the last 6 or eight hours
[2:31:16] and what you had to say was important.
[2:31:20] And so Lord, may it just
[2:31:23] be become a part of us, Lord, that we'll
[2:31:26] know how how to approach you and how to
[2:31:29] prepare for this rapture.
[2:31:31] And will you bless your people now and
[2:31:33] you meet their needs and you go with
[2:31:36] them. And as we come back tonight, Lord,
[2:31:38] may the Holy Spirit be here again. And
[2:31:42] may you bless our brother serv as he
[2:31:44] ministers and we look forward to hearing
[2:31:46] him. We ask this in your precious name.
[2:31:50] And all the glory and the honor and the
[2:31:51] praise goes unto our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:31:54] who is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:31:57] forever. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Gary, thank you.
[2:32:04] When you read the last four messages,
[2:32:07] you will conclude with leadership
[2:32:10] December the 7th.
[2:32:15] And if you took a summary of that
[2:32:17] message,
[2:32:19] it's two men that ended up in two places
[2:32:23] and that's the end.
[2:32:26] It's all rapture. In the end,
[2:32:29] the rich young ruler ends up in a place
[2:32:32] called hell.
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:36] And Moses ends up in a place called
[2:32:38] heaven
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; and stands with Jesus on Mount
[2:32:42] Transfiguration.
[2:32:44] That is rapture.
[2:32:47] A shout
[2:32:48] for the living. Aren't you glad you've
[2:32:51] heard it? a voice for the resurrected to
[2:32:56] resurrect them and a trumpet that will
[2:32:58] gather those two together
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; and go to our place that has been
[2:33:03] prepared for us.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Only two places. It's only two. You're
[2:33:08] going to go to a multitude of places
[2:33:10] today. But the the marathon I'm talking
[2:33:13] about,
[2:33:15] this marathon, hear me, only has two
[2:33:19] places.
[2:33:21] only two and that's the marathon you are
[2:33:24] in and I am praying earnestly
[2:33:29] that you will cross the line
[2:33:34] to the one he's prepared for us.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:33:39] name. God with you. God bless you.
[2:33:42] God bless you.
[2:33:46] [Music]
