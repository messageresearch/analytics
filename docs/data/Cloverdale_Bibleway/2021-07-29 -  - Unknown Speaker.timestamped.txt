[0:00] willing now i want to show um
[0:03] just a very short video clip and i i
[0:06] want especially uh
[0:08] um i'm thinking that my mind this
[0:10] evening is towards the younger folk the
[0:12] teenagers
[0:13] i want you to watch this video clip that
[0:14] we're going to show now it's a little
[0:16] bit on the humorous side but
[0:18] it has a it has a point that i want to
[0:21] talk about afterwards if the brothers
[0:22] would like to put that video clip on
[0:25] um we're looking at social engineering
[0:34] the gentleman in the elevator now
[0:37] is a candid star these folks who are
[0:39] entering the man with a white shirt the
[0:41] lady with a trench coat
[0:43] and subsequently one other member of our
[0:45] staff
[0:46] will face the rear and you'll see
[0:51] how this man in the treasure
[0:59] he tries to maintain his individuality
[1:04] but little by little
[1:11] he looks at his watch but he's really
[1:13] making an excuse for turning just
[1:16] a little bit more to the wall
[1:20] now we'll try it once again here's the
[1:23] candid subject
[1:24] here comes the candid camera staff three
[1:27] of them at least
[1:29] and this man has apparently been in
[1:33] groups before
[1:52] here's a fella with his hat on in the
[1:54] elevator
[1:56] first he makes a full turn to the rear
[1:58] and charlie closes the door
[2:00] a moment later we have opened the door
[2:03] everybody's changed positions
[2:17] now we'll see if we can
[2:21] now let's use if we can use group
[2:23] pressure for some good
[2:24] now in a moment on charlie's signal
[2:27] everybody turns forward
[2:30] notice they take off their hats
[2:37] and now do you think we could reverse
[2:39] the procedure
[2:40] watch
[2:47] conform it's it's human nature and the
[2:49] devil knows
[2:50] human psychology better than you and i
[2:53] know it
[2:53] better than the psychologist he knows
[2:55] the weakness the frailty
[2:57] of human psychology and there is a power
[3:00] to conform
[3:00] and in laodicea we've been given rights
[3:04] rights we have a right to act like an
[3:06] idiot in this age
[3:08] we have a right to do stupid things in
[3:10] this age and nobody blinks an eye
[3:12] the power to conform and we're talking
[3:15] this evening on human biases
[3:17] in particular social engineering social
[3:20] engineering
[3:21] is a political science it's to do with
[3:24] influencing
[3:25] social behavior social behavior
[3:29] demonology is influencing spirits
[3:32] remember isaiah 6 1 and the year the
[3:34] king uziah died
[3:35] when the influences die
[3:39] but unless you have the holy ghost you
[3:41] will fall folly
[3:42] to peer pressure nobody told the
[3:45] gentleman in the elevator to turn around
[3:47] it's also called monkey see
[3:49] monkey doo
[3:53] and if you haven't got the holy ghost
[3:54] when monkey sees monkey will do
[3:57] because that's just human nature
[4:01] social engineering first one is called
[4:04] the bandwagon effect
[4:06] it's the tendency to do or believe
[4:08] things because many other people believe
[4:10] the same
[4:11] they're called group thinkers or heard
[4:14] thinkers
[4:15] like the gentleman in the elevator
[4:17] monkey see
[4:18] monkey too bandwagon well they watch tv
[4:21] so
[4:22] i'll watch tv or they have a little
[4:24] social drink at
[4:25] christmas time not to offend the
[4:27] unbelieving family you know
[4:30] so if they do i can do it it's called
[4:32] the bad wagon effect it's a bias it's a
[4:34] cognitive bias it's the way humans
[4:37] distort reality just to justify
[4:40] themselves
