[18:26] Lord, for you are the true and living
[18:28] God, a God who is most holy, Lord.
[18:31] And Lord Jesus, we desire that holy
[18:34] presence amongst us this morning, Lord.
[18:37] Father, we can get ourselves out of the
[18:39] way that we can push aside the flesh. We
[18:42] can push aside our spirits, Lord, and
[18:44] enter into thy spirit, Lord. For they
[18:46] that worship you must worship you in
[18:48] spirit and in truth, Lord. And how we
[18:51] love to worship you, Lord. When we think
[18:53] of what you've done for us, Lord, when
[18:55] we think of where we once were.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; We think of the amazing grace that
[18:59] picked us up, Lord, when we were deep in
[19:01] sin.
[19:03] Oh God, for the the gift of grace, Lord
[19:06] Jesus, that has changed our lives,
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Lord. We have much to thank you for,
[19:10] Lord. We have much to be appreciative
[19:12] of, Lord God. And we want to give you
[19:14] the praise, Lord God. We want to open up
[19:16] our hearts, Lord. I pray, dear God,
[19:19] you'd even give us utterance, Lord
[19:21] Jesus, just to express, Lord, all that
[19:23] you've done for us, Father. Words fail
[19:25] us, Lord. But how we want to say, Lord
[19:28] Jesus, we love you.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; How we love you, dear God. We appreciate
[19:32] you. We adore you, Lord God. And how we
[19:35] want, Lord Jesus, our lives, just not
[19:37] our voices, but our lives to praise you.
[19:39] We want our lives to be a sweet smelling
[19:41] savior in your nostrils, Lord, that our
[19:44] prayers would ascend up to the throne of
[19:46] grace, Lord. Father, mix with that
[19:48] incense, Lord God, of faith and praise,
[19:51] Lord God, that you would hear the needs
[19:53] of your children this morning, Lord.
[19:55] Father, each one of us are needy, Lord.
[19:58] Each one of us has a need, Lord, in our
[20:00] lives. Father, many are more needy than
[20:02] others, Father. But dear God, no matter
[20:05] what the need, whether it be great or
[20:07] small in our eyes, Lord, Father, they're
[20:09] all important to you. For Lord, you're
[20:12] caring for us. You love us, Lord. You
[20:14] want what's best for us. And Lord Jesus,
[20:17] we approach you this morning, Lord, with

[20:28] dear God. Lord Jesus losing a part of
[20:31] himself, a part of his life, dear God, a
[20:33] part of his existence here. Lord, the
[20:35] next best thing out of salvation that
[20:37] you can give a man, Lord, is a godly
[20:38] wife. And Lord, for whatever reason,
[20:41] you've taken her home, Lord. We pray
[20:43] this time you'll give our brother
[20:44] strength, dear God. Lord, as he's now,
[20:48] Lord, alone without his wife, we pray
[20:50] that you'll comfort him and give him

[20:56] anchor in Christ, Lord. that you Lord

[21:33] but for their salvation. That they would
[21:36] be, Lord Jesus, brought into the light
[21:38] of the gospel of this day, Lord. Father,
[21:40] they would see Jesus Christ in us, dear
[21:42] God, their loved ones. That we would

[21:49] Lord, on this side, Father, grant them,
[21:52] Lord Jesus, being a bride, the bride of

[21:59] than that, Lord. Oh, Father, we just
[22:02] reach up high, dear God, to the promises
[22:04] of God that are laying before us. Lord

[22:34] service, Lord, in the archives, or the
[22:36] videos, Lord Jesus, you're the same
[22:38] yesterday, today, and forever. Your
[22:40] presence ever abides with us, dear God.
[22:43] May you intend to the need of each one.
[22:45] Lord, the heart's desire that you've had
[22:48] on your that you've laid upon your
[22:49] people's heart, Lord, and the the word
[22:52] that you have placed upon our pastor to
[22:54] speak to us this morning, Lord Jesus,
[22:57] how we need to hear it this morning. We
[23:00] need to hear what the spirit is saying
[23:02] to the bride. Not a man, Lord God, but
[23:06] the presence, the angel of the Lord,

[23:10] prepare our way in this hour. Lord, give
[23:13] us tender hearts as we would worship

[23:29] pastor will have liberty, Lord. Not
[23:32] bound by time, not bound by what he
[23:36] thinks or what the people are thinking,
[23:38] Lord.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; But dear God, this is an hour from which
[23:40] we need to get ourselves out of the way.
[23:43] We need to lay everything aside, dear
[23:45] God.

[23:48] moment, Lord, that rapturing time when
[23:50] we'll be changed, Lord.

[23:53] that translation.

[27:28] children that we don't hear very often
[27:29] and they practice, they get a chance
[27:31] they're out of school and they practice
[27:32] up for the watch night service. So, if
[27:36] you have a song that you'd like to sing
[27:38] or your children would like to sing, if
[27:41] you could please contact Sister Bonnie
[27:44] uh in the office and we'd ask you to do
[27:46] that before noon on Friday, before noon
[27:51] on December the 24th. If you could let
[27:53] her know and then she'll get all the
[27:54] information to me and we can get
[27:56] everything put together for the watch
[27:57] night service, we would really
[27:59] appreciate that a lot.
[28:02] Amen.
[28:04] Um,

[28:08] 2375. We would stand together. Some of
[28:11] these songs, you know, you could come
[28:12] into our house sometimes, maybe in July,
[28:15] and hear the stereo going and you'll

[28:20] songs are wonderful songs. And, uh, you
[28:22] don't need to just sing it this time of
[28:24] year. This song, I believe, was written
[28:26] by Charles Wesley, who was the brother
[28:29] of John Wesley, church age messenger.
[28:32] And uh I tell you there's a real message
[28:33] in this song. So let's sing it out.
[28:36] Amen. Sing the top of your lungs. Amen.
[28:39] I look sometimes and I see some people
[28:40] look at me. Their lips are hardly
[28:42] moving. Open your lips loud, wide, and
[28:45] sing to the Lord. Amen. Don't sing for
[28:46] me, but sing to the Lord.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[28:53] angels sing. Glory to you for me. Peace
[29:00] on earth and mercy.

[35:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[35:28] We've come this morning to adore him.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; And he's the only one that's worthy.
[35:33] Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to lift him up in the
[35:37] highest place.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a wonderful time really
[35:42] last evening with the young people and
[35:47] uh brother Tom directed in a certain
[35:51] thought and then brother Murphy spoke to
[35:54] the young people told of his youth and
[35:58] told of being in China and having never
[36:03] heard the name of Jesus Christ.
[36:06] And I was very very impressed as he
[36:08] spoke to the young people and all of you
[36:10] that were there last evening.
[36:14] Uh I was I was very impressed with the
[36:17] fact that he said it was the young
[36:20] people when he arrived here at the
[36:22] church
[36:24] having come from a godless nation
[36:27] arrived here at the church. He said it
[36:29] was your lives that preached to me.
[36:34] and uh he said and so I come tonight
[36:37] respecting you and I really think I
[36:41] don't know if it took the young people
[36:42] by surprise but it took me by surprise
[36:46] and I thought it was such an honor to
[36:49] have a a brother as brother Murphy is so
[36:52] affected by the lives of the young
[36:55] people and uh
[37:00] I think that uh the Young people want to
[37:05] be mindful that your lives
[37:09] have a big effect on others and you
[37:13] don't want to allow Satan to tamper with
[37:16] your youth.
[37:18] You reserve yourself and give your best
[37:21] to Jesus Christ.
[37:23] It's been a common statement by people
[37:26] who have a few years that have passed by
[37:30] when they've said, "I only wish I'd
[37:32] heard it earlier. I only wish I had come
[37:36] earlier. I wish I had given the best of
[37:39] my life and the best of my youth and my
[37:43] strength." So serve him with all your
[37:46] heart. Can we say amen?
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; So it was a lovely evening. And we have
[37:51] a note here also. I know that many of
[37:53] you many of you have been praying for uh
[37:57] Sharon Hunt. And so we have a a note
[38:01] that the Hunt and the Vanenter families
[38:06] would like to thank everyone who thought
[38:08] and prayed for Sharon at this time.
[38:12] Sharon had major surgery to remove a
[38:16] large but benign cyst from her brain and
[38:20] she is recovering remarkably well and
[38:24] will be home early next week. The Lord
[38:28] willing. We give all thanks to the Lord
[38:31] who has sheltered us under his wings.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want you to
[38:37] rejoice uh with the Hunt and Vanenter
[38:41] families.
[38:43] Amen.
[38:45] Turn in your Bibles if you would to
[38:47] Exodus. And while you're turning, we're
[38:48] just going to sing that song uh if you
[38:51] would please. Uh
[38:54] I place you in the highest place.
[39:02] I praise you
[39:06] in the highest place.
[39:09] [Music]
[39:11] For you
[39:14] are my great I
[39:21] [Music]
[39:36] and we come to you
[39:40] and worship
[39:42] at glory.
[39:47] We can all join our hearts together once
[39:49] again.
[39:51] We praise you. Yes,
[39:54] in the highest place
[39:57] [Music]
[39:59] for you.
[40:03] I
[40:07] praise you.
[40:11] I
[40:13] [Music]
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:19] amen.
[40:23] And we come.
[40:25] [Music]
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Exodus the 20th chapter.
[40:44] We're going to read the first six
[40:45] verses.
[40:56] And God spake all these words, saying,
[41:01] I am the Lord thy God, which have
[41:04] brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
[41:07] and out of the house of bondage.
[41:10] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[41:13] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[41:16] image, or any likeness,
[41:19] or anything that is in heaven above, or
[41:23] that is in the earth beneath, or that is
[41:26] in the water under the earth. Thou shalt
[41:29] not bow
[41:31] down thyself to them, nor serve them.
[41:34] For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
[41:39] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[41:41] upon the children unto the third and
[41:44] fourth generation of them that hate me,
[41:47] and showing mercy unto thousands of them
[41:50] that love me and keep my commandments.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray one more time.
[41:58] Father, this is your word. We start out
[42:01] with the words and God said.
[42:04] Lord, we know that you have spoken in
[42:07] this day. And we can we can say and God
[42:10] has said.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you for the words
[42:13] not of a man but of God. And you are not
[42:17] ashamed to identify yourself with your
[42:19] word. You're not ashamed to confirm it
[42:22] with the supernatural. And you are a
[42:24] supernatural God. And all that you do is
[42:27] supernatural. You have worked in each of
[42:29] our lives in a supernatural way or we
[42:32] could not be here today. You delivered
[42:34] us from the shackles of sin and from the
[42:37] reign of death and darkness. Oh God,
[42:40] you've delivered us from the dismal life
[42:42] of sin and unbelief. And you've given us
[42:44] hearts to believe and we cannot be
[42:47] anything other than what you have made
[42:48] us to be. We've come here to glorify
[42:51] you. Now we pray that we will be you
[42:53] will be glorified in the ministry of
[42:55] your word and that the people you'll be
[42:58] glorified amongst them Lord as they
[43:00] believe your word and may the Holy
[43:03] Spirit have preeminence in Jesus
[43:06] Christ's name. Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And you may be seated.
[43:13] Nice to see you all this morning, this
[43:15] lovely day.
[43:17] and uh to all that are
[43:22] listening and streaming with us.
[43:25] I uh just looked at some of the names
[43:29] and the places just yesterday to see uh
[43:34] you know from what countries and really
[43:37] it is really quite amazing when you sing
[43:40] and when you worship and when you praise
[43:43] the God of our redemption it's it's uh I
[43:48] want you to be mindful that there's
[43:50] people in countries all around the world
[43:53] that are uh listening with you and
[43:56] rejoicing with you and participating
[43:59] feeding on the body word of the son of
[44:02] man with you today and may God bless
[44:05] them. The scripture which we have read
[44:08] today
[44:10] uh
[44:11] God speaking to the children of Israel
[44:15] and I thought when I read this thou
[44:17] shalt have no other gods before me. I'm
[44:21] following along in the same series of in
[44:24] his steps but I are taking for a subject
[44:26] today no other gods.
[44:29] Uh you would have thought that that kind
[44:33] of a commandment
[44:35] would have been given to uh the Hebrews,
[44:39] the children of Israel in Egypt
[44:42] when they were in a a a nation of
[44:46] heathen gods. You would have thought
[44:48] that that's where God would have given
[44:50] that commandment
[44:52] rather than after they've been taken out
[44:55] and delivered with a mighty hand and
[44:58] they they're out now in the wilderness.
[45:01] You would think that in that kind of an
[45:02] environment it wouldn't be so necessary
[45:06] to say to them, you shall have no other
[45:08] gods.
[45:09] when you think of that. But you know
[45:12] there is there is one principle
[45:15] there is a thing that is very very
[45:20] uh uh it's consistent through the
[45:23] scripture and that is that when God
[45:26] makes himself known when God reveals
[45:30] himself to the people
[45:35] that is the time that the people are
[45:37] most susceptible
[45:39] they become God conscious.
[45:42] They see God doing things and they
[45:45] become, you know, like we are a people
[45:48] of revelation. You never hear a a people
[45:51] speak so much about revelation and being
[45:54] revelated as it is amongst the believers
[45:57] of the message. And that makes a person
[46:00] susceptible to as soon as you hear about
[46:03] revelation or I got a revelation or or
[46:05] this is a mighty revelation. You know,
[46:07] your ears right away are perked up
[46:09] because you want to hear because you've
[46:11] been attuned to that. And now God came
[46:15] and showed himself to Israel as a God of
[46:19] might and and a God of deliverance. And
[46:22] now they've had the mana in the
[46:24] wilderness. They've had water from the
[46:26] rock. They've had uh walked out on dry
[46:29] land through things that we can't even
[46:32] hardly imagine. And they they actually
[46:35] lived it. They experienced it. They
[46:38] drank that water. They ate that mana.
[46:41] They walked through that dry ground.
[46:43] They saw the water walled up. They saw
[46:46] the huge mighty army of the Egyptians.
[46:50] They saw it destroyed. They saw the hand
[46:53] of God. They lived through the plagues
[46:55] of Egypt. and they had walked out with
[46:58] this uh mighty deliverance. And the
[47:01] Bible speaks of it throughout the
[47:03] scripture in many places that it was
[47:05] with a mighty hand that God delivered
[47:07] them. And he just nicely gets them out
[47:09] in this wilderness and says to them,
[47:12] "You'll have no other gods before me."
[47:15] You'd think, "Why would God say that to
[47:18] me? What other god would I have besides
[47:21] this kind of a god? What other God would
[47:24] I have than a God that delivered me and
[47:26] has just done all these things? But God
[47:29] knew that in revealing himself to the
[47:32] people, in making himself known, they
[47:35] became susceptible to having other gods.
[47:38] And it didn't take very long because
[47:41] here when God is speaking that they're
[47:43] down there making a calf
[47:47] &gt;&gt; already making a calf saying make us a
[47:50] calf and let these be the gods the gods
[47:55] that will go before us that brought us
[47:57] out of Egypt.
[48:00] There's uh there has to be a genuine
[48:03] before there's a counterfeit.
[48:06] And that's why this principle applies.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And we I'm speaking this because we're a
[48:13] people that speak of the fullness of the
[48:16] coming of the word in this day.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; And you can be sure that Satan has an
[48:23] allout frontal attack more subtle than
[48:27] we're perhaps uh think of
[48:31] on a day-to-day basis. more subtle and
[48:34] coming from more directions. But yet,
[48:37] oh, we have the we have the the comfort
[48:39] and the confidence that the bride won't
[48:41] be deceived. But it doesn't mean that we
[48:44] won't be harassed. We won't it doesn't
[48:48] mean that we won't be attacked from
[48:49] every direction. And the scriptures been
[48:52] given to us so that we are forewarned
[48:55] ahead of time and so that we are on the
[48:58] alert. And the prophet still talks about
[49:01] us knowing our enemy and studying his
[49:04] tactics and knowing how he works and
[49:07] knowing how he attacks so that we're
[49:09] ready that we're fortified. And that's
[49:11] why we have to preach this way.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; And who do you say this is?
[49:18] A 64 message. He says they followed the
[49:21] pillar of fire to the promised land.
[49:24] Those that went all the way through did.
[49:28] the others perished. He said, notice
[49:31] they wanted the word mixed with the
[49:34] world.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; They wanted it both ways.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; And he said, cause caused them, this
[49:41] caused them to air because they wanted
[49:43] it mixed. They wanted the word that they
[49:46] had received mixed with the world. And
[49:49] that caused them to air. And notice what
[49:52] it did to them. He said they missed it
[49:55] because they wouldn't accept the
[49:57] anointed word. First, you have to have
[49:59] the real one to make a counterfeit off
[50:02] of it. And that is why the other gods
[50:05] always come after the revelation of God.
[50:08] Yeah. You have a message like this and
[50:10] then people get all taken up and say,
[50:12] "Oh, these went off and they've got, you
[50:14] know, they're identified with the
[50:16] message and they're believing this and
[50:18] oh, such weird stuff and such." It the
[50:21] the genuine had to come first.
[50:24] had to come first and then all these
[50:26] things can come. But none of these
[50:29] things move me.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; None of these things will move the
[50:33] bride. The ones that keep the word, the
[50:36] word, remember now when the word came,
[50:40] that was when they knew who God was. And
[50:43] that when truth comes, that's when a
[50:46] person can worship the true God in a
[50:48] true way.
[50:51] In the token he said Satan has thrown
[50:54] all kinds of counterfeits.
[50:57] Notice what he talks about as
[50:58] counterfeits of shaking hands of
[51:01] evidences and everything like that. He
[51:04] said forget it. The hour has arrived
[51:08] that the token itself capital I a person
[51:12] the token itself not some counterfeit
[51:16] makebelieve substitutionary anything.
[51:19] The hour is here when the token himself
[51:23] &gt;&gt; has is identifying himself right among
[51:27] us and proving that he is the same Jesus
[51:30] yesterday, today, and forever. And he's
[51:34] right with the word. He is the word.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; But when he makes himself known, that's
[51:39] when bogus counterfeits can arrive on
[51:42] the scene. And and and the world's got
[51:45] plenty of them. And we need to preach
[51:47] like this. We need to be forewarned
[51:49] about these things so that we don't just
[51:51] jump and run after this that or the
[51:53] other thing. We just go straight forward
[51:56] with the with the gospel that has been
[51:58] brought to us. The word that God
[52:01] confirmed and it is a supernatural
[52:03] gospel.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; He said if you see a bogus dollar, we
[52:09] all have.
[52:11] We've heard bogus message. We all have.
[52:14] No doubt. Then you know there's a
[52:17] genuine.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; You know there's a counterfeit. Somebody
[52:20] says, "Oh, well there's so many
[52:22] hypocrites in the church. That's why I'm
[52:24] not going there anymore." You've just
[52:26] reduced yourself below the hypocrite.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; You've just had a hypocrite stop you
[52:30] from something good.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; You just had a hypocrite dictate to your
[52:34] life.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; And to me, that doesn't keep a person
[52:38] that that doesn't raise a person in my
[52:40] in my uh image very much because they
[52:42] say, "Oh, there's hypocrites in the
[52:44] church." Well, uh you don't want to be
[52:47] one that uh uh you don't want to be one
[52:49] that has a hypocrite dictate to you what
[52:52] you're going to do
[52:54] &gt;&gt; in the message be certain of God.
[52:56] Incidentally, one of my
[52:59] one of my favorite messages and the
[53:01] reason why when a person has
[53:05] I've said to people that stood right
[53:07] here with serious illness said there's
[53:10] two things that I recommend you do and
[53:12] you you you arrive at a time that is a
[53:16] serious time for you. You want to
[53:18] remember these two things. Number one,
[53:21] follow the word of God to the letter.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; It says if you I if any man be
[53:29] afflicted, let him pray.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Is any sick, let him call.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And it is not if any man's afflicted,
[53:39] let him hope that the preacher will run
[53:41] to him. If any man's afflicted, any
[53:44] woman's afflicted, you pray.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And if you're sick, you call. And that's
[53:50] how God works. And the second thing is
[53:54] in the message, be certain of God. I
[53:56] recommend that you take that, carry
[53:58] that, read that, hold it on your person,
[54:01] keep it in your case,
[54:04] keep it in your car, keep it in the tape
[54:06] deck, and you hear a prophet saying how
[54:10] many times he said, "I've gone back and
[54:12] turned over every stone."
[54:15] And still, when he remains silent, then
[54:18] you have to be certain that he's God.
[54:20] Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Ah that's wonderful. And in that message
[54:25] he said and it's a very he said it's a
[54:29] very picture of our country today. We
[54:32] have fallen under the popular demand.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; No doubt that the priests thought it
[54:39] would be all right as long as their
[54:41] government okayed it. But he says I
[54:44] don't care what the governments. It's
[54:46] got to be what Gods.
[54:49] And the people thought that it would be
[54:51] all right if they anticipated
[54:54] uh anticipated in some uh some of the
[54:58] worldly things. And one might ask me to
[55:02] retrace what I just what I have just
[55:05] said. He said that is a that is a very
[55:08] likely picture of today. He said we may
[55:11] not think that we are idol worshippers.
[55:15] speaking to a a nation now and he's
[55:18] speaking to a lot of believers. He says,
[55:21] "But we are." And the government
[55:23] endorses it. People today are idol
[55:26] worshippers because they worship idols.
[55:29] Some of them worship movie stars for
[55:32] idols. And I trust there's no one here.
[55:36] Now, we may think, I just want you to
[55:38] get where I'm coming from, may think,
[55:41] well, I don't fall down. I don't
[55:43] prostrate myself. But I guess that's not
[55:46] the point. The critical point is this,
[55:49] hear me,
[55:51] is is there or does some of these
[55:56] whether they they're godless people,
[55:59] whether they would be a movie star or a
[56:02] politician or a a sports star or some
[56:07] Olympic star or something else?
[56:11] Do they influence the individual
[56:14] to the degree that they veer off the
[56:19] standard of the word of God?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; And if they do, then they are calling
[56:25] they are demanding out from you a focus
[56:29] a a respect
[56:32] that should be going to God.
[56:36] And if they do, that individual who's
[56:41] being persuaded, who's being influenced,
[56:44] who's digressing from the a a clearcut
[56:48] commandment of God, the covenant of God,
[56:51] that person is in danger of bowing down
[56:54] to that per that individual, which
[56:57] becomes an idolatrous act rather than to
[57:01] God himself. Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; God is made known by his word.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And God has made his word very very I
[57:10] would say abundantly clear. And so then
[57:13] he said
[57:15] some of them worship movie stars for
[57:17] idols. Brother Brandham talks like but
[57:19] the waterhead waterhead haircut or the
[57:23] hairdo that the women had in his time.
[57:26] Well, you don't see it today but it
[57:28] didn't. And it was all over in front of
[57:30] him. It was everywhere. It was
[57:32] acceptable. It was the in thing at that
[57:36] time for the ladies and no one really
[57:39] took an issue with it. But he raised it
[57:42] up. And I'll tell you one thing, it
[57:44] perhaps not so much the design of it,
[57:46] not so much the design of it, but the
[57:48] source of it.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; It came from a politician's wife. It
[57:53] came from the wife of the president, I
[57:56] believe. And that's how it had
[57:57] influenced a nation. And so that is what
[58:01] we have to see. What is the source of
[58:04] it? Where did it come from in the first
[58:07] place?
[58:09] And so he said some of them worship
[58:12] movie stars for idols. Some worship
[58:14] money for idols. Some worship television
[58:18] stars as idols. But all that you put
[58:21] before God, and here we have it. All
[58:24] that you put before God is,
[58:29] let it be, whatever it might be, it is
[58:32] an idol.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; All that you put before God. And so then
[58:36] some say, well, I'm not able to serve
[58:38] God. I'm not able I I I know that's what
[58:40] the word says. I know that's what the
[58:42] message says. But but this and the other
[58:45] thing, and this is very reasonable, and
[58:46] that is that's very essential. That's
[58:48] very actually I can say it's almost
[58:51] necessary but not quite necessary. You
[58:54] know there are things that seem so
[58:56] important to us but you just get struck
[58:59] down with sickness once
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and everything that's important just
[59:03] faded away.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; I can tell you I had a I have a
[59:07] granddaughter. She's in the hospital
[59:08] today and we're so thankful she'll be
[59:10] coming out Lord willing maybe tomorrow
[59:13] the next day. But you know, you're just
[59:15] here. You you you just rise up. You get
[59:18] up in the morning and everything's just
[59:20] fine. You're just on your you're getting
[59:22] ready for, you know, whatever whatever.
[59:25] And uh and suddenly
[59:28] everything's changed.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Everything's changed. And everything
[59:32] that you had all scheduled that was so
[59:35] vital, so important. Oh, you couldn't
[59:38] set that aside for nothing.
[59:41] You You set it aside. You set it aside
[59:44] real quick and you maybe spent your time
[59:47] in the emergency ward at the at the
[59:50] hospital. Nice to see you, Brother
[59:51] Frank. And I understand you were there
[59:53] last night. I'm glad you're here. I
[59:56] wondered about you this morning. Praise
[59:57] God. But it it can change your it will
[1:00:01] change your uh agenda real quick.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Real quick. And things that are so
[1:00:07] important. Oh, they're so important. and
[1:00:09] the plans and the preparations and the
[1:00:12] things and the obligations and the
[1:00:15] responsibilities and all of those
[1:00:17] things. You only have to hear one little
[1:00:19] short phrase
[1:00:21] and it's all gone.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; It's just not important anymore.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; I know brother Bob Hansen, you got up of
[1:00:28] a morning and he's a busy man. I'll tell
[1:00:32] you what, everything that he had
[1:00:34] scheduled was rearranged very suddenly.
[1:00:39] Not very long ago, it was all changed.
[1:00:43] Events just simply have a way. And let
[1:00:46] me say this, you're strong, healthy,
[1:00:50] youthful, perhaps beautiful, mature,
[1:00:52] family, secure, all the rest of it. That
[1:00:55] can change in just a moment.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; In just a moment. And your world is
[1:01:01] turned upside down. Is that not true?
[1:01:05] And that is why we want to live with our
[1:01:07] feet solidly planted upon the word of
[1:01:10] God in this hour. Because that person
[1:01:14] whose feet are planted upon the word of
[1:01:16] God, they shall not be moved.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
[1:01:25] word shall not pass away.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Not the blessings.
[1:01:30] The blessings come and the blessings go.
[1:01:33] Not some of these other things or or the
[1:01:35] emotion or the good feeling or whatever
[1:01:37] more. They come and they go and the
[1:01:40] material things come and go. But my word
[1:01:44] is forever settled in heaven.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Once truth is revealed,
[1:01:54] that is when all of the counterfeit can
[1:01:57] come on.
[1:01:59] Jesus said to the woman at the well,
[1:02:01] "You worship, you know not what? For
[1:02:04] salvation is of the Jews."
[1:02:07] He says, "But the hour cometh, and now
[1:02:09] is when true worshippers shall worship
[1:02:11] the Father in spirit and in truth. For
[1:02:13] the Father seeketh such to worship him."
[1:02:19] They had a pleasant, you know, this
[1:02:22] happens just on a regular basis, but
[1:02:24] just on Wednesday, it just finished and
[1:02:27] that that was my text, I believe. That
[1:02:30] was the text
[1:02:32] and I just walked out into the foyer of
[1:02:34] the church and brother Steve Ryus Rivas
[1:02:37] met me and he said, "This is so unusual
[1:02:42] this morning." He said this came to me
[1:02:46] but the father seeketh such to worship
[1:02:49] him and he said I was so gripped with
[1:02:51] that he is seeking God is seeking
[1:02:56] such to worship him he's actually
[1:02:58] seeking this kind of worshipper and he
[1:03:00] says I was so gripped with the I I
[1:03:02] needed to understand that he said I was
[1:03:04] going to call you I going to call
[1:03:05] brother Tom and ask you to please
[1:03:08] expound on this because I needed to know
[1:03:10] what that meant and what he didn't know
[1:03:14] was that was not my text. I had a series
[1:03:17] of other scriptures to lead into my
[1:03:20] message at the last service. And and as
[1:03:23] I was coming closer to the service, I
[1:03:25] thought somehow that is not the
[1:03:28] scripture that I'm to read. And the
[1:03:31] scripture I'm to read is God seeketh
[1:03:33] such to worship him. And I I changed the
[1:03:37] scripture completely and approached it
[1:03:39] from another direction. And here a
[1:03:40] brother in the church was looking to God
[1:03:43] saying, "I need to I need to minister to
[1:03:45] expound on that." Doesn't God know our
[1:03:49] individual
[1:03:50] individual needs? It just it it's so
[1:03:53] kind of him to do that. He said, "God is
[1:03:55] a spirit and they that worship him must
[1:03:57] worship him in spirit and in truth."
[1:04:00] Now, Jesus did not preach a sermon to
[1:04:02] the woman about this mountain or about
[1:04:06] Jerusalem. He didn't preach a woman. He
[1:04:08] didn't preach a sermon to the woman
[1:04:11] concerning how she should worship and
[1:04:13] what was wrong with the worship and and
[1:04:15] and who God was and all the rest of it.
[1:04:18] All he did, and here's the principle
[1:04:20] once again, he just unveiled who the
[1:04:23] anointed word was. He just kept drawing
[1:04:27] her in until she saw who the Messiah
[1:04:30] was. And who when she saw who the
[1:04:32] Messiah was, who the word was, her
[1:04:35] worship was automatic.
[1:04:37] Hallelujah. And she was born of the
[1:04:39] spirit and of the word.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He just revealed who the
[1:04:45] word was right in her time. Didn't go
[1:04:47] back. Well, how this mountain became
[1:04:50] sacred or how Jerusalem became so sacred
[1:04:54] to the Jews. He could have gone into a
[1:04:56] whole lot of history and whole lot of
[1:04:58] theology. He didn't do anything. He just
[1:05:01] kept dealing with her, drawing her in,
[1:05:04] going from the physical, from the water,
[1:05:06] going to the spirit to the worship part,
[1:05:08] and then revealing the word himself. And
[1:05:10] once the word was revealed, she knew,
[1:05:14] she knew, "Thou art the Christ."
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Her worship then could be what it was
[1:05:21] supposed to be. Now
[1:05:25] all that appears to be as worship
[1:05:30] is not necessarily worship.
[1:05:33] You know we sing and I love singing. I
[1:05:36] love music
[1:05:39] and I've never
[1:05:41] I haven't spent
[1:05:44] much of my life in uh in the world.
[1:05:48] We'll be going in a
[1:05:51] store or a mall or a restaurant. I'll be
[1:05:53] sitting with,
[1:05:55] you know, some of you and and just even
[1:05:58] recently some says, "Oh, that that's a
[1:06:01] song that was popular when I was in the
[1:06:02] world."
[1:06:04] And it comes into their mind and you
[1:06:06] know, it's it's a it's a memory that
[1:06:08] they don't really want to have.
[1:06:11] Doesn't mean a thing to me. I don't even
[1:06:12] hear it. I don't unless it's obnoxious
[1:06:15] with its you know it its volume and so
[1:06:18] on doesn't mean a thing to me and uh and
[1:06:21] I think that's a wonderful thing if we
[1:06:23] haven't even got those things in our
[1:06:24] memory
[1:06:26] but there's a lot of things that we
[1:06:29] identify today now listen I want you to
[1:06:31] hear it a lot of things that we do is in
[1:06:34] worship you know maybe raise our hands
[1:06:36] and so on there there's not much in the
[1:06:39] scripture
[1:06:41] in the life of Christ that he actually
[1:06:44] did. We don't have any record that they
[1:06:46] sang a lot of songs. We don't have any
[1:06:50] record that they were shouting with
[1:06:52] praises and so on. We have it in the
[1:06:54] scripture. The Psalms is full of it and
[1:06:58] other places in the scripture, but I'm
[1:06:59] talking about Christ now. There was not
[1:07:02] a great deal. And yet, hear me. And yet,
[1:07:06] because this will really define my point
[1:07:08] this morning. And yet there could be no
[1:07:12] person that ever lived
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:17] more worshiped God in perfection than
[1:07:20] Christ himself.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; His fellowship with God was immediate.
[1:07:26] That means at any moment at any time,
[1:07:28] day or night, his fellowship was
[1:07:30] immediate.
[1:07:33] He his life was a was a complete
[1:07:37] expression of the invisible God.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; He lived in a realm. Brother Brandham
[1:07:42] says he lived in another world.
[1:07:45] And it's not that it's in a world that
[1:07:47] we just can't touch, but it is that he
[1:07:50] was the living example for us. And so
[1:07:53] first and foremost is not how you sing
[1:07:57] or how you praise or how you raise your
[1:08:00] hand or those things. First and foremost
[1:08:03] is how you respond to the word of God.
[1:08:07] That's first and foremost because you
[1:08:10] can have all the other activity but if
[1:08:12] the life isn't responding to the word of
[1:08:14] God, the other becomes quite meaningless
[1:08:17] and it becomes quite empty. They're
[1:08:19] singing all over this valley today, all
[1:08:22] over these cities, all over throughout
[1:08:24] these churches and music and instruments
[1:08:26] and choirs and whatever more. And we're
[1:08:29] not the only people that raise our
[1:08:30] hands. We're not the only people that
[1:08:32] clap. We're not the only people that
[1:08:34] shout. We're not the only people that
[1:08:36] praise. It's on the lips of multitudes
[1:08:38] of people. But outside of the word of
[1:08:41] God, it becomes quite vain and empty.
[1:08:46] and how we thank God for the living
[1:08:48] word. And our life must match the word
[1:08:51] of God.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Our life, your life is to be in harmony
[1:08:56] with the word of God. And then I can say
[1:08:59] even if you haven't uttered anything,
[1:09:01] you're already worshiping God.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Your life is a worship to God.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] Brother Brandham said about Cain.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Abel by faith offered unto God a more
[1:09:20] excellent sacrifice.
[1:09:23] He didn't have no Bible to go by. So he
[1:09:27] must have been by revelation.
[1:09:32] There's revelation to Abel. There was
[1:09:34] both boys. He said, "If God only
[1:09:37] requires worship, hear it now. If God
[1:09:40] only requires worship, then God is
[1:09:44] unjust to condemn Cain."
[1:09:46] Cain made an altar.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Cain built a church. He built a church.
[1:09:52] He says, "Worshiped and made a
[1:09:55] sacrifice.
[1:09:57] Every religious thing that Abel did, so
[1:10:01] did Cain." Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; But Abel by revelation offered to God.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; He said it is it's a revelation.
[1:10:11] He said you walk by faith.
[1:10:14] You walk by faith a more excellent
[1:10:17] sacrifice.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You walk by faith
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; and faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:10:24] by the word of God. and that we walk by
[1:10:29] that a more excellent sacrifice.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; How did Abel know know that it wasn't
[1:10:39] fruit of the fields that Cain offered?
[1:10:42] It was blood that brought them from the
[1:10:44] garden and life was not in the fruit but
[1:10:47] blood brought the life. It was revealed
[1:10:51] to him.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation. So the the main
[1:10:55] root of worship comes from a
[1:10:59] relationship that we have as individuals
[1:11:02] with the word of God. The word of God is
[1:11:05] a person.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; The word of God is Christ.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Abel's worship was connected
[1:11:18] to the act of God slaying animals. His
[1:11:23] worship was connected to an act that God
[1:11:27] committed
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; by slaying an animal to get a to get
[1:11:31] coverings for his fallen children.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And so by revelation
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; even prior to his birth, he was
[1:11:40] connected to something that God did.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, friends, we're
[1:11:46] sitting here today. We're worshiping a
[1:11:48] word that connects us with things with
[1:11:51] the act of God prior to our even coming
[1:11:54] here.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; David got so anointed. David now David a
[1:12:01] friend of God.
[1:12:06] David
[1:12:08] an anointed of God. David a king.
[1:12:13] He was so anointed. He was so enthused
[1:12:16] and he was going to do the right thing.
[1:12:18] It was the correct thing. The ark that
[1:12:21] carried the word was in another place
[1:12:24] and it needed to come back. The word
[1:12:27] belonged to be with the people and he
[1:12:30] got enthused about it. And so now here
[1:12:36] he consulted the wrong people
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; wanting to do the right thing. had the
[1:12:44] right desire and was the right person
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; but he consulted the wrong people. He
[1:12:52] consulted captains
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; of thousands
[1:12:56] and captains of hundreds and he had men
[1:13:00] of of stature around him. He had men who
[1:13:05] had a good in IQ. They had an
[1:13:08] intelligence and men of experience.
[1:13:11] And so he consulted them. Uh we need to
[1:13:14] bring the ark back. Absolutely.
[1:13:18] Now, you know, we used to carry it on
[1:13:20] the priest's shoulders, but you know,
[1:13:23] we've gotten modern today. And we uh
[1:13:28] these priests, you know, they might
[1:13:30] stumble, they might fall, they might do
[1:13:32] there might be damage to the ark. We
[1:13:35] better make a new cart.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:38] We got a We got a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:13:40] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:13:41] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:13:41] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:13:41] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[1:13:41] a a a a a a a a a a a a more
[1:13:42] sophisticated way of bringing it home.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So, a new cart is
[1:13:49] made and they select the oxen and they
[1:13:53] start pulling it. I tell you what, it
[1:13:57] wasn't even a twinge in David's mind
[1:13:59] that anything was wrong. He got out in
[1:14:02] front of that ark. Was he enthused? He
[1:14:05] danced before God. This is the greatest
[1:14:08] thing that's happened in years. Oh, and
[1:14:12] they rejoiced and they shouted and they
[1:14:14] praised the God of Israel. They were
[1:14:16] praising the right person and doing the
[1:14:19] right thing the wrong way.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And so, was the worship acceptable?
[1:14:27] Unfortunately, not. And the Bible says,
[1:14:30] "And they carried the ark of God in a
[1:14:33] new cart of the house of Abinadab,
[1:14:37] and Yuza
[1:14:40] and
[1:14:42] Aile
[1:14:43] drove the cart."
[1:14:46] Prophet says, "And and David and all
[1:14:48] Israel played before God," the scripture
[1:14:50] says, "with all their might." I might
[1:14:54] add
[1:14:56] to this respectful audience this morning
[1:14:59] and all who are listening
[1:15:02] that they worship God with a force that
[1:15:05] you haven't experienced this morning.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I haven't seen anybody
[1:15:12] and I was watching the monitor in there
[1:15:15] and this is not to condemn because I'm
[1:15:17] part of this congregation. I've not yet
[1:15:20] worshiped this morning with all my
[1:15:22] might.
[1:15:24] Have you?
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; No. With all their might, they had
[1:15:30] nothing left. With all their might, they
[1:15:33] sang. They played. They rejoiced. They
[1:15:35] worshiped. Oh, what a time. I tell you
[1:15:38] what. And they weren't. It wasn't
[1:15:40] anybody say, "Raise your hand." Now,
[1:15:41] everybody raise their hand. Say, "Praise
[1:15:43] the Lord." Everybody said, "Praise the
[1:15:44] Lord." No. They were rejoicing out of
[1:15:46] the depths of their spirit. The word was
[1:15:49] coming back. The word was coming back in
[1:15:52] that little box carrying the covenant,
[1:15:55] the word of the covenant, the ark of the
[1:15:57] covenant. Oh, the word was coming back.
[1:15:59] They were so enthused, but they were
[1:16:01] also blinded by the fact it was coming
[1:16:03] the wrong way.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And it brought death.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; It brought trouble.
[1:16:10] In fact is it brought David
[1:16:14] to a I would say a very dangerous place
[1:16:17] but it it needs to be in the word of God
[1:16:19] because we need these examples.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; He was he was angry with God.
[1:16:26] He could not understand why God slew
[1:16:31] this man when the man when the man and
[1:16:34] and the ark is coming back and it's
[1:16:36] coming back the wrong way. But the
[1:16:39] people are rejoicing. They're so
[1:16:40] enthused. They're just enthralled with
[1:16:43] this event and and uh uh you know
[1:16:46] something very natural happens. The
[1:16:48] auction stumbles a little bit and the
[1:16:50] ark starts to tip a wee bit and use he
[1:16:53] puts out his hand to steady it. He
[1:16:55] doesn't want it to fall to the ground.
[1:16:57] This is sacred. This is something
[1:16:58] wonderful. And God smites him dead.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; You know, it brought a halt to this
[1:17:07] joyous event.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And David was mystified.
[1:17:11] You know, things happen. Sometimes they
[1:17:14] happen, but you have to really ask
[1:17:15] yourself, why is it happening?
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Why is it happening? And we need to go
[1:17:20] back and be certain of God. We need to
[1:17:22] go back and turn over every stone. And
[1:17:24] had David gone back to the word, he
[1:17:27] could have said, "Aha,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; this thing is supposed to come back on
[1:17:31] the shoulders of the priest. It's not
[1:17:33] supposed to come back in a new cart.
[1:17:35] It's not supposed to be pulled by some
[1:17:37] by some oxen. It's supposed to come back
[1:17:40] on the shoulders of the appointed ones
[1:17:42] of God. We've got to get back to the
[1:17:45] word." In other words, it was the word
[1:17:47] that would dictate proper worship.
[1:17:53] Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; In trying to do God a service, I just
[1:18:02] want to insert these things so you'll
[1:18:05] have it reconfirmed
[1:18:07] from brother Brandham's mouth. And
[1:18:09] another thing, David here, we see that
[1:18:12] in his heart he wanted to do something
[1:18:15] that was good.
[1:18:18] He had no bad motive
[1:18:22] or no bad objective.
[1:18:25] His motive and his objective was
[1:18:28] correct.
[1:18:30] But the ark of the Lord was away from
[1:18:32] the people and he wanted to bring the
[1:18:35] ark of God back to its place so the
[1:18:38] people would consult God about the
[1:18:40] things that they wanted. And he said,
[1:18:42] "Notice, David got a revelation."
[1:18:46] And notice, it was not the prophet
[1:18:49] Nathan that got the revelation. It was
[1:18:52] David the king that got the revelation.
[1:18:56] Neither was Nathan consulted about it.
[1:18:59] He never asked Nathan. But did you see
[1:19:02] here in First Coronals, he consulted
[1:19:05] captains of thousands and captains of
[1:19:07] hundreds. And he never consulted Nathan.
[1:19:10] He consulted the people. And he
[1:19:12] consulted also the priests and the
[1:19:14] theologians of that day and the scribes
[1:19:17] and the theologians. Now in the
[1:19:20] congregation, I want to bring this down
[1:19:22] to today and I'm going to try to watch
[1:19:24] my time, but it's going to be a little
[1:19:25] bit difficult.
[1:19:28] Sometimes we
[1:19:30] get into some dilemmas.
[1:19:34] We find ourselves off into some
[1:19:38] uncomfortable place.
[1:19:41] And as a believer, I'm sure that you've
[1:19:43] asked,
[1:19:44] "Did I get here? Did, you know, did God
[1:19:47] lead me here? Or did my flesh lead me
[1:19:49] here? Or did somebody else lead me here?
[1:19:52] How did I get here? How did I get to
[1:19:54] where I am at this present state of this
[1:19:58] situation that I'm in? How did I get
[1:20:00] here?" and sometimes God allows things.
[1:20:03] You can live a life of Job and and live
[1:20:06] a correct life and have have some of
[1:20:10] Job's experience.
[1:20:12] You can be a devoted,
[1:20:15] devout believer. It doesn't mean that
[1:20:18] everything's going to go smooth. You may
[1:20:20] enter some very, very rough, trying
[1:20:23] waters.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that you need to
[1:20:27] condemn yourself. But I think it's
[1:20:30] always good for us to look and say, "How
[1:20:34] did I arrive here?" Because I find, and
[1:20:37] this is my experience, I find that
[1:20:39] believers sometimes
[1:20:41] get their advice from the wrong source.
[1:20:45] In fact, is I've had people come back to
[1:20:47] me not that I'm the right source, but
[1:20:49] they come back to me after the fact.
[1:20:53] after getting advice from this one and I
[1:20:56] phoned that one and I talked with this
[1:20:59] one and as a uh I finally made a
[1:21:02] decision or I was advised and
[1:21:04] counseledled to do a certain thing and
[1:21:06] they went ahead and did it and the whole
[1:21:07] thing blew up and then they want you
[1:21:10] know the pastor to make it all right.
[1:21:12] I'm sorry it doesn't work that way.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; It works by consulting the word of God
[1:21:18] first.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Should I do this first? Consulting
[1:21:24] God's word first.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And then some have come to me and they
[1:21:28] said now uh uh what does what does the
[1:21:31] word say about this? I said why don't
[1:21:32] you read it?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Why don't you listen to it?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Why don't you go to the source?
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And in fact is on occasion I've taken
[1:21:41] you know message books. I said here I
[1:21:44] found these for you. Here's I know I've
[1:21:46] marked them for you. Here's the places.
[1:21:48] Why don't you read it and you see what
[1:21:50] the prophet of God said and then you'll
[1:21:52] be able to once you're done come back
[1:21:54] and and we we can have another
[1:21:57] conversation. But sometime you know
[1:21:59] people want they want God to fix
[1:22:02] something after they have taken counsel
[1:22:06] from all different sources and have made
[1:22:10] decisions based on that counsel and then
[1:22:13] the whole thing blows up and they don't
[1:22:16] have a they don't have a a positive
[1:22:18] response and they want God to fix it.
[1:22:21] I'm sorry. You know, we still reap what
[1:22:23] we sow.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; And and God has not promised that when
[1:22:28] we start reaping a bad crop that
[1:22:31] suddenly he'll fix it. So there is no
[1:22:32] crop. You know, like brother Ernie says,
[1:22:35] we people sew their wild oats and then
[1:22:37] they pray for crop failure.
[1:22:40] That isn't the way it happens.
[1:22:43] So,
[1:22:44] and the fact someone says, "Well, I have
[1:22:46] a revelation or God, I I I I get real I
[1:22:51] get real cautious about that because
[1:22:54] really what I want to know is did they
[1:22:55] hear from God? Do they hear from God's
[1:22:58] word
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; on this subject?"
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; And and because that's where God will be
[1:23:03] honored with the life.
[1:23:06] All right.
[1:23:08] Now I'm going to just take for the next
[1:23:10] few moments so you see the direction I'm
[1:23:12] going. I want to just step from Eden to
[1:23:15] Abraham to the children of Israel on
[1:23:18] this subject of uh worship and idols and
[1:23:21] so on. I just want to touch on these and
[1:23:24] then come to the present time. Now in
[1:23:27] Eden, the first act, I touched on this
[1:23:30] the other night. In fact, as I actually
[1:23:32] focused on it, but the first act of
[1:23:34] deception, it Satan did not come through
[1:23:38] the serpent to Eve and say, "Fall down
[1:23:40] and worship me as Lucifer did to Jesus."
[1:23:43] But my point is this, that his
[1:23:45] intention, his desire was the same.
[1:23:49] And he used the tactic of diverting her
[1:23:52] attention from the word of God, the
[1:23:55] covenant of God to them, to Adam and
[1:23:58] Eve. And based on that covenant, he had
[1:24:01] fellowship with them. They had
[1:24:03] fellowship and communion with God. That
[1:24:06] is worship.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; He says uh and the first act of
[1:24:14] deception upon the earth was introduced
[1:24:16] by a question.
[1:24:19] And I mentioned to you that you that
[1:24:21] we're not here. A question really is
[1:24:24] philosophy. That's what philosophy is.
[1:24:26] It's a question upon question after
[1:24:29] question. I don't want to get into that
[1:24:31] now. But that he progressed from that
[1:24:34] question
[1:24:36] until he displaced her devotion to the
[1:24:41] simple word of God. Thou shalt not eat
[1:24:44] of it.
[1:24:46] And he
[1:24:48] notice now he displaced her from her
[1:24:52] fellowship with God,
[1:24:54] her place with her husband.
[1:24:58] The home was was uh
[1:25:03] the home was uh uh the headship was
[1:25:06] displaced and the home was dismembered
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; because now Eve had a different head.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:25:17] you say, "Brother Brandon uses the
[1:25:19] phrase all the time, just one word, just
[1:25:21] one word." Well, the word and God
[1:25:26] himself are synonymous.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Do you have an agreement on that? The
[1:25:31] word and God himself is synonymous. So
[1:25:34] now if we have, you know, the prophet
[1:25:36] can say, well, he he got her to
[1:25:38] disbelieve just one word. Well,
[1:25:41] actually, we can put it in this
[1:25:43] terminology without changing it at all.
[1:25:45] It's absolutely in harmony with the
[1:25:47] scripture. What Satan did through the
[1:25:50] serpent was he got her to move away from
[1:25:54] the person
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; of the word.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I told you how affected I was when I I
[1:26:03] found brother Brandham using in the last
[1:26:06] service of leadership
[1:26:10] he uses the phrase the person of eternal
[1:26:13] life.
[1:26:15] Now
[1:26:18] I have here I want you to think about
[1:26:21] this.
[1:26:23] You can do a little bit of mathematics.
[1:26:29] 1636
[1:26:31] times
[1:26:33] brother Brandham uses the phrase eternal
[1:26:36] life
[1:26:38] in his entire ministry that we have
[1:26:40] recorded. 1,636
[1:26:44] times he uses that phrase eternal life.
[1:26:48] And that can be in scripture reading.
[1:26:52] It can be in any
[1:26:54] in in any form. But he uses that phrase
[1:26:57] that many times.
[1:26:59] There is over,00 perhaps, 1125.
[1:27:04] I just divided it by,25
[1:27:08] and that comes out to about 1.4
[1:27:12] times per message. One and a half times
[1:27:15] per message. A little bit less than one
[1:27:17] and a half times. So then I just began
[1:27:20] to scan down the various messages
[1:27:23] because I already had been impressed I
[1:27:25] believe of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:29] on this on this message of leadership
[1:27:33] because it was the last message.
[1:27:37] And you know there's something to be
[1:27:39] said when you have the last piece of
[1:27:43] instruction. Now before you go or before
[1:27:46] I leave, I want to say this to you. I
[1:27:50] would think that that should be very
[1:27:51] significant.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; And I found some places one one here,
[1:27:58] then two times in that message,
[1:27:59] sometimes three here, then one over
[1:28:01] here.
[1:28:03] When I got to leadership,
[1:28:06] 32 times in one service,
[1:28:11] he speaks of leadership and he speaks of
[1:28:14] eternal life.
[1:28:16] 32 times. I I said I said to my wife, I
[1:28:20] want to ask you something.
[1:28:22] Brother Brandham used this term one
[1:28:24] time, one time, two times, one time, two
[1:28:27] times, three times, one time. And then
[1:28:30] suddenly at the very last time, he's
[1:28:34] leaving the scene and he even says in
[1:28:37] there, "This may be my last message."
[1:28:42] And 32 times he speaks to a group of
[1:28:46] people, Christian businessmen, been
[1:28:49] saved,
[1:28:50] saved
[1:28:52] 10 years, 30 years, 40 years, saw early
[1:28:55] Pentecost,
[1:28:57] perhaps hundreds of them did. And he
[1:28:59] speaks to them, you must not reject
[1:29:02] eternal life.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; This young man rejected eternal life.
[1:29:08] This young man was offered eternal life
[1:29:11] and he keeps going through it. Is it
[1:29:14] significant?
[1:29:16] A profoundly significant.
[1:29:19] And I'll just interject for you.
[1:29:30] Here's some of the statements.
[1:29:33] But when he was confronted with the
[1:29:35] thought of eternal life,
[1:29:38] that's when he turned it down. The rich
[1:29:41] young ruler, he said, "I want you to
[1:29:43] notice with all this character that he
[1:29:47] had, yet he knew that he did not possess
[1:29:50] eternal life. He had all his character,
[1:29:53] but he did not possess eternal life."
[1:29:56] He said, "We each one are confronted
[1:30:00] with eternal life. We're not seeking to
[1:30:04] confront you with a church program this
[1:30:06] morning. We're not seeking to confront
[1:30:08] you with a certain style of of worship
[1:30:11] or a certain style of belief. I would
[1:30:14] pray that before every person this
[1:30:17] morning hearing my voice and in this
[1:30:20] sanctuary or throughout this building
[1:30:23] that we'd realize that the the word is
[1:30:26] synonymous with eternal life. It's not
[1:30:29] this life but it's eternal life. And
[1:30:32] he's talking about leadership.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; 32 times it it is in direct reference to
[1:30:40] eternal life. I thought of my own life.
[1:30:47] You perhaps
[1:30:49] I don't know exactly how you are right
[1:30:52] now but I said now I have a life.
[1:30:55] I have a life. I was speaking to my
[1:30:56] wife. I said I have a life in my body
[1:31:00] and it may suddenly just turn on me. I
[1:31:02] feel excellent but in a few moments I
[1:31:05] may not be well. That life is going to
[1:31:07] dictate to me what I do. that life is
[1:31:10] going to tell me I got to lay down.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I've got to rest. Or that life is going
[1:31:16] to tell me, it's going to dictate. Or I
[1:31:17] might feel exuberant. I might feel
[1:31:20] energy, full of energy. I'm going to do
[1:31:22] this today. Or that life may dictate to
[1:31:25] me uh uh what my activity is going to be
[1:31:28] because the life it dictates.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; It has a role of leadership in your
[1:31:34] life.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Now we have eternal life. And eternal
[1:31:38] life, you might as well say, is
[1:31:40] synonymous. Eternal life is Christ.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is the word.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And by having eternal life, that's the
[1:31:49] only way that we can actually worship
[1:31:51] God in spirit and in truth.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "When you come forth in the
[1:32:00] bedding ground of the mother," these are
[1:32:02] all just selected phrases. Then you
[1:32:05] become a human being and we are made in
[1:32:07] the image of your father. Now you can
[1:32:09] fellowship with him. You can fellowship
[1:32:11] with him. And the same thing by God. If
[1:32:15] you got eternal life,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; if you got eternal life, you came from
[1:32:20] the bedding grounds where God planted
[1:32:22] that seed and you got you came as a gene
[1:32:26] of your heavenly father.
[1:32:28] He says then the same thing that this
[1:32:30] boy was confronted with. He said, "I've
[1:32:32] observed these commandments. I've been
[1:32:36] taught since I was a youth." And Jesus
[1:32:40] loved him for it.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; So even if Christ loved him, it was
[1:32:46] still not sufficient. Even though he
[1:32:49] kept legally the word and he was taught
[1:32:53] from his childhood, he had been brought
[1:32:55] up and he followed it. But you see, it
[1:32:59] wasn't eternal life yet. It was just a
[1:33:02] creed. It was just something that he had
[1:33:04] learned to do.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; You know, young people, I was thinking
[1:33:08] of you last night because this was on my
[1:33:09] message. It takes more I'm speaking to
[1:33:12] you now. It takes more than your parents
[1:33:15] telling you how to live.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; It takes more than them telling this is
[1:33:19] wrong, honey, and this is right, and
[1:33:21] this is the way you should do it, and
[1:33:23] this is what you should not do, and I
[1:33:25] don't want you to do this, and I don't
[1:33:26] want you to do that, and I want you to
[1:33:28] do this. It takes more than that. It
[1:33:31] takes the person of the word to come in.
[1:33:34] You need to have a relationship with
[1:33:37] that person so that you know that now he
[1:33:40] is the one who's abiding in you. He's
[1:33:43] the one. Now you have a life in you
[1:33:45] dictating.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And will it dictate? Absolutely. Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; You'll get right to a place maybe just
[1:33:54] going to go in there
[1:33:56] or you might be with some friends, some
[1:33:58] peers, some of your schoolmates and you
[1:34:02] and and and suddenly you'll find that
[1:34:04] there's inside a witness. I can't go any
[1:34:07] further. That is the person of eternal
[1:34:12] life.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is not some cute phrase.
[1:34:16] Eternal life is a person. Eternal life
[1:34:19] has a voice. Eternal life has a desire.
[1:34:23] Eternal life has a purpose. Eternal life
[1:34:26] has a will because it's a person.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And that person of eternal life will
[1:34:37] direct and dictate
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; what you should do, what you shouldn't
[1:34:41] do, how far you can go, how far you
[1:34:43] can't go. And then
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; then you are worshiping.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; You may not even raise your hand.
[1:34:55] You may not clap.
[1:34:58] You may not be and demonstrative and use
[1:35:01] some exuberance.
[1:35:03] But there will be a true worship.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; And I would say that you cannot have
[1:35:08] that kind of a relationship. But what
[1:35:09] there is some emotional
[1:35:12] response
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; of reverence
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; to him.
[1:35:30] He said Jesus loved him but he refused
[1:35:34] to be guided.
[1:35:37] He refused to accept the real leadership
[1:35:40] of Jesus Christ to give him eternal
[1:35:44] life. He said the other leaders that he
[1:35:47] had in his youthful days had such an
[1:35:49] influence on him.
[1:35:52] the other leaders, the other people,
[1:35:54] others,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; the people that you work with or work
[1:36:02] for,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; the other young people that you
[1:36:06] associate with,
[1:36:11] your neighbors,
[1:36:14] the people that you have as friends,
[1:36:18] but are they going to stand and give an
[1:36:20] account for your life? No,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; you're going to give account for your
[1:36:24] own life
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; and God's going to ask you, "What did
[1:36:27] you do with that message that I had
[1:36:30] spoken?"
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Regarding myself,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; my own person, eternal life,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; what did you do with that? He had other
[1:36:39] leaders and they affected him. I see the
[1:36:42] young people get together and they're so
[1:36:44] influenced from one another. I should
[1:36:47] say to you, stop that. Yes,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; you should stop that. Become an
[1:36:52] individual with your walk with God.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; You can have your friends and you can
[1:36:57] have a nice time. And we as a uh you
[1:37:00] know adults on down the road, but we
[1:37:03] have to have we have to have lines of
[1:37:05] demarcation
[1:37:07] that we can go thus far no further.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Even with believers sometime I get with
[1:37:12] believers and then they start veering
[1:37:14] off into a conversation. It gets into an
[1:37:17] atmosphere. it gets into a it gets into
[1:37:19] a tenor. It gets into a kind of a a a a
[1:37:23] certain kind of a you know an angle and
[1:37:26] direction and things are being said and
[1:37:28] I don't have any more fellowship with
[1:37:30] it. I can't fellowship with that any
[1:37:32] longer and so I just withdraw within
[1:37:35] myself
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; and fall silent because there's some
[1:37:39] things you can't participate in.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Some conversation you can't participate
[1:37:46] in. There's nothing wrong with saying,
[1:37:49] you know, brother, you know, sister, the
[1:37:51] word actually says this.
[1:37:54] And I think I'd prefer not to engage in
[1:37:57] that conversation.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; The word says, "Whatsoever things are
[1:38:04] lovely,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; whatsoever things are of a good report,
[1:38:07] whatsoever things are true, there are
[1:38:10] things that are true, but they're not a
[1:38:11] good report. And whatsoever what what
[1:38:14] whatsoever things are lovely and pure
[1:38:16] and good and honest and of a good
[1:38:18] report, think on these things.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Our whole walk with God is based on our
[1:38:32] response to the word of God.
[1:38:39] He said his youthful days he was so
[1:38:41] influenced
[1:38:43] till he refused to accept God's provided
[1:38:46] way which was Jesus Christ the only one
[1:38:49] who holds eternal life.
[1:38:52] The only one that can give you
[1:38:56] he says the church can't give you
[1:38:58] eternal life. This church can't give you
[1:39:01] eternal life. No church can give you
[1:39:04] eternal life. But the person of Jesus
[1:39:06] Christ, he is eternal life. And Jesus
[1:39:09] Christ is not who the world says he is.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus Christ is not who the church
[1:39:15] system says he is. In fact, as I would
[1:39:18] like to say today, this is Christmas and
[1:39:21] I don't have a Christmas uh message as
[1:39:24] such and yet it's a very Christmas
[1:39:26] message because it's all about Christ
[1:39:28] who we are re remembering and recalling
[1:39:31] that he came even though he did not come
[1:39:33] at this time of the year. But I'd like
[1:39:35] to announce to you and all who will hear
[1:39:37] me.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Satan has succeeded in giving this
[1:39:43] generation
[1:39:45] multitudes of false gods.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And multitudes of false Jesuses.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; They have a concept of Jesus which
[1:39:54] cannot be found in the word of God. And
[1:39:57] with that concept in their mind, they're
[1:40:00] going to go to church. They're going to
[1:40:01] sing. They're going to raise their hand.
[1:40:02] They're going to cry. They're going to
[1:40:04] dedicate their lives and all the rest of
[1:40:06] it, but there will be no fellowship with
[1:40:08] God
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; because God can only fellowship on the
[1:40:12] basis of his word. You come this way and
[1:40:15] I can hear you.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; The church can't give you eternal life.
[1:40:30] Not your neighbor,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; not your pastor,
[1:40:35] not your priest,
[1:40:38] not your creed, only Jesus Christ
[1:40:40] himself,
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; can give you eternal life.
[1:40:45] The BM says every three years
[1:40:48] after a message has went forth sent from
[1:40:51] God, sent from God, they recognize
[1:40:56] this has been 20 years. It's talking
[1:40:59] about the message has been 20 years, no
[1:41:01] organization.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; It won't.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; That's a prophecy. You can do whatever
[1:41:06] you want to do. It won't. The message
[1:41:09] cannot be organized because the message
[1:41:12] is a person.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; It's Christ.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; The person. You can't organize him.
[1:41:21] Now it says the shuck has to pull away,
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; which they did, and give the wheat a
[1:41:28] chance to lay before the sun to ripen on
[1:41:32] the message. to ripen on the message,
[1:41:35] coming right back into the church again,
[1:41:38] forming the body of Jesus Christ just
[1:41:41] like the first original one that went
[1:41:44] into the ground. Forming the body of
[1:41:46] Jesus Christ just like the original one
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; that went into the ground. Now he said
[1:41:54] to see eternal life. Now he says you can
[1:41:58] see eternal life. In other words, this
[1:42:01] is what happened with the original
[1:42:04] wheat, Christ, and it's happening again.
[1:42:07] They pulled away from him there. They
[1:42:09] pulled away from him here.
[1:42:11] He spoke truth there. Spoke truth here.
[1:42:14] He confirmed his word there. He did the
[1:42:16] signs and the wonders there. Did it once
[1:42:18] again.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And the shot pulled away
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; and left the wheat.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He said it has to lay in the presence of
[1:42:27] the sun.
[1:42:33] Oh my.
[1:42:36] And he says, "Now to see eternal life."
[1:42:42] Now he says to refuse the person.
[1:42:45] I hope you're not getting too tired.
[1:42:48] Stay alert.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Got a little distance. I'm going to go
[1:42:51] as quickly as I can. To refuse the
[1:42:53] person that's doing the calling, Christ.
[1:42:57] No matter if you're Pentecostal,
[1:42:59] Methodist, Luther, or whatever you are,
[1:43:04] nothing against them. Not at all.
[1:43:06] Nothing against them. Not at all.
[1:43:10] But in this age now, you've got to
[1:43:12] accept like they did in that age, the
[1:43:16] person of Christ.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Which is the word.
[1:43:21] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:43:23] word was with God and the word was God
[1:43:25] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:43:27] among us the same yesterday, today and
[1:43:30] forever. Hebrews 13:8. You must accept
[1:43:35] the person of eternal life.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Just a just a few more. And today he
[1:43:44] said don't say I'm Pentecost. I belong
[1:43:47] to this. I belong to that. I'm going to
[1:43:49] say don't say
[1:43:52] I belong to Bible way.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; It's fine for you to say I go to their
[1:43:58] church I belong to that group of people
[1:44:02] but not in reference to eternal life.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is a different subject. You
[1:44:08] come here because you have eternal life.
[1:44:11] You don't come here to get eternal life.
[1:44:13] You come here because you have it. And
[1:44:16] those are members of the body of Christ.
[1:44:18] We come to fellowship together because
[1:44:20] we're members of one body and that body
[1:44:23] is the body of Jesus Christ who has
[1:44:26] eternal life and we have eternal life by
[1:44:28] him.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And so you grow a whole group of people,
[1:44:34] young married couples and all the rest
[1:44:36] of it that well it has been a tradition.
[1:44:39] We always go to church. This is where I
[1:44:41] was raised up. This is where my friends
[1:44:44] go or whatever we go here for whatever
[1:44:47] reason.
[1:44:52] You have to know why you come.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; We don't come because we're reared in
[1:44:59] the message as such. We don't come
[1:45:01] because we have a longstanding tradition
[1:45:04] of coming. We must come because we know
[1:45:07] the person of eternal life and we are
[1:45:10] fellowshipping together with other like
[1:45:12] members of like precious faith.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; These people were absolutely bewildered.
[1:45:23] You listen to the tape, it's totally
[1:45:26] silent. They're bewildered that this man
[1:45:29] of God that many of them regarded as a
[1:45:32] prophet is preaching this kind of
[1:45:34] message to them. They're absolutely
[1:45:37] dumbfounded.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; We've been born again for so many years.
[1:45:42] We've been full of the Holy Ghost. We've
[1:45:45] had evidences of speaking in tongues.
[1:45:47] We've been so anointed of God. He's not
[1:45:50] denying that.
[1:45:53] But he's telling them that the fullness
[1:45:56] of him who is the fullness of Godhead
[1:45:59] bodily Christ is present in his word and
[1:46:03] they're turning it down.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; And surprising what little things they
[1:46:11] turned it down on.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the big things, but it was the
[1:46:15] little things he was trying to get them
[1:46:16] to acknowledge and accept the little
[1:46:19] things.
[1:46:24] Just little things.
[1:46:27] How we treat one another,
[1:46:30] how we speak,
[1:46:33] how we within our families relate, have
[1:46:36] relationship.
[1:46:43] Everything that the word of God gives us
[1:46:46] counsel in is not given. It's not given
[1:46:50] to us folks so that we can say well
[1:46:52] that's nice. It's not what God is saying
[1:46:56] to you. This is the basic of worship.
[1:47:00] This is the basis upon which you
[1:47:02] approach me.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; This is the basis.
[1:47:11] One thing that we all have this morning,
[1:47:17] we have it as an individual unit. Now,
[1:47:20] I'm getting on perhaps dangerous ground
[1:47:22] now, but just
[1:47:25] hold your peace. We all have a mind.
[1:47:29] We have our own individual mind. We have
[1:47:32] some gray matter
[1:47:35] and we receive things and we digest it.
[1:47:40] We can adjust it quickly. We can do
[1:47:43] different things with it. We can
[1:47:44] manipulate it. We can make decisions
[1:47:48] based on it.
[1:47:51] We can allow it to affect us or allow it
[1:47:54] or decide that no, it's not going to
[1:47:55] affect us. Or we can say that is that's
[1:47:58] marvelous. And we say, well, I don't
[1:48:00] know what he's getting at.
[1:48:02] Our own individual mind will take
[1:48:06] handle.
[1:48:08] And with some maybe the mind has become
[1:48:10] closed off. With some maybe we become
[1:48:12] completely distracted with something
[1:48:15] else that's taking place. But others
[1:48:17] they might be riveted.
[1:48:23] This is incredible.
[1:48:26] Brother Bram's talking to us about
[1:48:28] idolatry.
[1:48:30] Talking to us about having no other
[1:48:31] gods.
[1:48:33] It's not strange, friends. That's what
[1:48:36] God preached to his people
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; and that's what the others and you know
[1:48:41] what I have so much to say.
[1:48:46] But I'm going to tell you that your mind
[1:48:49] can quickly take and adjust things
[1:48:52] and and and let me just say per chance
[1:48:56] that what I'm saying is absolute truth.
[1:48:59] Per chance is absolute truth. And then
[1:49:01] through the mind you can take and adjust
[1:49:03] things and work it off.
[1:49:07] You can you know have a gravitational
[1:49:10] pull elsewhere
[1:49:12] and you come up with a different
[1:49:14] conclusion
[1:49:16] and you lift it up and say well I
[1:49:20] haven't really read the message. I don't
[1:49:21] really know what though those quotes I
[1:49:23] don't much about. I haven't I haven't
[1:49:24] heard a tape for months or years or
[1:49:26] whatever more. I haven't had much, you
[1:49:28] know, I I really don't know about it,
[1:49:29] but you know, I I do have another idea
[1:49:31] and I get and and and Satan will
[1:49:33] encourage, he will anoint that and just
[1:49:35] anoint that reasoning
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; and it'll go over off here
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; and you'll look at it, you say, I think
[1:49:43] that looks good. That's really what I I
[1:49:46] think I'll stand with that.
[1:49:49] You now have another God.
[1:49:54] You now have another God.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why if the church can
[1:50:02] persuade you that something
[1:50:05] is right outside of the word of God,
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; you'll have,
[1:50:11] you know, I was reading something about
[1:50:13] idolatry. This is going to shock you.
[1:50:16] I read a website yesterday
[1:50:21] and it has under the title of idolatry
[1:50:26] and idolatry is legalism
[1:50:29] and the legalism in that whole website
[1:50:32] the whole website was devoted over you
[1:50:35] are a legalist if you will not accept
[1:50:38] homosexuals
[1:50:40] lesbians and same-sex marriage.
[1:50:44] I wrote him an email.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I told him, "This is a despicable,
[1:50:48] disgraceful, and you have no place to
[1:50:51] make reference to the word of God."
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; It's not a minister, and it's not some
[1:50:56] legalist who have identified
[1:50:59] homosexuality.
[1:51:00] It is God who said it. And you can read
[1:51:03] it for yourself in the scriptures. And
[1:51:05] you have no right to call yourself a
[1:51:07] minister, call themselves a minister,
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; a doctor, if you would.
[1:51:15] not a doctor of divinity.
[1:51:18] As far as I'm concerned, it's a do
[1:51:19] doctrine of devils.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; But that's what's being promoted to the
[1:51:24] people. And multitudes of people are
[1:51:27] being swayed away from the word of God
[1:51:29] and clearly a clear-cut answer out of
[1:51:32] the word of God. And now what do they
[1:51:34] have? They have an idolatry.
[1:51:38] Sir,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; God after he brought it out from Eden,
[1:51:43] what took place with Eve, then Abraham,
[1:51:49] he, the prophet said, and I referred to
[1:51:51] it, his daddy was an idol worshipper.
[1:51:54] That's how he was raised. And he knew
[1:51:57] that that needed to be connected with a
[1:52:00] covenant. And so soon as he comes out,
[1:52:02] God let him out. Come away from your
[1:52:04] kindred. And so when he comes out, God
[1:52:06] speaks to him, says, "I'm going to give
[1:52:08] you this land and to your seed." And
[1:52:11] right away he builds an altar because he
[1:52:14] knows that an altar and worship is
[1:52:16] associated with a covenant. It's based
[1:52:20] upon a promise, a word. And that's how
[1:52:23] communion takes place. And that's really
[1:52:25] what worship's all about.
[1:52:29] See, when you stand here, you raise your
[1:52:31] hands and you worship and you praise God
[1:52:33] or you sing or whatever you do or you
[1:52:36] give him thanks, whatever that needs to
[1:52:38] have a basis.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Needs to have a foundation. And the
[1:52:42] foundation must be I do this based upon
[1:52:45] the word of God. And furthermore, that
[1:52:48] you know something about the word of
[1:52:50] God. It's not based on I feel good. I
[1:52:52] feel excited. The preacher said
[1:52:54] something nice. Oh, isn't that fun? And
[1:52:56] we may have it associated with, you
[1:52:58] know, something that's humorous and oh,
[1:53:00] oh, that's not what it's based on. It's
[1:53:02] based on truth. It's based on the word
[1:53:05] of God. And when you have it based on
[1:53:07] the word of God, then you can have
[1:53:09] communion. And communion uh flows right
[1:53:12] into fellowship
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; and into worship
[1:53:19] right after
[1:53:21] Abraham.
[1:53:23] Then God, are you with me? Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Then God speaks to Isaac and this is the
[1:53:28] first time he didn't say, "I'm the God
[1:53:30] of Noah. I'm the God of Adam or I'm the
[1:53:34] God of Enoch." But now he comes and says
[1:53:37] to Isaac the son, "I'm the God of your
[1:53:40] father Abraham."
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, I am who your father
[1:53:46] worshiped. I am the object of his focus,
[1:53:49] his attention. I am the one who had
[1:53:52] communion with your father. your father
[1:53:55] and I fellowship together. I am his God
[1:53:58] and I'm going to renew this promise to
[1:54:00] you." And then we go on to Jacob and
[1:54:03] come to Moses at the burning bush. And
[1:54:05] now he's astounded at this burning bush
[1:54:08] and he's attracted to it and a voice
[1:54:11] speaks.
[1:54:13] I am God, the God of Abraham, the God of
[1:54:17] Isaac, and the God of Jacob. and I'm
[1:54:20] sending you to deliver these people. He
[1:54:24] identifies himself as the God of these
[1:54:27] people. Now, I bring you quickly to
[1:54:29] where we started this morning. Just bear
[1:54:31] with me, please, for a little bit.
[1:54:34] Quickly, and they come they come out
[1:54:36] with this mighty hand, come into the
[1:54:38] wilderness and are are suddenly faced
[1:54:41] with the covenant of God from Mount Si.
[1:54:44] And what God was doing from Mount Si,
[1:54:47] friends, if you hear me now, what he was
[1:54:50] doing from Mount Si, he was joining
[1:54:52] himself, making the people a covenant
[1:54:55] people. Now they are a covenant people.
[1:54:59] You're not just a people that's come out
[1:55:01] under miracles and signs and wonders and
[1:55:04] plagues, but now I'm binding you to
[1:55:06] myself by a covenant. Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; And he he starts that covenant with thou
[1:55:13] shalt not have any other gods before me.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; And you'll not make any graven image of
[1:55:19] anything of likeness in heaven and earth
[1:55:21] and all the rest of it and under the sea
[1:55:23] and so on. And immediately and make a
[1:55:27] calf. Now
[1:55:30] that calf
[1:55:32] was a plague to those people
[1:55:36] and that thing God warned them when you
[1:55:40] come into the land of the Hittites and
[1:55:43] the Jebusites and the Gurgosites and all
[1:55:45] the others, you shall not fall down
[1:55:49] before their gods.
[1:55:51] You shall not worship their gods. That
[1:55:54] was his instruction. But as they got on,
[1:55:58] the children of Israel, you know, you
[1:56:00] remember the brass serpent, the brass
[1:56:02] serpent when they when they complained
[1:56:05] and murmured and the little snakes came
[1:56:08] out and bit them and they died by the
[1:56:11] thousands and they cried out of Moses
[1:56:13] and Moses made the brass serpent which
[1:56:16] the medical staff still the medical
[1:56:18] world still uses a college of physicians
[1:56:21] and surgeons. That's their emblem. the
[1:56:23] snake on the cross on the pole and they
[1:56:27] said that you have to just look at that
[1:56:29] and you'll live
[1:56:31] ordained by God designed by his prophet
[1:56:35] and put there for the people to look at.
[1:56:37] And later on they took that they took
[1:56:40] that brass serpent and or one like it
[1:56:44] whatever but they made an idol out of it
[1:56:48] and one of their
[1:56:51] prophets had to destroy the thing.
[1:56:54] Destroy it because it he said they made
[1:56:57] an idol out of something that had been
[1:56:59] good.
[1:57:00] And we also find that Jerobom
[1:57:05] you know now they came to another place
[1:57:08] uh and Jerobom was not once again
[1:57:12] leadership he was not called to be the
[1:57:15] leader
[1:57:16] it's Riabom that was the son of Solomon
[1:57:20] but Jerobom was of a servant
[1:57:24] but he took over 10 of the kingdoms but
[1:57:27] he was afraid that if the people went
[1:57:31] down to Jerusalem to worship as they're
[1:57:34] supposed to do, their hearts would be
[1:57:36] joined to Riaboam. And so we must we
[1:57:40] must uh be diplomatic in this thing. So
[1:57:43] I'll we'll make a golden calf for Bethl
[1:57:47] and we'll make one down in Dan so that
[1:57:50] it will be geographically located so the
[1:57:53] people won't be displaced. We'll make it
[1:57:55] much easier for them to come to church
[1:57:57] and worship. the mothers with the babies
[1:57:59] won't have to travel so far and all of
[1:58:02] this in this business of going down to
[1:58:04] Jerusalem's old-fashioned anymore and we
[1:58:06] don't have to do we've got a more modern
[1:58:08] way we've got a more easy way and we'll
[1:58:11] make it more less cumbersome on the
[1:58:13] people and that thing is called in the
[1:58:16] scriptures the sins of Gerobam and it
[1:58:20] happened to last it was steady for 263
[1:58:25] years
[1:58:29] and this king raised up and the Bible
[1:58:31] says and he did evil in the sight of the
[1:58:33] Lord for he did not put away the sins of
[1:58:36] Jeroboam. And it was a strange thing.
[1:58:38] They would destroy the groves and
[1:58:40] destroy all kinds of other false uh
[1:58:43] types of worship. They'd get rid of a
[1:58:45] lot of it, but they never got rid of
[1:58:46] some. And it was always the sins of
[1:58:49] Jeroboam that were always there. And you
[1:58:51] know in the message today, one of the
[1:58:53] things that has played the message is
[1:58:55] the idolatrous gods that people have
[1:58:58] packed in from their other
[1:58:59] denominations.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Well, this is and I find out something
[1:59:04] else.
[1:59:06] I'm going to unload. Good.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; I have found
[1:59:12] I have found amongst believers at large,
[1:59:16] you understand this will go beyond this
[1:59:18] church, but I have found
[1:59:22] you know people get shocked and
[1:59:24] surprised.
[1:59:26] They see maybe a certain man or a woman
[1:59:29] or an individual or whatever more and
[1:59:32] they so fervently served God
[1:59:36] in the realm of the message for so many
[1:59:38] years,
[1:59:41] years and years, 10 years, 15 years,
[1:59:45] even more. And then just like a bolt of
[1:59:49] lightning out of somewhere
[1:59:52] and they're gone.
[1:59:54] Absolutely gone. It was like there was
[1:59:56] no foundation, there was no roots, there
[1:59:59] was no nothing. And they don't only turn
[2:00:02] away or turn aside from become an enemy
[2:00:04] of the message.
[2:00:06] And I know it troubles people because
[2:00:08] they say, "Well,
[2:00:12] we washed feet together. We had
[2:00:14] communion together. Were they ever born
[2:00:17] again?"
[2:00:19] Well, that's not for me to say.
[2:00:23] If they were born again, they're going
[2:00:25] to come back.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; They're going to repent.
[2:00:29] But if they don't, then they never were
[2:00:31] born again.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Well, then on what basis? I mean, I even
[2:00:36] marveled at the peace they had. I
[2:00:38] marveled how they rejoiced. I marveled.
[2:00:41] I remember time and tears streamed down
[2:00:44] the face and and the hands were raised.
[2:00:47] I remember that there was such an
[2:00:48] expression of David in front of the ark.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:00:53] Cain at his altar.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; But I went to Glor. By the way, I I went
[2:01:02] to this church or that church. I was
[2:01:04] right amongst the believers and and
[2:01:06] that's when all of this took place.
[2:01:08] That's when all of this happened. I'll
[2:01:09] tell you what happens in the message.
[2:01:14] There are elements within the message.
[2:01:18] There are ingredients, components within
[2:01:21] the message
[2:01:25] that men and women and families
[2:01:29] actually believed in previous years.
[2:01:33] Maybe
[2:01:35] maybe the church they were serving in
[2:01:38] didn't uphold that, but they held it in
[2:01:40] their heart. Example,
[2:01:43] and I' I've been very very cautious
[2:01:45] about this. I've I've talked to men
[2:01:49] men now just coming into the message and
[2:01:52] the thing they got off on they got off
[2:01:54] on a theme in the message they saw it
[2:01:57] how brother Brand talked about the women
[2:01:59] and how they ought to be in subjection
[2:02:00] and that see that thing was in them all
[2:02:02] the time just they they ought to be down
[2:02:05] I've always believed that that wife
[2:02:07] ought to serve and she ought to be at
[2:02:08] home that's the right place for her and
[2:02:10] for a bunch of it I can say amen amen
[2:02:11] amen but why is he saying it
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; why is He's saying it. And you know
[2:02:18] what? I've never heard I've never heard
[2:02:21] any church preach this. I'm glad that
[2:02:23] somebody has got the gumption to stand
[2:02:25] up and put those women where they
[2:02:27] belong.
[2:02:31] And oh, they sit amongst the people and
[2:02:33] they rejoice and raise their hands and
[2:02:35] all the rest of it. They look like the
[2:02:36] most wonderful believers, but at some
[2:02:38] point in time, zingo, they're gone.
[2:02:41] Because that's not what the message is
[2:02:42] all about. The message, the message
[2:02:45] although it has these ingredients, it
[2:02:47] isn't because it suddenly find you find
[2:02:50] an element in there that agrees with
[2:02:52] something you always believe. That's not
[2:02:54] what the message is.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Come in. Oh, the oneness of the godhead.
[2:03:04] This this uh uh wicked trinitarian
[2:03:07] doctrine. I always knew it was false.
[2:03:09] Haha. Who can believe in three gods?
[2:03:12] Finally, we find somebody that's got
[2:03:13] enough stamina and then enough uh enough
[2:03:17] spiritual fortitude to stand up and
[2:03:19] preach the truth against this trinity
[2:03:21] doctrine. Just watch that person.
[2:03:26] One day on down the road, they're going
[2:03:27] to go zingle
[2:03:29] because that's not what the message is
[2:03:30] all about.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; The message didn't come to find some
[2:03:35] spot in you that you agree with.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. The message is the person
[2:03:40] of Jesus Christ. He's Lord of all.
[2:03:44] Whether you agree with him or don't
[2:03:46] agree with him, he's right.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's right.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; He's king. The word's king.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Not whether we agree with it, not
[2:03:57] whether it rubs us the right way or the
[2:03:59] wrong way. The word is right. And the
[2:04:02] fullness of the word has come in this
[2:04:04] day. And that is why we're also
[2:04:07] susceptible.
[2:04:10] We're susceptible until it comes. We're
[2:04:13] not susceptible to uh Satan taking a
[2:04:16] hold of our our reasoning and then we
[2:04:19] start we start vacasillating or we start
[2:04:21] gyrating.
[2:04:25] The Bible speaks of uh
[2:04:31] how Satan is a creature of beauty.
[2:04:35] And brother Brandham, I haven't got
[2:04:37] enough time today or this week.
[2:04:42] He said that
[2:04:44] the goddess
[2:04:47] of America
[2:04:49] will be the beauty of women.
[2:04:52] She will be a goddess.
[2:04:58] That's not because of what you see. Say,
[2:05:00] "Well, I see that on the street." Has
[2:05:01] nothing to do whether you see it or
[2:05:02] don't see it. That's what he said.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But I can see where Satan has come with
[2:05:13] just every possible enchanting
[2:05:17] possibility to augment that beauty
[2:05:22] to cause not man but a whole nation to
[2:05:27] be corrupted.
[2:05:32] And so he's provided every possible
[2:05:34] means,
[2:05:38] can change your physical features,
[2:05:43] can enhance
[2:05:45] your body,
[2:05:48] can add
[2:05:51] the necessary color,
[2:05:54] can add whatever whatever. Brother
[2:05:58] Brandham was asked about can a woman
[2:06:01] color her hair and all kinds. He says I
[2:06:03] haven't got a scripture for it. The
[2:06:05] thing is
[2:06:07] it is what does a person do it for?
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; What is the objective?
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Why do we wear what we wear?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:06:24] So we we we see that the
[2:06:28] the word itself is may be very very
[2:06:30] clear.
[2:06:35] I think that if uh
[2:06:38] now a woman brother I'm not talking
[2:06:41] about you sisters
[2:06:44] but when I speak to a congregation like
[2:06:46] this
[2:06:47] there are sisters who are sisters
[2:06:49] indeed.
[2:06:51] There are others perhaps who have not
[2:06:52] come to know this God of this word. I'm
[2:06:55] talking about this person
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. It has nothing to do
[2:06:59] with who you're sitting with this
[2:07:01] morning and oh you know this is the area
[2:07:04] my friends these are this is where I
[2:07:05] come to church. Has nothing to do with
[2:07:07] that. Has nothing to do with Bible way.
[2:07:08] I'm talking about the person of Jesus
[2:07:09] Christ.
[2:07:12] And so
[2:07:16] actually the message has very very
[2:07:18] clearcut very clearcut
[2:07:25] statements
[2:07:27] concerning our life, concerning our
[2:07:29] conduct.
[2:07:31] And and because he talked a great deal
[2:07:35] about the women and listen not in a
[2:07:39] derogatory way said your body was
[2:07:43] created and given you by God to bring
[2:07:47] forth life.
[2:07:49] And the graces which you have been given
[2:07:52] to feed a child, to bear a child, are
[2:07:57] not to be thrown to the world before the
[2:08:00] eyes of lustful men. Now if you in honor
[2:08:06] before God
[2:08:08] in honor of God conduct yourself in such
[2:08:11] a way so that before God you're doing
[2:08:16] what the word has said you're free. But
[2:08:20] on the other hand, if you go and prim
[2:08:23] and fancify yourself and fix yourself
[2:08:27] all up in a certain way that you know in
[2:08:29] your heart of hearts that this is going
[2:08:32] to attract
[2:08:33] men of the world
[2:08:37] and I see that they devise ways to show
[2:08:40] and accentuate
[2:08:43] that parts of a woman's body and expose
[2:08:46] it.
[2:08:50] You're quiet, but that's all right.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; And garments that will show
[2:08:58] they're underneath garments. Now, I'm
[2:09:01] sure if you had if you had the prophet
[2:09:03] of God standing here and you had a a
[2:09:05] question on that, you wouldn't even have
[2:09:07] the nerve to ask it. Do you know why?
[2:09:10] Because down in your heart, you already
[2:09:12] have a witness that that's wrong.
[2:09:19] And young men, the spirit that's in the
[2:09:22] world today
[2:09:24] is a spirit of perversion
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; to turn to index the thing around so
[2:09:30] that a man will lessen his place in the
[2:09:34] home. He doesn't take the
[2:09:36] responsibility. He becomes
[2:09:39] uh weak. He becomes wimpish, if I can
[2:09:43] put it that way. He he he he he becomes
[2:09:46] uh uh so that he hasn't got that manly
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; stamina,
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; that manly way about him. That's right.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; And and and I I want to say when that
[2:09:57] spirit comes, that thing needs to be
[2:10:01] rejected.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Immediately.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; And you don't fool around with that
[2:10:06] thing because we already have a clear
[2:10:08] word of God
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, you know, this is the
[2:10:13] way it is." and that's the way it is and
[2:10:15] whatever more.
[2:10:17] I talked to a young man
[2:10:20] in fact is I'll give you a testimony. I
[2:10:24] was standing in a fellowship hall of a
[2:10:26] church in this message in another city
[2:10:30] and there was just all kinds of I was a
[2:10:32] stranger. I knew some of the people, but
[2:10:36] they're just walking back and forth and
[2:10:37] I I was just standing there
[2:10:40] and a fine handsome young man, he just
[2:10:44] sailed past a whole group of people just
[2:10:45] sail past and the Holy Spirit spoke to
[2:10:47] me said he's a homosexual.
[2:10:52] So then I watched for him
[2:10:55] and there was a series of meetings
[2:10:57] taking place
[2:11:01] and after a given service I waited for a
[2:11:04] long time. It wasn't even in that series
[2:11:06] of meetings. I waited for a long time
[2:11:09] and the service was finished and God had
[2:11:13] spoke very very specific. I don't even
[2:11:16] know who preached, but that young man
[2:11:19] was left sitting in the pew.
[2:11:24] And I slipped in beside him
[2:11:27] and I put my arm around his shoulder
[2:11:30] and I said, "I first saw you in another
[2:11:34] city.
[2:11:36] I didn't even know who you were."
[2:11:39] I said, "As you walked by," I said, "God
[2:11:43] spoke to me
[2:11:45] and said, "You're a homosexual."
[2:11:50] His head went down between his legs.
[2:11:55] He cried out, "I hate it. I hate it. I
[2:11:59] hate it."
[2:12:03] I said, "I'll pray for you."
[2:12:09] He said, "What do I do?"
[2:12:12] I said, "Well, you can there are certain
[2:12:14] things you can do. One is I'd stop
[2:12:18] wearing this strong perfume."
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; All right,
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; that you can do. Stop wearing this. I
[2:12:25] don't mind you wear aftershore. It was a
[2:12:27] different purpose for him. You wear what
[2:12:30] you want. I don't have a scripture for
[2:12:32] it, but I was telling him what he need
[2:12:33] to do.
[2:12:36] Uh, what do you read for reading
[2:12:38] material?
[2:12:39] You can get rid of that. If you do what
[2:12:42] you will do and can do, God will deliver
[2:12:46] you.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; And that spirit's prevalent. And I say
[2:12:52] to the men, not only young men, but to
[2:12:55] the men of this congregation and all
[2:12:56] that hear me, that's a damnable spirit
[2:12:59] that's in the world.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And it comes in a lot of different ways.
[2:13:03] It's not only a a a a sexual thing, but
[2:13:08] it makes men so they don't take their
[2:13:10] place, don't take their spiritual place
[2:13:13] in the home. And we need men that take a
[2:13:16] spiritual headship before God and that
[2:13:19] can say follow me
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; as I follow Christ.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; And I say to the wives, if your husband
[2:13:27] isn't following Christ, this word, the
[2:13:30] person of Jesus Christ, you may have to
[2:13:32] make your own way.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And perhaps a lot of husbands here won't
[2:13:36] understand that. Husbands get they get
[2:13:39] uh uh they get very insecure and they
[2:13:42] tell their wives, "Don't you dare speak
[2:13:44] to the pastor." I say to that man or
[2:13:47] that husband, you make sure then she
[2:13:49] doesn't need to speak to me.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; I don't want her to speak to me. I don't
[2:13:54] I don't have the time to speak to an
[2:13:56] unnecessary thing. When you hear clearly
[2:13:59] what the word of God is, then I say, "Do
[2:14:01] it in the name of Jesus Christ. Do it."
[2:14:05] and the rest it won't be necessary. Live
[2:14:08] the standard
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; before the church, before your family,
[2:14:12] before God, before the brothers. Can the
[2:14:15] church say amen to this?
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; I want to close. I've been far too long
[2:14:30] and I've been about four or five
[2:14:31] services on this and I'm not I'm not
[2:14:34] even halfway
[2:14:36] here.
[2:14:38] But when when you have the least twinge,
[2:14:41] I don't care what it's concerning
[2:14:44] in regards to those things which have
[2:14:47] been reinstituted and have been
[2:14:50] established,
[2:14:51] confirmed and reconfirmed by a
[2:14:54] vindicated prophet and and and I will
[2:14:58] say this if he's coming to his last
[2:15:01] message and God is wanting to emphasize
[2:15:04] not 10fold, not 20fold, but over 30fold
[2:15:08] all
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; times. He wants to stress this is
[2:15:12] eternal life.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; This isn't what somebody thought. This
[2:15:15] isn't just, you know, and the men there
[2:15:17] were thinking, "Well, that's just
[2:15:18] Brother Brandon. He's got a wonderful
[2:15:19] gift." They had an idol.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; A mental idol
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; that had been constructed on what they
[2:15:28] thought he was. In fact, instead of what
[2:15:31] God made him out to be.
[2:15:35] Amen.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; You might have some question about that,
[2:15:42] but I want you to think very very
[2:15:43] deeply.
[2:15:46] And if a person realizes,
[2:15:50] you know, it isn't kind of what you
[2:15:52] think, what I think, what they think,
[2:15:53] what it's what the person of Jesus
[2:15:56] Christ has declared,
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; what the person has said. And if you
[2:16:01] follow him,
[2:16:04] this isn't this isn't friends something
[2:16:08] that's going to have us in good standing
[2:16:10] per time, but this is for eternity.
[2:16:13] We're talking about eternal life.
[2:16:15] Eternal life. I'm speaking to you this
[2:16:18] morning for eternal life.
[2:16:22] This man failed to follow eternal life.
[2:16:25] And incidentally, maybe you I know
[2:16:27] you've read the scripture. Listen as I
[2:16:29] close. Brother Brandham tra t t t t t t
[2:16:30] t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t
[2:16:31] t t t t t t t t t t t t t t this young
[2:16:31] man because Jesus tells several
[2:16:33] different parables and brother Brandham
[2:16:36] links them all together.
[2:16:38] He takes the young man that came
[2:16:42] running, the one we talk about most,
[2:16:45] falling down. What must I do to have
[2:16:47] eternal life?
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; God tells him what to do. All these have
[2:16:51] I done for my youth. If you be perfect,
[2:16:53] then sell all that you have, give it to
[2:16:55] the poor, and come and follow me. and he
[2:16:57] couldn't accept that.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus
[2:17:01] then brother Brandham ties him and takes
[2:17:03] him and said, "Let's follow this young
[2:17:05] man."
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; And he takes him to the next place where
[2:17:08] he's had such prosperity now because his
[2:17:11] father has led him into being such a
[2:17:14] successful businessman. He has had such
[2:17:17] pro prosperity. He's so recognized and
[2:17:20] he has a great feast
[2:17:26] and he has prosperity
[2:17:28] until he says, "What shall I do with all
[2:17:32] of this I've been so blessed with? I
[2:17:35] know what I'll do. I'll tear down my
[2:17:37] barns and I'll build greater." And
[2:17:41] little did he realize there'd be a God
[2:17:43] who say, "This night your soul will be
[2:17:46] required of you." And he also was the
[2:17:49] same one that had his great feast and
[2:17:52] walked out and Lazarus was laying at his
[2:17:55] gate.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham ties them all together.
[2:17:57] Said the same young man
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; as he moved through life
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; and now he's been so successful and
[2:18:04] there's a beggar outside and he comes
[2:18:06] and he and he and he he just gives him
[2:18:08] you know the pittance
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; and now this night le be required. And
[2:18:17] now he prays and cries out, cries out,
[2:18:20] "Let Lazarus come.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Let him come." And just with a drop of
[2:18:25] water on my tongue cuz he he says, "I'm
[2:18:28] in torment
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; in that place." My brother, my sister,
[2:18:32] that is why why did that even be written
[2:18:34] in the scripture so that we could avoid
[2:18:36] that kind of a place? We could avoid
[2:18:38] that kind of a man. And that is why the
[2:18:41] gospel is preached to us so straight, so
[2:18:44] forward. But this gospel is none other
[2:18:47] than the person of Jesus Christ. And
[2:18:50] that person is eternal life. And there
[2:18:53] is no life outside of him.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want this church to become a
[2:19:07] social place.
[2:19:14] You're free to come. It's a public place
[2:19:17] if I'm being honest with you.
[2:19:22] Sometimes people come
[2:19:26] because they something in their life has
[2:19:29] happened or something in their family or
[2:19:31] they get emotionally enthused about it
[2:19:33] says, "Well, I want to go, you know, I'm
[2:19:35] going to start. I'm going to start going
[2:19:36] to church. I'm going to be there. I'm
[2:19:38] happy they're here, but that's not the
[2:19:40] reason.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; The very thing that brought them here is
[2:19:43] the very thing will take them out.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; You understand? You understand? It's not
[2:19:48] it isn't doing anything. And if a person
[2:19:50] would be here in that state today, be it
[2:19:52] man, woman, child, whoever you are, you
[2:19:54] you need to say, why am I here?
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Why have I come?
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Why am I Why am I declaring this is my
[2:20:00] church home? And you want to be able to
[2:20:03] answer yourself and say, "I have a
[2:20:05] relationship."
[2:20:07] And that relationship with the person of
[2:20:09] eternal life is so real and so solid. It
[2:20:13] doesn't matter what happens to my
[2:20:14] friend, my family, my mother, my father,
[2:20:17] my children, my wife, my husband. I have
[2:20:20] a commitment to Jesus Christ.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; And it goes beyond all of this. I have a
[2:20:27] relationship with the person of Christ.
[2:20:30] And he is
[2:20:33] the word.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:20:44] how we're so dependent upon you.
[2:20:50] How man's words will fail.
[2:20:54] My words will fail. Your words shall
[2:20:58] never fail.
[2:21:00] And oh God, we have been confronted this
[2:21:02] this generation, these people. And I say
[2:21:06] of my own self, we have been confronted
[2:21:08] with the person of eternal life. And
[2:21:11] Lord, I want to testify. I want to say
[2:21:14] again, I want to confirm. I accept it. I
[2:21:17] receive you. I receive the word. And I
[2:21:20] pray that you'll show any area, Lord,
[2:21:22] where we find it difficult. and and and
[2:21:25] in following you, you have said to us,
[2:21:27] "Come and follow me. I'll make you
[2:21:30] fishers of men. You've called us like
[2:21:32] you've called a young man to come and
[2:21:35] follow you." May we not find anything,
[2:21:38] oh God, that would deter us, that would
[2:21:43] uh hinder us, that would stumble us or
[2:21:46] be an obstacle in our way, make us
[2:21:48] victorious. I pray over it, oh God. And
[2:21:51] I ask that you'll give us, Lord, you'll
[2:21:54] give us such a
[2:21:57] sensitive such a sensitivity to your
[2:22:01] word. Lord, may our may our mind be so
[2:22:04] conscious of your presence, what it is
[2:22:08] that you're seeking to do in our lives
[2:22:11] and in the congregation
[2:22:14] and in the body of Christ at large.
[2:22:16] Father, I ask you bless this people. How
[2:22:20] I thank you for them. How privileged I
[2:22:23] feel I am and that of my wife and
[2:22:27] family, oh God, that we can be here in
[2:22:30] fellowship and be in the land of the
[2:22:33] living and lift up our voices to you and
[2:22:36] give you praise. I thank you for their
[2:22:39] lives. I thank you for their testimony.
[2:22:41] I thank you for the great things that
[2:22:44] you have done on their behalf. But Lord,
[2:22:47] I pray that you will and we will
[2:22:51] continue to move move us, oh God, in a
[2:22:54] direction where your supernatural hand
[2:22:58] will be visible amongst us. And I pray,
[2:23:00] oh God, we will be a mighty witness for
[2:23:02] truth.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Don't let us diminish.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Don't let us, oh God, dilute
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; the the strength of the word of God. I
[2:23:11] pray that people here will speak it. Let
[2:23:14] them be anointed to speak it. Let them
[2:23:16] be anointed above that to live it. I
[2:23:18] pray, Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:23:20] Christ. And every hungry soul that is
[2:23:22] calling out to you now, I ask that
[2:23:25] you'll meet them for your glory. Jesus,
[2:23:29] we ask. Amen.
[2:23:32] Amen.
[2:23:35] on Tuesday.
[2:23:37] Uh I have to leave for Ghana
[2:23:40] and uh I just got the yesterday I
[2:23:43] believe it was uh I received the
[2:23:48] schedule of the meetings and I we might
[2:23:50] be able to lessen it a wee bit. I don't
[2:23:53] know.
[2:23:54] Uh there's a brother from New York that
[2:23:58] is also going
[2:24:01] and he's taking some of the services. I
[2:24:04] I don't know the brother. I haven't met
[2:24:06] him, but I did speak to him on the
[2:24:07] phone. Brother Tony's been to his church
[2:24:08] and speaks very highly of him.
[2:24:12] And uh there's going to be services are
[2:24:15] starting on Thursday, Thursday, Friday,
[2:24:18] Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Uh there's
[2:24:20] two services a day. And then uh on
[2:24:25] Sunday night they have arranged a radio
[2:24:27] broadcast
[2:24:29] and uh they want want me to be
[2:24:31] interviewed on national radio regarding
[2:24:34] the life and ministry of brother Branham
[2:24:36] and uh brother Tay apparently has
[2:24:38] arranged all of this and then then they
[2:24:40] have a radio broadcast.
[2:24:42] So the schedule is is really very heavy.
[2:24:46] So, I'm asking that you will pray and if
[2:24:49] you'll just hold me up in prayer that
[2:24:51] you know for each of these situations
[2:24:53] and each of these occasions that God
[2:24:55] will just give me wisdom and it's just
[2:24:57] almost like a U-turn. We just come back.
[2:24:59] We're back here for watch night service
[2:25:01] and uh and I'm sure that you will pray
[2:25:04] for me. I know that you will do that. Uh
[2:25:06] let's stand, shall we?
[2:25:11] Let's start again with that chorus.
[2:25:13] Linda, you're playing and I place you in
[2:25:16] the highest place.
[2:25:19] I place you
[2:25:23] in the highest place
[2:25:25] [Music]
[2:25:28] for you.
[2:25:32] I reach.
[2:25:36] We praise you.
[2:25:41] I
[2:25:42] [Music]
[2:25:49] all
[2:25:52] and we come to you
[2:25:57] worship
[2:26:04] as you give the highest place
[2:26:09] you
[2:26:16] for you.
[2:26:19] What great I
[2:26:28] am
[2:26:30] all
[2:26:33] [Music]
[2:26:39] and we come to you
[2:26:44] worship
[2:26:52] as we're going to say this maybe once or
[2:26:54] twice more.
[2:26:59] I would like you to
[2:27:03] within the deep
[2:27:06] depths of your heart and soul and mind.
[2:27:12] If you've had thoughts, maybe they're
[2:27:16] thoughts of condemnation.
[2:27:20] Maybe they're things that have attracted
[2:27:23] you or drawn you. Maybe you've whatever
[2:27:29] and Satan has tried to use them against
[2:27:32] you. I say lay them down.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Lay them down right now. If there be any
[2:27:38] question in your mind concerning the
[2:27:40] word of God, lay it down if you would
[2:27:43] just now and place him in the highest
[2:27:46] place. Don't have your own mind, your
[2:27:48] own thoughts. Friends, we don't have any
[2:27:50] we just don't have any thought that can
[2:27:53] is justifiable in the presence of God. I
[2:27:57] say it's his word and his word alone.
[2:28:00] His thought,
[2:28:02] he's not a God that doesn't speak. He's
[2:28:05] not some idol of wood or stone. He has
[2:28:07] spoken.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; He's revealed the secrets of their
[2:28:10] hearts.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; It's not a man who did that. It was God,
[2:28:14] the person of eternal life.
[2:28:18] He's the one that's delivered this word.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; The angel that has gone before us.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; We're not here where we are today
[2:28:28] because some man led us here. We're here
[2:28:30] because the angel of the Lord has gone
[2:28:33] before us and has brought us to this
[2:28:35] place and we respect him.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; The person of Jesus Christ. Oh, how we
[2:28:43] love him. Be adored. Be adored. Oh God,
[2:28:46] be exalted
[2:28:48] throughout this day. We place you in the
[2:28:51] highest place.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; We place you
[2:28:57] in the highest place
[2:29:02] for you.
[2:29:05] I pray I
[2:29:10] praise you.
[2:29:14] I love
[2:29:18] [Music]
[2:29:22] all
[2:29:26] and we come to you
[2:29:30] to worship
[2:29:32] [Applause]
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:39] our gracious and loving Lord Jesus
[2:29:43] Christ.
[2:29:44] The world is remembering
[2:29:48] a babe that was born,
[2:29:51] but we are remembering one who has come
[2:29:54] with a sign of a cloud and a voice.
[2:29:58] We're remembering one who has come and
[2:30:01] demonstrated himself with all wisdom,
[2:30:05] even revealing the depths and the
[2:30:07] secrets of the hearts of this entire
[2:30:10] generation. Oh God, we are giving honor
[2:30:14] and glory to that one, the angel of the
[2:30:17] Lord, none other than God himself. Oh,
[2:30:20] how we thank you. We have a genuine uh
[2:30:24] the only true and living God, Elohim,
[2:30:27] Jehovah, amongst us. Oh God, we give you
[2:30:30] praise. I ask that you will come in all
[2:30:34] of your magnificence to the individual
[2:30:36] life regardless of how young or youthful
[2:30:39] they might be or how old or elderly they
[2:30:42] might be. Come to them in whatever
[2:30:45] situation in life. Lord, I in the name
[2:30:48] of Jesus Christ come against the devil
[2:30:52] that has raised up such uh sometimes
[2:30:55] calamities, sometimes difficulties,
[2:30:58] reversals they've done. He's done all
[2:31:00] kinds of evil things to distract the
[2:31:02] people to get their minds off of the
[2:31:05] focal point, off of the important thing.
[2:31:07] I reject him, oh God. I deny him,
[2:31:10] Father, and I call on the forces of
[2:31:14] heaven, the angels of God, and the power
[2:31:17] of the Holy Spirit to move throughout
[2:31:19] this congregation and throughout the
[2:31:21] land, Lord, wherever the voice is. And
[2:31:23] may the people be set free, oh God, of
[2:31:27] these burdensome things, these
[2:31:29] cumbersome things, these things that
[2:31:31] have weighed them down and caused them
[2:31:33] to be weary, Lord, from whatever
[2:31:36] department or whatever area Satan has
[2:31:39] tried to creep in. I pray that you'll
[2:31:43] bring a stop to him, Lord. Bring a halt
[2:31:46] to him. And at this time of revalry when
[2:31:49] the world is going into their parties
[2:31:51] and their drinking and terrible life of
[2:31:54] disgrace to the nation, I pray, oh God,
[2:31:58] there'll be a holy nation.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; A group of people rise up that'll say,
[2:32:03] "Holiness unto the Lord, holiness unto
[2:32:05] the Lord.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; A people, Lord, that you'll look down
[2:32:08] upon and be blessed with their praises
[2:32:12] and their worship. and we worship you in
[2:32:15] spirit and in truth.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus Christ, dismiss us
[2:32:20] from this place, Lord, for some
[2:32:23] refreshment,
[2:32:25] oh God, and anoint your servant, I pray
[2:32:28] tonight, Lord, as we feed, we feed. This
[2:32:32] is the Lord's day
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; and we give it entirely to you in Jesus
[2:32:37] Christ's name. Amen. Hallelujah. I say
[2:32:42] to you, this day is a full day. This
[2:32:43] service has been a long service. But
[2:32:45] I've also been very conscious. This is
[2:32:48] the Lord's day.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; And we may get away say, well, we don't
[2:32:53] believe in the Sabbath anymore. We don't
[2:32:54] believe in that. That is true. Our
[2:32:56] Sabbath is Jesus Christ. But I still
[2:32:59] believe it's important to give him a
[2:33:01] day.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This isn't a shopping day.
[2:33:04] This isn't a Walmart day. This isn't a
[2:33:06] Hudson's Bay or some other day. This is
[2:33:09] the Lord's day.
[2:33:11] Hallelujah. We want to honor him. Set it
[2:33:14] aside. So, I've been in church 4 hours
[2:33:17] today. Whoa.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good thing you're not in
[2:33:23] brother docus church. It wouldn't even
[2:33:25] be through the song service yet.
[2:33:27] Hallelujah.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Let us not be a bunch of weak knees.
[2:33:31] American, Canadian, Western, whatever,
[2:33:33] whatever. Let us be solid, rugged
[2:33:35] Christians, for God. Hallelujah. God
[2:33:39] bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:33:41] name. Shake hands with one another and
[2:33:43] tell them you're happy you're a
[2:33:44] Christian. You're dismissed.
