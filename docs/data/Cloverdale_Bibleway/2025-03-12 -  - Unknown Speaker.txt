TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in calling Jesus on the scene you know how close is close to you brother BR said now he is a lot closer to you than he was then then he was in the boat at the H part of the boat you know how close he is to you let me read it to you he said if you got trouble tonight he is just at hand is just right at a hand he can be called on the sin by just move of your lips and sometime we forgot that in disciples time he still have to walk a few steps to come to the boat of the front of the boat and to set it be still but here he said he just one move of your lips why because he's laid inside of you and all you need to do by faith to believe him said Jesus come to rescue Lord I want that Revival to happen in my life I want that a burning desire to be met not just to keep on burning but to be met Lord I'm a walking towards you like that a prodical son I'm try to Lord I want you to walk in home no matter what is in front of me but I'm a walking to you because a Revival is not going on that doesn't mean he's gone he's right with us ready to be called at any time not hard to our R but will come to our rescue Jesus as aov in himself is right in our boat too in this age let's see how he proved himself he said here is something here's a little girl sitting here on the front seat of just a child as soon as I spoke her name she started crying she said the little girl is seeking for something real her sister is a whipping behind her he said I don't know the child I never seen her in my life I said know of but she's a seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is true is that right ELD girl that's right to raise up your little hand there you are she's not from here she's come from east of here she's a minister missionary's Daughter by the way her father is Desiring to see me it said it's the Father the Desiring to see me on a Christian he said I never see her in my life but that's exactly the truth don't fear honey you will receive the Holy Ghost he said your faith does it just believe he said remember she will receive the Holy Ghost she will receive it frankly is right by her right now what Christ has tried to do Jesus is in your boat if Jesus is that close to that little girl then the prophet said what's your desire he said I desire the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're Desiring for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's a still same yesterday today and forever and she said frankly is right by her right now and I'll say he right by you right now how to receive it by faith you receive it by faith you believe it she said that she's Supreme he said there's a lady sitting right here she's her praying for her husband also that's unsaved you believe was your heart is that you can receive what you ask for you're praying for your unsaved husband you're praying for unsaved wife you're praying for your unsaved children he that you can receive what you ask for what is Jesus try to do prove to you that he is right in your boat just by the move of your lips not me try to move your lips he tried to move your lips said Jesus you are in my boat that I believe what you have said and he said here a young woman sitting right back here in outside row she's got a female trouble you believe it was all your heart instead of you will be healed what Jesus tried to do not that the prophet tried to do but Christ tried to tell us he has been proved his in your boat when the prophet did all of that is to prove one thing he right in your boat the prophet coming is for you to let you look at it and to see through the prophet eye that's God's eye said I am in your boat it's so close to you just by the moving of your lips but you know what people fear it about the things that could rescue them but that's the thing that the people scared about we have to read through the true scripture this is the Jesus in the boat but on the other occasion Jesus walking to their boat and it was the disciples and when they're in the storm when they're roding their boat when they tried to get to their destination but it seemingly the destination become a farther and a farther away in a book of a John they said that they've been rowing the boat for almost an 8 hours and try to cross the lake that's only about 3 and a half a mile and because of the wind is are blowing the storm is just raising and they tried to use their own ability and they've been rowing they've been rowing they've been doing maybe the boat was a fi was in the water and the wind was the contrary and they try to blow them in under but then this time Jesus walk on the water Jesus walking for their rescue I was thinking why those disciples they don't remember this no matter Jesus is in the boat or Jesus walking through the boat Jesus still is the dynamic power and no matter how Wayward they might thinking no matter how that weak that the think no matter how the boat is seemingly to going to sink but that Dynamic power is walking to them the same Jesus can come to Sea the same Jesus can make their boat go to the destination they've be having a testimony but while they're having an testimon meeting on the sea the water start to come the wave is started to waving and I can imagine the bat is started to rocking and then the people they try to the disciple they do everything that they can but they find out their bat to start to just start to getting lower and the lower one of sinking into the water maybe they the bat to start to leaking the Water started to go in and then they try to use the bucket they try to use the thing to get the water out and I'll say sometime we're thinking our boat are leaking we're thinking our life started leaking we're thinking our pray life start to leaking we're thinking our family started leaking the world started sipping in the things started happening but don't worry the dynamic power still walking towards you and the Bible said he come onto them walking upon the sea Jesus walking on the same sea that they've been fighting with the wave was lifted it up they're fighting in with the wave but Jesus walking on that wave and Jesus walking to them if they see Jesus walking to them they should know no matter how big the waves are but the dynamic power is walking to me the wave might be high but Jesus walking on top of it the trial might be impossible to S but Jesus walking there why Jesus walking toward you Jesus walking toward of those the disciples and the scripture said and the would have passed by them Jesus looks like going to pass by them but Jesus will never pass by them he just look like he's passing by them when the disciples weing on the road and they M and there when Jesus was talking with them when they come into the as if Jesus want to go further want to go but he's just waiting for them to invite him to coming into the room and when Jesus walking on the water walking on the difficulty walking on the trial and walking on the Storm he's looking at he's passing you but he's not passing you he's only waiting for one thing come Jesus let a dynamic power coming in this sinking boat look like he's going to P them but it's only waiting for them to inviting him to come into the boat but you know what those disciples the things that come to rescue them but that's the the bo that's the thing they were afraid of but I'm so thankful there's one person though he was as afraid as he can be but this person also as bold as he can be and is name is a Peter when everybody else was feared about it Peter said to Lord if that's you let me do the same thing everybody said you are a spirit everybody said that's impossible but Lord if that's you let me walk onto you Lord I saw you walking toward me and I know you are that Dynamic power I know there's a re Revival possibility that in my life I saw you walking but I have been long lost that for so long I don't even know what Revival means I don't even know I don't even know what is the heart feeling religion really mean I've been hearing the mechanic I've been polishing the mechanic I don't even know what dyamic really is and everybody else said that's impossible for you to get but Peter said Lord I'm scared too but Lord though I'm scared but I saw you walking toward me I saw you walking toward me Lord if you have give me the message that shows that you walking toward me if you ever chosen me that shows you walking toward me if you ever elected me that shows you walking toward me Lord the storms are high though the waves are to high though the winds are blow but Lord if that's to you you chosen me if that's you elected in me if that you that healed me before if that's the you have saved me from The Trial now don't just let you come into to me but let me walk on the water let me walk to you when he started walking he was a stepping on the Storm he was over the trial it was a riding on the difficult it was a riding on the lukew but you know what when he keeps his eyes are looking he started thinking but he's a still believer and the Lord is the still Lord and that spirit that become so virtual so far away so intangible but that Spirit become a flesh and raise up a hand and pick up a Peter that his experience to be renewed now it's not him walking but Jesus walking with him is he in your trial in your storm it's seemingly every hope is gone but you make a move Lei prodical said I make a move I'm going to walking home I'm going to walking towards you that you walking even you fail but that spirit will not just a spirit anymore that spirit will become a physical will become a tangible will start ring his hand said to George I want to pick you up don't that out of condemnation condemn you anymore don't let an accusation the demon power try to overcome you now you walk with me let's walk back to that boat so that we can encourage other people that I'm not a spirit but I'm the same yesterday today and forever thinking about it that's the same Jesus Jus same Jesus still same robe still same physical but just because they walk on the water they never done before they afraid of him you maybe have some impossible situation you never walk home before it become a spirit but that's the same Jesus that's the same Jesus the people must say that's impossible for my situation but he's the same Jesus but this time he just walk on the things that had never done before but he's going to do that to you and they started walking on on the boat and he started walking with a Peter and Peter and Jesus they both walk under the boat and you know what when Jesus Come On A Boat Jesus never helped them to repair the boat Jesus never helped them to shuffle the water out Jesus never tried to solve the problem the Bible in the Book of John chapter 8 it said immediately immediately that boat landed on the shore immediately they've been rowing rowing rowing for Life you've been rowing rowing rowing for all the life trying to get to the destination but when a dynamic power came oh GL when a dynamic power came in your sinking in your leaking boat in your boat is going under in your boat that SS the tour but that Dynamic came that Dynamic came take that leaking boat onto the shore oh Hallelujah let that Dynamic of power come in this leaking boat he's not here to fix the problem he's not here to repair the boat he's to come here to take that boat to the shore you will always have a sticky nature as a leaking boat but ain't going to take a leaking boat to the shore you have your failure all your life but he taking that failure boat to the shore all you need to do invite the dynamic power though you look like a ghost but he is the Holy Spirit In the Flesh and I can lift it up of Peter they can lift it of you and then coming into your boat when it come into your boat he will lead you to the shore Hallelujah
