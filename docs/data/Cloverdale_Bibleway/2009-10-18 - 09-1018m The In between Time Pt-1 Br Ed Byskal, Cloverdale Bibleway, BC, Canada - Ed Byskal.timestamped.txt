[7:15] feet. Father,
[7:18] come and walk amongst us this morning.
[7:20] Lord, may the great dove of God be in
[7:23] attendance this morning. The covenant
[7:26] one Lord.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[7:32] Hallelujah.
[7:35] Hallelujah.
[7:36] [Music]
[7:37] Hallelujah.
[7:39] I love him. I love him because he first
[7:41] loved me.
[7:45] I
[7:48] love you.
[7:52] [Music]
[8:04] See,
[8:15] [Music]
[8:21] my
[8:29] [Music]
[8:36] [Music]
[8:39] tree.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just slip up your hand
[8:42] right where you're at? Just speak
[8:44] personally to him this morning. Oh, I
[8:50] love you. Just close your eyes now.
[8:58] [Music]
[9:05] He
[9:09] love
[9:11] me
[9:12] [Music]
[9:17] [Applause]
[9:23] I
[9:24] s
[9:31] [Music]
[9:37] [Music]
[9:43] I wonder if we could whisper that to him
[9:44] just one more time.
[9:47] Oh,
[9:48] I
[9:52] love you. It's all about you, Lord.
[9:57] I
[10:00] love him. We want to forget about
[10:03] ourselves now because
[10:08] he
[10:10] first
[10:12] love
[10:14] me
[10:20] and
[10:24] [Music]
[10:26] my
[10:28] Salvation
[10:35] [Music]
[10:46] dream.
[10:48] [Music]
[10:52] Hallelujah.
[10:55] Hallelujah. That salvation we've
[10:57] received freely this morning.
[11:01] Hallelujah. Not when we came to an altar
[11:04] and prayed,
[11:06] but the lamb that was slain before the
[11:09] foundation of the world.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:14] [Music]
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[11:19] Thank you, Lord.
[11:21] His saving grace has not lost its power.
[11:26] Amen.
[11:29] Got a testimony from
[11:33] Sister Lori. Brother John had prayed for
[11:35] a man that was in the hospital, the
[11:38] serious crisis in his health. And now
[11:41] the man is on his road to recovery.
[11:44] Sister Lori is just writing in. We want
[11:46] to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for his
[11:48] healing power. Amen.
[11:52] Why don't we just go to prayer at this
[11:53] time? I ask brother Darren Hoffman, why
[11:55] don't you come and open the service in a
[11:57] word of prayer.
[12:00] Amen. I trust you enjoyed reading the
[12:02] feast of the trumpets and the seals
[12:05] causes a little revival in your own
[12:07] soul. But what that does
[12:10] is that puts the vitamins inside you.
[12:13] Now that quickening power can come and
[12:16] strike it, cause it to be energized in
[12:18] your body. You may not have understood
[12:20] exactly what you read, but this morning
[12:22] the dissolver is here. He can take that
[12:25] word and distribute it to every portion
[12:26] of the body that has need of it. Amen.
[12:29] Why don't we just join in prayer
[12:31] together this morning? Ask the Lord to
[12:33] have his way in this service.
[12:35] [Music]
[12:39] Let's bow our heads.
[12:42] Heavenly Father, we are a thankful
[12:44] people this morning, Lord. For it's by
[12:47] your grace, Father, that we can stand
[12:49] here today knowing that we are
[12:51] bloodbought. We are washed by the
[12:54] precious blood of Jesus Christ. Nothing
[12:57] good of ourselves, dear God. We look to
[13:00] our own arm of flesh, dear God. We're
[13:02] nothing but failures, Lord. No good
[13:05] within us, Lord. But by your grace, one
[13:08] day, dear God, you came across our
[13:10] paths, Lord. And how we can look back,
[13:12] Lord Jesus, and know there's been a
[13:14] transformation in our lives. And what
[13:16] joy it brings within our souls, Lord. It
[13:19] gives us utterance, Father God, to
[13:21] praise you and to worship you, to exalt
[13:24] you, dear God, above everything else of
[13:26] this world, to exalt you above our own
[13:28] thoughts, our own ideas, Lord Jesus, our
[13:31] own reasonings, Lord. God, it just makes
[13:33] us want to cast down our burdens, cast
[13:35] down our cares, cast down our thinking,
[13:38] oh God, at your feet, Lord. Father, we
[13:40] could put on the mind of Christ, Lord
[13:42] Jesus. Lord, we want to be just like
[13:45] you, dear God. No, dear God, I know
[13:48] there's a song that says there's none
[13:50] like you, dear God. But Lord, I do know
[13:53] that there's a people, Lord, that are
[13:55] growing each and every day to be more
[13:57] like you. We're putting on our Eden
[13:59] beauty, Father. We're putting on Christ.
[14:02] We're putting on the word, dear God,
[14:03] that you've revealed to us in this day.
[14:06] And Lord, we're a blessed people. We're
[14:07] a privileged people, Lord. And we want
[14:10] to say thank you, dear God. Let not a
[14:12] day go by, dear Lord, in which we don't
[14:15] thank you, but let us open our mouths in
[14:17] praise and thanksgiving, Lord. Let it
[14:19] not become common to us this great
[14:21] salvation that you've brought in our
[14:23] lives. For truly you're worthy of it,
[14:26] for the lamb was worthy to take the book
[14:28] to loose the seals thereof to open up
[14:31] that book of redemption to us that we
[14:33] could see our names in it, dear God.
[14:35] that could re we could receive that
[14:36] revelation dear God that we are part of
[14:39] the bride of Jesus Christ that we have
[14:42] escaped from death hell and the grave
[14:44] that we can say oh death where is thy
[14:47] sting oh grave where's thy victory but
[14:50] Lord God you've given us resurrected
[14:52] life Lord Father nothing we could do
[14:54] Lord no man no prophet Lord but you
[14:58] yourself came down in this hour dear God
[15:00] to take the book Lord and Father we're
[15:03] praying that you'll take your word
[15:04] today, Father, that you'll break it to
[15:06] us. Lord, we come hungry tonight, Lord,
[15:09] this morning. We come thirsty, Lord. We
[15:11] come in anticipation, Father, for what
[15:14] you're going to speak to us today. Lord,
[15:16] we're thinking of our pastor, Lord, and
[15:19] how he so desires to find the mind of
[15:21] Christ, Lord. So desires to get himself
[15:24] out of the way, Lord. Father, may you
[15:27] come and set him aside, Lord. Set us
[15:29] aside, Father, and let the Holy Spirit
[15:32] move from heart to heart this morning,
[15:35] Lord. We're a desirous people to move,
[15:37] Lord Jesus, closer to you, to walk on
[15:40] farther, Lord, to make footprints, Lord,
[15:42] in our promised land. For footsteps
[15:45] means possession, Lord. We want to
[15:47] possess every promise, Lord, laying in
[15:49] the word for us, Father, to grab a hold
[15:52] of it, to embrace it, to not let it go,
[15:54] dear God, until Lord Jesus, you bring it
[15:57] to pass in our lives, Lord Jesus, we
[16:00] pray for your people this morning. Every
[16:02] need, Lord, every uplifted hand, Lord,
[16:04] every unspoken prayer request, every
[16:07] person needs a healing in their body
[16:09] needs healing within their soul needs
[16:11] that new birth. Father, Lord, come come
[16:13] down this morning, Lord Jesus. Move
[16:15] amongst us. Make yourself known in each
[16:18] of our lives, Father, to know you as
[16:20] life eternal, Lord. Lord, we don't want
[16:23] to know just a a like a a dead word,
[16:25] Lord. But we want a living Christ, a
[16:28] living word, not a dead letter, Father.
[16:30] A living word that's living out through
[16:32] these vessels, dear God.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we can walk humbly before
[16:36] you this day, Lord, knowing that it's a
[16:39] late hour, Father. and we need to do all
[16:40] that we can to lay aside, Lord, every
[16:44] hindrance, everything that would hinder
[16:47] our walk with you, Lord. So, Father, we
[16:49] open up our hearts to you this morning,
[16:53] Lord Jesus, praying that you will be
[16:55] welcomed in our midst as we wait upon
[16:57] you, Lord. We just ask your blessings
[17:00] upon each one, Lord. Remember those
[17:02] overseas, Brother Murphy, Brother Ivan,
[17:05] Lord, ministering in China. We think of
[17:07] the saints in the Philippines, Lord.
[17:10] God, how they're in such need of you,
[17:11] Lord. We just pray that you will meet
[17:13] every need they have, Father.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, bless your people. We pray, Lord,
[17:18] as we just wait in anticipation, Lord,
[17:20] in the edge of our seats, Lord,
[17:22] expecting you to do something in our
[17:24] lives this morning.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; We appreciate you, Father.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[17:31] Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Praise the Lord."
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[17:40] seats.
[17:42] Sister Jessica Caldwell, I believe. Is
[17:45] that right? Yeah. She's got a special
[17:47] for us. So maybe she can come and get
[17:49] ready. And right after she sings, the
[17:51] choir's going to come and sing for us. I
[17:55] have a couple of quick notes. We have a
[17:57] baptism right after the service. So that
[18:00] means the pool is open. Waters are
[18:04] ready. Amen. And we don't want to wait
[18:06] until after the service to let you know
[18:08] that you can be preparing all the way
[18:10] through the service. If you haven't made
[18:12] that step, that's a wonderful step to
[18:14] take. The Lord can come and do mighty
[18:16] things, but he first desires that we
[18:18] take that step. Amen. We've going to be
[18:21] going to two services starting next
[18:24] Sunday. So, if you missed that
[18:25] announcement, two services starting next
[18:27] Sunday and Sunday evening next week,
[18:30] we'll be having footwashing and
[18:32] communion here at the church.
[18:36] There will be a joint young people's
[18:38] meeting and young adults Friday the
[18:41] 23rd. So make sure that you're here for
[18:44] that. And one quick announcement from
[18:47] Bible way Christian Academy. Uh last
[18:49] year we had the J brothers. I believe it
[18:52] was here and we were able to enjoy their
[18:54] ministry and song and uh how the Lord
[18:57] has used them over the years and this
[18:59] year they've been able to uh work with
[19:01] the Cochman family. So, anyone that
[19:03] needs information on them, they're going
[19:04] to be here November the 7th. So, not a
[19:06] whole lot of notice. That's my fault. I
[19:08] didn't get the message out here to you
[19:10] uh when I had it probably three or four
[19:12] services ago, but there is information
[19:14] on the bulletin board outside of the
[19:16] school office and I I believe outside of
[19:18] the church office if you need to get
[19:20] that. Amen. You love the Lord this
[19:23] morning.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[19:29] [Music]
[19:45] All who sail the sea of faith
[19:50] find out before too long
[19:56] how quickly blue skies can grow dark and
[20:01] gentle winds grow strong.
[20:06] Suddenly fear is like white water
[20:10] pounding on the soul.
[20:13] Still we sail on knowing that our Lord
[20:17] is in control.
[20:20] Sometimes he calms the storm
[20:25] with a whispered peace be still.
[20:29] He can settle any sea but it doesn't
[20:32] mean he will. Sometimes he holds us
[20:37] close
[20:39] and lets the wind and waves grow wild.
[20:44] Sometimes he calms the storm and other
[20:49] times he calms his child.
[20:59] He has a reason for each trial that we
[21:04] pass through in life.
[21:09] And though we're shaken, we cannot be
[21:13] pulled apart from Christ.
[21:18] No matter how the driving rain beats
[21:21] down on those who hold to faith,
[21:25] a heart of trust will always be a quiet
[21:29] peaceful place.
[21:32] Sometimes he calms the storm
[21:37] with a whispered peace be still.
[21:40] He can settle any sea, but it doesn't
[21:44] mean he will. Sometimes he holds us
[21:49] close
[21:50] and lets the wind and waves go wild.
[21:54] [Music]
[21:54] [Applause]
[21:56] Sometimes he calms the storm and other
[22:01] times he calms his child.
[22:10] Sometimes he calms the storm
[22:14] with a whispered peace be still.
[22:18] He can settle any sea, but it doesn't
[22:21] mean he will. Sometimes he holds us
[22:26] close and lets the wind and waves go
[22:30] wild.
[22:33] Sometimes he calms the storm and other
[22:38] times he calms his child.
[22:42] [Music]
[22:47] Sometimes he calms the storm and other
[22:51] times he calms his child.
[22:59] [Music]
[23:08] [Applause]
[23:15] Amen. The choir's going to come and
[23:18] bless us with a song this morning. Maybe
[23:20] they could come and get ready. Uh there
[23:22] was one announcement that I neglected to
[23:24] uh mention to you, but it was brought
[23:27] back to my memory. There is a uh
[23:29] Thanksgiving
[23:31] family gettogether at Mount Baker Bible
[23:34] Way Camp this year. I believe Brother
[23:36] Ron and Sister Star Caldwell will be
[23:39] organizing that. So, accommodations are
[23:41] available and uh it's a potluck. Bring
[23:44] whatever you like. 1:00 on Thanksgiving
[23:46] Day on the US side. Amen. Help me sing
[23:49] this song this morning.
[23:52] So I'm casting all my cares on you.
[24:11] Heat. Heat.
[24:21] Heat.
[24:24] Heat.
[24:34] He's alive and he's coming back for you
[24:38] and me. Let's sing it again.
[24:52] Yeah.
[24:53] [Applause]
[24:55] Heat.
[25:05] is the story
[25:11] for
[25:19] my redeemer
[25:26] And he's coming back for you and me.
[25:32] [Music]
[25:42] [Music]
[26:03] You may feel down and feel like God has
[26:09] somehow forgotten
[26:11] [Music]
[26:14] that you are faced with circumstances
[26:19] you can't get through
[26:24] right now. It seems like there's no way
[26:28] out and you're going under.
[26:34] But God's proven time and time again
[26:39] he'll take care of you.
[26:42] [Music]
[26:45] He'll do it again. He'll do it again.
[26:50] Do it again. He'll do it again.
[26:55] Just take a look at where you are now.
[27:00] And where you been?
[27:04] Hasn't he always come through for you?
[27:09] &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then. Don't you
[27:12] know God cannot fail?
[27:15] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[27:18] when, but he'll do it again.
[27:25] God knows the pain that you're going
[27:28] through. And he knows how you're
[27:31] hurting.
[27:33] [Music]
[27:35] You see, he knows just how your heart
[27:39] has been broken in two.
[27:44] But he's the God of the stars and of the
[27:47] sun and of the sea. And he is your
[27:51] father.
[27:55] He can calm the storms and find a way to
[28:00] fix it for you.
[28:04] And he'll do it again.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. He'll do it again. If
[28:15] you just take a look at where you are
[28:19] now and where you been,
[28:25] he always come through for you. He's the
[28:30] same now as then. Don't you know God
[28:33] cannot fail?
[28:35] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[28:38] when. But he'll do it again.
[28:44] Oh,
[28:45] he's still God.
[28:48] still.
[28:53] Oh, he's still gone
[28:59] and he will not change.
[29:03] Oh, I know that he's gone
[29:09] and he's fighting for
[29:14] just like Moses. Like just like Daniel
[29:19] just like Shadrach Me.
[29:25] He'll do it again.
[29:30] He'll do it again.
[29:35] If you just take a look at where you are
[29:39] now and where you been,
[29:44] why hasn't he always come through for
[29:49] you? He's the same now as you know.
[29:55] You may not know how. You may not know
[29:59] when, but he'll do it again.
[30:04] And you may not know how. You may not
[30:08] know how.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; And you may not know it.
[30:12] May not know.
[30:14] You may not know how. You may not know
[30:19] it.
[30:23] But I'm glad
[30:26] he'll do it
[30:30] again.
[30:43] [Music]
[30:43] [Applause]
[30:44] [Music]
[30:59] Amen. Let's stand together, friends.
[31:02] [Music]
[31:05] Hebrews 13:8 says he'll do it again
[31:09] because he's already done it once.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Can't break his pattern. When the man of
[31:14] God steps to the pulpit this morning,
[31:17] there's something inside of you that can
[31:19] pull on the gift that's within him that
[31:22] will bring God on the scene. Let's just
[31:24] sing this chorus together as our pastor
[31:26] comes this morning. Holy,
[31:36] holy,
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] all things are possible.
[31:47] [Music]
[31:59] [Music]
[32:01] All
[32:07] [Music]
[32:09] things are possible.
[32:15] Oh,

[33:08] [Music]
[33:10] Lord, I
[33:14] &gt;&gt; receive it in your heart now.
[33:16] Lord,
[33:19] I receive
[33:23] Lord,
[33:26] I receive
[33:30] all
[33:33] possible.
[33:36] Lord, I
[33:39] receive.
[33:40] [Music]
[33:43] Lord,
[33:45] I receive.
[33:47] [Music]
[33:54] How we appreciate your grace, Lord.
[34:02] Lord God,
[34:06] &gt;&gt; just as our pastor comes, Jesus is here.
[34:09] Oh, Jesus
[34:12] is here.
[34:13] [Applause]
[34:15] Jesus
[34:18] Christ is
[34:20] [Music]
[34:36] Jesus
[34:38] is
[34:40] [Music]
[34:42] my Jesus.
[34:43] [Music]
[34:49] All
[34:51] our
[34:52] [Music]
[34:55] Jesus
[34:58] is here.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the wonderful part?
[35:07] &gt;&gt; You're here.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; I'm here. That wouldn't mean a whole lot
[35:12] if he wasn't here.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We mean that from the depths
[35:19] of our heart. We want him in all of his
[35:23] not all of his beauty only, but with all
[35:26] of his power, his wonderful supernatural
[35:30] working power. And uh I want to have I'm
[35:35] just going to break from the normal
[35:37] uh format of reading the service. So,
[35:40] I'm going to ask our brother David to
[35:42] come. Our brother David has been uh uh
[35:46] afflicted with an ongoing
[35:49] uh difficulty, affliction,
[35:53] and sickness.
[35:55] And uh we're going to pray for him right
[35:57] now. We're going to lay hands on him
[36:01] &gt;&gt; and we're going to believe that Jesus is
[36:03] here
[36:05] &gt;&gt; and that it won't only be our hands.
[36:08] And as and and as weakened as he is from
[36:11] time to time, he never fails to stand at
[36:14] the post of duty. And I I haven't only
[36:17] seen that, but God has seen that. And
[36:20] God has great respect for it. And I want
[36:22] to say to David's parents,
[36:25] I as soon as I I I've had brother David
[36:28] on my heart for a few days and he just
[36:30] passed by in front of my car and my wife
[36:33] and I began to speak and I just felt he
[36:36] really needs our prayers. He needs the
[36:40] combined
[36:42] force of faith
[36:44] &gt;&gt; of the body of Jesus Christ. I hear the
[36:47] prophet crying out when the people are
[36:49] beginning to rejoice and believe God.
[36:52] And he says there just a whole the whole
[36:54] congregation is just a milky wave over
[36:56] the congregation because it's a faith
[36:58] bank.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I believe in this God.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; And I believe in that faith bank.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; I believe in the promises of God are yay
[37:07] and amen to them that believe. And I
[37:10] believe that this affliction has no
[37:11] business in this body.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I ask you to stand. I know
[37:17] that you will stand with us in prayer at
[37:19] this time. And uh I'm going to also uh
[37:24] have our our brother Jean Jacques. I
[37:26] wonder if you would come also
[37:30] if you would just come also join us to
[37:33] lay hands. Yesterday was the anniversary
[37:37] of brother Jean Jacques being struck
[37:39] down. It was their anniversary, their
[37:42] wedding anniversary yesterday. 39 years
[37:46] on their 38th anniversary. He knew
[37:49] nothing about it. He was struck down,
[37:52] never came to consciousness in the
[37:53] morning. A man happened to find him.
[37:56] Paramedics broke in
[37:59] uh and and carried him to the hospital.
[38:02] He knew nothing for the next number of
[38:04] days until I I can see a great faith in
[38:08] his wife, Sister Marinette, and faith in
[38:12] the people that believed and prayed. And
[38:15] some days later, when the doctors had
[38:17] already given up hope, his son walked in
[38:20] to the hospital bed from a total
[38:23] unconscious state for days. And he said,
[38:26] he greeted his father. Hello, father.
[38:29] And he opened his eyes and greeted his
[38:31] son and then greeted the doctor after
[38:35] that. And with menitis completely
[38:38] covering his brain and a menitis which
[38:41] they physician said cannot dissipate out
[38:44] of the body. There's no way for it to
[38:47] dissipate out of the body. God raised
[38:49] him up. And our sister Marinette who
[38:52] stands here said to the medical team and
[38:55] to the specialists, "Have you ever seen
[38:57] this kind of case before?"
[39:01] He said, "Yes, we have." Have you ever
[39:04] seen one walk out of the hospital? They
[39:08] said, "No, we've never seen that."
[39:12] &gt;&gt; God's still God.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:17] And I want to say to
[39:20] brother Blair and sister Rebecca,
[39:25] they can expect to have a son healed.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to anoint him with oil. Let's
[39:33] bow together. Let's sing Only Belief.
[39:40] [Music]

[41:18] name,
[41:19] &gt;&gt; glorify him,
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Let this virus depart.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; They shall die now in the holy presence
[41:26] of the almighty God.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; They shall come to nothing.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Father.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:40] Hallelujah.
[41:42] Hallelujah. Who else might be afflicted
[41:45] in the congregation? Why don't you raise
[41:47] your hands and we're going to pray
[41:49] together.
[41:50] Almighty God,
[41:53] creator of heavens and earth and giver
[41:56] of every good gift.
[41:59] How wonderful you are, master, Lord
[42:01] Jesus. Thank you for paying the price.
[42:05] Thank you for Calvary.
[42:07] Thank you for the sacrifice.
[42:10] Thank you for the words that are going
[42:11] through this building right now. It is
[42:14] finished. Thank you for the words that
[42:17] are going through us right now. Oh God,
[42:21] and our faith channel picks it up. It is
[42:24] finished.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We say to this people, be
[42:29] healed. The Lord God is our healer. The
[42:32] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I am
[42:36] the Lord that health thee.
[42:39] All thy diseases.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory. And now we give you
[42:45] praise.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; As your messenger said, now we just
[42:49] praise him. We give him thanks. Glory to
[42:52] God.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; We worship. We worship you in spirit and
[42:58] truth.

[43:17] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[43:21] We worship thee in spirit and in truth.
[43:26] We worship thee in spirit and in truth.
[43:31] [Music]
[43:41] [Music]
[43:44] We
[43:46] worship
[43:48] you.
[43:57] Heat. Heat.
[44:03] [Music]
[44:13] We worship you.
[44:23] [Music]
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:28] May God bless each one of you.
[44:31] We're going to be turning to the word
[44:34] while you're still standing. I I was so
[44:38] affected uh Sunday before last when I
[44:41] was speaking to you on the word is nigh.
[44:44] I was going to speak on part two of that
[44:47] but I feel uh just to an extension in a
[44:50] certain direction
[44:52] but there was one quote and I didn't get
[44:54] to read it. I was looking for it. I
[44:56] didn't get to read it. I perhaps spoke I
[45:00] spoke from it but I was thinking of our
[45:04] individual lives. Our homes are all
[45:07] different. Our concerns are different.
[45:10] Our connections are different. But I
[45:13] want to say to this congregation by way
[45:15] of an instruction
[45:18] and I believe this instruction with all
[45:20] that is within me. That is whatever
[45:23] situation we find ourselves in, whatever
[45:27] burden you are bearing at this time or
[45:31] whatever whatever situation may confront
[45:35] you, this is my un unequivocal
[45:39] counsel to you.
[45:42] Brother Brham is speaking of the
[45:43] transforming power
[45:47] of God that's transmitted
[45:50] by the Holy Ghost
[45:54] into your heart
[45:57] which has changed your nature
[46:00] your making and it made you another
[46:04] person. Now he's laying out a principle.
[46:08] He said you may not have felt and he
[46:10] breaks it off. You may not have felt it
[46:12] happening. You see, he said, "I don't
[46:16] know about that, but it's here anyway."
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And whether you're feeling it, whether
[46:23] you feel you say, "Oh, I have such
[46:25] questions. I have such burdens. I have
[46:29] such things I'm experiencing.
[46:32] I want to announce to you on the
[46:34] authority of the words of almighty God
[46:38] sent through Elijah the prophet that the
[46:42] answer is actually going through this
[46:45] building at this moment.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And he goes further and says it's going
[46:49] through you.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; You have to have the crystal of faith
[46:54] &gt;&gt; to pick up that answer. And then he said
[46:58] you must say yes to it. Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; So I I I'm I'm just taking some very
[47:04] basic and comprehensive words. God's
[47:08] messenger has been sent for an answer
[47:11] for every situation. There is none that
[47:15] go unanswered.
[47:17] What we need to do is catch the answer
[47:21] from that messenger. It's already here.
[47:25] And he says the he says the word of God
[47:27] and he refers to the message as the
[47:29] revealing of the word of God. It is
[47:31] actually God's word to you and me.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that?
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And it is going through us, it is going
[47:41] through this building. And so I urge you
[47:44] as you are pondering and as you read the
[47:47] messages and as God gives you puts a
[47:51] message right in front of your eyes. My
[47:53] wife was just visiting in a home the
[47:55] other day in a in a in a fellowship
[47:58] celebration. It was and and for Sister
[48:01] Lorie Snow, God bless you. And and and
[48:04] there was a message pile of message
[48:06] books just there and she just took the
[48:08] top and just opened it up and the very
[48:12] words her eyes just laid on the very
[48:14] words and just those words just began to
[48:17] minister to her. But I'll tell you why.
[48:19] You know why? because the the the words
[48:23] described exactly what was in her heart
[48:26] and she just began to say yes
[48:29] &gt;&gt; to it.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, this may sound too simple,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; but he said, "I can prove that to you
[48:38] right now that there's radio coming
[48:40] through you
[48:42] &gt;&gt; and there's television pictures coming
[48:45] right through you. You don't feel it,
[48:49] but it's there anyhow.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to accept that.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Please, as your brother, you accept that
[48:57] &gt;&gt; there's radio waves going through you.
[48:59] There's pictures and television going
[49:02] through you. He said, and it's sweeping
[49:04] through this building. He said now if
[49:07] our body was mechani ma me magnetized to
[49:11] that like the big word yes he said
[49:15] stretched out here from window to this
[49:18] side to window it's sweeping through
[49:21] this building yes going right through
[49:24] you somebody saying yes on the radio
[49:28] well it comes right through you and as
[49:31] it goes through you them powers
[49:33] electronics and so forth as it goes
[49:35] through your body. Now, when it hits
[49:37] against the crystal, he said on the set,
[49:40] it just catches like that and you hear.
[49:43] Yes. Now he said if God up there said by
[49:48] his stripes
[49:50] &gt;&gt; you were healed.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost entwined
[49:55] [Applause]
[49:57] &gt;&gt; and brings that down by the power of God
[50:01] &gt;&gt; and your heart set on that and it says
[50:05] yes
[50:06] &gt;&gt; and by his stripes you are healed. God
[50:10] said it in Mark, "Whatsoever things you
[50:12] desire, what is your desire as you stand
[50:16] here today in this meeting?" We don't
[50:17] want to have just church. We want to see
[50:20] God come and minister and answer to you
[50:23] individually. I want to minister to you
[50:26] as an individual. And God wants to, he's
[50:29] your father.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; And said, "Lord, we prayed for a
[50:32] meeting." He said, and he said, "We've
[50:35] prayed for a meeting. We've been fasting
[50:37] for a meeting. We've been crying for a
[50:39] meeting. Yes, Lord. I believe the
[50:42] meetings on the road.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then stand there." Here's his
[50:47] instructions. These words are
[50:49] penetrating me. They're going through
[50:51] me.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; And I have a I have a magnet of faith
[50:57] &gt;&gt; that has laid hold of them. And he says,
[50:59] "Then stand there." Like, oh, the power
[51:03] of God comes down. When it hits it says
[51:07] yes. And the next man says yes. He says
[51:11] uh look he said you've got double power.
[51:14] Yes. Yes. Triple power. Four times the
[51:18] power of yes. And the first thing you
[51:20] know it becomes thousands of powers of
[51:24] yes. He said then the Holy Ghost moves
[51:27] in.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you've got a unity. You've
[51:30] got a oneness. All in the same mind. The
[51:33] same mind saying yes. Yes. Yes. To the
[51:38] word of God. The message of the hour. I
[51:41] want to say to you today before it even
[51:43] start. The message of the hour is
[51:45] penetrating your being at this moment.
[51:48] And you all you need to do is
[51:50] acknowledge it, accept it, regard it. It
[51:53] is even scientific. But more than
[51:55] scientific, it's spiritual.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And I say yes, oh Lord. Yes. I say yes
[52:02] to your will and your way.
[52:06] God bless you.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Have we got some time for the word now?
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Let's have a meeting.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Take your Bible if you would and we turn
[52:25] to
[52:26] Luke's Gospel
[52:29] uh chapter 21.
[52:39] I'm going to read from verse
[52:42] nine.
[52:45] But when ye shall hear of wars and
[52:48] commotions,
[52:50] be not terrified,
[52:52] for these things must first come to
[52:54] pass, but the end is not by and by. Then
[52:59] said he unto them, "Nation
[53:03] shall rise against nation, and kingdom
[53:05] against kingdom, and great earthquakes
[53:09] shall be in diverse places, and famines
[53:11] and pestilences,
[53:13] and fearful sights and great signs
[53:17] shall there be from heaven."
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I have two other scriptures. We'll just
[53:23] read. Go back to Luke 16
[53:27] and the 16th verse.
[53:34] and the law and the prophets where until
[53:37] John
[53:39] since that time the kingdom of God is
[53:44] preached.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; So now I we have a time frame here and
[53:50] then I will turn to Matthew 11
[53:54] and the 12th verse.
[54:10] And from the days of John the Baptist
[54:13] until now, the kingdom of heaven
[54:16] suffereth violence, and the violent take
[54:19] it by force.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice if you would please once
[54:23] again and from the days from the days of
[54:26] John the Baptist
[54:28] &gt;&gt; until now the kingdom of heaven
[54:30] suffereth violence and the violent take
[54:33] it by force.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[54:47] I want to draw your attention
[54:50] and have you think this this will take
[54:52] some concentrated mental effort on your
[54:56] part. I want to speak to you on the the
[55:00] in between time.
[55:04] The in between time. And as you think
[55:08] about that, I will try to define it for
[55:12] you as quickly as possible.
[55:15] There are in between times that are
[55:21] uh really quite easily to distinguish
[55:24] because they're large. You could say as
[55:28] the scripture says, once I was young,
[55:30] now I am old.
[55:32] Uh well that's no mystery and that's an
[55:36] in but there's a lot that's happened
[55:38] from the time that you were young to the
[55:41] time that you got older. But within that
[55:43] span of time there are also periods of
[55:47] of very significant change. They speak
[55:51] of going, you know, from childhood when
[55:53] you reach into adulthood and it's kind
[55:55] of a mysterious time and young fellow's
[55:59] voice changes and and uh you know they
[56:02] become manly and they have certain
[56:04] things taking place in their body and
[56:07] the young girl is no longer just like a
[56:10] child anymore. It just seems in such a
[56:12] short space of time she comes in to
[56:15] become a young lady and it happens so
[56:18] quickly. And those are those are spaces
[56:21] of time
[56:23] uh in between time within the overall
[56:26] span of of time. Spiritually speaking,
[56:31] we have a events that uh that change and
[56:37] and uh events that change uh within a
[56:41] short period of time. And we we read the
[56:43] scriptures
[56:45] uh uh from the days from the days of
[56:50] John the Baptist now prior and the Bible
[56:53] says that the law and the prophets. So
[56:56] we have that great span of time. the law
[56:59] and the prophets were until John. And
[57:02] then since that time, the gospel is
[57:05] preached. And then when uh and then when
[57:07] the gospel began to be preached, it was
[57:10] a great flurry of events. John preached,
[57:14] John was put in prison, John was
[57:17] beheaded, Jesus was already on the
[57:20] scene. And the Bible says Jesus began to
[57:22] preach. John just introduced him. Jesus
[57:25] began to preach. He's only three and a
[57:28] half years of preaching and he's going
[57:31] to the cross and the crucifixion and the
[57:34] and the burial and the resurrection and
[57:38] 50 days later the Holy Spirit has fell
[57:41] on 120 people and begin to shake that
[57:44] nation and word is filtering out. So now
[57:47] we come to an in between time.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; In between the law and the prophets. We
[57:54] often refer to Malachi 4 5 and 6. Oh,
[57:57] Malachi 4 and we we see a prophet's
[58:00] ministry, but Malachi 4 actually
[58:03] involves a tremendous amount of events.
[58:07] And quite frankly, friends, I want to
[58:09] say to you, you and I are not living in
[58:13] a just an average
[58:15] time space of time.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; We're living in a very unusual space of
[58:21] time. And we need to be so much more
[58:25] alert,
[58:27] &gt;&gt; so much more conscious
[58:29] &gt;&gt; of the time that we're in. And that's
[58:31] really the purpose of my message this
[58:33] morning.
[58:35] And I'd like to take two or three things
[58:37] that uh just to expand our our thoughts
[58:41] this morning on uh things that are in
[58:44] between.
[58:46] Brother Brandham, he speaks. He says,
[58:48] "When I'm out, I'm out on missions
[58:51] and my wife writes a letter and I love
[58:55] her and she loves me." And she'd say,
[58:58] "Dear Bill, tonight I just put the
[59:02] children to bed and I've worked today."
[59:05] He said, "I see what she's writing,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; but I see." He said, "So I love So I
[59:12] love her. I can read between the lines
[59:16] &gt;&gt; and I know what she's talking about.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; She doesn't don't have to tell me.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; I know.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; So now it's something that she's not
[59:26] declaring it. She's not saying it
[59:28] plainly. It's essentially a secret. But
[59:31] he picks the secret up.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; He catches it.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's the way it is with
[59:37] God. We're not trying to study from some
[59:41] newspaper standpoint.
[59:43] some theological standpoint. And it
[59:46] isn't even that we take a message and
[59:48] try to dissect it and that put it and
[59:51] connect it together and and cause it to
[59:54] mean a certain thing because we don't
[59:56] have a special agenda. We we cannot have
[1:00:00] a particular agenda of our own. What we
[1:00:02] need to do is flow into what he had in
[1:00:05] his mind and get into God's agenda
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; and say yes to it. Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; So he said, "But I fall in love with him
[1:00:14] and get down and really get him into
[1:00:16] your heart,
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; the love of God shed abroad in our own
[1:00:22] heart by the Holy Ghost. Then go reading
[1:00:25] the Bible and you'll see it'll come out.
[1:00:28] It's coming right out between the lines
[1:00:31] and you know what he's saying." He never
[1:00:34] said that right out in a word. Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in I think the
[1:00:39] unveiling of God, he says, "You can't
[1:00:41] see it, say it right out."
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; But but he says it in such a way so that
[1:00:46] the people catch a hold of it.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus thanked the father that he hid
[1:00:52] those things from the eyes of the wise
[1:00:54] and the prudent. So now no one else
[1:00:57] could read my wife's letters like that.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; No, they could. What he's saying is they
[1:01:03] could read exactly the same words but
[1:01:06] they wouldn't get what he gets out of
[1:01:07] it.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And he says they couldn't read it like
[1:01:12] that because he says because I love her
[1:01:15] that way.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; There has to be. So the understanding of
[1:01:19] the message is really based upon a
[1:01:22] relationship with the author. I'm
[1:01:25] talking about a real living
[1:01:27] relationship,
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; not something I go to a certain church
[1:01:31] or I prayed at an altar or somebody
[1:01:34] prayed with me. It's not even that. It's
[1:01:36] not even that. It's not even who who's
[1:01:39] ministering the word first and foremost.
[1:01:41] It's your personal relationship with
[1:01:44] him. And that relationship is not
[1:01:47] something that is mysterious or
[1:01:49] difficult. It is something that should
[1:01:51] be on a continual basis. you're in in
[1:01:55] this morning or whatever it is you're
[1:01:57] doing. You can be you can be in prayer
[1:01:59] in a prayerful when you sisters are
[1:02:01] standing washing dishes
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; when you're sweeping the floor and say,
[1:02:07] "I'm I'm I'm serving my home. I'm
[1:02:10] serving my family. Oh Lord, I just do
[1:02:13] this with joy." And even though maybe
[1:02:15] I'm burdened today, I've got things on
[1:02:17] my heart today, but I know that you're
[1:02:20] the answer. Send words from your
[1:02:23] messenger. Send words from your word and
[1:02:26] let them penetrate through me. I have I
[1:02:29] have something inside that'll pick it
[1:02:31] up.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; So love enables a person to know what
[1:02:39] has not been written
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; or declared.
[1:02:44] And so now in this in between time
[1:02:48] there's an in between time between when
[1:02:50] a promise is given and when the promise
[1:02:53] is fulfilled. It might be a short period
[1:02:56] of time. It can be a very long period of
[1:03:00] time
[1:03:03] in between the time the promise was
[1:03:05] given to Abraham
[1:03:07] said you'll have a son. He was going to
[1:03:10] have Isaac. Brother Brandham says this,
[1:03:13] "But Ishmael was born in between that
[1:03:17] time."
[1:03:19] Ishmael was born in between that time,
[1:03:21] but it didn't take away.
[1:03:24] I said, "God said, I'll I'd have this
[1:03:28] boy and then call his name Joseph." And
[1:03:31] brother Brandon was talking about the
[1:03:32] promise that been made to him. And in
[1:03:34] between that time, he had a girl.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; But he said it still didn't change. And
[1:03:39] so somebody said to him, "Well, maybe
[1:03:41] it's supposed maybe maybe it was
[1:03:43] Josephine."
[1:03:45] No, he said it's not. He wouldn't be
[1:03:47] moved from that. No, it's not Josephine.
[1:03:50] Not Not because my wife had a girl. That
[1:03:51] doesn't change it. Says in between the
[1:03:54] time God gave Abraham and said, "You're
[1:03:56] going to have a son." And he has
[1:03:58] Ishmael. Says that's not it. But Isaac's
[1:04:01] still coming.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; So there is in between time. You may
[1:04:06] say, "Well, we've been promised certain
[1:04:07] things. I'm looking for the answer and
[1:04:10] now this happens or this comes into my
[1:04:12] life or something else which it seems
[1:04:15] that it's contrary to what the promise
[1:04:17] was. Don't worry, it can't it may delay
[1:04:21] things or in your mind uh may change the
[1:04:25] expectation. But let me say this.
[1:04:27] Whatever God promised, that's exactly
[1:04:30] how it's going to be
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; in spite of ourselves.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; In Corinthians, it says, "But when that
[1:04:41] which is perfect has come,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; then that which is in part has done
[1:04:45] away." And the prophet declared, "And
[1:04:47] that which is perfect has come." Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't mean that we're living
[1:04:52] in the fullness of it,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; but it has come.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; There's places in the message where I
[1:05:00] think that sometime it trips people up a
[1:05:03] wee bit and it has to do with uh I I
[1:05:06] have quotes that says the bride is
[1:05:08] sealed.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't mean that it's completely
[1:05:12] fulfilled. In other words, the word
[1:05:16] there is no further word coming to seal
[1:05:20] the bride.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; The sealing is done by a sealing angel.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And it's not it's not that it's the
[1:05:27] church is called. It can be called.
[1:05:31] There's been there's people here when
[1:05:33] that was spoken, you weren't born yet,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; but you were born with a call on your
[1:05:38] life.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You were called. Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; We're predestinated to it.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; And Paul goes on to say,
[1:05:48] "When I was a child, I spake as a
[1:05:51] child." Now, we're talking about a time
[1:05:53] frame. When I was a child, I spake as a
[1:05:56] child. I understood as a child, I
[1:05:58] thought as a child. But when I became a
[1:06:02] man, I put away childish things. Put
[1:06:05] away childish things. Didn't put away
[1:06:07] what he was as a child. didn't put away,
[1:06:13] you know, he he he couldn't undo the
[1:06:15] things that he did as a child. You do
[1:06:17] foolish things as a child. He he
[1:06:20] couldn't change that. But and and when
[1:06:22] you're a child, I've thought a lot about
[1:06:25] this. You know, when you're a child,
[1:06:27] it's amazing for a son and daughter of
[1:06:29] God. Even what you experienced as a
[1:06:32] child, when you get older and mature in
[1:06:35] spiritual things, you'll find out that
[1:06:37] God's hand was even in that
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; even in that background.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And he was he was molding you and
[1:06:46] shaping you for where you are today.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And now you can look back and say, "It
[1:06:52] seems so strange at the time, but now I
[1:06:55] understand it.
[1:06:58] Hallelujah.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I speculate. So the
[1:07:03] time between those and now we have as I
[1:07:06] read the scripture the time between John
[1:07:10] and the kingdom of God being preached.
[1:07:15] And then John the Baptist came at the
[1:07:17] end of the law and the prophets. the law
[1:07:20] and the prophets were until
[1:07:23] John.
[1:07:25] And then since that time, Jesus is
[1:07:28] saying now there's another era. Since
[1:07:30] that time, the kingdom of God is
[1:07:32] preached and every man
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; presseth into it.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; So, a new era happened
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and something that wasn't on the people
[1:07:44] before John preached now came on them.
[1:07:47] Yeah,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; there was no uh there was no nothing to
[1:07:51] initiate them pressing into something.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; It was the law and the prophets, the law
[1:07:56] and the prophets until John. And then
[1:07:58] when John came, behold the lamb of God
[1:08:02] that takes away the sin. There's one
[1:08:04] among you who laugh at I'm not worthy to
[1:08:07] undo. He will baptize you with the Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost and fire. And those things, those
[1:08:13] words meant something to some people.
[1:08:16] Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And they heard about it
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; and it set up. They had a crystal.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; They had something that was magnetized
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't forget that word and
[1:08:29] it hung into them and they began to
[1:08:31] press
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; into this kingdom.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And the violent took it by force.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; We're not sitting back here in a relaxed
[1:08:41] state, my brother, sister, just waiting
[1:08:43] for something to fall out of the
[1:08:44] heavens.
[1:08:46] the violence and we take it by force.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God has been preached.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The law and the prophets were until John
[1:08:58] and since that time the kingdom of God
[1:09:01] is preached and every man pressth into
[1:09:05] it. And then it goes on to say and from
[1:09:09] the days of John. Now it said the law
[1:09:12] and the prophets were to John. Now this
[1:09:15] next scripture is and from the days of
[1:09:18] John the Baptist until now.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; So now Jesus is taking a season within a
[1:09:24] season. Are you with me?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; He's taking a season within a season.
[1:09:29] Not a great big span of hundreds of
[1:09:31] years of the law and the prophets where
[1:09:33] until John. Now we're going and from
[1:09:35] John
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God is preached. And he
[1:09:38] says, "And then from the days of John
[1:09:41] the Baptist until now, the kingdom of
[1:09:45] heaven suffereth violence." Well,
[1:09:47] something happened now from that time to
[1:09:50] this time. Events were unfolding.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; How many people knew about it? Maybe not
[1:09:55] a whole lot. Maybe not everyone was
[1:09:58] aware of it, but something comes over
[1:10:00] them and the violent take it by force.
[1:10:04] The kingdom of heaven suffereth
[1:10:07] violence, and the violent take it by
[1:10:10] force. These weren't people that were
[1:10:12] sitting back in a whole humb state and
[1:10:15] just having some empty profession. These
[1:10:18] were people who were aggressive about
[1:10:20] what they believed in. They were zealous
[1:10:23] about what they believed in. They're
[1:10:25] ready to speak about it. Whatever was
[1:10:27] made real to them, this was a reality to
[1:10:30] them.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to think of believers as
[1:10:35] being a different breed and class of
[1:10:37] people in the world today.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; They have something of they have a
[1:10:42] strength the world knows nothing about.
[1:10:44] They've got convictions the world knows
[1:10:46] nothing about. We're not here to take
[1:10:48] the easy road. We're here to take the
[1:10:51] road of righteousness and truth and the
[1:10:53] right way. Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely thoroughly convinced of
[1:10:58] it. Yes. Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; And then he says that the kingdom of
[1:11:02] heaven suffereth violence, but Jesus
[1:11:04] said that the kingdom of God is
[1:11:06] preached. And he says, "And neither say
[1:11:10] and neither shall they say, lo here or
[1:11:12] low there, for behold the kingdom of God
[1:11:16] is within you." So now the scripture
[1:11:18] says and from the law and the prophets
[1:11:20] were until John and then from John the
[1:11:23] kingdom is preached and Jesus comes on
[1:11:25] the scene and says that kingdom is
[1:11:27] within you.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; So we can simply conclude how did the
[1:11:31] kingdom get within you? By the preaching
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; of the word for that hour
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; actually was established.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; You can't make those words mean anything
[1:11:45] else.
[1:11:47] So what are we saying? We're actually
[1:11:48] going back to a prophet's words in this
[1:11:50] day. Those words actually penetrated
[1:11:54] those people.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; They didn't have television. They didn't
[1:11:58] have radio. They knew nothing about the
[1:12:00] science. It it it's proven to you in a
[1:12:02] way that God didn't even show them back
[1:12:05] there. We we're a scientific people.
[1:12:08] We're a pushb button people. We're an
[1:12:10] instant people. We we have such high
[1:12:13] expectations for our living standard.
[1:12:15] and so on. But back there Jesus is
[1:12:18] saying that John came preaching the
[1:12:21] kingdom of God. And then he came on to
[1:12:23] say and that kingdom was in the hearts
[1:12:26] of the people. And the prophet comes and
[1:12:28] says the Holy Spirit established the
[1:12:31] kingdom in the hearts of the people.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's a it's a kingdom by
[1:12:36] spirit and word. Amen.
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; We have some very, very intelligent
[1:12:43] people, great craftsmen, great
[1:12:46] contractors. I can tell you there's no
[1:12:48] contractor that can take the place of
[1:12:51] the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; That Holy Spirit takes the substance and
[1:12:55] the material of the word and begins to
[1:12:58] build and craft into your life. I can
[1:13:00] say today, you have been wrought by
[1:13:03] almighty God.
[1:13:05] You have been created and crafted by
[1:13:08] him.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; That's why he says it takes a drunkard.
[1:13:11] How how was he a drunkard? And and in a
[1:13:14] few days, he's totally changed.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Who did that? The Holy Spirit.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Establishing the kingdom of God in that
[1:13:22] man's heart.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; What he has to do? What does he have to
[1:13:25] do? Really? Nothing. He has to from this
[1:13:28] door over to that door has to say
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:13:32] preached
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; and the preaching, the Holy Spirit takes
[1:13:36] the preaching and constructs the kingdom
[1:13:39] of God into the believer's life.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I say, praise be to God.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I want to go on record today. I believe
[1:13:47] that.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I believe that not because I'm
[1:13:50] preaching. I believe it because I have
[1:13:52] read what Elijah has said
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; and I accept it
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; and I receive it
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and I believe it'll happen today,
[1:14:03] tomorrow and throughout the rest of my
[1:14:05] life.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; This is holding power, friends.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet said is
[1:14:11] transforming power.
[1:14:15] And
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; every time you're faced with a situation
[1:14:17] or a decision,
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; you want to find the answer.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Find out exactly what the prophet of God
[1:14:24] has said.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you the God of
[1:14:29] science is sending those words through
[1:14:32] your body.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; And you must say yes to those words to
[1:14:40] have the transforming effect take place
[1:14:42] in your life. And if they are not the
[1:14:45] words of God, it will not have that kind
[1:14:47] of effect.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, the kingdom of God within you.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; He said the kingdom is not of this
[1:14:58] earth.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; God's kingdom is in your heart.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; It's the spiritual kingdom
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; that we're born into.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The kingdom of God comes
[1:15:08] not without violence."
[1:15:09] He said another place, the kingdom comes
[1:15:12] not by observation.
[1:15:14] You don't see it. You can't measure it.
[1:15:16] You maybe can't put your hands on it,
[1:15:18] but it's a reality.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; It's more real in the seat you're
[1:15:21] sitting in than the person that's beside
[1:15:23] you. It's more real in this building.
[1:15:26] All of this will pass away. But God's
[1:15:28] kingdom shall never pass away.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I came this morning
[1:15:39] expecting a meeting.
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I expected a meeting with him.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible in the one scripture we read,
[1:15:55] there'll be great signs in the heavens
[1:15:58] when you should hear wars and
[1:15:59] commotions.
[1:16:01] Be not terrified, for these things must
[1:16:04] first come to pass, but the end is not
[1:16:08] by and by.
[1:16:10] Then said he unto them, Nation shall
[1:16:12] rise against nation, kingdom against
[1:16:14] kingdom,
[1:16:15] and great earthquakes shall be in
[1:16:17] diverse places and famines, in fearful
[1:16:20] sights, and great signs
[1:16:24] shall there be in heaven.
[1:16:27] signs in the heavens that are now
[1:16:30] passed.
[1:16:33] So
[1:16:35] we can say as the word said it this was
[1:16:38] until John. Now something else happens.
[1:16:42] So there was a era all through the
[1:16:44] church ages
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; like 2,000 years
[1:16:50] and right in the evening right in the
[1:16:52] end
[1:16:54] suddenly here comes a a a messenger
[1:16:58] 1947
[1:17:01] and wasn't 1940
[1:17:06] wasn't 1942
[1:17:10] but suddenly here comes was
[1:17:13] a little frail and brother Jean Jacquan
[1:17:16] and myself, sister Marinette,
[1:17:18] we were looking at some old pictures I
[1:17:21] have of brother Brandham and some of the
[1:17:23] old clippings from newspapers and the
[1:17:27] crowds in Jonesboro, Arkansas. And I had
[1:17:30] just heard brother Brandon on tape those
[1:17:33] meetings in Jonesboro where he said
[1:17:34] those Arkansas people, they'd stand in
[1:17:37] the rain and they would wait. and he
[1:17:39] said, "No wonder God did what he did."
[1:17:41] He said, "Some of the most remarkable
[1:17:43] meetings and when I hear I I listen to
[1:17:46] that and we're going through and one of
[1:17:49] the pictures that's most touching." I
[1:17:50] believe it's brother Bernie Garcia from
[1:17:53] Phoenix. Don't quote me on this, but I
[1:17:55] think it's his father that is there and
[1:17:58] it's a in the Spanish church and Spanish
[1:18:00] people. And brother Brandham is just a
[1:18:02] frail and thin
[1:18:05] war. You can see he's wore out and he's
[1:18:08] standing. He's holding a little girl's
[1:18:09] hand and he's looking down at his hand.
[1:18:13] And I understand that she had leukemia.
[1:18:17] It's such a moving and touching picture.
[1:18:19] And here's this servant. Who ever who
[1:18:22] ever would have thought
[1:18:25] that it would come that way? that God
[1:18:28] would raise up a man with hardly any
[1:18:30] education out of poverty and knows
[1:18:34] nothing about theology and has perhaps a
[1:18:37] halting and poor English and simple. Who
[1:18:41] ever would have thought
[1:18:43] that God would get the attention of the
[1:18:46] world
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; by a man taking people by the hand.
[1:18:50] He looks on it and I saw him. I was
[1:18:53] about your age.
[1:18:55] saw him taken by the hand.
[1:18:58] Brother CF Huitt is a Pentecostal pastor
[1:19:02] in Boisee, Idaho. His boy was about 8
[1:19:05] years old and as a boy would he was
[1:19:08] thirsty and he just drank some water out
[1:19:10] of the ditch and the water was
[1:19:12] contaminated with with sewage and it
[1:19:15] attacked his heart. And they took him to
[1:19:18] Mayo Clinic and they said he won't live.
[1:19:22] He maybe wouldn't live till he's 10
[1:19:24] years old. And when he was about 10
[1:19:26] years old, he is so they're trying to
[1:19:28] get him to go to school. He can only be
[1:19:30] there a short time, no strength.
[1:19:33] And they heard that there's a man by the
[1:19:35] name of William Brham. There just some
[1:19:37] great meetings taking place in
[1:19:39] California. And so they go down there.
[1:19:41] Brother Huitt told me he was a friend of
[1:19:43] mine. He preached up in our church in
[1:19:45] Dawson Creek. and he went there and and
[1:19:49] it was exactly as we saw in Vernon,
[1:19:51] British Columbia. The people are just
[1:19:53] mobbed at the door. You can't even get
[1:19:55] near the door at 2 3 in the afternoon.
[1:19:57] He thought, "Well, my goodness, this is
[1:19:59] different." So, he thought, "I can't get
[1:20:01] in here. I know where he's going to be.
[1:20:04] I know the pastor in Sacramento where
[1:20:06] he's going to be, so I'll go there." So,
[1:20:09] I believe it was Joe Morris if I
[1:20:11] remember correctly. And so he went to
[1:20:13] the his his friend, pastor friend in
[1:20:15] Sacramento said, "My boy is deathly
[1:20:18] ill." And he said, "I'll have you on the
[1:20:20] platform. You're going to sit in the
[1:20:22] platform with me and we'll have him up
[1:20:24] the first one in the line." You know,
[1:20:26] that was the pastor's uh uh kind of his
[1:20:29] thought of it. And brother Huitt was
[1:20:31] sitting on the platform. And he was kind
[1:20:34] of skeptical. He didn't know what to
[1:20:35] think about this. And Sister Hwitt came
[1:20:38] up. He wasn't the first one. He was the
[1:20:40] last one in the healing line. And sister
[1:20:43] Grea Hwitt came up. We knew them for
[1:20:45] about 40 years. And she's got the she
[1:20:48] got the son with her.
[1:20:51] And brother Benham took his hand. And
[1:20:54] brother Huitt sitting back where brother
[1:20:56] Tom said, "If he says what we wrote on
[1:21:00] the card, I will believe that he is that
[1:21:03] prophet. Not just a prophet, but that
[1:21:06] prophet." Whatever that was in his mind.
[1:21:10] and and and Sister Huitt, she's standing
[1:21:13] there. Brother Brandham takes his hand
[1:21:16] and he says to the mother, he said, "Uh,
[1:21:22] now he said, I don't know if God will
[1:21:25] heal him."
[1:21:28] But he says, "You you watch my hand.
[1:21:32] I'm going to ask everyone," he said, "to
[1:21:34] close their eyes. But I'll ask you to
[1:21:36] keep your eyes open and watch my hand.
[1:21:39] He said, if my hand becomes normal, the
[1:21:43] boy is healed. If it does not become
[1:21:47] normal, God has chosen not to heal the
[1:21:50] boy. Isn't that simple?
[1:21:53] Isn't that simple?
[1:21:55] And he said,
[1:21:58] "And the boy has this and this and
[1:22:02] this." And he named all three things.
[1:22:05] And brother Brandham turned around and
[1:22:08] pointed to brother Hwitt and he said,
[1:22:10] "And you said in your heart, if I said
[1:22:13] those things, you would believe."
[1:22:19] Shouldn't take much more, should it?
[1:22:23] And prayed and he was healed.
[1:22:26] And the last I heard of Kenneth Hewitt,
[1:22:28] he was a man in his 40s or something, a
[1:22:31] electrical contractor in the Boisee
[1:22:34] Valley someplace. Now, who would have
[1:22:37] thought? I just said that not to take up
[1:22:38] time, friends, who would have thought
[1:22:41] that God would begin to catch the
[1:22:43] attention of the people and thousands
[1:22:47] and tens of thousands. And then it
[1:22:50] wasn't just and this is my my I believe
[1:22:53] this with all my heart and soul. The
[1:22:55] spirit of Elijah fell on the whole globe
[1:22:59] and men raised up all over the place.
[1:23:02] Whether it be Oral Roberts or Tommy
[1:23:03] Osbor, Tommy Hicks and Vlner Gardener
[1:23:05] and Jack Cole and O Jaggers and on and
[1:23:08] on and men who you never heard their
[1:23:10] name. They just found that spirit was on
[1:23:12] them. We had it way up in the north, way
[1:23:14] in the far north and little ministers
[1:23:16] and it just began to fall on them
[1:23:18] everywhere. And some people thought, you
[1:23:20] know, maybe over in Saskatchewan, North
[1:23:22] Bford, they thought that they were a
[1:23:24] special group and that God had ordained
[1:23:27] them, not realizing that God had
[1:23:29] actually swept over the whole globe and
[1:23:32] it was happening in other countries. It
[1:23:34] was the spirit of the supernatural that
[1:23:35] had come because it was the spirit of
[1:23:37] Elijah. But the purpose of it was to
[1:23:39] catch attention of the people
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; because a word was following.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "If a voice
[1:23:46] doesn't follow it, don't pay any
[1:23:47] attention to all the signs."
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; A voice followed this one.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And what a voice.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; What a message.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the miracle that goes through
[1:23:57] you. It's the voice that goes through
[1:24:00] you.
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That voice begin to thunder out.
[1:24:07] Hallelujah. The living voice of God
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; and begin to go through the people.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And some people were m magnetized to it
[1:24:16] and they caught it.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; They were expecting something from God
[1:24:20] and they caught it
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; while many others didn't catch it. I
[1:24:24] want to catch
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; what God has for us in this in between
[1:24:27] time.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; We're in a very, very crucial time.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; And there'll be signs from heaven.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; These signs, phenomenal sign. I'm going
[1:24:41] to just show you a sign in a moment.
[1:24:46] And the prophet says in the feast of the
[1:24:48] trumpet,
[1:24:50] the moon is the wife of the sun.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And the sun, when the sun is gone, in
[1:24:57] the absence of the sun, the moon
[1:24:59] reflects the light
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; to the earth. He He's in the heavens.
[1:25:02] Now
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; you have to stay with me cuz I'm going
[1:25:06] to maybe be all over the map, but it
[1:25:08] does have continuity.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; And the moon reflects the light of the
[1:25:13] earth to the earth, which is a type of
[1:25:16] the church. And when the pope
[1:25:21] leaves the a and he he he said when he
[1:25:23] leaves and he says the ancient enemy of
[1:25:27] the church and comes over to Jerusalem
[1:25:32] which is the seat of the church which
[1:25:35] the new Jerusalem and the old Jerusalem.
[1:25:38] He said we noticed before it did there
[1:25:41] was a total blackout of the moon
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; before he made this visit.
[1:25:47] There was a total blackout of the moon.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; And this was the first time in history.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; That a pope leaves
[1:25:59] the Vatican
[1:26:01] and goes to Jerusalem. I wonder if I can
[1:26:04] just show this.
[1:26:11] And that is a picture of him there
[1:26:16] in Jerusalem.
[1:26:19] And it was January 1964,
[1:26:22] the first ever papal visit to Israel.
[1:26:27] During his short trip to Israel, it
[1:26:29] lasted only 11 hours.
[1:26:32] Pope Paul V 6th never once called Israel
[1:26:36] by name and went out of his way to avoid
[1:26:40] using the word Jews. So he never used
[1:26:44] the word Jews. In those days the Vatican
[1:26:47] saw Israel as a non-country
[1:26:51] and its people as a non-nation. I just
[1:26:55] want to stop there with those words
[1:26:58] above you. Now he has a message
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; and his message he even he even uh in
[1:27:09] his speech
[1:27:11] he spoke positively
[1:27:14] towards the preceding pope that was
[1:27:17] silent
[1:27:19] completely silent while 6 million Jews
[1:27:22] were murdered
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; and he lifts him up and gives him uh an
[1:27:28] honorable mention I'll say and now he's
[1:27:32] here
[1:27:34] in Jerusalem
[1:27:36] God's city and he will not even mention
[1:27:40] Israel and will not mention God's people
[1:27:44] no wonder the prophet says the ancient
[1:27:47] enemy of the church
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; and while he was visiting
[1:27:55] there's another messenger
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:27:58] another angel messenger
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; sent to the whole earth
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; to the elect
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; and he has different words
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and his words are that it was the tender
[1:28:10] hand of Jehovah
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; and his words are it was the blowing of
[1:28:15] a trumpet
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; the holocaust was a trumpet he even said
[1:28:19] that Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini and
[1:28:23] these people that was a trumpet
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; because the trumpet is a calling
[1:28:28] And it was calling those people back
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; back to Israel.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And those words were penetrating another
[1:28:36] group of people and they were saying
[1:28:38] yes.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; While the Christian world thought that
[1:28:44] this is a great visit and the things and
[1:28:46] the media and everybody hanging on to
[1:28:49] every word that the that the pope may
[1:28:52] speak. But there is another little group
[1:28:54] of people, a little elect. And many of
[1:28:57] you were not perhaps even born and not
[1:29:00] called yet, but you were the called of
[1:29:03] God. And God knew that you were going to
[1:29:05] come. And God magnetized you inside. And
[1:29:09] he gave you a holy crystal that picked
[1:29:12] up these words. And when it registered
[1:29:15] on that crystal, you said, "Yes, this is
[1:29:18] the truth.
[1:29:20] I don't understand it, but this is God's
[1:29:22] word to me.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Is it to you today?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; And here's a man that won't use the word
[1:29:32] Jew. And here's another messenger
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; that doesn't only use the word Jew, but
[1:29:38] he says that they're coming in. They're
[1:29:39] being gathered for the atonement.
[1:29:43] They're being gathered so that Christ
[1:29:45] Jesus almighty God is going to come down
[1:29:47] and make himself known to those people.
[1:29:50] And so the very group of people that
[1:29:52] this man is disregarding, here's a
[1:29:55] messenger saying they are the apple of
[1:29:57] God's eye,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; the creator knows that they're there
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; and the creator sent them back there.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And now he comes to this group of people
[1:30:12] to leave you and I some of these things
[1:30:16] that are taking place and identify them.
[1:30:18] So here's a messenger
[1:30:21] on earth and he identifies
[1:30:25] what we call scientifically an eclipse.
[1:30:28] He says the moon. He calls what it is
[1:30:31] the wife of the sun.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; It's the church.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; It's being blackened out.
[1:30:39] By all of this religion
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; and he identifies the system on earth,
[1:30:46] the first church that broke and became a
[1:30:48] denomination
[1:30:49] and it blackened out the gospel of Jesus
[1:30:53] Christ.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; And to show that the personification of
[1:30:57] this blacking out, God in the heavens
[1:31:01] blacken the moon out completely while
[1:31:04] the pope is making his journey to
[1:31:06] Jerusalem. There will be great signs in
[1:31:10] the heavens.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Many of you here lived through that
[1:31:14] 1964.
[1:31:16] You were living. Some of you were in
[1:31:18] school. Some of you in college. Some of
[1:31:21] you are already married. Some of you
[1:31:23] were not born. But those of you that
[1:31:26] were living, I can assure you no one
[1:31:30] knew anything about
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; what was happening
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; while it was happening.
[1:31:39] And we can say all through the church
[1:31:41] ages
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; until
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Elijah came.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And then we could come and say, but
[1:31:48] since the days of Elijah,
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; there were signs in the heavens
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and signs in the earth
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and turmoil of people unlike any time
[1:32:04] before. Why? because it's the days of
[1:32:06] Elijah.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And since the days of John, this is
[1:32:11] what's happening. Since the days of
[1:32:13] John, the the kingdom of God suffered
[1:32:16] violence. Since the days of Elijah, the
[1:32:18] kingdom of God suffered violence, but
[1:32:21] the violent take it by force.
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:30] Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Pope Pon Paul V 6th even used the
[1:32:39] occasion to praise his mentor Pope Pas I
[1:32:43] 12th defending the latter silence during
[1:32:46] the Holocaust.
[1:32:49] That's all. So we can take that off now.
[1:32:56] Brother Benham said
[1:32:59] and in the papers across the nation have
[1:33:02] to follow very close to continuity
[1:33:04] please. And in the papers across the
[1:33:07] nation
[1:33:08] we have on the board. Now he's got the
[1:33:11] papers in the nation we have on the
[1:33:12] board which he drew.
[1:33:17] It displayed how that the moon turned
[1:33:20] from light to darkness and the very
[1:33:23] phenomena of it that the moon drew
[1:33:26] exactly in the skies. The same thing
[1:33:29] that the Holy Spirit had me draw two
[1:33:32] years ago.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And showing the covering.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So two years before
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; we have God the artist in the heavens
[1:33:44] and we have Elijah his artist on earth.
[1:33:47] And God draws something in the heavens
[1:33:49] and his artist draws something here.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandman who said he couldn't
[1:33:53] draw anything,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; but he drew exactly those seven circles.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And they and they showed six in the
[1:34:01] heavens, but he said he drew the seventh
[1:34:03] one.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And he said this,
[1:34:07] how the Holy Spirit had him draw two
[1:34:08] years ago the covering. He said, "And
[1:34:10] when it went six pictures,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I put the seventh there because the
[1:34:17] seventh age just a shadow of light
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; the going off that." Now I'm talking in
[1:34:23] between.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:24] Now a prophet now Elijah he's drawing
[1:34:27] the seventh and he's just showing that
[1:34:29] there's just a a ray of light and he
[1:34:33] says that's where that's now watch
[1:34:36] that's where now here's Elijah drawing
[1:34:38] it and he leaves just a little ray of
[1:34:41] light and he said that's where
[1:34:45] Jesus is at the door knocking.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; So now he takes the drawing and brings
[1:34:51] it straight into the scripture. Yes.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And I drew it that way because Jesus is
[1:34:57] at the door knocking.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And so here we are living, some of us
[1:35:02] living at that time.
[1:35:04] Who knew
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; that now Jesus was outside?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Who knew that he's knocking?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Who knew that he's being put out? But
[1:35:16] now it had to be declared
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; so that you would un understand and I
[1:35:21] would understand what is happening in
[1:35:23] our time.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; And he said
[1:35:28] but it goes but it goes into total
[1:35:31] darkness.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Is this too laborious for you?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; And what a reflection. He just stops and
[1:35:38] says what a reflection.
[1:35:42] What a message from God himself.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; That these things are the truth.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Testified. Watch now. Testified it first
[1:35:53] in his word.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Then by the spirit at the platform.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And then declared in the heavens.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; So he said, "So here it is.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; First it's in the word.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Then it's declared here at the platform.
[1:36:12] And it's in the heavens.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; There'll be great signs in the heavens.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; But it took a messenger to be able to
[1:36:22] identify the sign and tie it back to the
[1:36:25] scripture.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; And now we have a complete perfect
[1:36:30] confirmation
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; in the word, at the platform, and in the
[1:36:34] heavens.
[1:36:41] Now,
[1:36:44] he said also that the messenger came,
[1:36:48] and we're in a class, and I hope you
[1:36:50] young people will hang on to this very
[1:36:52] close because this is more of a study.
[1:36:56] The messenger always came at the end
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; of the age.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; He's announcing the next age.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And that's why they're rejected. So he
[1:37:09] comes at the end of the age. And I'm
[1:37:11] talking about the in between time.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; So we're not talking about the time and
[1:37:16] what happened in that age.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; We're talking now about what happened
[1:37:21] when the messenger at the end of that
[1:37:24] age. You said Paul came in at the end
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; of the age and brought in the grace, the
[1:37:30] message of grace from the law.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And then each messenger as time rolled
[1:37:35] through for 2,000 years came at the end
[1:37:38] of the age.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And at the end of the age of the last
[1:37:42] Leodysian age,
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; no wonder this could not be a reformer.
[1:37:48] He had to be a prophet that could look
[1:37:51] into the heavens and say, "There's the
[1:37:53] sign." He could look into the word and
[1:37:55] say, "Here it is right here."
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; That sign is Jesus knocking at the door.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; and he comes right at the end of the
[1:38:09] Leodysian age.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; What is what is supposed to happen
[1:38:12] between in this in between time? And
[1:38:16] it's like it was when Jesus came right
[1:38:18] to the time of the cross. So many things
[1:38:20] were happening and it left the people in
[1:38:23] wonderment and in question. We're there.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; All I can say to you friends, we are in
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; you are in whether you want to regard it
[1:38:33] or recognize it or not. You are in the
[1:38:35] in between time.
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:39] [Applause]
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And even knowing that I think will be
[1:38:44] helpful to you.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] He said many of us, he said, remember
[1:38:49] Paul came at the end of the age
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; and all messengers come at the end of
[1:38:54] the age. It's the end time
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; when these things are brought forth.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I just digress for a moment, but don't
[1:39:03] don't lose that thought. So, I'm coming
[1:39:06] immediately back to it.
[1:39:09] When they made a covenant,
[1:39:12] the old eastern covenant,
[1:39:15] they would take an animal and slay the
[1:39:17] animal
[1:39:19] like they did
[1:39:21] like he did with Abraham and put the
[1:39:24] pieces off and divide the pieces that
[1:39:27] were slain and and cut.
[1:39:30] And then the two who were making the
[1:39:33] covenant
[1:39:34] would stand
[1:39:36] between
[1:39:38] those pieces
[1:39:40] and they would have a writing
[1:39:43] on a parchment or perhaps a sheep skin
[1:39:48] and they would write the words of their
[1:39:51] covenant.
[1:39:53] Then they would tear
[1:39:55] that parchment or skin and each take
[1:40:00] half
[1:40:01] and step out then from between this. And
[1:40:05] what it was is that
[1:40:09] if either one of them should break
[1:40:13] their their promise, their covenant,
[1:40:17] let them be as one of these.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Let them be as slain as one of these.
[1:40:24] That's how serious the covenant was.
[1:40:29] I have to just take and I pray that God
[1:40:32] give you a
[1:40:34] deep understanding
[1:40:38] when the prophet begins to describe
[1:40:41] Revelation 10:1
[1:40:44] and I saw another mighty angel
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven
[1:40:50] and brother Brandham said it's Christ.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says something more. For he
[1:40:57] is the covenant angel.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; He's coming down
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; with the peace.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; He's coming down because he is the word.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; But he's coming down to find the other
[1:41:10] peace.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; That had been separated from him.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And he comes to stand in the midst of
[1:41:19] the people, the called and the elect.
[1:41:23] and opens up the seals.
[1:41:28] [Music]
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; To find the other peace.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; And you had to have a peace.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; We may give a different terminology. We
[1:41:42] may call it the crystal or we may call
[1:41:45] it being magnetized.
[1:41:47] We may call it being predestinated.
[1:41:50] We may call it the seed gene of God. All
[1:41:54] having exactly the same reference.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; You have to be a part of that word.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; And that is why
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; it's not just in the emotional realm.
[1:42:05] It's not in in the mental realm of
[1:42:08] mental comprehension, but there's
[1:42:10] something inside that's beyond your
[1:42:12] understanding
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; that is responding to it perhaps even
[1:42:17] this morning. And that's saying yes.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; I don't even understand everything that
[1:42:22] brother brother Biscll is preaching. And
[1:42:24] I've read the seven trumpets and I
[1:42:27] didn't catch it. But there's something
[1:42:28] within me that is saying yes to this
[1:42:31] word.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I announce to all of you
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; the called of God, the elect of God,
[1:42:44] whoever you are, if you were with him in
[1:42:47] the beginning,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; this word and these quotes are
[1:42:51] penetrating your body
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; at this moment.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; To deny that would to deny that there's
[1:42:59] radio waves.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; For us to disbelieve would be the it
[1:43:03] would be the ultimate unbelief.
[1:43:06] Eve didn't have the science we have.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't have the science we have.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; All down through the ages, they didn't
[1:43:13] have they never had a picture of the
[1:43:16] pillar of fire hanging over a man. They
[1:43:19] never had a picture of the pillar of
[1:43:20] fire following them in the wilderness.
[1:43:23] Here we know a word that God has come
[1:43:26] scientifically and confirmed. This is my
[1:43:28] servant and this is my word and this is
[1:43:31] my chosen mouthpiece. His mouthpiece.
[1:43:35] And then he comes up and tells you these
[1:43:39] waves are going through this building.
[1:43:42] Colors are going through this building.
[1:43:44] Voices are going through this building.
[1:43:47] And I say to you in the name of the
[1:43:48] Lord, Brother Brandham's voice is going
[1:43:50] through this building.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; You may say now, I surely know you're
[1:43:57] off your rocker. That's just exactly
[1:44:00] what I want to I want to be off this
[1:44:02] rocker. I want to be into his mind and
[1:44:05] into his thoughts. And I don't want you
[1:44:07] to forget this. When you go out of these
[1:44:09] doors, when you read that message, don't
[1:44:11] think this is just a written written
[1:44:14] printed message that came off of a tape.
[1:44:16] I want you to say to yourself, "These
[1:44:18] words are circulating the earth and
[1:44:21] they're going through my body at this
[1:44:24] moment."
[1:44:27] And I have felt very very convinced that
[1:44:30] I should be here this morning to say
[1:44:34] this specifically to you.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; What you read concerning your life or
[1:44:39] concerning your situation or where
[1:44:41] you're at, remember the all knowing and
[1:44:43] the allseeing and the all compassionate
[1:44:46] God is sending his words through your
[1:44:50] very being. Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; And all you need to do,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; is come into agreement with it.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Say yes.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody else say yes with me.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We will multiply this faith
[1:45:14] in this belief by multiplied times.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. We say yes to your prophet's words.
[1:45:20] We say yes to the message of the hour.
[1:45:23] We say yes from window to window, from
[1:45:25] door to door, we say yes.
[1:45:29] [Applause]
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And the seven sealed book
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; is revealed at the time of the seven
[1:45:46] thunders
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; of Revelations 10. Yes.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He said it can only come by a prophet.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; A prophet is the only one that can bring
[1:45:55] the revelation of the seven thunders to
[1:45:57] you.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And he said the thunders in a simple
[1:46:00] form. It thundered in John's gospel. And
[1:46:03] the thunder, he said, was the voice of
[1:46:05] God. I'm telling you that voice from the
[1:46:09] heavens came and worked through a
[1:46:11] mouthpiece at a platform
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; and it's going through this room at this
[1:46:18] moment. It's going through the walls.
[1:46:22] It's going through the ceiling and it's
[1:46:24] going through this body.
[1:46:27] And I say today, I want my voice. I
[1:46:30] believe it, Lord.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I say yes to it.
[1:46:35] I say yes to your will
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; and yes to your achievement.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Whatever your will is, I say yes to it.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Then you do not have to try to change
[1:46:49] yourself.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; You do not have to try to make yourself
[1:46:53] over. That in itself is the transforming
[1:46:56] power.
[1:46:58] [Applause]
[1:47:02] He'll transform you young people into
[1:47:04] the kind
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; of men and women.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Not only that he wants that he needs.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; He'll take your lives
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; and your homes and you commit it to him.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; He has already spoken it. Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; It's just looking for a magnetized place
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; to anchor and the Holy Spirit can take
[1:47:29] that word
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; and he entwines himself.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; you'll hear radio perhaps this week.
[1:47:37] You'll hear voices, but there isn't
[1:47:40] voices. You can hear all the news talk
[1:47:42] you want. You can hear all the reports
[1:47:45] that you want, but there's none of it.
[1:47:47] Here Elijah has come and said the Holy
[1:47:51] Ghost will entwine himself around that
[1:47:54] word and bring it down into your heart.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; God give me this.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; God grant that to our people.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; God grant that to our loved ones.
[1:48:12] God grant that
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; wherever they're meeting this morning.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; God grant that to them.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; God grant that to us.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; God grant that to the bride
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; throughout the world.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] Can I go for just a few more minutes?
[1:48:43] So, if the Lord allowed me to come back
[1:48:45] to it, I'll certainly have to start
[1:48:47] because I'm only on page three.
[1:48:58] The son of man
[1:49:01] and the son of God
[1:49:04] and the son of David
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; are all the same one, Jesus Christ.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was the son of man.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; As he walked on earth
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; and was a prophet. The God prophet. Not
[1:49:19] a prophet of God, but the God prophet.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And then he said to the people, you've
[1:49:26] heard me say it before, but for those
[1:49:27] you and in the context of this message,
[1:49:30] he said,
[1:49:33] he said to his disciples, it's expedient
[1:49:35] or it's necessary for me to go. For if I
[1:49:38] do not go, the Holy Spirit will not
[1:49:40] come.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Now what he's talking about, he's
[1:49:43] talking about changing of offices.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And some things have to transpire. And
[1:49:51] the disciples, precious people, we are
[1:49:55] those disciples in a different era. and
[1:49:59] they were listening to him
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; and hearing
[1:50:03] God himself speak but were not able to
[1:50:06] comprehend all the words. And so please
[1:50:09] be patient.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I don't.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Yesterday I was just shaking my head and
[1:50:15] going through the seven trumpets and
[1:50:19] things that I needed to and I just
[1:50:22] wondered how it would unfold into a
[1:50:25] message this morning. But I had a
[1:50:26] certain confidence
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; that God wanted you to hear these
[1:50:31] things.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; And and especially in the unveiling of
[1:50:35] God
[1:50:37] also in proving his word are two places
[1:50:40] he's very very clear about this coming
[1:50:44] in three sons offices. And he comes
[1:50:46] right to the end of his ministry as the
[1:50:49] son of man on earth.
[1:50:52] Only three and a half years of ministry.
[1:50:55] And at the very end so many things
[1:50:57] transpired and and the people didn't
[1:50:59] understand and the disciples didn't
[1:51:01] understand but as I was saying they were
[1:51:04] last two weeks ago they were actually
[1:51:07] part of the event
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't understand what was
[1:51:12] happening and they were actually part of
[1:51:13] it and the scripture says that the
[1:51:16] prophets and seers and sages of past
[1:51:19] centuries they searched diligently ly.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; They searched diligently what manner and
[1:51:30] what manner of time.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The the things which they spoke which
[1:51:36] were confirmed in them by the Holy
[1:51:38] Spirit. Now friends, what you're
[1:51:40] experiencing is nothing new.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; They were godly people.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; They were predestinated people. And the
[1:51:48] spirit that was in them was uh
[1:51:51] confirming and saying out of their mouth
[1:51:54] certain things that needed to happen.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; And they said, "We don't even quite
[1:51:59] understand that." And we're searching
[1:52:02] when is this, Lord? When is this
[1:52:04] supposed to take place? And then and and
[1:52:07] and the scripture says that they were
[1:52:10] speaking of those things of of of
[1:52:13] ourselves and of them back of the New
[1:52:16] Testament era. Are you still with me?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And then Peter said they were speaking
[1:52:21] of us, speaking of them at that time.
[1:52:25] They were speaking concerning the
[1:52:27] sufferings of Christ and the glory which
[1:52:30] should follow.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now here Peter was there and
[1:52:34] the other disciples and they are right
[1:52:37] part of the glory that should follow.
[1:52:40] But they didn't know they were
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; that's you.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; They could see what was past
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; and they were yearning to know what was
[1:52:51] in the future,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; but they weren't even catching where
[1:52:54] they were in between.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And it was unfolding. Yes.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; And the resurrection took place and then
[1:53:05] they're in a short period of 50 years I
[1:53:07] mean 50 days from the resurrection to
[1:53:10] Pentecost and I have to come to that in
[1:53:12] a few minutes these feasts.
[1:53:16] And then Jesus said it's expedient for
[1:53:19] you that I go away for if I don't go
[1:53:22] away then he the comforter cannot come.
[1:53:25] Yeah.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; And and and the other part, there had to
[1:53:27] be some things unfold in the
[1:53:29] supernatural realm that the apostle
[1:53:31] Paul, the first church age messenger,
[1:53:34] was able to clarify what was happening
[1:53:36] in heaven, what was happening on earth.
[1:53:38] Jesus never told them. He never said, "I
[1:53:41] must die, and I am taking my blood into
[1:53:45] the holy of holies to stand as a
[1:53:48] propitiation for you." He wasn't saying
[1:53:51] that. Apostle Paul said that. He just
[1:53:54] said, "I must go
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; or he won't come."
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And what he was doing was telling them
[1:54:00] the ending of the son of man ministry as
[1:54:03] a prophet ministry and the coming of the
[1:54:06] son of God ministry. And that's why he
[1:54:08] could say, "I won't leave you
[1:54:10] comfortless. I will come to you because
[1:54:12] he was coming in another office in
[1:54:14] another dispensation. I'm leaving you as
[1:54:17] a son of man. I'm coming back as the son
[1:54:19] of God.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And I'll be with you as the son of God
[1:54:22] throughout the seven church ages. And at
[1:54:25] the end of the seven church ages, at the
[1:54:27] very end,
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; he has to come and fulfill the rest of
[1:54:31] it that he didn't fulfill. And so he
[1:54:34] picks up a a prophet messenger and sends
[1:54:38] him at the end of the Leodysian age for
[1:54:40] a little breach of time as the son of
[1:54:43] man so that he the the bridegroom now
[1:54:46] can reveal himself to the waiting bride.
[1:54:49] Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And now we're caught in that.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And it's unfolding so quickly. But it's
[1:55:03] only natural. We say, "Well, well, I I I
[1:55:06] believe what he said. There was a sign.
[1:55:08] I believe what the the picture brother
[1:55:10] had. I believe the pictures of the of of
[1:55:13] the uh eclipse of the moon. I I believe
[1:55:16] it was typifying the church. And I
[1:55:19] believe it was casting darkness on the
[1:55:21] earth cuz I see it everywhere. But it
[1:55:23] goes more than that.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; And so now here we are
[1:55:29] and this messenger is to come. He's to
[1:55:32] give a message
[1:55:35] that's happened.
[1:55:37] Right?
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; He's to foretell
[1:55:40] certain events
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; and they've taken place
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; and we find ourselves
[1:55:48] in a unique
[1:55:51] position where we have certain
[1:55:53] expectations.
[1:55:55] But let me declare to you in the name of
[1:55:58] the Lord, whether you have it precisely
[1:56:01] down, whether you understand it or do
[1:56:04] not clearly understand it, you have only
[1:56:07] one great responsibility.
[1:56:09] And today to hear this word that I can
[1:56:12] say to you authoratively that prophet's
[1:56:14] words and the even the words he spoke
[1:56:17] that you don't understand,
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; they go through you.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; They're penetrating through you
[1:56:23] according to his words. and long
[1:56:25] statement. They are going through you.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Don't weary of that.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Pictures are going through you.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Those words you don't understand are
[1:56:36] going through you.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; You must be in agreement with those
[1:56:40] words
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; and God will take those words because he
[1:56:43] has empowered those words
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; to transform your body
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; and to change your body.
[1:56:53] The word of the change is going through
[1:56:55] you
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; and at that precise moment you are in a
[1:56:59] yes agreement.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. I do not know how. I do not know
[1:57:05] when but I know it surely will take
[1:57:08] place.
[1:57:10] [Applause]
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "But in between
[1:57:22] In between
[1:57:25] the son of God and the son of David,
[1:57:29] he comes
[1:57:31] as son of man.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; And the son of man must be a prophet
[1:57:35] because he must utter the words of God.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Listen friends. Oh, I hope you can
[1:57:41] understand me. And the word is actually
[1:57:44] Christ himself. And so God chooses a
[1:57:47] vessel and instead of the womb of a
[1:57:50] woman, it's the mouth of a man.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; That was a mouthful.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Instead of the womb of a woman,
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; he chooses the mouth of a man,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; a prophet man. And out of this mouth
[1:58:10] comes the living word of God, Jesus
[1:58:13] Christ coming to the earth again.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; And that's why he calls it a word coming
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; to gather a people.
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; It's not great signs and wonders to
[1:58:28] gather you. The word Christ is already
[1:58:30] here. It is him here today in this
[1:58:33] building gathering you.
[1:58:37] Hallelujah.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; He's telling you children,
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; don't fear.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Transforming power is already here.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Don't fear. The change of your body is
[1:58:48] already here going directly through you.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And at the appointed time, that which is
[1:58:56] going through you is going to change
[1:58:58] your atoms
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; and you'll be a new creature.
[1:59:05] from the heavenly realm
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and you'll pass from mortal to
[1:59:10] immortality.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:15] [Applause]
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; I have a crystal in me that say yes.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we live for.
[1:59:35] That's what I'm breathing for. That's
[1:59:37] what I'm preaching for.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And that's why you're here.
[1:59:41] [Music]
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; All these things of life just become so
[1:59:47] insignificant, don't they?
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; I'll have to take up at another time.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; But what I I I will just say this to
[2:00:02] you.
[2:00:07] Brother Brham is preaching
[2:00:11] the feast of the trumpets.
[2:00:14] I just just for your thoughts so you can
[2:00:16] be pondering it.
[2:00:20] The feast there's seven seven feasts
[2:00:24] and they are found in Leviticus 23.
[2:00:30] And you'll find the feast of the
[2:00:31] trumpets
[2:00:33] between
[2:00:36] Pentecost
[2:00:38] and the day of atonement.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Because at the end of the gentile,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; at the end of the gentile age, which is
[2:00:48] the feast of long feast of Pentecost, at
[2:00:50] the end,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; comes a messenger to announce,
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; it's over.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; The bride is sealed.
[2:01:00] It's finished.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And now the next thing children
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; is these things that have happened even
[2:01:07] while some of us lived. Now he this
[2:01:09] messenger comes these things that have
[2:01:11] been happened. You thought it was a
[2:01:12] great world war and we call it a
[2:01:14] holocaust. He gave it a new name. the
[2:01:16] tender hand of Jehovah driving them back
[2:01:20] to their promised land
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; so that they will be gathered back and
[2:01:25] the trumpets gathered them back for the
[2:01:28] atonement.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; And here's where I'll be coming to.
[2:01:33] And this is, you know why I'm going to
[2:01:35] be speaking it? Cuz I don't understand
[2:01:37] it.
[2:01:41] While we're sitting here and we look and
[2:01:43] watch Israel, we say, "What's
[2:01:46] happening?"
[2:01:48] Well, this prime minister comes in and
[2:01:50] he says this and we get excited. We say,
[2:01:52] "Yeah, he's a hawk. He's a he's, you
[2:01:54] know, he's he's going to get the land
[2:01:56] back." And then the next one comes in
[2:01:58] and he's just limpo nothing and give it
[2:02:00] all back and give it to the Arabs and
[2:02:03] give it to the Palestinians and we get
[2:02:05] all down. What's happening over there? I
[2:02:07] can tell you what's happening.
[2:02:10] God is putting them in a place
[2:02:13] because the feast of the trumpets has
[2:02:15] been preached
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; and they've been gathered back
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; and God is working them over
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; until they get to such a place
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; that they'll be ready for the day of
[2:02:26] atonement.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I say, did God scatter them?
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Did God gather them back?
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; No question.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; He gathered them back.
[2:02:37] And a prophet says it's the trumpets.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; He gather them back.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; And will the day of atonement come for
[2:02:44] them?
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Will they recognize Jesus Christ?
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The words have already been
[2:02:50] spoken. And those words are actually
[2:02:52] passing through their body.
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; I feel like doing a dance
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; and one day the magnet
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; inside and they're going to come to an
[2:03:05] awareness. It was him.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; It was him.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Did we kill him?
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Did we kill our Messiah?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; And they're going to go into mourning.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to go next time.
[2:03:22] [Applause]
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been a wonderful
[2:03:33] congregation to preach to and we're
[2:03:36] going to have a baptism now. We need to
[2:03:38] have a
[2:03:40] a song. Brother Derek, can you lead us
[2:03:42] in a song? Or brother,
[2:03:46] whoever, whoever,
[2:03:53] brother John and
[2:03:57] brother Tom. It's a ray raises.

[2:04:02] Noah.
[2:04:05] Well,
[2:04:06] this I don't know if we've had this
[2:04:08] before either, and this may be a
[2:04:11] surprise, but we're going to baptize
[2:04:12] Noah
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; in water.
[2:04:20] And Noah never had a baptism like this
[2:04:23] one.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Raymond and Reesa's son.
[2:04:28] Hallelujah. He's been asking for this
[2:04:30] for a long time.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; We're so happy.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; So happy.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; I I I just love the young people so
[2:04:40] much. Noah, he gets his eyes on me and I

[2:04:49] I'm going to hug you whether you want to
[2:04:51] or not. And I see him coming. I get
[2:04:54] ready cuz I I have to give Noah a hug.
[2:04:58] Hallelujah.

[2:05:05] Jason, why don't you lead us in the
[2:05:06] song? I don't care about that beard.
[2:05:09] That's fine. Jason's been out in the
[2:05:10] wilderness.
[2:05:12] We like wilderness men, don't we?
[2:05:16] Hallelujah.
[2:05:18] I look exactly the same when I come back
[2:05:20] out of the bush, brother. Okay.
[2:05:23] [Laughter]
[2:05:27] Is it all right?
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; I just want to see brother Tom up here.

[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's been a change in me since
[2:07:45] Jesus set me free. There's been a change
[2:07:49] in me
[2:07:51] since Jesus set me free.
[2:07:56] I've been to Calary.
[2:08:01] I'm born again.
[2:08:05] I cannot turn around
[2:08:10] for my feet are on solid ground.

[2:08:49] The things I used to be

[2:11:19] God bless you. You may be seated.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:11:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; This is a big warrior. Bless you, Lord.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Noah is a warrior.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; He's joining the army today.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Noah has been wanting to be
[2:11:37] baptized for at least over a year. And
[2:11:41] he came to us and we've waited and
[2:11:43] waited and he came again. And this is
[2:11:46] brother Noah's time.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:48] And it takes a lot of courage for a
[2:11:50] young man to give his life to Christ and
[2:11:54] to overcome uh the things that would be
[2:11:57] on a young man's heart to step into this
[2:11:59] this chilly waters.
[2:12:02] Brother Brandham in God's provided way
[2:12:04] he said I tell you parents you put the
[2:12:07] right kind of a home before your
[2:12:08] children.
[2:12:10] That's the thing to do because if I'd
[2:12:12] had a Christian home I'd have been
[2:12:14] reared in. Perhaps I'd have been further
[2:12:17] along with our Lord Jesus tonight and
[2:12:19] maybe more people would have been saved.
[2:12:22] But my people was not a religious family
[2:12:25] and God just had by his amazing grace to
[2:12:28] save me. And then I've led several of
[2:12:31] them to the Lord. I baptized my mother,
[2:12:34] my father, my grandfather when he was
[2:12:37] about 90, my brothers, my little boy
[2:12:40] here, and then my little girl was seven.
[2:12:44] My other one's too young to be baptized
[2:12:46] yet. She's only two. But I trust if she
[2:12:49] lives, why then she's old enough to be
[2:12:52] baptized. She's He goes on to speak
[2:12:54] about that.
[2:12:57] When Jesus was here, he took little
[2:12:59] children up into his arms and said,
[2:13:01] "Suffer the little children to come unto
[2:13:03] me."
[2:13:06] There was another quote I wanted to
[2:13:07] share with you.
[2:13:09] Brother Vam was talking about uh two
[2:13:12] elements. One is our mind and one is our
[2:13:14] soul and we have our mental thinking and
[2:13:17] we have our soul part which he said
[2:13:19] that's God in in you. He said when you
[2:13:23] were born in this world as a child you
[2:13:25] grew to be a living son. This is you
[2:13:28] brother Noah. And at the age of choice
[2:13:31] you hear the gospel in some way and
[2:13:34] something way down inside of you tells
[2:13:37] you to receive Christ.
[2:13:39] And you'll say, "Well, I'm too young
[2:13:42] now. I'll wait a little longer." And
[2:13:45] there's there's where you make your
[2:13:47] first mistake right there. For you
[2:13:50] grieve this person inside.
[2:13:53] God's not going to judge you by this man
[2:13:55] up here, your intellect. He's going to
[2:13:58] judge you by your soul. Brother Brandham
[2:14:01] says, "Now hurry straight to the point.
[2:14:03] If the man by his intellects will
[2:14:06] finally grieve the Holy Spirit when the
[2:14:10] Holy Spirit keeps saying you should and
[2:14:13] you say, "Well, I'm too young. Well, I
[2:14:16] belong to church, but you must be born
[2:14:19] again."
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, if I can get that kind
[2:14:22] of experience, I won't be able to do
[2:14:24] this or that or I can't do this or
[2:14:26] that." Well, you see, the devil will
[2:14:28] tell you that you're going to lose some
[2:14:30] good time. You're going to lose some
[2:14:32] privileges, but he's lying to you,
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; especially to your young people.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my, you don't have to
[2:14:39] drink. You don't have to smoke. You
[2:14:42] don't have to run around in these places
[2:14:44] of amusement. Why the Holy Spirit is a
[2:14:47] million times better than all the devil
[2:14:49] could even offer you.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Why you don't have to get drunk on
[2:14:53] strong drink to have a big time. Sinners
[2:14:56] do that, but you don't have to do that.
[2:14:58] I've been preaching 23 years and I've
[2:15:01] been drunk the whole 23 years on the
[2:15:03] Holy Spirit.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; It's a stimulation itself and it'll
[2:15:07] never let up.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Noah, this is never going to let
[2:15:11] up.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; And I've always got joy, always got
[2:15:15] peace, always feel good. The Lord is
[2:15:18] here. And if I'm sick and body, he's got
[2:15:20] me happy in my soul.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; If things are going good, things are
[2:15:24] going good in my soul and bad in my
[2:15:26] body. or vice versa it makes any
[2:15:29] difference. God is always there and I'm
[2:15:31] always stimulated with a pleasure that's
[2:15:34] joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's what he does for the believer.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Noah's going to receive the Holy
[2:15:42] Ghost today.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Just a young warrior.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; He's a young man of God.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; That that heard the footsteps of a cross
[2:15:50] bumping down the hills of
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Leodysia.
[2:15:54] And he says, "I want to be identified
[2:15:56] with him."
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's bow our heads.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I'm remembering another
[2:16:06] dove that flew over another Noah one
[2:16:08] day.
[2:16:10] As it was in the days of Noah,
[2:16:13] so shall it is this afternoon.
[2:16:16] That we have another Noah that's here
[2:16:19] wanting to be identified with you,
[2:16:21] Jesus.
[2:16:22] And your prophet was speaking when he
[2:16:24] was here about
[2:16:26] our precious colored people hearing the
[2:16:29] bumping of the cross coming up and
[2:16:32] giving their lives to you. And your
[2:16:35] prophet said he remembers that and he
[2:16:39] don't forget that. He don't forget
[2:16:42] nothing. Father, would you take this
[2:16:44] brother Noah today that's amidst all the
[2:16:47] criticism and things of this life and
[2:16:50] things that a young man would endure and
[2:16:52] confusion and things that he has to grow
[2:16:55] up in things that are even
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; 10 and even a hundred times more than my
[2:17:00] generation.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; But Lord, you today are stepping inside
[2:17:04] of this vessel.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; You are looking for young warriors that
[2:17:08] are rise above their fleshly
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; fears and questions.
[2:17:13] Noah has a heart for you. He has a love
[2:17:16] and a tenderness for you.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, even through camp and even a year
[2:17:20] ago, he's desired to be free from those
[2:17:22] things that have bound him. I pray today
[2:17:26] that that dove of God would flutter
[2:17:28] within Noah's soul. That as I put him
[2:17:31] down under the water that your Holy
[2:17:32] Spirit would birth him and quicken him
[2:17:34] to a new life. May he continue to be a
[2:17:38] testimony. May he be a lighthouse. May
[2:17:41] after today, may he always come back to
[2:17:43] this moment, Lord. His mother and father
[2:17:47] are here. His auntie is here. His family
[2:17:50] is here. And the family of God is here
[2:17:52] to witness this wonderful moment when
[2:17:55] he's married to you. I pray that you
[2:17:57] would receive him, God, and baptize him
[2:17:59] with your Holy Spirit
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:04] Amen.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; But I know you've given your heart to
[2:18:07] the Lord, right?
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's just baptize you now.
[2:18:11] Amen.
[2:18:13] Amen. Brother Noah, because of your
[2:18:16] desire to be identified with Jesus
[2:18:18] Christ, I baptize you in his name, the
[2:18:20] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:18:26] [Applause]
[2:18:28] [Music]
[2:18:37] Hallelujah.
[2:18:38] [Applause]
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; If time goes on, I pray that Noah will
[2:18:52] be such an example to our other young
[2:18:55] men. God bless you young men,
[2:19:00] young ladies, families,
[2:19:03] all that are on the internet. God bless
[2:19:05] you.
[2:19:07] They're so thankful for God's people for
[2:19:10] your prayers. It's been a wonderful day.
[2:19:14] I I have to forgive me. I had a hard
[2:19:16] time stopping.
[2:19:18] And uh we'll get to it another time
[2:19:21] soon. Next Sunday is the Lord's table.
[2:19:25] Sunday evening and I'd like you also
[2:19:28] part of worship. Brother Bram says our
[2:19:30] giving. So remember our giving our
[2:19:34] tithes offering that's part of worship.
[2:19:37] We worship worship him at the at the
[2:19:39] offering as well. God bless you. Why
[2:19:42] don't you just stand and brother Tom
[2:19:44] would you take and close the service in
[2:19:46] prayer?
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; I wanted to sing. I'll say yes Lord.
[2:19:52] Yes. To your will and to your way. Would
[2:19:54] be appropriate. But we'll go to prayer.
[2:19:57] Another thing is I've been called a yes
[2:19:59] man.
[2:20:02] I have over the years, brother Biscll.
[2:20:03] I've been called a yes man.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; I am a yes man.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I'm a yes man to the son of man himself.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; And I'll stand on that. I I believe it.
[2:20:12] I've got the crystal.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; And every time I hear the word, it's
[2:20:17] yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:20:20] Yes.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; And I trust that we're a yes bride
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; to the word of God.
[2:20:27] I'll say yes, Lord. Yes to your will and
[2:20:34] to your way. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes. I
[2:20:41] will trust you and wait. When the spirit
[2:20:47] speaks to me with my whole heart I pray
[2:20:53] and my answer will
[2:20:57] one more time.
[2:21:01] Oh, I'll say yes
[2:21:06] to your will and to your way. I'll say
[2:21:11] yes Lord yes I will trust you and
[2:21:18] when your spirit speaks to me with my
[2:21:23] whole heart I
[2:21:28] answer will be yes
[2:21:36] Lord that sums up the day for name for
[2:21:40] you are the great I am.
[2:21:43] And our response to that is amen.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We've heard your word.
[2:21:50] And Father, it rings true within our
[2:21:52] souls.
[2:21:54] And God, you've opened up our eyes of
[2:21:56] understanding. And all we can say is to
[2:21:58] God be the glory. Great things you are
[2:22:01] doing and have done.
[2:22:03] We're asking Lord as we ponder the word
[2:22:06] as Mary said yes let it be unto me
[2:22:09] according to your word that we can also
[2:22:11] say yes Lord because a mouth of a
[2:22:14] prophet has spoken and that has been the
[2:22:17] spoken word seed and the womb of our
[2:22:20] soul has been opened and closed around
[2:22:22] it and now we're seeing a body change
[2:22:25] within our own lives. We're praying,
[2:22:28] God, that you'll take this word and
[2:22:31] plant it deep within the hearts of your
[2:22:33] children. And God, that they can go
[2:22:36] rejoicing,
[2:22:37] saying within their souls, yes, Lord,
[2:22:40] that's thus sayeth the word. We receive
[2:22:43] it according
[2:22:45] to your glory and honor. We ask now,
[2:22:48] Lord, that your presence go with each
[2:22:50] and every one of us. We pray, Lord, that
[2:22:52] the hand of God will keep us. We pray
[2:22:55] Lord that the dove has descended upon
[2:22:57] Noah. And God, may it speak shalom to
[2:23:00] his soul and a peace that passes all
[2:23:03] understanding. And may the fire of God
[2:23:06] consume him. And may God, you ever put a
[2:23:09] hedge of fire around him. Go with all of
[2:23:12] us. We pray. In the name of Jesus
[2:23:15] Christ, we ask it.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they all said,
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Well, why don't you greet one another?
[2:23:23] You're dismissed in Jesus name. God be
[2:23:25] with you all.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Tom, uh, I wonder if
[2:23:28] we could ask brother Jeanjac and Sister
[2:23:31] Marinette.
[2:23:33] I wonder if you could go to the back
[2:23:34] doors and so if you'd like to greet
[2:23:37] them. They have to leave tomorrow
[2:23:39] morning early and it would be nice. They
[2:23:42] so enjoyed meeting so many of you. I
[2:23:46] want to thank brother Lori and sister
[2:23:48] brother uh sister Lori and brother Randy
[2:23:51] for having us over and they were able to
[2:23:53] meet so many. It meant so much to them.
[2:23:54] So just greet them and bid them God's
[2:23:58] good God speed. God bless you.
