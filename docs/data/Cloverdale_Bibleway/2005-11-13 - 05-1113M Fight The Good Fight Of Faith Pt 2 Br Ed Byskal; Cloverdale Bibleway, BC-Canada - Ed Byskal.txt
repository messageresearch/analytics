Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Nathan Davis, brother Nathan, you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. Um, brother Bisco has some requests that he's going to take, but we have one that was just brought up here from Brother Milco and uh, his wife Johanna. Um, sends her greetings. Would very very much like to thank the church for praying for her. She was operated on last Thursday, removed her left kidney. Next day she went for a short walk and she's feeling very good. She'll be coming home um in a few days for recovery and uh brother Milco's just praying that the Lord would continue to work on her soul. And uh if you want to visit, you're welcome, but please phone first. So, let's just pray for Johanna that God would just really deal with her. And if you've got a need that you uh have on your heart this morning, you're listening over the internet, you've got a need, you just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. Nathan, [Music] bow our heads. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, it's such an honor and a privilege to be able to come here this morning. Lord, we just come expecting to hear great things, to be changed in our lives, Lord. And we ask that you just be with our pastor as he comes and breaks spread a life to us, God. That you see what we have need of, Lord. and pray you just fill us, God, with your your Holy Spirit, Father, once again. Lord, we want to thank you for these testimonies. We give you all the praise and glory, God. Lord, we ask you be with each need here, Father. Each person has a request. We bring it before you, dear Lord, and just ask that you would speak to each heart, dear Father. And Lord, we're a needy people, God. We need you constantly, Father. We thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us, dear Lord. We ask now that you'd just be the remainder of the service. Be with our worship, Lord. That it be pleasing to you, dear God. We thank you for your goodness, Lord. Be with us now in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Amen. You may be seated. [Music] I want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. If you're here this morning, we just uh we're very happy to have you here with us. And a special welcome to have brother Ben and Sister Beth Dingwald down with us. Always happy to have them here. And uh Sister Patricia Briner has a song for us this morning as uh Sister Patricia comes. Let's sing together. I just want to please the Lord. I've had that song just uh keeps going over and over through my mind and that's all I want to do. Amen. Is it your desire as well? You sing it to him as a real confession as sister Patricia comes. &gt;&gt; I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. hear and say, "Well done." Oh, I just want to please the Lord, be in his will in every way. Want to be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. here and say, "Well done." Someday [Music] [Music] Lord, you are my shepherd. You're the keeper of my heart. You guide my steps when I can't find my way. And yet I know deep within for you to truly lead. I must live in such a way that when you call my name, your whisper is enough. When I'm close enough to hear. When my one desire is just to have you near me. You still the storms around me with tender words of holyness. I want to live so that your whisper is enough. Is it any wonder that it's hard to hear your voice when we're so consumed by the cares of this world. [Music] But in an age that competes with everything you say, Lord, please give me ears to hear above the noise it makes. Till your whisper is enough and I'm close enough to hear when my one desire is just to have you near me. You still the storms around me with tender words of holyess. I want to live so that your whisper is enough. [Music] I want to live so that your whisper is enough. [Music] Thanks, Sister Patricia. Is it your desire? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to be able to hear a whisper from the Lord and to be sensitive enough to know what his will is. Amen. I know the master of the sea. Let's sing that as the choir is going to come just before brother Biscll comes to bring the word. I know the master of the way. [Music] I know the maker of the He can shine. I know. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. &gt;&gt; I know. where he can promise and make the sun shine again. I know the master of the way. &gt;&gt; And just before choir sings, I was thinking of this scripture this morning because uh knowing the song they're going to sing. It says, "But now, oh Lord, as Isaiah said, thou art our father. We are the clay and thou art and thou are potter and we all are the work of thy hand." Amen. We just want to be molded by him. Amen. And is that your prayer? Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior. I know for sure all of my days are held in your hand, crafted into your perfect plan. You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by your Holy Spirit. Teach me, dear Lord, to live all of my life through your eyes. [Music] I'm captured by your holy calling. Set me aart. I know you're drawing me to yourself. Lead me, Lord, I pray. [Music] Take me, hold me, use me, fill me. I give my life to the heart. [Music] Call me, guide me, lead me. Walk beside me. I give my life to the waterers. [Music] You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by your holy spirit. Teach me, dear Lord, to live all of my life.

[Music] Walk beside me. I give my life to the father's hand. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're ready to give oursel &gt;&gt; unreservedly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The choir be excused now. Thank you. God bless you. You can turn in your Bibles if you would please to uh Genesis the 49th chapter just while the choir is finding their seats. We'd like to say how happy we are that you are all here. We're really ha happy to have our brother Dioa with us again after uh long absence. &gt;&gt; We were having him at least I think once a year and now it's been two years. So uh our brother Dioa will be speaking to us tonight. Amen. And we're I I I just one service really isn't enough for me to hear what God is doing. And you just feel the heartbeat of of what God is doing in the Congo. It's really remarkable, friends. We we don't want to think about the great things God did yesterday and the great things God is going to do tomorrow. We want to be in tune with what God is doing right now. And I I I want to try to feel, you know, what the heart of God is. When when you see that he's just brought masses of people within the Congo, it didn't happen by accident. It happened because people had a burden and had an effort. And I see our brother Dioa. He's not a large man in stature, but he has a he has a heart that somehow God has been pleased to honor and has reached out to multitudes and not without a great deal of difficulty. Satan always uses every means to hinder. But I can say that uh much of what I will have to say this morning and what Jacob said about Joseph, his son, certainly is applicable to the bride of Jesus Christ and to men such as brother Dioa. He's been fruitful in spite of the arrows. &gt;&gt; Fruitful in spite of the difficulties and that's the way we are to be that God has given that to us. Uh before we read uh I'm going to take some prayer requests that have come in and uh our brother Ed Nicaroo has uh needs prayer for his hip. Uh and so we want to pray for brother Ed. Uh Sister Clara Wman said that her mom is requesting prayer. Isn't that nice? from the colony is requesting prayer for her brother Chris, that is Sister Wman's brother Chris who has had two accidents in one week and we believe that God is trying to get his attention. We pray for a quick recovery. Brother Jeff Mitchell injured his back yesterday. Please pray that he'll recover quickly. We had a prayer request phoned in from our sister Glenda uh Lancov and uh she did not phone. I believe her husband phoned and she had pieces of bone in her neck have been breaking off and she is in excruciating pain at this time. It's pressing on several nerves and even giving her morphine is not doing anything to control it. And she's meeting with a surgeon on the 15th. So that's this week. They desired that the Lord would touch her. I just got off the phone also with brother Glenn Grunert. And yesterday afternoon I felt to call Sister Shauna and spoke to her at the hospital regarding her mom, Sister Marge Miller. And it came to me earlier in the day, just before I called Sister Shauna, that Sister Marge is holding on till her sons are all there. And uh Brad, her youngest son, is on the on the island, I believe. And I said to Sister Sean, I said, "She is refusing to go. She God has given her such a strong will. She's just such a strong spirited woman. She has held on so steadfastly for those sons. I said she's waiting till they're there. And they just uh they were all together last night and spent the night with her. And it it seems that this morning that her breathing had just became very very weak. And but she was able to speak with the sons and express her love for them. and even in that weakened condition raise her arms out and take them. And I tell you uh uh we've had a wonderful soldier amongst us. &gt;&gt; And uh this kind of faith and if if it would glorify God, I say before this congregation and all who listen, I would not be shocked in I would not be shocked one iota to see her walk through the doors tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God, as Ge as Martha said to Jesus when her h when her brother was still dead in the tomb said, "Even now, &gt;&gt; whatsoever you will ask, it'll be done." We know that. And so, we just know that our Lord Jesus who's amongst us, we want him to make his will perfectly known. And we want to remember Brother Murphy as well. I know that he's on a tiring schedule in China. So, if you'll just bow and we're going to praise before we break open the word. Our dear heavenly father, there's one thing that we can say and I believe that would be in complete unison within the whole congregation. We love you our God. We love you from the depths of our heart. We love your ways and how you call people. And as we sung in the chorus, how you mold us. You are the potter and we love how you how you mold us, Lord. How you deal with us. It's not always the way we intend it to be. It's not always what we thought it would be. And no one can predict how you will work with your people, Lord. Sometimes it looks like it's going backwards when it's going ahead. Oh God, sometimes it looks like it's just a all these reversals, but it's not a reversal. There is no reversal. There is no defeat. There is nothing negative with you. Your plan is moving on. Your church is moving on. The Holy Ghost is moving on. And your people, Lord, are in they're in harmony and in tune with your program. And this morning, Lord, if there would be any here or under the sound of my voice that would be out of touch with you, may they be brought into harmony. May evil, every evil spirit, oh God, be defeated and sent far, oh God, from the doors of this place, from the hearts of the people. We pray, Father, for our sister Marge Miller, that even now, oh God, we know you could raise her out of that bed and bring her, Lord Jesus, to a healthy life and give her some years, Lord, of life if this would be a pleasing thing to you. But we say, "Oh God, not our will, not our thoughts, not our human instinct, but may your name be glorified." We pray. I pray, Father, that her prayers concerning her children and her sons. I pray, Father, that you'll break down every wall, every barrier that hinders them and bring and bend their knees to repentance in the name of Jesus Christ. Holy Spirit, take control. I pray of their minds and of their lives. Uh bring them no peace. Lord, let them not have rest at night. Oh God, let not prosperity come their way until you have dealt with them. Oh God, I pray you will deal with them in a mighty way. Bless sister Shauna and Sister Pat. Lord, strengthen the family. I pray especially sister Shauna and Sister Pat have spent so many days. I pray, oh God, you'll be their companion and be their source of virtue at this time. Oh Lord, we know that you hear us. Our brother Ed Nicaroo is suffering. Oh God, brother Jeff Mitchell with an injury in his back. Oh father and our sister Glenda Lancov. Oh God, we we have the authority to resist these evil things, Lord, and remove this curse from off of them, oh God, that they might have their uh peace and might have their uh their full health restored back to them and all other needs, oh God, wherever they may be represented at this time. And Lord, we're in need. I'm in need. We're standing with a in a few moments with your word in our hands, but only you, the author, can open it. Make it known to us. I pray let be said what you would have said. Bless our brother Dioa amongst us, Father, his congregation at home in Kenshasa. I pray, oh God, you'll bless, oh father, his work, and that it is not his work but your work. prosper the work I pray even more and may the message be sent out with a mighty mighty voice very quickly I pray dear Lord Jesus we say your will be done we want to bless you now worship you in hearing your word in Jesus Christ's name amen &gt;&gt; amen bless you I'm going to read out of Genesis the 49th chapter and we'll look at verses 1 and two. I'm actually going to be speaking, it may not sound like it harmonizes, but I spoke on Wednesday night, fight the good fight of faith. Fight the good fight of faith. And that's what we're going to be continuing on with part two. We were taking Joseph's life because Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus Christ. We do not have much of the early life of Jesus recorded but we have considerable of the life of Joseph and he was a perfect type. Now it goes further than that that Christ that's in us should be expressed with these attributes. It says in verse one of Genesis 49, "And Jacob called unto his sons and said,"Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken unto Israel your father." And he begins then a third verse with Reuben, his firstborn. And I want to go then to the 22nd where he speaks of Joseph. 22nd verse. Joseph is a fruitful bow, even a fruitful bow by a well whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him. But his bow rem abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. From fence is the shepherd the stone of Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us in 1 Timothy 6 and12 Paul saying fight the good fight of faith. lay hold on eternal life where unto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. Amen. You may have your seats. We just discovered, I will review a wee bit of Wednesday, but very little. We discovered that this is a good fight. There are some fights that are good. Most are not good, but there are some that are good. This is an excellent fight. It's a useful fight. It's an admirable fight and it's necessary. Timothy saying, "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course and I've kept the faith." This is a this is a good striving because to fight is to strive. It is not only to strive, but it it could be to labor fervently to enter into a contest. I'm prepared and willing to enter into this contest. I'm prepared to struggle. And that's not what we really, you know, physically in our flesh. We don't really want to struggle or exert ourselves. But this is a this is a worthy cause, friends, that we have today. It's a worthy cause. It's worthy of uh exercising ourselves and and spending our energy, mental energy, our focus, our concentration, whatever it is we do in life or even our physical work, we expend a lot of energy. But if we realize that the real goal of all of this expenditure of my time and my energy and my resources, the goal, my goal beyond that is spiritual &gt;&gt; and that's what's important. So we strive fervently because it's a very worthy struggle that we're in. In first Peter, we read 1 Peter 5:8, "Be sober. Be vigilant because your adversary," See, this is why we have a we're striving. This is this is what the struggle is all about. There isn't one person under the sound of my voice that does not have an adversary. And and we ought to learn something about him because we all have the same adversary. He works different tactics, but he is the same adversary. He is the adversary, the devil. And your adversary, the devil, as a roaring line, walketh about seeking whom he may devour. That is his intent. So, we are in a good fight. We're in an admirable fight. We know who our enemy is, and we have been given the weapon to defeat him. The word is our weapon. The word. Not what I think the word is, but the word. That's why it is so uh essential to stay with it. Be sober. And sober is to be watching. It also is this word in the Greek is very interesting, but it's to be calm and collected. Just to be calm. Uh because your adversary, the devil, is a roaring lion walketh about. So, we want to be sober, to watch, to be calm and collected in spirit. We're not in some kind of a frenzy or some nervous type of of of warfare. We're to be calm and collected in our spirit to be temperate, to be dispassionate and circumspect. Brother Brandham said in in in Melkazedc the great prince he said if he said if we'll approach this subject today real sensibly then he goes on calmly and never be excited. Now it doesn't mean never be happy or never be enthusiastic but never be excited. That nervous excitement that almost agitation faith never gets excited. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith never rushes itself. Faith knows what it's talking about. And so the people, we are children of faith. We don't have to be in some kind of nervous agitation and wonderment and this way and that way and and cast about, you know, and unsettled and nervous. No. Be sober is to be watching, but you're calm and collected in your spirit. In faith, once delivered to the saints, he said, "Every person that's born of the spirit of God that knows the Holy Spirit's in you rests assure God knows his destination and walk calmly before him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be sober. Then he goes on to be vigilant also starting off with its main emphasis to to watch. So if it's be sober, watch, be vigilant, watch. And then they go off into different directions. Be vigilant is to be awake also and give strict attention to be cautious. We're here this morning to be vigilant. &gt;&gt; But when we go out from here, we even need to be more vigilant, watching, be cautious, &gt;&gt; be active, and take heed lest through remission and indolence or indolences to be apathetic, to be lethargic, to be idle, to be lazy. lest we through this kind of a a a sluggishness, some destructive calamity suddenly overtakes us. We haven't got any uh reason with the message that we hold. We must not slack off at any point. &gt;&gt; This thing that God has done amongst you young people, I'll urge you one thing. This is some good solid teaching for you. Don't slack off. That's exactly the spirit that Satan wants that kind of attitude, that kind of atmosphere so he can work in that. Don't don't become sluggish. Don't become lazy with your spiritual life. And that's good for all of us. &gt;&gt; To be vigilant is to be roused from wake for your adversary, the devil. And now here's interesting. I'm just laying a foundation here. your adversary. Adversary is your opponent. You have an opponent that you're struggling with. An opponent may be one who's in a in a in a suit of law. They can come against you because it has a judicial reference, can be an enemy, but your opponent. and uh your adversary. The adversary is actually made up of of of a couple of words in the Greek. I'm laying all this in as a foundation because first it is anti. And we know what anti is. That's in opposition to anti is over or against opposite to. Your adversary is opposite to what you believe. Your adversary is against your witness. &gt;&gt; Your adversary is an opponent to what you want to live. &gt;&gt; You have that. That's just the first part of it. He's he's your opponent. He's your enemy and he's against it. May be expressed in different ways, but he's against what you believe and hold precious. What you hold precious, he wants to trample underfoot. &gt;&gt; That's your adversary. He's he he's anti or he's opposite to what you believe in. And then secondly, it comes from a second word. I won't bother going into it, but there's a there's a certain uh a judgment that it's an anti-judgment or an anti-position which makes it a decision. It's an anti-decision to your decision. You know, you have a decision and say, "I'm going to do this for God." And then all kinds of things come in that are opposing what you really feel you should be doing or feel what you should be saying. You You could be sitting in a church. You could be sitting in this meeting and perhaps God has been dealing with you and really deep down, you know, well, I'm just giving you an example now. I should I I I ought to really surrender that up or I ought to really do that or I ought to really go to that person or I ought to you know whatever you think whatever the Holy Spirit whatever the Holy Spirit is initiating our opponent is against it. &gt;&gt; He's anti. He's opposing it. And not only does he oppose it, but now it comes in with the second part of this adversarial work. And that is that he he he comes with a judicial he'll come with a decision. He'll come weighing the thing out like it would be held in a court of law and things are debated and weighed out. And then he'll come with with all the reasons why you should not do what God is telling you to do. &gt;&gt; There'll be another time. There'll be a more opportune time. This isn't just working right just now. He's got all kinds of reasons. What is he doing? He's actually instructing you in opposition to what the Holy Spirit is telling you to do. &gt;&gt; And that's what adversary is. I want to go into that quite deeply. It's a judicial decision es especially of condemnation. It's an execution of a sentence. Uh it it it is it is to show or he gives reason to give evidence or proof of a thing and to show by words or to teach. I want to go over that slowly. An adversary, his whole intent, his whole purpose is to be and you have this adversary. God's word said so. You have this adversary, your adversary, the devil. So now what's he going to do? He's going to be in opposition. &gt;&gt; He's not merely going to be in opposition. He's going to give you reason why he's right. &gt;&gt; He's going to weigh out, well, yeah, you know, you feel to do this and you know, yeah, maybe that's the Holy Spirit is dealing you, but there's this reason and there's that reason. or there's the family or there's the job or there's this or there's something else and I have all these other reasons and he's actually working you into he's working you he's teaching you in another direction &gt;&gt; oh yes I know God's word says this regarding baptism how many people how many trinitarians for example how many people have been baptized in the titles have sat under the sound of the gospel and heard clearly from the word of God that that baptism clearly is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And there wasn't one person between the covers of the book that I ever been baptized any other way. And you cannot tell me that the Holy Spirit does not witness in their heart that that is the truth. &gt;&gt; But the opponent, the adversary comes in immediately and begins to reason. And really what he's doing, he's teach he's teaching them. And that's really what this finally comes down to is that he's teaching them in opposition to what the word is. &gt;&gt; It's to show or to give evidence. That's what happens in a court case. An adversary or the opponent, you have the plaintiff and the defendant, and each are giving their case. Each are stating their case before a judge. Well, I can tell you that the judge has already declared his truth right here. &gt;&gt; But he wants to be a teacher to show by words or to teach. Now, in Exodus 4:12, I'm just going to read a verse. He said, "Now therefore, go," God speaking to Moses, "go, and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee. I am going to teach you what you shall say. And then in Exodus 4:15, it goes on, "And then thou shalt speak unto him uh and and and put words in his mouth." I believe this was now to Aaron. And I will be with thy mouth and be with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do. I am going to teach you. I'm going to be your teacher. I'm going to be your instructor. Did he have Did he have an adversary? Did he ever? He had many adversaries from within and from without. But God's word still could ne would always prevail. There's no way for God's word and God's program to fail. &gt;&gt; I'm going to teach you now. teach in the Hebrew has a very very interesting and very wonderful in fact I'm having a wonderful experience right now because I just chose these last scriptures for a text that I was going to read today. I had some other scriptures but I decided to read out of Genesis 49 and how the scripture says that uh that the archers have sorely grieved him. This was Joseph but his bow abode in strength. The word teach in the Hebrew is a a simple word. It's it's yah. Yah, which is to shoot to shoot arrows. God says, now you have to think about that for a moment. God says, "I'm going to teach you literally, I'm going to shoot this like an arrow into your heart. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to penetrate. There's nothing going to stop the arrow of God. I'm going to pull my bow back and I'm going to teach you. Yah. I'm going to penetrate into the very deepest resource regardless of what I'm going to go beyond your reasoning. I'm going to go beyond your circumstance. My word is going to anchor in your heart and you will not be able to escape it because it'll be revealed to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you not be thankful this morning? Say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; God's word has been anchored in my heart. Circumstances have tried to tear it out. Friends tried to tear it out. My associates tried to tear it out. My family tried to tear it out. But nobody could remove it out from me. &gt;&gt; God had anchored it in my heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will teach you to show to direct and teach and instruct. Moses is now in the 24th chapter it says 12th verse. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Come to me into the mountain and be there, and I will give thee tables of stone and a law and commandments which I have which I have written that thou mayest teach them." Now, it isn't only God going to teach Moses, but now Moses going to teach the people. &gt;&gt; And the method remains the same. &gt;&gt; It's still God's arrow. Hallelujah. It's God's bowl. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to be the one that's going to energize this truth &gt;&gt; and it's going to go through you now as a vessel, but it's going to go into the hearts of the people. The same pillar of fire, the same pillar of fire that spoke that God used to speak through to Moses in the prophets in the message principles of divine healing. He said, "It's been a long time, my dear friends, here in Jefferson, Jeffersonville, probably no doubt at all, but a few years ago, that some of the people thought I'd mentally slipped when I begin to speak of speak of God being the same yesterday, today, and forever." Things that people said people thought that he began to mentally slip. He says, "In my heart." This is when he in his early ministry. But he said, "But in my heart there was something that anchored there that I could not get away from." &gt;&gt; God said to Moses, "I am going to teach you &gt;&gt; and then you will teach the people." Here in the very early years, Dr. Davis, the man who ordained the prophet, said, "You need to get next to yourself, Billy. You gone off the deep end getting into all of these all angels speaking to you and all of these things." But he said, "He was anchored there forever. &gt;&gt; I couldn't get away from it." Why? Because God had taught it. &gt;&gt; That that was the supernatural. It'd be like saying to Joseph, "Joseph," his brothers tried to tell him, "All your dreams, your dreams about the our sheavs, bowing down to yours, you young strippling daddy's little favorite boy with your little colored coat. Get out of here." That's what he heard. And the Bible says they couldn't speak peaceibly to him. That was every day. Couldn't speak peaceibly. He had that every day that just nattering, that feeling, that attitude. All the older brothers and not only not only just didn't like him, hated him. &gt;&gt; Hated him. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't get rid of it. He couldn't get rid of it. Why' they say? Because he couldn't help it. It was in him. That was a spiritual part. That spiritual part that God does is divine. You can have all the harassment. You can have all the opposition. You can have all the criticism. You can have whatever you want. But you can never move it because that spiritual part come is divine. It come from God. And what come from God happens to be, my friends, eternal. &gt;&gt; Eternal. &gt;&gt; I've had people try to tell me all kinds of things. They might as well talk to a telephone pole. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not me that's stubborn. &gt;&gt; It's not that. It has nothing to do with the human will. It has to do, can you imagine that it's still Satan that raises himself up to use his instrument to try to attack the very divine thing that God has done in an individual life. &gt;&gt; And you can always tell God God's things because they're clean, &gt;&gt; they're holy, &gt;&gt; they're righteous. It's in harmony with the word of God. You know that it's spiritual. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now to teach, he said something had anchored there that I could not get away from and I know that someday God would give me the privilege to prove that it was right because it was the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the unpardonable sin, he said, "I've seen 23 years now of leading by the Holy Spirit to yield myself to him and not pay any attention to what nothing says." Just imagine people could look at that uh and actually see that gift demonstrate itself and try and speak against it. &gt;&gt; Satan's brazen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is he brazen? &gt;&gt; And we're just starting on that. He said uh he said it's it's put a something in my heart that's anchored there and I didn't put it in myself. This isn't something that we learned or just got educated into. But God, the Holy Ghost, he said, put it there. A scripture that is used frequently in the message. Whom shall we whom shall he teach knowledge? And whom shall he make to understand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast? For precept must be upon precept, and line upon line, line upon line, here a little, and there a little. For with stammering lips, and another tongue will I speak to this people. And to whom he said, this is the rest, wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest, and this is the refreshing, yet they would not come. Here God is offering them the very uh the very thing that their soul cries out for but and yet they would not come. Line upon line and precept upon precept. He said who will we teach? Who shall he teach knowledge? And then uh it it says in John Jesus speaking of the Holy Spirit, but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost when whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you. And in Timothy, it says first 2 Timothy 2:2, "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also." So you see the process is God speaks to his appointed servant. God to Moses. God spoke to Paul. Jesus spoke to the disciples. And he chose certain disciples. That's that's just the way he works. And God, whether the people want to accept it or not, he called one man in this generation. Only one had that kind of vindication. The the the vindication was simply to identify the vessel that God was going to teach. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall I say that again? The vindication and all the supernatural was to attract the eyes of the people so that they could focus and see the one vessel that God was using in that capacity because that was the one that God was going to teach. &gt;&gt; That was the supernatural divine aspect of God. And that's why I said as I repeated on on Wednesday, he said, "I couldn't do anything about it. I can't do anything about that because the very he he he'd be standing there in front of a person and the pillar of fire would move from there and go out over the congregation and rest over another person and he'd have he'd have to go over there. Who who is that? That's God teaching him. It's not him, it's her." &gt;&gt; How else would he know that kind of instruction? And so that's what he was depending on all the time. He was depending on that pillar of fire when the seals were being made known. He was depending on that. He said, "I'd have been I'd have made such a horrible mistake if he hadn't come." He said, "That pillar of fire hanging there for for all those hours about 8 hours. What what what was it?" It was God teaching him so then that he could teach us and he could teach the ministry. And he goes on to say in the smian church age in every age we have exactly notice the same pattern. &gt;&gt; I'd like the congregation to say it same pattern. It's not some other some other guy's idea. &gt;&gt; It's not what the it's not what the uh theological school or anyone else or any preacher anything else. It's the same pattern. He said, "And that is why the light comes through this through some God-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught." Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; That that is the pattern. &gt;&gt; It's not that the prophet simply delivers it to the sheep and then all the sheep start teaching themselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or teaching one another. &gt;&gt; It's that God sends his message to his Moses or his messenger or his prophet and from there it is given to the ministers. &gt;&gt; And the ministers are also to take the same word and teach the people under that same uncction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I thank God this morning for that same Holy Spirit. I thank God for its testimony here in this congregation. I thank God for its testimony around the world. I thank God that I could go and visit brother Dio's work and see that mighty thing that God had done in the Congo and stand there in in a humble state and say, "Oh God, this work is of you." &gt;&gt; No man, no system, no other program could do this. Hallelujah. Why doesn't the congregation rejoice over God's work? Why aren't you thankful? I'm sure you are. Express it. How wonderful it is that a god could come down and United Nations call it the poorest nation on earth. But in my assessment, it was it's the richest nation on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Rich in spiritual resource. I would love to be able to have the testimony and say here in the Pacific Northwest, we've sent out 5 million books in the in 205. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. I'd love to be able to say I'd love to be able to say we're able to achieve that. No, that wasn't God's choosing. God took people who were of of a poor estate. God took people where they had almost 100% unemployment. God took people and he just does it like he delivered Israel when they didn't have guns and weapons and anything else. God does things so that it's evident I'm doing it. Hallelujah. There's no room for any flesh to glory. God does it. Hallelujah. I rejoice today. I love it when God does it. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful if God just sets out and says, "Okay, Coil, you can have a little peace. You can just have a little part of this, but I'm the one that's doing it. I'll take your little gift and I'll I'll expand it. I'll take your little handful, your little offering or whatever, and I'll send it out to multitudes. Oh God, multiply our little loav, multiply our little fishes. Hallelujah. Fill the baskets full. Feed the hungry people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he gives it to the messenger and the messenger spreads it through the ministry to the others who have been faithfully taught. Tell you friends, this isn't something you just drop down pour out of a can. This is when people wait on God. I've been around a lot of churches and ministers and I I I have to say publicly my heart has been heavy and grieved some time because I've known that the minister doesn't seem in at least by my assessment to spend much time with the word or much time in the message. But if you're going to have a people that's faithfully taught or a minister that's faithfully taught, he's got to give himself and let the Holy Spirit teach him. Teach. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't got that spiritual part that's been deposited there for that gift and for that calling, you can never receive that instruction the same way. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing. Yes. &gt;&gt; Joseph's brothers all may have had dreams, but none of them were recorded in the word of God. &gt;&gt; No doubt they dreamed, but none of them were recorded because his dream was a spiritual dream. &gt;&gt; His work was a spiritual work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not saying the people don't have spiritual things. I think you understand me. But brother Brandham says this is the pattern. &gt;&gt; That's the pattern. There is no other pattern. Never has been another pattern. That is the pattern. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan's kingdom is full of teaching, teaching spirits. Satan's kingdom is full of teachers. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. How brazen. And this pattern never changes. How brazen. &gt;&gt; Satan himself, that spirit. I say, hell is full of instructors. &gt;&gt; Full of instructors. &gt;&gt; How brazen that that fallen archangel could come to the very word himself and try to teach him what the scripture meant. and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. He attempts to teach the word to the word in flesh himself. and the adversary, that one that has the least or even zero qualifications. &gt;&gt; Zero qualifications. What was his qualifications? There he is standing. What is his qualifications? Zero. no qualifications whatsoever to start to instruct, to start to teach, but he wants to now remember the adversary wants to penetrate and put it in your heart and they have things that are anti in opposition to what God obviously has done &gt;&gt; even to the point it'll start to deny the work that's happened in your own life. I've seen it at work. I've seen it at work. I'll describe it so he can pick it up sometime. There's a minister came by through here, minister of the message. And it was kind of off on a certain grand revelation. One of the first things they need to do is destabilize the person they're talking to. Cuz here the here's the individual and they're feeling, you know, they have a sense of assurance and confidence and they're just moving on in God. When Satan comes in, the adversary, your adversary always comes in first thing first thing is a a word that tries to destabilize. &gt;&gt; He looked at a brother uh looked at a brother and I happened to be standing by. He said kind of it was the whole at attitude, the whole atmosphere. It was intimidating atmosphere and the and the whole expression was intimidating. Just looked at him said, "Do you have the Holy Ghost?" Well, the brother u Well, yeah, the answer to that is I most certainly do. Do you have it? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the answer. But that just that intimidating way because behind that if you could just get him to destabilized a wee bit, you know, then he come in and said, "Well, I have the answer for it. I got the real way that, you know, I got I got a special doctrine and this will really settle you." He was already settled before he tried to unsettle him. &gt;&gt; See that? That is that's just how brazen they are. come right up and you're all you're you're walking in the light and walking in faith and walking in trust and walking confidence and right away there's a a try to destabilize. That's exactly what he tried to do. If thou art the son of God, &gt;&gt; make these stones bread. &gt;&gt; If you're the son of God, try to destabilize them and question his office. He didn't say that there is no son of God. He was just saying if you think you're that, do you really think that you're bride? You think you're bride? You think you're born again? You think, "Oh, that's him. That's his pattern." &gt;&gt; Always his pattern. &gt;&gt; What does the What does the adversary, the devil do? And what is his nature or his character? I'm going to give you brother Brham's complete what I think is a marvelous answer. Marvelous answer. Remember you have this adversary. Taking sides with Jesus. He said, "But Jesus," now you see this is a pattern. If and if he used that pattern here, he use it all the time. He said, "But Jesus, they just tried to find every little shadow that they could find to try to belittle him." &gt;&gt; Still do. &gt;&gt; In the sight of the people, to try to belittle him in the sight of the people. And that's what the devil wants. They want to hurt your influence before the people. I tell you what, I have seen I've seen his tactics and I hear I I hear it all the time about the message about the messenger and he and he uses the same tactics within the congregation within the message. He'll use exactly the same tactics. It absolutely staggers my imagination how intelligent so-called people can take 33 years of ministry of the most unusual profound ministry that the world has ever seen and just dis and and just remove it from you know their conscious thought by just a word or two say, "Oh, well, he went off in the end. &gt;&gt; He went off in the end." Excuse me. That one sentence does it for 33 years of ministry. Can what what about what does the word say? What is what is what does the scripture say? I said, well, uh, in fact is strange. is hard for me to say, but someone that I love very, very deeply and one who helped me in the ministry, made a special trip to my house and sat on my sofa with me, just the two of us. And he came with a purpose in his mind. Was he evil? No. He loved me. He thought he was going to do the right thing. And he said, I want to ask you a question. He said, "Why do you think Brother Brandham was killed in a car accident?" You see, I'll just stop there now. That as much as I love that brother, I love him with everything I have. As much as I loved him, was he godly? A very godly man. Did he have the revelation of the message? No. But I recognized right away that that statement came to destabilize me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And out from my mouth shot an answer before I had even thought. I said, "For the same reason John the Baptist had his head cut off." &gt;&gt; And I was I was in a state of awe myself that I had said that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And my brother, my precious brother, opened his mouth, but there was no air that came out, &gt;&gt; much less words. Nothing came out. &gt;&gt; And then I felt the strength and the surge of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And I said, called him by name. I said, "My family here, they're in another part of the house. I said I love them more than I love my own life. I said I have committed them, my children and my wife to this message and nothing can change that. And that was our last conversation. Did we become enemies? Not a bit. We were as dear friends as could be right to the end of his life. You see friends, that is how Satan works. And you have to know that that's how he works because you have that adversary. That adversary will come your way at some time or another. And don't forget, I'm going to give you a title for him. He's a teacher. &gt;&gt; He's a teacher. &gt;&gt; He's going to try to take the word and instruct you. &gt;&gt; And instruct you in something that is anti to what you have received, to what you believe, to what you hold dear. your friendship, your fellowship, your church, your pastor, your deacons, whatever more. He'll be anti maybe with with the situation. You young people, he will be anti. You've been brought up and you've been raised in a certain way and you'll get things that kind of destabilize you and and and start to put distance between you and your godly parents. Shoot it down. Deny the thing right there. Give no ear to it whatsoever. That enemy is a teacher. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he'll belittle. He'll belittle and try to hinder the influence. They want to hurt the influence before the people. And that's the way you want to watch. He said, "Careful." That's what the scripture says, be sober, be vigilant. And he says, "Walk like real men of God. Talk like men of God. Act like men of God. Live like men of God." I wonder if I could say those again and have you say amen if you believe it. He said, "Walk like real men of God &gt;&gt; and talk like men of God and act like men of God and live like men of God." He said, "Because the devil, your adversary, is going about like a roaring lion trying to devour what he can." But that's his system. That's how he works. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And what did they uh why did they do this? They were jealous of him." &gt;&gt; Why do people take the position they do of the messenger? Because they were jealous of that ministry. And you see any man that tries to do something for God, I'm not going to play games, friends. We got a man sitting on the platform and I tell you what, they have flown across oceans. They have sent men have done all kinds of things to try to destroy uh brother Dio's influence. &gt;&gt; I've heard the word come back to me said a certain brother said he's going to destroy your influence everywhere or anywhere he can in the world. &gt;&gt; What do you do with it? Just go on. &gt;&gt; Just say let God be the witness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If he be true, &gt;&gt; if that be true and my influence needs to be destroyed by God's will, so be it. &gt;&gt; Because it's not going to doesn't amount to any. I want God's will. &gt;&gt; You want God's will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love the attitude a prophet gave. He said, you know, if there is no heaven and if there is nothing, if I if I'm not going to uh if I'm not even going to attain to heaven and I'm going to be cast to hell, he said to me personally, he said he said, "If I get to crawl up on my hands and knees to his feet, Brother Eddie, and he kicks me over into hell," he said, "I'll still look up and say, "I love you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I wondered why he said that to me, but I learned a great secret. What what what attit what what what kind of thing can the devil do to that kind of attitude? &gt;&gt; Here's a man says I love him even if he kicks me over into hell. It's not I got to have this, I got to have this and give me this and give me that. He says, I'm going to live this anyway. I read it just the other day. I'm going to live this anyway. &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to you? reaching down to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they were jealous of him. That's that was what's the reason they tried to belittle him. They were jealous of his ministry and that's the reason they were trying to belittle. He goes on, but he had the ministry of God and they knew that. But it was contrary to their creeds. So they were trying to belittle him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Wednesday, it was really special for me to have that little segment of tape that God used to speak to our brother David Laws and to have him up. I'm sure it had some spec it was special for you. &gt;&gt; But I didn't tell you this. I went to my I was looking for another tape and I was just on a different uh kind of a thought a theme and I have about almost a thousand tapes in in my closet there all set out in the years and just as I opened the door I opened the double doors of the cabinet and I was just scanning uh in the area of of the time that I thought the message I was wanting would be and my eyes just fell on uh fell on a a tape and it I just happened to scan the title cuz I'm just whole hundreds of titles in front of me and it it says u Christ identified the same in all generations and I thought you know he's he's had similar ones before but that was just worded different and I thought that's just different and then I kept on scanning and I thought you know that was worded different I went and looked at it again and read it and I thought Christ identified the same in all generations. Well, that I don't remember hearing that, you know, and uh at least not recently. And so I just kept on looking and I I thought, well, I was just having to go someplace in the car, so I thought I'm just going to take that. And I take that and when I get brother Brandham starts laying out the ministry, the prophetic ministry. And while he's going through it, I hadn't heard him. If you want to hear it, he na he nails that down so tight, there's no place to move. And I thought, ooh, he he would said, "I'm so happy to be in Tampa, Florida, and it's my first time here." And always wanted to come down be with you grand people. And he goes on like that. And then he starts laying out the ministry. He takes every scripture. And he takes the condition of the age, just takes every one. And I thought, "Ooh, is he ever is he ever getting them ready for something? He's nailing this down so tight. I just know." And they were so quiet. Oh, they were so quiet, you know, and uh he's amongst all the Pentecostal Assemblies of God people and so on. I thought it just to me, you know, as a believer, you just know that the Lord's coming in with a punch, a double knockout punch. And he comes at the end, he says, "Let let's just call some people." So, he calls uh 10 people and uh what number will we call? and he starts with A1 to 10 and he can't find A1 and you know and I'm I'm sitting there listening I think you know this is you know there's almost spending so much time where's A1 and so on so forth when you think that kind of ministry for me I just like to get on with it you know and uh so he gets the 10 people up and they're there and while he's in the midst of dealing with these 10 you know and he goes down into the audience and how many here don't have prayer cards oh yes there's many you know and you you know that you're stranger to me. We don't know each other and so on. And after a little while, you know, he calls this one out and calls that one out. And I thought, and now the people, of course, the people are responding. And while I was listening to that, just like the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, "Now, when Jesus did that to the woman at the well, she didn't have a a great emotional, you know, uh, release when he began to reveal the secret of her heart. That is when she got it." These people were dead quiet. But then when he began to manifest it, then they went into rejoicing. When when when Jesus revealed the secret of her heart, she felt silent. &gt;&gt; She recognized, "You must be a prophet here. He's doing it and they're not getting it." And I thought, "They're not getting it. &gt;&gt; They're not getting it. What the woman at the well got, they're not getting. &gt;&gt; And that's why they couldn't go to the next step because they didn't get that one." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm just listening on and finally I hear him call out and say, "There's a man sitting down there in a a white shirt. You need a job and you need the Holy Ghost and you need a job, too." And I thought, "There it is." And I've been searching for that one. Been searching for where God had called our our brother David Laws out. And and there it was right on that tape. But I didn't want to tell you on Wednesday. I didn't have the time to tell you how it was so supernatural that I had come to it. And I was actually looking for another one was directed to that one. &gt;&gt; And then I called Sister Violet and I called uh Brother David a little bit later. They couldn't remember exactly the title, but when I began to uh you notice when I had brother David up here, he actually was saying the words while it was being said because they remembered so well. You know, the supernatural part of God that's eternal. &gt;&gt; There's no time. There's no limit on it. And it's the supernatural part that they were jealous over the supernatural thing. I want to say to you, you wouldn't be sitting here today if God had not done a supernatural work in your life. &gt;&gt; When I look across this congregation and just go back a few years in your life, I remember it all very well. And I my mind is just filled with uh not testimony. It's not testimony. People say it's testimony. My mind is just filled with a supernatural God doing supernatural things, taking children out of the very depths of darkness and confusion, out of their terrible state, some religious, some in despair, some in the world, some in snared in terrible situations, and God just deliver them in a moment. I want to say today publicly, our God's a great God. &gt;&gt; And he has done supernatural things. &gt;&gt; And that supernatural thing is an eternal thing. &gt;&gt; That's not for time. It's eternal. &gt;&gt; And that's what God is continuing to build on is that supernatural &gt;&gt; work. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let me just carry on. God promised Israel that if they would obey the voice of his angel, then he would be then he would be an adversary to their adversary. I want to announce to you as a congregation and all that are hearing my voice in this day particularly I want God to be an adversary to my adversary. &gt;&gt; I want him. And in the Old Testament, it has a slightly different meaning, but it is that God would bind my adversary, that God would put my adversary, who's here contending with me and contending with you, I want to announce to you, God will bind that adversary. &gt;&gt; He will distress him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word means and God gave uh God gave some commandment and listen I want to I want you to catch listen this whole congregation please carefully. He said through Moses he said behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared. I want to stop there. He has sent his angel before them. That angel of the Lord, that same angel of the Lord has been with God's people from all time. That same angel, he manifested himself in a very special way to a generation that was given over to technology. He allowed his picture to be taken not only in America, in Germany or at Switzerland. In Germany for sure and you can see it coming down from the ceiling. They shot it with the camera several times. It's not just a a double exposure, which they try to say this one was it it had. And of course, George E. Lacy proved it wasn't, but they actually shot it several times coming down from the ceiling and going back up. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord, the pillar of fire. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And he said that, "Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way." That's number one. He's assigned to keep you in the way. &gt;&gt; Why keep you in the way? Because you've got an opponent. You've got an adversary that's trying to bump you off the trail, &gt;&gt; trying to distract you from the main purpose. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To get us on another agenda. He's so subtle. &gt;&gt; He'll try to get natural things to mean more than spiritual things. try to get all kinds of pressures upon you so that your life and the supernatural part of your life. Oh, I want to make that your focus. I don't care how busy you are. I don't care about those things. That's not the part of it. Or what kind of work you do or what kind of profession you have and and what you aim to do in your future life, young people. But the main thing is if you don't have your spiritual, the thing that God did for you spiritually as your main focus, you're going to miss out. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; On the rich things of God. &gt;&gt; I've sent my angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. I go to prepare a place for you. This angel of the Lord has been commissioned to take us to the place that's been prepared for us. We don't have a physical land. We don't have a land of Israel to that. that we're going to be gathered to. We only have one land. And I'm going to ask you, friends, when this short life is over and it's a reality to us today, one of our own people is perhaps moments away, moments away or an hour or two away from crossing over to that land. Is it real or isn't it real? Is it a real place? &gt;&gt; And you're going to end at that door someday, young people. You're going to end there either sooner or later, but you're going to end there unless the rapture takes you ahead of time, but you're going to end there. You want to know that you've made that your focus, that you made that spiritual thing that God did in your in your heart and life, that's your focus. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan ever take it away and make it second place for you. &gt;&gt; And he said, beware of him and obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, listen, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversary. If you'll hear this angel, if you'll hear this voice, then I will be an enemy to your enemy. and I'll be an adversary to your adversary. I say, God, let me stand right in that place. I want you to take my adversary and bind him. &gt;&gt; I want you to hinder his way. &gt;&gt; I want you to steal his voice. &gt;&gt; And the yah, the scripture is that I he I'll put him in distress. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Rather than you be in distress, why not you be in joy and have him in distress? &gt;&gt; I'll put him in distress. &gt;&gt; If you'll just hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Follow this pattern. I'm going to teach Moses. Moses going to teach the Aaron, the Levites. They're going to teach the people the ministry. It's responsibility. I'll tell you what, friends. You don't know what it is. the kind of pressure and the kind of responsibility that it is to wait on God and seek to have the word of God for the people on at at a given meeting. It's a great burden, a great responsibility. And I seek to discharge it with all the sincerity of my heart because you need to be able to go out of here and be guided because I I recognize this morning you have an adversary. You have an opponent. You have an enemy. is anti to what God has for you. &gt;&gt; God wants to prosper you. He'll bring you to drought. God wants to pour water upon your life. He wants to bring you to a famine and a dry time. I say, "Deny him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hear the voice of the angel of God &gt;&gt; and you'll have good success. The angel of the Lord has confirmed the supernatural element of this message. Listen, without the supernatural element, I'm belaboring these points a wee bit, but stay with me, please. Without the supernatural element, the supernatural, as I said Wednesday, is the element. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses couldn't help it that there was a burning bush. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't help it. Paul couldn't help it that he wasn't following Jesus in the flesh, but he couldn't help it that the revelation of God came to him. He couldn't help it that God gave him that position. That supernatural one day when something struck you, you couldn't help it. Look at you young people here at this last camp. We've had camp for 20 years. We've had uh a number always gets really stirred and moved. And there's people here that are now married and got families that could say it was at a certain camp maybe 20 years ago, 15 years ago at a certain camp. Maybe it was a certain service. It's not just always camp, but there was a a breeze that began to something of God, something divine &gt;&gt; that begin to happen. &gt;&gt; I want to glorify that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you young men, you could in no wise deliver yourself &gt;&gt; from what you were in. &gt;&gt; And if God had told me uh 3 months before that in another 6 months, these men are going to be delivered. These young women are going to be sitting here. They're not they're not going to be a concern. They're going to be a concern to the devil. &gt;&gt; They're going to be sitting there. I'm going to deliver them. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do this thing. I' I'd have been I I'd have had a hard time believing you. So when God did it, it startled me. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, you want to give God all the glory. &gt;&gt; You want to keep uh want to keep moving everything forward in that direction. &gt;&gt; I say continue to listen to that voice, &gt;&gt; that thing that spoke to you, &gt;&gt; that thing that moved you. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is you say, "Well, what do you do when you get discouraged?" you just go go for a walk, go in your room and go back to that moment and say, "I know that was you. &gt;&gt; I know that was you that spoke to me, God. I know that was you that talked to me, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to thank you for that moment. &gt;&gt; I don't feel it now, but I thank you for that moment because that was a supernatural thing, and that is you." Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll find that same God will come back and honor &gt;&gt; that moment with you. &gt;&gt; Take the supernatural out of this message. If you take the supernatural element out of this message, all you have is a bunch of doctrines. just quickly. I don't want to bore you, but here's the title of a number of messages, and I have something I want to get to you before I close. In the message, Moses commission. Brother Bram says, "If thou will indeed obey his voice," he's reading this scripture. "If thou will indeed obey his voice, do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to thine enemy, an adversary to thy adversaries. For my angel shall go before thee, gifts and callings without without repentance. But if thou intend indeed obey his voice, do all that I speak, then I'll be an enemy to thine enemies, an adversary to thy adversary. For my angel shall go before thee. Obey the voice of the angel. But if thou will indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak, then I'll be an enemy to thine enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries, for mine angel shall go before thee. Manifestation of the spirit. But if thou wilt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries. For my angels shall go before thee. My angel shall go before thee. That message. And if thou will be indeed obey his voice and to all that I speak, then I'll be an enemy to thine enemies and an adversary to thy adversary. For my angel shall go before thee in the message of pillar of fire. But if thou indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak, then I'll be an enemy to thine enemy and an adversary to thy adversary. For my angel shall go before thee. Friends, &gt;&gt; I haven't gone halfway through them. Do you think for a moment? Will you seriously ponder that this messenger was going back to that and and recalling before the people and before God? I have. He had all kinds of critics and enemy out there, adversaries that he was trusting in. What was he trusting in the supernatural part? &gt;&gt; It was God that sent the angel. It was God that pillar of fire that came down. That was God. He's spinning his confidence back there. You did that. &gt;&gt; Joseph when he got to Egypt. Joseph when he was sold. Joseph when he was in Piper's house, Joseph when Piper's wife tried to seduce him and and left his coat in her hand and because of that he gets thrown into prison. He could have been saying all the time, all I know is I dreamed a dream. All I know is I dreamed a dream and I saw I saw 11 chiefs fall down and bow before me. All I know is I saw the stars 11 stars and the sun and the moon. I saw that he could only go back and that my brother, my sister, he never got any animosity. He never got any bitterness. I get so sick and tired of people have one little flaw, one little thing happen in life and they just grind on that and grind till they get better. I say grow up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Grow up in the name of the Lord. How in the world are is that thing so important that we're going to let our spiritual life just be dried up out of us? I say forget the thing. Hallelujah. Someone did you wrong? Forgive him. Forget it. Somebody's owe you money. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, how can I forget it? If you don't, you'll dry up. I say I sooner stay prosperous and in my spiritual life and have a have a a clear face before God almighty. And Joseph I Joseph's a wonderful example. &gt;&gt; A wonderful example. He is the example of Jesus Christ and he's our example because we want to be like him. And that's why I've been saying we don't have a lot of record of Jesus in his early life but we have it in Joseph and he never had. Just think of it friends. His very dream that the people hated was the very thing that was going to save them. &gt;&gt; And you have a testimony. You have a life in God. You have something and people don't understand it. Maybe family don't understand it. But let it be known to you that you actually possess. And the spiritual supernatural thing that God has done in you is their very salvation. Hallelujah. It's their very salvation. And it took years for it to happen. But he just kept going on day after day and year after year. He was forgotten in jail, in prison, and had to spend two years there &gt;&gt; because a woman tried to seduce him and got misunderstood and his his master was wroth with him. And then the butler and the baker and the butler forgets him. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they and continually he has that supernatural thing still leading him on. But he's but but look his condition. Look his estate. &gt;&gt; You weren't in you weren't in his prison. You haven't had that kind of reversal. That was Christ in Joseph. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't have any right to have the feelings we have. &gt;&gt; Absolutely none whatsoever. He just kept a pure spirit before God. Hallelujah. He kept a pure spirit before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't put his own self forward. He just had such a pure spirit. No wonder Brother Brandon read about Joseph, began to weep and went into his closet and said, "Oh, God, I'd so thank you that you sent a man by the name of Joseph by my way and was inspired to call his son Joseph when he when he would be born." What a thing it was. And then he gets gets hauled out of the prison. Save yourself. And he goes before Pharaoh now. Not Piper, but Pharaoh. And tells him, you're going to have seven years of plenty, seven years of famine. You need to store everything up, and you need to do it this way. What's he doing? He is teaching Pharaoh how to run the country. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. &gt;&gt; He's actually teaching him. And he got taught because he had a supernatural part of him &gt;&gt; given to him. &gt;&gt; And they that mocked him said, "Oh, he's a dreamer." The very dream that saved nations, &gt;&gt; that very ability. &gt;&gt; But he never once. And then his brothers come and he sees the vision fulfilled and he sees them bowing before him with their faces right to the ground. There was not one twinge in him. I told you so. &gt;&gt; Before you put me in the pit, I told you so. There wasn't that at all. There wasn't one twinge, not one twinge of of of gratitude in his heart. Well, finally it happened. We're so given over to these kind of fleshly attitudes. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, God, wash it away from us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then they start to weep and oh, this is Joseph now the recompense comes. No, no, no. He said God did this. This is God. God. He saw God in it all. God did this &gt;&gt; to preserve life. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a marvelous, &gt;&gt; marvelous character. What a marvelous attitude. I would say that supernatural aspect of his life is what taught him, guided him and preserved the life of his people. Hallelujah. I'm just going to close with this little thought. It's not really a little thought. I'd like to spend some time on it. But there is a you know there's a characteristic and that's why I can I can go to Joseph's early life and then just bring it right up to today. But in the very first part of his life, before he's gone into Egypt, before he's gone and been sold and so on, he's already hated as a favored son. He's hated and the and the Bible says his brethren cannot speak peaceibly. So that's the condition. He's he's in such a difficulty with his family, with his brothers and and and the thing you can see there's such hostility. Now I remember all of us. He had 11 against him with such hostility. And his father calls him says, "Joseph, I want you to go to your brethren." What he's doing, he says, "I want you to send I want to send you up to these fellas that hate you." He doesn't put it in those words, but I want you to go to your brethren and they're tending the sheep and tending the flocks and go and see them and see how they're fairing and and come and let me know. And Joseph said something that I would like to superimpose upon the hearts and souls of the people this morning. He said these three words. Here am I. That that attitude never left Joseph. &gt;&gt; Wherever wherever life led him, he just kept saying as it were in that attitude, here am I. &gt;&gt; You're being elevated. You're over Piper's house. Here am I. You're a man of distinction, a man of prosperity. Everything's prospering under you. Says, "Here am I." In a few days, he's in prison. Here am I. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, in adversity, here am I. And then come to the very apex of his life under Pharaoh. It was still just here am I? He was never moved off of that. And then his brethren coming and finally his father. And this to me is a very outstanding. None of us can imagine because we have never been put in that position and never will be when he is next to the pharaoh in such wealth and such power and such dignity, such integrity and such uh God has so raised him up. Then he comes to his father who's now aged. Goes to see his father. He loses all of that dignity. He loses all of that. It's still that here am I. It's just that humility, you know, whatever the situation calls for. And he runs and embraces his father and and weeps upon his neck, the scripture says, a good while. And that father remained so endeared to him. I thought you know this is remarkable especially young men they get feeling you know kind of their strength and the strength of their youth and the girls perhaps uh you know their attractiveness and their maturity and everything else and and and this world's attitude is right away that the that the the father or the mother the the respect and the dignity seems to just dissipate. This world really friends what I'm saying is strange language because this world knows nothing of that kind of that kind of thing but because Jacob and he knew that he knew that the promise of God was from Abraham Isaac and Jacob it re it was irrelevant that he had become the most powerful man on earth &gt;&gt; under Pharaoh most powerful &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but he humbled himself You may not understand my words, but that's exactly that was in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ could have spoke one word and caused the men that were tormenting him to vanish. And you listen to the message. You You listen to You listen to the tapes, friends. That exact spirit &gt;&gt; was in Brother Brenham. &gt;&gt; That exact spirit. And he would sit there and come to a platform, come to a pulpit and and give such high regard to brethren who were opposing him, &gt;&gt; men who were in opposition to him. And he give such high regard to them, knowing knowing that in the next few minutes he was going to exercise something that no man on earth could do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you knew &gt;&gt; you're going to stand the next few moments and do something not only that these behind him couldn't do and neither of those in front of him could do or the president could not do or no king could do, no man on earth could do. And in the next few moments, you're going to exercise something divine. How did he know it? Because he had a supernatural contact. Amen. &gt;&gt; One that he could say, "I didn't do it. &gt;&gt; I couldn't help it. &gt;&gt; I have no control over this." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says to me, Brother Eddie, he says, "The people think I have visions." He said, "It's not me. It's their faith &gt;&gt; that brings the vision on." And he says, "And when the vision comes, I can't stop it. &gt;&gt; And when it's over, I can't bring it back again." My brother, my sister, what kind of a message do we have? I'm trying to say to you today, it's been confirmed like no other message ever on earth ever. Ever. Then no message confirmed such as the message you believe. If there is, you're under obligation to show it to me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And man shall live not by word alone, but by not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Satan is well able to take some choice phrases, choice selected out of the very message you believe because he he knows that's what you believe. And so if he wants to if he wants to try to uh turn you aside or get you derailed or get you off, he'll use the message you believe. He'll get just certain selected things and and and try to uh in in his attempt to oppose you, try to derail you or get you off of your main focus. But you we need to stand by every word that God has spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to me to me that is that is a fighting a good fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's fighting a good fight. when you have the opportunity uh given the opportunity as Joseph was given but he didn't succumb to that he didn't give into it when I see it the generation that we're in and the opportunities that are presented to this generation it's a very important thing for us to keep our focus &gt;&gt; on the spiritual thing the supernatural thing &gt;&gt; that God has done for us in your life. Amen. Let's just have prayer. Heavenly Father, all your word is for eternally settled in heaven. And how I thank you for it. I thank you, oh God, that you are the one who has initiated it. You're the one who brought it to us. There was no way for us even to imagine that you would do these things in our time. I think, oh God, uh when I first begin to hear of these glorious things, it was so strange to our ears. And yet there was a witness of the Holy Spirit within us. How true and how blessed. And the word of God just became such a living book to us. Oh, we bless your name, Lord. We bless your name. And today, I pray that you'll be honored in the hearts of the people. I pray that you'll be lifted up, oh God. And may the people be instructed in all truth. And I pray, Father, that we'll be instructed in the whole counsel of the word of God. As the Apostle Paul spake, that he had not he had not hindered or he had not uh shunned to declare the whole council. Your messenger did not shun to declare the whole council. And we we just take it, Lord, and soak it in and saturate ourselves with it. We thank you, Father, for this word that you have given us. And we want to give you glory by a lived out life in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I want to uh I want to sing that song. We bless your name. We bless your name. I had the number here, but I just Would you like to stand with me while we sing this big 2520 in the book? [Music] We bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] Heat. Heat. through the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. Heat. Heat. I bless your name. [Music] I bless your name. First verse in Christ. [Applause] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. You are the truth. I bless your name. I bless your name. Open my eyes. [Music] in your mind. We pray and they will. [Music] Yes, they will. I bless your name. Hallelujah. [Music] You are the truth. I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] Now before we sing the chorus once more too this pattern that I just closed out the message on here I am. I find it in Abraham. &gt;&gt; He'd say here I am. &gt;&gt; Here am I. I find it in Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the sixth chapter when he saw the condition and then condition of the people he was in. Here am I use me. I see it in Samuel as a boy 12. He kept saying he kept thinking it was Eli but see the spirit the attitude didn't change whether it was Eli or the Lord. He just kept saying, "Here am I. Here am I." And Eli said, he realized it was God. He said, "If he speaks again, just say your servant heareth." That attitude. I see it in Jesus. He didn't say those exact words. But when he was in Gethsemane, that's really what he said. &gt;&gt; Here am I. Whatever it is, whatever your purpose is, my brothers, my sisters, my precious, precious friends, that attitude will always be victorious. [Music] &gt;&gt; Number one, don't forget it. Number one, acknowledge. Never let anyone take it out from you. Acknowledge the supernatural thing that God has done and deposited in you. You can't change that. There's nothing you can do about that. God has done it. You might say, "What is it, Brother Biscll?" Do you have a believing heart that didn't come from this world? That came from God. You had a revelation of this word when it just a flash went on inside. You saw it. I believe that. That's a supernatural part of God. You can never take that out. Hold that that supernatural thing. And now say, I give myself to that supernatural element. As I said a moment ago, take the supernatural element out of all of the message that you people believe. Take the supernatural element out and we don't have anything but a bunch of words. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll have the same number of books and the same number of tapes, but it's just a lot of doctrine and different opinions and whatever more on the scripture. You understand what I mean? If you take the supernatural element out, but when you have the supernatural element and say God has spoken, &gt;&gt; that's thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't want any man's idea. I want thus saith the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; When you know you have that, &gt;&gt; then you put all your confidence in that and say, "I know I have that. Things are going good. Here I am. &gt;&gt; Things are going better. Here I am. &gt;&gt; Things took a turn for the worse. Here I am. &gt;&gt; My my health has been taken from me. Here I am. &gt;&gt; My friends leave me. Here I am. Whatever happens, here I am. Here I am. Here I am." That is the attitude that God loves. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to send you from this place with that phrase on your lips. Here I am. I want to bless you Lord with my life. God bless you each one. God bless you. I trust you have been fed this morning. And if you'll come early tonight, our brother Dio, I don't know what's on his heart, but one one service really isn't enough. I would have given him this morning's service, but I wanted to speak to you since I came back from China. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. give you praise. You are the life through the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. We bless your name. We bless your name. Oh, thank you, Lord. We give you honor. Give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. [Music] [Music] Brother Tom, would you close in prayer, please? [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful for the moving of God upon the word of God this morning. [Music] Lord Paul had it all in his heart and he said, "I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees." But when that supernatural element came by, struck him off his horse. Lord, the first thing he said, "Lord, here am I. Whatever you have me to do, I'm willing to go." Lord, we had a seed within our soul. But when that supernatural element came, there's something in our heart says, "Lord, use me. Direct me. Anoint me. Father, here am I this morning under the sound of your gospel." We say, "Use us as a body. Direct your children. Anoint us for service." Lord, let that word have its way within our lives. Father, we're thankful for what we've heard. And we pray, Lord, that the word will keep on stirring us. Lord, Joseph, Lord, was under that anointing. He couldn't help it. And Lord, we can say this morning, we can't help it. Lord, our eyes are looking to you. And we're just desiring more of God within our lives. Anoint us, use us, go with your people again, we pray. And Father, as brother Deoku would come this evening, stir us again. Lord, we know Lord, this is the hour, the catching away. And Lord Jesus, we just want to be prepared and ready, not knowing what tomorrow holds, but you're the God that holds tomorrow. So Lord, would you bring a word into due season for us this evening? Father, anointing both speaker and hearer that you after it all would be glorified. We pray. Go with us now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Like to keep this sweet atmosphere as you leave, as you shake hands with one another and get a little rest and refreshment this afternoon. And we'll see you this evening, Lord willing. God bless you. You're dismissed. All the light. [Music] Yes. Yes. [Music] Good morning. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] ask us Jesus. [Music]
