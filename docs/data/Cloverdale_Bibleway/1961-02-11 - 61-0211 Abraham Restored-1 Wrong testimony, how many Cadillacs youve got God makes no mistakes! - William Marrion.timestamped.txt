[0:00] why is it brother I stood here not long
[0:03] ago amongst a big bunch of fine
[0:05] Pentecostal man and I said you're giving
[0:07] the wrong testimonies you're always talk
[0:09] about how God's blessing you how many
[0:11] big things you got how many Cadillacs
[0:13] you can own and all like that that's a
[0:15] whole lot different what the first
[0:16] Pentecost was they sold everything they
[0:18] had and give it to the poor and went out
[0:20] preaching the gospel amen there's
[0:22] something wrong somewhere the Dr R
[0:25] there's a fellow raised up and said and
[0:27] brother Brown that was the greatest
[0:28] mistake the people ever made is in
[0:30] Jamaica if anybody's your brother Bon
[0:32] yes remember I don't know where the
[0:33] brother yeah with me sitting out there
[0:35] that night I said do you mean to tell me
[0:37] that you think that God makes a mistake
[0:40] God Don't Make No mistake a man is led
[0:42] by God they was led by God to do that he
[0:45] said then when the persecution come on
[0:47] they didn't have any home to go to I
[0:49] guess you think that was a mistake I
[0:50] said shame on you not KN no more been in
[0:53] Pentecost as long as you have know more
[0:55] about God than that that's exactly what
[0:57] God had to do they had nothing to go
[0:58] back to they went everywhere shattering
[1:00] the message throughout the country God
[1:02] knows what he's
[1:03] doing let him be led sure God don't make
[1:06] no mistakes it's you and I that makes a
[1:08] mistake God doesn't make it you feel led
[1:11] of the spirit move on move on just keep
[1:13] going on
