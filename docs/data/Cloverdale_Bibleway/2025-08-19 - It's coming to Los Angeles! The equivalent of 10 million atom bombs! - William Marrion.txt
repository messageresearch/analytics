Description:
William Marrion Branham Message Library
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. He prophesied of the sinking of Los Angeles in 1965. Scientists have been confirming his prophesy every day since then!

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. &gt;&gt; That's solemn warning. We don't know what time and you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here at the bottom of this ocean. Oh, Capernium said Jesus, thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works have been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it had been standing to this day. And Sodom Gomar lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea and Capernium's in the bottom of the sea. Thou city who claims to be the city of the angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of fashions and things to even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away through your fine churches and steeples and so forth the way you do. Remember, one day you will be laying in the bottom of this sea. You're a great honeycomb under you right now. The wrath of God is belching right beneath you. How much longer you'll hold this sandbar hanging over that when that ocean out under a mile deep will slide in there. Come back to the salt and sea. It'll be worse than the last day of Pompei. &gt;&gt; Repent. Los Angeles. Repent the rest of you and turn to God. The hour of his wrath is upon the earth. Flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ. The &gt;&gt; five strongest since 1900. It was so powerful in fact that it moved the main island of Japan 8 ft. This is just one of the 1.3 million earthquakes that occur around the globe each year. The largest ever recorded here in North America, Anchorage, Alaska, 1964. A 9.1. The Earth shook for five straight minutes. The energy release was the equivalent of 10 million atom bombs, the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima. And that's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded. No, the biggest was four years earlier off the coast of Valdivia and southern Chile. a 9.5 on the recctor scale right there. Bam. This quake lasted 11 minutes and spawned a tsunami 82 ft high that leveled Hilo, Hawaii, 8,000 mi away. 8,000 m away. So, um, it's it's mass destruction like this that shows just how important the research that we're doing here is because we need to be able to predict these things, right? To plan and prepare for them. Yes, ma'am. &gt;&gt; Professor, do you think something that intense could happen here? &gt;&gt; Well, the San Andreas fault runs right up the spine of California. It's the demarcation line between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving. I would add to that the fact that it's supposed to happen every 150 years and we're about 100 years overdue. I'd say it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. &gt;&gt; It's done been spoke. It has to &gt;&gt; There's going to be a rapture. Oh my. I remember just my last message in California where I thought I'd never go back again when I predict that Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean. Thus sayeth the Lord, it will. &gt;&gt; She's done. She's washed. She's finished. What hour? I don't know when, but it will be sunk. Right after that, the earthquakes begin to joke and bow. You remember many of you men standing right there, that rock that day when that angel came down there and that lightning fire falling from the heaven around the rock where we was standing there. &gt;&gt; Rocks playing out of the mountains and falling across her and she blasted three times hard. I said, "Judgment will strike the West Coast." Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember that same God that said that? Said Los Angeles is doomed and &gt;&gt; she's finished. I don't know when. I can't tell you. I didn't know what said that, but this brother here, I believe it was, no, one of the Mosley, I believe, had me out on the street out there. I didn't know what it was to look back now. I look back in the scripture and Jesus said, "Capernium, Capernium, how you exalted yourself, brother, up into heaven shall be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works have been done in you that have been done in Sodom, it stood today. And about 150 years from there, Sodom had already in the earth, then Capernaum is in the water too today. And that same spirit of God that said all these things and done all these things. It said there, "Oh city Capernium, who called yourself by the name of the angels, Los Angeles, how you've exalted yourself into heaven, the very root and seat of Satan. See, you've exalted yourself preachers. It's a graveyard for them. Good men, go there and die like rats. What happened? You that call yourself by the name of the angels. If the mighty works have been done in Sodom had been done in you, it stood today. But your hours come, you watch and see if it ain't I'm a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Okay. You don't have to do this now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we do. We're good to go. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Roll. First question, how come no one saw what happened in Nevada coming? &gt;&gt; Because we didn't know there were any fault lines out there. &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; Contrary to popular belief, scientists don't know everything. &gt;&gt; I understand that you publicly stated that someday scientists will be able to predict earthquakes. &gt;&gt; Well, actually, as of yesterday, we now believe that we can predict them. &gt;&gt; Professor, &gt;&gt; talk to you a sec. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sorry. Excuse me. What is it? &gt;&gt; Current pulse rates at our monitoring stations all along the San Andreas fault. Their averages are spiking from 82 to 85 with the biggest jumps coming from San Francisco. More than 20 points higher than what we saw in the V. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. There's no way. &gt;&gt; We checked. We double checked. &gt;&gt; Then we reset all the instruments and triple checked. Those are the counts. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait, no. &gt;&gt; Um, okay. Ah, if we draw a line from the bottom of the San Andreas up to the Hoover Dam, it almost literally follows the Colorado River, which is a natural deformation event. And geologically, deformationation events mark boundaries. They mark boundaries. So, what if what if this whole chunk of land is connected to our tectonic plate? That would tell us that what happened yesterday in Nevada was not an anomaly. No. What if it was a precursor movement along the leading edge of the plate boundary fault from Los Angeles all the way up to San Francisco? Are you saying you think the whole San Andreas fault might go off? &gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Who should we call? &gt;&gt; Everybody.
