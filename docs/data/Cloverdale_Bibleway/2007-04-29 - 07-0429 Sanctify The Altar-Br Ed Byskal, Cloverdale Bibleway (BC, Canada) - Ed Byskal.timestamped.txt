[16:50] Father. We thank you, Lord, for your

[17:02] Lord. Jehovah Raph, oh God. Lord, you're
[17:05] a provider for everything, Father.
[17:08] Lord, I know my brothers and sisters
[17:10] have a burden on their hearts, Lord. I
[17:12] know God that Lord you can come down
[17:16] Father and give them faith Lord that
[17:18] they need Father for that certain
[17:21] request they have Lord. Father we thank
[17:24] you Lord for making our hearts an altar
[17:26] Lord. We thank you for coming last

[41:25] Oh father,
[41:27] we are so grateful for the prayers that
[41:30] we've heard,
[41:32] for the songs that we have sung, to be
[41:35] able to view the children, oh God, from
[41:37] the school. What a beautiful
[41:42] bouquet of flowers this appears to us,
[41:46] Lord, because you're the one that has
[41:49] you're the one that has caused them to
[41:50] blossom into these lovely lives. And I
[41:54] pray that they will grow and mature, oh
[41:56] God, and they will continue with that
[41:59] song in their hearts. Everybody ought to
[42:01] know who Jesus is. And as our sisters
[42:05] sang, we've come to worship you, Lord,
[42:08] and that in truth is what is in our
[42:10] hearts. We're here today to thank you
[42:14] for the moving of your Holy Spirit
[42:16] amongst us. We are here to thank you, oh
[42:20] God, for the indwelling of the Holy
[42:22] Ghost in our lives and for what you are
[42:25] doing and what you will do even today
[42:28] and what you will continue to do. We
[42:31] thank you, Father, from the depths of
[42:33] our hearts. And now we just come to
[42:35] present ourselves. We pray that you'll
[42:38] lead us on this pathway on the footsteps
[42:42] that we must make today. I ask that you
[42:45] will anoint oh God speaker and the
[42:48] hearers in the name of Jesus Christ.
[42:51] Amen.
[42:54] God bless you.
[42:57] My we had a glorious time on Wednesday.
[43:03] Actually the glory fell long after the
[43:05] service preaching was over and I uh I
[43:10] left about 10:30
[43:12] and was just driving along actually when
[43:14] I next looked at my watch it was4 to 11
[43:18] and then I get a phone call just coming
[43:20] on to midnight and uh Linda said I've
[43:24] just left the church and there's still
[43:27] young men in there and some people in
[43:29] there and said they just got lost in
[43:31] God.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I actually I thought I was going
[43:34] to maybe even get one or two of them to
[43:36] testify this morning, but uh we'll maybe
[43:40] just save that for another time because
[43:42] I'm short on time. But uh I tell you
[43:45] what, I am indebted to our heavenly
[43:49] father
[43:50] &gt;&gt; because without him, we're this is just
[43:53] a wasted exercise.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; But with him,
[43:57] &gt;&gt; it means everything.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, aren't we thankful?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I say, pour it on, Lord.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Pour it on. We're ready to throw the
[44:08] clock away.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're ready to throw all
[44:13] everything else away. Just give us God's
[44:16] program. That's all we want. As I had
[44:19] prayed last Wednesday, I said, "Lord,
[44:21] we've heard all kinds of preaching. I
[44:23] don't want to get up there and preach.
[44:24] We want God to come in behind and do it.
[44:28] do what we can't do. See, we can say it,
[44:31] but he's the one that has to do it.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; I want him to do it. Don't you?
[44:38] &gt;&gt; If a person was sick here, they don't
[44:41] need a big dialogue or discourse on
[44:44] healing and sickness. They need someone
[44:46] to come and do the healing.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone bound.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; We want them to be free.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Of course we do.
[44:58] Tomorrow night is uh tomorrow night and
[45:01] Tuesday we're having a service with
[45:05] Rabbi Richmond. Rabbi Richmond will be
[45:07] here to talk to us and to speak with us.
[45:10] And I always use these occasions of his
[45:13] visit to see have a a special window for
[45:17] he will see Israel and what is taking
[45:20] place in a much clearer and from a very
[45:24] very much different vantage point than
[45:27] we have. And so we'll not be having a
[45:30] service as we're having this service.
[45:32] We'll just be opening it. And we want to
[45:34] give him all the time. It's come a long
[45:36] ways. actually came right from Israel
[45:38] here directly arriving just after
[45:41] service this morning. We'll be picking
[45:43] him up. He's u he's uh his wife is with
[45:47] him, Reena. And uh
[45:50] I would like to just uh caution our
[45:54] sisters if you would be very very
[45:55] mindful
[45:57] uh because here it is our custom we
[45:59] thrust out our hand to shake hands and
[46:02] it puts him in a very awkward position
[46:04] because uh he doesn't practice shaking
[46:07] hands with sisters or with the women. So
[46:11] if you just be mindful of that please if
[46:13] you are meeting him. So don't put them
[46:16] in that awkward position. But it'll be
[46:18] 7:30 tomorrow night and Tuesday night
[46:21] and thus no service on Wednesday night.
[46:24] So tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday and
[46:26] nothing on no service on Wednesday.
[46:29] Amen.
[46:31] Would you like to take your Bibles now
[46:33] and turn to John's Gospel the 17th
[46:38] chapter? The only place in the Bible
[46:40] where this prayer of our Lord Jesus
[46:45] is recorded,
[46:47] John,
[46:50] eagle spirit.
[46:55] When I uh think of that, I just marvel
[46:58] how God had John pick that up. And the
[47:02] other gospel writers, Matthew, Mark, and
[47:05] Luke, do not record the prayer of Jesus.
[47:09] But oh, how glad I am that it's there.
[47:12] John 13 was not recorded. The
[47:15] footwashing. John 15, I'm the true vine
[47:19] was only recorded by John. Many of them,
[47:22] many of the things that John picked up
[47:24] were not recorded by the other writers,
[47:27] but God ordained that they would pick up
[47:29] just exactly what they were to pick up
[47:32] and to write.
[47:34] We're starting at the 14th verse of John
[47:37] 14.
[47:39] I have given them thy word, and the
[47:42] world hath hated them, because they are
[47:46] not of the world, even as I am not of
[47:49] the world. I pray not that thou should
[47:52] us take them out of the world, but that
[47:54] thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
[47:57] They are not of the world, even as I am
[48:00] not of the world. Sanctify them through
[48:03] thy truth. Thy word is truth. And I
[48:07] would like you to notice the 17th verse.
[48:09] Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy
[48:13] word is truth. I have a few verses I
[48:16] would like to read out of the book of
[48:17] Joshua in the third chapter of Joshua.
[48:22] Moses
[48:23] uh God told Joshua, "Moses, my servant
[48:26] is dead and uh you go and take this
[48:30] people over into the promised land and
[48:34] cross Jordan."
[48:37] In the third chapter, and we'll read
[48:39] from verses 1 to5.
[48:42] And Joshua rose up early in the morning,
[48:45] and they removed from Shatim and came to
[48:49] Jordan, he and all the children of
[48:51] Israel, and lodged there before they
[48:54] passed over. And it came to pass after
[48:57] three days that the officers went
[48:59] through the host and they commanded the
[49:02] people saying, "When you see the ark of
[49:05] the covenant," or that's the word of
[49:07] God, "when you see the ark of the
[49:09] covenant of the Lord your God, and the
[49:13] priests, the Levites bearing it, then
[49:16] you shall remove from your place," and I
[49:19] love these words, "and go after it."
[49:22] Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; And go after it. When you see the word
[49:28] moving
[49:29] &gt;&gt; and you see the Levites and the priests
[49:31] carrying it and you see it advancing,
[49:35] you can't sit where you are. Go after
[49:37] it.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] Verse four. Yet there shall be a space
[49:45] between you and it about 2,000 cubits by
[49:49] measure. Come not near unto it, that you
[49:53] may know the way by which you must go,
[49:56] for you have not passed this way
[49:58] hitherto. For verse five, and Joshua
[50:02] said unto the people, sanctify
[50:05] yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will
[50:09] do wonders among you. God bless you as
[50:11] you have your seats. And Joshua said to
[50:15] the people, "Sanctify yourselves,
[50:19] for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders."
[50:22] And to sanctify
[50:25] is simply to set yourself aside
[50:29] or set something apart. If something
[50:31] sanctified to God, that means that it is
[50:35] set apart. It is sanctified. It is made
[50:39] sacred. it has a special consideration.
[50:44] Uh and and and I think that I would like
[50:47] to say that we have a realization
[50:51] that this has a special purpose. This
[50:54] object or this thing has a special
[50:57] purpose. We should focus on it. Say this
[50:59] has a special purpose. I set it aside. I
[51:03] sanctify it for God's purpose, for God's
[51:06] use. And the thing that I am having you
[51:10] focus on with me as we did on Wednesday
[51:12] is your heart which the prophet said is
[51:15] God's altar. And every person in the
[51:19] under the sound of my voice has that
[51:22] altar. You do not have to look to the
[51:25] platform and say, "Well, there's the
[51:27] pastor speaking and you know he's a he's
[51:31] got the focal point." No. Every person
[51:34] is a focal point because you have an
[51:36] altar. You have a heart. And I want to
[51:39] speak on this subject. Sanctify the
[51:42] altar.
[51:45] Set aside the heart. The altar. Because
[51:51] because we haven't gone this way before.
[51:55] We're sitting here in expectation
[51:58] of a rapture season, a time we have
[52:01] received the already the sign of the
[52:05] resurrection. We've received the
[52:07] messenger, a forerunner of the
[52:08] resurrection. We know that that's the
[52:12] we're we know we're in the process of
[52:14] the coming of the Lord. I believe it is
[52:17] a time to set ourselves aside, to set
[52:21] our hearts and to identify and say, "If
[52:24] there ever was a time in our lives, if
[52:28] there ever was a time
[52:30] that we ought to
[52:33] examine our heart, I'm not talking about
[52:35] in some critical condemn condemning way,
[52:38] but I'm I'm speaking about we we that we
[52:42] sanctify the heart and look upon it and
[52:45] say, "What what is there? What ought to
[52:46] be there? What ought what I ought to be
[52:49] occupied with and in my heart? And
[52:52] that's my uh service this morning. I'm
[52:57] going to give a summary
[52:59] and then take that summary in part
[53:03] through the service. The altar
[53:07] is our heart.
[53:10] Number two,
[53:12] it needs to be sanctified and set apart.
[53:18] Our hearts are dreadfully encumbered in
[53:21] this day,
[53:23] especially at certain times. There are
[53:26] certain season, and if there ever was a
[53:28] season when we ought to set ourselves
[53:31] aside, it's this season. It's not enough
[53:34] to talk about the rapture. It's not
[53:36] enough to talk about the second coming
[53:38] of Jesus Christ, but it's a time to be
[53:41] set aside. Have your heart set aside for
[53:44] it.
[53:47] Especially in this day, especially in
[53:49] this time when there is so much to
[53:53] distract the individual. There's so much
[53:56] out there to occupy your heart.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; There's so much
[54:07] And when I think of that, I just wrote
[54:10] down divide and conquer.
[54:13] And it's a phrase that we're all
[54:15] familiar with. But when there's so much
[54:17] out there, I mean, Satan in this Satan's
[54:20] Eden has put so much out there, so much
[54:24] to distract and to occupy a person and
[54:27] to to get it on your heart to do certain
[54:31] things or to achieve certain things. and
[54:33] it becomes the allconsuming thing then I
[54:36] think that the purpose his purpose is to
[54:39] divide and conquer to try try to take
[54:42] control.
[54:44] The altar
[54:46] is made for sacrifice.
[54:50] Just want to make that statement.
[54:54] And next
[54:55] sacrifice
[54:58] speaks of the shedding of blood,
[55:00] something dying.
[55:02] Sacrifice.
[55:05] There may be other things offered on the
[55:07] altar because if we looked at the Old
[55:11] Testament, you'd find that as I
[55:13] mentioned Wednesday, there was peace
[55:14] offerings and burnt offerings and
[55:16] offerings of incense and and all kinds
[55:19] of things that were being offered. But
[55:21] essentially and basically the altar was
[55:24] made for a sacrifice that would be
[55:26] acceptable to God. And that in that
[55:30] sacrifice and I want you to I want you
[55:33] to get this because it's a it's a
[55:35] all-encompassing statement. The very
[55:38] concept
[55:39] of a sacrifice being made behind that
[55:44] concept was the fact that the the
[55:47] offerer, the one that was making the
[55:50] offering would come into reconciliation
[55:54] with God. The very purpose that the
[55:57] offering was being made, the very the
[56:00] very reason that there was a need for an
[56:02] offering
[56:04] indicated that there was a separation
[56:07] that and this act was being done to
[56:10] bring a reconciliation between God and
[56:14] the one that was making the offering.
[56:18] So with that I want to commence the uh
[56:23] the subject.
[56:26] The Lord said to Moses
[56:28] because we have the Lord said unto
[56:32] Moses, go unto the people and sanctify
[56:35] them today and tomorrow and let them
[56:37] wash their clothes. So there was
[56:39] something that they they had to do which
[56:42] was a physical act so that they would
[56:45] know that they were being set aside. In
[56:48] the message I've heard but now I see and
[56:50] I'm still just wanting to lay a little
[56:52] bit of a foundation here for another
[56:53] moment or two.
[56:56] Brother Brandham asked a question. In
[56:57] the message I've heard but now I see. I
[57:00] wonder if we've done everything that God
[57:03] requires us to do. Have we followed
[57:06] every iota of the scripture?
[57:09] He has to I've underlined this. Have we
[57:13] given him our hearts and lives to
[57:17] service? I think those are good and
[57:20] legitimate questions.
[57:23] What's the reason that you want to be
[57:25] healed? He asked a question. What's the
[57:27] reason? He's speaking to a lot of people
[57:28] want to be healed. What's the reason
[57:30] that you want to be healed? He said,
[57:31] "That's the reason you can't get faith
[57:33] enough is because you haven't maybe made
[57:37] this thing
[57:39] this thing to God sincerely from your
[57:42] heart." And he mentions then Hezekiah
[57:45] the king that was told by the prophet
[57:47] Isaiah that he was going to die and he
[57:49] put his face to the wall and asked for
[57:51] 15 more years because he said he needed
[57:54] to set things in order. and God granted
[57:57] him 15 more years of time.
[58:02] When we think of the altar,
[58:05] there's a scripture that I want to read
[58:10] and it's out of Exodus 40:10. You don't
[58:12] need to turn to it. I just like to read
[58:14] it. And God speaking then now, and
[58:17] there's several things in this verse I
[58:19] want you to make special note of. And
[58:22] you shall anoint the altar. And you
[58:25] remember I've been speaking now a couple
[58:27] of services on the anointing about
[58:29] three. And that when we talk about
[58:32] anointing, I'm saying that for those
[58:34] that may be here for the first time or
[58:36] just visiting, when we talk about
[58:38] anointing, it is a process. It's a It's
[58:41] something that um uh there's a sequence
[58:43] of events all through the scripture, but
[58:46] it just started out with
[58:48] Jacob anointing the stone that he laid
[58:52] his head on and dreamed of angels on a
[58:56] ladder. They call it Jacob's ladder. It
[58:58] wasn't Jacob's ladder. He dreamed about
[59:00] it. And there was angels going
[59:02] descending and ascending.
[59:04] And he and he poured oil upon that and
[59:07] anointed that stone for because of the
[59:09] experience that he had. And so the
[59:12] anointing that was the first initial
[59:15] thought that was introduced in the
[59:18] Bible. But by the time you get through
[59:20] the scripture when you come to the end,
[59:22] you'll find out that that only was
[59:25] indicative of something being poured
[59:27] out.
[59:29] Being poured out and something
[59:31] transferred being transferred. And so
[59:34] the anointing, the anointing is that
[59:37] something from God himself is being
[59:40] transferred to the individual, something
[59:44] that's being poured out into you. And
[59:46] then brother Brandon comes along saying
[59:48] that all that was in God, he poured into
[59:51] Christ. And all that was in Christ, he
[59:54] poured into the church, into his body.
[59:58] And and so so now when God says to
[1:00:01] Moses, he said, "And you shall anoint
[1:00:03] the altar,"
[1:00:05] something is to be poured out upon the
[1:00:08] altar because it's being sanctified. He
[1:00:11] said, "Be and thou shalt anoint the
[1:00:13] altar of the burnt offering and all his
[1:00:17] vessels and sanctify the altar." You'll
[1:00:21] anoint the altar and you'll sanctify the
[1:00:24] altar. what he's saying now, and if we
[1:00:26] take it in the prophet's language, you
[1:00:28] will you'll pour out onto the altar.
[1:00:31] You'll transfer onto the altar to
[1:00:34] indicate that the altar is being set
[1:00:36] aside for a special purpose. This just
[1:00:41] isn't for anything. Somebody's got an
[1:00:43] idea. Oh, I want to offer this or I like
[1:00:45] to do that or I This wasn't everybody's
[1:00:48] idea. This was God's idea. And you will
[1:00:51] anoint the altar
[1:00:53] your heart and you will anoint how how
[1:00:56] can your heart be anointed? Because God
[1:00:59] must transfer to your heart. He anoints
[1:01:03] your heart to sanctify it and set it
[1:01:06] aside for his own exclusive purpose.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what he's referring
[1:01:12] to here. and you'll sanctify the altar
[1:01:16] and it shall be an altar
[1:01:18] most holy.
[1:01:21] That's exactly God's purpose, friends,
[1:01:24] to set our hearts aside. It'll be most
[1:01:29] holy set aside for himself.
[1:01:33] Amen.
[1:01:42] Solomon who was a very wise man
[1:01:47] uh
[1:01:49] he got in trouble by a lot of wives
[1:01:51] which he had
[1:01:53] but he said some very wise things that
[1:01:55] are the scripture and the word of God is
[1:01:57] perfect. He said my son give me thine
[1:02:01] heart and let thine eyes observe my
[1:02:04] ways.
[1:02:06] Now brother Brandham said several times
[1:02:08] Satan he takes the head. He always
[1:02:12] appeals to the head, appeals to the
[1:02:14] reasoning, but God takes the heart. When
[1:02:19] Satan used the serpent in in Eden, he
[1:02:22] came and he began to reason with her.
[1:02:25] But when God comes to a person, he comes
[1:02:29] and he said, "God wants to lead man." So
[1:02:33] he made himself a little control tower
[1:02:36] in the midst of his heart.
[1:02:38] God wants to lead you. And so he's made
[1:02:43] a little control tower. And it's not in
[1:02:46] your head, it's in your heart. So it
[1:02:49] isn't how you weigh things out, how you
[1:02:51] reason things out, how you check it out,
[1:02:54] but it's in your heart. You'll have a
[1:02:56] witness inside.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; You believe in that?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, and I'm just being as
[1:03:02] brief as I can because I want to make uh
[1:03:06] quite a distance this morning. Lord
[1:03:08] willing. He said that is the great fight
[1:03:11] tonight.
[1:03:12] Satan took the eye
[1:03:16] a man's head to control
[1:03:19] him by his head and God took his heart.
[1:03:24] He said he took his eye. He said to Eve
[1:03:27] right away, you know, and the Bible says
[1:03:30] that she looked and she saw. You know,
[1:03:32] we look and we see things and we
[1:03:34] perceive things by what we see and then
[1:03:37] we, you know, put it through our thought
[1:03:39] process. Don't trust that.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Trust what your heart is saying.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And in a in atmosphere, when you come
[1:03:48] into the atmosphere, especially coming
[1:03:50] into the into a place of worship such as
[1:03:52] we are this morning, we sing the songs
[1:03:55] of Zion and hear the prayers that are
[1:03:58] prayed. There's a certain atmosphere and
[1:04:01] the angels of God love this atmosphere.
[1:04:05] They are dispatched.
[1:04:08] Whether you believe it or not, that
[1:04:10] won't change the fact. They're
[1:04:12] dispatched. The angels, your angel is
[1:04:16] here. The Holy Spirit is here. And
[1:04:19] they're dispatched. The prophet says to
[1:04:21] energize your faith because God wants to
[1:04:25] do something for it. But it can't come
[1:04:27] there just a mental ascent. It's got to
[1:04:30] be something else. It's got to be a
[1:04:32] spiritual witness that's down within an
[1:04:35] individual's heart.
[1:04:37] He went on to say in looking at the
[1:04:39] unseen, man's always trying to achieve
[1:04:43] something by his head. He's supposed to
[1:04:47] achieve, but he's supposed to achieve.
[1:04:50] You're supposed to make achievement, but
[1:04:52] it's by your heart.
[1:04:56] He said that's the control tower where
[1:04:59] God controls him and directs his
[1:05:03] thoughts. The control tower from the
[1:05:07] inside from the inside of the inside.
[1:05:10] And he wants to direct his thoughts and
[1:05:12] direct his walks and direct his
[1:05:15] emotions. God wants to direct your
[1:05:18] direction. He wants to direct your
[1:05:21] thoughts, your emotion, your feelings,
[1:05:23] everything by the inner witness inside
[1:05:25] the heart.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "Sometimes I get so happy I
[1:05:30] just have to let it loose."
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "And if I look around and see
[1:05:36] somebody, then see I got my eyes on
[1:05:39] people." Then
[1:05:43] maybe you ought to just kind of forget
[1:05:44] who's around you today and let it loose.
[1:05:48] If that restricted him, I'm sure it
[1:05:50] restricts us. We look around say, "Oh, I
[1:05:53] don't know if this is just exactly
[1:05:54] right." I'm glad that the some of our
[1:05:57] young men here on Wednesday night kind
[1:06:00] of forgot. They let it loose. They
[1:06:02] forgot who was around them. And that's a
[1:06:04] kind of formality that we don't need. We
[1:06:07] don't need what's around us or what our
[1:06:09] eyes declare. We need what? The witness.
[1:06:12] What is it in your heart?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:16] And after I get preaching a little
[1:06:18] while, I'll forget what I'm seeing. As
[1:06:21] I've said many times, and especially in
[1:06:23] special meetings, I've got I haven't got
[1:06:25] great eyesight for distance. If I take
[1:06:28] my glasses off, it's kind of a blur out
[1:06:30] there. And so I've told people when you
[1:06:33] see me take my glasses off, it's because
[1:06:34] I don't want to really study the faces
[1:06:37] of the people. I want to be able to
[1:06:40] concentrate on the witness that's
[1:06:42] inside.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] the control tower of the soul and one
[1:06:49] for the body. He said many times these
[1:06:51] war one against the other. The control
[1:06:54] tower, you know when you're thirsty, you
[1:06:56] know when you're hungry, you know when
[1:06:58] you're not feeling well
[1:07:01] because you have a control tower that
[1:07:03] tells you that. But there's one in the
[1:07:05] soul, a control tower. Said there's a
[1:07:09] control tower of the soul and one for
[1:07:11] the body. said, "The flesh thirsts
[1:07:15] to satisfy the desires that's in the
[1:07:17] body and the spirit desires for the
[1:07:20] things that's in the soul."
[1:07:23] Many times these war one against
[1:07:26] another. And if there's any conflict
[1:07:28] this morning, I declare in the name of
[1:07:31] Jesus Christ, let the desire of the soul
[1:07:34] win out.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Let the desire of the soul conquer any
[1:07:37] other desire that we might have. And the
[1:07:40] people can say
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; he said we find there's a great trouble
[1:07:44] today that too many people try to live
[1:07:47] between these two desires.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Try to live between you cannot live
[1:07:53] between those two desires. We have to be
[1:07:55] given over to one or the other. And so
[1:07:58] let's be given over to the desires of
[1:08:00] the soul.
[1:08:02] Amen.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; For one of them desires the earth and
[1:08:06] the other one desires the things of
[1:08:09] heaven.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Where's your strong desire this morning?
[1:08:15] David, he expresses the total unity of
[1:08:18] the outer and the inner man. When he
[1:08:21] said, "My soul longeth." Now, in these
[1:08:24] next scriptures and so on, I want to
[1:08:26] focus on the heart because that's the
[1:08:28] altar. My soul longeth, yay, even
[1:08:32] faintth for the courts of the Lord. My
[1:08:36] heart and my flesh. So he had un he had
[1:08:39] a clear understanding that his his heart
[1:08:43] was more than his flesh, more than just
[1:08:46] a muscle beating in his chest. And my
[1:08:49] heart and my flesh crith out for the
[1:08:52] living God. As I said on Wednesday,
[1:08:56] believe it or not, I'm still just laying
[1:08:57] foundation. said on Wednesday, the
[1:09:00] heart, the Hebrew understanding for the
[1:09:03] heart was the inner man.
[1:09:05] The mind, the will, the understanding,
[1:09:09] the knowledge, the thinking, the
[1:09:11] reflection,
[1:09:13] these all are in the context of the
[1:09:17] heart. What you're inclined to do, how
[1:09:19] you're inclined to think of things, your
[1:09:23] resolve,
[1:09:24] I'm determined. The Hebrew understood
[1:09:27] that was in your heart. It's not
[1:09:29] something you just saw in your mind and
[1:09:31] said, "I'm going to make that decision."
[1:09:32] But it's something deeper. And that's
[1:09:34] exactly what the prophet says. It's in
[1:09:36] your heart. Then it comes to your mind.
[1:09:38] You're you're being motivated. You make
[1:09:40] decisions, but it's an it's an inner
[1:09:42] witness. The really the re real aspect
[1:09:45] of the heart. And the heart is the place
[1:09:47] of the moral character. You don't think
[1:09:50] about being moral. It's something that's
[1:09:52] in you, an inner witness within. It's
[1:09:55] the seat of your appetites, the seat of
[1:09:57] emotion, emotions in your passions, and
[1:10:00] your desire. And it's also the seat of
[1:10:02] your courage. You don't say with your
[1:10:04] head, I'm going to do it. But there's
[1:10:06] something within you. Even when your
[1:10:08] head says, "This might be dangerous, but
[1:10:10] something inside, I'm going to do it." I
[1:10:12] had a brother came to the message years
[1:10:14] ago, and he was an alcoholic, and he had
[1:10:17] been a good Catholic man, and he gave
[1:10:19] himself, he even went way down into
[1:10:21] Borneo. And some of you know who I'm
[1:10:23] speaking about. He's gone on to be with
[1:10:24] the Lord now. But he went to Borneo on a
[1:10:26] missionary ship in uh in uh for the
[1:10:30] Catholic church because he was doing
[1:10:32] everything to give himself to give
[1:10:34] himself to try to separate himself from
[1:10:37] this terrible alcoholism. And he came in
[1:10:41] contact with the message. His brother
[1:10:42] told him, "You need to go over and and
[1:10:45] hear hear these people." And he came in,
[1:10:48] he told me with his own lips, he says,
[1:10:50] "My mind, my thoughts could find all
[1:10:54] kinds of argument and things to
[1:10:57] counteract what I was hearing in the
[1:10:59] message." But he said, "I knew there was
[1:11:02] just something I knew this was my last
[1:11:05] chance."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; He surrendered himself to God. He came
[1:11:10] and he gave himself so unreservedly. He
[1:11:13] lived as a wonderful believer. This
[1:11:16] message just illuminated him and he came
[1:11:18] into such a joy and a liberty that he
[1:11:21] was free from his alcoholism. He called
[1:11:23] his mother right away who lives on
[1:11:25] Vancouver Island. Called her said, "I
[1:11:28] I'm delivered of my alcoholism." She
[1:11:30] said,
[1:11:32] "Call me in six months."
[1:11:36] And then he just went down into the pits
[1:11:38] and he came and he said, "Brother Ed,
[1:11:40] what do I do?" He said, "Tried to tell
[1:11:42] him what happened and they told me to
[1:11:43] come back and call her in six months.
[1:11:45] what should I do? I said, call her in 6
[1:11:46] months.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't have any I didn't have any
[1:11:49] worry there wasn't going to hang in
[1:11:51] there. I didn't have any worry. 6 months
[1:11:53] came by. I said, I called her. She still
[1:11:55] doesn't believe it. I said, call her in
[1:11:57] a year.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; So, he waited till the year was over.
[1:12:00] Hi, Mom. Still hanging in there. I'm
[1:12:03] totally free.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; He lived totally free to his last day
[1:12:07] and went across in victory. Amen. That's
[1:12:10] exactly the God I'm It's an inner
[1:12:12] witness. But his mind was saying,
[1:12:14] there's all kinds of all kinds of things
[1:12:16] here you can argue with, all kinds of
[1:12:18] things here you can find fault with in
[1:12:20] this message. But he said, "My heart was
[1:12:23] saying, yay."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it's been with so
[1:12:28] many of you? There's so many things, so
[1:12:30] many doubts and and and questions and
[1:12:32] fears and things that come into the
[1:12:35] mind. But the altar where God was
[1:12:37] dealing with the altar, the altar was
[1:12:40] saying, "Yes, yes, it's true. It's
[1:12:43] true." Something inside. That's what you
[1:12:46] want to listen to.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Like Charles Wesley father, Charles
[1:12:50] Wesley's father on his dying bed, uh,
[1:12:53] when he was dying and and Wesley,
[1:12:56] Charles Wesley came to him and I think
[1:12:59] it was his last words to his son. He
[1:13:02] said, "It's the inner witness, son. the
[1:13:05] inner witness.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I'll say it today, it's the inner
[1:13:10] witness.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] And so now the the Greeks picked up in
[1:13:18] the New Testament, and I won't labor on
[1:13:20] this at all, but they also had much the
[1:13:23] same thought, only the Greeks, you know,
[1:13:26] they sought after wisdom. And so uh uh
[1:13:30] they put a lot of emphasis on the fact
[1:13:33] that the the heart was a part of our
[1:13:37] organ system and part of the blood
[1:13:39] circulatory system. But yet
[1:13:44] they they felt it was the center and
[1:13:46] seat of spiritual life.
[1:13:50] And that it is.
[1:13:52] Now,
[1:13:54] I want to take a few scriptures
[1:13:57] uh concerning the heart
[1:14:00] because I I I have something that I want
[1:14:02] to bring to you very urgently this
[1:14:04] morning. The heart
[1:14:10] possesses enormous capacity
[1:14:15] for both good and evil.
[1:14:23] We hear some uh atrocities that take
[1:14:26] place and then it gets up into the
[1:14:29] courts
[1:14:31] and we find defense attorneys often
[1:14:35] saying it was,
[1:14:38] you know, it was just a momentary
[1:14:41] insanity.
[1:14:43] I have a problem with that because I
[1:14:46] often wonder why doesn't somebody even
[1:14:49] on the law of averages do something
[1:14:52] fantastically good out of a momentary
[1:14:56] insanity?
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Why doesn't somebody, you know, totally
[1:15:00] give away all their inheritance or just
[1:15:03] do something fantastically
[1:15:05] marvelous and good? say, "Well, you
[1:15:08] know, they had a momentary insanity."
[1:15:15] See, Sister Lynn Franco smiling. I think
[1:15:17] she she worked along these lines in an
[1:15:19] attorney's office for years and I don't
[1:15:21] think she ever encountered anybody
[1:15:24] doing something just radically
[1:15:27] almost insanely good because they just
[1:15:30] lost their but when they do something
[1:15:32] disastrous and murder somebody or do
[1:15:35] some disastrous thing oh they just were
[1:15:39] temporarily
[1:15:41] insane.
[1:15:43] Well,
[1:15:45] the heart possesses this a capacity for
[1:15:48] both good and evil.
[1:15:50] And however, the heart was made, God
[1:15:54] actually, this heart that I'm talking
[1:15:56] about, not the physical muscle of our
[1:15:59] heart, but the heart that I'm talking
[1:16:01] about has been made for a very special
[1:16:04] purpose.
[1:16:06] It is in this part, this altar, sacred
[1:16:11] altar where God meets you.
[1:16:16] And that makes it a very special place
[1:16:20] within a person. That's where God meets
[1:16:22] you. And here
[1:16:24] God meets you personally.
[1:16:28] And here
[1:16:30] God unites himself with you.
[1:16:34] But I want to say very quickly, not
[1:16:37] without blood.
[1:16:39] And that will probably pose a big
[1:16:41] question in your mind right now. And
[1:16:44] this is where I want to
[1:16:47] I've set all of that foundation to come
[1:16:50] right now and probably bring some
[1:16:52] question to your mind.
[1:17:01] The heart can know despair,
[1:17:05] grief,
[1:17:07] it can be broken. These are all
[1:17:10] scriptures. I don't have time to give
[1:17:11] you the scripture.
[1:17:14] The heart can be bowed down,
[1:17:18] can no bitterness,
[1:17:21] it can be filled with anger.
[1:17:26] The heart today experiences in our day
[1:17:30] because the scripture prophesies it many
[1:17:33] many fears.
[1:17:35] It is particularly subject to fear. The
[1:17:39] heart is subject to fear. People fear
[1:17:42] the future.
[1:17:44] They fear what's going to happen to
[1:17:45] their family.
[1:17:48] They fear their physical well-being.
[1:17:52] They fear what's going to be for their
[1:17:55] retirement. They fear the economy
[1:17:58] and we have many many fears
[1:18:03] in Deuteronomy.
[1:18:06] Uh God speaking and Moses writes in the
[1:18:11] morning thou shalt say
[1:18:14] would to God it was even
[1:18:17] or evening and at evening thou shalt say
[1:18:21] would God it were morning. for the fear
[1:18:24] of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear
[1:18:27] and for the sight of thine eyes which
[1:18:29] thou shalt see.
[1:18:33] God was saying to the people because
[1:18:34] you've chosen this and because you're
[1:18:36] going this direction, I'm going to
[1:18:39] you're going to come to a time when fear
[1:18:41] will grip you. And in the morning,
[1:18:43] you'll say, "I wish it was evening so I
[1:18:46] could go to bed and forget this." And in
[1:18:48] the evening, you'll say, "I wish it was
[1:18:50] morning."
[1:18:54] And Jesus said, "Men's heart failing
[1:18:58] them for fear and looking once again
[1:19:00] with the eyes, looking after those
[1:19:03] things which are coming on the earth,
[1:19:05] for the powers of the heaven shall be
[1:19:08] shaken."
[1:19:12] In 1 John 4:18, John writes, "There is
[1:19:16] no fear in love, but perfect love
[1:19:19] casteth out fear, because fear hath
[1:19:23] torment. He that fearth is not made
[1:19:26] perfect in love." Fear hath torment. And
[1:19:29] I would say, I don't think there's
[1:19:31] anybody here. But what doesn't
[1:19:34] experience fear from time to time? I'm
[1:19:37] not talking about, you know, just scared
[1:19:40] for the moment or
[1:19:43] but there's a lot of fear.
[1:19:53] Fear is not sin. Jesus didn't say and
[1:19:55] the Bible doesn't say that fear is sin.
[1:19:59] It's not sin that's on the altar of the
[1:20:01] heart.
[1:20:03] But when fear is there, faith can't be
[1:20:06] there.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And so now uh uh that fear has to be
[1:20:12] removed. And after Wednesday service, I
[1:20:14] spoke to three or four people
[1:20:17] right on that very subject.
[1:20:20] It's not that fear person fears
[1:20:22] something. It's not that that fear is
[1:20:24] sin, but that fear keeps faith away
[1:20:28] because you can't have fear and faith at
[1:20:30] the same time. And so that needs to be
[1:20:33] burned up on the altar so that faith can
[1:20:38] come and then through the faith you have
[1:20:40] faith in the promise and you can receive
[1:20:42] the answer.
[1:20:45] I just said that I'm I'm going to go on
[1:20:47] from there. This is why in the Bible and
[1:20:50] I'm going quickly. Don't try to turn to
[1:20:52] these scriptures. Matthew 10:28, "And
[1:20:55] fear not them which kill the body but
[1:20:57] are not able to kill the soul." Matthew
[1:21:00] 28:5, "Fear not, fear not ye, for I know
[1:21:04] that you seek Jesus which was which was
[1:21:07] crucified." Luke 1:13, "Fear not,
[1:21:10] Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard."
[1:21:14] Luke 1:30, "And the angel said,"Fear
[1:21:16] not, Mary, for thou hast found favor
[1:21:18] with God." Luke 2 and10, "Fear not,
[1:21:21] behold, I bring you tidings of good
[1:21:24] joy." Luke 8:50, "Fear not, behold.
[1:21:27] Believe only, and she shall be made
[1:21:30] whole." Luke 12:7, "Fear not, thou
[1:21:33] therefore, ye are more value than many
[1:21:37] sparrows." Acts 27 and 24 saying, "Fear
[1:21:42] not, Paul. Thou must be brought before
[1:21:46] Caesar." Why are these introductions
[1:21:49] always, "Fear not. Fear not." Brother
[1:21:50] Brandham said, "Exactly." He said
[1:21:52] whenever I hear that voice it always
[1:21:54] comes says fear not fear not I'll be
[1:21:58] with you. Why? Because the heart is very
[1:22:01] susceptible to all kinds of fears and
[1:22:04] anxieties and questions. And the Lord
[1:22:07] would say today to this congregation,
[1:22:10] fear not.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I've come.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:22:19] We don't need to be dictated to by the
[1:22:21] the the society and the civilization
[1:22:24] that we presently live in. We have a God
[1:22:26] who's in control. A God who's in charge
[1:22:30] of every situation. Things may be going
[1:22:33] sideways. You may say, "Oh, Brother Ed,
[1:22:35] but you don't know where I'm at." I
[1:22:36] really don't care where you're at right
[1:22:38] now because my focus is on God who's in
[1:22:41] charge of absolutely everything. There
[1:22:43] isn't anything that he cannot do.
[1:22:45] Hallelujah. And if you fear then the
[1:22:48] thing that fear you fear so much can
[1:22:51] come upon you or does come upon us.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; In Revelation 11:17,
[1:23:01] when I saw him, I fell at his feet as
[1:23:04] dead, and he laid his right hand upon
[1:23:07] me, saying unto me his first words to
[1:23:09] John in the revelation, fear not. I'm
[1:23:13] the first and the last. Hallelujah. If
[1:23:16] you hear a voice and had a personal
[1:23:18] visitation and feel a hand laid upon you
[1:23:21] and hear a voice saying, "Fear not. I'm
[1:23:24] the first and the last." That means he's
[1:23:27] also everything in between. I'm the
[1:23:29] first and I'm the last and I'm
[1:23:31] everything in between. He's the first of
[1:23:34] your experience. He's the last of your
[1:23:36] experience. And he's everything in
[1:23:38] between. Hallelujah. He knows right
[1:23:40] where you are now. He knows right where
[1:23:42] you are in your journey. He knows
[1:23:44] exactly the footstep you're standing in
[1:23:46] now. And he's in control of it because
[1:23:48] he's the first and the last. Hallelujah.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:23:55] And last but not least,
[1:23:58] fear not little flock.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's the father's good pleasure
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; to give you the kingdom.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Are those sweet words?
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Fear not, little flock. It's the
[1:24:12] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:24:14] kingdom. Fear not, brother Ben Brandham
[1:24:17] says, "And believe ye that I can do
[1:24:19] this." Fear not. Do not fear. Don't
[1:24:22] fear. Don't do that. If you do, then God
[1:24:25] can't work with you. If you do believe,
[1:24:29] then God can work with you. If you fear,
[1:24:31] God can't work with you. If you believe,
[1:24:34] God can work with you. It's just that
[1:24:36] simple.
[1:24:40] A person's heart can be deeply stirred.
[1:24:44] Psalm the David, David the Psalmist
[1:24:46] said, "My heart was hot within me. While
[1:24:49] I was musing, the fire burned. Then
[1:24:53] spake I with my tongue. Lord, make me to
[1:24:56] know mine end and the measure of my
[1:24:59] days. What it is that I may know how
[1:25:03] frail I am."
[1:25:06] David said again where we have the
[1:25:08] chorus, create in me a clean heart, oh
[1:25:11] God.
[1:25:13] Perhaps you don't recall the scripture
[1:25:16] because we sing it
[1:25:19] too glibly.
[1:25:23] Next time you sing it, you should think
[1:25:26] about really what it is saying.
[1:25:29] Create in me a clean heart. May my altar
[1:25:32] be clean, oh God, and renew, restore.
[1:25:36] The same word, renew here is exactly the
[1:25:40] same word in Malachi 5 and6. And he
[1:25:43] shall turn the heart of the children
[1:25:46] back to the fathers. Renew, restore,
[1:25:49] refresh, renew the right spirit within
[1:25:53] me. Cast me not away from thy presence,
[1:25:56] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:25:59] restore the same word once again to turn
[1:26:03] back. Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:26:05] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:26:09] spirit. And then a very important word,
[1:26:12] then
[1:26:14] then will I teach transgressors their
[1:26:16] ways.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Not when we're all nervous and agitated
[1:26:21] or anything else or we're, you know, I
[1:26:23] I've got to get this message to them.
[1:26:25] I've got to tell them. I've got to, you
[1:26:26] know, pronounce uh their their what it
[1:26:30] is that they believe and what the error
[1:26:32] of their way. No. Create in me a clean
[1:26:35] heart.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Restore my spirit.
[1:26:39] Renew in me a right spirit and then I'll
[1:26:43] teach transgressors their ways.
[1:26:49] There's probably,
[1:26:52] I think, about 2,000
[1:26:55] times
[1:26:57] where the prophet of God said, "Believe
[1:26:59] with all your heart."
[1:27:02] All your heart.
[1:27:05] And all simply is the entire substance.
[1:27:10] Believe with all your heart. You know,
[1:27:14] friends,
[1:27:15] you're listening very nicely,
[1:27:18] but I say if this congregation here
[1:27:20] today could just move everything else
[1:27:23] out of the way and begin believing even
[1:27:26] the simplest word, the simplest promise
[1:27:29] with all your heart and move everything
[1:27:31] else. Say, "Oh, fire of God, just
[1:27:34] annihilate. Burn up every other thing
[1:27:36] that's on my heart, everything that's
[1:27:39] removed, and let me just believe with
[1:27:41] all my heart. Let me be consumed with
[1:27:43] belief. Let me be consumed with faith.
[1:27:46] Let it be on my heart that all I can do.
[1:27:48] I can't even think of anything else but
[1:27:50] believing the promise. Believing the
[1:27:52] promise.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; The promise of today. The promise of
[1:27:55] this hour. Not necessarily my personal
[1:27:57] need. But may I believe with all my
[1:27:59] heart. And may my heart simply be filled
[1:28:01] with faith.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't even be have to be prayed for.
[1:28:06] It wouldn't even be that you'd need
[1:28:07] hands pray later on. You wouldn't need
[1:28:09] you wouldn't need anything. You'll just
[1:28:11] begin receiving things right where
[1:28:12] you're at because there'll be such a
[1:28:14] such a a an atmosphere of faith. I
[1:28:18] believe if the prophet was standing here
[1:28:19] and say this, the whole room has become
[1:28:21] milky because people begin to see God is
[1:28:24] doing things. God is present doing
[1:28:28] things.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Is God bigger than your problem?
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Is God bigger than your concern?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Is God bigger than the thing that's
[1:28:37] occupied your heart and your altar?
[1:28:39] Hallelujah. Has God proven himself
[1:28:42] before? That same God is here presently
[1:28:45] now and will do for you what needs to be
[1:28:48] done. We need to say, "Thy will be
[1:28:50] done." Not my will, thy will be done.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:59] The entire substance, all your heart,
[1:29:02] the utmost possible, the entire
[1:29:06] complete. That's what all is.
[1:29:13] In the message of the resurrection,
[1:29:15] he says, "I believe that God would save
[1:29:17] every sinner, fill every saint, and fix
[1:29:19] fix us up for the rapture.
[1:29:22] I believe that, too. Believest thou
[1:29:25] this.
[1:29:27] I believe that God would save every
[1:29:30] sinner." If there's an unbeliever here,
[1:29:32] I believe that God would save you.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; If you just believe it now,
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; believe what? I was born in sin, shaped
[1:29:42] iniquities. I came into the world
[1:29:45] condemned, but Jesus Christ died on
[1:29:48] Calvary, and I accept I accept that
[1:29:50] sacrifice for myself. You'll be saved.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Are you here? You're bound. Are you
[1:29:58] here? bound by habit, bound by fear,
[1:30:02] bound by something. That same God will
[1:30:06] not not tomorrow, not some big process
[1:30:08] would deliver you right now.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to bring people to
[1:30:12] the point. He's a God that does things.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You see, if you only get it mentally,
[1:30:19] God doesn't get any glory out of that.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; But when you get it in your heart and
[1:30:24] faith is there and then God can answer
[1:30:27] to that faith, then he's he's able to do
[1:30:30] it
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; and then his name is glorified and
[1:30:34] that's what God wants. He wants to be
[1:30:36] glorified
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; by what happens
[1:30:49] after the resurrection of Jesus
[1:30:52] and the two on the way to Emmas and they
[1:30:54] said one to another
[1:30:57] did not our heart burn
[1:31:00] within us
[1:31:02] while he talked to us in the
[1:31:05] I'm not interested in a fancy service or
[1:31:09] fancy message.
[1:31:11] I'm especially gripped. I'm consumed. If
[1:31:14] you ask what's on my altar today, I say,
[1:31:16] "Oh, God, I'm I'm clinging to your
[1:31:19] promise that whatsoever things we desire
[1:31:22] when we pray,
[1:31:24] we believe and you'll do it. I have
[1:31:26] already prayed. I prayed earnestly, God.
[1:31:32] May your presence come so amongst the
[1:31:35] people. And may the supernatural just
[1:31:38] begin to take place as the word is
[1:31:40] preached. May the Holy Spirit take that
[1:31:43] word and anchor it right into your heart
[1:31:46] so that everything else moves out of the
[1:31:48] way. And the only thing that's on your
[1:31:50] heart is the promise of God. And I
[1:31:52] believe this promise. All things are
[1:31:54] possible. He said, did he not say it?
[1:31:57] All things are possible. Only believe.
[1:32:00] Only believe. only believe. Believe with
[1:32:03] all your heart entirely allconsuming
[1:32:07] faith
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; and then God comes on the scene. God
[1:32:13] begins to do it. You have to also
[1:32:14] believe that God's waiting to do it.
[1:32:17] God's standing ready to do it.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And I would feel it would be such an
[1:32:22] insult to walk in with your burden and
[1:32:25] walk out with that burden when God
[1:32:28] stands here already.
[1:32:30] Hallelujah.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; I'll give him praise.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; His spirit is here. His word is here.
[1:32:39] His servants are here. Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Did not our heart burn within us as he
[1:32:48] spoke to us in the way. And brother
[1:32:50] Brandham made makes reference to that in
[1:32:52] modern events. One of the last services
[1:32:54] he only had a few days that he remained
[1:32:56] here after that. And he said they said
[1:32:59] no wonder. And he said no wonder their
[1:33:01] hearts burned. The prophecies that were
[1:33:04] that he was giving that was fulfilled.
[1:33:07] The prophecies that he was giving them
[1:33:10] speaking of himself out of the scripture
[1:33:13] they were they had been fulfilled. And
[1:33:15] that's what made their hearts burn. And
[1:33:18] my brothers and sisters here today, you
[1:33:22] don't always know what it is that's
[1:33:24] causing your heart to burn, to be a
[1:33:27] stirring deep within you. You may not
[1:33:29] always know what that is because we're
[1:33:32] maybe too focused on our little world.
[1:33:35] But what is causing your heart to burn
[1:33:37] is because the scriptures,
[1:33:40] the promises for this day are being
[1:33:43] fulfilled. Even when we're not aware of
[1:33:45] it,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; they're being fulfilled. And the Holy
[1:33:49] Spirit is causing your heart to burn.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; We may not be aware of it. You may not
[1:33:54] know it at all, but that's what's doing
[1:33:57] it.
[1:34:00] Their hearts burned within them as he
[1:34:03] talked with them
[1:34:05] in the way.
[1:34:07] Now the rest of the service
[1:34:10] I want to come to
[1:34:14] this altar
[1:34:16] and a very very significant thing and
[1:34:19] you'll need to loose your minds and your
[1:34:22] thoughts and I trust that there'll be no
[1:34:24] restriction there.
[1:34:26] When we hear
[1:34:29] the term altar
[1:34:31] we immediately think of sacrifice. We
[1:34:35] connect it to sacrifice.
[1:34:39] And we cannot say sacrifice
[1:34:43] without envisioning something being
[1:34:45] offered,
[1:34:47] something being given. Something has got
[1:34:49] to be given. When we think of sacrifice
[1:34:53] and the first instance of a sacrifice
[1:34:56] ever being given
[1:34:58] was God himself
[1:35:02] when his son Adam and his wife Eve were
[1:35:07] found fallen and naked.
[1:35:14] It's curious.
[1:35:17] Their fig leaves were not good enough,
[1:35:20] not sufficient.
[1:35:22] But it's very curious that it took blood
[1:35:26] to be shed.
[1:35:29] That God, the creator, who actually
[1:35:32] created the creature,
[1:35:35] would now destroy the creature
[1:35:38] just to accommodate
[1:35:40] the covering for Adam and Eve. So
[1:35:44] there's something here right away.
[1:35:48] Something here
[1:35:51] that needs to be addressed very deeply
[1:35:55] that God out of his mind now is
[1:35:58] unfolding in the creation
[1:36:00] and blood has been spilled. God himself
[1:36:03] allowed blood to be spilled on the earth
[1:36:07] just to get some skins to cover a fallen
[1:36:11] son and his wife.
[1:36:19] Brother Brandham describes almost in
[1:36:21] poetic language
[1:36:24] them being expelled expelled out of Eve,
[1:36:28] out of Eden.
[1:36:30] He said they're walking
[1:36:33] and the skins are slapping against
[1:36:37] Adam's manly legs
[1:36:40] and running down
[1:36:42] Eve's bosom.
[1:36:45] and she leans her head over onto his
[1:36:48] shoulder as they walk out in this most
[1:36:52] sad moment
[1:36:54] and said tears start tears. They haven't
[1:36:58] known what tears are.
[1:37:00] They've never been sad.
[1:37:04] Their heart has never been affected like
[1:37:05] that. But tears start coming down Eve's
[1:37:09] face
[1:37:10] and brother Brenham just says so
[1:37:13] marvelously
[1:37:16] they can cry now
[1:37:20] that's such a profound thing that God
[1:37:24] had shed some blood to make this
[1:37:27] possible
[1:37:28] and then as we move from that scene
[1:37:33] two sons are born twins
[1:37:36] Cain the eldest in Abel.
[1:37:39] And I read it out of the Hebrew Bible.
[1:37:42] And brother Brandham says so plainly,
[1:37:44] she didn't conceive again. She bore
[1:37:46] again in Genesis 4 and2. And Adam knew
[1:37:52] his wife. Genesis 4:1. And Adam knew his
[1:37:54] wife and she conceived and bare a son
[1:37:56] called his name Cain. For I've received
[1:37:58] a man from the Lord. And of course she
[1:37:59] got it from the Lord. It wouldn't it
[1:38:01] wouldn't matter who gives birth. Whether
[1:38:04] it be a prostitute or whether it be an
[1:38:06] illegitimate child or what it is, God
[1:38:08] gave life.
[1:38:10] God gave the child life.
[1:38:13] And again, and it says, "And she again
[1:38:15] bore." And the Hebrew says she continued
[1:38:18] to bear
[1:38:20] Abel.
[1:38:24] Abel was a keeper of the flock
[1:38:27] and Cain was a tiller of the ground.
[1:38:32] And if we hadn't if we didn't have the
[1:38:34] message, we wouldn't understand it like
[1:38:36] this. But now I'm tying it. I'm just
[1:38:37] sewing it completely with the message.
[1:38:41] Says Abel had a revelation
[1:38:45] that it was blood.
[1:38:49] How did Abel even know that there was
[1:38:52] blood in that animal?
[1:38:56] And how did he know? or how was he even
[1:38:59] inclined
[1:39:01] that that somehow
[1:39:03] should be on an altar?
[1:39:06] Now, the Bible doesn't say that Abel
[1:39:08] built an altar or and Cain built an
[1:39:10] altar, but it says that they both
[1:39:12] brought their their sacrifice to God.
[1:39:15] And brother Brandham said they both
[1:39:17] built an altar and they both worshiped.
[1:39:20] They paid their tithes. In other words,
[1:39:22] they were giving of their of their
[1:39:24] material possessions. and Cain and
[1:39:28] brought his the fruit of his field and
[1:39:31] Abel and that was the only difference
[1:39:34] between the two. Abel had a revelation.
[1:39:37] Now I want you to catch this. The
[1:39:40] revelation he had
[1:39:45] was he was now going to present
[1:39:47] something on earth that was going to
[1:39:49] reflect something that was in heaven.
[1:39:52] Now, just be real still.
[1:39:55] In heaven, there was a lamb slain before
[1:39:58] the foundation of the world.
[1:40:01] But I guarantee you, it was not a
[1:40:03] chemistry of blood.
[1:40:06] Not the chemistry of blood that was
[1:40:08] flowing in that animal or even flowing
[1:40:10] in Abel's veins or yours this morning.
[1:40:14] But in the in the mind of God and what
[1:40:17] form that took, I do not know. But I am
[1:40:20] saying I do not believe that it was
[1:40:23] blood in the sense of the blood that's
[1:40:25] in your veins. It just says he was the
[1:40:27] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:40:30] world and that was a heavenly scene.
[1:40:34] How God projected that in heaven, I do
[1:40:38] not know. And it might have been there
[1:40:40] for hundreds of millions of years. Or
[1:40:42] when God thought that thought,
[1:40:45] when God established that that there was
[1:40:48] a a lamb slain, a lamb slain in heaven
[1:40:53] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:40:56] now walks a little man creeping on the
[1:40:59] earth. His name is Abel. And he has some
[1:41:03] revelation that somehow what is flowing
[1:41:06] in the veins of that animal will answer
[1:41:09] to that which is in heaven. He probably
[1:41:12] had no concept that that was in heaven.
[1:41:15] But he had something inside of him in
[1:41:18] his being in his heart. I I want to give
[1:41:21] this animal. What a strange thing. We we
[1:41:24] we get we get impulses friends to to do
[1:41:27] certain things. And when we know that
[1:41:30] it's from God, we know that it's not
[1:41:33] from up here. We know that it's
[1:41:35] something from within. Then we know that
[1:41:38] God by his by his holy spirit, by his
[1:41:42] spirit is revealing something. And so
[1:41:44] Cain now uh Abel rather, Abel slays an
[1:41:48] animal and offers it on his altar. And
[1:41:52] the blood that's in that animal now is
[1:41:54] an actual material substance which came
[1:41:58] by the word of God.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; It's in animal form.
[1:42:06] But God brought all of these things by
[1:42:09] his word.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And his word produced the substance. And
[1:42:14] the substance now by revelation has been
[1:42:18] placed upon an altar.
[1:42:20] And God looked upon that not because he
[1:42:24] would say, "I'm pleased that an animal
[1:42:27] has lost its life or I'm pleased that
[1:42:29] there's a substance on the on the uh on
[1:42:33] the altar." It was that now what was
[1:42:36] being reflected on earth was precisely
[1:42:40] what was in heaven. And the Bible says
[1:42:42] that God had respect to Abel's sacrifice
[1:42:47] and didn't have respect to Cain's. Not
[1:42:50] because God was saying, "I love one and
[1:42:52] I hate the other." Not because you're
[1:42:55] saved, you're lost. But this one by
[1:42:57] revelation was producing on earth what
[1:43:01] God had already established in heaven.
[1:43:04] And he said, "I accept that.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; That's what has already been in my
[1:43:10] program." That's an extension of what
[1:43:12] I've already had in my mind. And I have
[1:43:15] to I have to respect that.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And the blood that was on the altar
[1:43:21] was a product of the word of God
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; because God had had said, "Let the earth
[1:43:27] bring forth."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Is that not so?
[1:43:32] Now the scripture that we use so
[1:43:34] frequently
[1:43:37] in the beginning John 1 and1 in the
[1:43:39] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:43:41] with God and the word was God and all
[1:43:44] things were made by him and without him
[1:43:46] was nothing made that is made
[1:43:49] and and the 14th verse and the word was
[1:43:53] made
[1:43:55] flesh.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh. I will say the
[1:44:01] word was made muscles. The word was made
[1:44:05] skin. The word was made a heart. The
[1:44:10] word was made
[1:44:13] blood.
[1:44:15] And he dwelt among us. And the word was
[1:44:17] made flesh, was it not?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was that body.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; The fullness of God was in him
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; and he shed blood. And I'll never forget
[1:44:34] the service many years ago back in the
[1:44:37] log church that Brother Lance preached
[1:44:40] and he said, "Even if we had a vial of
[1:44:44] the blood from Calvary,
[1:44:47] it would not save you. Even if we had it
[1:44:50] right here at the pull pit, if we had a
[1:44:53] vial of that blood, and I could
[1:44:54] guarantee you and say, "This has been
[1:44:57] carried on down through the centuries.
[1:44:58] This is the very blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:00] of Nazareth. You could hold it in your
[1:45:03] hand. You could dip it on your forehead.
[1:45:04] You could do what you want, but it
[1:45:06] wouldn't save you."
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh.
[1:45:14] And it was the men and the women who
[1:45:17] believed the word that that man spoke.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; It was still down to faith. They had to
[1:45:23] believe it. Now I still have a little
[1:45:26] distance to go.
[1:45:30] So now whatever was in heaven
[1:45:35] became a a red chemistry substance on
[1:45:38] earth
[1:45:40] that Abel offered on an altar.
[1:45:44] And I don't know the form of the altar
[1:45:46] whether it's wood or stone or what it
[1:45:48] was but he offers on an altar. And God
[1:45:50] looked upon it and God accepted it and
[1:45:54] had respect to it.
[1:45:57] And thus when Moses came on the scene,
[1:46:01] God begins to establish now not by one
[1:46:04] man but into a whole nation begin to say
[1:46:07] you build an altar. It'll anoint the
[1:46:09] altar. You put a sacrifice on the altar.
[1:46:12] You'll have a bullock and this where
[1:46:13] you'll offer and you'll offer this and
[1:46:15] you'll offer the fat for a peace
[1:46:17] offering. You'll offer this kind of
[1:46:18] offering. You'll offer a meal offering.
[1:46:20] Have this altar. You have that altar.
[1:46:22] But all the altar spoke of a sacrifice.
[1:46:26] and they altered. Then when they had a
[1:46:27] sin offering or a burnt offering, the
[1:46:30] thing was consumed. You'll take the
[1:46:32] blood and in the basin and you'll
[1:46:34] sprinkle it here and you'll sprinkle
[1:46:35] around the altar. And the whole thing
[1:46:38] spoke of redemption. The whole thing
[1:46:40] spoke of reconciliation.
[1:46:42] And now I I just need you to see this,
[1:46:44] but please establish this in your mind.
[1:46:47] when when Abel was so abs so consumed
[1:46:52] that he would take if I could describe
[1:46:54] that for you young people take and and
[1:46:56] and there had to be a moment in time
[1:47:00] when this young man stood out looking
[1:47:03] over his flock because he was a he was a
[1:47:06] a keeper of the flocks and he stood out
[1:47:09] over his flock and something laid a hold
[1:47:11] of him. Something took a hold of him
[1:47:14] that he could not control and he took he
[1:47:18] took one of his flock and something in
[1:47:21] him to take the life of this animal
[1:47:25] because
[1:47:26] the reason why I don't propose to have
[1:47:29] all the answers but I'm going to give
[1:47:31] you my answer. The reason why because
[1:47:34] this had to be an answer number one to
[1:47:38] the expulsion of his parents just now
[1:47:43] out of Eden. That this blood was going
[1:47:46] to say we've been separated. This blood
[1:47:48] is going to say there's been sin. This
[1:47:51] blood is going to answer to the sin
[1:47:54] which was a blood sin, a sexual sin.
[1:47:57] It's got to answer to the sin and it
[1:48:00] also has to answer to the
[1:48:02] reconciliation.
[1:48:03] And so both of them met in that
[1:48:05] sacrifice.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I feel like preaching.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It answered to the sin. It
[1:48:12] answered to the expulsion. The blood
[1:48:14] said we've been separated. But the blood
[1:48:17] also said we're going to be united
[1:48:19] again.
[1:48:22] Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; And thus God continued it with Moses and
[1:48:28] they offered
[1:48:31] until some people have difficulty
[1:48:32] reading the Old Testament because they
[1:48:33] said it was it's such a slaying of
[1:48:36] animals and sacrifices and that it was.
[1:48:40] And so now we have the chemistry and now
[1:48:41] we move on through to when here come the
[1:48:46] word made flesh.
[1:48:49] The word made flesh and the word caused
[1:48:54] that man called Jesus Christ to do
[1:48:57] absolutely everything that had already
[1:49:00] been spoken of in the scripture. And so
[1:49:03] as Jesus moved about, it was Isaiah's
[1:49:06] prophecy. It was a prophecy through uh
[1:49:10] David the psalmist. It was moving,
[1:49:13] moving, moving. And he took his steps.
[1:49:15] It was actually the word in flesh moving
[1:49:18] him and then that blood is given. Now
[1:49:21] the blood is a chemistry and the blood
[1:49:25] goes to the earth and in the mind of God
[1:49:28] the earth is claimed back because now
[1:49:31] this blood it didn't come from the first
[1:49:34] creation. This blood came from a new
[1:49:36] creation.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; This blood was the beginning of another
[1:49:39] creation.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; This blood was the beginning of a super
[1:49:42] race.
[1:49:49] You're not following me.
[1:49:52] Praise the Lord. 100%.
[1:50:00] This blood now is the word in flesh
[1:50:06] and by wicked and cruel hands he is
[1:50:08] slain. And that blood spills on the
[1:50:11] earth.
[1:50:12] And oh, how I love what the prophet
[1:50:15] says. Your body, I don't care who you
[1:50:16] are. I don't care what you believe. I
[1:50:18] don't care where you come from. I don't
[1:50:20] care where your birth and your lineage
[1:50:21] is from. Your body was laying on the
[1:50:23] earth in the substance of the earth. The
[1:50:25] very chemistry of your body was laying
[1:50:28] in the earth when the very blood of
[1:50:30] Jesus Christ was spilled on the ground
[1:50:32] and God was claiming every single one
[1:50:34] that was his own on that day.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; What was it?
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brother Brandham says,
[1:50:41] "And he climbed up on his altar, the
[1:50:43] cross." He climbed up on that wooden
[1:50:45] altar to offer himself for you and for
[1:50:49] me.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; He climbed on his altar.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; And the altar had to have a sacrifice.
[1:50:58] And the altar had to have blood.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And there he died.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; To reconcile us.
[1:51:08] And that blood was acknowledging these
[1:51:11] people have been separated. These people
[1:51:14] have been expelled out of that which God
[1:51:17] had intended. But this blood will
[1:51:20] reunite them back again with their
[1:51:23] creator, with God.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; And it'll be a complete reuniting. It's
[1:51:29] not going to be in want of anything.
[1:51:30] It's be a complete union.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; It's going to be like a husband and wife
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; union.
[1:51:38] Hallelujah.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Now watch it.
[1:52:06] So when God looked on Jesus Christ
[1:52:10] and saw the blood that was spilled and
[1:52:12] water and blood came out,
[1:52:16] when God saw that,
[1:52:21] what was it that he was satisfied with
[1:52:24] when it satisfied
[1:52:27] the judgment
[1:52:29] of God?
[1:52:32] That's swimming water, folks.
[1:52:36] I want your full attention.
[1:52:40] Whatever the lamb that was slain before
[1:52:42] the foundation of the world, I don't
[1:52:44] know what the substance was, but I I'm
[1:52:48] certain it was not it wasn't a lamb.
[1:52:52] It wasn't the physical chemistry of the
[1:52:54] blood that was on the altar in heaven,
[1:52:58] but it it it changed its form. It it
[1:53:00] became that.
[1:53:03] And Abel now is slaying an animal, but
[1:53:06] actually when God looked on it, he just
[1:53:08] saw his word.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And he saw a man who believed it by
[1:53:12] revelation. He didn't believe it by any
[1:53:15] other thing. He didn't have a book. He
[1:53:16] didn't have the Torah. He didn't have
[1:53:18] the Bible. He didn't have anything. He
[1:53:20] had had no prophets before him. He had
[1:53:22] no instruction before him. He was doing
[1:53:24] it be because of the impulse of God and
[1:53:28] giving revelation. And so now now he
[1:53:31] takes a substance which is completely
[1:53:33] foreign
[1:53:35] foreign to anything. I mean even killing
[1:53:37] an animal was foreign. The whole thing
[1:53:39] was foreign but he takes it. But when
[1:53:41] God looks on it now what was it that God
[1:53:43] was looking at? This is a very important
[1:53:45] I'm going to close in about 10 15
[1:53:47] minutes but listen very close. So what
[1:53:49] was it that God was looking at? He had
[1:53:51] respect to that. Now that was an animal
[1:53:54] blood. Now we got a man and the man is
[1:53:58] Jesus Christ and he's the spotless son
[1:54:00] of God and he's shedding physical blood.
[1:54:03] Now he's shedding human blood. But this
[1:54:06] blood this blood came from a conception
[1:54:09] in the womb of a virgin. And that
[1:54:11] conception took place because the
[1:54:14] prophets prophesied it wasn't it wasn't
[1:54:16] Isaiah's words. It was thus saith the
[1:54:20] Lord behold a virgin shall conceive. And
[1:54:24] because thus sayeth the Lord, God who
[1:54:27] spoke the word and brought the animal
[1:54:30] that Abel slew, that same God was
[1:54:32] speaking his word through a man's mouth
[1:54:35] called Isaiah. And those words flowed
[1:54:37] through time for 800 years thereabouts.
[1:54:41] And they and the prophet says those
[1:54:42] words lodged in the womb of a woman
[1:54:45] called Mary, a little girl called Mary.
[1:54:48] Those words launched in her womb because
[1:54:51] she said, "Be it unto me according to
[1:54:55] thy word." And the word became substance
[1:54:58] in her womb.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth Jesus Christ, the
[1:55:03] son of God. And it was that son who was
[1:55:06] at Calvary because now the word was made
[1:55:09] flesh. And it was the word that bled.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; It was the bleeding word. Amen.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And then he released his spirit and that
[1:55:18] spirit came down into the church and the
[1:55:21] church now a body of people, a group of
[1:55:24] people were born by the spirit of God
[1:55:28] and that spirit of God began to make
[1:55:31] alive the word of God to them and they
[1:55:34] began on the altar of their heart began
[1:55:37] to believe that word
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; and thus it was the word that was
[1:55:44] bleeding.
[1:55:45] and had to be on the altar. And when God
[1:55:48] looked upon that, said it didn't make
[1:55:50] any difference what age they were. It
[1:55:52] didn't make any difference what language
[1:55:54] they came from. Didn't matter what
[1:55:55] country they came from. If they believed
[1:55:58] the word, God looked upon the altar of
[1:56:01] the heart and saw the blood,
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; saw the sacrifice.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Be it unto thee
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; according to your faith.
[1:56:14] Be it unto thee, not according to your
[1:56:16] mind, not according to your reasoning.
[1:56:17] Be it unto you according to your faith,
[1:56:20] this morning, not yesterday, not
[1:56:22] tomorrow, now,
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; today. What can you believe for?
[1:56:26] Whatever you can believe for, you can
[1:56:28] have because God will look upon that
[1:56:30] sacrifice and he'll see that blood.
[1:56:33] He'll say that that debt has been paid
[1:56:35] for.
[1:56:38] If you had an error, if you had
[1:56:40] something you need to make right, if you
[1:56:42] have some fear, you have some anxiety,
[1:56:44] you all you need to do is believe the
[1:56:46] word because it's the word that's
[1:56:48] bleeding on your behalf.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; And God's not going to look on the fear.
[1:56:54] He's not going to look on these other
[1:56:55] things. He's going to look on the
[1:56:57] sacrifice.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; It's the word that has the promise. It's
[1:57:05] the word that's a sacrifice. It's the
[1:57:07] word that's bleeding.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; I've shown you it's been it's been the
[1:57:12] word even though the lamb slain before
[1:57:14] the foundation of the world, a a lamb
[1:57:17] creature slain on earth by Abel or Jesus
[1:57:20] Christ upon a cross or the word now in
[1:57:23] your heart. They are synonymous.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I've taken you from eternity back to
[1:57:30] eternity. And you'll go in rapture
[1:57:32] because of what's on your altar.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; That is the rapture. You'll go in a body
[1:57:41] change because of the promise that's in
[1:57:43] the word of God and what you believe
[1:57:45] concerning it.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; What you believe concerning this, what's
[1:57:50] on your altar, that's what God's going
[1:57:52] to have respect to.
[1:57:55] A lot of people lay a graveyard friends
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; and one will go and many others will
[1:58:01] not. And one over there and one over
[1:58:03] there. What's going to bring them out?
[1:58:05] It depends what they went in their grave
[1:58:08] with on their altar.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; They went into the grave believing
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; there was blood on the altar when they
[1:58:17] went to the grave. And God will have
[1:58:19] respect to them and respect to this one.
[1:58:21] And they'll come up in the resurrection.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And you have a token today. The prophet
[1:58:35] could call you sinless
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; because he said you possess the token in
[1:58:40] you.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; That's why I could preach the other
[1:58:45] Sunday. There isn't anybody here hasn't
[1:58:47] got flaws.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Flaws. We have flaws. failures,
[1:58:52] weaknesses that we're ashamed of and
[1:58:54] perhaps even hate ourselves for it. But
[1:58:57] God sees, he sees, he knows those flaws.
[1:59:00] But you have a sacrifice. You have a
[1:59:03] bleeding word.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; It's his word that's bleeding, friends.
[1:59:08] It was his word in heaven. It was his
[1:59:11] word in Eden. It was his word throughout
[1:59:13] the Old Testament. And it's his word.
[1:59:16] And if you don't have that, you're lost.
[1:59:20] If you don't believe that, you're lost.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; But that by believing that God God looks
[1:59:26] upon that and has respect to it.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother David. May you
[1:59:32] receive what God has promised you.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; We're here for God to do things.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; We want God to do things.
[1:59:44] I want God to annihilate and burn up the
[1:59:47] thing that's on your altar, the thing
[1:59:49] that's consumed you, the thing that has
[1:59:52] labor, been laboring on your heart. Let
[1:59:54] God have it.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Let God have it.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Let the doubts be gone in the name of
[2:00:01] Jesus Christ. Let the questions
[2:00:03] disappear in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:12] That's why he called it the bleeding
[2:00:13] word.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; The word bled for you
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; in the invisible union of the bride of
[2:00:19] Jesus Christ. And that's where he could
[2:00:20] say in the same message, you're the
[2:00:23] spotless.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Spotless, virtuous
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; bride of the lamb of God.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; How?
[2:00:32] Only by his word.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Only by his word. Not memorizing some
[2:00:35] scripture, but by his word. by the
[2:00:38] impulse of God in this hour. By the
[2:00:42] impulse for you to believe the promise.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to that witnesses.
[2:00:52] Listen to that impulse this morning.
[2:00:54] Listen to it. There's no hope outside of
[2:00:56] it.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:14] In the midst of the elders
[2:01:17] stood a lamb
[2:01:19] as it had been slain.
[2:01:26] In the fifth chapter,
[2:01:28] Revelation, worthy is the lamb that was
[2:01:32] slain.
[2:01:34] And in the 13th chapter, all that dwell
[2:01:38] upon the earth shall worship him. That's
[2:01:41] the beast. All that dwell on the earth.
[2:01:45] Hello, earth dwellers.
[2:01:48] We're going to be in one of two
[2:01:49] categories.
[2:01:51] We're going to worship the beast or
[2:01:53] worship the lamb that was slain before
[2:01:55] the foundation of the world. And that is
[2:01:57] the word. He is the word. We worship the
[2:02:00] word.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; We worship Christ. not a figment of our
[2:02:04] imagination. People try to think who
[2:02:06] Jesus is, who Christ is. Christ is the
[2:02:09] word. He's the spoken word of God.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; And thus we lay down our lives and we
[2:02:17] give ourselves unreservedly.
[2:02:21] He said, "And they whose names are not
[2:02:23] written in the book of life of the lamb
[2:02:26] that was slain before the foundation of
[2:02:29] the world."
[2:02:31] There was a man that Brother Brandon was
[2:02:33] answering to and he spoke I believe he
[2:02:36] had a large radio following, radio
[2:02:38] broadcast following
[2:02:40] and he said that there was no
[2:02:43] no blood in heaven or something like
[2:02:45] that, no sacrifice.
[2:02:48] And he said his answer was if there
[2:02:50] isn't no sacrifice on the altar then the
[2:02:54] prayers cannot be received.
[2:02:58] Oh, I'm glad to announce to you the
[2:03:01] authority of God's infallible word.
[2:03:05] There's a sacrifice. Whether it has a
[2:03:07] physical blood is irrelevant to me. What
[2:03:10] substance it is is irrelevant to me. But
[2:03:12] I can tell you one thing, the word, the
[2:03:15] word of God has declared that it's
[2:03:18] there.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And we come on the basis that the word
[2:03:22] has said so.
[2:03:26] Someone might say, "Well, that's being
[2:03:28] gullible." Well, I can tell you what.
[2:03:30] It's amazing that being gullible works
[2:03:32] as well as it does.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; It works.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; People believe and the supernatural
[2:03:39] happens. I say I say what they believe
[2:03:42] then was absolutely correct because
[2:03:45] someone God supernatural came in behind
[2:03:49] and did it.
[2:04:06] If there's no sacrifice, the prayers
[2:04:07] can't be received. He said, "It's only
[2:04:10] by the blood on the sacrificial altar
[2:04:13] that lets the prayers go through to
[2:04:17] God."
[2:04:18] We don't have to know for certain just
[2:04:21] what form,
[2:04:24] what substance. That's really
[2:04:26] irrelevant. But the one thing that we
[2:04:28] must convey to you this morning,
[2:04:32] it's absolutely essential.
[2:04:35] Absolutely essential. In fact, is it's
[2:04:37] imperative
[2:04:40] that you believe the word that God has
[2:04:43] sent.
[2:04:45] And I'm closing just now.
[2:04:55] I'll say Adam and Eve was in his mind.
[2:04:58] Abel was in his mind.
[2:05:01] The animal that God
[2:05:04] created was in his mind.
[2:05:08] The sacrifice on Abel's altar was in his
[2:05:10] mind.
[2:05:13] All the blood that was shed all down
[2:05:14] through the Old Testament. I don't
[2:05:16] understand it. I cannot understand that
[2:05:18] at all. There's places where it says
[2:05:20] that, you know, 30,000, the king gave
[2:05:23] 30,000 animals. That's incredible. In
[2:05:26] this Leodysian age, we, you know, a lot
[2:05:29] of people can't even kill a rabbit.
[2:05:32] Not that I want you to.
[2:05:34] When I saw eating my wife's flowers the
[2:05:36] other day, I almost wish to grab him by
[2:05:38] the neck, but I let him go.
[2:05:42] But, you know, we don't we don't have
[2:05:44] that in us. And so we read that, but
[2:05:46] that was in my God's mind. I just accept
[2:05:48] that. That was in God's mind.
[2:05:52] The burnt sacrifice that Noah offered
[2:05:54] was in God's mind. Jesus was in God's
[2:05:57] mind. The the whole
[2:06:02] uh the entire
[2:06:06] entire New Testament was in his God's
[2:06:10] mind. I'm just saying this and we come
[2:06:12] so quickly
[2:06:15] And I believe that this day
[2:06:18] was in God's mind. God who saw all these
[2:06:22] things. God who instigated all these
[2:06:24] things. I I'm coming to you.
[2:06:28] You're my friends
[2:06:30] who God has put us together with. I come
[2:06:32] as your brother.
[2:06:37] This this very moment was in God's mind.
[2:06:41] this very moment
[2:06:44] and what is it that he would want to
[2:06:45] look on and see? What is it that would
[2:06:48] be acceptable? Here we are and we've
[2:06:52] been all taken up, you know, with all
[2:06:54] kinds of things and that's fine. We we
[2:06:56] need to do things. We need to work. We
[2:06:58] need to pay our bills. We need to do all
[2:07:00] these things. We we enjoy certain
[2:07:02] things. We have certain pleasures and so
[2:07:03] on so forth. But I'm talking about now
[2:07:06] the heart is an altar.
[2:07:09] And it's it's the thing that's the
[2:07:10] deepest thing that lays on your heart.
[2:07:14] And if I asked you what was the deepest
[2:07:17] thing, the most the most significant
[2:07:21] thing that you could speak of, I
[2:07:23] guarantee you
[2:07:25] it would be something spiritual and it
[2:07:28] would have something to do with your
[2:07:30] relationship with God.
[2:07:33] It would have something to do with
[2:07:34] eternal life.
[2:07:36] Some of you might say, "It's the
[2:07:37] rapture. That's what consumes me. It's
[2:07:41] on my mind all the time." Someone else
[2:07:44] might say, "I'm I'm consumed with trying
[2:07:47] to please God. I want to please him so
[2:07:50] much. I'm I'm I am taken up. It looks
[2:07:53] like my time is consumed with my duties,
[2:07:56] my responsibilities, my work, my family,
[2:07:58] my children. And I just But deep down
[2:08:01] now, we're getting down to the altar.
[2:08:04] The inside of the inside. The thing
[2:08:06] that's on the altar is something that
[2:08:09] has to do with God and me and my
[2:08:12] relationship and my life with him and my
[2:08:15] walk with him. And my witness and what I
[2:08:18] want to do and what I want to be for
[2:08:19] him. That's what's really down there. I
[2:08:22] want to do something. I said this
[2:08:24] morning to God,
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; "What would you have me to do?
[2:08:29] Whatever it is, there's nothing that's
[2:08:32] too difficult. There's nothing that
[2:08:34] would be too humbling. There's nothing
[2:08:37] that would be too great if I could do
[2:08:40] it. If it be within my capacity, tell me
[2:08:42] what you'd want me to do.
[2:08:45] Because that's what's really on my
[2:08:47] altar.
[2:08:50] And now what God is looking for friends,
[2:08:53] what are you looking for? He wants to
[2:08:56] see besides your desire, what made that
[2:08:59] desire. And he looks beyond that desire
[2:09:02] and he sees there. Oh, I've sent my
[2:09:06] word.
[2:09:08] I sent I I sent my word and I I
[2:09:11] vindicated. I proved I proved it. I
[2:09:14] stood by the man. I stood by the
[2:09:16] messenger. I was the one that did the
[2:09:19] healing. I was the one who revealed the
[2:09:21] secrets of the heart. I was the one who
[2:09:23] opened the scripture. I was the one who
[2:09:26] showed how sin originated and where it
[2:09:28] goes. I was the one who explained and
[2:09:31] made clear that I'm not three persons,
[2:09:34] that I'm one. I'm God. I'm the one who
[2:09:36] did all of that. And I see there that
[2:09:38] that is what he's believing. He's
[2:09:40] believing the word that I've sent. And
[2:09:43] now part of that word is
[2:09:46] you shall not all sleep
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; and it's laying on my altar
[2:09:53] but we all shall be changed
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; and that word is already been sac that
[2:09:58] word is a bleeding word and he looks
[2:10:00] through and he sees that sacrifice. He
[2:10:02] sees that word already laying there and
[2:10:04] and and and here it's in your heart.
[2:10:06] It's in your well it's on my heart. It's
[2:10:08] more than that. It's on your altar. And
[2:10:12] God, today, don't forget this. The God
[2:10:15] that I serve, the God that has brought
[2:10:17] you into this way is looking upon your
[2:10:20] altar today, looking at that promise.
[2:10:23] You might think it's in vain. It's not
[2:10:25] in vain. He's looking on that promise.
[2:10:28] And there's a number of promises that
[2:10:30] I'm going to leave you with that that's
[2:10:33] what God is looking at right now. what's
[2:10:35] on your altar that is acceptable before
[2:10:38] God and we've given it to him and here's
[2:10:42] what lays upon our altar
[2:10:45] as I'm leaving you with this
[2:10:48] and don't take it as something you've
[2:10:51] heard memorized and we've quoted so many
[2:10:53] times because now I brought it all the
[2:10:56] way from eternity down into
[2:11:00] this day in the year 2007
[2:11:04] and group of people gathered. And what
[2:11:08] we have in common is one voice has
[2:11:10] gathered us. And that God who sent that
[2:11:14] voice has given certain words, certain
[2:11:16] promises. And now, behold, I show you.
[2:11:19] The first church age messenger said,
[2:11:21] "Behold, I show you a great mystery. I
[2:11:24] show you mystery. We shall not all
[2:11:28] sleep, but we shall all be changed. that
[2:11:35] lays that isn't something that's just in
[2:11:37] a book that was printed on a printing
[2:11:39] press. I receive that as having come
[2:11:42] from the almighty creator of heavens and
[2:11:44] earth and it lays on my altar very very
[2:11:48] solidly. It lays there this morning. We
[2:11:52] shall all be changed.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Does that lay on your altar?
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Could you declare that it's on your
[2:12:01] altar?
[2:12:03] Why doesn't his congregation say that in
[2:12:05] unison? We shall all be changed.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; We shall all be transformed.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; We shall all change in our in the figure
[2:12:22] of our being.
[2:12:24] We shall be transformed. We shall change
[2:12:27] our fashion.
[2:12:31] And that word is comprising everything
[2:12:34] in a person which strikes the senses.
[2:12:37] Everything that that person is,
[2:12:43] we shall all be changed.
[2:12:54] I wrote a number of scriptures down
[2:12:59] just to give you one more.
[2:13:02] Who shall change
[2:13:04] our vile body,
[2:13:07] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[2:13:09] glorious body, according to the working
[2:13:13] whereby he is able, even to subdue all
[2:13:16] things unto himself. Who shall? He
[2:13:20] shall. Who is he? He is the word that
[2:13:24] was made flesh that came to spirit.
[2:13:27] Friends, regardless of uh I hope you can
[2:13:30] follow the whole operation of God, how
[2:13:33] it came down and I brought it right down
[2:13:36] to your individual heart right today
[2:13:39] taken and proving in the last two or
[2:13:41] three services that your heart is a
[2:13:44] actual altar of God. It's not made for
[2:13:48] the shopping mall. It's not made to be
[2:13:50] consumed with your job or where you can
[2:13:53] get an achievements of life. It's not
[2:13:55] made for any of these other things. Of
[2:13:57] course, those other things have to be
[2:13:59] there. They're part of our life. They're
[2:14:00] part of our being, but they're not on
[2:14:02] the altar of our heart. Our deep desire,
[2:14:05] the word that's laying on our heart is
[2:14:07] the promise of God. Some of you are
[2:14:09] maybe holding a a promise for someone.
[2:14:12] Not only for something, might not even
[2:14:14] be for yourself. But whatever you're
[2:14:16] holding on your heart. I tell you what,
[2:14:18] if you believe it according to God's
[2:14:20] promise, it shall be. That word is
[2:14:23] bleeding there. There's blood upon the
[2:14:26] altar.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Not just physical blood being pumped in
[2:14:31] your heart. that physical being that
[2:14:36] muscle. I'm not speaking about that. You
[2:14:38] know that. But what's on your heart
[2:14:40] which is an altar of God that just just
[2:14:43] imagine if if you could imagine God for
[2:14:45] a moment looking there and seeing this
[2:14:48] will seeing this resolve and seeing this
[2:14:52] you know this uh the the the whole inner
[2:14:56] being of the individual and he looks
[2:14:58] upon that.
[2:15:00] But through all of the cares and all of
[2:15:02] the concerns of life, he actually looks
[2:15:05] to the altar. And on the altar is the
[2:15:08] promise.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; The promise
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; is bleeding.
[2:15:13] It's been blood from heaven to Eden to
[2:15:17] Abel to Noah to Moses to Jesus and on
[2:15:22] into the New Testament and on into the
[2:15:24] book of Revelation been blood. And now
[2:15:27] here at the end of the age
[2:15:32] comes a man
[2:15:36] and God sends him with special signs.
[2:15:40] Oh, I know we have the picture and they
[2:15:42] call it the halo and the cloud and so
[2:15:44] on. Here comes a man with special signs
[2:15:47] to confirm the individual. And then he
[2:15:51] begins to speak and out of his mouth
[2:15:55] comes a word.
[2:15:57] Out of his mouth comes a messages. And
[2:16:01] then you hear that voice say, "Thus
[2:16:05] saith the Lord."
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Congregation, hear me good. That word is
[2:16:14] bleeding.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; That word has blood.
[2:16:20] That word has blood. That word has
[2:16:23] sacrificial blood. That word believed
[2:16:27] will bring the supernatural into the
[2:16:30] individual. And that is why when that
[2:16:32] word was believed and there would be a
[2:16:35] person standing there with a growth with
[2:16:37] cancer. What is cancer? It is cells in
[2:16:40] the blood of the human individual. But
[2:16:44] when they believed that bleeding word,
[2:16:47] this blood disorder came into order and
[2:16:50] the cells, the wild cells were gone
[2:16:53] because that faith corrected what was in
[2:16:56] this body. Oh my. Can you see it? Can
[2:16:58] you see what I'm saying, friends? And in
[2:17:00] the next life, a man comes up and a and
[2:17:03] a prophet says, "The big thing with you,
[2:17:05] the thing that's on your heart is you
[2:17:07] are a you're a sinner."
[2:17:10] That wasn't only in the body. maybe
[2:17:13] gripped by habits of life, but down in
[2:17:16] his soul, he had been an unbeliever,
[2:17:18] maybe a a a sinner, an unbelieving man.
[2:17:23] He says, "If you believe, do you
[2:17:24] believe?" And that man would say, "Yes."
[2:17:28] And on the basis of that one word,
[2:17:32] sin, Satan lost his grip on an
[2:17:35] individual and he's pulled into the
[2:17:37] kingdom of God.
[2:17:40] If God would do that, if you believe the
[2:17:42] same word, you say, "I'm here this
[2:17:44] morning because I believe thus saith the
[2:17:46] Lord." That's why I'm here. I believe
[2:17:49] thus sayaith the Lord. That's a bleeding
[2:17:52] word.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; That's a sacrificial word. And that's
[2:17:55] the word.
[2:17:57] If you pass away, that's a word that'll
[2:18:00] bring you from the earth.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; That'll bring you from the grave. And if
[2:18:04] you're here and alive, we that are alive
[2:18:06] and remain. If you're here, if you're
[2:18:09] here, then that same word being held on
[2:18:12] the altar at that at that instant I said
[2:18:16] at the very beginning of the service
[2:18:20] when Joshua was getting ready to clo
[2:18:22] cross over
[2:18:24] and I feel we're kind of at that time
[2:18:29] and the Bible says it was at flood time
[2:18:33] when Jordan overflowed its banks.
[2:18:38] That's a service in itself.
[2:18:43] This generation,
[2:18:45] this day that you're living in, has
[2:18:48] overflowed its banks.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Sin has overflowed its banks.
[2:18:53] Violence has overflowed its banks.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Death and trouble has overflowed its
[2:19:00] banks. I would say that the that the
[2:19:03] nations of the world are essentially out
[2:19:06] of control. They don't have control.
[2:19:09] Leaders don't have control,
[2:19:12] but God has control.
[2:19:16] And the word that you believe is the
[2:19:18] bleeding word.
[2:19:21] God bless you. Let's bow our heads in
[2:19:24] prayer.
[2:19:28] Oh gracious God of grace,
[2:19:31] God of mercy,
[2:19:33] God of love.
[2:19:35] Thank you for
[2:19:37] your presence. Thank you for your
[2:19:40] people. They are so attentive. They give
[2:19:43] themselves so completely, so
[2:19:45] unreservedly,
[2:19:46] drinking in, oh God, hanging on to each
[2:19:49] word. I pray, Father, that if I would
[2:19:52] have said anything that is contrary to
[2:19:54] truth or contrary to what your Holy
[2:19:56] Spirit would have had said this morning,
[2:19:59] that you would remove it out from the
[2:20:00] minds of the people and erase it out of
[2:20:03] eternity's record. But oh God, if it be
[2:20:06] your word, if it be the impulse of the
[2:20:09] Holy Spirit, how you have moved upon my
[2:20:12] own heart, I pray it will reverberate
[2:20:15] down into the very soul of each person,
[2:20:18] oh God, and continue this mighty work
[2:20:21] that you have begun, oh God, in our
[2:20:23] congregation. Begin it, I pray, Father.
[2:20:26] I pray you'll condemn unbelief and cast
[2:20:29] it out far from us. and let the people
[2:20:31] be liberated, oh God, to believe the
[2:20:34] promise in a pure heart in the name of
[2:20:36] Jesus Christ. We'll give you all the
[2:20:39] praise and all the glory. We thank you.
[2:20:43] Now, I'll ask you to stand.
[2:20:46] Let's each one as you see fit just give
[2:20:50] him thanks in your heart. Thank him for
[2:20:52] calling you into this way. Thank him for
[2:20:54] his deliverance in your life. Thank him
[2:20:57] for the revelation. The same one that
[2:20:59] revealed to to Abel who it was and what
[2:21:02] it was. The same one who revealed it to
[2:21:05] him and revealed it to you. We thank you
[2:21:07] for this revelation. Oh God, we thank
[2:21:10] you for your mighty Holy Spirit. We
[2:21:12] thank you for the infilling, oh Lord. I
[2:21:15] pray that you'll take, oh God, each
[2:21:17] member of your
[2:21:19] precious body, oh God, and give them
[2:21:24] that give them that divine presence and
[2:21:27] touch and with you today, Lord, I pray
[2:21:30] you'll grant it. And Lord, whatever
[2:21:32] there may be that has been
[2:21:35] on the hearts of the individuals,
[2:21:38] I see them looking. I see them intently
[2:21:41] looking. I see them, oh father, looking
[2:21:43] to you now for your promise. Let the
[2:21:46] fire of God, let the Holy Spirit of God
[2:21:49] come and consume the sacrifice
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:00] Hallelujah.
[2:22:03] Hallelujah.
[2:22:10] Hallelujah.

[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:49] Brother Brandham said to one of his last
[2:22:51] gatherings of people, "If you feel that
[2:22:54] you're not just ready for the rapture,
[2:22:57] that if it would come tonight and you'd
[2:23:00] want to be remembered in prayer, He
[2:23:03] asked the people to take a make a
[2:23:06] identify themselves and raise their
[2:23:08] hand. Just raise your hand.
[2:23:10] And we have no place to make an altar
[2:23:12] call but your altars in your heart
[2:23:16] anyhow.
[2:23:19] If you feel that need
[2:23:22] said further the word has come to pass
[2:23:25] planted in your heart
[2:23:28] if you want to go in the rapture
[2:23:38] in times like these. Linda if you would
[2:23:41] please.
[2:23:46] In times like these
[2:23:49] [Music]
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; just prayerfully Now,
[2:24:04] [Music]
[2:24:10] be very
[2:24:12] [Music]
[2:24:17] [Music]
[2:24:22] anger.
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:27] and grips the solid
[2:24:32] rock.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; This rock is
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; and he's the word.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; This rock is Jesus.
[2:24:53] The only
[2:24:59] be
[2:25:01] sure
[2:25:04] be very
[2:25:06] sure
[2:25:10] your anor
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:16] and grips as solid.
[2:25:23] Before we go any further, I was looking
[2:25:26] for a couple of things I want to leave
[2:25:28] with you in the message, the lamb and
[2:25:30] the dove.
[2:25:33] Jesus said he was, brother Bren said
[2:25:35] Jesus was training some men that was
[2:25:38] going to take the gospel to all the
[2:25:40] world. 12 men. So he lived a sanctified
[2:25:44] life and forfeited every worldly
[2:25:47] pleasure for their sake. And we ought to
[2:25:50] forfeit our worldly dressing and our
[2:25:52] worldly pleasures and things like that
[2:25:54] for the sake of the people that we're
[2:25:57] trying to lead to God and outside the
[2:26:00] outside world. Let the dove come tonight
[2:26:04] and sanctify yourself that the dove of
[2:26:07] real faith will come in and take his
[2:26:10] abode.
[2:26:15] Then he asked this question. How many in
[2:26:18] here that knows that this great thing
[2:26:20] would happen
[2:26:22] and you'd go to bed tonight
[2:26:25] with your wife and in the morning she'll
[2:26:28] be gone.
[2:26:30] You father and mother may kiss your
[2:26:32] little ones to sleep tonight and
[2:26:35] tomorrow morning the little bed be empty
[2:26:38] and you'll turn run down the street to
[2:26:40] find out what happened to Mrs. Jones.
[2:26:44] She's gone too. The raptures at hand,
[2:26:48] the Bible has plainly given. And in the
[2:26:52] meeting, while you have the chance, just
[2:26:55] as men of intelligence and women of
[2:26:58] intelligence,
[2:26:59] why don't you heed to the call in your
[2:27:03] heart and say, "Lord God, fill me with
[2:27:09] that eternal life." I realize that I'm
[2:27:12] speaking to a congregation
[2:27:15] for the most part. You've given yourself
[2:27:17] your believers. I'm so thankful for this
[2:27:20] congregation, but I quite frankly I
[2:27:23] don't believe that these that these
[2:27:25] statements are ever I don't believe
[2:27:27] they're ever out of date. I believe it's
[2:27:30] good for us to take and ponder this
[2:27:32] right now.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; If if that was a reality back then, how
[2:27:37] much more real it is now. We're at a
[2:27:40] time of crossing over. A time I'll say
[2:27:43] to you, sanctify the altar. Let's not
[2:27:47] just carry on where we always have been,
[2:27:49] but we sanctify the altar. You'll never
[2:27:52] regret the service. You'll never regret
[2:27:56] making that resolve within your heart
[2:27:58] and soul. I my altar sanctified to you,
[2:28:02] Lord. I give it to you. Let me pray with
[2:28:05] you. If you'd like to raise your hand
[2:28:10] as a identifying that God
[2:28:14] is talking to you and calling for a
[2:28:17] deeper dedication,
[2:28:20] I raise mine with you and I'm looking to
[2:28:23] him day by day saying, "Lord, what would
[2:28:27] you have me to do?" Dear Lord Jesus, we
[2:28:31] are lifting up your name before these
[2:28:33] people. You're the one who has called us
[2:28:37] because of your voice. We have responded
[2:28:40] to it and we find ourselves
[2:28:44] here in the pathway that we're in today.
[2:28:46] We've taken another step. We've heard
[2:28:49] another word. We've heard some of the
[2:28:52] things that you have sent through your
[2:28:54] vindicated messenger. Lord, I pray the
[2:28:57] Holy Spirit now take the words that have
[2:28:59] been spoken in this service and anchor
[2:29:02] them, fasten them deep within the hearts
[2:29:06] of the people. Oh God, let these
[2:29:08] promises
[2:29:10] lay upon the altar, the bleeding
[2:29:12] sacrifice, and you will look upon it, oh
[2:29:15] God, and you will look upon it, and
[2:29:17] we'll have respect to it. And thus, let
[2:29:20] the people be the recipients. Let them
[2:29:23] receive. May they believe and may they
[2:29:26] receive. May they go out from this place
[2:29:28] today, oh God, being those that would
[2:29:31] inherit the inheritance of God through
[2:29:34] Jesus Christ.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Do this great thing I pray.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; I commit it to you now in Jesus Christ's
[2:29:41] name. Hallelujah.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; We give him glory.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:55] Jesus said, "I sanctify myself."
[2:29:58] May we wholly sanctify ourselves. We
[2:30:01] sing that chorus. Here is love.
[2:30:08] Love
[2:30:11] fast.
[2:30:14] [Music]
[2:30:22] as a
[2:30:27] when the free
[2:30:31] of life our ransom
[2:30:36] shed for us
[2:30:40] his preious
[2:30:43] blood
[2:30:46] through his Love
[2:30:50] will not remember.
[2:30:55] Who can sing
[2:30:59] to sing his praise?
[2:31:12] [Music]
[2:31:17] eternal days
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:23] on earth
[2:31:26] [Music]
[2:31:32] [Music]
[2:31:35] and deep and wide
[2:31:40] through the valley.
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:44] of God's mercy
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; flowing today
[2:31:53] and gracious high
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:32:01] will not remember.
[2:32:04] [Music]
[2:32:06] Who can see
[2:32:10] to sing his praise?
[2:32:15] He will never
[2:32:18] [Music]
[2:32:19] be forgotten
[2:32:22] [Music]
[2:32:24] throughout
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:28] eternal days.
[2:32:32] Grace and love
[2:32:35] [Music]
[2:32:36] like mighty rivers
[2:32:41] flowing
[2:32:45] sent from
[2:32:50] heaven's peace
[2:32:54] and perfect justice
[2:32:56] [Music]
[2:32:59] is the
[2:32:59] [Music]
[2:33:03] worthy
[2:33:06] [Music]
[2:33:11] will not remember.
[2:33:16] Who can see
[2:33:21] his praise?
[2:33:25] He will never
[2:33:29] [Music]
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; who is love once again who is love
[2:33:45] [Music]
[2:33:46] will not remember
[2:33:51] who can't
[2:33:55] to sing his praise.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; He will.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; He will never be forgotten
[2:34:07] [Music]
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; throughout
[2:34:12] eternal
[2:34:14] days.
[2:34:17] Now my brother and sister before you
[2:34:19] leave this place let this be firmly
[2:34:22] anchored in your heart that if you will
[2:34:26] do this
[2:34:28] hold that bleeding sacrifice
[2:34:32] not just a scripture you quote or a
[2:34:34] quote that you've remembered but take
[2:34:37] and realize I have a bleeding promise
[2:34:43] not just a promise a bleeding promise
[2:34:47] Greater than my fault,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; greater than my flaws, greater than
[2:34:53] every other desire that I could even
[2:34:55] think of. I have a bleeding sacrifice.
[2:35:00] And furthermore, God my father is
[2:35:02] looking on that because that is word
[2:35:05] that he has spoken. And because he has
[2:35:08] spoken it, I can expect something to
[2:35:11] happen. I can expect an answer.
[2:35:15] Do you believe it? How many believers do
[2:35:17] we have? You believe it with all your
[2:35:18] heart.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Gracious, gracious and loving father who
[2:35:24] we've been told by your messenger you
[2:35:27] loved fatherhood. And because you did,
[2:35:31] you had to become a father. Because you
[2:35:34] did, you had to have a son because you
[2:35:37] did. You loved a family that came
[2:35:40] through this son.
[2:35:43] Here we are, Lord.
[2:35:46] Here we are. We're your children. We're
[2:35:50] just your children. Sometimes we
[2:35:52] stumble. Sometimes we fall.
[2:35:56] Sometimes we're not what we want to be.
[2:35:59] But yet, we will say to your glory,
[2:36:02] we're not what we used to be.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; We're so changed. Our desires have
[2:36:08] changed. Our pathways have changed.
[2:36:11] And our future looks so bright and
[2:36:13] wonderful. Lord, we want to thank you,
[2:36:16] Father, because uh we are in full
[2:36:19] anticipation of a day of crossing the
[2:36:22] shore, reaching the shore, nearing the
[2:36:25] shore, and we're going to step over onto
[2:36:28] that glorious that glorious
[2:36:32] shore. Oh God, we're there. We're going
[2:36:34] to begin to meet, Lord, the redeemed of
[2:36:37] all the ages. Oh, my mind can hardly
[2:36:40] grasp it, but I do believe it. And
[2:36:42] there, Lord, we'll be united with you.
[2:36:44] That's what the blood was shed for, for
[2:36:47] a complete reconciliation.
[2:36:49] Now, I ask you'll take and let these
[2:36:52] things be treasures in the hearts of
[2:36:55] your people. Send us from this place
[2:36:58] with your grace,
[2:37:01] with the glory of your presence.
[2:37:04] And as we greet one another, I pray
[2:37:06] it'll be a precious moment. We take
[2:37:10] hands, shake hands, look into one
[2:37:14] another's face and smile and say, "God,
[2:37:19] bless you." I pray Lord that at that
[2:37:22] moment there be a special blessing come
[2:37:26] upon each member of the body of Christ
[2:37:30] as another one addresses them in such a
[2:37:32] way the way you've ordained it to be
[2:37:36] return us this evening Lord and anoint
[2:37:38] brother John Andy's mightily I pray oh
[2:37:41] God and let the word I pray father be
[2:37:46] anchored into these hearts in the name
[2:37:49] of Jesus us for his glory. I ask it.
[2:37:53] Amen.
[2:37:54] Amen.
[2:38:00] Ask you this afternoon just mind the
[2:38:02] Lord if you keep your thoughts on really
[2:38:05] what is on your heart. Let God look on
[2:38:09] that and expect
[2:38:12] expect things that you have asked for.
[2:38:16] expect them because God's a doing God.
[2:38:19] Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:38:23] God bless you.
