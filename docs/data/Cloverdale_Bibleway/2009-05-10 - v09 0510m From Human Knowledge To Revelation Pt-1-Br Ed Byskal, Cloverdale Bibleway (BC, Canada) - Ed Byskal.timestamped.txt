[0:10] There was something on the little
[0:11] child's heart and said, "I really want
[0:12] to do something for for God, something
[0:14] for Christ." And he emptied emptied his
[0:16] piggy bank, $60. Every year we think,
[0:18] well, what can we do? What can be a good
[0:19] missions project for our school? We will
[0:22] run, walk, rollerblade, scooter,
[0:25] whatever way we can get there. We're
[0:27] going to get to Monterey, Mexico. We ran
[0:29] over 4,600
[0:31] km. Through that, we were able to raise
[0:33] well over $700. I think our number right
[0:35] now is what? 800 and growing.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Greetings. I'm Brother Derek Paris of
[0:39] Bible Believers. And here with us today
[0:41] is Brother Randy Timberman's of Bible
[0:44] Waych Christian Academy. Brother Randy,
[0:46] nice to have you here with us.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, brother Derek.
[0:48] Appreciate
[0:48] &gt;&gt; you're the principal of the school,
[0:49] Bible Waych Christian Academy. That's
[0:51] correct. And uh in in what you're
[0:53] involved in with the school, being
[0:55] affiliated with the church, um missions
[0:59] comes up every once in a while. It's a
[1:01] discussion. It's something that the
[1:03] children are closely associated with the
[1:05] the church and wanting to get behind
[1:08] something in missions. So the Lord has
[1:10] laid certain things on your heart over
[1:12] the last couple of years and
[1:13] specifically this year. So, we'd like to
[1:15] hear a little bit about what you've
[1:18] experienced with um allowing the
[1:20] children to be able to participate in
[1:22] getting the message into the hands of
[1:24] the people around the world.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Well, uh at Bible Way
[1:27] Christian Academy, um we've been
[1:30] fortunate enough to have just some some
[1:31] wonderful people around us, uh wonderful
[1:33] teachers, and also because the school uh
[1:36] operates in in our church building, uh
[1:38] we're also surrounded by ministry and
[1:40] and fine brothers such as brother Derek
[1:42] uh in the missions department. um as a
[1:44] school uh an actual certified school in
[1:47] British Columbia, there are certain
[1:48] requirements that we have as far as
[1:50] education and curriculum, but um because
[1:54] of our unique position that we are a
[1:55] method school, we're able to uh
[1:58] integrate
[1:59] &gt;&gt; into our into our coursework uh you
[2:02] know, things of Christ and uh every year
[2:05] uh we try to do something very special
[2:07] um where the kids have an opportunity to
[2:09] give back to the Lord because the Lord's
[2:10] been so good to us in our school and uh
[2:13] through consultation with the with the
[2:14] missions department here at Cloverville,
[2:16] by the way. And um we've had the
[2:18] opportunity to do some really
[2:20] interesting and unique uh uh missions
[2:23] projects to uh to be a blessing. A lot
[2:25] of our children uh they want to do
[2:27] something for the Lord. They're young.
[2:28] They're they're five, six, seven and the
[2:31] in the early grades all the way up to to
[2:32] 15 years old, but each one wants to do
[2:34] their part for the Lord and they know
[2:36] that, you know, truly a blessing comes
[2:38] from giving. And so what we've done in
[2:40] the past is um every year we like to do
[2:42] at least one major missions project. And
[2:44] if I think back a few years ago, we uh
[2:46] we sent some care packages to to Russia
[2:48] and Ukraine for some orphan children
[2:50] there. And the children really enjoyed
[2:52] doing that. Just being able to select
[2:54] some things like toothpaste and and
[2:56] little games and and just things that we
[2:58] take for granted here in North America.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Certain little things that the
[3:02] orphan children in Ukraine wouldn't have
[3:04] and Russia wouldn't have. And we know
[3:06] those those things have really really
[3:07] blessed those children. Um I think it
[3:09] was last year um talking with brother
[3:12] Derek we we uh raised some money for
[3:14] Bibles for India.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; And I think it was about 500 500 Bibles
[3:18] we purchased.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Yes it was
[3:19] &gt;&gt; somewhere some somewhere in that
[3:20] vicinity. And uh the children felt so
[3:22] blessed that they had done something to
[3:24] further the spread of the gospel to
[3:26] further the spread of Christianity uh in
[3:28] a nation such as such as India. And I'm
[3:30] always amazed at how these children they
[3:32] are so incredibly generous. Uh a little
[3:35] story I have of a child in uh in grade
[3:37] three um had about $60 saved in his in
[3:40] his piggy bank and uh we always make
[3:42] sure that the children ask their parents
[3:44] first,
[3:45] &gt;&gt; right? Right. So he asks there was
[3:46] something on the little child's heart
[3:48] said I really want to do something for
[3:49] for God something for Christ and he
[3:51] emptied emptied his piggy bank $60 and
[3:54] gave it to the school to give to the
[3:56] missions proh project last year which
[3:58] was Bibles for India
[4:00] &gt;&gt; and um but this year uh should we go
[4:03] into that brother Derek talk about the
[4:04] the message hub?
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Well I think it would be great u there's
[4:07] a great testimony that comes out of
[4:08] that.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh this year um through through
[4:11] the the whole missions department here
[4:13] at at the church um we've been doing a
[4:15] they've been working on the whole
[4:16] message hub and so we every year we
[4:18] think well what can we do what can be a
[4:20] good missions project for our school and
[4:22] for our children something they'll
[4:23] really get behind so they can do their
[4:25] little part and I think it's important
[4:26] for the young students for young
[4:28] children to feel like they're doing
[4:29] something. Um, and I try to often tell
[4:32] them in devotions that, you know,
[4:33] whether your part's little, uh, you can
[4:35] give 25 cents, a dollar, uh, those
[4:39] monies can be so beneficial to the bride
[4:42] of Christ by purchasing things that will
[4:44] help, uh, ministry around the world, uh,
[4:47] and different and different different
[4:48] people. But this year um just by being
[4:52] in and about the church and seeing the
[4:53] work of the message hub and hearing
[4:55] reports from from different brothers
[4:56] about what a blessing these message hubs
[4:59] have been in different countries around
[5:00] the world and the teachers and myself
[5:02] and the students thought we do something
[5:05] with message hub and uh through
[5:07] consultation with yourself brother Derek
[5:08] we realized we need to raise around 700
[5:10] or so dollars right
[5:11] &gt;&gt; to purchase a message hub print station
[5:13] and we were excited about that we
[5:14] thought what a terrific idea so what
[5:17] we've done essentially is um we decided
[5:19] to actually run to Monterey, Mexico.
[5:22] Now, it's not really physically possible
[5:24] for us to do that, but a part of the
[5:26] British Columbia uh education curriculum
[5:29] is that each student in British Columbia
[5:31] is required to do 30 minutes of daily
[5:33] physical activity, supervised daily
[5:35] physical activity. So, we thought, how
[5:37] can we somehow incorporate and integrate
[5:40] our daily physical activity with doing
[5:42] something for for the Lord and for
[5:43] getting this this print station in
[5:45] Monterey, Mexico. So what we decided to
[5:46] do through the help of some teachers
[5:48] here at the school is we decided we will
[5:50] run, walk, rollerblade, scooter,
[5:53] whatever way we can get there, we're
[5:55] going to get to Monterey, Mexico. So we
[5:57] actually in effect through the last 4
[6:00] months we would chart every day how far
[6:03] we walked, ran, scootered, some of the
[6:06] children sprinted u and we ran over
[6:10] 4,600
[6:11] km which brought us to Monterey, Mexico
[6:14] &gt;&gt; in just several months. Yeah. So, we
[6:16] started around late September and right
[6:18] around Christmas time, uh, Decemberish,
[6:20] we arrived,
[6:21] &gt;&gt; so to speak, in Monterey, Mexico, and
[6:24] that was our goal to get there. Now,
[6:25] while we were running, we were, uh, we
[6:28] were holding little events at our
[6:29] school, uh, you know, special days, like
[6:32] a hat day or wear your jeans day, and
[6:34] then we just had basically days where
[6:36] they could just donate to the to the to
[6:37] the fund, the message hub fund. And, uh,
[6:40] through that, we were able to raise well
[6:42] over $700. I think our number right now
[6:44] is what 800 and growing. So, we're just
[6:46] going to keep it going and maybe we can
[6:48] even get two hubs. We'll see what the
[6:50] Lord has. The children have been so
[6:51] generous and it was it was kind of a
[6:54] really nice momentous event where we
[6:55] crossed that finish line and we realized
[6:58] that we had actually gone to Monterey,
[7:00] Mexico uh travel those 4,600 km and uh
[7:05] we're looking forward to presenting you,
[7:06] brother Derek, with with those monies so
[7:08] that we can uh officially pay for that
[7:10] message hub and see it blessing the the
[7:12] saints in Monterey.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Well, I know the saints in Monterey are
[7:14] very excited. Pastor Australia, we've
[7:16] received an email from him and they will
[7:19] be blessed by being able to print
[7:21] &gt;&gt; messages directly from the message hub
[7:23] in their own language. Well, we
[7:25] appreciate your time today. We
[7:26] appreciate all that Bible Christian
[7:28] Academy does to support the missions
[7:29] work around the world and we look
[7:31] forward to next year's project, brother.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We're excited about it and
[7:34] you know, like I said, it's such a
[7:35] blessing. It's a blessing to give.
[7:36] Absolutely. And the children, they get
[7:38] so much from it and it's a really good
[7:40] educational experience as well for them
[7:41] to see where the saints are around the
[7:43] world. Well, I don't want to put you on
[7:44] the spot, brother Randy, but uh next
[7:46] year's right around the corner. Can you
[7:48] tell us what uh what you might have
[7:49] coming for us next year?
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, we we have to keep that a secret, I
[7:52] think, for now because we're we're not
[7:53] 100% sure.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; But we just pray about it and we'll see
[7:56] if the Lord lays something on our heart
[7:58] and uh we're looking forward to though
[8:00] cuz we want to be a blessing to the
[8:01] bride of Christ.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Well, we appreciate it. Thanks.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We look forward till we
[8:05] see you next time.

[33:14] theophony
[33:17] told the bride whatever it takes don't
[33:21] misplay
[33:28] just think of us stepping on shore

[33:37] of touching the air
[33:41] and finding it.
[33:45] I'm breathing new air
[33:48] and finding it celestial.
[33:56] of waking up in glory
[34:04] and of finding it home.

[34:42] the risen saint.
[34:46] My faith tuned to the sound of my

[36:46] comes to speak to us. As brother Ed
[36:48] comes, let's sing together. We cry out.
[36:50] This song has just been can't get out of
[36:52] my mind and uh been playing it a lot at
[36:56] home.
[36:58] I remember
[37:01] an evening at camp and brother Ed stood
[37:04] up and said,
[37:06] "I give you your families. Stand up and
[37:08] claim it." I'm so thankful for that.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:15] And uh I can't understand some parents
[37:18] don't seem to care about their kids.
[37:20] It's just bizarre,
[37:22] you know, and they'll blacks slide and
[37:25] go into the world and not thinking
[37:26] they'll have any impact on their kids,
[37:28] right? Just totally destroys a family.
[37:32] I am so thankful.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; God's grace.

[37:43] and uh just worship God as brother Bisll

[41:59] [Music]
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Just thinking how good he is.
[42:04] Amen.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; We've prayed. God's heard us.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; God's answered our prayers so many
[42:12] times.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; We have evidence of it here today. Amen.
[42:17] So good to see our brother Ed Nikaroo.
[42:19] Hasn't been here for a few weeks.
[42:23] doctors
[42:25] &gt;&gt; and more doctors and specialists and
[42:28] more specialists and hospitals and
[42:31] another hospital and they can't find
[42:35] what the problem is. But we have a great
[42:38] physician
[42:39] and our our prophet has said that when
[42:43] man and all of his wisdom when he runs
[42:46] out that's just where God starts.
[42:50] Brother Ed, it's so wonderful to have
[42:52] you here today. There's a man that
[42:55] Hallelujah.
[43:00] There's a man that's been eaten up with
[43:02] fever for weeks and they could never
[43:05] find out why, how, what it was. Could
[43:08] never identify it. But God identified
[43:11] it. I think of so many times even the
[43:14] prophet would say to someone that's
[43:16] standing in front of him that the
[43:18] doctors couldn't find it
[43:21] &gt;&gt; but he announced you devil you can't
[43:23] hide
[43:25] &gt;&gt; from God
[43:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[43:28] &gt;&gt; he couldn't hide from God brother Ed and
[43:31] brought you out walking into the into
[43:34] the church and saw brother Jim Weber
[43:37] standing also uh I rejoice that God is
[43:41] able to uh prove that there's nothing he
[43:46] can use a doctor, but he's he's the only
[43:49] one that can heal the body. So, we're
[43:52] thankful for that healing so so much.
[43:55] And uh we had a a request from Sister
[43:58] Buffy Gonzalez for her grandfather's
[44:01] been given just a few weeks to live from
[44:04] cancer. I know nothing more about it,
[44:06] but his name is Art Godfeed. And if
[44:08] you'd like to all stand, we're going to
[44:11] just go to prayer.
[44:14] I'd like to just sing God is so good.
[44:17] God is so good. Just before we go to
[44:19] prayer, Brother Rod, please.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Let's just worship him now again.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; My God, God
[44:31] is so good.
[44:35] Oh, God
[44:38] is so good.
[44:42] He is so good
[44:45] to
[44:47] me.
[44:49] He saved my soul
[44:55] and he set my spirit free.
[45:01] [Music]
[45:03] my broken heart.
[45:07] He's so good to me.
[45:12] [Music]
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, receive our
[45:17] thanksgiving.
[45:19] I'm going on notice to thank you, oh
[45:22] God, for your grace, compassion, and
[45:25] mercy, for your healing power, your
[45:28] virtue that has come to the bodies of
[45:31] the needy ones. We see different ones
[45:34] that are standing in the congregation
[45:36] today, knowing that a short time ago,
[45:39] they were not well. They were even
[45:42] beyond the doctor's diagnosis, but not
[45:44] beyond yours. Thank you for your
[45:47] glorious power that has been manifested
[45:50] amongst us. We thank you for the
[45:53] strength and the courage, oh God, that
[45:55] you have given to your people. And we
[45:58] stand here, the bloodwashed by the blood
[46:01] of Jesus Christ. We can truly say with a
[46:05] songwriter, there's a fountain filled
[46:08] with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins.
[46:12] Sinners plunge beneath the flood and
[46:14] lose all their guilty stains. Glory,
[46:18] glory, hallelujah to the lamb of God.
[46:22] We're here to praise and worship you.
[46:24] Thank you, Father, for watching over us
[46:28] while we were away and bringing us home.
[46:30] Thank you for the prayers that have been
[46:32] prayed. And we pray, oh God, for Sister
[46:36] Buffy's grandfather. And I pray, oh God,
[46:39] that as you look upon her heart today,
[46:42] and those that are praying for this man,
[46:45] that you'll see the his soul, Lord, and
[46:48] see his body. And I pray that you will
[46:51] cause the cancer cells to leave him,
[46:54] Father. We ask that this will be done
[46:57] for your glory and your glory alone. And
[47:00] now, dear Lord, for your word as we are
[47:02] soon approaching it, I pray that you
[47:04] will anoint the word, the speaker and
[47:07] the hearers and all of those that are
[47:11] with us today, oh father, from uh
[47:14] different parts of the world where they
[47:16] may be listening. I pray that you'll see
[47:19] the desire that's on their heart. And I
[47:21] ask that you'll bring it about and bring
[47:24] answers, oh God, as faith reaches out to
[47:27] you now to lay hold of the promise in
[47:31] the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you.
[47:34] Amen. Amen. And the people said, "Amen."
[47:39] I'm going to allow you to have your
[47:40] seats for a few more moments before we
[47:43] read the word because uh we have a few
[47:48] slides. Also, we want to show you uh of
[47:53] the work in in Moscow, the progress of
[47:57] the church, which we just received some
[47:59] of these slides just a few days ago. But
[48:03] even before we show you the slides, I
[48:05] would like to honor our mothers.
[48:08] It's a mother's day, but the brother
[48:11] brother Brandham said we should honor
[48:13] them every day of the year, not just on
[48:16] Mother's Day. But I think if we're, you
[48:18] know, uh there's nothing wrong with
[48:21] having a a time when we give some
[48:24] special
[48:26] uh attention. We give some special
[48:29] notice and appreciation for our mothers.
[48:34] They're prophet said they're the
[48:36] backbone of the nation.
[48:39] They're the hub of the home.
[48:42] And I I
[48:45] would hesitate to think what some of our
[48:48] young people would be if we didn't have
[48:51] the kind of mothers that we have sitting
[48:54] in the congregation today. And so I say
[48:56] to all of you mothers, God bless you. Do
[49:01] not be discouraged.
[49:03] uh things don't always go just the way
[49:06] we plan it to go and life as uh the
[49:10] prophet's mother even said it's all just
[49:13] part of the wheel you know it's all just
[49:15] part of the part of life and uh brother
[49:19] Brandham was standing by our bedside and
[49:21] saying we've broken your heart many
[49:23] times and so on said that's just all
[49:25] part of it that's part of life but in
[49:28] spite of in spite of the reversals or
[49:32] disappoint appointments or whatever
[49:33] more. There's one thing that is certain
[49:35] uh that God has raised up the office of
[49:39] mothers and and I want mothers to know
[49:42] today
[49:44] of course of fathers as well but mothers
[49:47] especially I want you to know that there
[49:50] is a special strength there's a special
[49:54] uh characteristic that God has imparted
[49:57] to you and never never back down from
[50:01] that special place that God has given to
[50:04] you in the home, in the community, in
[50:06] this church. And I just want to say God
[50:09] bless you abundantly. Amen.
[50:21] All right. I'd like to just show you
[50:22] these uh
[50:25] slides. Now, we have we, as you know,
[50:27] we've been supporting this work very
[50:30] much.
[50:32] This This is the little building that
[50:34] they moved out of in Moscow and it got
[50:38] burned down.
[50:40] Uh,
[50:42] that's one shot. There's another shot of
[50:44] it. So, I'm glad that we're able to
[50:47] show you the next pictures because they
[50:50] wouldn't have had much.
[50:52] There's the building that is they
[50:55] decided to put the second when we we
[50:58] made uh mention here that if they could
[51:02] if they could get about six more
[51:04] truckloads of concrete blocks, they'd go
[51:07] up another story. And that's what
[51:09] they've done. Uh
[51:14] so that they'll have almost like double
[51:16] the space. And I think that was a very
[51:18] good move about $18,000.
[51:21] Put that second floor on.
[51:24] Uh the
[51:26] some of the brothers from Ria Latvia are
[51:30] going there I believe next week to put
[51:31] the roof on. So we're very very thankful
[51:35] for that. That's the inside. The uh
[51:40] lumber that you see down here in in the
[51:42] right hand corner is for the trusses. So
[51:46] they have the material for the trusses.
[51:48] That is it there. And uh this is the
[51:52] going to be the main entrance into the
[51:54] sanctuary.
[51:56] Another look at the inside. And that's
[51:59] that's it. But I thought we'd like to
[52:01] show you they they're doing almost all
[52:04] the work themselves. Uh they're paying
[52:07] for very very little of the work. And we
[52:09] have now, I believe, sent a little over
[52:12] $70,000.
[52:14] They put about 80,000 of their own money
[52:17] in. They bought the land and uh I expect
[52:21] the Lord willing before the snow flies
[52:24] this season, they'll be in there
[52:26] fellowshipping and worshiping. Amen. And
[52:29] uh we're in fact as we have some more
[52:31] funds that came in and we're going to be
[52:33] sending them on uh Lord willing on
[52:36] Tuesday this week. So we're very happy
[52:38] for that. Thank you for your prayers for
[52:42] the meetings in Switzerland and uh of
[52:45] course uh this evening service for them.
[52:48] So they those that stream they gather
[52:50] and I just want to greet them because uh
[52:54] we indeed had a wonderful time and I
[52:56] want to thank them for the uh for the
[52:59] invitation that they they gave. It was a
[53:02] bit of a surprise and and a sovereign
[53:06] move of God I believe. Uh in fact, as
[53:08] I'm absolutely convinced, it was a
[53:10] sovereign move of God. Uh the the two
[53:14] brothers, very very fine uh brothers
[53:18] that put it on took it on their hearts
[53:20] to arrange the meeting just so that
[53:23] believers that were scattered to
[53:25] different places could come. One was
[53:27] brother Daniel Culen Bruner and uh
[53:30] brother David Mayer. These brothers,
[53:33] they took it on themselves just to find
[53:35] a place, which they did. They located a
[53:37] place. They had had a similar meeting
[53:39] maybe a couple of years ago and invited
[53:43] a couple brothers, brother Gido from
[53:45] Belgium and brother uh Frank Kronite
[53:49] from which I believe are well known to
[53:52] the Dross family and he sends his
[53:54] greetings to you as well. and they had
[53:57] invited him so uh I think a year or two
[54:01] ago
[54:02] and I had never met brother Kankite just
[54:05] this time. Uh but they had about 60
[54:08] people that gathered from different
[54:11] places and uh so this time they had
[54:14] gotten a building and a kind of a
[54:16] convention center where the people could
[54:18] have rooms and have their meals and then
[54:21] have a a a meeting room at the same
[54:24] time. they have a lot of those places in
[54:26] Europe which we don't have so many of
[54:28] them here but uh they had about 60
[54:31] people out and so they thought they even
[54:34] told me if we had maybe 60 70 people uh
[54:37] they thought that might be fine then it
[54:39] grew to 100 and 120 and then 160 and 180
[54:44] and with the uh there was I think with
[54:47] the children there was around 200 or
[54:49] maybe 200 plus but it was uh different
[54:53] believers came from they came from
[54:56] France and Germany, Belgium and on the
[55:00] website they announced the meetings uh
[55:03] from our website and a a pastor, a
[55:06] Philippine pastor down in Milan,
[55:09] Italy saw the announcement and so he
[55:13] came up with eight or 10 of his people.
[55:16] There was a young man from Singapore who
[55:19] is studying and I think working in
[55:22] Germany and he saw the uh he saw the
[55:25] announcement and so he came and so
[55:28] people were gathering from different
[55:30] places but uh largely from the area in
[55:35] in Switzerland and there was a number of
[55:38] ministers besides uh brother Frank
[55:39] Kankite and brother Gido uh brother Jean
[55:42] Jacques uh you know we the church here
[55:46] along with saints from many different
[55:48] places. Prayed for our brother John
[55:51] Jacques. He was struck down about two
[55:53] weeks after we were there in October and
[55:57] uh with a a brain they didn't know
[56:00] whether it was a stroke or what it was
[56:02] but it turned out to be menitis in a
[56:06] fluid around his brain. There was a
[56:08] nurse in these meetings and there's
[56:10] medical people here but that registered
[56:13] nurse told us that with a menenitis in
[56:17] the fluid if there has a fluid around
[56:19] the brain said that first that is a
[56:23] certain death and secondly that fluid
[56:27] cannot dissipate in the body with the
[56:29] menitis that type of fluid and it did
[56:32] both. He lived and the and the flu is
[56:36] gone and he stands up and preaches
[56:38] today. So we're thankful to God for
[56:40] that. Amen.
[56:47] Brother France Leakard that's known to
[56:50] many of you here. He wants to send his
[56:53] greetings and be remembered to you. And
[56:55] he was in the meetings along with
[56:57] brother Coulen Bruner and uh from
[57:00] Germany and brother Albert. He brother
[57:03] Albert took the church of brother von
[57:05] Heath who is the grandfather of our our
[57:10] brother Nathaniel I IO and then his
[57:13] brother David who's been ordained to the
[57:15] ministry was also there and the pastor
[57:18] from Milan Italy and I don't have his
[57:21] name but we're we're just thankful for
[57:23] these brothers the I guess the
[57:25] outstanding thing I could probably just
[57:28] tell you I received this email just a
[57:30] few minutes before I left the home this
[57:33] morning
[57:35] and uh it was from brother Daniel Cen
[57:38] Bruner who was uh one of the brothers
[57:40] who was doing a lot of the uh took the
[57:42] responsibility of setting up and
[57:44] incidentally
[57:46] uh they they were they just cast all
[57:49] caution to the wind said whatever
[57:52] whatever it takes whatever it costs
[57:55] we're just going to see this gathering
[57:58] happening we believe that it is of the
[57:59] Lord and uh He said, "We would like to
[58:02] take this opportunity to thank you from
[58:04] the bottom of our hearts for the burden
[58:06] that you had to come to the meetings in
[58:08] Switzerland. We have no words to express
[58:11] our thankfulness to what the Lord has
[58:13] done to us. It looks like the bride is
[58:16] going back into steps singing onward
[58:19] Christian soldiers. Never have I been at
[58:22] a convention
[58:24] with people coming from so many
[58:26] different groups and at the same time
[58:29] there was just such a unity between the
[58:32] believers only the true word of God
[58:34] inspired by him is able to unite us.
[58:39] Amen. And so we're so thankful. He said,
[58:42] "Sometimes in life there are milestones
[58:44] where you really know that you have met
[58:46] God and he is in control of everything.
[58:51] We now move on with what we have
[58:54] received in our hearts believing that
[58:56] God will continue to reveal himself to
[58:58] us. Amen." And so you're a part of that
[59:02] if you prayed uh and uh ascending us.
[59:06] Brother Milco was there. We were so
[59:09] happy to have him and uh to mingle with
[59:13] the people. Our daughter Linda came with
[59:15] us partly to look after my wife, but
[59:18] more than that, there were so many young
[59:21] mothers that were there and she was able
[59:23] to be with them throughout the daytime
[59:26] because you weren't going anywhere.
[59:28] You're you were staying right there. And
[59:30] she thought it was just so wonderful cuz
[59:34] these mothers, they they had monitors,
[59:36] you know, so they could hear their their
[59:38] children and their babies. And they
[59:40] actually took their children and locked
[59:43] them in a room and and they were they'd
[59:46] be there just weeping and rejoicing.
[59:47] Then they'd grab a monitor and listen to
[59:49] see if everything was okay. But it
[59:52] seemed that God put a spirit of sleep on
[59:53] their kids. And uh and they were able
[59:56] they said, "We haven't been able to
[59:58] enjoy meetings like this." And this is
[1:00:00] just marvelous. And they all had their
[1:00:02] monitors laying in their laps and and
[1:00:04] had their children locked up in the
[1:00:06] rooms or in a room and uh enjoyed the
[1:00:09] services immensely. And just one after
[1:00:11] the other just came and said and there
[1:00:13] was one phrase, we are so happy.
[1:00:18] And it's wonderful when God's people get
[1:00:20] happy.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And I I trust that you're happy this
[1:00:23] morning. Thank you for your patience and
[1:00:27] this little time. If you'd stand with
[1:00:29] me, we're going to read some scripture
[1:00:31] in Matthew's Gospel, the 11th chapter, a
[1:00:36] short reading of just three verses.
[1:00:45] Matthew's Gospel, the 11th chapter,
[1:00:50] and starting with verse 25.
[1:00:57] Just one more time, we'll bow our heads.
[1:01:01] Dear Father God,
[1:01:04] your Holy Spirit is the author of this
[1:01:06] word
[1:01:08] and you have signed it and confirmed it.
[1:01:11] Now I pray that you will anoint us each
[1:01:13] one in the name of Jesus Christ. May the
[1:01:17] very thoughts of God sink down into the
[1:01:20] deep regions of our heart in Jesus name
[1:01:24] and for his glory. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:30] At that time Jesus answered and said, "I
[1:01:32] thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven
[1:01:35] and earth, because thou hast hid these
[1:01:38] things from the wise and prudent, and
[1:01:41] hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[1:01:44] Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[1:01:48] sight. All things are delivered unto me
[1:01:51] of my Father, and no man knoweth the
[1:01:54] Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any
[1:01:58] man the Father, save the Son, and he to
[1:02:02] whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And we pray that that's what will take
[1:02:08] place in our lives. God bless you. As
[1:02:10] you have your seats, you might want to
[1:02:12] just keep your Bibles open.
[1:02:15] I'm going to just refer to another
[1:02:18] scripture, one that is well known to
[1:02:21] each of you and you'll need to follow
[1:02:24] very very carefully and cautiously I may
[1:02:28] say don't try to read too much between
[1:02:31] the lines but sometimes
[1:02:34] uh there are things that you know a
[1:02:37] pastor would like to bring to the people
[1:02:39] that we cannot become just as specific
[1:02:44] or definitive as we would like to be,
[1:02:46] but yet you feel that you you you must
[1:02:50] approach it at least. And so that's the
[1:02:52] way I feel this morning. I just want to
[1:02:54] approach something uh in the message
[1:02:58] that uh is is evident throughout the
[1:03:01] scripture. And uh the the title of my uh
[1:03:05] service which I really really struggled
[1:03:07] over is uh is quite revealing in in in
[1:03:11] the subject matter. I want to speak on
[1:03:14] from human knowledge to revelation.
[1:03:18] And I would like you to envision in your
[1:03:21] mind that there is a chasm.
[1:03:24] There is a there is a chasm. There's a a
[1:03:27] deep valley between human knowledge. And
[1:03:32] I want to say chasm because uh there's
[1:03:35] no way just to you know work your own
[1:03:37] way from human knowledge into
[1:03:39] revelation. There's a place where your
[1:03:41] human knowledge just ends.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; You run out of mental space.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; You run out of imagination won't do it.
[1:03:49] Nothing will do it. You just completely
[1:03:52] run out. And you know that there's
[1:03:54] something more. And how are you going to
[1:03:56] get over there? Well, I will just
[1:03:59] summarize it by saying you'll have to
[1:04:01] see what God has said in his word about
[1:04:05] what's over there. Then you will have to
[1:04:08] cast yourself unreservedly and believe
[1:04:11] the promise of God and trust that the
[1:04:14] Holy Spirit then will take by your
[1:04:18] faith, honor your faith and deliver you
[1:04:21] to the other side. That's revelation.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And there's no other way that it can
[1:04:26] happen that I know of. And revelation is
[1:04:29] extremely important because we are a
[1:04:32] people that are in in anticipation of a
[1:04:34] rapture. And I can tell you, brother
[1:04:37] Brandham said himself that we scarcely
[1:04:40] have faith for healing. What about
[1:04:42] rapturing faith? And so I'm here today.
[1:04:46] I'm speaking on my own behalf. I want to
[1:04:49] live in in in such a fashion that I can
[1:04:54] be in not only in expectation of the
[1:04:57] rapture, but also uh hear the things
[1:05:01] that God sent through his messenger
[1:05:03] concerning the rapture. And I can tell
[1:05:06] you that for me some of the things are
[1:05:08] really quite mysterious. And so I want
[1:05:11] to uh just suggest that we uh approach
[1:05:15] it from that direction. Now Jesus, he
[1:05:19] asked uh Peter in uh in the 16th chapter
[1:05:24] of of Matthew and we know it so well.
[1:05:27] You won't have to read it because I'm
[1:05:29] just going to summarize it. But he asked
[1:05:32] uh the disciples, who do men say that I
[1:05:35] am? And some of them said that you're
[1:05:39] John the Baptist,
[1:05:41] uh Elias or Jeremiah or one of the other
[1:05:44] prophets. And then he asked the
[1:05:46] question, but who do you say that I am?
[1:05:49] Brother Brandham was also speaking this
[1:05:52] in 1964, which is a long ways, many
[1:05:55] years from the time Jesus said it. He
[1:05:57] said, "It's not enough." He said it it
[1:06:00] that wasn't the question uh who do who
[1:06:03] do others say that I am but he asked the
[1:06:05] second question then who do you say that
[1:06:07] I am? He said now it's not enough that
[1:06:10] he asked them back then. We can't just
[1:06:12] read it as an account of what what he
[1:06:16] asked them but he said now in 1964 it's
[1:06:21] today 1964 and I want to say it's in
[1:06:24] 2009
[1:06:26] we need to also be approached by the
[1:06:29] same question. Who do you say that this
[1:06:31] is?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] So the greatest of all revelations
[1:06:42] because Peter finally said,
[1:06:45] "Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:06:49] living God."
[1:06:51] Now I I want to just have you bear in
[1:06:54] mind that Jesus had been with the
[1:06:58] disciples now maybe some between two and
[1:07:01] three years. So they knew him as a man.
[1:07:06] They ate together,
[1:07:08] perhaps slept in the same rooms or
[1:07:11] buildings or wherever. Uh participated
[1:07:14] in the miracles, uh delivered the food
[1:07:18] and the supernatural
[1:07:21] uh increase of the loaves and the fishes
[1:07:24] to the people, gathered up the remnants
[1:07:27] or the leftovers. Uh so they were a part
[1:07:30] of all of this and yet there was a
[1:07:33] mysterious part that they couldn't fully
[1:07:36] grasp. They couldn't fully It was that
[1:07:39] supernatural aspect of him. There was a
[1:07:42] uh something strange about him. He would
[1:07:45] say things and they couldn't quite grasp
[1:07:48] it and especially towards the end when
[1:07:51] he began to say that the son of man will
[1:07:53] be uh killed and and after 3 days he'll
[1:07:57] be raised again they couldn't grasp they
[1:07:59] couldn't understand that that's why they
[1:08:01] were still bewildered after the
[1:08:03] resurrection and I'll be coming to that
[1:08:07] also so the greatest of all the greatest
[1:08:10] of all revelations
[1:08:13] is is this that God reveals himself as
[1:08:19] he unveils himself because what what it
[1:08:22] was 100 years ago or 200 years ago or 50
[1:08:25] years ago or even a month ago,
[1:08:29] revelation is a moving it's a moving
[1:08:32] target.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Revelation is a moving thing because
[1:08:35] it's a living thing.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so it's not just what he
[1:08:40] revealed or what we saw, you know, a
[1:08:43] year ago or a few months ago.
[1:08:46] We can see physical manifestations.
[1:08:49] People do see physical manifestations.
[1:08:53] We can actually hear the word of God,
[1:08:57] study the word of God, and get all the
[1:08:59] mechanics as it were in place. We can
[1:09:02] study times and we can study all of
[1:09:05] these things and we can even do the
[1:09:08] requirements
[1:09:11] of the word.
[1:09:13] Sisters can say, well, I'm going to be
[1:09:16] uh, you know, I'm going to be in
[1:09:18] moderation. I'm going to grow my hair
[1:09:20] and do it because it says so in the
[1:09:23] word. And we can mechanically do these
[1:09:25] things and and men can, you know,
[1:09:28] straighten their lives up and so on and
[1:09:30] so forth. And a lot of people do it
[1:09:31] outside of the message and a lot of
[1:09:33] people do it within the message. But
[1:09:35] then we have to say, you know, what is
[1:09:38] it and why are we actually doing that?
[1:09:40] Is it something that we learned or we
[1:09:43] grew up with all of you young people?
[1:09:45] You said, well, this is what my parents
[1:09:47] imposed on me. This is what was
[1:09:48] required. This is the way we live
[1:09:50] because we're believers. But it may not
[1:09:53] become a revelation to you yet.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; It may not be a reality to you. But once
[1:09:59] it's a reality to you, the struggle's
[1:10:01] all over
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; because it has become a part of your
[1:10:05] life. It's a part of your fiber. It's a
[1:10:08] part of everything. It's like trying to
[1:10:10] argue uh you know that uh I I get I I I
[1:10:14] go off the road and get stuck in the
[1:10:16] ditch and finally get out and somebody
[1:10:18] said, "Nah, you weren't stuck in the
[1:10:19] ditch." Hey, don't don't don't don't
[1:10:22] give me any problem. I'm the one that
[1:10:24] experienced it. I was stuck.
[1:10:27] I couldn't get out by myself and someone
[1:10:30] helped me out.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; You understand? So you have an
[1:10:34] experience. Nobody a person's argument
[1:10:37] is no competition
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; for another person's experience.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; And once you have the experience
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; and revelation is an experience that
[1:10:47] goes beyond works,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; goes beyond knowledge, goes beyond all
[1:10:52] the learning,
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; it it goes far beyond that. So Jesus
[1:10:57] called his disciples. He called them his
[1:10:59] own. He called them his elected. He
[1:11:03] called them those that the father had
[1:11:05] given him. And yet yet even after two
[1:11:10] three years and he knew that they were
[1:11:12] elected. He knew that they were given.
[1:11:13] He knew that the father had given them.
[1:11:15] Yet he needed to pose this question. Who
[1:11:18] who do you say I am?
[1:11:21] Who who is this? even after he'd called
[1:11:24] them come follow me I'll make you
[1:11:26] fishers of men now those people could
[1:11:29] have said you called us I didn't call
[1:11:32] you to follow you that's what I'm doing
[1:11:34] but he wants to know who do you say who
[1:11:38] do you say this is I'm just posing that
[1:11:41] question
[1:11:43] in uh like now here here we come to kind
[1:11:46] of a a mysterious part
[1:11:48] in the unveiling of God
[1:11:51] brother says now my subject this
[1:11:53] morning. I trust that God will reveal
[1:11:55] this and each time if you who take the
[1:11:59] tapes listen and I hope and trust that
[1:12:02] you have a spiritual understanding of
[1:12:05] what uh that God has been trying to get
[1:12:09] out to the church without saying it uh
[1:12:14] without without saying it right out. In
[1:12:18] other words, without just making a
[1:12:19] straight flat statement, it it it
[1:12:22] remains a wee bit veiled. And this is in
[1:12:25] the message, the unveiling of God. So
[1:12:28] even in the unveiling of God, there can
[1:12:31] be that part. He said, I trust that
[1:12:33] you'll have spiritual understanding. I'm
[1:12:36] praying that I'm praying for myself.
[1:12:38] I've been much in prayer. God, I want to
[1:12:41] have a spiritual understanding, a
[1:12:44] spiritual grasp, not enough just to read
[1:12:47] a message. Not enough just to hear a
[1:12:48] message. Not enough to just come to
[1:12:50] church here. Not enough to sing the
[1:12:52] songs and worship. That's not enough.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; We need the spirit of God
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; on an individual basis
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; to reveal to us what it is we're
[1:13:02] actually participating in.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; This is not because it's my friends or
[1:13:06] my family or my parents or or or even
[1:13:09] because I have an office in the church
[1:13:11] or even because I'm I'm the pastor of
[1:13:13] the church. That's not sufficient. I
[1:13:15] say, "Well, I'm the pastor." They could
[1:13:17] have said, "Well, we're disciples. We're
[1:13:18] mighty apostles. We've been called by
[1:13:20] the master himself." It wasn't enough.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Who do you say that I am? Have you
[1:13:26] actually been able to identify and
[1:13:29] recognize who this is
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; and where we're at at this at this
[1:13:34] particular time? And he said, he went on
[1:13:38] to say,
[1:13:39] "It's a thing sometimes we have to say
[1:13:42] things in such a way that it might thin
[1:13:45] down." Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out, some to
[1:13:50] leave, some to ponder over. Look, when
[1:13:54] uh the L the angel of God came to Mary
[1:13:59] and began to tell her what part she
[1:14:03] would play
[1:14:05] in the in the birth of Jesus Christ, how
[1:14:09] can these things be, seeing, I've not
[1:14:11] known a man? And he said, 'The spirit of
[1:14:14] the Almighty will be overshadow thee and
[1:14:17] and you shall conceive a son and and and
[1:14:20] begin to describe some of the event. And
[1:14:23] the Bible says that she held those
[1:14:26] things and pondered them.
[1:14:30] Why did she ponder them? Because she
[1:14:31] didn't fully understand it.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; But she believed
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; and said, "Let it be according to your
[1:14:38] word."
[1:14:39] And that kind of faith took her across
[1:14:42] the chasm from where her understanding
[1:14:45] ended
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; and faith took her across
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; and span that place
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; of that mysterious part that mysterious
[1:14:53] aspect.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; He says then it might be that some would
[1:14:58] say you mean that God would purposfully
[1:15:02] do a thing like that. Listen now. He
[1:15:05] said he certainly did
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; and he does yet.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I say we're here anticipating a
[1:15:13] resurrection.
[1:15:14] We're here anticipating a rapture. We're
[1:15:16] here anticipating a change of our body.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; We are a people who have received
[1:15:24] number one the sign of the Messiah.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Number two, we have received
[1:15:32] the sign of the resurrection.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Number three, he has said we have
[1:15:38] received the last great sign.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; And we know that we have received a
[1:15:45] vindicated forerunner who has both come
[1:15:48] and gone.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; And could you tell me how is it going to
[1:15:57] happen? How was it actually going to
[1:15:59] take place? Can you define for me how
[1:16:02] that resurrection, how are we going to
[1:16:05] recognize it and identify it when we
[1:16:08] have a record here in the scripture that
[1:16:10] even after he was resurrected and seen
[1:16:12] of many many uh bodies of many were seen
[1:16:15] in the streets of Jerusalem. There's no
[1:16:17] record in history that the outside of
[1:16:20] the scripture that the people history
[1:16:22] never recognized it. Caiaphas never saw
[1:16:25] it. Herod never saw it. The Roman Empire
[1:16:28] never saw it. It was to some believers,
[1:16:31] but it did happen. Can you Can you
[1:16:33] understand? A prophet of God said that
[1:16:36] that God in that resurrection emptied
[1:16:39] out emptied out paradise.
[1:16:45] You know, all the prophets,
[1:16:48] all of those, the patriarchs, all of
[1:16:50] those that had believed, he emptied out
[1:16:54] paradise, and many bodies of the saints
[1:16:57] were seen in the streets of Jerusalem,
[1:17:00] and no one outside of the believers knew
[1:17:03] anything about it. How is this
[1:17:05] resurrection going to be taking place?
[1:17:07] We can we can, you know, speak about it.
[1:17:11] I hope not too glibly or glibly at all
[1:17:14] and not too lightly at all. But there's
[1:17:17] going to be those and and the only
[1:17:19] record we have is when Jesus was
[1:17:21] resurrected himself, Mary couldn't
[1:17:24] recognize him. The two on the way to
[1:17:27] Emmas couldn't recognize him. So, we
[1:17:30] have a fundamental truth in the
[1:17:32] scripture that it's going to take a
[1:17:35] divine revelation from God and God is
[1:17:39] going to have to stay with you and walk
[1:17:41] with you until you identify and know
[1:17:44] what is actually happening.
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; That's the mysterious part of it
[1:17:52] and how we're going to be changed.
[1:17:56] So, this is kind of where I'm going.
[1:17:59] And the greater than Solomon is here. He
[1:18:01] said, now I have a lot of quotes, but
[1:18:05] they are in I have labored over this
[1:18:07] because I'm trying to identify uh some
[1:18:12] big questions in my own heart. So I'm
[1:18:15] not just giving you a bunch of answers
[1:18:16] today. I'm actually just giving you some
[1:18:19] quotes that I am pondering. So I share
[1:18:22] my my pondering thoughts with you.
[1:18:27] But in sincerity he said men do receive
[1:18:31] God
[1:18:32] number one
[1:18:34] and believe him number two
[1:18:38] and then they pull themselves off.
[1:18:43] They believe God. They receive him and
[1:18:47] they pull themselves off. And he says we
[1:18:49] got this that there that that's all
[1:18:52] there is to it. Some say well well
[1:18:54] that's all there is to it. And then they
[1:18:57] separate themselves. We've seen it even
[1:19:00] within the message. And then they won't
[1:19:02] take no new revelation. They organize
[1:19:05] it. This is it. This is our doctrine.
[1:19:09] This is the end. And they said they end
[1:19:11] with a period. He says if you if you'd
[1:19:15] have a denomination and you would end
[1:19:17] your denomination or end your doctrine
[1:19:20] with a comma.
[1:19:22] He said we believe this plus as much as
[1:19:26] God will show us then that's all right.
[1:19:29] So I want to say today that uh you know
[1:19:33] say if say well I'm a message believer
[1:19:35] Malachi 4 praise God Luke 17:30 and the
[1:19:38] messenger to you better put a comma at
[1:19:41] the end of it
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; because the revelation is a moving
[1:19:46] living thing
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; and it's not for us to imagine what it
[1:19:51] is. God's going to make it very very
[1:19:54] clear.
[1:19:56] We don't have to go on and presume or go
[1:19:58] on presumption.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; We don't have to assume anything. God's
[1:20:03] going to make it very very clear. But we
[1:20:05] want to be So you might ask, and I have
[1:20:08] this for later on in the service, well,
[1:20:10] what should be my posture?
[1:20:13] How should I conduct myself? I would say
[1:20:16] this. You cannot absorb yourself too
[1:20:19] much with what God has given us in the
[1:20:23] message.
[1:20:25] I don't believe that you can OD
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; on the word of God.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I believe you need to absorb it, hold
[1:20:34] it, ponder it, even say, "I don't
[1:20:37] understand it." Stay with it, ponder it,
[1:20:40] read it again, pray about it, be
[1:20:43] sincere.
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that is essential for this
[1:20:48] rapture. Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Don't put a period,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; put a comma. It's a continuous unveiling
[1:20:58] of God
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; in the message. Notice the message now.
[1:21:01] Who do you say this is?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Time hasn't changed. People
[1:21:07] are designed the same as they were
[1:21:10] then." He's the same yesterday, today,
[1:21:13] and forever. He said the question isn't
[1:21:15] to them anymore. The question is not to
[1:21:18] them back there anymore. They asked they
[1:21:22] asked who it is. But in 1964, and I put
[1:21:25] in 209, the question is, who do you say
[1:21:30] it is? What's this all about? Have you
[1:21:35] stopped to search the scriptures? And
[1:21:37] who do you think this is? The and today
[1:21:41] the scripture promised for this hour
[1:21:43] friends is fulfilled right in our midst
[1:21:47] hour after hour. And who do you think it
[1:21:50] is? Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was posing this and
[1:21:55] friends
[1:21:57] after
[1:21:59] showing and demonstrating God in front
[1:22:02] of the people and now we have such a uh
[1:22:07] complete and comprehensive
[1:22:11] uh message.
[1:22:13] You have hundreds and hundreds of times
[1:22:16] when the secret of people's hearts was
[1:22:18] revealed. And he went back to that and
[1:22:22] that's what he was saying to them. Who
[1:22:23] do you think this is? Who's doing that?
[1:22:26] They had it well as it's a gift. It's a
[1:22:29] gift of knowledge or it's a gift of one
[1:22:31] of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:22:33] that caused them to bypass it. And then
[1:22:37] there were others that said, "Well, you
[1:22:38] know, we go down to the restaurant, we
[1:22:40] eat with him, and so on and so forth."
[1:22:42] And he became too common, and that
[1:22:45] caused him to bypass it. Yeah.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And so we come here and we say, "Well,
[1:22:49] this is what we believe and this is who
[1:22:51] we fellowship with. These are the songs
[1:22:53] we sing and these are the, you know,
[1:22:54] these are the officers of the church and
[1:22:56] here's and these are the ministers and
[1:22:58] these are our ministers." It can just
[1:23:00] get just too common and cause a person
[1:23:04] to really miss the very essence. And you
[1:23:08] and you might say, "Well, you know,
[1:23:09] maybe that's not so serious." It's real
[1:23:11] serious when the resurrection rapture
[1:23:13] taking place. Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be in that state when
[1:23:16] that's happening. And furthermore, let
[1:23:18] me shock you. It may be happening in a
[1:23:21] different fashion than you expected it
[1:23:24] to happen. And things could be happening
[1:23:26] around us because I'm also going to take
[1:23:28] you to one of the profound truths that's
[1:23:30] in the message and all through the word
[1:23:32] of God that the thing that was foretold
[1:23:36] was so clearly stated and it should have
[1:23:39] it should have registered and did
[1:23:41] register in the human mind. But the
[1:23:44] people were uh trusting that they
[1:23:46] understood it and that and and and the
[1:23:49] chasm between understanding it and
[1:23:53] having the mechanics of it and the
[1:23:55] dynamics or the revelation of it. That
[1:23:57] chasm they they were because what they
[1:24:00] they didn't they didn't understand what
[1:24:03] they what the actual meaning of it was.
[1:24:07] And so they kind of put that out and you
[1:24:10] know put a period behind I guess what
[1:24:12] they believed and uh uh never came to
[1:24:15] the full understanding the full
[1:24:17] revelation didn't participate in it.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And and and brother Brandham says it
[1:24:26] passed by.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; He says another place it passed right
[1:24:29] through them. And one was John the
[1:24:31] Baptist who prophesied. Couldn't have
[1:24:33] been any clearer. prophesied his father
[1:24:36] was a priest and and he prophesied even
[1:24:39] his father turned dumb and couldn't
[1:24:40] speak
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; as a result of not believing the
[1:24:43] message. So the people who came to the
[1:24:45] synagogue or wherever he he ministered
[1:24:48] before the Lord, they they knew John's
[1:24:51] father Zachcharias. They they knew him.
[1:24:54] He spoke fluently. Suddenly he can't
[1:24:56] speak. An angel came told me I'm my my
[1:24:59] my wife aged wife Elizabeth's going to
[1:25:03] have a son and she gets pregnant and has
[1:25:05] a son. All of this is taking place and
[1:25:08] the son lives and grows up. In the
[1:25:10] meantime, the Messiah comes and he's
[1:25:12] there for 30 years.
[1:25:15] Who knows about it? That's the
[1:25:17] mysterious part.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied by Isaiah,
[1:25:21] prophesied by prophesied by uh the
[1:25:24] Psalms, prophesied by Moses, prophesied
[1:25:28] all through the And here he is the
[1:25:29] fulfillment of it all. And it's passing
[1:25:31] right by them. It's
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; passing right through them. And they're
[1:25:35] not catching it.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Not it, not a day, not just something
[1:25:38] that just happened overnight. this
[1:25:39] passed by, you know, one month and the
[1:25:41] next month and six months and a year and
[1:25:44] it was all passing by. The fulfillment,
[1:25:47] the revelation, the fulfillment was
[1:25:49] going by, but and they had a knowledge.
[1:25:51] Oh, we know him. His mother, his his
[1:25:54] brethren are here and his, you know, we
[1:25:56] we know him. We know where he we know
[1:25:58] where he was born. We know where he
[1:26:00] slept. So, why is why is brother
[1:26:02] Brandham saying that? because he's
[1:26:04] talking to a group of people that I that
[1:26:07] identify that much about him, but he's
[1:26:09] telling them you're missing it.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And I don't want us to just become,
[1:26:15] you know, uh
[1:26:18] claiming to be believers
[1:26:21] and uh and the dangerous part is we put
[1:26:23] a period behind that when we ought to be
[1:26:26] having a comma behind it. And and and
[1:26:29] what what what are you saying, brother
[1:26:31] Ed, by saying we ought to have a calm?
[1:26:33] I'm saying you should be moving on.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; In the revelation of the word,
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; you should be progressing in your
[1:26:41] spiritual walk with God. You should see
[1:26:44] that. And if you don't see that, then
[1:26:46] you got to you got to get down, get real
[1:26:47] serious with God.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] So only the revelation
[1:26:57] of Matthew 16 can span the chasm from
[1:27:01] human knowledge to the revelation. Now
[1:27:04] brother Bram says about faith. Faith is
[1:27:07] the only direct
[1:27:09] and positive sense and it's the sixth
[1:27:12] sense. Faith is more than sight.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Faith is more than feeling.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; You do not feel faith. You don't taste
[1:27:21] faith. You don't smell faith. You don't
[1:27:25] see faith. Faith is the substance of
[1:27:28] things
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; hoped for
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and the evidence of things not seen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; So the everpresent God. Now I touched on
[1:27:39] this while I was away and it really
[1:27:41] quickened some of the things I want to
[1:27:44] bring to you this morning and that is
[1:27:46] that you know we we are uh in our human
[1:27:53] uh
[1:27:54] our human understanding. We I know that
[1:27:58] we think of God as being you know in the
[1:28:00] heavens our father which art in heaven
[1:28:03] and uh but really where is he and then a
[1:28:08] prophet comes and says that God is
[1:28:10] everywhere he we we say he's omnipresent
[1:28:14] he's omnisient he's everywhere so God is
[1:28:18] right beside me uh the the the very
[1:28:21] attributes the influence the angels of
[1:28:24] God are present Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And uh and and I'm going to come to that
[1:28:29] because there are things while God
[1:28:31] changes.
[1:28:33] You pray for yourself and pray for me.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; While God changes and the reason he
[1:28:39] changes and in the message the unveiling
[1:28:41] of God, brother Brandham uses a whole
[1:28:44] series of statements, phrases.
[1:28:48] He will use changing his form,
[1:28:52] changing his mask.
[1:28:54] He will use right in connection with
[1:28:56] that coming down. What's he doing? He's
[1:28:59] coming down where hopefully
[1:29:03] you can reach through by faith and find
[1:29:07] out and discover he's not somewhere
[1:29:10] distant place but he happens to be right
[1:29:12] here.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; And when you finally come to that uh not
[1:29:16] just understanding revelation of it,
[1:29:19] he's right present. Then you begin to
[1:29:22] find out that his attributes are also
[1:29:26] present.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Healing is not something you have to
[1:29:29] pull down. It's right present.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; His mercy is right present.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; All of his attributes are right present.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And when you have a group of people that
[1:29:42] begin to understand and believe that and
[1:29:45] enter into the revelation of the present
[1:29:48] God, how do I know he's present? He's
[1:29:50] revealed himself to me.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I see him beyond the senses of the body.
[1:29:58] I've entered into the sixth sense
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; and my faith has touched him.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; My faith has laid hold of him
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; and it has his his his word has become
[1:30:10] substance to me. You can never take it
[1:30:13] away.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And that is called his descending. So
[1:30:19] faith is is uh brings the God into the
[1:30:23] present.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Now on the day of Pentecost, now Peter
[1:30:28] after he said, "Thou art the Christ, the
[1:30:31] son of the living God." Then Jesus
[1:30:33] responded to him and said, "Blessed art
[1:30:36] thou Peter, flesh and blood has not
[1:30:37] revealed this to you, but my father
[1:30:39] which is in heaven. And I say unto thee,
[1:30:41] thou art uh thou art Peter, and I will
[1:30:44] uh uh upon this church, upon this
[1:30:47] revelation, uh I will build my church.
[1:30:50] Flesh and blood has not revealed it to
[1:30:52] you. And then Peter when he was done, he
[1:30:56] stood up on the day of Pentecost and he
[1:30:58] reaches into the Old Testament to the
[1:31:00] book of Joel. And this is what's
[1:31:02] important. Now, just follow these
[1:31:04] principles. And he brings the book of
[1:31:06] Joel second chapter right forward to the
[1:31:09] present moment. And when he's done he
[1:31:12] tells them this Jesus
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; this Jesus not way back there but Joel's
[1:31:17] prophecy now this happened and he told
[1:31:20] them this Jesus whom you knew this Jesus
[1:31:23] who you crucified he has resurrected and
[1:31:27] we're witnesses of the resurrection. And
[1:31:29] he said and this Jesus hath God raised
[1:31:32] up whereof we are all witnesses. And
[1:31:34] they were pricricked in their hearts
[1:31:36] said, "Men and brethren, what must we
[1:31:37] do?" Because bringing the historical
[1:31:40] Christ and bringing him alive in front
[1:31:42] of the people in a current event that
[1:31:46] had just taken place, bringing it
[1:31:48] forward and and and because it became
[1:31:52] absolutely they became confronted with
[1:31:55] an event. They knew about the event.
[1:31:57] They knew that Jesus had been crucified.
[1:31:59] They knew all of that, but they didn't
[1:32:01] realize it tied to the scripture. And
[1:32:04] when they found that the scripture had
[1:32:05] been fulfilled and it was actually on
[1:32:08] the verge of passing through them
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; leaving them in the in the past leaving
[1:32:16] it as a fulfilled thing then they became
[1:32:19] pricricked in their heart what must we
[1:32:21] do and he said to believe and be
[1:32:23] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:25] Christ. So I want to conclude this part
[1:32:29] by saying that God worked through Peter
[1:32:32] to uncover or reveal Jesus of Nazareth
[1:32:37] whom they knew. That was their
[1:32:39] understanding. But he had to bridge that
[1:32:42] chasm and bring them to a revelation and
[1:32:45] let them know this Jesus whom you knew.
[1:32:48] This Jesus of Nazareth who you knew
[1:32:51] dwelt in Nazareth and walked the shores
[1:32:53] of Galilee and did all these various
[1:32:55] things. He is both and by the scripture
[1:32:58] he is both the Lord and Christ.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Here it is right now at this moment.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that. Just hold that
[1:33:06] as I'm I'm going to take some time with
[1:33:09] it.
[1:33:11] You know, we
[1:33:14] we see and hear of things and probably
[1:33:17] read in newspaper
[1:33:19] and hear it on the news or whatever
[1:33:21] more.
[1:33:23] I just wondered if it might mean
[1:33:26] something
[1:33:28] uh here the last few days
[1:33:32] uh Pope Pope Benedict
[1:33:36] uh he's he's in a Muslim nation
[1:33:41] and he's telling them that I have such
[1:33:44] deep respect for the Muslims
[1:33:48] and uh he's called he called on for
[1:33:50] reconciliation between Christians and
[1:33:53] Jews. A day after stressing, this is the
[1:33:56] day after stressing his deep respect for
[1:33:59] Islam.
[1:34:01] On his first trip to the Holy Land as
[1:34:04] pontiff
[1:34:06] and on the second day of his visit in to
[1:34:09] the Middle East, Pope Benedict stressed
[1:34:12] the need for harmony and unity between
[1:34:17] Christians and Muslims.
[1:34:21] The prophet of God has said that that
[1:34:23] system is a beast system.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; And he said that America is found in the
[1:34:30] 13th chapter, Revelation
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; and our new president of America.
[1:34:38] And the the scripture says that there
[1:34:41] was a another beast that raised up out
[1:34:44] of the land and it was like a lamb
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; but it spake
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; as the dragon.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And now we have the beast system. I'll
[1:34:57] say system. I don't identify the man but
[1:34:59] I'll say it is a beast system.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Cruel,
[1:35:04] rich,
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; pompous.
[1:35:08] an incredible system.
[1:35:11] And here we have it. The head of it is
[1:35:15] in a Muslim nation reconciling with the
[1:35:20] Muslim people.
[1:35:22] And the most powerful and richest nation
[1:35:25] on earth, their leader is going to make
[1:35:30] a major speech, his first major speech
[1:35:35] outside of America. and he chooses Egypt
[1:35:39] because he wants to appeal to the Muslim
[1:35:42] people. And it is said of President
[1:35:45] Obama will travel to Egypt next month.
[1:35:48] This is scarcely 30 days apart to
[1:35:52] deliver his promised address to the
[1:35:54] Muslim world
[1:35:56] culminating at a long and politically
[1:36:00] sensitive selection process by choosing
[1:36:04] as his venue an Arab nation. Hey, I have
[1:36:09] nothing against the Arab people at all.
[1:36:12] I'm just saying this is seems to me to
[1:36:14] be more than a coincidence
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; that the scripture says that the lamb
[1:36:20] beast will say the same thing that the
[1:36:23] dragon will say.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And here we are scarcely 30 days apart.
[1:36:29] And you have the beast system of
[1:36:32] revelation making overtures and making
[1:36:36] statements about the Muslim world. And
[1:36:41] friends, their God is not the God of the
[1:36:44] Bible.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; So is perhaps I'm not saying it is, but
[1:36:55] perhaps it is something say, "Well, I
[1:36:58] didn't even know that." Well, that's
[1:37:00] just what like a whole lot of other
[1:37:02] things going to happen
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; and it'll slip and pass right by. and
[1:37:07] you say, "Oh, well, I thought
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I thought Elijah was supposed to come."
[1:37:14] Do you know? I want you to try to
[1:37:17] appreciate where you're sitting today.
[1:37:20] Do you know that there are churches
[1:37:22] filled with thousands and tens of
[1:37:25] thousands of people are waiting for
[1:37:27] Malachi 4? Yes, sir.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; And Malachi 4 has passed by
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; in 30 years of ministry, and a handful
[1:37:35] of people know about it.
[1:37:37] you know about it.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; It's already happened.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And so on one side of the street, they
[1:37:43] are waiting and looking for this
[1:37:45] forerunner and he's supposed to come to
[1:37:48] forrun the Messiah. And here's another
[1:37:50] group of people maybe just across the
[1:37:53] street and saying, "Thank God,
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; he's already come. Thank God we've
[1:37:59] already heard it. Thank God we've
[1:38:01] received the voice, vindicated voice.
[1:38:05] Thank God. What a change it's made.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a change it's made.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Has it not?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Did he do it?
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Not our goodness that brought it on.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Nothing that we did.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Even nothing that you did that God
[1:38:23] selected and said, "I'll show it to
[1:38:25] you."
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And your mind was boggled. Said that,
[1:38:29] "Can that be?" And he stayed with you.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; And he stayed with you.
[1:38:35] and your maybe your friends and your
[1:38:38] parents said you've gone off the deep
[1:38:40] end.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; That isn't what it means. Look at what
[1:38:43] this theologian said. Look at what this
[1:38:45] doctor said. Look what this uh these
[1:38:47] high educated people. Look what they
[1:38:50] said. Said, "But my heart is saying that
[1:38:54] I've what I've heard is the truth." Who
[1:38:57] did that? Not you. You didn't learn it.
[1:39:00] Didn't happen Sunday school. Didn't
[1:39:02] happen. Didn't even come over this
[1:39:03] pullpit. But something by the sovereign
[1:39:07] act of God
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; caused you to believe it
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; even when your own mind was saying
[1:39:16] there's something a miss here I it
[1:39:18] doesn't reconcile. Uh there's things
[1:39:20] that I can't reconcile in the message
[1:39:22] but your heart kept saying it's the
[1:39:25] truth. It's the truth. It's the truth.
[1:39:27] and you hung on to that and then on down
[1:39:29] the road, woo, there it is.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And you look back
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; and you see things that have happened
[1:39:40] that you know only God can do.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; He said, uh,
[1:39:53] I'm just
[1:39:55] putting this in
[1:39:59] in the Philadelphiaian church age. He
[1:40:02] said, "Furthermore, the elect will not
[1:40:04] only be kept,
[1:40:06] but as this move becomes the image
[1:40:09] erected to the beast,
[1:40:12] the saints will be gone in the rapture."
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; There's going to be events happening
[1:40:17] just like are happening right now.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And the saints are going to be gone in a
[1:40:22] rapture.
[1:40:24] And this little delightful winsome
[1:40:26] movement that started out in fellowship
[1:40:29] at Ephesus in the first church age will
[1:40:32] become the monster of Satan that defiles
[1:40:36] and deceives the whole world. That's
[1:40:37] what the scripture says. for the church
[1:40:40] system of the Roman Catholic and the
[1:40:42] Protestant in coming together for this
[1:40:45] great ecumenical movement will control
[1:40:48] the whole wealth of the world system and
[1:40:51] force the whole earth into its religious
[1:40:54] trap or will kill them by refusing them
[1:40:57] the privilege of buying and selling
[1:41:00] whereby they would make a living. This
[1:41:03] will be accomplished simply for the
[1:41:06] harlot's daughters
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; are all but gone back to her
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; already
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; all but gone back to her. In the
[1:41:17] meantime, Rome has acquired nearly all.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I'm being very specific now. Rome has
[1:41:24] acquired nearly all the supplies of
[1:41:27] gold. The Jews have the bonds and all
[1:41:31] the paper.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; At the right time, the harlot will
[1:41:36] destroy the present day money system.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; By calling in all the paper and
[1:41:47] demanding gold. With no gold, the system
[1:41:51] falls.
[1:41:52] I listened to a professor
[1:41:55] who was speaking on behalf of the nation
[1:41:57] of Sweden
[1:42:00] and the investigative reporter was
[1:42:04] asking because they're all consumed with
[1:42:07] and even to this day very much consumed
[1:42:10] with the economic system and you hear it
[1:42:13] all over the place. The old system will
[1:42:16] not function anymore. They must have a
[1:42:19] new economic system. And it will be a
[1:42:23] one one world monetary system. It
[1:42:27] doesn't mean that your money will be the
[1:42:28] same as everyone else's money but or
[1:42:31] that everyone will have euros as many of
[1:42:33] the nations just uh uh use euros today
[1:42:36] and they gave up their local currency
[1:42:40] and others are more resistant to it. The
[1:42:43] British want their pound and and the and
[1:42:46] the Norwegians want their croner and and
[1:42:48] the same thing with the Swedish people.
[1:42:50] But this man was speaking on behalf of
[1:42:53] the government and the reporter said
[1:42:57] just in lay in layman's terms tell me
[1:43:01] what the economy is. What is the
[1:43:03] economy?
[1:43:06] He said that's very difficult
[1:43:08] to answer that but he said it is not a
[1:43:13] it's not an economy of currency.
[1:43:16] It's not a economy of money. It's not
[1:43:20] that. He said it's an economy of of of
[1:43:25] confidence.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how many billions of
[1:43:30] dollars in paper you have or whatever
[1:43:32] more. If the people lose their
[1:43:35] confidence, they aren't investing and
[1:43:38] they aren't spending. They aren't it
[1:43:40] isn't moving. The whole economy grinds
[1:43:42] to a halt.
[1:43:44] people who you work for, they say,
[1:43:47] "Well, we're not going to be doing that
[1:43:49] just now or we're cutting back." And
[1:43:52] people lose their jobs and everybody and
[1:43:54] they say, "Well, then I'm not going to
[1:43:56] buy a home. I'm not going to buy a car.
[1:43:57] I'm not going to invest." And the whole
[1:43:59] economy starts to crumble because the
[1:44:02] confidence is gone. And he was saying
[1:44:04] it's it's an economy of confidence, not
[1:44:06] an economy.
[1:44:08] Now, I want to say this to you. This can
[1:44:10] pass by.
[1:44:12] Rome can have all the gold or have
[1:44:14] control of it. Not that they got it all
[1:44:17] stored in tons and tons in the Vatican.
[1:44:20] They control it.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; And the Jews have the paper. What's the
[1:44:27] paper worth? Nothing.
[1:44:33] It's an economy of confidence. And then
[1:44:37] Israel begins to find out that they're
[1:44:39] being squeezed out of their favored
[1:44:43] position
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; with America.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; And it's already well into the wind that
[1:44:50] America is not going to provide them
[1:44:51] with the arms, the greatest friend that
[1:44:54] America has in that country of all
[1:44:56] dictators.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; But they're going to woo.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what the scriptures
[1:45:03] say. And I want to say this
[1:45:05] congregation, how do you know that some
[1:45:08] of this isn't already passing right
[1:45:10] through us at this moment while we're
[1:45:12] sitting here?
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And the people, hey, the Jews, the Jews,
[1:45:17] don't forget the Jews in Israel. Israel
[1:45:19] is full of millions of people and
[1:45:22] they're still looking for they're still
[1:45:23] looking for Jesus Christ who hasn't
[1:45:26] who's come and gone 2,000 years ago.
[1:45:28] Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is how it passes by. The
[1:45:36] Bible says, and I've looked up this, I
[1:45:38] haven't got time, but the Bible says God
[1:45:40] will say, "I will send a famine."
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Other place, I will scatter
[1:45:47] you
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; to all the nations." That's right.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; He says another place uh I'll
[1:45:54] raise up this Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon
[1:45:57] and you will go into bondage.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; And I Jeremiah got up and prophesied
[1:46:02] you'll be there for 70 years.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And there were others that raised up and
[1:46:06] says we'll only be there for two. And so
[1:46:08] they had uh dispute about that. But God
[1:46:12] said you'll be there and you'll be under
[1:46:14] bondage for 70 years. Do you know what
[1:46:16] they did? It passed right by. They went
[1:46:18] into bondage and a lot of the Jews
[1:46:20] prospered.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; They went into famine. They said, "Well,
[1:46:27] do you know what?
[1:46:29] We're in tough economic times."
[1:46:32] They never got any revelation from it.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; They were right in the midst of God's
[1:46:36] judgment,
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; but never got any revelation. It didn't
[1:46:41] turn the people to God. It didn't say,
[1:46:42] "Oh, God sent this. We want to return to
[1:46:45] God." No. What I'm saying to you is that
[1:46:47] judgment can pass by and people aren't
[1:46:49] awakened by it.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; God's forerunner of Christ not only can
[1:46:57] pass by, but does pass by.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah passed by in John
[1:47:03] the Baptist didn't waken them up.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; They were attracted to it. Came by the
[1:47:09] thousands, filled up the wilderness, but
[1:47:12] passed by. And the fulfillment of the
[1:47:14] scripture passed by.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; The resurrection passed by.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; The ascension of Jesus passed by.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And it says, why gay up into heaven?
[1:47:28] This same Jesus who came shall come back
[1:47:31] in like manner.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; So it says, well, we're looking for the
[1:47:35] clouds and we're looking for this. Hey,
[1:47:37] he he ascended and the whole thing
[1:47:40] passed by. The ascension passed by
[1:47:42] without them even knowing
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; what's wrong with the descension.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Passing by.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; And quite frankly, I believe he has
[1:47:57] descended.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I cannot I cannot
[1:48:04] take this entire ministry
[1:48:07] 33 years of ministry unlike anything
[1:48:11] since Adam.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching at you. I'm making a
[1:48:16] statement. You can read whatever book
[1:48:18] you want to read. I'd be happy for any
[1:48:20] person here or on the internet to bring
[1:48:22] me any book where there's any record of
[1:48:24] any ministry that even remotely
[1:48:27] resembles
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; what God sent at this time. where do you
[1:48:31] have a man standing? And people lined up
[1:48:34] and even turns from them, starts
[1:48:35] pointing down into the audience. Friends
[1:48:37] of mine from Alaska who adopted uh an
[1:48:42] Eskimo boy and now they were down in New
[1:48:44] Mexico. And the little boy began to run
[1:48:48] at his nose and his sinuses ran till he
[1:48:51] had this just massive cold sores all
[1:48:54] over his lips and they couldn't figure
[1:48:56] out what to do with him. who wasn't able
[1:48:59] to get any medical treatment for him.
[1:49:02] And that prophet of God stands right
[1:49:04] there. Those people lived in my town. My
[1:49:07] wife and I know them well. We know the
[1:49:10] little boy and they moved down to New
[1:49:12] Mexico and went over to a meeting of
[1:49:14] brother Brandon. They're sitting in the
[1:49:16] audience. They don't know him at all.
[1:49:18] And he points down says to this couple,
[1:49:22] "You have a a son, a little boy." And he
[1:49:27] he described the trouble and the sores
[1:49:30] that he has. And he says, "Uh,
[1:49:34] I see mountains
[1:49:36] and I see tall trees."
[1:49:40] He said, "It's Alaska.
[1:49:43] The little boy's from Alaska."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; And he's not accustomed to this heat
[1:49:50] that's down here.
[1:49:52] And that set up an allergy in him. He's
[1:49:55] allergic to it. and has caused them to
[1:49:57] be this way. That's thus sayeth the
[1:50:00] Lord.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Where did you have that?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm confronting the congregation
[1:50:05] today. Where did we have that? That and
[1:50:08] he even said clearly. I have many quotes
[1:50:11] and I think that you know it. He said
[1:50:13] that's not a man, that's Christ.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; It's not a man, that's Christ saying
[1:50:18] that. And here's where you have to get
[1:50:20] the line of demarcation.
[1:50:23] when a when a prophet of God was saying
[1:50:25] thus sayith the Lord
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; even brother Brandham says that was God
[1:50:29] to the people
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; because without that the people didn't
[1:50:34] have any concept of God raised up the
[1:50:36] man and spoke the word of God to the
[1:50:39] people so they could recognize God is
[1:50:42] amongst us
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; God is in Israel
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; God is in his tabernacle how could they
[1:50:49] say that was because God was speaking
[1:50:52] through the man.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; And then as soon he said, as soon as
[1:50:55] that was over, it was just Moses again.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; And as the prophet would stand, he says,
[1:51:01] "I'm helpless. I'm your brother.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just your brother.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Unless he comes, I'm helpless. Can't do
[1:51:08] anything. But I want you to identify. I
[1:51:11] want you to ponder this." When that
[1:51:14] voice came, when that thus sayeth the
[1:51:18] Lord, and you don't have to decipher
[1:51:19] where it is and where it isn't in the
[1:51:21] message. I tell you, take every word
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; that God sent
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; and it'll make you feel sometimes as I
[1:51:29] have been feeling quite mysterious
[1:51:33] because it you just can't reach out and
[1:51:35] take a hold of God or the revelation of
[1:51:38] God like I can reach brother Ernie's
[1:51:40] hand and shake it. It doesn't happen
[1:51:42] that way
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; because it can pass right by
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; and we don't even know. We say, "Oh,
[1:51:47] economic system. How do we know it isn't
[1:51:50] this right here?"
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, are you saying it is?"
[1:51:53] No, I'm not saying it is. How do you
[1:51:55] know that it's not? Amen.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; How do you know that the two leaders are
[1:52:02] going the greatest of of all religious
[1:52:05] order and the greatest of all the
[1:52:08] nations, the super the single superpower
[1:52:10] of the earth, both going within 30 days
[1:52:13] of each other.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; As far as I'm concerned, this lamb beast
[1:52:18] that is raised up with two horns,
[1:52:20] political and ecclesiastical,
[1:52:23] that that beast is saying the same
[1:52:24] thing. And he says, "And when he spake,
[1:52:26] he spake as the dragon
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; and the dragon speaks first
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and then the lamb speaks again."
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And they say the same thing. We must
[1:52:36] make peace with these people.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; And my message to you is,
[1:52:47] are you really ready for the rapture?
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Is it possible that it could? And
[1:52:54] brother Brandham says he's he's talking
[1:52:56] to he's talking to believers. He says,
[1:52:58] "And some will say,
[1:53:00] "Wasn't there to be a rapture?"
[1:53:04] And he says clearly, "It will have
[1:53:06] already
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; gone by."
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; You may be saying, "Oh, Brother Ed, are
[1:53:12] you ever bringing this down home? Is
[1:53:14] this ever serious?" That's exactly what
[1:53:16] I intend to do.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; I think it's I think it's very serious
[1:53:22] business.
[1:53:25] Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; And the Queen of Sheba, he said, "The
[1:53:35] thing that we're seeing now,
[1:53:37] as I want to back this up, I'm taking
[1:53:39] time on this. I'm not preaching just a
[1:53:41] normal service." Said, "The thing, what
[1:53:45] was told you was the truth."
[1:53:49] He said, "Is that right, sir?" Then he
[1:53:52] said, "Who did that?"
[1:53:55] The Messiah,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; He was only using
[1:54:02] a
[1:54:04] son of man
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; to reveal the son of man.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; And the son of man was Messiah.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; How many of those people How many of
[1:54:16] those people do you think actually
[1:54:19] caught the revelation? No. They had the
[1:54:21] physical man except we hear his words.
[1:54:23] He doesn't speak very good English.
[1:54:29] How many of those people do you think
[1:54:30] and maybe those thousands of people over
[1:54:32] there actually said that's the Messiah.
[1:54:37] Why do I say that? Because that's the
[1:54:39] only one who did it in in John's gospel.
[1:54:43] He revealed the secret of the heart of
[1:54:44] the woman at the well.
[1:54:47] He's the one who told Nathaniel before
[1:54:49] that Philip called you, I saw you under
[1:54:52] the tree, said thou art the Christ.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; How many those people catch that?
[1:55:01] I decided that I would just unload it
[1:55:03] today.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Put yourself back in that meeting.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; And what would you have identified?
[1:55:14] You'd probably been like the rest of the
[1:55:15] people. I would have too. I'd just been
[1:55:17] so taken up. Oh, isn't it wonderful?
[1:55:21] Praise God. I'm so excited. Do it again.
[1:55:25] Do it again. Oh, I wish I was up there.
[1:55:28] I wish they'd call my card. I wish he'd
[1:55:31] call me. I have all kinds of questions.
[1:55:33] I've got a Oh, I've got deep troubling
[1:55:35] things. I wish he would. I wish he'd
[1:55:37] call me.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; No. How many might have said that's the
[1:55:42] Messiah,
[1:55:44] not the man.
[1:55:46] Only the Messiah can say that
[1:55:48] something's happening here. Something is
[1:55:51] passing through this building.
[1:55:54] Something's passing through this
[1:55:56] audience of people that they're not
[1:55:58] catching.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I know of one case,
[1:56:05] Sister V. Coral, your uncle,
[1:56:08] brother Baker,
[1:56:11] I believe in about 1947,
[1:56:14] very early. He's sitting amongst
[1:56:17] hundreds of people in Edmonton, Alberta,
[1:56:21] and he saw the manifestation of God
[1:56:25] through the prophet Messenger,
[1:56:27] and he just said,
[1:56:30] "That is God's prophet."
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he separated himself from
[1:56:34] everything else and lived the rest of
[1:56:36] his days as a believer.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; It's the only one I know.
[1:56:44] I'm moved
[1:56:48] because there'll only be few.
[1:56:51] There will only be few.
[1:56:54] There won't be many. Brother Bram says
[1:56:56] 500 people can disappear off the earth
[1:56:58] today. just here. We've got several
[1:57:00] policemen here in the building right
[1:57:02] this minute
[1:57:04] and I can tell you that they've got
[1:57:06] files of of missing pe persons and they
[1:57:09] haven't even got time to go and search
[1:57:11] for them.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Young people are missing, fathers are
[1:57:15] missing, mothers are missing. All kinds
[1:57:17] of people are missing.
[1:57:21] And the prophet of God likens that and
[1:57:23] says they'll just be gone. You say,
[1:57:26] "Well,
[1:57:27] I would know if somebody's gone." Yeah.
[1:57:30] You get on the phone. Who do you want to
[1:57:32] call? Oh, somebody's gone. Your wife's
[1:57:35] gone. Your husband's gone. A believer
[1:57:37] that you know is gone. So, you get on
[1:57:39] the phone. I'll call 911. Say, "I've got
[1:57:44] a missing. I want to report a missing
[1:57:46] person."
[1:57:48] They said, "Well, just a moment. Just a
[1:57:49] moment. You know when were they missing?
[1:57:52] What is your name? What is your address?
[1:57:56] What is your phone? Have you ever done
[1:57:57] it? I've called 911.
[1:58:00] Try to call the police. God bless our
[1:58:03] police. Try to call them.
[1:58:07] Is this an emergency? If it's emergency,
[1:58:09] please call this number. If it's not
[1:58:12] emergency, just hold the line.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; And they come on. Say, I want to report
[1:58:19] someone's missing. My wife's missing. My
[1:58:21] husband's missing.
[1:58:23] say just be calm.
[1:58:26] Take your address and everything. Take
[1:58:27] your name. That's exactly what would
[1:58:29] happen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And you think, so you think the whole
[1:58:33] world's going to respond. No. No.
[1:58:35] They'll say, "Well, we'll we'll call you
[1:58:37] back or we'll try and get in touch with
[1:58:39] you. We'll Hey, it happens all the time.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not going to be just like we
[1:58:49] thought. Just
[1:58:52] whole church empty of people.
[1:59:04] says, "The angel came down and said, as
[1:59:07] John was sent to wind up the Old
[1:59:09] Testament and bring forth the
[1:59:10] introduction of Christ, your message
[1:59:13] will wind up the loose ends and will
[1:59:16] introduce the Messiah just before his
[1:59:18] coming."
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; That has happened. Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; The Messiah has been introduced.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; That has already happened.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Just before the coming. That's what the
[1:59:30] angel of God said. And look away to
[1:59:33] Jesus. He said, "I may not do it, but
[1:59:36] this message will introduce Jesus Christ
[1:59:39] to the world."
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; You may wonder why we go and why we send
[1:59:43] people, why we are desirous. We don't
[1:59:46] have a kingdom. We don't have a
[1:59:48] denomination to build. We have one thing
[1:59:51] to make this Christ who is the word the
[1:59:54] fulfilled word in this season to make
[1:59:57] that known to the people.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Don't be an expectation to this to
[2:00:02] happen. It has happened.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; This message will introduce Christ to
[2:00:14] the world. For as John the Baptist was
[2:00:16] sent to forerrun the first coming, so is
[2:00:19] this message to forrun the second
[2:00:21] coming.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; And John said, "Behold the lamb of God
[2:00:25] that takes away the sin of the world."
[2:00:27] So it paralleled it in every way and I
[2:00:30] know it will be and the message will go
[2:00:32] on.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know how
[2:00:37] fervently
[2:00:39] they've tried to stamp this message out?
[2:00:41] Do you know how they have spoken every
[2:00:43] kind of people I have people that
[2:00:46] contact me uh not infrequently contact
[2:00:50] me and said I was searching on the
[2:00:52] website I was searching the Google I was
[2:00:56] searching for prophets I was searching
[2:00:58] for angels or whatever more and then I
[2:01:00] came upon uh William Brandham's name and
[2:01:03] I began to search he says there's a lot
[2:01:05] of nasty things that said I tell you
[2:01:08] what any book that you want to find
[2:01:10] they'll call Call it a cult,
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; call it whatever.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And they cannot lay their finger on one
[2:01:18] single negative thing of his lifeactly,
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; of his actions or of his ministry.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; They say that it's not according to the
[2:01:28] word of God. But when you take the word
[2:01:30] and speak to them as I have and say and
[2:01:33] I have I've sat with even leaders of it,
[2:01:35] I have said now the absolute will be
[2:01:38] exactly what this word says. Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; And if you if you come to a a if you
[2:01:45] come to a a log jam on water baptism,
[2:01:49] for example, and I show you that every
[2:01:51] person in this Bible from one cover to
[2:01:54] the other that was baptized in water was
[2:01:57] baptized in the name of the Lord or the
[2:02:00] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Will you be baptized that way? Well, my
[2:02:07] church will not ask you about your
[2:02:08] church. my Bible school. Not asking you
[2:02:11] about your Bible school.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Not ask you about anything. Asking you,
[2:02:15] have you been baptized? You know, my
[2:02:17] wife is sitting here. This is Mother's
[2:02:18] Day. I'm glad for a wife and a mother.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be rebaptized.
[2:02:26] And I waited 3 4 months. We didn't have
[2:02:28] a didn't have a church that would
[2:02:30] baptize us.
[2:02:32] And she said, "Well, I was baptized and
[2:02:35] I feel very satisfied with my baptism."
[2:02:38] She was baptized about 12 years old. I
[2:02:41] said, "Okay."
[2:02:43] We didn't It wasn't It wasn't a big
[2:02:45] thing that we discussed at all. And one
[2:02:48] day
[2:02:49] she just said to me, she said, "I I
[2:02:53] would like to be rebaptized."
[2:02:56] And what she did was she took every she
[2:02:58] decided, "I will take every instance of
[2:03:01] every person that was baptized in the
[2:03:03] New Testament in the book of Acts." And
[2:03:06] every single one was baptized in the
[2:03:08] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; So they they'll cast maybe a bad name,
[2:03:14] oh you're Jesus, holy you're I don't
[2:03:15] care what you want to say. Call me a
[2:03:17] hypocrite or call me Bill's above or
[2:03:20] whatever, but I'm going to do what this
[2:03:22] book says.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, baptize in the name of
[2:03:29] the father." That's not a name. In the
[2:03:31] name in in the Son, that's not a name.
[2:03:34] in the in the Holy Spirit. That's not a
[2:03:36] name. In three titles, go down to the
[2:03:39] bank and try and cash a check in your
[2:03:40] title. Say, "I'm a husband." Say, "Well,
[2:03:42] I have to have more than that." Well,
[2:03:44] I'm a father. I'm sorry. Well, I'm a
[2:03:46] grandfather. No, that's not I'm a
[2:03:48] greatgrandfather. Surely you can give me
[2:03:50] some money. I need it bad. No, it says,
[2:03:54] "What's your name?"
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; What's your name?
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; You're going to transact any business,
[2:04:00] we want to know what your name is.
[2:04:03] Yeah.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Like old old brother Evans in India.
[2:04:07] Hey, Warhorse stood in the water while
[2:04:10] the people were being baptized and he
[2:04:12] told them clearly, "It wasn't the father
[2:04:14] that died for you. You're going to go to
[2:04:17] the water to be buried. The father
[2:04:19] wasn't buried.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't die on the cross.
[2:04:24] The Holy Ghost wasn't buried in a
[2:04:26] sephilar. God didn't go to a sephilar.
[2:04:29] Jesus Christ went to the selicer.
[2:04:32] Jesus Christ was buried and you're going
[2:04:35] to be buried with him.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; And how many people can you convince?
[2:04:44] And because they have another theory or
[2:04:47] another doctrine, I have to ask where
[2:04:49] did it come from?
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Not from here.
[2:04:54] Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "This is the seed."
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; And there's no life outside of the seed.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hold a seed in your hand. There's no
[2:05:06] life outside of the of the seed on this
[2:05:09] side or this side. And I say there's no
[2:05:11] life anything outside of this word of
[2:05:14] God. This is God's word.
[2:05:16] [Music]
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; In s we would see Jesus. Now, let me
[2:05:23] just stay with this a few moments. I'm
[2:05:25] not going to be much longer. Brother
[2:05:27] Lance is ministering tonight and I will
[2:05:30] be taking this up because I have a I
[2:05:33] have a lot of PowerPoint. I want I want
[2:05:36] you to read some of these quotes with me
[2:05:40] and a whole lot that I haven't I won't
[2:05:42] have time for with this morning. Is this
[2:05:44] all right? If we take a service like
[2:05:46] this in service, we would see Jesus. He
[2:05:50] said, "Remember before this," and
[2:05:52] brother Brandham was talking about the
[2:05:53] judgment.
[2:05:55] Before this happens, before the judgment
[2:05:57] happens, the church has to go. So, we're
[2:06:01] at the end time.
[2:06:03] We're right in the shadows of his coming
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; right now.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; 1957.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful to see that he's come
[2:06:17] down to prove his word.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's done what?
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; He's come down to prove his word.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; If it's before a dozen or before a
[2:06:29] million,
[2:06:31] but it'll pass right through the people.
[2:06:35] The million will never know about it. A
[2:06:39] million people,
[2:06:41] half the population of Vancouver.
[2:06:44] It will pass right through them.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they won't know a thing about
[2:06:50] it.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; They won't even say, "I just had a funny
[2:06:54] feeling." No, there'll be no feeling at
[2:06:57] all.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; And the scripture will have been
[2:06:59] fulfilled.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; This isn't what you expected to hear
[2:07:02] this Sunday morning, I'm sure. But this
[2:07:05] is intended to send you away pondering
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; very, very deeply.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; And it'll pass right through. He said,
[2:07:15] "It's always been that way."
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; The prophets, pastor, oh my, I could
[2:07:20] start preaching on it. I I I hope you
[2:07:22] can bear with me. He said, "It's always
[2:07:25] been that way and it always will be that
[2:07:28] way."
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; And we're we're not in it always was
[2:07:33] that way, but we are in the all
[2:07:36] will be that way.
[2:07:40] He says, "And then they'll wonder
[2:07:41] something. Well, I didn't uh really I
[2:07:44] didn't know it. Uh God's God God eyes
[2:07:48] but can't see. Brother Brandham says in
[2:07:51] a message a door in a door.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; He says, you know, one day the Bible had
[2:07:56] foretold of a great coming prophet that
[2:07:59] was going to gather Israel together. And
[2:08:02] when he came, you know, he passed right
[2:08:05] through the people and they didn't know
[2:08:07] it. And then one day Jesus was speaking
[2:08:10] to his disciples, the son of man's going
[2:08:12] up to Jerusalem and so forth. And they
[2:08:14] said, why why did the scribes say that
[2:08:17] Elias must first come? Now his own
[2:08:19] disciples are asking him, why did the
[2:08:21] scribes, this other group say that Elias
[2:08:24] must first come and restore all things?
[2:08:26] And he said, I say unto you, truly Elias
[2:08:29] will first come, but I say that Elias is
[2:08:33] already come and you didn't know it.
[2:08:36] telling the disciples, "You didn't know
[2:08:38] it. He went right through."
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. Likewise, the son
[2:08:46] of man.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hello, friends.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Cloverdale Bible Way.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; I would be honest with you.
[2:09:06] You know, some are satisfied just to be
[2:09:08] associated with believers. So, well,
[2:09:12] you're good people, nice people. I want
[2:09:14] to be part of it and my children to the
[2:09:17] school. I I see the young people. I want
[2:09:19] I see the young ladies. I want my
[2:09:21] teenagers to be this way. I want
[2:09:26] And there may be others who say, "I'm
[2:09:29] going to go completely the other side."
[2:09:31] say, "Brother Biscll, it's been a real
[2:09:34] struggle for me. I don't even know why
[2:09:36] I'm hanging on, but there's something
[2:09:38] inside that won't let me go.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; It will not let me go.
[2:09:46] I'm going to be perfectly honest,
[2:09:48] perfectly frank. That's why I came here
[2:09:50] today.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to preach this morning.
[2:09:54] I've been suffering severe jet lag.
[2:09:57] I'm going to tell you
[2:09:59] if the rapture happened right now and I
[2:10:02] was asking myself
[2:10:04] are there any in this church going to be
[2:10:06] left
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; and I say yes there will be
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; at this time you say are I I I would
[2:10:14] like to hear something positive. This is
[2:10:16] the most positive thing you can hear
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; is you need to pull up your spiritual
[2:10:20] bootstraps.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; You need to get real serious with God.
[2:10:26] Amen.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; It's not a sufficient say, well, we'll
[2:10:31] come to church on Sunday morning or it
[2:10:34] doesn't matter if we miss or you know, I
[2:10:37] can just live I can live partway in the
[2:10:39] world. I live partway here. Sometimes I
[2:10:41] see a face come in and maybe don't see
[2:10:43] them for weeks and weeks, but they come
[2:10:45] in some shake hands and how are you? I
[2:10:47] call them sister. I call them brother.
[2:10:51] But you'd want me to be honest. If they
[2:10:53] said to me, "Brother Ed, do you think
[2:10:56] I'm going to make it?" I'd say, "No, I
[2:10:59] don't think you are not living where you
[2:11:02] are."
[2:11:04] And I think if you asked yourself that
[2:11:06] question down in your own heart and
[2:11:07] soul, I this isn't condemnation now
[2:11:10] because there is a people who say,
[2:11:12] "Absolutely.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I know.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; I've tried to let go lots of times. I
[2:11:20] can't let go cuz he won't let go of me.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Hey friends, we're not here to go to
[2:11:26] church.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; We're here to participate
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; in the in the taking away of the church.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; We're not even looking for his coming.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the forerunners message is
[2:11:38] all about.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "You will introduce
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; the bride to Jesus Christ." and she goes
[2:11:46] from here to the to the supper.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for something to
[2:11:52] dispense out of the sky.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Christ has come in that regard
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; and it's passing directly. His first
[2:12:00] coming passed through the Jews and his
[2:12:02] second coming passed through the
[2:12:04] Gentiles.
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:08] Now, there's been those that have gone
[2:12:09] off, maybe gone off and assumed certain
[2:12:13] things and made certain statements, made
[2:12:16] certain declaration. We don't have to
[2:12:17] make any declarations. Anything I'm
[2:12:19] saying, I'm going to back it up by a by
[2:12:21] a quote.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; I back it up by the word of God.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Even when the prophet of God says it'll
[2:12:28] pass right through, I want to see it in
[2:12:30] the scripture. And I see where the
[2:12:32] spirit of Elijah passed through in the
[2:12:34] form of John the Baptist. I see where
[2:12:36] Jesus Christ passed through. I see where
[2:12:39] the resurrection passed through. I see
[2:12:41] where the ra where the catching away and
[2:12:43] the ascension of Christ. It all passed
[2:12:45] through.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say the same
[2:12:48] characteristic is with us today.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Don't think that anything has changed.
[2:12:54] It's the same characteristic.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; And we can say, well, you know, we're
[2:12:59] we're we're a special elected of the
[2:13:02] elect of the elect and all the rest of
[2:13:03] it. Don't put a period behind it
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; because this revelation is keeping on
[2:13:08] moving
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; and there's door and a door
[2:13:25] and Jesus said as it was in the days of
[2:13:27] Noah. Notice what he's doing. He's going
[2:13:29] back. Can I just have five more minutes?
[2:13:32] I'm going to close. As it was at the
[2:13:34] days of Noah, so shall it be in the
[2:13:36] coming of the son of man, wherein eight
[2:13:38] souls were saved by water. What if today
[2:13:42] the rapture came and he took two from
[2:13:45] Tucson and one from Phoenix and around
[2:13:48] the world as a universal rapture will
[2:13:50] be. And the ones that rise from the dead
[2:13:53] will go to meet him in the air and steal
[2:13:56] away a mysterious thing. He asked the
[2:14:00] question, a mysterious thing. And then
[2:14:03] one of these days, judgment drops upon
[2:14:05] the earth. Remember my comment.
[2:14:09] God judged the earth. He judged nations.
[2:14:11] He said, "I'm going to send a famine."
[2:14:13] They didn't. The woman in in Elisha's
[2:14:17] time was caught in the famine. The
[2:14:20] nation wasn't recognizing, "Oh, this is
[2:14:23] what God said." No, they're just saying,
[2:14:26] you know, we're having tough times. We
[2:14:28] don't have as much food as we had yet.
[2:14:30] We don't have as much money as we had.
[2:14:32] We don't have as much things. We have to
[2:14:34] really tighten our belt. Things have
[2:14:35] really tightened up. It wasn't. They
[2:14:37] didn't recognize God's word and judgment
[2:14:40] was passing through the land.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; And you know what? And then God allows
[2:14:47] and on down the road, good times come.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; And now they got lots of rice and lots
[2:14:52] of oil and lots of meal. And so good
[2:14:54] times. That's exactly what happened.
[2:14:58] True.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; It's all through the scriptures. You
[2:15:00] might be saying and I hope it is.
[2:15:03] Oh,
[2:15:05] this is a very very mysterious. Yes,
[2:15:08] there is a very mysterious aspect
[2:15:12] because then I have to come and uh and
[2:15:15] this same prophet said, brother Brandham
[2:15:18] said very clearly, they'll be preaching
[2:15:22] after the rapture happened. They'll be
[2:15:24] preaching.
[2:15:25] And I just say, "Oh God, I don't want to
[2:15:29] even preach to you folks today." I say,
[2:15:31] "My heart, oh God, don't let me be
[2:15:34] standing here
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; thinking that I have a sermon
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; after this has happened." He says,
[2:15:40] "People will be coming to the altar
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; and they will be repenting and thinking
[2:15:46] they're getting saved."
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to throw that away,
[2:15:53] then throw it all away. Exactly.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; If you want to believe it, then let's
[2:15:57] believe all of it.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; That's the way it's going to happen.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; That is the way it's going to happen,
[2:16:04] friends.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Go to Israel. I've been there several
[2:16:11] times.
[2:16:14] And I I dare you to try to live the life
[2:16:17] that they live strict.
[2:16:21] live by what Jud Gerson Solomon said 600
[2:16:24] and some laws of the Old Testament and
[2:16:28] keep them
[2:16:30] and have their hair curls or whatever
[2:16:33] more the hetic Jews and they go through
[2:16:36] all of the ceremony.
[2:16:39] Two of them were Gershan and his wife
[2:16:40] were sitting in in my home and my wife
[2:16:42] wanted to confirm their airline
[2:16:45] and she got airlines on the phone on the
[2:16:49] Shabbat on Sabbath
[2:16:51] and they said well we need to speak with
[2:16:53] Mrs. Solomon.
[2:16:55] So my wife says you know hands the phone
[2:16:58] says Naomi they need to speak to you.
[2:17:00] Gerson says Naomi Naomi
[2:17:04] she said it's just to confirm the
[2:17:06] flight. Naomi, Shabbat.
[2:17:10] Shabbat.
[2:17:13] Okay.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; She went and sat down
[2:17:17] because
[2:17:18] electricity is fire and you don't have
[2:17:21] any fire on the Sabbath on Shabbat.
[2:17:25] That's how strict they are. Would you
[2:17:27] live by those laws?
[2:17:30] And yet the redeemer has already come.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. and already passed through and
[2:17:37] walked their land
[2:17:41] and spoke to them and left a record and
[2:17:45] left them apostles and left them a
[2:17:46] testimony and left them several hundred
[2:17:48] that were witnesses of the resurrection.
[2:17:51] And where did it go? Nowhere.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; And even that nation,
[2:18:01] it saddens my heart. some of the most
[2:18:04] corrupt out of Hollywood, Fox Brothers,
[2:18:08] Warner Brothers, and the movie star and
[2:18:11] the industry that has corrupted so much
[2:18:14] of the world has come from backsliden
[2:18:16] Jews
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; that have backsliden from their faith,
[2:18:20] from the original faith. And that's why
[2:18:22] the prophet says, I'm not talking about
[2:18:24] Wall Street Jews. I'm talking about
[2:18:26] those. And that's why the scripture says
[2:18:28] that God reserved 144,000 to himself.
[2:18:33] But then I looked and I saw another
[2:18:36] crowd. I saw another group of people,
[2:18:39] white robed people, thousands upon
[2:18:42] thousands, the bloodwashed of all the
[2:18:45] ages. My brother, my sister, the Holy
[2:18:48] Spirit didn't bring this message to your
[2:18:51] ears to play with it like a toy. He
[2:18:54] brought it to your ears because he
[2:18:56] intends to take you out from mortality
[2:18:59] to immortality.
[2:19:01] And I want to know if that's what's in
[2:19:02] your heart.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; And if this is no more than just a an
[2:19:07] association of people, then then you
[2:19:10] should just dispense with yourself and
[2:19:13] go and do your thing and fill your belly
[2:19:16] full of all the uh goblygook of the
[2:19:19] world and all the filth and the
[2:19:22] perversion. If that's what you want,
[2:19:25] have it. But you've got a tribulation
[2:19:27] coming. Thus sayaith the Lord.
[2:19:32] You've got a time coming that you'll
[2:19:34] call and he will not answer.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of God.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Am I angry? Not a bit. My heart is
[2:19:43] filled with compassion. I'm holding
[2:19:45] myself back because I just feel like
[2:19:48] bursting inside with weeping and tears.
[2:19:51] For we preach the gospel and people will
[2:19:54] hear the message, but they don't bend to
[2:19:56] that word. They don't heed that word.
[2:19:59] You need to heed it.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; And maybe you've seen it and you've got
[2:20:04] a certain understanding of it and you
[2:20:06] see the physical part and oh yes, I know
[2:20:09] brother Ed, sister Ruth, that's not it.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; I know the deacons and I know this. We
[2:20:14] go to church and we know it's 10:30 and
[2:20:16] so on. That had nothing to do with it.
[2:20:20] This whole place exists for one purpose
[2:20:24] and that is to see a people go from this
[2:20:27] world to another one. Because if this if
[2:20:30] this Bible teaches anything, it teaches
[2:20:33] that the last enemy to be defeated is
[2:20:36] death.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; And oh my brother, my sister, I want to
[2:20:39] see that happen.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to see death
[2:20:43] defeated.
[2:20:46] Hallelujah.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; I've thought more about my mother in the
[2:20:53] last few years
[2:20:55] than I have in probably 60.
[2:20:59] I missed a lot in life.
[2:21:03] Your boys,
[2:21:05] Brother Ed was six and a half.
[2:21:09] I remember like it was yesterday.
[2:21:12] I was standing right here
[2:21:15] and a little simple casket was right
[2:21:17] here. This isn't to make you feel sad or
[2:21:20] make you feel sorry for me, but I I was
[2:21:25] sitting right there. There were some big
[2:21:26] white liies, about three of them, on top
[2:21:28] of the casket.
[2:21:30] And a lady, she stepped over. I don't
[2:21:32] remember exactly who, and she broke one
[2:21:34] of these liies off and took my hands and
[2:21:37] put them together and pushed that lily
[2:21:39] down. And I was holding this big white
[2:21:41] lily in my hand and looking at that gray
[2:21:44] box.
[2:21:47] She was 32,
[2:21:49] never been sick.
[2:21:51] And I was holding that lily.
[2:21:54] Said something's wrong.
[2:21:56] Something's wrong. Something's terribly
[2:21:58] wrong.
[2:22:02] Our life could be so destroyed.
[2:22:06] I didn't understand death, but I'm
[2:22:09] holding this
[2:22:11] close to my heart. And that promise, the
[2:22:16] last enemy
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; to be destroyed is death.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; And oh, you can't feel what I feel. How
[2:22:23] fervent I am anxious to see that death
[2:22:26] destroyed.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; And the same book says, "We shall not
[2:22:32] all sleep, but we shall all be changed."
[2:22:36] I hold that to my bosom.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Have your money, have your position,
[2:22:41] have your job, have all of that, have
[2:22:43] your education, have it all. But for me,
[2:22:45] I'll have Jesus Christ.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; I'll have him who revealed himself in
[2:22:50] this hour.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; And if I go by the way of the grave,
[2:22:58] I have this promise also that we shall
[2:23:01] rise.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; We shall rise.
[2:23:05] and that resurrection morning we shall
[2:23:07] rise.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; So friends, I've been over my five
[2:23:12] minutes
[2:23:13] and so I'm going to close with this at
[2:23:17] this point.
[2:23:27] And I'm going to take this up probably
[2:23:30] starting right here where we're at. And
[2:23:32] you might want to bring a notebook.
[2:23:35] Next time, I don't know just what day,
[2:23:37] whether it be Wednesday or Sunday,
[2:23:40] but I'm going to give you a paragraph.
[2:23:42] I'm going to give you scripture. I've
[2:23:44] already commenced preparing for it.
[2:23:48] And this is really this is not this is
[2:23:50] not something that I just dreamed up or
[2:23:52] studied in the last few days. This has
[2:23:55] been
[2:23:56] burning on me for a few years.
[2:24:00] And I have seen this. And if you want if
[2:24:02] you want to do something for your own
[2:24:03] benefit,
[2:24:05] if you have not got the message, the
[2:24:08] unveiling of God,
[2:24:11] believe it's volume nine, book one.
[2:24:16] Brother Brandham says more in this two
[2:24:19] or three pages than you will hear in the
[2:24:22] best and the biggest ministry in years.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; They can preach for years. And if you
[2:24:29] stay and absorb it,
[2:24:31] you might want to absorb it like I do.
[2:24:34] You know how long I've been reading?
[2:24:39] 22 pages?
[2:24:41] Probably a week.
[2:24:44] Probably a week. I've been reading 22
[2:24:46] pages.
[2:24:49] And Marco, if you're here,
[2:24:52] you picked up on that.
[2:24:54] I'll read a paragraph
[2:24:57] and I'll go back over it.
[2:25:00] And when I just read something
[2:25:03] like this simple, now my subject this
[2:25:05] morning
[2:25:07] is to reveal or unveil that God.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's enough to stir me right to the
[2:25:16] bottom of my souls of my feet.
[2:25:20] The subject this morning is to unveil
[2:25:23] that God. And I say and I want you to be
[2:25:27] able to say, "Oh, Father God, reveal
[2:25:31] yourself to me. You sent this message
[2:25:34] for that precise purpose." And I can
[2:25:38] guarantee you this messenger doesn't
[2:25:40] vary from the word of God. Everything
[2:25:43] that is in there, you'll find it in the
[2:25:45] word of God. It is unveiling God of the
[2:25:48] word.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:52] Hallelujah.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I'll have the musicians and I'm going to
[2:25:56] sing one of my favorite songs, if not my
[2:25:59] favorite songs.
[2:26:01] Blessed Assurance.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; We're born of his spirit and washed in
[2:26:15] his blood.
[2:26:22] And there may be those of you.
[2:26:26] I'm not having an altar service,
[2:26:29] but there may be some, and I know there
[2:26:31] are, that need to make an altar right
[2:26:35] where you're at.
[2:26:38] Say, "Oh God, I consecrate and I
[2:26:41] dedicate myself to you in a new and a
[2:26:44] living way.
[2:26:46] I dedicate myself. I have been I have
[2:26:49] not been serious
[2:26:52] about my soul.
[2:26:58] You people that are working, you have
[2:27:00] jobs.
[2:27:03] How do you think your employer would
[2:27:04] look upon you if you treated your job
[2:27:09] or your profession
[2:27:11] the way you treat this message?
[2:27:14] Well, you know, if I have time or if it
[2:27:16] works into my schedule, that won't work,
[2:27:19] friends. That won't work. And quite
[2:27:22] frankly,
[2:27:24] I'm not here to win any medals.
[2:27:29] I'm here to speak the truth.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; And if this was my last service, I won't
[2:27:34] apologize over it. And if I get one or
[2:27:38] two that take me serious today and say,
[2:27:42] "Brother Ed, that service changed the
[2:27:45] way I'm looking at things. It has
[2:27:47] changed.
[2:27:48] It's changed my agenda." That's what I
[2:27:51] pray.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, brother?
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Sing it up with me, please.
[2:28:06] Jesus is.
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:12] Oh, what a
[2:28:14] [Music]
[2:28:15] taste of glory.
[2:28:23] air of salvation.

[2:30:31] This is my story.
[2:30:36] This is my song.
[2:30:42] Praising my Savior
[2:30:47] all day long.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Before we sing that last verse,
[2:30:54] I know that your heart is pricricked and
[2:30:58] stirred and you might be saying,
[2:31:01] "Brother Ed, you spoke very, very
[2:31:03] serious.
[2:31:05] Brought me to a very serious moment.
[2:31:09] But tell me what to do. Don't leave me.
[2:31:11] is hanging here with all these
[2:31:13] questions.
[2:31:15] What must I do? I'll tell you exactly
[2:31:17] what to do.
[2:31:20] And I feel that the Lord led me this
[2:31:22] morning to say this to you. You should
[2:31:25] take the same exact pattern of the two
[2:31:29] men on the way to Emmas. I cannot get
[2:31:32] away from this because brother Brandham
[2:31:34] said this is a prophecy.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:38] of thing of modern events made clear by
[2:31:42] the prophecy. That's the prophecy.
[2:31:46] And those two men represent all kinds of
[2:31:49] people
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; because number one, they were believers
[2:31:53] of the message.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer?
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; They were following Christ,
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; the word.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Are you?
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:06] things were happening that they didn't
[2:32:08] understand. Have you had that happen?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. And now they're doing more. They're
[2:32:15] pondering it, Brother Ernie.
[2:32:18] They're communing with one another.
[2:32:21] They're not saying, "Oh, hi Peter. How
[2:32:23] do things go today? How's the job? You
[2:32:25] got a new job? Oh, what's the schedule
[2:32:28] like? What what's the salary? Oh, we're
[2:32:30] having tough times. Oh, what's the
[2:32:33] economy?" They weren't talking about
[2:32:34] that.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; They were talking about him.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; What's happening,
[2:32:41] sir?
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; How's things going, brother Ernie, with
[2:32:43] the believers?
[2:32:45] How are things down there?
[2:32:50] How's God dealing with you? How's
[2:32:53] What do you think about this time that
[2:32:55] we're in?
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:01] When my wife went to high school, I see
[2:33:02] some of you young people in high school.
[2:33:04] You're going to be graduating shortly.
[2:33:06] My wife was in high school. She had one
[2:33:08] of her dearest friends.
[2:33:11] And they had decided, well, we'll never
[2:33:13] have a chance to get married.
[2:33:16] We'll never have a chance to have
[2:33:17] children
[2:33:19] because he's coming any moment. We're
[2:33:21] going to be gone.
[2:33:24] We're going to be 55 years married in a
[2:33:27] few days.
[2:33:29] Don't ask my wife. Ask her, "Are you
[2:33:31] sorry, Sister Biscll, that you believe
[2:33:33] that? Are you sorry that you had those
[2:33:35] feelings back then? Are you sorry as a
[2:33:37] teenager that you thought you may never
[2:33:39] get married, you may never have
[2:33:40] children, you may never experience these
[2:33:42] things?" I can tell you her answer right
[2:33:44] now. She says, "Not sorry one bit.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I believed it then.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; And I believe it more today than I
[2:33:52] believed it back then." There's no
[2:33:54] regrets
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; serving God. Amen.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; I hope you folks understand me. I'm not
[2:34:03] going to ask you to forgive me. I don't
[2:34:05] think I've said anything I want any
[2:34:06] forgiveness over. I just want your heart
[2:34:08] to be pricricked so deep. I want to see
[2:34:11] such a transformation.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; I even see this whole congregation, this
[2:34:15] whole church turned Godward.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with living a more holy
[2:34:21] life, a more separated life?
[2:34:26] Hallelujah.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; And if you're hearing God speaking to
[2:34:33] you, don't go out of these doors before
[2:34:35] you sacrificed and consecrated and left
[2:34:39] everything on the altar and saying, "I
[2:34:41] am thine, O Lord. I've heard your
[2:34:43] voice."
[2:34:46] [Music]
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to pray the Holy
[2:34:50] Spirit come down with such a mighty move
[2:34:53] so gripping in your heart that you won't
[2:34:55] be able to shake it. Even after you've
[2:34:57] left here, you won't be able to shake
[2:34:58] it.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; And here's the first word of this next
[2:35:03] verse. Perfect.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Submission.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; All is at rest.
[2:35:12] I am my savior. I'm happy and blessed.
[2:35:17] ex.
[2:35:19] [Music]
[2:35:27] I am my savior
[2:35:30] [Music]
[2:35:32] and happy and blessed.
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:38] Watching and waiting.
[2:35:42] Looking out
[2:35:48] with his goodness
[2:35:52] and are lost in his
[2:35:57] for this is my soul.
[2:36:03] This is my song.
[2:36:07] I'm praising my savior
[2:36:11] [Music]
[2:36:18] for this is my story.
[2:36:23] This is my song.
[2:36:28] I'm praising my savior
[2:36:33] all the day long.
[2:36:38] I'm going to sing this song
[2:36:40] just across on the other side
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; and I hope by his grace I expect to be
[2:36:49] there
[2:36:51] and I trust that you'll join your voice
[2:36:53] in
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; and that we of this congregation
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; will be able to sing.
[2:37:03] told someone the other day and this was
[2:37:06] really remarkable.
[2:37:09] I think I've told it here in the church.
[2:37:14] Sister Marlene Hilderbrand was on her
[2:37:16] last moments of life.
[2:37:20] She was not an old woman.
[2:37:24] And God laid it on Joanne's heart
[2:37:27] to fly up there
[2:37:29] to be at her bedside to deliver a
[2:37:31] specific message to her.
[2:37:35] And my wife went with her, asked her
[2:37:39] mom, "Will you come with me?"
[2:37:42] She walked up to the bedside.
[2:37:47] She said, "Sister Marlene,
[2:37:51] I don't know all her words, but said, "I
[2:37:53] feel that God sent me here."
[2:37:58] Brother Brennan's wife, Sister Hope, was
[2:38:00] passing away.
[2:38:02] And they called for him quick, but he
[2:38:04] didn't get there quite in time. And she
[2:38:06] had just passed.
[2:38:08] And he called her name,
[2:38:10] "Hope, Hope."
[2:38:14] And she stirred
[2:38:16] and opened her eyes. A young woman in
[2:38:19] her early 20s with two babies and the
[2:38:23] one baby dying right beside her of
[2:38:25] menitis.
[2:38:28] And her words were,
[2:38:30] "Why did you call me back?
[2:38:36] Why did you call me back?" Oh, Bill,
[2:38:39] it is so beautiful. She couldn't
[2:38:41] describe it.
[2:38:43] And Joanne said to Sister Marlene, she
[2:38:46] said she had so much to live for. She
[2:38:49] was just a young woman. She could have
[2:38:51] said, "Oh, Bill, I'm so glad you called
[2:38:53] me back. My babies need me.
[2:38:57] You need me. You need me in the
[2:38:59] ministry. God is using you.
[2:39:02] You need me." No, that wasn't in her
[2:39:06] mind. Right?
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; Just why did you call me back?
[2:39:11] Dear friends,
[2:39:15] I speak as your brother.
[2:39:18] I speak as your companion who walks with
[2:39:21] you.
[2:39:23] I speak to you as one who experienced
[2:39:25] life.
[2:39:27] You're 14. I'm 15. or I was 14 when I
[2:39:32] was praying and the Holy Spirit came on
[2:39:34] me and I just
[2:39:36] an old man raised his hand and said,
[2:39:38] "Make Eddie a preacher."
[2:39:41] That's the last thing in the world I
[2:39:43] wanted.
[2:39:45] But Jesus was 15. Jesus was 17. Jesus
[2:39:50] was 20.
[2:39:52] you young people. Jesus knows Jesus was
[2:39:57] had desires like anybody and he was
[2:39:59] tempted in all points like we are and
[2:40:04] yet without sin.
[2:40:10] This prophet said one more thing and I'm
[2:40:12] going to leave you with it.
[2:40:16] We're going to gather around a table.
[2:40:20] I expect to be at that table.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; It's called a marriage supper
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; of the lamb.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; And he says that the king will come in.
[2:40:31] I expect it with everything that's in
[2:40:33] me.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; He'll come in and we'll be having such
[2:40:37] tears of joy. It's over. Just think, not
[2:40:40] another temptation.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; Not another trial.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; We're not going to have any of this
[2:40:46] anymore. and it says, "Don't weep
[2:40:48] anymore, children. It's all over."
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; That is why I am preaching. That is why
[2:40:59] we're here. That is why I've come to
[2:41:03] such a subject as this. Because this
[2:41:05] must go beyond church. It must go beyond
[2:41:08] religion. It must go beyond just a
[2:41:11] profession. It must be something that is
[2:41:14] a revelation. It must go beyond your
[2:41:17] understanding
[2:41:19] into the unknown that you can't even
[2:41:21] understand and say, "I don't understand
[2:41:24] it, but I do believe it.
[2:41:31] [Music]
[2:41:35] Lift your hand if you wish and we'll
[2:41:38] pray together.
[2:41:42] Dear loving
[2:41:45] and precious Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:41:49] You're the one that suffered.
[2:41:52] You're the one that died and rose again.
[2:41:56] You're the one that spoke things that
[2:42:00] just baffle us, baffle my mind at times.
[2:42:04] And today Lord I felt so pressed for the
[2:42:08] last many days
[2:42:11] and pondering
[2:42:13] what it was that that you have actually
[2:42:16] done and what is happening in this
[2:42:18] message that is carrying on. And this
[2:42:21] message has not carried on to establish
[2:42:23] more groups and just establish some
[2:42:27] movement of people and a certain class
[2:42:30] of people. That's not the purpose you're
[2:42:33] calling. Oh God, you're calling us from
[2:42:36] this realm. You've called us from
[2:42:38] another dimension. You've spoken to us
[2:42:41] so clearly. Lord, make it make it
[2:42:44] abundantly clear. And I'm praying for
[2:42:46] those that have been lax. Those that
[2:42:49] have not been fervent, those that have
[2:42:52] not been zealous and they are standing
[2:42:54] here today and they know in their own
[2:42:56] heart, oh God, that where where they're
[2:42:58] at isn't sufficient. I pray that you'll
[2:43:02] move them on up, Lord. loose them in the
[2:43:05] name of Jesus Christ. And Lord Jesus, I
[2:43:07] pray that the powers of heaven now will
[2:43:10] honor my prayer as I come against the
[2:43:13] enemy Satan who's tried to bind, who's
[2:43:17] tried to burden down the people. They're
[2:43:19] encumbered with business. They're
[2:43:21] encumbered with their learning. They're
[2:43:24] encumbered with all kinds of things. I
[2:43:26] pray, Father, they'll rise above it
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. May they be
[2:43:32] loosed to serve you in the full capacity
[2:43:36] of their calling.
[2:43:38] I thank you for it. I commit them to
[2:43:41] you. I commit this word to you in Jesus
[2:43:45] Christ's name.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Let it be so.
[2:43:51] This is my story. Just sing the chorus
[2:43:54] again, please.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; This is my story.
[2:44:02] This is my song.
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:07] I'm praising my Savior
[2:44:12] [Music]
[2:44:14] all day long.
[2:44:20] For this is my song.
[2:44:26] This is my song.
[2:44:32] Praising my Savior
[2:44:38] all the day long.
[2:44:44] Hallelujah.
[2:44:46] Sing the wondrous
[2:44:50] love of Jesus.
[2:44:53] Sing his mercy
[2:44:57] and his praise.
[2:45:00] in the manion
[2:45:04] bright and blessed.
[2:45:08] prepare for us a place
[2:45:12] when we all
[2:45:15] [Music]
[2:45:21] rejoicing that will be
[2:45:26] when we all
[2:45:29] see Jesus
[2:45:32] will sing and shout the victory. Glory.
[2:45:38] For when we are
[2:45:41] into heaven,
[2:45:44] what they are rejoicing
[2:45:48] will be
[2:45:50] for
[2:45:54] Jesus
[2:45:56] will say and shout.
[2:46:03] Amen. Amen. I said God bless you. Go get
[2:46:06] some refreshment. If you feel like
[2:46:09] staying and being in prayer, that's
[2:46:11] fine. We won't we'll just dismiss in
[2:46:14] this way. Ask you to go quietly,
[2:46:16] reverently, and prayerfully and ponder
[2:46:21] what you have heard. If you have an
[2:46:24] opportunity, take out the unveiling of
[2:46:28] God. There's another one, the mighty God
[2:46:30] unveiled, but this is the unveiling of
[2:46:32] God. And if you read that this coming
[2:46:35] week carefully, prayerfully, and uh
[2:46:38] ponder what is in there,
[2:46:40] just there's some very strange things
[2:46:43] that he said in there, and I want you to
[2:46:46] be benefited by it. God bless you.
[2:46:48] You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:46:51] God bless you.
