TRANSCRIPT
========================================
at one time at one time were we all white our colored of the two which one was the curse put on now as far as we know I couldn't tell you where Adam and Eve were were white or brown or yellow or black I cannot tell you no one else knows but God alone I guess who is back there now in the as we come all as one language and one people until the Tower of Babel of confusion and then their languages went different and as far as we know they were all one peoples of that time and they broke up and Scattered in different parts of the world and some you take an animal you take any life that eats off of a certain sorrow it'll turn that color uh if he's a hunter here you just follow me a few minutes go down into Mexico and get to Kyle take up here in Arizona and get to Coyote go up in the north and get the same coyote watch the three colors get a hila monster that's raised in Texas and get one that's raised in Arizona look at the differ in see because it's a sorrow they live on see and now the Chinese the Chinese is a a yellow person Japanese and so forth and a Chinese the Ethiopian is a is the colored man of the Negro we have now and he went down to those dark countries down there and they and and they were and then the white man was the anglosaxon people which we are and of the the people here what we call the white people they come from England which was formerly called Angeline and because they were white and blonde and so forth they scattered up in the Ireland and Norway and so forth up in there and all come out of the Anglo Saxon people now which was first and which was was cursed there was none of them I know where you're trying to get to you're trying to get the ham I know where you're going the Ham's people now there was ham sham and Jeff now ham he he did not try to hide his father's nakedness but laugh and made fun of him and God put a curse on H for looking to his father's nakedness and not trying to cover up his shame and Sham and Jeff back up and thre their coats over their father when he was laying naked and now God told ham that his generation would serve the others now if you thought that was a curse of turning of dark well then the Jews dark also if you think that would be the the what we call the colored man or the Negro of this country at Che now you are to go over to India the Indians are way darker than the Negro I've been in both their countries Here's the the Ethiopian down there from Ethiopia and the African the colored man that we know today they're down there many of them still in the Primitive in their tribes just about like we was when Jesus comes the white people were just as primitive as the the native of Africa is now worse perhaps remember 2,000 years ago we were naked tribes man out with a with a boy and a on a stone ax of hunting that's exactly right we Anglo Saxon people that's act right so which was which I'll tell you the one today is cursed is the one that refuses Jesus Christ that's all the one that accepts Jesus Christ is blessed now you can't say I'll go get the Eskimo out of that land up Y and there he is up there and that man is darker than the colored people that we had here I'll go over to India and get the Indians and he is he's not a colored man he's really black he's blacker than this real black black color and he's what is called and he's an Indian well now in Africa we get some of the African people that are some of them are light color some of them are almost like white and some are are different ways you go the Jew you say all the Jews are are dark complexed the Jew is a brown person but I've seen a man one redheaded with blue eyes fair skin see so the whole thing is this we all come off of One Tree that's right and we was all cursed through the fall of Eden and we're all saved through the resurrection of Jesus Christ there it is so there's no curse the cursed is them that does not believe the blessed are those that do believe so there is neither one friend the black or the colored man or the white man or the yellow man then if the black man was cursed by being black then the yellow man is just halfway curse and then the and then the yellow man and then the brown man he's just two3 of the way cursed see and then the Africans about four fths cursed and I guess the Indian is really the cursed thing oh my how nonsense no it's a different climate and the things that the people lived in they turned tribes off and so forth there different look at the American Indians many of those the Navajo out there is a darker race of people than our colored Ethiopian people in this country the naol the PES or the kind of a copper color and the different tribes see so you out there amongst the Indians right here you find the black ones and almost and the Cherokee is almost as pale as we are the Cherokee and there right here in this nation the different trib so you see you can't say they're half cursed and always cursed there wasn't cursed because they're black it wasn't cursed because they were yellow or because they were white there's only one curse that I know of and that's unbelief of Jesus Christ but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
