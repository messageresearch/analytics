TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] I was in my home in Victoria British Columbia when I received a phone call from brother Branham and he was saying that I believe we're going to have a good hunt a brother Eddie we're gonna have a good hunt I had a dream or vision and he began to tell me a little bit about it and said that he would give me the full details when we met so when we met in Dawson Creek he said I had this dream or vision he said if it was a vision it'll happen exactly like that and in the vision he said there were two or three small fellows on the hunt I had arranged the hunt and there was only three of us including brother Branham brother bud silhouette brother branham and myself we were the three brothers Southwest Sun Blaine was not able to go on the hunt because he was in the far north in the Arctic on a survey crew and would not be able to be back for the hunt well so I thought well maybe it was just a dream I don't know but he brother Branham said we saw I saw this large animal and its horns trying to went back on its head and I said oh that may be a caribou he said well I don't know I haven't seen a caribou before but he said this was a dark chocolate brown animal I said no I said that caribou are like battleship gray and he said well no this was chocolate brown and he wouldn't he wouldn't stray from that description at all it was a dark chocolate brown animal so then he said there was in this in this vision or dream I saw one of the young men his hands were like this he said and they were spread out he said there was no hair on the arms on hands he said I would say and he kind of stopped like that looked up he said probably about eighteen eighteen years old now I would like to encourage the viewers to be real attentive to the details because this vision was six hours in the fulfillment and he said one of my one of my buddies was in a green checkered shirt well I had had a green checkered shirt and I had told my wife to before the hunt I said just throw that away because it had been tore and so on several times around here on the pocket my husband was going hunting he had this pretty good shirt green checkered shirt but it was torn around the pocket and I had mended it several times and he said go and get me another shirt it was a nice shirt doe skin soft nice hunting shirt and I said okay but I just didn't have time I didn't have a car I had the little girls you have to take a bus into town so I mended it again the best I could and I put it into his duffel bag and a way you went we got up to Dawson Creek I asked brother branham if he would tell the vision to my father so he related the whole vision that this dark chocolate brown animal and he had gotten that animal and had gotten another a grizzly bear at the same time and for me that was a shock I thought I'd lived in the north I had never gotten a grizzly bear myself and I thought that was outstanding and then we journeyed on the way up the Alaskan Highway to brother bud south which place and when we drove into the yard here all the children came out and including Blaine his son who was supposed to be in the Arctic and I said well your Blaine I thought you were away up and you wouldn't be able to go on this hunt well he said he just came back a couple of days ago and I asked brother self-weight we'll Blaine be able to come on the hunt well yeah he thought he better come on the hunt with us so suddenly now I saw that we were two or three little fellows on the trip and Blaine was fixing a little harness on the side of one of the buildings and I was standing there with him just the two of us and I asked him I said Blaine how old are you he said 18 why I said well I was just curious to know now we had a young fellow and he was 18 years old and myself and when brother branham was giving the vision I asked him to tell by the Southwick and his family at the supper table tell him about the vision so he got to the dark chocolate brown animal I said brother bud I always thought that caribou was a dark battleship gray well he said you know that is strange he said all every terrible that I've seen on the north side of the highway the Alaskan Highway has been a kind of a battleship gray and he used the same words he said and they are a bush caribou and all the terrible on the south side and west of the highway has been mountain caribou and they're kind of a dark chocolate brown color and I said well where are we going he said well we're going on the south side of the highway so things were coming together and I there was more weight to it being a vision and our being a dream and I the only thing was a young land with the chocolate or with a checkered shirt and when we got up to make our camp we made our camp and way down the valley it would be to my right we saw the on the skyline there were a few caribou and some mountain shape and so brother Southwick said well tomorrow I think that we should probably go up there it was probably two or three miles and so the next day we made our way up there and we got up on the ridge and ran into a few caribou and they scattered and one ran down this way and so I went on my we all split up and Blaine went one direction and brother branham and bud went another direction and I went one direction and I found a young terrible right I was needing meat and I shot that caribou and it was just dark chocolate brown and so Blaine came by and we dressed that caribou out and then we went back and met together and then we climbed up on a mountain ridge and brother branham said on this this vision there was a great panoramic and he moved his arm this way and he said unless great panoramic and then he says my friend in that checkered shirt was way down this way towards camp and camp was two three miles this direction and he said he was waiting there and on the way there I he said I got this large caribou dark chocolate brown and he said on the way then we saw a grizzly bear on the mountain and God gave me that animal in one shot and I was just kind of speechless and then while the vision was being fulfilled we sat on this Ridge and I just looked at this beautiful panoramic I can say that I wasn't really conscious of every detail of the vision but it was just we were caught up in and the beauty of the moment and the great mountain peaks on this side on the left side and spurring off onto our ridges and we were eight or lunch on this one Ridge and brother branham said what is that over there her brother bud and they took his binoculars there was two great caribou animals Bulls laying on our mountain glacier I think laying on a glacier because there's less bugs and there it's very nice and cool and they were laying there kind of sleeping I think and so brother bud laid out a plan he said well Blaine he said why don't you take brother Eddie and take the horses and go and get his meat and then journey down this way to this dry creek bed and wait for us and we'll come down and meet you so I suggested that we wait till we see if they got this animal which in about another half hour they did and came up over the ridge and got this large caribou bull animal and so then we went and got my meat and we journeyed down here to this dry creek bed towards camp what was strange that morning when we had just left the tent I fell into a creek and I thought my clothes wet and I said to the brothers just wait here and I will run home I'll run back to the tent which was a short very short distance and I and I opened up my duffel bag and there was this green checkered shirt and when you got up hunting and had that little mishap in the water and had to go back to the tent and open up his bag and there was the green checkered shirt and he said I told Ruth to get me a new shirt and she didn't do it but I didn't know that it was all a part of the vision you just do things without even thinking that there's anything spiritual tied to it I put it on and that's the shirt I had I had a green check Richard the vision and all of the details just it was not in my mind whatsoever I was cold and wet and I changed and and then I ran up to catch up with the other brothers and away we went so when we went down to this dry creek bed I had on that checkered shirt we waited Blaine and I we waited for about half an hour to an hour and Blaine said if they're not here in about another half hour he said I'm gonna go and find them and in the vision I was alone waiting for them another half hour they still weren't there he said so I'm gonna go and see if I can meet up with them because we didn't know what had happened we didn't know whether we missed them somehow or whatever so he leaves and now I'm waiting alone and I was waiting about another half hour and then I heard some voices and I just took a few steps to the trail and here came brother bud carrying this big terrible on his head on his shoulders rather we come all the way down that Creek but I'm packing that Tara bookkeeping hid and he kept watching for this this grizzly well you know it was like looking on the side of that hill up there only one button bush up on it you know just that short your ass it was just no bear there that's all you know all at once well we're getting funnier - where you guys was and I give give it up really a scene grizzly finally we were sitting down resting again and he pointed up there on the side to him he said what's that up there he did since as I glimpse it up there I knew it little bear so I said you know it was a silver tip about the same colors I know Rome milk cow it I had and I said we went when he said he you would shoot it you know to me it would like him shooting from here up to the top of that cliff up there better better or not I had no idea he would shoot that far and I uh I wouldn't letting anybody else shoot that far anyway you know they coulda crippled something there in old wood we had no time to to go around and come up from the back of that mountain it took us a day and so I said to him I said we'll have to let me at Bear golden night and come back after him tomorrow we can't get any closer this way he's looking right down at us oh he said I can tell him anything I doubted that really good I didn't seen you shoot that much that terrible right on top of that when he shot that boy when he shot that old Marius was coming he he pulled that young up and that's not my hair straight up yeah there and come on he fell probably that big big poplar over there from us like a night even with us like that he fell in that short train thing you'll there no I said you watching mine I'll go over and see oh did he is so he did but he was dead as could be film and another thing he said he said that gonna be too late and we wouldn't skin that bear out that night well I never dreamt up you know leaving a trophy over there a bear could have come home tore that all the pieces but that's the first thing we thought about you know leave it leave it till tomorrow every every word that he said come just as true through could be a path you know when you never even thought about it at the time but you thinking of it afterward I ran up to brother branham brother Brendan was standing there I said I put my hand out to shake his hand I said congratulations brother Brown and that's that's a lovely animal he said I got a bear - and I just tapped him on the shoulder I said oh you didn't get a bear the same day he said yeah I did and I felt strange I said well where is it and bud said well we're not able to carry and he said the hide would probably worth three weigh 300 pounds and I said well and I felt real strange and bud walked over to his saddle horse which was right there and went into the saddle bag and brought out a little round tape with a push button on the side and I was kind of amused I had lived in the wilderness all my life and had hunted and never saw anybody carry a tape and then I thought while he's a guide now probably is interested in you know the size of the horns etc and he brought out this little steel tape and he put it right down at the base of the horns it's a little Ridge there and he hooked the tape there and then the tape went into this curve and then around and every time he started to go around the bottom flicked out and then it so he started it again and followed it around trying to measure correctly and it flicked out about the third time he says to his son Blaine hold that tape in there and so Blaine knelt down on one day and spread his hands out 18-year old boy and then I began to feel real strange held his hands out and brother bud pulled up tape around brother branham said in the vision he just heard a voice saying it's 42 inches and that was it and I I put my head Blaine looked up while he was holding the tape brother but he held his two head over the tape to make sure where the black line and the black line of 42 inches fell at the last point of the horn and he said it's 42 inches and I I just felt overwhelmed and brother branham he did not look he just stood there erect and I was right because on his shoulder and he just said she said there it is it was all over and they grizzly laying up on the mountain there the horn was and the vision was over that took about six hours in total for the whole vision dark chocolate brown animal and I'm standing there in a green checkered shirt and the vision was completely fulfilled and I can say to all who hear this is a true report everything is true absolutely true [Music]
