Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know many Pentecostal peoples don't give up the thoughts of divine he sure they don't believe it I went to a Pentecostal church not long ago so have some seats we had an army and thousands were standing outside I went down and asked this Pentecostal brother he had about 500 seats I said could I rent them from you brother he said the holding that healing service I said yes sir he said I would let a person set on my seat that beli in Divine Healing there you are don't you laugh at the B if pois and breath you went off too much on denominational ends went off on big things trying to fashionate to Hollywood trying to do things like to do you're on the West Coast or any other coast trying to fashionate the world he saw you without it hated out of a bunch of school somewhere a bunch of incubator preachers that's right always felt sorry for an incubator chicken if that church hir didn't have any man that's way we turn our preachers to our degrees of psychology our great famous Pentecostal movement now before a missionary can go receive a great movement of Pentecost they have to go before sarus to see if their intellect is right you're a back TR when you get back Christ who is our inct is the Holy Ghost [Music]
