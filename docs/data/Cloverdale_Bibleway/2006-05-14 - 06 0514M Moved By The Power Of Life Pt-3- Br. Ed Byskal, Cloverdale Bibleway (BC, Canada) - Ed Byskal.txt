God truly is beautiful in all of his people. May all the glory be to the Lord. And brother Alan King is requesting prayer this morning for brother Sam McDonald who's in Glasgow, Scotland. He's on dialysis three times a day and just uh requesting prayer that the Lord would heal him. How many have a need this morning? Amen. We want to remember those that are away. Amen. And uh just are thankful for the Lord's many blessings. Brother, &gt;&gt; let's bow our heads. Father, we come to you this morning thankful that we are a people who have been birthed into a supernatural civilization. Lord, you have energized us by the sacred secrets and mysteries that you have revealed to us out of your word. You've given us a divine purpose, a divine nature. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that that we know you in the power of your resurrection, Lord. that we know the end of the book. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've shown us the entire contents all the way from from Genesis to Revelation. Lord, you've given us after the after the fact revelation. Lord, you've shown us the future. Father, to the point that we literally have tomorrow's headlines today. Lord, we're coming before you this morning lifting up those who are in need. Lord, our our brother Allen's friend, Mr. McDonald. I pray Lord that you would go and and wherever he's in whatever room he is in oh God Lord as your saints Lord take their their lick of fire and their that that that faith that's inside of them and Lord direct it to this brother Lord we know there's no time or distance in the spiritual realm and Lord we we just pray that you would move upon his body Lord raise him up to the glory of God and Lord if he needs a touch in his soul father reveal yourself to him as you revealed yourself to us, Lord. This great privilege and great promise, Lord, of knowing that we have a safety zone, where we can go and we can come under your great wings of protection, Father. Lord, we're so thankful for that. We're thankful for Sister Patty and Sister Norma, oh God, and how you've moved upon their hearts and on their lives. Lord, we lift up brother Thomas, Sister Joanne, as they're away. Lord, pray that you would minister to them and Lord, allow them to be a blessing. Lord, use their lives and use their testimonies for somebody while they're away. And Lord, we pray for a pastor, Lord, who's coming to bring the message this morning. I believe our pastor's coming. Lord, I pray that you would energize and and and supercharge him, Lord, with the thoughts and and and the revelations that you placed inside of his mind, oh God. Give him a freedom to come and deliver it, Lord, with clarity and with simplicity, Lord, that we might receive it, that we might be lifted up into those realms of glory, oh Father. We ask all these blessings in your precious and holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] And you may be seated. Our sister uh Victoria Adamora has a song. Sister Victoria, if you could come at this time, get ready. We want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. And uh if you're here and you're a visitor, we just uh want you to know you're real welcome. and we trust that you'd um enjoy the presence of God here with us this morning. We want to greet all the mothers this morning and Mother's Day. Glad to have my mom here this morning and uh and all you mothers. We're just uh real happy to have you here and uh we're thankful for our mothers. Amen. Um, there is a young people's meeting this Friday, May the 19th, at 7:30 p.m. And also the following Friday, May the 26th, uh, again at 7:30 p.m., I think. So, this Friday and next Friday.

I think the young people are acting as the guides at the open house that's going to be here and open to everyone here at the church. Amen. Sister Victoria I'm happy to stand before you this morning to sing this special number. It's a testimony. My Lord Jesus fulfilled his word of promises to me during my accident last year. He promised and he fulfilled it. I made a vow to him and I'm here to fulfill it. Mama [Music] Jesus. Glorify the Lord. Glorify the Lord. The Lord is worthy to be praised. My brethren, glorify the Lord. [Music] Jesus Jesus. [Music] I know not why God's wonderous grace to me he had made known nor why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me for his own. I know not how his saving faith to me he did impart, nor how believing in his word peace within my heart. But I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is aable to give those which have committed unto him against that day. I know not how the spirit moves. Convene sin men of sin revealing Jesus through the world cateing faith in him. I know not what of good or evil may be reserved for me. Of wey [Music] golden days before his face I see. But I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which have committed unto him against the day. I know not when the Lord may come at night or noon day fair, nor if I walk the veil with him or meet him in the air. But I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to give those which have committed unto him against the day. But I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep those which have committed unto him against that day. Amen. [Applause] Amen. Do you know? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a promise that we can know. We've got a baby dedication this morning. And uh as brother Biscll comes, uh we're thankful for the blessing that God's given brother Jason and Sister Remy. So, they're going to come at this time. And as they come, let's sing. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given to wonderful things in the Bible. I see this is the dear that Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. [Music] In thissurance I find sweetest rest. Trusting Jesus I know I am blessed. Satan dismayed from my soul. Now I flee where that Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, it's wonderful to be able to start Mother's Day out by introducing another mother. &gt;&gt; You have just entered a very special place. Sister Emmy, this is uh you're beginning now the gospel according to mother. Brother Bram talked about this gospel. Brother Jason, Sister Emmy are here to dedicate their son, Shawn Edward Lock Ashdone. Sure, there weren't another one or two you could add in there. Shawn, which actually is John, Jehovah has graced. Ed we know is witness and lock is stronghold. And I found some interesting things about that name. May not have come from where you think it came, but nevertheless, I thought of the scripture which I'm just going to read and then I'm going to read a number of scriptures. Hannah said, "For this child I prayed." And I thought it was very fitting for Jason and Emmy. for this child. I prayed and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him and I believe there are this church prayed that our brother Jason, sister Emmy would be able to have this child and uh the grandparents undoubtedly prayed and we have brother Gil and sister Karen and Emy's mother here uh to be with us at this time and that's very very special. were happy they were able to be here. Hannah, however, didn't only pray for this child. So, I'm just going to take a few moments. Hannah prayed a prayer of thanksgiving after she had the child. And I can tell you this woman was a very spiritual woman because she she makes really no reference to how much she had prayed for the child and that God was so gracious to give. But this is her prayer and I want to read it. And Hannah prayed and said, "My heart rejoicth in the Lord. Mine horn is exalted in the Lord. My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation." She was different from the others. "There is none holy, is the Lord, for there is none beside thee. Neither is there any rock like our God. Talk no more so exceeding proudly, excuse me. Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. They that were full have hired out themselves for bread, and they that were hungry ceased. So that the barren hath borne seven, and they and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. The Lord kleth, and the maketh alive. He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich. He bringeth low, and lifteth up. He raisth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dung hill. So set them among princes, and make them inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are the lords, and he hath set the world upon them. He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness. For by strength shall no man prevail. The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces. out of heaven shall he thunder upon them, and the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. Now, that gives a little insight into the woman that God heard and gave a child and she said, "For this child, I prayed." And now, she didn't go on in some emotional realm. She went on to glorify God. And I would say that may this child that God has given to our brother Jason and sister Emmy, may he be a child that will be brought up at the hands of a mother that knows God. Emmy, you have made some difficult decisions in your life and you stand here. Brother Jason, I believe, is the first son that was born in Cloverdale Bible Way. not the first son that was here, but the first son that was actually born in the church. And now it's amazing to see that he has come this distance and has given his life to the Lord. And now God has given him a son. And I pray that they shall raise him to the glory of God. Amen. We're going to dedicate. Amen. how gracious you are, Lord. &gt;&gt; You've heard the many prayers that have been prayed. &gt;&gt; And you've seen the hearts the hearts of this this couple that is here, our brother Jason, Sister Emmy. You've watched over their lives. You have watched over their footsteps. And Lord, I believe it is their deepest desire not only to serve you and give you theirelves unreservedly, but now they are holding this son which they have now uh been given a gift of God. And Lord, as I as I hold this son in my arms, I hold them Lord Jesus as you would hold him. And Lord, as you have given him, now they give him back to you. We dedicate Lord Sean Edward Lockach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to the service of Christ. Oh God, as Hannah brought Samuel and gave him and returned him to you, Lord Jesus, this couple now brings him and I pray that you will take Shawn, Lord. I pray you'll take this son and use him to your glory. And if time should go on, may he raise up and be like his father, a blessing to the assembly. May he be like his mother, a stable, steady uh one who's got her eyes upon the goal, fixed upon the goal. And Lord, I pray you'll bless brother Jason, sister Emmy as they instruct him. And I ask oh God that your blessing will be upon their family Lord that you give them good health and that you will prosper them Lord in spirit spiritually and materially in every way according to your will in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one fine boy. May there be many more. God bless his brother Rod. It's a quartet. Uh brother Mike Gier and some others who are going to come and sing this morning. And as they come, let's sing together. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor, Lord. I give you praise. [Applause] You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. Lord, I bless your name. I give you honor. I give you honor. I give you praise. You are the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] [Music] Amidst [Music] the hustling, clamoring world, sometimes it's hard to hear the voice of God speaking to my soul. But in my quiet time alone, when I approach his holy throne, his tender words fall gently on my ears. He still speaks. I know his voice. Sweeter sound. Never ever heard my mortal ear. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me, it makes me rejoice. He still speaks. &gt;&gt; I know his voice. [Music] There are so many who still doubt that God can speak today. They laugh and mock when we say we've heard from God. Yet the still small voice of God is heard above the doubts of this world. It's time his words ring out with hope today. He still speaks. I know his voice. Sweeter sound never heard by mortal ears. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me, it makes me rejoice. He still speaks. [Music] I know his voice. He still speaks. I know his voice. Sweeter sound never heard by mortal ear. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me, it makes me rejoice. He still speaks. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know his voice. He still speaks. He still speaks. I know his voice. [Laughter] [Music] I know his voice. [Music] [Applause] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. I was I was singing that the other day in the car and I mentioned it and here the brothers got all ready to sing it this morning. Amen. Well, this is Mother's Day. the world is remembering it and they've commercialized about everything that can be commercialized. But nevertheless, we're not going to lose sight of how precious mothers are to us. And we are thankful for each of you mothers that are here today, godly mothers that have heard the voice of God, have responded, and the children have an example. how wonderful it is. Uh and there are many others who are not mothers but that still does not take away from the fact that you have a part in that you are an example. Uh, I said a few words to the school teachers the other day and it it came to me that they spend so many hours with the children of the families that are here in the congregation and that while they have all of this time with the parents uh the parents have committed the children and they have all of this time with the children of these parents. I thought of the phrase which I just used in the dedication, the gospel. Brother Brandham said there are five gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and mother. And I don't think he said that just to uh give uh some poetic license to the phrase, but the mother is indeed a gospel to the children. And uh but in the gospels as we read Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, we find that there are many others that are included in those gospels that make up part of that gospel. And I I felt to say to the to the teachers, you are part of the gospel according to mother because you are playing a very very integral part in the lives of these children. But I want to say to the whole congregation today, it doesn't take just the mother, but there are others in the congregation that you interact with these children. And we we also have a responsibility of having example to them. And I can think of my childhood and think of those who I uh interacted with and looked up to. They weren't my mother, but they certainly had an effect upon my life. And I'm glad for their lives. I'm glad for every mother. I'm glad for the mothers that are not here that have gone on to their reward. And they have laid the laid their their life down. They have their record is already been finished and they've gone on to their reward. And we're thankful for those. And my mother joins uh that crowd. She's part of that host of witnesses. And so each one of us I think of what brother Brandham said about about his mother after uh the time she had just passed away and he said how many times uh I'm sorry he was talking to her at her bedside just before she passed away. And I I happened to be listening to the messages last week. I listened to a spirit of truth and brother Brandham talked so much about his mother in that in that uh message. She had already passed away but he said that how many times you walked away from the table so I could have something to eat. And she said it was just a duty. She felt that was just something she needed to do. walk away from the table when there wasn't enough for for all the children to eat. And uh we read of prayers of a mother. Uh my wife and I were speaking on the way here to church about the love of a mother. And brother Brandham related the instance of the uh colored woman, the mother in Memphis when the plane landed and because of a snowstorm and could not take off until the next morning. And uh he related, I I thought today that I should perhaps list down all the conversations that he had with me because it would be a blessing, no doubt. And I don't think it was done by accident. And when he related this account, he looked at me and said, "Brother Eddie, what brought that plane down? What brought that plane down in that snowstorm?" And I didn't have an answer. And he said, "The love of a mother, the love of a mother brought the plane down. The love of a mother caused a snowstorm that brought Elijah to her door. I tell you what, friends, you you you we possess things that we don't realize we possess. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; The love of a mother and then the gospel according to mothers. So, we're thankful for our mothers. And uh it's a shame that we are just spending so few minutes speaking about them. We could spend a long time speaking about our mothers and those mothers that we have today that are here present and those that are not with us but they are connected to us today in the internet. We're we're so thankful for each one of you and I say may God's blessings be upon you. Amen. I'll have you stand. We're going to read. We're thankful also to have our sister Norma with us. I believe I looked back and saw our sister Norma, a real soldier. God bless her, a real mother. Others that are have made a a special effort to be here today. Uh God bless you. And my uh my sister is here as well. Many of you don't know. She was taken to the hospital a few just a few days ago. And uh so we're believing for all of these. Our brother Mike Vineyard, God bless you. We have needs here friends. We have needs. But we have come to the fountain. Amen. Just before we uh read the word, let's pray. Our gracious father, how we depend upon your supply and your provision. Lord, as we come to speak before the purchase of your blood, the people that you have sent to journey together and sojourn together, I pray that you will cause this to be a special meeting time. And it can only be special if the Holy Spirit will feel at liberty to take control of the minds and the hearts of the people. I have already asked you, oh God, to take control of my mouth that I may say only those things that would be pleasing to you to instruct the uh the people along their journey to give revelation to those that perhaps have not received that Lord for your word can only be understood by divine revelation. And I pray that that will be our portion. Oh God, move back the clouds. Move back the doubt, oh God. Move back skepticism, oh God. Move back every hindrance. And let your people that you have purchased and have ordained to life and ordained to the revelation of your word and which is the revelation of yourself. Oh, we want to see you, Lord Jesus, in all of your beauty. I pray you'll captivate us now by the Holy Spirit and energize us. And may the angels of God that surround this place and stand at their post of duty it beside each person. I pray oh God that the we will feel the influence of it as your prophet messenger has said we will feel their influence. And Lord I pray that you will be lifted up and glorified in this service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to read from John the first chapter just a few verses starting with verse one. John 1 and 1. Everyone feeling good? &gt;&gt; That's good. Beautiful day. Sun's shining outside. Let's have him shine inside also. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of man. We'll cease to read there and you may have your seats. I would like to get your thoughts immediately uh in line with what I want to bring to you this morning as as quickly as possible. Each one of us that are here today, we are we have human life coursing through our bodies. we have uh a pulsating of natural life, human life. But then there are also those of us and I trust by God's grace I can say each of us that are gathered here have another life pulsating in us and it is God's life called Zoey life. Uh I would like if you would watch and see some uh slides which I have prepared and these slides are just to give us a a basis for the comments. I will be kind of referring to them as we move on. So we will I'm just going to move through them. God's life. Zoe life I don't. All right. Life in the absolute sense. Life as God has it. And that which the father has in himself. This is Zoey life. Life in the absolute sense. Life as God has it. And that which the father has in himself. God's life. Zoey life. In the token message, we have this quote. Eternal life comes from the word Zoey, which means God's own life. Further in that token quote, "The only way that you ever can have life, there's only one form of eternal life, and that's God's own life in you. Then you have eternal life because he is the only eternal there is." And we are the attributes of his thoughts before there was even a foundation of the world or anything. All this is just his thinking and we're the display of his thoughts of what it was, what his thoughts were. We're the display of his thoughts. And now Zoe life is life that the father gave to his son Jesus Christ to have in himself. John 5:26. For as the father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself. This is the Zoey life. Life which the son manifested to the world. John 1 John 1 and2. For the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us. wasn't just with the father but was manifested unto us. &gt;&gt; And from this life, man has been become alienated as a result of the fall. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:18, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart. Through this life, man, men men become partakers through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. For John 3:15, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. That's the life we're speaking of. Now, Christ in truth is our life. Colossians 3:4, "When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory." Jesus Christ now maintains that life. John 6 and35. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life. That's the maintains the life. He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. Also another scripture in this regard, John 6 and uh 63, it is the spirit that quickenth, the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. I love that scripture. They are spirit and they are life. The words that I speak. So the word becomes ultimately supreme. If you don't have the word, you don't have the bread of life. You don't have the word, you don't have life. If you don't have the word, you don't have Christ. And that is why Satan has such a uh such a turmoil and confusion going on over the word. &gt;&gt; What is truth and what is the word? Everybody can't have it because it's all different. &gt;&gt; And that is why our confidence is so strong in thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're only interested in thus sayeth the Lord and what God vindicates and what he confirms. &gt;&gt; This eternal life is the present actual possession of the believer. &gt;&gt; John 5 and 24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Amen. in modern events made clear by the prophecy. For you're a gene of your father, and you were in your father, yet your father had no fellowship with you. You were in there, but you knew it not, and he knew it not. But you were manifested that that that he might fellowship with you. And you being born again, you're born of eternal life. And that's the only one form of eternal life and that's God's life. Zoey, the Greek word is Zoey. Only one form of eternal life. Then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God, you were in God all the time, but he knew what bed and time you'd be planted. So now you're made a creature, a son of God, manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour. I can just stop there and say you'll never meet the challenge of this hour in just normal human life. &gt;&gt; You'll never meet the challenge of this hour with just human life being inspired by some other religious life or religious thought. uh you'll never meet the challenge of this hour merely by being stimulated &gt;&gt; by being stimulated by whatever it might be that stimulates a person. You'll never meet the challenge of this hour. But you'll meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour. The message that is coming forth in this time. &gt;&gt; It's the only way to meet the challenge of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then if you're a son or daughter of God, you were in God. You were in God all the time. He said, and he knew what bed. He knew where you'd be conceived. He knew where you'd be planted, where you'd live. And he ordained that you'd be here at this time. You're here, friends, not merely to, you know, fill a space in uh in the world, but you're here to meet the challenge of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul." Now the scripture tells us also in uh Genesis 1 and 26 that God said let us make man in our image. He formed man then secondly out of the dust of the earth. Now this life that said and the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils a breath of life. But that was that's Genesis 2 and uh and 7. But Genesis 1 and 26 said, "And so God created man in his own image." Now Genesis 2 and7 does not say that that was his own image. He said in 1 and 26, so God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. And then he says in 2 and 7, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. And man became a living soul. &gt;&gt; He breathed that breath of life, the first man into the second man, &gt;&gt; if you want to put it that way. And man became a living soul." Now in questions and answers, brother Brandon was asked a question uh he and and he and he reads a scripture. He formed them out of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils. And the question is what is the difference or where is the connection in the above scripture? What connection does the first man have with the second man? And uh he goes on he says the first man is the second man made manifest in five senses. &gt;&gt; The first man is the second man made manifest in five senses. The first man was made in the image of God and God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; So the first man is a spirit man. &gt;&gt; Amen. the first man and and by sexual birth we have missed actually haven't missed that first man but we missed being that first man that first man is the second man made manifest in five senses and then he goes on to say he said all right that's the connection God is determined when God makes up his mind to do anything it has to be Satan spoiled spoiled the picture by sexual desire by the woman to bring forth children. He spoiled it. So go ahead and make it. That's all right. He said this habitation to pick up these cuz the only thing that you can do in this life is to pick up your form and image of what you are. The only thing you can do in this life is you pick up your form and the image in this life. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're redheaded now, you'll be redheaded. If you're blackheaded now, you'll be blackheaded then. What you what you wear at your best. Satan interrupted the picture and you didn't get you didn't even get what God intended you to be that you'll be. And he said, "Oh, how glorious." And there's your man. Now, I'd like to make a few statements here because I'm just going to go slowly for a wee bit. death and life cannot exist at the same time. The kind of life that I'm talking about in questions and answers also he said death is not uh associated with life. Life and death cannot exist at the same time in the realms of the human being. Death is associated with sin because before we had any sin we had no death at all. Before we had sin, we had no death at all. But where there is death, then there is sin. And where there is sin, there is death. They are associated together. Because death is the results of sin. The soul that sinnth, it shall die. But when you're born again of the spirit of God, we have eternal life and not associated anywhere with death. &gt;&gt; When we have eternal life, because it's a different type of life, we're talking about human life, human existence, which through that human existence, man fell. And because of man's fall, then came judgment and came the separation from God. And death is associated with that life. But when a man or woman is born again, there is no death associated with that life. &gt;&gt; That is Zoey life, God's life. But when you're born again the spirit of God by the sp of the spirit of God we have eternal life and not associated anywhere with death. Death cannot associate with life. And I want to say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Life cannot associate with death. Now God commissioned Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the earth. That commandment, that commandment cannot bring forth death. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That commandment cannot bring forth death. How can God almighty God say multiply and replenish the earth and associated with those words is death is sickness is pain is suffering is trouble is starvation is all of these things how can those things be associated with the god the author of life &gt;&gt; so you see it was a different life that brought the world what we have today &gt;&gt; it was not that commandment oment. &gt;&gt; That's very important. &gt;&gt; We're going to get in some deep swimming water. So, just for a few moments, the commandment cannot bring forth death. In the spoken words, the original seed, I'm going to do considerable reading, so I hope you don't mind. He said, "Now notice what happened to Eve's children, the first one that was born. Now, if God said multiply to his bride, to Adam's bride, multiply and replenish the earth, that was God's commission. &gt;&gt; And she would have done it. She would have br she would have uh she would have done it and he would mixing themselves together. But what happened when Adam got ready to come to her? She was already a mother and said, "See what I mean?" He said, "Now the same thing has happened to Christ's church, Christ's bride. Her first child came forth. It was a bastard child and he was full of death and caused death. &gt;&gt; Cain was full of death and caused death. &gt;&gt; You just listen real close. And everyone since then is death. There's one thing that all humanity has in common. No man has escaped death. &gt;&gt; Enoch was translated. &gt;&gt; We do not know of any other that actually escaped death. We all are summoned to death. So he says when God give a commission when God give a commission which cannot perish God's words eternal it cannot fail when he said now I'm giving the quote see when he said multiply and replenish the earth that was God's eternal purpose &gt;&gt; to carry it out you cannot die &gt;&gt; you know this becomes this this becomes You you've got to really just absorb this because we got a foundation truth here. When God said replenish, multiply, and replenish the earth, that was God's eternal purpose. And to carry it out, you cannot die. So, Adam and Eve were not carrying it out &gt;&gt; when death was brought into the earth. &gt;&gt; That's just that simple. because it's his word. You have to live. And if the child would have been brought forth right, they'd have been there would have been no death because she because she wouldn't wait. He went on the word of God, the word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the earth. He said it couldn't find a place to land. But finally this word, this word, this word replenish and and multiply and replenish. He said this word finally caught into the womb of a virgin. &gt;&gt; It was that commandment that caught that commandment didn't catch into the womb of ma of Eve. That commandment caught into the womb of Mary &gt;&gt; and the virgin and what happened from him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Came forth the germ of life. &gt;&gt; The thing that gives the water and that gives the kernel its chance to reproduce itself. The spirit came out of him &gt;&gt; and went up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that spirit has come back down into the church. Oh, the depths of this word, friends, the depths of this message, that commandment, that commission to multiply and replenish the earth caught into the womb of a virgin Mary who could say, "Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word." &gt;&gt; And she brought forth the germ of life, none other than Jesus Christ. How thankful we are today. The first commission of God to Adam was be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. And God blessed them. I'm reading these now. I hope it's not too chopped up for you. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply." I just want the congregation to be settled. I just want you to be quiet and be real uh attentive. This is God's first words, first commission to Adam when he's been made in his image. For it's Genesis 1 and 28. Eve has not yet been separated from him. And God is saying, "And God blessed them plural. And God said unto them, plural, read your Bible and it'll show you. Genesis 1:25 says, "Let us make man in our image." Genesis 1:26, "And God made man in his image. And when he was done, he had one person on the earth, Adam." &gt;&gt; And Adam was essentially came out from God, a a a product of God. And and and God who is one had a man who was in his image on the earth. &gt;&gt; And God has all attributes within himself. He has all masculine attributes, all feminine attributes within himself. And now Adam has those attributes. And then God according to his purpose and plan in in Genesis 2 separates those attributes. But before he does, and he took the feminist part &gt;&gt; of those and put it in a in a in one called Eve. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what your Bible says. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea, etc., etc. Now, Satan, we could say Lucifer, this this master of cunning, this master of deception and deceit, this one that was created without any reproductive glands &gt;&gt; because angels do not reproduce. We say we get into little swimming water. You'll find no place in the scripture, no place where angels are male and female. &gt;&gt; No place whatsoever. In fact is they do not have reproductive organs. And Satan in heaven desired to have a position higher than he was in. And so it does not come as a surprise to me that Satan came down now and he's found in the garden. He does not have reproductive organs. He does not have that capacity. So, he comes to a creature called the serpent that does have it. &gt;&gt; And he's an upright being, a being that speaks to God. Actually, there's more conversation with the serpent between the serpent and God than there is between Adam and God. &gt;&gt; It's not some creeping animal uh or or or slithering creature on the ground. This is an intelligent creature. And the serpent now is utilizing his body. &gt;&gt; You know something now? I I I may be getting out into some territory here, but I'll I'll I'll throw it out anyway. Brother Brandham in his most just incredible ministry. He ventures into areas that are so uh pro that provoke our minds and our thoughts and it's good. &gt;&gt; We can find in the scripture where Satan uses animals You don't find God possessing animals. &gt;&gt; The only instance I know uh and it wasn't God possessing the animal but the but the mule or the donkey that Balam was riding spoke to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says when they possessed of the gatherines, &gt;&gt; the demon-possessed man of the gatherines, and the demons began to speak out &gt;&gt; and said, "Have you come to torment us before our time?" And they asked for leave that they might go into the swine. And Christ said, "Go." And with that one word, those demons went and possessed the swine. And their ultimate uh their ultimate goal and objective was was expressed in the swine. They ran down a steam pl steep place and were destroyed in the sea. Satan can possess an animal. &gt;&gt; But I don't know of any place where God possessed an animal. God possesses humans. &gt;&gt; God possesses a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Satan can possess an animal. &gt;&gt; There are no less than three times when a person have came before the prophet of God. And here were all kinds of of of revealing of the needs of the people in such an intricate way. In fact, this if you wish to listen to this message, the spirit of truth, he just told he told a number of testimonies. It sounds like he's storytelling one after the other. And one of them is the one that I was in. And he tells all about the checkered green shirt that I was wearing, the animal. I saw the tape measure come out. I saw the horns being measured. We all looked at it, heard the voice. It's 42 in. He tells it all in detail. Brother Brandham says God allowed that to comfort him because of the loss of his mother. &gt;&gt; He's going to lose his mother. And God allowed that to comfort him. He said, "You you might, you know, you might question that God would do something like that, but he did that to comfort him." I was so happy to be able to be on that. And that vision was probably 6 hours in the unfolding. Now, you can just imagine and at the end of that, you know that the people in Phoenix where he was telling it were just in a I think they were in wonderment. What is he saying? what's the objective of this service? You know, this isn't like preaching. And at the end, he says, "This the spirit of truth." He said, "It was all true. The vision was all true. They're always true." &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Now, how many have prayer cards?" Bunch of people raised their hand. How many people don't have prayer cards? He said about the same number raised their hand. So, he didn't call them up. He just started to talk to them right down. this woman, this woman here. Began to tell her why she's there, etc. And then just gave her her name. Went to the next person, says, "There's a woman at the back. You're at the back." So, you got cancer. He says, "You're shadowed. You're going to die. You got cancer in the breast." And he said, "She's missing it." Said, "Mary May." Now, Mary May didn't miss that one. And it went one after the other after the other. about five or six people just call them by their name, by their name, by their name, by their name. And finally, of course, the whole audience, you know, is in a in a in a state of euphoria because that catches that's something they can see. That's something they can hear with their but but all of that that was spoken before that was just as true &gt;&gt; as calling the woman Mary May &gt;&gt; or calling the other people by their name. It was just as true, but they were missing it. They were missing what the spirit of truth was trying to say. Oh, may we be sensitive. &gt;&gt; Amen. And catch what God has to say. And now I want you to be sensitive. A person comes up. Good evening, lady. A timid spirit. He says, "That's that's kind usually the kind of a little timid type. You've had many sorrows, too, haven't you, lady? many sorrows. Had a great scare once in your life, too. Something seemed like when you were a school girl. Oh, he said she's had many troubles in her life. She's looked down through her entire span of her life and drops down to one thing. you had a a scare when you were just a school girl and I believe it was a a dog or something along I see something bark and go on and you jump and scream you were just a little child and that hung all through her life and here comes a prophet God in such mercy &gt;&gt; come right down to that one thing that troubled her and another one and another one. Be not afraid. Three right in a row. How do you do? Said speak English. You do. You believe me to be God's servant? He said it's for your little boy. That's right. You believe God can tell me what's what's his trouble? You believe it? He's nervous. He's nervous. A mother's brought a boy. He's nervous. It's from a scare. A dog scared him. That's right. Now, here's God got a prophet messenger telling a mother what the trouble. They didn't know what the trouble was. They couldn't pinpoint it. &gt;&gt; I can tell you Satan uses &gt;&gt; the animal world. And here comes here comes Satan to use a serpent in a conflict between God and Satan. The Bible never denotes sex in angels. There's no denoting of sex in angels. There's no place in the Bible where there's a woman angel because a woman is a byproduct of a man. It'd all be the same. Like Adam was both Adam and Eve to begin with. She was taken from his side. So, Satan is a as a fallen archangel lusting for the un with unquenchable desire to be lifted up as God. There's two places in the Bible that says, "I will ascend." And Satan said it both times. &gt;&gt; Only two places in the Bible where anyone said, "I will ascend." And Satan said them both. What's he want to do? It's amazing that he comes now. He comes directly onto the subject of God's first commission multiply and replenish and it's something he can't do &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; he does not have the capacity &gt;&gt; does he is not a creature of that but he comes to use one in the garden that is the only one whose seed will mingle &gt;&gt; an intelligent creature called a serpent who beguiled Eve and did indeed sow seed in her. And God referred to that seed and said, "I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between thy seed." Listen, friends, if you're hearing a and cannot believe that, you'll have to swallow God's word in order to have life. And God's word said, "I'll put enmity between thy seed, serpent seed, and the woman's seed." And a woman does not have a seed. She has a field. She has a bedding ground. And the only woman who receives seed outside, the only woman of all the billions that have ever existed, the only woman who receives seed outside of a mental, outside of the human instrumentality of a man is one woman called Mary. &gt;&gt; Mary receives seed. And God was giving a promise. He was saying, "I'm going to put enmity." enmity clashing between your seed, &gt;&gt; the serpent, and the woman's seed. And the woman's seed was Virgin Mary's seed that she received from God himself. &gt;&gt; By the spoken word of God, &gt;&gt; Jesus came forth by the spoken word of God. He was not Jew. He was not Gentile. He was God manifest in the flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh and and God said, "I'm going to put enmity." Who was it that took up stones to stone him? &gt;&gt; Who was it that wounded him? Who was it that took him to a cross? Serpent seed. &gt;&gt; I'll put enmity between your seed and the woman's seed. And Satan now had succeeded in his attempt to come into a form that could be that reproduction could take place. And by that reproduction, we die. &gt;&gt; We all came by a natural birth through a sexual experience. I don't care who we are. And by that birth, we die. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "By the birth of the woman, we die. And by the birth of the man, we live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to take you to some scripture that started this all in my in my thoughts. And uh you'll have to forgive me if I'm just going a little bit laborious here. &gt;&gt; Turn if you would to Luke's Gospel, the 20th chapter. And we're going to read at verse 20. Jesus is answering the Sadducees concerning the resurrection. 27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees which denied that there is any resurrection. And they asked him, saying, "Master, Moses wrote unto us, if any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother." There were therefore seven brethren of the first, and the first took a wife, and died without children. The second took her to wife and and he died childless. And the third took her and in the manner in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died. Last of all the woman died also. Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? For seven had her to wife. And Jesus answering said unto them, the children of this world marry. Notice the children of this world marry and are given in marriage. Now he's talking about being childless and not bringing forth a child. So the whole subject isn't so much about the seven had her but they weren't a they had her because they were supposed to raise up a child supposed to raise up children and and uh the children of this world. Verse 34, marry and are given in marriage. But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain the world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage. Neither can they die anymore. For they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. Now he does not say that the angels are children of God. He said they are equal to the angels being children of God uh and are the children of God being the children of the resurrection. It's the children of the resurrection that that that give them this status of being children of God. &gt;&gt; Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed it at the bush. Verse 37. When he called the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, for he is not a God of the dead, but of the living, for all live unto him. Our God is not a God of the dead, but a God of the living. &gt;&gt; And the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now, Matthew records it just a just slightly different in uh in the 22nd chapter of Matthew. And we're just going to read just a few verses there. 22nd chapter of Matthew and verse 29. Jesus answering said unto them, this is a Sadducees now. He'd gone through the same preliminary part. You do heir, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven, but as touching the resurrection of the dead. Have you not read that that that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, God is not a God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. He's not the God of the dead, but a God of the living. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus is saying in the resurrection, we don't marry and we aren't given in marriage according to God's wisdom and his uh and and in his economy. We are here in this life. There's a number of things that we we have here that is unique to this life. And one of them of course is the bringing forth of children. We marry and are given in marriage. But he says in the resurrection we are as the angels. We're not angels but we're as the angels. And the prophet goes into details. Brother Brandham beyond the curtain of time. He said the women were indeed women and the men were indeed men. But he says there was no sex glands. It did not exist. It was an absolute uh uh uh absolute void of anything having to do with any feeling or sense of uh of a of a sexual thought or relationship when a man they embraced one another. And it's something that we can scarcely grasp. But in this world now if you go back to multiply and replenish the earth and to find that now a creature that God had created, he had indeed created the angels and those angels which Satan drew out from heaven by his deception and they were called fallen angels and uh and you you can be certain that those fallen angels are demon spirits. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing how those uh you can find some of the most demonpossessed of people and they will be religious. &gt;&gt; They demons know all about worship because they came from the presence of God. They're not afraid of church. &gt;&gt; They're not afraid of the Bible. &gt;&gt; They will quote it. But you will find that all along the way there is always a a a sexual connotation &gt;&gt; and they become obsessed that way. &gt;&gt; Isn't it incredible that this world that we live in is so hellbent &gt;&gt; with a perversion of the whole sexual experience. Just everything that you can even imagine or think about that Satan has managed to contaminate. &gt;&gt; He has made a mockery of marriage for example. He's made a mockery of even raising of children &gt;&gt; and huge huge uh uh concern today in all kinds of things whether it's abortion or a a woman's right for abortion or non-abortion all of these things. I mean people get caught up in the in these programs or they get caught up in these causes. I'm for it and I'm against it. I can tell you one thing. The word of God is so far even beyond that. This world is truly hellbent. &gt;&gt; And it all has to do with the original sin. It's all pinned back to the original sin. You can't escape it. If they ate apples, this whole thing is an absolute confusion. If if Eve just ate something off a tree and all of this happened out of that, it's just a total chaos. But I can tell you it is absolutely clear. Satan wanted to possess he wanted to possess uh uh he wanted to actually possess an individual but there is a certain capacity. Listen now because this is getting this is going to be very very important. There's a certain capacity a there's a certain status and a certain position that Satan wanted to have. He desired to have. He wanted to ascend. He wanted to do what God was intending to do. And God's intent was that God was going to possess human beings &gt;&gt; in a sense that Satan cannot possess them. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan can cause them people to do things and so on, but God can actually and does by the power of transformation takes a place in the human life. So he permeates the entire being, changes his nature, changes his desires and that he has he is he is held back from Satan. God desires to indwell man. And therefore Satan desires the same position. And the scripture tells us which is familiar scriptures. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning. How thou art cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. Now listen, the one he is speaking of, he says, I will ascend above. I will ascend above. Remember now that this God that could have said anything he could have said anything to Adam his son for the there's no time but we have a record of in the economy of eternity where God made one in his own image and now he has one in his own image and the first thing he says is be fruitful &gt;&gt; multiply and replenish the earth That has to be a very significant statement. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? That has to be a very powerful statement. That has to have priority in the mind of God. And you can be well assured. Satan knew that. &gt;&gt; Satan knew that that was priority in God's mind. And he desired to have a position. Why was God even saying multiply and replenish the earth? Why was God saying that? Because in this he set aside this time. He set aside history whereby he would bring forth a family &gt;&gt; to himself. &gt;&gt; And even though it fell, God's God's plan cannot be thwarted. God's plan cannot be voided out. God's still going to bring it. And he's going to bring it by redemption. Glory &gt;&gt; in the Ephesians church age. I want you I'm not going to carry on long, but I want you to I want you just to this is so clear. &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this, please. In the Ephesians church age, brother Brandham's saying this. Now, why did this have to be so? Why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way? Man was created for God. Man was to be the temple of God. The place of God's rest. The Holy Spirit was man, the temple. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit was going to indwell man. That's God's program. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we read Acts, he reads Acts 7:46-51. Who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle, for the God of Jacob, but Solomon built him an house. How be it, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Uh, as Seth prophet, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my foottool. What house will you build me, sayeth the Lord? or what is the place of my rest? My hand hath made all these things. Ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, ye to always resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did, so do ye. He said, "Satan has known this all along. He also wants to indwell man." I want this congregation and all listening on the internet to listen very closely. Satan has always known this. He's known this all along. He also wants to indwell man even as God does. But God has reserved to himself that right. &gt;&gt; This is the key. &gt;&gt; God has reserved to himself that right. &gt;&gt; But this is what he desired in Eden. and he's done the next best thing for himself. Satan cannot do that. I underlined it. I I highlighted it. I put it in red. I put it in yellow. And I rejoice over it. Satan cannot do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God alone appeared in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God alone appeared in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Do you mind if I get enthused about this? God alone appeared in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan could not and cannot do that. He does not have creative powers. The only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden as he entered by evil spirits into the swine of Geria. God does not enter animals, but Satan can and will accomplish his ends. &gt;&gt; He could not have a child directly by Eve as God did by Mary. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He could not have a child by Eve as God did by Mary. &gt;&gt; So he entered into the serpent and then beguiled Eve. He seduced her and by her Satan and by her did Satan have a child vicariously. &gt;&gt; He did not have a he it was not his child. He used the serpent to do so and he had one vicariously. Cain bore, listen closely, Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the anim animalistic, sensual, fleshly characteristic of the serpent &gt;&gt; cannot be denied. He bore the full spiritual the full spiritual characteristic of Satan and the full physical characteristic of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. No wonder the Holy Spirit said, The Holy Spirit said, &gt;&gt; "Don't lose it." &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit said Cain was of that wicked one. &gt;&gt; For he was. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit wrote this book. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit said it. &gt;&gt; Can you take it? &gt;&gt; Can you accept it? The Holy Spirit said it. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the author of this book. The Holy Spirit said in this book, Cain is of the serpent. &gt;&gt; To deny that is doubt &gt;&gt; and to doubt it is death. &gt;&gt; God will not bless doubt. Right. &gt;&gt; When man Now, here's a here's God's first commission. Can I take another few moments? &gt;&gt; Here's God's first commission. &gt;&gt; Be fruitful, &gt;&gt; multiply, and replenish. Then the scripture tells us just in chapter 6, "And when men multiplied, when men multiplied, sin covered the earth &gt;&gt; to such a degree and to such a depth that God says, I'll destroy it." &gt;&gt; Now, how could he be destroying the result of his commandment? So what what the product was not the product of his word &gt;&gt; when men multiplied in chapter 6 was not the fulfillment of what he said to Adam multiply &gt;&gt; and replenish the earth &gt;&gt; something got in there &gt;&gt; and it's none other than Satan through the instrumentality of the serpent and then God cursing the serpent so that his his physical features are gone forever. He's not upright anymore. &gt;&gt; He was upright. He's not upright anymore. &gt;&gt; When man be to multiply in the message time is at hand and waxed great in the earth building cities and many people began to be fully populated. Wickedness set in among the hearts of the people. And the time came when God had to send judgment. God set a time for that judgment. And then he also had a preacher of righteousness for the name by the name of Noah. And he preached 120 years and was turned down. Now just one more short reading and I'm going to close. Continuing in the Ephesian church age. And now that we've come this far, let me try to crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as I have. We start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden. The tree of life was Jesus and the other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of that tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't just have a tree growing out of the ground out of the botney life pot ash and in that tree is the power uh to corrupt the earth. &gt;&gt; Nonsense. &gt;&gt; Utter nonsense. &gt;&gt; Any child knows that you can't have a tree, a fig tree or some other tree or fruit tree corrupt the whole earth and bring all this death and bring all this trouble. One tree was Christ and he's found three times. He's found in Genesis and he's found in Revelation. He's found three times in the book of Revelation, I believe. Three times in the book of Genesis. But the tree of knowledge of good and evil does not appear in the book of Revelation. He's cast out. He's cast into the lake of fire. He's done away with. And God in the in the meantime has brought forth his family. A family of faith, a family who has believed on his and he came and satisfied his own judgment. In the day you do in the day you eat there of you shall surely die. And God brought forth his seed of the woman Mary. And he went to the cross and by death he slew him who had power of death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; The other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the tree. Now he said we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there. &gt;&gt; Both of these trees have a relationship to man or they would not have been placed there. They must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto God. This is all true so far, is it not? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the world or the earth, the purpose of God has to was to share his eternal life with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the be before the foundations of the earth, &gt;&gt; the purpose of God was to share his eternal life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Zoe life, &gt;&gt; God's life &gt;&gt; with man. You can see why Satan wanted to use every instrumentality that was available to him to to interject and try and destroy and and take man away from God's eternal purpose, which was to give him his own life. according as he hath chosen us in him. Ephesians 1, before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love and so on. I'm and and it goes on and reads also into Revelation 13:8. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, Satan, whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. But that life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of God manifested in the flesh. This was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose. Remember what we said a moment ago. Only God can actually manifest himself and indwell. And the scripture says, "And the word was with God. The word was God and the word became flesh." &gt;&gt; There's no place where Satan can take that process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has reserved certain aspects. He can go thus far and no further. &gt;&gt; Satan had to come through flesh also. Listen. But Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the fallen. &gt;&gt; Satan could not come through human flesh. But there was an animal, the serpent, so close to man. I might just drop in here, maybe you'll understand. And now I've read the quote a number of times where where medical science even now this clinic down just south of San Diego in in Mexico and where it's a it's a an accepted thing today that they can take the cells of a fetus of an animal and they use a fetus perhaps of a cow or or a lamb but they can take they can take a young cow which is a fetus still in the womb of its mother and They take that fetus and they take the cells of of the main major organs of that fetus. They take the cells of that those organs and and and they have taken now because those cells know no disease. They are pure cells and they take people that have diseases and inject if it's a if it's a liver cells or a thyroid cell or different kind of cells they take those cells and inject them into the human sister Nelson Guy pastor in Newfanland one of the pastors brother Nelson Guy who was here at brother Mike's funeral his wife many years ago was at death's door and medical science could do nothing for her and she was dying literally dying and we here were praying and and Mike and Marilyn then were on the island and they they were praying and and there were people who knew them well and we were praying for this for this woman pastor's wife she was being taken prematurely &gt;&gt; and uh and brother Nelson I was in touch with brother Lee Vale and brother Lee told him of this portion in the church age book where these cells were uh this this process was done and he heard that there was a doctor in in Mexico brother Nelson Guy told me himself personally that he called that doctor and the doctor told him these are the costs and this is what we'll do and this is the program and we do a certain amount of preparation with your wife and inject her with the with the cells for that part of her body that's diseased. And so Nelson Guy when he saw that in the church age book, he took his wife down there and they prepared her and and brother Brandham asked in the doctor who was a doctor from Germany and he had studied this in Germany and the the cell life. He was he he asked brother Nelson Guy when did William Brandon speak of this? When did this come out? He says well it was in the n early 1960s. He said that's just when this was perfected. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It was right at that same time that this was perfected and they administered the cell therapy to sister Nelson guy who lives today as a healthy woman. Now, let me just say this. In the church age book, Brother Brandham says the thyroid cell will go right when it's injected in the person will go right to the thyroid. &gt;&gt; Now, catch this. It's a it it is coming from an animal kingdom &gt;&gt; and it will go right to the thyroid, the bladder to the bladder, the stomach to the stomach, the liver to the liver. He said there is an intelligence. &gt;&gt; How does that cell know where to go? &gt;&gt; There's an intelligence &gt;&gt; in the whole creation of of the animal kingdom. And that's why science tells us we're animal as far as of being a mammal is concerned. And he says there is an affinity between those two. And that cell will go directly to that cell. There's an intelligence behind it what tells it where to go. I tell you my brother and my sister and we had a prophet messenger stand on the earth who was tapped into the very mind of God. &gt;&gt; The God that spoke the creative power and brought forth the entire uh entire kingdom of the animal kingdom and botney life and all of these things. I tell you there's no scientist like our God. &gt;&gt; And told him exactly. And here he puts it for you and I to read. Uh unbelievers will doubt it and don't believe it and that's fine. That's their part. But as for my part, I believed it. &gt;&gt; I do believe it. I believe it now. I believe it more now than I ever did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe in that intelligence. And I believe that intelligence &gt;&gt; which even guides a cell &gt;&gt; of a unborn fetus to go to the needy needy part of a human body and and and and not very long ago we had people that were down there and they're busy. They got the who's who of the world coming in there trying to get over their sicknesses and diseases and some are too far advanced to do anything. There has to be a certain time that this can happen. And I'm not promoting them whatsoever. I'm simply saying what God's prophet said was absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; And years later, it's proven to be the truth. &gt;&gt; And it shows that there's an affinity &gt;&gt; between the serpent, the animal kingdom, and mankind, &gt;&gt; and this body. You know as well as I do. You're humans. You know as well as I do. You know what you're susceptible to. And Satan would try to use everything that God has said and made pure. Look at the mockery he's made. Look at the whole world is is is just absolutely sexually mad. &gt;&gt; Every joke and all the programs and all the television and the newspapers are so full of it. I get sick. I don't get newspaper to my home. &gt;&gt; It's so vile, &gt;&gt; so sexually oriented. Why? Because that's where it started. Amen. &gt;&gt; And nobody can deny that. And I want to make another announcement. God has already announced an end. For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage. I say, "Thank God. All of that will be done away with. There was an animal, the serpent, so close to man that Satan could get to that beast. And through that beast, he could get to human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race. Even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race, into human bodies. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Even to the extent of the resurrection wherein we would have bodies like under his glorified body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This Satan cannot do. This the serpent could not do. But our Lord Jesus by the Holy Ghost has injected himself into a people today. Oh, I wouldn't be outside of that, friends, for anything. I wouldn't be outside of that for anything. And that has been my message in the last three services. It is this life that is pulsating in the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not getting done, but I just want to end right now. He says, "And then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation, he would restore man. He would restore fallen man and make him a partaker of that eternal life. Make him a partaker. He would come and become sinful flesh for us that we would be a partaker of Zoe life, not a human life. You came by human life. You may be British or German or Canadian or American or Russian or whatever more. By that we die. By the woman we die. But by this one who came we live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got Zoe life. &gt;&gt; If you have come to him and acknowledge him and believe his word, we have Zoe life. &gt;&gt; And that life pulsates in the believer. &gt;&gt; That life causes us to do things that are strange. That life causes us to do things you don't understand. It bypasses your mental mind. Your the capacity of your mind is not great enough to comprehend what God is doing. I said to you in the last service, I believe I just made reference. I was going to read it today. We don't have time. I I I spoke to you about the widow of Zerapath and uh and and she was out collecting her toothpicks and and it was so remarkable to me. But one thought I didn't bring and I it just come fresh to me again. She was out making preparations to die. But I want to I just want to describe this to you before I close. The scripture says that there had been the famine in Samaria was sore. &gt;&gt; It was sore. and see everywhere she looked, she could see death &gt;&gt; everywhere. God, who had allowed Elijah to declare this, had also told him, "Go up to the brook and be by the brook uh Cherith, believe it is." And uh you be by the brook, and the ravens, I've commanded them to feed you. The Bible says after a season even that brook dried up. &gt;&gt; I want to declare to you we are in a famine. A spiritual famine such as this world has never witnessed. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual famine. While a billion will chase after Islam and another hundreds of millions will chase after Hinduism and others after Buddhism. maybe a billion or more after Buddhism. And there's a handful of people that hear of Jesus Christ and of his sacrifice of Calvary. And there is no other name. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; There is no other sacrifice. &gt;&gt; We're in a famine. &gt;&gt; There has never been a day like this day with such a famine &gt;&gt; in the land. And if you have spiritual eyes, all you need to do when you leave this building, you go to a restaurant and you go down the street and wherever it is, you look around. And if you got spiritual eyes, all you see is is is famine. &gt;&gt; And you see death everywhere. &gt;&gt; And man in his wisdom, in all of his wisdom, has so polluted the earth &gt;&gt; that even the animals are crying. Even the animals are dying &gt;&gt; and the air is polluted and the ground is polluted &gt;&gt; and the very food that the people eat and the animals eat is polluted. It It's never been like Eden was &gt;&gt; there. Everything is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And they can try to doctor it up and make it as pretty as possible. They'll never be able to do so. It's a contaminated world &gt;&gt; by the perverter of all things. &gt;&gt; And you go and and walk around and go to the mall. I don't care where you go. Everywhere you go, &gt;&gt; it's death. &gt;&gt; Nothing but death. But Satan, this master of cunning, has got people to believe that they're living it. Oh, this is &gt;&gt; this is so great. So great. I told you about I stood behind a man. I was in a places are have gone places where I don't even recognize them anymore. I stood behind a man in a in a in a pharmacy here not too long ago and he said something to the I wasn't paying attention and the girl reached around and brought down a carton of cigarettes and he threw down a $100 bill. Thought wow man I don't know if she's even going to accept that you know threw down a hundred bill dollar bill. She rung it up and gave him about 30 bucks back. I thought I almost forgot what I was going to buy. $70 and he's going to put that in his mouth and inhale that cancer into his lungs &gt;&gt; and put the rest of up and smoke so he can pollute the air and pollute himself and think he's having a good time. &gt;&gt; Now, I tell you what, friends, &gt;&gt; and pay for it. Sometimes you have people in the world, you know, and they want to get at the believer. Oh yeah, you and this or you know, how do you pay for this church and you live in a nice home and everything else? Once in a while I just get, you know, I get a little nasty and I say, I paid for my home with all the booze you drink and all the cigarettes you smoke. &gt;&gt; That's how I paid for my home. &gt;&gt; And you'd have had one, too. I tell them, you'd have had one, too. You'd have had a place for your family if you hadn't set it all up in smoke. Some devil deceive a person. I say, "Thank God for deliverance from that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the resurrection, they'll not be so. So, and this woman from Zarapath and she was indeed surrounded by death everywhere. But she did not realize because she had not known yet that the very life that was in her was pulsating and leading her directly to life. Amen. &gt;&gt; She already had life in the midst of the famine but didn't know it. &gt;&gt; And some of you that are here, I want to announce to you, if I need to announce to you that in the midst of the famine, &gt;&gt; God has given you a provision. &gt;&gt; Far beyond far beyond anything of of the world that's around you. far beyond anything that would try to detract or take away from from the spiritual life that God has given. &gt;&gt; No one, no power can take this Zoey life from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Zoe life is God's life. &gt;&gt; God's children have Zoey life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Gracious and loving heavenly father, how your word moves us. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I I want to personally just give you thanksgiving, &gt;&gt; your ways are true, &gt;&gt; your word is true, &gt;&gt; and your program is being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And we shall by your grace, we shall finish the course that you've given for us. I pray for every person that's within the sound of my voice and those that are here in the sanctuary today. Lord, I pray you'll bless them. Some of them perhaps are facing a difficult time just now. Some of them have uh someone who's on their heart, someone that they're holding very dear to them. I pray that you will loose the feathers that bind the unbeliever, oh God, and bring them to a place of faith. Bring them to a place, oh God, where their where their faith will materialize for them. &gt;&gt; Father, we have some that are still out of the way. We have some that are still in the paths of death. We have some, oh God, who if they continue the direction they're going, we'll will find themselves sorely sorely wounded for the wages of sinners death. But the gift of God is eternal life. Oh God, this Zoey life that we have so cherished today, bless, I pray, your people. And perhaps today, even now, Lord, you'll bless someone. Perhaps they've come to church and been part of the congregation, but have not participated yet, have not received Zoey Life. I pray that they will do so by the new birth. We ask in the name of Jesus Christ, I commit this word to you now for your glory alone. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you for your time and your patience. We've been a little bit long this morning, but I'd like to have you turn if you would please. And we're going to sing, Faith of Our Fathers. It's number I think you have that faith of our fathers living still. Would you stand with me and sing this from your heart? [Music] &gt;&gt; Faith of our father living still in spite of dark and fire and sword. Oh, how our hearts be high with joy. Where we hear that glorious word faith [Music] holy face we will be true to thee till death our father changing prison [Music] still in heart and consious free. How sweet would be their children's face if they like them could die for me. In God's holy gra we will be true to thee till death [Music] on our father we will love both friend and f in all our strife and reach the as love goes out by kindly words and life f of the father holy face we will be true to the end oh faith of our father's holy name. We will be true to thee till [Applause] it's our testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you. Holy Spirit, you are welcome in this place. You're welcome in these temples. You're welcome to indwell these vessels. And we believe your word. Oh, almighty God, we believe your word. Satan cannot occupy the individual like that. People become demonpossessed and do all kinds of terrible things. and the world is full of it. But oh God, you have reserved the indwelling of man to yourself and by the Holy Spirit, you come and literally indwell down into the regions of the soul. We're not moved by some emotion, but we're being moved by the Holy Ghost. Even as men of ancient times spake as you said in your word as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. We carry the burden of the word of the Lord. We carry the burden of this message. We carry the burden of its fulfillment and manifestation. I say, oh God, declare yourself, manifest yourself and show if this word is true today, do that which is impossible &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I wonder who is here. seeking to believe for something that seems to be impossible. I want to hear a testimony from you. I want your heart to be raised in faith right now. I want you to raise your hand and make a declaration. I'm believing for that which my senses declares impossible, but my faith declares is possible. &gt;&gt; Lord, we have seen the impossible. We've seen, oh God, how you've worked in homes. We have your wives and husbands, oh God. We have the impossible that has taken place. I give you glory in the very face of Satan himself. I give you praise and glory. I know that the devil comes to church. He comes here to church. And I want to declare to him, God indwells this vessel. And God is declaring, Satan, you're defeated in all of this situation. Let the chain be loose now. Let the chains fall. Let prodal sons come to theirelves. Let prodical daughters awaken in the name of Jesus Christ. For we're here to do business for the eternal God. May someone start on their heavenly homeward way. May they cast off and deny the enemy now. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ be glorified. My brother, my sister, I feel I feel that we deserve we we owe it to the Lord who deserves our thanksgiving for the mighty things he's done in our lives. All hail of power of Jesus name. Oh, let angels prostrate fall. Bring forth a royal diadem and crown him Lord of all. My God, my God. My God, my God dwells. He dwells in his saints. [Music] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul. [Music] [Music] I want to hear the cry. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hear the cries of the shackle from the orange of time. Lift it up. of his feet there. Oh, see the tears of the broken the cry [Music] worthy. Oh Christ as the forest Glores [Music] the song [Music] worthy. Oh worthy. Worthy was worthy. [Music] Worthy. [Music] worthy [Applause] that was all the angels. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. worthy worthy lamb that was saved. &gt;&gt; Brother Tony, I'm going to ask you if you'll come forward, please. Nice to have brother Tony, Sister Rebecca back. Brother Tony will be ready on Wednesday night to tell us about the work especially in Usbekiststan. So we're anxious to hear about that and see whatever he's prepared for us. We love him, don't we? Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Precious friends, I announce to you the things that you are plagued with, the things that you're bombarded with, God has already signed an end to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] I think of you young people and what it is you're subjected to and all the vulgarity and the vile things of this world. I say to every man and woman and young person in this place, God has already assigned an end to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You'll be changed in your body in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. And you'll never, never again struggle with any of these things that Satan has perpetrated. And some of it is is illegal. &gt;&gt; As we heard the other night, it's illegal. He has no right to you. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ has already paid that penalty. And I can say today, you are free. &gt;&gt; I am free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that good news? You're free. &gt;&gt; Don't ever allow that enemy by default to try to hold you in subjection. &gt;&gt; You're not in subjection to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The redeemed of the Lord are free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tony, God bless you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word today. &gt;&gt; Lord, at the entrance of your word came life into our souls, Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Oh God, the power of Zoe life resident within us. Lord, that death sentence that was over our bodies, over our lives, was ended at the moment that we became the children of the resurrection. And Lord Jesus, there is a greater power. There is a greater life within us now. And Father, as we would go our separate ways today, oh Father, may you help us, Lord. May we recognize that we're not just born of flesh, but we're born of the will of God, born by the spirit of God to bring this body of death into subjection and under the power of your word. Father, we thank you for this glorious word. We're thankful that a man was able to get himself out of the way that brother Ed was able to enter into another channel of inspiration, Lord, and be a mouthpiece for you, the Holy Spirit, to have spoken today, Lord. Let that word dwell richly in our hearts. And as we go from here, we pray your blessing upon each and everyone and upon our mothers, Father, we remember them and celebrate that fifth gospel today, Father. Oh Lord Jesus, bless brother Ed. Bless each and every one of us. bring us back at the appointed time, Lord, with this fire, with this burning life, this Zoe life burning in our soul. And bless Brother John, Lord, as we come back to the household of faith to feast upon the word that you've spread before us this day, as we ask all these mercies in Jesus name. We thank you. Amen. Thank you, brother Tony. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Lord willing, we'll see you this evening, &gt;&gt; 5:00 rather late this afternoon. You're dismissed in Jesus' name. Greet one another and especially to every mother. Say happy Mother's Day. God bless you. [Music] Another [Music] one. [Music] [Music]
