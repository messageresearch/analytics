[1:09] that's what does it it's where he's
[1:11] planted he's planted by the rivers of
[1:15] water I notice David said his his roots
[1:18] won't die you know you take a tree a big
[1:22] old tree I when I was a boy I used to go
[1:27] out and which US boys we go out and had
[1:29] a big old tree we used to set on a big
[1:31] old beach tree and the winds would blow
[1:33] and I want look like that thing so much
[1:35] the top look like it Blow The the thing
[1:37] over but you know every time wind blows
[1:39] on a tree it rocks the tree and it
[1:42] loosens up the roots so that they can
[1:44] just dig deeper and get a better hold
[1:46] and that's the way mocky laughing making
[1:50] fun of a Christian what it does is
[1:52] persecution shakes the Christian to make
[1:55] him pray more dig down get a better
[1:58] hold we can stand the storms now a water
[2:02] if a man's planted in such a thing as by
[2:05] the river where the Springs nine
[2:08] different Springs feeding into
[2:11] him what a what an establishment he has
[2:15] and a man is planted by the river rivers
[2:19] of water one water one Spirit there are
[2:23] Gifts of healing Same Spirit Gifts of
[2:26] Prophecy Same Spirit All The Same Spirit
[2:29] but many give one Giver now David saw
[2:33] him and he was planted by this tree now
[2:35] he could not die now notice why he had
[2:39] Life in The Roots where is the roots of
[2:42] the life of the tree stays in the roots
[2:44] certainly comes up and bears his fruit
[2:46] all right watch his roots had life in
[2:50] them to bring forth his fruit in
[2:53] season now remember this tree will not
[2:56] cast its
[2:58] fruit amen now you take a tree and put
[3:00] it away from water the first thing you
[3:02] know you got little apples they're all
[3:05] nauy and worm eaten but it'll cast it
[3:08] it's it's crop that's what's the matter
[3:11] of the churches today you done got away
[3:14] from that River got away from them gifts
[3:16] of the Spirit they got this a church
[3:19] natural and they get away from the
[3:21] spiritual gifts and the spiritual things
[3:23] and they cast their fruit what do they
[3:25] do they're they're Believers live with
[3:28] the world act like the world S Steel

[3:41] it's just like the world and the
[3:42] unbeliever look say's no difference in
[3:43] that person than me that's what caused
[3:46] communism to rise in Russia that's the
[3:48] reason they burn up the Catholic church
[3:50] in down in Mexico when I was there seen
[3:52] those lion pits where those in those uh
[3:55] places where they burnt those little
[3:56] babies where these nuns had these babies
[3:58] even human bodies grown human body was
[4:00] laying in there and the lion fits what
[4:03] they do they cast their crop see and God
[4:07] shuck them off the tree that was all see
[4:09] but a man that's planted not stuck out
[4:13] but
[4:14] planted by the rivers of water he shall
[4:18] bring forth his fruit watch in his his
[4:23] fruit in his
[4:25] season are you reading it Psalms 1 bless
