Not like Martha's, Lord. We be Martha's all through the week, Lord, but this morning, Father, we just want to sit at your feet just to hear those wonderful words of life. Words that will transform us, Father, that will change our appetite, that will cause a greater hunger and a greater thirst, Lord Jesus, to have that intimate relationship with you, Lord. Father, the world knows nothing of it. strange to the world, but to us, dear God, it's something we long for, something we so hunger for, Father. Just more of you, that you'd reveal yourself to your people this morning. Lord, as we've come expecting, Lord Jesus, to meet with you this morning, not a God of wood or stone, but a living God, a God that lives within his people. We've come this morning, Father, packing the Holy Spirit, packing that lick of fire, dear God. Lord, that we just combine our faith this morning to pull upon the gift, Lord. That word that you have for us this morning, a word in due season, Lord, that will answer every need, that will answer every request, Father, that will meet, Lord Jesus, each person, Lord Jesus, where they're at, right down to their address, Lord. Father, we remember these prayer requests, Lord God. We pray that you go to each one, Lord. Make yourself known to them, Lord. Make yourself known as the mighty God unveiled before them, Lord. That you would raise, Lord God, those who are sick, those that are afflicted, Lord. Father, those that are combating the flu and the colds and other ailments, Lord. Father, we just so thankful, Lord, that we can turn to you, Lord. Man doesn't know, Lord God, what they're doing anymore, Lord. Things are too complicated, Father. But we're so thankful that we can turn to you, the author and the finisher of our faith, Lord. So increase our faith this morning, Lord. For faith cometh by hearing, hearing your word, Father, not the words of a man. We pray that you'll take our pastor, Father. Move him out of the way, Lord, and allow the Holy Spirit to minister unto us. So may we just sit on the edge of our seats, Lord. Father, may we just be under great anticipation, Father, for what you're going to speak to us this morning. [music] Lord God, would you just bless our brother Ryan, Father, just Lord, lead us, Lord, to create an atmosphere, Father. We're creators this morning, Lord. May we just create that atmosphere, Father, where you just couldn't help but come down, Father, into our midst, Lord Jesus, to dwell with your children this morning, speaking to our hearts, oh God, individually, Father, so so intimately, Lord, we so love you. We just pray you bless the musicians, bless all that's done or said this day. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. So humbling every time he comes. We're so thankful. [music] He promised he would never leave us nor forsake us. I mean, heavenly father, I appreciate you. And just as the Sunday school children are finding their way and why don't we just continue to worship, oh heavenly father, I [singing] appreciate you. [music] Oh [singing] my heavenly father, [music] I appreciate you. [music] Lord, I [singing] love you. I adore you. I bow [music and singing] down before you. Heavenly Father, [singing] I appreciate.

[music] Oh every [music] heart [singing] I receive. [music] Lord, I love you, adore you, and I bow down [singing] before [music] you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. [music] Amen. I'm just going to ask the brothers if they get ready for the morning offering this morning. And while we sing standing on the promises, the song on my heart this morning as I would just come and prepare for the morning offering, we want to greet each and every one of you also this morning. Say God bless you. We're happy to have each and every one of you here. Those [music] joining us by way of the internet and the phone hookups. We're just glad that you could be a part of the service this morning. Aren't you thankful we can stand on the promises? Amen. Whatever come. Hallelujah. [music] Amen. Maybe just before we sing this, Brother Emanuel, would you come just ask a blessing over the offering? [music] Let's bow our heads. Thank you once again, Lord Jesus, for bringing this this place. Oh God, as we come, Lord Jesus, to worship you, singing songs of praises [music] to you, Lord Jesus. Now God, we want to worship you also with the money that you give to us.

We uh &gt;&gt; you may be feel felt like you were tempted to stay in bed this morning and sleep in. We're standing toe to toe to toe-to-toe with the devil this morning and bringing the flesh into subjection, showing the devil whose side we're on.

The river of temptation is flowing deep and wide, reaching [music] out to pull you in. Old Satan's out to get you. And he won't be [music] satisfied till you're over your head in sin. [music] You've got to stand toe to toe with the devil. [music] You can't walk hand in hand with disgrace. [music] You got to fight him every day.

How are we going to do that? By the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, last week we gave you a little bit of a report from China and Brother Biscllow got on it right away and he said, "You know, you said they did the book so well in China. Why didn't you have any books?" I said, "That's right." So, we got on, we got on. I had Sarah get a hold of Brother Ivan and uh we just wanted to show you the quality of the This is just part one of the church age book. And I showed you the brother that did the uh publishing of it. And that is an amazing amazing uh book, of course. But then we've got all these other ones. Brother Ivan does a design. And these are ones you would love to have, but you don't understand a word it says. I thought I'd just get a whole collection of them, just have them in my bookshelf. And say I Those are just just tremendous. Brother Ivan has has got a special machine that he laminates the the cover so the cover will not actually break apart. And I said, "You know what, Brother Ivan? I want one of those." I said, "I've got I've got books that are 30 years old, 35 years old that are falling apart and I could laminate every one of them and they would be my own special books." So, if you want to do that, you let me know and I'm going to order one of those machines. But if you just see these books that they have printed and they do this by this is all volunteer labor &gt;&gt; 12 little some of them are are just 12 year olds all the way up to sisters and brothers and they've done a collection of all these books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy will be home. [applause] God bless brother Ivan. They do that off the hub. Brother Murphy will be home, Lord willing, March 27th. So keep brother Murphy in your prayers and brother Ivan, God bless you. Apparently that was a COOD book, not a church age book. But you know, I don't know if any of us would be able to tell the difference. Amen. When I was saying, "Can't you see why I'm happy as we turn the service to our pastor?" Oh, can't [music] you see [singing] why I'm so happy? Oh, for [singing] I've [music] accepted the word of the Lord. Oh, it's the revealed [music] [singing] word that was spoken [music] by the prophet. Very thankful for that message. Sing it once more. [music] Can't you see why I'm happy to see why I'm [music] happy? Oh, for I accepted [singing] the word of the Lord. [music] It's the redee word that was sold. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'll try that again. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Enjoyed that service. Uh, brother Kyle Wednesday. We're trying to get ourselves all arranged here. Hooked up that battle. Are we coming through? Hello. My fault. Uh, yeah. I think when I when I saw those books, I I uh I think we're in a third world country. you you don't have to tell them how to do anything. They just take it and run with it. And it's so wonderful. So wonderful because they're they're doing it out of uh the not just inspiration but the joy. When you get something good, you want to share it with somebody. And that is so wonderful. Uh we are young people and uh others are still in Africa. And I thought I would just like to show you some of the a few of the pictures that are there. And I have also an email from Brother Tim D I got just this morning. Maybe we could turn the lights down just a wee bit. That'll be fine. Thank you. Uh oops. This is uh at the airport apparently where they had 64 64 bags of luggage and I think they're coming back with about 16. So they have left a lot of stuff over there and uh then uh they the the the fellas there they asked the brothers they said well in order to do this ceiling and work on this building we'll need ladders. Where's the ladders? said, "We don't have any ladders. You have to make them." So, so here they are making their ladders before they can go to work. Uh I think Eli Ellie is saying, "What am I doing up here?" And uh there's uh some of the sisters even getting involved. There's Eli and Leona's daughter. Um they said they heard that one of the brothers had started a school. So they went to the school and there were 600 students, 79 per class. I'm just going to let brother let brother Terry and all the all the teachers know that there they have 79 79 students per teacher. have the same number of teachers we have in BCA. Uh but the group sang for them. Uh our young people sang for them and brother uh brother Tim Dodd spoke to them and I said it was really wonderful. This was just something added added in addition. They hadn't expected that. uh learning to cook Ugandan style and uh they seem to be very happy. I got word from some of the brothers and they said, "Hey, we're we're learning things. We're going to bring back some good ideas." They said, "Uh, it's 30° in the daytime and about 20 at night. So, sleeping's a little bit difficult, but they said the beautiful thing is just we step out of our bedroom door in the morning, just a few feet away is a table just piled with the fresh fruit. He said we could get along with this and uh there it's a beautiful spot really. this sister here lost a baby and uh and she's not able to have children now and they asked us to really pray. Her her husband is not a believer and he's determined that he needs to have children. So, you know, it's it's brought quite a problem, but she's a very very wonderful believer and unmoved. Here's Sister Hedi Dingwall teaching the uh sisters and see that sewing machine. I think they brought five of them. They said that those are the finest sewing machines in Uganda in the country. So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just say praise the Lord. And they they were sewing up skirts for the sisters. Brother Tim preaching in a a church. There's there's uh just an incredible amount of ministry and this I believe is probably the building. Uh there's about 200 people there and that's in a village. I have a picture of the building a little later on. And this is a training session. They said the pastors are coming from all over and they are just so happy, so thankful that you know that we're interested and concerned enough to teach them how to handle the hub and how to maintain the equipment and how to print the books and they were printing them for the people in their language. And then more than that, they've gone to audio. And right now they're seeking that, brother Kim is seeking to put the uh messages which are in audio in their tribal language on the radio and uh and we're seeking to we may underwrite he's looking for it and underwrite it for a year and then the churches would gradually take over the cost. It was about $600 a month for the radio. That's the church. They had about 150 to 200 people in uh where all the group were down there. All right. I think that's that's it for the picture. Thank you. Uh, brother brother Tim just said if I could share this with you. We are just on our way to Sunday services about a 2-hour drive. We will be with brother Charles Odipio today. Another one of the elders in the country. I've heard his name and I probably met him as well. I think he was close to brother Harold Hilderbrand. He said perhaps you know him. He was brother Ibali's pastor. Brother Steven Ibali and his wife were here and he has uh one of the main works there. The young people are holding up well. They have labored hard this week and much was accomplished in translation, audio translation, uploading the hub, instruction on print stations and construction work. The widows have been trained on the use of sewing machines for use as micro business. They will be uh today will be our 11th and 12th services with the with the group being present in most of them. A lot of travel has been absorbed uh with with most uh with most to come. Uh with everything falling into place the first week, my burden is growing to find a means to reach the illiterate with the message. One advantage of gaining information in the second week is the wedding. The hand of God is clearly seen in this way because ministers are gathering from all over Africa for the wedding and it will be an opportunity to discuss uh this need with brothers from many countries. Just last night I sat with a brother from Zimbabwe. Please pray for us in this region. And so they said they that was the news that we are able to give you as of this morning. Wonderful to be a part of it, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I just I I I sent word back to them late last night and I said, "Well, there has to be somebody," and this is a message I have coming up in the future. There has to be somebody stay home with this stuff. Did you know the Bible talks about the stuff? Yeah. Yeah. The Bible talks about the stuff. So, I thought I'd look and find out what the stuff is. And there's got to be somebody here pounding out swords for the guys on the front lines to have otherwise they don't have the swords. There has to be somebody working in the blacksmith shops and somebody making the uniforms and somebody doing something. So, we got to stay with the stuff. &gt;&gt; But that's how come they're out there. So, I say praise God. Let's give a hand to all the people that stay home with this stuff. [applause] God bless you. [applause] God bless the people. Amen. God bless them. But God bless the people that stay home with this stuff. Hallelujah. There won't be they wouldn't do very good in the front lines if there wasn't people home doing some hard work. Hallelujah. Well, if you want to stand, we're going to read some scripture. And I'm going to read from the same chapter we read last week, but I'm going to read less of it out of Colossians, the first chapter. And just before we read, I'll be starting starting [clears throat] at the 24th verse. And just before we read, let's speak to the author. Oh righteous heavenly father, I always feel such a sense of thanksgiving when I can say the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. This is how you introduced yourself &gt;&gt; to Moses and you told him, "You're not the God of the dead. We heard from our Lord Jesus. You're the God of the living." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And Father, we're here in our journey of life. &gt;&gt; We're here facing life's trials. We're here facing life's battles. But we know that you are great in battle. &gt;&gt; And greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world. Lord, I pray tonight this morning that you will inspire us. Especially may the Holy Spirit give us a an open mind and understanding. And we pray you'll blow all the human cobwebs away. We pray you'll blow all the old religious and denominational teachings and thoughts. And may we receive the pure word of God, the vindicated word of God, the engrafted word of God, the word of God that has the power of transformation in it. Bless us today, Lord, as we are associated together. And we just want you to know that we love you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus. I want to sing that chorus. Uh what's the title of it? Yeah. [music] &gt;&gt; Help us out, brother. [music] for letting [singing] me hear your word. [music] What have I done to return? Such glory [music and singing] revealed indeed. Thanks for that [singing] special night. [music] When I saw your glorious light, [singing] came face to face with eternal [music] life. Lord, I thank &gt;&gt; once again in thanksgiving. Now, [music] I just want to thank you, Lord, for [singing] letting me hear your word. [music] But have I done the glory [music] for that special night when [music] I saw [singing] your glorious smile face to face with [singing] eternal life. Lord I [music] thank you. Now we'll read in Colossians the first chapter starting at verse 24. Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church. whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. Even the mystery which hath been hid from the from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Let me just stop there for a moment. You see, this was this was a spectacular and uh doctrine that was almost a phenomena because the Jewish people did not believe that the Gentiles were part of it. And so the apostle Paul is introducing to them. This is a great mystery that Christ wasn't only in the Jews, but he's in you &gt;&gt; and Christ in you, the hope of glory. say, "The mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, which we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ in in Christ Jesus, where unto all I also labor, striving according to his working, which workketh in me mightily." You may be seated and please keep your Bibles open and ready because I have a number of places that we would like to refer to. Now this morning I do not want to preach as such but I want to really take my time. Uh this is the third part of this message the interpretation of God's word in your life. So this will be part three. I have been pondering for a very very long time. And I when I say long time, I'm talking about many years. Many years, decades. We've pondered because we've heard so much about the coming of the Lord and uh the how and the when and being ready for it. And back in, you know, we've we've all been touched or tainted somehow with denominational teaching. And brother Brandham speaks about they expected the Jews expect them to come down and maybe from the heavens in a a rolled out carpet and they would come right to Caiaphas, the high priest, and all these things. And uh the Gentiles have believed, well, it's going to be in a cloud somehow. And we try to envision it. and and and others have multitudes have the dirt and earth of the graves flying out of the graves and piles of dirt everywhere and trains crashing and cars and airplanes crashing with pilots are suddenly gone and uh operators are suddenly gone and it's it's it's so difficult and we wrestled they may sound a little bizarre but we wrestled with those things and how is this going to happen and how are we going to be changed and and so all of these things have been and somehow I always have felt that that scenario is not biblical. It's not really scriptural and we we search and try to find out and and then when we read the Old Testament, it seems that uh you know the things of God and the life it they just kind of lived it out and they were all you know somehow in the in the plan of God and they were did very ordinary things and lived a very ordinary life. And so we have been inclined to say oh well that was back there when everything was uh you know just uh in a natural way but now it's everything's spiritual. So we tried to spiritualize everything and almost spiritualize it to the point that this life well this is kind of a bad natural life and we kind of hate this life and we just don't you know we're just wanting that spiritual life and until I have said to uh in earlier times to uh some of our young men who are so eager and just can't wait till this life is over and get out of this mess and get out of this thing and I said, you know, hey, you know, God put us here. &gt;&gt; God put us here for a witness. God put us here for a testimony. We're living it out. This is, you know, this is God's doing. And so, the rapture is not an escape. &gt;&gt; That's not it. It's just a an unfolding event. The rapture and the resurrection is just going to be an another unfolding event. So you may remember last year a few months ago I spoke on uh the events of the redemption and that the scripture is is essentially a series of events all playing out redemption. And then that evolved in my mind as I spoke it and and and pondered it prayerfully and waiting on God. not for days but over these months and over a long time and perhaps even years I've pondered it and and we've seen also when you know things have have come in and come into the message and people have seen that you know he's come oh okay and now oh well he's here and well my response to that well wasn't he always here well but he's here in a different way now and so we we try to assimilate that okay is here and what is what is changing and what is happening and then we find that people go off and go to seed on not that the doctrine is wrong but that the thing is they eroded in the New Testament saying the resurrection was already passed well the truth of the matter is part of the resurrection was passed but but they were expecting a resurrection I suppose and and I don't know when the scripture says they aired what they did was they just went to seed on it took it too far. And not that there wasn't truth in it. People within the within the message, there's been very much said about the thunders, the seven thunders and and what it meant. And then some go way off base and go to seed on it and and that's all there is. They take a few choice phrases out of the message and and that becomes their main pillar doctrine. And then while the other people says, "Oh, because they went to seed on it or they took it too far and I can't see that and can't believe that." So then they pull back. That's exactly what the devil wants. &gt;&gt; He wants somebody to go too far so the rest will pull back and and and he wins on both sides. So there isn't anything that the messenger has said that we should be afraid of. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we need to really determine and discover what it is he said. And you can't just do that by saying, "Well, I read a book today." That's not it. &gt;&gt; That just isn't it. It is what was the what was the thought of God? What was God trying to say to us? &gt;&gt; And I think you can only do it by being prayerful and digesting and take it. And we don't want to be lazy in our minds in in this day. We don't want to be leo to sin in our thoughts. We just want to say we want to say this and and and now I I'm reaching way way back to bring some things forward that have uh haven't bothered me for years but have have u had a big effect on me. Now, when I f first came into the message and began to realize, you know, and was actually spending some time with brother Brandham, I I I knew that that was a forerunner. And so, you naturally go back in your mind, as I did, I went back to the first forerunner, John the Baptist, before his first coming. And there has to be similarities between the two. &gt;&gt; There has to be similarities. And that's the spirit of Elijah. This is the spirit of Elijah. He's a rugged man. There's a rugged man. He likes the wilderness. He likes the wilderness. He didn't have a great education. He didn't have a great education. So there's similarities. And the forerunner can't be very far ahead of him who is forerunning. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he's not a forerunner. And then you come up with uh uh statements that brother Brandham says, you know, uh that he would introduce the bride to Jesus Christ. Well, that can't be something in millenniums up in the future. It has to be something when and then he have statements uh that he he he really labored on to separate the the angel of Revelation 10:1, for example. Now, we don't want to weary about talking about 10:1. That's Christ. We never want to weary. He said that was Christ. And he said, "That's a heavenly messenger." And in Malachi 4, now this is a earthly messenger. 10:7 is an earthly messenger, but this messenger is on the earth. The earthly messenger is on the earth when the heavenly messenger comes. So now you have to put that into a context into a spiritual context and then we have he's descending and we've spoken a lot about that. So my my concept today and I'll just drive I'll just give you the punchline right up front and we have an awful lot to say about it and that is that the prophet said Christ was in Moses, Christ was in Abraham. Christ was in Joseph and we'll read some of those. Christ was in and then I found places where he said that he was he was coming he didn't say he was coming down but he was coming forward it was and then in Christ as the mystery of God un revealed he said it's unfolded itself down to this time and the scripture which I will read a little later on when God was instructing Moses about the children of Israel going into their inheritance. Now, God had already declared what he was going to give them. He's already told us what he's going to give us. We don't want to sit here feeling that th this is the end all here or this life here. No, what we're here for is for eternal life. &gt;&gt; We all want to confess, I have believed on Jesus Christ and I have eternal life. &gt;&gt; We all want to believe that if we pass away, we are going to be resurrected. And those that have passed away and died in Christ shall rise again. &gt;&gt; And we that are alive and remain, we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of a Sunday morning service and all the services. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of the messenger coming is to let us know we have arrived to this time. &gt;&gt; That to me is the what the message is about. And so all all the people of the Old Testament and I'll give you a quote on that brother Brandon first of all all the acts of the believers in the Old Testament they were they were uh unfolding this great mystery and don't and when I say great mystery don't let your mind fog up when I say great mystery the secret mystery you think the coming of the Lord and I want to change your concept perhaps for some at least as I've been changing my mind Christ was coming all down through the Old Testament &gt;&gt; he was coming all the time &gt;&gt; coming coming and when and when he was born by the Virgin Mary and now was in a body and became a young man 30 years old that was simply And I don't want to say simply, but that was simply the culminating act of all of the Old Testament part of redemption. &gt;&gt; That was just the culmination of it. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "I have to leave. If I don't leave, the spirit won't come." So he leaves. The spirit comes. And now the church is born. &gt;&gt; And now we have part two. &gt;&gt; And he's and and all the acts of the disciples. And they were looking for him. They believed he would come then, but they were playing out a part of the second act or shall I say the second uh series of events of redemption. &gt;&gt; And that is why in the end time, Apostle John, he gives the book of revelation and now he sees one uh on the throne that is holding the book of redemption. And the whole Bible is simply an account of that redemption and who's acting it out and who's a part of it and who's going to be there. &gt;&gt; That's all they're acting out. And this one is holding the book of redemption. And one stands, a lamb stands and takes the book of redemption that is sealed with seven seals. And only the lamb can do it because it was the lamb that shed the blood and paid the price. So he takes the book of redemption and and and in the uh that it says the lion of the tribe of Judah which is one office and the lamb is the lion is a kingly office and the lamb and both are appearing in the same scene because there's a ministry right at that time that that turns the whole gives the last uh part of redemption to the gentiles and through Ruth who was a gentile who was pregnantated by uh Solomon I believe it was and and brought forth a child which was the kingly lineage. So it went from red it went from the kinsman redeemer to the king. So now I don't want to get into that but there is a ministry at that time when uh when redemption is coming for the gentiles is coming to a closure. &gt;&gt; There has to be closure. And the book of redemption, each each part of the each part of the book of redemption was lived out by the elect of that age. &gt;&gt; Now get this. And in their ordinary life that is called out that they were called to live, they are actually living out their own part of redemption. because you're living out what was written in the book. &gt;&gt; But it's in the end time only that it's made known what the whole scope of the picture is. And thus you have a message, especially a spectacular message. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; And the mystery is that not that Christ was mysterious, but it was Christ that was coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming in the Old Testament and coming in the New Testament and the resurrection and the change of these bodies will simply be the culmination of redemption in the New Testament as his physical coming through a virgin birth was in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; That's the concept. &gt;&gt; Just to just so you know that I didn't go wacko. Uh we'll we'll continue on. Paul said in the Ephesians that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you might Why would they be enlightened? That you might know what is the hope of his calling. What is the hope of this calling? Why did you have to open my eyes Lord? Why did you why did you give me a heart to believe? Why did I hear this message? And and and what is the hope of his calling? And what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints? Right. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just step back a moment, and you'll forgive me if this is a little chopped up, but uh and you'll have some questions after this, and it'll be good if you just jot them down. But when God was instructing Moses about the people going into their inheritance, now please realize that your inheritance is also God's inheritance. the land that the uh the the promised land that was God's land. &gt;&gt; But it became the people's inheritance. &gt;&gt; He gave it to them. &gt;&gt; All right? Uh and so he gave instruction to them and he said to Moses this. Now don't worry because you'll have to keep your minds alert. I'm trying to crowd in months of uh uh you know so I'm gonna insist on you be alert. &gt;&gt; So he says when you go into the land you'll not you'll not inherit the land you'll not possess it suddenly. &gt;&gt; You'll just possess it little by little. Now we sitting here are of all different ages from young children to the older ones. And we actually possessed our life little by little. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child, thought as a child. When I became a man, I put away childish things. Not that the childish things were evil or bad or wrong. You have to be a child. You have to be carefree. You have to be foolish. Foolishness is is just in the heart of a child. We do crazy things. You know, when I was on the boarded out on one of the farms. Uh I had an old bicycle and uh the boys had a horse. And I may have told you this and but it'll just help you. I mean, I think sometimes it's not a guardian angel, but it's a whole herd of angels that have to come and protect you. And I didn't I had trouble pedaling and that they're riding this nice horse and sometime I'd ride the horse. But we we got an idea, you know, you're always you always got that idea that this this labor of pedaling is too much for me. It's almost a cane syndrome. And uh so I said, "Well, let's take the lariat rope and we'll put it around the st around the handlebars." And so there's a knot on the end of this lariat rope and I'll just hold it on my thumb and you'll pull me. Great idea. You know, this was horsepower, the first initial horsepower. And so, but when we when they pulled and would jerk and would run or trot or gallop, they'd want to pull the handlebar off. So I said, "Now what we need to do is put it around the center post of the bicycle so it'll get pulled straight and then we'll just bring it up over the handlebar a couple twist and I'll still hold the knot." And you know what? It just worked beautiful. Well, it worked beautiful till one day we were going down just a little hill and there's a bridge and the bridges on these little farm roads. Uh they they never make them even. It's a big bump coming on and a big bump going off. And so when we went on to that bridge, he decided to, you know, foolishness is built built in the heart of a child. And he and this was a cutting horse. If you know what a cutting horse is, one that just Well, all you had to do with this horse is touch it behind the front flanks like that. Just had to touch it with your toes and it was gone. I mean, yesterday, even today, was history. That thing would go so fast. and her and so he just touched her and said and she was gone and I was on the bicycle and man what a jerk and what a what a revelation that was. It just went down this little dip just just so I mean the air just blowing in your hair and and when I hit that bridge I was somewhat airborne and it took me a time to get my self straightened around but I I managed it and I hit that bridge you know and by the time I just hit that bridge we were going off the other end. Well, I woke up in a farmer's pasture and my bicycle over there. I don't even know how I got across the barbwire fence. I got over there and and people who hear this story, this says, "What did you do then?" I said, "Well, we we got up, you know, I I didn't even have the wind knocked out of me." So, I got up and put the lariat on the bike away and carried on. Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child. We do silly things but somehow God manages. And yet in life in life the prophet says and you'll have here's where you have to get the words and I'm going to come to it later on. He says all the acts of the believers of the Old Testament that are in the Bible. Not all the acts of the believers. We do silly things. We do wrong things. We fly off the handle. We uh you know do things we're ashamed of. All the acts of the believers are not expressing Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we all here have expressed the flesh &gt;&gt; many times. But all the acts of the believers in the Old Testament that are in the Bible &gt;&gt; all spoke of Christ. because he is the Bible. &gt;&gt; And all the acts of the gentile believers, all the acts of the elect &gt;&gt; that they have lived out that are in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, am I in the scriptures?" You better believe it. A prophet came and told you there's a part of the scriptures that's allotted to you. &gt;&gt; It's already been given to you, and no one else can live it out. You're going to live it out. And that part is Christ's coming. How else is it going to happen? Amen. Amen. The first part of of Colossians that we started to read, it starts out and this is the first verse of who of Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And that first verse simply says uh 12 and 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature. That's what this is all about. The God restoring the original image of his own son which he had on earth. The first Adam fell. The second Adam did not fall. &gt;&gt; And we sit in bodies here today. Every human sitting in bodies that are human brought about by a sexual birth. And thus we are connected to the first Adam. &gt;&gt; But every son and daughter of God that is a believer has been born again. &gt;&gt; And by the first one we die. By the second one we live. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said by the woman we die. &gt;&gt; We came into this life through a mother &gt;&gt; and by that we have a death. Not because of the mother but because of the original sin in the Eden and the whole plan of God was perverted. But by the man we have life &gt;&gt; and we are have our second birth through Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ is the whole complete word &gt;&gt; but he sends a part for every one of his children in their generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prize and the goal and the secret and the mystery that we're speaking about that that is God's great secret. And in uh in Romans the scripture says, "And not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to whit the redemption of our body." That's what's it all about, folks. Maybe when you know you're 8 n 10 years old or in your teens and feeling all your vigor a young man young women couple you're married couples and you're looking to your immediate future but let me tell you something friends and I trust that you will accept what I am saying now I in my short lifetime have seen incredible indescribable changes in this world not just events But deterioration, &gt;&gt; deterioration until one of the phrases that I and my wife say every once in a while in a car, it's gone beyond recovery. &gt;&gt; And a prophet said that many, many years ago, it's beyond recovery. &gt;&gt; And he said something as far as America's concerned. And that gives a con that gives an example for the rest of the world. If you were you if you had a Abraham Lincoln in a Washington Abraham Lincoln I believe in Washington said in every county. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; You won't turn it around. &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's saying it's on a decline that cannot be recovered. &gt;&gt; In fact, this Billy Graham said very very similar things. He said he really believed that America was at the crossroads and had gone beyond recovery. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So the coming of Christ, I'm not being repetitious. I feel I need to say it a different ways. The coming of Christ is redemption in process. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Old Testament, it was. In the New Testament, it is. It is redemption in process. It's redemption in progress. For you that go on the internet and you might go to a certain page and they'll say under construction. It's just not ready yet, but they're working on it. And you come back to that site later on and you might find it there, but it's under construction. Brother Brandham says, "God's a great contractor. &gt;&gt; He lays out all of his material and you're a part of it. &gt;&gt; And he's moving towards the ultimate kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The physical arrival of Jesus Christ on earth was the culmination of all of the events of redemption throughout the Old Testament. Christ was coming through the Old Testament saints. And now the prophet here in the message in the Hebrew series says, "When Abraham took took after the enemy that he had that had took his brother, that was Lot, his nephew, and he pursued him all the way across the nation to Dan, and brought back everything that he lost in the fall. He's referring now. He just goes to the old to Genesis language. He he recovered and brought back everything that he lost in the fall. He said, "What a beautiful picture of Christ who heard from heaven that we were lost and came and pursued the enemy all the way to hell and captured the lost souls and brought us back and restored to us everything that we had lost in the fall." &gt;&gt; I was speaking about Joseph. Now I'm speaking about Abraham. Abraham wasn't going out after these and saying, "I'm a perfect type of Christ. I'm going all the way to hell if I need to go. I'm going to get Lot back and I'm going to bring back all the stuff." He didn't know he was living it out. &gt;&gt; He's living out an important part of the coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Just in his daily battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That he wasn't going clicking his heels. This was probably one of his lower points. All these kings had come invaded and came against Sodom and Gomorrah. But they made a mistake and they took Lot. Now they tampered with something that concerned Abraham. Abraham was a chosen son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A man of the faith. And there was just something in him. I'm going to bring him back. I'll gather the men out of my own own own uh farm and I'll go men trained and I'll go after him. And that spirit was the spirit of Christ &gt;&gt; in him &gt;&gt; driving him &gt;&gt; to do something he perhaps normally wouldn't have done &gt;&gt; and he may not even understand why am I doing this? Lot who went down there could have said it's good for him. He's getting his medicine. &gt;&gt; That was his choice. No, he has to live out this thing surging through him is not Abraham. It's Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in his coming. &gt;&gt; Because that's what Jesus Christ is going to do. He's going to go all the way to hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And take the keys of death, hell, and the grave &gt;&gt; off of the enemy &gt;&gt; and be able to come up and announce because I live, &gt;&gt; you live also. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said this, we backsliders, we that was born to be sons of God, that's perverted into the sons of the devil and made and went after the things of the world and did wrong and ran greedily like Lot did, selling out our birthrights and going after the things of the world. Christ came down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ came down. These are his words. &gt;&gt; Though fallen, God knowing in the beginning who would be saved &gt;&gt; and who would not. &gt;&gt; Therefore came down. Why? Because some were to be saved. &gt;&gt; And he came down and pursued the enemy through life, through death, through paradise into hell. and all the way from glory to hell and took over the powers of hell and the keys away from the devil and rose again restored to mankind that he can be sons and daughters of God again. &gt;&gt; And he said, "See, &gt;&gt; listen to this now. &gt;&gt; I have it highlighted. See the spirit in Abraham there, the spirit of Christ coming with him." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you don't know how that thrills me. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Christ coming in. &gt;&gt; I just want you to get the principle. It was the spirit of Christ. Christ coming in. &gt;&gt; What spirit is in you? &gt;&gt; Not all of our acts are written in the Bible, but there are some things that we are doing that's written in the word of God. And we're doing it because we're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; See, so you might just say as a matter of life, I just spoke to a person. I had an opportunity to witness and I was talking to them and they were really really uh uh they were really quite hungry and so on so forth. Oh, was that something you got from your mother and father? Did that come down from your greatgrandfather? I'll say no. Not a chance. as the spirit of Christ &gt;&gt; in you &gt;&gt; living out &gt;&gt; a part of this coming &gt;&gt; because part of my coming is I've got to reach this person. &gt;&gt; A part of this coming is I've got to bring them in &gt;&gt; because they're part of the elected and this one that's even speaking isn't sure but I'm using them &gt;&gt; part of his coming. We're acting it out. &gt;&gt; And somebody's going to talk to the last elected one, &gt;&gt; the last one. Somebody's going to talk to them. And it's going to play out a part of the culmination of the coming. Because when the last one's in, we go home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it all right if I preach once in a while? The spirit of God from the beginning finally works down in the message the mark of the beast. He said and as the spirit of God as the spirit of God from the beginning finally finally works down and I'll say little by little &gt;&gt; down through Moses. Do you believe Christ was in Moses? Certainly was Christ in Joseph. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on, he's put in a ditch. And we spoke quite a bit about Joseph and how he was acting out Christ. None of these people, the closest thing we have to anybody even believing it. Moses said, "A prophet shall the Lord God, Lord your God, raise up like unto me." &gt;&gt; And that's the closest that that's the only statement you ever have. But now in the end time, &gt;&gt; it has to be said clearly &gt;&gt; to the end time people that was Christ and Moses. &gt;&gt; That was Christ and Abraham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And tell us exactly what he was doing, chasing Satan all the way to hell to get you and to claim you and to claim me and to claim those that were in paradise. And Eve would say, "Who is this?" &gt;&gt; Says, "The seed of the woman." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not the seed of Adam, but the seed of God, the seed of the woman. &gt;&gt; Who is this? Ezekiel said, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the wheel within the wheel." &gt;&gt; The rock that's cut out of the mountain without hands. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? And we could say if we were in the grave and and happened to be there and had this experience, which we won't have, but we'd say, "Who is this?" We can say it in life. This is him that descended. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From the heavens with a rainbow over his head, &gt;&gt; having the covenant of God. &gt;&gt; This is him. This is him who revealed the mystery of God. The mystery is his coming. how he's doing it &gt;&gt; and how his brethren, speaking of Joseph, how his brethren was made to know him, how they wept and said, "This is our sin." And how that he was portrayed letter by letter of Christ. Even in Joseph's life, it was little by little, &gt;&gt; by little, &gt;&gt; but he portrayed Christ. &gt;&gt; My message to you today is, and I perhaps have one more message coming on, but we spend too much time looking at our natural life &gt;&gt; and our failures. That's why I didn't say very much the other day, Brother Mark. [laughter] I was sharing this with Brother Mark and Sister Rachel, and I got to preaching a little bit at the at the dinner table, but and it was so burdening on my heart. There isn't anybody here that hasn't failed. &gt;&gt; So, we want to major on our failings. We've been in all kinds of situations and things that we don't want to make it public. We we don't want to bring these shameful things out. God knew that. &gt;&gt; God knew that when he brought us here. &gt;&gt; He says, "And I will provide something &gt;&gt; that is sufficient &gt;&gt; to not eradicate. &gt;&gt; Not just so I'll forget it." No. Not just so I'll forgive you. No. So that I will annihilate it. &gt;&gt; And I whom the creator will never find it again. and you can't find it again. And in fact is if you need to know, I'll send a messenger that will tell you that the ink turns to bleach. &gt;&gt; I'll say such strong things that you'll have a hard time believing it. But if you keep saying it enough, you'll finally believe it. God took all those old doctrines and turned them to bleach. God took all our old failures. God took our sin, the ink, and dropped it into his blood, and it vanished &gt;&gt; and does not exist anymore. &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; A part of Christ coming. &gt;&gt; You say, "But I remember it." That's you that remembers it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet gave an answer to that, too. He said, "You need to have the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost blow that flu clear." &gt;&gt; This old memory stuff &gt;&gt; that presses you down and makes you almost impotent and makes you almost like a weakened. You got to get rid of that thing and say if you don't get anything else in life, say, "Holy Spirit, blow this channel clean so that this thing will never come back to my mind." &gt;&gt; We need that. &gt;&gt; We need that here this morning. &gt;&gt; We need people to say that. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; cleanse this. cleanse this memory channel &gt;&gt; and and purify it with the fire of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So little by little we are living out our part. Let me just give it to you in a natural sense for just a moment. Just a moment. I'll give you a secret mystery in your own life. It's called tomorrow. And the scripture says, don't say that I will do thus and so and so forth. You don't know what you're going to do. You say, "If the will, if the Lord wills, I will." &gt;&gt; Boast not thyself that tomorrow, for thou knowest not what tomorrow may bring. &gt;&gt; And what is your life? It's even as a vapor. &gt;&gt; It appearth for a little while, then vanishth. &gt;&gt; So, we don't know when it's going to be. We don't know. And it's not even that. We We don't know. So, tomorrow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; Now, if I get this across, you'll be able to really understand it. Yesterday's not a mystery. &gt;&gt; What's the difference between yesterday and tomorrow? You lived yesterday out already &gt;&gt; and your life interpreted. &gt;&gt; What you did was an interpretation of your life. &gt;&gt; I did I did certain thing yesterday. I actually did a certain thing that made up part of your life. your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's your life. So now, not all of those acts are in the Bible, but there are some acts and and I could get very very deep now where you'd get swimming. There are some acts that look like they're total defeat and that you lost it. And yet God takes a hold of that act and turns it around &gt;&gt; to his own glory. &gt;&gt; And I don't know how. I just say that does happen. Yes, &gt;&gt; but I don't I wouldn't even play God or even attempt to play God to say well some of these things you know to so let me just stay with what I do understand and that is in this life I want to make a very important point in this life that's you this is your life there was a time when you you were a complete mystery but you were coming &gt;&gt; you were born &gt;&gt; and your mother held you in her arm and said how sweet and how innocent and how lovely and so on and so forth, but they didn't know some of the things you were going to do. &gt;&gt; Or they might have wailed on you right at the beginning, but you were just so innocent and so sweet and so cuddly and lovely and and uh you know the hell but your life your life your life which is from the beginning to the end of your life that was a mystery &gt;&gt; but it became interpreted by you living it out. Now Jesus came born of a virgin and lived just a very short time and only ministered for three and a half years. &gt;&gt; Most of it was left and in his life he was typed all the way through the Old Testament by the saints by their acts that were written in the Bible. And now most of his ministry would be going to his his disciples, the apostles, and the church. And the Holy Ghost came in now. And so now we're living this life. And in this life, we're actually that's what transforming power is all about. And there's probably people sitting here who said, "When I got saved, when I gave my life to Christ, I was certain I could never raise my hand. I could never clap my hand. I could never worship God like these people." But you know what? After a little while, you did &gt;&gt; because it just came natural &gt;&gt; and you began to worship. &gt;&gt; That that's all part of the scripture. And they will worship him. &gt;&gt; That's all part of the scripture. Do you see where I'm coming &gt;&gt; now? Now, now we want to come down, and this is what I want so badly to do to come down to this end time season that we're in. There are certain things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'll be very specific. Who's in China? You say Murphy Wong's in China. I'm going to correct that and say Jesus Christ is in China. &gt;&gt; Who's in Vietnam? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is in Vietnam. who's in Uganda. Jesus Christ is in Uganda &gt;&gt; and those young people and the minister himself and brother Kim and all others and the other ministers of this message and the different places around the world. They we we know them by name. That's their natural name. But who's in that country? Jesus Christ is in that country. Very few people have a revelation of that. &gt;&gt; We were, brother Milo and I and my wife were in Yugoslavia and met Martin Lon who was here and some of you remember him and we were with his mother and were taken to her house when she was just a 15year-old girl and looked at the mantle big mantels that heated the place. There was actually sufficient room for a girl, her at 15 years old, to sleep on that mantle. And she said that she was one night, late at night, she says about the middle of the night, a heavy knock came on the door. So just a heavy poundering on the door and there was snow on the ground. It was winter time. And uh her father, stepfather was an alcoholic. and her mother and dad went to the door to open it and she jumped off the mantle who's coming at this time of the night way up in the mountain. We've been to that place and they opened the door and she said there was a large man. It looked like he filled the doorway and he stood there and with a thunderous voice he said Jesus Christ has come to this house tonight. He had a revelation &gt;&gt; and he was called the Bible man, the man of God. And five years, she was 15, he was 35. No, he was 50. And he came back five years later and married her and she became his wife. And she had three children. Two of them became Baptist ministers and one became the woman became a Supreme Court judge in Alaska. I met them all. sat in her home, have had lunch with them and dinner. And that woman said to me, said, "How did Brother Brandham say to have the Lord's table?" I said, "It's the communion and the footwashing." She said, "That's right." And she just some something within her. And so we say, "It's Jesus Christ. Who is it that's sending this message out?" That's right. &gt;&gt; Say it's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just Jesus Christ in me moving, inspiring me. No, it's Jesus Christ in his coming. &gt;&gt; And that's the secret mystery. &gt;&gt; We don't realize it. &gt;&gt; We don't know it &gt;&gt; until a prophet had to say it in such explicit terms and over and over and over again in just a line here and a line there. Let me tell you friends, Jesus Christ has indeed come &gt;&gt; to us and in this generation in a different way to conclude his great work of redemption. &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes, please? So finally the spirit of God and in the and it now we're in the crisis the mystery of God revealed. I might have some of this for you. The coming of Christ is redemption in prog process or in progress. The physical arrival of Jesus Christ on earth was the culmination of all the events of redemption in the Old Testament. Christ was coming through all of the Old Testament saints. &gt;&gt; The hidden mystery. There's not a Christ. The mystery God revealed. I can't read. Thank you. the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded. Now, here's a prophet speaking. How that it's unfolded. So, he's saying the hidden mystery has unfolded. Unfolded itself. He didn't say I unfolded it or any man or church unfolded it. it unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living. He says then you will understand clearly then you see on uh I believe what is being done &gt;&gt; now God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knew nothing about it. Even the angels didn't understand it. See he didn't reveal it. And that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence. &gt;&gt; You read the seventh I've talked to a lot of people said I read the seventh seal and I was a I I was I was disappointed cuz they're expecting some great explosion. No, you can't get all the revelation at once. It must be little by little. You'll understand. You'll be faithful. You'll come to the house of God. You'll hear it from this side. You'll hear it through this vessel. You'll hear it through the messenger. And little by little, you'll possess and inherit your inheritance. &gt;&gt; And what you're actually doing is acting out what's written in the book of redemption. You are a part of the book of redemption. That's why the book of redemption had to be opened up, made known by a prophet messenger. Because then when the message was spoken, you had something to believe. &gt;&gt; Now this is critical. Not something to think about, not something to argue over. You now had something to believe. &gt;&gt; You had a message. Not something that you could perform yourself. Not something you could physically do. You had something you could believe. &gt;&gt; And by believing, you are transformed. &gt;&gt; And by believing, you better believe it. One of these days, by believing, you'll be transported. &gt;&gt; Is that clear? &gt;&gt; And that's the reason. So there was a reason why it even had to be silent. It has to be silent because it can't be told. It the whole record can't be told of the coming of Christ as a great secret mystery. The secret mystery is his coming and how he comes. &gt;&gt; He's coming through the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet says in the seven seals and listen close. He says the seals is him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that &gt;&gt; the seals is him? In other words, he's unveiling himself. He's taking the cloak off. The seals is him. &gt;&gt; But further on in the message, you'll find out the prophet saying that she is him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when he made himself known, she believed it and she became it. So then she became him. &gt;&gt; Which is what it was in the beginning. There was a time when when Adam when Eve came out from him, he said he would call her, you know, bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything had its origin in at that first Adam. &gt;&gt; And and now we have our origin in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we originated. &gt;&gt; We didn't originate in a natural human sperm. We originated in the mind of God who said this individual will come forth. All of this farm, all of this uh lineage is just it's just something I put in motion to bring this individual and that individual is going to act out part of my great secret which I'm holding with and the secret is I'm going to buy it back. &gt;&gt; This is the secret of redemption. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring it back. I'm going to bring it back to its original state. I'm going to bring back original sons and daughters of God. Spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; And so I'll speak the word. They'll believe it. They'll be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus when he was on earth, they wanted to know when he would come as a subject. And he said it's not even the son himself doesn't know when it's going to happen. See, God had all of this to himself. It's a secret. And that's the reason there was silence in heaven. That's the reason. Notice there was silence in heaven. I read a number of commentaries. I just scanned them because I don't study them, but I I read them to and because they said, "Well, it might be this one. It might be that." And you're going all over the map. I like to be able to read a message that doesn't leave me going all over the map. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God says, "This is what it was." &gt;&gt; And they But they all agreed on one thing. The half hour silence. If we don't understand the half hour silence, but they said one thing is certain and they all agree on this. Something stupendous is about to happen. I said, "Boy, if you boys only knew what you were saying. Something stupendous. What could be more stupendous than in this degradation, in this filth and sin, I'm going to bring a spotless people to show the power of my blood, my sacrifice, my new creation, the beginning of the new creation. This isn't going to be a church. This is going to be spotless ones. This is going to be the redeemed ones. This is going to be the Exodus people. Hallelujah. And I'm going to come upon them with my own spirit until they know for certain they are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they also will have a part of me. They will actually live out my life by the Holy Spirit, thus living out their own redemption. And the seven thunders uttered their voices and John was forbidden to write it. See the coming of the Lord. So he couldn't write it. That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come. It's a good thing that he doesn't know. He has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. So the types, but we didn't know what those types were till a messenger come and says, "Now there's Christ. &gt;&gt; Here he is." &gt;&gt; When did you hear Abraham chasing uh you know going after the kings? Was Christ going after Satan? You ever heard that? It had to wait till this end time. And and therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in in Christ. And the entire Bible is an expression of one goal. &gt;&gt; How many goals? &gt;&gt; One goal. Say it again. One goal that God had, one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And here it is. &gt;&gt; You can memorize it if you want. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible, not all the acts of the believers, they did all kinds of bad things, but all the acts of the believers in the Bible. And the Bible even records some very, very nasty things, evil things, and sinful things that the believers did. Their acts are recorded in the Tamar's Tam Tamar's act of seducing her father-in-law is in the scripture. Listen to me. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ in her, &gt;&gt; forcing her because it was Christ that had to come as a lion of Judah. &gt;&gt; And Judah had no more sons &gt;&gt; to give her seed. and she must she must restore the seed of the tribe of Judah. She wasn't wanting a man. She wasn't wanting a sexual experience. She wasn't wanting motherhood. She wasn't whimpering over anything. She knew this Christ must come. &gt;&gt; This is part of his coming. And if it means I have to be a harlot, so be it. If it means I have to lose my reputation, so be it. &gt;&gt; But that seed must come. &gt;&gt; Now, let me put it in today's language. &gt;&gt; Let me bring it up to today. &gt;&gt; There's people who could go out and make a nice living. &gt;&gt; There's people who could go out and make a fortune. There's people who could go out and and and and become educated. And there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with any of those things depending how. But there's one goal and that's God's goal. &gt;&gt; That's the only goal is God's goal. &gt;&gt; The only goal is God's mystery. &gt;&gt; And as long as it's Christ in me that's doing these things, &gt;&gt; whatever whatever it is, if I must lose my reputation, so be it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I must have a small church or small group of people or if we must meet in a house or if we must meet in a garage someplace, so be it. &gt;&gt; Listen, folks, I know what I'm talking about. We're in You're in a nice church. You're sitting in a nice pew. &gt;&gt; I in the success of business came to church four times a week and sat on unplaned planks. 2 by12 planks sitting on blocks of wood. You remember it, don't you? How many remember it? One, we got chairs later on. What were we sitting on when you were there, Violet? Chairs. I think it was a chair. God bless you, Violet. You're here. still here. &gt;&gt; You don't know what goes through my mind. One day she's a young lady at 19 years old and she came and got saved as a result of her mother. Her mother, and you forgive me, Sister Violet, I'm sure you won't mind, but her mother was a cleaning woman in the P& exhibition grounds. And some of our young people, just like you young people, had a booth with a banner, Truly Elias shall first come. And some books of Brother Brham, not unlike what will be at the Lynen Fair. Brother Matthew and my daughter Marilyn went down to use the washroom in the horse barns, and the animal barns. And she's in the washroom and this little woman comes up to her and says, "Are you with those young people from up there at that booth?" Said, "Yes." She says, and she was real, she was real feisty in one way. She says, "I want what you got." &gt;&gt; And she was in church up at the house and we baptized her. And then along come Violet. &gt;&gt; Violet came in And she had a very good friend, a lady friend, girl friend I believe it was, out here in the valley someplace. I don't know all the details, Violet, but I knew that you were weighing out very much weighing out this whole thing. And we knelt at a chair. You remember it? I remember it well. And we knelt at a chair and just began to pray. &gt;&gt; And she sobbed and that was it. &gt;&gt; Violet, that wasn't brother Ed. &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; persuading you. &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ in you &gt;&gt; acting out &gt;&gt; part of the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; You're living it. You're living it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are living it. &gt;&gt; I felt I'm here today to tell you forget about this life. &gt;&gt; The ultimate thing is you believe the word &gt;&gt; that God sent. &gt;&gt; We believe on him who God has sent. &gt;&gt; We believe the vindicated message. &gt;&gt; Where else is it? &gt;&gt; There is no other place. &gt;&gt; Simply by believing it. And you'll find all through the scripture when people simply believed it and lived it, just loved it, they're the ones that moved on. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm able to make myself clear. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine. Shut that off now. say who brought the message to you? If I was to ask you that question, you might say, well, so and so brought it to me. I would like to change your thinking this e this morning. And I want you to think on it the rest of the day. Some of you have been born. And I look at some of the young people, I say, "You've been born into homes that are believing homes." Say, "Well, my mother and dad, they believe the message." There'd be a lot more young people who would probably be in the house of God today if they realized that God in his divine mercy arranged for you. For whatever reason, he didn't want you to be all tied up and all ins snared and all tangled up in the world. So, he protected you from it. &gt;&gt; Others for his own reason, he wanted them. Listen, the Apostle Paul, I want you to listen very carefully because Satan will work on your failures or your past and his he is so determined so that you don't see what the great mystery is and that you are part of that mystery. you. The mystery is Christ's coming. &gt;&gt; And you are part of that coming because you're bringing him on. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You're bringing him on and and and I I want to bring you to Apostle Paul. Apostle Paul says of himself, and I don't know if you'd want to write it in a book, and maybe you're not uh you're not uh accountable for it, but he said, "I was a blasphemer." You know that he said that &gt;&gt; I was a blasphemer and I consented to the persecution of the church &gt;&gt; and he stood there and let the clothing the garments of Steven be at his feet while the people stoned him and killed him. &gt;&gt; And what a brutal thing it was &gt;&gt; with stones crashing in. say you don't make it too vivid. You it'll never be vivid enough for you. And stones crashing in on that young man's head and to see him kneel down to ask God to forgive them and his his face shining with the glory of God that burned into the very soul region of Apostle Paul. And he said, "I was a blasphemer and I consented to their death and I persecuted the church and I put them in prison." But he said, &gt;&gt; "But I labored more than they are. &gt;&gt; I drove him. &gt;&gt; I failed God. &gt;&gt; I did things I'm ashamed of. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to give my life so unreservedly. I'm going to do this kingdom of Satan damage. &gt;&gt; And you can say, you might say, what can I say? You can say, I've been birthed in the darkest of ages. &gt;&gt; I've been birthed in the most deceived &gt;&gt; of the ages. &gt;&gt; I've been birthed amongst people who are completely given over to satanic vulgarity. It's in the school. It's in the school library. It's in It's on the streets. And the people love it. &gt;&gt; Is it so? &gt;&gt; Say amen if you believe that. &gt;&gt; And God has brought me here. &gt;&gt; I will give myself unreservedly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Against the kingdom of Satan. I will give myself unreservedly to him who brought death to the people. And I will declare by my living I have life, &gt;&gt; eternal life. &gt;&gt; And I shall &gt;&gt; defeat &gt;&gt; by his grace. I shall defeat death &gt;&gt; either by a resurrection &gt;&gt; or by a change of this body. I'm seeking that I might by God's grace invigorate you somewhat tonight or this morning &gt;&gt; prophet said and he I'm I'm giving you some of these things that sounds like I'm being repetitious but I'm not. I want to give you some of the quotes. And he said, "I'll not give you this." And God talked to Moses and I'll give you the land in one year. I have an important point to make with this. I'll not give you the land in one year. For if I give you the whole thing to you in a year, that's the inheritance. If I give the whole inheritance to you &gt;&gt; at one time, the wild beast will come in and consume you. &gt;&gt; But little by little &gt;&gt; as you're able, &gt;&gt; I will give you the land. &gt;&gt; Now when they said, "I will drive out the enemies, the Hittites &gt;&gt; and the Canaanites, &gt;&gt; they were sons of Ham &gt;&gt; and sons of Heth. their lineage and he said I will drive them out. In other words, he said he would send hornets &gt;&gt; and we we have to we have to put it into our language, &gt;&gt; put it into our understanding. Okay, I'm I've come now I've come into the message. We sing the same as others and we worship the same and there's other churches and I have the same Bible. They have a King James and I have it and many of them have watered down translations etc. Listen close. There were all kinds of people, nations of people and cities of people enjoying the blessings of the promised land, but they were not the children of the inheritance. &gt;&gt; And that's the difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people that are good people that are Christians that are Catholics, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, whatever more may be healed. &gt;&gt; Harlot on the street can get healed because God honors faith. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean they're spiritual. &gt;&gt; That's part of the blessings &gt;&gt; and people receive the blessings from God. That's not what it's about. &gt;&gt; It's not about blessings. And it's not about someone standing behind the pulp and I'm anointed. Of course you're anointed. &gt;&gt; But do you do you receive the word of God that God sent? Well, no. I found problem with that. Well, fine. The anointing is genuine. You're false. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it's the genuine Holy Ghost anointing. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says it twice in false anointed ones. A genuine Holy Ghost anointing. And that's what makes us so deceptive. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, he's anointed. I know he's anointed." These are my words to brother Brandham. I know they're anointed because I know what the anointing is. &gt;&gt; And he said, "The rain falls." He just took four scriptures. The rain falls on the just and the I said the unjust. Right. In the last days, Peter said, "In the last days, sayith God, I'll pour out my spirit upon all &gt;&gt; all flesh." Not all flesh is saved. He'll pour his spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; I've seen drunkards. I've seen all kinds of people want God and they they weep and they sobb and they beg and they want God and they want deliverance, but they don't want deliverance. They want help. They want to get to manage their sin. &gt;&gt; And Satan has just run rough shot over their lives. &gt;&gt; And I'm giving you good good advice this morning, friends. &gt;&gt; Don't let any of the gods and God warned them. Don't let any of the gods of the land, don't let any of the gods, don't let the god of money, don't let the god of science, don't let the god of education, don't let the god of of uh uh popularity or fame or beauty. &gt;&gt; Don't let those gods start to dictate to your life. &gt;&gt; Don't let the god of business dictate to your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're to be the master of it. &gt;&gt; And wherever whatever happens to you in the world, fine. But don't let those gods I've seen people who have allowed themselves to be dictated by the gods and the life spirals, just spirals downward. &gt;&gt; Has this helped you this morning? I'm going to close now. I just rehearse now. Your life. Your life. And the reason I'm saying so much about this, your life is a mystery. Say really? Yeah. Tomorrow's a mystery. If &gt;&gt; anybody can stand up here and say, "I have a thus sayith the Lord about tomorrow." I'll say, "First, you're either ignorant or you're a liar &gt;&gt; because nobody knows for sure. You have aspirations. You might even be making preparations." But uh you don't know what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Anybody have their day or the schedule interrupted in this last week? Let me see your hands. Wow, there's a few h humans here. We had our schedule interrupted. &gt;&gt; And we went completely another direction. Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; You know what that proves? It was a secret. &gt;&gt; And then then this thing, I'm trying to make his coming very simple. And then this thing come up and and there was really nothing you could do. So you just Well, I didn't expect this. I don't even know what's going to come of it. But you just waddle your way through it, you know. You just plow ahead. Plow ahead. And how many? I thought that just sounds silly, but it's absolutely true. Then you turned around and looked through said, "Wow, look, I just came through that." &gt;&gt; You didn't know what that was till you lived it out. And then your life interpreted what it was. &gt;&gt; That's why it was silent. &gt;&gt; Amen. because God was going to take a group of people and live out this part of his coming. &gt;&gt; We are here for the closing chapter. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here &gt;&gt; and that's to take the mystery out of it. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in a sense we say well Christ is the whole book. That's exactly right. But and we hear about the open book. Well, the book had to be open. And the mystery or the secret of the book because the secret of the book was that this is the book of redemption. I've got I'm say I'm way out of my place here, but this is the book of redemption. It's called the book of redemption. That's God's great secret. How I'm going to redeem it back. I'm going to redeem it back to myself. So Christ's first coming to who who could who could predict? Isaiah said he's you know who's believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord uh shown and he says and how he comes and he'll be wounded and he'll be he'll be beaten and he'll be marred more than that of any man his visage will be marred more and and that they how could how could they ever understand who is listening that would be the son of God. How could they ever understand that? They couldn't understand. It's a total mystery. &gt;&gt; But it was all his coming. &gt;&gt; And here we are now. I'm just I'm closing right away. But here we are today and we've come into the knowledge of the message. And we've heard some very very astounding things been spoken. Brother Bran will reach out there and and say something and you'll just say, you know, where'd that come from? He'll make statements. And so there's a tendency just to disregard it. Don't disregard it. It fits someplace. &gt;&gt; And God will anoint some man behind the pulpit to make it fit. &gt;&gt; And it'll just come, you know, to me to me it's if you just even got this that he is those seals. You hear so much about the seals, the seals, the seals. What is that all? It's his coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the other part is he had to reveal it and have it spoken and told you clearly that this is the this is the season. This is the time. That's why it had to be made known. And when it was made known in a message, then you could believe it. &gt;&gt; That's what God has called the world to do, to either believe it or reject it. &gt;&gt; And you've seen and I I hear from different ones and they say, "Well, there's so much in the message and there, oh, forget it. there's only one message &gt;&gt; and we just believe it. And they try to make philosophy out of it and tradition out of it. And that's old stuff. &gt;&gt; They've done that for generations. &gt;&gt; So I say to the people of God, I say to the people of this church, I say to the people that are that are streaming, just don't even pay attention to it. Don't give it any time. God has confirmed his word &gt;&gt; and he has opened up the secret mysterious things. And the mysterious things was simply this. That was him all the time. You said, "Well, I thought that was me." No, that was him. &gt;&gt; I thought that was me witness. I had such a wonderful witness. No, no, it wasn't you. It was the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And that one had to hear it either to reject it or to accept it because that was him and his coming. We're in his coming. We're living out his coming. And that's why the prophet spoke about the bride coming of Christ. It's not the apostles coming. It's the bride coming of Christ. Because the bride is living out another part of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; The bride is the one that carries the seed. &gt;&gt; The bride is the one that becomes pregnantated. The bride is the one that brings forth Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; As Mary did &gt;&gt; in the culminating act. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know some are getting it, some aren't getting. I'll say it again. The bride is the one that carries seed. &gt;&gt; That is why when Eve come, Eve was the vessel for seed. &gt;&gt; That's why the serpent never came to Mo. Never came to Adam. He didn't have the facility to carry the seed. &gt;&gt; He came to Eve &gt;&gt; because she had the faculty of the facility to carry seed &gt;&gt; and pregnant her with the seed. &gt;&gt; And in the end time, our Lord Jesus Christ descends into Satan's Eden and finds his bride and pregnant with his seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And restores it all back again. And you say, "Well, I had this experience. I had that experience. This happened. That happened." It It's not just something happened. I heard a good sermon. No, no, no. I want to get you to understand it's Christ and his coming. That was Jesus Christ I heard that morning in church. It's Jesus Christ that used me to witness to that person. Get the revelation that old brother in Yugoslavia got this day &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has walked in these doors &gt;&gt; and you'll have a different kind of a meeting. &gt;&gt; You say this day I go here to church. Everybody goes to some kind of church. That's not what it's about. This day Jesus Christ walked here cuz I want to fellowship with others of my own kind. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I enjoy the word. &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for my wife because I just get in locked in there and [laughter] I just stay there hour. I I just say it's just amazing. I think I I just got five more minutes and man, I look at my clock and two hours has gone by. So when I'm when I say here I'm just going to be another couple minutes. Uh don't always feel it's going to be two hours, but we we're going down to Seattle tonight to be uh with the saints down there. And uh I only got to page four, so I got a few pages for them as well. You'll remember us in prayer. &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, shall we? &gt;&gt; Lord, we sang the chorus. I just want to thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to sing that again because I just want to thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for bringing us this word. I want to thank you, Father, that your servant, your prophet, your messenger was uncompromising &gt;&gt; and he would not waver with this word. &gt;&gt; And even though it was costing him not only friends, it was costing him reputation, they were saying all kinds of evil things. I'm so thankful that he was unmoved. &gt;&gt; Where would we be if he had been moved or if he watered this thing down? We need to hear it in its full strength. And Lord, because we hear it in its full strength, we see the glorious light. And truly, we can say that the glory of God has shone upon us. Truly, we can say there has been a resurrection. We see dead bodies everywhere. We see violence everywhere. We see, oh God, we see something else. And we see a people rising out of the earth. Oh God with the sun has shone upon them and life has come back the original life to the original seed not in the shock anymore as your prophet said it's not in the shock the glorious saying it's in the word it's in the seed and here we are here we are people that have come forth father I pray you will bless this congregation &gt;&gt; give them a mighty afternoon and a mighty day and I ask especially Lord a special request that your Holy Spirit will bring these things to them to ponder. May they ponder upon them deeply. And that as they read and read your word and as they study and read your message and they hear your servants preach, I pray father you will spark uh the realities of this glorious gospel to them in Jesus name. take these words that have been spoken, Lord, as perhaps uh broken up, but I just felt to talk to the people this way today. I ask that you'll make it a great great part of their spiritual life in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to [music] thank you Lord for letting [singing] me hear your word. Why [music] have I not deserve such glory? [music] Thanks for that special night [music] when I saw your glorious life [music] came to me with eternal life. Lord, I thank you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; didn't have to open [singing] my eyes to the early [music] past. All the [singing] age I were living in was fresh [music] and mine. Then I heard recognizing your name. [music] the sweet and perfect for the tree and the blessing. [music] Lord, I [singing] thank you. Let's rejoice now. And I just want to thank you, Lord, [music] for letting me hear your word. [music] What have I done? [singing] The glory you reveal is me. [music] Thanks for that special night. [music] And I [singing] saw your glorious high to face with [music] eternal life. Lord, I thank you. [music] God [singing] even my wildest dream. [music] I think I cease at the time [music and singing] of the Lord. After my I [music] [singing] now I see God is in this [music] one word in your I [singing] thank you [music] and just thank you Lord for [music and singing] letting to hear your words. What [music and singing] have I done to deserve such glory? Thanks for that special [music] night. When I saw your glorious life, he made [music] eternal life. Lord, I thank you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; going to dismiss in just a moment, but I want to say we've got brothers that are ministering behind me, Brother John, Brother Tom, [music] Brother Tim, and others. I can just preede that time by a wee bit. I want to tell you, I'm here [music] now giving part of my own testimony. And there are times when I took this book and I was just as sincere as I am today reading it. And I would spend time I remember one time I was in the [music] I was in the furnace room of a church out in the states someplace [music] and I was on the concrete that's on my face before God cuz I had to preach that night. Not that I didn't have a message. I just praying that God and and I get behind the pulpit and just become absolutely electrified. But it, you know, it was maybe one [music] simple page of a few notes and then then it happened. Then it happened. [music] When I sing glorious light, I mean glorious light. When I say I don't you didn't have to do it, Lord. I know what I'm talking about. And now here we are today and these these men of God that are ministering. We got a fountain that is just [music] flowing and it's available to you. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking that you as a result even of this service today. You if you wonder, well, what should I read? What should I Well, you could perhaps take Christ is the mystery of God revealed. So, well, I've read it. You want [music] to You can hardly hold the pages together. My message book Christ it is you take it seriously [music] don't worry about studying your exams you young people in school [music] sorry brother Terry but you read this one and you read it prayerfully line by line and then you will understand even more what we're saying there it is I heard that over the pulpit there it is [music] and you could read uh sers Sir, is this the time? And take the title. Brother Brandham is saying, "Sir, is this the time?" And then he gets on the message and he comes right to the seven seals and he says, "Uh, you know, almost like I almost hope not, but are we there? Is this where we're at? Is this what's happening?" I mean he just was and then and then he says in the Christ the mystery of God revealed he says and then then you might understand what it's [music] been trying to you know trying to hold all these things and trying to say it and trying to make it then you'll understand when you understand what it is you'll understand the pressure it's been on him trying to hold it glorious friends we're going to walk through the streets hallelujah of a new city of a kingdom that'll have no war no trouble That's where we're headed. That's this great thing and it's unfolding right now and you're part of it. [music] That's a great honor. Hallelujah. Brother John, why don't you come and close in prayer? Would you please pray for us this afternoon? Would you please? Wonderful food. It's good food. It's eagle food. Let's thank the Lord for it. Lord Jesus, we're so satisfied this afternoon. We're so grateful for the word that's been coming to us, Lord. It's eagle food. It's rapture food. It's food getting us ready for a body change. Lord, this world is so sloppy, so corrupt, killing their own people. Satan is so happy with the kingdom he's tried to pervert over the ages. And Lord, it seems like right in the middle of this darkness, your word is coming to us stronger and stronger, getting us ready to get out of here. Lord, we feel like we're standing on the top of the stature of a perfect man, that great pyramid revelation, asking, Lord Jesus, let your presence make this real to us, Lord. Let it soak down into the vitamins of our lives, down to our fingertips, down to our toes, Lord. Don't let it be intellectual. Don't let us just be in church, God, but may these meetings begin to move in our hearts in a greater rapture, catching our children, catching those that are single, the older ones. Lord, we're getting caught away. Lord, you're bringing this down to where we can understand it. It's not a mystery no longer. It's not just silence no longer, but Lord, you're speaking the voice of the resurrection. You're talking to us along the road, God, and our eyes are coming open. We're recognizing our day. We're seeing the messages for us. And Lord, we want it to mean something daily as we surrender and as we yield. Lord, we don't want it to be fantasy. We don't want it to just be imagination. We don't want to make our ministers or even our pastor just a superstar. Lord, we want it to come down to us, Lord, where we're living in our homes where the message is becoming real to us. God with skin on it, Lord. Lord, would you get with brother Biscoll this afternoon as he travels across the border how so many times we've done it ourselves and to come to an evening me meeting weary and body but I pray the Holy Ghost would pick him up Lord may the shepherd of the flock Lord minister to the believers in Reon Lord at these junctions at these changes how we need your divine hand your leadership we want to see the guide Lord reach his hand out of the clouds clouds out of the fog. Just get our attention and say, "Sheep, this is the direction. [music] This is where we need to go." And Lord, we believe it's going to take us back to our future home, back to all those things that are dear to us. Lord Jesus, bless the congregation today, Lord. Lord, we so are reveling in the presence of God. We just, Lord, desire to see it, Lord, in our lips, in our fellowship, in our conversation. [music] I pray in the fellowship hall today and throughout this building and as the those go to their separate homes or places of fellowship that you would just raise the level of our anticipation that even our fellowship would be around the things of God that it would surprise a mother, surprise a father, surprise other of the young people in fellowship that someone is speaking about the Lord, speaking about the word. But let it become common. Not in a a common way, but let it just become our way of speech. Let it just become our way, Lord, that we're living off of the food that you're giving to us. Lord, take us, [music] Lord, and heal bodies and bring homes together, Lord. Bring lives that are just confused. Bring it back to their rightful place, God. May eyes come open, Lord Jesus. Even out over the internet, Lord, there's many needs. There's many that are hungering and thirsting for God in their midst. Lord, would you bless them, Lord, with a divine visitation? Go with our pastor this afternoon. Just strengthen him as he goes along the road that the saints in Reton would have a wonderful time. And bless all of us, Lord, as we see the day approaching. This morning service is now history. But Lord, we want to see more of your greatness, more of your simplicity in our lives flow through the body. Lord, even as we close this meeting, God, may someone's heart just be filled with that anticipation that this is the truth. Someone could be born again, changed, filled with the Holy Ghost as they're walking out of this church. [music] Lord, something could be moving in within their breast, Lord, that you have spoken to them. Lord, bless our day. We commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Greet one another with a kind of a handshake that they'll know [music] they're happy that you're here and you're happy they're there. God bless you. We'll see you this evening. Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; The power of &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music]
