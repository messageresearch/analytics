[16:07] couple announcements
[16:08] before we turn to the word and
[16:12] just about tall mentioned a little bit
[16:13] just to tighten up our chains a little
[16:15] bit on sunday
[16:16] with uh just our how we're conducting
[16:20] here at the services and here in the
[16:23] chapels the supplies to every
[16:24] every one of us some of this some
[16:26] specifics to hear but
[16:27] um we're just wanting to be very aware
[16:30] of of of how we're handling ourselves
[16:32] both inside here and the deacons are
[16:34] just helping keep the order for
[16:36] our distancing etcetera but it also
[16:39] applies outside
[16:41] and and so i i know in some of our
[16:44] guidelines we
[16:45] stated you know just to kind of go out
[16:46] and hit the cars and kind of limit that
[16:48] time there but i i don't have a
[16:50] problem with the fellowship out there
[16:52] and that's a big part of being able to
[16:54] come to the chapel at the camp or here
[16:56] be able to just to fellowship but it is
[16:58] very important that we maintain some
[17:02] distance
[17:03] i came out on sunday and i was a little
[17:05] bit uh
[17:06] woo dear we're just a little bit bunched

[17:16] very keen and then they just see a whole

[18:07] so just please if you're on the balcony
[18:08] you need to park on the far side past
[18:10] the pylons there
[18:11] and and we'll just be as conscious as we
[18:15] can and we just kind of jerk our chains
[18:16] a little bit so that we

[26:03] way he made us
[26:05] amen so let's take our bibles and turn

[26:12] thank you musicians
[26:13] and i appreciate each and every one
[26:16] contributing to the service
[26:19] praise the lord luke chapter 10
[26:24] we'll begin reading at verse 17. i want
[26:26] to take a subject
[26:28] a kind of a carry forward from the last
[26:30] subject of after love comes joy
[26:33] i want to zero in on the joy because
[26:37] your name is
[26:38] written in heaven the joy because your
[26:41] name is written in heaven
[26:43] and we'll just see how far we get
[26:45] tonight see whether we
[26:46] finish tonight or continue on sunday
[26:49] morning which
[26:50] lord willing will take the sunday
[26:51] morning as well so you be praying
[26:54] and above all just pray that the lord
[26:56] will have his way
[26:58] luke chapter 10 and verse
[27:01] 17 is where we will begin
[27:04] and the 70 returned again with joy
[27:07] now remember jesus had sent out the
[27:09] seventy two by two
[27:11] to go and minister he gave them power
[27:14] over devils and
[27:15] and all sorts of things over diseases
[27:17] and they returned with joy
[27:19] saying lord even the devils are subject
[27:22] unto us
[27:23] through thy name so there was great joy
[27:26] here
[27:27] this is a particular type of joy and
[27:29] there's many aspects of joy throughout
[27:31] the scripture
[27:32] for different reasons but jesus said
[27:35] unto them i bel i beheld satan as
[27:38] lightning
[27:39] fall from heaven behold i give unto you
[27:43] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[27:45] and over all the power
[27:47] of the enemy and nothing shall by any
[27:50] means hurt you
[27:51] if this is the kind of power they had
[27:54] without the holy ghost
[27:56] what kind of power do we have by the
[27:58] holy ghost
[28:00] all right and he says notwithstanding
[28:04] notwithstanding all of that power
[28:07] and i'm sorry to keep you standing but
[28:08] let me just say who wouldn't be happy
[28:11] to see devil's subject unto them
[28:14] who wouldn't be happy to see satan fall
[28:17] from heaven like lightning
[28:19] who wouldn't be happy and rejoicing at
[28:21] that and go boy we had a meeting
[28:23] did you see that one get healed did you
[28:25] see the devil come out of that one did
[28:26] you see that
[28:28] that one there and jesus says
[28:29] notwithstanding in this
[28:31] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[28:34] unto you
[28:35] but rather rejoice because your names
[28:39] are written
[28:40] in heaven in that hour jesus rejoiced in
[28:44] spirit and said i thank the o father
[28:47] lord of heaven and earth that thou has
[28:48] hid these things from the wise and
[28:50] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[28:52] even so father for so
[28:54] it seemed good in thy sight all things
[28:57] are delivered
[28:58] to me of my father and no man knoweth
[29:00] who the son is
[29:01] but the father and who the father is but
[29:04] the son
[29:05] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[29:10] and he turned him unto his disciples and
[29:13] said privately
[29:14] blessed are the eyes which see the
[29:16] things that you see
[29:18] for i tell you that many prophets and
[29:20] kings
[29:21] have desired to see those things which
[29:23] you see
[29:24] and have not seen them and to hear those
[29:27] things which you hear
[29:28] and have not heard them amen the lord
[29:31] had his blessing to the word you may be
[29:33] seated
[29:37] rejoice that because your names are
[29:41] written
[29:42] in heaven what does it mean to be
[29:45] written
[29:46] in heaven what does it mean to be
[29:48] written what does it mean when you write
[29:50] something down when you
[29:52] record something obviously the purpose
[29:55] is that it's something worth remembering
[29:58] can you say amen to that some of you
[30:01] even come to
[30:02] church and you have your notepads and
[30:04] your pens and
[30:06] because you're not going to write down
[30:08] every word that i say you're not a
[30:09] scribe that's going to record
[30:11] every part of the service we have
[30:13] recording equipment that does that
[30:15] but but you want to record what speaks
[30:18] to you
[30:20] when something inspires
[30:23] something within yourself you want to
[30:25] make a record of it because you want to
[30:27] look at it again
[30:29] you might even go back to the service
[30:31] later on and say oh there was something
[30:33] brother tim
[30:33] said there there's a scripture he read
[30:35] or there was a quote that he read and
[30:37] i just didn't quite get it but it sure
[30:39] inspired me and so you might
[30:40] listen to it again or watch it again in
[30:42] order to pick something up
[30:44] so it's a record it's something that's
[30:46] recorded for future reference
[30:49] it's something that that then it be at
[30:52] the time that it's recorded
[30:54] then you expect that that recording or
[30:56] that writing
[30:57] is going to have a future application
[31:00] can you go with me there
[31:01] now in malachi chapter 3 and and if you
[31:04] brothers that are in the booth can
[31:06] i'll be referring to some scriptures and
[31:08] you can put it up on the screen for the
[31:10] people at home
[31:11] uh in malachi chapter 3 and verse 14
[31:15] you can refer to that in your bibles if
[31:17] you want
[31:18] he said you have said god's speaking to
[31:21] israel now remember the burden of the
[31:24] word of the lord to israel
[31:26] through malachi you know
[31:30] god said to them you say
[31:34] i don't love you or you say wherein do
[31:36] you love me
[31:38] and and god says was not uh was not esau
[31:42] jacob's brother but jacob have i loved
[31:44] he saw have i hated and so
[31:45] this book of malachi is about the
[31:48] relationship between god and
[31:50] israel and as he's expressing this now
[31:53] he says to them you have said
[31:56] it is vain to serve god and what prophet
[31:59] is it
[32:00] that we have kept his ordinance now
[32:02] remember
[32:04] well last time i spoke i referred to the
[32:07] psalm of asif
[32:09] who said i got guilty of looking at the
[32:11] world
[32:12] and i i beheld the world and i thought
[32:14] well you know they don't suffer and
[32:16] they're not condemned and they
[32:18] seem to have a good life and they're
[32:20] increased and everything like that
[32:21] he says but when i went to the house of
[32:24] god then i discovered the truth of the
[32:26] matter
[32:27] then and so his eyes became open and so
[32:30] now he's god is speaking to israel
[32:32] kind of in the same context and he says
[32:34] you have said it's vain to serve god
[32:36] what prophet is it that we have kept his
[32:38] ordinances
[32:39] that we have walked mournfully before
[32:42] the lord of hosts
[32:43] and now we call that proud happy yea
[32:46] they that work
[32:47] wickedness are set up yea they that
[32:49] tempt god or even delivered
[32:51] then they that feared the lord spake
[32:55] often one to another and the lord
[32:58] hearkened and heard it and
[33:01] a book of remembrance was written
[33:04] amen before him for
[33:07] them that feared the lord and that
[33:11] thought on his name so when
[33:14] when you're pondering the things of god
[33:16] when you're fellowshipping around the
[33:18] word of god
[33:19] there is a remembrance before god
[33:22] even as brother branham said when you
[33:24] speak about him
[33:25] he draws near so there's a spiritual
[33:29] heavenly connection
[33:31] based on fellowship and thoughts on the
[33:34] word of god
[33:35] and so he goes on and he says
[33:40] they shall be mine saith the lord of
[33:42] hosts i say amen to that
[33:44] in that day when i make up my jewels and
[33:47] i will spare them as a man
[33:49] spareth his own son that serveth him
[33:53] then shall you return and be and discern
[33:56] between the righteous and the wicked
[33:59] between him that
[34:01] serveth god and him that serveth him not
[34:06] now this is a powerful scripture
[34:09] because he's saying now you that have
[34:11] thought on me now why are you thinking
[34:13] on god
[34:14] the reason you're thinking of god is
[34:16] because a you're fellowshipping in what
[34:18] god has done for you
[34:19] or b you're maybe pondering a question
[34:23] that you don't understand brother
[34:25] branham often did that he talks about
[34:27] that in
[34:28] uh new ministry and and he talks about
[34:31] how that he was out squirrel hunting and
[34:33] he was pondering that scripture
[34:35] if you say to this mountain and so he
[34:38] was pondering
[34:39] and he thought and he was thinking of
[34:40] himself how it fit
[34:42] in the scriptures and how it fit in the
[34:44] atonement because all things were in
[34:46] atonement but that was spoken before the
[34:48] atonement was made
[34:50] and so as he's thinking on these things
[34:52] he's not realizing but god is dealing
[34:54] with him
[34:55] so often that's the way it is even with
[34:57] ministers and
[34:59] i trust with all of us but with
[35:00] ministers we don't just
[35:02] get a thought because it's our turn to
[35:04] preach
[35:05] we're often pondering the word of god
[35:07] we're often thinking about things
[35:09] someone will say something or or a
[35:11] little statement or or something or
[35:13] you'll get into an atmosphere and god
[35:15] will begin to quicken things
[35:16] because when you get into the presence
[35:18] of the lord the gift within you begins
[35:21] to operate
[35:22] it's just the way it is listen let
[35:24] somebody get up here preach it i don't
[35:26] care who it is
[35:27] brother murphy brother michael brother
[35:29] john whoever it is
[35:31] i'm sure brother tom will agree with me
[35:33] let them stand up here preaching and
[35:35] we'll be sitting there and it's like
[35:36] i could get up right now and finish that
[35:38] thought you know why because the gift
[35:40] begins to operate
[35:42] it's not the man it's not the
[35:43] intelligence but there's something that
[35:45] god put in the man
[35:47] he ascended up on high and gave gifts
[35:49] unto men
[35:50] some apostles some prophets some
[35:52] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[35:54] and so
[35:55] this is all in god's great economy and
[35:57] so now as the scripture says
[35:59] he says as you ponder these things as
[36:01] you're in these things he says
[36:02] then you will return now when he's
[36:05] talking about returning to israel
[36:07] he's talking about their restoration to
[36:09] their inheritance
[36:10] but we can apply it to our restoration
[36:12] to our inheritance
[36:14] because we have an inheritance that adam
[36:16] lost in the beginning
[36:18] and since the inheritance was lost in
[36:20] the beginning
[36:21] that jesus said blessed are your eyes
[36:24] for they see
[36:25] blessed are your ears for they hear for
[36:28] kings and great men have desired to hear
[36:31] these things
[36:32] they desire to see the things that
[36:34] you're seeing
[36:35] you see what he's saying is they have
[36:37] pondered these things
[36:39] they have thought about these things
[36:42] they have wandered at these things but
[36:44] it wasn't for their time
[36:46] but now things are being revealed in
[36:48] your day and blessed are your eyes
[36:51] and blessed are your ears and so he
[36:53] begins to express
[36:55] that to to the disciples but but the
[36:57] scripture here says you shall return
[37:00] then then you will discern between the
[37:03] righteous and the wicked
[37:05] between him that serves god and him that
[37:07] serveth him not
[37:08] he's not saying you will discern between
[37:11] the religious and the non-religious
[37:14] catch it now he's not saying you'll
[37:16] discern between what seems good and
[37:18] what's not what's moral and not moral
[37:20] no he says you'll be discerned between
[37:22] the righteous
[37:23] i'll dwell on righteousness a little bit
[37:25] because abraham
[37:27] believed god and that it was accounted
[37:31] to him for righteousness
[37:32] is that right what is the righteous
[37:35] those that believe
[37:36] god and god accounts it to them for
[37:39] righteous when god sends his word
[37:41] in their day they believe god
[37:44] and so abraham believe god and you'll be
[37:47] able to discern god said to israel
[37:50] and now say it to us as we come to our
[37:52] inheritance
[37:53] i'm way ahead of myself but as we come
[37:56] to our
[37:56] inheritance i'll just drop this in now
[37:58] and then we'll take a loop around back
[38:00] to it
[38:01] but as we come now in these last days to
[38:03] our inheritance
[38:04] the purpose is that you can know
[38:07] who the righteous are and who the
[38:09] unrighteous are
[38:10] let's go to jesus day peter thought it
[38:13] was a good thing
[38:15] to say lord you won't suffer
[38:18] we won't let you suffer matter of fact
[38:20] we're not
[38:21] you know you talk about these med evil
[38:23] men taking you
[38:24] and and and and beating you or whatever
[38:27] more
[38:28] he says we're not going to let that
[38:29] happen we're your disciples and we're
[38:31] here to protect you
[38:32] and what did jesus say get behind me
[38:35] satan
[38:37] why because he was inspired with the
[38:39] wrong
[38:40] inspiration that was not of god
[38:43] the inspiration of god for that hour was
[38:46] that jesus was the lamb of god to take
[38:49] away the sin of the world
[38:51] that's what jesus was trying to get them
[38:53] to see the devil was trying to push
[38:55] jesus at by the disciples even to take
[38:59] the throne of david but that wasn't the
[39:01] time
[39:02] there had to be a bride first come into
[39:04] existence that would sit with him
[39:06] in his throne and so there's a
[39:09] discernment
[39:11] that must happen there must be an
[39:13] understanding that happens
[39:14] what is righteous and what is wickedness
[39:18] isn't righteousness just to do good paul
[39:20] says though i speak with tongue of men
[39:22] and angels and have not love
[39:25] i'm a sounding brass and a tinkling
[39:27] symbol though i have all faith to move
[39:29] mountains
[39:30] though i understand all mysteries and
[39:32] have not love
[39:34] he says i'm nothing sometimes we think
[39:37] oh if i could understand all mysteries
[39:39] that's righteous paul says if you miss
[39:40] this key ingredient you're not
[39:44] oh if i had faith to move mountains but
[39:46] if you miss love
[39:48] oh if i you know be careful jesus said
[39:51] you need to come to the revelation of
[39:54] what is right and what is wrong
[39:57] in god's sight amen you're with me so
[39:59] far
[40:01] so what does it mean to have a
[40:02] revelation
[40:04] of your name written in heaven
[40:09] to know rejoice that your name
[40:12] is written in heaven does it mean just
[40:15] to understand the doctrine
[40:18] that you know there's no new name
[40:20] written in heaven and we know god's
[40:22] eternal and
[40:23] and it's written before the foundation
[40:25] of the world jesus in john 17 as he's
[40:28] praying
[40:28] for the church and praying in that
[40:31] chapter he says
[40:32] he says father i will that they also
[40:35] whom now has given me
[40:37] this is verse 24 be that thou
[40:40] has given me be with me where i am that
[40:43] they may behold
[40:45] my glory which thou hast given me
[40:48] for thou lovest me before the foundation
[40:52] of the world so now jesus himself
[40:56] praying
[40:57] which of course he was the word but he's
[40:59] praying lord
[41:01] a father i'm praying understanding
[41:04] that i'm in your love before the
[41:07] foundation of the world
[41:09] amen okay so now remember
[41:12] that was jesus now paul in ephesians 1
[41:16] and verse 3 and i'm just taking this
[41:17] slowly just to kind of lay this in here
[41:20] ephesians 1 and verse 3 it says blessed
[41:23] be the god and father of our lord jesus
[41:25] christ who has blessed us with all
[41:27] spiritual blessings
[41:28] in heavenly places in christ
[41:32] according as he has chosen us
[41:36] in him before the foundation
[41:40] of the world jesus said you love me
[41:43] before the foundation of the world i'm
[41:45] praying for these
[41:47] that they may be one even as we are one
[41:50] and brother branham often goes from that
[41:53] one ship
[41:53] to where jesus says in that day you'll
[41:55] know i am in the father the father me i
[41:58] in you and you and me
[41:59] so there's a revelation in there and so
[42:02] as he's laying it out now in ephesians
[42:04] the apostle paul picking up
[42:06] he's chosen us in him in christ before
[42:09] the foundation
[42:10] of the world that we should be holy and
[42:13] without blame
[42:14] before him in love so as
[42:18] jesus prayed father i thank you that you
[42:21] loved me before the foundation of the
[42:22] world
[42:23] we can also pray father i thank you
[42:27] that you love me before the foundation
[42:29] of the world
[42:31] amen it's not something
[42:35] he didn't love you because you behaved
[42:36] yourself today
[42:39] he didn't love you because you didn't
[42:41] make a mistake today is there anyone
[42:43] like that
[42:45] did anyone not make a mistake today we
[42:47] make mistakes every day brother branham
[42:48] said
[42:49] but yet he loved us before the
[42:51] foundation of the world i always loved
[42:53] spurgeon who said
[42:54] i know that he loved me before i was
[42:56] born because i know he would never have
[42:58] loved me after i was born
[43:03] come on we all can put an amen to that
[43:05] one
[43:06] amen he didn't love you because he felt
[43:08] sorry for you he loved you because
[43:10] you're in your thought in his thoughts
[43:12] before the foundation of the world
[43:14] chosen us in him
[43:15] in love having predestinated us unto the
[43:18] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[43:20] himself
[43:21] according to the good pleasure of his
[43:24] will
[43:24] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[43:28] wherein he has made us accepted in the
[43:32] beloved
[43:33] amen we know the scripture in revelation
[43:37] 17
[43:38] talking about the beast and the great
[43:40] and it says
[43:42] the beast that thou saust was and is not
[43:45] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[43:46] pit and go into perdition
[43:48] and they that dwell on the earth shall
[43:50] wonder whose names
[43:52] were not written in the book of life
[43:55] from the foundation of the world
[43:57] when they behold the beast which was and
[44:00] is not and yet is there'll be those that
[44:02] worship the beasts
[44:03] they'll be those that worship the system
[44:05] of religion
[44:07] that is antichrist because their names
[44:11] were
[44:11] never written in the book all right
[44:15] so then we so then if we talk about
[44:17] jesus saying rejoice that your name is
[44:20] written in heaven
[44:21] then it then do we say just knowing
[44:24] those facts
[44:25] is that the rejoicing i say that's not
[44:27] the rejoicing because that's just the
[44:30] doctrine
[44:31] doctrine doesn't bring joy revelation
[44:34] brings joy all right
[44:37] doctrine if you look at the at the uh
[44:40] bride tree as brother brown talks about
[44:43] the
[44:43] cankerworm palmwarm caterpillar locust
[44:45] eating off the tree down to a stump in
[44:48] the dark ages
[44:49] one of the things that it ate off or one
[44:52] of the last things that it ate off was
[44:54] the bark and the bark was the protection
[44:56] of the tree the doctrine the church has
[44:59] doctrine the church has something that
[45:01] it knows where it stands
[45:03] we have the truth of the word of god but
[45:06] that's not our joy
[45:08] our joy is the revelation that god opens
[45:10] our eyes to because
[45:12] joy is a fruit not bark and so the fruit
[45:16] of the spirit is love joy and so forth
[45:19] so before the foundation of the world we
[45:21] were in the mind of god
[45:23] we were written in a book so to speak
[45:25] and that is when we can say the logos
[45:28] comes into view that is this time that
[45:31] god begins to manifest himself
[45:34] and we were in christ there all of the
[45:36] attributes of god were
[45:38] in christ there the logos in the
[45:40] beginning was the word the word was with
[45:43] god the word was god
[45:44] in the beginning was the logos amen
[45:48] amen the and the word the logos was with
[45:51] god the logos was
[45:53] god all that was god he poured himself
[45:56] into another form called
[45:57] the logos brother brahm says that's
[45:59] where the lamb's book of life comes into
[46:01] view
[46:02] it says that's where king theophany
[46:04] comes into you there's so many things
[46:05] that come into view
[46:07] at that time so so here we are
[46:10] manifested in this hour stay with me i
[46:12] know i'm just
[46:13] laying these little nuggets in here but
[46:15] we are manifested in this day
[46:18] as a realization now
[46:22] of the reference that god wrote back
[46:25] here
[46:26] he wrote your name there but now as he
[46:30] wrote your name here
[46:31] here you are today
[46:34] he wrote that for a reason these are the
[46:37] ones i love
[46:39] these are the ones who is in christ that
[46:41] i love
[46:42] and you become materialized here today
[46:46] hallelujah and you are the ones that he
[46:48] loves
[46:50] and you are the ones that he reveals
[46:52] himself to
[46:53] because when he wrote your name he was
[46:56] writing his
[46:57] own characteristics back then in christ
[47:01] and now in this hour we become
[47:03] materialized
[47:05] as the written reference now brought
[47:08] forward
[47:09] into the present hour amen
[47:12] all right now we're we're at the start
[47:17] as john recorded in revelation chapter
[47:19] five and i just have to
[47:21] just refer briefly to my notes because
[47:23] this is too much
[47:24] joy just to go by notes all right
[47:28] but as john come to a place in
[47:30] revelation chapter 5 that represented
[47:33] what would take place in our day
[47:35] as he was in a vision remember he was in
[47:37] a vision
[47:38] the seals were not opened in john's day
[47:40] he was in a vision
[47:41] the seals were opened in our day but
[47:44] john recorded what he saw in the vision
[47:47] to describe the thoughts of god that
[47:50] would be materialized in the future
[47:53] that's prophecy all right prophecy as i
[47:56] said before
[47:57] is the thoughts of god not yet
[47:59] materialized prediction
[48:01] is a is deduction from inspiration and
[48:04] the bible
[48:05] that it looks like this is what's going
[48:07] to happen but prophecy or the mind of
[48:10] god or the thoughts of god
[48:11] that were expressed back there must come
[48:14] to pass
[48:16] heavens and earth will pass away but
[48:18] god's word
[48:20] will never fail all right
[48:23] we all believe and understand these
[48:25] things and so when john was
[48:27] caught up into this heaven after he
[48:30] received the revelation of the seven
[48:32] church ages
[48:33] then in revelation chapter 4 the throne
[48:35] and and now revelation chapter 5
[48:37] he sees the book now come into view and
[48:40] one sitting on the throne in his right
[48:42] hand he had this book and
[48:44] and it was announced who's worthy to
[48:47] open the
[48:48] book and to loose the seals and it was
[48:50] searched through heaven and earth and
[48:51] under the earth to find one that was
[48:53] worthy and nobody was found worthy
[48:56] and so then the bible says john wept he
[48:58] did not rejoice
[49:00] he wept he was sad there was something
[49:02] about it
[49:03] that that he just felt like there needs
[49:05] to be a fulfillment and i'm not happy
[49:07] there's something in me
[49:08] welling up see a lot of times there's
[49:10] there there is
[49:12] in you things that are eternal that you
[49:14] don't even understand yet
[49:16] there were things happening to the
[49:18] disciples that they didn't even
[49:19] understand yet
[49:21] that jesus had to explain to them when
[49:23] they saw supernatural power and demons
[49:26] were subject to them they were rejoicing
[49:27] as though it was a great thing
[49:29] and jesus said don't bother rejoicing
[49:31] that's really not what you need to
[49:33] rejoice about
[49:34] but what you need to rejoice about and
[49:35] they maybe never even understood this
[49:37] statement
[49:38] you need to rejoice that your names are
[49:39] written in heaven
[49:41] now here's john one of those disciples
[49:43] that's back there
[49:44] now in a vision in revelation chapter 5
[49:47] seeing a book
[49:48] is there something about that book i
[49:50] don't think john was a super genius
[49:52] he was just recording what god showed
[49:54] him
[49:56] he's a prophet and that's what a prophet
[49:58] does a prophet doesn't figure things out
[50:00] a prophet speaks what god tells him to
[50:03] speak
[50:06] sometimes people say oh brother branham
[50:08] thought this and brother branham thought
[50:09] that
[50:10] you know i was talking to a brother
[50:12] recently about translation and
[50:14] and i he said you know people are upset
[50:17] you know
[50:18] people say this about translation and
[50:20] who has the rights to translate who has
[50:21] this
[50:22] i said i said look in the scripture it
[50:25] says the bible
[50:26] says god in sundry times in diverse
[50:27] matters spake unto us by the prophets
[50:29] but now has spoken to us by his son
[50:32] i said that son in revelation chapter 2
[50:35] in revelation chapter 3
[50:37] said to the churches he told the
[50:40] messenger
[50:42] right to the churches unto the church of
[50:45] the laodiceans
[50:46] write these things i says so whose
[50:49] message
[50:49] is it brother branham was the messenger
[50:53] he was not the author
[50:56] hello sometimes we want to put brother
[50:59] branham as the author
[51:00] he he he just spoke the things that god
[51:03] told him to speak
[51:06] amen it's thus saith the lord not thus
[51:08] saith william branham
[51:11] and so as a result he's the messenger
[51:14] that speaks it so here's john is a
[51:16] prophet
[51:16] and the isle of patmos now recording
[51:19] these things that he's being shown in a
[51:21] vision being told
[51:22] to write them down and he's catching a
[51:24] revelation this book
[51:26] and then someone's not worthy to open
[51:28] the book and he starts to weep
[51:30] and one of the elders says to john now
[51:32] john don't weep
[51:34] because the lion of the tribe of judah
[51:38] has prevailed to open the book and to
[51:41] loose the seals thereof
[51:43] and john turned to see the lion and he
[51:46] saw
[51:46] the lamb as it had been saying he saw
[51:50] christ he saw the one who was his lord
[51:53] his savior his redeemer a
[51:56] lamb that was slain in the mind of god
[51:59] before the foundation of the world in
[52:01] time
[52:02] 2000 years ago now step forward to claim
[52:05] the book
[52:06] he had made the propitiation and as he
[52:09] took the book out of the right hand of
[52:11] him let me just read it for you him
[52:13] here as he took the book and in verse 11
[52:16] it picks it up it says and i beheld
[52:19] and i heard the voice of many angels
[52:21] round about the throne
[52:23] and the beasts and the elders and the
[52:25] number of them was ten thousand times
[52:27] ten
[52:28] thousands and thousands of thousands
[52:31] what's 10 000 times 10 000 that's 100
[52:34] million isn't it
[52:35] something like that and so 100 million
[52:38] millions of angels and millions and
[52:40] millions
[52:41] saying with a loud voice now there's a
[52:43] choir for you
[52:45] hello you can be quiet tonight if you
[52:47] want to but when john redeemed the book
[52:50] there was a hundred million angels
[52:51] rejoicing
[52:53] glory to god they were shouting
[52:57] were they were saying the bible says and
[52:59] they weren't just talking
[53:01] they were saying with a loud voice the
[53:02] scripture says worthy is the lamb
[53:06] that was slain to receive power
[53:09] and riches and wisdom and strength
[53:13] and honor and glory and
[53:16] blessing hallelujah
[53:19] they were shouting they were rejoicing
[53:21] and then he goes on to say in every
[53:23] creature which is in heaven
[53:25] and on the earth and under the earth
[53:28] and such as are in the sea and all that
[53:30] are in them heard i
[53:32] saying blessing and honor and glory
[53:35] and power be unto him that sitteth upon
[53:38] the throne and unto the lamb forever
[53:41] and ever hallelujah
[53:44] what were they doing they were having a
[53:46] jubilee because now the book was
[53:48] redeemed brother branham
[53:50] picks it up in the in the third seal
[53:53] and he talks about i talk he's actually
[53:56] speaking about ruth and the kinsman
[53:58] redeemer now here in the third seal now
[54:00] third seal remembers hurting out the oil
[54:01] and the wine
[54:03] and uh michael so so
[54:06] wonderfully preached on that it says now
[54:08] so ruth was just waiting because she'd
[54:10] already labored
[54:12] she'd done all these other things she
[54:14] was waiting so he's arrived now at the
[54:16] end of the book of ruth we'll come back
[54:17] to ruth lord willing
[54:18] and then when the church is waiting
[54:20] resting many of them most of them in the
[54:22] dust of the earth while he's doing
[54:24] his kinsmen work the world's still going
[54:27] worse and sin is heaping up and sickness
[54:30] and trouble
[54:31] and death and sorrow that doesn't sound
[54:33] very exciting
[54:35] the world is in a bad shape he says the
[54:38] godless men and godless women die right
[54:40] down
[54:41] cancer eats them up and everything else
[54:43] when they can't appropriate enough faith
[54:45] to reach out there and take hold of it
[54:47] then he says he comes forth
[54:51] takes the book out of the hand of him
[54:54] and then john and everything in heaven
[54:58] the souls under the altar begin
[55:00] screaming
[55:01] we get that in the sixth seal again he
[55:03] says and how they rejoiced and
[55:05] fell down the elders and poured out the
[55:07] prayers of the saints and the souls unto
[55:09] the altar cried worthy art thou
[55:11] because you redeemed us we're going back
[55:13] to live on the earth as kings and
[55:15] priests
[55:16] he says john said everybody in heaven
[55:18] everything beneath the earth everything
[55:20] heard him praising god about it
[55:22] john must have found his name
[55:25] there hallelujah
[55:29] now maybe john could say that's what he
[55:32] was talking about
[55:35] don't rejoice that devils are subject
[55:37] unto you but rejoice
[55:38] that your name is written in heaven
[55:42] and here's john caught up in this vision
[55:44] which was
[55:45] not actually happening it was a vision
[55:47] but it actually
[55:48] happened in our day
[55:53] come on i i don't know if you understand
[55:56] this
[55:56] do you know what day you're living in
[55:59] not only have
[56:01] kings and priests desire to understand
[56:03] these things
[56:04] they've desired to live in your day
[56:07] in the day when the word becomes open
[56:10] john saw it in a vision
[56:12] and rejoiced in a vision but when you
[56:14] see in this day
[56:16] because of the open book that your name
[56:19] is written
[56:20] in heaven hallelujah
[56:23] everybody ought to hear you rejoicing
[56:27] now brother branham said the world's
[56:29] getting worse sickness is getting worse
[56:32] the the the world is going on in sin men
[56:35] and women become an evil all the time
[56:37] but john in the midst of all of that
[56:40] he was rejoicing in heaven
[56:44] because he could see his name written
[56:46] there
[56:48] hallelujah
[56:51] john must have found his name on there
[56:57] now
[57:00] in the church age book brother branham
[57:02] talks about the lamb's book of life he
[57:03] goes into a lengthy
[57:05] uh section on it in the church bro you
[57:09] can read it when you go home it's page
[57:11] 265
[57:12] to 286 of the exposition of the seven
[57:15] church ages
[57:17] and it's that's 21 pages and
[57:20] brother branham goes into the details of
[57:22] the lamb's book of life you can put the
[57:24] slides up for me if you like i thought
[57:26] i'd just go through an aspect of this
[57:27] because i wanted you to see something
[57:29] here
[57:32] obviously the reason that this is on my
[57:35] heart
[57:36] on the subject of joy is to dis
[57:39] is that the lord would show us what
[57:42] really
[57:43] brings joy and if we can see
[57:46] that then we have something to rejoice
[57:50] about amen
[57:53] and i say if we can see it i don't mean
[57:55] if we can see
[57:56] what i'm preaching tonight i mean if we
[57:59] can see
[58:00] our name on the book amen
[58:03] all right let me just talk about this
[58:05] the lamb's book of life
[58:08] now brother brown describes
[58:11] in this section here how the book of
[58:14] life
[58:15] and and the lamb's book of life it's all
[58:18] one book
[58:18] relates to four different types of lives
[58:22] here on the earth and he goes into it
[58:25] in detail and the first thing that he
[58:28] mentions or the first of the four groups
[58:30] as he goes through the four groups
[58:32] and this is all out of the church age
[58:33] book he talks about
[58:35] is the bride and he says it was god's
[58:38] purpose
[58:38] to bring forth a people like unto
[58:41] himself
[58:42] that would be a word bride it was a
[58:45] it was a purpose i said i i want to talk
[58:49] about
[58:50] maybe as we get to the end this brother
[58:53] brown talks about the armor girl
[58:55] the the armor company and the boss's son
[58:58] that went to find a wife
[59:00] and he found this girl who wasn't a part
[59:02] of the festivities
[59:04] but she was kind of just laboring in the
[59:06] camp kind of like a rebecca
[59:09] and doing the character things and and
[59:11] the one of the first things he says he
[59:13] asked her was
[59:14] do you know the purpose of why i'm here
[59:19] and you know that's really something
[59:21] that
[59:22] god comes to us to bring to us do you
[59:25] really understand the purpose of why i
[59:28] came it's not because i felt sorry for
[59:31] sinners it's not because you know i
[59:34] i just hope somebody would believe in me
[59:38] no he had a purpose it was god's purpose
[59:41] to bring forth a people
[59:43] like unto himself that would be a word
[59:46] bride she was chosen before the
[59:49] foundation of the world
[59:51] in him now i understand why i read those
[59:53] scriptures
[59:54] she was chosen before the foundation of
[59:57] the world
[59:58] in him as jesus recognized that
[1:00:01] she's to recognize that she was
[1:00:04] foreknown
[1:00:04] and beloved before she was ever brought
[1:00:08] forth during the ages upon the earth
[1:00:12] she was redeemed by his blood
[1:00:16] and can never come into
[1:00:19] condemnation oh if we could
[1:00:22] really let these individual sentences
[1:00:25] anchor in our hearts
[1:00:28] it was his purpose to have a word bride
[1:00:30] she was chosen before the world
[1:00:32] she was foreknown and beloved before she
[1:00:36] was ever on the earth
[1:00:37] put your name there you were foreknown
[1:00:40] you were chosen
[1:00:42] you're redeemed by his blood and you can
[1:00:44] never come into condemnation
[1:00:47] further he says she can never be in the
[1:00:49] judgment
[1:00:50] because sin cannot be imputed
[1:00:53] unto her hallelujah
[1:00:57] oh lord let that revelation be a part of
[1:01:00] our existence
[1:01:02] let it quicken us within our soul realm
[1:01:05] all right so he's talking about this
[1:01:06] first group that was god's purpose
[1:01:09] then after that he goes into the foolish
[1:01:11] virgin and i'll just quickly go through
[1:01:13] these other groups and come back to the
[1:01:15] bride
[1:01:16] the foolish virgin and the righteous of
[1:01:18] matthew chapter 25 he says secondary
[1:01:20] secondly there is another class their
[1:01:22] names are also in the book of life
[1:01:25] and they will come up in the second
[1:01:27] resurrection
[1:01:29] such are the foolish virgins and the
[1:01:31] righteous as are spoken of in matthew
[1:01:33] 25.
[1:01:34] all right what remember what is
[1:01:36] righteous to believe god
[1:01:39] all right in this class also are those
[1:01:41] who do not worship the beast or become
[1:01:44] involved in the antichrist system
[1:01:46] but die for their faith even though they
[1:01:49] are not in the bride not
[1:01:52] having been born again
[1:01:55] all right what are they lacking they're
[1:01:57] the foolish virgin
[1:01:58] lacking the oil but they will come up in
[1:02:01] the second resurrection
[1:02:03] and go into eternal life as you read
[1:02:06] through this section of the church age
[1:02:08] book you'll find
[1:02:09] that why do these come up in this
[1:02:10] judgment because there's nowhere else to
[1:02:12] come up
[1:02:13] the first resurrection is for the bride
[1:02:15] this resurrection at the end of the
[1:02:17] world
[1:02:18] at the white throne judgment is for
[1:02:20] everybody else we want to go into all
[1:02:22] the details on that
[1:02:23] so that's the foolish virgin virgin and
[1:02:25] the righteous
[1:02:26] then he talks about borderline believers
[1:02:30] israel in the wilderness judah etc he
[1:02:32] says thirdly there's
[1:02:33] there are borderline christians such as
[1:02:35] we saw in israel coming out of egypt
[1:02:37] these had their names in the book of
[1:02:39] life in their works written in the books
[1:02:42] they have days having failed to obey god
[1:02:45] and being
[1:02:45] void of the spirit though even the signs
[1:02:49] and wonders were amongst them
[1:02:51] will have their names removed from the
[1:02:54] book of life
[1:02:55] among this group will be ones like judas
[1:02:58] who was in that group that jesus said
[1:03:00] don't rejoice that devils are subject to
[1:03:02] you but rather that your name is written
[1:03:05] in heaven
[1:03:06] judas didn't have anything to rejoice
[1:03:07] about cain never had anything to rejoice
[1:03:10] about
[1:03:11] all right they're religious excuse me
[1:03:13] but their names are not written there
[1:03:15] amongst this group will be ones like
[1:03:17] judas who will though entirely
[1:03:19] void of the spirit but are religious
[1:03:21] will have
[1:03:22] the manifestation in their lives and
[1:03:25] though
[1:03:26] on the books were not the elected in
[1:03:29] him such also as
[1:03:32] balaam will be in that group
[1:03:35] all right so that's the third group
[1:03:37] fourth group being those that
[1:03:38] never were written in the book fourth
[1:03:41] and finally brother brown says
[1:03:43] are the ones whose names have never been
[1:03:46] or ever will be written on the books
[1:03:51] what a sad place to be but god
[1:03:55] and again we could go into the many
[1:03:57] things that brother branham brings out
[1:03:58] in this section
[1:03:59] god is sovereign he's
[1:04:03] he made the whole world he's able to
[1:04:05] make one vessel to honor
[1:04:07] and another vessel to dishonor he's able
[1:04:10] to make a moses
[1:04:11] and make a pharaoh amen god
[1:04:14] chooses the ones he will do to he will
[1:04:17] make to fulfill
[1:04:19] his purpose and he brings everything to
[1:04:22] pass
[1:04:22] according to his own glory we live in an
[1:04:26] age where people think they have some
[1:04:28] kind of say
[1:04:29] in how things happen an age of people's
[1:04:32] rights and they feel like they got some
[1:04:34] kind of opinion that's worth something
[1:04:36] let me tell you if you're listening
[1:04:37] tonight god
[1:04:39] is god he does
[1:04:42] as he chooses no man has been his
[1:04:45] counselor
[1:04:46] nobody tells god what to do god
[1:04:50] does what god will do but to the
[1:04:53] believer
[1:04:54] that's in him that's a rest because
[1:04:57] god has revealed his purpose to us
[1:05:00] god has shown himself to us so there's
[1:05:03] these four groups
[1:05:04] the bride of jesus christ is the one
[1:05:07] we're dwelling on tonight
[1:05:08] and brother branham says also in the
[1:05:10] church age book he says make no mistake
[1:05:12] about it
[1:05:13] he says a purpose a person rather that
[1:05:17] is truly baptized by the holy ghost
[1:05:19] into the body of christ receiving the
[1:05:22] full
[1:05:23] fullness of the spirit will be in
[1:05:27] the word all the way.
[1:05:31] amen god god's spirit in a believer
[1:05:36] doesn't believe
[1:05:37] anything else except the word of god
[1:05:40] that's just the reality of it amen let
[1:05:43] me
[1:05:44] let me just take a step back here i was
[1:05:46] thinking about these four groups
[1:05:49] as i was staring at this i was thinking
[1:05:51] you know
[1:05:52] those are in number from the least to
[1:05:54] the most
[1:05:56] as far as i don't have any proof of
[1:05:58] saying that i just say
[1:05:59] statistically your pride is probably the
[1:06:02] fewest
[1:06:03] and then the next fewest would be the
[1:06:04] foolish virgin and the righteous and
[1:06:06] then the next fewest would be borderline
[1:06:08] believers
[1:06:08] and the most are those that are never
[1:06:11] written in the book
[1:06:16] i am one of the few
[1:06:19] one of the few and by faith in god's
[1:06:22] word i can claim it amen
[1:06:26] in the word all the way i want to look
[1:06:29] at a couple things in
[1:06:30] in perfect faith before we finish these
[1:06:32] slides here
[1:06:33] and move on
[1:06:37] brother brown says in the message
[1:06:39] perfect faith he says
[1:06:41] now these are the are real deep lessons
[1:06:44] and i'll catch the top of it then you
[1:06:48] dig down in it
[1:06:52] not to offend anybody but if you're only
[1:06:56] listening to tapes
[1:06:58] how are you ever going to fulfill this
[1:07:02] there there are those that think the
[1:07:04] that to be in the message is only to
[1:07:05] listen to tapes
[1:07:07] you don't need preachers i'll tell you
[1:07:09] what you need the fivefold ministry
[1:07:12] you need the gifts that god put in the
[1:07:14] body to dig
[1:07:15] down into these things that a prophet of
[1:07:18] god said i'll
[1:07:19] catch the top of it but you dig down
[1:07:22] into it amen
[1:07:23] so there's wonderful truths that brother
[1:07:25] branham brings out
[1:07:27] in these things that he wants us as a
[1:07:29] church to get into the meat of it
[1:07:31] all right i'll explain that as i go on
[1:07:34] here there's a reason i say that
[1:07:37] he says in perfect faith he says now
[1:07:40] here's where many people fail to receive
[1:07:42] their healing
[1:07:43] what they're asking for because they
[1:07:45] take faith to be something that it is
[1:07:48] not
[1:07:49] they don't believe it it's not an
[1:07:51] imagination
[1:07:52] it's an actual substance
[1:07:56] now listen close see it is not what you
[1:07:59] imagine
[1:08:00] it's just as real to you as any sense of
[1:08:03] your body will declare
[1:08:05] anything else it's as real
[1:08:09] as my eye says this is a piece of paper
[1:08:14] all right so he takes a piece of paper
[1:08:16] i'll take a piece of paper this is a
[1:08:18] piece of paper
[1:08:18] you say well that's elementary brother
[1:08:20] tim but he says that's just as real as
[1:08:22] faith should be to you
[1:08:23] he says it's just as real to say that
[1:08:26] that
[1:08:26] is a light i'll say it's just as real to
[1:08:29] say
[1:08:30] that this is a pulpit it's solid
[1:08:33] now if i didn't believe it i would just
[1:08:36] walk through it but i would run into it
[1:08:41] because it's real and as real as
[1:08:44] that is is as real as faith is
[1:08:47] when a person has faith it says by his
[1:08:50] stripes i
[1:08:52] am healed they have to understand
[1:08:55] all the aspects not understand don't get
[1:08:57] me wrong i'm not trying to say
[1:08:59] intellectual understanding but they have
[1:09:00] to catch every part
[1:09:02] of that revelation by
[1:09:06] his stripes whose stripes
[1:09:09] who's the his it's the lamb that was
[1:09:12] slain for our sins that was
[1:09:15] that what that was the price the
[1:09:17] propitiation
[1:09:18] the sacrifice for our salvation and our
[1:09:21] healing
[1:09:22] that it's a twofold covenant by his
[1:09:25] stripes he was wounded for our
[1:09:28] transgressions
[1:09:29] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:09:31] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:09:33] with
[1:09:34] his stripes i am healed amen

[1:10:46] praying for him
[1:10:48] he's a man he knows what pain is
[1:10:51] he knows what it is to suffer that's why
[1:10:53] we pray for brother tom

[1:11:07] amen any man any woman that sees their
[1:11:10] name in the book says nothing's
[1:11:11] impossible
[1:11:12] with my god i was in him before the
[1:11:14] foundation of the world
[1:11:15] i was in christ in him i was in christ
[1:11:18] in him
[1:11:18] in love before the foundation of the
[1:11:21] world
[1:11:22] all of his promises are mine i'm
[1:11:24] claiming them
[1:11:25] because my name's on the book not
[1:11:28] because i'm special not because i'm
[1:11:29] superhuman
[1:11:30] not because i got some special gift
[1:11:32] matter of fact if i had a gift it
[1:11:34] wouldn't be for me anyway it'd be for
[1:11:35] the body
[1:11:37] but because i'm his my name's on the
[1:11:40] book
[1:11:41] hallelujah
[1:11:46] i'm sorry did i skip over one here he
[1:11:48] says now the only thing you have to do
[1:11:50] then
[1:11:51] is have faith in what you are
[1:11:55] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:11:58] jesus had faith in the word of god that
[1:12:01] said what he was it is written of me
[1:12:05] didn't david in the psalms and the
[1:12:07] prophets and all of them speak of him i
[1:12:09] am the bread of life that came down from
[1:12:11] god out of heaven
[1:12:12] what a testimony to stand there on that
[1:12:15] day when they're standing there saying
[1:12:16] our fathers ate manna in the wilderness
[1:12:20] jesus says i am the bread of life
[1:12:23] that came talk about a revelation he
[1:12:26] walked by perfect faith in what the word
[1:12:29] said he was he's not interested in the
[1:12:32] contradiction of sinners that he endured
[1:12:35] with
[1:12:35] day after day after day at they had an
[1:12:38] intellectual understanding of the
[1:12:39] scripture they had a
[1:12:40] they had a religious understanding by
[1:12:42] their traditions they made the word of
[1:12:44] god of no effect
[1:12:45] but he stood there and he spoke to them
[1:12:48] this is what the word says i
[1:12:50] am and it's going to come to pass
[1:12:52] destroy this temple in three days i'll
[1:12:54] raise it up again
[1:12:55] as jonah was in the belly of the whale
[1:12:58] three days and three nights so shall the
[1:12:59] son of man
[1:13:00] be in the heart of the earth what was he
[1:13:02] saying he says that word cannot
[1:13:04] fail that's speaking of me
[1:13:08] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:13:10] heaven with a shout
[1:13:12] and the voice of the archangel and the
[1:13:14] trump of god shall sound and the dead in
[1:13:16] christ shall rise first
[1:13:17] and we which are alive and remain
[1:13:22] shall be caught up with them to meet the
[1:13:24] lord in the air that's speaking of me
[1:13:28] whatever you ask the father in my name i
[1:13:31] will give it to you
[1:13:32] as speaking of me in that day you'll
[1:13:35] know that i am in the father the father
[1:13:37] me i and you and you and me
[1:13:38] i am the you in that sentence
[1:13:41] hallelujah jesus john 17 says neither do
[1:13:45] i pray for these alone
[1:13:47] but i pray for those who will believe
[1:13:49] because of their words
[1:13:51] that's me he was praying for
[1:13:54] hallelujah
[1:13:58] and it has nothing to do with how i feel
[1:14:04] it's revealed
[1:14:07] hallelujah brother michael talked about
[1:14:11] revelation stimulation of revelation
[1:14:14] touched on it last time i spoke and but
[1:14:17] stimulation of revelation there's a
[1:14:19] reason for that
[1:14:21] there's a reason it's oil and wine
[1:14:24] it's not just oil and it's not just wine
[1:14:27] oil represents the holy spirit but the
[1:14:29] wine represents the stimulation of
[1:14:30] revelation
[1:14:31] because it takes revelation to operate
[1:14:34] the holy spirit
[1:14:36] because the power of the holy spirit is
[1:14:38] bound by a law and that law is a law of
[1:14:40] faith or revelation
[1:14:42] so the wine has to go with the oil that
[1:14:44] always has to be in the church
[1:14:46] it's not just the oil say oh we had a
[1:14:48] wonderful holy ghost meeting but the
[1:14:49] revelation has got to be there to
[1:14:51] quicken the promise to you
[1:14:53] show you who you are and show you who
[1:14:55] your rights is
[1:14:57] and that the power of god is in you you
[1:14:59] claim it and walk in it
[1:15:00] and it must happen exactly the way god
[1:15:03] said it
[1:15:08] hallelujah
[1:15:10] much teaching is it more like preaching
[1:15:13] he knew that he knew with that a perfect
[1:15:16] faith that he was the anointed messiah
[1:15:21] that the spirit of god was upon him and
[1:15:24] he said now i myself do nothing
[1:15:27] but it's my faith in god and god was in
[1:15:30] him
[1:15:31] and the word excuse me the word made
[1:15:34] manifest
[1:15:35] and when the word of god comes in you
[1:15:38] it's made manifest for you are a
[1:15:41] believer
[1:15:42] see and a believer is
[1:15:46] the faith of god that moves in you
[1:15:51] let me put it in another phrase a
[1:15:53] believer is
[1:15:54] the revelation from god that moves in
[1:15:57] you
[1:15:59] because faith is a revelation faith
[1:16:01] comes by hearing hearing by the word
[1:16:04] so you are the revelation of what god
[1:16:07] showed you
[1:16:09] and it has nothing to do with how you're
[1:16:11] feeling
[1:16:14] you might come through just have come
[1:16:16] through the worst week of your life
[1:16:18] beat up drug out all kinds of
[1:16:22] situations that maybe the devil is
[1:16:25] trying to tell you how can you be a son
[1:16:26] of god but it's real to you
[1:16:28] i believe the word of god
[1:16:32] i believe it more than anything i'll
[1:16:35] tell you what that's your joy
[1:16:37] never lose that your joy and as that
[1:16:40] is real to you then you deny your own
[1:16:43] flesh
[1:16:45] you deny your own feelings and you walk
[1:16:47] by faith in the word
[1:16:49] it's like the one man i think brother
[1:16:51] biscuit even quoted at one time he's in
[1:16:53] a hole
[1:16:54] you know he says lord i'm in this hole
[1:16:55] or he says lord we're in this hole
[1:16:59] says lord it's a deep hole but he said
[1:17:00] you get out i'll hang on and we'll both
[1:17:03] be out
[1:17:05] god is with you i'll be with you even in
[1:17:08] you unto the end of the age i'll never
[1:17:10] leave you forsake you
[1:17:12] all that the father has given me will
[1:17:14] come to me those are yea and amen
[1:17:16] that's absolutely thus saith the lord
[1:17:19] god won't lose a single one
[1:17:25] is this all right tonight if it's not
[1:17:27] i'll stand alone and preach it
[1:17:29] i'll still believe it amen a believer is
[1:17:32] the faith of god that moves in you
[1:17:34] jesus lived in a world that no one
[1:17:36] knowed about he was an odd person
[1:17:39] you ever feel that way he lived in a
[1:17:41] world of perfect faith
[1:17:42] in the perfect god in which he was
[1:17:45] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:17:47] christian
[1:17:48] to what we are did you catch that
[1:17:52] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:17:54] christian to what we
[1:17:55] are we'd be a mystic to the world
[1:18:00] the people wouldn't understand you
[1:18:03] i trust you're there this was spoken in
[1:18:07] 1963
[1:18:08] or 65. i can't remember 65 maybe
[1:18:12] and and and this is now 2020. this is
[1:18:14] almost 60 years ago
[1:18:17] the church should be here are you here
[1:18:20] you ever wonder why the world doesn't
[1:18:22] understand you because you're called
[1:18:24] to be a mystic to this world
[1:18:27] they won't understand you he says the
[1:18:29] people wouldn't understand you
[1:18:32] you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit
[1:18:35] said
[1:18:35] you would do what it forbid you'd not
[1:18:39] do hallelujah you sound odd to the world
[1:18:43] you
[1:18:43] you don't fit into the realm of human
[1:18:45] emotion and sympathy
[1:18:48] you know like jesus when he was walking
[1:18:50] on the earth a mystic to the world
[1:18:52] one man says oh lord i'll come and
[1:18:55] follow you let me go and
[1:18:56] i think he said bury my dad or something
[1:18:58] and jesus said let the dead bury the
[1:19:00] dead
[1:19:02] what is that to you come and follow me
[1:19:06] what an unsympathetic man my what what
[1:19:10] no it was a different realm he was a
[1:19:12] mystic to the world this isn't about an
[1:19:14] earthly kingdom this is about a heavenly
[1:19:16] kingdom
[1:19:16] this isn't about a name written on a
[1:19:18] birth certificate in canada
[1:19:20] or united states this is about a name
[1:19:22] written on a book before the foundation
[1:19:24] of the world
[1:19:25] i'm a part of that book hallelujah i'm a
[1:19:28] part of that book
[1:19:30] you're a part of that book it's not just
[1:19:33] a
[1:19:33] book with a bunch of letters in it it's
[1:19:35] a book of the very attributes of god
[1:19:38] god revealing himself is describing what
[1:19:41] you are
[1:19:41] in him oh my let's just carry on here
[1:19:45] i'll never get
[1:19:46] where where i want to get to tonight
[1:19:48] excuse me for always looking at my watch
[1:19:50] he says you'd the people wouldn't
[1:19:52] understand you'd walk in the spirit what
[1:19:54] the spirit said you would do
[1:19:55] what it forbid you'd not do amen
[1:19:59] and that's the slides amen
[1:20:03] so the scripture we read a couple weeks
[1:20:05] ago
[1:20:06] hebrews 1 and verse 8 says but unto the
[1:20:08] son he saith thy throne o god is forever
[1:20:11] and every
[1:20:12] paul introducing christ to the hebrews
[1:20:14] the deity of jesus christ
[1:20:16] emmanuel the messiah god in flesh
[1:20:20] and he takes from chapter one to chapter
[1:20:22] seven of melchizedek to describe who
[1:20:25] jesus
[1:20:25] is and what his authority and position
[1:20:28] is
[1:20:28] that's why i always wondered you
[1:20:30] probably did too brother tom wondered
[1:20:32] maybe you already knew but why did
[1:20:34] brother branham only preach the hebrew
[1:20:36] series to chapter 7
[1:20:38] because he's just preaching the deity of
[1:20:40] jesus christ
[1:20:42] he didn't go into all the rest of it
[1:20:44] that wasn't
[1:20:45] the subject that he was preaching on but
[1:20:47] as he's preaching the hebrew series and
[1:20:49] he goes through it and that's what
[1:20:50] paul's breaking down to the church
[1:20:52] in the deity of jesus christ he says the
[1:20:55] but unto the son
[1:20:56] not angels unto the son he said thy
[1:20:58] throne o god is forever
[1:21:00] and ever a scepter of righteousness
[1:21:06] what's righteousness to believe god
[1:21:10] and it's accounted to him for
[1:21:12] righteousness that's his authority
[1:21:14] i believe god i am the bread that came
[1:21:18] down from heaven
[1:21:20] i am what the word spoke of me i am the
[1:21:23] lamb of god to take away the sin of the
[1:21:25] world
[1:21:25] that's his scepter and if he's made us
[1:21:29] kings and priests
[1:21:31] then that's your scepter too that's your
[1:21:34] right of rule that's your your
[1:21:38] instrument of authority i believe
[1:21:41] what he told me i believe what the word
[1:21:45] says about me it doesn't matter what the
[1:21:48] circumstances are it doesn't matter what
[1:21:50] the world says it doesn't matter what
[1:21:52] the government says it doesn't matter
[1:21:54] all those things
[1:21:55] what matters is what god said
[1:21:58] he says thou hast loved righteousness
[1:22:02] there it is again and hated iniquity
[1:22:06] knowing what his right to do and not
[1:22:07] doing it iniquity
[1:22:09] therefore god even thy god
[1:22:12] has anointed thee with the oil of
[1:22:16] gladness
[1:22:16] above thy fellows there's the rejoicing
[1:22:20] the gladness once again
[1:22:22] as jesus was walking in it why because
[1:22:25] he was walking
[1:22:26] with a scepter of righteousness of
[1:22:28] perfect faith
[1:22:30] in what the word said he was
[1:22:33] he had a rejoicing that nobody else knew
[1:22:35] he was anointed above his fellows
[1:22:38] he was the book of life he was the
[1:22:41] fullness of god dwelling bodily in flesh
[1:22:44] he was all in all of it and you were in
[1:22:46] him there
[1:22:48] and because you were in him there you
[1:22:51] came to be manifested now
[1:22:52] but now we've come to the hour of
[1:22:55] rejoicing
[1:22:56] where god now reveals himself to the
[1:22:59] church
[1:22:59] not as god but as bridegroom
[1:23:03] god reveals himself that way to you
[1:23:06] to bring a level of gladness that the
[1:23:10] church hasn't
[1:23:11] had till this age now bear with me
[1:23:15] this only comes to the bride i'm going
[1:23:17] to take 10 minutes to
[1:23:18] get down this road here then we'll close
[1:23:23] this level of gladness only can come to
[1:23:25] the bride
[1:23:28] because it's based on revelation and
[1:23:30] this revelation only came in this hour
[1:23:34] this is bride time this is where a
[1:23:37] prophet could say i no longer call you
[1:23:38] church i call you bride
[1:23:41] where he could say the church has the
[1:23:43] the bride has been united to him
[1:23:46] in the marriage on this side we go to
[1:23:49] the marriage supper are you with me so
[1:23:51] far
[1:23:52] so let me ask you a question you believe
[1:23:54] in him
[1:23:55] and because you believe him it imparts
[1:23:59] more joy the more you see yourself
[1:24:03] in the word the only thing that brings
[1:24:06] joy is revelation i'll say it again he
[1:24:09] says
[1:24:10] what i'm sorry the only thing that
[1:24:12] brings this joy is revelation there's
[1:24:13] other types of joy
[1:24:15] he says and then i'll say this why do
[1:24:19] you love the message
[1:24:23] why do you love the man i'm not talking
[1:24:25] about
[1:24:26] why you should love the message why do
[1:24:28] you love the message
[1:24:30] it's because you see yourself there
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:35] like john in revelation chapter 5 there
[1:24:37] was something about that book
[1:24:39] as somebody's got to redeem that book
[1:24:42] and then brother brown says when it was
[1:24:44] redeemed then john saw his name there
[1:24:46] and they created such a great rejoicing
[1:24:49] so is it when the revelation of that
[1:24:51] book the message of the hour
[1:24:54] comes to you personally it produces a
[1:24:56] rejoicing now
[1:24:58] i've got to stop here for a moment and
[1:24:59] say if you're not there
[1:25:02] you just stay in god's presence till you
[1:25:04] get there
[1:25:07] god has it for you it's it's not
[1:25:10] something that you've got to work
[1:25:11] yourself up into because revelation is
[1:25:14] sovereignly given of god
[1:25:16] god sent this message to bring you to a
[1:25:19] level of revelation
[1:25:20] and stimulation by revelation that can
[1:25:23] only be attained
[1:25:25] in the message of the hour i feel sorry
[1:25:27] for people that leave the message
[1:25:31] i just love the message
[1:25:34] i don't claim to know everything i just
[1:25:36] love it
[1:25:37] whenever i listen to a message i get
[1:25:39] something out of it
[1:25:40] whenever i read a message book i get
[1:25:42] something out of it
[1:25:43] because of the message this book became
[1:25:46] a new book to me
[1:25:48] amen because i understood it in a way i
[1:25:50] never understood it before
[1:25:52] it became personal it was no longer this
[1:25:55] is the precepts of god
[1:25:57] it's this is what my soul has always
[1:26:00] desired
[1:26:03] so the joy of the bride of christ
[1:26:07] that is comparable to the to the joy
[1:26:10] that
[1:26:10] jaw that john felt there's many joys in
[1:26:14] the bible we won't go into it
[1:26:16] but as i was thinking of this and i was
[1:26:19] thinking about
[1:26:20] how john felt i was thinking about the
[1:26:22] oil of gladness it suddenly began to
[1:26:25] dawn on me
[1:26:27] that the only comparable
[1:26:30] is the joy of a bride
[1:26:35] and brothers i hate to say it to you in
[1:26:37] the natural
[1:26:38] you have no clue
[1:26:42] because you've never been a natural
[1:26:43] bride
[1:26:45] but i sat my wife down
[1:26:49] and i said i want to quiz you here about
[1:26:52] certain things
[1:26:53] in a relationship i just preached on
[1:26:55] femininity so i felt like
[1:26:56] i can maybe go down that road a little
[1:26:58] bit and because i wanted to know because
[1:27:01] i'm not feminine i'm masculine
[1:27:04] is that okay i know which side of the
[1:27:07] street i walk on
[1:27:08] let's let's put it that way praise the
[1:27:11] lord
[1:27:12] but we need to see the feminine side to
[1:27:15] see this joy
[1:27:17] because don't laugh at me
[1:27:21] it's the joy of ruth when naomi showed
[1:27:25] her
[1:27:25] the true interest of boaz
[1:27:29] that he will not rest till all things be
[1:27:31] fulfilled
[1:27:33] it's the joy of esther to know the place
[1:27:37] she held
[1:27:38] in the kingdom it's the joy of the
[1:27:42] armored girl
[1:27:44] that she as she begin to discover as
[1:27:47] brother brown describes that
[1:27:49] in the third seal or the sixth seal i
[1:27:51] think it is he describes that
[1:27:53] and and he as he begins to describe this
[1:27:57] uh this girl who felt she was nothing
[1:28:01] and then discovered she had obtained the
[1:28:05] interest
[1:28:06] of the man that everybody wanted to
[1:28:08] marry
[1:28:11] it brought something in her and it
[1:28:13] brought something out of her
[1:28:14] and i'll say it this way it's the joy of
[1:28:17] weakness
[1:28:18] in finding its strength
[1:28:23] what does it mean for a woman i had to
[1:28:25] ask my wife
[1:28:26] now these are not her thoughts i asked
[1:28:27] her certain questions so that i could
[1:28:29] discern
[1:28:30] from those questions so don't worry i'm
[1:28:32] not telling you what my wife told me
[1:28:33] i'm telling you about the general
[1:28:35] picture here
[1:28:38] so firstly sisters
[1:28:42] you can pull a little bit on this all
[1:28:44] right firstly
[1:28:45] there's the joy of anticipation
[1:28:50] boy meets girl girl meets boy
[1:28:54] all of a sudden events in life
[1:28:58] take on a new meaning
[1:29:01] because the girl who grew up thinking
[1:29:04] about
[1:29:05] one day being married or being swept off
[1:29:08] her feet by night in shining armor or
[1:29:10] whatever way you want to turn
[1:29:10] return it now it's like is this the time
[1:29:15] so now there's an initial joy of
[1:29:17] anticipation
[1:29:20] and maybe mixed with that
[1:29:23] some possible trepidation what if
[1:29:27] what if it isn't real what if it isn't
[1:29:31] true
[1:29:32] what if it doesn't work out
[1:29:35] what if it doesn't happen the way i
[1:29:37] thought it would happen
[1:29:39] what if i don't know the real hymn
[1:29:42] now that's the natural i'll go to the
[1:29:44] spiritual just in uganda
[1:29:47] just this last week there was a meeting
[1:29:49] in uganda
[1:29:50] brother stephen o'bally was introducing
[1:29:53] the message
[1:29:54] to 25 methodist ministers
[1:29:59] the pentecostals heard the message the
[1:30:01] baptist heard the message now the
[1:30:02] methodists are
[1:30:03] hearing the message i got the video
[1:30:05] you'll see the video on the website in
[1:30:07] the near future
[1:30:09] now as he's talking to them and
[1:30:12] preaching them they had heard the radio
[1:30:13] broadcast that we had sponsored they had
[1:30:15] listened to it
[1:30:16] and so they wanted to hear in person the
[1:30:19] things of this message and they wanted
[1:30:20] to ask questions and so they were
[1:30:22] gathered together they weren't allowed
[1:30:24] to have church so they're kind of
[1:30:25] outside
[1:30:27] socially distanced you would say and and
[1:30:29] and sitting and listening to brother
[1:30:30] stephen preach
[1:30:32] and at the end of it all they they
[1:30:34] confessed
[1:30:36] this is the truth and we need to be
[1:30:39] baptized
[1:30:40] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:44] but there became now some trepidation
[1:30:49] well if we embrace this message what
[1:30:52] happens
[1:30:53] to the buildings we currently occupy
[1:30:56] if we believe the message what will take
[1:30:59] place
[1:31:00] see i'm speaking like paul tonight i
[1:31:03] i show you a mystery but really i'm
[1:31:05] speaking about christ and the church
[1:31:07] i'm not just speaking about a woman
[1:31:09] that's finding love
[1:31:11] i'm speaking about christ in the church
[1:31:13] when you first became a christian
[1:31:15] or what if what will my family say
[1:31:18] what will my friends say what will my
[1:31:22] my what will my business associates say
[1:31:24] what will happen to my wait what about
[1:31:26] my job what about
[1:31:27] this what about my ambitions what about
[1:31:29] all these things brother stephen gave
[1:31:31] these myths
[1:31:32] these ministers good advice don't worry
[1:31:35] about
[1:31:35] that now whatever will happen
[1:31:39] will happen but you just need to embrace
[1:31:43] the truth so they experience the joy
[1:31:48] of their great anticipation of coming
[1:31:51] into the light of the word
[1:31:52] then comes the next stage of
[1:31:54] relationship of the joy of getting to
[1:31:56] know the person we call it
[1:31:58] courtship and uh you may be
[1:32:02] you're able to now talk with the person
[1:32:05] the
[1:32:05] the little girl the young lady is able
[1:32:08] to maybe
[1:32:08] have conversation brother branham even
[1:32:10] said about the armor girl you know
[1:32:12] he kept in touch with her he kept
[1:32:14] talking to her over time maybe sending
[1:32:16] letters whatever it would be in that day
[1:32:18] and
[1:32:18] and so she was expecting him to come to
[1:32:21] the marriage she was expecting him
[1:32:23] for that certain time and and other
[1:32:25] people didn't really know about it
[1:32:26] but she was getting to understand him
[1:32:29] and so it is
[1:32:31] in the believer as christ begins to
[1:32:34] reveal himself to you
[1:32:36] you begin to understand him more you
[1:32:39] begin to see
[1:32:40] yourself a little bit more in his eyes
[1:32:43] and the talk becomes deeper about the
[1:32:46] meaning of life
[1:32:47] and then it becomes the hopes and the
[1:32:49] dreams and the ambitions
[1:32:51] and where is he going in other words try
[1:32:53] beginning to catch his purpose
[1:32:56] are you with me so far and so all of
[1:32:58] these things now the woman begins to see
[1:33:00] is the is he really the right one for me
[1:33:03] the joy begins to build
[1:33:05] are you with me there there's another
[1:33:07] level of joy here in the courtship as
[1:33:09] they begin to
[1:33:10] as brother brown would say their hearts
[1:33:12] begin to beat as one
[1:33:14] and they begin to understand each other
[1:33:16] and so
[1:33:17] so if he if he does it right i remember
[1:33:19] a young man coming to me
[1:33:21] for one of my daughters and and and
[1:33:24] wanted to court her and i i said you
[1:33:25] know
[1:33:26] well what are you doing for a living i
[1:33:28] kind of already knew he says well
[1:33:30] he says i'm delivering pizza
[1:33:33] and i said well what's what's your
[1:33:35] objective he says well i don't know
[1:33:38] i said well that ain't gonna cut it
[1:33:42] see and i said you better find yourself
[1:33:43] a trade or something and
[1:33:45] and to his credit he did he went out got
[1:33:48] a trade
[1:33:49] became in a position where he could
[1:33:51] raise a family and provide for that
[1:33:53] family and god bless them for that
[1:33:54] and all those things so that so there's
[1:33:56] this stage of getting to know and then
[1:33:58] after that
[1:33:58] comes the joy of engagement and that's
[1:34:01] really where the church has been through
[1:34:02] seven
[1:34:03] church ages is the joy of engaged
[1:34:05] engagement the betrothed the commitment
[1:34:08] of life together but not yet life
[1:34:11] together
[1:34:12] the questions should be over the that
[1:34:15] now is the time to relax
[1:34:17] it's kind of like ruth uh resting now
[1:34:20] for boaz who as he said i will i will do
[1:34:23] that what you've asked me to do and
[1:34:25] she's resting and naomi is explaining to
[1:34:27] her he will not rest till all is
[1:34:29] fulfilled and
[1:34:30] and so on and so so forth the decision
[1:34:32] is made
[1:34:33] to be forever joined together brother
[1:34:35] branham says about engagement she's your
[1:34:37] wife but you're not
[1:34:38] married yet all right and that's the way
[1:34:41] the church was
[1:34:42] through seven church ages they were the
[1:34:44] betrothed but now
[1:34:46] in the last days now we
[1:34:49] come to the great time because nothing
[1:34:53] beats the joy of marriage
[1:34:57] oh i didn't get very many amens i
[1:34:59] thought you'd say amen to that one
[1:35:00] brother tom
[1:35:01] not not he did say amen such a joy and
[1:35:05] i'm just giving a rough time
[1:35:07] nothing beats the joy of marriage
[1:35:08] there's other joys
[1:35:10] but nothing beats the joy of marriage my
[1:35:11] wife told me it's the best day
[1:35:14] of her life and whether you believe me
[1:35:16] she said that or not that's up to you
[1:35:19] but she did say it it's the happiest
[1:35:22] most
[1:35:23] joyous day and i thought it was
[1:35:26] interesting because
[1:35:28] as i begin to pull out of her the
[1:35:30] emotions of a woman
[1:35:32] in going because i know how i felt and
[1:35:35] maybe i knew a little bit about how she
[1:35:36] felt
[1:35:37] but i began to ask certain questions as
[1:35:39] i studied it
[1:35:40] but there becomes and you married
[1:35:42] couples can
[1:35:43] can fellowship with me on this there
[1:35:45] becomes a relaxing
[1:35:48] of being able to give yourself
[1:35:50] unreservedly
[1:35:51] and trust him
[1:35:55] more than there ever was before
[1:35:58] so now i'll speak about it in the church
[1:36:00] in the opening of the word
[1:36:03] there is a relaxing and a greater trust
[1:36:07] that is
[1:36:07] built up in christ than ever has been
[1:36:10] down through the church ages praise be
[1:36:13] to god
[1:36:14] now parents are nice we all appreciate
[1:36:17] parents
[1:36:17] but the joy of the one that loves you
[1:36:21] who had now becomes the only authority
[1:36:25] becomes a great thrill in the woman's
[1:36:27] life as brother bradham describes it
[1:36:30] in the church age book under the key of
[1:36:32] david as he says under the marriage
[1:36:34] ceremony he says
[1:36:35] no other man no other power
[1:36:38] has any right or authority over that
[1:36:41] woman but
[1:36:42] he the bridegroom alone hallelujah
[1:36:46] now i'm saying all this to say this that
[1:36:49] this woman now begins to realize a part
[1:36:51] of her
[1:36:52] life that she never we could realize
[1:36:54] before
[1:36:55] because while entering into the bonds of
[1:36:57] matrimony
[1:36:58] it is actually freedom
[1:37:02] by coming a bond slave to christ it is
[1:37:05] actually freedom it is actually
[1:37:09] a liberty from all the things that
[1:37:12] restrain you
[1:37:13] from being who you were called to be
[1:37:17] now you are loose to fully manifest what
[1:37:20] christ has put in you before the
[1:37:23] foundation of the world
[1:37:25] hallelujah and i
[1:37:28] i love this statement this one my wife
[1:37:30] did make she made a few others but i
[1:37:32] this one she did me she says after
[1:37:34] marriage
[1:37:35] life becomes a new book
[1:37:41] oh saints brother brown said after the
[1:37:44] opening of the seals
[1:37:46] this become a new book hallelujah
[1:37:51] this become a new book and when god
[1:37:53] reveals himself
[1:37:54] what's the opening of the seals it's
[1:37:56] revealing to you
[1:37:58] your name that's written in heaven
[1:38:01] hallelujah
[1:38:03] that brings a rejoicing in the church
[1:38:06] that she sees her name which was written
[1:38:09] in heaven
[1:38:10] now revealed because the lamb has tore
[1:38:13] back the seals
[1:38:14] the lamb has revealed the mystery
[1:38:17] it's like you found the answer to
[1:38:21] your life hallelujah
[1:38:24] rejoice not of the things that happen in
[1:38:27] this physical realm
[1:38:28] whether devils are subject to you or not
[1:38:31] whether
[1:38:32] whether sickness strikes you or not it's
[1:38:35] you have the victory anyway
[1:38:37] whatever happens in this natural realm
[1:38:39] don't just rejoice there that's a
[1:38:40] certain level
[1:38:41] but rejoice that your name is in him
[1:38:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:47] you always were in christ jesus
[1:38:50] every promise in the book always was
[1:38:53] yours
[1:38:54] there never was a time it didn't belong
[1:38:56] to you you just had to come to the
[1:38:58] realization
[1:39:00] it's all paid for it's already yours as
[1:39:04] the musicians come let's close this
[1:39:06] service
[1:39:07] it's already belongs to you brother
[1:39:10] branham says
[1:39:11] in the sardisian age in that same
[1:39:13] section actually the last paragraph of
[1:39:15] the sardisian age
[1:39:18] he says once more the spirit is spoken
[1:39:20] once again we have reviewed the record
[1:39:21] of what the spirit has said to another
[1:39:23] age
[1:39:24] and we have found the record correct
[1:39:26] another age has gone by
[1:39:28] and it was fulfilled exactly as he said
[1:39:30] it would be what a consolation for us
[1:39:32] this is to us to who hoped to be
[1:39:36] in the last day bride for it
[1:39:39] causes our hearts to leap for
[1:39:42] joy that he is faithful and
[1:39:46] will perform his every promise
[1:39:50] hallelujah when you see your name it
[1:39:54] causes your heart to rejoice
[1:39:56] and say he is faithful i might be weak
[1:40:00] i might be be miserable i might be
[1:40:04] the least of all the saints i might be
[1:40:06] the least in the body of christ
[1:40:08] but if i'm the skin on the bottom of his
[1:40:10] feet i'm still
[1:40:11] on the head of satan hallelujah
[1:40:15] i found my name in the book oh let's
[1:40:18] stand together
[1:40:19] i want to sing that song it was a great
[1:40:21] thing that he did for me it's a flat i
[1:40:23] think
[1:40:25] oh it was a great thing when you see it
[1:40:28] when john
[1:40:29] saw the book being redeemed it's not
[1:40:32] just an
[1:40:32] event of the last days it's not just a
[1:40:35] lord help me it's not just a
[1:40:37] a mystery that's made known even though
[1:40:39] it is mysteries that are made known but
[1:40:41] it's not just that
[1:40:43] it's the fulfillment of his redemptive
[1:40:46] purpose
[1:40:47] and a revealing of it to his bride this
[1:40:50] is you
[1:40:52] this is you praise god this is me
[1:40:55] hallelujah i am that bride
[1:40:59] i am that people it's got nothing to do
[1:41:01] with my mistakes
[1:41:04] i was waiting for that quiet spot i'll
[1:41:07] say it again
[1:41:07] it's got nothing to do with my mistakes
[1:41:11] because with the devil would have bind
[1:41:13] you up by your own
[1:41:14] humanity and as long as we're
[1:41:18] in this humanity we will make mistakes
[1:41:21] that's why we make mistakes because this
[1:41:24] body
[1:41:24] is not yet redeemed but we are of them
[1:41:28] that crucify the flesh
[1:41:30] we are of them that deny and renounce
[1:41:32] the things of the flesh
[1:41:33] even the flesh that tells me you have to
[1:41:35] suffer no i have been redeemed
[1:41:38] it was a great thing that he did for me
[1:41:40] can i have the words please
[1:41:42] the lord has brought
[1:41:47] my soul
[1:42:12] me
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:45] seems too old for me
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:07] when i'm

[1:46:57] tearing the seals back so that you could
[1:47:00] see yourself
[1:47:01] in the book no longer a sealed book
[1:47:05] not just the bible but the eternal book
[1:47:07] the eternal
[1:47:08] redemptive purpose of god all that he
[1:47:12] had in his mind made
[1:47:13] known through the scriptures now made
[1:47:16] known
[1:47:17] you are what it's all about hallelujah
[1:47:20] you're not just a church
[1:47:22] you're not just betrothed anymore you've
[1:47:24] come into union with the word
[1:47:27] that you could have a joy that no one
[1:47:30] else knew let's bow our heads together

[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:43] jesus walked by perfect faith in that
[1:47:46] word
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:48] nobody could rob jesus of his joy
[1:47:54] you are the word that's been called to
[1:47:56] manifest in this age
[1:47:59] that's what the mysteries have been that
[1:48:01] have been revealed
[1:48:03] to show us who we are oh praise be to
[1:48:06] god
[1:48:07] what a revelation unlike any other
[1:48:11] revelation it's not a churchianity
[1:48:15] it's not a greater holiness it's not a
[1:48:19] extreme puritanism it's a reality of a
[1:48:22] relationship with jesus christ
[1:48:25] that goes back before the garden of eden
[1:48:29] that's the reality if you're here
[1:48:33] tonight as our heads are bowed our eyes
[1:48:34] are closed whether here or somewhere
[1:48:36] else
[1:48:37] you haven't entered into this
[1:48:39] relationship that's there for you
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:44] why did you just say lift your hand lift
[1:48:47] your heart whatever you feel
[1:48:49] yourself why don't you as we pray you
[1:48:51] just commit yourself to christ
[1:48:54] say lord take me beyond earthly thinking
[1:48:58] let me become a mystic to the world
[1:49:01] fill me with your word until joy
[1:49:06] and a peace that passes all
[1:49:07] understanding moves through my life
[1:49:11] heavenly father as we
[1:49:14] as we struggle in this world
[1:49:17] [Music]
[1:49:18] lord when you are on the earth the
[1:49:21] scripture records
[1:49:22] that you endured the contradiction of
[1:49:26] sinners or you endured
[1:49:28] the unbelief that was constantly being
[1:49:31] hurled at you
[1:49:32] but you stood in the word standing for
[1:49:36] what the word said you are
[1:49:38] lord as we stand in these last days
[1:49:43] lord i was reading about the little girl
[1:49:46] that brother branham talked about
[1:49:48] the young lady that was betrothed to the
[1:49:52] rich man's son and how that lord she
[1:49:56] forgot her wedding garments ready
[1:49:59] and lord the others snickered at her
[1:50:03] they laughed at her they tried to tell
[1:50:06] her
[1:50:06] it's not like you think it is but she
[1:50:10] believed
[1:50:12] and he came for her at the appointed
[1:50:15] time
[1:50:16] the world is trying to tell the bride
[1:50:18] it's not like you think it is
[1:50:20] but we believe lord the church
[1:50:24] might say all these people in this
[1:50:26] so-called message they don't know what
[1:50:28] they're talking about
[1:50:29] but we believe lord we've seen your
[1:50:32] vindication
[1:50:34] we've seen what you sent us and we
[1:50:37] believe
[1:50:38] there might be a few out of all those
[1:50:41] that are in the book
[1:50:43] but lord we're the few that are waiting
[1:50:45] with our
[1:50:46] garments unsoiled by the world washed in
[1:50:50] the water of the word
[1:50:52] quickened by the power of your
[1:50:54] resurrection
[1:50:55] standing in the strength that is yours
[1:50:57] alone
[1:50:58] though we are weak your strength is made
[1:51:02] perfect in our weakness
[1:51:04] we commit our lives to you we commit
[1:51:06] this service to you
[1:51:07] we ask lord you go with us now as we go
[1:51:10] our way
[1:51:12] as we go to our homes as the people turn
[1:51:15] off their
[1:51:16] their internet connections lord and
[1:51:18] ponder the things that you have spoken
[1:51:20] tonight
[1:51:21] may it strike a deep resonating cord
[1:51:24] within their heart
[1:51:26] that they are the one that you are
[1:51:28] coming for
[1:51:29] they're that one that you sent this
[1:51:31] message for
[1:51:32] they're the one that you're revealing
[1:51:35] unveiling yourself to
[1:51:36] we commit each one to you lord we ask
[1:51:38] your blessing now
[1:51:40] upon each life may you just go with each
[1:51:42] one
[1:51:43] may your faith drop into each heart may
[1:51:46] sickness flee away
[1:51:48] may sorrow and mourning flee away o god
[1:51:52] lord may the heaviness of the world flee
[1:51:54] away o lord

[1:51:58] you've given to your bride
