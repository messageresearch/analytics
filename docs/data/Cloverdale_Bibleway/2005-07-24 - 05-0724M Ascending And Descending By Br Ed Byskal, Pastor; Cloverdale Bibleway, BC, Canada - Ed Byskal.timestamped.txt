[10:56] Ask brother Roy Florent. Brother Roy, if
[10:58] you'd come, open the service in a word
[11:01] of prayer. We've got uh some needs that
[11:04] we want to remember this morning, and I
[11:07] know there are many here, I'm sure, who
[11:10] have needs that they want to be
[11:11] remembered.
[11:13] Um, we got a testimony
[11:16] from uh David Iverson.
[11:20] Remember that his wife had a very
[11:22] serious uh stomach infection, was taken
[11:25] to the hospital just after they arrived
[11:28] here. And um
[11:33] since the saints prayed on Sunday night,
[11:35] she sat up in bed and now she is
[11:38] completely healed.
[11:40] Thank the Lord for his healing power and
[11:42] the saints for their prayers. Amen.
[11:48] Testimony from our sister sacred said,
[11:50] "We'd like to thank and glorify our Lord
[11:52] for being faithful and true. remember we
[11:56] uh including my that uh we prayed for uh
[12:00] sister Cigarett's sister Margot because
[12:03] on June 30th they learned that uh she
[12:06] was diagnosed with cancer and that had
[12:08] already uh metastasized in her body and
[12:11] they just want to thank the congregation
[12:13] for their prayers and support. On July
[12:16] the 3rd the congregation prayed for her
[12:18] complete healing and salvation. The week
[12:20] of July 4th, my sister went through
[12:22] extensive specialized cancer testing to
[12:25] locate the source of the cancer. All the
[12:27] tests returned negative.
[12:30] Says with the exception of the Amen.
[12:34] Praise God.
[12:38] It said with the exception of the blood
[12:39] count test which remains high, the
[12:41] doctors are perplexed because they can't
[12:44] find any cancer.
[12:46] My sister believes the Lord has healed
[12:47] her. She appears tender toward the Lord.
[12:50] Just wants to give praise and thanks.
[12:52] And we want to continue to pray for her
[12:54] salvation. Amen.
[12:57] And uh
[13:01] Brother Frank Fletcher is requesting
[13:03] prayer for his neighbor who was taken to
[13:05] the Langley Hospital with an unknown
[13:07] sickness. His name is Dick Page. He's
[13:10] requesting that we pray for his recovery
[13:12] and especially for his salvation. Want
[13:14] to thank everyone for their prayers for
[13:15] my dad. He just continues to grow weak.
[13:18] But you know, we were over there last
[13:19] night. He wasn't in any pain. He said he
[13:21] was uh yesterday he said or I guess it
[13:24] was yet uh on Friday. He said uh heard a
[13:29] the doorbell ring and uh someone
[13:34] door open and he said it was like he had
[13:37] a vision and uh he said it was a very
[13:39] large man. He said he just said I've
[13:41] come to take Len home.
[13:44] and uh he said, "I've seen the man
[13:45] before. He's my angel." So, we're just
[13:49] uh thankful for those little things and
[13:51] dad's not in any pain. So, we're just
[13:53] thankful for that and uh continue to
[13:56] appreciate your prayers.
[13:58] Uh if you've got a need this morning and
[14:00] would like to have it remembered before
[14:02] the Lord, you just lift your hand. If
[14:03] you're listening in on the internet, and
[14:05] I know we have many people are listening
[14:06] on the internet, you just if you've got
[14:08] a request, you just take it before the
[14:10] Lord now as we come before brother Roy.
[14:13] [Music]
[14:19] Hallelujah.
[14:21] [Music]
[14:23] Our loving heavenly father,
[14:26] we thank you once again for another
[14:28] opportunity to be gathered here this
[14:31] morning in the house of God to worship
[14:34] the true and living God this morning.
[14:38] Already, Father, we've felt your
[14:39] presence here this morning, oh God. And
[14:43] we want to welcome your spirit, Lord. We
[14:45] want to give you all the praise and all
[14:47] the glory that you truly deserve. For
[14:50] you're a God. You're a mighty God who
[14:53] dwells in the praises of your people
[14:56] this morning, Father.
[14:59] Oh loving heavenly father, where would
[15:01] we be without you in our lives, Lord?
[15:04] Where would our lives be without the
[15:06] presence of God and without this
[15:08] message, this word which you have sent
[15:10] us from your eternal glory, Father.
[15:14] So this morning, we've come to return
[15:16] praise with our lives, oh God. Not just
[15:20] in an appearance this morning, but we've
[15:23] come to make love to you this morning.
[15:25] We've come to give you our life, Father.
[15:27] We come to exalt you. We come to worship
[15:30] you. We come to praise you, Father. For
[15:34] there's no one who is truly as worthy.
[15:37] There's no one who's truly as deserving.
[15:39] Lord, to whom can we lift up our voice
[15:42] this morning, Father, who can hear us
[15:45] when we pray but thee alone. For this
[15:48] morning, Father, you have come, oh Lord,
[15:50] to hear and to be in our presence this
[15:53] morning. So we want to thank you,
[15:55] Father. We want to thank you with all of
[15:58] our hearts this morning. We want to
[16:00] thank you, Lord, for all the goodness
[16:02] and mercy that you've showed to us
[16:04] throughout the years. We want to thank
[16:06] you for the mercy you showed yesterday.
[16:08] Lord, we want to thank you for the mercy
[16:10] that you've showed today, Father. We
[16:13] want to thank you for the mercy that
[16:15] you've sent before the foundation of the
[16:17] world, oh God, that we would be chosen
[16:20] to be your children in this end time.
[16:25] Oh God, we bring this request of brother
[16:27] Frank Fletcher before you for his
[16:29] neighbor. We ask that oh God that you
[16:31] will reach down into this man's life, oh
[16:34] God, and that you would touch not just
[16:36] his body, but you would touch his soul
[16:38] this morning. For the body will perish,
[16:41] but the soul is worth 10,000 words to
[16:44] you, Lord.
[16:46] Touch him and raise him up for thy glory
[16:48] and thy honor. We pray, Lord. We thank
[16:51] you for the for the testimonies, Lord,
[16:54] that has come and how you've answered
[16:56] prayer, Father, for Brother Iverson's
[16:59] wife, Father. We just want to give you
[17:00] praise. We just want to give you glory,
[17:03] Father, for you're a mighty God of
[17:04] healing, Lord. You've healed her, and we
[17:07] want to thank you, Lord Jesus.
[17:10] Lord, we thank you for Sister Cigarett's
[17:12] testimony on behalf of her sister. Lord,
[17:17] not even cancer can stand in the
[17:19] presence of the prayer of the bride this
[17:21] morning.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; There's no demons that can stand in the
[17:26] presence of the children of God.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; So we thank you this morning, oh God,
[17:31] for that mighty testimony, Lord. And we
[17:34] pray, oh God, as you've healed her body,
[17:36] you'll heal her soul, Lord, and bring
[17:38] her to the perfect knowledge of our Lord
[17:40] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[17:44] Father, this morning I do have a prayer
[17:46] request on behalf of my boss. Oh God.
[17:49] Lord, you know I've lived a life and a
[17:51] testimony before him. And this morning,
[17:54] oh God, he is in the balance and he is
[17:57] wanting. I pray almighty God that you
[18:00] will reach down in this hospital bed
[18:02] right now and touch Gary. Father, raise
[18:06] him up, oh God, for your glory. the Lord

[18:12] that God has raised him up, Father, and

[18:17] soul, Father, and you shall receive the
[18:20] glory and the honor. We pray, Father.
[18:23] So, we claim his healing this morning,
[18:25] Father. We pray anything that is out of
[18:28] order will be put back in order. And

[18:51] children. We pray for the peace that
[18:53] you've given him. We thank you for the
[18:55] rest that you've given him, Father. And

[23:54] service tonight in the fellowship room,
[23:57] uh can't use the chapel because it's
[23:59] under some renovations right now. Uh
[24:01] after the evening service, um
[24:05] and um
[24:08] just so everyone knows the camp dates,
[24:11] junior camp, Sunday, August the 7th,
[24:13] starts at 3:00. We're going to have a
[24:15] Sunday morning service. There's no
[24:16] evening service on Sunday, August the
[24:19] 7th, because junior camp starts that
[24:21] afternoon. It ends a Wednesday, August
[24:24] the 10th in the morning. Senior camp
[24:27] starts Wednesday, August the 10th in the
[24:29] morning and goes through to Sunday,
[24:31] August the 14th after the Sunday morning
[24:34] service. So, we're going to have
[24:36] Thursday service that week, no Wednesday
[24:38] service, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[24:41] Sunday morning, no service Sunday night.
[24:45] So, uh any questions? Um talk to one of
[24:49] the brothers. Uh but I think that should
[24:52] answer most question uh most questions
[24:54] as well. All right.
[24:58] [Music]
[25:07] Do you know how it feels to know
[25:10] something's missing and hear a still
[25:13] small voice that you just keep
[25:15] dismissing? Do you know how it feels to
[25:19] be troubled inside? To think just for
[25:22] you on a cross someone died. Do you know
[25:26] how it feels when he knocks to
[25:29] surrender? Have your sins washed away.
[25:33] Never to be remembered and know that
[25:36] it's real. Tell me, do you know how it
[25:40] feels?
[25:44] How does it feel to know you're a child
[25:48] of the king? Your heavenly father owns
[25:52] everything.
[25:54] How does it feel to know you are loved
[25:58] by the one who created the stars up
[26:02] above?
[26:04] How does it feel to know you're all
[26:07] right when you lay your head on your
[26:10] pillow each night and know that it's
[26:14] real? Tell me, do you know how it feels?
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Do you know how it feels when your cold
[26:25] heart has melted and tears started
[26:28] flowing the moment you felt him? Do you
[26:31] know how it feels to know you've been
[26:35] changed? And it seems that the whole
[26:37] world has been rearranged.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know how it feels? Wherever you
[26:44] wrong, you still get that feeling.
[26:47] You're not at home knowing heaven is
[26:51] real. Tell me, do you know how it feels?
[26:58] How does it feel to know you're a child
[27:02] of the king? Your heavenly father owns
[27:07] everything.
[27:08] How does it feel to know you are loved
[27:12] by the one who created the stars up
[27:16] above?
[27:18] How does it feel to know you're all
[27:21] right when you lay your head on your
[27:24] pillow each night and know that it's
[27:28] real? Tell me, do you know how it feels?
[27:35] How does it feel to know you're a child
[27:39] of the king? Your heavenly father owns
[27:44] everything.
[27:45] How does it feel to know you are loved
[27:49] by the one who created the stars up
[27:53] above?
[27:54] How does it feel to know you're all
[27:58] right when you lay your head on your
[28:01] pillow each night and know that it's
[28:04] real? Tell me, do you know how it feels?
[28:12] And you know that it's real. Tell me, do
[28:15] you know how it feels?
[28:21] [Music]
[28:23] [Applause]
[28:34] Praise God.
[28:38] Song is going through my mind this
[28:39] morning. I just want to take a little
[28:41] bit of time to shout glory, glory,
[28:43] glory. Why don't we sing that? We're
[28:45] going to turn the service to brother Ed.
[28:46] Now, do you know how it feels?
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Why don't we stand together?
[28:54] Let's start with the first verse.
[28:58] Well, the whole world's broken in
[29:01] darkness,
[29:02] but he gave us light to see.
[29:07] The whole world's broken in darkness,
[29:11] but he gave us light to see.
[29:16] Well, the whole world's broken in
[29:18] darkness,
[29:20] but he gave us light to see.
[29:25] Imagine how he loves you and me.
[29:33] Amen. I just want to take a little bit
[29:37] of time to shout glory. Glory. Glory.
[29:42] Lord. I just want to take a little bit
[29:46] of time to shout glory.
[29:50] Oh Lord. I just want to take a little
[29:54] bit of time. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[30:01] Glory. Glory
[30:04] [Music]
[30:09] to the station
[30:12] for home. God get ready to leave. Oh,
[30:20] morning for home. God
[30:23] get ready to leave.
[30:26] Praise the creation
[30:30] of God. Get ready to leave
[30:36] the whistle always.
[30:44] I just want to take
[30:47] time
[30:50] for it. Oh Lord, I just want to take a
[30:55] little bit of time.
[30:58] Glory, glory, glory, Lord. I just want
[31:02] to say
[31:05] time. Glory, glory, glory.
[31:11] Glory, glory, glory.
[31:14] You
[31:19] just want to take a little bit of time.
[31:23] You got the glory. Glory.
[31:26] Oh, I just want to take a little bit of
[31:31] time. You got the glory, glory, glory.
[31:41] Glory, glory, glory,
[31:45] glory, glory, glory to
[31:55] [Music]
[31:56] &gt;&gt; glory.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; We're here to praise him.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; While we have breath, let's give him all
[32:05] the praise and the honor. He's worthy.
[32:08] Is there anyone else that's worthy? No.
[32:10] He's the only worthy one.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So glad to have you here this
[32:15] morning and all that are joined with us
[32:18] on the internet. We just want to say God
[32:20] bless them. God bless us all together.
[32:23] Amen. Uh Brother Rod made some
[32:26] announcements and I have a couple more
[32:28] that I just will make while you're still
[32:30] standing. Uh the the junior camp is
[32:34] going in on the August the 7th. So,
[32:37] we're having that one service Sunday,
[32:39] August the 7th, and the junior camp
[32:42] commences that day. And then, as as has
[32:45] been announced, Brother Ron Spencer will
[32:48] be our camp speaker and be speaking four
[32:52] services, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[32:54] and Sunday. You know, I think that it's
[32:58] more than us just getting up and making
[33:00] an announcement
[33:01] and all the preparation
[33:04] brother Spencer has taken. He's taken a
[33:06] week this next week. He's taken the
[33:08] whole week just to prepare himself and
[33:12] become uh physically. He wants to be
[33:15] alert and physically strong. And a a
[33:19] minister puts a lot into a meeting. A
[33:23] lot into a meeting. And uh sometimes we
[33:26] ponder subjects for a long time, then we
[33:29] study them and wait on God. And often it
[33:32] doesn't come out exactly as we had
[33:35] intended. You know, we thought it and
[33:38] then God comes in the last minute and
[33:40] says, "No, he wants it arranged a
[33:42] certain way." And and I I was coming to
[33:44] the pulpit and been studying and waiting
[33:47] on God for a certain message to you this
[33:50] morning. And it just became changed
[33:52] around. You know, God changes things the
[33:55] way he wants to do it. And so, uh,
[33:59] Brother Paul Franos and I were just
[34:01] having a few words last night and and he
[34:03] made a comment and I I thought I'd pass
[34:05] it on with your with your consent or
[34:08] without your consent, Brother Paul.
[34:12] But he said you know uh when you
[34:14] brethren come you you have studied and
[34:18] you have prayed and and God has spoken
[34:20] something direct to your heart to the
[34:23] people and you have prepared yourself to
[34:26] deliver that. He said the thing that he
[34:28] feels is that you know the people and he
[34:32] was speaking of he himself but I think
[34:33] it goes for everybody needs to take the
[34:37] same kind of interest and the same kind
[34:40] of of of uh concern and you and and
[34:45] sincerity to prepare yourself to come
[34:48] and hear it.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[34:51] &gt;&gt; I believe that makes meetings entirely
[34:54] different. So let's come not just to the
[34:56] camp meetings. Camp meetings are special
[34:59] because people come with a special
[35:01] expectation. They come ready. They come
[35:04] more prepared. But let's do it in every
[35:06] service.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Every time you intend to come to church,
[35:09] just be ready. Amen. And spend some time
[35:12] preparing for it. So I'm sure Thursday,
[35:15] August 11th, and Friday the 12th,
[35:17] Saturday the 13th, and Sunday the 14th,
[35:19] which will be just one service at the
[35:21] camp, and they will be great times. Then
[35:24] we have brother Zephaniah Peters from
[35:26] Tanzania. He was in Ohio in the meetings
[35:29] when I was there. And brother Zephaniah
[35:33] and and ourselves have been close for
[35:35] very many many years. Uh I think the
[35:38] first time he was here he stayed with uh
[35:40] brother David and sister Violet Laws at
[35:42] their place and they have a room uh you
[35:45] know they had made a room especially for
[35:47] hospitality and he stayed there for
[35:48] about 3 weeks I think and uh I don't
[35:51] know whether he's younger than brother
[35:52] David or older than brother David but
[35:55] because of the because of the way he was
[35:58] cared for he called him mom and dad mom
[36:01] and pop I think something like that. So,
[36:03] Brother Zephaniah will be with us. He's
[36:05] coming on August the 25th. So, we will
[36:08] not That's Thursday. He will we will not
[36:10] have a Wednesday service on the 24th.
[36:14] Uh and there will be no Wednesday
[36:16] service on the 17th, which is the
[36:17] Wednesday immediately after camp because
[36:19] we're just pulling out of camp. And
[36:21] there'll be no Wednesday service on the
[36:22] 24th. There will be a Friday service on
[36:25] the 26th with Brother Zephaniah Peters.
[36:29] And then he'll be with us on Sunday, the
[36:31] following Sunday. Uh the 24th, I'm
[36:34] sorry. Um that's the he's coming on the
[36:38] 25th,
[36:39] which is Thursday. We have a Friday
[36:41] service the 26th, 27th, 28th, Sunday the
[36:44] 28th. So now I know that you're confused
[36:47] and we're
[36:49] but we'll be announcing those as we go
[36:51] along. Uh I want uh I want to sing He'll
[36:54] do it again. So brother Ron, if you can
[36:56] help me. I some of these courses I can't
[36:58] quite get the timing exactly right and
[37:01] this is one of them. But I want to say
[37:02] he'll do it again.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same today
[37:06] &gt;&gt; as he was yesterday
[37:09] &gt;&gt; and same as tomorrow.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing it as we get ready
[37:14] for the word now. He'll do it again.
[37:21] He'll do it again.
[37:26] If you just take a look at where you are
[37:30] now and where you have been
[37:36] as
[37:39] you
[37:41] may now
[37:45] [Music]
[37:48] may not know when I do it again.
[37:55] He'll do it again.
[37:58] [Music]
[38:00] He'll do it again.
[38:05] Just take a look at where you are now
[38:10] and where you have been.
[38:14] He always comes through for you. He's
[38:19] the same now as
[38:24] you may not know how. You may not know
[38:28] it, but you do it again. You may not
[38:32] know how.
[38:33] You may not know how. You may not know
[38:37] it, but do it again.
[38:43] You may not know how. You may not know
[38:47] it. I'll do it again.
[38:54] Hallelujah.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we are now going to
[39:02] open the book, your word, the Holy
[39:05] Scriptures, the infallible word of God.
[39:09] We approach you as the author. We ask
[39:12] that your Holy Spirit will take the full
[39:15] control, have the preeminence upon
[39:18] speaker, upon hearers alike. We trust
[39:23] you. You are our only source, oh God.
[39:27] There's no one else we can turn to. You
[39:30] are our beloved lover of our soul. Lord,
[39:34] we are your bride. You are the
[39:36] bridegroom.
[39:38] And more than that, oh God, we believe
[39:41] the hour is even now when the lamb's
[39:44] wife has come on the scene. Lord Jesus,
[39:46] we pray that you will bless what is now
[39:49] to be said. And may I be silent where
[39:52] you would be silent and speak where you
[39:54] would speak in the name of Jesus Christ.
[39:57] Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; I'll have you take your Bibles and turn,
[40:01] please, to John the 3 chapter.
[40:06] We'll read verses 11
[40:10] through 15.
[40:15] I have been speaking on the
[40:19] uh rapture
[40:21] out of the last four services that
[40:24] brother Brandham spoke. And uh this may
[40:28] not sound as though it ties in at first,
[40:30] but it most definitely does. So I would
[40:33] like you just to uh bear in mind the
[40:36] last services that I have been speaking
[40:38] as God would refresh your memory in the
[40:43] third chapter starting with verse 11.
[40:46] Verily verily I say unto thee we speak
[40:50] that we do know and testify that we have
[40:54] seen and you receive not our witness. If
[40:58] I have told you of earthly things, and
[41:01] you believe not, how shall you believe
[41:03] if I tell you of heavenly things, and no
[41:07] man hath ascended up to heaven, but he
[41:10] that came down from heaven, even the son
[41:13] of man which is in heaven. That's where
[41:17] brother Brham said, that takes an
[41:18] inoculation.
[41:21] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[41:23] the wilderness, even so must the Son of
[41:26] Man be lifted up, that whosoever
[41:29] believeth in him should not perish, but
[41:33] have eternal life.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[41:37] seats.
[41:43] Now, you'll
[41:45] need to do some thinking.
[41:49] Uh I can say that the word and the this
[41:52] subject has been very very
[41:56] heartaching to myself and so I'm wanting
[42:00] desiring by God's help to have you as a
[42:04] congregation
[42:06] uh journey with me through my own
[42:08] experience the thing that I'm
[42:10] experiencing. And when I say that
[42:13] perhaps you see things in a different
[42:15] light just from a different direction
[42:18] than we have perhaps in the past. Uh
[42:22] everybody has a different background. I
[42:25] think all of us have been touched,
[42:28] affected, influenced one way or another
[42:31] by uh church thought, religion and the
[42:36] religious views or the understanding or
[42:40] denominational views of the scripture. I
[42:42] believe that there's just you know
[42:44] threads of that that uh follow through
[42:47] there. We have we all have an
[42:49] upbringing. Even some of the you is
[42:53] maybe we're not in a religious home but
[42:57] we hear things about Jesus and about his
[42:59] life and uh you know about Christmas and
[43:03] his birth and about Easter and his
[43:04] resurrection. And so we all have some of
[43:07] that in us and it may not always be uh
[43:11] accurate. In fact is in all likelihood
[43:13] it's not accurate.
[43:16] uh our physical
[43:19] and material world that we live in and
[43:22] our physical life which we have
[43:26] is perhaps our greatest uh stumbling
[43:29] block to understanding
[43:32] spiritual things in the scripture. And
[43:35] one of the reasons I say that is because
[43:38] as creatures of time everything for us
[43:41] has a beginning and an ending. Anything
[43:45] of any consequence in our lives has a
[43:48] beginning and an ending. And it's it's
[43:52] difficult for us to you know always be
[43:56] in contact with that kind of a world and
[44:00] be living and measuring everything
[44:02] having everything relative to time and
[44:05] and distance and so on and then be
[44:08] stepping on a Sunday morning or in your
[44:11] reading or you're hearing of the
[44:13] scripture and and and uh pursuing you
[44:17] know spiritual thoughts in the message
[44:19] and realize that God is timeless. And
[44:22] that's very difficult for us to
[44:24] understand. God is timeless. There is no
[44:27] distance with him.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; I'm leading up to something now. And
[44:32] because there's no distance with him,
[44:34] there's no such a thing as up or down.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; God doesn't come down in the sense of
[44:42] distance.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't go up. There is no
[44:46] descending and ascending.
[44:48] Even though it's in the scripture, but
[44:50] not in the sense of up and down in
[44:53] direction because you know uh up to us
[44:57] here isn't up on the other side of the
[44:59] world to begin with and and down is not
[45:02] the same. It's it's God can't know
[45:05] distance in that respect. We're we're
[45:09] timebound,
[45:10] gravity bound, humanbound
[45:14] creatures and our minds become bound.
[45:17] But we they need to be loosed from that.
[45:20] So we we that's why some of the
[45:22] scriptures become almost irreconcilable
[45:24] to us because it says one thing one time
[45:27] says another thing at another time. And
[45:29] so I'm saying these things just as a as
[45:33] a a beginning to some of the comments
[45:38] this morning which I trust will be
[45:41] provoking for you and and cause you to
[45:43] think uh deeper along these subjects
[45:46] because the key subject is the rapture.
[45:49] We we want to depart this place. But the
[45:53] departure is not so much a geographical
[45:56] change as I've been saying over the last
[45:59] three four services. It is first and
[46:02] foremost a a a changing. We need to be
[46:06] experiencing something different in our
[46:08] relationship with God. Our relationship
[46:12] draw me nearer nearer nearer. But there
[46:14] are many songs which we sing which are
[46:17] about you know heaven. I'm going to go
[46:18] up beyond the clouds and beyond the blue
[46:20] and all of that. And that may well be. I
[46:23] I I'm not here to really comment on
[46:25] that. But God doesn't know so much about
[46:28] distance.
[46:29] It's not so much about distance. In
[46:31] fact, as the prophet says that we're
[46:35] going to live the same life
[46:37] as we do now.
[46:40] It's it's just a continuation of the
[46:42] same life after death, but it's in
[46:45] another place.
[46:47] say it's in another place. We can say
[46:49] another realm. We can say another
[46:51] dimension. But I just want to go into
[46:53] the scripture in this regard. And Jesus
[46:56] made this uh
[46:58] uh amazing statement uh when he spoke
[47:01] and said, "And no man hath ascended up
[47:04] to heaven, but he that came down from
[47:07] heaven, even the son of man which is in
[47:10] heaven."
[47:12] Paul said in Ephesians, "He that
[47:14] descended is the same also that ascended
[47:18] up far above all heavens." So now, not
[47:22] into heaven, but far above all heavens,
[47:25] that he might be that he might fill all
[47:28] things. I will suggest to you that the
[47:31] filling of all things is what Paul is
[47:34] referring to, that he was above heavens.
[47:37] He's higher. Brother Brandham says he
[47:39] was made so high,
[47:42] not in distance,
[47:44] but he said he was made so high that he
[47:46] has to look down to see heaven.
[47:50] I told you you were going to think. But
[47:52] if we get our minds locked that, you
[47:54] know, the earth is here and the heaven
[47:55] is here and Jesus somewhere up there.
[47:58] No, it's it's it's it's another realm.
[48:00] Let's say for example, you know, when
[48:02] when we're children,
[48:05] we know uh very little about things.
[48:08] We're full of questions. How does that
[48:10] work? And you know, you that are
[48:11] parents, you've had children just drive
[48:13] you crazy with questions because they
[48:15] want to know. But that's how they learn.
[48:18] And actually, mentally, they're gaining
[48:21] they're they're ascending mentally in
[48:23] their knowledge of things. They're
[48:25] ascending and and physically they become
[48:28] stronger and so on. They they're going
[48:30] through an ascension in that sense of
[48:32] the word. Spiritually, we are not you're
[48:35] not where you are
[48:37] where you were where where you are
[48:40] today. It's not where you were some
[48:42] years ago. Some of you groveling in sin
[48:45] and darkness and bound by habits of life
[48:49] and and and Satan just making uh havoc
[48:54] of your life. And now now life comes
[48:57] into control and God takes charge of
[49:00] things. It it's it's an ascension in
[49:02] that sense. You've risen up from that
[49:05] place. And so I want to I'm just getting
[49:08] your minds in that direction
[49:11] revealing the scripture says, "Can any
[49:14] hide himself in secret places?" This
[49:17] Jeremiah 23:24,
[49:19] "Can anyone hide himself in secret
[49:22] places that I shall not see him?
[49:25] saith the Lord, do not I fill heaven and
[49:30] earth, saith the Lord. So the scripture
[49:34] is really full of accounts, a number of
[49:37] accounts which I'm going to refer to
[49:39] today where God has is revealing himself
[49:43] in various degrees at various levels to
[49:47] his own which he purposed or elected for
[49:51] that moment or for that season. Now
[49:55] in the scripture when Jesus was here
[49:58] revealing because he was the fullness of
[50:00] the godhead bodily he was revealing the
[50:03] invisible God. Is that not what the
[50:04] scripture says? He was revealing the
[50:07] invisible God. That was the purpose. All
[50:09] right. Now he spoke to the multitudes.
[50:12] The Bible says
[50:14] then there were other times when he drew
[50:17] 70 and brother Van calls them uh that
[50:19] ministers which he ordained called 70.
[50:23] And then there were times when the Bible
[50:26] says he took the 12 and he spoke
[50:29] different things to the 12 than he spoke
[50:31] to the multitudes. Now this is now he's
[50:34] making uh he's making distinction
[50:38] between the people his followers. And
[50:41] then there were multitudes that left
[50:43] him. The 70 also left him. And finally
[50:46] Judas left him. And you'll find Jesus
[50:48] just with the 11. And he speaks just
[50:52] with them. Then there are times when he
[50:54] takes just three, Peter, James, and
[50:56] John. He takes them up. And what's he
[50:59] doing? He actually leaves the 11 at the
[51:01] bottom of the mountain and takes the
[51:03] three up to the top. They were
[51:06] designated by Almighty God for a special
[51:09] visitation. They were the ones that saw
[51:12] the trans the transfiguration. None of
[51:15] the others saw it. Peter, James, and
[51:17] John saw it. It was designated for them.
[51:20] Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; So God even in the re revealing of
[51:23] himself, he is showing that there's a
[51:26] certain order. There's a certain
[51:28] selection and he ordained some to see
[51:30] things and others perhaps don't see it.
[51:33] But that's all God's in God's program.
[51:36] And then when it came to a very very
[51:38] critical time where Jesus said, "One of
[51:41] you is going to betray me." And Peter
[51:44] wanted to know who it was. Now as as
[51:47] mighty an apostle as Peter was, he did
[51:50] not feel the intimacy that John had.
[51:55] John called the beloved apostle, the
[51:59] beloved disciple. And so
[52:03] Peter says to John, "Ask him who it is."
[52:08] And John asked the Lord who it was. And
[52:11] Jesus told John who it was. John told
[52:14] Peter who it was. And then they knew who
[52:16] it was. See? And so now I just gone down
[52:19] from the multitudes to one that laid his
[52:21] head on his bosom. And and there there
[52:24] was that at that time in the revelation
[52:26] of Jesus Christ. And in today, I'm not
[52:30] making I'm not making uh uh uh this
[52:33] isn't some major doctrine, but so that
[52:35] you can see immediately that the rapture
[52:39] is for a few. The rapture is for some
[52:44] that are going to enter into it.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Not all will, but the rapture is for a
[52:49] number of people. And I want to believe
[52:51] that you have been called by a messenger
[52:54] voice and that that is the rapture call.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Now, as I said a moment ago,
[53:05] I I want to go through a series of of
[53:08] scriptural accounts when God came down.
[53:12] And there is a theme here that I would
[53:15] like to have you bear in mind. And that
[53:18] is in most instances, not all, but in
[53:21] most instances when God came down,
[53:27] that man was lifted up. When God came
[53:31] down, there was that reciprocal action.
[53:34] When God came down, when God moved into
[53:38] man's realm, man was lifted up in one
[53:42] way or another or whatever. God. There
[53:44] was a reaction to that action.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Now,
[53:50] Brother Brandham said, "In Christ, the
[53:51] mystery of God revealed," and I'm
[53:54] largely laying foundation. I could just
[53:56] bust out and preach right now, but I'm
[53:58] restraining myself. He said, "The first
[54:00] thing that God wanted, we all have
[54:04] wants,
[54:05] but God wanted to reveal himself."
[54:08] That's what God wanted to do. That's
[54:10] what God wants to do today and that's
[54:12] what God will do tomorrow. He has that
[54:15] desire to reveal himself. I trust you
[54:17] have the desire that he will make
[54:19] himself known to you personally.
[54:22] He wanted to reveal himself to the
[54:24] people. But he couldn't do it as the
[54:27] great Jehovah God who covered all space,
[54:32] time, and eternity. He couldn't do it.
[54:37] And he said he could not. He's too great
[54:40] to ever be revealed to people because it
[54:44] would be too mysterious. How can we
[54:48] understand God fills all time and space?
[54:51] He's here. He's on the other side of the
[54:52] earth. He's on He's at the outer fringes
[54:55] of the universe. If there is such a
[54:56] thing, he fills all time and space. How
[54:59] do you understand that kind of a God? He
[55:01] can't go up. He can't go down. He fills
[55:04] all time. There isn't any yesterday.
[55:05] there is no tomorrow because it's all
[55:07] present with God. We can't grasp that.
[55:10] But that God, that being and he is a
[55:14] he's the only God there is.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; He's not a series of gods. He's not a
[55:19] trinity of gods. He's not a multiplicity
[55:22] of gods. He is the God.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; He's a God who chose Abraham. He's a God
[55:28] who created a nation out of him and
[55:30] called it Israel. He's a God of Abraham,
[55:32] Isaac, and Jacob. He's a God who has
[55:35] selected Jerusalem. He's a God who
[55:38] called the apostles. He's a God who uh
[55:41] gave birth to the church. He's a God who
[55:43] has led the church all down the years.
[55:45] He's a God who sent all the messengers.
[55:48] He's a God who ordained them. He's a God
[55:50] who gave them the message. He's a God
[55:53] even though it was martyrdom all kinds
[55:55] of resistance and the world was opposed
[55:58] and kings was opposed and popes was
[56:01] opposed and princes was opposed the
[56:03] message could not be stopped because it
[56:06] was God behind it
[56:08] &gt;&gt; and God wanted to be revealed
[56:12] &gt;&gt; and it couldn't be revealed in some
[56:14] mysterious way. He was not going to have
[56:16] man stop him.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; He would have nations stop him and
[56:20] nothing can stop this message. Hey,
[56:22] they've tried to stop it for for a long
[56:25] many many years right now and it only
[56:28] increases in its intensity and the
[56:31] people in their maturity.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And there's no dark corner that it won't
[56:37] go to.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Not because of our efforts, not at all.
[56:42] Because it's God.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; God is behind it.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; And he wanted to be revealed, but it
[56:48] would be too mysterious.
[56:50] He said, "How could that great being
[56:53] that never did begin
[56:56] that after you went beyond the s cycle
[56:59] of hundreds of billions and trillions
[57:02] and trillions of years of light space?"
[57:05] Now, Brother Brandham, I'm scientific at
[57:07] this point. Years of light space. He's
[57:11] talking about trillions and trillions of
[57:14] years of light space. Light traveling at
[57:17] 186,000 miles a second. how far it goes
[57:20] in an hour and in a year and in a 10
[57:23] years and a trillion years you do not
[57:27] have the capacity to even grasp that
[57:31] &gt;&gt; and so it would be too mysterious. So
[57:34] because it would be mysterious, God has
[57:36] chose uh other ways to do so.
[57:40] He said God is in his universe. He said
[57:42] God is just like air. He fills all the
[57:46] universe. Just saying these things so
[57:48] that I want to impact your mind with it
[57:52] sounds like it's saying the same thing
[57:53] but it's coming from different
[57:54] directions. No matter what size, he said
[57:57] in another message here ye him. No
[57:59] matter what size the circle is or how
[58:01] many people's gathered together, Christ
[58:04] is omnipresent.
[58:06] And he's the only being that there is
[58:08] that's omnipresent. The devil can't be
[58:12] omnipresent.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; God is the only one who's omnipresent.
[58:18] I'm glad I'm going to rejoice this
[58:20] morning that the devil isn't
[58:22] omnipresent.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; God is omnipresent.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:29] He's everywhere and he fills the heaven
[58:33] and the earth. And then the message hear
[58:35] ye him. He said he's so big that he
[58:38] fills all the space and yet will become
[58:42] so small that he will come to a poor
[58:45] lost sinner's heart. That makes him
[58:49] great.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll come to one today that
[58:52] doesn't know him. He'll come to one
[58:54] individual. He'll come to a child that
[58:58] prays with a heart of faith. Isn't that
[59:00] marvelous? He loves to do that.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; And in paradox, he said, "Now, it was a
[59:07] paradox when God caused a woman to
[59:10] conceive. It was a paradox that how God
[59:14] the eternal that fills all time and
[59:18] eternity could come down and become one
[59:21] little baby crying in a manger.
[59:25] Amen. Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; We can't grasp that, but I believe it.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And then God identified in his
[59:34] characteristics.
[59:36] Notice please because I'll be coming to
[59:39] this subject in the coming services.
[59:42] Identified. God identified
[59:45] by his characteristics.
[59:48] He said to the 70. Now he makes
[59:50] reference to the 70. The 70 sitting
[59:52] here, his ministers. he'd ordained, he
[59:55] had ordained to go out and preach before
[59:58] him. And he said, uh, he said, "I'll
[1:00:01] give them a shake and see where they're
[1:00:03] at." Now, he ordained these ministers,
[1:00:04] but now he says, "Now, I'm going to give
[1:00:06] them a shake and see where these
[1:00:08] ministers are at." He said, "What will
[1:00:11] you say when you see the Son of Man
[1:00:14] ascending up into heaven from whence he
[1:00:16] came?" And they said, now notice,
[1:00:21] the son of man ascending into heaven.
[1:00:25] Now he's he's pulling out from their
[1:00:27] minds their question.
[1:00:30] We fished with him.
[1:00:33] We lay on the river banks with him. We
[1:00:36] ate with him. Now you want your minds
[1:00:39] really quickened. He's actually speaking
[1:00:41] of himself also.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; They fish with me.
[1:00:46] They laid on a riverbank with me.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; But they knew do they know who it is?
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Is it is it just a man that went through
[1:00:56] a a school
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; in Kentucky to seventh grade? Or are
[1:01:00] they really getting who it is?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Not the flesh man, but who it is that's
[1:01:05] speaking.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "We fish with him. We eat with
[1:01:09] him. We've seen the manger where he was
[1:01:12] born. We've seen the picture where the
[1:01:15] cabin where he was born.
[1:01:18] We know his mother, his brothers,
[1:01:22] and this son of man ascending up from
[1:01:25] where he come. He come from Nazareth.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; This is a hard saying.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; They walked away too. They said, "We
[1:01:34] can't see this. We can't see this." They
[1:01:37] could see him. They could see the
[1:01:38] manger. They could see where he come
[1:01:40] from. They knew. They could see his
[1:01:41] father, his mother, his parents, or and
[1:01:44] see his brothers, sisters, but they
[1:01:45] couldn't say who it was.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the dividing line
[1:01:51] right there, friends. That's the
[1:01:53] dividing line. You say, "Well, I see a
[1:01:55] prophet or I I see a good preacher or I
[1:01:58] see signs. I see wonders." That's not
[1:02:00] enough.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What happened?" Never move
[1:02:08] the disciples. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; They couldn't explain it and neither can
[1:02:12] I.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it, but you can
[1:02:16] rejoice in the fact that you can explain
[1:02:18] it. The disciples couldn't explain it.
[1:02:20] We can't explain it, but we can believe
[1:02:23] it because God has put something in here
[1:02:25] that causes us to believe.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He said, but in a paradox, he said, but
[1:02:34] real genuine faith don't move.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't move them.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; He says those disciples couldn't explain
[1:02:42] it, but they could they could but they
[1:02:45] knew there it was.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It has to be something that
[1:02:50] God planted. Hallelujah. As I speak to
[1:02:53] you this morning, I'm confident that I'm
[1:02:56] speaking to a people that God has
[1:02:58] planted something within you to believe
[1:03:01] a word you cannot explain.
[1:03:04] And that is foolishness to the world.
[1:03:06] But it's wisdom to God.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; I have a people that can believe me.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Abraham could not explain how his wife
[1:03:14] was going to be pregnantated and have a
[1:03:16] child in her old age, but he believed it
[1:03:19] anyway.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And he he denied the deadness of Sarah's
[1:03:24] womb and the deadness of his own body.
[1:03:27] And God attributed that as the
[1:03:29] resurrection to him.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Something that God planted and it had to
[1:03:39] be his thoughts before the foundation of
[1:03:42] the world when he planned the whole
[1:03:44] redemption redeeming in Ephesians 1 and
[1:03:48] 1:5. Throughout the scripture, we have
[1:03:51] this uh we have so many accounts of the
[1:03:54] descending of God at certain times and
[1:03:56] in certain places. And I want and to
[1:04:00] specific people. And so I want to just
[1:04:02] now begin with this. You follow along
[1:04:05] closely. To ascend according to
[1:04:08] Encyclopedia Britannica is to go or move
[1:04:11] upward rising upward.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And an ascendant.
[1:04:18] An ascendant is someone that is superior
[1:04:22] or the place of supreme power and
[1:04:25] preeminence. And to descend is to pass
[1:04:29] from the upper to the lower part.
[1:04:33] To lower oneself, to pass from the
[1:04:36] general to the particular. To pass, this
[1:04:40] is descending. To pass from the general,
[1:04:42] the great God that could not be grasped,
[1:04:47] that could not be understood, that could
[1:04:49] not be explained, came down. The
[1:04:52] general.
[1:04:54] The general. Not as in the army, but
[1:04:55] just the general description. God.
[1:04:58] People say God.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; God is referred to millions of times a
[1:05:02] day. God. But who is he? But when it
[1:05:05] comes down to the particular that it was
[1:05:08] Jesus Christ, then they couldn't grasp
[1:05:10] that. That God is in a prophet. They
[1:05:12] couldn't grasp it. So they slew them.
[1:05:15] When the great God, he said God was so
[1:05:17] mysterious, they couldn't grasp that.
[1:05:19] And he said the Jews when Jesus was
[1:05:22] there and that Jesus was speaking to
[1:05:24] them saying I and the father are one
[1:05:26] those people believed in the great God
[1:05:29] of Israel. They all believed in God in
[1:05:31] the general. But when it came down to
[1:05:34] the particular they couldn't grasp that
[1:05:37] descending.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; descending. They couldn't grasp that
[1:05:45] descending.
[1:05:53] He said, "Now it was a paradox when God
[1:05:56] caused a woman to conceive." I mean, on
[1:05:59] the same subject,
[1:06:02] how the great and eternal God that fills
[1:06:04] all time and eternity could come and
[1:06:06] become a little baby. They could not
[1:06:09] grasp the descending
[1:06:13] and things that are to be.
[1:06:16] See, I I speak it and then I want to
[1:06:18] give it in a quote. It was easy. He
[1:06:22] said, it was easy
[1:06:24] for those Jews who had been taught
[1:06:28] through generations. And I want to say
[1:06:30] to you sitting here today,
[1:06:33] listen to me close. There are some
[1:06:35] things that are easy for you to believe,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; but those easy things will not
[1:06:43] necessarily lead you in the right
[1:06:46] direction.
[1:06:48] Easy. It's easy to believe there's a
[1:06:50] God.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, something wrong
[1:06:53] with you mentally. It's easy to believe
[1:06:56] that Jesus Christ came and was a
[1:06:59] historical figure. Those things are
[1:07:01] easy. Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; It's easy to believe he was born. Easy
[1:07:05] to believe. It's easy to believe that he
[1:07:07] died. It's easy to believe that he was
[1:07:09] resurrected because God did it. But then
[1:07:12] to believe that to see and identify God
[1:07:16] right here and now.
[1:07:19] As I was saying to the people at brother
[1:07:20] Roy Shrewsbury's church, brother
[1:07:22] Brandham, he gets talking uh out of Luke
[1:07:25] 24, which is the second from his last
[1:07:28] service, modern events made clear by the
[1:07:32] prophecy calling Luke the prophecy. I'm
[1:07:34] going to be harping on this quite a bit
[1:07:36] that all these last four God he said uh
[1:07:39] and there he is walking with the two
[1:07:42] disciples on the way to Emmas. And the
[1:07:44] prophet declares to the people who are
[1:07:46] listening to them, that same Jesus that
[1:07:50] walked with them then is here tonight
[1:07:54] doing the same thing.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; It was easy to believe it as a
[1:08:00] historical fact, but it's another thing
[1:08:02] to believe he's here now exactly the
[1:08:06] same. Exactly the same brother Roy as he
[1:08:09] was back then. Not one bit different.
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; If you can believe it,
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; they couldn't believe it. The people he
[1:08:18] was talking to couldn't believe it
[1:08:19] because they were encrusted.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; They were encrusted with their
[1:08:24] denominational theories and doctrines.
[1:08:27] And they could not believe that that
[1:08:29] same Jesus Christ was there that very
[1:08:32] time. And I have to say that same one
[1:08:34] that was there that night when he was
[1:08:36] preaching is exactly here this morning
[1:08:39] as well. The same one Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; So you can go home and read Luke 24.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus walked with the two men to Emmas.
[1:08:51] But I'm going to say to you that this
[1:08:53] morning on the authority of that word,
[1:08:54] on the authority of his prophecy that
[1:08:56] you're walking,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; you're walking with him. And you're
[1:09:00] exactly like them. You don't know it.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; You don't know who walked with you
[1:09:07] today.
[1:09:09] And maybe you mumbled all about your
[1:09:10] problems and your difficulties and the
[1:09:13] trials of life and all the rest of it.
[1:09:16] And he, you know, and said, "These are
[1:09:18] strange things. I have strange things
[1:09:19] happening to me. I mean, I would think
[1:09:21] that things would go different if I was
[1:09:22] really a believer. And here's a here
[1:09:24] here's the Lord Jesus Christ saying,
[1:09:25] "What things?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; What things?"
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; And you're pouring out all your woe and
[1:09:30] everything else upon him. He's the same
[1:09:33] one.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He cannot be any different.
[1:09:36] He cannot change one iota. He's the
[1:09:39] same. Jesus Christ the same yesterday.
[1:09:42] Say it.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And today
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Are we in the forever?
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; We're in today.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; He's the same.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; That is what this word says.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; The same.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; The same in character. The same in
[1:09:59] desire.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; If you can believe it,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; great things will happen for you. If you
[1:10:06] can believe it,
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; if you can believe that if you've got
[1:10:09] them back there, that's easy.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; That's easy. If you can read, when you
[1:10:15] learn in grade 1 and grade two, you
[1:10:17] learn to read, you can read Luke 24.
[1:10:20] That's easy. But to believe that that
[1:10:22] same one
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; resurrected is walking now here today
[1:10:28] with you, that's what will change it.
[1:10:32] To believe that this is Sunday, that's
[1:10:35] easy. To believe that this is Cloverdale
[1:10:37] Bible Way, that's easy. To believe that
[1:10:39] I'm Brother Ed Bisc, that's easy. To
[1:10:42] believe you are who you are, that's
[1:10:44] easy. But to believe that this God,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, that this God come down
[1:10:52] today, not yesterday, today, and is
[1:10:55] walking with you.
[1:10:58] That's a different subject.
[1:11:01] And that takes more than these two eyes.
[1:11:04] That takes more than these two ears.
[1:11:06] That takes more than this body. That
[1:11:08] takes the Holy Ghost
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; coming down into the regions of the
[1:11:12] soul.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; And giving you a vision.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a conviction
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; that no one can rip it out of you.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But to think, they said they
[1:11:33] knew this great God. But to think, for
[1:11:36] them to think that this God,
[1:11:39] that that God had come down
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; and was manifesting himself
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; through the person, that great general
[1:11:49] God had come down in the particular.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; That's that's always the problem. When
[1:11:56] the when that which is in general in
[1:11:59] reference becomes particular.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; The bride is a masterpiece that's
[1:12:06] general. We say amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; The bride is manifest in the end time.
[1:12:13] Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; The bride is an absolute flawless
[1:12:17] masterpiece in the hand of the
[1:12:19] sculpture. We say amen. I'm a member of
[1:12:23] the bride of Jesus Christ. And we get a
[1:12:25] few less. Amen.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Then we say, I am a masterpiece.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Now it becomes particular.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Now the general has become particular.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not here speaking in
[1:12:41] generalities.
[1:12:43] We're not here. It doesn't do any good.
[1:12:45] It takes no revelation to speak in
[1:12:47] generalities, but getting down to the
[1:12:50] specifics.
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:52] And you have to be able to say by
[1:12:54] revelation, I am that.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're sons of God. Wonderful. The
[1:13:03] sons of God have been called by God. The
[1:13:05] sons of God are blameless. We say, "Oh,
[1:13:08] amen." We have to say, "I am that son.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; I am that daughter."
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That takes something more. And let me
[1:13:18] say to you, my brother, my sister, in
[1:13:21] speaking in generalities will do you no
[1:13:23] good.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And preaching in generalities will do
[1:13:26] you no good. You've got to know it as a
[1:13:29] specific particular I am that.
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And this is not the power of positive
[1:13:37] thinking.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; This is not the power of positive
[1:13:40] thinking. This is not just getting you
[1:13:43] excited about something. This is
[1:13:45] something I'm saying has to be a reality
[1:13:47] down within your being. You have to know
[1:13:49] that this great God that is too
[1:13:52] mysterious that fills all time and space
[1:13:54] has come down in a great funnel called
[1:13:56] Lov E. Love.
[1:14:00] But he loved you. He put his eyes on you
[1:14:03] and he said, "I want you and I'm going
[1:14:06] to have you and I've ordained you. I've
[1:14:09] predestinated you. I've made you sinless
[1:14:12] by the power of my own life.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I disregard I disregard
[1:14:20] your wickedness. I disregard your past.
[1:14:23] I've washed it away. And you are a new
[1:14:26] creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:31] Hallelujah.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:41] Praise God.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You know, we have a racetrack just down
[1:14:59] here a few blocks.
[1:15:01] Have a racetrack
[1:15:03] and a bunch of horses running around.
[1:15:05] horse flesh running around a racetrack.
[1:15:09] And the people get all excited and throw
[1:15:11] their hats in the air and stomp on the
[1:15:13] ground and jump and shake hands with
[1:15:15] people who don't even want to shake
[1:15:17] hands
[1:15:18] cuz their bet is losing.
[1:15:22] And then they made a bunch of slot
[1:15:23] machines
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; and the people here didn't want them
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; and the mayor tried to stop it and they
[1:15:29] tried to have it. We don't want it.
[1:15:32] They push it through anyway.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And they got thousands, I suppose, of
[1:15:36] slot machines. You can go there early in
[1:15:38] the morning.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And the yard has got hundreds and
[1:15:42] hundreds and hundreds of cars,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; not to church. Oh, and they get so
[1:15:47] enthused when a few that coins that
[1:15:50] aren't even silver anymore,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; pot metal,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; comes rolling out. Oh, I've won the
[1:15:58] jackpot.
[1:16:00] If they did, it come to a crackpot as
[1:16:02] far as I'm concerned.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Just a one total failure.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; And here we come to church and you can't
[1:16:10] rejoice and we can't be happy. I tell
[1:16:12] you, my brother and my sister, it's time
[1:16:14] to awaken.
[1:16:17] [Applause]
[1:16:19] I'm not preaching on, but when they win
[1:16:21] a when they have a windfall and a whole
[1:16:24] bunch of coins or whatever comes running
[1:16:26] out, they don't say, "Oh, we all won the
[1:16:28] jackpot." No, they say, "I won it."
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what you have to
[1:16:33] know. They have to say, "We're all
[1:16:35] Christians." No, I'm that son. I'm that
[1:16:38] daughter. Hallelujah. I have won the
[1:16:42] jackpot.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:51] Well, it was a it was a blessing to me,
[1:16:52] but I didn't know you were going to be
[1:16:54] so happy about it.
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Glory. And the scripture starts to tell
[1:17:02] us now, if we can get to the subject,
[1:17:04] the scripture starts to tell us, "And
[1:17:06] the Lord God formed man." And before he
[1:17:09] could even form man, and the prophet
[1:17:11] mentions to, he had to come down,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the garden from wherever he
[1:17:15] was. There was no place he was because
[1:17:18] he fills the place that was
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and he fills the place that will to be.
[1:17:22] He fills all time and space. We still
[1:17:24] have that. Let's just stay lost in that
[1:17:27] part. He fills all time and space, but
[1:17:29] he came down to the garden. He he he
[1:17:31] caused the earth to be the womb for his
[1:17:33] seed. So he came down to that special
[1:17:37] place and he had a special place within
[1:17:40] the garden be within the earth because
[1:17:42] there he would have his son and his
[1:17:45] son's wife
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; and God comes down. He's created the man
[1:17:50] in his image which he's a spirit. God's
[1:17:53] a spirit and he had a spirit man.
[1:17:58] But now, as the prophet said, he
[1:18:00] couldn't put his hands on the plow.
[1:18:02] So he now he's descended
[1:18:07] to the earth and he's come down to Eden
[1:18:12] and he takes now of the earth, the dust
[1:18:16] of the earth, and lifts that dust. That
[1:18:19] dust now begins to have an ascension
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; in the hand of God.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God comes down,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; something's going to go up.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And he began to lift the dust up.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; The dust of the earth, the lowest of the
[1:18:40] earth, begin to lift it up and form it
[1:18:42] into a man. Hallelujah. And when he had
[1:18:46] that man formed the way he wanted him,
[1:18:48] he breathed that breath of life into
[1:18:50] him. And man became a living soul.
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] Hallelujah.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't that wasn't the end of
[1:19:00] the ascension.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Then he brought him up into immediate
[1:19:04] fellowship with himself.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That wasn't the end of the
[1:19:08] ascension. He took him higher and he
[1:19:11] gave him dominion over all the earth.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he's not
[1:19:17] done his ascension yet. He takes him up
[1:19:19] higher and says, "I'm your father. I'm
[1:19:22] the God of the universe. You're the God
[1:19:24] of the earth.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; And Adam walked away.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; God
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; of the earth.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; What a place.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; And his wife came from him
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and was co-equal with him.
[1:19:47] and Satan threw the serpent because he
[1:19:49] has a certain characteristic that we'll
[1:19:51] get to.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "I will ascend."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; So now that's the only thing he's got
[1:19:58] locked in his mind. And he uses the
[1:20:00] instrumentality of the serpent. And the
[1:20:03] serpent comes to Eve and says, "You
[1:20:05] know, you can go higher.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You can get wiser.
[1:20:13] In fact is
[1:20:15] you can be like God's.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; She was already there.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; But he was enticing her that there was
[1:20:23] something higher. There was something
[1:20:25] more. He was he was he was tempting her
[1:20:28] or enticing her with a higher uh
[1:20:32] ascension
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; than God had given.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You can ascend just a step higher.
[1:20:40] Oh my. Even in the natural realm, how
[1:20:44] Satan has ens snared multitudes of even
[1:20:47] believers, you know, and and and sisters
[1:20:50] of our age, you got more talent. You're
[1:20:53] being held down. You need to express
[1:20:55] this. You need to go somewhere and uh
[1:20:58] being under subjection to your husband's
[1:21:00] got you shackled. You need to get rid of
[1:21:02] these shackles. You can go places. Oh,
[1:21:05] how many times you tell a young man, you
[1:21:07] can go some places. You've got an
[1:21:09] ability and a talent in sports. You can
[1:21:11] never use that in the message. You
[1:21:13] can't. They don't have any place for you
[1:21:14] in the message. But oh, if you just get
[1:21:16] into the right channel, if you just get
[1:21:18] in the right place, can you ever use
[1:21:20] that?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And he's got a snare for them.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying hallelujah because of the
[1:21:28] snare. I'm saying hallelujah cuz we can
[1:21:30] see the snare.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; And he just got allurement. Oh, some
[1:21:36] young woman and she starts, you know,
[1:21:38] she's just a girl. She's just playing
[1:21:40] around with all the other kids and she
[1:21:42] starts getting into her young womanhood
[1:21:44] and she looks in the mirror and finally
[1:21:46] she says, "Yeah, I'm beautiful."
[1:21:49] Uh, and I got all the guys whistling at
[1:21:51] me. You got that? That's the snare.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Something that God gave
[1:21:57] in a natural sense. Something that God
[1:21:59] gave. And so the devil's got all kinds
[1:22:00] of things. Now, if you just put on these
[1:22:02] kind of clothes and if you just do your
[1:22:04] hair this way and if you just put on
[1:22:05] this kind of uh you know cosmetics and
[1:22:07] if you just do this and do that and
[1:22:09] everything is everything is pointed in
[1:22:12] that direction. He just taking them down
[1:22:14] that road you know uh glamorizing the
[1:22:17] beauty and and thrusting her out into
[1:22:20] prostitution.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And not the prostitution you and I know
[1:22:24] about the prostitution that Jesus talked
[1:22:26] about. If she dresses, and the prophet
[1:22:28] said, if she dresses in such a way to
[1:22:29] cause a man to lust after her, she's
[1:22:32] committed adultery before God. That's
[1:22:35] what Jesus said. Hallelujah. This
[1:22:38] message came to protect you from that.
[1:22:47] And so God
[1:22:49] now
[1:22:51] the woman is is Eve is
[1:22:55] being offered more light, the prophet
[1:22:57] said.
[1:22:59] And then comes what we all know as the
[1:23:04] fall
[1:23:07] from where God had them ascended to.
[1:23:11] God of the earth co-equal with co-equal
[1:23:15] in this realm
[1:23:18] she was co-equal with Adam not Adam
[1:23:21] ain't co-equal with God she Eve was
[1:23:24] co-equal and then came the fall
[1:23:28] came the
[1:23:30] descent brother Brandham said in
[1:23:32] blasphemous names what God did he
[1:23:34] breathed into him the breath of eternal
[1:23:36] life then he became a living soul and
[1:23:38] that soul can't die in the breach. He
[1:23:41] said he was god of the earth. God's the
[1:23:44] god of the universe everywhere. But his
[1:23:46] son had this earth under his own
[1:23:48] control. He could speak, he could name,
[1:23:51] he could say, he could stop nature. He
[1:23:53] could do anything he wanted to do. In a
[1:23:56] marriage and divorce, he says Adam and
[1:23:57] Eve were co-equal, one man, one woman.
[1:24:00] The woman sinned. And what does what
[1:24:02] does she do? He says that threw them all
[1:24:05] to death. Death now to die is to become
[1:24:10] prostrated
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; which is to fall
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; and that's what death means. So now it's
[1:24:17] a descent a descending
[1:24:22] and God had to make a covenant by that
[1:24:26] and another covenant.
[1:24:28] So he made another covenant now after
[1:24:30] the fall. And you say that is why he
[1:24:32] made the sentence to to the serpent and
[1:24:35] he fell
[1:24:37] and his body structure was changed
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; and to Adam he fell from his dominion
[1:24:44] from his fellowship
[1:24:47] from his knowing of what to do. He lost
[1:24:50] the way of the tree of life and the
[1:24:53] cherubam were protecting that. He had no
[1:24:56] access to it. No direct access here. He
[1:24:58] just had an immediate fellowship with
[1:24:59] God. Now he has no access to the tree of
[1:25:02] life
[1:25:04] and Eve fell. So the whole thing was a
[1:25:07] fall.
[1:25:10] It was sudden.
[1:25:12] It was traumatic
[1:25:16] and it had indescribable
[1:25:21] consequences.
[1:25:23] Now,
[1:25:26] so after the serpent has
[1:25:29] has suggested that he's going to have an
[1:25:31] ascension and in fact that ascension is
[1:25:36] in fact a descending.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; What does that make him? A liar.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; He offers one thing and another comes
[1:25:45] from it.
[1:25:48] So now I just want to see where this
[1:25:51] came from. And Isaiah the prophet
[1:25:54] reaching into the eternities
[1:25:57] takes right what the what Lucifer said
[1:26:00] in his own heart. For thou hast said in
[1:26:02] thine heart. Now notice what a we we we
[1:26:04] we need a real revelation what a prophet
[1:26:06] is. A prophet can go not only into
[1:26:09] yesterday. Brother Brandham says to the
[1:26:10] woman you are praying and you hear me
[1:26:12] say this quite often but I'm trying to
[1:26:14] get across a certain certain uh uh
[1:26:17] qualification and a certain truth to
[1:26:19] you. He says to a woman, "You were
[1:26:21] praying at a chair in your bedroom
[1:26:24] before you came to this service and I
[1:26:26] can hear you praying." I say, "Where is
[1:26:29] he?" He said talks to another woman and
[1:26:32] says, "You were you were being examined
[1:26:35] by a doctor. In fact, two doctors and
[1:26:38] they are rather large men. I hear them
[1:26:42] speaking."
[1:26:46] And if you can go back a week another on
[1:26:50] another occasion, he says, "I see the
[1:26:53] doctor's report."
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And he told the individual what was
[1:26:58] written on the doctor's report. That's
[1:27:00] on tape.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; A tape you can hear.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Where is that prophet? I'll tell you.
[1:27:07] He's in eternity
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; where there's no yesterday and no today
[1:27:11] and no tomorrow. All is present. That's
[1:27:14] where he is. Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. That is the
[1:27:19] truth.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; He's in an eternal realm.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; And if he can go back yesterday or last
[1:27:26] week or a year, what is the difference
[1:27:28] between a year and going back 6,000
[1:27:30] years? That's what God did for Moses.
[1:27:33] Took him back some centuries and he
[1:27:35] wrote what happened in the Eden. Now we
[1:27:37] become so polluted and so indoctrinated
[1:27:39] with all kinds of false religion that
[1:27:42] God had to reestablish in the end time
[1:27:44] before he brings the world to judgment.
[1:27:46] He sends a prophet voice to tell you
[1:27:48] precisely what was spoken.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Isaiah Isaiah reached into heaven and
[1:27:55] told us and it was written down
[1:27:57] precisely what Lucifer said in his
[1:27:59] heart.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; In his heart.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Is that too much? Do you believe Isaiah?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Then you ought to believe William
[1:28:08] Brandam in this day.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; He says in the mind of God, in the back
[1:28:13] part of God's mind, where was it? Oh,
[1:28:15] back into some trillions of trillions of
[1:28:18] eternities. I don't know where it was,
[1:28:19] but here God has a vessel on earth that
[1:28:22] reaches right back into the into not
[1:28:24] even back. It might even be forward into
[1:28:26] the very mind of God to tell you what
[1:28:28] God desires.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be known. He wanted to be
[1:28:34] revealed.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be known as a father
[1:28:38] because he loved fatherhood. He loves
[1:28:41] when you can say from your heart from
[1:28:44] within. He loves to hear you say,
[1:28:46] "Father."
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; The disciples said to Jesus, "How should
[1:28:52] we pray? How should we approach God?
[1:28:55] What should we say when we come?" His
[1:28:57] first words, "Our father."
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:03] He loves fatherhood.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; He's not just general God someplace.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He's not just some general the higher
[1:29:12] power.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I just despise those those kind of
[1:29:18] you know what they are escapes.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Don't say God, say higher power.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; They don't know who the higher power is
[1:29:26] and they don't know who God is.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; So really what's the difference? But
[1:29:30] when you can say the God who created
[1:29:33] heavens and earth is my God. And that
[1:29:36] God was revealed in Jesus Christ. And
[1:29:39] that God revealed himself in this day in
[1:29:42] the revealing of the son of man. And
[1:29:44] that God is my God. That God is my
[1:29:47] father.
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he revealed himself in
[1:29:54] this time
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; as a bridegroom husband. Hallelujah.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, now it gets down to the
[1:30:00] particular, the very particular. And I
[1:30:03] am a member of his wife.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I have been into the
[1:30:08] bedroom chamber,
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; and I am pregnantated by his seed.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And thus, I have eternal life.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Now, that's that's where it might just
[1:30:22] leave some folks behind, but that that's
[1:30:25] where you lost it. Don't let her leave
[1:30:27] you behind. When you get right there
[1:30:28] where your mind runs out of space, say,
[1:30:30] "Help me now, Lord.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Help me now. Don't let me miss this."
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet's warning. Oh, it
[1:30:39] was easy to believe.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Easy to believe we're in church. Easy to
[1:30:43] believe it's Sunday morning. Easy to
[1:30:45] believe that this ministers up here all
[1:30:47] enthused.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's easy to believe.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; It's a little different.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "I am that individual.
[1:30:58] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will ascend into heaven. I
[1:31:12] will ascend to the heights of the clouds
[1:31:15] and I will be like the most high. I will
[1:31:18] ascend. I will go up.
[1:31:21] I will spring up.
[1:31:24] I will be exalted.
[1:31:26] That is what he was saying. I will be
[1:31:28] exalted.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And in Thessalonians, it says,
[1:31:33] "Let no man deceive you by any means.
[1:31:36] For that day,
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; speaking of this day,
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; that day shall not come except there
[1:31:44] come a falling away first, a descending
[1:31:49] first." Oh friends,
[1:31:53] look at the town, the city, the
[1:31:55] community. I don't care. United States,
[1:31:58] England, Germany,
[1:32:01] Africa,
[1:32:03] every one of them, China, Japan,
[1:32:07] Canada, we've descended
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; to hell itself.
[1:32:16] You can say all the flowery things you
[1:32:18] want to, but the society is corrupted.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; It's rank.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And it's filled with putrifying sores.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Is there no good? Of course there is.
[1:32:33] They've been eating from the tree of
[1:32:35] good and of knowledge. But their
[1:32:37] knowledge, the more they expanded their
[1:32:40] knowledge, the greater to death they
[1:32:43] went.
[1:32:48] And the scripture says, "There shall
[1:32:50] come a falling away first." Jesus said,
[1:32:56] I'm sorry, the Satan said to Jesus, now
[1:33:00] notice,
[1:33:02] and sayith unto him, all these things,
[1:33:04] all these kingdoms will I give thee if
[1:33:07] thou wilt, if you will fall down
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; and worship me.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; And that falling down is the same thing
[1:33:16] as dying. Yeah.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; If you will fall down and worship me,
[1:33:21] give me respect
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; and worship me.
[1:33:28] Satan tempted Jesus to descend by
[1:33:32] falling down and worshiping him. And the
[1:33:35] scripture says if you live after the
[1:33:37] flesh, that is a descending. How many
[1:33:40] young people are tempted, especially
[1:33:42] once you get out of school, you know,
[1:33:44] you begin to enter the work world and
[1:33:47] you're thrust into the community of the
[1:33:50] people uh work people. You come into a
[1:33:53] relationship with associates and so on
[1:33:55] and you have to work side by side and
[1:33:57] and uh uh have a have some kind of uh
[1:34:02] you know community spirit with them.
[1:34:06] and how easy it is to start crossing the
[1:34:09] lines, the border lines from your
[1:34:12] convictions of your own heart and
[1:34:14] compromising
[1:34:15] and then a person begins to live after
[1:34:17] the flesh. And the scripture says, "If
[1:34:19] we live after the flesh, you shall die."
[1:34:22] Exactly what it is. You shall fall. If
[1:34:24] you live after the flesh, you shall
[1:34:26] descend.
[1:34:28] And as long as a person lives after the
[1:34:30] flesh and they continue to pursue
[1:34:33] fleshly pursuits,
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; they will decline.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And I've seen homes decline. I've seen
[1:34:41] families decline. I've seen individuals
[1:34:44] decline. I've seen great professions of
[1:34:48] faith. Oh, I'm a believer. I want to be
[1:34:50] baptized. all the rest of and I see them
[1:34:52] start you know Satan allures them or
[1:34:54] some enchants them and they begin to
[1:34:56] decline just the the the declination
[1:35:00] becomes very subtle sometimes it's just
[1:35:03] a missing church doesn't it's to me a
[1:35:07] lot of people have to miss churches we
[1:35:08] got bus drivers we got business people
[1:35:10] we got all kinds of things they have to
[1:35:11] miss church that's another thing that
[1:35:13] that's to me that's different not
[1:35:16] entirely different but it is different I
[1:35:18] don't think anything should dominate us
[1:35:21] and anything should not be uh a dictator
[1:35:23] to us. But when people just willingly
[1:35:26] well you know um I might hear I might
[1:35:29] stream tonight. You want to be sure that
[1:35:32] it's not uh you know it's not something
[1:35:35] that is commencing you on a declining
[1:35:39] direction because if you decline you are
[1:35:43] descending and if you're descending I
[1:35:46] ask you where are you descending to?
[1:36:01] Now, the scripture says, I'm just going
[1:36:03] to throw this in.
[1:36:05] For the man is not of the woman, but the
[1:36:08] woman of the man.
[1:36:11] The man is not of the woman, but the
[1:36:12] woman of the man. In other words, Paul
[1:36:14] is saying that man was not taken out of
[1:36:17] the woman. when the woman was taken out
[1:36:19] of the man.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; In fact is Eve was the only woman taken
[1:36:24] out of the man
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; in that sense of the word
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; because all other women were born by a
[1:36:32] sexual natural birth.
[1:36:35] Then the scripture says neither was the
[1:36:37] man created for the woman but the woman
[1:36:39] for the man. And Jesus was the only man
[1:36:44] that was born of a woman. Born through a
[1:36:47] woman, but she he was not of the woman.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not Jew. He was not gentile.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Eve was the incubator that carried him.
[1:36:58] But the seed was the seed of God. And
[1:37:01] the blood, the scripture says, was the
[1:37:02] blood of God.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; He was not of the woman. The woman was
[1:37:07] of the man. And Eve was the only woman
[1:37:09] who was of the man. And the fall came
[1:37:12] through the instrumentality of her being
[1:37:16] seduced by the serpent. And the whole
[1:37:20] fall came. And look where we are.
[1:37:23] The graveyards everywhere, cities of the
[1:37:26] dead we call it. And that is that is
[1:37:30] when a person fully becomes prostrate.
[1:37:36] fully. You're laid out
[1:37:39] and you're buried.
[1:37:41] And as far as as far as time and
[1:37:44] beginning and ending is concerned,
[1:37:46] that's an end and a conclusion as far as
[1:37:48] life is concerned.
[1:37:50] Oh, how I thank God
[1:37:54] that God descended.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I want to take you through some more. I
[1:38:00] need to take you through some more for
[1:38:02] another few minutes, please. Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; In the message, two vines, the prophet
[1:38:08] says the woman Eve was the tree of
[1:38:10] death.
[1:38:12] We all taste of her. We all taste of her
[1:38:16] because we are living a life. This is a
[1:38:19] life that we are tasting of this life.
[1:38:23] We all taste of her being born in this
[1:38:27] world. And as sure as we're born of a
[1:38:30] woman, we've got to die.
[1:38:37] We are a paradox
[1:38:39] here today. I don't care who you are. If
[1:38:41] time is to go on
[1:38:45] and if a rapture
[1:38:47] and a change of these bodies does not
[1:38:50] transpire in our time,
[1:38:54] every one of us is destined. It's
[1:38:56] appointed unto man once to die.
[1:38:59] On one on one hand, we are in a
[1:39:04] physically as mortals, we are in a
[1:39:08] decline.
[1:39:11] Physically mortals. I notice no one said
[1:39:14] amen. And that's fine.
[1:39:17] But you are declining. You're older now
[1:39:20] than you were this morning when you
[1:39:21] walked into church.
[1:39:23] and time taking its natural process,
[1:39:27] you'll get wrinkles and you'll lose your
[1:39:31] youth and your energy and your strength
[1:39:33] and all the rest of it. And you can do
[1:39:35] all the aerobics you want, but it will
[1:39:37] finally catch up with you.
[1:39:40] You can eat all the health food you
[1:39:42] want. You can eat all the organic stuff
[1:39:44] you want, but it'll finally catch up
[1:39:46] with you. And one day, even though you
[1:39:49] don't admit it to anybody, you'll say,
[1:39:51] "I'm getting older.
[1:39:55] I don't even get out of bed today."
[1:39:58] You know,
[1:40:02] I don't want to tell you about my
[1:40:03] treadmill.
[1:40:05] It's rusting upstairs.
[1:40:10] You will say that. And that day will
[1:40:13] come when people they will pass by if it
[1:40:17] happens to be that way. And you'll not
[1:40:19] be erect and you'll not be with your
[1:40:21] face and your eyes dazzling and and
[1:40:23] you're full of energy and vigor and and
[1:40:26] all the rest of it and energy uh uh for
[1:40:29] life and zest. You won't be that way.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; You'll be laying there and the mortician
[1:40:35] will make you look as nice as possible.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I've been around too many of them.
[1:40:43] And people pass by and I've said it. I
[1:40:46] don't mind saying I don't mind admitting
[1:40:48] it and say they look so peaceful they're
[1:40:50] not even there.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, they look so peaceful. They're doing
[1:40:57] one of two things.
[1:40:59] They're either screaming
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; the torments of hell
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; because they have gone to another place.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; They're not in that box.
[1:41:11] They're not in that nice satin and silk.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; They haven't got their head on a nice
[1:41:16] pillow. They're in hell.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus said so. And if Jesus said so, can
[1:41:22] I say so?
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; And there's others that have taken one
[1:41:26] step and that body dropped down and they
[1:41:29] went into another realm. Hallelujah. And
[1:41:32] they had a they stepped into the body.
[1:41:34] They bypassed
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden. They bypassed it.
[1:41:39] their theophony body and they stepped
[1:41:41] into that theophony body. The Apostle
[1:41:43] Paul said, "If this temple, if this
[1:41:45] tabernacle be dissolved, this one, point
[1:41:47] to it. If this temple be dissolved, we
[1:41:50] have another."
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Not we will have.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; We do have.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know why he had to say it that
[1:42:00] way? Is because it is eternal. It's
[1:42:02] Aeonian. He said eternal in the heavens.
[1:42:05] And eternal could not say we will have
[1:42:07] it.
[1:42:09] We have it.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in the mind of God,
[1:42:14] you've always had it.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; You descended.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You descended from the very thought of
[1:42:21] God.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; You came down all through the
[1:42:24] generations, as I've said previously.
[1:42:27] And you've descended down through your
[1:42:29] forefathers, down from one seed, mingled
[1:42:32] with another and another and another.
[1:42:35] And God watched over your lineage.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And he mixed this one with this one
[1:42:43] until he just get a certain tingle. And
[1:42:46] some of your forefathers went through
[1:42:48] wars and went through battles, but God
[1:42:52] preserved them.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; They came close to accidents. They came
[1:42:56] close to death, but God preserved them
[1:42:59] because in God's mind, you had to come
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; and you would come.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And when the appointed time would come,
[1:43:08] God by his spirit, the great God who's
[1:43:11] just general, people know him as a great
[1:43:13] God, but that God came down and in a
[1:43:17] particular way spoke words to you.
[1:43:27] The man that led me into the ministry
[1:43:28] was on a dance floor.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; He was on a dance floor dancing
[1:43:34] probably back in the days when they were
[1:43:36] doing the Charleston or whatever more.
[1:43:39] And while he was on the dance floor, his
[1:43:41] name is Chad. Few people here know him.
[1:43:45] God spoke and called his name. Not his
[1:43:47] full name, but his known his his this
[1:43:51] name he's known by.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Chad, sir,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; this is not the way. He walked out of
[1:43:58] there off the dance floor immediately
[1:44:00] and went to his stood beside his car and
[1:44:03] gave his heart to God and from that day
[1:44:06] forward lived all he knew to be the
[1:44:09] truth.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I say friends, that's when that general
[1:44:14] God becomes specific to you.
[1:44:17] And you have to confess it.
[1:44:20] [Applause]
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, God sent a God sent a
[1:44:24] prophet." That's easy.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; That's Malachi 4. That's still easy.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; That's Luke 17:30. That's still easy.
[1:44:32] But when you say that God that revealed
[1:44:34] himself in that messenger is my God.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; And that message is my message.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; And I live by it.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; It is my mandate. Then that God has
[1:44:47] become particular to you
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; and you have to confess that
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; or it will not work.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; When you confess it, the high priest
[1:44:59] moves on your behalf.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:15] Can I go just a few minutes?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Adam had no knowledge of his ascending.
[1:45:21] He didn't know he come from the earth.
[1:45:25] He just took a step one day and there it
[1:45:28] was.
[1:45:30] All creation.
[1:45:32] Wow.
[1:45:34] There's all the animals coming. Oh. And
[1:45:37] his father said, "You're in charge."
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; In fact, his haven't been named yet. I
[1:45:42] want you to name them.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, but he had such a mind that'd be
[1:45:48] easy. This is a lion. And that bird up
[1:45:50] there is an eagle. And this over here,
[1:45:52] there's a lamb.
[1:45:55] And and his father was saying, "You're
[1:45:57] exactly right. You're exactly right.
[1:45:59] That's exactly what it is. That was what
[1:46:02] was in my mind. You got the same mind.
[1:46:11] Hallelujah.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; But he did know
[1:46:17] when the fall came and he became
[1:46:21] faced with death, faced with the dead
[1:46:25] son Abel. Then he knew from where he had
[1:46:27] fallen.
[1:46:29] He had knowledge of his descent,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; but he had no knowledge of his his
[1:46:34] ascent.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Today, because we're creatures of time,
[1:46:42] we also through the memory channel, we
[1:46:45] can remember kind of where we were and
[1:46:47] where we come from,
[1:46:51] but we don't have as good an
[1:46:54] understanding.
[1:46:56] And we we we think about and people I I
[1:46:58] just say that this just happens to be a
[1:47:00] reality of life. They think about the
[1:47:02] the the present and the difficulties and
[1:47:05] the past and all of those things. And
[1:47:08] Satan so desires to come in and remember
[1:47:11] and he wants to you to recall your
[1:47:13] descent
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; where you were where you descended into
[1:47:17] and your problems and all of that. He
[1:47:18] wants you to be mindful of that. But God
[1:47:21] is saying you're ascending. You are
[1:47:23] ascending. He wants you to think about
[1:47:25] your ascent.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; And we don't have the same knowledge. We
[1:47:30] don't have the same understanding
[1:47:31] because we can't really see exactly
[1:47:33] where we're going. What's it all about?
[1:47:34] What it'll be like? Oh my. I wish I how
[1:47:36] how can I anticipate it?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you just have to take what has
[1:47:41] been written
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; and believe it.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And say it's far beyond. It's too
[1:47:46] mysterious.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe it.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:51] I believe what I cannot understand.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Here's a few times I'm going to go
[1:47:58] quickly.
[1:48:04] Right after the flood, children of
[1:48:06] Israel decided, I mean, what not
[1:48:08] children of Israel, excuse me, the
[1:48:10] people decided they would build a tower
[1:48:13] to reach up into heaven because we don't
[1:48:15] want this destruction anymore. Whatever
[1:48:17] was in their minds, they don't know. And
[1:48:18] the people were all of one language. And
[1:48:20] the Bible says, "And the Lord came down
[1:48:23] to see the city and the tower which the
[1:48:26] children of Israel build it." He didn't
[1:48:28] come down
[1:48:29] in the sense that he was so many light
[1:48:31] years away and came down.
[1:48:34] God
[1:48:35] came into the realm
[1:48:38] of man and where he was and what he was
[1:48:41] doing and to see
[1:48:46] not even see in the sense of knowing.
[1:48:50] God can't learn.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; God's God. He knows exactly what they
[1:48:55] were doing.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what their intent. He
[1:48:58] knew everything. But he came down.
[1:49:00] There's an aspect of God you just have
[1:49:02] to think about. But I don't want to
[1:49:03] dwell on that much longer because I want
[1:49:05] to go on immediately to another place.
[1:49:08] He says, "I will go down and see whether
[1:49:12] uh I will go down to see the city and
[1:49:14] the tower which the children of Israel
[1:49:16] of man builded."
[1:49:18] Then there's another occasion and now he
[1:49:23] had uh spoken to a man Abram and I won't
[1:49:26] give it in story form but Abram left his
[1:49:28] he told him leave your kindred leave
[1:49:30] your families and go to a land that I
[1:49:32] will show you and he had a man that
[1:49:34] believed him and he got him out there
[1:49:36] and he appeared unto Abram and Abram
[1:49:38] built an altar and worshiped God.
[1:49:42] God coming to Abram. There's there's no
[1:49:46] Hebrew nation. There's no such a thing
[1:49:49] as children of Israel.
[1:49:52] The earth is full of tribes, but has no
[1:49:56] people of God.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; All it is is human flesh,
[1:50:04] idol worshippers, Abram himself being
[1:50:06] one.
[1:50:08] And God
[1:50:11] called
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; and that man started an ascension.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; He started ascending.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Separate yourself. And he's ascending
[1:50:21] further.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Go to a place that I will show you. And
[1:50:25] he's ascending further and higher. And
[1:50:27] he appears to him again. Says, I'm going
[1:50:29] to give you seed. And he ascends higher
[1:50:32] and higher and higher. He's in an
[1:50:35] ascension because God came down.
[1:50:39] Hallelujah.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; And then because he was a special friend
[1:50:41] of God, God came in various ways and
[1:50:44] showed himself in the form of Melzdc and
[1:50:46] a theophony and and they had you know
[1:50:48] they had some uh conversation and so on.
[1:50:51] But then he comes now he comes listen
[1:50:54] closely because I'll be coming back to
[1:50:56] it. God actually has his his eyes and
[1:50:59] his vision at another as far as time is
[1:51:03] concerned in the in the relationship to
[1:51:06] the peoples of the earth. He has his eye
[1:51:10] way
[1:51:12] thousands of years
[1:51:14] beyond Calvary, beyond the prophets and
[1:51:16] the kings, and beyond Calvary, and
[1:51:20] beyond 68 million martyrs, and beyond a
[1:51:23] Luther, and beyond a Wesley, and beyond
[1:51:26] an age of great signs and wonders, and
[1:51:29] there comes an end time. And in his own
[1:51:31] mind, he knows from this, he knows from
[1:51:33] his word, he must bring this earth to
[1:51:36] judgment. But before I bring it to
[1:51:38] judgment, I will come again myself
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; in the form of Elohim.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And I will tell people the secret of
[1:51:47] their heart behind the back of my
[1:51:49] servant. And so in order to do that, I
[1:51:52] must do it now and lay a seed down for
[1:51:55] them to believe in when that time comes.
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:05] because we can only live by word.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; And that's where his eye is fixed up
[1:52:12] ahead for you,
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; for me.
[1:52:16] God himself came down in the form of
[1:52:20] Elohim
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; and ate meat and butter and drank milk
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; and a meal that Abraham had fixed for
[1:52:27] him and his wife
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[1:52:31] And he's laying down a scriptural
[1:52:33] pattern.
[1:52:35] And he's lifting he's lifting his son by
[1:52:38] coming down as Elohim. He's going to
[1:52:40] lift him up now. He's separated. He's
[1:52:43] he's he's promised him, you're going to
[1:52:45] be the father of nations. It hasn't
[1:52:47] happened yet, but you're going to and
[1:52:48] he's going to lift him from a childless
[1:52:52] barren state
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; to be a father of a promised son
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; that would be a type. He raises them
[1:53:00] higher. He'll be a type of my son,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Oh, he'll be like him in
[1:53:06] every way. He'll even carry wood like a
[1:53:09] cross of a mountain. and there'll be
[1:53:12] fire and wood and you'll offer him as a
[1:53:15] sacrifice because I am going to offer my
[1:53:17] son as a sacrifice. I'm lifting you up
[1:53:20] in an ascension until you're going to
[1:53:22] until you are even a type of me
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; and your son will be a type of my son
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; and he lifts him up by coming down. He
[1:53:33] lift up this our father in the faith.
[1:53:39] I'm going to give you a son. Sarah, your
[1:53:42] wife, is going to conceive according to
[1:53:44] time of life. In the next 28, 30 days,
[1:53:46] she's going to conceive and bring forth
[1:53:49] a son.
[1:53:52] Oh, my brother, my sister. And he laid
[1:53:54] out a word, and I'm going to give you
[1:53:58] the key now.
[1:54:01] for a people in his mind. You were not
[1:54:05] even born yet. You were still in the
[1:54:08] mind of God, but you had to come down
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; into into this darkened
[1:54:15] darkened hour.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; I start getting a song. God came down in
[1:54:21] this darkened hour with signs and
[1:54:24] wonders and mighty power. God came down
[1:54:29] in resurrection life. Hallelujah.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; In this hour and if he had not come
[1:54:34] down, you wouldn't be going up.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Because he did come down, you are going
[1:54:39] upl. And your ascension hasn't completed
[1:54:42] yet.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this same word that you
[1:54:46] believe to get where you are now by
[1:54:48] believing that same word, you take your
[1:54:50] final step and step into the eternities.
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:02] He descended
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; one like under the Son of Man descended
[1:55:07] into a burning furnace
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; with a king, a powerful king, the power
[1:55:12] of the earth, and three men in the
[1:55:14] furnace. God descended down with them
[1:55:16] and ascended them. They began to ascend
[1:55:19] above the power of the flame, above the
[1:55:21] power of the smoke, above the power of
[1:55:23] the king, above the power of his armies.
[1:55:25] And they walked out and the king looked
[1:55:27] in there and said, "I put three in and
[1:55:31] one is there. There's four and the
[1:55:33] fourth man looks like the son of God."
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Those three men walked out
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; because he came down in this generation.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; According to Revelation 10, he
[1:55:47] descended. He came down. And because he
[1:55:49] came down, you're going to walk out of
[1:55:51] this death.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to walk out of this
[1:55:53] darkness.
[1:55:55] Hallelujah.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; That's according to his word.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Perhaps we can pick up on this
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; the next meeting.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say praise him. Praise him.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love him.
[1:56:18] That's why I sang He'll do it again.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; That's what I was referring to. That's
[1:56:22] what was in my mind. He'll do it again.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, this isn't just some little
[1:56:30] excitement. This is glorious truth.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; You live by it.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; And he'll stand by it.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Deny everything else. Deny the enemy.
[1:56:42] Deny the devil. Deny the liar.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; He's the same mighty God.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:52] I think maybe brother Rod we ought to
[1:56:54] sing as one of the songs. They wouldn't
[1:56:56] bow, they wouldn't bend, and they
[1:56:58] wouldn't burn.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; I love that
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; because here's another group of people
[1:57:05] got the same son of man walking with
[1:57:06] them. We won't bow, we won't bend, and
[1:57:10] we won't burn.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:18] If you think I'm beside myself, I say
[1:57:20] like brother Brown, just leave me alone.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; I'm enjoying it.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:43] Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; And want to sing a verse of He's the
[1:57:47] Lord of glory after that.
[1:57:52] Let's sing. Should we sing the chorus
[1:57:53] first or No, I guess it goes into it,
[1:57:56] doesn't matter.
[1:57:59] Start off. Yeah.
[1:58:02] Can we get you to put on the screen?
[1:58:05] There it is.
[1:58:08] Here is a story from the good book we
[1:58:12] know. A story about a miracle that
[1:58:16] happened long ago. We hope that you'll
[1:58:20] take courage when temptation you meet.
[1:58:24] There's somebody watching you from when
[1:58:27] you're weak. They wouldn't bend. They
[1:58:30] held on to the word of God. We are told
[1:58:34] they wouldn't bow
[1:58:36] their knees to the eye of the gold. They
[1:58:39] would burn. They were protected by
[1:58:43] fourth manif
[1:58:46] and they would bow. They wouldn't burn.
[1:58:51] Prophet Daniel tells about three men who
[1:58:54] walked with God. Shadrach, Meach, and
[1:58:57] Abednego. Before the wicked king they
[1:59:00] stood, and the king commanded them bound
[1:59:03] and thrown in the fiery furnace that
[1:59:05] day. The fire was so hot that the men
[1:59:08] were slain who forced them on their way.
[1:59:12] When the three were cast in and the king
[1:59:14] rose up to witness their awful fate, he
[1:59:17] began to tremble at what he saw. In
[1:59:20] astonished tones he spake, did we not
[1:59:23] cast three men bound into the midst of
[1:59:26] the fire?
[1:59:28] But lo, I see four men unheard, unbound,
[1:59:31] and walking down there. There's
[1:59:34] Shadrach, Meshack, Abednego. In the
[1:59:36] fiery pools they trod, but the form of
[1:59:39] the fourth man that I see is like the
[1:59:42] son of God. They wouldn't bend.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't bow.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Word of God. So we are told they
[1:59:49] wouldn't bow. They would not bow their
[1:59:52] knees to the idol.
[1:59:54] They wouldn't burn. They were protected
[1:59:57] by the fourth man in the fire. They
[2:00:00] wouldn't bend. They wouldn't bow. They
[2:00:03] wouldn't burn. Oh, they wouldn't bend.
[2:00:06] They held on to the word of God. So we
[2:00:10] are told they wouldn't bow. Would not
[2:00:13] bow their knees to the idols made of
[2:00:15] gold. They wouldn't burn. They weren't
[2:00:18] protected by the fourth man in the fire.
[2:00:21] They wouldn't bend. They wouldn't bow.
[2:00:24] They wouldn't burn.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:00:32] Uh but behold, what manner of man is
[2:00:35] this? Not not the whole thing, just a
[2:00:37] couple of verses. Uh the one especially
[2:00:40] about Yeah, you'll see it when you get
[2:00:42] there. What number is that
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:51] of glory? He is the great I am. He's the
[2:00:56] alpha and your bean, the beginning and
[2:01:00] the end. His name is wonderful, the
[2:01:05] prince of peace.
[2:01:08] He's the everlasting father throughout
[2:01:12] eternity. The fourth verse.
[2:01:15] Behold, what manner of men is this who
[2:01:18] stand between God and man? His eyes are
[2:01:22] as a flame of fire and maned in his
[2:01:26] hair. John saw him in seven churches as
[2:01:30] the son in brilliance see. Behold what
[2:01:34] manner of man is this. What manner of
[2:01:37] man? Well, he's the Lord of glory. He is
[2:01:43] great I am. He's the alb
[2:01:47] of the beginning and the end. His name
[2:01:52] is wonderful. The prince of peace is he.
[2:01:57] He's the everlasting father throughout
[2:02:01] eternity.
[2:02:04] Behold, what manner of men is this who
[2:02:07] sits on his heavenly throne. He rules
[2:02:11] and reigns from heaven above, his
[2:02:13] beloved and his own. He's the lion of
[2:02:17] tribe of Judah, the root of David is he.
[2:02:22] Behold, what manner of man is this? What
[2:02:25] manner of man?
[2:02:28] He's the Lord of glory. He is great. I
[2:02:33] am, the Alpha, the only God, the
[2:02:37] beginning and the end. His name is
[2:02:42] wonderful. The prince of God is he. He's
[2:02:46] the everlasting father to eternity.
[2:02:53] Oh, how wonderful.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; How great is our God,
[2:03:00] our gracious, loving heavenly father.
[2:03:05] How thankful
[2:03:07] and how appreciative we are for what you
[2:03:10] have done.
[2:03:12] Not merely in the past, but what you
[2:03:14] have done in bringing us to this place
[2:03:17] where we are.
[2:03:19] And truly, we can say you have caused an
[2:03:22] ascension. There's an ascending power.
[2:03:25] There's an ascending order in our lives.
[2:03:28] We see it, Lord, in the company of the
[2:03:30] saints. We see it as we travel from
[2:03:33] church to church and city to city. We
[2:03:36] see it as it's taking place around the
[2:03:38] world. And I pray, oh God, though the
[2:03:41] world themselves may mock and laugh, one
[2:03:44] day it'll be the last smile, their smile
[2:03:46] on their face will turn very, very
[2:03:49] quickly to sadness when they realize, oh
[2:03:52] God, that there's some folks that are
[2:03:54] turned up missing, oh God. And there's
[2:03:58] an ascension taking place right now that
[2:04:01] they're not aware of, they're not
[2:04:02] conscious of. But Lord Jesus, as you
[2:04:05] were taken up and you were received into
[2:04:08] a cloud and you you went out of their
[2:04:10] sight is what the scripture says. Oh
[2:04:13] God, this is certain to take place. I
[2:04:18] for one, I want to meet by your grace
[2:04:22] and only your grace. Lord, we know it
[2:04:24] would only be possible by grace. I want
[2:04:27] to meet those who are redeemed and
[2:04:30] bloodbought
[2:04:32] and that we will rejoice together there.
[2:04:34] But we won't wait for that time. We will
[2:04:36] rejoice now and we will give you glory
[2:04:39] now and we'll cast down our throne, our
[2:04:42] crowns and everything before you now.
[2:04:44] Lord, we give you all the praise and all
[2:04:48] the glory. Thank you for this wonderful
[2:04:51] uh attendance and group of people that
[2:04:53] are here today and all those that Lord
[2:04:56] Jesus around the world in different
[2:04:58] places are listening. We say God bless
[2:05:01] them and may the Holy Spirit enter into
[2:05:04] each room and each place where they're
[2:05:06] gathered. I ask oh God to be a just a
[2:05:09] special presence and that you will do
[2:05:12] for them what is needful at this time.
[2:05:14] We pray Lord for those that are standing
[2:05:18] here today. Some may be bound. Some
[2:05:22] perhaps have not been released. Satan
[2:05:25] still is holding a grip on their mind
[2:05:28] and upon their lives. I pray you'll come
[2:05:32] to them. And in your coming to them, not
[2:05:36] in a general term of God or of Jesus
[2:05:39] Christ of Nazareth, but the Jesus Christ
[2:05:42] of now. You'll come and draw close to
[2:05:46] them and may you speak their name. May
[2:05:49] they hear your voice. Come up higher.
[2:05:53] Separate yourself. Come out from among
[2:05:55] them and be separate, say the Lord. May
[2:05:58] they hear that voice. May they respond
[2:06:01] as Abraham did immediately.
[2:06:04] Bless the people and Lord, we're in
[2:06:06] great anticipation for what you have
[2:06:08] from service to service. And tonight,
[2:06:10] her brother Tom Ray will be ministering.
[2:06:12] Lord. Oh, I pray you'll anoint him
[2:06:14] mightily, oh God. Send forth your word
[2:06:17] into our hearts. Bless the people now as
[2:06:19] they are refreshed. In Jesus Christ's
[2:06:22] name, dismiss us now we pray. Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's one announcement that the
[2:06:28] all the sisters working in the kitchen
[2:06:30] in either the food preparation or
[2:06:32] sanitation department, please meet
[2:06:35] directly after the service in school
[2:06:37] room number one. And that's only for
[2:06:40] five minutes apparently to confirm some
[2:06:42] scheduling. God bless you. You're
[2:06:45] dismissed in Jesus name.
