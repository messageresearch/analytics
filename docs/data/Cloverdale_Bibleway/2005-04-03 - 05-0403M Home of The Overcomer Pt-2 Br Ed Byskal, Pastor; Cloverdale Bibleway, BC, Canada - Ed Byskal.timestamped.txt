[16:56] happy to have his parents here from from
[16:59] uh Belgium and we're happy to have them
[17:01] as well. God bless you and uh happy to
[17:03] have you here. Um any others that are
[17:06] visiting with us, we uh really happy to
[17:08] have you here and those are listening in
[17:10] on the internet. Um
[17:13] I you know when you're away you just
[17:16] really appreciate how uh what the
[17:18] brothers have done and I just want to
[17:20] give a real thanks uh this morning to
[17:22] brother uh Darren Hoffman and other
[17:24] brothers that have uh helped um him put
[17:28] the uh take us up to another level on
[17:31] the on the video and uh they've got uh
[17:35] taken it up to 300
[17:37] uh kilobits or whatever it is but uh
[17:40] it's uh tell It was nice sitting in the
[17:43] hotel Sunday morning and dialing in and
[17:46] seeing uh all your faces in a lot more
[17:48] clarity and uh not not blurry as it was
[17:51] before or as blurry as it was before. It
[17:53] was really wonderful and I really
[17:55] appreciate all the work that the
[17:56] brothers have done. Um, speaking about
[17:59] technology, uh, we have a couple of
[18:02] changes we want to announce and, uh,
[18:04] this shouldn't affect very many people,
[18:06] but if it does affect you, then find
[18:09] someone who is technologically literate
[18:11] and get them to help you, uh, into uh,
[18:15] the new century that we're in. Um,
[18:20] there's only one company in the world,
[18:23] excuse me, that is, uh, making cassette
[18:26] tapes any longer. So, we are moving from
[18:29] the old technology, uh, and leaving that
[18:32] behind. So, uh, as well, video tapes are
[18:35] being discontinued. So, we've
[18:37] discontinued making video tapes and
[18:40] audio cassettes. They're no longer going
[18:42] to be made.
[18:44] um it's really difficult to buy a
[18:46] cassette player anymore. So, um audio
[18:50] tapes are no longer going to be on loan
[18:52] out of the library. Um, and to take over
[18:57] from this, uh, MP3 CDs are now going to
[19:00] be available
[19:02] after every Sunday evening service, uh,
[19:05] for suggested donation of $2, but they
[19:08] will have Wednesday night service,
[19:10] Sunday morning, and Sunday night, an in
[19:11] MP3 on that CD if you want it. But
[19:14] having said that, it's way easier just
[19:16] to download it and doesn't cost us
[19:17] anything or it it cost us a lot less if
[19:20] you just get onto the internet and
[19:21] download whatever services it is you
[19:24] want to listen to. So, uh I know myself
[19:27] um downloading it, putting it on my
[19:30] iPod, and being able to listen to it on
[19:33] an airplane in a car is uh certainly a
[19:36] much better way to go. And I don't have
[19:38] to talk to anybody. I can just get on
[19:39] the internet and download it anytime uh
[19:42] I feel like it. So,
[19:44] we're going to post this up on the
[19:46] bulletin board, but uh if anybody is
[19:49] still in the old era, um you know, there
[19:52] are a number of very technologically
[19:54] literate who I know would be more than
[19:56] helpy.
[19:58] A lot of technologically literate people
[20:00] who would be more than help more
[20:03] than happy to help you. Sorry,
[20:08] having a hard time this morning.
[20:11] Must be the conversion to daylight
[20:13] savings time.
[20:18] Amen. Sister Marilyn has a song for us
[20:21] this morning. Sister Marilyn, why don't
[20:22] you come and uh

[22:42] again and again.

[23:25] of beauty we long to see here below. But
[23:31] time and treasure
[23:33] have kept us from making plans
[23:38] to go. But on that morning
[23:42] of rapture together we'll surely
[23:46] be. It will be worth it
[23:50] when his face we see.
[23:56] I want to stroll over heaven with you.
[24:03] Some glad day

[30:52] from you.
[30:54] We've gathered that we might worship
[30:56] you, Lord. We have gathered that we
[31:00] might affirm once again that we indeed
[31:04] desire to be your disciples. And as
[31:07] disciples, we wish to walk in your
[31:10] footsteps.
[31:11] Our Lord Jesus, when you were here, your
[31:15] movements were precisely the word of God
[31:18] in flesh, moving from place to place. We
[31:22] have come here Lord that we might be a
[31:26] real true genuine reflection of the word
[31:31] of God made manifest again in our time.
[31:35] Bless your people and I pray you'll bind
[31:38] every spirit oh God that would even seek
[31:42] to hinder in any way your children may
[31:46] every one that is present. I pray for
[31:48] them that they might be benefited, might
[31:52] be edified, lifted up, and may we be
[31:55] born upon the wings, oh God, of the
[31:59] eagle, and lifted up into the
[32:01] heavenlies. Father, I pray that you will
[32:04] touch each life, those that are
[32:07] especially in need of you, oh God. You
[32:10] know the heart, and now our hearts are
[32:12] open before you as an open book. I pray
[32:16] you'll minister to us each one. Anoint
[32:18] us. Anoint myself, Father, that I might
[32:23] be a living oracle of your word for you.
[32:29] And this entire day, oh God, and the
[32:32] service this evening, we dedicate it to
[32:35] you now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[32:37] Amen.
[32:39] Amen. God bless you. I'll ask you to
[32:44] open your Bibles and we will turn
[32:47] directly to the word. I'm going to read
[32:49] out of
[32:50] Revelation the 21st chapter
[32:56] and we'll start reading
[32:59] at verse one
[33:05] down through verse 7.
[33:12] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[33:16] for the first heaven and the first earth
[33:18] were passed away. And I, John, saw the
[33:21] holy city, New Jerusalem,
[33:24] coming down from God out of heaven,
[33:27] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[33:30] husband. And I heard a great voice out
[33:33] of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[33:36] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[33:39] will dwell with them, and they shall be
[33:42] his people, and God himself shall be
[33:45] with them, and be their God.
[33:50] And God shall wipe away all tears from
[33:52] their eyes.
[33:54] And there shall be no more death,
[33:57] neither sorrow,
[33:59] nor crying, neither shall there be any
[34:03] more pain, for the former things are
[34:06] passed away.
[34:08] And he that sat upon the throne said,
[34:11] "Behold, I make all things new." And he
[34:14] said unto me, "Write, for these words
[34:17] are true and faithful." And he said unto
[34:20] me, "It is done. I am alpha and omega,
[34:24] the beginning and the end. I will give
[34:27] unto him that is a thirst of the
[34:30] fountain of the water of life freely. He
[34:34] that overcomemeth
[34:36] shall inherit all things, and I will be
[34:39] his God, and he shall be my son.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? He that
[34:46] overcomemeth,
[34:50] he that overcomemeth has a special
[34:52] place.
[34:54] He will inherit all things.
[34:57] All things. And I am speaking to you
[35:01] this morning on the home of the
[35:04] overcomer. Once again, home of the
[35:07] overcomer.
[35:09] Before you're seated, turn to chapter
[35:11] 22.
[35:15] And we'll just read two verses 14 and
[35:19] 15.
[35:23] Blessed are they that do his
[35:26] commandments that they may have right to
[35:30] the tree of life and may enter in
[35:34] through the gates uh into the city. For
[35:37] without are dogs,
[35:39] and sorcerers, and whoreongers,
[35:43] and murderers, and idoltors,
[35:46] and whosoever loveth, and maketh a lie,
[35:51] those are without, and cannot enter. God
[35:55] bless you as you have your seats.
[36:06] a prepared place for a prepared people.
[36:12] God is not going to prepare a place
[36:15] and have
[36:18] uh a group of people that weren't
[36:20] prepared. That's why we're here this
[36:21] morning.
[36:23] I didn't know the song that uh Marilyn
[36:27] was going to sing. I understood late
[36:28] yesterday afternoon she was going to
[36:30] sing and but she wouldn't tell us what
[36:33] she was going to say. And of course, I
[36:34] didn't tell her what I was going to
[36:35] preach on,
[36:37] but we'll walk over heaven
[36:41] &gt;&gt; together some sweet day.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; And you know, in this life, I believe
[36:46] that we need to have our focus.
[36:49] We need to have a a goal,
[36:53] a goal that needs to be before us all
[36:55] the time. And I think more so as we're
[36:59] living, if we if we become immersed in
[37:03] just all the events of the day and the
[37:06] things that are happening around us, it
[37:08] it gets it gets fairly dismal. But when
[37:12] you can continue to see the the goal and
[37:16] and the hope for which you are actually
[37:19] living here for, it's not a drudgery.
[37:22] We're not just, you know, uh, scraping
[37:25] by from one day to the next, from one
[37:28] day to the next. And when I say scraping
[37:29] by, I don't mean a financially as much
[37:32] as perhaps emotionally getting through
[37:36] and the pressure of the day and the
[37:37] pressure of the age. A lot of times we
[37:40] can come into a into the house of God
[37:42] and and become uh it it becomes as
[37:47] though the life here and the life
[37:50] outside are two different lives. And
[37:52] really that shouldn't be. We're just
[37:53] here to be strengthened and we're here
[37:56] to receive wisdom so that when we go out
[37:59] we continue with the same life only at a
[38:01] higher level and strengthened and that's
[38:04] what it's all about. So that's why we
[38:07] are here. I I don't believe that we can
[38:10] speak about that the other land and the
[38:14] life that we will and are enjoying now
[38:17] but will enjoy in its fullness. Uh I
[38:20] don't believe we can speak about it too
[38:22] much. I believe that we need to be
[38:24] reminded and we should allow and pray
[38:28] that the Holy Spirit will be able to
[38:30] quicken our minds so that we will see
[38:32] with greater clarity and with more
[38:36] reality what it is truly all about. And
[38:40] as we look into the face of Christ, as
[38:43] we look into the the uh uh promises that
[38:48] he has made, I go to prepare a place for
[38:51] you. You know, he didn't say that in on
[38:54] the sermon on the mount, but when the
[38:56] message part when his message was
[38:59] breaking forth and the multitudes were
[39:01] leaving him and he was making his way to
[39:05] the cross and to the Gethsemane, that is
[39:08] when he began to tell his disciples
[39:10] these wonderful things. I'm going to
[39:13] prepare a place for you. You know, those
[39:15] were precious words. And I'm sure that
[39:18] those those apostles did not forget
[39:20] those words. and they mean so very very
[39:23] much to us. I've been in the message of
[39:27] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[39:29] and the earthly bride and my wife
[39:33] commented on my book is getting wore out
[39:35] but I I tell you what it's uh it just
[39:39] the pages may be getting wore out but
[39:41] what's written on them is just a greater
[39:43] reality all the time all the time as we
[39:46] see things and events moving in the way
[39:49] that they are.
[39:52] I would like to just go back and make
[39:54] some comments as we lay a bit of a
[39:56] foundation. We had a wonderful time. I
[39:58] enjoyed Wednesday night uh so much and
[40:02] uh even though it was more or less just
[40:04] foundational and the Lord willing, I
[40:06] probably will continue on with this uh
[40:09] at another at another service as well.
[40:12] But as we've been moving through this
[40:14] book uh this this message, and to me
[40:17] it's not a book, it's a message, the
[40:19] future home. I'm interested in the
[40:21] future home.
[40:23] I believe everybody should be from the
[40:25] youngest
[40:26] to the eldest that are here. We should
[40:28] be remembering.
[40:31] I want to draw your attention
[40:33] to
[40:36] uh this particular aspect
[40:39] and that is that God
[40:43] has made it so that
[40:47] uh at each stage of our I won't say our
[40:53] development but at each stage of of our
[40:56] existence
[40:58] he has made us with certain certain
[41:01] limitations
[41:02] and limitations in our surroundings and
[41:05] so on. And so for that purpose, I want
[41:08] to go back just a wee bit.
[41:11] It's a very wellestablished
[41:14] truth that we have come from an
[41:18] attribute of God.
[41:20] We have come from an attribute of God.
[41:23] However, the reason that we are here
[41:29] and
[41:30] the reason we are here as we are and we
[41:34] have a lot of limitations.
[41:36] I'm going to refer to that in a moment.
[41:38] But the reason we are here as we are is
[41:42] is in the divine purpose of God. We are
[41:45] here as we are this morning because God
[41:48] is what he is and
[41:52] he has us here the way we are in the
[41:55] condition that we are. We're in a
[41:58] physical body each one of us. We are
[42:01] made up of body and spirit and soul. God
[42:05] ordained that. There's no use becoming,
[42:08] you know, distressed or upset that we're
[42:10] made that way. We're made that way and
[42:13] we're made with certain uh
[42:16] idiosyncrasies. We're made with certain
[42:18] kind of uh an emotional makeup where
[42:23] even God never made a mistake in
[42:26] bringing us on down through the natural
[42:29] lineage.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; It was all in God's ordained plan. It's
[42:33] it it you say, well, you know, why do we
[42:37] why do I say it that way? Because so
[42:41] often Satan works on that human aspect.
[42:45] Oh, if I'd only been born this or if I'd
[42:47] only been something else or if I didn't
[42:49] have that or if I had this or if I had,
[42:52] you know, if I didn't have this thing to
[42:54] deal with or if I had that talent or if
[42:56] I and we envy someone else for the way
[42:59] they are. Oh, I wish I wasn't quiet. I
[43:01] wish I could express myself. I wish I
[43:03] was and the guy who does all the talking
[43:05] says, I wish I could shut up sometimes.
[43:07] and everybody wants to be something
[43:10] else. But if we can just finally say we
[43:12] are what we are by the grace of God, at
[43:15] least that's a starting point.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that we are what we're
[43:20] going to be, but we are what we are and
[43:22] then God can can continue to mold us and
[43:26] shape us.
[43:28] So now
[43:30] let's we came from the attribute. So we
[43:33] want to just refer back to God and some
[43:36] of these things are very fundamental for
[43:38] uh the most of you but remember we have
[43:40] a a continually
[43:43] uh maturing congregation. Young people
[43:46] are coming up and some of them need to
[43:48] hear these things perhaps for the first
[43:50] time or hear them again. Now the very
[43:54] name God
[43:56] which there are certain uh references
[43:59] that you are aware familiar with but we
[44:02] refer to him often as Elohim in the
[44:05] scriptures
[44:07] and uh and that refers to his
[44:09] attributes. Brother Brandham refers to
[44:13] God coming to Abraham when the three
[44:15] messengers came. Brother Brandham refers
[44:17] to him as Elohim and he manifested his
[44:20] attributes as certain attributes at that
[44:23] time. And in Genesis 1, it says, "And
[44:26] God created the heavens and the earth."
[44:28] Genesis 2, when man came on the scene in
[44:31] the physical form, then we have God as
[44:34] the Lord God or Jehovah. And this is the
[44:38] self-existent one. And Jehovah is made
[44:42] up of two words which means this the
[44:47] self-existent one
[44:50] that becomes or pointing that be that
[44:53] also uh let let me just read it here I
[44:56] the self-existent one
[44:59] and it's formed from another word that
[45:02] means to become to become something thus
[45:05] pointing to a continuous
[45:08] selfrevelation
[45:10] now That is that is the one we say we
[45:13] came from an attribute that was in God.
[45:17] So now we want to understand the very
[45:19] fundamental of that attribute is that
[45:22] God himself is made up. That is how he
[45:26] was. I won't say made up but his being
[45:29] that's the kind of being he is is one
[45:32] who is self-existent
[45:34] but also one who is self-revealing.
[45:38] And if we are made up of an attribute
[45:41] then that that very essence is within
[45:45] each one of us that is why we could say
[45:48] even in natural things for the if we see
[45:51] somebody and they don't have any they're
[45:54] just lethargic they have no desire to be
[45:58] anything no desire to achieve no desire
[46:01] to advance no desire we we think that's
[46:04] abnormal and it would be abnormal even
[46:08] physically ally if you have children and
[46:10] that child just has no ambition, doesn't
[46:14] want to em better themselves, doesn't
[46:17] want to learn anything, doesn't want to
[46:19] achieve, you say something's wrong with
[46:22] that child because it's just a normal
[46:25] thing that we believe in advancement, we
[46:28] believe in betterment, we believe in,
[46:30] you know, achieving things and that's
[46:32] the way we're made up. But spiritually,
[46:36] if anyone is here spiritually and we
[46:38] just say, "Oh, I'm just content where I
[46:41] am. I don't want to I don't want to
[46:42] advance anywhere." Then there's
[46:44] something wrong with us spiritually.
[46:46] Would you agree? I'm getting your
[46:49] thought. And so there is within everyone
[46:53] in fact is in some greater than others.
[46:55] There's just a driving force. There's an
[46:58] urge. There's a power. There's a zeal.
[47:01] You can name it whatever you want. You
[47:03] just want to be what God wants you to
[47:06] be. You want to grow. You want to
[47:08] mature. You want to be used of God. It's
[47:11] an everexpanding thing. It's within us.
[47:13] We want to be more like him. We want to
[47:16] speak. We want to have his nature. We
[47:18] want to have his character because
[47:20] that's the very essence of God himself.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; A self revelation. He wants to reveal
[47:29] himself and go and and and because you
[47:31] are an attribute of God, you have that
[47:35] essence, that character within you. That
[47:38] is one of I would say the main
[47:40] characteristics. Now, so the
[47:42] self-existent one who reveals himself.
[47:47] Now, brother Brandham makes some very
[47:49] powerful and glorious statements. He
[47:52] says now uh that God wanted to become
[47:56] material. He says in the future home God
[48:01] that he thought of himself as being
[48:05] human and that notice what he said. He
[48:09] thought of himself as because everything
[48:12] has to a we were a thought that thought
[48:16] became an attribute
[48:18] &gt;&gt; and it became a word. We're an attribute
[48:21] of God. And he thought of himself now as
[48:24] being human. And that that thought
[48:29] transmitted him down to be Jesus.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; You have to think about that for a
[48:36] while. He thought of himself, that great
[48:40] being filling all time and space, but he
[48:44] thought of himself as being human. And
[48:47] that thought transmitted him down to
[48:51] being Jesus Christ.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; When God was speaking to Moses and Moses
[48:58] asked, he wanted to know more of him. He
[49:01] wanted to see his glory. He said, "Thou
[49:04] canst not see my face,
[49:07] for there shall no man see me and live."
[49:12] He was not permitted to see his face.
[49:15] And yet God wanted to be known. He he
[49:21] had certain things that uh he loved
[49:25] fatherhood.
[49:27] He was going to have a family. And so
[49:29] all of this is part of this process. And
[49:32] in the message identified Christ of all
[49:35] ages said in this great God
[49:39] Elohim
[49:41] was attributes.
[49:44] There was attributes in there to be God.
[49:49] See, in the beginning, he wasn't being
[49:51] worshiped because there was nothing to
[49:52] worship him. But there was an attribute
[49:55] in there to receive worship.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; So, he created angels
[50:00] and the angels began to worship him and
[50:03] he became God. Right?
[50:05] &gt;&gt; There is attributes in him to be a
[50:07] father,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; attributes to be a son,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; attributes to be a savior,
[50:18] &gt;&gt; and attributes to be a healer. That's
[50:21] just exactly the way brother Brandon
[50:22] puts it. All these attributes
[50:25] was in God.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; And if we've ever got eternal life, you
[50:30] were in God's attributes. Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; If you ever had eternal life.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was so marvelous. Uh
[50:40] I was thinking about naturally the whole
[50:43] world's focus is on uh this pope that
[50:46] has just passed away.
[50:48] Uh it's not our focus, but the world is
[50:51] very gripped in it. And I was just in
[50:54] the midst of this message and brother
[50:56] Brandham is bringing out how the
[50:59] difference between the priest
[51:02] uh theologian
[51:04] Pharisee and as knowledgeable and as
[51:07] intellectual as he was and as religious
[51:10] as he was and as careful as he was much
[51:12] more than I would say most of us here
[51:16] there we we we don't want to be
[51:19] encumbered with the kind of laws and
[51:21] restrictions they had I think of Rabbi
[51:24] Richmond has said several times and
[51:26] Gerson has said it as well 613
[51:29] laws in the Old Testament that they keep
[51:33] and that would be very very difficult
[51:35] for the people of the Western world. 613
[51:38] they're continually keeping some kind of
[51:41] a law. This Pharisee kept the law and he
[51:45] was uh he was an intellectual.
[51:49] Brother Brandham makes the comment in
[51:51] future home. Uh saying in the beginning
[51:55] was the word and the word was made flesh
[51:57] and dwelt among us. Talks about the
[51:59] three stages. It was an attribute. First
[52:04] uh was God that he thought of himself of
[52:07] being human and that transmitted him
[52:09] down to be Jesus. Now that's a quote I
[52:12] just made. And now he said, "If you'll
[52:15] ever be there,
[52:17] you were there with him then."
[52:21] &gt;&gt; For there's only one form of eternal
[52:23] life. There can't be two forms of
[52:26] eternal life. There's only one, and
[52:28] that's God. And you had to be a part of
[52:31] God at the beginning.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Not what you just chose down here. You
[52:37] didn't choose it. Not what you chose
[52:40] down here, but what he chose you.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; See, that's where he chose you.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; And that is something you have to have
[52:49] very clear in your mind. He and that it
[52:51] wasn't after you got birthed by a
[52:53] natural sexual birth into a family and
[52:56] into a home. And finally one day you
[52:59] heard the heard the gospel preached and
[53:01] then God chose you. That isn't where he
[53:04] chose you. It was back when he even
[53:07] thought of himself of having a family.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And in his thoughts, he's thinking of
[53:14] having a family. And that is there then
[53:17] when he predestinated every son and
[53:20] daughter of God.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a tough one for a lot of
[53:23] people, but that's where he did it. And
[53:25] then the whole the whole uh economy of
[53:29] things began to unfold and people came
[53:33] onto the face of the earth and began to
[53:35] cover the face of the earth. But God had
[53:38] already predestinated in his mind and in
[53:42] his thought every last one.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now look at the priest."
[53:51] He said we find his uh he and he had
[53:55] drawn he had drawn uh uh some drawings
[53:59] on a on a blackboard and so he said and
[54:01] we find his priesthood at the bottom
[54:03] part here because he's referring to it
[54:05] and his back life back behind him
[54:10] his predestination back here here is
[54:14] sinful
[54:16] uh here's hell down here another place
[54:18] on his board now he said this little
[54:21] part here. He said it represents purity.
[54:25] He was a priest.
[54:27] He was an honorable man.
[54:31] That represented this. He also he said
[54:34] he had to be a good man
[54:37] or he couldn't be a priest. But you see
[54:40] how he got it, how he got his goodness
[54:43] was with an intellectual learning. said,
[54:46] "Now this little woman,
[54:49] her first life here, she was a
[54:51] prostitute.
[54:53] She was all marred up,
[54:57] but a way down here was just a little
[55:00] bit of understanding. A way down here
[55:03] was just a little bit of understanding."
[55:06] And this was it. I know when the Messiah
[55:08] cometh,
[55:10] he will tell us all things.
[55:13] Yes, sir.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; The priest could lay it all out.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; The priest knew it. The priest was a
[55:18] good man.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; He had not broken a law. He had not
[55:22] committed adultery. He had not lived a
[55:25] life that would be sinful or disgraceful
[55:28] to his nation or his religion or his
[55:31] church or synagogue. He had not done
[55:33] that. He had he he he lived a very
[55:36] careful and precise life. But when the
[55:38] word was made manifest before him, his
[55:41] intellectual said it's Beloveub.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Because and brother Brandham says why?
[55:47] Because his denomination said that
[55:51] &gt;&gt; and he was under that headship. So what
[55:54] they had told him is what he repeated.
[55:57] But within his realm of light living, he
[56:00] was a very very good man. But he when he
[56:03] saw the word manifest, he said that's
[56:05] Belub. Now the woman didn't have any
[56:08] that she didn't have that learning she
[56:10] didn't have that understand she didn't
[56:12] have those intellects her life was all
[56:14] marred all messed up just a terrible
[56:18] state of affairs and even worse now it
[56:20] had deteriorated she only knew one
[56:23] little thing I know when the Messiah
[56:25] comes
[56:27] &gt;&gt; I know when he comes he'll fix
[56:29] everything when he comes he'll tell me
[56:32] what it's all about
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and then when that line came told her,
[56:37] "You've had
[56:39] the one your husband you have now is not
[56:41] your husband.
[56:42] You've had five. That's right. But this
[56:45] one is not your husband,
[56:47] sir. I perceive you're a prophet." She
[56:50] was on her way.
[56:53] See, the priest perhaps perceived he was
[56:56] a prophet too in that second pull. But
[56:58] when he finally said, "I am he that
[57:00] speak to thee." And he says,
[57:04] and I thought this was so outstanding,
[57:07] the difference between the two of them
[57:09] was the difference between the two. The
[57:11] reason why one said it's Belobub and the
[57:14] other said it's Messiah. You couldn't
[57:16] get any further. One says that is prince
[57:19] of the devils and the other one said
[57:21] that is the Messiah, the anointed one of
[57:23] God himself. And the reason why they
[57:26] were so far apart is that when God
[57:31] thought within himself of having a
[57:33] family, he thought of her
[57:37] &gt;&gt; and she had representation.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And he said the priest had no
[57:41] representation because he was never
[57:43] there in the thought.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; So now we're talking about the plan
[57:52] a little bit. So you don't mind. I just
[57:54] kind of lay it out
[57:58] quietly without so much preaching it for
[58:00] the time being.
[58:02] The plan
[58:03] that God would become known by these
[58:06] attributes
[58:08] that would proceed from him and become
[58:12] his family
[58:14] and the faculty by which he would become
[58:16] known
[58:18] would be by revelation.
[58:21] All right. Now it would this was the
[58:24] plan that God who had this this the very
[58:30] nature the very essence of God is that
[58:33] he shall become known he shall increase
[58:36] in his revelation an everinccreasing
[58:39] revelation of him but I won't say the
[58:42] word revelation just yet he he was going
[58:44] to become known and but he chose the
[58:47] faculty by which he would become known
[58:49] and that would be not by a book,
[58:54] &gt;&gt; but by revelation.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You've heard me say it, those of you
[58:58] that have been around many years, but
[59:00] others who have not,
[59:02] I've asked this question many times, and
[59:04] it's worth it's worth really pondering.
[59:08] Why didn't God
[59:11] have Adam write the book of Genesis
[59:16] rather than wait for centuries and have
[59:18] Moses right? Wouldn't Adam by our own
[59:22] thinking have a much better uh wouldn't
[59:26] it be much easier for him to tell
[59:29] exactly what happened in the garden and
[59:33] what the serpent did and how he came and
[59:35] how he approached his his bride and all
[59:38] of these things. Wouldn't it have been
[59:39] easier for him? You'd have thought so.
[59:42] But he but rather he does it by
[59:44] revelation and reveal to Moses all those
[59:48] things because revelation revelation is
[59:52] more accurate than what you see with the
[59:54] natural eye. Revelation can penetrate
[59:58] deeper than what you hear with your ear
[1:00:01] and pen and revelation can can make a
[1:00:04] reality within your soul much much
[1:00:08] clearer vision than your mind can think.
[1:00:11] Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I could ask
[1:00:17] why didn't Jesus
[1:00:19] when he called his disciples and he knew
[1:00:23] that apostle
[1:00:25] another another apostle by the name of
[1:00:27] Saul I have stood on the steps where
[1:00:31] they said that the that that Paul the
[1:00:34] apostle in Jerusalem was being taught by
[1:00:38] Galo and I can tell you that Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ walked walking in and and about
[1:00:42] Jerusalem had to walk past those steps
[1:00:45] many many times and may well may well I
[1:00:49] don't say that he did but may well have
[1:00:52] seen that group of people where where
[1:00:54] where apostle Paul was sitting at the
[1:00:56] feet of Galiel learning all of these
[1:00:59] things and Jesus allowing him to become
[1:01:02] stuffed full of doctrine and religion
[1:01:06] and learning the intricacies of all of
[1:01:08] the law Jesus allowing knowing that
[1:01:12] rather than teaching him lip to ear what
[1:01:16] he wanted him to hear, but rather he
[1:01:18] would meet him on the road to Damascus
[1:01:20] and say, "I'm Jesus."
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Why didn't Jesus walk up to him at those
[1:01:25] steps while he was being stuffed full of
[1:01:27] religion? Say, "I'm Jesus." He could
[1:01:30] have said it then, but he said it later
[1:01:32] and revealed to Apostle Paul. Paul said
[1:01:35] he received it by revelation. Why?
[1:01:38] because he could write by revelation
[1:01:40] more than what he could write from
[1:01:42] hearing it from the lip to the ear.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; We could say, why didn't Jesus tell John
[1:01:50] what he wanted to write for the book of
[1:01:52] Revelation rather than let him be
[1:01:54] isolated on the aisle of Patmas and
[1:01:57] there hear it I hear hear it in a in a
[1:02:00] different way through a different
[1:02:02] channel and wrote the book of Revelation
[1:02:04] which has held the world spellbound ever
[1:02:06] since.
[1:02:08] by revelation. Revelation that is the
[1:02:12] faculty and I can tell you there's there
[1:02:14] are people
[1:02:16] probably sitting here who understand
[1:02:20] mentally
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; those things that have been taught in
[1:02:23] the message and but it has not become a
[1:02:27] revelation to them. And you say well how
[1:02:30] does a revelation come? By the spirit of
[1:02:33] God. It has to be something that comes
[1:02:35] from God. And then when it comes from
[1:02:37] God, it's so real to you. It doesn't
[1:02:41] matter what your friends do. It doesn't
[1:02:44] matter what they say. It doesn't matter
[1:02:46] how they act. That has nothing to do
[1:02:49] with it because you have not just a
[1:02:51] channel, but you have been taught by God
[1:02:54] on a onetoone basis.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; You have a revelation.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] And that is the faculty by which God
[1:03:08] would become known is by revelation. It
[1:03:11] isn't even by by myself preaching here
[1:03:15] today. By the preaching of the gospel,
[1:03:18] people will be saved. That is true. But
[1:03:21] on the other hand, the Holy Spirit has
[1:03:24] to take what's being preached and bring
[1:03:26] it to you in a personal way, on a
[1:03:30] personal level.
[1:03:32] And when you catch it that way, that's
[1:03:34] why it's so important for people to come
[1:03:37] prepared to a service with our heart
[1:03:40] made ready. It's so important that the
[1:03:42] worship as we worship and our our
[1:03:45] spirits are quietened and we're made
[1:03:48] ready for the word of God. That's why
[1:03:50] it's so important that you are prayerful
[1:03:52] about coming to the house of God. say,
[1:03:55] "I'm coming to hear what I need to hear
[1:03:58] so that I can be I can be made uh more
[1:04:02] ready, more fit, more uh prepared for my
[1:04:07] life."
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the agent that would cause
[1:04:12] revelation
[1:04:14] is the Holy Spirit. So number one,
[1:04:19] the very
[1:04:21] basic character or nature, the very name
[1:04:24] of God declares that he's a
[1:04:27] self-existent one who continuously
[1:04:31] reveals himself.
[1:04:33] Number two, his the faculty by which he
[1:04:38] has
[1:04:40] made himself known or will make himself
[1:04:42] known is by revelation,
[1:04:45] not by learning of the intellect. And
[1:04:47] number three, the agent who will cause
[1:04:51] the revelation is the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Remember those three if you would
[1:04:57] please.
[1:04:58] Now,
[1:05:02] God,
[1:05:04] he I want I wish you're you're listening
[1:05:08] very very good, but I want to I just
[1:05:10] want to say this. I'll be making
[1:05:12] statements here. I want you to hang on
[1:05:14] to them because they'll have a they'll
[1:05:17] tie together and have a much deeper
[1:05:19] meaning when we get further on in the
[1:05:21] service.
[1:05:23] Now, brother Brandham says that God
[1:05:28] that sin never entered sin never
[1:05:31] originated on earth. He said it
[1:05:34] originated in heaven.
[1:05:36] Now,
[1:05:38] I'm just going to bring this out to you
[1:05:40] immediately because this is where we're
[1:05:43] going to.
[1:05:45] And yet there is a region
[1:05:50] within the heavenlies
[1:05:52] that sin cannot enter.
[1:05:56] Otherwise, it would be very confusing
[1:05:58] for me. I don't want to go to heaven
[1:06:01] where sin might come again. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in waiting through
[1:06:07] this life and fighting the battles and
[1:06:10] and and to live victorious to go
[1:06:12] someplace where sin might erupt again.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; And so this Bible is very very clear.
[1:06:19] That's why we read the scripture. There
[1:06:21] is a place where whorongers and
[1:06:26] murderers and dogs and the unclean can
[1:06:31] not enter.
[1:06:33] Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; The region where the angels were and the
[1:06:40] regions where Lucifer was, he he was
[1:06:45] able to rebel. He was able to declare
[1:06:49] war. He was able to rise up against God
[1:06:53] and have iniquity fill him and be cast
[1:06:56] out.
[1:06:58] And the region of the earth was open to
[1:07:02] him. He didn't go to Pluto or Mars or
[1:07:05] some other place. He was cast to the
[1:07:08] earth of all place. I wish he'd been
[1:07:10] cast into the sun,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; but he was cast to the earth. That also
[1:07:17] is part of the plan because this God who
[1:07:21] is ever increasingly unveiling himself
[1:07:24] and manifesting himself had attributes
[1:07:27] of being a savior. And so he said, "I'll
[1:07:29] let my enemy be a uh be a deceiver and
[1:07:33] I'll save them
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; because my salvation is greater than his
[1:07:40] deception.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; My salvation is greater than his sin.
[1:07:45] My love is greater than his death.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Though they would die in a physical, my
[1:07:52] love will raise them up in a
[1:07:54] resurrection.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; So he creating creating a Lucifer and
[1:08:04] allowing him the opportunity to rebel
[1:08:09] and to take with him a fallen host of
[1:08:12] angels.
[1:08:13] there was a a a region where that could
[1:08:17] happen.
[1:08:20] So I'm talking about
[1:08:22] places that have limitations
[1:08:26] and that could take place and it did
[1:08:28] take place
[1:08:31] and that's an integral part of the plan.
[1:08:34] Even today
[1:08:36] there is a place that you can't see.
[1:08:41] We are here in such a in such a limited
[1:08:46] way. You know, we can only see so much.
[1:08:51] We can only hear so much.
[1:08:54] We have the five senses which the
[1:08:57] prophet said we have them to contact
[1:09:01] this earthly world, this life. That's
[1:09:04] what we have them for.
[1:09:06] I'll I'll come back to that in a few
[1:09:08] moments.
[1:09:11] But even today,
[1:09:14] Satan
[1:09:15] can accuse you and does so before God.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; You don't see him. You don't hear him.
[1:09:24] But I I I assure you it is happening
[1:09:28] even this morning.
[1:09:31] He stands there and in Revelation 12:10,
[1:09:34] "And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:09:36] heaven, now is come salvation and
[1:09:39] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:09:42] the power of his Christ for the accuser
[1:09:46] of our brethren is cast down which
[1:09:49] accuse them before God day and night."
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. In a future home, prophet said,
[1:09:55] "Both the heavens and the earth now is
[1:09:59] contaminated with devils
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; that can accuse us before God
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; right now. That is why the heavens are
[1:10:09] going to be on fire
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; and the accuser is going to be done away
[1:10:14] with.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; They can accuse us before God." He said,
[1:10:19] "But Jesus is there.
[1:10:22] I can't see it.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; My human faculties don't enable me to
[1:10:27] see it or to hear it.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; But the scriptures telling me that
[1:10:32] prophet is telling me that he's there
[1:10:34] and there's accusations coming against
[1:10:37] you.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Accusations. The accuser is accusing us
[1:10:41] before God.
[1:10:44] But Jesus is there
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; in that realm also. And Jesus is here.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; But it's not limited to this. But we're
[1:10:51] limited to this. But he's not.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; I wish you could believe that.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And he's there.
[1:11:05] And Satan is accusing you.
[1:11:09] And Jesus is there.
[1:11:12] And he says further,
[1:11:15] he intercedes for us.
[1:11:22] There's still a warfare going on and
[1:11:25] there's fingers being pointed and Satan
[1:11:28] is accusing you because he is that's his
[1:11:30] basic nature as an accuser
[1:11:33] and when you see it come down here then
[1:11:35] you know exactly where it originated
[1:11:39] and but Jesus is there interceding
[1:11:43] and he goes on to say while the accusers
[1:11:46] keep pointing a finger he said they did
[1:11:49] this, they did this, they did this, but
[1:11:51] the blood still covers.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; He came to redeem the elected that he
[1:11:57] foresaw.
[1:12:03] Now,
[1:12:04] God wanted to become material. Is it all
[1:12:07] right if I preach slowly?
[1:12:10] God wanted to become material. His
[1:12:14] objective was to become known
[1:12:17] in the unveiling of God. But in him was
[1:12:19] thoughts and he wanted to become
[1:12:21] material. See, I didn't just take one
[1:12:24] quote. And you'll see how this is so uh
[1:12:28] so fits
[1:12:30] your situation, our present life. He
[1:12:33] says then he spoke a word and the word
[1:12:36] was materialized and the whole picture
[1:12:39] from Genesis to Revelation said there's
[1:12:42] nothing wrong it's Elohim.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the language that brother
[1:12:49] Brandham used is absolutely
[1:12:51] precision.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Even how he interchanged whether it was
[1:12:55] God or Elohim because it it he said it
[1:12:59] was God. All right. But it was Elohim
[1:13:01] because Elohim speaks of his attributes.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; It was Elohim materializing
[1:13:09] so he can be touched.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Feel
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; and in the millennium there's Elohim
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; sitting on the throne with all of his
[1:13:20] subjects around him that he
[1:13:23] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:13:25] the world. You see the complete circle.
[1:13:28] There was God
[1:13:30] who was not God but the great being who
[1:13:34] would become God because in his thoughts
[1:13:37] he was going to have he was going to
[1:13:39] have worship and so he created those
[1:13:42] beings that would worship now in all and
[1:13:44] then he wanted to become material
[1:13:46] himself. He wanted to be so he could be
[1:13:48] uh felt and so he could be uh touched.
[1:13:52] And then this and then he goes on to
[1:13:53] say, "And in the millennium, there's
[1:13:55] Elohim with all of his subjects. It's
[1:13:58] gone through a whole cycle now." And
[1:14:00] there they are around his throne. That's
[1:14:03] what he had in his mind.
[1:14:05] And all this process going continual,
[1:14:08] continual, and all this warfare that
[1:14:11] took place and all of this sin and all
[1:14:14] of this uh world that we have right now.
[1:14:18] And it comes to a conclusion. And he has
[1:14:21] them those that he predestinated before
[1:14:23] the foundation of the world.
[1:14:27] The apostle John said of Jesus and we
[1:14:31] will say the apostle John is saying of
[1:14:35] that attribute of God that God projected
[1:14:39] down and he thought that he he would
[1:14:41] become human. So he transmitted that
[1:14:44] down to earth. This is what John said of
[1:14:46] him.
[1:14:48] that which was from the beginning
[1:14:51] which we have heard.
[1:14:54] Now I want you to focus on the senses,
[1:14:57] the human senses that God has given us.
[1:15:00] Five
[1:15:02] senses of the body and the five senses
[1:15:05] of the spirit that we hear, we see, we
[1:15:10] taste, we smell, and we feel. And
[1:15:15] Apostle John says, "Now you see God from
[1:15:17] the beginning. He thought of himself as
[1:15:21] being human. And so he transmitted
[1:15:24] himself down and became Jesus." When
[1:15:27] Jesus was here, one of his apostles
[1:15:30] said,
[1:15:32] "That which was from the beginning which
[1:15:34] we have heard."
[1:15:36] Because God gave the faculty of hearing
[1:15:39] to the human. And John says, "We heard
[1:15:43] him which we have seen. We saw him with
[1:15:48] our eye and which we looked upon." And
[1:15:51] he said, "And our hands have handled
[1:15:54] him.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; We saw him. We heard him. We handled
[1:15:57] him. We felt him.
[1:16:02] For the life was manifested, and we have
[1:16:05] seen it. and we bear witness and show
[1:16:07] unto you that eternal life which was
[1:16:10] from the father and was manifested unto
[1:16:13] us.
[1:16:16] Now
[1:16:18] say okay that's why he was transmitted
[1:16:20] down. Why did we come? Well, brother
[1:16:23] Brown tells you why you come.
[1:16:27] You become from the attribute
[1:16:32] to the flesh to be tempted.
[1:16:36] That's his statement.
[1:16:40] You become
[1:16:42] from the attribute
[1:16:44] to this flesh to be tempted.
[1:16:52] That should make you rejoice.
[1:16:56] Praise God. I came to be tempted
[1:17:00] right from the very attribute
[1:17:03] God transmitted you down
[1:17:06] to be tempted.
[1:17:10] This too is a part of God's plan.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; We were brought forth with senses
[1:17:20] of the body
[1:17:22] and the spirit.
[1:17:25] Each realm having its own limitations.
[1:17:31] I want you to think about those
[1:17:32] limitations for a moment.
[1:17:36] God brought us down into this realm
[1:17:41] and uh we have we have certain
[1:17:43] limitations. There's only so much that I
[1:17:46] can feel. There's only so much pain I
[1:17:49] can experience. When it reaches a
[1:17:51] certain level, I'll perhaps start
[1:17:53] passing out. There's only so much I can
[1:17:56] see. I can only see a certain distance.
[1:18:00] And it all has limitations.
[1:18:02] And mentally we have limitations.
[1:18:07] Uh and some have much more capacity
[1:18:10] mentally than another
[1:18:13] emotionally. Some can take a lot and
[1:18:17] some can hardly take anything. They
[1:18:19] don't have the same capacity. Some run
[1:18:22] into a little something and oh just just
[1:18:24] they start going to pieces. Next person
[1:18:27] can't understand it at all. They just
[1:18:29] keep plowing ahead going on going on.
[1:18:33] Doesn't mean it's limitless. They might
[1:18:35] reach their limit too. But we we are our
[1:18:39] bodies and our spirits have limitations.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; And God put us allowed us to come in
[1:18:49] this form to be tempted.
[1:18:53] And let me tell you, there isn't a
[1:18:56] person in this auditorium
[1:18:58] that isn't going to be tempted, isn't
[1:19:01] going to be tested to the very limits,
[1:19:04] one way or another. Because God is
[1:19:08] proving himself, and he's proving this
[1:19:11] attribute. Jesus was tempted in all
[1:19:15] points like we and yet without sin. And
[1:19:20] God is allowing, he allowed Job to be
[1:19:23] tempted to the very limits. And you
[1:19:26] would have thought he would have broke,
[1:19:28] but he didn't break. And God is going to
[1:19:31] allow the bride to be tempted to the
[1:19:33] very limit. He'll allow every kind of
[1:19:36] doctrine. He'll allow every kind of
[1:19:38] belief. He'll allow every wind. He'll
[1:19:41] allow every pressure. He'll allow every
[1:19:44] trial to prove that his bride is going
[1:19:47] to be victorious
[1:19:49] cannot be deceived.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; It's going to prove it.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Going to prove that this message that
[1:20:01] the world hates is the very thing that's
[1:20:04] going to give the body of Christ
[1:20:06] strength in this hour.
[1:20:13] Now,
[1:20:19] and who's this Melzdc?
[1:20:23] And I know it's hard when I read for you
[1:20:25] to just perhaps follow, but that's why I
[1:20:27] like to go a little slowly.
[1:20:29] He said, "Now we see the attribute sons
[1:20:33] of his spirit
[1:20:36] have not yet entered into the word form
[1:20:38] body. So we're in one form have not yet
[1:20:43] entered not yet entered into the word
[1:20:46] form body but a theophony. He said this
[1:20:50] body this body is subject to the word
[1:20:54] and waiting for the earnest of the
[1:20:57] change
[1:21:01] the change of the body. Now he said now
[1:21:03] the difference to bring a difference
[1:21:05] between us and Christ. The difference
[1:21:07] between him and you as a son he was at
[1:21:13] the beginning the word an amorph body.
[1:21:17] He came in and lived in that in the
[1:21:21] person of Melzdc.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; We never had no more Melzdc because he
[1:21:29] became Jesus Christ.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] Melzdc was the priest but he became
[1:21:36] Jesus Christ. And now you bypass that.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; So we got to come back to something we
[1:21:42] bypassed.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; You bypassed that because in that form
[1:21:48] it's another form. He knowed all things.
[1:21:54] In this form we don't know all things
[1:21:58] but in that form he knew all things
[1:22:07] and you and I have this in red so it
[1:22:09] it'll be
[1:22:12] I can emphasize it and you have never
[1:22:15] been able to know that yet
[1:22:22] you come like Adam like me, you became
[1:22:27] from the attribute to the flesh to be
[1:22:30] tempted. He says it again.
[1:22:34] We We've never been in that form yet.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; We're going places, friends.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; We're going someplace. The unbeliever is
[1:22:44] not going there. The critic is not going
[1:22:47] there. The doubting and fearful is not
[1:22:49] going there. The believer is going
[1:22:51] there.
[1:22:56] Is this all right
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; if I preach like this this morning?
[1:23:00] But but when life here is finished,
[1:23:05] if this earthly tabernacle
[1:23:08] be dissolved, we have one already
[1:23:11] waiting.
[1:23:13] That's where we go.
[1:23:16] My point this morning is we are going to
[1:23:18] a place that doesn't have the
[1:23:20] restrictions that we have right now.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have those limitations. We're
[1:23:26] moving towards that. And then he says
[1:23:30] then we can look back and see what we
[1:23:33] done.
[1:23:35] Now we don't understand it. We have
[1:23:38] never become the word. We've just become
[1:23:41] the flesh man, not the word. That's what
[1:23:44] he's saying. That doesn't take away from
[1:23:46] the fact he says that the word has
[1:23:48] become flesh in us. We're talking about
[1:23:51] this realm that we're in and the
[1:23:53] limitations that it has. Now, God gave
[1:23:56] us these five senses which I won't dwell
[1:23:58] on much much, but he gave us these five
[1:24:01] senses which he says was to contact this
[1:24:05] world. But he says, "But then your
[1:24:07] inward man is the spirit which has two
[1:24:11] senses which is faith and unbelief."
[1:24:17] In the message shalom
[1:24:19] says, "If you're blind,
[1:24:22] you can't see.
[1:24:25] Then you can feel one another
[1:24:29] or hear one another."
[1:24:33] And the earthly senses declare one
[1:24:36] another. So if I was blind, I couldn't
[1:24:40] see you, but I could feel you. And that
[1:24:43] earthly sense would declare something to
[1:24:46] me to declare that you are there. I
[1:24:49] might not be able to see you, might not
[1:24:50] be able to
[1:24:52] be very specific about your features,
[1:24:57] but I've lost sight. But I have a sense
[1:25:01] that will make a declaration to me.
[1:25:04] Here's a person. Here's an individual.
[1:25:08] But in this
[1:25:10] age that we're in and to me now, two
[1:25:12] things are coming together here. And
[1:25:15] that is the day. This day that you have
[1:25:19] been called to live in my friend, my
[1:25:22] brother, my sister, is so vastly
[1:25:26] different from any other age.
[1:25:30] This was the age that that if you go
[1:25:34] into the countdown and the message if
[1:25:37] you see for just a moment how this age
[1:25:39] would be rise higher and higher we can
[1:25:44] say in its industrialization or in its
[1:25:47] technology in its advancement but just
[1:25:51] as it has advanced I'm sure you'll agree
[1:25:54] with me as it's advanced the
[1:25:56] advancements
[1:25:58] have in so that they appeal to the flesh
[1:26:03] man,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; to the senses,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; you know, those of you that fly, you fly
[1:26:12] a lot here at the Vancouver airport,
[1:26:16] when you get your ticket and get your
[1:26:19] boarding pass and they have to go down,
[1:26:22] if you're going international, you have
[1:26:23] to go through immigration. You know
[1:26:25] where they send you? They send you
[1:26:27] through the dutyfree.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I can tell that I'm coming to the
[1:26:34] duty-free long before I get there. Do
[1:26:36] you know why? It just has all kinds of
[1:26:39] marvelous odors that are coming out.
[1:26:42] It's all the latest perfumes.
[1:26:45] And you know,
[1:26:47] they have such seductive names to those
[1:26:50] perfumes.
[1:26:52] passion,
[1:26:54] you know, all these names of Why is
[1:26:58] that? Because it's tantalizing. It's
[1:27:01] appealing to the sense of the smell and
[1:27:04] you smell it long before you get there.
[1:27:07] They try to make it, oh, this will be so
[1:27:09] enticing. And you just put and you know
[1:27:13] I'm almost ashamed of myself but uh
[1:27:19] sometime I put on some shaving lotion.
[1:27:22] So sometimes I don't but I'll go and and
[1:27:26] so they say what kind do you want? I
[1:27:27] don't know what kind I want. I want some
[1:27:29] shaving lotion and they have some is
[1:27:31] just so powerful I don't like a be
[1:27:34] smelling it all day long. Get sick of
[1:27:37] that. I want something that's a little
[1:27:39] bit lighter than that. Okay, smell this.
[1:27:43] Okay, put that down. Smell this. Pretty
[1:27:46] soon they all smell the same. Well, let
[1:27:48] me smell that other one for a time. I
[1:27:50] was here here some time ago says, "Well,
[1:27:53] here let's let's just do this." And she
[1:27:55] was doing something. I said, "What does
[1:27:56] that do?" She says, "It kills all the
[1:27:57] smells because it kills all the smells.
[1:27:59] You can start all over again."
[1:28:01] Oh, boy. And says, "What kind of
[1:28:04] civilization am I in? Smell this one.
[1:28:08] Give it to my wife. You smell it.
[1:28:13] I know it's it's a little bit humorous.
[1:28:15] It happens to be our world.
[1:28:19] Has to be our world. Taste this. Oh,
[1:28:24] come on. Some of you folks I've eaten
[1:28:26] with you. Where are we go? Oh, we should
[1:28:28] go. Brother Rod Bergen knows all the
[1:28:30] best places. Whenever I want taste, I
[1:28:32] call Brother Rod. Where do we go? Oh,
[1:28:34] there's a place I know right now he's
[1:28:36] already tasting it. Oh, get this. Get
[1:28:38] this. It's got just a hint of curry.
[1:28:40] It's got a hint of this. It's got a hint
[1:28:41] of something else. Cuz we're all that
[1:28:43] way. We all think about it, you know,
[1:28:45] about what it tastes like and what it
[1:28:47] smells like and what it looks like. And
[1:28:50] we go to the market and everything's
[1:28:52] dazzling, you know, and all the colors
[1:28:54] and a new color and a new this and a new
[1:28:56] that just in this age.
[1:29:00] Oh, we could say, well, many, many
[1:29:02] centuries ago, you know, they had all
[1:29:03] the lovely fabrics of Egypt and all of
[1:29:05] these things. That is true. But in this
[1:29:07] age, the sounds and the sounds mixed
[1:29:11] with the lights and the beat. Oh,
[1:29:14] getting it all just exactly homogenized
[1:29:16] just right. And so what you're seeing
[1:29:18] and what you're hearing and and the
[1:29:20] whole atmosphere, what it's trying to do
[1:29:22] is to get an entrance to your spirit,
[1:29:25] get an entrance to to involve you.
[1:29:29] to captivate you
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; to capture your mind and capture your
[1:29:33] thoughts. It could only be in this age
[1:29:36] and so that so that people then and then
[1:29:39] they began to get it with things that
[1:29:40] you could taste and you could get into
[1:29:42] the drug scene and the drug scene would
[1:29:45] do something with your mind and then you
[1:29:47] could see and you were so sensitized. I
[1:29:50] won't say you were but that is the age
[1:29:52] that we're in. So sensitized that they
[1:29:54] begin to drift off into another realm.
[1:29:59] that wasn't real.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And finally, we had the whole drug
[1:30:05] culture that don't want the real.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Let me just live up here in Lulu land
[1:30:11] someplace. I don't want the reality. I
[1:30:14] don't want the responsibilities. I, you
[1:30:16] know, and they get off into something
[1:30:18] that was unreal. But it was in this age
[1:30:22] that God,
[1:30:24] Satan had his had developed his Eden to
[1:30:28] such a place. But God, he's not going to
[1:30:31] be behind in the astronaut age. And he
[1:30:34] would send a messenger that would start
[1:30:37] to tell the people, you're locked into
[1:30:39] five senses. You got five senses to
[1:30:42] contact this world. But I'm going to
[1:30:44] tell you about a sixth one. I'm going to
[1:30:47] tell you about a sixth one that you have
[1:30:49] access to. I'm going to tell you about a
[1:30:52] sixth one that you don't feel, but it is
[1:30:55] here. I'm going to tell you about
[1:30:57] another dimension that you're not in,
[1:30:59] but you can tap into it, and it's a real
[1:31:03] one. I'm going to tell you about a
[1:31:05] dimension you can reach into by faith
[1:31:07] and bring a power out of there and heal
[1:31:10] your body
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; and deliver you from the situation that
[1:31:16] you're in. I'm going to tell you about
[1:31:17] another one and you're going to rise up
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; in a high place.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to come in contact with the
[1:31:28] unseen world.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:31:34] going to tell you about senses that go
[1:31:36] beyond your five.
[1:31:38] And he did.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Many are in this message that have never
[1:31:42] reached into it. But you need to. It's
[1:31:44] available to you. Don't live below your
[1:31:46] right. Don't live below the place that
[1:31:49] God has because that's just a stepping
[1:31:52] stone to go to the one that he has fully
[1:31:56] prepared for you. And I believe it's
[1:31:59] ready.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I believe it's completed. I believe the
[1:32:02] only thing that's missing is the bride
[1:32:04] of Jesus Christ. That's what's missing.
[1:32:07] I believe the hosts of heavenly beings
[1:32:10] that are there are in anticipation
[1:32:13] perhaps even more than we are waiting
[1:32:16] for this group. Oh, when this redeemed
[1:32:19] group, imagine the angels talking to one
[1:32:22] another. Just think when we're going to
[1:32:24] see the redeemed, the redeemed of all
[1:32:27] the ages come through those gates of
[1:32:30] pearl.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, they're going
[1:32:34] to say, "We're going to see people that
[1:32:37] were born in sin.
[1:32:39] We're going to see people that Lucifer
[1:32:42] that Lucifer had under his control." And
[1:32:45] and our Lord Jesus, hallelujah, our God
[1:32:49] who created us delivered them.
[1:32:54] We're getting ready for the delivered
[1:32:56] people.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; We're getting ready for the resurrected
[1:33:00] people.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; That death swallowed up.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; We're getting ready to see resurrected
[1:33:07] bodies that were reduced to ashes and
[1:33:10] those that were burned at the stake.
[1:33:12] We're getting ready to see those atoms
[1:33:15] being called back by the great creator.
[1:33:19] My brother, my sister, if this is just a
[1:33:22] myth, we should shut the doors and go
[1:33:24] home and eat, drink, and be merry. But
[1:33:26] if this is a place you're going to,
[1:33:29] that's something you want to see and
[1:33:30] hold in your heart.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:46] It's age of heightened senses,
[1:33:50] an age of enchanted enchantment.
[1:33:56] It's also in the age where we're so
[1:33:58] susceptible.
[1:34:01] I feel
[1:34:03] I feel
[1:34:05] sorry a lot of times for young people
[1:34:08] and young couples and so on.
[1:34:11] The pressure of this age is so great
[1:34:15] and they make things to look so
[1:34:18] beautiful,
[1:34:19] so marvelous that they are, I can say,
[1:34:24] almost almost irresistible.
[1:34:27] And they say, "You can have this now.
[1:34:30] You don't have to pay for it. You don't
[1:34:33] have to put a penny down. We won't
[1:34:35] charge you any interest for a year."
[1:34:40] I marvel at those signs, too. I wonder
[1:34:42] how do they know in a year it's not in
[1:34:44] the Salvation Army.
[1:34:48] And I also marvel at some of the stuff
[1:34:49] would even last a year.
[1:34:52] But it's no wonder people, you know,
[1:34:56] just lay their cards on the line.
[1:34:59] If you put your cards down, you can get
[1:35:01] anything.
[1:35:04] You don't have any cards. You don't know
[1:35:07] what they are,
[1:35:09] credit card,
[1:35:12] Master,
[1:35:16] Visa,
[1:35:19] American Express.
[1:35:21] Got them all. Say, "Well, we won't take
[1:35:24] that one." Okay, I'll give you another
[1:35:26] one.
[1:35:28] Sorry, this comes up unauthorized. Okay,
[1:35:31] don't worry about that. Here, try this
[1:35:32] one.
[1:35:34] I can see some of you folks have
[1:35:36] experienced that.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; That's just life.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know when I started out working
[1:35:43] in the dark ages?
[1:35:46] We never even had one of these. Never
[1:35:48] saw one of these. I got a little we
[1:35:50] envelope about this big and it was a
[1:35:54] little bit of cash in there. Very
[1:35:55] little. I was paid good money but very
[1:35:58] little of it.
[1:36:05] is my father-in-law who later become my
[1:36:07] father-in-law.
[1:36:10] Some people think I was lucky to marry
[1:36:11] his daughter after what he paid me. It
[1:36:13] was amazing that I married her.
[1:36:17] Really? Anyway,
[1:36:22] I thought maybe that's the best way to
[1:36:23] get a raise.
[1:36:27] Didn't work.
[1:36:30] So anyway, we've been slugging it along,
[1:36:37] but that's that's what we have. We're
[1:36:40] we're faced with it. And it's not going
[1:36:41] to get less.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to get
[1:36:46] e even more so because that's the age
[1:36:48] that we're in. And it'll be an age and
[1:36:51] we'll find ourselves under that kind of
[1:36:54] pressure. That's what brother Brandon
[1:36:55] was talking about in the church ages.
[1:36:57] That's the pressure of this age to to be
[1:37:01] able to hold the line
[1:37:03] to live within our means
[1:37:06] to not be so encumbered
[1:37:08] so that we it starts to affect our
[1:37:11] spiritual life. And so this what this
[1:37:14] what we have to watch for you you you
[1:37:16] know I'll just tell you what you know uh
[1:37:18] I just say bit about these credit cards
[1:37:20] you know people get a little quiet on
[1:37:22] that. They're they're all right. But I
[1:37:24] tell you what, I found a lot of people
[1:37:25] in trouble over them. Say they start
[1:37:28] getting tens of thousands of dollars and
[1:37:31] they don't realize. They say, "Well, you
[1:37:33] know, I'm only paying 12% or 13 or 15%,
[1:37:36] but that's after you paid tax." Maybe
[1:37:39] you paid 30% tax and 15% there. It's 45%
[1:37:43] before you paid anything. And that's
[1:37:46] just a enormous enormous amount of
[1:37:48] thing. I'm not here giving financial
[1:37:50] advice because that's not my place. But
[1:37:52] that's the age that we're in.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And no wonder the angels are going to
[1:37:56] rejoice. Say, "Here they come." Well, I
[1:37:59] want to get on with my message because I
[1:38:02] just about said something. It would be
[1:38:03] one of my thunder thunderbolts at the
[1:38:05] end.
[1:38:09] part and parcel of this declaration,
[1:38:15] the declaration I refer to
[1:38:18] in this consummation of the ages,
[1:38:21] we have a prophet messenger of
[1:38:24] Revelation 10:7. But let me say this,
[1:38:27] Revelation 10:7 would have nothing to
[1:38:29] say if Revelation 10:1 didn't descend
[1:38:33] first.
[1:38:34] If he didn't descend with an open book,
[1:38:37] Revelation 10:7 has no message. And so
[1:38:40] what was in the contents of the book?
[1:38:42] Listen now. This was Christ who fought
[1:38:45] this great warfare
[1:38:47] and defeated Lucifer. Lucifer is cast
[1:38:50] out. He does his job. Brings us to the
[1:38:52] age that we're in. I'm just taking
[1:38:54] quantum leaps now. And then Christ
[1:38:56] himself comes to those elected that were
[1:38:59] in the mind of God. this attribute,
[1:39:02] these attributes which are here. And he
[1:39:04] comes to begin to
[1:39:08] what shall I say not entice
[1:39:11] but to super heighten their expectations
[1:39:16] to give them an anticipation and to make
[1:39:19] it so real to bring it so close to speak
[1:39:22] of the rapture and to speak of the
[1:39:24] change and to speak of the resurrection.
[1:39:26] You know something? I've never heard
[1:39:28] I've heard messages since I've been a
[1:39:30] boy. I've never heard anybody speak of
[1:39:31] the resurrection the way Brother
[1:39:33] Brandham brought it up. I've never heard
[1:39:34] anybody speak of the change of the body
[1:39:36] the way he brought it. I never heard
[1:39:38] anybody speak about he'll call the Adams
[1:39:40] back. Never heard anybody say there'll
[1:39:41] just be a sweep that'll go over you.
[1:39:43] Never heard why are those things being
[1:39:45] spoken now? Why are they being declared
[1:39:47] now? Because this was the hour. This was
[1:39:49] the time. And you are the people.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; He's allowed you brought you to this
[1:39:54] place. You're the people that this is
[1:39:56] for
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; to let you know you've been brought here
[1:39:59] into this. You've been brought here
[1:40:00] under the restriction of these five
[1:40:02] senses of the spirit and five senses of
[1:40:06] the body. But but he he brought you here
[1:40:09] and and God in the end time begins to
[1:40:12] open your understanding to another
[1:40:14] realm, another spirit. And it's
[1:40:15] something that it's not spiritualism,
[1:40:17] but brother Brandham says you anybody
[1:40:19] like that be called a mystic
[1:40:22] because you're it's not as though you're
[1:40:25] venturing into something that you're not
[1:40:26] supposed to. In the Old Testament, they
[1:40:28] weren't supposed to go to wizards and go
[1:40:31] to those kind of fortune tellers and
[1:40:33] things. We don't believe in it. We don't
[1:40:36] believe in it. Maybe Satan can inspire
[1:40:38] somebody. That has nothing to do with
[1:40:39] us. And that's why they called brother
[1:40:41] Brandham, they called him mind
[1:40:42] readading. And then he pointed back to
[1:40:45] Jesus knew their thoughts.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; You see, so it just depends what depends
[1:40:49] what category you're in.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. My oh my, how the time is slipping
[1:40:55] away on us in the message.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like you to notice, let's just
[1:41:00] talk about 107 for a moment.
[1:41:04] Notice what brother Brandham declares in
[1:41:06] the presence of the resurrected Christ.
[1:41:09] Now, could you believe for a moment?
[1:41:11] Now, I want to really pin this down
[1:41:13] because there may be some that really
[1:41:14] question about it.
[1:41:17] If a man stands here, and my physical
[1:41:20] senses says he's a man about 5'9, maybe
[1:41:24] 145, 150 lbs. His name is William
[1:41:27] Brandom. He's standing there and he says
[1:41:30] that there's a a light. It's the same
[1:41:32] light that was in the burning bush.
[1:41:36] And he says,
[1:41:39] "He who you see in this picture,"
[1:41:42] there's the one with the not the cloud
[1:41:45] but the halo taken in the Sam Houston
[1:41:48] auditorium.
[1:41:49] At the day, now listen to his
[1:41:50] declaration. At the day of judgment,
[1:41:53] when the secrets of all hearts are
[1:41:55] disclosed,
[1:41:57] you'll see that this is the truth.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:01] He's not standing
[1:42:04] two feet from where I am right now.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And I wish you could feel or know once
[1:42:12] the sense that sixth sense.
[1:42:17] Oh brother, sister, he's not standing a
[1:42:21] man born with five senses of the body
[1:42:25] and five of the spirit but built in a
[1:42:28] certain way. So the subconscious and the
[1:42:31] conscious come right together and
[1:42:32] doesn't go to sleep for this for this
[1:42:35] dream. It wasn't a dream. It was a
[1:42:37] vision standing right there saying he's
[1:42:39] about 2 ft from me now 24 in. And he's
[1:42:42] saying I wish you could feel. I wish you
[1:42:45] could feel.
[1:42:47] There is a feeling
[1:42:50] but the bodies we didn't have the
[1:42:52] capacity for it. But he is alerting us.
[1:42:56] We're being sensitized.
[1:42:59] We're being encouraged. We're being
[1:43:02] brought to an understanding. Something's
[1:43:04] happening in our minds. Oh, God. I would
[1:43:08] have known this before, but now I'm
[1:43:10] being told by a man that he's not two
[1:43:13] feet. There's another realm. He's
[1:43:15] calling it a sixth dimension or six
[1:43:17] sense. Oh, God. Oh, God. I I seek the
[1:43:22] Holy Spirit. I seek that the spirit of
[1:43:25] God will give me that that ability. Let
[1:43:29] my faith reach out at least I believe
[1:43:31] it.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I can't see you with these eyes, with
[1:43:38] this limitation, but I believe you're
[1:43:41] right there. Oh, let me just reach
[1:43:43] through and touch you.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Let something within my heart, something
[1:43:48] within my soul reach through and touch
[1:43:50] you. I know that you're right there.
[1:43:53] My brother, sister, that's where things
[1:43:56] start to happen in a church even this
[1:43:57] morning. That's where things start to
[1:43:59] happen when people say, "I believe what
[1:44:01] the pastor's saying. I believe it with
[1:44:03] all my soul. I believe that you are
[1:44:05] right here.
[1:44:09] My mind can't grasp it.
[1:44:12] My hands can't handle you the way
[1:44:16] Apostle John said, but I know that
[1:44:19] you're right here.
[1:44:23] And he says
[1:44:26] that six sense
[1:44:28] when you're breaking from one into
[1:44:30] another from one dimension from one
[1:44:33] category into another
[1:44:36] and you know the feeling now here here
[1:44:40] brother Brandham is entering into
[1:44:41] another realm of feeling and his feeling
[1:44:45] was absolute assurance of his
[1:44:48] resurrection.
[1:44:51] Oh, there was he was beyond any
[1:44:54] question. He was beyond anybody to raise
[1:44:57] a doubt. He was beyond any intellect.
[1:45:00] Beyond any any under religious
[1:45:03] denomination or there wasn't wouldn't be
[1:45:06] a theologian in the world that could
[1:45:09] cause him to doubt because at that
[1:45:12] moment there was a feeling coming within
[1:45:15] him and he said it was a feeling of
[1:45:17] assurance.
[1:45:20] of the resurrection. You see friends
[1:45:22] that what made him so absolute with his
[1:45:25] declaration and I like you to know of
[1:45:28] the resurrection and his power
[1:45:31] everything becomes little to you then
[1:45:35] his his glorious wonderful magnificent
[1:45:39] lovely Lord Jesus Christ praise notice
[1:45:43] what he's saying in his presence
[1:45:47] the feeling of assurance has come I wish
[1:45:50] you could see I wish you could feel what
[1:45:53] I'm feeling right now. There is a six
[1:45:55] sense.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I say, oh God, I I glorify and praise
[1:46:02] your name for Elijah prophet that came
[1:46:05] and stood and made us to know these
[1:46:08] things. And though I have never seen it,
[1:46:11] I I believe it.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And perhaps I have never felt it like he
[1:46:16] was feeling it right then, but I believe
[1:46:18] in it. And by believing in it, perhaps I
[1:46:21] can taste it also and feel it.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[1:46:32] "Everything becomes little. His
[1:46:35] glorious, wonderful, magnificent,
[1:46:39] lovely Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be unto
[1:46:43] him now and forever. The rose of Sharon
[1:46:46] and the lily of the valley, the morning
[1:46:48] star, the fairest of 10,000. He is the
[1:46:51] one. Notice what he's saying to him.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's not talking to the crowd
[1:46:56] now. He's talking to him.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, I hope the
[1:47:04] Holy Spirit comes and even allows you to
[1:47:06] feel what I'm feeling, a sense of his
[1:47:09] presence, because I've been standing
[1:47:11] here declaring in front of you, I
[1:47:12] believe it.
[1:47:15] How many believe it?
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; You declare you believe it.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; I believe it is him. The lovely Lord
[1:47:22] Jesus,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; the rose of Sharon,
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; the fairest of 10,000.
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:28] Hallelujah.
[1:47:30] Worthy of all praise. The magnificent
[1:47:33] one, the resurrected Christ. There's an
[1:47:36] assurance that comes into the heart. An
[1:47:39] assurance we know that he raised from
[1:47:41] the dead.
[1:47:43] and we know he's present. And in that
[1:47:46] atmosphere, he went on to say this with
[1:47:50] the one standing right there, not 24 in
[1:47:52] away. All other religions are bogus.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; All other religions are false.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Only Jesus Christ has the right and he
[1:48:04] is the son of the living God.
[1:48:06] [Applause]
[1:48:10] And then you ought to hear what happens
[1:48:12] after that.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of that one, the
[1:48:16] lovely one, the fairest of 10,000, the
[1:48:19] rose of Sharon. How beautiful, how
[1:48:21] lovely. And all other religions are
[1:48:23] bogus.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; All other religions are false. And here
[1:48:28] he comes and then unveils the secret of
[1:48:30] the heart. Who's speaking? that pillar
[1:48:33] of fire speaking through that human
[1:48:35] vessel.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't have any question about
[1:48:42] that, friends. I hope you have no
[1:48:44] question about that.
[1:48:47] God's messenger in constant contact with
[1:48:51] another dimension, another world.
[1:48:59] This service be a little bit different.
[1:49:03] be something for you to go home and
[1:49:04] think about. God is raising
[1:49:09] raising the level of our our our
[1:49:11] understanding.
[1:49:13] He's sharpening and honing our senses,
[1:49:17] our God-given ability to reach beyond
[1:49:20] the boundaries of this mortal life.
[1:49:24] There is a six sense
[1:49:27] that the believer is able to contact
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; and to move into the realm of the
[1:49:32] supernatural.
[1:49:35] Now
[1:49:36] just to just to bring this to you and
[1:49:39] I'm going to close soon
[1:49:41] just to bring this to you in a very
[1:49:45] he said there is six senses but he said
[1:49:47] five senses really
[1:49:51] but faith makes the six sense and we
[1:49:53] live now in here what we will call the
[1:49:56] three dimensions. We know there's
[1:49:58] another dimension which is the fourth
[1:50:00] dimension because because science has
[1:50:03] probed have probed into it and found it
[1:50:08] and that fourth science is that fourth
[1:50:10] dimension is the sound waves and the
[1:50:13] radio and the television and access to
[1:50:15] that says it was here when Elijah was
[1:50:17] here. It was here when Moses was here.
[1:50:20] It was here. It's been here when Jesus
[1:50:22] was here. But science had not probed
[1:50:24] into it and not had and had not got into
[1:50:27] it yet. But he said they've probed into
[1:50:29] it and found it. He said and it's radio
[1:50:34] at that time. He says there there's no
[1:50:36] senses of our body. I'm going to go very
[1:50:38] careful. I'm not reading a quote.
[1:50:40] There's no senses of our body
[1:50:44] can detect radio or television over the
[1:50:47] ether wave.
[1:50:49] Yet listen now. Yet through us now is
[1:50:55] coming people's voices.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Not through the building only. He says
[1:51:00] that other places but through you
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; penetrating.
[1:51:06] Your body can't stop those kind of waves
[1:51:11] through you is going voices
[1:51:16] passing straight through you. Somebody
[1:51:18] on the other side pick it up. Say I
[1:51:20] don't know. Well, I do. That's exactly
[1:51:23] what he said.
[1:51:26] Think about that. Now, you have a
[1:51:28] limitation.
[1:51:31] You say,
[1:51:33] "I'd like to catch that. You haven't got
[1:51:36] the facility."
[1:51:38] But he says, "Science." Now, science
[1:51:42] science produced a crystal.
[1:51:45] Science produced a radio. Science
[1:51:48] produced an antenna.
[1:51:50] Science produced a tube and that catches
[1:51:53] that wave
[1:51:56] that even penetrates you and goes
[1:51:58] through you.
[1:52:00] And that's not just the place he said
[1:52:01] it. Right through here is coming
[1:52:04] television pictures. But we have nothing
[1:52:08] in us.
[1:52:11] No way at all to contact that in
[1:52:15] ourselves.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. talking about in us now, not out
[1:52:19] here someplace. Says it's passing
[1:52:22] straight through here. It's passing
[1:52:23] through you.
[1:52:25] But you don't have anything in you to
[1:52:29] catch that voice
[1:52:32] or that sound.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have anything in us. We can't
[1:52:36] catch that picture. It takes a crystal
[1:52:39] or some sort, a magnet to contact that.
[1:52:43] But it speaks that there is another
[1:52:46] dimension. It is only speaking that
[1:52:50] there is another dimension.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And now that's four dimensions. I think
[1:52:55] in the fifth dimension is where the
[1:52:58] sinner goes.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; I'm just starting my service. I'm sorry.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to keep you all that time,
[1:53:05] but I just we'll give give you an idea
[1:53:08] where we're going to go.
[1:53:12] Even the fourth dimension,
[1:53:16] it may pass through you, but you can't
[1:53:18] catch it
[1:53:20] because God in this life, in this mortal
[1:53:24] realm, has given you no ability to lay
[1:53:27] hold of it. And yet science has given
[1:53:31] that and you can go home and turn that
[1:53:33] radio on and it will pick it up and it
[1:53:35] doesn't startle you. It would have blown
[1:53:37] the minds of the earlier early saints.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; It would have shocked them. It would
[1:53:42] have scared them. Said what kind of
[1:53:45] magic is this voices? Where is it coming
[1:53:48] from? And if you tried to tell them this
[1:53:50] is coming from the other side of the
[1:53:52] globe said what what kind of thing is
[1:53:56] this? But now the prophet is saying he's
[1:53:59] brought all that in. Science has brought
[1:54:01] that. But there is
[1:54:04] another dimension. There is another one.
[1:54:07] You're not surprised there's radio waves
[1:54:09] here. You're not surprised there's
[1:54:11] television pictures going through here,
[1:54:13] that there's colors going through here,
[1:54:14] that there's voices going through here,
[1:54:16] and the prophet says bodies,
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; images are going through here right now.
[1:54:22] You have no facility to contact it, to
[1:54:24] stop it, or anything else. And some of
[1:54:26] them we wouldn't want to stop.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Let them keep on going. Let them go to
[1:54:31] their destination. But the prophet is
[1:54:33] saying there is another dimension.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And science can't catch it.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; It can't catch it. It's a sixth
[1:54:43] dimension. It's a sixth realm.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you as we close says there's
[1:54:54] a fifth one. An unbeliever,
[1:54:58] the doubter, and the critic go to that
[1:55:02] one. They that make and love a lie, they
[1:55:06] can't enter. There's a realm they can't
[1:55:08] enter like we can't enter that where the
[1:55:10] voices are going through. We can't enter
[1:55:12] no matter how much you desire. You could
[1:55:14] fast, you could pray, you could do
[1:55:16] everything. You can't enter that fourth
[1:55:17] dimension. It hasn't been made for you.
[1:55:20] But and the fifth one you don't want to
[1:55:22] enter. And there are many. And the
[1:55:24] prophet says they are caught.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; He described it as a nightmare.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; He's he's in between.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:36] He he can't go back to life
[1:55:40] and there's no blood for him to go into
[1:55:42] the presence of God. And he's caught in
[1:55:45] the nightmare. And the encyclopedia says
[1:55:47] he's swallowed up
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; into oppression.
[1:55:52] He's swallowed up into a terrible place
[1:55:56] in a nightmare and he can't wake up. And
[1:56:00] the prophet says they're caught in a
[1:56:02] nightmare. I know every funeral you go
[1:56:06] to, the preacher puts them in heaven,
[1:56:08] but most of cases they're a liar.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; He's not going to heaven.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; The Pope just passed away. I can assure
[1:56:17] you and they read they read John the
[1:56:19] 14th chapter. I can assure you this
[1:56:22] place that our blessed Lord Jesus made
[1:56:25] for the righteous and the redeemed. He's
[1:56:28] giving answer today perhaps for the
[1:56:30] multitudes and the millions that have
[1:56:33] perished
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; under their cruel rule
[1:56:37] and under the lies of their system and
[1:56:40] their tradition. Oh, I tell you, they
[1:56:42] took the ring off his finger, call it
[1:56:44] the fisherman's ring. There's no such a
[1:56:46] thing. Peter never had a ring like that
[1:56:49] at all. He knew nothing about all that
[1:56:51] punk, all that tradition, all of that
[1:56:53] nonsense, all of that bondage, all of
[1:56:56] that fear.
[1:56:59] Thank God for deliverance.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; And he's caught. Amen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the what our prime
[1:57:11] minister, the president, or the other
[1:57:13] kings of queens of the world say about
[1:57:16] his greatness and being the apostle of
[1:57:19] peace. I tell you, my brother, that was
[1:57:21] for a purpose. He journeyed indeed. He
[1:57:24] journeyed 3/4 of a million miles to
[1:57:26] bring people under the skirts of Rome.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; But there is a place
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; and today he's caught
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; in a nightmare.
[1:57:38] And every unbeliever will be caught in
[1:57:41] that nightmare. I plead with you. I
[1:57:44] intercede on your behalf. Whatever you
[1:57:46] do, if you've questioned it, don't you
[1:57:48] get caught.
[1:57:51] You hear, brother Biscll, today, don't
[1:57:53] get caught in that place where you can't
[1:57:56] go back to life because you've lived it
[1:57:58] out and you can't go into the presence
[1:58:00] of God because you have you have denied
[1:58:02] and disbelieved the word which he sent.
[1:58:08] But there is a land.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; There's a landlord
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; and there's a place
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; and there's many mansions. There's a
[1:58:19] body. There's a place that doesn't isn't
[1:58:22] restricted to these five senses.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And I say run run for the kingdom of
[1:58:27] God.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Run for that place with everything
[1:58:30] that's in you. Don't let anything of
[1:58:32] this life hold you back or hinder you or
[1:58:35] restrict you. or deter you.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; It brings me almost makes me distraught
[1:58:41] when I think there's people that I've
[1:58:43] preached to, people I poured my soul out
[1:58:46] to and sit and become unmoved and won't
[1:58:49] let the Holy Ghost move them forward and
[1:58:52] make a confession out of their mouth. I
[1:58:54] need God in my life. I need a
[1:58:56] transformation.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Don't get caught.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; You're moving through this life all too
[1:59:05] quickly.
[1:59:06] very very quickly. Young old were moving
[1:59:09] very very quickly,
[1:59:12] very quickly.
[1:59:19] And when the Christian dies,
[1:59:22] he goes into a sixth dimension.
[1:59:25] And to break it down,
[1:59:27] when a man has a nightmare,
[1:59:30] he's not altogether asleep, and neither
[1:59:32] is he awake. He's between sleep
[1:59:37] and awake.
[1:59:39] And that what may when I wake up
[1:59:43] that glorious realm
[1:59:46] or when by the change of this body we
[1:59:49] enter that glorious realm in this
[1:59:51] rapture.
[1:59:52] Just think he's caught in a nightmare.
[1:59:55] Let me close quickly. I have so much
[2:00:00] Jesus told and Jehovah's Witness tried
[2:00:02] to tell you it's a parable. It doesn't
[2:00:04] matter if it is a parable. Jesus said
[2:00:06] there was a certain rich man
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; and there was a beggar and his name was
[2:00:11] Lazarus. That's why it's not a parable.
[2:00:14] He named the man. It was Lazarus. And he
[2:00:17] laid at the rich man's gate.
[2:00:20] And the rich man, he had feeling. He was
[2:00:22] dressed
[2:00:24] in glorious garments of fine linen.
[2:00:29] And he ate taste sumptuously every day.
[2:00:35] And uh beggar had sores feeling
[2:00:40] and ate tasted the crumbs that fell from
[2:00:44] the rich man's table. And the dogs came
[2:00:48] and licked his wounds.
[2:00:51] And it happened that the beggar died
[2:00:55] and was carried by the angels
[2:00:58] into Abraham's bosom.
[2:01:02] And the rich man died also
[2:01:05] and in hell.
[2:01:08] And the scripture says
[2:01:12] he spoke.
[2:01:14] So wherever he went into that fifth
[2:01:16] realm, he could still speak
[2:01:19] and he could see. He looked across a
[2:01:22] great chasm and he actually saw the
[2:01:25] beggar in Abraham's bosom. He had the
[2:01:28] capacity to realize he is in the bosom
[2:01:32] of Abra. He's held in a marvelous place.
[2:01:37] Oh,
[2:01:39] and he yearned
[2:01:41] for Lazarus's position.
[2:01:44] and he could speak. Father Abraham,
[2:01:50] let Lazarus come.
[2:01:54] He had his intelligence.
[2:01:56] He had his voice. He had capacity after
[2:02:00] he died. And the people were saying
[2:02:03] perhaps accolades over his over his tomb
[2:02:06] and his grave. What a great man this
[2:02:08] was. How much he gave to the to the
[2:02:10] synagogue and the temple. And oh, he
[2:02:13] even put a pillar. We got his plaque at
[2:02:15] the bottom. This pillar was built by
[2:02:17] this certain rich man. And all the honor
[2:02:20] that they were giving him. And at the
[2:02:22] same time while they're giving him that,
[2:02:24] he's there in Hades screaming out.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Send Elijah, I mean, send Lazarus.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Just with a drop of water from my
[2:02:36] tongue. For I am tormented.
[2:02:40] and that torment I'd have to go into.
[2:02:42] He's swallowed up in torment, but
[2:02:45] there's no escape
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; and he can't go back and he can't go.
[2:02:51] And Abraham said, "Son, when you were in
[2:02:55] life,
[2:02:56] you had all the luxuries
[2:03:00] and Lazarus had none.
[2:03:05] And besides all of this, besides all of
[2:03:08] this, there is a great gulf
[2:03:12] fixed.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Fixed. That's right.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; So that those
[2:03:19] that are there
[2:03:21] cannot pass here
[2:03:24] and those that are here cannot pass
[2:03:27] there.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; It's fixed.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; And a prophet came in our language and
[2:03:33] says it's a nightmare.
[2:03:36] swallowed up,
[2:03:39] but he still could see.
[2:03:42] And I'll get to the sixth dimension at
[2:03:44] the next service.
[2:03:46] I'll tell you, there's a lot of feeling.
[2:03:49] There's a lot of sight. And this man
[2:03:51] could see and he could speak and he
[2:03:54] could feel in that realm he was in. But
[2:03:58] he had to be informed and he had
[2:04:00] intelligence that he could grasp
[2:04:04] what Abraham was saying.
[2:04:07] And besides all of this,
[2:04:10] there's a great gulf, a chasm, a great
[2:04:13] chasm that's fixed.
[2:04:15] The same God
[2:04:18] that set everything in motion, fixed a
[2:04:20] bor boundary between the fifth and the
[2:04:24] fourth and the fifth and the sixth and
[2:04:28] they are caught there.
[2:04:34] It's full
[2:04:36] and filling up
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; with those that are denied
[2:04:42] had their opportunity.
[2:04:44] Well, then let Lazarus go. Somebody must
[2:04:47] go. He even had concern. The prophet
[2:04:49] said he even wanted to preach.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Let somebody go and tell my brethren,
[2:04:56] tell my loved ones, don't come here.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; And Abraham spoke and said, "They have
[2:05:07] the prophets.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; They have." And today they would say
[2:05:12] they have the ministers.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; And someday if you end up there, God's
[2:05:18] going to answer you and tell you. You
[2:05:21] had brother Biscll,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; you had brother Lance Laroo,
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; you had brother Tom Ray,
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; you had brother Tony Abba, you had
[2:05:29] brother Dier, you had these others, and
[2:05:31] you had a host of those that sought to
[2:05:34] encourage you. You had godly parents.
[2:05:35] You had somebody You had people that
[2:05:37] have wept for you and prayed for you and
[2:05:40] and advised you and laid their heart out
[2:05:42] for you. They did everything. Don't get
[2:05:44] caught.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; That's not a fear trip. That's the
[2:05:52] truth.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; The devil tried to tell you, brother Bis
[2:05:55] trying to lay a fear trip. That's the
[2:05:56] truth. Don't you deny that devil's
[2:05:59] voice.
[2:06:02] You think this is fear that there's no
[2:06:04] fear like slipping into slipping into
[2:06:07] eternity knowing it's not right. Knowing
[2:06:09] you're not right,
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; knowing you heard it over and over and I
[2:06:14] would appeal and plead to everyone.
[2:06:18] Don't go out of this service.
[2:06:21] Do you have that assurance within your
[2:06:23] heart and soul?
[2:06:25] All is well.
[2:06:27] All is well.
[2:06:30] Let us bow our heads.
[2:06:38] Oh God, my soul
[2:06:42] so moved.
[2:06:44] Lord Jesus, your Holy Spirit speaks.
[2:06:48] Your Holy Spirit cries out.
[2:06:52] and how you have told us your prophet
[2:06:54] declared.
[2:06:57] Death changes nothing. What we are right
[2:07:00] now, we would be on the other side.
[2:07:05] If it was not for your grace, oh God,
[2:07:08] and for your pleading and for your
[2:07:10] dealing with us,
[2:07:13] we would not even have opportunity. I
[2:07:15] pray father
[2:07:18] for all that are under the sound of my
[2:07:19] voice and all whose hearts are open now
[2:07:22] and all whose
[2:07:24] hearts are searching
[2:07:27] and those who know that they are not
[2:07:29] right with you. Those that know they
[2:07:31] have not surrendered.
[2:07:33] Let them know, oh God, now if the Holy
[2:07:36] Spirit is dealing with them, you are you
[2:07:38] are striving with them that they will
[2:07:40] not be one of that number caught in this
[2:07:43] awful nightmare.
[2:07:46] Father, I pray
[2:07:48] for the same purpose, Jesus, that you
[2:07:50] told it. For whatever purpose it was
[2:07:53] that you told it, I tell it again today.
[2:07:56] Pray you'll deal with every heart,
[2:07:58] Father,
[2:08:00] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:08:05] I wonder who God is speaking to.
[2:08:09] And I wonder whether you want to come
[2:08:12] and stand for prayer, whether you want
[2:08:13] to stand where you are.
[2:08:17] And if you say, "Oh,
[2:08:20] brother Ed,
[2:08:23] there's been other times that I've felt
[2:08:26] moved,
[2:08:28] but somehow today it's a reality to me.
[2:08:32] Today, I want to I don't want to take
[2:08:35] any chance. Today I want to give my all.
[2:08:38] I want to surrender.
[2:08:41] I would just urge you, it's not
[2:08:44] complicated.
[2:08:46] Your heart is an altar. You can do it
[2:08:49] right where you are. But I believe it. I
[2:08:53] believe it's important to make a public
[2:08:54] declaration.
[2:08:56] Stand, raise your hand, do whatever you
[2:08:58] need, or come down here.
[2:09:01] There's nothing sacred about this place
[2:09:03] around the altar. Don't think you're
[2:09:05] getting something special here. It's
[2:09:07] just that people will more free and able
[2:09:09] to pray with you.
[2:09:12] I'd like to sing all is well. All is
[2:09:14] well.
[2:09:15] All in.
[2:09:17] [Music]
[2:09:21] All is well.
[2:09:27] We have heard.
[2:09:31] Shalom.
[2:09:33] All is well.
[2:09:37] [Music]
[2:09:39] There is a place
[2:09:43] a perfect resting
[2:09:47] inner veil.
[2:09:50] So rest little bride rest for all is
[2:09:57] well.
[2:09:59] Let's stand. All is well.
[2:10:12] We have heard the message shalom.
[2:10:18] All is well.
[2:10:24] There is a place
[2:10:27] of perfect rest
[2:10:29] [Music]
[2:10:32] in her veil.
[2:10:35] So rest little pride rest for all is
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:45] going to sing I feel the pull.
[2:10:53] You know when a father or mother would
[2:10:56] instruct their child, son or daughter,
[2:11:00] let them know that there are certain
[2:11:02] dangers that they may confront. There is
[2:11:06] a danger in this message,
[2:11:08] a very grave danger. And the danger is
[2:11:11] that you hear the strongest preaching
[2:11:14] you'll hear anywhere.
[2:11:17] And you hear it again and again. You
[2:11:19] hear it over and over. And the danger
[2:11:22] is, lest you hear it and say, "Well, I
[2:11:25] you know, there'll be another time." I
[2:11:28] want to tell you that rich man wish he
[2:11:31] had another time. There isn't another
[2:11:33] time. There is another time. And
[2:11:36] furthermore, some have said, "Well, I
[2:11:38] felt this way before." And God, hear me,
[2:11:42] God has no obligation to ever speak to
[2:11:44] you again. He may not be speaking to you
[2:11:47] now, but if he is, if he is, that is the
[2:11:51] moment to move. And God intends you to
[2:11:53] move fast. Amen.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; And if he never
[2:11:59] if he never has spoken to you or if he
[2:12:01] has spoken to you in the past and you
[2:12:04] feel and you know within your heart, I
[2:12:07] say to you lovely people, people that I
[2:12:10] love with all my heart and soul, you and
[2:12:14] your you yourself only you know what's
[2:12:17] between you and God. Only you know that.
[2:12:22] But I would I would encourage those you
[2:12:25] that have heard
[2:12:27] maybe you're just living a life just
[2:12:29] holding a standard
[2:12:32] but it's not a real true
[2:12:35] shall I say of your own
[2:12:39] of your own desire. I don't know what
[2:12:41] you desire,
[2:12:43] but whatever you do, and you all know
[2:12:46] who you know in your own heart, cuz God
[2:12:49] is true. He'll witness. Whatever you do,
[2:12:52] don't ever get caught in that place.
[2:12:55] Don't get caught.
[2:12:57] How many of their way to the the other
[2:13:00] dimension, the sixth dimension, and
[2:13:02] you'll pray with me with these people
[2:13:05] here?
[2:13:08] I feel the
[2:13:15] hear the call
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:21] and your spirit
[2:13:24] moving me.
[2:13:27] Give me my all.
[2:13:33] Speak to me. Glor.
[2:13:37] [Music]
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing it just once more. I
[2:13:57] feel the
[2:14:01] Oh, God.
[2:14:03] hear the call
[2:14:09] and his
[2:14:13] me
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:22] to
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:27] I agree
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; and take control.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; I feel the
[2:14:45] maybe right where you're standing, you'd
[2:14:47] like to raise your hands,
[2:14:51] raise your heart. I don't need your
[2:14:53] response. You need it.
[2:14:56] Whoever God is dealing with, you need
[2:14:58] it. Just remember, it's between you and
[2:14:59] him. And I am appealing to you with all
[2:15:03] that is in me. Hear the voice of the
[2:15:05] Holy Spirit. Not my voice, but the voice
[2:15:08] of the Holy Spirit. And I know that he's
[2:15:10] speaking because I know I had no
[2:15:13] intention of ending the service right
[2:15:14] here. I know that it is him. He's guided
[2:15:16] me to stop it right here. Let the people
[2:15:20] respond. Those I'm speaking to. Let me
[2:15:22] deal with them. Oh Lord Jesus, sending
[2:15:26] your holy, Holy Spirit, I pray you'll
[2:15:29] move, oh God, amongst the congregation,
[2:15:33] seeking out that one, Lord Jesus, not
[2:15:36] you are the shepherd. You're the great
[2:15:39] shepherd. It is not us who seeks them
[2:15:41] out, but you seek them out. And Lord,
[2:15:44] let the lamb cry out to the shepherd,
[2:15:47] save me. Oh, heal me. Deliver me. Bring
[2:15:52] me out of this steep place that I'm in.
[2:15:54] Bring me out of this terrible place.
[2:15:56] Bring me out of this bondage, Lord.
[2:15:57] Deliver me, oh Savior. I pray that
[2:16:01] you'll reach in, oh Lord, and loose the
[2:16:03] prison bars, burst the prison bars, and
[2:16:06] bring out the slave. Bring out the the
[2:16:08] one that's being held captive by Satan,
[2:16:11] in the name of Jesus Christ. I come
[2:16:14] against every demon force that would try
[2:16:17] to invade, that would try to accuse the
[2:16:20] brethren, that would try to hold captive
[2:16:23] the sons and daughters of God. May the

[2:19:06] them in your heart, Lord. Hold them in
