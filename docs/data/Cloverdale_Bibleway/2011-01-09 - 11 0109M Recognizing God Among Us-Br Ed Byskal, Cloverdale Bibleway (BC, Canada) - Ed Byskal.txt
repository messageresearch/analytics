TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Oh, he is worthy. Oh, he's so worthy. Oh, worthy. The lamb that was saved. He's worthy. So worthy. For you are worthy. Oh worthy. The lamb that was slain. Oh the archangels, the saints of all time. They're holy. They all fall down before you and join in the song. They seem worthy. Oh, you're worthy. You are so worthy that was worthy. You're worthy. Oh, you're so worthy. Oh, the lamb that was I will praise him. Oh, praise him. Oh, praise him. Oh, praise the L. him with all your heart. Oh, praise him. Oh, praise the lamb that was saved. I love him. I love him. Oh, how I love him. Oh, I am the lamb that was slain. I love him. I love him. Oh, I love him. Oh, I love the lamb that was slain. Sing worthy once more. Oh, he is worthy. Lord, you are worthy. [Music] Worthy, [Music] worthy lamb that was made. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. How wonderful you are, Lord Jesus. We just want to come into your presence with joy and thanksgiving and worship. We pray that you will bless, oh God, &gt;&gt; every person &gt;&gt; every person in your presence those that are streaming, those that are on the telephone, oh God, whatever country, wherever they may be in whatever time zone, pray that you will bless them immensely, Father. And we that have gathered here, we've not gathered in vain. We've gathered that we might hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. We pray that you will remove every obstacle, remove all the thoughts of this world and this life, oh God, and may in the in uh in uh in your face, oh God, may it just become uh dim. All the things of the world, may they pale, for they are not important. This is an important time, Lord. pray you'll take your word and break it to the people, oh God. Take control of my lips, Father. I dedicate them and surrender myself to you that we might be benefited and edified and built up and prepared for the hour that we're living in. In Jesus name, amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be together this morning. &gt;&gt; Beautiful sunny day. We have to tell the people it's a sunny day. God's been good to us and we're so thankful for it. Amen. Are you rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Good. God bless you. I'm going to go directly to the word because we want to uh take our time and uh we'd like to read just two scriptures. The first one is Hebrews 13:8. And I'm sure that you can all quote it without even having turned to it in the scripture. And the second will be in Ecclesiastes the 3 chapter. Ecclesiastes comes right after Proverbs. So Hebrews 13:8. Let us read it together. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Let's read it again. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And then in Ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15, I know that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it, and God doeth it that men should fear before him. That which hath been is now, and that which is to be hath already been, and God requireth that that which is passed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Strange scripture, perhaps strange reading for this morning, but those are those are the scriptures that I have. And you can have your seats. I'm going to uh go immediately to a quote that brother Brandham incorporated and used these two scriptures. And uh this is in the Ephesian church age. He said the the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one. So this is now the the key. &gt;&gt; In fact, it might be called the keystone of the Bible. It is the revelation that God never changes &gt;&gt; and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is. And then the two scriptures which we read, I will just take it again because now that you're seated and and have your spirits quietened, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. How many times did the prophet quote that? Why would it be so frequently? Because it was something that we need to be reminded of. It's something that we need to experience. that nothing doesn't nothing changes with him. I know that whatso whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever. Nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him. That's why he does it. That which hath been is now, and that which is to be hath already been. and God requireth that which is passed. Amen. Then he goes on this next quote. It's a little bit little bit loud here for me if you don't mind. Thank you. You know, he's going with this keystone thought. Here it is. An unchanging God with unchanging ways. What he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time. &gt;&gt; There will never be a change. Apply that to the church ages. The kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's ministry would be the example for all other ages. What God did in the first age is what he wants to do in all other ages. &gt;&gt; Now sometimes a person gets up such as I am this morning and just uh feel real confident and what you're going to be saying. But the service this morning will be a little different for me because the key point that I want to bring to you is not something you can just preach, but it's something I want to convey to this congregation. I want to convey to you as a friend, as a servant of Jesus Christ, as uh someone who has I I was reminded a great deal and uh about this and and I I want I hope that you'll receive it right. But I'm I'm going to speak to you today from the perspective from the point of view that for whatever reason and I feel very very unworthy that I was able to experience it. But I did experience the presence of God that I want to talk about today. I'm not talking about anything that perhaps you have experienced. I'm talking about my own personal experience. I'm not talking about a joyous time or wonderful time or a fearful time that you may have had. I think that I would be correct in saying I really do believe sincerely that I'm right in saying people who came into the presence of of the God's prophet, they experienced they experienced something. and he talks quite a bit about it and almost a hundred times he said do you believe me to be God's prophet &gt;&gt; there were there were certain things that needed to be in place uh regarding the presence of God and I wrote in the automobile which many of you have heard I'm not going to go into the account but the presence of that person and I want to speak on recognizing the one amongst us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Recognizing the one amongst us, I have some key things that I want to say. Some very, very significant things that I want to say to you as a congregation and to those that are believers that are streaming right now. You God has arranged that you are identified with a message that is has been more attested to has been in the constant accompaniment of the almighty supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; More so than any message since Adam. &gt;&gt; We have no record in the scripture. We have Elijah who did four miracles. Elisha who did a double portion eight. We have men of God, holy men, patriarchs down through the scripture. We have the life of Jesus Christ, even Jesus Christ himself who raised the dead and did all manner of things in a very localized area which was Palestine. But he did say that greater works than these shall ye do. &gt;&gt; And the greater works he said were could not brother Brandham said could not be greater in in the quality but in the quantity. &gt;&gt; And where there has been no record. It couldn't happen until this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Came into the jet age the achievement of of scientific achievement and now this ministry went completely around the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, seven times around the world. But more than that, more than that, I want you to think real deep about these things. I'm just going to take my I'm just going to talk to you if it's all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't make any difference where brother Brandham went whether it was in New York or whether it was in Houston or whether it was in Los Angeles or whether it was in Durban South Africa or Johannesburg or whether it was in Bombay India or whether it was in Helsinki Finland that presence of that unseen one was always there. It was from the earliest services until the very last services. And and and and he would say so many times, if I've told you the truth, let him come now and tell the truth to you and confirm the truth. I was in a message uh this last week and I found it very strange. Uh in fact is I'm you know I have it right at the very end of my service today but I probably won't get to it and it is uh in uh confirmation and evidence was the message and brother Branamus finished the service he is now going to uh he's actually going to have an altar call and uh so he said uh how many in the building just now and he stops. Dot dot dot. How many in the building just now? Cuz he'd asked the people to raise their hands, etc. How many in the building just now? And he stopped and he says, I started to make an altar call, but the Holy Spirit stopped me. He said, that's a strange thing. Sure is. &gt;&gt; Said there's something else. He said, now he's talking what the Holy Spirit said to him. &gt;&gt; You haven't given the presence of my confirmation of my presence yet. Stops now. He's going to have an altar call. He's closing a service. And the Holy Spirit stops him and says these words. You haven't given my confirmation &gt;&gt; my confirmation of my presence &gt;&gt; to to prove that I am here. &gt;&gt; And he goes on and immediately uh he goes on and he he he immediately starts and I've just uh uh separated some of these things. Right over here is a colored man sitting here on the front row. He's facing an operation and have you a prayer card? Because he said, "I don't want anybody that has a prayer card to raise their hand." Only those that do not have a prayer card. And every person he called out of the audience, he said, "You do not have a prayer card." Wanted to make sure they confirmed they do not have a prayer card. He said, "You don't have a prayer card. You don't. You don't need one." And he he speaks of a bladder trouble. And you believe that God can heal the bladder trouble. You believe me? That's a fine spirit right there. Do you believe me to be God's prophet or his servant? Excuse me. That stumbles people. Well, it doesn't stumble us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it with all your heart. I thank you, sir. That's the way to believe on them that God sent. That's why I said that's a good spirit because the man was the man was his approach was correct and and that's so important. We don't want to sit here and just have a service. I want to say to every man, woman, and child. We want to have the kind of approach where we're not just coming to church, but we're actually entering into a relationship with this one that's amongst us. Because God, what he did at the beginning, he can't change. And the and the and now don't forget don't forget what I'm going to just say here at the beginning. The same God that met Moses was always with Moses. &gt;&gt; And when Moses died, that same one continued to be with the people. &gt;&gt; But they kept referring back to what Moses said, what God said to Moses. And they kept living by that. And that God stayed with them. that God now changed his form and became flesh &gt;&gt; in the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And and and Jesus spoke of he that is with me. &gt;&gt; He nothing ever changed from the very beginning from when he was 12 years old speaking to the leaders till the time he resurrected. It was the same God because he was God. But he was manifested in a body. And remember people looked right at him. Some thought he was a teacher. Some thought he was a divider of the of the churches. Some thought he was a troublemaker. And some thought he was God. &gt;&gt; And he actually did all of those things. He did cause a lot of trouble. He did stir up the people. He did do all of those things. And some thought he was Joseph's son, and some thought he was this, and some thought he was that. God didn't change everybody's mind, but there were a few, &gt;&gt; a few that got really what it was. A few had the right approach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he has never changed. What he did there, he still does today. &gt;&gt; And this message which come now to us has come attested to. It's not it's not please don't rank it just with what is labeled the message throughout all the message and the message churches. I I am saying to you because I have felt and sense that presence. I've been in the presence of this prophet of God and the one that was with him, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord that was with him. And that's why I I've said many times to the people and because it means something very special to me and I'm going to emphasize it today throughout the entire service. If you go and and see a deep call to the deep again and the woman that is standing here and he gets speaking and he gets kind of caught caught away in in what he's speaking to the people and then he turns and he says is this the patient because he was he was in another realm in another world as it were and because he says it often I'm in two worlds at the same time and so he says to the woman he begins to speak to her and when that uh begin to reveal reveal the secret of the heart, the discerning. Now, some people say, "Well, that was the first pull, the second pull." Don't discredit it. That was the supernatural one that was there. He didn't have these powers within himself. He didn't have it. It was God himself who knew. He said, "Who knows that?" He knows. If he knows what has been, he knows what will be. It wasn't his knowledge. It wasn't what he learned. This was God himself. And I want to say to you that God has never left this message. And when you open a message book, when you hear a tape, when you you realize that God uh uh he interrupted your pathway and your direction, when whether you were young or whether you were older, God, whether you were born in a message home, in a home that honors this message, I want to say to you, this supernatural one that caused that woman, she's standing here and and and she she goes to steady herself and puts her hand on the pulpit And he says to her, he knows right away what it is. He says, "That won't hurt you. &gt;&gt; That's not me. That's him." &gt;&gt; And some of these people he was just speaking to. And uh as I was I was reading, he was he was telling them exactly the feeling that was coming over them as they sat back there, sat in another place. And he said, "Now you're feeling a real sweet feeling coming over you." That's because that pillar of fire is standing over you right now. or just think they're having an effect, but they don't even know where the effect is coming from. But until THE PROPHET OF GOD TELLS THEM WHAT kind of effect they're having, I want to say to you today, that's available for us. That's available to you today BECAUSE THAT GOD CANNOT CHANGE. AND THERE ISN'T anyone sitting here. There's no one listening to me this morning. But what has something uh uh an area of your life or an area of your your family or an area something where you have you have a need of a supernatural uh intervention. &gt;&gt; There isn't anyone here that wouldn't SAY, "OH, GOD, I HAVE I HAVE SOMETHING that I'm holding in my heart. I HAVE SOMETHING I'M BRINGING to you OF A SUPER I NEED A SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION. &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, I WOULD BE UNTRUE. I WOULD BE A LIAR IF I WASN'T ABLE TO SAY TO YOU THAT GOD HAS NEVER CHANGED. AND HE WANTS TO HE WANTS TO HAVE THAT KIND OF VISITATION WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WE WANT TO MOVE UP INTO THAT KIND OF SPHERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE GOD HAS PRIVILEGED YOU, GIVEN YOU SUCH AN HONOR, SUCH A PRIVILEGE THAT YOU WERE IDENTIFIED WITH A SUPERNATURAL MESSAGE &gt;&gt; THAT CAME BUT FROM HEAVEN IN A SUPERNATURAL WAY. CAME ON THE WINGS OF ANGELS, IF YOU WOULD, OPENING THE SEALS, THE MYSTERIES OF THE WORD OF GOD. MEN TODAY BY THE MULTITUDES HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PARTS OF THIS WORD UH important parts of THE SCRIPTURE ARE. AND GOD HAS GIVEN IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS LAID IT OUT BEFORE YOU. &gt;&gt; It's not JUST A SERIES OF BOOKS. Forget it. And I I I I picked up a book. I said, and the young people sang today, thank you, Brother Ryan and Isaiah, the Caldwell family. I wrote the words down while you were singing. It's more than a story. It's more than some words on a page &gt;&gt; of history. &gt;&gt; What has they didn't know? Of course, no idea what my scripture is going to be. What he has been, he is. &gt;&gt; And what he is, he always will be. &gt;&gt; He's Jesus Christ today, &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what might be impossible for you is not impossible for God. Hallelujah. And we continue to believe for the impossible because we are believers of the impossible. We're believers of the supernatural. [Music] &gt;&gt; And God doesn't have to put on a show for us. &gt;&gt; That's just God. What he does is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] It's more than words on a page. Now, if God attested to this message, if he gave proof to this message, it's not just how he visited this person back here, &gt;&gt; this lady that is sitting here. Not just you're from Iowa, he knows where you're from &gt;&gt; because we're not connected just to the words on this page. We're connected to the one who was speaking it. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, you're not just from Iowa, but you're from De Moines. &gt;&gt; And uh your name is Mrs. Wolf. Amen. &gt;&gt; That same God knows your name &gt;&gt; and knows where you're sitting &gt;&gt; at this moment and knows why you're here &gt;&gt; because that one somehow one day touched you &gt;&gt; and something moved within you &gt;&gt; and said THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS ATMOSPHERE is different. THIS IS NOT JUST A CHURCH. THIS IS NOT JUST A RELIGION. THIS IS A PERSON AND THIS KIND OF GOD I CAN BELIEVE IN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The one that's amongst us. &gt;&gt; Recognizing the one that's amongst us. &gt;&gt; And for those who see it and those who see him as, you know, well, it's a it's a a fine church or it's a fine group of people. That's is what you'll get. And furthermore, and I'm going to speak some things that I don't fully understand. Brother abandon has people come up and they're they come right into that presence and he says, "Now it depends what you think it is." &gt;&gt; If you think that this is the devil, &gt;&gt; you will get his reward. &gt;&gt; If you think it's of God, you will get his reward. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Can you imagine two things, two uh consequences from the same moment? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the in front of the same person, &gt;&gt; he says, "If you think it's of Satan, you'll get his reward." He said, "If you think it is like the Pharisees thought it is, you'll get their reward. &gt;&gt; But if you think it is of God, you think this is God, you'll get his reward. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I emphasize again of all the ministries that God has sent and somebody if you're nervous about say well we don't want to make too much of a man. Don't worry &gt;&gt; God raised brother Brandham up a lot higher than you ever can. He gave him the highest position &gt;&gt; in this entire age. And there won't be another one like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm interested in the one that sent him. &gt;&gt; Some people draw from this message. Now, I'm going to get right home where people live. Some people draw from this message and they obtain a higher standard of Christian living, a code of ethics, a standard of morals. They dress different and perhaps live different and that's good. That's not what I'm talking about. Some go perhaps a little further and they they absorb uh and retain a collection of of truths out of the scripture. Uh perhaps even get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because they see it in the scripture. Brother Bram said it doesn't even take a revelation. They just see it in the scripture. That's what it says. That's what I'm going to do. And uh and there are truths and loose ends. And I've I've run into people. I've spoken to them and they they believe the message because they said, "Well, it it it confirms what they have always believed. They haven't got it." &gt;&gt; That's not what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; God isn't coming to give a revelation because you already have it. &gt;&gt; He's coming here to tell us things that we don't know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so there's there's uh but there are a few that take all of the above. They have a better code of ethics. They have a higher moral standard. They they have better homes because of it. They have a better life. They have a better work ethic as well. It does all of those things. It is truths that have loose ends of the of the scripture that others can't answer. All of that comes they they obtain all of that. But there are a few that diligently seek out the author who spoke these things. &gt;&gt; The one who did the supernatural, the supernatural one. And I can tell you, I tell you in all truth, he can be felt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can be experienced. &gt;&gt; And you can enter into a relationship with this one &gt;&gt; that will make your little world &gt;&gt; just pale away. &gt;&gt; This world. And I believe my wife and I, my wife was speaking to me while we were coming. She said, and this is her desire, and and I don't mind saying it. She said, "I feel that we're moving so close to the resurrection." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to separate myself from all of these little things that we can become so cluttered up with and taken with &gt;&gt; and occupied with. Now, we spoke of you young mothers that have children. But while you're caring for your children, that's a spiritual work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you wives that are caring for your home and your husband and so those things, that's a spiritual work because it's here in the word of God. But you can go beyond that and enter into a a a a relationship with this person who sent this message and made you what you are and made this church what it is. And if there is an elect and God has and and uh uh brother Toby while he was praying we are the elect of God. It can only be that because someone supernatural has come and already said that. Because someone caused that prophet's voice to say, "I'll call you bride." We couldn't even do it ourselves, but he said it. &gt;&gt; And because that came from another realm as God coming from the throne of God. Think friends what what we should be how we should be feeling, how we should be reacting to this. &gt;&gt; Is this making any sense to you? Amen. &gt;&gt; There are those that are hungering for the presence of the bridegroom &gt;&gt; and thus they live in a different realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's more than an association here in a church. &gt;&gt; It's got to be much more than just a fellowship or association in the church. That that that's just some of the side benefit. But the real benefit is that you have a relationship and association with this supernatural being, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. He was felt back then. I think of I think of Peter. I'm thinking of him just now when he he had seen the miracles. He was he had already been identified. He was one that was with as Jesus said, "You'll sit on 12 thrones. You've been with me in the in the regeneration." And yet when Peter and caught that load of fish, he fell down at his feet and said to depart from me. I'm a sinful man. &gt;&gt; The prophet Isaiah, oh woe is me. He said, "Woe is me." When he came into that presence and friends, that's available. That's not just something that that God is promising us some pie in the sky up in the future. that presence. God knows the kind of uh the kind of people we have to walk around and and the age that we're living in and the uncleanness of this age and the EVIL OF THIS AGE. BUT THERE'S A SACRED PLACE. &gt;&gt; There's a place for the believer. THERE'S A SACRED PLACE FOR YOU TO ENTER INTO. When the scripture speaks about we're in HEAVENLY PLACES, YOUR BODY IS HERE WALKING HERE, but your soul is in another realm. YOUR SOUL HAS BEEN MADE FOR THIS. &gt;&gt; The presence of God is absolutely essential for the supernatural to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every person under the sound of my voice needs the supernatural somewhere today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In their life or in their experience. If we could only understand and believe that God is present to do what we desire from him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been impressed by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that although God has changed in his form from time to time, &gt;&gt; he had certain forms. He had certain say with the pillar of fire, the burning bush. &gt;&gt; They never went back and made anything. Nobody, no one of the children of Israel SAID, "WELL, LET I WANT TO go back and visit the spot where the burning bush was." &gt;&gt; It didn't mean anything. It was just God that spoke to him there and and and visited him there. And it was it was passed from then on. &gt;&gt; But but that symbolized it symbolized and when Moses went and told them, "I met I met the angel of the Lord. God spoke to me out of a burning fire, out of a burning BUSH THAT WOULDN'T THEY HAD TO BELIEVE HIM. [Music] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOBODY THERE TO confirm it and attest to it and help them through their unbelief. They had to believe &gt;&gt; and then when they believed and then they were able to enter into and participate in the in the miracles and the and THEN THE THE PLAGUES MEANT SOMETHING TO THEM. THEY WERE ON ONE side of the plagues. The Egyptians were on the other side of the plagues. It meant different thing. There was people that totally there was magicians there that you know did their did their uh did their thing and and swayed their people. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; But God never ever left. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses &gt;&gt; met him up in a mountain and God himself remember now Moses had to write this &gt;&gt; that there was no man like Moses &gt;&gt; he had to write THAT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAID it &gt;&gt; he said as he's the MEAKEST MAN IN ALL THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; MOSES HAD TO WRITE that &gt;&gt; and the people had to believe it. HE HAD TO SAY IT OF HIMSELF &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD was saying it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when a prophet in this day here because it's such an unbelieving and such a a a high state of of of civilization that God allowed THE CAMERA TO CATCH the picture of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed that we're that we needed so much evidence &gt;&gt; and we have the pillar of fire over the prophet's head in public &gt;&gt; IN HOUSTON, TEXAS &gt;&gt; AT THE SAM HOUSTON COLISEUM. WHAT AN UNBELIEVING GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AND NO WONDER THE PROPHET COULD SAY IT WAS PROPHETIC WHEN JESUS SAID, "A WICKED AND ADULTEROUS GENERATION SEEKE ASTH." AND HE SAID, "THERE'LL ONLY BE ONE SIGN GIVEN." AND I I I listened to it several times. Heard him say it several times just in the message I was listening to and and reading. And he said that the the a wicked and adulterous GENERATION. HE SAID HE WAS SAYING IT IN A PROPHETIC WAY BECAUSE HE SAID IT'S THIS GENERATION NOT THAT GENERATION. This generation is the wicked and adulterous generation that seeketh a sign. And he said, Jesus said, "The only sign to be given will be the one of Jonah as he was three days in in the whale's belly, &gt;&gt; the belly of the fish, the whale." &gt;&gt; Well, when he came out, what was it? What was the evidence? It was the It was the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's the sign. This is the sign of the resurrection." He said it plainly. Listen to me, people. You're living. YOU HAVE ALREADY COME. YOU'VE BEEN CALLED UNDER THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; People talk about YOUR SIGN IN THE in in in the heavens and the stars and all the rest of it. I'll tell you, you came under a star. &gt;&gt; You came under a messenger star. &gt;&gt; AND YOU YOUR SIGN is the resurrection. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I say [Applause] &gt;&gt; and the ONE WHO WAS RESURRECTED BACK THERE IS THE SAME ONE WHO'S PRESENT. HE CAN'T CHANGE. &gt;&gt; HE CAME OUT OF THE TOMB, BUT HE'S HERE TODAY AT THIS PLATFORM. &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE STANDING BY YOUR SEAT. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD, I'M NOT JUST going back. When we when we refer back, we're calling it as though it was yesterday or five minutes ago. And he SAYS, "NOW, WE'LL TALK TO THE PEOPLE ON THE COURTS. THERE'S A WOMAN, A YOUNG WOMAN. THERE'S A WOMAN said there and a young young person in that court." &gt;&gt; He says, "AND NOW AT THIS MOMENT, the angel of THE LORD IS STANDING BESIDE HER." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHAT'S HE SAY? GET UP OFF THAT C. AND AND AND SHE HE SAID, "I I BELIEVE THAT I would obey that &gt;&gt; cuz she wasn't getting up off that c." I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. GET UP OFF THAT C. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, FRIENDS, WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SUPERNATURAL GOSPEL, THERE'S A SUPERNATURAL MESSAGE. IT'S A SUPERNATURAL PROPHET, A SUPERNATURAL GOD WITH THE PROPHET. I SAY TODAY I WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT GOD HAS NEVER CHANGED. THAT GOD IS JUST AS PRESENT HERE NOW IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; AND YOU NEED A SUPERNATURAL GOD. YOU NEED HIM TODAY AND YOU'LL NEED HIM TOMORROW. AND I'M DECLARING HE'LL BE THE SAME TOMORROW THAT HE IS TODAY. &gt;&gt; We need him. AND THERE'S A CERTAIN APPROACH TO HIM. &gt;&gt; IT CAN'T JUST BE SOME INFORMATION IN THE SERMON YOU'RE listening to. THERE'S A CERTAIN APPROACH. &gt;&gt; AND I CAN TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, "WELL, I'LL TAKE FIVE MINUTES, LORD, I HOPE you got an instant response here." That's not what he does. THIS ISN'T A PUSH BUTTON GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; This is a gospel WHERE A PERSON SETS THEMSELVES ASIDE AND SAY, "I'M HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU, OH GOD. I'M HERE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. I'M HERE TO SHUT OUT THE WORLD. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could only recognize, that's number one. Amen. If &gt;&gt; we could only recognize who it is &gt;&gt; and number two, then separate ourselves &gt;&gt; from the world until number three, we approach God and come into a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the rest will be irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those steps need to be taken. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to think that this year &gt;&gt; will be a different year &gt;&gt; for all of us. &gt;&gt; I would like to think that this year &gt;&gt; than we would experience. Just think if we took another breath &gt;&gt; if we took ANOTHER BREATH &gt;&gt; AND PASSED INTO another realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And knew KNEW THAT WE WERE BEYOND TEMPTATION. BEYOND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO A MARRIAGE SUPPER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS TODAY AND THE AND the the the snow and the SUN ON THEM SHINING ON THEM AND HOW MAGNIFICENT. AND MY WORD, MY THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY GOES BACK TO THE PROPHET. HE SAYS, "WELL, HE MADE THE MOUNTAINS AND HE made the deserts in Arizona and Nevada and wherever. He made all of THAT BECAUSE HE'S A GOD of variety. AND THE PLACE THAT HE'S PREPARING FOR YOU WILL BE JUST SUITED TO THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. JUST THINK OF IT. HE'S MADE A PLACE SUITED FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THIS THING'S A REALITY, FRIENDS. THIS MARRIAGE SUPPER IS NOT JUST A PHRASE. IT'S A REALITY. AND THE SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT BROUGHT THIS SUPERNATURAL MESSAGE IS THE ONE THAT'S PREPARED THE PLACE FOR US. &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON OUR WAY. &gt;&gt; You're on your way. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could only recognize it. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus said this. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You shall ask what you will &gt;&gt; and it shall be done unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't say that's good for now &gt;&gt; or that was good in the past. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, &gt;&gt; you'll ask what you will and it shall be done to you. I was going back in my thoughts kind of how this all had to take place like this. The Bible tells us that Adam and Eve and the beginning there always has to be a beginning. And Adam and Eve and they said they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. In verse 24 of that third chapter says, "So he drove he drove them out he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of the e of Eden cherubams and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life." when they had to depart from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the cherubams were there to protect the way of the tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that the tree was Christ. &gt;&gt; They weren't there to protect Christ. They were there to protect the way. Adam, Eve, and in civilization lost the way. And that is why we need a supernatural God because there isn't Look at all of those people that come before the prophet of God. They had lost their way. They didn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; They didn't Some of them didn't know what was wrong with them. Some of them didn't know what to do and and he has one woman in front of him and he says, "You're thinking about a divorce." He just told her what to she didn't know what to do. and he and he he doesn't tell her what to do, but he tells her what she's thinking about. Other people said, "Should I have an operation?" Other people said they're burdened for their their family, their daughter, their son. One one woman stands there and he says, "You I see an older I see an elder woman, an elderly woman now, as comes into view. And that elderly woman is your grandmother." And then he says, "And I say another woman, that's your mother, and she's here in the meeting." Well, WHAT KIND OF GOD IS THAT? THAT'S THE KIND OF GOD I SERVE. &gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T BE HERE AT THE PULPIT IF WE DIDN'T have that KIND OF GOD. HE KNOWS EVERY DETAIL. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER. HE KNOWS ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN. HE KNOWS ABOUT THE SAVED ONES AND THE BACKSLIDEN ONES. HE KNOWS ABOUT IT ALL. HE KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT. HE KNOWS WHAT THE SOLUTION IS TO YOUR PROBLEM AND HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT SOME DISTANT GOD UP THERE. HE'S A GOD DOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD WHO'S INTERESTED IN YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU. YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T SIT THERE AND THINK, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT." I'VE BEEN THERE, TOO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN A TEENAGER. JESUS WAS A TEENAGER. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT. AND HE'S JUST AS INTERESTED IN YOU TODAY AS HE WAS BACK THEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OR ANY OTHER TIME. &gt;&gt; So they went out of Eden and departed from his presence. And the entire scope of the scripture is a record of God seeking to bring man back into his presence &gt;&gt; and to have that relationship and have it restored once again. And that's why Jesus Christ, the second Adam, came. But even then when he CAME IT WAS AVAILABLE TO THEM LIKE IT'S AVAILABLE TO US TODAY. &gt;&gt; But you know we have we have our own thoughts about things and what we think it is. And I say what's the message? Well, you say the message to some, well, they think of it as a church or they think of it as a group of churches or they think of it as whatever. They think about this church. And no, that that this is just a building. &gt;&gt; The message is people. &gt;&gt; The word of God is people &gt;&gt; who are to have a supernatural experience with a supernatural God. So God has been tireless in providing supernatural works to show us the way back and bring us into his presence. For in his presence, the supernatural is happening. &gt;&gt; If you come into his presence, the supernatural is happening. If you or I have a need of anything, if we do need anything, we are in need of his presence. The word presence is the same as face. In fact, it's face in the Bible. Presence is the face. Now, brother John, I'll just have you come up here for a moment and you face that way. John, I like to say something to you. John. John, I kind of like to get acquainted with you. Boy, this isn't working. If you'd turn around, I see your face. &gt;&gt; I look in your eyes. I can take your hand. Shake your hand. We enter into a relationship. &gt;&gt; That's God's problem. trying to get people or so. &gt;&gt; Look up, son. Look up, son. It's not down here. It's not all this dust. Thank you, brother John. It's not all these things and all this stuff you're all occupied with. IT'S LOOK UP. LOOK AT MY FACE. &gt;&gt; AND YOU LOOK AT HIS FACE AND YOU COME INTO HIS PRESENCE AND OH, SOMETHING TAKES A HOLD OF YOU. YOU LOOK INTO HIS EYES. LOOK INTO THAT FACE OF JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW, AND FOREVER. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And that's why the word in the scripture is exactly the same. The presence, his presence is his face or in the presence of a person. His presence in the Bible identifies his most essential character &gt;&gt; of himself. Just remember some of these things I'm saying. I'm not I'm not going to enlarge on them. I I want to give them to you as they have been given to me. The face of God and the presence of God in the Bible are inseparably linked together. the face of God and the presence of God. &gt;&gt; To see one's face is to see the person. &gt;&gt; God's relationship with Adam began with creation. He had a relationship. Wasn't just that he made a man said, you know, there go take care of the garden. But it entered into a relationship and God came in the cool of the evening and they had fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the big part. Right. This relationship was soon affected by the fall in the cool of the evening. He said, "What the message? What is the Holy Ghost given for?" He'd come down and commune with them. And there he lost that fellowship because sin would not let him do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to a man and live in man &gt;&gt; and restore man to a state of communion with him again. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Not just some words. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in the supernatural one that had these words penned. &gt;&gt; Amen. had these words spoken &gt;&gt; so that we could when when we look at the words as they sang more than words on a page. &gt;&gt; How is it more? It's a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a person. &gt;&gt; AND THIS ISN'T EVEN SUFFICIENT FOR US TO USE THE WORD THAT IT'S A PERSON. YOU NEED TO REACH OUT DURING THIS SERVICE AT THIS MOMENT AND SAY GOD OF THIS WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M HUNGERING FOR YOU. I HAVE BEEN HUNGERING. THE HUNGER AND THE THIRST IS BEING AWAKENED AGAIN. IT'S BEEN CLOUDED OVER. IT'S BEEN CROWDED OUT. I'VE HAD ALL KINDS OF DISTRACTIONS. &gt;&gt; YOU HAD DISTRACTIONS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SATAN IS AN EXPERT DISTRACTOR. &gt;&gt; And he HE LIES TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Do you HEAR ME? &gt;&gt; HE LIES TO YOU. HE LIES TO ME AND TELLS ME THESE THINGS ARE UNAVAILABLE AND I CAN'T REACH THROUGH AND I CAN'T PENETRATE. HE'S TOLD SOME PEOPLE THERE'S NO USE. TELL HIM HE'S A LIAR. TELL HIM HE'S A LIAR TODAY. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REACH THROUGH. &gt;&gt; AND THAT GOD IS AVAILABLE TO YOU. HE WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU. [Music] &gt;&gt; THIS WORLD IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO IT. AND YOU WALK OUT THESE DOORS AND GO INTO A RESTAURANT, YOU'LL BE HEARING MUSIC. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE MUSIC ISN'T CONDUCIVE. YOU'LL SEE WAITRESSES AND WAITERS AND WHATEVER MORE COMING YOUR WAY AND YOU'LL HEAR CONVERSATION. IT'S NOT CONDUCIVE. THIS IS THE ATMOSPHERE. LAY HOLD OF IT NOW. [Applause] References in the Bible to the presence of God are the same as to the face of God. And when you're in the presence of a person for the purpose of friendship or communion with them, you expect to be face to face. &gt;&gt; Friends, I can get into swimming water with you real quick. Brother Brandham describes the seven personages of Jesus Christ in Revelation chapter 1. And remember, it's the only book in the Bible that was written by Jesus Christ. It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. I Jesus, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; sent my messenger, my angel, and he gave and it was Jesus Christ that gave the messages to each of the messengers. The last there are seven for the seven ages. The last description of him was not his feet, was not his robe, was not his hair white, was not his eyes as a flame of fire. It was his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his face, folks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's telling you clearly from the scripture telling you that the last age he's making himself known [Music] &gt;&gt; TO YOU PERSONALLY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT JUST A A AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T WANT JUST FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU. HE HAS COME NOW TO BE A BRIDEGROOM AND TO ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP AND BECOME A HUSBAND &gt;&gt; TO A BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You're looking at me. &gt;&gt; Some may be saying, "I I I I believe that. I've heard that before. Those are Don't let them just be words." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a person. &gt;&gt; He wants to enter into that relationship with you. &gt;&gt; Go out when you're going out of these doors. It can even be more real then than it is perhaps even now. &gt;&gt; When you're alone, &gt;&gt; when you're in your room, when you're in your car, &gt;&gt; whatever it is, &gt;&gt; you can isolate yourself. &gt;&gt; LET THE WORLD GO BY. ISOLATE YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; ENTER INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP. EVEN YOU CAN BE AROUND PEOPLE, BUT YOU CAN ISOLATE YOURSELF. YEAH. &gt;&gt; You know, some years ago, I was in Toronto and uh the one of the main radio stations, I think it was the Canadian broadcasting, I'm not too sure, but they had a program that someone just got, you know, caught some kind of inspiration, thought they'll have this program and they will cater the program and and open up the lines for lonely people, people that are troubled with loneliness. And the phones rang off the wall. And they listened to people and the people told about how lonely they were, how alone they were in a city of three million people. &gt;&gt; I'm so alone. Uh, and the effect of that loneliness and it was it was painful. You know what I'm talking about. You can be in a crowded of a church. You can have people shake your hand after the service, but somehow you feel so alone. Well, by the by the same token, you can be alone with him &gt;&gt; in the same way. In exactly the same way, you just move into another realm. It's fine. I'm I'm a I'm I'm separated from the world. It's fine that I don't feel connected to this world. It's fine. I don't feel connected to this classroom. In fact, is I'm not even swallowed up by this achievement or my job or whatever more or or things come or things go. And you get a promotion, you get more money, you get less money. It doesn't make any difference. &gt;&gt; You hear me? Doesn't make any difference because you're shut in with God. That's what they're talking about. That's what the songwriter is talking about. Into a secret place, into a secret chamber because you're the only one that's you and God. &gt;&gt; You and the supernatural one. &gt;&gt; I hope it's ringing. &gt;&gt; I hope it's hitting some strings in your heart. Adam, he lost his way. So he drove him out to keep the way of the tree of life. He lost his way. He lost the way of the tree of life. And we become so acquainted with the ways of the world. We truly have what's acceptable by the world. Well, they do it and someone else does it. I'm not interested who does it. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested what someone else does or another church does or anything else. What does God want you to do? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think that God would prefer that you would have more that you' don't you think that he'd be more pleased with me saying today you can have more uh association and more relationship and you can enter into another realm and another sphere you can enter in where the things that are troubling you is when you walked in the doors today. I'm telling you that you can you can enter into such an experience WITH GOD. THE SAME thing that bothered you till you came in is gone when you go out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Things that are weighing down on you will be released from you IN HIS PRESENCE. THE SUPERNATURAL IS HAPPENING TO SAY, "OH GOD, I BELIEVE WHAT THIS MAN'S SAYING. I BELIEVE IT'S IN YOUR WORD. &gt;&gt; AND I ENTER INTO THAT FREELY. I ACCEPT IT. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THIS IS FOR ME. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep preaching till the fear leaves you. &gt;&gt; Going to keep preaching till these troubling things leave you. Satan in the NAME OF JESUS HAS NO RIGHT TO YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; IT'S A BATTLEGROUND, BUT WE HAVE WON THE VICTORY OVER HIM. YOU'RE NOT TO LAY THERE AND WALLOW IN THE DUST. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT TO LAY THERE AND REMAIN DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; OUR LORD, &gt;&gt; THE SUPERNATURAL GOD HAS PAID THE PRICE AND HAS DEFEATED THAT ENEMY. &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE TO AGREE WITH JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST AGREE WITH THE CONQUEROR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's so many voices. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "There's so many voices today that takes the voice of God, the voice of the Lord away from us. &gt;&gt; There's the voices of pleasure &gt;&gt; and there's voices of many people are listening to that where they can go and have a good time." &gt;&gt; He says, "But then to really get down and pray, they got so many other things to do. There's so many voices in the world, so many things to attract our attention from God." He said in the voice of God is these last days. One reason that the church is in the condition, think of what he said now. One reason the church is in its condition is is that it's in is because there is so many voices and so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God. Not even talking about the unbeliever. We're talking about the church. SO THAT'S WHY I'M PREACHING THAT WE CAN CUT THOSE THINGS AWAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT THEY STILL MIGHT EXIST. THE VOICES ARE STILL THERE, BUT IT GOES OVER YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE NOT BEING AFFECTED BY IT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO DISTRACT YOU. YOU HAVE THE SAME JOB, THE SAME BURDENS, THE SAME BILLS, BUT THEY DON'T MEAN THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, FOLKS, &gt;&gt; we got to preach rapture faith. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T STAY BOGGED DOWN AND PREACH RAPTURE. I'M PREACHING SOMETHING THAT SETS US FREE FROM THIS. IN HIS PRESENCE IS THE FULLNESS OF JOY AND AT HIS RIGHT HAND ARE PLEASURES FOREVER MORE. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's so many voices, he said in another place in the earth today that it's absolutely a hard thing because of the because it deadens the voice of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when God came to Moses and there's a a wonderful conversation that takes place between Moses and God. &gt;&gt; And uh Moses said, "Show me thy glory." And God answered and he said, "Uh, no one has seen my face. You can't see my face now." So he says, "Show me your glory." &gt;&gt; Says, "No man has seen my face." &gt;&gt; But he says that my presence will go with thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I will give you rest. And he said unto him, "If your presence, if thy presence go not with me, carest not up hence." In other words, if you don't go with me, &gt;&gt; your face, your presence, your person, if you don't go WITH ME, DON'T CARRY US UP HENCE. &gt;&gt; In Deuteronomy, God spoke and said, "There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face." &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN IN MY PRESENCE. HE &gt;&gt; STAYED IN MY PRESENCE. I SPOKE TO HIM AND HE DID WHAT I TOLD HIM TO DO. &gt;&gt; And when he struck the rock twice, he was not allowed to go into the promised land. And he accepted that. &gt;&gt; He didn't whine and whimper &gt;&gt; and pray and beg. &gt;&gt; Said, "That's it." &gt;&gt; IS WHAT GOD HAS SAID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he accepted it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he told the people, "I can't go with you." &gt;&gt; Cuz he told me, "I can't go." &gt;&gt; Amen. told him to go up Mount Nebo and there he he he died. And Jesus said of himself, "And he that sent me is with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Father hath not left me alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; There he IS. GOD IN FLESH. &gt;&gt; HE THAT SENT ME IS WITH ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I preached I believe in Tucson about 1978 the message the other angel. &gt;&gt; How many have heard it? Number of hands. A few. The other angel. I said they knew Moses. They knew Moses. &gt;&gt; Moses. He went into the wilderness but when he came back they didn't know the one that was with him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus said, "He that's with me." They knew Jesus of Nazareth, a prophet from Nazareth, a great teacher, and all kinds of other things. And that's not enough. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T ENOUGH. WHEN THE WOMAN AT THE WELL SAID, "I PERCEIVE THAT YOU'RE A PROPHET." HE DIDN'T SAY, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; How wonderful it is &gt;&gt; that you've recognized I'm a prophet. &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A THIRD PULL. &gt;&gt; TOOK THE TOOK TO TOOK HER TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT HE WAS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM A PROPHET. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH OR EVEN THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE OR MALACHI 4. IT'S MORE THAN MALACHI 4. IT'S REVELATION 10. &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; IT'S A MIGHTY LION HIMSELF THAT HAS SPOKEN. &gt;&gt; LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. BUT WHEN HE SPOKE, THUNDERS UTTERED THEIR VOICES. &gt;&gt; And unless we get this message going beyond &gt;&gt; a prophet of God or brother Brandham and so on, how wonderful all that is. It goes beyond that. &gt;&gt; That's why he he spent so much of his life in two worlds. What was the other world? The world was the other one of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I pray that you will enter into another sphere, into another realm. I'm here to announce to you, it is yours. It's yours. And God is inviting you into it. And that's why I'm here speaking to you today. God is inviting you into it. We've got to COME TO ANOTHER PLANE, ANOTHER LEVEL, ANOTHER PLACE &gt;&gt; TO ENTER INTO WHAT GOD HAS FOR US. &gt;&gt; I'M CONVINCED that &gt;&gt; we need something more. for rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; They don't know the way. Sister, your baby is very sick. She probably knew that. They really don't know what's the matter with it. She didn't know that and they didn't know that because it's got trouble in its in its neck and it's a gland swelling. You was to take that baby to the doctor, the hospital. It was about yesterday. &gt;&gt; She knew that. But you're holding off. She also knew that. Said, "That's very good faith for a sinner." &gt;&gt; She probably didn't know that. Here's a man of God calling me a sinner. That's good faith for a sinner. You used to be a Catholic, wasn't you? And you quit the Catholic church. That's right. And then you started going to a Pentecostal church, but you didn't join it. You haven't been back to that church for about a year. Who is this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; WHO IS THIS ONE THAT'S AMONGST US? [Music] &gt;&gt; He knows what you tried to join. &gt;&gt; He knows WHAT YOU TRIED TO GET SATISFACTION FROM. HE KNOWS WHERE YOU TRIED TO GET SPIRITUAL HELP FROM. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; HE EVEN SAID TO SOME, "YOU WERE YOU WERE TO ANOTHER MEETING. YOU WERE TO OR ROBERT'S MEETING. YOU WERE PRAYED FOR FOR THIS SAME THING. IN FACT, AS YOU CAME TO MY MEETING AND I PRAYED FOR YOU ALSO AND THEY WERE THERE AGAIN." WHO KNOWS THAT? [Music] &gt;&gt; And does he KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING YOU? DOES HE KNOW IT ABOUT THAT LADY OR THAT PERSON AND DOESN'T KNOW IT ABOUT YOU? HE KNOWS EVERY INFINITE PART OF YOU &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT INTERESTED JUST IN TELLING YOU SOME INFORMATION. HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW I'M HERE TO TRY TO HELP YOU. &gt;&gt; Some of you got some habit, some weakness of the world that's hanging on to you. Listen to me, young person OR WHOEVER YOU MIGHT BE. THAT CAN END TODAY. &gt;&gt; THAT CAN END RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A HAND LAID ON YOU. ALL YOU NEED TO SAY IS, "I BELIEVE WHAT THAT MAN IS PREACHING. I BELIEVE THAT SUPERNATURAL ONE IS HERE. I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MY NAME, KNOWS WHERE I LIVE, AND HE'S HERE TO SET ME FREE OF IT." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Do &gt;&gt; you want to stand up and take your liberty? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to stand up and take my freedom. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my deliverance. I'M GOING TO TAKE WHAT GOD HAS PURCHASED FOR ME. AND IN THE NAME OF JESUS, YOU CAN RECEIVE IT NOW. HE CAN HAVE IT NOW. IT'S MORE THAN EXCITEMENT. IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT IS HIM, &gt;&gt; the person. of Jesus CHRIST &gt;&gt; HERE TO GIVE US SUPERNATURAL GIVE US A SUPERNATURAL AID SUPERNATURAL DELIVERANCE &gt;&gt; TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SITUATION praise him &gt;&gt; hallelujah he's the worthy one &gt;&gt; THE SHACKLES ARE DROPPING [Applause] [Music] Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; He who knows the way is here to show us the way. &gt;&gt; HE IS THE WAY. &gt;&gt; I AM THE WAY. &gt;&gt; THE WAY HAS COME BACK. GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; THE WAY HAS COME BACK. WE DON'T NEED TO BE CONFUSED ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; The way has come back. &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH HAS COME BACK. THE REVELATION of Jesus Christ has come to his people. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you like me to carry on a few more moments? &gt;&gt; You may just have your seats then. &gt;&gt; You haven't been back to that church for about a year. And his next line is, "You don't know what to do. This came upon your baby." Now, she doesn't know this. This came upon your baby that you might serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; WHAT GRACE IS THIS? &gt;&gt; There she is confused. I'M A CATHOLIC. I I I LEFT THE Catholic church. I've gone now to the Pentecostal. I've been there for a year and I haven't been back for a year and now my baby's in need. Just holding HER BABY. AND HE SAYS, "THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT. &gt;&gt; You don't know what's WRONG WITH IT." WHY? BECAUSE ADAM LOST HIS WAY. [Music] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE WAY WAS LOST. &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE, AND I KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE IT, BUT THE WAY HAS COME BACK TO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT BE TRAGIC TO HAVE THE WAY, HE WHO IS THE WAY, COME BACK WITH THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE, THIS KIND OF REVELATION, AND US TO CARRY ON IN A STUPER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T WE'RE TOO CONNECTED TO THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; FORGET THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HEAR ME. FORGET THE WORLD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you to forget your education or forget YOUR JOB, BUT TREAT IT AS THOUGH IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. [Music] &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This came upon your baby that you might serve the Lord. Now go and be born again of his spirit and I bless the baby. &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it the man? IS IT THE SUPERNATURAL ONE? YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THE MESSAGE FROM THE MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You can't SAY, "I HONOR YOU, GOD, AND I HAVE NOTHING TO do with the pastor. I have nothing to do with my brother. I couldn't care less about the people I sit around." God won't honor that. YOU HAVE TO SAY, "I SEE GOD IN YOU. I SEE GOD IN YOU." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN YOU SAY, "GOD BLESS YOU, I ACCEPT THAT." &gt;&gt; People tell me ALL THE TIME, "I'M PRAYING FOR YOU." AND I ANSWER THEM RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU FOR PRAYING FOR US. &gt;&gt; Thank you for praying for us. &gt;&gt; What better thing could we have in this world than to have brothers AND SISTERS IN CHRIST PRAYING for us? Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I think we should take these things serious. &gt;&gt; When somebody takes your hand say, "God bless you." You should think right away what the prophet of God said about that. That they're saying the best thing that can be said. &gt;&gt; That's better than saying, "Here's a million dollars." WELL, A MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE GONE AND GIVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE, &gt;&gt; BUT THE BLESSING OF GOD WILL BE THERE FOREVER. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Come and see message. How do you do? This would fit perhaps some that are here. You're in trouble. You're not sick, only you're nervous. You're upset. It's a mental distress like because you're halting between two opinions. What you must do in life. Yours is not sickness. You have a child, don't you? A boy. You're having family trouble at home. Isn't that right? And you don't know what And you don't want a divorce in your family. You don't know what to do. That incredible. You know what's incredible is that this God has enough in his great eternal being has enough concern to come down and speak to a person say you're in trouble. &gt;&gt; You don't know what to do. I come to this church. God, are you that close? Are you that real? Are you are you that personal? &gt;&gt; You care about my problem, &gt;&gt; my trouble, my pain, my sickness, my question. God wants you to admit that. and wants to turn your focus to him. &gt;&gt; You're not going to sort it out yourself. &gt;&gt; You're not going to fix it yourself. &gt;&gt; He's the only one. &gt;&gt; He's the only one that can fix it, right? &gt;&gt; You might improve things. &gt;&gt; I was asked in my office once, "What do you believe about Christian psychologists?" I said, 'Well, they help perhaps a lot of people, but they can never help you. You have received the message from almighty God. &gt;&gt; And while Christian psychologists, if that's the best that they have, that's fine. I have nothing to say about that. They have a lot of them, they said, I said they take the principles of the Bible and show people how they should live. And if they apply those principles and some of them are laws of God, they will work. The Christian businessmen, although they didn't receive Brother Brandham, they opened the doors for him and kept the doors open the longest for him even after churches had closed the doors. Christian businessmen kept the doors open. But he had to preach doing God a service without his will because they thought the churches aren't getting the gospel out. because they're all divided up in their denominations. But we we enter into a forum here where we don't we we disregard the denominations and they can come Catholic, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Salvation Army, Pentecost, oral, whatever more and we're all here in one big fellowship. And and not only that, God's blessed us and given us the money to do what the church can't do. And that's why brother Brown said having having money and having success is no rule of spirituality. They thought they were spiritual because God had blessed them. No, that's just a law. You give and it'll be given to you. Doesn't mean a person gets spiritual. You give and God will give it back to you and God will increase it. That's a law of God. But but he said now they were going to take and preach the gospel. He said don't do that. God wasn't against him in the message. I'm going to close in a few minutes. I'm not near done. But I what I felt to do today, I felt that I would just bring as many different aspects of the presence of God because it'll mean something to one person while perhaps something else will mean something to another person. And I hope that I scatter the word out and it will really lodge in your heart &gt;&gt; and change things for you and for your home and for your life, &gt;&gt; for your future. in why Christ speak. Who was I speaking to yesterday? Yes. They read in the message. Why Christ speak? He said it was he that night when I was going down the road and seen that big mamba snake about to get my brother. He said, "You've been given the power to bind him or any other of the rest of them." It was he that said to my little gay-headed wife sitting back there, it was he that morning that woke me up there in the room and standing in the corner said, "Don't fear to do anything or go anywhere or say anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ will be with you wherever you go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a gift. He didn't he didn't say it was my gift. He said it was he &gt;&gt; is the person. It was he when his wife had the tumor and he put his hand under there and it was gone. It was he. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give glory to God. We don't have to just read a quote. We've got people right here &gt;&gt; and I can say it was he. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's the same. &gt;&gt; What he did yesterday or last time, last week in your life, it's still him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you want to be able to say and SAY IT VERBALLY, IT'S HE. IT WAS HE THAT SPOKE TO ME. IT WAS HE WHO DREW ME. IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM I'M HERE. [Music] Don't talk to my wife about it, but she had a growth in her female organs. And a doctor right here in this city said, "We need to take that out." We didn't know whether it's malignant or what it is. She went to the hospital, came out of the operating room, and the doctor said, "We couldn't find it." &gt;&gt; She said, "Where did it go?" He said, "We don't know." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KIND OF GOD I BELIEVE IN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; On another occasion, she had serious trouble &gt;&gt; and a doctor of a specialist on Vancouver Island had attended her. He said, "If this symptoms, if this ever comes back, you come back immediately cuz this is serious. It was here while we have the church." And we're going down to visit some people in Tacoma. and she walked. We're going out the door. She has her coat on. She put her hand on the door knob and didn't open it. She turned around to me. She said, "That thing has come back." I said, "When?" Said, "About 3 weeks ago." And she said, "I want you in a very determined way. I want you to take the oil and anoint me with oil and pray for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, she's not saying, "Dear lovey, would you like to do it and get some oil?" It had nothing to do with that. This wasn't deary lovey husband, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I want you &gt;&gt; as her as her spiritual head, &gt;&gt; as her pastor, I want you to get the oil because that's what happens here. That's what the word of God says. We went back to the kitchen. She pulled a chair out and she knelted a chair. I anoint her with oil in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And by the time her hand at the door knob again, it was gone. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S FOREVER GONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULDN'T WE REJOICE? WE'RE NOT TALKING. IT'S MORE THAN WORDS ON A BOOK. IS MORE THAN HISTORY. IT'S A LIVING CRISIS HERE. &gt;&gt; HE'S CLOSER TO YOU THAN YOU DARE THINK. &gt;&gt; HE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU THAN YOU EVEN DARE THINK ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; I SAY GLORY to God. &gt;&gt; Does he use doctors? Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; We have perfect peace about that. He may and he may not. He may choose a different He MAY CHOOSE SOMETHING HIGH. HE MAY CHOOSE THE SUPERNATURAL. HE'S A SUPERNATURAL GOD. &gt;&gt; He lets this come upon this baby because her spiritual life needs it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God allows things to come our way. You've had trouble and your trouble drove you to your knees. &gt;&gt; You've had trouble and your trouble drove you to seek God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the sisters and those that are in a in a nursery, hear what I'm saying. Don't be visiting now. You honor your husband. You re re regard what the word of God has said that God has given him wisdom and God has given him leadership in your home and in your life. And honor him. And I will say this, follow him as he follows Christ. &gt;&gt; He must follow Christ. Follow me, Paul says, as he follows Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's important. I know it gets quiet in here. I'm going to say it anyway. Amen. &gt;&gt; This age is opposed to that. &gt;&gt; Separate yourself from this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll say two things. The spirit of this age is here to make the men more weak spiritually. Rise above that thing. Cast that off and say, "I will assume my responsibility and I will be the spiritual example and the spiritual head of this home." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then for the wife to honor that and support that and do everything that she can to encourage that and to let her know I'm with you. &gt;&gt; I'll just take maybe five minutes. [Music] &gt;&gt; It was he up in Sabina Canyon. about 3 months ago when I was praying, wondering what was going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was wondering what was going to happen. &gt;&gt; And I was standing there and a sword dropped INTO MY HAND. OH, THANK GOD. THE SWORD DROPPED INTO HIS HAND. NOT A SWORD, THE KING'S SWORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A SWORD OF POWER. IT'S A SWORD TO DESTROY THE ENEMY. USE THIS WORD TO DESTROY THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For he hath said &gt;&gt; in Hebrews 13, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT FROM HERE QUOTING THAT. I, THE SUPERNATURAL ONE WHO BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE, WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. AND I'LL NEVER CEASE BEING SUPERNATURAL. I'LL NEVER CEASE BEING ALL POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; I'm sure one day we may, I hope we don't have to regret letting the things of this life, you know, we can have burdens, we can have difficulties, we can have things that we wonder about, BUT DON'T LET IT press us down &gt;&gt; below our spiritual privileges. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING BECAUSE IT'S POPULAR. WHEN I SPEAK about the home and I SPEAK ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I SPEAK ABOUT WIVES, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH. AND I KNOW THAT THE SPIRIT OF THIS AGE IS AGAINST IT. VERY MUCH AGAINST IT. AND I'M AGAINST IT ALSO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this age is a perverted age. in the curtain of time as as true as I'm standing on this platform. He said that the resurrected Jesus Christ is right in this building talking to individuals right now. &gt;&gt; If you could only recognize that it's his voice. I'm not talking about something back in 1955. I'm talking about something that is present in 2011 because that God cannot leave that word. He's as in much attendance to that word as HE WAS BACK THEN. HE CAN'T NEVER LEAVE. HE NEVER LEFT MOSES, NEVER LEFT JESUS, NEVER LEFT THE PROPHETS, NEVER LEFT THE MESSENGERS, AND HE WILL NOT LEAVE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU GOT THAT MESSAGE, AND YOU'RE ABSORBING IT, &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD OF GOD IS OPENING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, FRIENDS. THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT CAN TAKE YOU. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. AMEN. [Music] &gt;&gt; In Jehovah Gyra, &gt;&gt; praise God, &gt;&gt; he's talking to someone. Now, this is not this might sound disconnected, but it's not. In Jehovah Gyra, he said a tumor in the head, but God can heal you. &gt;&gt; That's a serious thing and serious operation, which I would be doubtful of. And I'm not saying that to discourage you, but I want you to have faith in our Lord Jesus who's here now, who knows you. And you know you're standing. You know you're standing in the his presence. The presence of your brother wouldn't let you feel like you that I'm just a man. But you know that he's close. &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring it even know so they can get it separated. You're in front of a man, but that feeling THAT YOU HAVE DIDN'T come from this man. THAT'S HIM AND THIS IS ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. DON'T YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF WITH THIS kind of truth? &gt;&gt; You need him. &gt;&gt; You'll need him. You need him right now. You'll need him tomorrow. You'll need him. You know you're standing in his presence. The presence of your brother wouldn't let you feel like that. I'm just a man. &gt;&gt; But you know he's close. &gt;&gt; In the Queen of the South, he said, "When the supernatural is displayed, it's in the presence of God." Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the supernatural is displayed, don't ever forget when you when you come for prayer or when you're asking for prayer, your wife or husband or whoever or the family prays and the parents pray for the children, the supernatural is there. &gt;&gt; Don't pray just as a matter of uh uh you know, as a matter of habit. Pray in expectation. &gt;&gt; God's going to get a hold of this situation because we're agreeing as mother and dad. We're agreeing as husband. I'm agreeing as my wife. I'm agreeing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING AT YOU. IT'S GREATER THAN ANYTHING. I KNOW YOU FACE THINGS, BUT THE GOD I'M SPEAKING ABOUT IS PRESENT, AND HE'S GREATER THAN THE SITUATION. HE'S A GOD OF THE SUPERNATURAL. in the presence of God unrecognized this message which I've had and asked you to read. He says, "So many, listen close, so many get the same opportunity today to stand in his presence as they did then." And still because of popular opinion or whatever, they turn it down standing in the presence of God. I wonder friend tonight if we people who are Christians in his presence and are sick if we don't turn down the opportunity to be healed by just believing him. &gt;&gt; We who claim to believe him don't recognize really his presence &gt;&gt; when he promised to do what he promised to do today. And he said in uh in uh uh believest thou this and I'm thinking about now notice the approach. I just want to just cover for a few minutes the approach because I I was saying this to the Lord myself. It's it's fine to hear all these things but what is my approach? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of Esther. Do you remember Esther? She needed to approach and she knew it could be death &gt;&gt; if the scepter wasn't held out extended to her. But she knew she had to do it &gt;&gt; regardless with life or death. &gt;&gt; And he said and believest thou this. He said it's your approach to a divine gift. &gt;&gt; Now the gift was a divine gift. Said it's your approach to the divine gift what brings the results. It's the way you come to it. And and he said the way you approach anything and he in door to the heart he said now father thou seeest this now let thy spirit come now and manifest the message and declare it to be the truth grant it father and then he says it'll have a supernatural power to do it but then it'll be according to what you think it is. He said if you if you say it's an evil spirit then you'll get an evil spirit. you'll get an evil spirit's reward. If you think it's the spirit of God, then you will get God's reward. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY, NO ONE CAN AFFORD AN EVIL SPIRIT'S REWARD. DON'T DOUBT GOD'S WORD THAT CAME WITH SUCH VINDICATION. &gt;&gt; SEARCH IT OUT, FRIENDS. IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NEVER HAPPENED, THEN SAY, WHO AM I THAT GOD SHOULD ASSOCIATE ME WITH THIS? WHO AM I THAT GOD SHOULD CALL ME? WHO AM I THAT HE SHOULD CONNECT ME? MAYBE through birth or maybe through a witness from someone else. I was speaking to a brother &gt;&gt; from this assembly and I was relating how I ran into someone who who turned aside from this message perhaps 25 or 30 years ago and wrote articles against it and was proving that the cloud wasn't in existence. And he came into my office one day and he said that I want you to know I've turned away. I don't believe in this. I don't believe in this cloud. In fact, as I've I've proven through research, da da da da da da, that the cloud was nothing more than a missile that was uh that was destroyed over sent out from Edward's uh uh is that Edwards Fort Edwards base in in California or something and the prevailing winds and they had all the winds and had all the techn I said I said, "Well, I that's not my main. I don't just stand up and preach a cloud. I said, Elisha or Elijah, Elisha, it was his servant. He sent a servant out to go go. He said, "What do you see?" He said, "I see a cloud rising from &gt;&gt; the earth." I said, "Did it come from the mist? Did it just come what c what caused the cl the cloud to rise out of the earth? What made the mist? What made the cloud? I don't know. Elijah didn't say. Elisha didn't say, what was important was the shape. &gt;&gt; What shape is it? It's the shape of a man's hand. &gt;&gt; What shape was this one? It was the shape of the FACE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE. THE SUPERNATURAL HAD TO HAPPEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT GOD WHO CONTROLS THE WINDS AND THE SPACE AND EVERYTHING GAVE SHAPE TO THAT VERY HEAD OF JESUS CHRIST AS THE WIG JUDGE &gt;&gt; looking down on the earth. &gt;&gt; And I sat in the meeting and brother Brandham held that up. &gt;&gt; He said, "How many have seen this?" &gt;&gt; Pretty well all had seen it. He said, "They got it the wrong way in the magazine." and he turned it and I saw you could hear a gasp come over the whole audience. We saw Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I held it out to a girl that when we got back to our home, I said, "Who's this?" She said, "Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Theologians maybe can't see it, &gt;&gt; but simple people can see it. &gt;&gt; It was the shape of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "Oh, well, Brother Brenham wasn't there and he was there and people, hey, don't get wrapped up in all that nonsense." &gt;&gt; And people come up with articles like that. I don't even pay any attention to it. What Why should we have unindicated, &gt;&gt; UNPROVEN VOICES AND MEN RISING UP TO, YOU KNOW, CORRECT THINGS THAT BROTHER Brandham said and and because it's not, you know, just technically in line, etc., etc. I just say nonsense. I hope you support me in that. &gt;&gt; I just say nonsense &gt;&gt; because WHY WOULD I TAKE HERE'S HERE'S SOMEONE THAT GOD VINDICATED. &gt;&gt; GOD PROVED &gt;&gt; FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS MINISTRY TO THE END OF THE MINISTRY. WHO AM I WITH a little puny brain or SOME OTHER PERSON? NO PROOF, NO VINDICATION, NO NOTHING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I may be a simple person, but that's never bothered me. &gt;&gt; What people say as a go ahead, have it. Get a belly full of it. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean anything to me. The only thing that means SOMETHING TO ME IS THUS SAYITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND YOUR NAME IS SUCH AND SUCH. THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. GO BACK HOME. YOU'RE WELL. &gt;&gt; One of them laying here says that's a difficult one. That's a difficult one. It's epilepsy. That dark cloud. IT'S EPILEPSY. AND SPEAK TO HER AND GO HOME NOW AND BE FREE FROM IT. HOW CAN YOU GET FREE OF EPILEPSY THAT FAST? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The spirits come now, excuse me, another few minutes to manifest the message and declare it to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it'll have to be supernatural power to do it. &gt;&gt; And then it'll be according to what you think it is. &gt;&gt; If you think it's an evil spirit, then you'll get an evil spirit's reward. &gt;&gt; WHAT POWERFUL THINGS? WHOEVER, WHATEVER PREACHER EVER SAID anything like that OUT OF THE SAME RESOURCE. IF YOU THINK SO. That's why it was important. What you think? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IN YOUR THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHO DO YOU THINK THIS IS? &gt;&gt; I'M SPEAKING IT. BUT IF IT'S NOT IF IT'S NOT THE TRUTH, GOD WON'T VINDICATE IT. BUT IF IT'S THE TRUTH, GOD WILL VINDICATE IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? SAY, I BELIEVE IT'S GOD. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE HOLY SPIRIT. AND I SAY TO YOU, GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS HIM. GOD BLESS YOU. &gt;&gt; GO AND RECEIVE SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE. &gt;&gt; It's ours. [Music] Perhaps if God allows me another time, I began to ask a question to myself, and I'll leave this with you. How did how did Abraham, our father in the faith, how did how did he ever attain friendship with God? till God would say, "You're my friend." That's supreme, sublime. You're my friend. But if you read about Abraham, if you read about him, you know, one of the outstanding things God said to Abraham, "Leave your home, leave your kindred, leave this, and go to a place I'm going to show you." And the Bible says, "And he rose up and left." &gt;&gt; That was one of the things. And then you go over to the 22nd chapter of Genesis. And the Bible says, "And God tried Abraham." You know, we all, and I'm looking at you, we all have had things of trials at at different levels. And some of them have just trials that would grind a person. And that's exactly what the word is. It's it's it's the same as you've heard me say it here before. It's the same as an assay test in a mine where they drill a mine and come up with a core and then they grind the core. There's rock and stuff. They grind it to powder to actually fine powder and then they sift that through and they add chemicals to it. And that's called the assay test. That's exactly the word in in in Genesis 22:1. And God tempted or he tried Abraham. Now he's going to grind him finer than he's ever been ground before. And that's what he said. Take your son Your only son. Are you Joseph? Which one are you? &gt;&gt; All right. Take your son and assume you don't have a brother. You do have. So your only son. There were other children, but this was one by promise. And take him up to a place that I will show you. and there offer him as a burnt offering. You know what the Bible says? And he rose up early in the morning. &gt;&gt; He didn't go into a dialogue and say, "Well, wasn't this a a son of promise? Wasn't this a child that came? Didn't you promise this son to me?" THERE WAS NO DIALOGUE. THERE'S NO DISCUSSION. THERE'S NO NOTHING. HE GETS UP EARLY IN THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; HE'S SO QUICK TO OBEY. &gt;&gt; What am I talking about? Approach. &gt;&gt; AND THEN SOMETIMES GOD TALKS TO US AND HE SAYS IT AGAIN, says it again, says it again, begging us like, you know, won't you do it? Won't you do it? No. If you want to be like Abraham and enter into that kind of relationship, he rose up early in the morning &gt;&gt; and uh and he cut the kindling. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He prepared THE KINDLING. HE SPLIT the wooden &gt;&gt; and he GOT THE DONKEYS, THE ASSES RATHER, got them and two young men and he set off three days journey. I don't know what went through his mind, but it wasn't much conversation. three days going to offer my son and he's packing the wood saying Jesus didn't say anything why have I got this cross why am I packing this wood &gt;&gt; and on the third day Isaac says Father, he asked, "My son, behold the fire and the wood. Where's the lamb for a burnt offering? He'd seen it. He He knew it was happening. He knew all the time. Not that he was being offered, but he knew all the time that that's what was to happen. They got the wood. They got the fire. Where's the lamb? &gt;&gt; I preached on it years ago and I don't want you to forget it. Yeah, we've got the seats. We've got the people. We're all on our journey. We've got the preacher, the ministers, deacons, songs, musicians, instruments. I hope we never have to say, &gt;&gt; "But where's the lamb?" &gt;&gt; Where is this one &gt;&gt; who's amongst us? May he always be welcome here. May he be loved here. May be he endeared to us here. &gt;&gt; And after three days, where's the lamb? And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb." That's why he was a friend. Though you take everything from me, though you grind me down, &gt;&gt; as Job said, yet in my flesh shall I see God, though your health goes, though your family goes, though your job goes, though everything your success goes, though your friends go and they call you nasty things and you sit there on your ash heap, just know one thing that your connection with the supernatural is in good condition. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God did provide a lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the same God. &gt;&gt; And he became a friend of God. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; You are children of this presence. I'm not just saying nice things. I say to you, each one of you, and if I could shake your hand today, I would say, God, for some reason, known only to himself, intercepted you. &gt;&gt; Every person would be a completely different testimony. God intercepted you. I look across this congregation. I know the testimony of many of you, and God intercepted you. Yes. &gt;&gt; And called you &gt;&gt; and associated you and connected you with the most supernatural message that has struck the earth since its creation. &gt;&gt; And he did that for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And friends, that's why we're here. I will never never apologize for it. We're here to extend and give this voice &gt;&gt; a mighty effect in the earth. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I would like to sing if I could have the musicians please and you could stand with me. Let's just stand reverently a moment. Tonight, brother John Andy's will be speaking and preaching. We want to come early. Brother Tom will be down in Seattle with the saints down there. We're thankful to be a part of this blessed work. Father, I'm so thankful for your messenger. I'm so thankful for the one that you sent. I am even more thankful that you were in accompanyment with him all the time. So thankful for the word, oh God, that you sent through him, Lord. So thankful for these words that we could even read of of of messages which he spoke and of events which he uh told of and we learn we see secret treasures that are there for us. Father, I ask today for these my beloved beloved friends and brothers and sisters in Christ. Would you please Father, shine upon them, shine upon them with your presence. Oh divine one, lovely Lord Jesus, when the people depart these doors, may every one of them be enveloped in a special place. I would love to hear oh God testimony that this has been their experience. Do Lord as I am experiencing myself feeling a drawing and opening up and and just saying to you, oh God, here I am. I'm I'm in this message. I'm in this message to hear from the divine one. I'm in this message to obtain uh from the supernatural one. God, go to the homes and go with the people in the cars in this afternoon. Lord, may there be a strange and wonderful presence there. We thank you. We thank you. We love you. We pray that you'll receive our thanksgiving. Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, be in attendance with us, Father. Thank you, Lord. in the presence of Jehovah. Brother Ryan, please if you'd help me out there, give him microphone as well, please. In the presence [Music] of Jehovah, God Almighty. [Music] He's the prince of peace. Trles manage hearts are landed in the presence of the king. Would everyone just open their heart now as we sing it again? The praise.

Mighty [Music] Prince of Peace. [Music] Trles, &gt;&gt; troubles vanish, hearts are mened. Oh, thank you Lord in the presence of the king. &gt;&gt; This is one of those services I don't know exactly how to end. I want to pray for you. Do you have a trouble? Do you have something that's weighing you down and you've heard things now and your faith has risen and you'd like to depart these doors and know that it's settled and you've left it here at the foot of the cross. If you'd like to just raise your hand and open your heart to him and I will pray considering it a privilege. Father, these people are so precious to me, to my wife, my family. I thank you for every one of them. I was thinking of the New Year's Eve and how the different ones sang and the song that was sung by the Philippine group. Lord, I ask your blessings upon them. &gt;&gt; Ask your blessings upon each one, oh God. Ask your blessings, Father, upon those that will gather in Seattle today. that you'll give safe journey to your servant as he travels. Father, I pray, oh God, for the bride of Jesus Christ. Pray for all of these precious ones that are here that you've called. &gt;&gt; And there's some, Lord, that may wonder why they're in this service this morning. There may be young people and they haven't really felt your nearness. I ask oh God just give them even a small taste if you would of your nearness and your presence oh God that they might know that they might taste what it is that they might know what it is Lord perhaps some that you would come in such a way that they'd be trembling as they're standing saying I've never felt this way before I've never heard these things before but I I long for you Lord I have a hunger in my heart I'm longing for for you, oh God. I'm longing for you. I've walked many years with you, but I'm longing for more of you, &gt;&gt; Lord. We've tasted our thought this morning. Never thought of it this way, but riding with your prophet in the car and and how you came the pillar of fire coming standing right before us, Lord. The same one was in the burning bush on the mountain, oh God. and calling a prophet to lead his people and to separate them out of bondage. You're the same God here tonight. Lord, I defy any bondage, any demon, any lying spirit to try to keep your people in the in a in a confused state or in dark or or try to pre prevent them, Lord, to come and surrender themselves to you. I pray, Lord, that you will just woo them. Woo them so tenderly. Father, we thank you. Some may be in need of healing, emotional healing, whatever it might be. Let them know that you're their friend. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You're their friend, &gt;&gt; and you're one that'll never leave them, never forsake them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Dismiss us now, I pray, with your grace, [Music] &gt;&gt; and return us this evening, Lord, that we might hear Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm anxious to hear, oh God, what you've laid in view of this service today. In view of what you're doing, I'm anxious to hear what you've laid on brother John Andy's heart. Bless the people now, Father. And when they shake hands with one another, I pray that your blessings will pass from one to another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you turn around and shake hands with those that you want to bless in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] [Music]
