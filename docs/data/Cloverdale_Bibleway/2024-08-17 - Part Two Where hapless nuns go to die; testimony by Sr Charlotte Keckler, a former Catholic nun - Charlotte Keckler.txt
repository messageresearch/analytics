TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi this is David mold from Layman for religious liberty the tape that you're about to listen to is an exceedingly graphic and gripping tape it's a testimony of an ex none by the name of Sister Charlotte whom disappeared approximately 2 years after having given this testimony if you have young children with you you may wish to screen this tape and listen to it yourself before determining whether you want your child to hear the material that is on it we're releasing this in Jamaica not that we might engender any hatred toward the Roman Catholic church or the Roman Catholic people but rather that you might be educated educated as to the other side of Roman Catholicism the pope is coming sometime around October 12th 1992 wouldd like to flood Jamaica with copies of this tape that when he comes some brave soul might be inspired to ask well John Paul what can you tell us about Sister Charlotte to be for wared is to be forarm you probably receive this tape without paying anything for it we wish to let you know that you have our permission to duplicate it as many many times as you wish but please do not charge give the tapes away spread them far and wide that Jamaica might receive the education of a lifetime thank you testimony [Music] if mayy Jesus in there is the crucifix and then we have a prayer board and by the way I assure you folk that you'll never want to kneel on our prayer board we kneel on it every day if we are able to walk under our own power it is a board uh about this high from the ground and they're too leading up like this one and this one is about that wide I'm going to drop my knees down on it and they sharp wires coming up through that board and then this one up here I prostrate my arms on there's going to be sharp wires after all I told you we were going to suffer we were going to do Penance and this is a part of my suffering and as I kneel on that prayer board I'm praying for lost humanity and I'm believing as I suffer that my grandmother will be released from a priest Purgatory sooner because of my suffering and I'll kneel there longer sometimes oh it's terrible but we don't know any better so we do that because that's all that little nun does know and we believe it and there we are and we are locked in our Sals every night the key is turning those doors we can't get up and come out of there and then more than that 7 Minutes of 12 we go to bed at 9:30 the lights are out 7 Minutes of 12 there's two little nuns appointed to unlock every door every little nun again gets on her feet dresses and full dress goes into the inner chapel and there we again pray one hour for lost Humanity we don't get very much sleep that's why and we don't have enough food and we work hard and we suffer much that's why our bodies are so broken that's why we seemingly don't have enough strength to carry on after we live there but i' like to say this to you as I go before I go any further now I did those various things we are taught to believe that as we spill our own blood now we must do this as I whip my body if I torment it or torture it in any way that I spill blood I I'm taught to believe that I'll have one 100 less days to spend in purgatory now you know we have no hope those little nuns don't look forward to anything you may think they do but we don't why after you live in a Convent 10 years I began to realize the Virgin Mary is just a piece of metal she's a statue I began to realize St Peter is just a statue I began to realize that the statue of Jesus is just a piece of metal in other words we come to the place to believe that our God is a dead God and I'll assure you after you live in a Convent long enough not at first oh no but after we've suffered enough after we've uh seem many fallen down at the Fe of those statues and Spilled our tears on them and have begged them to intercede and get a pray through to God and years go vation of whatsoever a parent won't even know when they're dance so who's going to pray us out of purgatory or rather buy us out of purgatory no we realize after we're in there for a period of time that there is no purgatory and I of course you know there isn't and I know there isn't and there is no Purgatory the only Purgatory the Roman Catholic people have is a priest pocket and they're filling his pockets with coins in order to pray for the dead and may I say there are thousands and thousands of Roman Catholics in the month of November may I say to you in United States two years ago in the month of November Roman Catholic priest praying uh masses for the dead of the Roman Catholic people in this country in one month collected 22 million for masses said for dead Roman Catholics that's just a little idea a sample of what's going on in this country and still there are thousands of mothers that'll work their fingers to the Bone to go over there and give the priest another $5 to say a Mass for a loved one that's in a Purgatory because that mother believes there is a Purgatory in the convent they have a painting of purgatory and there's nothing in the room but just that painting and you know every Friday we have to walk around that painting and when we walk around it I would you could look at the little nun's faces what do I see the painting as you would walk around it it looks like it's a big deep hole out there and there are people down in there and the flames of fire is lapping around the bodies of those people and their hands are outstretched like this and the mother will say to the little nuns you better go and put another Penance on your body those people are begging to get out of that fire and because we're heated since we don't know any better I might go someplace in the convent and maybe I'll burn my body real bad maybe I'll torture it some way and spill some more blood because as I suffer I believe they're going to get out of that place where a priest puts them and there are millions of people so to speak in purgatory that your priest have put there and when he knows it is the biggest fraud there is in the world he knows there's not a bit of truth to it and bless your heart I often say you take purgatorian Mass away from the Roman Catholic Church you'll Rob her of nine tents of her living she'll starve to death if you would take it away from her she commercializes not only off of the living but off of the dead and on and on it goes all right it doesn't bother a Mother Superior to take one of those dear little girls and may I say you know when the priest come into the convent they come as our father confessors once a month we go to confession and we don't want to go don't you worry I many the time have got in the very back roll I didn't want to go in there I know who's out there one of them I would may not know the particular man but I know he's a and I know those trees I I certainly have seen them enough I've lived there long enough I I certainly have had contact with every one of them and I'll assure you this one thing I don't trust one single one of those in the convent now we're not telling you about every priest I don't know all the priests I'm just talking about the Convent in my personal testimony of convent life and you know we know something about what's out in that room and here we are we know we're going to confession today it may take all day long and here he comes and I have never seen a Roman Catholic priest come into the convent that I was in without intoxicating liquor under his belt and I say a man or a woman regardless of who you may be when you get liquor under your Bel you're not a man neither are you a woman you become an animal and a beast and so we have a beast sitting out there there's a straight uh back heart bottom chair no other Furniture but the crucifix of the Virgin Mary but here he is sitting on that chair right out there in the middle of that room now here a little girl has to walk out there alone and she has to kneel down think of it why bless your heart I I really sometimes I'm saved now I'm out of the convent and I now look back at that Roman Catholic priest and I often say I'm sure he was a twin brother to the devil because he's full of sin he's full of Vice he's full of corruption and we go out there and kneel down at his knees now are you're a lucky girl if you get away from that man without being destroyed why he's drunk he's a beast he's not a man oh he has a holy habit on he's an ordained Roman Catholic priest and so I'll assure you we don't like to go to confession but we must go once a month and those little girls can't help themselves and nobody comes out out into that room but the priest and I until it's all over and then we can come back and the next one will have to come and I'll assure you we don't appreciate that day and those little girls don't know any better they don't know anything about the Plan of Salvation they don't know that Jesus went to Calvary and died for them they don't know that he shed his blood for them those little girls know nothing about it because to me as I repeat again the Bible was a hidden book to every one of those little girls and so now they can do things like this now if a Roman Catholic priest comes into the convent he may go to the Mother Superior and ask her to permit him to go into the sail where one of the nuns are and you know that mother with her carnal mind and her carnal heart and she's very hard and very carnal and she is the mother many times of many illegitimate children they belong to the priest Andre know she'll take that priest and he's drinking she knows it they bring liquor in with them sometimes some of the nuns will drink with them and the mother usually drinks with them and it's really a terrible place it is not a religious order it does not uh live up to that name whatsoever but here she brings that priest into one of our sales now I wonder if you realize how serious it is uh that Roman Catholic priest he has liquor under his belt we know that but he has a big b strong body he's had three square meters of food every day of his life he can eat all the food that he wants but you know there's a little nun that may have a broken body and she may not have very much strength and what he was e what did he come into that cell for for nothing other than to destroy that little nun I often say I wish the government could walk into a Convent just about the time one of those priests are let in the sail the mother will turn a key on the lock and you're locked in there with that priest now we have no way to defend ourselves and I often say I have had to nurse those little girls I'm an Aran I got my nurses training by going through the tunnel over to the through the hospital uh as I lived in a an open order Convent but may I say uh after that priest is taken out of there if you could look upon the body of that little nun she looks like something you've thrown out in a hug pan and a half a dozen old SS have just mauled that child's body and this is Convent Li I can understand why your priests are calling over the phone every day or two and screaming their heads off because I'm in this city giving this testimony but may I say to you I don't mind if they continue to scream I don't mind what they do I'm not one bit afraid of them I'll continue to give this testimony as long as God gives me strength I'll be giving this testimony regardless of your priests or your Bishops in this country I know what I'm doing I know what I'm saying and I'm not afraid of any body in all of this world I'm a child of God and I believe God won't let anybody put a hand on me until my work is finished and then I often say I don't care what you do to my body after I leave this body I'm sure I don't mind and so I I will continue to give the testimony regardless of what your priest think about it because I I think God saved me to pull the cover off of convent I believe he saved me to uncloak those places that are riding under the cloak of religion I believe that with all of my heart I'll assure you I do now if I refuse to give my body you know we're just supposed to give our bodies voluntarily to those trees many times the nuns are overpowered but if I refuse to give my body voluntarily to them then you know he becomes very angry and he goes immediately to the Mother Superior then when two caral minds come to come together they can invent things that you and I we don't have enough evil in our heart to invent things like that we don't have enough sin in our lives to even think of such terrible things and when those two cardal minds come together uh the next time I want you to know they're all ready now the Mother Superior might say to me in a day or two we're going to do pennis now the pennis that they'll inflict on me is something that the Mother Superior and the priest has invented and it can be very very cruel they might take me down into one of the dirty Dungeons and there's no floors in those places and you know they have uh a place down there there are rods about three feet long they have them a burrow down into cmit and at the top of it there's a ring about this big out sticking out of the ground they have some leather straps fastened there and when they take me down there they put my foot I their foot through go through those rings and then they strapped my ankle securely now I'm standing with my feet in those Rings all right they're going out of there they're going to leave me locked up in that place by myself and it's a dirty Place well I might stand there for two or three hours if I have strength enough in my body but what do you think's going to happen to me then I can't stand any longer sometimes we faint sometimes we just become exhausted and and we go down but when I go down he flips my ankles over like that and I can't do anything about it I don't have what it takes for me to get up I may have to lie in that position for two or three days and no one will come near they won't give me a bite of food they won't bring me one drop of water but I must stay there and the next thing you feel is the bugs crawling over my body and the mice running over me and I still have to stay there I can understand why they don't want me to uncover they don't want the world to know these things are going on no priest in this country wants it and if he doesn't want the these the world to know it then they better be pretty careful that nobody ever gets out of a Convent after they spent a few years back there but may I say again to you my God God he's greater than all the outside forces my God can reach his hand over into those convs this country any other country and make a way for a girl to come out and he won't have to ask the bishop to help him he won't have to ask the priest to help him but God can make a way for us to come out I'll assure you that well on it goes then sometimes the priests come and they get angry at us because we refuse to sin with them voluntarily and you know after all uh the uh the nun's bodies are broken after we're there a while and many many the time to have him strike you in the mouth is a terrible thing I've had my front teeth knocked out I know what it's all about and then we'll get you down on the floor and then kick you in the stomach many of those precious little girls have babies under their heart and it doesn't bother a priest to kick you in the stomach with a baby under your heart he doesn't mind the baby's going to be killed anyway because those babies are born into con why wouldn't babies be born when you run places like this under the cloak of religion the world thinks it's religious orders and there are babies born in Dale and most of the babies are premature many of them are abnormal very very seldom do we ever see a normal baby you say sister sh do you dare to say that I most definitely do dare to say this and I intend to keep on saying it why I've delivered those babies with these hands and what I've seen with my eyes and I've done with my hands I just challenge the whole world to say it isn't true and the only way they can ever prove it isn't true they'll have to open if they ever serve a summons on me and call me into court I'll assure you this one thing convents are coming open and then the world is going to know what convents really are and they'll have to open them to vindicate my testimony because I know what I'll do if they ever serve a summons on me I've been before the highest laws we have in the United States I know what I'm doing I know what I can say and I'm not one bit afraid to say it because I've been a part of this I've been connected with this system 22 years behind Convent doors and it is a terrible thing after when that dear little gun looking forward to that day when her precious baby will be born most of you dear mothers oh you have everything ready the beautiful Nursery all the baby's beautiful clothes are made everything is lovely you're looking forward to that that precious little Immortal soul is going to be born into your home and everything is ready and oh I wish you could see that little nun she's not looking forward to that there won't ever be a blanket around his body they'll never even they'll never bathe the B that baby's body but he can only leave four or five hours and then the Mother Superior will take that baby and put her fingers in its nostril and still cover its mouth and snuff his little life out and why did they build the lime pitch in the convent what is the reason for building them if it isn't to to kill the babies and that baby will be taken into the line pit and chemical and line is put over its body and that's the end of babies oh when I think about it that's why I try to challenge people pray if you know how to pray you know how to contact God pray and ask God to deliver the con girls from behind Convent doors in other words pray that God will make a way for every Convent in the United States to be opened and let the government go in and when the government goes in you won't have to worry the convents will be open the nuns will be taken out and they'll be closed up just as they opened the convents in Old Mexico so in 1934 there are no convents in Old Mexico every cluster it is open and they found all of the corruption back there the lime pit if any of you are taking a vacation go over into Old Mexico the P the government owns them their public museums and go through the convi look with your own eyes touch with your own hands and then come home and see if you believe my testimony it'll stir every bit of red blood in your veins I mean it'll do something to you that nothing else has ever been able to do go through them and look at them go into the D dungeons go into the tunnels go through the here look at the skulls rooms of skulls over there and then ask the Guides of where they come from and go and see the all of the devices of torture they placed upon the bodies of the little nuns go into their their cells and look at their beds and see for yourself oh yes you can go it'll cost you 25 cents to go through each one of them you look at those things and see them for yourself and then come home and maybe it'll give you a greater burden to pray for little girls that have been enticed behind Convent Doors by the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church I wonder how you would feel if this was your child and remember I have a mother and daddy or had one and they love me just as much as you love your children and when they let me go into the convent I'm sure my mother and daddy didn't expect these things to happen because they didn't know they never dreamed a Convent was like this but you know I wonder how you'd feel if you could walk in someday and out there in this particular room that floor is built for this purpose there's a a petition right out there and there's just a little the thing they can touch it automatically opens and you know there's a deep hole underneath that floor and this little nun has done something I can't tell you what she's done because I wasn't there when she done it but she's done something and to them it's very serious and when they bring her they bring her to this particular place her little hands and feet are going to be bound securely they're going to drop her in that horrible horrible pit and then they're going to put the boards back down no one will ever know oh there's plenty of chemical and line down there but you know they don't do that six little nuns have to walk around that hole we'll chant as we walk around that hole we don't want any evil spirits to come out into the convent so we sprinkle holy water over that hole that we may walk for six hours and then they'll appoint six more nuns and on and on it goes until we have hear the last moan and that's the end of the little nun they place down there no she'll never be delivered from the convi but does it bother you to know that that little nun will die and be lost does that bother you it bothers me because I didn't know Jesus I couldn't tell her about God I didn't know him myself but it bothers me very very much but God won't hold me accountable her blood will not be on my hands because I didn't know the Lord and I couldn't tell her about it and so on it goes then I wonder how you like to see it here we are a body of those little nuns on this particular morning the Mother Superior might sa is we're all going to be lined up here and I don't know what she's lining me up for and then you know there might be Ken of us there might be 15 of us and then she tell us all to strip and we have to take every Stitch of our clothing off we're certainly not anything beautiful to look at our eyes are back in our head our cheeks are falling in our bodies are wasted God only knows what we look like because I never saw myself in 22 years I didn't know I had gray hair I didn't know I had lines in my face I didn't know how old I was I only found that out about six years ago you know nothing about what you look like and here we are lined up and here comes two or three Roman Catholic priests with liquor under their failed and there they're going to march in front of those nud girls and choose the girl they want to take to the sail with them these are convs clustered convin not open orders the priest can do anything he wants to in hide behind the cloak of religion then that same Roman Catholic priest will go back into the Roman Catholic churches and there he'll say mess and there he'll go into the confessional box and make those poor people believing can give them Absolution from their sin when he's full of sin when he's full of corruption and vice still he acts as their God what a terrible thing it is and all it goes well I live there now all the time these things are going on what you think's happening inside of Charlotte God love your hearts I didn't know people could hold so much hatred and bitterness and it went on and on and on I was filled with bitterness and hatred and I mean it continued to Bild I began in my heart to think when I can get the Mother Superior in a certain place I'll kill her isn't it awful to get murder in our hearts I didn't go in the convent with a heart like that nor a mind like that but I be began to plan murder in the convy how I could kill her how I could kill a Roman Catholic priest and on and on it goes and oh I tell you every time she did fix something awful on my body that I'd have to suffer so terribly when I could think sensibly again then I would begin to plan how could I kill that woman and on it goes well after all you can't help it for instance I wonder how you would feel the Mother Superior here she is and she's going to sit me down in a chair and you know H that chair is a straight back hard bottom and I I don't have any hair she's going to take care of things off my head and you know she's going to put my hands like this they'll be out here in stocks I'm going to have to bend my head over like that in order to put the stalks across my neck and I'm fastened securely and over my head there is a faucet of water and you know sorry there is a faucet of water just above my head and my head's over now that Mother's going to turn that water on just a drop and the drop will just come about this fast it'll hit me right there on the back of my head and you know I can't move either way I sat there one hour two hours three hours four hours what you think's going on I'm sitting there I can't move I do everything to get away from that drop of water in the same spot on my head why God love your heart if you could look in you'd see us rooing at the mouth you'd see those little girls they're trying so hard to move to get away from that water and they let us stay there sometimes 10 hours all day long many many times a little none crack some cups cracks up completely she goes Stark raving mad under this particular pennant what in the world do they do with her I tell you in a few minutes don't you worry they have a place for us after we go mad in the convent they take care of us they have places for the little nuns there's places built down there far well on it goes well you know these things went on and went on and went on and it was terrible but you know I began to plan and plan and playing after she's done something like that to me it's terrible one day the Mother Superior took violently ill you say who would take her place there are about three sometimes they have four older nuns and they always pick the one that's hard the one that seem as seemingly as carnal that one that has no conscience To Be A Mother Superior and she works under this one one day if something happens to the main Mother Superior another one will take her place and on it goes but you know this time particular day they sent word to me the Mother Superior I was to come into her room she's very sick and quick as en lightening I began to think if I got in that mother superior's room I know what I'll do you know after all I'm a sinner I'm a nun but I'm a sinner and I don't know God and I have a lot of hatred in my heart and I walk in that room they have called in an outside Roman Catholic doctor she's a very sick woman and he has left all orders and they left the medicine and everything now I'm supposed to take care of her and that was wonderful and I do take care of her all day long I did what they told me to do what I'm supposed to do and those particular tablets I knew what they were and I knew what they would do and what she was thinking them for but anyway all day long I gave her her medicine I done everything I'm supposed to all evening long why I want to be sure what I'm doing what I do I have to be careful and you know I waited until uh 1:00 in the morning why because every night those little nuns have to be gotten out of bed and go chant from 1 or from 1200 to 1 7 minutes at 12 to one I thought I'll wait all the nuns go back to bed then I'm going to do something and bless your hearts after they were all back in their beds I'll tell you what I did I took five or six of those tablets I was only supposed to take one in a half a glass of water ever so long and give it to her but because of the type they were and what the type of uh tablet was I knew what it would do I put six of them in the glass of water and stirred them up and I gave them to her I knew she would go into convulsions it would twist her completely out of shape I knew that woman would suffer a million deaths within 25 minutes on knew that and I thought I'm going to watch her suffer because she has punished us she has hurt us so many thousands of times I'll watch her suffer isn't it terrible to think a child can be live living a place like that long enough until she has the same kind of a heart almost the Mother Superior has but that's what comes When sin gets in your life and so I waited you know I gave them to her and I something happened to me I got scared and I looked at that moment and she began to change color and I couldn't find her P I couldn't find her respiration I was frightened and I thought oh what shall I do if they find her dead only God knows what they'll do to me I'll tell you what I did I got that stomach punk I pump as quick as I could I pumped that woman's stomach I'm a s that woman I done everything there was to do oh thank God she didn't die I said I thank God but you know I sat down by the bed and held her hand and watched her carefully until the restoration came back normal until her pulse was normal and I felt she would live and I thought of another thing I'll do this then I saw where her keys were hid in her shelf right there in her own room so they're on a big chain or on a big ring and I thought I'm going to take those keys I'm going down into that dungeon there's a when I say down this is two stories under the ground I I'm going someplace where she's always wanders it's a solid wall like that and clear to the back end of that wall there's one door and it's heavy and it's always locked and I've heard her tell me scores of times and I'm sure she has the others don't ever try to go through that door what in the world is over there and why did she tell us that we can't get through it it's locked but you know I wondered what was back there because when they had me in the dungeon for a long time once I heard screams under the ground I heard such blood curdling screams and I knew there were some girls locked up somewhere and so I'm going through there if I find the key and so I got her keys and I went into that particular place and when I got back there it took a while to do it I watch you know to find the key but all when didn't unlock that door I walk through that door and I walk into a hall the hall I would say was maybe five feet wide maybe wider than that that's just a a gas and anyway uh on the other side of the hall there were a number of sails over there small rooms and they had real heavy doors and in those cells were little nuns and when I went up to the first one uh near the top of the door there's a little place about this long it's about that wide it has iron bars going across there and I looked right into the face of a little nun that I knew knew one that I'd sit across the table from one that I prayed with in the chapel I knew that girl and here she is and they had chains and log chains around either of her wrist and around her waistline and I said when did you have something to eat last and no answer how long you been here no answer I went down to the second the third the fourth the fifth and the stench was getting so bad I couldn't stand it and you know those little girls would not talk why I lived in the convent you know a long time and every I don't care if I was two miles under the convent way back there we were working back there and we whisper the next day I'd have to suffer because the convents are wired and the Mother Superior can hear every voice every whisper and then somebody tails and you're in some serious trouble and those none has been there long enough what have they done I don't know but those nuns supposed to have cracked up mentally and so they have put them in those chains and when they die they can't fall down to the floor they're just dropping those chains and slump when they go in there they don't give them any more food no more water that's a slow down and so I as I saw all of that I became so sick from the terrible Stitch because many of them are already dead I don't know how long they've been dead I came out of there and walked back up to this room where the mother Saia was and she was lying there sleeping and I watched her carefully and she slept till her the next day a long long hours and didn't waken and when she did she said I've had a long sleep and I said yes they let me take care of her for three days and you know the third day I don't know you say did she ever find out she was down there well not yet I hope she didn't while I was there but anyway at three days they put me out in the kitchen uh in other words when we go to the kitchen six of us go for a six weeks period and this particular time they put me out in the kitchen with five other little nuns what am I there for I'm doing the kitchen work I'm going to do all the cooking that's done out there and take care of the the work in the kitchen and so when I went out in the kitchen we have a long table back here and it's a work table and our vegetables will be be prepared for the soup and that's what we were doing all six of us and something happened our kitchen is a very large room and a very long room not as wide as it is long and over one end of it you will find over here the stair steps leading about four of them leading down then there's a landing right there over there's a big heavy outside door but here there's a landing our garbage can sit there and right here is a Stairway cement one leading down one story under the ground now I'm up on first floor in this kitchen all right as I'm in there and we're there working something happen somebody catched a garbage can you know all my Convent life we are taught never to break silence we don't dare to make noises in the convent we are punished for them and when something touched the garbage can that's a noise and who in the world sixs of us and we're all together who's touching the garbage can I wheeled around and they wheeled around and we saw a man I don't you know that man was picking up the full can leaving an empty one I've never seen that before I've been in that Convent for years but I and in the kitchen but I never saw anything like that happen I believe God had his hand on me with all my heart I believe it and you say what happened well and we turned around quickly because to us it's a martal sin to look upon a man other than a Roman cathic priest and I mean we turned around quick and went to our work but you know I thought if that man comes back again to get another Pool can I'm going to give him a note and I'm going to ask him if I can run out with him but I didn't do that but you know what I did when we run out of something in the kitchen there's a pencil hanging up there on the chain and bless your heart I have to whoever it is runs out you have to write it on a tab and of course I stole a piece of paper off of a sack and I thought I'll carry that little piece of paper in my spirit pocket and every time I can get a hold of that pencil I'm going to write a word or two on a note and that's what I did it took quite a while to do it but oh I watched that garbage can every time I could take the garbage down there I did it and you know when it was just about full and I thought the next evening it'll be full when we put all the garbage in it and so the that afternoon I broke my crucifix and I laid it up on a shelf and I had a hard time doing it because they're watching me but I did it and I laid it up on a shelf and I did that to have a way to get back to that uh room of course and so I uh when our dinner work is over our suppar dishes everybody has to go out at the time and we marched by the Mother Superior and you know when I marched by I stopped and said please may I speak to you and I did and I said Mother Superior I broke my crucifix and I left it in the kitchen may I go for it and of course no none goes without her crucifix and she said how did you break it I lied to her everything she asked me I lied to her uh you say why did you lie she lies to us and we're all Sinners so we all lie and it doesn't make any difference in there and so we lied and I lied to her and then finally she said you go get the crucifix and come right back and that's all I wanted anyway I have to have a reason you can't go back to the kitchen after you've left it and so I didn't go for the crucifix but she thought I did and I run for this uh 10 can why that night when I put my garbage in there I put a note right on top of that garbage and left the lid off which I was not supposed to do and you know I said on the note to the garbage man if you get this won't you please help me out won't you do something to help the little nuns out I told him about those 19 cells down there and those 19 nuns any I told him about some of the baby that have been killed I told him some other little nuns that are locked up in the Dungeons and they're bound with chains I told him of Plenty and I said won't you help us and if you will please leave a note under the empty can that's what I went back for and when I lifted up the can and found a note you don't know how I felt I froze to the floor I was so scared I didn't know what to do I picked that piece of paper up and I read and this is what that man said I'm leaving that door unlocked and I leave the big iron gate unlocked you come out oh let me tell you that's almost more than you D well I never dreamed I'd get out of a Convent I never thought of everything getting out I wanted out but you say h oh yes I when I could collect myself I reached over and turned the knob and you know it was UN open I walked out of that Convent and I slammed it too I was sure the lock was on it and I got out to the Big Iron Gate but oh he had me trapped that Iron Gate was just as locked as it was ever locked you don't know what it done for me to stand there looking at the Iron Gate I'm locked out of the convent I have no right out there you can't imagine I don't know if I grew old right there I don't know I know I suffered enough because I'm scared after death and what will I do if I go back and pound on that door what will they do with me and all the fear that grips your heart AR you say what'd you do I didn't have any shoes and stockings on I'd wore those out years ago when I think of the Roman Catholic Church being the richest Church in the world and they let those little nuns go winter and summer without any shoes and uh without any hose living in crucial poverty I wonder how they can do it hungry as we are your priests are all nice and fat the little nuns are so hungry I wonder how they do it sometimes you say what did you do Charlotte well I'll tell you I just took a hold of that big old iron gauge and I tried to climb it that's all there was for me to do and up about a foot and a half from the top is a ledge about 6 Ines wide I thought if I could get high enough to get my knee on the ledge I'm safe and I did I got one knee on the ledge but but this time I don't have any strength left over and you know I thought what do I do I I'll put one foot over then I'll get the other over then I realized you know I have three skirts on my skirts are gathered on the belts and they're clear down to my ankles my veil of course is down to my knees in front and that long in the back how will I ever get over those sharp points and I thought I can't go down I don't have strength enough so I'll have to jump and if I jump I'll break every bone because I was broken body of course and you know I thought I do well I I pulled all my clothing up around my body and held them with one hand and then I thought I'd have to jump and you know they have a buzzer in the convent and when a little nun tries to escape and they catch her they put a buzzer on and oh it's the priest tell you they don't come to the convent I would you could see the priest then you'll find a good many of them there and they immedately hour after that none they don't want her out if she comes out of that Convent she's going to give a testimony someday and it'll pull the cloak off of convent and I'll assure you they don't intend Force to get out and so I as I let loose to that uh top of that gate and I made that jump I just didn't make it my clothing caught on top of those points and I hung there but I'd let loose and I often say you know I don't know what I look like I don't know I didn't know I had gray hair but I've often said maybe my hair turned gray there maybe you'll never know what I suffered hanging on top of that gate knowing that buzzer can go on any minute and then what would they do to me I was scared so I thought I tried to wiggle my body and to for swing it if I can get back far enough to grab the gate with one hand maybe I can help myself and I did and then with the other hand I tried to pry the Snappers loose on my skirt and that let me fall between them do you know what happened to me I hit the ground I was out I was unconscious for a while I don't know how long no we have no way to tell but when I came to I had a shoulder broken and my arm was broken right in here the fles the Bon it's right through my flesh because I didn't have any meat on me and I thought what do I do and I I realize I'm on the outside and where am I going where do you think you'd go I'm not in the United States I'm in another country and I don't know thing about that country when they took me over there I was heavily veiled and they took me from the that particular car or train to the cony I was heavily bailed I couldn't see anything and I don't know where I am I don't know where to go I don't know if I have any people I don't know if I know anybody in the world now I'm a puffer I don't have any money and I I'm hungry and my body's broken and I'm hurt now where do you think you go I tell you with something to think about I just started away but get away from the convent and I did and I started moving away and all the leaves were falling and they made so much noise and I was scared and I kept on moving and finally dark overtook me air or rather there's no Twilight in that part of the country it just drops off into darkness and you know I saw this with a building beside the road and I I thought I'll crawl in it with a dogghouse or maybe Chicken Coop or something but it was dirty and I crawled in there because I was shaking and scared and I laid in there for a little while to get a hold of myself and then I thought I'll have to travel it's dark it's safer for me so I got out and travel that night and the next day I hid behind pieces of board and Tin that was piled up against an old building and all day long imagine hiding in that hot place and hungry as I was with broken bones do you realize what it was all about no you'll never know but I do and then you know when night came again I have to go because I'm going to get away from the cony I'm afraid to rrap on somebody's door remember I'm scared I don't know I might wrap on a Roman catholic's door they will immed Ely un notifying the priest and I'll be taken back to the convent and I'd rather they kill me than take me back and so I didn't but I went on and on and on and then the next night or next day I hit out in an old STW Stag and then that afternoon on the third day I was scared then because this arm had swollen as tight as it could SP well I was having to carry it in the other hand and all my fingers began to turn blue and I realized garine poisoning setting in and you know I nobody to do anything for you and I realize I'm going to die just like a rat beside the road that's a terrible feeling and I thought what do I do I'll just get out and go a little sooner maybe I'll have to wrap on somebody's door and that's what I did I remember as I walked I don't know how far I saw this lamp it was an oldfashioned lamp burning very poor house no paint on it and I knew those were poor people so I walked up to the screen door and I wrapped on it and a tall man came to the door he was rather old and I said please may I have a drink of water and you know that old man didn't answer me but he walked back in the house and called his wife and God bless her heart she's like most oldfashioned mother she came to the door and she didn't say who are you and what do you want thank God there are a lot of good people in this world that dear little woman just pushed that door open and said won't you come in and sit down do you know that's the most beautiful music I've ever heard in my life I should say I'll come in and sit down and she pulled out a chair and I sat down on it glad to sit down and you know the house was poor there was no rugs on the floor of any Ty a tablecloth red checkered tablecloth on the table and little old sto over there in the corner and there was a fire in it and that woman put some uh uh milk in a pan and heat it and brought it over to me and you know I'm hungry I don't have any manners I forgot how to act I forgot a lot of things in 22 years and I grabbed that glass of milk on before she ever set it down and I gobbled it down I'm so hungry I felt like I'm going St mad and I took it instantly and the moment it touched my stomach of course I couldn't retain it I lost it I haven't had any whole milk in 22 years you could understand why I couldn't take it and she knew why to do she went out in the kitchen she heated some water or rather over to the stove and heated some water and left her heart she put the sugar in that water and brought it over to me and she sat down and gave it to me from a spoon I took every bit of it oh it was good it was nourishing and then the daddy walked over by me and he said now tell us who you are and where'd you come from I began to cry I was scared then I said I run away from the convent and I'm not going back and I he said what happened to you and my hand was laying up the table and I said well I tried to get over the gate and I fail and I'm hurt and you know he said we'll have to call a doctor and bless your sweet life then I really became hysterical I got up from the table I was going to run back outside and they wouldn't let me he said wait a minute we're not going to hurt you you hurt you have to have help I said I don't have any money and I don't have any people and I can't pay a doctor bill course I was just I was just in a terrible mess if you want to know it and that man said said to me I'm going after a doctor he said and he's not a Roman Catholic neither am I that dear man didn't have a car and he start a h and bugging he drove nine miles to get a doctor the doctor came out in his car and when he got out to the place he got there ahead of the man and when the doctor walked in and walked around me he just kept walk around me and he was swearing maybe he didn't realize was a terrible effect on me when he stopped and looked at me of course he was mad he was mad why was he mad he was mad because he was looking at something was supposed to be a human being and I didn't even look like a human being being I was in such a horrible condition but finally he calmed down he came over to me and he said I'll have to take you to the hospital tonight oh I became hysterical I said I don't want to go please don't make me go and then he sat down carefully and took my hands and he began to say I'm not going to hurt you you have to have help and I want to help you that doctor took me into the hospital that night and that's where I learned how much a weigh he weighed me and I weighed exactly 89 lb I weigh 178 right now and then you know they took me into surgery and of course they tried to get the swelling and the inflammation out of my hand and arm that they might do something for me it took about 12 13 days and then of course they had it but this time it started to knit and they had all to break over it again and put it in a cast I did a lot of suffering well you know one day that a way was made for me to be released from the hospital who did they release me to I begged to go out to those old people to stay with and they let me go because they' been good to me and I trusted them and the doctor wanted to take me out to his home I was in that hospital 3 and a half months and they took me out there and I stayed for a period of time and then one day the same doctor he wrote a letter and you know what he sent in that letter uh letter he sent a m a check he told the people to go and buy me a suitcase and get me some clothing he was coming for me on a certain day he had told me I'm going to find your people for me you know that doctor's a stranger to me but oh I thank God that he has men and women across this world and those men and women are not so selfish that they want use some of the money that God has allowed them to have have uh to help that one that's less fortunate than the day he he spent a lot of money on me I was in the hospital three and a half months and I mean that there was a lot of money spent on me but he paid the bills I appreciate it and you know that dear doctor oh they took me bought my clothing for me got my suitcase and everything was ready and the day came when he come and you know that doctor took me to the train and he put me on a train in care of somebody of course he had found my people for me I was on buses and trains and boats for a long time and one day oh after there he had gotten my Visa to get back into the United States and I was always in charge of somebody because they wouldn't trust me to travel alone because of having lived under the ground so long and one day they called the name of the town where I was or where my Mother and Daddy lived don't you know I knew where Mother and Daddy lived and I got off of that train and run down to their home five blocks in that Depot just a very small town and when I rang the bell my daddy come to the door and you know I I looked at his face I didn't know him and I because I didn't know him I said do you know where my father lives and he said who are you and what's your name and I said my name and I didn't give him my church name I gave him my family name and that man looked at me and of course it was his name and he said hookie is this you my father didn't know me of course it was my dad now dear old man opened the door then and invited me in and I said dad is Mother alive because I didn't know about her and he took me back in to see her and there she was 7 and a half years she' laid there an invilet a horrible horrible envolent and of course she didn't know me and I didn't know her well didn't know that very night I took violently sick and they put me back in another hospital for another three months but my father paid all of those bills he reimbursed the doctor and paid the doctor in another country and paid the old people he reimbursed them all all of that was wonderful then you know one day after my body was strong enough since I'm here in the United States or it took a long time several years I'm a nurse and I took the examination to nurse and you know what God did he let a woman come into that particular hospital it was a Roman Catholic Hospital this woman was a Church of God Minister she came in and I thought how strange just across the Mississippi River is two magnificent Protestant hospitals and she lives in one of those cities right there three cities joined together and why in the world did should come over here to this Roman Catholic Hospital why I believe God had his hand on it all the time you know that woman who came in and the doctor said I want you topat their case and I went into that room to prepare that woman for the operating table and I heard her praying and I want you to know I became that woman's a private nurse her special nurse after she left the hospital she went home and I became her special nurse in the home and that woman to ask me if I wouldn't go to church with her and you know I lived in her home long enough to hear her pray I lived in that home long enough to read the Bible to her because I am her nurse and I did what she told me to I'd never read a Bible before in all of my life and she'd have to find this scriptures and then I read them to her and you know as I read the word of God God began to get a hold of me and finally she said won't you go to church with me and you know I went to church with that woman and I sat back there and heard a gospel for the first time in my life and you know I tell you I went through four nights and it was really beautiful I've never heard anything like this and all the time she was telling me about the Plan of Salvation telling me about God and that I needed God and I needed to be saved and of course I I was believing her do you know what I do every night I'd go home from church with that woman I'd say you go to bed but let go to the basement I'd lay my Bible down on a chair and there I challenge God and I'd say God did you hear what the preacher said did you hear it God and then I would tell God everything that I could remember the preacher said I said God you heard every word didn't you now if you're God and the Bible is the word of God and God you're real I want what those people have but if you're not God and the word of God is Not Your word then God please don't give to me what those people have let me tell you I challenge God I put him to a test God's not going to give you anything that's not of God don't you worry and every night I continued to do that four or five nights and I didn't eat it either I couldn't sleep and I'd lost my appetite and I was losing a lot of weight it was terrific but you know one night I come back to church and out of a clear blue sky right in the middle of that man's service I just got out of my seat and with both hands up in the air I come running right straight down an aisle like that and I fell into that Al and I cried out my God forgive me for all my sins I was a sinner I mean God met me there praise His Wonderful Name there was a pool of water on that floor I was sorry for everything that I did in the convent I stole potato peelings I stole bread I told lies I called the Mother Superior names under my breath and I want you to know God met me down there and he forgave me of every sin there was in my life and how I thank and praise him for it praise His Wonderful Name God's been very good to me very good to me few nights previous to that I went back to church God filled me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost may I say to you God means more to me than all the material wealth you have in this city I'd rather have Jesus than anything you might have because I found him to be the best friend I've ever known I can tell him anything I want to tell him and he won't call you up and tell you what I told him I can sit at his feet and tell him every day of my life Jesus I love you Jesus I love you and every secret to my heart I can pour off to him and I don't worry about him calling you up and telling you what I told him he's the best friend you ever had he's able to save you he's able to deliver you he's able to loose you from the things of this world set you free to know him praise His name I have a wonderful God I love him supremely I'd rather have Jesus than anything that you might have God is real in my life it's really wonderful how God delivered me out of the confid pray for me I need much prayer I'll be going places where it's predominantly Roman Catholic I'll have to suffer much but I'm willing to suffer for Jesus that I might tell someone about him and give my testimonies that other dear little n girls might be spared from Convent so pray for me won't you God bless you well what do you think I told you at the beginning it would be a very very gripping T you'll recall that we
