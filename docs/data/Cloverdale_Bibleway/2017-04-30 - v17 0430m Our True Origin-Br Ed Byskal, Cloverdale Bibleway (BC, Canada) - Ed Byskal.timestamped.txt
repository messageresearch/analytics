[0:44] not get heavy

[7:34] Want to remember a qu a request from
[7:36] Susie Yang. Says her husband's company
[7:40] has a young man. He has a
[7:43] a broken vertebrae and he's in a coma
[7:46] now and asked that we could pray the
[7:48] Lord would bring him out of it. So I
[7:50] believe that we can remember that
[7:51] request this morning. If you have a need
[7:52] upon your heart as we go to prayer.
[7:55] Amen. Love the Lord this morning with
[7:57] all of our hearts. Want to remember our
[7:59] pastor. He's going to be coming and
[8:01] speaking this morning. Just ask that the
[8:03] Lord would allow him to deliver the word
[8:06] to us this morning. Let's bow our hearts
[8:07] and heads together. Heavenly Father, we
[8:09] approach the throne of grace this
[8:11] morning with a boldness, Lord, knowing
[8:13] that we are the called, the chosen, the
[8:16] blood purchased of God this morning, the
[8:18] redeemed, the bride of Jesus Christ,
[8:21] Lord, that has awoken from every nation
[8:24] represented here this morning, Lord.
[8:26] Just desiring to lift our voices in
[8:28] worship to you. Lift our hands in
[8:30] surrender, Lord, saying, "Have your
[8:32] will. Not our will, but thine be done."
[8:35] This morning we want to remember this
[8:37] need this morning from Sister Susie.
[8:40] Lord, for this one who's got a broken
[8:42] vertebrae and in a coma. Lord, there's
[8:45] nothing to you whether it be a coma,
[8:47] whether it be dead in a tomb four days,
[8:49] Lord, but if you would speak the word,
[8:52] &gt;&gt; life would come forth back into that
[8:54] mortal body, oh God. Lord, may it be so
[8:56] spiritually this morning. if there would
[8:58] be one dead among us. Lord, though many
[9:01] days had passed since life would maybe
[9:04] be seen in that body, but Lord, would
[9:05] you speak the word this morning,
[9:08] &gt;&gt; may life be quickened, oh God. May that
[9:10] seed germ down deep on the inside, Lord,
[9:14] be kindled.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; May life come forth this morning, Lord,
[9:18] for those that have been along the way
[9:20] for many years, Lord. Would you feed the
[9:23] sheep, Lord?
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Feed the lambs, Lord. Lord, as a body,
[9:28] we want to stand together. Give our all
[9:31] to you this morning that you would be
[9:33] high and lifted up in the praises of
[9:35] your people.
[9:37] Use our pastor this morning, Lord. How
[9:39] we so appreciate the gift of God that
[9:42] you have placed among us.

[9:47] &gt;&gt; Give him the very mind of Christ to
[9:49] deliver to your people. Our souls are
[9:52] hungering and thirsting after God this
[9:54] morning. Lord, there's a cry in the
[9:56] heart of your people for more of you. We
[9:59] say, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus.

[10:04] have gathered. Lord,
[10:07] we ask that you would bless the
[10:09] offering. Lord, bless the giver, oh God.
[10:13] Lord, may there be some that would only
[10:15] be able to give little, but may you
[10:17] bless it abundantly, oh God. We pray,
[10:20] knowing that that is exactly how you've
[10:21] done it before, and you will do the same

[29:27] songs and the chorus we've just been
[29:29] singing. Why don't we just bow our heads
[29:31] once again in prayer?
[29:35] Dear heavenly father,
[29:38] we are your children.
[29:40] We've gathered here to be around your
[29:43] table.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; We pray, oh God, that we will be so fed,
[29:50] so fulfilled,
[29:53] so satisfied. I pray that your Holy
[29:56] Spirit will come, Lord, hover over and
[29:59] brood over this congregation
[30:02] and all those that are streaming in
[30:04] whatever land they may be. I pray, oh
[30:06] God, you'll hover over them. Take a
[30:09] phrase, just take some words, whatever
[30:12] you would choose, oh God, bring them
[30:15] into the atmosphere. Bring all that
[30:18] standing here into the atmosphere. Lord,
[30:21] think of the mothers in the mother's
[30:23] room and those that are in the uh
[30:27] upstairs in the translation rooms and
[30:30] wherever. We pray, oh God, you'll bless
[30:33] them, captivate their minds, Father, in
[30:36] the name of Jesus Christ, we just
[30:39] surrender ourselves to you to do what
[30:42] you would uh be pleased to do.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; May the kingdom of God be benefited
[30:49] today. I pray let your children oh God
[30:53] be strengthened I pray and filled with
[30:56] faith in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people said
[31:04] &gt;&gt; amen. God bless you. I'll let you have
[31:07] your seats for a few moments.
[31:13] The other day I was uh awakened
[31:16] fairly early and and there was just uh
[31:20] the subject I'm going to speak to you
[31:22] about in a few moments Lord willing
[31:26] uh was coming within a few moments and I
[31:30] I actually was studying on a different
[31:33] line. I was studying on worship. So you
[31:36] can understand why the songs today are
[31:40] having to do with the awesome presence
[31:43] of God and uh that we stand and I was
[31:47] singing that song. I stand in awe in the
[31:50] presence of the Lord.
[31:53] And because I had experienced some of
[31:55] these things, I thought I've always
[31:57] desired I might be able to convey it to
[32:01] the people.
[32:03] uh but I felt that uh my thoughts in the
[32:07] night were just uh rotating over portion
[32:12] of scripture which we're going to read
[32:14] in a few moments and it just took on a
[32:18] whole new
[32:21] uh whole new meaning a whole new
[32:22] perspective and so I want to convey that
[32:25] to you the Lord willing because I
[32:28] believe it's the Holy Spirit speaking to
[32:30] us and those young people, brother
[32:33] Matthew, that we had here in the uh on
[32:35] Thursday evening, plus the others that
[32:38] were maybe studying the fourth chapter
[32:41] of John. Uh I've thought very very much
[32:45] upon the woman at the well because that
[32:49] is a scripture and I looked for the
[32:52] place I believe that brother Brandham
[32:54] even said that the that the angel of God
[32:57] had referred him to some of these
[33:00] scriptures and uh I believe it's when
[33:03] he's being interviewed by the Cobb
[33:05] brothers but uh anyway he used that
[33:09] scripture so many many many times And
[33:12] I'm we're going to read it today and I
[33:15] believe you'll understand it
[33:19] &gt;&gt; more than understand it. I'm praying
[33:21] that God will and you pray today while
[33:26] you're sitting here. You just pray and
[33:28] say, "Lord, cause this service to be
[33:32] more than a Sunday morning service for
[33:34] me. Just cause it. Speak to me
[33:38] personally.
[33:40] I think I desire that very very much.
[33:43] And for you young people that have the
[33:46] future laying before you, if we have a
[33:49] future, and we certainly don't know
[33:51] about that,
[33:53] things could change very dramatically
[33:56] &gt;&gt; between now and next Sunday. That's
[33:58] &gt;&gt; right.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; It's just that
[34:01] critical at this moment. and we're here
[34:05] and we hear the ministers
[34:07] speak about the change of our body and
[34:10] the rapture and we believe that we've
[34:12] received a rapture call message.
[34:16] Um
[34:18] you all here including myself we're
[34:21] going to meet the one of whom I wish to
[34:25] speak about tonight or this morning
[34:27] which is Jesus Christ. You're going to
[34:30] meet him. Everything here,
[34:33] everything here you're attached to by
[34:35] the senses of this body are going to
[34:38] fade away
[34:40] &gt;&gt; because these senses the prophet said
[34:42] were given to you to contact this world.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; But where I want to turn your focus to
[34:47] another world
[34:49] &gt;&gt; which is right one breath away from you.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is important, I would be
[34:57] uh reticent of my responsibility
[35:01] if I did not do everything that I could
[35:05] with God's help to prepare you for that
[35:09] place.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; There's another world
[35:12] &gt;&gt; and this world means nothing in that
[35:14] world.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's Eden
[35:18] &gt;&gt; and that is why you struggle.
[35:21] That is why you have battles.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; But there's a place that I'm speaking of
[35:27] where you will not have another
[35:29] temptation
[35:31] &gt;&gt; because there will be no one there to
[35:33] tempt you.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; There will be no criminals.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; There will be no lawlessness.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; There will be no uncleanness.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; There will be none of those things
[35:44] &gt;&gt; because it'll be just holiness,
[35:47] &gt;&gt; righteousness, and the thing that you
[35:49] crave for. That's where we're headed.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; So, I desire that u the words are spoken
[35:57] this morning because the message has
[36:01] come to reveal Jesus Christ. And if he's
[36:05] revealed it, I guarantee it's for those
[36:09] of you that are gathered here in this
[36:12] sanctuary. And those of you that are
[36:14] gathered around the word, perhaps in
[36:16] your homes or wherever you are, whatever
[36:19] country you are, I just pray that the
[36:22] same atmosphere will come and how I
[36:25] desire that you will have the
[36:28] experience.
[36:30] Now, if you would like to stand and then
[36:33] we're going to read
[36:35] going to read from John the 4th chapter.
[36:39] We're starting with verse three and
[36:42] we'll go down to verse 29. That's a
[36:45] rather long reading, but it'll be
[36:47] necessary for the rest of the service.
[37:00] Starting with verse three, he left Judea
[37:03] and departed again into Galilee
[37:07] and he must need go through Samaria.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; I'm emphasizing that
[37:15] who is it? Well, you said Jesus, but
[37:19] who is he
[37:21] that must needs go through Samaria?
[37:26] Then cometh he to a to a city of
[37:29] Samaria, which is called Saikar,
[37:32] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[37:35] gave to his son Joseph.
[37:38] Incidentally, it was Joseph's
[37:41] through his lineage and children that
[37:44] the Samaritans came and that is why
[37:49] uh they were kind of considered
[37:53] not pure Jews as such.
[37:57] Joseph, you remember, took a gentile
[37:59] wife
[38:01] &gt;&gt; and these were Samaritans and the
[38:03] Samaritans were hated by the Jews.
[38:08] I want to speak to you on our true
[38:10] origin.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; He said, 'Well, I was born in the United
[38:18] States and I'm Irish.
[38:22] Brother Brandham was Irish.
[38:24] But he discovered and he said that that
[38:27] was not his true origin either.
[38:29] Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; And I don't I don't care where the where
[38:33] you were born or what hospital or what
[38:35] city or what place or what race.
[38:39] It has absolutely nothing to do with the
[38:41] origin I'm speaking of this morning.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; So if you want to find where your roots
[38:47] are, we'll go a lot further into it
[38:50] today.
[38:54] Verse six. Now Jacob's well was there.
[38:57] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[39:00] journey, sat thus on the well, and it
[39:04] was about the sixth hour. There cometh a
[39:07] woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus
[39:10] sth unto her, "Give me to drink." For
[39:14] his disciples were gone away into the
[39:16] city, unto the city to buy meat. Then
[39:20] said the woman of Samaria unto him, How
[39:24] is it that thou being a Jew askest,
[39:28] Drink of me, which am a Samar a woman of
[39:31] Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings
[39:35] with the Samaritans.
[39:37] Jesus answered and said unto her, If
[39:40] thou kneest the gift of God, I heard
[39:43] brother Derek speak about that.
[39:46] and who it is that saith to thee, give
[39:51] me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of
[39:53] him, and he would have he would have
[39:56] given thee living water." The woman sth
[39:59] unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw
[40:03] with, and the well is deep, from whence
[40:06] then hast thou that living water? Art
[40:10] thou greater than our father Jacob,
[40:12] which gave us the well, and drank
[40:15] thereof himself, and his children, and
[40:18] his cattle? Jesus answered and said unto
[40:21] her,
[40:22] "If thou, uh, whosoever drinkketh this
[40:26] water shall thirst again, but whosoever
[40:29] drinkketh of the water that I shall give
[40:31] him shall never thirst, but the water
[40:34] that I shall give him shall be in him a
[40:37] well of water springing up into unto
[40:41] eternal life." The woman sth unto him,
[40:44] "Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
[40:47] not, neither uh neither come hither to
[40:51] draw." Jesus sth unto unto her, "Go call
[40:55] thy husband, and come hither." The woman
[40:59] answered and said, and said, I have no
[41:02] husband. Jesus sith unto her, Thou hast
[41:05] well said, I have no husband. For thou
[41:08] hast had five husbands, and he whom thou
[41:13] hast is not thy husband. In that said
[41:18] thou truly. The woman sth unto him, Sir,
[41:22] I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our
[41:25] fathers worshiped in this mountain.
[41:28] Notice how the subject turned to worship
[41:30] immediately. Our fathers worshiped in
[41:33] this mountain and you say that in
[41:35] Jerusalem is the place where men ought
[41:38] to worship. Jesus sth unto her, woman,
[41:43] believeth, believe me, the hour cometh
[41:46] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[41:49] nor in Jerusalem worship the father.
[41:53] Ye worship, you know not what
[41:57] uh we know what we worship, for
[41:59] salvation is of the Jews. But the hour
[42:03] cometh, and now is when the true
[42:06] worshippers
[42:08] shall worship the Father in spirit and
[42:11] in truth, and the Father seeketh such to
[42:14] worship him. God is a spirit, and they
[42:17] that worship him must worship him in
[42:19] spirit and truth. The woman sth unto
[42:21] him, I know that Messiah's cometh, which
[42:24] is called Christ, when he come, when he
[42:28] is come, he will tell us all things.
[42:32] Jesus sth unto her, I that speak unto
[42:36] thee am he.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; And upon this his disciples
[42:41] uh his uh came his disciples and
[42:44] marveled that he talked with the woman.
[42:46] Yet no man said, "What seekest thou? Or
[42:50] why talkest thou with her?" The woman
[42:53] then left her water pot, and went her
[42:56] way into the city, and said unto the
[42:59] man, "Come see a man which told me all
[43:02] things that I that ever I did. Is not
[43:06] this the Christ?"
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[43:16] The subject which we've just read, the
[43:19] verses we've just read involve
[43:24] not only woman of Samaria with Jesus but
[43:26] involve the following things. I would
[43:29] just want to take it over eight points.
[43:32] A very ordinary conversation.
[43:37] You're here in the service this morning
[43:39] and you perhaps wouldn't speak wouldn't
[43:42] think it. Well, we we didn't come here
[43:44] to have an or ordinary conversation, but
[43:47] what I'm speaking to you today may
[43:50] involve tomorrow morning, may involve
[43:52] this coming week. I just pray that
[43:56] someday
[43:58] at some point in time that this may be a
[44:01] preparation for you or it may even be
[44:04] this morning. I'm more interested in the
[44:06] atmosphere
[44:08] &gt;&gt; that you are brought into than I am in
[44:11] the knowledge. Faith does not come by
[44:15] the mind and by the mouth.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[44:22] the word of God. Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; So every uh the very or the very
[44:28] ordinary a very ordinary conversation
[44:31] about a drink of water that led into the
[44:36] sign of the Messiah.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Go call thy husband and come hither.
[44:42] Revealing the secret of her heart. This
[44:45] is where I'm going to be going.
[44:49] her recognizing that Jesus was a
[44:53] prophet.
[44:54] Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
[44:57] Number five, her first question was
[45:01] concerning worship.
[45:03] Verse 20, in this mountain or in
[45:06] Jerusalem.
[45:09] She acknowledged that when the Messiah
[45:12] comes, he will tell us all things.
[45:15] Number seven, Jesus, the same one that
[45:20] said, "Give me to drink," is the same
[45:23] one who said, "I am he that speaketh
[45:26] with thee." The same mouth, same voice,
[45:30] same character to the voice when he
[45:33] said, "Give me to drink." She wasn't
[45:36] startled with that. She said, you know,
[45:39] how is it that you a Jew have, you know,
[45:42] speak to me a Samar, a woman of Samaria?
[45:45] That was just ordinary conversation.
[45:49] But that's the same mouth that a few
[45:51] moments later said, I'm he
[45:54] that speaketh with thee.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; And at that, the Bible says she quickly
[46:00] recognized and acknowledged
[46:03] that he was the Christ
[46:06] was the Messiah. She dropped her water
[46:09] pot and went into the city.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; I've experienced something like this
[46:14] woman.
[46:17] I experienced
[46:19] which I won't bother going into detail,
[46:22] but I I've experienced that presence of
[46:26] the angel of the Lord. And I'll just
[46:28] tell you something. You're very
[46:30] fortunate to feel that you can even
[46:32] breathe after
[46:35] because the songs today
[46:39] were divinely led
[46:42] about being awe
[46:44] a struck. I stand in presence. I stand
[46:48] in awe at the presence of God. And I can
[46:51] tell you friends, I don't care who you
[46:53] are. I don't care what background or
[46:56] what country or what nation you come
[46:58] from.
[46:59] But when the presence of God draws near
[47:03] to you,
[47:05] you can't be any different than the
[47:06] prophet who said it's like 10,000 volts
[47:10] going through a thin wire.
[47:12] There's something about God. There's
[47:14] something about his holiness.
[47:17] There's something about his
[47:19] uh
[47:22] Yes. about his holiness and the purity
[47:25] and the power of God that leaves us to
[47:29] reduces us to helplessness
[47:31] &gt;&gt; as it were and yet he loves to have
[47:34] contact with us.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; The recognition of God's gift in Christ
[47:43] by a seed child of God is true worship.
[47:47] I want to connect those two together.
[47:50] We can raise our hands. We can clap. And
[47:53] I think all of that is perfectly fine.
[47:55] We can shout. We can dance. We can have
[47:59] all kinds of expressions.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; But I want to enlarge on that a wee bit.
[48:06] And I have about three or four slides
[48:10] I'd like to show you.
[48:13] So, if we could dim the lights, please.
[48:17] Philippians 2:5-7
[48:20] says, "Let this mind be in you which was
[48:24] also in Christ Jesus,
[48:27] who being," and I've got that underlined
[48:30] because I'm going to just come to that
[48:31] now. who being in the form, and that's
[48:35] not the shape of God, who being in the
[48:38] form of God, and I'll deal with that
[48:41] just a moment, thought it not robbery to
[48:44] be equal with God, but made himself of
[48:47] no reputation, and took upon him the
[48:49] form of a servant, and was made in the
[48:53] likeness of men. So it's not the shape
[48:57] of a servant but the form of a servant
[48:59] is his activity his action and was made
[49:03] in the likeness of of man
[49:06] out of who is this Melzdc
[49:10] also we see him revealed here in Ruth
[49:13] and Boaz as a kinsman redeemer
[49:17] how he had come
[49:20] how he had to come to be flesh Right
[49:26] &gt;&gt; now we see the attribute sons of his
[49:29] spirit and that's what we have here in
[49:33] this building today.
[49:36] The sons
[49:38] now we see the attribute
[49:42] uh sons of his spirit.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; God attributes to them righteousness.
[49:47] Right
[49:49] &gt;&gt; now, I'm I'm just we're we're coming
[49:51] into a real situation here. We're coming
[49:54] to a man who's of another race or looked
[49:58] upon as another race to a woman of
[50:02] Samaria of another race. Uh they were
[50:05] even thought of as just dogs. They were
[50:08] not thought highly of at all. So I I I I
[50:12] I really care not
[50:15] h how little esteem a person has of
[50:19] themselves or how much esteem they have
[50:21] of themselves. We are really nothing. We
[50:25] are nothing. Uh and we have nothing
[50:27] really to offer. Uh this almighty God
[50:31] that brother Tom spoke about a couple of
[50:33] Sundays ago. uh this almighty God.
[50:38] Uh there's such a holiness with him I
[50:42] desire. You might feel like a stick of
[50:45] wood. That's fine. But this woman now is
[50:48] has come and she's had five husbands.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; And the one she's with right now is not
[50:56] her husband.
[50:58] And you would not I'm very very
[51:02] exercised. You would not be proud to
[51:05] have her as a neighbor,
[51:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:10] &gt;&gt; And she probably would not be welcome in
[51:13] a lot of churches in the message.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And yet we have one who must needs
[51:22] &gt;&gt; go to Samaria
[51:26] &gt;&gt; because she was a seed. Her origin was
[51:30] not just a Samaritan. She was a seed out
[51:34] of the thought of God.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; And this one who must go to her, the
[51:40] prophet said was he he doesn't say it in
[51:43] my words, but I going to go into the
[51:46] scripture and into the message with you.
[51:49] He he speaks of Melzdc
[51:52] who who actually is God. I better I
[51:55] better just give it to you. Now uh
[52:00] now the difference between him and you
[52:04] as a son. He was the beginning the word.
[52:09] He was at the beginning the word anorphy
[52:13] body.
[52:15] He came in and lived in that in that
[52:19] morphy body. He came and lived in that
[52:23] in the person of MelzDC.
[52:27] Then later we never heard no more of
[52:30] Melzdc because he became Jesus Christ.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Melzdc came and visited Abraham
[52:39] &gt;&gt; and gave Abraham a promise
[52:41] &gt;&gt; to you and your seed.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Now he had a literal seed, a natural
[52:48] seed which became the Jews. But he had a
[52:52] faith seed
[52:53] &gt;&gt; because he believed God.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; And because he believed God, God
[52:59] attributed
[53:01] &gt;&gt; attributed to him his righteousness.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Said, "I you are my friend. You're my
[53:08] friend." Yeah. Even though Abraham was
[53:11] born like every other man, like every
[53:14] other sinner, you were born a sinner. So
[53:18] don't talk to me about where you came
[53:20] from or what your roots are if your
[53:23] roots aren't back in heaven.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; You don't have any roots worth talking
[53:28] about.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And this w woman's roots were in heaven.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And that is why he must go through
[53:36] Samaria.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; He must find this seed of Abraham.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; He must find this seed of God. Because
[53:44] now MelzDC is the same one that became
[53:48] Jesus Christ.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus must go as the high priest.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; And Melzdc showed himself to Abraham as
[53:58] the high priest of God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And uh is that not right?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; He showed himself as the high priest.
[54:04] That's what Paul speaks about. And now
[54:07] the high priest, I must go to Samaria. I
[54:12] must find this woman. He not He's not
[54:15] interested how many husbands she's had
[54:17] or or what her life has been like. He
[54:20] must redeem her
[54:23] &gt;&gt; because he is the redeemer.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you friends, there's
[54:27] nobody here that can boast about their
[54:29] life. Don't care how clean it is or how
[54:32] dirty it is. There's no one that can
[54:34] boast about their life. We've been born
[54:37] in sin and shaped in iniquities. And the
[54:41] prophet of God said, "Your parents were
[54:43] condemned. Your grandparents were
[54:46] condemned. Your forefathers were
[54:49] condemned. What can we boast about?
[54:51] They're all condemned. And we were born
[54:54] condemned. But thank God we had one who
[54:58] came and revealed himself as the high
[55:00] priest." The high priest, Melzdc, the
[55:04] high priest came in the form of Jesus
[55:07] Christ. And Jesus Christ took the body
[55:11] sacrificed to Goltha and gave himself as
[55:16] a sacrifice so that you could become
[55:18] something.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; And later we never heard no more
[55:27] because he became Jesus Christ.
[55:32] Jesus was, now this is some of it's out
[55:35] of Strong's concordance.
[55:39] Jesus was in the form, this is not a
[55:42] quote, Jesus was in the form, that's
[55:46] morphe of God.
[55:49] Form is not the shape.
[55:52] Form is the essence.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Now just watch it, please. The word
[55:57] being, the word being because the
[56:00] scripture, the scripture which we had
[56:02] just read earlier said
[56:06] who being
[56:08] in the form of God,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; who being in the form of God, now this
[56:14] service is one where I want you to think
[56:17] real deep. who being in the form of God
[56:22] indicates a condition
[56:25] that began in the past and continues
[56:28] into the present. That's why a he can
[56:31] say he's the same yesterday, today and
[56:34] forever
[56:36] &gt;&gt; because he has it's the condition who
[56:38] being in the form of God that is the
[56:42] condition. He's the same yesterday,
[56:45] today and forever. who being in the form
[56:49] of God a indicates a condition that
[56:53] began in the past and continues into the
[56:56] present. Therefore, while on earth, the
[56:59] outward expression of his innermost
[57:02] being was the expression of the divine
[57:05] essence deity. Paul means that when the
[57:09] one who became Jesus the word came to
[57:13] earth to assume the form of a man, he
[57:17] did not cease being God.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; He was God.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Being God, he became a man. That God was
[57:28] in Christ reconciling the world to
[57:30] himself. He did not cease being God.
[57:33] Strong Gordon's in on regarding the word
[57:37] morphe properly form or outward
[57:41] expression that embodies essential inner
[57:45] substance so that the form is in
[57:48] complete harmony with the inner. Your
[57:52] form friends, your form has nothing to
[57:55] do with where you were born or what race
[57:59] you came from. Your form is that you
[58:02] have uh you have you're the outward
[58:05] expression.
[58:07] You are the outward expression and the
[58:10] outward expression should be in harmony
[58:12] with the inner essence. You hunger after
[58:15] God. You thirst after God. You desire
[58:19] God. Let your outward expression be sub
[58:22] in submission to that.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Can I hear amen? Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And so it is so
[58:32] that the outward
[58:36] form were all different forms and
[58:38] shapes. That has nothing to do with it.
[58:42] Nothing to do with it.
[58:45] I'm just waiting.
[58:47] It's the essence. You're simply a vessel
[58:52] for the essence of deity.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; friends. I've come here for another
[58:58] purpose this morning. I know brother Tom
[59:01] was announced even to speak, but I I I I
[59:04] actually sat in the middle of the night
[59:07] for about 3 hours and just wrote because
[59:10] this was so quickened to me
[59:14] and I I want to convey it to you. If
[59:18] there's anything in life that you
[59:20] desire,
[59:21] you should just ponder this. You should
[59:24] ponder and think about this Christ. How
[59:28] in the Old Testament
[59:30] even God, this God came as the high
[59:34] priest Melchzdc without beginning of
[59:37] days nor ending of life. And I'll be
[59:40] quoting some of that without beginning
[59:42] of days nor ending ending of life. And
[59:45] somehow your father Abraham, father in
[59:48] the faith, was so affected, he just
[59:51] wanted to give him tithes of a tenth of
[59:54] all that he had. It material things
[59:57] didn't mean anything to him. But he he
[1:00:00] had just won a great victory.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham had just gone and slaughtered a
[1:00:05] bunch of kings.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It didn't have that has nothing to do
[1:00:09] with God. I mean, I'm not going to
[1:00:12] belittle the slaughter of the kings, but
[1:00:14] if there were wicked kings and this
[1:00:17] world is filled with violence and wicked
[1:00:20] people and and the prophet of God calls
[1:00:23] those who are not elected a fodder,
[1:00:26] atomic fodder. And a lot of believers
[1:00:29] don't want to say that because they
[1:00:30] think it's too rough. But that's exactly
[1:00:33] the truth. That's exactly what it is.
[1:00:36] And you can say believers that uh and
[1:00:39] you as a congregation of believers shall
[1:00:42] not in Jesus' name shall not be affected
[1:00:46] by these naysayers or unbelievers. What
[1:00:50] what does an unbeliever have? Doesn't
[1:00:52] even have a teaspoon of ashes up there
[1:00:54] in their brain. And they're going to
[1:00:56] figure out God. And they're going to
[1:00:58] tell about how a prophet How can you
[1:01:01] tell about a prophet when you you cannot
[1:01:03] even tell how how God can be without
[1:01:06] beginning and without end.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Figure that one out.
[1:01:12] and you that were here at the little
[1:01:14] gathering we had the other night. Uh the
[1:01:19] team, Brother Matthew Redell's team,
[1:01:25] you'll understand a little more about
[1:01:27] that.
[1:01:29] Listen friends, I may not be preaching
[1:01:32] too many more times. I don't know. But
[1:01:35] one thing is certain. You are going to
[1:01:38] go the same direction. We all are going
[1:01:41] to live this life for a very short time.
[1:01:44] And then you're going to go where this
[1:01:47] being that I'm speaking about is. And
[1:01:49] you want to receive him on good terms.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:00] the outward expression of an inner
[1:02:03] essence.
[1:02:06] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:02:08] to himself. That of second Corinthians.
[1:02:11] God was in Christ.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your con concept or or
[1:02:17] thought of God is, but God was in
[1:02:20] Christ.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; He had to be made known. This God was in
[1:02:24] Christ when he must needs go through
[1:02:27] Samaria. This God was in Christ when he
[1:02:30] sat wearied on the well. This God was in
[1:02:33] Christ talking to a woman who was living
[1:02:36] with another man.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; But there was a seed buried there
[1:02:43] beneath all of that garbage and beneath
[1:02:46] all of that filth that she'd been living
[1:02:48] in and trying in life and hardship. one
[1:02:52] husband, two husbands, three husbands,
[1:02:54] four husbands, five husbands. Didn't
[1:02:56] work.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; So, she's with her sixth man.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; But there's a seed there.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And that seed is all valuable.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; That seed is not going to become
[1:03:11] subjected to Satan's
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Satan's
[1:03:16] all his uh devices.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And I'll just throw something else out
[1:03:20] to her.
[1:03:22] that that's not that's not in the books
[1:03:24] for a seed of God.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; When God said, "I'm going to redeem you
[1:03:28] and your seed,"
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; that's what he's going to do.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said,
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; And you hear the services and some of
[1:03:40] the men in the services and brother Tom
[1:03:43] was preaching. I believe in the last
[1:03:44] service and have heard brother John some
[1:03:47] of these brothers preaching and
[1:03:48] preaching about families and so on and
[1:03:50] so forth. We do not know how. We do not
[1:03:54] know when. But one thing is absolutely
[1:03:57] certain. God is going to redeem every
[1:04:00] one of his seed.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Every one of his seed. And you need to
[1:04:06] hear that. You need to confess that. And
[1:04:09] you need to believe that.
[1:04:12] Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Seeing then that we have a great high
[1:04:25] priest. Who has it? We have a great high
[1:04:30] priest.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say that with me. We
[1:04:35] have a great high priest
[1:04:39] that is passed into the heavens, Jesus
[1:04:42] the son of God. Let us hold fast our
[1:04:46] profession. This great high priest must
[1:04:49] needs go through Samaria.
[1:04:52] Now to Abraham and his seed, where the
[1:04:56] promises made, he seth not, and to seeds
[1:05:00] as of many, but as of one, and to thy
[1:05:03] seed, which is Christ. This woman,
[1:05:06] believe it or not, she was part of him.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And he had come to redeem her.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; He was fulfilling the function of a
[1:05:14] priest.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was going to die for her.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And redeem her. and she was going to
[1:05:23] become a part of him,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; a part of the body of Christ. We do not
[1:05:27] know how. I don't know how it all
[1:05:30] happens, but that's what was going to
[1:05:32] happen. And he came to redeem her.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that wonderful, friends? Isn't
[1:05:37] that wonderful? Doesn't this glorify
[1:05:40] him?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:58] Now to Abraham and his seed were the
[1:06:00] promises made. I only repeat that to
[1:06:03] bring you back to it in the in the
[1:06:06] message Melzdc the great prince and king
[1:06:11] in 1955. And I'm saying it that way. You
[1:06:14] just listen now. You talk about prophet.
[1:06:17] I pray he said that God
[1:06:21] I pray God that every sick person in
[1:06:24] here that their faith will be sufficient
[1:06:28] this morning now to remember that
[1:06:32] Melchisedc.
[1:06:34] What he's praying is I pray that their
[1:06:37] faith will be sufficient to remember.
[1:06:41] I pray that your faith this morning in
[1:06:45] in 2017 shall be sufficient to remember
[1:06:50] the great high priest because that was
[1:06:53] that was almighty God that came down as
[1:06:56] a great high priest on his way on his
[1:06:59] journey and he would become Jesus Christ
[1:07:03] and uh take on a body of flesh and take
[1:07:06] that flesh as a sacrifice to Calvary.
[1:07:10] Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; This is an incredible journey. You talk
[1:07:13] about an incredible journey. It hasn't
[1:07:15] got anything to do with cats and dogs.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; It has to do with someone who came from
[1:07:20] heaven.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Almighty God came from heaven and took a
[1:07:25] journey down through life and gave gave
[1:07:28] promise to such men as Abraham, Isaac,
[1:07:31] and Jacob. You can say what you wish
[1:07:33] about Abraham. Right. Right.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe he Well, he said something that
[1:07:40] wasn't exactly true. It's all you find
[1:07:44] him in the New Testament after the
[1:07:47] cross, you'll find him only as a father
[1:07:50] of the faith.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You'll find that he has a a life of
[1:07:54] perfection.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, in this
[1:07:57] world, you're a sinner.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; In that world, you're pure and holy.
[1:08:03] And it just depends what world you want
[1:08:06] to concentrate on. What world you want
[1:08:08] to allow your mind to have you carried
[1:08:11] away in. And I have been so pondering. I
[1:08:14] can speak with very forcibly this
[1:08:17] morning because I have been pondering
[1:08:20] for many many hours until until even as
[1:08:23] I read this this these scriptures which
[1:08:26] we read as a text. The very spirit of
[1:08:29] that atmosphere comes upon me and I
[1:08:33] begin to tremble. I begin to weep to
[1:08:36] think that Melzdc
[1:08:38] would go and get her.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Let me say something to you. Melazedc,
[1:08:43] this same one came by your way.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Came by your way.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was at a well.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; I trusted. Oh, God. Let it be in the
[1:08:58] service. Let somebody
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; and I can tell you one thing. You'll be
[1:09:02] aruck
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; at his very presence.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; You won't feel that you're a high
[1:09:08] achiever.
[1:09:10] you will just marvel that he even
[1:09:13] stopped by your way.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And here he speaks to her and says,
[1:09:18] "Give me a drink." Oh, he said, "If you
[1:09:22] knew who you're talking to,
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; that's a whole lot of the problem. We
[1:09:27] don't recognize who it is we're talking
[1:09:29] to. We don't realize who it is we're
[1:09:33] raising our arms to. We don't realize
[1:09:36] who it is that's right here. Deity
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; becoming flesh.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Faith to remember
[1:09:55] that great Melzdc back yonder who had no
[1:09:59] beginning of days. Notice where he
[1:10:01] starts.
[1:10:03] No beginning of days.
[1:10:07] had no father nor mother
[1:10:11] and he had no end of life.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; He still lives.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You ought to let your mouth be released
[1:10:23] and say thank you
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; almighty God.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; No beginning of days that means you're
[1:10:29] present.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Means you see me in my situation.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You know exactly where I am. Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You know what kind of person I am
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; and I even though I may feel no good,
[1:10:42] you're God.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Even though I may I may feel not very
[1:10:47] righteous, but you are all
[1:10:49] righteousness.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And then was incarnated
[1:10:59] called Jesus Christ. Became flesh. died
[1:11:05] went back
[1:11:07] went back to it again. He's still the
[1:11:10] king of peace.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; King of righteousness.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Promising
[1:11:16] uh promise promising us these great
[1:11:19] eternal things.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] And he has been swore by God to Abraham
[1:11:25] that he would keep the covenant, the
[1:11:29] promise to him and his seed forever.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; If Jesus was God, he had to go to
[1:11:37] Samaria.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; If Jesus is God, he had to come to
[1:11:42] Cloverdale.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He had to come to the Pacific Northwest.
[1:11:47] He had to come to where you're studying.
[1:11:49] He had to come to where you're working.
[1:11:52] He has to come
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; because he's God.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I made a promise.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; I can't break the promise.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I got to get every seed that was in the
[1:12:03] mind of God.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And then 10 years later,
[1:12:13] Brother Brandham still speaking. 10
[1:12:16] years later in who is this Melzdc?
[1:12:22] A theophony of something
[1:12:25] helping us now to understand it. A
[1:12:28] theophony of something
[1:12:32] that you could not see.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; You have a theophony beside you.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; It it's another world. We don't
[1:12:43] understand it.
[1:12:46] We are in a body of senses and these
[1:12:49] five senses are made to contact this
[1:12:52] world. You hear me speaking. You see me
[1:12:55] standing here. But like the prophet of
[1:12:58] God said, "You don't really know him.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; You don't know me and I don't know you."
[1:13:03] He said, "You've never seen me.
[1:13:06] I've never seen you."
[1:13:08] the real
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; this body, but the essence of it,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; the essence that cries out after God,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; the essence that desires him.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; All this body is is a framework
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; that packs it around.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And it is to be in harmony with
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; what you really are called to be.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; You're called to be not to fill a
[1:13:41] position in this world. This world is
[1:13:44] passing away.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; This world's nothing but a bunch of
[1:13:48] ashes.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You're called for something much higher.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; And I want you to recognize today,
[1:13:55] friends,
[1:13:56] you should walk. You shall walk. Not
[1:14:00] should. You shall walk with your
[1:14:02] shoulders back.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. Yeah,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of the living God. I have
[1:14:08] no part of this stuff. If you see
[1:14:11] anything in me, you might ask and I may
[1:14:14] be able to speak to you, but God, I want
[1:14:18] to I'm the I've been made the salt of
[1:14:21] the earth.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's not me talking.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; That is the word of God.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; You're the light of the world.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You need to walk like the light of the
[1:14:33] world.
[1:14:34] Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Does that scare you?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And he said to try to explain it, it's
[1:14:51] just like well television.
[1:14:56] That's another dimension.
[1:15:01] Television people are moving right
[1:15:04] through these rooms now.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just a switch for you.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; No, it's not a switch. If it wasn't
[1:15:16] going through the room, the switch
[1:15:17] wouldn't do anything.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Colors are going through the room.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Voices are going through the room.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; In other places, it says bodies are
[1:15:27] going through the room.
[1:15:29] And a television does not invent the
[1:15:32] picture.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; It only catches and captures what's
[1:15:36] there
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and transforms and sends it to a screen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; But he said the eye is only subject to
[1:15:47] the five senses. Then he said your whole
[1:15:50] being your whole being is only subject
[1:15:53] to five senses rather and you are only
[1:15:57] subject to what the sight has been
[1:16:00] limited to see.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; So we see one another. We shake one
[1:16:05] another's hands. We say God bless you
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and you hear the words. You see a mouth
[1:16:11] speaking. But that's in this life and
[1:16:14] it's only harmonizing the essence
[1:16:18] of what's inside. Say God bless you is
[1:16:22] not just a term.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you
[1:16:28] is an announcement.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; It's a pronouncement upon you if you
[1:16:33] receive it that way.
[1:16:37] And you are only subject to the sight
[1:16:41] that has been limited to see. But there
[1:16:44] is another dimension that can only be
[1:16:47] seen by a transformation
[1:16:52] by television.
[1:16:56] It was here when Adam was here.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It was here when Elijah was here.
[1:17:03] Television was here. When Jesus Christ
[1:17:05] walked the shores of Galilee and when he
[1:17:08] sat on the well, it was here.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; But he said, "You're just now
[1:17:16] discovering it." Isn't that amazing? Why
[1:17:19] are we discovering it now?
[1:17:23] Because we are a people. Listen to me.
[1:17:27] We are a people designed for higher
[1:17:31] things. Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Greater things
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; and we believe things that people
[1:17:36] earlier would have called us us crazy
[1:17:39] for.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; But we have received a prophet and he
[1:17:45] he lived in another world.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus lived in another world.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; They crucified him for some purpose.
[1:17:53] They crucified him because they didn't
[1:17:55] understand him and they condemned him
[1:17:58] and he was worthy of death according to
[1:18:01] that.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Would you be willing to stand for your
[1:18:05] faith?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; If you were
[1:18:10] assigned
[1:18:13] worthy of death,
[1:18:16] I say that
[1:18:18] what we believe is too precious
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; to give up to anybody.
[1:18:29] And so it is
[1:18:33] and this I want to impress you with
[1:18:37] he's talking about television because
[1:18:39] that helps us to understand it. But he
[1:18:41] said so it is.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to say so it is.
[1:18:48] So it is
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; that Christ is here.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Christ is here.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; So it is.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; It should that should not surprise you
[1:18:58] anymore or me any be any more difficult
[1:19:02] for you to say that than it would be to
[1:19:05] turn on the switch.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Turn on the screen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Turn on the flat screen. I don't I don't
[1:19:12] I go I don't get aruck when I turn on
[1:19:15] the flat screen in my study and see
[1:19:18] brother Derek out here leading the song
[1:19:20] and leading the worship of the people. I
[1:19:23] don't stand back say, "Oh my goodness.
[1:19:28] I expect it to come on."
[1:19:32] You come here to this service,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; you should expect
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; that this Christ
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; that this God
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; who in the days of Jesus Christ
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; walked in a body that got weary and sat
[1:19:50] on a well. He knew which well he was
[1:19:52] sitting on. He knew that woman was
[1:19:55] coming. That didn't shock him. That
[1:19:58] didn't surprise him. He and and that God
[1:20:02] knew that you were going to come to this
[1:20:04] service.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; He knew that you needed to hear
[1:20:08] something today.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And I am speaking these things because
[1:20:14] your theophony
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; is calling for it. Your eternal home is
[1:20:20] calling for it.
[1:20:22] Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; And now you'll know after this service
[1:20:26] I'm going to be as short as I can and
[1:20:29] I'm not going to be overly long.
[1:20:33] But please give me your not only your
[1:20:36] attention but just cry out to God.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; he of whom he that man is speaking of
[1:20:45] let him come and be a reality to me.
[1:20:48] caused me to be aruck
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; at his divine presence.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And so is Christ is here and angels of
[1:21:01] God are here.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my, they're everywhere.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Angels of God are here. And someday in
[1:21:11] the great millennium to come, it'll just
[1:21:15] be more real than television or anything
[1:21:18] else.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; It'll be more real than the flat screen
[1:21:22] in my study. It'll be more real. It'll
[1:21:26] be I won't be turning on a button. I'll
[1:21:28] just be looking up to Father. Oh,
[1:21:31] Father,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; I've known you. I've talked with you.
[1:21:35] You came by my way.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Friend, he came to my country.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; He came where I go hunting.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; He came to an old log that I sat on.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; He spoke through another mouth called a
[1:21:59] prophet's mouth.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Spoke directly and revealed the secret
[1:22:03] in my heart.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. And I was I was in a
[1:22:10] desolate condition
[1:22:13] preaching the gospel for seven years.
[1:22:16] Didn't know how to baptize. Didn't know
[1:22:19] how whether God was one, is he two? Is
[1:22:22] he three? And I've heard everything.
[1:22:25] Heard good ministers. Had dear friends.
[1:22:29] That's all in the emotional realm, my
[1:22:32] friends. But he
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; when he makes himself known, it's done.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; It's anchored forever. You never have
[1:22:40] another question about it. It's all
[1:22:42] settled.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You are here because
[1:22:53] you passed by that
[1:22:56] unbelief brought you here.
[1:22:59] But faith will take you out. Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; He said there was another prophet by the
[1:23:08] name of Moses and another one by the
[1:23:10] name of Elijah.
[1:23:12] They had both died. One one had died and
[1:23:16] his body was carried away by the angels
[1:23:19] and buried someplace
[1:23:22] that was secret.
[1:23:24] And the other one didn't die. He was
[1:23:26] actually caught away
[1:23:29] in a chariot of fire.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Horses of fire.
[1:23:35] That's what Elisha said.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Didn't look like he persuaded too many
[1:23:40] people.
[1:23:42] He didn't have big campaigns of people
[1:23:45] who believed what he was saying.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; But he said Elijah was caught away.
[1:23:50] It's few, friends.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; It's very few.
[1:23:54] It's few friends,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Be believing.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's very few.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But about 800 years later, the prophet
[1:24:06] refers to this.
[1:24:10] Jesus said to his disciples, "There'll
[1:24:13] be some of you that shall not die till
[1:24:16] you'll see the Lord coming in his
[1:24:21] power."
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And we think of that just as his coming.
[1:24:27] No. Then he took his disciples, just
[1:24:31] three of them,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Peter and John. And
[1:24:38] uh they went up on the mountain. Peter,
[1:24:41] James, and John
[1:24:43] went up in the mountain. And there
[1:24:46] appeared unto them
[1:24:49] Moses and Elijah standing there
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; with Jesus himself glorified.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus was in the glistening garment.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Where did the garment come from? I ask
[1:25:02] you. I tell you friends, God can do
[1:25:04] anything any time.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; We limit him so much. Oh, we're running
[1:25:11] by the clock and we have to do certain
[1:25:14] things by the clock. Forget it. Forget
[1:25:16] this world.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be slothful. You
[1:25:23] understand that?
[1:25:26] But we must not be preoccupied
[1:25:30] by Satan's Eden.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Preoccupied.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We're all dittery and we got to
[1:25:41] do here and we got to shop and we got to
[1:25:43] get this. I'm not against shopping. My
[1:25:46] wife does it all the time. I do it with
[1:25:48] her. I'm not opposed to that. We have to
[1:25:51] live life.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; But we live life. We study or we if you
[1:25:55] study, do your very best. If you work
[1:25:57] for a living, do your very best. If
[1:26:00] you're a wife or a and a cooking, do
[1:26:03] your very best. But that's not what it's
[1:26:05] all about.
[1:26:07] That's not what we're preoccupied with.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; We can be over the sink. We can be
[1:26:12] looking after children, but our minds
[1:26:15] are on heavenly things. Oh God, you are
[1:26:19] what I heard about Sunday. You are that
[1:26:23] Mechazedc
[1:26:25] and I do have a theophony. I believe
[1:26:27] every word of it. Do you believe?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe, saints?
[1:26:35] Do you believe in the balconies?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; You're believers.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; But so it is.
[1:26:53] Is not a liar
[1:26:57] speaking the truth. And so it is.
[1:27:00] Is television here? I could bring a
[1:27:02] television, turn it on, and you get some
[1:27:04] channels.
[1:27:06] So it is.
[1:27:09] Christ is here.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; So it is.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Angels of God are here.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; You can't touch him. Your body's not
[1:27:19] made for it. But the essence inside says
[1:27:22] it's true.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; So it is.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:30] So it is.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; The one who died for you. So it is.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He's resurrected.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; And he's living here now.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; And he's walking here in this
[1:27:44] generation.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; So it is.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I listen to that prophet. I get into
[1:27:54] such an atmosphere.
[1:27:57] And I hope you let me finish here just a
[1:27:59] few minutes, please.
[1:28:05] Prophet Moses and Elijah.
[1:28:08] And it says in that form,
[1:28:11] in that state on Mount Transfiguration,
[1:28:15] Peter, James, and John were there. But
[1:28:17] Jesus did not have to introduce Moses
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; and Elijah. He said in that state, they
[1:28:24] recognized them.
[1:28:26] Your mind will not be limited.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; You won't have to learn things.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; You won't have to learn any history
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; about them. You'll just know them
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and we will know even as we are known.
[1:28:45] He said, "If you're an attribute of God
[1:28:48] expressed here on earth," and that's
[1:28:50] what we have to walk around in this life
[1:28:53] and simply say, "I'm an attribute of
[1:28:56] almighty God.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; I'm an attribute of my father who made
[1:29:00] all this stuff.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I'm an attribute of God." You kids hear
[1:29:05] me? I'm an attribute of God. My father
[1:29:09] made these mountains.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; My father made this ocean. My father's
[1:29:14] in control of everything.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, this is happening and
[1:29:19] all the people that are dying from
[1:29:21] overdoses and everything." I just say,
[1:29:23] "Let it go. Whatever. Whatever." It's
[1:29:26] going to be a lot worse.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; It's going to get a lot worse.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, shall we stop?" No. Do
[1:29:32] whatever you need to do. Let the world
[1:29:34] do it.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Hope you don't take me wrong.
[1:29:44] I have here. He lived in two worlds. And
[1:29:47] you've heard me speak about it. Now it's
[1:29:49] comes crashing together.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm not of this world."
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; And you can say exactly the same thing.
[1:30:02] You must say the same thing.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world.
[1:30:12] I just come here at a short for a short
[1:30:15] period of time.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I have just above my study a picture of
[1:30:21] my mom, my sister, and myself.
[1:30:25] I'm about two, two and a half, three
[1:30:27] years old or something standing there. I
[1:30:30] thank God that she bore me and brought
[1:30:33] me into this world. That's not where I
[1:30:35] came from.
[1:30:39] That's not my origin.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet even spoke to
[1:30:47] his wife and his family.
[1:30:51] We're of another citizenship.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; You're not Americans and Canadians and
[1:30:57] Africans or whatever more. You come from
[1:31:01] God.
[1:31:05] God had to go to China.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; This MelzDC
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, wasn't that Murphy?"
[1:31:14] No,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; this is Melzdc
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; had to go to China.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Melzedc had to go to Congo
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; to Rwanda or wherever.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; MelzDC went there and found you. Amen.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe you were just walking around
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; hoing some dirt or whatever more.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; God only knows your life.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; God himself knows my life.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He knows how to penetrate any business
[1:31:44] wall,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; any office wall,
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; any educational institution.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He knows how to interrupt your studies
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; with his presence.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And suddenly you are aruck.
[1:31:59] Oh, I didn't know.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Nathan, your father, Michael Hunt,
[1:32:10] he wanted to go to Europe.
[1:32:13] I'm telling you something now you never
[1:32:15] heard before. Andrea, your daddy.
[1:32:18] Sharon, your daddy.
[1:32:20] He had to go to he wanted to go to
[1:32:23] Europe and he wanted to build himself up
[1:32:26] and his physique his mind was on his
[1:32:28] body
[1:32:31] want to build himself up. His dad worked
[1:32:33] for the Vancouver city. I promised
[1:32:35] myself I wouldn't tell stories but I
[1:32:37] have to tell this one.
[1:32:41] So he said to his dad worked in the
[1:32:43] machine with repairing the vehicles and
[1:32:46] so on. He said, "I want to get a job at
[1:32:48] the garbage detail."
[1:32:55] So he said, "Well, you could get
[1:32:56] something else." No, he said, "I want to
[1:32:58] hoist cans and have exercise." So that's
[1:33:01] where he got. He told me many times
[1:33:06] Bibles and tracks begin to fall out of
[1:33:09] the garbage cans.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And he'd pick them up. He couldn't he
[1:33:14] couldn't throw them in the garbage. He'd
[1:33:16] pick him up and stick him in his coat.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And he and he saw a little tract. And
[1:33:21] I'm sure the person that wrote that
[1:33:23] track never ever dreamed that a garbage
[1:33:27] collector
[1:33:29] who was a seed of God was going to pick
[1:33:32] that up as it bounced out of a garbage
[1:33:35] can. And it showed three men
[1:33:38] climbing the a hill and three crosses on
[1:33:43] top of the hill. No one man and three
[1:33:45] crosses on top of the hill. And this man
[1:33:50] was walking with great big burden and
[1:33:53] bags waiting him down,
[1:33:57] climbing up the hill. And when he went
[1:34:00] past the crosses and through the cross
[1:34:02] at whatever had happened there, he's
[1:34:05] running down the other hill and he's a
[1:34:08] little stick man little stick drawing
[1:34:11] and he's screaming and the sound waves
[1:34:15] are showing out of him. He's screaming
[1:34:18] and the bag is dropped off and is
[1:34:20] rolling down the hill. And Michael said,
[1:34:24] "Whatever he got,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; that's what I need.
[1:34:29] Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; God can use anything.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; God can use a cigarette package
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; to uh to inspire profit
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; to speak on sir
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; the subject of man's of a man's filter.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; A holy man's filter.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] And Michael, he went home and he went
[1:35:00] down in his basement, his mother and
[1:35:03] dad's basement where he was staying in a
[1:35:05] room down there for a while. And he
[1:35:07] walked back and forth in that room. And
[1:35:10] he said, "This presence of God, this
[1:35:13] Elohim, this Yahwa, whatever you want to
[1:35:16] call him, there's no particular
[1:35:19] vernacular that can can encompass him."
[1:35:22] Almighty God. Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Who has come in the form of Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ. And that's why that prophet
[1:35:31] could say, "You might hear my voice, but
[1:35:34] that's not me speaking."
[1:35:36] That voice was coming from another
[1:35:39] realm. And that's why people can't
[1:35:41] understand it. And that's why we can't
[1:35:44] explain it. It didn't come for
[1:35:46] explanation. It didn't come to just be
[1:35:50] uh subject material for preaching. Are
[1:35:53] you folks with me?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; It didn't come just so we could have
[1:35:59] nice sermons. It came to bring you into
[1:36:02] contact with the almighty God.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And he come into the form of Melzdc for
[1:36:08] Abraham's day. Came in the form of Jesus
[1:36:11] Christ in in his day and came in another
[1:36:14] form of a redeemed son. I don't make I
[1:36:18] don't make brother Brandham equal with
[1:36:20] Jesus Christ. Not at all. Jesus said,
[1:36:25] "Eat my flesh. Drink my blood." William
[1:36:28] Brandon could never say that. He was a
[1:36:31] redeemed son. He said, "I was born in
[1:36:33] sin, shapen in iniquity." He was like
[1:36:36] you, like me. But he came as a vessel.
[1:36:40] He said, "I can't help it."
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; He couldn't help seeing what he saw. And
[1:36:46] he couldn't help telling it. And you
[1:36:48] needed to hear it, and I need to say it.
[1:36:51] Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; You belong to another world.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You shall not give yourself to this
[1:37:02] world.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You must not be preoccupied with this
[1:37:06] world. We're preoccupied with another
[1:37:09] land.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Another place.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; And you're a lot closer to it than you
[1:37:14] think.
[1:37:16] Yes,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; you have a theophony
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; right by you at this time. You cannot
[1:37:24] see it. It doesn't mean it's not there.
[1:37:27] You can't see the television waves. You
[1:37:29] can't hear the radio sounds. All kinds
[1:37:32] of music going through this room. I'm
[1:37:34] glad we don't have a radio here to catch
[1:37:36] it. Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; We could turn this atmosphere in just a
[1:37:41] moment into some booming sound that
[1:37:44] you'd say, "Oh, shut it off."
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; But this this is not something I'm
[1:37:50] trying to get you to turn it on.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; You have the capacity.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; You were made
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; for this other realm.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; You're actually made for it.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; You have the inner essence.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're just sitting here as
[1:38:06] physical beings, but you have the inner
[1:38:09] essence. And I can tell you what it's
[1:38:11] saying. That inner essence is saying to
[1:38:13] you, it's true.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; It's true. It's all true.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; That inner essence is saying, "I believe
[1:38:21] it."
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Your mind has got all kinds of other
[1:38:25] things in it, but your inner essence is
[1:38:28] saying, "I believe that."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Hallelujah.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Just all right, brother Tom.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now,
[1:38:45] now we see." And I underlined it and I
[1:38:48] put it in red and yellow highlights
[1:38:51] because I was going to stand here today.
[1:38:54] Now we see
[1:38:57] the attribute sons of his spirit.
[1:39:01] Now I see the attribute daughters of his
[1:39:05] spirit.
[1:39:06] How shall I be treating them? How shall
[1:39:08] I be speaking to them? How shall I
[1:39:12] approach them?
[1:39:14] The redeemed of the Lord.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Are you such?
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Are you such?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Are you from another place?
[1:39:32] You've not entered the word form yet.
[1:39:37] But a theophony,
[1:39:39] this body is subject to the word.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; What I'm preaching, if it be the word of
[1:39:46] God, your theophony is subject to that
[1:39:48] word.
[1:39:58] After a short conversation with this
[1:40:00] woman,
[1:40:03] the one that said, "Give me to drink,"
[1:40:07] said the same voice, same person, same
[1:40:12] dress.
[1:40:15] The one who said, "Give me to drink,"
[1:40:18] said also, "I am he." Great.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; What changed?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And the moment the moment that she
[1:40:28] asked, she said, "Sir, I perceive that
[1:40:31] you're a prophet."
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Right away, her next statement was, "Our
[1:40:37] fathers worshiped in this mountain,
[1:40:43] and you say to work in worship in
[1:40:46] Jerusalem."
[1:40:48] And Jesus said, "The hour cometh,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; and now is
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; talking about that moment."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because her hour of recognition had
[1:41:01] come.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to make a statement now
[1:41:03] that I can't necessarily prove to you,
[1:41:06] but recognition of who he is that is
[1:41:10] approaching you is true worship. Because
[1:41:14] almighty God is seeing his seed come to
[1:41:17] him.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; He is seeing his seed aruck
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; in his presence.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; That means a whole lot more than
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; raising your hand or even clapping your
[1:41:30] hand. And don't stop doing that.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's fine. We're happy. So we clap our
[1:41:36] hands so but that's not just worship.
[1:41:40] Worship is when you are hearing this
[1:41:43] service this morning and you recognize
[1:41:45] I'm getting down here where you are. You
[1:41:47] recognize who it is
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; speaking to you.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; I've got experience after experience.
[1:42:06] I've had some of them that made me
[1:42:08] somewhat fearful.
[1:42:10] I have a daughter back here
[1:42:15] and we had just come not out of the not
[1:42:18] out of the well, but we just came out of
[1:42:20] Starbucks.
[1:42:23] She had a son who's here
[1:42:28] is not in the same spiritual condition
[1:42:30] that he is tonight today.
[1:42:35] and I was standing on the curb and she
[1:42:39] was standing below me.
[1:42:42] I'm her daddy. She didn't say daddy.
[1:42:49] She said, "My son
[1:42:51] said, you're a man of God."
[1:42:55] That was her address.
[1:42:58] And I the appearance on her face struck
[1:43:01] fear to my soul says you're a man of God
[1:43:06] and my son has died
[1:43:10] and I want him to live again.
[1:43:15] And the boy is here.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; The young man holding his child is here.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that God is dead.
[1:43:25] Don't tell me these naysayers know
[1:43:27] something about this message. They know
[1:43:30] nothing about this.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; They're nothing about this God that this
[1:43:34] prophet identified.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me friends?
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Nobody has a right or nobody should
[1:43:44] after this service sit on the fence.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; There is no fence. Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:43:53] God is God.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; He does whatever he wants
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; and you're looking at a person that has
[1:43:59] experienced too many things.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Too many things. This isn't something
[1:44:07] that comes by the intellect. It's
[1:44:09] something that comes in the heart
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; of faith.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that man who walked in
[1:44:19] the dust of the earth and sat down
[1:44:22] because he was tired and talking to a
[1:44:25] woman who was a prostitute.
[1:44:29] And she said, "I know when the Messiah
[1:44:31] comes, he'll tell us all things." And
[1:44:35] the same one that said a few minutes
[1:44:36] ago, "Give me the drink."
[1:44:40] He said, "I'm height."
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; And she believed it. and she received it
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; and went her way into a city. And I
[1:44:52] didn't go into a city, but I thought,
[1:44:54] I'm going I'm jumping in a car and I'm
[1:44:58] going to be driving down to Cloverdale
[1:45:00] Bible Way and I'll be there. I didn't
[1:45:04] come into a city, but I came here. Come
[1:45:06] see a man
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; that told me all that ever I did.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Is not this the Christ? I say this is
[1:45:16] the Christ.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; This is the Christ that's here in this
[1:45:20] building.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; This is the Christ that's talking to
[1:45:23] you.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; This is the Christ that is saying to you
[1:45:26] by his spirit, this is the truth.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Take it seriously.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; That was the moment of true worship.
[1:45:44] when he said, "I am he."
[1:45:47] And she recognized it.
[1:45:50] The prophet of God said she quickly
[1:45:52] recognized it. She didn't need to lope
[1:45:56] around and hear it again and be made
[1:45:59] happy or something. No, she recognized
[1:46:02] it right away. Quickly recognized it.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; And I came here this morning
[1:46:14] with a sense of
[1:46:19] I don't know exactly what it was.
[1:46:29] I don't want anybody to miss it.
[1:46:33] Don't want you to miss it.
[1:46:37] So, well, I've never experienced
[1:46:38] anything like that.
[1:46:41] What does it take? Well,
[1:46:48] unfortunately, sometimes it takes some
[1:46:50] painful things.
[1:46:58] Sometime it involves life's decisions.
[1:47:05] Sometime it involves things that we
[1:47:08] don't invite and we don't really want to
[1:47:10] go through.
[1:47:13] But when we get down and
[1:47:16] just almost want to throw dust in our
[1:47:19] hair,
[1:47:21] it doesn't always have to be that way.
[1:47:23] But I'm saying desperation is a
[1:47:26] wonderful thing.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; You get desperate before God.
[1:47:37] It doesn't have to be bad times, don't
[1:47:39] get me wrong.
[1:47:44] But when there's a realization,
[1:47:51] this isn't how things are always going
[1:47:52] to be.
[1:47:56] This isn't how it's always going to be.
[1:48:02] Some of you that have lost your
[1:48:05] dearest
[1:48:07] companion.
[1:48:10] That is why sometimes God will talk to a
[1:48:14] person
[1:48:15] in a special way
[1:48:19] and you realize everything is everything
[1:48:23] is meaningless.
[1:48:27] I and my wife talked about this this
[1:48:28] morning. We didn't talk about somebody
[1:48:32] passing away or anything. We talked
[1:48:34] about this world
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; in this world how meaningless it has
[1:48:41] become.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Who wants to stay here?
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Where in the world? I have a son. I have
[1:48:52] a grandson back there that was doing
[1:48:55] some work on Main Street and and uh what
[1:48:59] was it Sam? Maine and
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Hastings.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Maine and Hastings
[1:49:05] doing a job down there. And three times
[1:49:08] ambulances had to come in and pick up
[1:49:10] people that had overdosed. Three times
[1:49:13] while he's doing the job. Three times.
[1:49:18] You paid for it.
[1:49:22] You paid for all those ambulance people.
[1:49:26] You paid for those men that work there.
[1:49:28] Professionals.
[1:49:31] You paid for it. But people are
[1:49:34] injecting and so on so forth. That's
[1:49:36] their that's this world.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; All the ambulance, all that turmoil,
[1:49:41] Samuel, that's this world.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; God hasn't called you to this world.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; He came.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Melisedc came. Hallelujah.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the prophet of God
[1:49:52] came
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; not at his own choosing,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; but but but he was he he's demanded by
[1:49:59] God,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; commanded by God to remain faithful.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; I have to hurry or I won't get to where
[1:50:07] I want to go. Do you have a few more
[1:50:09] minutes?
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I won't be. It's 25 12 and I'm going to
[1:50:14] be just a few more minutes.
[1:50:18] I want to talk about the hour of
[1:50:20] recognition just for a moment.
[1:50:26] The Jews wanted the Greeks wanted to see
[1:50:29] Jesus
[1:50:31] says they never found him in Christmas.
[1:50:37] They never found him in organizations.
[1:50:41] They didn't find him in some creeds.
[1:50:44] And I live in this world. You live in
[1:50:47] this world. We hear all kinds of people
[1:50:50] that got different forms of worship and
[1:50:52] they all worship.
[1:50:58] Maybe one and a quarter billion
[1:51:02] of of Muslim people
[1:51:05] bow down, put their head to the ground.
[1:51:08] Don't tell me that they're are
[1:51:10] insincere. Right?
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that they don't mean it.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; I don't mock them. They do that. And
[1:51:21] someone else does something else
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; and they do everything to to worship.
[1:51:25] And I listen to I didn't listen to it,
[1:51:28] but I just seen a little bit on the
[1:51:30] screen. This is the way they worship and
[1:51:33] this is the way someone else worships.
[1:51:34] said you got everything under worship is
[1:51:39] for you to know him
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; whom to know is life eternal
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and in his presence you will not just
[1:51:49] become giggly
[1:51:53] or
[1:51:54] enthused
[1:51:56] or just inspired.
[1:51:59] All kinds of people get inspired.
[1:52:03] Why in the world are you talking like
[1:52:05] this, Brother Biscll?
[1:52:07] Because I know what that presence is
[1:52:10] like.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; I have experienced it. The woman at the
[1:52:15] well experienced it. People sitting here
[1:52:17] have experienced it. And I was telling
[1:52:20] you about Mike Hunt. I'll just finish
[1:52:22] this line. One day,
[1:52:28] God saw him. Whoever was dwelling in
[1:52:31] Melzdc saw him sticking those Bibles and
[1:52:35] tracks in his pocket or in his shirt
[1:52:38] because he didn't have he just had
[1:52:40] enough respect not to throw it away in
[1:52:43] the garbage.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; And he would come home and put it up on
[1:52:47] the shelf.
[1:52:49] And he was pacing back and forth one day
[1:52:55] and he fell face forward for the
[1:52:58] presence, the holy presence of a being.
[1:53:02] He'd never been in church in his life.
[1:53:04] He was 26 years old. Never been in a
[1:53:07] church. Never heard a sermon.
[1:53:10] And he fell forward
[1:53:13] on the floor. And he doesn't know how
[1:53:16] long he was there, but maybe an hour or
[1:53:18] two,
[1:53:24] the grace of God. And he was weeping,
[1:53:28] sodbing over his past until his eyes
[1:53:33] didn't want to open.
[1:53:35] And in that state,
[1:53:39] he got up,
[1:53:41] brother Ernie, and he went upstairs and
[1:53:42] his mother was standing there with a big
[1:53:44] skillet, cast iron skillet in her hand,
[1:53:49] and she just saw him. I'm not talking
[1:53:51] about somebody a thousand years ago. I'm
[1:53:54] talking about somebody just a few years
[1:53:55] ago right here in Vancouver.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Lived on Main Street, 57th in Maine. In
[1:54:02] Vancouver. and she's carrying this
[1:54:04] skillet cuz she was just going to be
[1:54:06] making supper. And she said, "Michael,
[1:54:09] don't come near me."
[1:54:11] He said, "It's all right, mother. I've
[1:54:14] just met God." She said, "Don't come
[1:54:16] near me. Don't come near me." What is
[1:54:19] that? The fear of the presence of God.
[1:54:23] She doesn't know what happened. She
[1:54:25] dropped the skillet on the floor.
[1:54:32] That man became a preacher.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Of this message
[1:54:37] and loved it with all his heart and
[1:54:39] soul.
[1:54:41] And I can tell you upon that
[1:54:42] recognition, whatever was in his past is
[1:54:46] forgiven and forgotten.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "It's as
[1:54:52] though you never did it in the first
[1:54:54] place." If you recognize him this
[1:54:56] morning
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; and ah
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; I think of I stand in presence. I stand
[1:55:03] in awe at the presence of the Lord.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; And we'll sing it in just a couple
[1:55:08] minutes.
[1:55:20] You know why this may be difficult for
[1:55:22] you?
[1:55:24] Because a prophet of God said this, "You
[1:55:27] lost your origin
[1:55:31] in the garden."
[1:55:34] You lost your origin.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching. So you might
[1:55:40] say, "Well, where is it? Where can I
[1:55:43] find it? My true origin."
[1:55:46] I tell you when you come into his
[1:55:48] presence and you realize
[1:55:52] maybe somebody I mean we got to realize
[1:55:54] that deity is in us. Amen.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's some brother. Maybe it's some
[1:56:01] sister. Maybe it's some service. Maybe
[1:56:03] it's this service.
[1:56:05] I don't know. I'm not going to try to
[1:56:08] excite you or
[1:56:11] inspire you to say so. But God, you met
[1:56:14] someplace along the road. You met God
[1:56:19] and God made himself known to you. That
[1:56:22] changes absolutely everything,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; does it not?
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Says one day
[1:56:43] I want to get this to you.
[1:56:46] He says the Samaritan woman, she quickly
[1:56:49] recognized
[1:56:51] that was the sign of the Messiah
[1:56:55] and that he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:56:57] and forever between the races
[1:57:00] then that he went to deal with. Isn't he
[1:57:04] the same today if he manifested himself
[1:57:07] in that way
[1:57:09] to prove he was a Messiah to them?
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:16] Are you agreeing with me?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't worry, please.
[1:57:27] Isn't he obligated
[1:57:29] to us in this day? Do you feel this God,
[1:57:34] unchanging God?
[1:57:36] He would be obligated to honor the same
[1:57:39] faith and do the same thing today.
[1:57:43] You say, "Oh, well that's just Brother
[1:57:44] Ed. Maybe it's not."
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just Brother Tom. Maybe
[1:57:49] it's not.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just my husband or that's
[1:57:52] just my wife. Maybe it's not. That's
[1:57:54] just my parents. Maybe it's not.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it.
[1:58:02] Maybe God is talking through them.
[1:58:08] And he said, "Wouldn't he be obligated
[1:58:10] to do the same thing?"
[1:58:13] Excuse me.
[1:58:17] He said, "There's a lady.
[1:58:20] The lady is not here for herself.
[1:58:27] She's here for someone else.
[1:58:30] That's a brother."
[1:58:33] Listen to this, friend. This is so
[1:58:34] profound. I didn't even know how to
[1:58:37] approach it. He said, "I see them coming
[1:58:40] up together
[1:58:43] in the world he's in."
[1:58:46] He sees them both coming up together
[1:58:50] and then he continues on
[1:58:56] and the brother is in a horrible
[1:58:58] condition.
[1:59:07] right now. He's in a horrible condition
[1:59:09] right now. He's an alcoholic
[1:59:14] and he's laying drunk
[1:59:17] and he was so drunk you couldn't sober
[1:59:20] him up enough to come to this meeting.
[1:59:23] And the prophet just said, "I see you
[1:59:25] coming up together."
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:29] Her faith had literally materialized
[1:59:32] him.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, my precious friends that go here to
[1:59:39] Cloverdale Bible Way, this God that I'm
[1:59:43] talking about is so alive and so near,
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; nearer than you dare to make him.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; He's able to do all manner of things
[1:59:56] that you have need of. It's us that need
[1:59:59] the faith.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And she came up on his behalf.
[2:00:05] And he says this, he's an alcoholic and
[2:00:08] he's laying drunk. You couldn't get him
[2:00:10] sober enough
[2:00:12] to bring him to this meeting. And that's
[2:00:15] thus saith the Lord. Do you believe? And
[2:00:20] then he said, "Let us pray."
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; You see the power of it, friends. The
[2:00:25] power of it. You don't understand that.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; I don't understand that.
[2:00:31] But when you you can even come and hold
[2:00:33] someone in your heart and that's all a
[2:00:36] prophet will say you're coming with
[2:00:38] somebody else.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[2:00:43] Now I know I've gone over your heads.
[2:00:45] Don't look at me like a big question
[2:00:47] mark. Say amen. I believe it.
[2:00:54] God saw them both coming up together.
[2:00:57] That's what he saw.
[2:01:00] And then you want to hear some of his
[2:01:03] last words
[2:01:05] in this life.
[2:01:08] He said this
[2:01:10] after the rapture,
[2:01:13] after
[2:01:15] things that are to be,
[2:01:19] after these four services, he had one
[2:01:22] last one is communion.
[2:01:26] And while he's serving communion,
[2:01:29] speaking,
[2:01:33] he's talking about himself,
[2:01:36] walking out and he goes even back into
[2:01:37] his boyhood
[2:01:41] and he's talking about he's looking up
[2:01:44] at the trees. Oh, you'd say surely
[2:01:47] there'd be some masterful revelation.
[2:01:51] This is
[2:01:53] and he sees the trees
[2:01:56] sees a leaf fall.
[2:01:58] He said, "What was it?"
[2:02:03] He's talking about himself. He says
[2:02:05] there was another William Brandham, a
[2:02:08] little spot of eternal life down in
[2:02:11] there from the genes of God.
[2:02:21] says the word of God that was placed in
[2:02:24] there. Each one of you can think, Each
[2:02:27] one of you that are here can think
[2:02:31] of similar things.
[2:02:34] It was working.
[2:02:37] He's talking about eternal life. Your
[2:02:39] origin
[2:02:42] didn't come from here. I went I started
[2:02:45] the school and I left school and I I was
[2:02:48] born here and they were born forget it.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I'm very determined friends.
[2:02:59] I may be more determined than you are.
[2:03:02] I'm determined that you understand this.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; You did not come from this world.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; You did not have a start down here.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:13] You did not have a start with mommy and
[2:03:16] daddy.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; That was not your beginning.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; And neither will it be your end.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; If you came and are an elect of God, you
[2:03:27] came from the very thoughts and mind of
[2:03:29] God. He thought of you. He might have
[2:03:31] thought of you for millions of years. I
[2:03:33] don't know. How long did he think?
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; He thought about where you were, where
[2:03:41] you're going to be born.
[2:03:43] what kind of a character you're going to
[2:03:45] come with.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; In order to make that, I got to have
[2:03:49] this kind of a person, that kind of a
[2:03:50] person, another kind. They'll fall in
[2:03:52] love or whatever they call it down
[2:03:54] there.
[2:03:56] And then finally, there'll be the right
[2:03:58] mix,
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Because I'm looking for a certain t.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; I've got to have a certain t. I've just
[2:04:08] got to have a certain quality because
[2:04:11] it's going to show some side of me.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; I want that kind of a vessel
[2:04:19] and I will be the essence inside.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; I'll be the essence inside.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; I'll be the power that drives it.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; No, they won't understand it. They won't
[2:04:34] understand themselves. But a lot of
[2:04:35] people don't understand themselves.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; I knew you'd like this. I'm just just
[2:04:46] starting with this.
[2:04:50] He says, "And then
[2:04:53] he says, "What brought you here?"
[2:04:59] Maybe you can identify your mother and
[2:05:01] father, but they didn't bring you here.
[2:05:05] I'm not belittling your heritage.
[2:05:08] I'm not belittling your roots. But you
[2:05:10] can study your roots all your life and
[2:05:12] you they are not your roots.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God or a daughter of
[2:05:18] God, they are not your roots.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; They can only give you more trouble.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; I know.
[2:05:31] I know something about my heritage.
[2:05:37] Then one day he said, "I walked on."
[2:05:41] And that voice calling
[2:05:44] and he goes back. He he just is using a
[2:05:47] phrase,
[2:05:49] "Don't ever drink her." That's when he
[2:05:51] was about 8 years old.
[2:05:53] It's gone all the way back
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; to when he's just a child. This is his
[2:05:57] last service. These are his last words.
[2:06:01] Friends, you never know when you're
[2:06:03] speaking some of your last words. And I
[2:06:06] would love dearly love to be able to
[2:06:10] have the same thoughts. He said it was
[2:06:13] eternal life working in the body. And
[2:06:16] one day as I walk, don't never smoke or
[2:06:19] drink and so forth. And after the young
[2:06:23] fellows and they all got older, young
[2:06:27] guys,
[2:06:29] after the young fellas get older,
[2:06:37] maybe start your f further education.
[2:06:40] He said there was something moving
[2:06:45] and yet all at once he said
[2:06:49] there came a point. He said, I looked up
[2:06:52] and I said, I'm not the son of Charles
[2:06:56] and Ella Brham.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; That's that was his case.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; And that's a good place to come to.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, and he's not telling lies.
[2:07:12] Said they're not of this world even as
[2:07:14] I'm not of this world.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said?
[2:07:22] Just winding up to a close please.
[2:07:32] He said all the world
[2:07:36] Lord help me just bring this to a close
[2:07:41] said
[2:07:43] they were sending a man up to the moon.
[2:07:46] They were sending him astronaut up by
[2:07:48] the name of John Glenn.
[2:07:50] They said all the world was captivated
[2:07:52] by it.
[2:07:55] Said they were in awe.
[2:07:59] Saw this man
[2:08:01] on the end of a rocket
[2:08:05] getting shot into space.
[2:08:08] So they were struck with awe
[2:08:11] saying that
[2:08:21] he said the whole universe
[2:08:24] the whole universe
[2:08:26] will know
[2:08:30] and the angels will welcome him with a
[2:08:35] triumph.
[2:08:37] We're living in an astronaut age.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; You folks that are here,
[2:08:51] you come here to church.
[2:08:54] As sure as I'm standing here.
[2:08:57] Some of you might only be 6, 8 years
[2:08:59] old. Some of you might be just in your
[2:09:01] teens.
[2:09:03] Some of you might be just starting work.
[2:09:06] Some of you may just be starting a
[2:09:08] family.
[2:09:12] Some of you may be on the other end of
[2:09:14] the spectrum.
[2:09:16] You've done raised your family and
[2:09:18] they've gone.
[2:09:22] You won't go through life without
[2:09:24] disappointments.
[2:09:26] But I can tell you one thing is certain.
[2:09:29] One thing's absolutely certain. I speak
[2:09:31] without any hesitation to young men and
[2:09:35] young ladies.
[2:09:38] You preoccupy yourself with where you're
[2:09:41] going.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; You preoccupy yourself with a world
[2:09:47] that's coming.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And fact is that world is merged already
[2:09:52] with this world.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; And now
[2:09:57] you know something.
[2:09:59] I actually wrote down the statements of
[2:10:02] this man.
[2:10:05] And you may not have time to study it
[2:10:08] like I have. I spent two, three days
[2:10:11] this last week, but I can tell you I'm
[2:10:13] telling you friends, you're looking at
[2:10:15] me as your friend. I'm sure I wouldn't
[2:10:18] tell you a lie.
[2:10:20] I'll say to you without any hesitation
[2:10:23] or question,
[2:10:25] William Brham was a man expressing the
[2:10:30] essence of another world.
[2:10:41] voice. But that's not me speaking.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Who's speaking?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Where's it coming from?
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Why is it being said?
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Striving year after year after year
[2:10:57] to try to get people to believe to
[2:10:59] believe.
[2:11:03] Friends, I I declare to you this
[2:11:06] generation will give answer to that.
[2:11:09] said, "Didn't you hear it?
[2:11:12] Didn't you hear it?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Didn't you believe it?"
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Well, no. I had other things. What other
[2:11:18] things?
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; What other things was it? Well, I had my
[2:11:23] job and I had
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[2:11:32] is that at the end of the road what's
[2:11:35] going to be important?
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; No. Is that what's at the end of the
[2:11:39] road?
[2:11:41] I can speak about those things. And I
[2:11:44] speak to you solemnly today.
[2:11:47] I speak to you with all honesty.
[2:11:50] And I am praying I'm praying this that
[2:11:53] you will come to a spot.
[2:11:57] I pray for each one of you. I have
[2:12:00] prayed.
[2:12:04] That's what some of you need.
[2:12:08] You need that moment.
[2:12:10] And I can tell you exactly what it's
[2:12:12] like.
[2:12:15] You're afraid to breathe.
[2:12:18] You become aruck.
[2:12:22] And worship is something that has to do
[2:12:25] with being struck with awe. You know
[2:12:28] what awe is? A is
[2:12:31] a reverence
[2:12:34] that almost is overwhelming to you.
[2:12:39] A reverence and a commands a reverence.
[2:12:43] I assure you if Jesus Christ
[2:12:47] as he did with myself
[2:12:50] came and stood before you, you'd fall on
[2:12:53] your face.
[2:12:56] And now not because I ask you to do that
[2:12:59] but that would be real worship. It's not
[2:13:01] that you fall in your face that's
[2:13:03] worship. It's what happens in your
[2:13:05] heart. Oh God. And you can do that
[2:13:08] without falling on your face. Just say
[2:13:11] oh God.
[2:13:15] How
[2:13:17] how lovely you are.
[2:13:20] How wonderful you are. I wonder brother
[2:13:23] gonna have brother Derek. I want to sing
[2:13:26] uh part of that song.
[2:13:30] I stand in awe in the presence of the
[2:13:34] Lord.
[2:13:42] So have as little movement as possible.
[2:13:47] Yeah.
[2:13:48] I stand in all in the presence of the
[2:13:50] Lord. Let's let's sing that first verse.
[2:13:54] Would you help me, brother Ryan? Brother
[2:13:55] Ryan,
[2:13:57] [Music]
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; would you like to stand with me?
[2:14:01] [Music]

[2:14:13] is life
[2:14:17] whom the raing of the seize
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:25] the living sacrifice.
[2:14:29] The only source

[2:14:49] Oh,

[2:14:54] is the Lord
[2:14:58] forever.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; I love the words of this nice song. Nice
[2:15:04] mercy.
[2:15:06] His tender mercy come with every rising
[2:15:12] sun.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Sing it to him.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; The s
[2:15:17] his bro
[2:15:23] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:15:30] And those who trust in him will find
[2:15:35] their heart
[2:15:38] and

[2:15:56] home
[2:15:57] [Music]
[2:15:59] is in
[2:16:01] is in the Lord forever.
[2:16:08] Like to have you sing that verse again
[2:16:10] with me. Second verse is tender mercies
[2:16:15] come with every rising sun. You've
[2:16:18] experienced that.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Of course you have.
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:24] I just want him to have his way.
[2:16:28] Heavenly Father,
[2:16:30] touch every life.
[2:16:32] Touch these.
[2:16:35] They're precious to me. But how much
[2:16:38] more precious they are to you, oh God.
[2:16:41] You followed them. You went after them.
[2:16:45] You went to the country they were in.
[2:16:47] You went to the place where they worked.
[2:16:50] You went to their home. You went onto
[2:16:53] the streets and you talked to them and
[2:16:56] you wooed them. You called them by your
[2:17:00] Holy Spirit. And now we're here. We're
[2:17:03] here to give glory to your name. We're
[2:17:05] here to sing of your mercy and of your
[2:17:07] grace. We give you all the praise. Thank
[2:17:11] you, Lord Jesus. His tender mercies come
[2:17:16] with every rising sun
[2:17:21] to keep the sinner in his brokenness.
[2:17:28] In this brokenness, you offer healing
[2:17:31] and forgiveness.
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:37] And all
[2:17:40] in him will find your heart
[2:17:44] and rest
[2:17:46] my hope
[2:17:49] in the Lord.
[2:17:53] But this time
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:18:02] my
[2:18:05] is
[2:18:09] forever.

[2:18:26] Uh, I want to sing. Is that all right?
[2:18:31] You join with me. But I want to sing. If
[2:18:34] that wasn't love,
[2:18:40] he left the splendor of heaven.
[2:18:44] Knowing his destiny. Oh,
[2:18:48] how wonderful you are, Lord.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:53] It was the lonely hill of Goltha.
[2:18:57] The disciples didn't want him to go, but
[2:19:00] there to lay down his life for me.
[2:19:06] Sing it. Do you know it?
[2:19:10] [Music]
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Don't knowing
[2:19:18] his destiny.

[2:20:05] Oh yes.
[2:20:12] Oh, thank you Lord.
[2:20:15] Let us.
[2:20:20] It's not a fellow. There's no
[2:20:24] like this
[2:20:29] if
[2:20:33] listen this is where we were this next
[2:20:36] verse
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:45] and the thief hanging by
[2:20:48] his
[2:20:52] Then he spoke with love and compassion.
[2:20:59] And he took him to heaven.
[2:21:04] Oh, is that wonderful if that was

[2:21:48] like this.
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:21:59] We're going to sing that last verse
[2:22:01] again. You're not the thief on the
[2:22:03] cross.
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:07] But he didn't have much more to live
[2:22:09] for, did he?
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:18] Maybe he just got caught in a bad
[2:22:20] scheme. I don't know.
[2:22:24] But he was hanging beside the right
[2:22:26] person.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that wonderful, Brother Terry?
[2:22:31] He was hanging beside the right person.
[2:22:35] Something came over him.
[2:22:38] He saw I'm hanging here. I deserve this.
[2:22:42] This man doesn't deserve it. And he
[2:22:44] asked chastise his mate. He said, "We're
[2:22:48] suffering for our evil life. This man
[2:22:52] has done nothing." And then he got a
[2:22:55] revelation. Friends, listen to me. He
[2:22:58] got a revelation even the apostles
[2:23:00] didn't have. They thought the kingdom
[2:23:03] was collapsing. And he said, "Lord, when
[2:23:07] you come into your kingdom, remember me.
[2:23:11] Remember
[2:23:12] me,
[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:22] Brother Bruce.
[2:23:24] You folks from China.
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:29] When we were there
[2:23:32] were being held,
[2:23:35] one of the men looked very, very hard.
[2:23:38] He looked hard. He looked like he come
[2:23:40] out of the movies.
[2:23:43] He looked very hard.
[2:23:47] But then when we were commanded to be
[2:23:49] let loose and released,
[2:23:52] we were having our last dinner and they
[2:23:55] sat the police sat at another table and
[2:23:58] we sat here and a little brother that
[2:24:02] was carrying the message
[2:24:05] was sitting right beside me and his his
[2:24:07] wife was going to have a baby.
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:12] I'm not wanting to touch your emotions
[2:24:14] right now, but it was really emotional.
[2:24:17] He We weren't supposed to speak anywhere
[2:24:19] walking down the hall
[2:24:23] and he said, "I think I'm going to be
[2:24:24] here for a long time."
[2:24:28] He said, "Would you look after my wife
[2:24:31] and my baby?"
[2:24:33] I said, "Yes."
[2:24:35] And the police said, "Don't speak."
[2:24:39] But this was the last night
[2:24:42] and we're sitting there having our last
[2:24:44] meal
[2:24:47] and this man seemed so hard came and he
[2:24:52] stood behind
[2:24:54] this brother John a small man and tapped
[2:24:58] his shoulder
[2:25:01] and he said I was good to you.
[2:25:05] He said, "When you're out of here."
[2:25:09] And he tapped his heart. He said,
[2:25:10] "Remember me."
[2:25:13] I thought he said the right thing.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; He said the right thing. I don't know
[2:25:19] how God is going to speak to him. But
[2:25:23] this one,
[2:25:25] he recognized the right thing.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; He wasn't the thief. He was the
[2:25:29] policeman. But he said, "When you're out
[2:25:33] of here, remember me." He's talking
[2:25:37] about He's talking to somebody was
[2:25:38] arrested
[2:25:40] for the gospel.
[2:25:43] He said, "Remember me
[2:25:45] this morning. Maybe it isn't much of a
[2:25:48] message, but happens to be the fourth
[2:25:51] chapter of John.
[2:25:54] It happens to be about someone
[2:25:57] Melzdc who became Jesus.
[2:26:01] And he was soon heading for the cross.
[2:26:06] He had done nothing.
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:11] And this man was wicked and treacherous
[2:26:14] thief hanging there and he needed to
[2:26:17] hang there. But he just says to this
[2:26:20] other man,
[2:26:22] "When you come into your kingdom,
[2:26:23] remember me."
[2:26:27] That's why I want to sing it. Help me
[2:26:30] out.
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; He remembered you where you were.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Then he spoke
[2:26:52] with love and compassion.
[2:26:57] Then he took him into paradise.
[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:12] The ocean is bright.
[2:27:18] There are no stars in the sky.
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:25] The sparrow can fly
[2:27:30] [Music]
[2:27:38] then heaven.
[2:27:40] [Music]
