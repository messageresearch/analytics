An unspoken prayer request by brother Luis and Sister Elizabeth Diaz. and also a prayer request for Enrique Salazar who's at the hospital for observation to undergo angiogram surgery. That's from brother Leon Garland, brother from the Philippines. We just want to bring those requests before the Lord. And if you have a need in your heart, we we know that God is faithful to answer. Amen. We believe he's our portion. Bless you, brother John. Why don't you slip up your heart to the Lord? Hallelujah, Lord. Lord, we want to open up our mouths this morning and give praises to your name, Lord. Oh, God. We don't want the rocks to have to cry out, Lord. Sons and daughters are here, God, humbly approaching your throne, Lord. Lifting up our hearts and shouting in adorations to your precious name, God. How great thou art, Lord. How great thou art, Lord. We just throw up our hands today and say, you're the one that is the greatest thing in all of our lives, in the universe, Lord. Even the greatest of our concerns is swallowed up in your great divine power that you're wanting to release upon us as your children. Lord, let sons and daughters sing. Let sons and daughters believe, Lord, as we've been anointed to receive. And all that we have need of, Lord, is wrapped up in your precious atonement, Lord. And we want to come into the camp of the believers this morning and cast aside all of our doubts and unbelief. We want to leave behind us the voices of the world. Leave behind us the voices of our jobs and and education, Lord, and schooling and burdens that would be upon so many hearts, even in the valleys of decisions, Lord, and you're our provider, God, and you meet every need. But we want to leave the camp, Lord, of just our senses. We want to come into that faith realm, Lord, where all things are possible, where there can be a divine connection between our souls, Lord, and you, our precious Jesus. Lord, we just worship you right now, God. We bow our heads and we lift up our hearts, God, the creator of this universe, the one that came down and suffered without the camp to bear our sins and shed your blood for our lives. We receive that today, God. And for healing, Lord, even for our Filipino brother that's under observation, would your precious Holy Spirit go to this need, God? And would you just dissolve everything that's wrong with any system, Lord, and meet his need, God, unspoken request of the DS family. You are the God that answers all of our needs and our requests. Even before we ask, Lord, your your hand is beckoning to us to come deeper, come further. Let us go higher today. Lord, may the ministry be anointed, God, with that eagle anointing, Jesus, as your word is a discerner of our thoughts and of our intents. Lord, I pray there'd be a great calmness today as you speak your word to our lives this long weekend, Lord. And many are traveling and are away with one with their families. We pray for protection for them, Lord, and for your mercies to be upon your body, God, as we come into the camp of the believers today and where your Holy Spirit is and where your word is. May there be a great release to our hearts, God, as as we're worshippers, God, in your in your name. May you descend down upon this meeting and bless every soul and every life, every man, every woman, those on the internet, God, we pray for them, Lord, that even while the word is ministered, Jesus, there would be a great healing and deliverance upon all of our lives, God, as we as we look to you now. And we want to thank you for answering the prayers. Thank you for answering every prayer this morning. God, every heart that reached out in faith, you are already on the way, God. Release your power upon us throughout this service. Let us be receiving and giving our love to you, God, in adoration. Bless our brother Nathan, God, for standing in the gap, Lord, and the musicians in every life. May there be a special anointing upon this meeting today and the baptism God that you'd fill them with the Holy Ghost. Lord, fill us all, God, freshly new, Lord, with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that our hearts could yearn for a greater reality and you could meet that Lord. We give the service to you in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, brother John. Have your seats, please. Well, it's good to be here this morning and in the sunlight of the Lord. And we've got a few announcements. Um, Brother Alex and Sister Janine um recently moved from Cloverdale to Victoria. Um, they're sending greetings. They're streaming with us this morning. So, we want to say God bless you to them. Let's say God bless you. God bless you, brother. Praise the Lord. I miss brother Alex. He was always at the prayer meeting and a real prayer warrior and we really appreciated him and his wife and his family. And also, um, brother Christ friend and sister Hilda welcomed their baby born la a baby boy born last week, their third son, Josiah. We just want to welcome you into the family of God. Amen. And we have a visitor with us today, um, Sister Rose Gonzalez from Mount Vernon. She came with Brother Ken and Sister Joyce. We just want to welcome her in the assembly this morning as well. Praise the Lord. Also, Brother Matthew Redell has put in a announcement. There's going to be uh outreach in Seattle on Saturday, September the 24th, and a meeting will be held in the chapel next Sunday after the morning service to provide all the details. God is doing wonderful things. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. We see the fruits of it already and we're just so so um so happy to see that and just rejoice in it. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that uh congregational number together. Um, we've got a baby dedication this morning. Brother Jay and Sister Grace want to dedicate little Jesse. And so we'll sing a couple of verses of He Abides. And um, the Florence sisters are going to uh, sing as Brother Jay and Sister Grace bring their baby forward. And we'll just ask them to be ready right after we sing this song. I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the children away for the hand on all my life I see. Oh no my secret. [Applause] [Applause] [Music] My heart [Music] [Applause] and then I will be with Heat.

Isn't this this is something unusual, isn't it, Isaac Violet? We got the family and we got family number two coming here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I am indeed uh uh privileged to dedicate Josiah Jesse Oed. &gt;&gt; Pardon? privileged that you &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're privileged. Thank you. Thank you, Jay. Uh other family members, Sister Grace's mother and dad are here, brother Sister Frandy. This is their last Sunday. We're happy they're able to be here as well. Other friends, and uh especially to have uh Violet and Isaac here as well. So we picked this day, had this day selected so we could have this time. So brother Jade, Sister Gracie has called their son Jesse, which is one uh I've just chosen certain parts of, you know, you can find all kinds of meanings to names and things and I don't know for sure just where all those meanings, but I really do trust the Bible, &gt;&gt; right? says, you know, it says that God exists. Jesse, God exists. &gt;&gt; I possess and God's gift. And secondly, O OED, his second name, servant of God, a worshipper and a follower, not a follower of men, but a follower of God. and Bey. I knew that was going to bring a surprise look. They didn't think I was going to say anything about Bey. You don't know where that came from. All right. Bey is from Bartholomew. The disciple of Jesus. It has its roots and its origin in both Scottish and Irish. And it is one in in that language. It was one who was assigned land by the government to entertain and to have people that were appointed to them. They were given land and on that land they would grow uh have grow their food and with that food they would uh feed those that had been appointed to them. There'd be people that were appointed. It was a very honorable position that they were given. And so these people were certainly given to hospitality. They were to welcome and to feed and to nourish those that had been appointed to them. And I thought that was a marvelous thing that I could not only minister and a dedication for the baby but for the family. uh uh those that have that name, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They are to be as Bartholomew uh people of hospitality, people that are prepared to have others and and and it's not there it was back then that the government appointed certain people, but now we're under a different government. And God brings people by your way to whose lives your lives will touch and you're to minister to them and to nourish them and to be hospitable to them. And I know that you are. And perhaps that name may even now explain a wee bit of your lives. How it has been it has been that way. Jesse is a gift from God to the Bey family. has had some challenges very early in his life just as an infant experienced more medically than a lot of people may experience in a good part of their life. God spared him. And may he get may God get glory from his life and may he give to brother Jay and sister Grace be a credit to the family and may Jesse be a son through whom God can show that he indeed exists. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a lady that came to Brother Brham. I'm just going to take a few moments now. There was a lady who came to her brother Brham. It wasn't Sister Grace, but it was there's some similarities. And uh she said, "I enjoyed the messages." And she said, "I certainly believe you are a servant of the Lord." And he said, "Thank you, sister. God reward you for that." And while she was standing there, he said, "I saw a vision and she was away in her middle age." And I said, "Sister, thus saith the Lord, I see you standing holding a baby in your arms in a little blanket." And she said, "Me?" He said, "Yes, ma'am, you. It's thus sayith the Lord." And she said, "I hope you're right." And I said, "It isn't me speaking. It's thus sayith the Lord." Well, two or three, four years passed and she began to doubt it. And then Brother Brham met her husband and her husband wanted to do something for Brother just wanted to give him his coat cuz it was a cold time. It was up in Canada actually that happened. And he said, he said, "Tell your wife to quit doubting about the baby." And that's been about 3 years ago. And well, last week the baby was born. After 8 years, something God's word is eternally true. And the same God that lived in the Old Testament lives today. &gt;&gt; And I say, the same God that lived 40 years ago lives today. Amen. &gt;&gt; This child came as a surprise and we don't know why exactly, but God had a plan. I don't know what the end of this child was. I don't know. He's probably living today, but God had a plan for him. And that baby was certainly unexpected. This baby was certainly unexpected. And uh now we have Jesse Oed here being held by his father. But God knew all about it. The Bible says, "Lo, children," that's all children are the heritage of the Lord. In other words, they're God's property and they're lent to us for a little while and we don't know how long. And so God wants you, brother Jay, and you, Sister Grace, as I know you have and do, is to train the child, pro provide care for it, and more than that, be an example of spiritual life and instruct and train him up in the way that he should go. And may he may this family circle these words were on my heart last night. May this beady family circle be unbroken &gt;&gt; at the marriage table of the Lord. We'll dedicate Jesse. We'll pray together. Heavenly Father, I hold this jewel that you have given, this gem into the Beady family. This Bartholomew disciple of Jesus Christ, chosen by the lamb of God as you walked here, Lord Jesus. You chose him. And now you've chosen this family. You've chosen them to be disciples of yours. You've chosen them, oh God, to be mother and father now of a another child and they have named him Jesse. God exists. &gt;&gt; O bed a worshshiper, one who follows God. May this child ever follow God. And may you heavenly father manifest yourself in his little life and showing that God is alive. God exists yesterday, today and forever. I bless this child in the name of Jesus Christ. And father, as you have given him to brother Jay and sister Grace and now we dedicate him back to you, we dedicate Jesse Oed to fulfill his purpose and calling in life. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray your blessing upon this entire family, upon Isaac, Violet, oh God. And on that day at the appointed time, there will be a table spread. It is the marriage supper of the lamb. And by your grace, we shall all be there. Father, we claim that. We believe that. We hold it as our treasure in our heart. And now, Lord, receive Jesse. I pray. Watch over him. Keep him in good health always. I ask father many way may he when he hears the name Jesus may something in him jump oh god hallelujah may his soul leap oh father &gt;&gt; at the sound of that name &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ amen &gt;&gt; bless God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. City Grace, God bless you, Isaac. What do you think of him? God bless you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus loved the children &gt;&gt; and he took time with the children. And other people didn't understand perhaps why he took time with the children. &gt;&gt; But he takes time for the children because he doesn't just see them as babes. He sees them as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have also uh happy to receive this morning uh not the first time in church but the first time as a family our sister Sephora. I wonder if sister Sephora and the family could stand please. And we have sister Sephora, sister Naomi, sister Mila, brother Richard, brother Jean, and Jessica. Is it Jessica? I'm not too sure. All right, that's the family. They've come. They have settled here. Uh the children for the most part will be in school except for Naomi. She's got to go on to her higher education. And we just want to welcome them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] Father brother Jean is in Ghana. He's probably streaming the meeting right now and uh no doubt has some tears in his eyes because he wishes he could be here, I'm sure. And we wish he could be here and we're we're looking forward and we're working towards that end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't the Lord wonderful? &gt;&gt; I think he's just so wonderful. the school children uh in all the not just here but the school children that are of school age are going to be going back to school this next week. And we want to pray. &gt;&gt; We don't want to pray after the fact. &gt;&gt; We want to pray before the fact. &gt;&gt; And young people and children, we're praying for you. &gt;&gt; Not just some idol prayer, but we're holding on to God for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God hold you in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh there's those that will be going to uh the Bible way Christian Academy. There are some that will be in other schools and on the state side in Canada. They'll be in public schools. There are some that are local here. And of course are many through the live streaming and the archive streaming. There are those that are sitting in their rooms listening and being part of this service and there are children that are looking at this service right now at this audience and they're got to go to school also. We want them to know that we're going to be praying for them as well. And there are those in other countries. I have a an email this morning from brother Murphy and there's uh one or two students in China and there are others that would love to be in the in the school here they would have to get visas and the one girl she's about 15 years old there may be two of them they are uh awaiting a visa right now to be able to come to attend the school here and we have a place for them to today. Uh we're we're thankful for that. There are others there would like to perhaps have their own uh uh school because he said the school system even in China. He said it's just vile. It's filled with immorality. &gt;&gt; And the and the believers who have come to know Christ are having such a difficult time giving their children into that atmosphere. We need to pray. friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we ever prayed, we need to pray. And so, we're we're so thankful for everyone that has labored the way that you have and and worked. Incidentally, if you would remember, continue to remember Brother Murphy if you would please. And remember brother Kim who is he left here very wearied and he's in India. He's been going almost non-stop because there's things for him to do in the middle of the night there because it's daytime here. So he's up in the nighttime communicating with the those and brother Ben I suppose and different ones because of we're trying to get things finished up. Uh and I think that we ought to make a real effort target to have this school finished as early and as soon as possible. So we're pulling out the stops for that. Um and we're just happy for everyone that is present today. Uh, now we're going to go to the word. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what you all been waiting for? &gt;&gt; But I'd like to pray with the children and the parents if you'll stand with me. Uh, I wonder if we could sing I'm amazed that he loved me. I'm amazed that he cared. you know sometimes it's difficult for us to really grasp how much he cares. Uh there was only only certain times and certain things would happen in our home when I was a child and I wasn't with my mother and father very much. But there were times when it it it became very evident that they cared and they cared a whole lot more than I realized it and they were concerned. And then when I looked back, then I saw, you know, they always fed me, always cared, always took me to church, and I know they prayed. And we have a heavenly father. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're not mindful that he cares. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; I'm amazed. I'm amazed. Let's sing it together. I believe that I preless blood I found my s are all They're all washed away. All I see are wash away once again. Heat. Heat. that you love I found and my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. going to ask this assembly to say, I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that he loves me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that he cares. &gt;&gt; I believe that you love me. Yes, I believe that you [Music] are all I all the way. Oh, let's just bow our heads before him. Heavenly Father, you are our father. Mighty God, almighty God, filling all time and space completely goes beyond the boundaries of our mental capacity. But we believe. We do not understand all things. But we believe everything you have spoken. &gt;&gt; We believe your word that you have sent. We believe in the almighty power, oh God, of your promises. And today, Father, as we are mindful of the children, some just starting the school system, others in another grade and in the high school, and some going into further education. Lord, I pray that the Holy Spirit will now just settle down upon all of the students through this congregation throughout those that are out in other countries, Lord, that are streaming this service. May your Holy Spirit, divine presence settle down in the room as you will in the sanctuary, oh God. And I pray that in the classrooms as our teachers father and our brother Ticatch as a principal, I pray that the Holy Spirit will reign supreme in every classroom in every time they assemble together. And I pray when difficulties arise that they will have wisdom. And may the wisdom not be of a human source, but may it be a divine source that comes from the spirit of God. May they have access to the gift of wisdom and the gift of the word and knowledge and all of the things that are needful, Father. And may they never be ashamed to bow their head and have a time of prayer when a need arises, oh God. Keep the students, I pray, in good health, oh God. And may they complete this year with the glory of God upon them. And now as we're gathered here in this sanctuary and your word is laying open before us, Lord, it needs to be more than just an open book, but may it be a revealed book. I pray you will reveal those things that are needful to us in the name of Jesus Christ and strengthen us for the journey. Oh God, we do not know what tomorrow holds, but we know that you hold all time and space in your hand. And I pray, Father, you will anoint both speaker and hearers. Anoint each minister, oh God. Anoint the deacons, the trustees, and all who serve you. For we are here as your children and as your servants. In Jesus Christ's name, be glorified. Amen. Amen. I'll invite you to turn your Bibles, please. We're going to read out of Ephesians the first chapter and we'll start with verse 9. Thank you musicians. Ephesians 1 vers9, having made known unto us, please notice the first ver, first line, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one &gt;&gt; all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, to whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the gospel of your salv the the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the third verse as I read it again carefully and slowly. in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the word of truth, &gt;&gt; the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that ye believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. And I'm going to read also which I've read I believe last week John the 16th chapter verses 1213 and 14. Just notice the theme here. Jesus speaking. I have yet many things to say unto you. You see, these are the things which were being spoken by the apostles and by the disciples and still being spoken. These are things which have been spoken in the message. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I have yet many things to say to you." He had to use Paul. He had to use the apostles. He had to use the messengers. He had to use the prophet of this day to say those things. I have yet many things to say unto you, and but you cannot bear them now. How be it, when when he, the Spirit of truth, is come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he will not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he shall show you things to come. &gt;&gt; He shall glorify me. In other words, when the spirit comes, the spirit doesn't say spirit, spirit, spirit. The spirit says word, word, word. &gt;&gt; And the whole Pentecostal movement and many many of the charismatics and everything is just spirit this spirit spirit. Oh, we feel the spirit. No, when the spirit comes, he will just say word word &gt;&gt; word word word. &gt;&gt; He will glor He won't glorify himself. He will speak of me. For he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. How can we know what is truth? &gt;&gt; You've heard a lot of things this week. &gt;&gt; Yes. How do you know it's true? How do we define truth? You've heard all kinds of chatter and conversation pass back and forth. During the camp, just at the end of our family camp, a brother got a phone call, a minister got a phone call from one of his deacons said, "Brother Perry Green has cancer in both lungs and just has uh just very short time to live as a deacon, to a pastor, and to me and I got on the phone. I called brother Randy who was in California and I know that Randy is close to some members of the family. I said, "Brother Randy, I just heard this before it goes anywhere. I want it confirmed." And in a few moments, he said, "I'll call you back within five minutes." He called me back within about five minutes. She said, "I just spoke to one of the green girls, the daughters." Said, "There's no truth to it at all." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Wasn't that there was cancer in one lung. Wasn't that there was, you know, that it's not cancer, but it's something else. They said, "Father's fine. He's got some challenges, but he's fine." &gt;&gt; Now, how do you figure that one out? Oh, you know what? You hear things and it sounds it's so correct. It's so authoritative. &gt;&gt; It's so the even the chain the channel of it is so everybody and you and you and brother Brandham preached. I want you to be able to go home and listen to some messages presuming &gt;&gt; and they presumed it was correct. They presumed that God was in it &gt;&gt; and and God wasn't in it &gt;&gt; and it's so it sounds so correct. So right I got it from it's such an authorative v voice. &gt;&gt; How can you do better from a deacon to his own pastor, from the pastor to me? From me and I'm happy to tell you there's no truth to it. How do we know what is truth? &gt;&gt; Especially when it comes to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; It's not just gifted men. &gt;&gt; It's not someone who sounds and has the uh persona of being authorative and knows what he's he's well spoken, well read, wellstudied. That doesn't do it. &gt;&gt; It's critical. You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free. &gt;&gt; And a lot of people have all kinds of religiosity or they hear things or things quoted from the scripture but yet it hasn't set them free. You might be sitting here &gt;&gt; and I want to at least give you a basis &gt;&gt; on which this isn't from brother Ed Briscoll. This isn't from a Bible school. This isn't from any special uh you know human learning &gt;&gt; but I that's why I am so absolutely given over to what God vindicates &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; that that some power beyond my understanding &gt;&gt; some force some person a being &gt;&gt; who we call God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When he reaches through from the realm of the unseen, &gt;&gt; and comes amongst men, &gt;&gt; comes amongst women, comes into a congregation and uses a vessel and confirms this is truth. &gt;&gt; Then you can settle back and rest and say, "My confidence &gt;&gt; is in that God. &gt;&gt; I may not understand everything that's happening, But I understand one thing. I have enough intelligence to know this is not a man. &gt;&gt; This is not human intelligence. &gt;&gt; This isn't man or woman's doing. This isn't some system doing this. This is someone who I I can't even fully grasp. But he has stepped through from his realm into my dimension and proven this is the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the one who he's using calls it vindication, then I will call it vindication. &gt;&gt; I went to church all my life. I have never ever heard the word vindication or vindicated in reference to the ministry till I came to the message. &gt;&gt; And in the message, the prophet uses vindicate, vindicated, vindication about just under 2,000 times. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1760 times &gt;&gt; and he speaks of it and I will be making reference to it because this congregation and all who hear my voice today wants to understand one thing. I my faith is anchored in that which God has vindicated &gt;&gt; and which that vessel has spoken. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if I find anybody or I'm speaking to anyone and they kind of start to fluff around and they're not just that and say, "Well, the messenger has said this and well, you know, that's where we part ways. &gt;&gt; That's where we part ways because my confidence can only rest there &gt;&gt; because I have come to the conclusion that is God. &gt;&gt; No one else can do that. That is God. That's God's intelligence. &gt;&gt; That's God's doing. I may not know why he did it that way, but he did it that way. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How can we identify the truth of a slide? Hope All right. I don't don't read this real fast, please. The book is absolutely sealed. I was speaking about the seals until the seven seals is broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is sealed up with seven seals. Now, that's different from the seven thunders. This is seven seals upon the book. And the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel. So now so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding in that sounding and conjunction word vindicated truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will be made the the genuine revelation of God. The revelation will be made perfect in the sounding. &gt;&gt; So it'll be a voice &gt;&gt; and the vindicated truth &gt;&gt; or the proven truth, &gt;&gt; the confirmed truth. So if you put the a sounding and the confirmed truth, because now here's what the messenger also said. Brother Brandham said, "If the sign doesn't have a voice that follows, &gt;&gt; if it doesn't have a voice that follows, don't you pay any attention to it." &gt;&gt; So, there can be all kinds of signs and things that perhaps we can't uh we can't uh declare or we can't fully understand. There can be signs of, you know, people in the world show signs and show phenomena. So we're not, our faith is not in phenomena. &gt;&gt; Our faith is in a combination. It's in a revelation &gt;&gt; that comes by a voice &gt;&gt; and a vindicated truth. &gt;&gt; So we see God come and confirm &gt;&gt; something spoken. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And then and then it reveals something. &gt;&gt; Well, then we have confidence. what is revealed is is true. It is correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The vindicated truth. &gt;&gt; Now he said, now that's exactly what the word said. The mysteries should be finished at that time. &gt;&gt; And this seven sealed book, remember it was closed here in Revelation 5. I just added this in. And uh and in Revelation 10th chapter it is opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get into that because that's a whole message in itself. Presuming, we're not speaking about presuming. I want to speak on vindication. But presuming is to accept that something is almost certain to be correct even though there is no proof of it &gt;&gt; on the grounds that it is extremely likely. Now in the message in one of the message presuming they the people of Israel came to Moses and there was a certain king a certain nation that they felt and and they knew that they should defeat them and it was part of their journey. So they said to Moses, "Should we go up against them?" And Moses said, "Thou shalt not go up." And Moses had his reasons for saying, "You shall not go up." But the people themselves decided that this is the plan of God. And so they presumed, and he he uses that they presumed that God was with them. And they went up and were utterly defeated. And they found out at a huge cost to themselves, God wasn't with them. &gt;&gt; Well, how could they have avoided that? All they had to do is identify who was the vindicated voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if they'd identified it, who was the vindicated voice and said, "Even though it looks to me like God's will, &gt;&gt; it looks to me as though God's in it and I have all these other reasons to believe that I'm almost certain it's correct. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. &gt;&gt; That isn't sufficient to do it." &gt;&gt; We want to have a vindicated voice that confirms that we are right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How be it, when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into how much? &gt;&gt; A ll all truth. &gt;&gt; For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you things to come. So now that is presuming. What does vindication mean? I'm just done with the slides now for a while. You can turn the lights back up, please. What does vindication mean to the message believers? What does it mean to us? Why do we have we have a prophet of God who we have such implicit confidence in &gt;&gt; and he is using this from so many different times and different ways and all through his ministry. What should that mean to us? And that is God proves or vindicates his servants with the supernatural. That's the short part of it. That's what vindication means to us. &gt;&gt; I'll give you the meaning in a few moments. It is some supernatural things can be explained away. Now I said that it is a supernatural vindication is something supernatural confirming that this is a true statement or this is a true something that we should believe in. But now you can have something that is supernatural and explained away. The life of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Whoever had a more spiritual life, they explained him away. He's a carpenter's son. He They even thought he's the son of Joseph, which he wasn't. &gt;&gt; So they explained his life. They explained his death away. &gt;&gt; They explained his burial &gt;&gt; and his resurrection. Even though there was he was seen after his passion with above 500 brethren. So it wasn't just Jesus who couldn't convince him. It was 500 brethren couldn't convince us &gt;&gt; that this was spiritual and there was some conniving done and some money that was paid and say that his body was stolen and believe it or not even that is believed to this day. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; I sat with Muslims and they told me that they believed and what they held to was that the disciples of Jesus loved him so much that they didn't want to see him uh didn't want to see him die. So they took him from the cross before he died and he didn't have to die the death. And I said, "Well, that was very nice. I this man was a vice president of British Petroleum. I was sitting with him in Morocco and I said to him, "That's very nice that you feel that way about Jesus." But I said, "If Jesus Christ was not the son of God," because they don't believe he was the son of God in that sense of the word. I said, "Regardless of how righteous a man you may be," this was my answer to him. "Regardless of how holy and righteous you might be, I said, if you died, could you die, could you die for me and give me any time in eternal life?" "Oh, no, no, no," he said. I said, "That's right." I said, "And regardless of how righteous a person I might be," I said, "If I died on your behalf, my death would not give you even a moment's time of eternal life." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Exact." I said, "Sir," I said, "This is my these are my daughters and my wife. I've committed them to that Jesus Christ was the son of God and through his death and his resurrection he has forgiven our sins and we have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And I said if that if Jesus Christ did not die on Calvary I said we all in this room are lost &gt;&gt; completely lost. Right. &gt;&gt; And this man, as wise a man and as smart a man, as a wealthy a man as he is, he said, "That's very interesting. I have never heard it presented that way." And that was what we left him with. He went home thinking on those things. I trust he found Christ. &gt;&gt; I don't know. But if that was not the son of God. And so here's here's over a billion uh Muslim people who believe that the disciples love Jesus too much. It's very nice. But there's no eternal life to it. &gt;&gt; It was enough that the woman at the well it it was by some standards it would be enough for them for the people to say, "Well, she believes you're a prophet." That was a compliment. That wasn't enough. That was you're a prophet. That was partly true &gt;&gt; and I'm going to come to that also. Partial truth is not truth &gt;&gt; because partial truth invariably has something added to it. &gt;&gt; People say, "I believe William Brown's a prophet of God." That's fine. That is true. But what else do you believe? and what else is added to it may well invalidate your first claim. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to be going into it in some in some depth. The message and believers are being explained away today. The same spirit hasn't died. The same thing that explained the death of Jesus away, the resurrection of him away, they've managed to explain the apostles away, they've explained the gospel away, and they explain the messenger today. Oh, they say all kind of I mean I I wouldn't encourage you to do that, but the things that have been printed about brother Brandham, the things that have been said about him, and he said it himself, he's they take him all the way from being God to being a devil. &gt;&gt; If they said this about the messenger, and if they said those things about Jesus, are we going to get off any easier? Come on. &gt;&gt; No, we're going to be whatever. And we all we want to be undeterred &gt;&gt; in our conviction, in our confession of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And listen, friends, we may have escaped some of the reproach, but it may well be we escaped it because we haven't been as fervent and as forward as we must be about our declaration. &gt;&gt; Amen. People have said to me and I' I've faced this many times. Well, if you say, are you saying if I don't believe this message, I'm going to hell. I said, I will tell you this that this message is the call to the rapture. &gt;&gt; And if this is the call to the rapture, you put yourself where you want to. &gt;&gt; How can you be in it if you refuse the very call to the rapture? Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm not putting anybody in hell. That's not my job. &gt;&gt; My job is to say this is the way. &gt;&gt; And I'd recommend that to anybody. Let them answer where they're at. &gt;&gt; You tell me where you're at. &gt;&gt; I can show you in the scripture. There was to be a messenger. This is the messenger. This messenger was supposed to do certain things. He did certain things. And the mysteries of the word of God were supposed to re be revealed. And listen, all kinds of people have opened up the seven seals, &gt;&gt; but nobody opened up the seven seals except this one that had the vindication &gt;&gt; where the great eternal one &gt;&gt; from beyond the curtain of time reached through &gt;&gt; and confirmed unequivocally. &gt;&gt; This is not a man speaking. This is me speaking. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Think he did all of that so that we could sit here and say, "I have good reason." Not just good reason to presume it's right. I can say with authority according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; This Holy Spirit has led us into all truth. &gt;&gt; I may not understand all truth. We don't understand all. We don't understand everything that happens. But I know that this leadership is correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Vindicated truth. I tried to put it down in a phrase. Vindicated truth is a body of thought or events. a body of thought or events that are proven correct or true by the power of God coming from the unseen realm and confirms by bringing to pass what has been spoken or foretold. &gt;&gt; I gave that a lot of thought because that's out of my own heart. That's why I believe it. I had to answer to myself. I have to answer not only to myself. have to answer on behalf of those that I'm responsible for. That's why I believe the message &gt;&gt; and that's what vindication is to me. The there's a whole body of thought. There's a whole message. We call it the message. It that's a whole body of thought &gt;&gt; and there's all kinds of thought. I mean contrary thought to what other people have said. We're contrary especially on the trinity. &gt;&gt; It's anathema. what we believe is just anathema to the religious world. They just cast William Brham and the whole allamists they call them and they just cast them to the earth because they don't believe the trinity horrors. &gt;&gt; Well, we're in good company. Neither does God believe in the trinity. &gt;&gt; And ask them to find the trinity. They'll say it's a mystery. And my answer to that is it's a mystery to you, but it's not a mystery to me. &gt;&gt; God has manifested himself as the father. Manifest himself as the son. Manifest himself as the spirit. And the spirit of truth simply is the light of the truth. &gt;&gt; The spirit is the life sir. When this child we just dedicated was born, when he just first issued out of the womb, the spirit had to come in before there was life. If not, it was still born. &gt;&gt; We're not a bunch of stillborns. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit who wrote this word has come to the message you have believed and gives it life. &gt;&gt; And when it gives it life, what kind of life? not uh you know Michelangelo's life or some preacher's life but it's the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Now the spirit of God has moved don't don't lose my thought now. I'll just hang right on to that. The spirit of God has moved or brooded. Brother Brham uses the word brooded, which is as a hen will brood over her chicks or brood over the eggs she's sitting on. He brooded over the earth at different appointed times &gt;&gt; to bring forth life according to the plan &gt;&gt; that he had in his mind for that season. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Genesis 1:2, "And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep." I would say something had to happen. &gt;&gt; And he said, and it says, "And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, he he describes that. He says, "And there was a time when the world was laying in darkness and utter darkness. It was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere. And the spirit of God moved upon the water and said, "Let there be light. No, slide three. I want to start partway down. God had a reason to do that. God had a reason for saying, "Let there be light." He had a reason for doing that. For down beneath that water, &gt;&gt; there was seeds that he had planted &gt;&gt; and it had to have that sunlight to make it live. &gt;&gt; The first light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And there was light. And that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And that spirit of God, I'll just connect it real quickly. That spirit of God moved on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; A rushing mighty wind. &gt;&gt; Why? God was God's not just into just making a a rushing wind and making a sound. That's not the purpose. He moved. And where did he move? He moved over &gt;&gt; where there was some seeds. &gt;&gt; 120 seeds. &gt;&gt; Who had heard the spoken word, &gt;&gt; go ye to Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and Terry. &gt;&gt; And those words, those seed words had come down into this earth. &gt;&gt; And it was hidden down in this earth. And this earth didn't even know what was going to happen &gt;&gt; until the spirit of God came and brooded over them. &gt;&gt; And life camel. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Life came. &gt;&gt; And the life that came when the people saw it, they said, "These people must have been with Jesus." Amen. &gt;&gt; One of the darkest times, go to the church age book and put up the seven church ages. And the last one has just a little sliver of light. Brother Brandham actually says he put that sliver of light there. But Leodysia goes out into complete darkness. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. You sitting in a nice church, you're going to sit in a nice car, you got gas in the tank, you're going to drive home. That doesn't mean anything. This is a dark dark. &gt;&gt; This is without light. This generation &gt;&gt; in fact is when I see the level and the depth of the uh the the decrepit condition that men and women have come to. And you you see it everywhere. I marvel how God has spared this country. &gt;&gt; How God has spared the earth. &gt;&gt; It's going to come to a full destruction. &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God, a vindicated prophet, said God's going to burn it up. &gt;&gt; He's going to renovate it &gt;&gt; and make it a fit place for a holy God &gt;&gt; and a holy people. Does this congregation believe that? Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And in this generation, as dark as it is, as corrupted as it is, truth, to find truth in this day, &gt;&gt; is a miracle in itself. &gt;&gt; If God didn't bring truth to you, you could never find it. &gt;&gt; And that's why some of you have spent a good part of your life searching it here and searching it there. and you've been in this church and that church, you've been in the world. You've listened to this philosophy and all of these things and weren't able to find the truth because it's not there. &gt;&gt; Oh, you heard you heard parts of truth, &gt;&gt; but that is not the truth I'm speaking about this morning. &gt;&gt; And some are going to get the idea, well, you feel very confident. You feel overconfident. You feel uh almost on the point of being arrogant. No, we're not arrogant, &gt;&gt; but we have to be absolutely certain &gt;&gt; that this that we believe is truth. &gt;&gt; Why do we believe it? It was vindicated &gt;&gt; and I didn't produce the vindication. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I might say, I understand this that's being said, but I have no and no one here and no human can say we confirmed it. That's right. &gt;&gt; You didn't confirm it. God confirmed it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to just go back and listen to a message, go back and choose any message you want where there's a a a prayer line on the end or a healing line on the end and just listen to it and ask yourself who's doing that. &gt;&gt; And once you decide who's doing it, then whoever that is, you better you better sell out to it. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; And I say you'll be giving yourself out to God Almighty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who can understand God? Who can understand this God? &gt;&gt; There were seeds that were planted and God had planted certain seeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That were going to come up in this generation &gt;&gt; in a different time. &gt;&gt; We just dedicated a little fellow Jesse Oed. And not too many years before that, his mother and dad were just seeds. And all of us that were here, we were just seeds. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. &gt;&gt; You were just seed &gt;&gt; lodged in your mother's womb. &gt;&gt; And almighty God allowed conception. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't the first one from the man to the woman's egg that bumped into. Maybe he said the prophet says they watching it in artificial incimination. There's millions of them in there and they moving everybody moving and the sperm is the germ is hitting this one and that one and moving on and finally he said it might be right at the back wall. Might it be at the very and it'll hit that one and conception takes place. The color of your hair, the color of your eyes, everything about you, your nature, everything is there &gt;&gt; and it comes forth. Who did that? &gt;&gt; Who made that choice? &gt;&gt; God planted certain ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The rest has just been flesh. &gt;&gt; And this might be hard to say, but he used one term, atomic f &gt;&gt; and people withdraw from that. Oh, a terrible thing to say. Well, what about the graveyard? Go to the graveyard. &gt;&gt; How many of them are in heaven? Everybody likes to think it's all in heaven. &gt;&gt; Don't be deceived, friends. &gt;&gt; It's not heaven. &gt;&gt; You don't want to think about hell. Jesus spoke more about hell than he spoke about heaven. &gt;&gt; And we are to make our calling and election cure. &gt;&gt; We're not going on a gravy bed. We're not going on a rose bed of ease. We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; The battle of the right against wrong. &gt;&gt; The truth against untruth. &gt;&gt; How do we know what's true? How do you know what to fight for? How do you know what to stand for? &gt;&gt; It's not a church. &gt;&gt; The church is on every corner. It's got to be something that's happened inside &gt;&gt; that the spirit of truth &gt;&gt; has come into you &gt;&gt; and is confirming and making known the truth of God's word. So in the beginning, the spirit of God moved over the face of the waters because there were seeds down there. In the message, turn on the light. He said God knew that he had need of light. &gt;&gt; His seed was already in the earth because he had planted it there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he needed light to bring forth that seed &gt;&gt; to make that seed live because the seed was already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen now. I've highlighted this red and yellow. The only thing he needs, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; is the manifestation of the light of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something to manifest the manifestation of the light of God upon the scripture &gt;&gt; to make it live &gt;&gt; for that age. Amen. &gt;&gt; And thus when the messenger when brother Brandham's ministry was sent out onto the earth, it was to manifest. And the manifestation made this word live. And that manifestation was light. &gt;&gt; And others saw it. And that and that light gave life to what was in them &gt;&gt; and said that's true. for the promise of the day. Then God planted one in his likeness &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden. From Adam, he made Eve. Just follow the story, please. We see them as the masterpiece family, God calls them, in the Garden of Eden. And while God rested, his enemy crawled under the garden walls. Brother Brandham says to his masterpiece, "His enemy crawls under the garden walls and marred and caused that beautiful family to fall." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But the great sculptor, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; wasn't willing just to leave his masterpiece, lay there in ruin. &gt;&gt; He went to work immediately &gt;&gt; to build it up again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And over the centuries of time, &gt;&gt; finally one came the perfect one, &gt;&gt; the masterpiece himself. &gt;&gt; At last I quote now at last. Coming up through that finally comes the masterpiece. He called it the perfect one. &gt;&gt; No fault in him at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So perfect reflected the builder himself. Yes. &gt;&gt; His own image was reflected in his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God and Christ were one in so much until he put his own spirit into him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The builder put his own spirit into the image. &gt;&gt; And then even the image and the builder became one. God and his sculpture work. His masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this masterpiece &gt;&gt; full of grace, &gt;&gt; full of truth, &gt;&gt; the first one that came up to full maturity. &gt;&gt; A ripe grain &gt;&gt; and according to the Old Testament in the scripture, the first ripe grain that is to come up is to be cut down. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so God speaking to Moses said, "Speak to the children of Israel and say unto them, when you come into your land, in other words, when you come to maturity, &gt;&gt; which I give unto you, you shall reap the harvest thereof, and then you shall bring a sheep of the first fruits, &gt;&gt; of your harvest, &gt;&gt; to the priest." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to the prophet. No, &gt;&gt; you don't bring this to Moses. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you bring this to the priest &gt;&gt; because this was a perfect perfect reflection of what was going to happen in the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because when he was on earth, &gt;&gt; he was the God prophet &gt;&gt; and he filled out his pro life as a prophet. Then he died and shed his blood and ascended with his own blood because only the priest took the blood in &gt;&gt; to the holy of holies and he ascended to the very throne of God &gt;&gt; to as a declaration. &gt;&gt; The price has been paid. &gt;&gt; Death is defeated. &gt;&gt; In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. But now the power of death was broken. And he was the first ripe chief. &gt;&gt; And the prophet, oh read the rising of the sun. Listen to it. And the prophet said, the priest, you take this chief to the priest &gt;&gt; because now he had become priest &gt;&gt; and he was waved over the people &gt;&gt; and it was a memorial. The priest waved it. Not the prophet, but the priest waved it. And so as Jesus entered his priesthood, he waved the sheath &gt;&gt; over the people &gt;&gt; over the seed &gt;&gt; because it was a declaration, there are more like me in the field. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It was a memorial to God. Father, the plan, your thoughts, they're true. There's more like me in the field. Hallelujah. And they shall rise like I have risen. &gt;&gt; They will conquer death as I have conquered death. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, saints? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't have time. And I love to be able to take time and let you know brother Brandham's ministry &gt;&gt; spread even beyond &gt;&gt; prophet sir &gt;&gt; because the word that came out of his mouth &gt;&gt; was the winding up of the priesthood. [Music] &gt;&gt; He was the prophet. Moses was the prophet. His brother was the priest. Yes. &gt;&gt; William Brandon was the prophet. &gt;&gt; But what came out of his mouth was Christ. &gt;&gt; The word was Christ. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And again today, he's waved over the people." [Applause] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a prophet waved over the people. It was the word. And I'm telling you today, maybe you never heard it before, but the word is still being waved over the people as a memorial to God. There's more like me in the field. &gt;&gt; Jesus people, &gt;&gt; Jesus children, &gt;&gt; family of God. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You won't hear this in the Baptist or Pentecostal church. &gt;&gt; We believe it. We believe it because this entire message, &gt;&gt; it is the rising of the sun. Not is it the rising of the sun, it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said he's and he shall wave it over the he shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On the tomorrow &gt;&gt; after the Sabbath &gt;&gt; when the when the priest went in and waved the sheath, there's just a sheath that grew out of the earth. &gt;&gt; But here the people were standing there. Their bodies came out of the earth, too. And their bodies, they're going to die and they're going to be buried back in the earth. and dust is going to go to dust. &gt;&gt; There is no hope. There's no hope there sexual birth. I don't care who you are. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of thought you have. I'm not interested in human thought. I'm interested in what God has said. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in what a prophet has spoken. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said this when it's waved, &gt;&gt; it's a memorial to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that there's more &gt;&gt; like him &gt;&gt; that are still in the field. &gt;&gt; They've got to come forth. You had to come forth. &gt;&gt; And you came forth in a very, very dark, dismal time. You talk about a chaotic time. You came forth in an age when there is no answers. &gt;&gt; The wisest men on earth are seeking answers. economic answers, unrest, answers, riots, answers for riots, answers for health, answers for youth, answers for all kinds of things. Police are looking for answers. The criminologists are looking for, everybody's looking for answers. &gt;&gt; All kinds of counselors seeking answers. There is no answer &gt;&gt; outside of the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying there's no help. There can be help, but the kind of help you as a son and daughter of God need is truth. &gt;&gt; Absolute truth. &gt;&gt; Vindicated truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there isn't two vindicated truths. &gt;&gt; There isn't two. So, I'm going to get bring it down till it squeaks &gt;&gt; and then it'll be on your lap to make your decision. I'm telling you where I'm at. In the rising of the sun, he said it was the first corn of God's wheat. &gt;&gt; You listen, this is not just a quote. This is words &gt;&gt; of God's vindicated prophet voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And right after he would speak, how many times he would say, &gt;&gt; "Now I'm call him on the scene. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come and prove, &gt;&gt; prove is another word for vindicate. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't prove what I've spoken is the truth, &gt;&gt; the truth, &gt;&gt; then forget it. &gt;&gt; Did he ever fail?" There's not one time that you'll ever find that this mighty God failed to come on the scene and prove it was the supernatural. &gt;&gt; That being that here was not him. It was Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's the only Christ that you'll ever sense and feel. &gt;&gt; He's in another realm. He's in another dimension. You cannot possibly get closer to him than to believe the words that he spoke through that veil. &gt;&gt; That's the closest you'll ever get to God &gt;&gt; till you pass off of this scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'd been raised from the dead, &gt;&gt; God's first corn of wheat &gt;&gt; by God's quickening power. &gt;&gt; He was the first fruit of those that slept. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's many that slept, but he was the first fruits of those that slept. &gt;&gt; He was that she &gt;&gt; That's why they had to wave that sheath &gt;&gt; for it was the first one &gt;&gt; that came to maturity. &gt;&gt; And it was waved as a memorial of thanksgiving to God, &gt;&gt; believing, believing that the rest of them would come. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, someone believed for you before you have arrived. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Even back in the Old Testament, that priest was just waving a a live sheath of wheat that came up. But that even in that waving was on your behalf &gt;&gt; because he believed as a memorial the rest of them would come. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I rejoice. &gt;&gt; I rejoice. And you ought to be rejoice. Say, "Lord, here I am." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've arrived. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was a sign. And today, because he was the first son of God to come to full maturity to be in God, he was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was waved over just another place quickly. He was waved over the promised seed &gt;&gt; that had the promise of life. &gt;&gt; He was waved over the promised seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know this message? Let me put it into terms that you can understand. &gt;&gt; This message was being preached. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it went into space because the words are never lost. &gt;&gt; And the spa and the and the space that is here right this minute, &gt;&gt; right in this room is voices. &gt;&gt; And the voices never die. &gt;&gt; They just keep on going. &gt;&gt; Don't consider me a fanatic. Through this room is going Brother's voice. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want to be sure I'm saying what he said &gt;&gt; because what he said was vindicated by almighty God. Through this voice is going cursing and damning and words of devils and doctrines of devils and all kinds of things through this room is going man's ideas all kinds of conver business and all kinds of political conversation going through this room. But going through this room is the voice of God's confirmed vindicated messenger. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What is it doing? It's being waved. over the sea. &gt;&gt; And there's people here raising up and saying, "I believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I believe that voice." &gt;&gt; Dust thou believe? &gt;&gt; You young men believe. &gt;&gt; You young ladies believe. This congregation believes &gt;&gt; out on the internet. Do you believe &gt;&gt; the voice &gt;&gt; from heaven &gt;&gt; is here &gt;&gt; glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's here to wash you &gt;&gt; if you need to be washed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's here to deliver you &gt;&gt; if you need to be delivered. It's here to heal you if you need to be healed. &gt;&gt; The voice of God coming through the room. I am the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; It's not just some nice song. I believe that Jesus &gt;&gt; loves me. &gt;&gt; That's a nice thought. It's not some poetry. It's something that agrees with this &gt;&gt; and disagrees. Just think of it. I got a Bible here, but I got a voice going through the room &gt;&gt; that God confirmed in this Bible. &gt;&gt; This Bible spoke about seven seals. I got a voice going through here saying the seals are open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, why wouldn't we believe that voice? [Music] And the prophet says on the other side, it's not at the judgment, you will hear your own voice. &gt;&gt; It says, "And let me hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to remind people what they said. It will be replayed &gt;&gt; because God created a dimension to hold your voice. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We be careful what we say &gt;&gt; and all these partial truths &gt;&gt; which I'm going to come to in a few moments. &gt;&gt; Help me as I get through this service. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks about the coming of the Holy Ghost in this last days. &gt;&gt; And in the message, who is this? &gt;&gt; Says coming up over the hill was a little donkey. A little donkey. Nobody paid any attention to him. &gt;&gt; Think of this. the creator of heavens and earth coming in a humble way on a donkey and nobody paid any attention to him. Why? Because it's just another donkey &gt;&gt; with another man. &gt;&gt; It may be just another church, another group of people, but there's a big difference to God. those that are his seed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Nobody paid attention to him, but those who are looking for him." &gt;&gt; I hope you didn't come to this service this morning expecting to hear a sermon. I want you to be looking for him. He says they cut down branches and they ran screaming hosana to the son of David that comes in the name of the Lord. He said he said something had to take place. &gt;&gt; I say this morning friends we can't just go on as you know we're here fellowshipping around the message. Something has to come take place &gt;&gt; because he who sat on the donkey's present he's come down. Something had to take place. &gt;&gt; He said the living Christ &gt;&gt; was amongst the living people. &gt;&gt; Something has to take place. &gt;&gt; You can sit beside someone else. You might sit right next to them. You might even be touching shoulders with them. And one is being quickened by the word that is being preached. Not just excited, quickened in the soul. And if you're not being quickened, you're the one that ought to get earnest. &gt;&gt; Got to say, Almighty God, &gt;&gt; you who sent this word, &gt;&gt; touch this soul of mine. &gt;&gt; Move me, brood over me. Bring forth life. Not my life, not the life of Edis or the life of you got from your natural birth, but the life of eternal &gt;&gt; guallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the coming of the Holy Ghost in this last days &gt;&gt; has caused has caused somewhat in like manner &gt;&gt; stir amongst the people of the coming of the Holy Ghost in these last days. He said a second time has sent forth a revival a people that's called out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When that ministry went around the world, they didn't realize it was the coming of the Holy Ghost in this generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say he has come. &gt;&gt; The world went on. They don't know anything about it. &gt;&gt; That doesn't change. Jesus has come. They didn't know anything about it. They went on with their lives and selling their wares. That didn't change God's plan. They could go on. The world will go on. You'll continue to go to your job. You'll continue to do your work, continue to pay your bills and all the rest of it, continue to come to church. But when you come to the house of God, I trust that your soul comes under the brooding &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; and you will listen to every servant of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "A people that's a called out, separated people, a people that's free in their religion." &gt;&gt; Amen. that shouts &gt;&gt; and screams &gt;&gt; and praises God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday as brother Tom was preaching and the Holy Spirit fell on you as a congregation and it was just like a waters of worship and praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And glory to God. I tell you what, that's not something that man does. &gt;&gt; If man does it, we don't need it. &gt;&gt; But when God does it, &gt;&gt; God does it because, you know, this message came and we're standing for a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; Don't ever get tired of the word vindicated. &gt;&gt; It is proven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You get into a court of law, they want to know that you were a witness and you saw certain things. You experienced certain things. My ears heard certain things and I know that that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Outside of that, you're disqualified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; And I guess I ought to know. &gt;&gt; I was there when Jesus saved me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was there when he revealed this word to me. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm forever thankful for I was able to sit on a log. Now I read this recently in a message where brother Brandon was criticized. Suppose he's I read it to you. Suppose he's going hunting again. This man said I suppose he's going hunting again up in Canada. Said yeah he did. Ah he said it's nonsense. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said I if that man called me to pray for him it wouldn't do any good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Imagine &gt;&gt; a man could have the privilege of having Elijah &gt;&gt; standing at his bedside &gt;&gt; praying for his healing or praying for his deliverance or praying for his problem. And he disqualified himself. &gt;&gt; And I read that and tears come to my eyes. He said, "I went there by vision." I said, "Oh God, I'm so glad you went there and waved this word over my soul. I had to sit on that log. &gt;&gt; He had to come north. &gt;&gt; But South had to come north. &gt;&gt; Sister Debbie had blessed me the other day when you called me over to your counter and we were just chatting and Sister Debbie said, "Oh," she laid her hand on a a disc, a DVD that had just been done. who just packaging it. He said, "I I just got a I just got a request for DVD of your testimony. I'm a witness and it comes from Rocky Southwick, &gt;&gt; Brother Southwick's second son." &gt;&gt; That's not an accident. &gt;&gt; I just pray God bless Rocky and Wanda, his wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; When they see that, their hearts will be stirred to remember. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was there and saw many of those things. You just don't know. The message continues to ripple out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Praise God." He went to the far reaches of the northern British Columbia. &gt;&gt; The called out, separated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People free from their religion. said, "The spirit of the living God lives in them." &gt;&gt; And that's why they cry out and that's why they can't hold their peace. That's why they can't hold their peace. &gt;&gt; There comes a time when you can't hold your peace any longer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't afraid. You won't scare me &gt;&gt; and you won't scare God. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, God's not deaf." Well, I'll tell you, you can't make him deaf either. &gt;&gt; You can't deafen him. &gt;&gt; I think God actually likes to see the smile in your face. &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, he said like the Pentecostals experience today &gt;&gt; and the coming of the Holy Ghost in these la in this last days &gt;&gt; was promised. It's like the abstract of a title deed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It struck off. It's like an abstract. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The abstract came, folks. &gt;&gt; The abstract came. &gt;&gt; The abstract is the only thing that can trace it back to the beginning &gt;&gt; and pay off any debt that's there. &gt;&gt; And give you an abstract that means free. &gt;&gt; God didn't give you an abstract with part of your sins hanging on there. We all were cheats or whatever more. An abstract is clear. It is. He said, remember Elijah's words now. Don't invent some other words. Struck off. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, you can get a little you can get a a title." Sure, you can get a title to a place, but that still don't say it's yours. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Somebody way back yonder could come in and put a claim on it. But when you get an abstract, that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off, &gt;&gt; plumb back to the foundation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We all are sinners. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; It's struck off. &gt;&gt; Plumb back to the beginning. And when a man has said, &gt;&gt; get this please real close. And when a man has said that he believes the word &gt;&gt; and then when the Holy Spirit comes, &gt;&gt; it is the abstract of the title. The Holy Spirit is the abstract of the title because it's the Holy Spirit. The spirit of God brooded over that body that was still in the tomb and he was raised. Jesus was raised. The spirit of God brooded over him. He was raised as a testimony that sin was destroyed. Sin was finished. He has the abstract. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes upon you and confirms the word that you've heard, you've heard the word and then &gt;&gt; and then the Holy Spirit comes, &gt;&gt; he holds the abstract &gt;&gt; and there's nothing. God wouldn't tolerate Satan to hold a claim on your life. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't stand for that. &gt;&gt; It's clear back to the beginning. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; When people think or begin to feel, &gt;&gt; I'm okay, &gt;&gt; just hold your nose cuz that stinks. It's filthy rags. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm all right. You know, I'm not doing too bad. &gt;&gt; That smells. &gt;&gt; It's a stench in God's nostrils. &gt;&gt; And God hates self-righteousness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. were sinners of the worst kind. &gt;&gt; That God has saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Quickly, I must hurry. And when a man believes the word and then when the Holy Spirit comes, it's the abstract &gt;&gt; that gives you permission. When you have that abstract, that every bit of that belongs to you and everything's on its bin belongs to you and it gives you an abstract. The Holy Ghost comes a whole paragraph on it if you wanted. It is also in the rising of the sun, but I don't have time. And only he who held the abstract was qualified to search against any claims. &gt;&gt; Only he who has the abstract. I haven't got the you or I. We don't have the right to search. &gt;&gt; We couldn't possibly search. &gt;&gt; If we're going to search, we'd have to search first our own. But the Holy Spirit is the only one who searches. &gt;&gt; All right. Have I got a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; There's a true and false to everything. &gt;&gt; There's an impersonation. If there's a person impersonation, there's got to be a truth somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I just look to check out and say, now those of you that have some building experience, there's a true square and there's a false square. Something that's true square has four sides. They're all equal. They can't just be equal. They be kind of skewed a wee bit, but they're equal and they're true square. And the true square is has to be a true 90 degrees at every corner. And then you have a true square. Brother Brandham talks about some true things. Can I just give you a list quickly? &gt;&gt; These are all true. A true, there's a true God. Soon as you say true, then you can say there's a false. &gt;&gt; A true God, a true angel of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. A true prophet, true apostle, &gt;&gt; true teacher, true pastor, &gt;&gt; true watchman, &gt;&gt; steward of God, a true messenger of God, true shepherd, true deacon, true disciples, man of God, true servant, true woman, a true believer, a true worshipper, a bride, a witness. I have to go quickly. A friend, a true friend. Right. &gt;&gt; You all figured you had friend, &gt;&gt; friend. Then you discovered something else. True friend, a true physician. There's a quack physician. &gt;&gt; There's a true fellowship, true oneness, a true message, a true voice, a true statement, a true gospel, a true baptism, &gt;&gt; a true sincere heart, a true gift of God, a true vision. There's false visions. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a true sound, true sign, true repentance, true testimony, confession, revelation, a true interpretation, a true conversion, &gt;&gt; a true experience, a true compass, a true gift, a true interpreter of that dream, a true fulllength surrendered heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A true vine, true assurance, a true Christian life. &gt;&gt; Amen. A true story, unadulterated faith, a true uh true church, a true seed of Abraham, &gt;&gt; true religion, &gt;&gt; spirit of God, a true branch, a true preacher's lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. A true born again sheep. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A true Bible teaching. A true cut diamond. A true Pentecost. A true report. True love. True token. True mark of God. A true road map &gt;&gt; to his power. &gt;&gt; I love that one. A true road map to his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True predestination. &gt;&gt; A true representation. A true stand. A true light. A true trial. And a true answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that wasn't even all of them. &gt;&gt; So now you see why I couldn't speak a whole subject on the truth. &gt;&gt; I was lost. I was swimming in the first few lines. Couldn't possibly get to it. So these are there are true and that is what is true and very very specific. We know that when you see a sign, he speaks of a true Bible sign. There's a true Bible voice behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now before I before I close, I want to nail it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the vindication in the angel of the Lord, I'm I'm abbreviating these. He said, "A man can say almost a man can say most anything." And I will admit that there's been much said in the name of the Lord. In the name of the Lord that is not of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming to partial truth and this really is the hub. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the core of my message. I've got to finish it very quickly. He found much has been said in the name of the Lord that is not of the Lord. But God would never testify or vindicate &gt;&gt; a lie. &gt;&gt; God will always vindicate the truth &gt;&gt; and never a lie. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; God is not an author of lies and confusion. He's the author of peace &gt;&gt; and truth and holiness and righteousness and peace. God always testifies of the truth. &gt;&gt; Now, to vindicate, please catch this. You're not too weary? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; To vindicate is to assert or to defend or to maintain. And this I want to dwell on a wee bit. To maintain successfully as correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. To vindicate is to confirm or to maintain to give give uh the confirmation that this is correct. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a preacher using as a as brother Brandham used vindication? If he doesn't vindicate it, it's false. &gt;&gt; Who says that? &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, you're not saying it." No, but I am saying that the truth that I believe &gt;&gt; wholeheartedly &gt;&gt; and completely &gt;&gt; and will preach from any and every part of it &gt;&gt; there's nothing in the message we wouldn't speak of. &gt;&gt; It is God's vindicated truth &gt;&gt; to us. Our faith is anchored in that. &gt;&gt; You might feel that I'm overdoing it. I don't feel I'm overdoing it. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. If you think I'm overdoing it, outside of it, you're totally at a drift. [Music] &gt;&gt; There is outside of that, you're completely a drift. You wouldn't you don't have any place to anchor your faith or your confession. [Music] &gt;&gt; To maintain successfully as correct. And then he stands and says, "Father, now vindicate &gt;&gt; what I've said as the truth &gt;&gt; or right." And to vindicate is to maintain as correct, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or just against accusation and reproach. &gt;&gt; And folks, listen to me &gt;&gt; closely. You can do all your other things and think about anything else but just abide for a few moments now. There is so much just horrific things spoken against this message, &gt;&gt; sickening things, &gt;&gt; things that are dark evil. &gt;&gt; I read some report and I just came across it accidentally. I was doing some search for the for the message this morning and I found someone was saying something about William Brandham. There's there's a fellow down here actually. He's down in uh Tanzania I think. What's that island off Australia? He's down there brother sister friend. He's down your area. I I'm glad he's there. Just keep him there. He's Muslim. He's a he's a white white fellow and he's Muslim. Talks all about Allah and so and so forth. He's the Messiah. He's the risen one. And gave his name. I had to search for his name because he's got all this, you know, high flutin kind of name. So I searched for his name and got his name and then I typed his name in with William Brham. Bingo. Sure enough. You know, they try to tie brother Brandham's name to everything and the most horrific, unbelievable stuff and garbage that you and I I begin to follow that out a wee bit and how he ever got linked to this guy. And then there are people that came out against him. Correct. But in so doing, they felt they needed to justify themselves and come against brother Brandham as well. and the things they spoke and one of the statements here's these guys so authorative and you might read down there and say well you know what that that sounds correct and people that read that I feel sorry for people who don't know and don't have the Holy Spirit of truth &gt;&gt; the spirit of truth &gt;&gt; will tell you inside right away that's a big lie And so I just read a little bit down. Excuse me for taking this time. I just read a little bit down. They said William Brham came out of northern Saskatchewan. Wow. Wouldn't the people in Jefferson Ind Indiana like to hear about this? So he come out of there out of a group called the Latter Rain. This fellow is so completely confused and mixed up he ought to go and start school all over again. He ought to learn what the basics of of writing. Before you write something, you want to be at least somewhere near the truth. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even anywhere near the truth. He's not in the right country. &gt;&gt; He's not He He's only on the right continent. &gt;&gt; He might as well throw a dart with a blindfold over his eyes and he'd be about as as correct as he is there. And then I went on and and another completely erroneous statement. I don't even I I just look at say, "Where in the world could he get it?" You know what? He never read a message. &gt;&gt; He never read a message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't give that up. Any message would have told him that wasn't right. &gt;&gt; So a person's going to write and blab it to the whole world. &gt;&gt; So this is something a new discovery. You're going to explain why it's a false prophet. And how many people believe it for one reason or another? You people that are seated here, I thank God &gt;&gt; I have a confidence in my heart &gt;&gt; that you are here because you believe &gt;&gt; that God spoke truth &gt;&gt; and now I'm encouraging you to believe all &gt;&gt; that he said. &gt;&gt; This is not a smorgus board where you choose what you like and leave what you don't like. It is a it's a it's we live by every &gt;&gt; word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Quickly, I must go because truth requires the spirit of truth to guide us into all truth. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us. But now in the fourth seal, &gt;&gt; he said, "Remember that the Bible says that in the last days, &gt;&gt; that this antichrist would deceive the whole world." &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to ask you people here or all that are on the internet or ever be streaming a service, are we in this world? &gt;&gt; Well, yes, we are. This messenger has said that the antichrist &gt;&gt; is going to deceive the whole world. &gt;&gt; No apologies from this end. I'm going to tell you clearly because I'll be responsible for these words one day. You are a candidate for either the truth &gt;&gt; or the antichrist. &gt;&gt; And I have to tell you, there is no in between ground. &gt;&gt; You're going to be persuaded by one or the other. &gt;&gt; How many of this congregation would agree with that? [Music] We are candidates. Every human is a candidate for one of those two &gt;&gt; friends. &gt;&gt; I say to you as a brother, as a friend, God, &gt;&gt; save us &gt;&gt; from the influence &gt;&gt; and the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the environment &gt;&gt; of the Antichrist. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And John said way back then, the antichrist, the spirit of antichrist is already here. &gt;&gt; So, how will God, how will a just God leave a people in the earth, his seed? Some of us will come maybe easier and some of us will come harder. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, we must not take this message lightly. &gt;&gt; The truth &gt;&gt; of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There'd only be a small number whose names were put on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. And when &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the true vindication of the revealed truth of God's word strikes that heart, &gt;&gt; he will strike the water. &gt;&gt; And out yonder with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; just as hard as he can. &gt;&gt; He doesn't let us say, "Well, you know, I think I'll try that." That's not it. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the vindicated, &gt;&gt; truth, &gt;&gt; the vindicated, &gt;&gt; confirmed truth &gt;&gt; of God's word, &gt;&gt; strikes the heart, &gt;&gt; he'll run out and hit the water as &gt;&gt; as hard as he can. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He said you can't stop him &gt;&gt; from doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to have a young fellow baptized. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tom's going to baptize one of his grandsons. &gt;&gt; You know how long we've been holding him back? How long? &gt;&gt; A long time. And he never would get off that thought. And he would bug his mom and dad and he he he it wasn't something it was he wanted today and then forget about it. Just all the time. I want to be baptized. when can I be baptized? They came to me. I said, "Well, he's small." And he said, "He's bothering us all the time. Week in week out, month in, month out, year in and year out. I want to be baptized." Finally, he found his place in the scripture because he became impertunite. His impertunity won. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yes, &gt;&gt; he's going to be baptized. When you see, if you can see his head over this, I doubt it, but when you see him being baptized, I'll tell you that is one happy boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's been asking for this for several years, brother Ernie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How old is he? &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Six years old. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Six. You say, "When should it be baptized?" Brother Bam said, "Wouldn't they ask?" &gt;&gt; If we'd have asked, I mean, he'd have been baptized long time ago. I said this to you and I'm closing with it. The biggest lie that was ever told, there was a whole lot of truth in it. Brother Brham said there was 95% truth in it &gt;&gt; from the beginning when Eve believed the lie. And then listen to this. in the confirmation of of of the commission and I want to read a few scriptures. &gt;&gt; He says now you know the biggest lie that was ever told there was a whole lot of truth in it. That is right. See that's if there wasn't truth in it people wouldn't be believing it. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of truth and stuff. &gt;&gt; So he said you remember the first lie was ever told was 95% truth. And when Satan told Eve in the Garden of Eden, all the things that God said, he admitted. So the things that were true, he said, "It's true. That's right. Everything that God said, he said, that's right." But he added, "Surely you'll not die." Then we come on into into Deuteronomy. Said, "You shall not" He said, "You shall not do all the things that you do here this day. Every man, here's what they were doing. Every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say to the congregation here, we're fine people, but if we only do what's right in our own eyes, it'll only be part truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Judges, in those days where there are no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. Proverbs, every man, every way of man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord ponderth the hearts. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to I I want to just hurry along here because uh there's a there's something I want you to read with me about this partial truth. What's part? He said, "And it's proven at thy word in the message at thy word and it's proven to be the truth." Then that settles it. And now God wouldn't let me tell you part truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone alert yet? &gt;&gt; I need you fully alert for what I'm going to read you. In fact, as many of you probably don't know, this exists in the message. I wouldn't tell you part truth and not the rest of it. He said he wouldn't stand for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fragments or partial truth. We're not interested in fragments, friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; When it comes to eternal things, when it comes to scriptural things, &gt;&gt; you want to be certain &gt;&gt; that it's all word. All word &gt;&gt; founded solely upon the word. &gt;&gt; And if there's a little twinge in your heart this morning, then I want you to listen real close. Now, watch this. Brother Brandham deals with something here in the Sardisian church age. He said if there ever if there was ever a time of denominational zeal it was in this tragic time. The words of Comminius described much of this era. Comminius wrote the and this was the title one thing needful. There's much you could search much on that. He compares the world to a labyrinth. You know what a labyrinth is? It's a whole maze. And how do we find our way out? He compares it to a labyrinth and shows that the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful, Christ. The great number of teachers, he says, is the reason of the multitudes of sects for which we shall soon have no names left. Each church reckons itself as the true one, or at least as the purest, truest part of it, while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred. No reconciliation is to be hoped for between them. They meet enmity with irreconcilable enmity out of the Bible. And stop there, please, and look this way. Out of the Bible. Out of the truth. &gt;&gt; Only truth. Out of the Bible they forge, they make, they construct their different creeds. These are their fortresses and bull works behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks. I will not say that these confessions of faith for we can admit in most cases that they are so are bad in themselves. In other words, the confessions of faith are different confessions of faith. Brother Brandham says they're not bad in themselves. They become so, however, in that they feed the fire of enmity &gt;&gt; only by putting them away alltogether. Everybody say that word allto together. That's why he said the one needless thing is to have Christ only Christ. And by putting away all this other all together would it be possible to set to work on healing the wounds of the church. I'm not even talking about denominationalism. I speak of the message now worldwide. The message, &gt;&gt; the message. All believers in the message ought to take and read and pray over and if necessary fast and wait on God until this becomes a reality. &gt;&gt; And Comminius was even ancient far &gt;&gt; long time ago. &gt;&gt; These things are true, friends. And to set at healing the wounds of the church, he said to this labyrinth of sex, sex and various confessions, another belongs the love of disputation. There's more. Everybody gets a a a wind of a doctrine or an idea. Hey, I'm spending valuable time and our resources on a large group of people that are have been scattered and have been injured and have been wounded. And those leaders that caused the wounding, they're long gone. But the people, dear people, sweet, wonderful people, they're seeking to take a hold of something that is solid or take a hold of something that's firm and move on in God. &gt;&gt; And I say, God bless them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they say he says in the labyrinth it says various confessions and another belongs the love of disputation. What is attained by it? The love of disputation. Well, I believe this with this is the way I see it. I need to send this out. I need to get this all over the world so that everybody believes it exactly the way I say it. Did the prophet say it exactly that way? You know, and I find that what people do now with with a search and all of these things, I can put this statement together, that one together, another one together, and then they come with a with an obvious with an obvious conclusion. And their intent is that you will believe the obvious conclusion because that is their most glorious revelation that has come up with. But when you take that glorious revelation, that obvious conclusion, you will not find it anywhere in the message. And that becomes their great pillar. This becomes a thing. In fact, as they go as far as to say, you can't be in the rapture without that. And here the prophet didn't say it. I say I don't believe it. I reject it. Flatly reject it. &gt;&gt; And then they they they play out for years and they catch people. Oh, a wonderful revelation. Oh, have you got this? And they love to dispute with it. And he says, what will be gained by it? What will be attained by it? Has a single learned strife ever settled ever been settled? Never. &gt;&gt; Their number has only been increased. Satan is the greatest sist is disputer. He has never been overcome in a strife of words. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham says if we get into that, leave it. &gt;&gt; You can't debate with those things. &gt;&gt; In divine service, the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God. Each one chatters as he pleases or kills time by learned disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become partaker of the divine nature. Second Peter 1:4. Scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys. The church has almost lost, listen to it, has almost lost the power of binding. Only the power of loosing remains. in the earth loosing people being loosed one from the other. This the this fellowship from that fellowship and you barely get a handful of people together and someone else seen something else and someone else is seeing something different. I'll tell you one thing. Hear me good. There'll be no such thing at the marriage table. [Applause] And I'm going to say something. &gt;&gt; At this last convention we just had in Switzerland, there was nine under 300 people there. Once I asked brother brother Vin I said in the small island of Trinidad I said how many works are there there? He says about 42. Oh my, so many churches and works in the small island of Trinidad. How how many kind of different angles of belief on the message? He said 42. In this gathering of people, there were people established pastors with works. And maybe they didn't fellowship real close, but they recognized and respected one another. &gt;&gt; And there was other ministers that came from Romania and one from Rome, right in the shadow of the Vatican. And they came from other parts of Italy and they came from Belgium, from Holland, from Germany. They came from France. All many, many countries. Ministers were there and all the people were there. And I can tell you, I happen to know there was just all kinds of different beliefs, but they without knowing, and I'm closing, they without knowing fulfilled that part that brother Brandham puts in the church ages. When they came to the doors, they walked through the doors and they left everything behind. And &gt;&gt; they said, "We're in here to hear God's word. &gt;&gt; We're in here to fellowship. We're in here to be in unity." &gt;&gt; And you can talk to any one of dozens of those people. I got a phone call this week. My wife said it also. Others that were here were over there. Soon as they walked in, it was like a cloud fell upon the people. Everyone became enveloped and people who didn't agree with the other one at all and even had beliefs and they had disputations of the past, they left it all. &gt;&gt; And ministers would stand up and look at the other minister rejoice and at the word they were hearing. Brother Ron Spencer was preaching. Didn't matter who was preaching. Brother Murphy preached, Brother Tom preached. And they just took up and they they stood they waved their hands and rejoiced in the word they were hearing. And it was it it was as though I woke up the other morning and I marveled. Still marveling at it. I woke up in the wee hours of the morning. I said that was so glorious. It was like the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; witnessed to my heart. That's going to be the same atmosphere at the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to be there. &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to experience. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm getting ready for right now. &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me, please? &gt;&gt; Would you like to go and get ready? I'd like to have the musicians if you'd come please. Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly dove. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will abide here with us. &gt;&gt; We need you, oh spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; We need you. Take away all this human abilities and human everything that we are humanly speaking. Lord, we just want to be spiritual sons and daughters of God. We have nothing to offer, oh God. We just give you ourselves. &gt;&gt; We just give you ourselves. &gt;&gt; Sweet Holy Spirit. Sweet Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; sweet heavenly dove, come be with us. Lord, these people have been kind and they've listened a long time. the only service we have today. But we're here, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're wanting to express our thanks. I want to thank you, Lord, in the in the before this congregation of people. I'm more thankful all the time for this message that you've sent and how pure it is, oh God, and the things that I've not understood that you make it clearer as time goes on. Oh God, I do not do not comprehend this great eternal God that fills all time or space, but we reach out to you, Father, because we know you're the one that has created all things. You have given us life. That's why we're here. We are here, oh Lord, to to honor your name. I pray that you will bless the congregation of people and all who are streaming the service today. Bless them. I pray father with your presence and that will suffice for us in Jesus' name. Let the words that have been spoken now father go out and be lodged in the heart. I pray the holy spirit will bring it back to remembrance. And any lord whose hearts are not where they ought to be Lord I pray you'll move on them now. keep them and stir them. I pray that other mature and elder believers will pray for the one that might be struggling. And I would say to you, if you're in a if you're in the place of decision, if you're in the place at a junction in your life, whatever you do, Satan's way and his ways are filled with increased trouble and difficulty. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, give yourself unreservedly to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have people that will pray with you and for you. &gt;&gt; We're for you &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I wonder if we could do we sing. Do we know that sweet Holy Spirit?

Okay. &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tommy. Well, we have to find ourselves in the scripture, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a a wonderful, wonderful time, Thomas. Just had a couple of days away with my uh wife and the three grandsons. Maybe just to give you a little bit of background, this is an unusual little boy. He's always had a heart for the things of God from as a young age of six and a half. And we were just took them through the little museum in Victoria and you have to go up some flight of stairs to go to the museum and he saw the old typewriter sitting on a desk. He saw the the setting was older and he turns to his grandma and says, "Grandma, is this brother Bram study?" That's very unusual that a boy of six &gt;&gt; would have something like that on his mind in an old museum. And this young man has desired, I believe it's just over a year to be baptized. God dealt with his heart very young. And Thomas as a grandpa was looking to the scripture. To me, this is a great event as it would be your own children, your own grandchildren. But there was a day that Abraham had to offer Isaac on an altar. Came to a place where he had to give his all what God had revealed to him on an altar. And I started thinking about that. And one day, many years ago, I had to come to a place. I had to lay everything on an altar. And because of that, there was a voice that came from heaven and said,"Abraham, stay your hand. I know thou lovest me." And because of Abraham willing to lay it down, a promise was given that Abraham, your seed shall possess the gates of your enemy. And because I I looked at one day there was a surrendering young man at 21 her parents and everybody else wanted nothing to do with what I believed by God's grace possessed the seed this seed possessed the gate of his enemy. I married a wonderful wife, Sister Joanne. We were unable to have children. We were able to possess the gates of our enemy. &gt;&gt; And we have three sons, supernatural sons, each one. And these sons have now had children. Did not come without its struggles throughout their lives. And we can say, Thomas, that God that spoke to Abraham, spoke to grandpa, has spoke to your father. &gt;&gt; And I believe with all my heart that same God has spoke to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that you will have the same promise, Thomas, that you shall also possess the gates of your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can say as Abraham of old, this day this scriptures fulfilled in your ears. Amen. &gt;&gt; For it shall be unto your children and your children's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As many as our Lord our God kept call. This is a great day. Thomas, you've waited a long time. You believe Jesus Christ is your savior. You would like to say something. Okay, you say something. Do you love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. I take that as an amen. Let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer. Father, this young boy has had his heart turned to heaven at a young age. Has desired the things of God for many months, Lord. You've come into his heart. He's asked you. He has repented. And he desires, Lord, to live a life worthy of the gospel. He desires to be filled with God. He desires that the Holy Ghost would reign within him. And Father God, we ask that you will fill his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fill his soul. &gt;&gt; Let there be a fire burn within his own bones, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, that he would be always ready to to give account of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to proclaim that Jesus Christ is has risen and he's alive and he's well and he's living in me to tell. &gt;&gt; Would you bless Thomas? Would you ever guide him and lead him? Keep your hand upon him now and fill him. We pray Lord in Jesus name. Amen. and Thomas, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your savior, I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Praise God. &gt;&gt; What can we do? The children will teach us. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask brother Oed. So nice to have brother Oed Deoka has just come down from Edmonton. If you'll come and dismiss us in prayer, brother Oed, that's the only service today. Next week we start with two services and then the following Sunday we will have Lord's table uh communion foot washing on September the 18th. So let's just stand and brother O. Doesn't he look like a preacher? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pray for prayer blessing upon us. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus, it's such a privilege to be in the house of God. Lord, to be able to hear the pure truth of God. Father, we are so thankful in this dark age to be able to see the light, &gt;&gt; the word that been made flesh and manifested among us. Lord, we thank you, Father, for speaking through our pastor. Lord, you so inspired him this morning and we have learned so many things. Oh God, I pray that you fill him once again and strengthen him, Father, and give him more revelation, oh God, to guide the bride of Jesus Christ until the coming of the Lord. Lord, we bless your name and we commit little Thomas into your hands, Father. Lord God, this little young boy that been baptized this morning, Lord, may you fill him with the Holy Spirit. May in this young age may he be able to serve you for the rest of his life. We give you praise for his father and grandfather for the whole family. Lord, &gt;&gt; what are heritage Lord Jesus you have given them. We thank you for it. We pray that you go with us. Protect us along the way, Father. And the children that will start school this next week, we commit them again into your hands. We thank you Lord Jesus for everything you will do for us in Jesus name we pray.
