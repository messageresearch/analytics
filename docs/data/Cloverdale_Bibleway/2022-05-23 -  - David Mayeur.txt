[Music] he set me free to worship [Music] glory happy new year [Music] [Music] that's glory glory glory [Music] is [Music] and that's the song [Music] good evening and god bless you just wanted to say a few words maybe i'll just start by saying i don't make a habit of dressing like a cowboy but it was wild west day at the school today and i didn't have time to go home so we have fun at bca and i honestly i can't say i can't really express with words just how much i appreciate all these students bca just the fact that we have that school and that i was able to get that position and it's just been such a blessing to me in so many ways these these children are amazing these young lives uh i think it's part of the you know the the vision of this church right that's kind of an extension of the bible we've come to bibleway christian academy so we wanted to have something to kind of represent at these meetings but one thing i wanted to say was one thing that really impresses me about the bca students is just how how much comes up from inside them you know like i know brother michael ray has been preaching a lot about tower the body and it's not just a one-man show anymore everybody's kind of working together and that's exactly what i see like the song we're about to sing for you tonight a young man approaches me and he says i was down in some special meetings and there was this song and it was really a blessing to the believers down there and i just thought maybe you know if you wanted we could do that as a choir and i thought yeah absolutely i want to support you in that so we're going to do that and then while we're practicing a young sister jumps up and says hey it sounded like that section needed a little bit of help do you want me to go yeah absolutely you know i think it almost feels like i'm just the guy that just was standing there and everything happened so i hope you hope the song's a blessing [Music] sometimes on this journey i get lost in my mistakes what looks to me like weakness is a canvas for your strength and my story isn't over my story's just begun failure won't define me cause that's what my father does yeah failure won't define me cause that's what my father does [Music] is [Music] heaven is the ankle but the journey's where we are he never wanted perfect he just wanted my heart and the story isn't over if the story isn't good a failure's never final and the father's in the room yeah failure's never final when the father's in the room [Music] is [Music] [Music] love is on the move when the father's in the room the prison doors fleeing wide the dead come to life love is on the move [Music] strongholds now are shaken love is breaking through when the fire love is breaking through [Music] [Music] farewell [Music] you're in the father's house praise the lord thank you students brother tim god bless you and we're going to invite the i can't really say african choir because it's not all africans but those that are singing jubilee we're going to come sing a 50th anniversary song jubilee so why don't you come and prepare for that amen just as they're coming let's uh let's sing together um blessed be blessed be you o lord our strong mighty tower amen oh you o lord are a strong and mighty tower [Music] oh [Music] me let your people proclaim and let your feet [Music] holy truth me [Music] glory to oh oh

devil amen and we're going up we're going out i'd like to thank brother biscuit 50 years of a faithful pastor this is the beginning of our jubilee but as i said the other day this is not a day rejoicing jubilee was a year of rejoicing we can start as we have started rejoicing in the goodness of god that has led us kept us and has kept our pastor brother biscuit would you come and say something please let's greet our dear path we're so thankful for you each one and for those men that are here on the platform that have left their churches yes brother david meyer and son have come from switzerland brother tim pruitt and brother tim pruitt has said he said again at our table and i believe it with all my heart he said brother ron spencer is a miracle amen when he stands and preaches every week and i know something about that [Applause] and he's the man who prayed a prayer when i was laying in the hospital and i suddenly i jerked my head because i knew my family was waiting and i said i don't know and i said out loud i don't know if i'm going to come out of there i had had brother ron spencer pray and i said i'll just call his cell you don't mind standing do you a few moments i'll call his cell and if he answers then i know that god is has put it together and i called his cell and i said brother ron i called you once for prayer now i'm calling you again for prayer the first time it was just a physical thing but this time it's a spiritual thing and i don't know whether i'm going to come out of this place and he said sure brotherhood and he prayed a prayer and he started to pray and i thought while he was praying i thought i'm going to hang on to the words because this is my turn the woman at the well it was her turn but now this is my turn and i brought it up to today and friends i moved i moved because god answered the prayer and i said i i prayed and i said would you have pray for me i have 14 blockages 90 in the main artery i have not told all of this and down to 30 in other and my cardiologist had a look at it and he said to my wife he said the man that did the bypass and he didn't turn on any of the bypass equipment he said this is off pump and that's what they said on the document it was an off pump operation and he operated on my heart for three and a half hours and he dr chung was his name and i thought it was dr watson going to be doing the operation so i i just when brother ron spencer was praying he said anoint the person anoint he didn't even say the person or the man or the woman or the doctor he said anoint them anoint them so that they will rise to the and i thought well i know who the person is dr watson and i went back into dr watson's office or no i'm sorry i didn't go back into his office i was laying on the bed and he said unfortunately we have to leave i have to leave tonight and i will not be there to do your surgery i said who's going to do it he said dr chung he will be in charge of the i said dr watson you look awfully awful lot like a man that stood at the foot of my bed who was dr watson he said i am dr watson but i can't do your operation and he said we have great teams i said would you be standing there as i am laying here would you be as happy if dr chung was doing your surgery and the head of the team he said that was the only time he smiled he cracked a little smile and he said all of our people our teams are good and i said would you trust them with your life and he said yeah i think so i would i said that's good because he's the same yesterday today and forever and there was a sister here sister shirley brother james's wife and she's up in the recording room yes and i said to her sister shirley brother james i said to her i've missed you i miss you from seeing your face and she said i'm up in the recording room and i am doing it in chinese for the chinese people and i said praise god god bless you god bless you brother james and andy and i know that it's right it's right that shirley should be up there and i know it was right and dr chung he was ready to do the surgery for me and he i want to say this my daughters were there and they tapped real quick and my for my wife's sake and brought up the google search and brought up dr chung's name and he got famous by transplanting three human hearts in one evening and that was a 15 he stood on his feet for 15 hours and transplanted those three hearts and i i felt okay i felt okay and in the morning he said hi i'm dr chung i said nice to see you he said this is dr kang from singapore he's going to be assisting me and watching while i do the surgery i said well great i prayed for you all both of you and by name dr chunk i prayed for you dr kang i prayed for you and they said well thank you they accepted that but i i wanted to get that in and i had prayed for them and a man who was a cardiologist was not even there but he was looking at the pictures and he said well he said we have 14 blockages and we've bypassed those and the dr chung was able to bypass them with about three only three bypasses it was just miraculous and uh so i was standing there and he said he said you have this bypass and that bypass and you have a uh an extra one he says and my wife said to him why do we have that he said it's because he's a man of god and he's jewish he was jewish cardiologist but he said well he's a man of god and so they operated on it and he he wouldn't let michael in the room michael wanted so badly to go in michael is our in-house doctor but he this was above him apparently anyhow michael that was the other part of the story and that's why they wouldn't let because i had said to my wife nobody goes in and sees until the tube is on i don't i don't want them to see in tube and that was because my friend my son-in-law who's married to linda ordeal and kenneth ordeal was there and i said i do not want them to see them moving that two boat two weeks before he had saw he had had to give the word for his mother to have the tube taken out and she didn't last and they had a funeral for her and i said i don't want that right i i don't want that to happen i want to him to know that it's all done and it's finished and the man who was doing it he said can you hear me yes i said i can hear you he said the last little thing i'm going to do is take the tube out and i took it out i wasn't in tubed anymore and i was perfectly fine and i've been perfectly fine ever since praise god spencer thank you for your prayer thank you for your prayer and thank god that answered it amen amen and

while but i preached on it years ago and and that goodness that will pursue you it will overtake you it will keep you and here we are tonight kept by the power the blood of jesus christ we can say surely the goodness of god comes after us let's stand as we welcome brother david mayor to minister tonight [Music] me [Music] [Music] the goodness of god [Music] [Music] of the goodness of god [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] god bless you saints what an honor to be standing here that's from the bottom of my heart it's good to be back but it's an honor to be standing here in front of the saints for this 50th anniversary my i just want to take a before i preach this is the moment i want to take so maybe if you can take your seeds just so i bring you greetings on behalf of my precious wife family the church and i have my son with me i'm very happy he could join when i asked him do you want to come oh for the meetings i want to come so he made it possible so but again i repeat it's an honor to be standing here many would have loved to be here so i thank brother ed brother tom for the invitation and we want to give honor where honor is due so i want to take my time and we have all the generals behind so it's really an honor and a blessing but when god calls a man he calls his wife so brother ed sister ruth i looked up the word legacy what a legacy it says a gift or something transmitted now 50 years is well if if youngsters and you know teenagers you tell them you're 50 you're old i know what i'm talking about so but 50 years in a church many things happen we could see the pictures log church how it how god blessed because that's been said but i want to say because a man of god had a vision maybe you were not there but when you look around that's god's doing and it is marvelous it is marvelous brotherhead has given all he had for the wonderful world of god and when i said he has it ain't over yet because if he wants to give advice even now he will say spread the message spread the word give it out wherever and when i said it's an honor to be standing here is you can look around and please do you know your brothers and sisters but there's an unseen huge crowd maybe we don't think about but that were touched because they received one message book because a man of god had a passion a zeal so yeah we want to give honor where honor is due i met brother i heard brother ed years years and years ago and but for the first time we met brother ed in germany that was the first time we met at brother gert rodowals in beaslesburg and there was a direct bond the direct connection and direct love if i may say so don't be jealous please because some people could be jealous but don't be jealous you cannot manufacture that and through the years i've spent time with brother ed i've been honored to have him in my home and listening to advice and and what a blessing you are blessed we are blessed and then i learned and that understands even better the connection is of course we love the word we do everything we have for the word of god and then also hearing his life story or you know when brother ed was born he was in the anna turnbull memorial hospital in saskatchewan i'm sorry my pronunciation but what struck me is that since 1908 there was a doctor r g scott that was from the geneva mission who was in charge so brotherhood there was a connection already you were born but even before we were born there was already a connection we were together before the foundation of the world and we are feasting on what god has done through a vessel a surrendered vessel 50 years many things happened many joys many hardships many birds baptisms some people has left us but i thank god for brother redd sister ruth you know brother branham he speaks about great woman this is a woman who has faith sister ruth and greatness says brother branham is humility thank you brother ed he would never take credit for what he has done for the message if you want to speak that's why i want to take this opportunity please forgive me brotherhead but from the bottom of my heart i would like to say thank you and when i say there's an unseen invisible crowd yes when brother ed came over to the meetings you have people from different countries coming and say thank you for sending us the message thank you for translating maybe you don't understand that because you speak english you got all the message books you got all the tapes and audio but out there there are people that live with one message book for months and months and months so i thank god for a vision that he gave to a man we're not lifting up man but yes we want to be thankful to god for what he has done for us never wants to take credit but i want to say thank you brother ed i love you from the bottom of my heart we love you family loves you the church loves you the saints love you and while i was coming here i listened to a tape on the plane and randomly and it was proving his word and your brother branham starts talking and he says well there's my precious friend of mine brother reverend eddie biskell said well hallelujah now god knows how to do things his brother and my reverend good friend brother reverend eddie biskill wife and children and he says probably he was looking for brother eddie now that's not the a-man corner he says you can come over here on the platform you're welcome to come up and then he continues to give the testimony about the green checkered church and so on so i'm glad the prophet called him a good friend and by god's grace i can call brother ed biskell a friend of mine it is an honor to be standing with real man of god so may god bless him may god bless us to ruth amen and like the prophet would say the rights is to root a huge portion of heaven awaits thee what you have done to the least you have done it unto me god bless you brother adam amen and thank you thank you so it ain't over it's just a continuation because something has been transmitted a passion a zeal and we will continue until we leave this place amen why don't we stand hallelujah if we can take the word of god take leviticus and please forgive me if i didn't shake your hand yesterday night so we'll have the whole weekend to shake hands so i wanted to get ready for today but i believe god will bless us tonight and through the whole weekend so leviticus 25 verse 8. and thou shalt number seven sabbats of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shall i cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month so we see here revelation 10 7 okay please read just putting some foundations here in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall howl the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man into his family a jubilee shall be the fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which grow it off itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of divine undressed for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field and in the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession amen another scripture in john 8 verse 31. then jesus then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abraham's seed and we were never in bondage to any man house saith thou ye shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be partially free you shall be 99.9 no ye shall be free indeed hallelujah may god add the blessing to the reading of his word let's pray precious heavenly father lord once again we want to give you all the glory father how thankful we are father for the church here lord for the celebration of 50 years lord god and how we thank you for all the work that's been done lord all those that have labored for this weekend i pray may you give them a special blessing lord may you bless brotherhood sister root father lord may you watch over them lord and how thankful we are father to have been standing together here on the battlefield lord and father for the blessing lord through the vessel lord so may you bless them especially in this weekend bless each and every one here father those that are streaming lord and father we can read your word lord anybody can read the word but father we ask you the author to come down father and to break the bread of life lord to oh lord make yourself real to each and every one father it may it not be just an anniversary for of a church lord but may each and every one receive his liberty his freedom lord that you have given us father so may you take full control father i surrender lord and may you speak through the vessel we pray and ask these things in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen for a title tonight i was listening to this song and i said no they're they're taking my sermon for a title the bride's jubilee is a reality amen we sung the song my jubilee so it's something personal my jubilee amen there where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty amen so our worship is not to bring us back to a souza street or no no it's not just an emotion or an excitement no but it's it's the word of god the opening of the word that produces that the dynamics on the mechanics but how thankful we are amen for the true jubilee if we look up in the in the lexicon in hebrew it says yobel means trumpet the greek lexicon says release from bondage forgiveness or pardon letting them go as if they had never been committed amen so therefore i'm gonna put bring a parallel now we read amen 10 7 revelation 10 7 amen and god is so good because the prophet could say it's like you've never done in the first place amen the definition of jubilee amos is a season or occasion of joyful celebration so i don't want to see any sad face this is an opening service but it's not an opening service amen it's a continuation amen it's a book of acts that is being written so it's from glory to glory and glory to glory if you don't want it i will take it amen amen 50 years is gold this is a golden time in the world they speak it's it's a horrible time this is a golden time for us for the bride amen brother branham says 50 means jubilee 50 is god's jubilee number the word pentecost means 50. so let it be another pentecost this after this weekend jubilee means the going up the release oh that's the jubilee i want that's the jubilee i want amen we can look into sabbath the sabbath means arrest amen then brother abraham says the holy spirit is the sabbath amen so we're gonna we're gonna just amen travel along through the scriptures if that is okay amen and for the americans i i did some research for the our dear friends from the united states who cross the border i will have a big amen on that one we'll see the yeah the liberty bell was a symbol of the american independence the first time it was rang was on july 8 1776 and it was to summon the people to hear the declaration of independence and on that bell was written a part of leviticus 25 10. it says proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof so a country can proclaim liberty and people rejoice about it people oh they have a big party because we are free i mean we can hear wars rumors of wars and and and we're sad and we pray for our beloved ones there and the saints there and when a people is an oppression yes people live under fear and all this but then when the liberty is proclaimed it's a time of great celebration amen but i'm not here to ring the liberty bell of the united states i'm here to proclaim the liberty that god has given us amen and we're gonna pray we're gonna ring that bell so loud through the weekend aiming that each and every one can receive the liberty [Applause] hallelujah glory so my liberty make it personal we know brother branham speaks about seven sabbats which is the seven church ages now the jews they have been blinded and they're waiting all this time while the pentecostal first fruits has been poured out upon the church amen so through the ages amen the pentecost of first fruits have been poured out and here we are here we are my what a celebration amen in return and jubilee and brother branham says as a type we're going to use israel because amen it's a jubilee time and the church was given a portion which was who christ himself that was poured out by the holy spirit into each heart that would receive it and then become sons of god listen now we're building up now israel was a servant to god and was given a possession okay and this possession was not given to anyone else oh i love that so when satan comes around he tries to steal your blessing tries to steal your possession the jubilee trumpet sounds and when i hear the word of god i can claim my god-given rights oh glory glory if someone or an individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by god so it's not any inheritance that god it's given by god it's about time we wake up the awakening of the bride is a reality the bride's jubilee is a reality not an emotion not something manufactured it's a reality glory so if any individual lost their inheritance given by god there came a year called the jubilee year and every seven years there was a sabbath and this jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance every man i'm looking to by some means if he was a free born brother branham says we are not born to be in bondage to be slaves we are born to be sons and daughters of god [Music] freeborn and true-blooded israelites brother branham would say i'm not born charles alaba and branham i come from god i go back to god glory so no matter who held the possession he it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay anything he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance it was a god-given right because by grace he inherited it so no matter what had taken place so no matter what has taken place before you arrive here if he lost it it must go free because it meant grace is a way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance my the jubilee is god's manner of expressing grace to his people i love that i love that for restoring or peop or be brought back to their rightful position our rightful position in jesus christ now i believe that this is the hour again of jubilee i believe it's the time of jubilee says a prophet now a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the jubilee now we know revelation speaks about he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit says and to the churches so lord let my spiritual ear be so sensitive when the word comes forward i don't want to be busy with all kinds or going around with all my mind battles all kinds of thoughts i want to receive if only a word i know my life can be changed [Music] so if he could hear the jubilee the trumpet sound and know what it meant to them the priest brother brown calls it the jubilee priest the jubilee priest let's sound a trumpet meeting service after service service after service amen the jubilee priests sound the trumpet the minister the trumpet is a gospel so no matter where they're lost how far they went back listen now how far you went back doesn't matter whatever they had to do they had the privilege we have the privilege tonight to be in the presence of god almighty to come and receive again their inheritance come on mom and dad listen to this the whole family could come and receive their inheritance [Applause] you have a way we're trying the way we're dotted it doesn't matter it's your inheritance it's your possession [Applause] glory came many many men or there's the other crowd that have walled themselves so far that they want to listen to what somebody says about it instead of listening to thus say it the lord you know i'd rather listen to somebody who might have a clearer understanding i might listen to somebody who got a revelation or some kind of doctrine or whatever nonsense give me the pure word god send me a vindicated prophet for who for me [Applause] for my jubilee hallelujah thine of glory now is the hour of jubilee come on now is the hour of jubilee come on church don't put it on tomorrow tomorrow we'll have another jubilee now is the hour of jubilee [Applause] hallelujah come back to your original inheritance to a real holy ghost again and outside of the pure word you won't have a real holy ghost you can have sensation you can have emotions you can have all kinds of goosebumps or hair coming like this and all kinds of things but it's not a true real baptism of the holy ghost now you could go free didn't have to pay anything didn't have to do nothing just get up and go that's all he had to do amen if he knew the sound of the trumpet but he had to know the sound of the trumpet for they were sons of god now you know a trumpet can sound many ways in the army a trumpet can sound and it's one sound to call you let's come and dine another sound just to wake you up or another sound for the raising of the flag but the jubilee trumpet had a sound a clear sound not an uncertain sound it was a sound from god himself and the people knew when i hear that sound the scene in me knows when i hear that sound no matter where i'm at i hear the sound i can go free i be i can be delivered i can be healed [Applause] ma but it's individual it's your jubilee let's come back to to israel moses receives the promise go deliver my people they go out now the front of this nice country moses couldn't go there's joshua and caleb the land where it's flowing of milk and honey brother says you've been on this mountain long enough but come on let's go over let's possess our inheritance it's time to rise to be sons of god in the name of jesus christ and rise to a place so you can return in this jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the gospel of the word of god you are brethren not a denomination you are born sons and daughters of god but if the slave wants to stay a slave let him be let him stay in these walled cities but you are free he says let's go back to our inheritance let's go back to the beginning let's go back to what we were from the beginning an attribute of god we come from god we go back to him now joshua he didn't have the poor me attitude he didn't have the grasshopper attitude he didn't have the defeat attitude i'm making it personal now how do we come to church oh poor me no not poor me joshua said we're more than able you think joshua didn't have eyes oh yes you did he even knew very well how thick the walls were god always does like brother joe would say incredible math so here we have joshua how can i destroy the walls the land is ours the promise is ours god gave it to us but how can i possess the land there has to be a way that these walls these seals can open if those seals don't open i won't see my full possession i won't see my true identity i won't see my full inheritance so what does he do we never pray enough so he goes that's biblical huh he goes to prayer and here he meets someone the angel of the lord he has his sword drone are you for me or against me i'm the captain here i'm the captain here and i'm in charge of this so joshua you're going to follow me i'm leading this battle our lord is mighty in battle glory glory glory amen even brother branham himself needed the angel to come down he says it himself for those that want to make from brother branham a god and with all due respect but he isn't god he said if the angel wouldn't have come i would have told you a terrible mistake so no one is worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof only the lamb slain before the foundation of the world is worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof so no man can claim my revelation god keeps up to himself so this is not a revelation of brother branham come on this is not brother branham's property or anybody's property this is god's property some people don't like it but it's the truth anyway i'll be gone in a few days so the word is god's property and he reveals his own word so god himself chose his bride just like i explained there's a connection love appreciation respect i mean that's what god he chose his bride it's not a person it's not a group it's not a headquarters god himself so now during those seven church ages they have been walking in silence around the walls and here comes the seven church age and it says but in the days of the voice when he will begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished shall be revealed shall be made clear christ revealed amen it shall be finished these walls these seals shall be opened these thunders will utter their voices whoo and you will have a jubilee not a man made you believe not from a man somewhere in the country or so no a real jubilee from god himself [Applause] for some there's still silence but for the bride the silence is broken for the bride it is a rejoicing time it is a jubilee time oh hallelujah there has been a message of resurrection a rapture message an adoption message given to his bride that's why in the seventh time while there is shouting and these walls are coming down i don't want to go ahead building up let's go back to our origin the young people sung about it failure failure won't define me although satan comes around and he says you did you've done this you've done that you did this you did that your background is this your background is that failure won't define me i am a son of god i am a daughter of god amen and it's about time we don't just say things but we believe what god amen it's not what satan says what anybody says in what god says about me [Applause] glory glory amen amen amen so what happens when god sends a jubilee in them days listen the god that sends a jubilee in them days is the same god that sends the jubilee today [Applause] all the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay any price they could absolutely go free but it was their choice choose ye this day tonight you can be delivered tonight you can be healed tonight you can be sealed oh i just want to wait until brother rombro the team brotherhood no tonight you can be delivered glory now those that didn't want to go free what happened the master would take an owl bore the ear which marked them to serve their master forever you know why it was put on the ear because hearing faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god so to reject the message to reject the resurrection message the rapture message the jubilee message the word of god is being bored in the ear and be spiritually deaf that's why we have all this nonsense everywhere on on the internet so don't even waste your time amen brother sorry brother tim to mention that but people try to write you know all kinds of males and tried to provoke we don't even want to waste time on it i'm getting ready we're getting ready to leave here there'll still be fussing and the rapture will be gone already [Music] so tonight if you want to run don't run outside run to jesus [Music] if you want to doubt doubt the devil if you want to hide hide in the word because there's no time for wasting jesus is the way the truth and the lies there's one way that's jesus [Applause] he came down listen he came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was build so let's look at the resurrection a moment is that okay the value i heard can't remember who but i heard somebody say the value of something is the price somebody is willing to pay hmm you can think about that and you can think what he has done for me for us that's the value that's your value that's how he saw us so let's never take things for granted or just an ordinary service or something commonly no god is so good to us so we can look into the gospels there's the four gospels and we can see that they all tell us the stories what happened around jesus where jesus was so they all have different perspectives of what's going on now some tell it a certain way others is not her for example there's only in john that you will read about lazarus but there's one thing they have in common that is the resurrection message they all write it what happened so it must be something quite important jesus told exactly what would happen he told it to his disciples for the sake of time you can read it in matthew 16 21 where he says and i'm gonna be killed and be raised again the third day he told it even to the pharisees but they were not listening to the sound of the trumpet they didn't want it because it was out of their you know they were so blocked chained by traditions but even there they heard it matthew 27 says saying sir we remember that the cv the deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again and people hear the word of god and they just want to continue but not for me it's my jubilee you want you don't want your jew it's my jubilee so the resurrection message was didn't start by the disciples it started by jesus himself god keeps that to himself because he doesn't want anybody to interfere with whatever it's only after in the book of acts that you see the disciples amen writing about amen and the book of acts didn't stop didn't end hey we are living a book of acts so now paul says knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you in one peter 1 it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy had begotten us unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that faded not away reserved in heaven for you [Applause] where is the you group here wonderful so the resurrection the rapture message is not an ending it's not a conclusion it's a climax revelation 1 18 says i am alive forevermore paul tells us in 1 corinthians 15 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then christ is not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching in vain and your faith is also in vain there was a resurrection so god intended for man of god to preach the word not to push play and obey hey sorry brother tom brother and hey it might set somebody free that's what it's all about satan has bound so many people by all kinds of ids of men doctrines of man while the trumpet the sound of freedom has been proclaimed the rest in hebrews 4 there remain and therefore arrest a sabbath to the people of god for he that has entered into his arrest he saw he also had cease from his own works and guarded from his so the rest is a confirmation and makes you a witness of the resurrection [Music] now follow me it's just some teaching building up so when that happens it's not my daddy told me that my redeemer lived it's not a testimony of someone that told me god is alive i know my redeemer liveth i know he is alive tonight hey man he's living in me i feel him in my hands i feel him in my feet i feel him all over me god's not dead he is alive [Music] because i live ye shall live also i am the messiah and you're messiest [Applause] hallelujah matthew 21 1 says if the in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week now listen we're going to continue i want to stay on that for a while the sabbath ends at sun down when the sun goes down when the sun comes up that's the witness of a new day now we know the jews they didn't name their their days and and but matthew here he wants to make sure that everybody would recognize what they were talking about this marks a changing of time this will be the last sabbath where we will bring lambs bring doves we'll bring saba so after this sabbath it will never be the same because a perfect lamb was slain for me [Music] there's a new covenant a new day this sunday proved that god is almighty now let's look for a little while what we find at the tomb okay the first witnesses of the resurrection were women we know in the bible women represent a church a type so the first witnesses of the resurrection is the church what are they doing there they have seen him lay him in the tomb they saw him crucified they saw all the events happening the following day they come with spices to anoint him they are mourning they go there out of love out of sympathy they love jesus they go there but they haven't went there for a resurrection message and maybe some are here tonight and you have come out of love for your mom for your dad or maybe out of love and sympathy for for for brother ed and sister rude because it's a an anniversary but god has other plans for you you will hear the resurrection message you will feel the resurrection power stop limiting god [Applause] stop making your own programs and surrender to god [Applause] isn't it something while they were on their way the bible says in march 16 2 and verily early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and they said among themselves who shall roll away the stone from the door of the poker so here we have these women all kinds of mind battles here we have the spices we have we will do all we can all we have out of love but what will happen who will roll away that stone they were walking in darkness they were waiting for the rising of the natural sun but they are fixing to be witnesses of the resurrection of the rising of the son they don't even know that something happened already to that stone during that time you know satan tries to attack the word every time he tried even while jesus was here that's the antichrist spirit that we can see working all over the world but god's spirit is here and he raises a standard so during that time we can see in matthew 26 pilate said unto them you have a watch go your way make it as sure as he can stupid devil so they went and made the sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch they couldn't see it enough god is almighty and he will always break the seal to prove his resurrection my god is awesome mighty in battle woo hallelujah matthew 28 2. we're building up here now matthew 28 2 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended revelation 10 1 and another mighty angel descended glory another an angel from the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it come on church my god is almighty [Applause] what rome what satan has sealed god just sits on it satan tries to keep you bound but jesus set me free satan tries to keep you down but satan is finished because jesus proclaimed me free glory blowing boo devil start claiming your possession he's but a bluff brother david i heard it before it's not i heard it before this is the trumpet sounding telling you this is the price jubilee glory hallelujah [Applause] the resurrection message the rapture message has an effect on all the surroundings there was an earthquake the bible says that those guardians those soldiers they were like dead they were there was a real trembling taking place they ended up dead couldn't stop the angel from coming down and opening that seal and he couldn't stop the angel from coming down to open the seals for us [Applause] glory glory glory satan he oh we better kick him out of here [Applause] come on church the jubilee we know the story they climbed up the mountain so let's just think about it think about it you came here and tonight you're gonna if the trumpet sounds you will be free they send out the young you know trained people like brother michael who can run fast go on michael go there and when the sun rises just tell us because but i know somebody who end up mount calvary mount golgotha and he proclaimed my freedom he told me i am free so i know in whom i believe now what's the opening of the seals revealing christ [Applause] come on a few more bombs here the opening of the seal was wasn't broke to let jesus out you get that the opening of the seal wasn't there to let jesus out because jesus he can walk through walls he can rock through the rock it was there for them to go in whew only in christ jesus i am secure i am safe that's why the book is open and you have to go get the book eat the book and see who you are oh my lord hallelujah talking about the jubilee oh hallelujah here comes these women questioning but their questions were already answered before they arrived their questions were answered by the message the rapture message the resurrection message amen all doubts were settled [Music] my the opening of the word oh settled all my questions [Applause] there is no other light there is no other life than in this message in this word this message gives us perfect faith [Applause] he who the son has set free is free indeed not partially free indeed and the angel matthew 28 5 and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear ye not for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified but he is not here he is risen as he said as he said it is written thus saith the lord my come see the place where the lord lay my did they see a dead corpse no he is risen we are not serving a dead god god is alive he is almighty we are not feeding on the dead word but the unfailing of the bloody word of the son of man some people may think this message is a dead word no no no no this is a word from god almighty sent in this land of the last age for me for you so the bride's jubilee that's why it's the bride's jubilee is a reality what are you rejoicing about my you don't know what you're rejoicing about brother brown says what a resurrection this was what a resurrection this is hallelujah my the angel tells him come see for yourself i want you to be a witness of the resurrection power my my my jesus was come later he came to the disciples in the room through a stone wall you want to talk he says he had his glorified body says the prophet you talk about the space age the church is fixing to take one fast now there are some people that take that personal and it takes up so much space my ministry i i i that's not what it's saying what does the bible say in john 3 he must increase but i must decrease it's not what i've done it's what he has done for me he proclaimed my liberty we we we had the quotes i thought amen it's not you have to pay it's not i have to do this it's what he has done for me by grace i am saved he loved me before i even could love him he chose me he elected me before the foundation of the world ma then they have done what they said they would do to jesus they crucified him his soul descended into hell preached to the souls that are in prison he took the keys of death hell away from the devil satan wants you to believe that these prisons doors are still locked he doesn't have the keys anymore but except you know the ministers can preach it but it's up to you to take a step of faith it doesn't need it's not a huge door where you need all the power and you know let's go he just opened fade like a mustard seed because the door is already open hallelujah listen now i love it i love it he has taken the keys of dead and hell away from the devil returned back on easter morning and as he come through paradise he knocks at the door hallelujah says the prophet i can hear him say children abraham say who is that i'm your seed the seed of abraham ayah abraham said are we going out it's almost daylight on earth [Applause] oh lord my god and somebody can ask me well how are you gonna be raptured don't you worry about that enoch was walking he pleased god because he believed the word of god and he started walking he started walking by by world by my world don't ask me to explain the physics because i don't care about the physics i know god said so's and i believe it ma ma mama come on abraham are we going out it's almost daylight on earth abraham says jesus can we make a little whistle stop whoa [Laughter] can we make a little whistle stop in jerusalem listen now the reply of jesus yes i got 40 days i want to instruct my disciples they got to go in the world and cast out devils [Music] glory in the name of jesus we cast out devils so we're not we shouldn't fear them because god gave us this authority and jesus says let me go to them i'm going to instruct them for 40 days to cast out devils it didn't end with the disciples at that time [Laughter] glory i better talk to him in a little while before going up so you fellows can just walk around my we're gonna live we're so close amen to living a time amen where our beloved ones will come die hey we're gonna be preaching here's brother branham ma you want to talk about a revival you want to talk about the jubilee oh brother david i hear now the critics say brother david i'll wait until you know what you won't see them you won't see them because it's only the elect it's only the bride that will see them oh my if you've never shouted before you're going to shout my hallelujah when i because i live he shall live also brother brown says he was speaking to his wife oh my my thank you jesus thank you lord hallelujah amen when he died amen and he shed his blood listen the perfect life of god was liberated the perfect life of god was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept the christ as his savior ma so how are we responding to the jubilee trumpet to the freedom trumpet all that god was he emptied in christ all the great eternals of god was emptied in christ and all that christ was he emptied into the church and man and woman are afraid to claim their god-given privilege and stand upon the truth of it not what you think not what satan says not what anybody says but what the truth what the word of god says about you we have the privilege to enforce upon satan the claims that god has given us my [Music] therefore we have the right to force these claims upon satan and say give it back [Applause] i heard the trumpet sound this is my inheritance this is my property get it behind me some of you were at camp and some of you have written something on the soul because that's where satan belongs but it's about time maybe you rewrite something and start putting satan under your feet well brother david i was not camp don't you worry you got your time now this is the hour of jubilee this is the hour of jubilee hallelujah rory give it back and he has to do it ma he has to do it that's not said lord ma hallelujah [Music] and if that ain't enough we can take god's agent the holy spirit go route that right down on our knees and say it's the say of the lord he's got to give up that's all [Applause] [Music] hallelujah that's all cause the holy spirit is there to make him do it this ain't your battle he proclaimed me free he gave me an open book he broke the seals at all therefore my jubilee i can rejoice i can be glad word he is the lamb he alone is worthy [Applause] why are you so excited because i'm living in a jubilee i'm living my jubilee hey man amen and it's a reality this book of acts is a reality amen you heard testimony testimony not just a brother tim's not just a brother arms not just the brother toms all over the world the spirit is moving [Applause] hallelujah that's the enforcement restored back to its natural condition again [Music] it's not our claim it's our claim because god gave it by his stripes we are healed [Applause] amen brother on [Applause] i prayed and it didn't happen and there's this poor me attitude joshua went there with a victorious attitude he knew in who he believed and i'll send my angel before thee glory thank you jesus amen he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we are healed and the lawgiver the holy spirit himself listen the lawgiver not satan that's the nonsense giver the liar giver come on that's what he is that's his nature [Music] he can seem very honest very truthful quote 99.9 percent of the truth but he's still a liar he's still a liar but here [Applause] the law giver the holy spirit himself is here the agent of god to see that it's done that way amen ma you want to talk about a jubilee that's a true
