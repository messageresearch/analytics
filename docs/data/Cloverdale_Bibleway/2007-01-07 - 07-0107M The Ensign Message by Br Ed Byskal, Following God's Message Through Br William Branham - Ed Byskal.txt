for just a moment and it'll be you'll be seated in a bit uh we we join with u Congregation of our brother Pastor Schumacher in Germany who was called to be with the Lord in the last couple all days and uh this is the brother he had uh he had a some heart difficulty and I think a kind of a minor heart attack or a major heart attack I don't know which and here he was he came right to the pulpit a day or two right afterwards and has been taking his post there and we don't have any other details and just to say that he was called to be with the host of witnesses just quickly we've prayed for our sister Norma Smith uh who has pneumonia she was taken to the hospital last night about uh midnight and her daughters and granddaughter sister Jen Johnson and other sisters are with her and sister Sharon braxon I believe I really have a great deal of respect for sister Norma Smith just as quiet Spirit godly woman and comes always to the house of of God under any circumstances or condition and so I know that she'd just dearly loved to be here this morning and we say may God's holy spirit over in that room and be near our sisters that are there and may his perfect will be done I don't want to see her suffering at all so God be with her we didn't have a Time on New Year's Eve to say everything we would like to have said uh but but I I want to make a comment uh regarding our our brother Richard Drake who's standing here and our brother Richard Drake is a has been a been here since been a a young teenage boy been a long time and he has a a responsible position with the TransLink and the bus system but he has a responsible position also amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ and he has taken a personal commission really to send humanitarian Aid to the Ukraine to orphanages to Russia to Siberia in the far north has worked with brother gido and it unbeknown to perhaps many in the congregation that we need to take time and think about it uh and because I believe that as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me and brother Richard has collected clothing from schools uh because he used to work in the school system and has connections gets clothing that's left at the schools uh that's left on the buses that is sent here from churches in different places until we've had to tell people don't send anymore but this year's this last year's shipping totals was 9,752 to the Believers and Orphans of the Ukraine that was a total of 212 boxes and 29 boxes uh to the Believers and orphans in Siberia and from the initiation of each of these projects from the initiation of each of these projects our monthly average for boxes that have been shipped stand at 16 boxes per month to the Ukraine and one and a half boxes per month to Siberia that's since the program was initiated and I want to say to uh Brother Richard and uh the men of vision under whose offices this has all been happening during this time God bless you for the last year and God Prosper you even much more in the F in the future years and it's not just clothing but other things they sent dried food and the and the thanks letters of thanks that have come from these places in fact is the the director of the orphanages in the Siberia has said that men of vision is the only organization that stood by their promise and said they would do something and have done it and I say God bless you brother Richard and uh those that help you amen I think they amen let's just have a word of prayer please before we turn to the word Lord our hearts are filled with Thanksgiving that we could be called the Sons and Daughters of God to be birthed into this family to have Lord the opportunity and the privilege the honor to call others that are around on the surface of to this globe in other countries our brothers and sisters Lord you have called our brother Schumacher to come into your presence to a higher calling to join this great host of witnesses pray for his assembly pray for those that are stepping into his uh place of responsibility give them wisdom oh God give them courage I pray may they declare your word with a Mighty witness and father as we are gathered here today we have uh uh many needs amongst us we've heard the prayer already that's been prayed but now we pray especially father as your word lays open before us that it will be illuminated and may we be a quickened people may we be illuminated by the Holy Spirit and father I pray that all of the flu all of those channels of the flesh and all of those channels to of the spirit that all the memory and the imagination and all the other affections oh God and things which would be hindrances I pray that the holy spirit of God the flame of God the fire of God will burn everyone clear Lord and may the word have free access to the soul and let that one channel Lord be filled with faith Let It Be supercharged with Fai Faith oh God and as the word is spoken I pray Lord it'll be illuminated every individual in the name of Jesus Christ anoint us now Lord we thank you for it amen amen we believe it don't we turn in your Bibles please to John John's gospel the 12th chapter and we're going to read some verses from starting with verse 27 now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this this hour came I but for this cause came I unto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again then down to on to down to verse 32 the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me I'll have you read that verse 32 together with me and I if I be lifted up from the earth with will draw all men unto me while you're still standing brother Bram made uh I think a very very significant point when he came to this verse he turned to it in the first seal before the seals were now to be delivered and preached and he turned to John the 12th chapter and began with the 23rd verse and he said now listen here real close and then you won't have to wonder no more what it is and Jesus answering them said the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified so you're at the end of an age there his ministry is ending I want to draw your attention the prophet's Ministry too was ending the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified and he said then what about the hour has come that when his bride must be taken away what that hour what the hour has come that time shall be no more and the angel is ready to set one foot on land and the other on the sea with a rainbow over him that's the Covenant with his with feet and say times run out and besides that he raised up his hand and swore that time would be no more and the scripture says that it's that time will be no more there'll be no more delay for those things that have been sealed amen and now he says and and he says time has run out and besides that he raised up his hand and swore that that would be that time would no more when this happened how perfect it is he said a sworn affidavit to the church the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified Hallelujah and he is glorified in the fulfilling of his promise I'll have you read with me two other scriptures three scriptures actually Isaiah the 11th chapter and we'll read verses 10 11 and 12 and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ins sign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathos and from Kush and from Elam and from shinar and from hammoth and from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an an sign for the Nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth God bless you as you have your seats I want to greet you all the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ and all who are joined with us today from many places around the world and it's an increasing congregation and we say God blessings upon them as well gathering in rooms in perhaps places where they've chosen to gather and so they are with us and we are one body in Christ I want to speak to you today on the ins sign message n sign e NS I GN the N sign the scripture says that he will set up an N sign and an N sign is simply something that is is lifted up a standard a signal or a banner and end sign is a rallying point something we rally around it is something that is not only to be lifted up but we think of an ins sign as a a flag or something that we identify with and uh we all are identified is as as individuals we are identified immediately we think of we're identified with a certain Nation I understand that even this month there has been a great deal of pressure upon the Canadian government by the American government to cause the people within this country that do not yet have uh legal status as a as a passport they're perhaps on visas student visas visitors visas Etc within Canada and America wants them to have Canadian passports and so there's a enor enormous Russian Crush at this time for everyone to get their passports and hundreds are lining up trying to get their passports so that they will be able to freely cross the border back and forth what is a America saying we want we want a a country to step up to the plate and take responsibility that these people are indeed citizens of the country and then they have freedom to go back and forth and uh of course I don't want to get into this but Canada says well give us a little more time because there's so many people that are here and we've got to process all of these documents as individuals we are I identified with them a country or a nation or a place or a people but yet we we may not have been uh personally in attendance when great events took place and unfolded within the country to which we are associated with or identified with but yet we are identified with what that country stands for and when they put up their flag and uh uh we we have respect and awe and reverence to what that Flag represents because it represents a people it represents a culture it represents an idea it represents uh either democracy or dictatorship or Freedom or or whatever it it represents a free market or it represents something that we say I identify with that and uh uh however we we may not you know be in agreement with everything that our nation stands for but uh we are still identified with it and brother brandom says to be an American I must be identified with my nation when I am born here in this country I become a citizen and I'm identified with this nation all it is all that it is I am all that it has been I am for I'm identified as an American then I have to take all of its shame all of its Glory whatever it is I am because I'm identified with it and a mighty God unveiled he said I'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled I'm identified with that group I can say that you can say that I trust you can say that I'm identified with a group of people that believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ has been called I'm identified with a group of people that believe we have heard indeed the Rapture call and we're on our way in that direction I believe that and he said he's identified with the group that knows that he's unveiled and knows he's the same yesterday today and forever we're identified with that group of people identified with that kind of a message do you believe that just laying a foundation now there was only a few I would say Brave American marines that were actually on uh the hill called eima but a whole nation identifies with it one of the most famous pictures that's many know perhaps and don't even know why it's a famous picture but they they they see it but there's a people and a nation that is identified with it and there's a reverence and respect that is attached to such an event when a flag or an En sign is desecrated stepped on spit on and burned there's a a resentment or a disgust that comes within a person that that because there is a a feeling that's being expressed not not to a piece of cloth but to a whole people to a whole idea to a whole thought to a whole way of life we're saying these people hate the way I live they hate the country and the things that we stand for and so it's something that is really raises feelings of resentment and N sign is raised to be looked upon with a sense of pride awe respect and to give courage also it identifies ownership it's an Evidence of ownership we Fellowship around a message and I want to come to just a moment in a few moments but I'm going to show you some end signs and just a recap in visual form what we have uh what I've been saying up to this point and thanks brother Aaron Hardy for assisting me and I wonder now if the brothers would just run through these video clips all that you see here are identified in this congregation and perhaps we've missed some just about couple two three seconds Congo Trinidad Bosnia Germany Holland Belgium for I want to show you short actually clip of what took place before this this famous picture of the Marines on iima just takes a moment for the brothers to bring it around this cost while we're going back to the picture this cost 4,000 uh American lives in just a very very short time 4,000 more than died in 9911 and 20,000 Japanese that were attempting to defend just they say well it's just a piece of Rock uh but it has some significance and it was a strategic point and when these boys you'd think when there's artillery and mortar shells and ships blasting the this piece of stone this rock and dive bombers bombing it just bombing it to gravel to Pebbles and all of this cost and men like lying everywhere wounded and crying and screaming and men dying uh that's 24,000 men in a short 24,000 a reasonable City that perished in a short time in an island that has that has no buildings on it no nothing and in the boy's Minds in the boys' Minds with all of this noise and the D of War and the emotion of the moment somehow they had it in their hearts and Minds to go up that Steep Hill several hundreds of feet and there raise the flag of their Nation Old Glory and this picture was shot and it's a very very famous picture and we may go to the next one we have a an AM sign this came at Great cost this is the one that's been raised up he was lifted on this pole for the world to see desecrated spit upon beaten hated despised rejected and still is today this one has gone through a second crucifixion you know that this living Christ is alive today and is despised by the world and hated by the world but God Has Lifted him up high and lifted up is this end sign is this this banner and he's in our ins sign Hallelujah and we'll rise to whatever position we need to we'll climb whatever Hill we'll span whatever country we'll cross whatever ocean we'll go up to Every Mountain and cross the mountain ranges whatever is necessary to lift up this end sign and say he's not dead He's Alive Hallelujah and the life of him it's not a piece of cloth but the life of him has come down into me into you as by the Holy Spirit and he I can declare he's alive he represents my country [Music] Hallelujah that's more than Stars and Stripes friends it's more than crosses and emblems different kinds this is our end sign and God sent and a messenger in our time to declare to you he's not in the grave he's alive Hallelujah and to tell us we are citizens of another country our citizenship is not here hallelujah maybe something went through our heart as we saw the different flags of my country some are more patriotic than others but I'll tell you when this when this one comes up that I identify with him identify with this end sign identify with this message to some people perhaps the message doesn't mean anything but when I say the message of the hour it has come here at Great cost and I say this is he identifies he represents my nation he represents my citizenship I have my passport in his country Hallelujah and he will turn he will turn and reveal himself to the people of this next flag sir and they too shall know that this one is their King this one is their end sign also thank you thank you Brothers we're identified with all of its Glory we're here today as part of the human community and as humans were identified with all of the failures of humanity we're identified with Adam and Eve's transgression and their fall we're identified with the deception that took place place in the Garden of Eden we might say well I don't identify it as a human in the human Community we all are marked in our bodies by what happened in Eden because every man every woman every child here is identified by death in a as a human we're dying but as a Son of God we're alive we have eternal life and that eternal life never had a beginning and does not have an end and if we don't have that you're lost hopelessly lost and if you haven't come to the time where you say I switch my allegiance from my country to that ins sign of the word of God hallelujah doesn't mean we reject our country not at all I say that the only real true good CI czen of a country is a born again son or daughter of God we are identified with it we're identified with Adam's transgression and the Bible says for If by if by one man's offense death reigned by one I may be misunderstood and perhaps I may have to even go back and explain some things but the scripture says that death rained rained that's Supremacy by one death became king much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ amen that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord now the believer can say grace is King Hallelujah death was King death reigned by one man and in the human life in the human body we're identified in our body we're marked by his transgression you you can can say this morning as I spoke last Sunday on attribution by attribution you can say I didn't ask for this I didn't ask to be born in a world filled with sin and trouble and Injustice and I didn't I didn't ask to be born in a world that's full of war and our best boys dying on the fields 54 million died in the last second world war 54 million and you never heard it until a prophet came and said the Earth was suffering a birth pain it had a great birth pain in the first world war and men were gasped and laid out on the on the grounds of of the best of all of the countries we're not in we're not here to take up the sight of one against the other or this one against that one it's it's it's sin it's the devil it's death it's is all that comes it's from Satan and the pride of man and the deception of man has cost us a very great price no wonder I mean it it should beat in the heart of every of of any man any woman that even has a basic human intelligence they ought to say whoever started this entire Globe here this little piece of dust that's circling out into the great Universe whoever started it it's time for him to come back it's time for him to correct it all it's time for him to take and burn his ution out of the earth and out of the air and the prophet says and he shall do it and make it a fit dwelling place for himself and his bride Hallelujah I rejoice in that friends it's going to be a whole lot more than an eima Calvary that piece of rock on Calvary where they put the cross of Jesus Christ and hung the Son of God there dying for you and dying for me I tell you that's our end sign the boys fought a bloody battle getting up on top of me with Jer but I'll tell you another one he didn't go with a whole bunch of guns he didn't go with a bunch of ships backing him up he didn't go with dive bombers coming down he walked up there alone Hallelujah he walked up alone God In the Flesh hallu Hallelujah and he would not be deterred from his footsteps those are the blood footsteps that walked up to the Mount Calvary go and there hung alone before a world I tell you my brother my sister that's why you're here we're not here just having Church we're here to say I swear allegiance to the [Music] Lamb with all that I am with all that I can be with all that I have and all that I am I swear allegiance to this one amen hallelujah and the scripture goes on to say nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses death reigned death was King from Adam to Moses why because it was not until Moses when God would raise up this one who was first a prophet with the word in his mouth and come down from Another Mountain sin with the word in his mouth and it says and death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression you might say I didn't sin like Adam sinned I didn't do that I didn't want that but we're identified with it right as humans and the penalty Came Upon Us by attribution I know a little bit about death so do you I've stood by the caskets of too many people I've stood in the in the rooms of too many people that are dying how brother Bram says nothing wants to die animals don't want to die things always are doing everything they can to escape death in the agony of death they don't want to die birds don't want to die nothing wants to die they try to escape it as a man struggles and he says with the death gurgling in his throat striving trying to struggling to just get another breath and live a little bit longer he doesn't want to die but he says the dying tree and the dying flower and the dying man down here only testifies that there's another land where the tree doesn't die and the flower doesn't die and the man the woman doesn't die Hallelujah do you want to go there do you plan to go there have you made your reservations you plan to be there that's why we're here we're not here just having Church we're not here just to have a good time we're certainly not here to be entertained we're here to be a participant in this great body called the body of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ Christ and the message that you say you believe and we've come here in comfort of your car your automobile and come into this into this sanctuary and sit here today in the comfort of this room just remember this message did not come here in that kind of comfort this message came here with a little Prophet you ought to you ought to listen to and and hear a service and just watch where he went the next day and the next day and the next day week in and week out and month in and months out with Harley moment rest for his body and I I can't even imagine knowing what time it takes for me to study and prepare for a service and he's going night after night after night and having the people come forward and and the pulling on him and the visions that are coming till they almost packing him out literally are packing him out that's how this message came didn't come for us to sit and quibble about didn't come for us to sit and try to find some little uh special thing that excludes everybody else that isn't why it came it came so we could include the others Hallelujah and as we did not transgress after Adam's transgression after the similitude of his transgression the penalty of his transgression passed upon all okay what is the way of out what is the answer for this God has made a program and the program happens to be very simple but it is absolute and that program is this God speaks his word god confirms that word as being his word you and I are responsible to believe that word and in the simple Act of believing it God looks down and says you are righteous Hallelujah by my decree you are righteous on this side as an unbeliever by his decree you're a dying human and you're already dead spiritually but by his decree if you simply believe what he said and believe it's his word and say I believe it he declares you're righteous and he he gives you the gift of eternal life though you could never earn it it is that simple some say I want a deep res Revelation that's a deep one that's a deep one because if Satan wants to do anything he'll he'll Sidetrack people get their minds going many a multitude of different directions trying to get you away from the main main uh theme and that theme is do you believe or do you disbelieve as I mentioned last week when God had raised Out of the Dust of the earth you might not youve looked at flags and whatever you thought when your flag came up it it it wouldn't even begin it wouldn't even be a spark of what was in God's mind and heart when he saw all of his creation was made and came up and let the grass bring forth and let the waters bring forth and created Created his Eden and it was so marvelous and then he put his own son there an end sign that this is mine this is mine and it was so wonderful when he had finally took out of the Dust of the earth and raised the dust to its highest position and had one like himself and he came down and had to have fellowship with his son oh and he walked with him I believe there's just something very special in the very mind and heart and bosom of God it's coming now the cool of the day oh I look forward to this time in the cool of the day when I'll be able to go down and fellowship with my son and walk with them in the in the beautiful gardens of paradise and have the trees and the and the uh the birds singing and be there and have Fellowship that was his ins sign and he raised it up this is my standard this is my image and then the image fell the image was worse than spit on the image was disgraced and it was crushed and it no more resembled him the prophet says he went right away I will raise it up again Hallelujah I will rebuild it again I cannot leave it laying down there in the dust I cannot leave it there stepped on I can't leave it there [Applause] dying I will raise it up again and he could only raise it up by finding those that would believe him and Abraham believed God and the scripture says and it was counted to him for righteousness in other words Abraham believed God and God took the attribution of death from him and attributed him with righteousness and said you are as you were supposed to be Hallelujah you're dying you're an old man but I I decree that you are as you were supposed to be as you were int intended to be in my mind in my thoughts we walk again in the paradise of God and all down through the centuries of time came people and God Faithfully in each generation sending his word for his word was his ins sign and the people would look upon the end sign and they would see the ins sign and something would move in their heart say that's that's my country read in this ins sign it spoke these flags can't speak we just have something in our heart because our mind and our memory and our imagination is filled with what it what it represents and we say I'm identified with that representation amen but now was another one and this s sign spoke that I go to prepare a place for you Hallelujah and where I am there you shall be also this IGN speaks this IGN has a voice this n sign had a secret so I'm going to hold the secret till the very end time when I'm ready to call them home to the place that I've got ready for them and then I'm going to come myself I'm going to come oh my friends I'm going to be short this morning even I got so much in my heart but he said I'm going to hold it and this secret only the lamb himself can speak this and can loose it I'm going to I'm going to come to receive them to myself and the prophet says that that was the very Revelation that was the message in hearing the message and receiving it was him receiving you not you receiving him Amen to receive them I will come and receive them to myself and that is when you heard his voice and he drew you to himself Hallelujah he was already receiving you which is part and parcel of his coming Hallelujah that's part of his coming people are waiting to say oh when the Lord comes when the Lord comes he he already has arrived in word form his word coming to speak the word and a group of people will say I don't believe that I can't swallow that but there's another one says and they're CH they're Abraham's children by attribution and they're like their father they're like Abraham I can't understand that I don't understand how my body is going to be changed I don't understand how I'm going to bring forth Christ I'm so [Music] needy he knows that but he attributes his life by attribution I say is there nothing for us to do oh yes of course but our works our works do not bring us any I say zero righteousness his righteousness is because he attributed it to you our works is that what we do because he has because he has loved us because he has saved us we do it out of love we don't do it out of service we do it out of love Hallelujah sin through an inherent sinful nature and death through sin passed upon all and now I'm going to read a number of scriptures and this if you want to follow along it'll be good for you to turn to Romans the 5th chapter we start reading at verse 12 just so it gets really established in your heart wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead understand that for if through the offense of one many be dead the many are dead by attribution they did not sin as as the original Parent did much more the grace of God and the gift of by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned and not as it was by one that Sinn so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is to many offenses unto justification and the people could say amen for If by one man's offense death Reign by one see death became king much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense by of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto to justification of Life hallelujah oh we want to say grace is King let's say it together Grace is king king of my life I Crown thee now my thine let the the glory be king of my life Grace this morning is King remember that not condemnation is King not death is King you say well I am dying I am getting older but Grace is King because who is greater the one who brought the offense or the one who brought the free gift the grace he's the great one and one more verse verse 21 now that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord and to Reign I say grace is King but to Reign it is not only to be king but to exercise kingly power to exercise the highest influence there was a time and you know what there are people who say they are believers say they are Christians but condemnation Reigns in them and I'm not surprised that you're here this morning and you live with condemnation you can never tell me that condemnation makes you feel and have a sense oh I just want to worship God I just want to serve him condemnation doesn't do that condemnation drives you down drives you down and I can tell you that Satan is filled with Glee when he sees you under condemnation and death is King condemnation which came by death which comes by this this uh foul enemy condemnation is a real thing you C you cannot find manic depression in the Bible but you can find condemnation in the Bible and all of these nice terms that they have and they have a uh medicinal uh you know uh the pharmacy the local pharmacy can give you something the local doctor can prescribe something for for this depression I got a name for depression the letter is still D and it's called the devil it is the devil the prophet says You may call it cancer that's a name you give it it is a devil and I respect I respect with all my heart not just what a man was saying said brother brandom said that to me he represented he represented and spoke a word that for my part is the ins sign in the end time Hallelujah and unless you are prepared to hold that ins sign up I mean you you should be prepared even more so than the brave Marines on eima you should be more prepared whatever the cost and whatever it takes and whatever resource whatever energy I have a loyalty in my heart to this one who's hung on Calvary Hallelujah and my allegiance goes to him and if that's not in your heart it's a hypocrisy to say I'm a Christian we're not riding along On Easy Street just to be identified so I'm identified with Bible way you can go straight to hell with that people say I'm identified with Christianity you can go straight to hell still with that on your lips but when you say God has spoken God has sent his word God has confirmed his word God has clearly identified that this is of him that he sent this I say who did this Vindication who did this Vindication in this message who Vindicated this message I wouldn't advise you to do this but I have done it amen I've sat with people that were antagonistic against the servant of God against the prophet of God against his ministry against his message and when I get right into that tight tight time when they're so opposed to it I say to them and I have said it on occasion but I don't recommend unless you've been fully led by the Holy Spirit to do so but I felt I was led and I said well then say that he was of the devil say that this message is of Satan and they becomes silent and I don't let them go brother Ernie I said say it I want you to say it go ahead and say it say this message is of the devil and say this ministry is of the devil and say that he was of the devil and their own silence condemns them Hallelujah they may be very religious and they'll tangle and antagonistic against it but they're afraid but this Prophet wasn't afraid to say your denomination is of the devil your denomination came from Rome it was birthed at n and it's of the devil he wasn't afraid to say what was of Satan and I say today uh before this end sign that's been lifted up in this end time this Vindication was none other than God himself that's why he said he's a mighty God unveiled not veiled not hidden unveiled why unveiled so the people would be forced to look at it this cross that hung on Mount Calvary on that rock pile called gotha and he the prophet said that day The Mercy Seat which was always hidden in the in the holy of holies of the Tabernacle but this day God pulled the veil off and he hung there he said The Mercy Seat was fully exposed and the Bible says they walked by people who never were able to see see The Mercy Seat walked by and looked on The Mercy Seat in full View and Bible says they wagged their heads they thought it was such a failure they thought it was such a a loss he was a good man he was a great teacher what a shame and there was God when they thought all they thought the whole system was collapsing there was God taking off the veil and the seals and say it's in full view the mercy seats in full of view God's ins sign was hanging on Calvary on another pole not eima Mount Goa there came another mountain called Mount Sunset and a redeemed son a SA d a born again a redeemed son had come to maturity and now the time has come a sworn affidavit to the people and a sworn affidavit is a legal document absolutely binding not by some attorney or Not by your attorney or your lawyer not by that but by God himself says I bind myself to this word and he descended with one foot upon the land and one foot that was amongst the people the land and the Sea identify the people it came down amongst the people hallelujah my goodness and declared this is a legal binding document and I have a servant on Earth that's been proven and tested and everything that he spoke has been true true true this is the spirit of Truth he is my ordained vessel predestinated as the last messenger and now I give to the people my binding document and I raise up for them the end sign once again and they still walk by wag their heads it's nice they're nice people kind of funny got some strange ideas but I like them they're nice he was a good man it's a nice message but they have not the wherewithal to understand the legal document the seals how was unveiled and the mercy seats in plain view for all to see not a flag on EA Drea not with a few thousand men laying dead around the cross one man on the cross one man I say one man and he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah our ins sign stands before us today to me it's glorious when you see this picture of the bleeding figure something oh my their emotions get but my emotions just go screaming out oh how glorious is that how glorious is this scene I don't even feel like I'm preaching to you this morning I'm just having my own relationship with him Hallelujah I taken put my arms around that cross for the one that hung there as my end sign in the end time I'm identified with him I'm represented with him with all of it shame and all of it [Applause] Glory my n sign came out of the Tomb my ins sign corruption couldn't take him my ins sign the stone couldn't hold him Hallelujah my ins sign oh I pledge allegiance to him hallelujah what about you young people is he worth your youth is he worth your strength is he worth your energy is he worth your beauty young ladies what is he worth he's worth it all is he worth your job is he worth your business what is he worth everything Hallelujah he's worth everything these boys said it was worth everything they said it's worth it this rock pile is worth it we're going to Dr this flag up these several hundred feet it's worth it it is worth it we couldn't do a lot for it because of our weakness of this flesh which came by attribution I tell you in all honesty if you would ask me brother Ed is your flesh weak everybody's flesh is weak mine is weak the prophet says his biggest biggest problem was himself William brandham your biggest problem is yourself and you got that by attribution the flesh is weak it was weak yesterday it's weak today it'll be weak tomorrow don't say I'll serve him when my flesh gets strong that doesn't work let let Grace come to you by attribution the free gift the free gift say it the free gift say it again the free [Applause] gift he saw you bankrupt he saw you as you have nothing he said you can never do it you can never live the life you can never have it I'm going to deposit it in your account you can't earn it you can't buy it I'm going to deposit it in your account and I'm going to reckon I'm going to impute to your righteousness and I will not impute your sin you say well is this kind of a loose arrangement of Grace not at all before that happens you have to believe amen when you believe he does it amen when you believe oh it's so simple people make it so complicated but it's so simple we're having a baptismal tonight and the brother were baptizing one of our native brothers from Canada he spent about four years in the Marines brother Terry Thomas he's going to be baptized tonight I'm sure when he saw the flag going up in Bima something moved in his heart that was a marine Brother Gary St John was a marine something moves in their heart when they see Oh Glory raised up but in this day in this day something moves in my heart and I see him raised up before the people and that why you see the Prophet The Prophet I tell you what he was so moved he was so moved by his Beauty when he saw him raised up he saw the message being raised up and I can see as I wear his hands on that pool raising it up so the raise it up high on the hill so the people can see people can see far it'll go far and wide and he knew there'd be a company of people I I I'm amazed sometime when he be speaking to just a handful of people and he said these tapes go to the jungles these tapes go around the world you saw there would be people that would come and they would be gather when I saw all those flags go by on the screen and as the brothers were putting it together and I was going over them and saying don't forget this country don't forget that country and we see our flag go up there some may feel a sense I I need to you know I need to salute I need to stand I need to put my hand across my heart but I raising up for you today an ins sign the one that was on calary but the one that is here now the one that's been raised up in this end time and I trust that he becomes so visible to you in word form that you say I give my all I give my all I believe it with all my heart I don't understand it but I believe it with everything that's in me and the life the life from that inside either I'm a liar or this is the truth of God's word the life from that inside will come into you and dwell in you and make you make you one with it we can stand before our flag and say what it is I am amen I'm identified with everything I'm identified with his shame I'm identified with his glory I was there at the Boston tea party I was there with George Washington I was there and yet it all has to Be Imagined but this identification doesn't have to be imagined this identification is a reality this identification is the same spirit that was in him comes into you do you believe it we are one with him amen and if God is dealing with you and speaking to you I would take about one tenth of one second to respond to it I wouldn't I wouldn't wait and say well I'm drafted and I'm pulled and I'm trained before I come up to my this mountain I would say no I'm going to come I give my life I surrender all that I am to him right now and he will pass upon you not death but his righteousness all of his righteousness you didn't get half of Adam's transgression in this flesh you didn't get half of the penalty you're not half dying you are dying not long after you're born you start to die and if time should go on we all perhaps from different countries different cultures different backgrounds we'll all find common ground and it's on a slab in a mortuary or someplace I can tell you friends for the believer that's why you're here right I will not be in that slab and neither will you by God's grace buy a gift by the free gift I will be another place I will be I'll be watching them say it like brother brother uh our brother Marco and brother ricard's grandfather who passed away in a hospital after an operation and I sat with him while he told me what took place and how after his the nurse said to the wife sister uh just forget her name just now but he said to her brother dupy they call brother dupy he said said to her go go go go you need to go and she was working with the tubes in his throat and one of the tubes had come against a part of his body and he wasn't able to get any air and he died right there he wasn't dead for a few moments he was dead for between 12 and 15 minutes so well the brain is completely gone while his wife stood on the other side of the bed he watched the tears form in her eyes described it to the letter and the nurse he saw the nurse working with the tubes in his throat and he stood there he said about the height of the door and he watched her and he thought if this is death this is nothing to be afraid of if this is death wonderful brother wonderful one of the most lovely Believers I I have ever met truste in brother rti's church and S and and when he got to a certain point he said he couldn't know anymore he said to his wife you you know you'll have to fill in your part and when the nurse says you leave now you must leave she stepped out into the passageway of the hospital and one of her two daughters one of the mothers either rickart or or Marco's mother was in the Paul and said come quick Daddy's leaving us and she had written I think on her hand the number of the doctor's cell phone or automobile phone's mobile phone and she went quickly to the pay phone and called the doctor and said said uh duplic op dupc emergency duplic operation emergency and he's on the freeway already has left the hospital he's a miles away on the freeway and at that moment friends nothing s nothing happens by accident at that moment the other attending physician was going on the freeway and he motioned to him like this to go back go back and they both turned around and came back brother dupy saw the doctor get out of his car and he even had some difficulty with the car getting out or whatever it was or or loost in it or something he described the whole scene he's in a brick building right Hallelujah that's the body I want describes the whole thing and the doctor comes running down the passageway and while he's running he's throwing his coat off and the nurse is standing going like this don't don't don't hurry yourself don't bother yourself he's already gone and the next thing brother dupy knows he just comes to sister dupy is patting his cheek saying lovey lovey lovey patting his cheek like that and he just comes alive he says he says to me after that he says brother Ed brother Eddie he calls me brother Eddie he says I'm better now I feel like I'm 21 again and he still lives tonight am what a testimony Hallelujah and the prophet went beyond the curtain of time said in one place said I saw you all there oh I hope he saw me saw millions of people is this a fairy tale this is reality and if it's not it we're living a fairy tale down here this is a passing human parade you like what you see you like what you see on the street in a sad Place trouble everywhere and I won't major on that I'm done I'm done preaching but there is a land there is a land and my my end sign represents that land my ins sign the life of my ins sign represents everything that my soul cries for I love that life Glory hallelujah amen we love everything he represents and I'm I'm proud I'm happy to be identified with its failure what the world considers a failure what the world considers a shame they think it's a shame many in the world think that you sisters are so oppressed I glory in it they think our men are so deprived I glory in it so oh you have such talent and you have such this and you could do this and you could do that we're not interested in it we're not interested in that we're not interested in the biggest church we're not interested in that stuff we're interested in what the kingdom well what's right for the kingdom what's right for my country are you with me am I just using a bunch of energy today or is this touching your soul I close with this it's not a flag it's a life not a flag and let us not have men and women who've devoted their lives to fight for their country put you and I to shame with the allegiance that they have for a country that is passing in off the scene and you and I that are sitting here let us not be put to shame by men and women who belong to some denomination or some organization and they would just serve that thing just night and day I urge you with all that's in me give your best to this Kingdom to this an sign that is raised up in this end time and I'll close with this in 1962 in Phoenix I believe it was brother Brandon preached an N sign and he just what the ins sign was and what it is today and who it is he preached on an end sign he says I've lifted it up before you and he calls the people to prove that that was our ins sign and he tells one after after the other after the other after the other the supernatural truth of indication so that we can sit here today and say oh God how wonderful it is it's without error without a mistake it's truth my ins sign I don't care which flag came up today I don't care which flag you're represented with there isn't a man or woman in the right mind that can stand up and say My Flag represents truth it doesn't the you can put the best men the best woman in the government but the there a system will corrupt them even the prophet said that even men that go into the priesthood or a nun that goes to be a nun and cloer themselves he said they don't go there to be bad people they go there to be good people but the system corrupts them politics corrupt the people politics in the church corrupts people we're not interested in politics we're interested in truth but I can point to my end sign my Christ that's lifted up I can say he is truth all truth there's no error in him there's no weakness in him there's no Frailty in him he deserves amen your allall your all and I would urge you today to give him your all sir and don't hesitate amen give him your all I wonder if we
