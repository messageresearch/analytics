[1:20] one day my father he was about 18 at the
[1:24] time and he was plowing a field in
[1:29] Saskatchewan he was plowing behind the
[1:33] horses and the furrow
[1:36] he was walking in the fresh furrow and
[1:38] he doesn't know what happened but it was
[1:41] he said there was like a wind I would
[1:45] say like a forest like I experienced
[1:49] within brother branham's ministry but
[1:52] this force struck him and he fell to his
[1:56] knees you know in the fresh furrow and
[1:59] he threw up his hands to God and he
[2:05] prayed and he cried out he said O God if
[2:08] there is a God I was an altar boy in the
[2:11] church but he cried out o God if there
[2:15] is a God if you ever show me how I can
[2:18] be free from my guilt my sin I'll accept
[2:24] you that very day my father farmed for a
[2:29] short time near his father's farm and it
[2:32] wasn't working out he didn't feel cut
[2:35] out to farm so they moved he and his
[2:39] young wife and young family I was only
[2:42] about 2 years old and they moved up to a
[2:47] small village only about 150 people I
[2:51] think a village called whitefox
[2:54] Saskatchewan and it was there I'll just
[3:00] make this a little more brief but it was
[3:03] there that my father encountered a
[3:06] family with two daughters with two girls
[3:09] he had seen these girls walk across the
[3:13] street a little gravel street
[3:16] in the town and he saw in their faces
[3:21] they'd look just like angels he thought
[3:23] oh my if I could only have what they
[3:26] have so there was a craving in his heart
[3:28] for reality for deliverance from sin and
[3:33] unbelief and so on and he wanted
[3:36] something more than religion of course a
[3:39] lady in the town heard that he could do
[3:43] some carpenter work so she would needed
[3:47] some shelving or cupboards in her
[3:50] kitchen and had him come over and look
[3:55] at what she wanted done when he was in
[3:59] the house he'd noticed there's the two
[4:01] girls and as he was getting ready to go
[4:06] the lady asked him if he had ever been
[4:10] saved and he said well I don't know what
[4:13] that means
[4:14] she said that means you can be free from
[4:17] your sin oh he said if I could only be
[4:21] free from my sin she said well we're
[4:24] having meetings in a home on Sunday if
[4:28] you'd care to come and she and he said I
[4:32] had promised God years ago if I ever
[4:35] could be free from my guilt I would
[4:38] accepted that very day and as I
[4:41] understand the account she just they
[4:45] knelt at two chairs in that kitchen of
[4:48] that home were those two girls were and
[4:50] my father was he got up a totally
[4:54] transformed person he lived for Christ
[4:58] all of his life and he a matter of fact
[5:02] it was then my mother passed away
[5:07] suddenly when I was only six and a half
[5:11] years old I was in grade two at school
[5:13] and very godly man I think he was
[5:19] probably an old farmer but it was very
[5:21] godly man and I was called out of the
[5:24] room and my sister was standing with him
[5:28] and he said that Jesus had taken my
[5:33] mother to heaven and this was this was
[5:38] the beginning and the end of many things
[5:39] it was it's a very very difficult and
[5:42] very sad story my sister and I we went
[5:48] through from one housekeeper to another
[5:50] to another about four different
[5:52] housekeepers and we had time we were
[5:56] alone and my father was working in
[5:59] alfalfa plant cleaning the bags and so
[6:04] on and we would try to make something to
[6:07] eat and go up there and then my father
[6:10] heard of a lot of work that was taking
[6:13] place in Dawson Creek and the building
[6:15] of the Alaskan Highway just prior to
[6:18] that my father had remarried a very fine
[6:22] Christian woman but she was a completely
[6:26] opposite of what my mother my mother was
[6:28] a very very loving mother and not that
[6:36] this one wasn't
[6:37] but we weren't her children and she was
[6:40] very quiet my mother was outgoing and
[6:43] very you know just very outgoing and
[6:48] this woman was an allele and was her
[6:52] name and she was just a very quiet woman
[6:55] so anyhow our life was completely
[6:59] rearranged and my father went over about
[7:04] a thousand miles west to Dawson Creek
[7:08] and up the Alaskan Highway he was there
[7:12] were camps built all over the highway
[7:14] and you have to understand that the
[7:17] Alaskan highway was a war project the
[7:21] Japanese were invading up the Aleutian
[7:24] Islands had already taken over two of
[7:27] the islands and there's even I
[7:30] understand there's documentaries where
[7:33] the Japanese had taken a 280 tu a two
[7:39] island
[7:40] and that was the thrust if they took
[7:44] Alaska and then northern Canada was
[7:48] really not defended and then if they got
[7:52] down to the 48 states it would it would
[7:57] risk Japan was fighting and they had
[8:02] seized much of Asia and now into China
[8:07] as well Singapore and Hong Kong they'd
[8:12] taken all of that and now if they took
[8:15] they were powerful force and if they
[8:20] came down into the 48 states of mainland
[8:24] America so Canada and the United States
[8:29] joined together and the u.s. built the
[8:34] highway and Canada agreed to maintain it
[8:37] forever and then there would be a land
[8:40] route to get heavy equipment tanks and
[8:43] war equipment into Alaska to defendant
[8:46] that's the purpose of the Alaskan
[8:49] Highway and there were tens of thousands
[8:53] of people and contractors and civilians
[8:56] that were involved in that and so my
[9:00] father moved up there and he was at Mile
[9:04] 4:58 he wrote back and communicated with
[9:09] my stepmother to pack everything up and
[9:12] to come out and we arrived in Dawson
[9:15] Creek at the end of May I won't say
[9:20] perhaps the first of May because my
[9:22] sister whose birthday is May the 6th she
[9:26] had her birthday on the train coming
[9:29] from Edmonton - into Dawson Creek and
[9:32] while we were there this has all
[9:36] happened and you know after my mother
[9:38] passed away everything is just in a
[9:40] turmoil everything fell apart and then I
[9:43] found myself I was sent out to a farm 45
[9:49] miles out of town
[9:50] across the lady peace River or was a
[9:54] tugboat and a little ferry and two
[9:57] people that I didn't know and my the
[10:01] last string I had on earth was my sister
[10:04] and she was she was taken to a place and
[10:09] because the pastor's wife had been
[10:11] arranged to find a place for the two
[10:13] children and my mother already had work
[10:16] up their last good Highway so I didn't
[10:21] have a mother I didn't have a stepmother
[10:24] I didn't have a sister and one was sent
[10:28] one place one is sent another place and
[10:30] I was shifted I never had a home all my
[10:35] all my youth and growing up yours I
[10:38] never had my own room never had my own
[10:40] bed and I moved 17 times from them until
[10:47] the time I was 15
[10:49] so it was a it's a difficult time of my
[10:54] life but I've been asked what prepared
[11:00] you for the mission work and for this
[11:03] gospel it was those years I learned that
[11:10] what the wilderness was little did I
[11:13] realized that years later I would have
[11:15] God's prophet up there and he loved that
[11:20] area and it was wilderness and that's
[11:24] all I knew really so my father them in
[11:33] 1949 he felt to move to southern British
[11:38] Columbia and on the way down he would
[11:42] stop because here but he would have such
[11:45] a experience with God and was interested
[11:50] in anything that God was doing in fact
[11:53] is he stopped in the meetings and he had
[11:56] heard that William Branham was going to
[11:58] be in Vernon British Columbia and that
[12:01] is where my contact
[12:03] I began with him in fact is I have a
[12:08] letter I should perhaps just read this
[12:11] letter just a portion of this is my
[12:18] father's account of the meetings in
[12:21] Vernon we found this
[12:22] I think after my father passed away in
[12:26] his Saints and he's writing a minister
[12:30] and he's writing about the news of our
[12:33] beloved brother Branham passing away he
[12:37] said came as a with a shocking surprise
[12:41] to me the loss of him cannot be
[12:45] estimated in words now he is resting in
[12:48] peace but his work is going on and his
[12:53] memory is cherished in the hearts of
[12:56] thousands in the world but he was
[12:59] writing about the meeting in Vernon
[13:03] British Columbia that was my first time
[13:06] [Music]
[13:07] finally he said brother Branham looked
[13:10] at a poorly clad mother with a crippled
[13:14] child in her arms he asked that the way
[13:19] be made for this poor mother to come
[13:23] forward never had I ever seen such a
[13:27] bundle of twisted bones thought this was
[13:32] a totally impossible case brother
[13:35] Branham took the child in his arms and
[13:39] lifted it up for the people to see it
[13:43] there were tears and moans and sobs
[13:46] heard all around the place then he said
[13:51] people do you see how the demons have
[13:54] twisted the whole body of this child and
[13:58] are holding it bound I will not let this
[14:02] child go until all these demons are cast
[14:06] out and the child is perfectly whole
[14:09] with great Authority he commanded the
[14:13] demons to come to come out of
[14:16] Oh in Jesus name after several commands
[14:20] that demons came out and before the eyes
[14:25] of that great crowd the bones were made
[14:29] straight his arms legs neck and back all
[14:35] became straight and the child lifted
[14:38] himself up with a smile on its face you
[14:42] should have heard there's the arena or
[14:47] the arena ring with the praises of
[14:51] thousands as they saw the mighty
[14:54] miracles of God done in the name of
[14:57] Jesus Christ praise God forever now
[15:03] that's my father's unsolicited but he
[15:06] did not know what was happening to me I
[15:10] was just with a series of young fellows
[15:15] that's where I first met Billy Paul when
[15:17] fight and we were in our teens and I was
[15:24] I was caught by this that brother
[15:29] branham was a man had had talked to an
[15:32] angel and an angel had come to him and
[15:35] told him he would take a ministry of
[15:37] healing now I was familiar with Sunday
[15:41] School with church I knew the Bible
[15:45] spoke of angels I had never ever laid
[15:48] eyes on a person who had talked to God
[15:52] in that way he talked to her an angel of
[15:55] God and so I was anxious to see him come
[15:59] out and he came out said good evening
[16:02] people good evening friends and he began
[16:06] to speak and after two or three days I
[16:10] felt I've got to get down where I
[16:12] shouldn't say this I'm I have no
[16:16] interest in being up in the hind the
[16:18] bleachers anymore I didn't have any more
[16:20] interest in just being with the fellows
[16:23] and I got a seat I don't know how to
[16:27] this day I got a seat right on
[16:30] the aisle one chair just closed two or
[16:34] three rolls from the front and in that
[16:38] service I can't tell you what was spoken
[16:41] I can't tell you of anyone else but
[16:46] there was a girl and I would say the
[16:49] girl was probably around 10 to 12 years
[16:54] old she had ringlets down to her
[16:58] shoulders and kind of a full faced girl
[17:02] but her eyes were just white balls and I
[17:07] noticed right up I was that close to the
[17:11] platform I just right in the corner of
[17:15] the eye I see just a little part a
[17:20] little part of the ball the ball of the
[17:24] eye the edge of the eye and the other
[17:27] eye I could see nothing just white and I
[17:32] was as far as I was concerned and and
[17:37] she was totally blind brother branham
[17:41] laid his hands on her and he prayed a
[17:44] prayer and I thought in my young heart I
[17:47] thought well I've heard about you know
[17:49] these things now now here's something I
[17:53] can actually see I can see this and I
[17:57] was anxious to see someone healed
[18:00] because I had so many experiences in
[18:03] churches and so on where people were
[18:06] prayed for for internal sicknesses and
[18:11] you're healed but now is something I
[18:14] could see visibly and brother Branham
[18:18] prayed the second time and she was the
[18:21] same and he prayed the third time fourth
[18:24] time fifth time and he keep looking at
[18:27] her and she was the same brother Brown
[18:31] prays six times and he did something I
[18:34] have never and prayed a prayer I've
[18:36] never heard before and he took and put
[18:39] his arms around her
[18:41] like that and just kind of held her to
[18:44] his bosom and he said Satan an angel
[18:50] from God and delivered this gift to me
[18:54] and told me that nothing would stand
[18:57] before my prayers not even cancer if I
[19:01] could get the people to believe he said
[19:03] the people are here and they believe and
[19:08] I charge you in the name of the Living
[19:12] God
[19:13] to lose her and let her go at that time
[19:17] he did not look at her anymore he just
[19:20] turned her it took her by the shoulders
[19:21] and turned her to the audience and I was
[19:24] just two three rows away I think I was
[19:29] in the third row and I looked up and her
[19:31] eyes were as straight as mine and then
[19:34] he lifted her up like this and the cries
[19:38] of the people I didn't know that my
[19:41] mother and dad or my stepmother and dad
[19:44] were in today where they were in the
[19:46] building but that was my experience this
[19:49] was my father's experience and and I
[19:53] could even see the tears form in her
[19:57] eyes as she looked at the bright lights
[20:00] she wasn't accustomed to the bright
[20:02] lights and she looking at the bright
[20:04] lights and there and then he put her
[20:07] down and and that anchored in my heart
[20:11] at 14 years old
[20:22] you
[20:25] [Applause]
[20:31] [Music]
[20:40] you
