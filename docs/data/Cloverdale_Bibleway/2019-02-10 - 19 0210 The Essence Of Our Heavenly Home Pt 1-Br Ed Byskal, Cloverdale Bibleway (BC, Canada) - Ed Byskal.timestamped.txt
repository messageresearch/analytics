[0:00] Holy, [music and singing] holy,
[0:02] we cry. Holy, holy,
[0:06] holy [music]
[0:09] we cry. Holy, holy,
[0:13] holy [music]
[0:15] is the lamb.
[0:18] [music]
[0:21] 9:38 on the screen. God bless you this
[0:24] morning. [music] Welcome to the house of
[0:26] the Lord, brother Kyle. Sister
[0:27] Christina, God bless you. Wonderful day
[0:29] yesterday. Amen. Beautiful wedding.
[0:33] Wonderful people smiling. You should
[0:34] have seen your faces. I was streaming.
[0:36] [music] I got to watch it on the
[0:37] internet. Your faces. It maybe wasn't
[0:40] you guys. They lit up when the bride
[0:42] [music] walked down the aisle. I said to
[0:44] my wife, "Wow,
[0:46] that's incredible. Look at the smiles."
[0:50] Sunday [music] morning, I guarantee you
[0:51] it's going to be just like that.
[0:54] And you're smiling. I got you going.
[0:56] Amen. The Lord loves you this morning.
[0:59] Amen. [music] He's allowed us to be in
[1:01] church. We're a free people.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Freedom of religion. There's countries
[1:06] where they can't do this. We appreciate
[1:08] the opportunity that we have to be here
[1:10] with [music] you this morning. We'll
[1:11] just sing a couple of songs. Brother
[1:13] Daniel Andy's son is here, William. He's
[1:15] going to come [music] and bless us with
[1:16] a special here in a few minutes. And our
[1:18] pastor is going to minister this
[1:20] morning. So, it's shaping up to be a
[1:22] great day.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Jesus
[1:26] said, "If I be lifted up,
[1:33] I will surely [singing]
[1:36] draw men [music]
[1:38] unto me."
[1:42] Oh, as [singing] Moses [music]
[1:45] raised a serpent
[1:47] in the wilderness,
[1:51] so high [music]
[1:53] lifted up
[1:55] Jesus.
[1:57] [music]
[2:01] See him all [singing] across his [music]
[2:04] eyes of love.
[2:09] Looking [music] down
[2:12] stood and watched his
[2:16] [music]
[2:18] [singing] walked
[2:20] and his worship. [music] God turned his
[2:24] eyes away.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [singing]
[2:30] Eternal.
[2:36] I [music and singing] lift it up a
[2:41] sior. [music]
[2:45] I lift it up for all to [music] see.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:54] &gt;&gt; reconcileing
[2:56] God and forever. [music]
[3:02] I [music] lift it [singing] up on
[3:05] Calary.
[3:11] Jesus [music] said, "I'll surely come
[3:14] [singing] again."
[3:18] That wherever [music and singing] I
[3:21] believe, you will be near. [music]
[3:27] So I look toward the heavens,
[3:32] unto the eastern sky [music]
[3:36] where I [singing] lift it up. He shall
[3:41] hear [music]
[3:45] if [music] he arrive
[3:54] [music]
[3:55] angels start to sing.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:03] &gt;&gt; to be a [singing] holy man.
[4:08] [music and singing]
[4:10] I lift it up. We see [music]
[4:14] the king.
[4:19] I [music and singing] lift it up in all
[4:23] his glory. [music]
[4:27] I lift it [music] up.
[4:36] [music]
[4:38] Great [singing]
[4:39] forever.
[4:43] [music] I lift it up is Jesus Christ.
[4:50] I lift it up. I [music] lift it up in
[4:55] all his glory.
[5:00] I [music]
[5:01] lift it up in rose.
[5:08] He's [music and singing] coming back Jer
[5:12] forever.
[5:14] [music]
[5:17] I [singing] lift it up is Jesus Christ.
[5:22] [music]
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Through the fire. Through [music] the
[5:27] fire. Number 1053
[5:29] on the screen.
[5:33] So many [singing] times [music] I've
[5:36] questioned
[5:38] certain circumstances
[5:41] or [music] things I could not
[5:44] understand.
[5:48] Oh, [music and singing] when many times
[5:51] in trials
[5:53] and weakness blurs my vision
[5:57] and my [music] frustration gets so out
[6:00] of hand.
[6:04] It's then I am reminded [music]
[6:08] I've never been forsaken.
[6:12] Oh, I've [singing] never had to stand
[6:15] one [music]
[6:16] test.
[6:17] Are you thankful for that? As I look at
[6:21] all [music and singing] the victory,
[6:24] the spirit rises up in me [music]
[6:27] and it's through the fire of my
[6:30] weakness.
[6:31] [music]
[6:36] He promised that his cross would not get
[6:40] [music and singing] heavy
[6:42] and he would not be our
[6:47] [music]
[6:51] he never offered [music]
[6:53] our victory without fight. He said your
[6:58] will
[7:00] come in time. [music]
[7:04] Just remember when you're standing
[7:08] in the valley [music and singing]
[7:09] of decision
[7:12] and the adversary stand
[7:16] [music]
[7:19] [singing]
[7:21] [music]
[7:27] you
[7:30] again.
[7:31] [music]
[7:34] I know within [singing]
[7:36] myself that I would surely perish.
[7:39] [music]
[7:41] But if [singing] I trust the hand of
[7:43] God, he'll [music] shield the flame
[7:46] [singing]
[7:47] of
[7:50] the again.
[7:53] [music]
[7:54] He never promised that the cross [music]
[7:58] would not be [singing] heavy
[8:01] for you would not be
[8:05] [music]
[8:09] in [singing]
[8:11] our [music] danger without
[8:15] [singing]
[8:19] [music]
[8:22] just remember and [music and singing]
[8:24] standing
[8:26] in the valley of decision
[8:29] and [music]
[8:31] [singing]
[8:34] what you're going to do
[8:38] [music]
[8:40] will show [singing]
[8:43] and he will take you to the fire [music]
[8:47] again. He never promised. [singing]
[8:51] [music]
[8:52] He never promised that the cross would
[8:56] not [singing] get
[9:00] [music]
[9:03] sing this morning. Oh, [music] he never
[9:07] offered
[9:09] our victory without [music and singing]
[9:11] fighting. But he said would always come.
[9:15] [music]
[9:16] [singing]
[9:19] Just remember when [music] you're
[9:21] standing [singing]
[9:23] in the valley of decision [music]
[9:27] and the adversary [singing]
[9:29] stand
[9:31] [music]
[9:37] will show up
[9:40] and he [music] will take you through the
[9:43] fire again.
[9:46] [music]
[9:47] Just hold [singing]
[9:48] on.
[9:51] Our Lord will show [music and singing]
[9:52] up
[9:54] and he will take you through [music] the
[9:58] fire [singing] again.
[10:04] Hallelujah.
[10:06] Amen. These are the days of Elijah.
[10:08] [music]
[10:09] The word of the Lord.
[10:12] These are [singing] the days of Elijah.
[10:17] declaring the word of the Lord. We've
[10:21] [music] heard the voice and we heard
[10:24] [singing] the voice of the
[10:28] [music] angel of righteousness.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[10:36] &gt;&gt; And all these [singing] are days of
[10:38] great trial.
[10:42] [music and singing]
[10:47] Till we heard the [music and singing]
[10:49] voice in the desert, crying, prepare
[10:54] [music]
[10:55] [singing] the way of
[10:59] height.
[11:02] [music and singing]
[11:05] Happy
[11:08] [music and singing]
[11:13] is the year [music] of
[11:17] our
[11:18] [singing]
[11:19] salvation.

[11:27] your [music]
[11:29] all the trials be coming as
[11:36] these are [music and singing] the days
[11:38] of your servant Elijah rebuilding
[11:42] [singing] the altar [music] of gra.

[15:52] Want to go to prayer that at this time,
[15:54] Brother Kyle, we miss you when you're
[15:56] not here. We're so happy to have you
[15:58] when you are here. Would you [music]
[15:59] come pray with the congregation this
[16:01] morning?
[16:10] Brother Luis and [music] Sister
[16:11] Elizabeth Diaz write in. They want to
[16:14] thank the Lord Jesus [music] for his
[16:16] wonderful love poured out upon us
[16:19] through his precious saints. All of the
[16:21] prayers and the kind words have blessed
[16:23] us [music] so much.
[16:25] Brother Luis is doing very well. He has
[16:27] two more weeks of radiation and [music]
[16:29] chemo and then and then surgery after
[16:32] that. God is in control. [music]
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to continue to hold him up
[16:38] in our prayers this morning.
[16:41] If you have a need upon your heart, you
[16:42] just desire [music] that the Lord would
[16:43] minister to you this morning as we pray.
[16:48] All right, let's pray together.
[16:50] Precious Lord Jesus, we love you. We're
[16:53] so thankful to be here this morning.
[16:55] We're excited to not just to hear about
[16:57] the heavenly bridegroom, Lord, but to
[16:59] have fellowship with you, Lord. Jesus
[17:02] just was pondering how much you love us,
[17:04] Lord. And it's hard for us to comprehend
[17:06] being the earthly bride. But you love us
[17:08] exactly as we are, Lord, with our hinder
[17:10] parts, our weaknesses, our fears,
[17:13] whatever we have, Lord. You love us,
[17:15] Lord Jesus. You did not marry a bride
[17:17] that you did not know about us. You know
[17:19] everything about us, Lord. And we're so
[17:21] thankful we don't have to hide nothing
[17:22] from you, Lord. We don't got to be
[17:24] ashamed of our lives. Lord, we can
[17:26] express that we're so grateful that
[17:28] you've changed us. You've transformed
[17:29] us. Lord, you have a plan for our loved
[17:31] ones. You have a plan for this day.
[17:33] Lord, you have a plan for the future,
[17:35] Lord Jesus. I pray you help us realize
[17:37] that greater are you than we could ever
[17:40] imagine. Father, you are brother
[17:42] Louise's healer, Lord Jesus. May just
[17:44] continue to do a work in his life. Lord,
[17:47] that home has been so open, Lord. So
[17:49] loving, such an example. Oh Lord Jesus,
[17:52] pour into [music] them. Everybody here,
[17:54] Lord, I'm sure we have a request in our
[17:56] heart. And Lord, you're mindful. You
[17:58] care. Lord, you're the one who's not
[18:00] only able to break bread to everyone,
[18:02] you're able to touch our needs, pour in
[18:04] faith. Lord Jesus, I just pray you'd
[18:07] help us all today. Help us just all be
[18:10] able to relax in your presence. May you
[18:12] strengthen Brother Ed, use him as a
[18:14] vessel, Lord Jesus. May he just feel
[18:16] that liberty, Lord. I just pray you help
[18:19] us all, Lord. May we surrender any
[18:21] preconceived ideas of how service should
[18:24] go. And Lord, just have fellowship with
[18:26] you. Sometimes you do things so
[18:27] different than we could expect. Lord, we
[18:30] just expect you, Lord, to come and open
[18:32] the word, Lord Jesus. I just pray you
[18:34] help all of our hearts. Help us [music]
[18:36] be pulling. And Lord, may we be changed,
[18:39] transformed, Lord, in our minds, and our
[18:42] bodies, and our spirits. [music] Lord,
[18:43] we just commit the whole day into your
[18:45] hands. Help us not worry about snow.
[18:46] Help us not worry about ice or wind.
[18:48] Help us just have fellowship with you.
[18:50] We just commit the whole day in this
[18:52] service into your hands in Jesus name.
[18:54] Amen.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God [music] bless you each and
[18:58] everyone as you have your seats. The
[19:00] deacons received the offering this
[19:01] morning and tithes. Certainly appreciate
[19:04] them. We do want to make a couple of
[19:07] quick announcements. God bless you
[19:08] brother Glenn. Young people's service

[19:14] whether cooperating of course um be in
[19:17] touch with brother Michael Andy's or

[19:20] questions as Friday approaches certainly
[19:22] look forward to nice young peoples had a
[19:25] wonderful day yesterday we have lots of
[19:27] visitors with us so if you're still

[19:57] Rachel Waldner were married and brother
[19:59] Tom Ray did a wonderful job and it was
[20:02] just a wonderful day. And on behalf of

[20:27] bless you very much.
[20:34] Amen. Good to be with you all this
[20:36] morning. I bring greetings from my dad,
[20:39] Daniel Andes, and my pastor, brother
[20:41] Brad Burgess.
[20:43] And uh I was just reading this quote. It
[20:45] said, [music] and I want to take my
[20:47] subject this morning on this. How can I
[20:49] overcome? Now, I chose [music] this
[20:52] because I think that it's a time that we
[20:54] should never let the spirit of revival
[20:55] die. We've got to keep in revival,
[20:58] constantly revived every day. Paul said
[21:01] he had to die daily that Christ could
[21:03] [music] live. And we must never let that
[21:05] revival die within us.
[21:08] I just want to encourage you this
[21:09] morning. Never let the revival die. Keep
[21:12] in the spirit of revival until the Lord
[21:14] Jesus Christ comes. [music]
[21:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[21:27] &gt;&gt; As we get [singing] older in our lives,
[21:30] we see a lot of compromise. [music]
[21:33] People we thought is strong [singing]
[21:34] back then have faded away to a worldly
[21:37] trend. Some say God's dead and he's
[21:39] passed away. But to my Christian [music]
[21:40] friends, I [singing] say,
[21:44] let's keep revival.
[21:47] No matter [music and singing] what it
[21:48] costs, keep reliable.
[21:52] Even if there's loss, [music] our God is
[21:55] still the same today. He will never pass
[21:59] away. [music]
[22:01] So keep revival.
[22:04] [singing]
[22:06] [music]
[22:10] [music]
[22:11] We can't let this world break us down or
[22:14] get our minds [singing] turned around.
[22:17] Working through the [music] daily time,
[22:19] we ask God to keep our steps in line.
[22:22] His truth is [music] the same [singing]
[22:23] today. And we feel him when we pray.
[22:28] So [music] keep revival.
[22:31] No matter what it cost, [music] keep
[22:33] [singing] revival.
[22:36] Even if there's loss, [music] our God is
[22:39] still the same [singing] today. He will
[22:42] never pass [music] away.
[22:45] So keep revival.
[22:48] [singing]
[22:53] [music]
[22:55] Well, the Holy Ghost is for a chosen
[22:57] few. It doesn't matter what the world
[23:00] may do. Jesus paid and [singing] pulled
[23:02] our part and his fire [music] can warm
[23:05] our heart. God can touch you in the pew.
[23:08] Alone with him, [music] he fills me and
[23:10] you. Brother and sister, keep revival.
[23:15] No matter what it costs, [music]
[23:17] keep revival. [singing]
[23:20] Even if there's a loss, our [music] God
[23:23] is still the same today. He will never
[23:26] pass away. [music]
[23:29] So keep revival.
[23:32] No matter what it costs,
[23:34] [singing and music]
[23:34] keep revival.
[23:37] Even if there's a loss, our [music] God
[23:40] is still the same today. He will never
[23:43] [singing] pass away.
[23:46] So [music] keep revival.
[23:53] [music]
[23:56] [singing]
[23:57] [music]
[23:58] Let's keep revival.
[24:03] Let's keep revival. [music]
[24:06] No matter what it costs, keep revival.
[24:10] [music and singing]
[24:11] Oh, even if there's loss, our God is
[24:14] still the same today. [singing]
[24:16] He will never pass away. [music]
[24:20] Don't keep revival. [singing]
[24:26] [singing]
[24:27] [music]
[24:32] Let's keep [singing] revival.
[24:39] [applause]
[24:46] Praise the Lord.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:50] Well, we should turn the service to our
[24:51] pastor. I think it'd be real nice. Why
[24:54] don't we sing together Standing on the
[24:55] Promises of Christ our King [music] as
[24:57] we invite Brother Ed to come this
[24:59] morning. Would you like to stand? Amen.
[25:03] Change our positions a little bit.

[26:31] can see. There is perfect cleansing in
[26:35] the blood [singing] for me. Standing
[26:38] [music]
[26:38] in the liberty where Christ made free.
[26:42] I'm standing [music]
[26:43] on the promises [singing] of God.

[28:44] me.
[28:47] Sing.
[28:55] [music]
[28:59] [singing]
[29:02] [music]
[29:04] If you just want to slip your hand up to
[29:06] him
[29:08] who
[29:10] [music and singing]
[29:14] walks [music]
[29:15] beside me [singing]
[29:19] to hold [music]
[29:20] my hand [singing]
[29:24] [music] and say
[29:26] guide
[29:31] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[29:34] &gt;&gt; will [music] always

[29:39] [music and singing] Oh, I afraid.
[29:45] He [music] is [singing] to me. He knows
[29:48] the way. He knows [singing]
[29:51] the [music] way.
[29:55] My love is windy. [music]
[30:00] He [singing] can see around
[30:05] my [music]

[30:10] He'll [music] take me through
[30:16] and take [music]
[30:18] and
[30:20] [singing]
[30:20] oh what a friend
[30:25] [music] he is to me. [singing] He knows
[30:29] the way. He knows [music]
[30:32] the way. [singing]
[30:34] He knows my way. I know [music]
[30:38] when
[30:41] he can [music and singing] see around.
[30:47] [music and singing]
[30:49] &gt;&gt; He'll take me through.
[30:52] [music]
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a promise we have.
[30:56] When [music] days
[30:59] ending,
[31:01] [singing] oh what a great
[31:06] [music]
[31:07] he is to [singing] be as our pastor
[31:11] comes. Oh, what a friend.
[31:15] [music and singing]
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Who was beside me?
[31:24] Hold my hand [music]
[31:28] as [singing]
[31:30] I
[31:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:35] &gt;&gt; is
[31:39] always [singing]
[31:44] [music]
[31:50] [music]
[31:55] I'd like to have you sing in faith.
[31:59] He [music] came to me.
[32:01] Make it present right now. He came to me
[32:05] when I couldn't come to him.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; He came to me.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Derek, you're going [music] to
[32:11] lead us.
[32:13] He came to me.
[32:18] [music]
[32:20] He came
[32:23] to me
[32:25] [music]
[32:27] when I could not [singing] come.
[32:31] to where he was. [music]
[32:34] He [singing] came to me
[32:40] and that's why he died
[32:46] on [music and singing]
[32:47] Calary.
[32:50] [music and singing]
[32:53] When I could come
[32:57] to where he was, [music]
[33:00] he [singing] came to me.
[33:05] We'll bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly
[33:07] Father,
[33:09] we are unspeakably thankful
[33:13] &gt;&gt; that you came to us.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Some of us in our workplace, some of us
[33:19] from a neighbor,
[33:22] but there was something spoken,
[33:24] something said that responded to that
[33:27] deep, deep call. And we know if there's
[33:31] a deep, there's a deep to respond.
[33:34] We pray, Father, [music] that that deep
[33:37] that's within each heart will be lifted
[33:41] up to you in faith. You are my father.
[33:46] You know exactly what I have need of.
[33:49] And you're Jehovah Gyra. You're the God
[33:52] that provides.
[33:54] You've provided something for us,
[33:57] something for me.
[33:59] this morning [music] and we pray that
[34:01] you will bless this day and all the
[34:04] activities of it. We pray, Father, you
[34:07] will remember each one that has been to
[34:11] the ceremony yesterday. [music] And what
[34:14] a wonderful word we heard and such
[34:17] instruction to the young couple. We pray
[34:21] you'll bless them, oh God. Brother
[34:24] Nathan, Sister Rachel, [music] in Jesus
[34:27] Christ's name. And now bless us together
[34:30] as we approach your word. Let the Holy
[34:32] Spirit be the director [music]
[34:35] &gt;&gt; of the meeting. We pray in Jesus name.
[34:38] Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Nice to see each
[34:42] one of you. And I would like if you
[34:45] would turn in the Bible.
[34:49] I want to I want to read a few verses
[34:52] out of Revelation 21.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[34:58] &gt;&gt; And before we read, I will just mention
[35:01] out of the
[35:03] uh the message book which I had asked
[35:08] if possible that you might be able to
[35:10] read
[35:12] uh the future home
[35:15] of the heavenly bridegroom
[35:18] and the earthly bride.
[35:21] And incidentally, I'm happy to see each
[35:24] one of you that are here. And some of
[35:27] you may struggle with my terminology or
[35:31] my English language, but we I just pray
[35:34] that you will that God will assist you
[35:38] and help you to understand. And and
[35:41] really I want to say at the very
[35:43] beginning
[35:44] even our language our English language
[35:48] some of you speak Chinese some of you
[35:51] speak your mother tongue is perhaps
[35:53] French
[35:55] uh and there's a difference even in the
[35:57] English language but we don't have a
[36:00] language to fit this. Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; I don't have a language to fit the
[36:09] heavenly home.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet didn't have a language to
[36:14] fit the heavenly home.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we need to have
[36:20] uh arrangement within our minds to say
[36:24] well there may be words that I don't
[36:26] really understand or the word that you
[36:30] understand
[36:32] for that in the English language. It may
[36:35] not mean that and so [clears throat] I
[36:39] just pray that God will give us
[36:41] understanding. And if you have read the
[36:44] message book, well, uh,
[36:48] that would only assist you, but it
[36:50] doesn't give you necessarily a
[36:53] revelation of it of it. And that's
[36:55] really what we have to have.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Um, now the prophet of God, as he was
[37:01] approaching this subject, he took three
[37:04] scriptures.
[37:06] He spoke from
[37:08] second Peter 3. I'm not going to read
[37:11] all of these.
[37:14] Second Peter 3:1-18.
[37:18] And Peter speaks of the process.
[37:22] The process by which things will take
[37:25] place. [clears throat] We know that
[37:28] there had to be some kind of a process
[37:31] for grass to grow and the seasons to
[37:34] take place and the snow and the cold.
[37:37] and we're happy we're not in some places
[37:41] uh this morning. Uh but you know, things
[37:45] are different. But there was a process
[37:48] that brought us to where we are. There's
[37:50] a process.
[37:52] You were born in a certain family. You
[37:55] were born in a certain land.
[37:57] It had nothing to do with you. And you
[38:01] realize that had nothing to do with you.
[38:04] Some of you were born in a colony. Some
[38:06] of you were born in a a home that didn't
[38:10] care anything about God. And then you
[38:13] came across it and something spoke to
[38:17] you and said, "Well," and and you became
[38:20] attracted maybe when you didn't even
[38:22] know what you were attracted to.
[38:25] And uh I had a
[38:28] son-in-law and he once said to me, he
[38:31] said, [clears throat]
[38:33] "You know, if we knew that we had to go
[38:36] through all this,
[38:38] we may maybe wouldn't even started." He
[38:40] said, "God kind of deceived us into it
[38:46] because we didn't really know what we
[38:48] were getting into." But then we get into
[38:50] this and we have battles and struggles
[38:53] along the ways and say, "Well, whoa, I
[38:55] never knew this was going to happen."
[38:59] Well, I know I see you smiling because
[39:02] that's been your story, too.
[39:05] But nevertheless, God knew.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Nothing surprises him.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly where you are and the struggles
[39:12] you have and the battles you have and
[39:15] oh, he knew all of that.
[39:18] So I want to and then he reads
[39:21] Revelation 21 where we're going to read
[39:25] 217
[39:29] and then he reads uh later on in the in
[39:32] the message
[39:35] uh Isaiah 65
[39:39] 17- 25
[39:41] and that is and in and I'll just be
[39:44] perfectly frank and honest with you.
[39:47] I've preached for many years. I've
[39:50] wondered about Isaiah
[39:53] and I've wondered about, you know, there
[39:55] are certain things. How does a child die
[40:00] when he's, you know, I'll make all
[40:02] things new. And the child dies when he's
[40:06] 100 years old or something. And I I
[40:08] understand that. And and the prophet
[40:11] just answers that in one line. He says
[40:13] it's the it's the millennium.
[40:16] He says Isaiah speaks of the millennium.
[40:19] So [clears throat]
[40:20] Peter speaks of the future home. I'll
[40:24] make all things new and the heavens and
[40:27] the earth will pass away. And he said
[40:30] now it's I thought that was strange that
[40:32] would pass away [snorts] and still over
[40:35] here they'll build houses and they'll
[40:37] live in them and so on and so forth and
[40:40] everything will pass away.
[40:42] And he says it's the millennium and
[40:44] we're still in time at that at that
[40:48] time. The millennium is still a period
[40:50] of time and it's not that it is not he
[40:54] said the new heaven and the new earth.
[40:57] And so these are just little things I'm
[41:00] dropping in as we go through. So we'll
[41:04] read please and then you can have your
[41:06] seats. Revelation 21
[41:10] starting at verse one.
[41:13] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[41:18] for the first heaven
[41:20] and the first earth were passed away
[41:25] and we'll come on to that a little
[41:27] later. And there was no more sea.
[41:31] And I, John, saw the holy city from uh
[41:36] New New Jerusalem,
[41:38] the the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
[41:42] down from God out of heaven, prepared as
[41:46] a bride adorned for her husband. And I
[41:50] heard a great voice out of heaven,
[41:53] saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is
[41:57] with men, and he will dwell with them,
[42:02] and they shall be his people, and God
[42:06] himself shall be with them, and be their
[42:10] God.
[42:11] And God shall wipe away all tears from
[42:15] their eyes.
[42:17] And there shall be no more death,
[42:21] neither
[42:23] sorrow,
[42:24] nor crying,
[42:27] neither shall there be any more pain,
[42:31] for the former things are passed away.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that sat upon the throne
[42:37] said, "Behold, I make all things new."
[42:41] We can say amen to that, can't we? I
[42:44] don't care who we are. We've been
[42:46] touched by some pain. We've been touched
[42:49] by something that caused some tears.
[42:52] We've been touched by some sorrow. We've
[42:55] been touched by something of this earth
[42:59] and of this birth. And there's something
[43:02] within us that cries out, "Oh God,
[43:06] there's something in me crying out for
[43:08] this new heaven and this new earth."
[43:12] &gt;&gt; And God knows that and he sent a message
[43:15] to you.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; So we want to read on.
[43:20] And he that sat upon the throne said,
[43:23] "Behold, I make all things new." And he
[43:27] said unto me, "Write, for these words
[43:32] are true and faithful." And he said unto
[43:37] me, "It is done. I am Alpha and Omega,
[43:42] the beginning and the end. I will give
[43:45] unto him that is a thirst of the
[43:50] fountain of the water of life freely.
[43:54] He that overcomemeth shall inherit all
[43:57] things, and I will be his God, and he
[44:02] shall be my son.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[44:22] I I want wish to speak to you this
[44:24] morning
[44:26] on this subject. The essence [snorts]
[44:31] of our heavenly home. Now perhaps you
[44:34] have not heard the word essence very
[44:37] many times. Actually the prophet uses it
[44:39] several times.
[44:41] But I want to go into the depths of
[44:45] this.
[44:47] What is the heavenly home and the
[44:49] essence of the heavenly home and the
[44:52] essence of our home that's down here?
[44:58] The essence of our home
[45:01] uh and and what that word would mean.
[45:06] Now
[45:10] I have some slides prepared and I'm
[45:14] going to
[45:16] going to put the first two up.
[45:22] The brother Brandham says, "Let's pray
[45:24] again. Lord Jesus with such a promise
[45:29] and such stern stern talk as Jesus
[45:33] himself and the apostle has given us
[45:37] concerning
[45:38] the hour we are approaching.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Give us oh Lord of thy direction that we
[45:48] might know how to approach it. We are
[45:54] approaching
[45:55] certain things that we haven't never
[45:58] approached before.
[46:00] And now we want to know also how we must
[46:04] approach it
[46:06] in the right way because it's coming.
[46:13] We know the scriptures must be fulfilled
[46:16] and so shall it be. And now, Lord, we
[46:20] ask your mercy uh again upon us as we
[46:24] study thy word. Be with us and unfold it
[46:29] to us, Lord. For we ask it in Jesus'
[46:32] name. Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; And here's the three phrases
[46:38] concerning the hour.
[46:41] We are approaching. You don't know what
[46:44] lies just ahead.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you, you'll need courage.
[46:49] You'll need wisdom.
[46:52] Uh you that are parents will need wisdom
[46:55] to bring up your children beyond
[46:58] childhood
[46:59] into teenage years. And and you'll face
[47:04] things and you'll say, "My, I didn't
[47:06] dream I was going to face this." I don't
[47:09] say it's bad. It may it may be
[47:11] wonderful. It may be good. You may have
[47:14] one one child you're disappointed in and
[47:17] another one. But you will need wisdom.
[47:20] You'll certainly need wisdom.
[47:24] And I say that as a father.
[47:27] I can tell you experiences, but I won't
[47:29] bother taking the time concerning the
[47:32] hour we are approaching that we might
[47:35] know how to approach it in the right
[47:38] way.
[47:40] And that's very very important. We can
[47:43] approach
[47:45] you can approach something one way and a
[47:48] neighbor will approach the very same
[47:51] thing in another way and one will be
[47:54] correct and one will be wrong. Right?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; So you have to know that
[48:02] because it's coming.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; There are things coming that we didn't
[48:08] expect.
[48:10] Amen.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; And I I see Brother Levi and Sister
[48:14] Leona,
[48:15] uh [cough and clears throat]
[48:17] I don't know if they expected
[48:19] to have the wedding that they had
[48:22] yesterday,
[48:24] but it's coming. It happened. And now
[48:28] it's over and you can breathe again.
[48:31] Uh, I know
[48:34] I had three daughters and actually two
[48:37] of them got married fairly close
[48:39] together and the last one got married to
[48:44] Sir Mr. Tom Ray
[48:47] and he caught me at a weak moment after
[48:49] I had just been on the airplane for
[48:51] about 44 hours and while they were
[48:54] driving by he said you know Joanne and I
[48:57] blah blah blah would like to get married
[49:00] and
[49:01] and I didn't hardly know my own name
[49:05] and I wasn't expecting that but it's
[49:07] coming and it happened.
[49:13] our
[49:15] here's a little little thing just common
[49:19] human thing. I had a
[49:24] uh part of the floor right above our
[49:26] bedroom used to squeak.
[49:30] And I it annoyed me because my father
[49:33] was one that I helped him build and do a
[49:37] little bit of carpenter work. And he was
[49:39] always one to put more nails in than
[49:42] were needed. And he put And so I would
[49:45] always grumble at this squeaking. I say,
[49:48] "Why didn't the guys put more nails in
[49:50] there? Why didn't they put some screws
[49:53] in? I have to deal with this squealing
[49:55] and squeaking and squeaking." And then
[49:58] when all the girls were married and
[50:00] gone, and the last one was married and
[50:03] gone,
[50:05] I had something happen I didn't expect.
[50:08] The floor didn't squeak.
[50:12] And I'd wake up in the morning in the
[50:13] wee hours of the morning 2 3:00 and I
[50:16] just thought, you know, the upstairs is
[50:19] empty.
[50:20] Squeak floor. Why don't you squeak?
[50:24] And the very thing that I despised, I
[50:27] now wanted it to happen. And I wanted
[50:31] the floor to squeak. So finally one day,
[50:34] I walked up there and and the room's
[50:37] empty just like this right here. Said,
[50:40] "There's no bed. There's no chest of
[50:42] drawers. There's no no furniture. It's
[50:45] all gone. So I I went to Joanne. I said,
[50:49] "Uh,
[50:51] I went up to your room and it's empty."
[50:53] She said, "Well, it's mine."
[50:58] I didn't have an answer for that. I
[50:59] thought, "Well, yeah, I guess it's
[51:01] yours." So, she she did what she wanted
[51:05] with it.
[51:07] But uh the the you know I think that
[51:10] that just stands to reason we don't know
[51:13] what tomorrow's going to hold but it's
[51:16] coming.
[51:18] If you live and breathe and have air and
[51:21] all, it's coming. And whatever it is
[51:24] tomorrow, I I happen to it it's my
[51:27] advice to you is to know somebody who
[51:30] does know what's coming
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and trust him to prepare you for
[51:36] whatever it is. Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Now I want to give you [clears throat]
[51:50] how many believe that a a prophet knew
[51:53] what was coming. I will use some
[51:55] language today that's strange to you. He
[51:58] preached,
[52:00] this isn't the sermon, but he spoke a
[52:03] message, a message from God to the
[52:07] people.
[52:09] And uh he called it something that you
[52:12] never call it, you wouldn't call it an
[52:16] invasion of the United States of
[52:19] America.
[52:22] He called it an invasion. and
[52:24] Westinghouse.
[52:26] Apparently, they took a picture of a
[52:28] girl. And this is the picture.
[52:34] It was during World War II.
[52:38] And this picture is called,
[52:42] well, the title of it is we can do it.
[52:47] But America was at war
[52:51] and uh
[52:53] so a lot of men and
[52:56] husbands and sons were on the
[53:00] battlefield.
[53:02] They were in the army or the air force.
[53:06] And I know a lot of your lives were
[53:08] touched by that
[53:11] as mine was,
[53:14] as my wife's was.
[53:17] And uh [clears throat]
[53:21] we happened to see a
[53:24] documentary
[53:26] a few days ago. My wife and I were
[53:28] sitting watching it
[53:31] and uh it was of the first world war and
[53:34] her daddy was in the first world war
[53:38] and it showed all the men and this was
[53:40] from archives from the government of
[53:42] Canada
[53:44] that had been recently whether they'd
[53:47] been recently discovered but at least
[53:49] recently put into a documentary
[53:52] and it showed
[53:55] the troops in there. And I I just
[53:58] punched into the Google the Battle of
[54:01] the Psalm. S O M M E. Battle of the
[54:05] Psalm. Her daddy spoke of that to us.
[54:10] And so she got out his letters and he
[54:13] was writing letters in detail of the
[54:16] Battle of the Psalm. And he was in the
[54:19] trench and he said, "We've had something
[54:21] to eat." And and a few an hour or two
[54:25] before that, we'd been watching the
[54:28] troops having something to eat before
[54:31] they before they take their their first
[54:35] and second wave or third and fourth wave
[54:38] of men. And uh the opposing armies were
[54:44] completely dug into their trenches and
[54:48] had their machine gun nests and and the
[54:52] boys just got mowed down
[54:55] out of the first wave. And we saw where
[54:58] the announcer was saying, "Now the first
[55:01] wave will leave the trench." here.
[55:03] They'd been down and having their soup
[55:05] and so on. And now the first wave is
[55:09] going and it was it was uh
[55:12] it wasn't something put on in Hollywood.
[55:16] They showed the boys being mowed down
[55:19] and and falling on the barb wire, etc.,
[55:22] etc. And out of that first wave, that
[55:26] first troop, two men came back.
[55:31] My wife's daddy Yeah.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And the platoon later
[55:38] &gt;&gt; and her daddy was quite badly wounded
[55:41] with a big shell that fell right nearby
[55:45] and it it
[55:48] blew a lot of shrapnel into his body and
[55:52] his shoulder and his neck and he was
[55:54] wounded and uh he had to struggle and
[55:57] find his way back to first aid and then
[56:01] they took him back to London. and he was
[56:03] in the hospital for a couple weeks, but
[56:06] they never put him in the front lines,
[56:08] but he had to. And I thank God
[56:11] &gt;&gt; said he had to come back.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Because he still had my wife in him.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; That's the truth of it.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; But had I expected this kind of a
[56:22] brutality of warers, many of you have
[56:25] seen it. Many of you have been touched
[56:28] by it. Many of you have been affected by
[56:32] it. And because of it,
[56:37] the home
[56:39] didn't have the essence of father.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; The essence,
[56:47] you know, you don't pay any attention to
[56:49] dad coming home and dad he earns the
[56:52] money. You don't even know where it
[56:54] comes from. There's food on the table
[56:56] and
[56:58] but if dad wasn't there,
[57:01] the essence
[57:04] of that person
[57:06] just,
[57:08] you know, it's not his correction and
[57:10] not his sternness or anything else, but
[57:13] there's something and there's something
[57:16] this was an invasion.
[57:19] The prophet spoke about the invasion of
[57:22] America.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] And
[57:26] and this now hangs in is is part of the
[57:31] national archives
[57:33] in Washington DC
[57:38] and she has become
[57:41] uh
[57:43] an icon of the feminist movement.
[57:47] So it wasn't what Westinghouse,
[57:52] you know, they they just had it up there
[57:53] for a couple weeks and they took a
[57:55] picture of somebody else and had them
[57:56] up. They weren't trying to promote
[58:00] femininity or empowerment of the woman.
[58:05] But that's what it was used for. Satan
[58:08] got on to it.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; He took a hold of it. He put it up
[58:12] before the people and and uh h has has
[58:17] her as the
[58:20] as the
[58:22] the solver of all problems. you know,
[58:26] &gt;&gt; you know what I'm talking about. And uh
[58:30] empowered the woman and the wife when in
[58:33] fact is
[58:35] their sons
[58:37] and their husbands
[58:39] or husbands to be were dying on the
[58:42] battlefield,
[58:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:46] were being slain
[58:48] by the tens of thousands
[58:51] in the Second World War between 70 and
[58:55] 85
[58:57] million people
[59:00] more than the entire double the
[59:02] population of Canada
[59:05] and you'll have the bottom estimate of
[59:08] people there were from shore to shining
[59:11] shining shore.
[59:15] And I don't know what it was. And and I
[59:18] know it's going to be silent because
[59:20] you're going to be thinking about things
[59:22] as I have been. I've been
[59:25] very very deeply affected by the things
[59:29] I'm going to talk about this morning.
[59:32] And um
[59:35] we never knew how perhaps that started
[59:41] and the empowerment
[59:45] of ladies and moving them out of their
[59:47] place,
[59:49] taking them and I'm going to read where
[59:51] their place is
[59:55] in the kitchen,
[59:57] in the home. And you know what the world
[1:00:01] puts that
[1:00:04] there she is there to have the babies
[1:00:07] and have children and and I'm going to
[1:00:10] I'm going to turn that around this
[1:00:12] morning in one sentence and say that's
[1:00:15] the most honored place
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; that you can ever be.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; How many mothers do we have? I'm so
[1:00:24] thankful to God. I'm not thankful my
[1:00:26] wife went out and pumped gas or drove a
[1:00:30] taxi or was a police officer. I'm not
[1:00:34] thankful over that. I'm thankful that
[1:00:36] she was a a mother to my children.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And I honor her for that. And I think
[1:00:43] that's the greatest thing that uh you
[1:00:48] young ladies or mothers
[1:00:50] can have
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; is be a mother to your children. Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And so while there were tens of
[1:01:02] thousands
[1:01:04] dying
[1:01:06] in the air and on the sea
[1:01:09] and uh on the battlefields
[1:01:13] that this
[1:01:17] Rosie the Riveter
[1:01:19] would be uh an idol of not nothing
[1:01:24] against her. Not not a thing.
[1:01:27] They they accepted
[1:01:30] to take positions in support of the war
[1:01:35] effort and that was the most patriotic
[1:01:38] thing they could do and we certainly
[1:01:41] don't say anything against that. That
[1:01:44] was the but Satan took a hold of it.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; He takes a hold of the necessary things
[1:01:49] and twists them and pervert. He can't be
[1:01:52] a creator, but he perverts him. And so
[1:01:55] there's death happening on the
[1:01:57] battlefields
[1:01:59] while Satan himself is invading the
[1:02:01] home.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; So Satan's on both ends
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; and he's winning a victory. He has an
[1:02:16] invasion going on. But the people of thy
[1:02:19] nation were too proud or too
[1:02:23] indoctrinated with their denominations
[1:02:26] or whatever more to hear the prophet
[1:02:28] that God was sending them and warning
[1:02:32] them and tell them telling them what her
[1:02:35] honored position was.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you I don't I don't
[1:02:41] belittle anybody. We have very
[1:02:43] intellectual. Don't be carried away with
[1:02:46] that. Don't be deceived with that.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; The young lady might be here. She's from
[1:02:57] originally from one of the nations of
[1:02:59] Africa. Incidentally, in the country of
[1:03:02] the new home, there's no nations.
[1:03:05] There's no borders. There's no
[1:03:07] countries.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; We are we are citizens of one society.
[1:03:12] Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Regardless of our color or our
[1:03:16] background or where we came from or what
[1:03:20] lineage we had
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; down through this earth,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; God gave us that lineage so that we
[1:03:28] could participate in his will and obey
[1:03:32] and do his service.
[1:03:38] Yes.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And so we have
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to dwell on this
[1:03:50] essence
[1:03:54] if you would allow me a little bit of
[1:03:56] time.
[1:04:02] Femininity. Femininity is considered a
[1:04:05] set of attributes,
[1:04:08] behaviors and roles R O L E S generally
[1:04:14] associated with girls and women. Why? I
[1:04:16] don't know but this is out of
[1:04:20] Wikipedia. I think
[1:04:23] it was an invasion. I said these are my
[1:04:26] words. It was an invasion
[1:04:29] to steal the highest and best qualities
[1:04:33] of womanhood.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And while the boys were giving their
[1:04:39] lives
[1:04:41] to win and have an invasion take place,
[1:04:46] Satan was making an invasion
[1:04:50] of the home
[1:04:52] of the young ladies.
[1:04:55] And this is what I was going to say.
[1:05:00] I had a young lady
[1:05:02] from Africa visit I and my wife in my
[1:05:06] office here
[1:05:08] and she's beyond
[1:05:11] a lawyer.
[1:05:13] She understands
[1:05:16] uh she understands the construction and
[1:05:19] and how it should be put together and
[1:05:21] was asked by the justice department to
[1:05:24] do a whole assessment of the entire
[1:05:26] lower mainland. That's where she's at
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; mentally.
[1:05:32] I would say that Satan has jumped on
[1:05:35] that
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; and she wasn't even able to earn a
[1:05:38] living.
[1:05:40] And so I said, and the young ladies
[1:05:42] here, you can forgive me for using you
[1:05:44] as an example, but I won't
[1:05:46] I won't identify you.
[1:05:50] But I said I I just said in my
[1:05:53] simplicity,
[1:05:55] "Are you working?" Well, she said,
[1:05:58] "Yeah."
[1:06:00] I said, "What are you doing?" since I
[1:06:03] stock shelves in a grocery store.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; That kind of brilliance. [clears throat]
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; So somebody over here is telling her,
[1:06:14] "You are so smart. You are so brilliant.
[1:06:19] You can go to the moon." Yeah, that's
[1:06:23] about where they went
[1:06:25] to the moon.
[1:06:30] What do you do for a living? stock
[1:06:32] shelves
[1:06:35] in a grocery store. It's a devil's trap.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; It's a devil's trap. I'm just telling
[1:06:42] you with the truth. It's a devil's trap.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; God is not interested. He's not going to
[1:06:49] check your fingerprints or check you at
[1:06:52] the gates of this city
[1:06:56] called the new heaven and the new earth
[1:06:59] to see how intelligent you are. But how
[1:07:02] did you believe?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That's the key. How did you believe?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; How do you believe the word that God
[1:07:12] sent?
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Are you just simple enough to believe
[1:07:15] the word? and the prophet of God in the
[1:07:18] future home. You've you've read it.
[1:07:21] Those of you that have read it,
[1:07:24] he talks about the woman at the well.
[1:07:27] He says in fact she was a prostitute.
[1:07:31] She had had five husbands and the one
[1:07:33] she has now is not her husband. Somebody
[1:07:36] else's husband, I suppose. I don't know.
[1:07:40] You wouldn't want her as a neighbor. You
[1:07:43] probably wouldn't want her in your home.
[1:07:47] You certainly wouldn't want her to be an
[1:07:49] example to your daughters or your
[1:07:52] family.
[1:07:56] But Jesus traveled and sat on a well and
[1:08:00] waited for her.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And there was a priest. When the priests
[1:08:05] saw the prophets
[1:08:08] sign and saw what he did, the priests
[1:08:11] called him Belub.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Now that's a long distance from Messiah.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; But when the woman saw him,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; he said she had a little seed down
[1:08:25] inside. She and the only thing she knew,
[1:08:28] I know when the Messiah cometh,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; he'll answer these things.
[1:08:37] Friends, that's the quality
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; you want to have.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; I know that when the Messiah cometh,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; he will answer these questions.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; He will set things right.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; He will do things. Maybe there's things,
[1:08:53] yes, in the home or in your environment
[1:08:56] that are not according to uh the way
[1:08:59] they should be. And there's something
[1:09:01] inside that says it ought to be
[1:09:03] different.
[1:09:04] Don't worry, one day it will be
[1:09:06] different.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; You just keep your heart in the right
[1:09:10] place.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; I know when he is cometh. I know when he
[1:09:14] come into my life, he did all kinds of
[1:09:17] things. He rearranged things.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; He put me on a straight place, on a
[1:09:23] straight path. He took all the kinks out
[1:09:26] of it. And to some of you, you may have
[1:09:30] experienced a much more glorious walk
[1:09:32] than others, but nevertheless,
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; he's the same.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; God is the same. I don't know how to
[1:09:40] emphasize it any more than that.
[1:09:58] If you'll excuse me, I want to take my
[1:10:00] time as far as I go and then when I
[1:10:04] we're done, we'll be done.
[1:10:14] peace.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even was so plain and
[1:10:19] so frank
[1:10:22] and they and he he got a name of being a
[1:10:25] woman hater.
[1:10:29] How do you figure that out when he says
[1:10:32] next to salvation?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; The best thing he can give a man is a
[1:10:38] wife.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Next to salvation.
[1:10:42] I'll tell you what, young fellas, don't
[1:10:45] be in too big a hurry. Make sure you get
[1:10:48] a wife like I have.
[1:10:51] Next to salvation or some other fellas
[1:10:54] have next to salvation.
[1:10:58] Not what she wants to do or what she
[1:11:00] wants to be, but she wants to serve her
[1:11:04] husband.
[1:11:06] She wants to serve God. She wants to be
[1:11:09] in the house of God.
[1:11:11] not what she can achieve. That's a
[1:11:14] devil's trap
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; and it's a devil's lie.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; It's not what you want to achieve. I'll
[1:11:20] tell you what, if you achieve womanhood,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; if you achieve
[1:11:26] motherhood, if God gives you children,
[1:11:30] you've achieved something that the
[1:11:33] people who've women who have gone to
[1:11:35] Harvard, I've read about eight of them
[1:11:38] that went through an exclusive
[1:11:42] man's universities.
[1:11:47] You might go to college
[1:11:50] If you do, just remember
[1:11:53] it's going to serve it's got to serve
[1:11:55] you.
[1:11:57] It's got to serve the God that you
[1:11:59] serve.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And if they don't like your God, so be
[1:12:04] it.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And I have nothing to do with them.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; They don't love my God. They don't care
[1:12:10] for him. They want to fight this uh
[1:12:14] kingdom of the kingdom of God. then they
[1:12:18] have no really no allegiance in my
[1:12:20] heart. Excuse me.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; In the future home,
[1:12:33] this will be a blessing to you, I trust.
[1:12:35] Now he said, now John explains the
[1:12:39] change and how it comes about.
[1:12:44] He doesn't explain it rather he corrects
[1:12:47] it but Peter does. So Peter in second
[1:12:52] Peter he tells how the process the
[1:12:56] heavens are on fire etc. John just said
[1:13:01] I saw a new heaven and a new earth first
[1:13:05] heavens and first earth was passed away.
[1:13:12] Just hold that. Passed away. There was
[1:13:15] no more sea. I John saw the holy city
[1:13:20] coming down from God out of heaven
[1:13:24] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:13:27] husband.
[1:13:30] What is heaven?
[1:13:33] Whatever your thought of heaven is, what
[1:13:35] is heaven
[1:13:37] without the essence
[1:13:39] of father?
[1:13:43] What is heaven
[1:13:46] without angels?
[1:13:49] What is heaven
[1:13:51] without the redeemed?
[1:13:55] What is heaven
[1:13:58] without this host of righteous people,
[1:14:02] clean, holy people? And I often pray, I
[1:14:07] pray, I think daily, and I say it from
[1:14:11] the depths of my heart, thy kingdom
[1:14:14] come,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; the equity and the equality of thy
[1:14:19] kingdom,
[1:14:21] thy righteousness
[1:14:23] bring in
[1:14:26] not the kind of politics we have,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; but there's going to be one. And I'm not
[1:14:33] giving you a pie in the sky. This is
[1:14:36] what's approaching.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; This is what's approaching.
[1:14:42] Teach me to approach it in the right way
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; that I might participate in it that I
[1:14:51] might lead others and affect them and
[1:14:54] influence them
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; to be part of that.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] to be part of that
[1:15:02] economy.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; We might have just the economy of God,
[1:15:06] but what's the essence of it? Peace.
[1:15:10] Where is peace?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Where's peace in the home? Where's peace
[1:15:16] in the hearts of people? Where's peace?
[1:15:19] Is it in the school or in the
[1:15:21] universities?
[1:15:23] Listen friends, we have a message. Amen.
[1:15:27] Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Let's be serious about it. Let's be
[1:15:31] serious in your own heart. You may have
[1:15:33] to choose your own way, but I say cast
[1:15:37] off.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; What the world has glorified
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; and what the world has magnified.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; With the rise of womanhood
[1:15:56] and this invasion that the prophet of
[1:15:59] God talks about, you should go back and
[1:16:01] read
[1:16:03] invasion
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; of United States. United States is a
[1:16:09] superpower. We agree with that. Egypt
[1:16:13] also was a superpower.
[1:16:16] Egypt was the superpower
[1:16:19] and when it went down
[1:16:23] it's scarcely remembered in today's
[1:16:26] today's world
[1:16:29] climate and economy.
[1:16:32] Are you with me?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Since when did it rise?
[1:16:38] But it came in direct head-to-head
[1:16:40] opposition with the power of God in a
[1:16:44] man called Moses.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Well, we think he's way back
[1:16:48] there. No, he's not way back there.
[1:16:51] Jesus said God is not a God of the dead.
[1:16:54] He's a God of the living.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Moses is very much alive. He could come
[1:16:59] through the door today
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; and he faced this superpower.
[1:17:08] One man, one man
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; faced a superpower,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; but his law was the law of God.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; His devotion was to God Almighty. And
[1:17:21] whatever God would say, he'd believe it
[1:17:23] at regardless of what the odds were.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The
[1:17:33] first heavens and the first earth were
[1:17:35] passed away.
[1:17:38] There was no more sea. I, John, saw the
[1:17:42] holy city
[1:17:44] coming down from God out of heaven,
[1:17:47] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:17:50] husband.
[1:17:52] What is a heavenly home without a bride
[1:17:55] and a groom?
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We just had one up here yesterday.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:04] Last night, last evening, yesterday
[1:18:06] afternoon,
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; this is what was pondering my heart.
[1:18:15] What's a home
[1:18:17] without a bride and a groom, a husband
[1:18:20] and a wife?
[1:18:26] you know, a man that I
[1:18:29] regarded
[1:18:32] had probably one of the greatest effects
[1:18:34] on me
[1:18:38] was my wife's daddy.
[1:18:41] And I was in business before we got
[1:18:44] married.
[1:18:46] had a service station with eight men
[1:18:48] working.
[1:18:54] I was having a bit of a problem with
[1:18:57] theft.
[1:19:00] And my father-in-law, who I highly
[1:19:03] highly regarded, he said, "Well, now
[1:19:07] the thing for you to do is
[1:19:10] uh Ruth will make your supper.
[1:19:14] You'll drive home
[1:19:16] and then she can come to the service
[1:19:19] station
[1:19:21] and watch over it while you eat.
[1:19:25] And then in other words, we would just
[1:19:27] switch roles.
[1:19:30] I didn't know anything about the
[1:19:31] message. I never heard of it.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, Dad," I said, "I
[1:19:37] married your daughter, not the service
[1:19:40] station.
[1:19:44] And that was a decision
[1:19:47] I was very glad I took.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; But when my
[1:19:53] later on my daughters who are all three
[1:19:56] here
[1:19:58] when you came home,
[1:20:01] you might think dad didn't notice this,
[1:20:04] but I noticed it
[1:20:07] because I'd lived through it.
[1:20:10] And when the kids come busting through
[1:20:12] the door, they'd say, "Mom."
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Because there's an essence.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; There's an essence of motherhood. If you
[1:20:25] said, "Define that." What does that mean
[1:20:28] when you Why do you say mom?
[1:20:31] Well, we got something to tell her.
[1:20:34] That's what's important to them,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:38] God knew that before.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And you young ladies here that haven't a
[1:20:43] home yet, when you do, that's
[1:20:50] what God has lifted you up.
[1:20:53] And I realize there are others that are
[1:20:56] here that perhaps have not had children.
[1:21:01] God has a place for you, an honored
[1:21:04] place.
[1:21:06] And I think of you, sister Debbie,
[1:21:09] your hands have handled
[1:21:12] of the word of God.
[1:21:15] And perhaps God has not given you
[1:21:18] children as such, but has given you many
[1:21:22] children.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; What your hands have handled of the word
[1:21:33] of faith.
[1:21:36] There's people who hear it today who
[1:21:39] maybe would never ever hear it unless
[1:21:42] somebody sent it to them,
[1:21:45] unless somebody gave it to them.
[1:21:50] really allow me just to go on a few more
[1:21:53] moments.
[1:22:07] [clears throat]
[1:22:09] Now, this I want you to really get. So,
[1:22:13] hang right close.
[1:22:17] And I'm reading from the future home,
[1:22:20] but you will not find this in your
[1:22:22] textbook
[1:22:24] at college,
[1:22:26] at the best university in the world,
[1:22:29] or some
[1:22:31] story book.
[1:22:33] So you listen.
[1:22:37] Now, if you'd look at what John said, it
[1:22:40] sounds like
[1:22:44] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:22:46] was passed away,
[1:22:48] annihilated.
[1:22:51] Then that sounds very strange.
[1:22:54] So that's
[1:22:56] what struck me and I begin to look
[1:23:01] for the word pass away.
[1:23:06] But it's clear that both of these
[1:23:08] apostles
[1:23:10] and prophets were talking about the same
[1:23:13] thing.
[1:23:14] Pass away.
[1:23:17] The meaning is an act
[1:23:21] continuing for a time
[1:23:24] or it may be of a person to come from
[1:23:27] one place to another.
[1:23:31] This world passes away. Why? Because the
[1:23:35] persons there are persons there.
[1:23:38] This act is finished. This act is
[1:23:41] completed.
[1:23:43] But there are persons there that are
[1:23:46] going from this act. They're passing to
[1:23:48] another one.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And they it speaks of persons to come
[1:23:53] from one place to another. And we have a
[1:23:58] prophet talking about not only a
[1:24:01] heavenly home,
[1:24:03] but where uh for the heavenly bridegroom
[1:24:06] and the earthly bride. I want to say to
[1:24:09] this earthly bride, you're headed for
[1:24:13] another place.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And then this is what he goes on from
[1:24:20] here.
[1:24:23] All this exists
[1:24:25] in the heavens. He talks about the
[1:24:28] atmospheres.
[1:24:30] The heavens will be on fire. They have
[1:24:32] to be on fire.
[1:24:35] They're filled with all kinds of demon
[1:24:38] spirits and influences
[1:24:41] that are brought down. I'm so thankful.
[1:24:45] I'm so thankful that this little
[1:24:47] congregation that God could put it in
[1:24:50] our hearts, in your hearts, and that we
[1:24:52] are faithful to send the prophet's
[1:24:55] message and his voice into the heavens.
[1:24:58] I'm just I I just thrilled to think we
[1:25:02] have a voice up there that's casting out
[1:25:05] devils,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; calling for the essence of healing.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Says it's hanging over you right now. I
[1:25:14] want to bring it to you THIS MORNING. WE
[1:25:16] SERVE A LIVING God
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; who's present right here whether you
[1:25:22] FEEL IT OR NOT. Your body wasn't meant
[1:25:24] to feel it, but your heart was meant to
[1:25:27] believe it.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "I believe that."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Of course you do. Hallelujah. We have
[1:25:44] nothing else to believe.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Our body may not feel it or may even
[1:25:50] feel something that's not real.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; We're not here by feelings.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; We're here by faith.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; The essence of faith.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; The essence is I believe it.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Why do I believe it? I don't know why I
[1:26:05] believe it, but I believe it.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Ask the woman at the well.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have another lady, another woman
[1:26:12] in the Bible,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; and she washed the feet of the Lord
[1:26:17] Jesus and wiped them with the hairs of
[1:26:20] her head,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; and she broke an alabaster box upon him.
[1:26:25] And the Bible says, "And the house was
[1:26:29] filled with the orders,
[1:26:34] the orders
[1:26:36] of the perfume.
[1:26:40] And uh some smelled it and said this
[1:26:44] could have been sold.
[1:26:47] This could HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR 300 P. A
[1:26:50] lot of money
[1:26:52] and given to the poor. Sounded like a
[1:26:55] good idea. It sounded like a very good
[1:26:58] religious idea. We would do something
[1:27:00] for humanity. People are interested in
[1:27:03] that.
[1:27:06] But the Bible also records that he was
[1:27:10] not interested in the poor.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't have any interest in the poor.
[1:27:16] He was doing it
[1:27:18] but at the at the odor and and seeing
[1:27:23] this woman weep marry and washing his
[1:27:26] feet with her tears and but Jesus took
[1:27:30] up for her and he said this.
[1:27:33] Why trouble you the woman?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; She hath done a good work on me.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; She didn't know she were doing a good
[1:27:42] work.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; She was completely taken up emotionally
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; with washing his feet with her tears of
[1:27:51] repentance.
[1:27:52] He said, "You've done a good work." Why
[1:27:54] have you done a good work?
[1:27:57] He said, "Because she's anointed me for
[1:28:00] my burial."
[1:28:03] That was a shock to her. She didn't
[1:28:05] [clears throat] know I didn't do this
[1:28:07] for his burial.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And there was other women, good women.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe women like yourself.
[1:28:18] Maybe women like Cordial Bible Way has.
[1:28:22] They were all busy and taken up and and
[1:28:25] on the on the Friday they were making
[1:28:28] spices
[1:28:30] because they need to embomb or not
[1:28:34] embomb but they need to uh put it on the
[1:28:38] body, anoint the body of the Lord Jesus.
[1:28:41] So they came early in the morning
[1:28:44] because they're excellent. They're
[1:28:47] keepers of the word. They came early
[1:28:50] early in the morning on the Lord's day,
[1:28:52] the first day of the week to anoint his
[1:28:55] body with the spices they had prepared.
[1:28:59] And they [laughter] were working all day
[1:29:01] making those spices. Oh my goodness, all
[1:29:05] the work making these spices.
[1:29:08] Save your time. Save your breath.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; The woman already anointed him for that.
[1:29:15] And when they came,
[1:29:19] the stones rolled away
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; and they go in and he's not there.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Did they ever get chastised for making
[1:29:30] spices? No, they never got chastised.
[1:29:33] They did what was
[1:29:37] good to be done apparently, but they
[1:29:39] never got to complete it. They never got
[1:29:42] to anoint him because it had already
[1:29:45] been done by a woman who didn't know
[1:29:47] what she was doing.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You may do things right here in the
[1:29:52] service
[1:29:54] and you believe things and you don't
[1:29:56] even know why you believe it. You can't
[1:29:59] explain it. You know why? Because it's
[1:30:01] the essence. Who's going to explain the
[1:30:04] odors?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Who's going to explain the smell? Who's
[1:30:11] going to explain
[1:30:13] what the motherhood is?
[1:30:16] Put your jacket on. You're cold. No, I'm
[1:30:19] not cold. You are cold. That's what
[1:30:22] mothers do.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Eat your food. You're hungry. I'm not
[1:30:28] hungry. I hate spinach. Eat it. It's
[1:30:30] good for you. That's what mothers do.
[1:30:33] And believe it or not, that's what you
[1:30:35] miss when it's not around anymore. say
[1:30:39] that's what she did. You don't even you
[1:30:42] don't say it in your orbitu her
[1:30:45] orbituary. She made me eat spinach when
[1:30:48] I didn't want to eat spinach.
[1:30:51] I hated I I didn't want any more food.
[1:30:54] Yes, you are. You're hungry.
[1:30:57] That's what mothers do. They know when
[1:30:59] you're hungry,
[1:31:01] don't they?
[1:31:03] You people all look at me like I'm from
[1:31:06] Mars or Venus or someplace. No, that's
[1:31:10] what mothers do. That's the essence of
[1:31:13] motherhood.
[1:31:14] Who's going to write that into a book?
[1:31:17] Where do you get that?
[1:31:22] And I can tell you what's supposed to be
[1:31:24] in the heavenly home will be there.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Do you love purity? Purity is going to
[1:31:33] be there.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Holiness is going to be there. Cleanness
[1:31:37] is going to be there. True justice is
[1:31:40] going to be there. That's what it's all
[1:31:43] about.
[1:31:44] That's the essence of the heavenly home.
[1:31:47] Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; I won't say that Rosie the Riverer is
[1:31:56] not there, but the essence
[1:32:01] of her,
[1:32:04] the essence of that, oh, she's she's
[1:32:08] laboring so her husband can go and fight
[1:32:11] a war. No, no, no, no, no. There been no
[1:32:13] war.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] And he says, "All this exists in the
[1:32:23] heavens or the atmospheres
[1:32:26] and the earth which is now this earth,
[1:32:30] this earth
[1:32:32] holds those things.
[1:32:37] But it wasn't made for that purpose."
[1:32:41] Oh, what was this earth made for?
[1:32:49] Sin caused it to be like that. It was
[1:32:54] made by God,
[1:32:57] the creator. Oh, yeah. Well, we say that
[1:33:00] because the grass is green and cows eat
[1:33:03] it and give us white milk. We don't know
[1:33:06] how, but
[1:33:10] it's just what happens.
[1:33:14] But listen to the rest.
[1:33:17] And all of our bodies
[1:33:22] that we live in now
[1:33:30] on the earth
[1:33:32] when God created it.
[1:33:37] All of your bodies.
[1:33:40] Well, with all of your
[1:33:45] I won't talk about you, but I'll talk
[1:33:47] about myself.
[1:33:48] I have a suit on, but I came out of the
[1:33:52] earth.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't have a suit on.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; I came out of the earth
[1:33:59] and a seed was
[1:34:01] sown
[1:34:04] into my mother's womb.
[1:34:08] I didn't have that mother very long.
[1:34:12] 6 and 1/2 years and she was gone.
[1:34:15] She'd never been sick a day in her life.
[1:34:18] She was 32.
[1:34:21] She's a little bit younger than my
[1:34:24] granddaughter that I have here, my
[1:34:26] eldest granddaughter.
[1:34:31] This is real, [clears throat] friends.
[1:34:32] We're not talking about pie in the sky.
[1:34:34] We're talking about reality.
[1:34:37] It is coming.
[1:34:39] We are going to it.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Help us to approach it in the right way.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And the right way, you say, "Well, what
[1:34:46] is the right?" The right way is to
[1:34:48] believe it.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Prepare for it. I'm going there.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; I am going there. So, I won't get caught
[1:34:56] up in absolutely everything else. Yeah,
[1:34:59] we have to work. Sure, we have to work.
[1:35:01] We have to pay our bills. We have to do
[1:35:03] things. We have to become educated. We
[1:35:05] have to do it. But let it always serve
[1:35:08] us and serve our purpose and serve the
[1:35:13] kingdom that we serve.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching for my health. I'm
[1:35:21] preaching because some of you need to
[1:35:22] hear it.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; And you need to do it. Amen.
[1:35:30] Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; The most important thing we have
[1:35:37] that this church has is we have a
[1:35:41] message that we believe came from God.
[1:35:45] We have every reason to believe it came
[1:35:48] from God.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And why do we believe it came from God?
[1:35:52] Because the supernatural God who does
[1:35:55] supernatural things was always in
[1:35:57] attendance with it.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; I'm one that stands behind this pulpit.
[1:36:03] But one day I crawled on my hands and
[1:36:06] knees into a tent with a broken heart.
[1:36:11] But I hadn't told anybody about my
[1:36:13] broken heart.
[1:36:15] I slept in that tent with this friend
[1:36:17] and the prophet of God.
[1:36:22] I slept there.
[1:36:25] My heart was broken. I never had a
[1:36:27] chance to tell him. Really broken.
[1:36:32] I'd spent a good part of my life
[1:36:35] building a church and a big denomination
[1:36:38] was taking it away and had, you know,
[1:36:42] used the political side and going to get
[1:36:45] votes and get the people that I had
[1:36:48] pastored get them to vote it out into
[1:36:51] their denomination.
[1:36:56] Listen friends, I'm not I don't have to
[1:36:59] dream up things. These happened.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; These people are scoundrels.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; These people, unless they repent,
[1:37:09] they're going to be destroyed.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Not because I say so, but because they
[1:37:14] are opposing the kingdom of God.
[1:37:22] And that's why they have all their robes
[1:37:24] and you know righteous things hold their
[1:37:27] hands a certain way. Nonsense.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have to act like we're somebody
[1:37:34] that we're not.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You don't know it, but my father was a
[1:37:45] was an alter boy in a Catholic church.
[1:37:50] And God saved him up early flames of
[1:37:53] Pentecost
[1:37:55] just when there was starting.
[1:38:00] The Pope
[1:38:02] this last week
[1:38:05] confessed
[1:38:07] to the world that priests have had
[1:38:11] relationships and sexual abuse with nuns
[1:38:16] for the first time in history. Do you
[1:38:19] know what? We knew that years ago.
[1:38:24] But they denied it
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; and would call us like dirtyminded
[1:38:28] people for even saying such a thing. But
[1:38:31] it is a fact.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And you, if you're a man or a woman,
[1:38:36] you'll stand up and say that's true.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And I'll have nothing to do with
[1:38:42] supporting such a thing. There'll be
[1:38:45] none of that in the heavenly home.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; There'll be no such a thing.
[1:38:52] Isn't it want to be a peaceful bliss to
[1:38:56] have leaders
[1:38:59] that you'll never have to worry about?
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Disciples will be in the heavenly home.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; The messengers will be in the heavenly
[1:39:08] home.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; The redeemed will be in the heavenly
[1:39:12] home.
[1:39:15] Lovers of justice and lovers of truth
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; and lovers of the peace of God
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; will be in the heavenly home.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; You'll never have to worry about a a
[1:39:29] disappointment
[1:39:31] or some kind of snide remarks.
[1:39:35] You'll never have to worry about that.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:39:44] And your body, your body that is sitting
[1:39:47] here today.
[1:39:50] You have a prophet said, "Your body,
[1:39:53] mommy, where did I come from?
[1:39:56] Did you ever think of that?
[1:39:59] Daddy, where am I going?
[1:40:06] I have a I have a niece.
[1:40:12] and her mom and dad used to have prayer
[1:40:16] and they would gather on the farm. There
[1:40:19] was no message. There was no prophet
[1:40:21] that they knew of, but they knew that
[1:40:23] they needed to pray. And there was one
[1:40:26] of the men that was not saved.
[1:40:30] And so they were very understanding,
[1:40:33] would send the little girl away with him
[1:40:38] for a walk in the evening while they had
[1:40:40] prayer.
[1:40:42] And he thought he was, they thought they
[1:40:45] were getting rid of him while they could
[1:40:48] have prayer. So she's walking
[1:40:50] innocently, five, six years old.
[1:40:54] Uncle George, who made the moon?
[1:40:58] Oh man, here he's faced with it again.
[1:41:00] He thought he got rid of that.
[1:41:03] And you know what kids are like? They'll
[1:41:05] just ask all kinds of questions. And God
[1:41:08] in such simplicity,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; who made the moon? Well, I guess God
[1:41:15] made the moon
[1:41:17] and finally he became a Christian
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; and finally became a preacher
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; of the gospel of Jesus Christ. All he
[1:41:28] knows is that he was changed.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; He was transformed.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; It was just before the message came. I
[1:41:36] don't know what he had.
[1:41:40] But God has said about you. All of us
[1:41:43] here, God has said
[1:41:46] you were in the earth in another form
[1:41:52] when he created it. True.
[1:41:57] And when he said, "Let the earth bring
[1:41:59] forth,"
[1:42:00] he wasn't just thinking about grass and
[1:42:02] weeds.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Thinking about people,
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; some of them are going to be his sons
[1:42:11] and daughters.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "Come forth."
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH.
[1:42:20] AND he knew one day he would transmit
[1:42:23] himself
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; to a body that came out of the earth.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, friends?
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? He became us.
[1:42:42] [snorts]
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He came to me
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; when I couldn't come to him.
[1:42:49] You know, there's a paragraph. It's in
[1:42:51] the Hebrews. I just looked at it in the
[1:42:54] study. I had to get Michael to come and
[1:42:56] help me.
[1:42:59] I said, you know, in this paragraph,
[1:43:02] Brother Brandham actually explains the
[1:43:04] big bang. He doesn't talk about the big
[1:43:07] bang.
[1:43:09] He talks about everything that science
[1:43:11] has struggled about for centuries
[1:43:16] way back even before Galileo I guess.
[1:43:20] But in this paragraph he describes it.
[1:43:23] He said, "Before there was
[1:43:26] an earth,
[1:43:29] before there was
[1:43:34] the heavens, before there was planets,
[1:43:38] before there was stars," he says
[1:43:42] before there was anything,
[1:43:46] just nothing.
[1:43:50] But then he says
[1:43:52] there was a just a fountain. We we'll
[1:43:55] say we'll call it a fountain.
[1:43:58] And he said it was the purest love
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; that you can imagine.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; I explained that's the big bang.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; It was just a fountain. [clears throat]
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; It was just the purest of love.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Why does he say that? because he doesn't
[1:44:17] have any language to say it. I've got
[1:44:20] something here. I didn't I didn't really
[1:44:23] want to read it, but
[1:44:28] you'll smile because it's your world.
[1:44:34] A customer calls a cu computer store.
[1:44:40] You know, I get texts every once in a
[1:44:42] while. I get text. I need an
[1:44:45] interpreter.
[1:44:48] What does you are mean?
[1:44:50] Well, it's your. Of course, it's your
[1:44:56] [panting]
[1:44:58] smiling at me.
[1:45:04] This guy's answer. He answers the store.
[1:45:08] Super duper computer store. Can I help
[1:45:11] you, customer? Yes. [snorts] I'm setting
[1:45:15] up an office in my den
[1:45:18] and I'm thinking about buying a
[1:45:19] computer.
[1:45:23] Salesman Mac.
[1:45:25] No, my name is Joe.
[1:45:30] Salesman. Your computer.
[1:45:34] Customer. I don't own a computer. I want
[1:45:37] to buy one.
[1:45:40] Mac. No. He said, "I told you my name is
[1:45:43] Joe."
[1:45:47] What's the problem? It's the language.
[1:45:49] The language has changed.
[1:45:52] Same words, but it just meaning is
[1:45:54] different.
[1:45:58] Salesman, what about windows?
[1:46:01] Customer,
[1:46:03] why will it get stuffy in here?
[1:46:07] He doesn't know. He just got He wants to
[1:46:09] set up. Salesman, do you want a computer
[1:46:13] with Windows?
[1:46:16] Customer, I don't know. What will I see
[1:46:19] when I look at the windows?
[1:46:24] Salesman wallpaper.
[1:46:28] [laughter]
[1:46:33] Customer, never mind the windows. I need
[1:46:36] a computer and software
[1:46:41] salesman. Software for Windows.
[1:46:45] No,
[1:46:47] on the computer. I need something I can
[1:46:50] use to write proposals,
[1:46:53] track expenses,
[1:46:55] and run my business. What do you have?
[1:47:01] What about financial bookkeeping?
[1:47:05] Do you have anything contract my money
[1:47:08] with?
[1:47:10] Salesman. Money.
[1:47:14] Customer.
[1:47:15] That's right. What do you have?
[1:47:17] Salesman. Money.
[1:47:21] Customer. I need money to track my
[1:47:24] money.
[1:47:30] I see you. You've all been there.
[1:47:35] salesman. It comes bundled with your
[1:47:38] computer.
[1:47:41] What's bundled with my computer?
[1:47:45] Money. Salesman says, "Money.
[1:47:50] Money comes with my computer."
[1:47:53] Yes. No extra [snorts] charge.
[1:47:57] Customer, I get a bundle of money with
[1:48:00] my computer. How much? salesman one
[1:48:04] copy.
[1:48:07] Isn't it illegal to copy money
[1:48:14] salesman? Microsoft gives us a license
[1:48:16] to copy money.
[1:48:20] Customer, they gave you a license to
[1:48:22] copy money.
[1:48:26] Salesman, why not? they own it.
[1:48:33] Few days later, the customer called
[1:48:35] says, "How do I shut my computer off?"
[1:48:38] He says, "Press start."
[1:48:47] You know what you might say? That that
[1:48:50] customer was very, very dumb.
[1:48:55] very
[1:48:57] uh didn't know what was going on.
[1:49:01] You know, I I really debated about even
[1:49:04] bringing that because
[1:49:06] [clears throat] I know you'd find it
[1:49:08] humorous. I find it humorous when we're
[1:49:10] trying to talk about the heavenly home
[1:49:13] and we put it down into English
[1:49:15] language. It just doesn't work.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work.
[1:49:25] the English language and the prophet and
[1:49:28] and he's standing he's saying you know
[1:49:31] now it's going to mean something to you.
[1:49:32] He he's standing here and a woman's
[1:49:34] standing here a man standing here and he
[1:49:36] says uh I'm in two worlds right now.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Talk about spinning your head around
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; and they'll say how stupid a person say
[1:49:48] explain it to us. I can't
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; What are they asking? Explain that other
[1:49:57] world. Explain the new heaven. Explain
[1:50:00] the new earth. I don't know. But at
[1:50:03] least we can take what the word of God
[1:50:06] says. It will pass away.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, "THANK GOD it'll pass away."
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care how. I don't care when, but
[1:50:16] I am interested in it passing away.
[1:50:19] Amen.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Why is it passing away? Because part of
[1:50:23] the earth that he spoke and says, "Bring
[1:50:25] forth now is here." And we're believing
[1:50:30] he's our father. I don't know how he's
[1:50:32] our father. How do you children know how
[1:50:35] your father brought you here and your
[1:50:38] mother brought you here? It's a mystery
[1:50:40] of life.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; But it happened.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; How do we know it happened? I'm here.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; I know that it happened.
[1:50:49] Why did he speak to me? I don't know.
[1:50:51] But he did speak to me. And I know he
[1:50:54] spoke to me. I know he said something to
[1:50:57] me. What did he say? Windows. Do you
[1:51:00] want windows?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; How do we know what it is?
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; The only way and what God has given you
[1:51:09] to know is this.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; And we are called on to believe it.
[1:51:14] Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God comes in
[1:51:18] simplicity in the unveiling of God. He
[1:51:21] says the people, the masses,
[1:51:25] there's a lot of people here.
[1:51:28] I hope that God has special grace to you
[1:51:33] will give you such simplicity. You'll
[1:51:35] just say, "You know what, brother Ed? I
[1:51:39] listened this morning. I didn't
[1:51:40] understand it, but I believed it." Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; There's something in here.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; There's something that just says, "I I
[1:51:49] just believe that
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; there's another earth. There's a new
[1:51:52] heaven. There's a new earth that'll be
[1:51:55] just, be pure. It'll be holy. And you
[1:52:00] want to be there? Yes, I do want to be
[1:52:03] there."
[1:52:06] And the woman at the well, how is she
[1:52:09] going to explain? Says, "I I met a man
[1:52:12] today." Oh yeah, sure. You met a man.
[1:52:15] You met several others also.
[1:52:20] No, this was different. Yeah, I know
[1:52:22] it's different. How's she going to
[1:52:23] explain it?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; It was different.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; And he told me he was the Messiah. Oh
[1:52:31] yeah. Come on, tell me something else.
[1:52:37] Do you understand, friends?
[1:52:40] But what if this Bible says you'll live
[1:52:43] forever?
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; You want to believe that?
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; If this Bible says because I live, you
[1:52:50] shall live also. Say, I don't know about
[1:52:53] the resurrection, but I believe he
[1:52:55] raised from the dead and I believe that
[1:52:57] kind of life. He says, you shall have a
[1:53:00] body like his glorious body. I believe
[1:53:03] that.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I believe that. You believe that? Why do
[1:53:07] you believe it? I don't know why I
[1:53:08] believe it, but I believe that.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I'll just be another moment or two.
[1:53:31] What is the essence? I want to ask that
[1:53:34] question
[1:53:35] and I wanted to give it to you.
[1:53:39] The essence is the Holy Spirit.
[1:53:44] What is the Holy Spirit?
[1:53:46] Well, there was a sound like a wind from
[1:53:49] heaven and it filled all the house.
[1:53:53] Nobody defi define [clears throat] it
[1:53:55] for us.
[1:53:57] [cough]
[1:53:59] What is the Holy Spirit?
[1:54:01] It's the essence of God.
[1:54:06] And it filled all the house where they
[1:54:08] were.
[1:54:12] And they were filled with the Holy
[1:54:13] Ghost.
[1:54:16] And they went out
[1:54:18] and every man was speaking in other
[1:54:21] languages. And the prophet says
[1:54:24] languages. There was people from all
[1:54:27] countries.
[1:54:29] and they heard these people praising God
[1:54:34] and speaking of the great works. Now,
[1:54:37] that would get your attention, wouldn't
[1:54:38] it? It caught their attention. That's
[1:54:42] what it was for. And they and they were
[1:54:45] staggering around under. They said
[1:54:48] they're drunk. That's the only time. You
[1:54:52] know, I saw my wife once. We were in a
[1:54:55] little hall having a meeting and she
[1:54:59] became drunk on the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:04] She laughed and became drunk.
[1:55:09] Is that the only time? Yep. That's the
[1:55:11] only time.
[1:55:13] It has to happen twice. No, doesn't have
[1:55:16] to happen twice. It happened once and I
[1:55:19] knew it was the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:31] And the bodies that we live in right now
[1:55:37] was put on the earth.
[1:55:40] Your body
[1:55:42] was put on the earth when God created
[1:55:46] it.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:55:52] When he spoke it, he doesn't have to say
[1:55:54] it to, oh, I really meant I wanted sons
[1:55:58] and daughters. No, is this his whole
[1:56:00] thought.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; And when he created it and the earth,
[1:56:07] when God created it, because you're out
[1:56:10] of the dust of the earth, it was all
[1:56:13] laid out here when God himself created
[1:56:17] it.
[1:56:19] Isn't that marvelous?
[1:56:22] You were in his thinking.
[1:56:25] You were in his thinking before you
[1:56:27] could even think.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You were in his thinking.
[1:56:33] And in him,
[1:56:36] the great eternal
[1:56:39] was the thought
[1:56:42] which is his attribute. And now sin
[1:56:46] caused all this to happen.
[1:56:51] Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Sin could never reach it. God had
[1:56:55] already spoken it. And what his thought
[1:56:58] was,
[1:57:00] whatever his thought was, it wasn't just
[1:57:02] everything, but his thought was, I'm
[1:57:05] going to have a family. I'm not going to
[1:57:08] be alone. I'm going to be a father
[1:57:12] with the essence of the father.
[1:57:16] And that'll be the essence part of the
[1:57:18] essence of the heavenly home.
[1:57:24] The essence is a spiritual
[1:57:27] divine nature.
[1:57:31] I have people ask me,
[1:57:34] and I'm only using this as a personal
[1:57:36] example,
[1:57:39] and I'm going to close, but I've had
[1:57:42] people ask me, "What is it like
[1:57:46] When you were in the same place,
[1:57:50] when you shook brother Ben Brandham's
[1:57:51] hand, what was it like?
[1:57:55] You're asking me
[1:57:57] to describe something that I don't have
[1:58:00] the language for.
[1:58:04] There's no language.
[1:58:07] What was it like
[1:58:10] when you got saved?
[1:58:13] But you know that you're saved. You know
[1:58:16] something happened.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; What could turn you around?
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; What could cause your desires to change
[1:58:27] completely?
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Paul, what caused the things that you
[1:58:33] once loved that you now hate? What
[1:58:36] caused that?
[1:58:38] You want them? He never tried to explain
[1:58:40] that.
[1:58:41] How can I explain something that I used
[1:58:44] to love and used to do and I spent my
[1:58:46] life and I I wanted to be that
[1:58:56] I'm a man. I'm a father.
[1:59:00] I have a daughter back there.
[1:59:03] She excelled.
[1:59:09] She excelled in
[1:59:12] gymnastics.
[1:59:15] Excel in a way
[1:59:18] [clears throat]
[1:59:19] that perhaps you wouldn't believe.
[1:59:22] My wife made a mistake and got to the
[1:59:26] school over here
[1:59:29] and it was the wrong night.
[1:59:32] Well, we could have gone away from there
[1:59:34] and said, "Oh, yeah, how mar how
[1:59:37] wonderful. God, it happened the wrong
[1:59:39] night. It was just totally
[1:59:40] supernatural."
[1:59:43] Everything good
[1:59:45] is not necessarily from God.
[1:59:52] and a man man who obviously my wife
[1:59:56] realized that they were there on the
[1:59:58] wrong night
[2:00:00] and there was a a certain class the
[2:00:03] girls were going through certain
[2:00:04] tumbling and my wife went over to him
[2:00:07] and said doesn't even know his name I
[2:00:09] said I'm sorry you know I'll I'll just
[2:00:12] put the girls in the car and leave he
[2:00:15] said no no no just let them said let
[2:00:18] them just fool around they can and when
[2:00:21] the evening was over.
[2:00:25] He comes over and he says, "Who's that
[2:00:27] little girl? Do you know her?" She said,
[2:00:30] "Well, yeah, that's my my daughter."
[2:00:34] He said, "You know,"
[2:00:37] [clears throat] and this man's name is
[2:00:38] Mr. Hemingway,
[2:00:41] and he took the Canadian gymnastic team
[2:00:45] to the gold medal at the World Olympics.
[2:00:50] And he said,
[2:00:53] "I'd like to have her." He said, "It's
[2:00:56] just something.
[2:00:58] It's just something in the step
[2:01:04] that he says, you have to be born with
[2:01:06] it. You know, I'd like to have her."
[2:01:10] I'll make this short.
[2:01:13] After a year or two, I can't tell. She
[2:01:16] at 10 years old she goes to Switzerland
[2:01:19] to the gymnastrada and blah blah blah
[2:01:22] blah. All this time it doesn't mean
[2:01:24] anything to us. You understand brother
[2:01:27] James doesn't mean anything
[2:01:30] cuz that's not the kingdom we're in.
[2:01:34] We go to church.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I far sooner see the Holy Spirit come
[2:01:39] upon her at 10 years old instead of
[2:01:42] going. But anyway, we just go along with
[2:01:44] it. girls have to have something to do.
[2:01:48] And now they're
[2:01:53] now it gets serious. Then we get a
[2:01:55] letter from the
[2:01:58] from the
[2:02:00] coach of the Olympic coach in Montreal
[2:02:05] says, "I'm coming out.
[2:02:08] I'm going to come out
[2:02:10] and have two girls,
[2:02:13] Joanne and one other girl
[2:02:16] perform before her for the Olympics.
[2:02:21] Now it's serious.
[2:02:23] Now we are serious.
[2:02:27] Mother,
[2:02:31] what's a mother supposed to do? Say,
[2:02:32] "Oh, isn't this wonderful? The Lord has
[2:02:35] worked all things out." No, my mother,
[2:02:38] my wife is heavy of heart.
[2:02:43] This isn't what we want.
[2:02:46] And now we're faced with an issue.
[2:02:47] Here's a Here's one of your children
[2:02:50] that are just just going to the sky,
[2:02:56] taking pictures of the newspapers,
[2:02:58] taking pictures down in Boisee, Idaho.
[2:03:02] She just came off from gym from the
[2:03:05] gymnast and they're taking pictures of
[2:03:07] her doing flips
[2:03:10] and it's in the newspaper.
[2:03:13] I never even kept one. Sorry, Joanne.
[2:03:17] Never even kept one. She'd gotten
[2:03:19] medals.
[2:03:21] Then they took the gold and the silver
[2:03:24] and bronze for Western Canada, the gold
[2:03:26] and silver for British Columbia, this
[2:03:29] state.
[2:03:34] But something happened. I won't give you
[2:03:35] the details.
[2:03:38] And the father of the other girl
[2:03:44] accused the coach of something that
[2:03:48] didn't happen.
[2:03:52] And he calls me on the phone that night.
[2:03:56] This is brother Ed Bisll.
[2:04:00] And this man says he's the father of the
[2:04:03] other daughter. He says, "My that man
[2:04:08] did something wrong and I'm going to
[2:04:11] kill him."
[2:04:14] I said, "Well, don't do that."
[2:04:18] I said, "You you you'll go to prison.
[2:04:20] You you may hang for that." He said,
[2:04:23] "No, I don't care." He says, "I'm going
[2:04:26] to kill him tonight.
[2:04:30] and I intercede
[2:04:33] and I said, "Don't do that. Whatever you
[2:04:35] do, don't do that."
[2:04:38] And a little later that same night and
[2:04:41] we had started to pray, "Oh God,
[2:04:45] we don't want our daughter to be a gold
[2:04:48] medalist at the gymnasium at the World
[2:04:52] Olympics. That didn't mean nothing to
[2:04:54] us. World to us is a new heaven."
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. and a new [clears throat] earth.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Even back then, we didn't have the
[2:05:02] future home, but we believed in a
[2:05:05] another place. I'm meant to go to
[2:05:08] heaven.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Whatever that means. I can't describe
[2:05:12] it, but I I'm meant to go there. That's
[2:05:14] what I gave my life to Jesus Christ.
[2:05:20] And knock came into our door late at
[2:05:23] night and it was the Olympic coach.
[2:05:27] He says, "I'm leaving. I'm resigning. I
[2:05:31] want to come here tonight to let you
[2:05:33] know I'm resigning.
[2:05:35] I will not be Joanne's coach anymore,
[2:05:38] but I'll I'll recommend her to a a club
[2:05:43] at North Vancouver so she can continue."
[2:05:47] Well, she never did. And God arranged
[2:05:49] made another arrangement
[2:05:51] so that it wasn't us stepping in her way
[2:05:55] and stopping the God knows exactly how
[2:05:58] to do things.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly how to do things. Can
[2:06:02] you say amen for me?
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; I I'm so thankful he knows how to do it.
[2:06:09] And he just took her out of that. And it
[2:06:11] wasn't me that stopped it. It was her
[2:06:14] coach that stopped it. And I just thank
[2:06:16] God for it. so that I could I said if I
[2:06:20] said to myself
[2:06:22] if
[2:06:26] she's going to have a bitterness against
[2:06:28] the gospel
[2:06:30] says my mother and dad wouldn't let me
[2:06:33] go.
[2:06:35] It's because of religion. It's not
[2:06:38] religion friends. It's something that's
[2:06:41] inside of you. It becomes a part of you.
[2:06:45] You can't. You didn't invite it and you
[2:06:48] can't get rid of it.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; I say if you can get rid of it, go
[2:06:54] ahead.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; I challenge you. You can't get rid of
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Gersian Solomon. You remember when
[2:07:08] Gersian Solomon from Israel was here?
[2:07:10] His wife said to me,
[2:07:14] "How do you become unchosen
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; because I'd suffered so much?" Her
[2:07:21] husband told me she can never get a rid
[2:07:24] of the Holocaust. She can't get rid of
[2:07:26] it. She can't believe that God I said,
[2:07:30] "You know what our prophet called the
[2:07:32] Holocaust? Call it the tender hand of
[2:07:36] Jehovah." Amen.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; And he just looked down.
[2:07:40] That's language he had never heard
[2:07:42] before. I said, "Do you know why he said
[2:07:45] that? Because he said God could not
[2:07:48] bless Israel outside of the promised
[2:07:52] land."
[2:07:54] And he said,
[2:07:56] "That is right."
[2:07:59] Hallelujah.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Finally,
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; even in the simplicity of the common
[2:08:04] language,
[2:08:06] struck a chord with him.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Still writes and wants to come and be
[2:08:12] with you people. And I don't want you to
[2:08:15] be on a mailing list. So, we don't
[2:08:17] invite we don't invite them for that
[2:08:19] purpose. That's not what it's about. And
[2:08:22] I even said to them, I said, "You know
[2:08:24] why?" I said to two of those great
[2:08:28] Jewish Hebrew leaders, I said, "You know
[2:08:31] why you like to come to us is because we
[2:08:34] don't try to convert you. Our prophet
[2:08:37] talked to us
[2:08:39] about you sir
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; and you will believe your prophets
[2:08:45] and they are so taken by that."
[2:08:49] [clears throat]
[2:08:49] Friends, let me tell you, whatever you
[2:08:53] do as I close now,
[2:08:56] you'll not miss. Please do not miss. Be
[2:09:00] serious.
[2:09:02] This world, this world is not my home.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; This world is not my resting place.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, come and go with me.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; To my eternal home. Hallelujah.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Come and go with me
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; to my heavenly home.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Would you stand please?
[2:09:45] Heavenly Father,
[2:09:49] when I say heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[2:09:52] when the disciples asked you, teach us
[2:09:55] to pray,
[2:09:57] you started out by saying, Our Father,
[2:10:02] which art in heaven,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; hallowed be thy name.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come,
[2:10:10] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[2:10:13] heaven. This is what we are looking to.
[2:10:18] This is what our prophet spoke about.
[2:10:22] This is what any true prophet would
[2:10:24] speak about. And we seek to preach it in
[2:10:27] all of its truth, in all of its beauty.
[2:10:30] Thy will be done on earth as it is in
[2:10:35] heaven. Bless these precious people,
[2:10:38] Lord. not only my friends but your sons
[2:10:42] and daughters,
[2:10:44] oh God. And I pray that you'll give them
[2:10:46] understanding.
[2:10:48] May they understand what's been spoken.
[2:10:52] I believe above all things. I pray for
[2:10:57] what's in their hearts and in their
[2:10:59] souls that you will ignite it, oh God,
[2:11:04] and they will determine
[2:11:06] and resolve it set in their heart. I
[2:11:10] will serve the Lord. I will serve you,
[2:11:14] Lord Jesus.
[2:11:16] I am here not merely to go to church.
[2:11:20] I'm here as a witness
[2:11:23] of what you have done and what you are
[2:11:26] doing and we are a witness that you have
[2:11:29] sent this glorious message and we are
[2:11:32] here oh God to put it on the air to live
[2:11:36] it
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; live in us
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; oh God affect others we pray
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; let our lives affect our neighbors
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; affect people that have never spoken to
[2:11:48] us oh God, but set something on, set
[2:11:52] something going within their own hearts,
[2:11:56] Lord, a desire, ignite a desire that
[2:11:59] they want to be a real believer in the
[2:12:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And if
[2:12:06] there's any here, Lord,
[2:12:10] that have not made that determination
[2:12:12] yet, [clears throat]
[2:12:15] there comes a time
[2:12:18] when they want to be serious about these
[2:12:22] things. Pray you'll bless them
[2:12:26] as they make that decision in Jesus'
[2:12:29] name. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:34] Can you play this world? This world is
[2:12:36] not my home. Do you know that one?
[2:12:39] Do we have some words for that?
[2:12:48] [clears throat]
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. I'm just a
[2:12:53] passing [music] through.
[2:12:55] My treasures are laid up somewhere.
[2:12:59] [music and singing]
[2:13:02] The angels welcome me
[2:13:05] from heaven's open door.
[2:13:08] [singing and music] And I can't feel at
[2:13:11] home in this world [singing]
[2:13:13] anymore.
[2:13:15] Oh, [music]
[2:13:17] you know I have no friend like you. If
[2:13:22] heaven is not [music and singing] my
[2:13:24] home, then Lord, what would I do? the
[2:13:29] angels [music and singing] back at me
[2:13:31] from heaven's open door and I can't
[2:13:35] [music] feel at home [singing]
[2:13:38] in this world anymore
[2:13:41] just over in [singing] the glory land
[2:13:44] [music]
[2:13:46] eternally
[2:13:48] and saints on [singing] every
[2:13:51] [music]
[2:13:51] shouting victory
[2:13:54] the songs of sweetest [singing]
[2:13:56] praise
[2:13:58] I [music] was never sure and I can't
[2:14:02] feel at home in this world anymore.
[2:14:05] [music and singing]
[2:14:07] Oh Lord, you know I have no [music] you
[2:14:14] not my own
[2:14:17] [music] what would [singing] I do the
[2:14:20] angels that you need
[2:14:25] and I can't [music]
[2:14:28] [singing]
[2:14:28] in this world anymore.
[2:14:34] Oh man, come and go with me [music]
[2:14:38] to my father's house.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:44] [music]
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; To my father's house.
[2:14:50] To my father's house.
[2:14:53] To my [music and singing] father's
[2:14:54] house.
[2:14:56] I always
[2:15:03] [music]
[2:15:08] Jesus will [music] be
[2:15:11] in [singing] my father's house. Yes.
[2:15:14] [music] In my father's house.
[2:15:17] In my [singing] father's house. [music]
[2:15:19] Oh Jesus will be
[2:15:23] in [singing] my father's house.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Why don't you turn around and shake
[2:15:36] hands with somebody?
[2:15:38] Say, "I'll be there. [music]
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; I'll be there.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; I'll be there, too.
[2:15:46] God bless you. I'll be there.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; I'll be there
[2:15:50] for the [laughter]
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:53] I'll be there, too." Yes, I'll be there.
[2:15:56] God bless [music] you. Search me out.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to step out.
[2:16:08] [music]
[2:16:17] [music]
[2:16:19] Sweet.
[2:16:20] There'll be no sorrow there.
[2:16:24] So [music]
[2:16:26] in my father's house
[2:16:29] in my [singing] heart
[2:16:32] [music] in my body
[2:16:38] in my heart
[2:16:42] joy [music]
[2:16:44] joy.
[2:16:47] Amen. That's what I'm looking forward
[2:16:49] to.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Come and go with me. How many want to
[2:16:53] go?
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; I believe it'd be 100%. Why stay here?
[2:16:58] All hell is open it its borders [music]
[2:17:01] and we're looking for that city where
[2:17:03] the lamb
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; is the light.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We heard a
[2:17:09] wonderful word this morning. [music] May
[2:17:11] the Lord strengthen our pastor.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's a great subject. It's a
[2:17:16] great title. The essence of the future
[2:17:19] home.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a it's a deep subject.
[2:17:22] You just look up the word essence and
[2:17:24] find out what it means. It means the
[2:17:26] beauty of God's whole creation. There's
[2:17:29] something that we just can't put into
[2:17:32] into English. It's a we'll need a
[2:17:34] heavenly tongue to describe where and
[2:17:37] [music] what we'll be doing in that
[2:17:40] beautiful city.
[2:17:42] Let's bow our heads [music] and as we
[2:17:44] dismiss and go our way. Father, we've
[2:17:46] enjoyed the word of God immensely.
[2:17:49] Lord, our hearts are turned heavenward,
[2:17:52] never earthly word. [music]
[2:17:55] Father, there's just something in us
[2:17:57] that wants to go a little higher.
[2:18:00] Enoch walked and was not. [music]
[2:18:04] We believe that is the hour we are
[2:18:06] living in. And so, Father, I just pray
[2:18:09] that that anticipation, [music]
[2:18:11] that expectation will become alive and
[2:18:14] real [music] to every son and daughter
[2:18:18] of God. Lord, we're thankful for this
[2:18:20] morning's service. Bring [music] us
[2:18:22] back, Lord, for this evening. We just
[2:18:24] pray, Lord, that you'll speak in a very
[2:18:27] special way. We ask it in Jesus' name.
[2:18:31] Amen.
[2:18:32] I'll be speaking this evening. I'm going
[2:18:34] to take a I'm going to do [music]
[2:18:36] something I haven't done for a long
[2:18:37] time. Going to take a little subject and
[2:18:39] I'm going to preach as hard and as fast
[2:18:42] as I can. If you pull real hard, [music]
[2:18:45] I'll preach real fast and we'll just
[2:18:48] have a wonderful time in the presence of
[2:18:50] the Lord. So, God bless you. Till we
[2:18:53] meet again, you're dismissed in Jesus
[2:18:55] name. Amen.
