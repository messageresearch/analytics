[33:03] &gt;&gt; man. Thanks, sisters.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; He's a holy God. Amen.
[33:09] And uh I'm going to just be before we go
[33:12] to the word now, there's a little chorus
[33:14] I've been it's been going over and over
[33:15] in my mind. And so I thought well I'll
[33:16] just take the time teach it to you this
[33:19] morning just before brother Ed comes.
[33:22] We come broken. We come undone. Amen. We
[33:25] can try to love each other but you know
[33:27] what? We come up short, you know,
[33:30] because we do Lord this morning we need
[33:32] to come to you. So uh little simple
[33:34] chorus. We'll try it. If you put Ryan's
[33:36] microphone on too, he's going to help me
[33:38] sing it. So, uh, I'll sing it a couple
[33:41] times and you can join in and trust it
[33:43] be a blessing to you.
[33:45] [Music]
[33:49] We come broken
[33:51] and we come undone.
[33:54] We come trying hard to love everyone.
[34:00] But we come up short in all that we do.
[34:06] Because we do, Lord, we come to you and
[34:12] we come broken and we come undone.
[34:18] We come trying hard to love everyone,
[34:23] but we come up short in all that we do
[34:29] because we do, Lord, we come to you.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; You stand and sing it with us. We come
[34:37] broken and we come undone.
[34:41] We come trying hard to love everyone.
[34:47] But we come up short in all that we do
[34:53] because we do, Lord. We come to you,
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we come rolling and we come
[35:03] undone,
[35:04] Lord. We come trying hard to love
[35:08] everyone,
[35:11] but we come up short in all that we do
[35:17] because we do, Lord. We come tear,
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we come broken and we come
[35:26] undone.
[35:29] We come trying hard to love everyone,
[35:34] but we come up short in all that we do.
[35:40] Because we do, Lord, we come to you,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. And you,
[35:46] &gt;&gt; you came to show the way, not around,
[35:50] but through. So through it all, Lord, we
[35:55] come to you. And you drove away not
[36:01] around but through. So through it all
[36:05] Lord we come broken and
[36:09] &gt;&gt; we come broken and we come undone.
[36:15] We come trying hard to love everyone,
[36:20] but we come up short in all that we do.
[36:26] Because we do, Lord, we come to you
[36:31] &gt;&gt; and we come broken
[36:35] and we come undone.
[36:38] We come trying hard to love everyone.
[36:43] And we come up short in all that we do.
[36:49] Because we do, Lord, we come to you.
[36:55] [Music]
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord.
[37:03] [Music]
[37:05] Come by here.
[37:12] Come by here.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord.
[37:18] Come by here.
[37:22] We need you, Lord.
[37:24] Oh, come by here my
[37:35] [Music]
[37:43] &gt;&gt; sing it as a prayer. Speak to me my
[37:45] Lord.
[37:46] [Music]

[37:57] We need you. Speak to us, Lord.
[38:01] Speak to me. Speak to me, Lord, Lord.
[38:08] Come back here.
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] Oh, speak to me, my Lord.
[38:26] Oh
[38:27] Lord,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; I am listening Lord.
[38:36] I am listening
[38:38] [Music]
[38:42] now.
[38:43] [Music]
[38:48] I am
[38:51] Lord
[38:54] of my
[38:56] [Music]
[39:00] I am
[39:03] Lord
[39:07] come by
[39:10] [Music]
[39:16] come
[39:21] I wonder if somebody's praying.
[39:24] Somebody's praying.
[39:27] Somebody's praying, Lord.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we got a group of people
[39:31] that's praying.
[39:33] Someone's praying,
[39:36] Lord.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; I'm praying.
[39:50] [Music]
[39:54] Let's lift our hearts in prayer now.
[39:58] [Music]
[40:06] Come by.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, come
[40:16] by.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; With our eyes closed, our heads bowed,
[40:22] we are approaching
[40:24] to the majesty of the Almighty God.
[40:28] And into your August presence we come,
[40:31] Father,
[40:32] through a way that is blood sprinkled.
[40:36] Oh, the precious blood, the sacrificial
[40:40] blood, the price that was paid. And
[40:44] without the shedding of blood, there's
[40:46] no remission of sins. We stand
[40:49] reconciled to God through the blood of
[40:53] the lamb, God's lamb,
[40:55] the Passover lamb. And we remember today
[40:59] this Lord's day, your resurrection.
[41:02] We also remember your suffering and your
[41:04] death. Lord, as we will be receiving and
[41:08] gathering around the communion table and
[41:10] having foot washing, what a time of
[41:13] fellowship, bowing with one another and
[41:16] praying for the body of Christ. I pray
[41:19] that you'll make this day a day that
[41:22] will be so special. Lord, I pray that
[41:26] the enemy will be utterly defeated
[41:28] today.
[41:30] May those that are sick be healed as
[41:33] they hear the word of God. May those
[41:36] that are troubled, oh God, speak peace.
[41:39] May the same words of our Lord Jesus
[41:42] Christ come to them even now, Father,
[41:45] let it come to them, peace be still.
[41:49] I pray father in the name of Jesus
[41:51] Christ that a supernatural unveiling of
[41:55] yourself the revealing of your own
[41:58] person amongst us. Make yourself known
[42:01] through the ministry of the word as well
[42:04] to all our beloved people that are the
[42:07] congregation that are streaming. Lord, I
[42:10] pray you'll enter into every room, into
[42:13] every place, wherever they may be
[42:15] gathered or assembled at this time and
[42:17] whatever time zone they may be in. I
[42:20] pray, oh Father, it'll be hearttoheart,
[42:23] attribute to attribute. Lord, as we
[42:26] fellowship together around the body word
[42:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ, anoint us,
[42:31] Father. Anoint me to speak
[42:35] exactly what you would have said and for
[42:37] the people to receive the engrafted word
[42:40] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:46] We'll be having communion service at
[42:48] 4:00
[42:50] for those that are journeying some
[42:53] distance and our dear friends and
[42:57] believers from Seattle that come for
[43:00] this time. We want it to be a very
[43:02] special time and let's prepare
[43:05] ourselves. It's one thing to announce an
[43:07] event or to have it, but let's prepare
[43:10] ourselves. We don't have communion as
[43:13] often as I would like to have. we having
[43:16] a sizable congregation it's a little bit
[43:20] difficult. I also just want to mention
[43:22] too because it comes to my mind uh we h
[43:26] we had the wedding yesterday for our
[43:29] brother Kyle and sister Sharon and they
[43:33] had announced on Wednesday that we
[43:35] wouldn't be having the prayer service on
[43:38] Friday because we're having the wedding
[43:40] on Saturday and I question I didn't know
[43:43] but all the chairs I found out later all
[43:46] the chairs have to go out of the
[43:48] sanctuary the only place we can put I
[43:50] miss in the chapel. And so if that
[43:54] happens again, maybe we'll just open up
[43:56] some homes and have the prayer service
[43:58] because we don't like to have the prayer
[44:00] service set aside. So when that needs to
[44:03] take place, but I thought some of you
[44:05] may want to know that and I just want to
[44:08] make that clear.
[44:10] I'm going to be reading in the scripture
[44:13] first in first John the first chapter
[44:18] of first John 1
[44:21] and uh
[44:24] I'm going to
[44:26] with God's help
[44:29] uh I I I want to try to bring a subject
[44:32] to you and in order to do so I like to
[44:36] give an overview right at the beginning
[44:40] I want to speak about uh and on the
[44:43] subject which comes out of a a line in
[44:46] the scripture in him is no darkness at
[44:49] all
[44:51] in the message shalom brother Brandham
[44:54] speaks and he takes and reads out of
[44:57] Isaiah 60 1 and2 which we also will be
[45:01] reading there
[45:03] but he said that we are living in a time
[45:07] where faith facing we're actually facing
[45:10] two subjects and we're facing the
[45:13] subject of rise and shine for the light
[45:16] has shone upon you but gross darkness is
[45:19] upon the people so I think I could say
[45:23] with without being misunderstood at all
[45:26] we live in a very dark time
[45:29] gross darkness is upon the world and
[45:32] gross darkness upon the people
[45:36] and the light has risen
[45:38] to shine upon the body of Jesus Christ,
[45:40] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[45:44] But if we do not if we do not dwell near
[45:48] the light or in the light, says if we
[45:50] walk in the light as he is in the light,
[45:54] then we have fellowship one with another
[45:56] and the blood of Christ cleanseth from
[45:58] all sin. But it's very very possible for
[46:02] the light to become dim or it's very
[46:06] possible for us to live say distance
[46:10] ourselves from the light and not be
[46:13] walking in the light and then we are
[46:16] actually in a mixtury. Brother Brandham
[46:19] uses the word mixtury that's why I use
[46:21] it. We we we may find ourselves in a
[46:25] time of you know in a place where things
[46:27] become kind of shadowy and and you know
[46:31] for those that have are men of the woods
[46:34] and have gone out and done hunting and
[46:36] so on and you're looking for maybe
[46:39] looking for your pathway or you're
[46:41] looking to make sure you see what
[46:44] clearly what you're supposed to see. And
[46:48] uh when when you get into a time of
[46:51] shade and deep shadows, your perception
[46:55] changes very much. Things that are
[46:58] standing still. They look like they're
[47:01] moving. And things that are a certain
[47:05] shape, they change their shape and you
[47:07] don't see things very accurately. And
[47:11] that's the way it is. The world today,
[47:14] they see all kinds of things, but
[47:15] they're not real.
[47:17] They see things that they get all
[47:19] excited about and when they get there
[47:21] it's not there.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; So I just want to bring that aspect
[47:28] and secondly
[47:30] that God is associated
[47:33] with light for he is light. I'll be
[47:36] making some of these statements later.
[47:39] But God is also associated with fire.
[47:42] And fire is light, but fire also is a is
[47:47] a purifying
[47:50] element.
[47:53] We've heard much about the baptism of
[47:55] the Holy Ghost and with fire. I want to
[47:59] unite these two subjects together today.
[48:03] the light and the fire. And I want to
[48:07] suggest to you just to I that's why I'm
[48:10] saying it while you're standing.
[48:13] There's been a great deal of
[48:15] misunderstanding I think or
[48:17] misconception of the baptism of the Holy
[48:20] Ghost because people are looking for a
[48:23] single experience. Some brother Bram
[48:26] said they shouted they thought they had
[48:28] it and they didn't. They spoke in
[48:30] tongues and they thought they had it but
[48:31] they didn't. and had all kinds of
[48:34] feelings and emotion. They thought they
[48:35] had it and they didn't. I pondered that
[48:38] over many, many, many years.
[48:41] And I I'm going to suggest to you that
[48:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, of
[48:46] course, is when the Holy Spirit gives
[48:48] life to the word and the life of Christ
[48:50] begins to live out from you. But brother
[48:53] Bradom said, "If you don't think you
[48:54] have battles or struggles after you're
[48:57] filled with the Holy Ghost, just get
[48:58] filled once
[49:00] &gt;&gt; and you'll find out that's when your
[49:01] struggle starts.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And if that's when the struggle starts,
[49:05] that's when all hell comes against you.
[49:08] That's when all darkness comes against
[49:10] you."
[49:13] &gt;&gt; See, that's at that time. And so I'm
[49:17] going to suggest to you that the baptism
[49:19] of fire is actually a a lifelong
[49:22] experience.
[49:24] That fire of the Holy Spirit.
[49:28] All right. Thank you for standing. We'll
[49:30] read
[49:32] John 1 1:7.
[49:36] That which was from the beginning, which
[49:39] we have heard, which we have seen with
[49:41] our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
[49:43] our hands have handled of the word of
[49:46] life. For the life was manifested. I
[49:50] want you to just notice that word
[49:51] manifested.
[49:53] and we have seen it and bear witness and
[49:56] show unto you that eternal life which
[49:58] was with the Father and was manifested
[50:01] unto us that which we have seen and
[50:05] heard declare we unto you that ye also
[50:08] might have fellowship with us. And truly
[50:11] our fellowship is with the Father and
[50:13] with his son Jesus Christ. And these
[50:16] things write we unto you that your joy
[50:19] may be full. Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; This then is the message which we've
[50:23] heard of him and declare unto you that
[50:26] God is light and in him is no darkness
[50:29] at all.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; If we say that we have fellowship with
[50:33] him and we walk and walk in darkness, we
[50:35] lie and do not the truth. But if we walk
[50:39] in the light as he is in the light, we
[50:41] have fellowship one with another. And
[50:44] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[50:46] cleanseth us from all sin. There's just
[50:50] two verses in Isaiah 60. Chapter 60,
[50:54] verse 1 and two.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Arise, shine, for thy light has come,
[51:02] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[51:05] thee. For behold, the darkness shall
[51:08] cover the earth, and gross darkness the
[51:11] people, but the Lord shall rise upon
[51:14] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[51:17] thee. Isn't that wonderful?
[51:20] &gt;&gt; God bless his word. You may have your
[51:21] saints.
[51:33] So although we are in a time
[51:36] when I believe the light has shone
[51:40] uh pure light, holy light, the light of
[51:42] the word, the manifested light, the
[51:44] vindicated word and we can use so many
[51:47] various terms, different terms
[51:51] that uh really says the same thing.
[51:56] Yet there's gross darkness.
[51:59] And if we didn't uh if we didn't have
[52:02] what we have, I think that uh a person
[52:05] could become perhaps cynical
[52:09] of the world or where we're in. You hear
[52:12] of such we we actually become numb. We
[52:16] hear so much that's taking place, such
[52:19] atrocities,
[52:22] such injustices,
[52:24] such irreconcilable
[52:26] events that are happening on a local
[52:29] level, on a national level, in the city,
[52:33] we hear of these things and being
[52:36] sensitive as we are, I believe we should
[52:38] be sensitive, but the world tends to
[52:42] make a person numb and almost
[52:46] uh I insulated
[52:48] &gt;&gt; because that's what happens when you
[52:50] hear of such things and you'd like to do
[52:53] something but but then you can't you're
[52:55] prevented hear people that are hungry
[52:57] and children that are starving and you
[52:59] you sit here with more than you can
[53:01] handle on your plate and you say this
[53:04] isn't right somehow it's not right. It
[53:07] just got hundreds of places to eat and
[53:09] restaurants and all these things and
[53:11] more food in our in our, you know,
[53:15] freezer and in our refrigerator than we
[53:18] can possibly eat. And and and you know
[53:20] that there's multitudes that don't have
[53:22] enough to even survive for the day.
[53:26] Somehow it's not right. Say whoever
[53:28] started this world, it's time for him to
[53:30] come back. Time to for him to set things
[53:33] right. But he will one day. He
[53:36] absolutely will one day. That is a
[53:38] promise of God. But those things affect
[53:40] a believer.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; At least they should.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And there are a lot of things that just
[53:48] take place from time to time. We don't
[53:50] even want to get into it. But such
[53:53] disastrous things that take place. Death
[53:56] is on every hand. And death is darkness.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Death is a shadow, deep, deep shadow.
[54:02] And we're having it all around us all
[54:05] the time. And young people in schools
[54:08] and universities and you hear it on a
[54:11] regular basis now. They're shutting this
[54:13] school down and that school is locked
[54:15] down. And you think, "Oh, maybe it's
[54:17] some far far away place." And then you
[54:19] find it's right on your own doorstep,
[54:22] right in your own town, right in your
[54:24] own country. say h how does a civilized
[54:28] free nation or free country get to this
[54:32] state? How does it how does it
[54:34] deteriorate to such a place? Well, we've
[54:37] had a prophet and he said it's going
[54:39] that direction and it's going to go that
[54:42] direction and the scripture says that
[54:45] the world is going to wax worse and
[54:48] worse. So, we're not looking for things
[54:50] to improve as such. We're looking for
[54:53] things to happen the way God's word said
[54:56] they're going to happen. And when they
[54:58] re when the world rejects truth when
[55:01] they reject when God sends a messenger,
[55:05] sends a prophet messenger. When God
[55:09] sends the spirit of Elijah into the
[55:11] world, people say, "Well, I don't
[55:12] believe there's a spirit Elijah." Well,
[55:14] that's fine. That's up to you. But then
[55:16] you can answer to me, why why is the
[55:18] things happening the way they are
[55:20] happening? It's because a world has
[55:22] rejected what God has sent. And that's
[55:25] why it is the way that it is. And it can
[55:28] only become darker and darker when the
[55:32] light has come and is has been rejected.
[55:36] In the message shalom, he said, "Now,
[55:38] good morning."
[55:40] Good morning means peace. Darkness is
[55:43] gathering.
[55:45] What's it gathering for? What's the
[55:47] darkness gathering for? to show the
[55:50] light.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Arise," to the bride of
[55:55] Jesus Christ, the elect of God said,
[55:58] "Arise." What does it mean? Arise.
[56:03] Stand up.
[56:05] Arise. Become powerful.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; That's what the Hebrew word is. Become
[56:10] powerful.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Arise. Come on the scene. Arise. Become
[56:15] evident. Yes.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Become visible.
[56:20] Arise is to be established. What you're
[56:22] saying, arise, shine. It's not just to
[56:24] stand up vertically, but be established.
[56:28] There's a big difference, but just
[56:30] arising and being or being established.
[56:33] Be established. Arise also is endure.
[56:38] Last,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; not just arise today. It's not just
[56:41] something for the moment. It's not a
[56:43] flash in the pan. Be powerful. be
[56:46] evident,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; come on the scene
[56:49] &gt;&gt; and to endure and to be proven. That
[56:52] means winds can blow,
[56:55] &gt;&gt; tests can come. But you have risen. Not
[56:58] just to rise for the moment, but to
[57:00] arise to be powerful, to be evident, and
[57:04] to be proven. Arise. And has one more to
[57:08] be fulfilled.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I just I did rise. We haven't risen on
[57:13] the scene just to be different. Haven't
[57:16] risen on the scene to have another kind
[57:18] of worship. Haven't risen on the scene
[57:20] just to be dressed a certain way. We've
[57:22] risen on the scene to shine forth a true
[57:26] light, a glory of God. And prepared to
[57:29] be proven, prepared to be tested.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And prepared to last.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just for a moment.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And it's not to deteriorate. It's not to
[57:40] diminish. It's not to become more weak.
[57:43] It's to become stronger and stronger
[57:46] until that perfect light.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; He said in that shalom, I just want this
[57:54] is a setting we're facing here two
[57:58] subjects. He said two subjects. I want
[58:01] you to think about them. He said one
[58:04] contrast to the other. Isaiah says,
[58:07] "Arise, shine, for the glory of God has
[58:11] come upon you and the light is here."
[58:14] And then the very next verse, it says,
[58:16] "Gross darkness is upon the people." And
[58:20] then we are in a mixtury of light and
[58:23] darkness.
[58:24] So we're in a mixtury of light and
[58:27] darkness. And then my address to the
[58:29] church is shalom, peace.
[58:32] Let's find out what it's all about. We
[58:35] are facing this year because it was a
[58:37] new year message really. We are facing a
[58:41] new year with both darkness and light.
[58:44] Here's the phrase I want you to hear.
[58:48] The world is one of the most is in one
[58:50] of the most chaotic times
[58:54] of darkness that has ever stood in. And
[58:58] yet it's standing in again the most
[59:00] blessed light that it ever shined in.
[59:05] I would say since ' 64 1964 when that
[59:08] was spoken just a year prior to brother
[59:12] Brandham's going less than a year I
[59:15] would say that the darkness has gotten
[59:18] to an oppressive state
[59:21] &gt;&gt; and the light from that time I would say
[59:25] very few people if any really understood
[59:27] what he was talking about but we have
[59:30] seen the light of the message that has
[59:34] spread spread over the earth.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; He spoke to maybe 30, 40 people like he
[59:38] was speaking to 30, 40, thousands or
[59:42] hundreds of thousands cuz he knew. He
[59:45] knew they were going. I listened to him
[59:46] the other day. He said probably maybe
[59:48] 30, there may be 40 people there. But
[59:50] you have to realize this is going to the
[59:52] world. How'd he know it was going to the
[59:55] world? Only a prophet knew it was going
[59:57] to the world. He could say it was going
[59:59] to the world. He knew we'd be here
[1:00:01] today. Hallelujah. God sent this word
[1:00:04] for a people. He knew that word would
[1:00:06] call out a people. He knew it was light.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; He knew it was a glorious light.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Rise. Shine. Your light has
[1:00:18] come. And the glory of God has come upon
[1:00:21] his people.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. It's time for the
[1:00:26] people of God to rejoice in that.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and recognize that light and
[1:00:32] be thankful for that light.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; The world is in another scene. So, we
[1:00:40] don't want to
[1:00:42] uh become too taken up with it. But
[1:00:44] there are some very very interesting
[1:00:46] things. The darkness that we will speak
[1:00:50] about for just briefly, there's darkness
[1:00:53] on a a national level. There's a
[1:00:56] darkness on a universal level in the
[1:01:00] world and brother Brandham spoke about
[1:01:01] it. He touched on it. I don't want you
[1:01:04] to lose my subject as I just touch on
[1:01:07] this. But in the in the message shalom,
[1:01:10] while we just read this uh touched on
[1:01:13] this paragraph and it quickens us right
[1:01:15] away, but he spent a good part of that
[1:01:18] message speaking about the pope going to
[1:01:22] Jerusalem and the moon and the light
[1:01:26] going out and the darkness on the earth.
[1:01:29] And he's speaking about the darkness in
[1:01:31] within the religious system. And so he's
[1:01:34] he you see he's not just a messenger to
[1:01:38] give a sign and reveal a secret of the
[1:01:40] heart and pray for somebody that's sick.
[1:01:42] But now and it wasn't just for the
[1:01:44] church of the city that he was in. And
[1:01:47] it wasn't just for America as a nation,
[1:01:50] but it was for the whole world.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't only for the whole world,
[1:01:55] but he was speaking on behalf of the God
[1:01:57] of creation, who's a God of the
[1:02:00] universe, who's a God of
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; only God. There is true God, true living
[1:02:05] God. And so he could speak about the
[1:02:07] planetary system and the moon and the
[1:02:10] sun and all of those things because it
[1:02:12] all merges down into one subject.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; God is light.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; And God created great lights in the
[1:02:21] heavens to rule the day and to rule the
[1:02:23] night. Same God, same God that sends a
[1:02:26] word, a light to rule in your life.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; A great light to shine and rule in your
[1:02:33] light. When a light shines and darkness
[1:02:35] dissipates, and he uses the terminology,
[1:02:38] when the light shines and it presses,
[1:02:41] and I love that, it presses the darkness
[1:02:43] back where it should be.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where I tie it into the
[1:02:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost because the
[1:02:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost is none other
[1:02:52] than the spirit of God himself coming
[1:02:55] and it strikes the seed and life comes.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; With life comes light and light comes.
[1:03:02] And what does the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost do? When light comes, it starts to
[1:03:07] press the darkness back where it should
[1:03:10] be.
[1:03:12] And if we should walk kind of in the
[1:03:15] shadows or we walk uh away from the
[1:03:19] light, we might allow questions to begin
[1:03:23] to dominate our minds. Then our minds
[1:03:26] become clouded and our vision becomes
[1:03:30] unclear. We don't see things the way
[1:03:33] perhaps that we ought to see. be our our
[1:03:36] our decisions and all become kind of
[1:03:39] clouded because of the shadows. But soon
[1:03:42] as light comes
[1:03:45] and the manifested word is the light and
[1:03:47] soon as light comes, you'll find that
[1:03:50] which was a question dissolves.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That which was unclear about your
[1:03:59] decision dissolves.
[1:04:01] Maybe you came to church this morning
[1:04:03] wondering about something, thinking
[1:04:05] about something, just uh looking to the
[1:04:08] Lord about something, and you hold it in
[1:04:10] your heart. You haven't got a clear
[1:04:12] decision on it. And then as you hold it
[1:04:15] steady and you're sincere, then the
[1:04:17] preaching of the word comes. Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] And with the preaching of the word comes
[1:04:22] manifestation
[1:04:24] of God himself and the question leaves.
[1:04:28] Hallelujah. The answer has come.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Manifesting the word.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; We can go through very difficult times.
[1:04:39] We go through dark places. Even as
[1:04:42] believers,
[1:04:45] we go through sometimes dark places.
[1:04:48] And then all that needs to take place is
[1:04:52] that the Lord Jesus Christ comes and
[1:04:56] manifests himself.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; To manifest himself is to appear.
[1:05:04] To appear.
[1:05:06] He appears to you. He comes to you in
[1:05:09] your situation.
[1:05:11] to manifest himself
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; is not only to appear. But this word
[1:05:17] manifest, I want to get this nailed down
[1:05:19] before we go any further.
[1:05:22] To manifest means openly, something that
[1:05:26] is openly, but it's not just openly. To
[1:05:29] manifest is openly plus to be known.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Something that you come to know. So it's
[1:05:37] not just something that becomes visible
[1:05:40] but now it becomes personal knowledge to
[1:05:43] you
[1:05:45] appear
[1:05:46] and it appears openly
[1:05:49] but it's more than that to manifest is
[1:05:52] also something that is spread abroad.
[1:05:56] It's not something that's hid in a
[1:05:58] corner.
[1:06:00] If the Lord manifest himself to you in
[1:06:03] salvation, one thing for sure, you can't
[1:06:06] keep it a secret
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; because it's meant to be spread abroad.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; And not only is it to be spread aart
[1:06:13] broad, but it's to be it it is to be
[1:06:17] plainly recognized or known.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] And it comes from a part of the word in
[1:06:26] the Hebrew in the Greek rather is not
[1:06:29] only to appear but it is something that
[1:06:32] shines.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; And if it shines it comes from the base
[1:06:39] word light foss that's where we get it.
[1:06:42] Phosphorus light a light. And when light
[1:06:47] comes things appear.
[1:06:51] I don't want to get into it but
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; many times because I've been a man of
[1:06:57] actually was talking to my wife
[1:06:59] yesterday
[1:07:00] relating a little bit just of our youth
[1:07:03] to each other even parts of our youth we
[1:07:06] don't really know that much about each
[1:07:09] other but uh I spent so much of my time
[1:07:12] I just started to relate the different
[1:07:14] places where I lived and and where I
[1:07:17] lived it was just wilderness I And I'm
[1:07:20] not talking about any wilderness that
[1:07:22] you know about. I'm talking about
[1:07:23] wilderness where nobody lives.
[1:07:26] I'm talking about absolute wilderness.
[1:07:28] You know, your friend has to be some
[1:07:30] wild animal pretty well. There just
[1:07:33] nobody around. That was that was
[1:07:35] wilderness.
[1:07:37] And uh I've been lots of times when you
[1:07:40] know you want to scurry home quickly
[1:07:42] because you know it gets dark in the
[1:07:45] winter time. it gets dark and gets dark
[1:07:48] early in the afternoon, maybe 4:00, it's
[1:07:51] already starting to get dark and uh you
[1:07:55] know, young fellow, you're trying to
[1:07:57] make home and I hope the moon will come
[1:07:59] out so it'll shine on the snow. So, as I
[1:08:02] wasn't really fussy about the dark,
[1:08:04] still not too fussy about the dark. And
[1:08:06] the reason why I'm not too fussy about
[1:08:08] the dark is I like to see things
[1:08:10] clearly. I don't want to have a
[1:08:12] question, what is that up there?
[1:08:16] Spiritually speaking, nothing could be
[1:08:18] worse.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; I wonder about that and I wonder about
[1:08:22] this and I wonder that's why I was so
[1:08:23] glad when the message came.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; I didn't know I didn't know whether
[1:08:27] we're going through the tribulation or
[1:08:28] we weren't going through tribulation or
[1:08:30] are we going halfway up or is it three
[1:08:32] years or is it seven years? And I wasn't
[1:08:34] too sure, you know, here I am going to
[1:08:37] baptize some people. Got them already
[1:08:39] baptized. I'm not too sure how I should
[1:08:41] baptize them. I like to see things. I
[1:08:44] like to know. I like to have an
[1:08:46] absolute. So I haven't got any question
[1:08:49] anymore. Oh, how the shadows flew away.
[1:08:53] How the darkness left when the message
[1:08:55] came. How we thank God for the light,
[1:08:58] the glorious light, and it shone upon
[1:09:01] thee. Don't live in shadows. Don't live
[1:09:04] in darkness. Don't live with your mind
[1:09:06] clouded with questions. An absolute has
[1:09:09] come. And even though the absolute came
[1:09:11] and the light shone in the time of Jesus
[1:09:15] when he came, there were people that
[1:09:17] wouldn't accept the light.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; So what happened to them? They continued
[1:09:22] in darkness. The light was manifested.
[1:09:25] And the apostle said, "And our hands
[1:09:27] handled it."
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; But also Nicodemus said, "We know."
[1:09:32] Because that's what it is. Light
[1:09:34] appears. It appears so that people can
[1:09:37] know. He said, "We know you're a teacher
[1:09:41] sent from God, but they still were
[1:09:43] living in cloud and shadow and darkness,
[1:09:47] and they didn't receive it.
[1:09:50] One of the things that Brother Brandon
[1:09:53] was talking about, and I'm just going to
[1:09:54] take you quickly. I I I wished I'd had
[1:09:58] enough time, but time has been very very
[1:10:02] uh very pressing in the last few weeks.
[1:10:07] But brother Brandham spoke of the uh
[1:10:12] he spoke of the church and its condition
[1:10:16] and the season, the time that he was in.
[1:10:21] He talked about the council of churches
[1:10:24] and he talked about Rome and he talked
[1:10:26] about how things would get to come
[1:10:28] together. But I'm just going to take you
[1:10:30] through a quick sequence.
[1:10:32] in 1954.
[1:10:36] Now you know in 1954. Now you know that
[1:10:39] the World Council of Churches just had
[1:10:42] their first little
[1:10:44] gathering. It was just an exploratory
[1:10:47] type of thing.
[1:10:49] Some great theological
[1:10:51] leaders had gathered and thought even
[1:10:55] prior to 1948. They gathered and thought
[1:10:59] it would be good if we could get great
[1:11:01] religious leaders and start coming
[1:11:03] together and they thought that union
[1:11:05] would be uh a marvelous thing. So they
[1:11:09] spoke about it uh and it didn't really
[1:11:12] happen until 1948. But in 1954,
[1:11:17] brother Brandham says, "The assemblies
[1:11:19] of God," now that was the Pentecostal
[1:11:21] Assemblies of God has gone into the
[1:11:24] council of churches. This is actually a
[1:11:26] prophecy.
[1:11:29] He said, "Which is the" And he stops. He
[1:11:32] said, "They just they just hooked
[1:11:34] theirel right up yonder with the old
[1:11:37] mother harlot."
[1:11:39] It's 1954 before an awful lot of this
[1:11:41] congregation was born.
[1:11:44] So every church organization comes to
[1:11:46] comes from Rome and there's the mother
[1:11:49] of it. I mean this that men and women
[1:11:53] should be free in Christ Jesus to walk
[1:11:57] in light.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Do you think there was many people that
[1:12:00] understood what he was saying then? No.
[1:12:03] I would say none.
[1:12:06] I say that sincerely. I would say none
[1:12:08] really recognized it then. They should
[1:12:11] be able to walk in light and every
[1:12:13] church should be the same thing and that
[1:12:16] is true.
[1:12:21] Then I I this is just some a little
[1:12:24] historical
[1:12:25] paragraph.
[1:12:27] When the second assembly of the world
[1:12:29] council of churches convened in Evston
[1:12:33] outside Chicago in August 1954.
[1:12:38] So I chose this because it's the same
[1:12:40] year
[1:12:41] two Pentecostal leaders were present
[1:12:44] because now this is just brother Bradam
[1:12:47] in 54 said they've already hooked in
[1:12:50] they've already joined in.
[1:12:53] The first meeting was 1948
[1:12:57] and now in 1954
[1:12:59] there's this this document is was put
[1:13:03] together and two Pentecostal leaders
[1:13:05] were present. The first was David
[1:13:08] Duploy,
[1:13:10] a South African who had immigrated to
[1:13:13] the United States in 1948.
[1:13:18] Duply had played a leading role in the
[1:13:21] development of the apostolic faith
[1:13:24] mission, the AMF in South Africa. And
[1:13:28] those of you that are here of South
[1:13:30] African background, and there are many
[1:13:32] of you, you're probably very acquainted
[1:13:35] with that. and certainly the AFM.
[1:13:38] He said he was editing the
[1:13:40] denominational bilingual periodical
[1:13:43] comforter, the magazine, and from 1936
[1:13:48] to 1947
[1:13:50] serving as general secretary of the AFM.
[1:13:55] In 1947, while working with the
[1:13:57] Pentecostal World Conference, which was
[1:14:00] the PWC,
[1:14:02] at Duploy began what would become a
[1:14:04] 40-year international ministry of
[1:14:08] building bridges between Pentecostals
[1:14:10] and acting as an independent
[1:14:12] spokesperson
[1:14:14] for the interpreter of the Pentecostal
[1:14:16] movement. This led him in 1952
[1:14:20] to attend the meeting of the
[1:14:21] international missionary council in
[1:14:24] Willing, Germany, where his
[1:14:28] indefatigable
[1:14:29] apology for the Pentecostalism resulted
[1:14:32] in his nickname Mr. Pentecost. I was
[1:14:35] going to bring the book which is
[1:14:37] available in most bookstores, Mr.
[1:14:39] Pentecost, which refers directly to uh
[1:14:42] brother Duplo. Now, brother Duply,
[1:14:45] brother Brandham refers to him about 117
[1:14:48] times in the messages and he talks about
[1:14:51] brother Duply my good friend brother
[1:14:53] Duply. Brother Duplo spoke and then
[1:14:57] brother Brandham comes into the healing
[1:14:59] line and he was on the platform with him
[1:15:01] and brother Duplo
[1:15:04] then then 1956
[1:15:08] uh comes along and brother Brandham says
[1:15:12] the great council of of meeting not long
[1:15:15] ago I was asked yesterday to represent
[1:15:18] the s I was asked yesterday to represent
[1:15:22] the supernatural working of God before
[1:15:25] 600 and some delegates from all over the
[1:15:28] world if God carries until 1958
[1:15:32] to be in Boston, Massachusetts.
[1:15:35] One of the ministers, a great man with a
[1:15:37] great uh general gospel, David Dupacy
[1:15:42] said, "Brother Brham, when all," now I
[1:15:44] want you to notice now here's a here's
[1:15:47] one of the founders of it. He said,
[1:15:49] 'Brother Brandham, when all the
[1:15:50] delegates of the world is gathered
[1:15:52] together and the Christian nations from
[1:15:55] everywhere is gathered together at this
[1:15:58] great world council,
[1:16:02] just the speaking of the word and the
[1:16:05] power to reveal the Holy Spirit coming
[1:16:08] present talking about his ministry is
[1:16:10] what they identified in his ministry. He
[1:16:13] said, he said, "Evangelicals from
[1:16:16] everywhere will sway in.
[1:16:19] And when they get a faith to live a real
[1:16:22] gospel, it'll close the Gentile
[1:16:25] dispensation
[1:16:26] and issue in the Lord's second coming.
[1:16:30] God can't God can't be just and let
[1:16:33] honest hearts lay out there and sizzle
[1:16:36] in hell for it. He's got to be just.
[1:16:40] He's got to get it to them somehow. were
[1:16:43] in the last day. This was the pressure
[1:16:46] that they were putting on the brother
[1:16:48] Brandham's ministry because he could
[1:16:51] recognize this ministry will bring the
[1:16:54] living Christ to the people, make it
[1:16:58] visible to them. And this is what they
[1:17:00] would need to sway them in.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And bring in the coming of the Lord.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; They had it figured out.
[1:17:11] That is in 56.
[1:17:14] In 63,
[1:17:17] brother Brandham says, "And you
[1:17:19] Protestants,
[1:17:20] you're waiting waiting some big organ
[1:17:23] you're wanting some big organization to
[1:17:26] lead you over.
[1:17:30] Uh, I'm sorry. You're you're wanting
[1:17:32] some big organization to lead over you,
[1:17:35] run over you, to rule you."
[1:17:39] He said,
[1:17:41] "You'll get it." The World Council of
[1:17:44] Churches,
[1:17:46] how can David duplicate, my friend,
[1:17:49] ever on this ecumenical council that
[1:17:52] he's talking about and bringing them
[1:17:54] Pentecostal people into that
[1:17:59] in 1960 prior to that he said, I want
[1:18:04] you to just see, are you following me?
[1:18:07] The false church groups, this is 1960
[1:18:10] now in a revelation of the church age
[1:18:13] series. The false church groups will
[1:18:16] come together in a world council of
[1:18:18] churches. This world council of churches
[1:18:22] is the image erected to the beast
[1:18:29] in 62.
[1:18:32] Now they're bundling them to burn them.
[1:18:35] That's true. They're getting bundled.
[1:18:38] All these organizations, big bundles, is
[1:18:41] coming into one big bundle. That's
[1:18:43] right. What is that bundle? You know
[1:18:46] what it is? World Council of Churches
[1:18:50] forming the image to the beast truly.
[1:18:53] And you people that scared of communism,
[1:18:56] do you realize I put this here? Now, a
[1:18:59] lot of you young people wouldn't know
[1:19:01] 1962 happened to be the height of the
[1:19:04] crisis of the of the cold war. It was
[1:19:07] 1962 there's an invasion. They planned
[1:19:10] an invasion of Cuba and Cuba had
[1:19:13] missiles on it from com from communist
[1:19:16] Russia and the Soviet Union had spread
[1:19:19] over large parts of Africa and China and
[1:19:23] great predominant parts of the world and
[1:19:27] it looked like they would sweep the
[1:19:28] world and stood and and uh uh there was
[1:19:32] radio broadcasts. I've listened to many
[1:19:35] of them and they cried out against the
[1:19:37] communism when it's sweeping the world.
[1:19:40] And it's only voice I know and the only
[1:19:42] voice I think you could ever find that
[1:19:45] stood up one little man and said it's
[1:19:48] nothing. Communism is nothing. It's only
[1:19:51] a tool in God hand. And when God's done
[1:19:54] with it and look what happened and
[1:19:56] people say they stand back and say,
[1:19:58] "Where did the Soviet Union go? How did
[1:20:00] it just fade away?" We don't know.
[1:20:02] America didn't know. The president
[1:20:04] didn't know how it just faded away.
[1:20:07] Well, it faded away because a prophet
[1:20:09] said it would.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Said it would come to nothing.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Here's something that you might pay some
[1:20:17] attention to.
[1:20:21] the Soviet Union, which was the USSR,
[1:20:26] which ruled
[1:20:27] a great part of the entire world and
[1:20:31] certainly was a a a superpower
[1:20:36] and one that made the West tremble.
[1:20:40] It came to its height really around
[1:20:42] 1962.
[1:20:45] Do you know that brother Brandham ne I
[1:20:48] can never f I have not found a place
[1:20:50] where he used the term Soviet Union.
[1:20:54] How does a man preach for all of these
[1:20:58] years and doesn't use the terminology
[1:21:01] that the whole world is using? The
[1:21:04] Soviet Union, the Soviet Union, the S
[1:21:07] USSR, USSR never made references and
[1:21:10] that's only how they were known.
[1:21:13] He always said Russia,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Russia. And if you know anything about
[1:21:19] what's happening today, it's once again
[1:21:22] it's Russia.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; It's not the Soviet Union. So he was
[1:21:25] speaking back there of what it would be
[1:21:28] now
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; clearly. Are you understanding me? You
[1:21:33] young people getting more than a
[1:21:35] history. When you have a prophet, you've
[1:21:37] got the future right there before you.
[1:21:40] It's more than tomorrow morning's
[1:21:41] newspaper.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; It's more than what the journalists can
[1:21:45] comprehend. And they wanted to know how
[1:21:48] it would fall, how it would how it how
[1:21:50] it could collapse the way it collapsed.
[1:21:53] Because a prophet said that every Jew of
[1:21:56] the 144,000
[1:21:58] would have to be back in Israel and
[1:22:01] Russia would not let them go. So God
[1:22:05] demolished it.
[1:22:07] God brought them down to nothing because
[1:22:10] they had to let those Jews go.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; I stood in Israel and they said that
[1:22:16] they didn't know how many to expect to
[1:22:18] come from the Soviet Union, the former
[1:22:21] Soviet Union. Do you know how many came?
[1:22:24] 720ome,000
[1:22:27] uh people came, Jews came from those
[1:22:30] countries. It was just incredible. And
[1:22:32] they could not get out. But because that
[1:22:35] whole system wouldn't allow them out,
[1:22:39] God simply destroyed. They they went
[1:22:42] bankrupt.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; But Russia, not the Soviet Union, Russia
[1:22:47] is rising again.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Russia's got a leader, a powerful
[1:22:53] leader, and he's brought them back to
[1:22:56] their pride.
[1:22:58] brought them back to where they're proud
[1:23:00] of themselves and their nation is rising
[1:23:03] economically and militarily very much
[1:23:06] militarily.
[1:23:08] So prophet knew exactly what he was
[1:23:10] talking about.
[1:23:14] So he didn't speak about things that
[1:23:15] were unimportant.
[1:23:18] But he says here and it is 62 they're
[1:23:22] bundling them to burn. They're getting
[1:23:24] them bundled. He said, 'You people
[1:23:27] that's scared of communism, I want to
[1:23:29] show you I want you to show me one place
[1:23:32] in the Bible where communism will rule
[1:23:35] the world. Well, he says, I'll tell you
[1:23:38] the Bible says that Romanism will rule
[1:23:40] the world. And that's exactly right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; In the way of a true prophet, he said,
[1:23:46] look at our nation today. Look what
[1:23:49] we're trying to do. The very thing that
[1:23:51] took place in the dark ages. in the dark
[1:23:54] age, unite the church and state
[1:23:57] together. He said, look at the union or
[1:24:00] the world council of churches and all
[1:24:02] the churches going into this world
[1:24:05] council of churches. Now you see you
[1:24:08] folks didn't live in the dark ages. Oh
[1:24:10] my, I'm so glad we didn't live in the
[1:24:12] dark ages. Oh yeah, but you are.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; He said this union now is just the same
[1:24:17] as the dark ages.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; You would look around at you. you look
[1:24:23] around and see what is taking place. And
[1:24:26] I just started the little service this
[1:24:28] morning by saying
[1:24:31] we live in a very dark, chaotic time.
[1:24:34] Darkness, gross darkness according the
[1:24:36] prophet Isaiah's over the earth. But
[1:24:39] we're seeing it.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; We see it all the time.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; We're touched by it, are we not?
[1:24:48] If that is so,
[1:24:52] here's the clincher. If that is so, I
[1:24:55] would say that nations such as America
[1:24:58] and Canada, Britain, and those that
[1:25:02] claim to be Christian nations and those
[1:25:06] are Christian nations of Europe and the
[1:25:09] nation is supposed to be Christian
[1:25:12] nation. I will say
[1:25:16] I'll go on record of saying if that is
[1:25:19] so the Christian nations the church has
[1:25:23] miserably failed.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; How can the church have such freedom
[1:25:29] such liberty and broadcast their gospel
[1:25:32] everywhere and let let darkness come in?
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Where does this darkness came in?
[1:25:37] Because they refused the light.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; There is no other answer. They refused
[1:25:43] the light and the darkness came in.
[1:25:46] There is no light to press the darkness
[1:25:48] back out where it belonged. That's why
[1:25:51] the churches wherever they are, the
[1:25:53] world has come in. The world has come
[1:25:56] in. Darkness has come in. Sin has come
[1:25:59] in. Worldliness has come in because the
[1:26:02] light has been refused. And though and
[1:26:05] that that speaks on an international
[1:26:07] level, speaks on a global level, but
[1:26:09] that speaks also on a church level. And
[1:26:12] it speaks on the home level. If the home
[1:26:14] doesn't have the light in it, the world
[1:26:17] will come in. And if you don't keep the
[1:26:20] light in receiving the light, the light
[1:26:22] that God has sent in your own heart,
[1:26:25] vibrant in your own heart, I can
[1:26:27] announce to you in a prophecy, the world
[1:26:30] will come in
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; and you'll have trouble
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; and you'll stumble and you'll question
[1:26:39] and you'll wonder, "Why isn't it
[1:26:41] working?" It's not working because
[1:26:43] you're refusing the light.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; There's only one light.
[1:26:49] Pay attention now this morning.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; There's only one light.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You need to receive the light, the
[1:26:56] engrafted word, the manifested word for
[1:26:59] this time.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's why people who go by what they
[1:27:04] think. Oh, I think this, I think that, I
[1:27:08] reason this. I believe that. I don't
[1:27:10] care what you think. Your what your
[1:27:12] thought is is never going to bring light
[1:27:15] into my soul. I receive thus sayaith the
[1:27:18] Lord and that brings light into my soul
[1:27:21] and that presses the darkness back where
[1:27:23] it belongs.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; We're glad the darkness has been pressed
[1:27:30] back.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; People can say whatever they want to
[1:27:33] say. You know what they say about our
[1:27:34] church? I don't care what they say about
[1:27:36] our church.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say about it. One
[1:27:40] thing I know, we're seeking to walk in
[1:27:42] the light as we see it in the word of
[1:27:44] God. Preach it the way the prophet
[1:27:46] preached it. Hallelujah. And it presses
[1:27:49] the darkness back where it belongs.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; People that aren't a church this morning
[1:27:59] that could be a church. Oought to be a
[1:28:01] church. You know where they are?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; They're in a They're in a very dangerous
[1:28:06] place because darkness starts pressing
[1:28:09] in.
[1:28:14] God speaks of an individual heart and
[1:28:17] they know they ought to make that right.
[1:28:19] They ought to go to that brother, ought
[1:28:21] to go to that sister, ought to go to
[1:28:23] that husband, ought to go to that wife,
[1:28:25] parents to the parents of the children
[1:28:27] or children to the parents. And to hold
[1:28:29] back, hold back. Let me tell you what
[1:28:30] happens. Darkness,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; shadows start to come in
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; and you can't see clearly how to walk.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; The light is here,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; but you need to let the light shine.
[1:28:46] And when you let the light shine,
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; oh how blessed it is.
[1:28:52] Hallelujah.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; I won't go on in this but I have it
[1:29:02] right up till 1996 here where the
[1:29:05] Pentecostal world council there was
[1:29:08] three great leaders duplic
[1:29:13] and a man by the name of flowers. Those
[1:29:15] are the three great leaders of the whole
[1:29:17] Pentecostal movement that brought the
[1:29:19] Pentecostal movement into the world
[1:29:20] council of churches and uh
[1:29:24] and uh re Reverend G or Dr. G he was
[1:29:28] from England and at the very first
[1:29:31] meeting in 1948 he just went into
[1:29:34] remorse that Pentecostal that
[1:29:36] Pentecostal leaders weren't there said
[1:29:39] to think that they had this great and
[1:29:41] grand and glorious opportunity and we
[1:29:43] weren't even represented there and he
[1:29:45] was despondent about that and it writes
[1:29:48] about that but these three men
[1:29:53] had it as a personal mission that they
[1:29:56] must bring pen Pentecost into the World
[1:29:58] Council of Churches. Now, get the
[1:30:00] picture.
[1:30:02] It's the same as reading in the Bible.
[1:30:04] Elijah's right with the king. Ahab's
[1:30:06] going one direction. Elijah screaming
[1:30:08] against him.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; The leaders that were with wanting
[1:30:11] they're all in favor of Elijah and all
[1:30:13] of their prophets of the all prophets of
[1:30:15] the king and all of it and all screaming
[1:30:17] one thing and and and one prophet is
[1:30:20] standing up, one voice saying, "You're
[1:30:22] going the wrong direction.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; God won't bless it." And there's there
[1:30:26] he is representing the light. The very
[1:30:29] word coming out of the prophet's mouth
[1:30:30] that is the light. And they're
[1:30:32] determined to reject the light and go on
[1:30:34] into their darkness and go into their
[1:30:36] idolatry. Here stood here is here here
[1:30:39] stood the prophet of this day on the
[1:30:41] platform crying out. And there was David
[1:30:44] Dupy sitting right on the platform
[1:30:47] and wanting to bring this gift and
[1:30:48] wanting to bring this ministry. Oh, if
[1:30:50] we could just bring this in my it is so
[1:30:53] powerful. It is so perfect. It will sway
[1:30:55] them all in.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; And he's telling them it's the image of
[1:30:59] the beast.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; It's the image. It's going to bring
[1:31:03] people into darkness.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Look where it is.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, don't take it
[1:31:11] lightly that God by grace has brought
[1:31:13] you. You're not just sitting in a church
[1:31:15] this morning. You're not just hearing a
[1:31:17] little preacher preach. You want to
[1:31:19] thank Almighty God that he ever opened
[1:31:22] up your eyes and your understanding and
[1:31:24] gave you a revelation. If it wasn't for
[1:31:27] that, you'd be out there, too.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; It's nothing good that we've done. It's
[1:31:33] God's grace
[1:31:35] upon us.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Look at the darkness you'd be in.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Look at where you'd be. But where your
[1:31:43] Catholic people would be
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; and a home I was born in trying to make
[1:31:48] me kiss idols when I was a little child.
[1:31:50] I thought it was so foolish me kiss this
[1:31:53] wooden idol. It was so strange. But the
[1:31:56] the Just think where we'd be.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Think where you'd be. Pentecost
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; featuring some glamorous celebrity or
[1:32:04] whatever more having some rock band on
[1:32:07] the platform. Think where you'd be.
[1:32:10] Think what you'd be diving to.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; They talk about rock. We got the rock.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; We got the rock of re revelation.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah. Flesh
[1:32:28] and blood hath not revealed this unto
[1:32:30] thee, but my father which is in heaven
[1:32:33] hath revealed it unto thee. Therefore,
[1:32:36] you can rejoice.
[1:32:44] Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Hiding some of your faces. I want to
[1:32:48] look down your face.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; They said that Morty more than 30 30 uh
[1:32:58] persons attended the meeting. This
[1:33:01] particular meeting in Costa Rica.
[1:33:07] Separate statements were issued by
[1:33:08] Pentecostals from North and South
[1:33:10] America and representatives of the World
[1:33:13] Council of Churches
[1:33:16] following a joint meeting in San Jose
[1:33:20] from 4 to 6th of June
[1:33:23] of 1996.
[1:33:26] And they were organized.
[1:33:28] It was organized by the world council of
[1:33:31] churches office
[1:33:34] of ecumenical relations. And the
[1:33:36] conferences.
[1:33:38] The conference came from a conferies
[1:33:41] rather came from 11 Pentecostal groups
[1:33:45] in the United States and in Latin
[1:33:47] America and from historic Protestant and
[1:33:50] Orthodox members. historic Orthodox and
[1:33:54] and and uh Protestant members of the
[1:33:57] World Council of Churches
[1:33:59] and they said
[1:34:01] they summarized
[1:34:04] and through the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:06] we also explored common areas in which
[1:34:10] our Christian faith is bringing us
[1:34:13] closer together.
[1:34:15] They concluded we
[1:34:17] the response of the participants from
[1:34:19] the world council of churches members
[1:34:22] churches said this. We conclude this
[1:34:26] meeting in a spirit of rejoicing
[1:34:29] realizing that our time together has
[1:34:31] changed our views
[1:34:34] of our Pentecostal sisters and brothers
[1:34:36] and has begun to erase the stereotypes
[1:34:40] that we have held.
[1:34:43] Earnestly hoping Pentecostals will be
[1:34:45] present at the future meetings of the
[1:34:47] World Council of Churches. For without
[1:34:49] their presence, something crucial will
[1:34:52] be missing. We recognize that there are
[1:34:55] differences in the experiences,
[1:34:57] theological views, and social outlooks
[1:35:00] of the persons who gathered here this
[1:35:03] week. But the WCC has always been a
[1:35:06] richly diverse fellowship. And we regard
[1:35:09] our diversity as one of God's most
[1:35:12] precious gifts.
[1:35:14] One of these great leaders said that we
[1:35:16] might fulfill the prayer of Jesus that
[1:35:19] they might be one.
[1:35:22] That's not the prayer of Jesus.
[1:35:24] How can a man who's a the a theologian
[1:35:29] miss the prayer
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; that they might be one as thou art the
[1:35:34] as thou as as God and me are one.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; That was his prayer.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Not just that they would be one. But he
[1:35:42] wanted that oneness and unity to be the
[1:35:45] same as as Christ who was the word
[1:35:49] revealed the father dwelling in him. I
[1:35:52] want them to be one as you and I are
[1:35:55] one.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; That's the prayer.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Not that we'll be one in one great
[1:36:00] gathering of of
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; denominational churches.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; That wasn't it at all.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; So, here stands a prophet
[1:36:16] way ahead of the time. Says they're
[1:36:18] bundling them up. They're being bundled
[1:36:21] up now.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Taking it back to the scripture. Gather
[1:36:25] the tears first
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; into bundles
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; for the burning.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Can't get much clearer, can it?
[1:36:49] Hallelujah.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I I
[1:36:57] have so much that could be said. I want
[1:36:59] to
[1:37:01] I'm just going to leave that for what it
[1:37:04] is for you. That's darkness
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; on the international level.
[1:37:13] And the light was there and the light
[1:37:16] was rejected and it went into darkness.
[1:37:19] And there's no there doesn't have to be
[1:37:22] a question in our mind. Why are things
[1:37:24] the way they are? They are the way they
[1:37:26] are because the light has been refused.
[1:37:29] And let it be known to this congregation
[1:37:31] and all
[1:37:33] who are streaming or will stream through
[1:37:36] the archives. Let it be known that
[1:37:40] principle
[1:37:41] cannot be changed.
[1:37:44] Whether it be on a global level
[1:37:48] or whether it be on a national level in
[1:37:51] a country,
[1:37:53] whether it be on a local church level,
[1:37:56] whether it be in the home or whether it
[1:37:58] be in an individual level.
[1:38:01] If we don't lay hold of the light and
[1:38:04] reverence the light
[1:38:07] and embrace the light and receive the
[1:38:10] light inwardly,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; then darkness creeps in.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said one place it just had
[1:38:20] a little light bulb. He says this this
[1:38:21] this light right here is keeping the
[1:38:25] darkness pressing it and keeping it
[1:38:27] outside.
[1:38:30] And I'd say this light that we have,
[1:38:33] this light that we revel in, this light
[1:38:36] that we receive through the engrafted
[1:38:39] word is pressing the darkness till it's
[1:38:41] on the outside. And and you and I can
[1:38:45] sit in our little enclave
[1:38:48] of protection
[1:38:50] under the under the leadership of the
[1:38:52] Holy Spirit and we see all this
[1:38:54] darkness. Don't be don't be affected by
[1:38:57] it and don't be afflicted by it.
[1:39:00] You can recognize that it's there, but
[1:39:02] don't be affected by the fact that it's
[1:39:04] there.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; May I go on? Amen.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; The scripture says concerning Christ
[1:39:16] that in this was manifested the love of
[1:39:18] God toward us because that God sent his
[1:39:22] only son, begotten son into the world
[1:39:25] that we might live through him. He was
[1:39:29] manifested.
[1:39:31] He was brought to appear. And I could
[1:39:34] not describe for you. I could I it's
[1:39:36] impossible for me to be able to convey
[1:39:39] to you
[1:39:41] how
[1:39:43] how many times and how profound the
[1:39:48] prophet put it in such a profound way
[1:39:51] that his entire ministry was a
[1:39:53] manifestation
[1:39:55] of Jesus Christ in the earth
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; and if it and if we don't come to that
[1:40:01] we miss the whole thing we miss the
[1:40:04] whole potency of the of the word, his
[1:40:08] very calling, his very ministry, the
[1:40:12] separating him out from all the rest was
[1:40:15] for one purpose that he could manifest.
[1:40:18] He had to come out of obscurity because
[1:40:21] Jesus came out of obscurity. He had to
[1:40:23] speak the kind of English he spoke
[1:40:26] because Jesus spoke the Galilean
[1:40:28] language which was a gut poor language.
[1:40:30] He had to start with a simple humble
[1:40:33] ministry because the son of man Jesus
[1:40:36] Christ started with that started with
[1:40:38] some miracles. Outstanding miracles
[1:40:40] started with outstanding miracles.
[1:40:42] Gathered great multitudes of people as
[1:40:44] Christ gathered great multitudes of
[1:40:47] people. And they gathered and they
[1:40:49] wondered at the gracious words that were
[1:40:51] coming from the lips. And they gathered
[1:40:53] for the signs and the wonders. And they
[1:40:56] gathered both then and now at the same
[1:40:58] time. And then at some point in Jesus
[1:41:01] ministry, he begins to say strange
[1:41:04] things. At Mount 1958, the prophet
[1:41:08] decided it was time or God decided it
[1:41:10] was time through him to identify how sin
[1:41:14] came in Eden. In 1958, he preaches the
[1:41:18] serpent seed and the people said such
[1:41:21] strange doctrine. And the people began
[1:41:23] to leave and the message came stronger.
[1:41:26] It came stronger with Christ, stronger
[1:41:28] here, stronger here until until it
[1:41:32] finally came where the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:34] himself was completely rejected. And the
[1:41:37] prophet was completely rejected. He
[1:41:39] said, "I've been here in Arizona for 2,
[1:41:42] three years and there's no door been
[1:41:44] open."
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:47] I rejoice in it because it's the same
[1:41:49] pattern,
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; the same God manifesting himself in the
[1:41:55] same way.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And finally, the Lord Jesus is left just
[1:42:00] with his handful of people,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; completely rejected. The same thing was
[1:42:07] here, just a handful of believers.
[1:42:11] Many here didn't see what was happening.
[1:42:13] The disciples didn't understand it. They
[1:42:15] did. We didn't understand it back then.
[1:42:20] And he talks about going. Brother
[1:42:22] Brandham talks about the rapture
[1:42:26] and the coming
[1:42:28] and the resurrection.
[1:42:30] Jesus talks about it in the garden
[1:42:35] rather in the in the in the upper
[1:42:36] chamber
[1:42:38] and then he has communion
[1:42:41] and goes.
[1:42:43] Brother Bram talked about the rapture,
[1:42:45] how the resurrection was going to be and
[1:42:47] has communion and goes.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; How does a man set up that pattern?
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; How does any human do that? It's not
[1:42:56] human. It's divine.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And if you accept it as something
[1:43:00] divine, then light will come to your
[1:43:03] soul.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; And you'll not worry so much about all
[1:43:06] the little things of this life. I say to
[1:43:08] you, forget these things. Get whatever
[1:43:11] education you need to get. Work at
[1:43:13] whatever job you need to work. But
[1:43:15] remember, it's not an important issue in
[1:43:17] this life. We've got one important goal
[1:43:20] and that's a prize that is set before
[1:43:22] us. Eternal life.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; What have we gained the whole world here
[1:43:28] and lose our own soul? What have we
[1:43:30] attained to nothing?
[1:43:38] And thus Jesus could declare and did
[1:43:40] declare.
[1:43:43] I'm going to move as quickly as I can,
[1:43:44] but you help me.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Stay on alert, please, and attentive. He
[1:43:49] declared, "I am the light of the world,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; and he that followeth me shall not walk
[1:43:55] in darkness,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; but shall have the light of life." Amen.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; He said again, "As long as I am in the
[1:44:00] world, I am the light of the world."
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; John said, "That was the true light
[1:44:08] which lightth every man that cometh into
[1:44:10] the world." He was that light.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, furthermore, ye are the
[1:44:17] light of the world.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew it wasn't going to
[1:44:20] be just God above us
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; or God with us, but he knew it was going
[1:44:24] to be God in us.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; That light would be transferred. You
[1:44:28] become the light.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; In other words, you're the answer.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; You're the answer for somebody who's
[1:44:33] next to you.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; You're the answer
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; for your home, for your family.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Should not bring more confusion. Should
[1:44:42] just bring more light.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, Jesus said, was a
[1:44:51] great shining light. He said he was a
[1:44:53] burning that is set on fire. Yeah,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about light and fire.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; He was a burning set on fire and a
[1:45:05] shining light. He wasn't just a shining
[1:45:08] light. He was a burning and a shining
[1:45:11] light.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:14] Not just with the Holy Ghost, that is
[1:45:17] light, but with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Say the word fire.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; That's your portion. Amen.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Light and fire
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; is your portion. That light may strike
[1:45:32] your soul. Say, "Wow, this is so
[1:45:34] glorious." Hallelujah. Just remember
[1:45:36] just down the road, maybe tomorrow or in
[1:45:38] the next 24 hours or the next week,
[1:45:41] you're going to come into one of the
[1:45:42] most difficult times of your life. You
[1:45:44] might say, "I never dreamed I was going
[1:45:45] to have this." Filled with the Holy
[1:45:47] Ghost, and this is what I come into.
[1:45:49] Yes, darkness presses against it, but
[1:45:51] the light that you have and the light
[1:45:53] that you receive keeps pressing the
[1:45:56] darkness.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Hear it now. That's a lifelong
[1:46:00] experience.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; That's a lifelong experience.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get you ready for your walk
[1:46:07] with God and say, "When is this over?"
[1:46:09] Never.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, how do I how do I
[1:46:14] compensate? How do I handle this? Get
[1:46:16] stronger. have more light.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; It's not you that drives the darkness
[1:46:20] out. The light drives the darkness out.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Feed on the word. Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Hear what has been spoken. I receive the
[1:46:30] light
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; of this hour.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; I have been troubled in the last two,
[1:46:38] three, four years. I've been troubled.
[1:46:41] And the thing that I have been troubled
[1:46:42] about is this that the people even in
[1:46:45] other countries and in our own country
[1:46:47] are not taking full making full
[1:46:50] advantage of the message that they have
[1:46:55] to them. It's some books or some tapes.
[1:46:57] It's not. Let me change that.
[1:47:00] What have I said? There on your shelf is
[1:47:04] the revealed light
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; that can drive the darkness that you're
[1:47:09] experiencing out of your life.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; In that word,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; which will make this Bible alive.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; That prophet's message was sent to make
[1:47:20] this word live.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And when this word lives, light comes.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; When light comes, darkness leaves. When
[1:47:30] light comes, the shadows are gone. When
[1:47:33] light comes, you can see things as you
[1:47:35] ought to see them.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You're not worried. You're not scared
[1:47:41] about some boogeyman.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; You're not scared of about some ghost
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; or something that looms up.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; You're not scared of the devil that just
[1:47:52] come oh come comes roaring your way. You
[1:47:54] just say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:56] Christ, boo.
[1:48:00] I don't fear you.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; I don't fear you.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You come, you think you're going to take
[1:48:06] my life. I don't fear you.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I have the perfect light,
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; the divine light
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; of the revealed, manifested word of God.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Manifested word.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; It's appeared.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not just enthused, friends. The
[1:48:25] light appeared. Thus, you appeared. I've
[1:48:28] appeared on the scene. I've appeared
[1:48:30] into my community. When you walk down
[1:48:33] the street, I think of one brother that
[1:48:35] was here and he was got on 18747
[1:48:38] aircraft flying I think from Singapore
[1:48:40] up into Moscow and from Moscow over here
[1:48:45] and he bowed his head to pray. When he
[1:48:48] bowed his head to pray over his food, he
[1:48:50] thought, "How fortunate everyone on this
[1:48:53] plane is, that I'm here, that I can pray
[1:48:56] over my food. They're the safest
[1:48:58] aircraft there is."
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "My," he thought a lot of
[1:49:04] himself. No, his confidence was in God
[1:49:06] who he's praying to. I'm praying I know
[1:49:09] my God.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] John then said, "I indeed baptize you
[1:49:22] with water unto repentance, but he that
[1:49:25] cometh after me, he is mightier than I,
[1:49:29] whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear, he
[1:49:33] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:36] and with fire."
[1:49:39] Many of you that are even seated here
[1:49:41] today within the sound of my voice,
[1:49:44] you've had questions.
[1:49:47] And the question is always with a
[1:49:49] shadow. Do I have the Holy Ghost? Don't
[1:49:51] I have the Holy Ghost? If I have the
[1:49:53] Holy Ghost, what did I get? What should
[1:49:56] I have had? What kind of feeling I had?
[1:49:58] I didn't have any feeling. I didn't have
[1:50:00] any emotion. Do I have it or don't I
[1:50:03] have it? And you got that question. I
[1:50:05] won't have you raise your hand. Lots of
[1:50:07] you have come to me over the years said,
[1:50:09] 'Well, what should I have? Brother
[1:50:10] Brandham even said to one woman, you
[1:50:12] know, he prayed that the Lord would give
[1:50:15] her speaking in tongues because she
[1:50:17] seemed like her faith needed something
[1:50:20] to be anchored in so she would have some
[1:50:22] evidence.
[1:50:24] The evidence of the Holy Ghost is that
[1:50:27] the life of Christ,
[1:50:30] the life of Jesus Christ, not as you
[1:50:33] read of it in a history book,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; not as you read of it as something that
[1:50:37] happened 40 years ago, but the very life
[1:50:40] of Christ start to live in you.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; I was saying as we came out, I wrote it
[1:50:46] on here. Oh, make me more like thee,
[1:50:48] Lord. Make me more like thee. I want to
[1:50:51] I want to be like him.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Not just a lowly Nazarene that walked on
[1:50:58] the shores of Galilee, but when my when
[1:51:01] my those are people that don't like me,
[1:51:04] those people who don't like you and when
[1:51:07] you hear things that are said or things
[1:51:10] erupt within your family, that's when
[1:51:12] you want to say, "Make me more like you,
[1:51:14] Lord. Make me more like you. How should
[1:51:17] I respond? What should I say? What
[1:51:20] should I be doing? How can I be a better
[1:51:22] father? How can I be the kind of husband
[1:51:24] I ought to be? I am the spiritual leader
[1:51:27] in the home. Am I the spiritual leader?
[1:51:29] I am to be the spiritual leader. God,
[1:51:32] show me how I'm be a spiritual leader.
[1:51:34] That ought to be the prayer of every
[1:51:36] husband. Show me what kind of a man I
[1:51:39] ought to be. Let that very life of
[1:51:41] Christ come into me and make me the kind
[1:51:44] of person, oh, I'm not going to put up
[1:51:46] with with all the little excuses of when
[1:51:49] I was kind of born that way or I had
[1:51:51] this kind of a background. Whatever more
[1:51:53] had people say, well, I never had love
[1:51:55] shown to me. I never said it to my wife.
[1:51:58] I don't believe I I've said it in public
[1:52:01] ever.
[1:52:03] So, I never thought about it. We're not
[1:52:06] here to talk about brother Ed Biscll but
[1:52:10] I can't remember a time
[1:52:12] in my life and I do remember back when I
[1:52:16] was three and four years old I remember
[1:52:18] quite clearly I don't remember a time
[1:52:22] either my mother even though she was a
[1:52:24] very very wonderful woman just about she
[1:52:27] probably did I don't remember a time
[1:52:30] ever having and my stepmother of course
[1:52:33] it was she was wasn't that kind of a
[1:52:34] woman never never show any feeling at
[1:52:36] all. Here I go for the fourth time. I
[1:52:39] never remember a time anybody ever
[1:52:42] putting their arms around me and
[1:52:45] embracing me and saying, you know,
[1:52:47] you're my son and love you and here to
[1:52:50] help you and here to be with you and you
[1:52:53] know that phrase, I'm here for you.
[1:52:57] You know, it might be wonderful. You got
[1:52:59] parents that do that. You young people
[1:53:02] do that to your parents. God bless you.
[1:53:05] But I don't have any I don't have any
[1:53:08] sympathy for somebody said, "Well, I
[1:53:10] never had that. You know, nobody ever
[1:53:12] showed me any love and I don't know how
[1:53:14] to show love." I say, "Nonsense.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. Just grow up and face
[1:53:21] God's word and say, "God sent me to be a
[1:53:24] light here. God sent me to manifest
[1:53:27] Jesus Christ and what he is, I am."
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; We are as He is in the world.
[1:53:34] We never had this. We never had that.
[1:53:36] Hey, look, look at the people in the
[1:53:37] scriptures. They didn't have a lot of
[1:53:39] things. But when they were born of the
[1:53:42] Holy Ghost,
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; they're new creatures in Christ Jesus.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; It's not what my mother and dad did for
[1:53:49] me. It's what Christ did for me.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; We've missed a lot of things in life,
[1:53:54] but we've gained everything.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I want you not to forget this message. I
[1:54:03] want you to remember it. We're new
[1:54:05] creatures in Christ Jesus. We're not
[1:54:07] here what our earthly parent left us.
[1:54:10] We're here what our heavenly parent left
[1:54:13] us. Glory to God. May this church rise
[1:54:17] in the name of Jesus Christ into the
[1:54:20] heights of the heavenlies and be the
[1:54:22] kind of man, the kind of women, the kind
[1:54:24] of young people that God has ordained
[1:54:27] and spoke of.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:32] This message was not a simple thing.
[1:54:34] This message didn't come cheap.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; This message cost a servant everything
[1:54:40] he had.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; May we respect it with honor.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; May we say it came. It came for me.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Came that the word would be
[1:54:53] manifested me,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; transforming me into the light of this
[1:54:57] world.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:04] When it says that he was a shining,
[1:55:09] just be a few more minutes. Can I please
[1:55:11] just a few more minutes? Says he was a
[1:55:14] shining. He was a shining set on fire
[1:55:19] and a shining light. A burning and a
[1:55:21] shining light. John the Baptist was.
[1:55:24] Don't forget that was Elijah's spirit.
[1:55:31] Spirit of Elijah is a burning
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; and a shining light.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; He
[1:55:39] that cometh after me.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; He, not the earthly angel, but the
[1:55:44] heavenly one,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; not Revelation 10:7, but Revelation
[1:55:48] 10:1. He that cometh after me shall
[1:55:52] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:55:55] fire. And so the earthly messenger told
[1:55:57] us how to be baptized.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; If you have not been baptized in the
[1:56:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, be
[1:56:03] baptized in his name. For you're
[1:56:05] baptized into his life, his death, his
[1:56:07] burial, and his resurrection.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; That's thus, sayith the word of God.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Nobody needs to sit here and question
[1:56:17] about that. If you question it,
[1:56:18] immediately a cloud comes in.
[1:56:20] Immediately the darkness settles on you.
[1:56:23] Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; When it says it's the word of God, say
[1:56:26] those same things. That's the word of
[1:56:28] God
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; because it's the word of God. That's
[1:56:32] what I believe.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham draws it in a drama.
[1:56:42] said, "And John the Baptist
[1:56:45] standing there in the water
[1:56:48] just just to put it in reality,
[1:56:51] his feet probably down in the mud
[1:56:54] squeezing between his toes
[1:56:57] standing there and he sees Jesus coming.
[1:57:00] Behold the lamb of God
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; that takes away the sin of the world."
[1:57:05] Oh yeah.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus walks up to him
[1:57:09] says, "I have need to be baptized of
[1:57:11] thee."
[1:57:14] Said, "Comest out of me. I need to be
[1:57:16] baptized of thee."
[1:57:19] Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now, for
[1:57:23] thus it behooveth us to fulfill all
[1:57:26] righteousness."
[1:57:28] Brother Brandham puts it this way. And
[1:57:31] Jesus walked straight to the water to
[1:57:33] him.
[1:57:35] And those two eyes of John met the two
[1:57:40] eyes of Jesus.
[1:57:43] He said, "Oh, how I'd love to be there.
[1:57:46] How I'd love to have been there." He
[1:57:48] said, "Another place." Those deep set
[1:57:50] eyes. Of course, you know, Brother
[1:57:51] Brandham had deep set eyes.
[1:57:54] those deep set eyes of John the prophet
[1:57:57] the Baptist standing in the water when
[1:58:01] those eyes met the deep set eyes
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you what
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; friends
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; this the scripture says about the
[1:58:12] shining it's to meet the eyes to bring
[1:58:16] forth light but to meet the eyes and to
[1:58:20] strike the sight when those deep that
[1:58:23] eyes of John the Baptist with the spirit
[1:58:26] of Elijah
[1:58:28] met the eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:58:31] can tell you that light struck just
[1:58:34] struck. Oh, something happened. And
[1:58:38] John, he said, "Let it be so now, for
[1:58:41] thus it behooveth us to fulfill all
[1:58:43] righteousness." And then John took him.
[1:58:46] Oh, he said they were second cousins.
[1:58:48] What an event that must have been when
[1:58:50] they looked at each other's eyes.
[1:58:55] They didn't have to say, they didn't
[1:58:56] have to preach a sermon, but that look,
[1:59:01] you're the word, John.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet must come to the word.
[1:59:10] And John had said, "You're the lamb."
[1:59:12] And he knew and he looked and the
[1:59:15] sacrifice must be
[1:59:18] washed.
[1:59:20] And then he took him
[1:59:23] and baptized him.
[1:59:32] I suggest
[1:59:35] when the very life of Christ comes into
[1:59:37] you as a believer,
[1:59:42] it'll begin to shape your life,
[1:59:46] begin to shape your vessel.
[1:59:48] I want to convey this to you so badly.
[1:59:51] I'm just seeking God, help me to bring
[1:59:55] this down to you.
[1:59:57] Life is filled with pressures. Life is
[2:00:00] filled. This world, friends,
[2:00:03] is a dark place
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; and we become accustomed to it.
[2:00:08] I was in a meeting downtown c downtown
[2:00:11] Vancouver one day, East Vancouver.
[2:00:17] And at that time there was a lot of
[2:00:19] people just uh they had been in the
[2:00:21] hippie movement and they kind of were
[2:00:23] out. It had kind of faded away a bit,
[2:00:25] but there were still a lot of young
[2:00:27] people around and people that weren't so
[2:00:29] young anymore, probably in their 30s,
[2:00:31] late 20s and 30s.
[2:00:34] They'd moved out of their homes and
[2:00:35] everything. maybe during the hippie
[2:00:37] movement when they were in their teens
[2:00:38] or late teens.
[2:00:41] And this young man,
[2:00:44] I would guess he's probably
[2:00:46] 27, 28.
[2:00:50] My girls were there.
[2:00:53] Don't know whether we sang that night or
[2:00:55] not.
[2:00:56] And this fell came up
[2:00:59] and his eyes were
[2:01:02] a glow. You could see that God had done
[2:01:05] something for him.
[2:01:07] He had a full beard and his hair was all
[2:01:10] fuzzed out and
[2:01:13] you wouldn't have paid much attention to
[2:01:14] him maybe on the street, but there was
[2:01:17] just something about his face.
[2:01:21] You could see that God had done
[2:01:22] something. There was a real clear
[2:01:23] sparkle in his eye. We begin to speak
[2:01:26] about spiritual things.
[2:01:30] And there was a little thing at that
[2:01:31] time that you know my daughters they
[2:01:34] thought that only those who had been in
[2:01:37] sin and experienced the depth of sin and
[2:01:40] been in drugs and been in all that you
[2:01:42] know the devil comes to that said well
[2:01:44] you know you can't really rejoice like
[2:01:46] them because they've had such a dramatic
[2:01:49] change and you haven't had that you're
[2:01:51] just kind of born into it and you know
[2:01:55] you born in a Christian home and and
[2:02:00] you haven't experienced that. So you,
[2:02:02] the devil tried to tell you, you can't
[2:02:03] have the same level of joy
[2:02:06] because they've been delivered from so
[2:02:08] much. And I know what Jesus said. He
[2:02:10] that was forgiven of much loves much.
[2:02:14] But he looked at one of my daughters, I
[2:02:17] think maybe two of them, and he said,
[2:02:19] "The God,
[2:02:22] the God that keeps
[2:02:26] is greater or just as great as the God
[2:02:28] who delivers and saves."
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the God that kept you from it is
[2:02:34] the same God that delivered me from it.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; And I thanked him for that. I thought
[2:02:39] that was wonderful. That was such a a
[2:02:42] piece of wisdom. And then he kind of
[2:02:44] looked past us and it was like his eyes
[2:02:47] I could see in his eyes that he was
[2:02:49] going someplace else.
[2:02:52] And he said, "I've been in such dark
[2:02:56] places."
[2:02:58] I never forgot that from that day to
[2:03:00] this.
[2:03:02] I've been in such dark places.
[2:03:06] Oh,
[2:03:08] maybe you have, too.
[2:03:12] How thankful.
[2:03:14] I want you to be able to rejoice.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Think of the bondage. I'd like every
[2:03:20] person to think of where you might be
[2:03:23] right today on September the 23rd, 207.
[2:03:28] Where you might be today if that light
[2:03:30] hadn't come your way. And I can say with
[2:03:34] some good authority, a good number of
[2:03:36] you would already be six feet under.
[2:03:39] Right.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; A good number of your homes would long
[2:03:42] ago have been broken.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And there had been children torn aunder.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; A whole lot of you, all the rest of us
[2:03:51] would be in bondage one way or another
[2:03:54] to one system trying to ek out some kind
[2:03:57] of spiritual fulfillment. But here we
[2:04:00] are today. Oh, thank you, God. Thank
[2:04:03] you, Father. Thank you, Father. Thank
[2:04:07] you for the manifested word. Thank you
[2:04:09] for this light. Thank you for this
[2:04:11] glorious light.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; We love you for this glorious light.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; And we'll walk in this light. Dear Lord
[2:04:22] Jesus,
[2:04:25] there just nothing more to say.
[2:04:29] I have so much more. Just a beginning on
[2:04:32] my notes, but it's the notes are not
[2:04:35] what's important.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; It's your presence. your spirit and what
[2:04:40] you're seeking to do. And I believe Lord
[2:04:43] with the worship and the praise and the
[2:04:46] thanksgiving of the people that must
[2:04:48] bring such a sense of satisfaction to
[2:04:51] your heart. Oh Lord, I want you to be
[2:04:54] pleased. Be pleased in this gathering.
[2:04:58] Be pleased in this service, Lord, in the
[2:05:01] simplicity of this message. Be pleased,
[2:05:04] Lord. I'm I'm going to thank you
[2:05:06] publicly for the message that you sent
[2:05:08] through your messenger. I thank you, oh
[2:05:11] God, every time we've heard, thus sayeth
[2:05:14] the Lord. Thank you, Lord, for the very
[2:05:17] message and the very opening of the word
[2:05:19] that has turned so many others aside, it
[2:05:22] is what drew us to you, oh God. And this
[2:05:26] light is so glorious. It is so bright.
[2:05:28] It is such brilliance as your prophet
[2:05:30] said it blinds others but it gives us
[2:05:33] sight. Oh thank you Lord. Thank you Lord
[2:05:38] for the sight. Thank you for manifesting
[2:05:41] yourself the vindication of your word.
[2:05:43] Thank you Lord for making it evident
[2:05:45] causing it to appear. And because you
[2:05:48] appeared we have appeared. You brought
[2:05:50] us on the scene for a purpose and we're
[2:05:52] here to fulfill that purpose. Lord, I
[2:05:55] say, "Thy will be done on earth as it is
[2:05:58] in heaven."
[2:06:00] We want to praise you now.
[2:06:04] I'll have you stand with me. We'll stand
[2:06:07] together.
[2:06:10] I want you to be free to express
[2:06:13] to say what you have in your heart
[2:06:17] to him.
[2:06:19] I'm going to sing the only chorus that I
[2:06:21] think we can sing.
[2:06:24] We'll walk in the light.
[2:06:27] It's a beautiful light. Think about what
[2:06:30] what's been spoken now. Think about the
[2:06:32] message as you just sing these words.
[2:06:34] Not as you've sung it before,
[2:06:37] but as part, let's make this course a
[2:06:40] part of the message.
[2:06:42] We'll walk in this glorious light.
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:50] will
[2:06:52] walk in the light.
[2:06:55] Oh, it's a new beauty.
[2:07:01] Oh, come
[2:07:03] in the cross
[2:07:07] of mercy.
[2:07:08] [Music]
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Mean it now.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Shine all
[2:07:14] around us.
[2:07:18] And our life
[2:07:22] Jesus
[2:07:27] the world
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:31] will walk in the light.
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:41] Oh, come
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:46] of mercy
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:50] and shine all around us. My day and my
[2:08:01] Jesus.
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely?
[2:08:13] We love him.
[2:08:15] We love him.
[2:08:18] Oh Lord Jesus, we love you as a
[2:08:21] congregation of people. We love you.
[2:08:26] Lovely Lord Jesus.
[2:08:29] You just begin to say it. You begin to
[2:08:31] express it. You see what'll happen.
[2:08:35] Do you have some shadows that need to go
[2:08:36] away?
[2:08:38] Just say, "I'm here, Lord, to step into
[2:08:40] this light."
[2:08:42] It won't be if we walk in the light as
[2:08:45] you're in the light. It will be I will
[2:08:47] walk in the light. As you are in the
[2:08:50] light,
[2:08:52] we will have fellowship one with
[2:08:53] another.
[2:08:55] Oh, in the blood of Christ, you got some
[2:08:57] you got some things, some question. Oh,
[2:08:59] God, we do fail. We do commit wrong.
[2:09:05] We do things we don't we're sorry for.
[2:09:07] We want to say it now. Lord,
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; just remove that from me.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; We all do. Remove that from me. Lord,
[2:09:19] let the light now permeate within and
[2:09:22] press all the darkness back out.
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus.
[2:09:31] We'll walk in
[2:09:34] The light
[2:09:37] it's a glory
[2:09:41] [Music]
[2:09:49] [Applause]
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:52] shine all around us
[2:09:58] and
[2:10:02] Jesus.
[2:10:05] the light of the world.
[2:10:11] You know, I spoke two messages on the
[2:10:14] influence
[2:10:17] and I don't know how this is going to
[2:10:18] fit, but it just comes back to my mind.
[2:10:21] I've been trying to I've been trying to
[2:10:23] end the last two services with this.
[2:10:32] Do you remember the man
[2:10:34] brother Brandham hunted with?
[2:10:37] Said he had lizard eyes.
[2:10:39] Bert was his name. He was so hard.
[2:10:44] He was so hard. Nothing could touch him.
[2:10:47] I want you to think real deep now at the
[2:10:49] end of this service.
[2:10:52] as I'm desiring that your heart will be
[2:10:55] very very touched and moved in this
[2:10:57] presence
[2:10:59] as we prepare for the afternoon service
[2:11:02] in the Lord's table.
[2:11:08] Bird hunted with the prophet. Bird
[2:11:10] hunted with brother Brandham.
[2:11:13] He was able to see his nature. He was
[2:11:15] able to see his character.
[2:11:17] He was able if he was if it was possible
[2:11:19] to be touched by this man. He knew all
[2:11:22] kinds of preachers.
[2:11:24] He knew all kinds of believers.
[2:11:27] None of them. Nobody affected him.
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:35] And then come this occasion
[2:11:38] and he
[2:11:41] he uses that injured or that baby fawn
[2:11:46] deer call
[2:11:50] and out comes this big dough
[2:11:53] deer.
[2:11:55] Walks right out into the open
[2:11:58] just a few feet from them. Turns her
[2:12:01] ears around.
[2:12:04] Where is that baby?
[2:12:08] And brother Brandham said he raised his
[2:12:10] gun that Bert did
[2:12:14] and was holding it. Brother Bram said he
[2:12:16] couldn't look.
[2:12:18] He said, "Blow the heart of that
[2:12:21] beautiful mother dear
[2:12:25] out of her." She's still standing there.
[2:12:27] He said she saw them.
[2:12:30] Didn't pay any attention to them. She
[2:12:32] only had one thing on her mind. That was
[2:12:34] that baby.
[2:12:37] And brother Brandham didn't hear the
[2:12:38] shot. Didn't hear the shot. And he
[2:12:39] looked up and he sees the gun barrel
[2:12:43] begin to tremble
[2:12:45] and finally throws it down. Brother Bram
[2:12:49] said he fell down, grabbed a hold of
[2:12:51] brother Brandham, said, "Lead me to this
[2:12:54] Jesus."
[2:12:55] I got thinking that man's heart was so
[2:12:59] distant and so hard and so callous and
[2:13:02] so whatever more but a mother dear
[2:13:05] preached him a sermon
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; just by being what she was supposed to
[2:13:10] be
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; and many of you you might think oh you
[2:13:13] have to be up here and brother Ed
[2:13:15] brother Diddy brother Lance Brother Tom
[2:13:18] brother John whoever it is listen
[2:13:20] friends we're only servants we're just
[2:13:22] trying to create an atmosphere just
[2:13:24] trying to bring you. Oh, it just desires
[2:13:27] so much. I thought, "Oh, God, if that
[2:13:30] animal
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; could influence that man
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; and cause his heart to break and and and
[2:13:37] actually cause him to come to Christ
[2:13:41] just through that simple manifestation
[2:13:44] of her own nature where her nature was
[2:13:47] ahead of her fear." We've all got fears.
[2:13:50] We've also all got questions. But let
[2:13:53] that nature that God has given you rise
[2:13:56] above that and press all that out.
[2:13:58] You're going to affect somebody else
[2:13:59] that's beside you. You're going to
[2:14:01] affect your home. I don't like to think
[2:14:04] that we preach as hard as we preach and
[2:14:06] seek God and then see people just remain
[2:14:08] the same when they go out. May our lives
[2:14:11] be changed. May our homes be changed.
[2:14:15] May it be transformed. You have
[2:14:16] something greater than a deer. You have
[2:14:18] the Holy Spirit.
[2:14:22] Do you have the Holy Spirit?
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:30] Jesus,
[2:14:32] the light of
[2:14:35] the world. As your personal confession
[2:14:38] now will walk in
[2:14:42] the light.
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:53] us
[2:14:54] mercy
[2:14:56] our
[2:14:59] shine all around us
[2:15:05] and
[2:15:09] Jesus
[2:15:11] the light of the world
[2:15:17] I'm going to pray.
[2:15:20] And if you have
[2:15:23] or have a desire to be included in this
[2:15:25] prayer in some way,
[2:15:28] I'm going to pray for every person
[2:15:31] that God has touched and spoken to in a
[2:15:34] special way,
[2:15:36] that God has spoken to perhaps
[2:15:38] specifically
[2:15:43] that you will now just hold that in your
[2:15:45] heart
[2:15:46] and let God
[2:15:49] answer it. Let God, if you've been
[2:15:51] dwelling in some shadows that you know
[2:15:53] he doesn't want you to walk there in the
[2:15:55] shadows anymore
[2:15:57] and questions, just let go of them. Let
[2:16:02] go of them.
[2:16:05] I know he loves you
[2:16:08] and I love you
[2:16:11] and I believe you love me and we come on
[2:16:15] that basis.
[2:16:17] Dear father, dear gracious father,
[2:16:20] loving father, our heavenly father,
[2:16:25] one who loved fatherhood so much that
[2:16:28] you you came and dwelt in your son
[2:16:32] and there was a such a relationship
[2:16:35] there.
[2:16:37] Oh God,
[2:16:39] looked down and a voice even would cry
[2:16:41] out from heaven. This is my beloved son
[2:16:44] in whom I am well pleased.
[2:16:48] Father,
[2:16:50] we find ourselves in this at this time
[2:16:53] at this junction of time
[2:16:57] and it was not our own choosing that we
[2:16:59] would come at this time. It was not our
[2:17:03] own choosing that we would come when the
[2:17:06] temptations of the world
[2:17:09] are so so pressing upon the people and
[2:17:12] upon our young people. Sometimes I
[2:17:15] marvel, oh God, as I see them sit here
[2:17:17] on these front seats and they honor you,
[2:17:20] oh God, by service after service.
[2:17:23] Father, may I ask that the Holy Ghost
[2:17:26] come upon them and fill them once again
[2:17:29] this morning. Give them what is needful
[2:17:31] for tomorrow and the next week and the
[2:17:33] future days. Give them, oh God, what is
[2:17:36] needful for them. Strengthen them and
[2:17:39] help them, oh God, in this time. I pray
[2:17:42] for our families. Lord, we're struggling
[2:17:44] in a economic time when uh everything
[2:17:48] seems to be at at such a rate and things
[2:17:51] are so expensive and the fuel for the
[2:17:54] car to drive to church, the rent, the
[2:17:56] food, all of these things. These are
[2:17:58] surely the days of Noah once again
[2:18:01] buying and selling and trading and all
[2:18:04] of these things. And these are the days
[2:18:06] of Sodom. We see it everywhere. Oh, let
[2:18:10] the fire of God, let there be a wall of
[2:18:12] fire about us. When the enemy comes in
[2:18:15] like a flood, then the spirit of God
[2:18:18] will raise up a standard against him.
[2:18:22] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:18:24] accomplish your work. I pray in every
[2:18:27] heart and prepare us for the afternoon
[2:18:30] service. And while we're together and in
[2:18:32] one heart, we're praying for our brother
[2:18:34] Ron Spencer once again. Oh God, we bear
[2:18:38] him up and into your presence, oh God.
[2:18:40] And in your presence, the supernatural
[2:18:42] is happening. Uh let new skin, oh God,
[2:18:46] appear in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[2:18:50] pray it'll be so that they won't even
[2:18:52] have to graft it. Oh God, perhaps
[2:18:54] they've commenced, but Lord, bring new
[2:18:57] skin. Oh God, I pray that you'll be with
[2:19:00] the medical team. We thank you for what
[2:19:02] they do. But when man can do no more,
[2:19:05] that's just where you begin. Let his
[2:19:08] lungs become clear. Oh God, we thank you
[2:19:11] for ridding his body of this infection.
[2:19:13] Father, thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
[2:19:16] Lord. We thank you. We'll not hesitate
[2:19:19] to give you thanks. Oh, bless sister
[2:19:22] Connie. Lord Matthew, brother and sister
[2:19:25] Frasier, brother and sister Spencer. I
[2:19:28] pray you'll embrace those people in your
[2:19:30] love. Put your arms around them and may
[2:19:33] they feel a great the strength of the
[2:19:35] great eternal God. And Lord, we'll never
[2:19:38] never forget to give you thanks for your
[2:19:41] goodness. And now Lord, as we depart the
[2:19:43] sanctuary and have some refreshment to
[2:19:47] come back refreshed, I pray our
[2:19:49] conversation will be on spiritual things
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:19:56] Lovely name of Jesus.
[2:19:59] Amen.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:02] Amen. We're going to just dismiss you
[2:20:05] and as you leave quietly and reverently,
[2:20:08] we'll continue with our our song and
[2:20:11] then we're back here at 4:00 and give
[2:20:13] you time for some refreshment and then
[2:20:16] to get back. You are that are on the US
[2:20:18] side. I trust that you'll
[2:20:21] stay with us and have a bite to eat over
[2:20:25] here. Maybe you can invite someone that
[2:20:29] you see that's come from a long ways or
[2:20:32] across the border. Save them crossing
[2:20:34] the border and invite them to your home.
[2:20:37] We got a large assembly. We can
[2:20:39] certainly do that. We'll walk. Greet one
[2:20:43] another.
[2:20:45] Just greet one another. You're dismissed
[2:20:47] in Jesus name.
[2:20:52] Come where?
[2:20:54] [Music]
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; I'll thirsty.
[2:20:59] [Music]
