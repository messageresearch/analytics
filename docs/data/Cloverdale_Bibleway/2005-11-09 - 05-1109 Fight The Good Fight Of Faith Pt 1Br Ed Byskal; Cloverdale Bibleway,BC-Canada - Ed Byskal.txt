Amen. and that we could invite his presence to come and not wonder if he is going to stand here with us this evening. For we know with an assurityity that he is here. &gt;&gt; Why don't we turn the screen to 266. Come to my soul, precious Jesus. Is it good to be in the house of the Lord this evening? Want to greet each and every one of you that have come this evening in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Those on the internet hookup, we trust that you'll be blessed by the service this evening. Who knows what the Lord has in store tonight? Just an ordinary service on a Wednesday night? I don't believe it. Not an ounce. Our God is a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; We might be a natural people, but we're just supernatural beings, like brother Ernie will say, having a natural experience. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thought when you can just catch it just for a second that you're eternal. Hold on to it because it'll go away just as quick as it shows up. We can hold on to it though. I believe it. Let's sing it together. Come to my soul. Oh, come to my soul. Precious Jesus, my Lord. Oh, hear me, oh Savior divine. He's the divine one. Open the fountain and cleanse me, Lord, and give me a heart like thine. Let's all stand on our feet and sing it as an anthem. Oh, won't you come to my soul, precious Jesus, my Lord, hear me, oh Savior. [Music] Open that fountain and bless me, Lord, and give me, oh, a heart like thine. Oh, won't you come to my soul? Come to my soul, precious Jesus, my Lord. Hear me, oh Savior divine, and open the fountain and bless me, Lord. Give me a heart like thine. [Music] I don't want nothing here to hinder me. Amen. Would you desire that nothing hinder you tonight from entering into his courts? Praise and thanksgiving on your lips. Amen. How many would just pray as we sing this song? Lord, don't let me hinder this service. And if we individually can do that, commit it to the Lord. I believe that he'll have his perfect will and his perfect way. I don't want nothing here to hinder me. For some is blessed. I want to see. It makes no difference on the cross or how heavy the cross. I don't want nothing here to hinder me. [Music] Oh, I don't want nothing here to hinder me. For someday his blessed face I want to see. It makes no difference what the cross or how heavy the cross. I don't want nothing here to hinder me. Let's all just lay it at his feet as we sing it again. I don't want nothing here to hinder me. [Music] for someday. His blessed face I want to see. [Applause] It makes no difference what the cost. Oh, how heavy the cross. I don't want nothing here to hinder me. For the more that I surrender, the lighter my Lord, [Music] the more that I release my care, the more you take control, the more that I can humble myself, the Lord, you lift me up. Every day I live. Oh Lord, I love you more. Oh, the more that I surrender. You want to surrender, Father? Lord, your yoke is easy and your burden is light. The more that I release my cares, the more you take control. Oh, the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. What a great reality as we sing it again. Oh, the more that I surrender. The lighter my Lord, the more that I know the more he takes control. Oh, the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I live, Lord. I love you, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, if we could just grasp just that one reality this evening that if we would just surrender, we would just surrender, Lord, and humble ourselves to what you would have for us this evening. Father, we desire to hear from your throne of grace once more. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing number 301 on the screen. He has forgiven me. Keep sing for me. Oh my sins have been washed from his family. By the blood of the lamb of Calary. I know that he hasn't forgiven you tonight. Oh, can you just lift your hands and sing it? He has forgive me. I see how he was from his [Music] [Applause] [Music] fore. I know that he Yes, he has for him. Oh my go [Music] [Applause] for me. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. To stand forgiven in his presence. Hallelujah. What a blessed What a blessed opportunity it is to stand in your presence, Lord. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your wonderful name, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; May you be high and lifted up, Father. &gt;&gt; Glory to your wonderful name, Lord. Lord, we know that you dwell in the praises of your people, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to stand here this evening, Lord, crying back to you, Father. The one who has redeemed us, the one who has brought us out. Lord, certainly we aren't sad. Certainly we aren't downcast in our position. For Lord, we are being brought back to that perfect Eden beauty once again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a blessed thought, Lord. What a blessed hope you have given us, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How we love you, Father. How we love your appearing, Lord. &gt;&gt; How we love your dealings, Lord Jesus. How that you would even come down this evening, speak to us, Lord, even lift to ear as you spoke to your prophets of old. Father, Lord, you have given us a pastor whom you said you would speak to, whom you said would be able to deliver the words of life to us once more. That you would dwell not just with us, Lord, but even in us to the end of the world. Hallelu Hallelujah. What a blessed savior we have. Blessed redeemer. All is at rest and the life seems full of turmoil. Sure, the boat that Peter was standing on and the other disciples was a great turmoil, but Peter said, "Lord, bid me to come." All the other disciples may be standing back a little bit. What is Peter thinking? Would you be one tonight? Lord, bid me to come. Bid me to step out of the boat, Lord. I think if we could each come to that place in our experience. Lord, I'm tired of standing back amongst the other 12 and just kind of blending in. Let me step out. &gt;&gt; Let me reach out and touch the hem of your garment this evening. Let me be the one that can touch you on behalf of the prayer requests that are being read tonight. With that in mind, we want to go to prayer this evening. We've got several requests to let you know about. I'm going to ask brother Ernie. Brother Ernie, if you'd come and lead us in prayer, take these requests before the throne of grace. We've got a request from Brother Roy, Sister Judy, and family. It's quite lengthy and I haven't read it, so I'm just going to try and read the the entire request to you. Please pray for my sister Joy Nelson and family. This morning, she received a call from Jamaica informing her that her husband Earl passed away suddenly. We don't know if the details We don't know of the details at present. He left for Jamaica a few days ago to inquire about his dad's sudden passing and to make necessary arrangements. The family planned to leave next week and go and was informed about the tragedy. Please pray that the Lord will give my sister strength, comfort, and peace and his protecting hands will lead her. May the Lord have his divine will and way. God bless. We want to remember that need tonight. Sister Lori has a request that we pray for a complete healing for Sister Leverne Clemens in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Claiming it and believing. Want to remember a request for Jean. She's been diagnosed with kidney cancer that has spread to her lungs. Sister Rachel Russell request that we pray for her mom. She is at home with a heart problem and the flu. Another request to pray for a man named Kenneth Carroll. He's battling cancer paralyzation. It's from Brother Mark. Amen. If you have a need on your heart tonight, maybe you didn't make it to write it down on a piece of paper, but the very one that knows the thoughts of our hearts, the intents of our hearts is here this evening. I believe if you raise your hand in faith believing tonight, he'll honor your request as we go to prayer. Brother Ernie, [Music] &gt;&gt; let's bow our heads. Father, we come together as a body tonight, Lord, a people that you have called into an eternal reality. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are transdimensional travelers. We live in this natural world, but Lord, we're most at home when we are in the presence of God. Knowing that there are supernatural beings all around us, oh God, and knowing that when the body of Christ comes together, each one with their lick of fire, Lord God, all things are possible, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, we we desire to come into that unity of the faith, Lord, where not a single not a single one of the enemy, Lord, would have any effect upon this body, Lord. They would run from the presence of God. Father, we have these grave requests that have been put before us, but Lord, we have the confidence that you have given your bride a peace that passes all understanding and a peace that comes in the midst of the storm. And Lord, not one of these needs that is here present took you by surprise, Lord. And Lord, you have given us a confidence that when we pray that you hear us. And Lord, that you answer every prayer. And Lord, we're lifting up brother Royy's family. Oh God. Lord, for the sudden departure of this family member over in Jamaica, God. Lord, I pray that as the family gathers, I pray that you would be in their midst. I pray the right words would be spoken. I pray Lord that it would bring them face to face with the reality Lord that that we are but transient beings here on this earth Lord. We're here today and gone tomorrow. And Lord, it can come just in a heartbeat. So Lord, we pray that you'd bless brother Roy and Sister Judy, Lord, that however they communicate with their family, oh God, that they would have the right words to say to ease their hearts, oh God. Lord, we pray for Sister Leverne tonight that you would give her a complete healing, oh God. Lord, such a faithful sister with always with a joy in her heart and always with a a radiant countenance, oh Father. Lord, we thank you for for for women of God like this, oh God. Women that know how to get in the prayer closet, Lord. And now, Lord, we want to get in our prayer closet, Lord, and want to lift her up. And Lord, for Sister Rachel's mom, we pray that you would minister to her. We pray that you would just move into that room where she is right now. No doubt, Father, she is knowing that the the saints will be praying for her. Let her receive it, Lord. Let her receive that channel of inspiration and revelation, Lord, that by your stripes, she is healed. &gt;&gt; And Lord, for this this man, uh, Kenneth Carol battling cancer and paralyzation. Oh, God, I pray that that you would just neutralize the spread of this disease. I pray that you would annihilate it, Lord. If the man is not a Christian, Lord, I pray that he would call out to God for salvation of his soul, oh God. And Lord, for the healing of his body, Lord, we lift them up. We believe that you can do all things. We've seen you do it so many times before, Father. [Music] And Father, for for Jean, who has been diagnosed with kidney cancer that has spread to her lungs. Lord, we don't know if this is a believer or an unbeliever. We don't know if it's one of the body of Christ. But Lord, a petition has come to us. And Lord, as your your body of Christ, Lord, with a spirit like Abraham had on him to do everything that he could to redeem the foolish virgin. And Lord, when he did all that he could, Melzdc met him and fed him bread and wine. So Lord, we have that same desire, oh God, to reach out to one and all. Lord, maybe they might not be the bride, but maybe something that is said or something that is put into their hands would give them faith, would give them understanding, would give them a knowledge when future events take place, oh God, that they would not step into the place where they would take the mark of the beast, but they would stand fast for the faith that has been imparted to them. Lord, she has sent her prayer request to the right place, Lord. And we know that you are ready, willing, and able, oh God, to hear and to answer every petition. And now, Lord, for for the man of God that would come and stand behind the sacred desk. We pray, Lord, that you would give him an anointing, a liberty, a freedom, oh God, to enter right into that that channel that you that you have placed his heart in. Let him deliver the word, Father, with a holy a holy anointing. and let we be ready to receive it, Lord, and to to act upon it and let the word become manifest in our life. We ask all these blessings in your precious name, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. As you have your seats, want to have the choir come and get ready. They've got a special force this evening. As they come, we want to just greet each and every one of you again. the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Those on the internet hook up with us to say God bless you to you as well. Perhaps we can sing uh number 427. He's alive and well. Amen. Is he alive and well in your heart tonight? Amen. Doesn't it give you a great joy to be in the sanctuary of his people? I wasn't able to be here on Sunday. We were down in Seattle following a wedding and the service is down there. So, we were streaming Sunday morning. We missed being here and to walk into the sanctuary this evening. It was very nice to be here and to see all of your faces. Let's just sing it together. He's alive and well, living in me to tell the world that he is the same. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus is alive and well. Let's sing it again. He's alive and well [Applause] to the world. And he is the same. He's the same yesterday, today. and forever. Jesus is alive and [Music] I've had this song on my heart probably since uh just after camp and we're finally getting to it. But um I was just thinking about Jesus walked into the temple and he took the scroll from Isaiah and he read his allotted portion and he said, "This day the scriptur is fulfilled in your ears." We're going to sing, I will restore, sayeth the Lord, a song we've done here before, but I was just thinking what God did for us and our young people at camp. And I'm just thankful that he said he would restore and and this is the time that he's fulfilling that in our lives and in our congregation. And one of the lines of the chorus says Jehovah promised the Holy Ghost promise. And that's for us as well in this season. So I just hope this song is an encouragement to the young people and to everybody here. Just enter in as we sing. And um I pray that it'll be a blessing. [Music] [Music] bright. [Music] Now, do you remember way back to your former rain where you Oh, you stood in position having dominion and all things under your feet. Oh, but you're f Yes, you did. You fell from that fellowship and you wonder, "Lord, where I went wrong." [Music] So you cry and you cry and you cry out. You thirst for that latter rain. And then you fight for the power again. You see the palmer worm came in your life. Then the candle worm came in your life. Then the caterpillar and the saint. But God promised. Yes, he promised. I will restore the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I will restore. &gt;&gt; You chase him and believe it. &gt;&gt; My God, &gt;&gt; it's a holy promise. &gt;&gt; I will restore. &gt;&gt; I will restore. [Music] I will restore the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now power shall come from on high after the Holy Ghost. It comes upon you and you shall be witnesses [Music] unto me throughout this world. Oh my glory all men shall behold for I shall come. Oh yes, I have. Unto you as the former rain, and as the latter rain, to you shall I come, and all men shall know that you have the evidence. Oh, that my Jesus, he rose from the dead. And in your own God will visit you there. For you are meant to be mighty. [Applause] It's the holy I'm going to keep my word. I cannot restore the Lord. I will restore myself. And in your own atmosphere meant to be a mighty churchy mighty pro. &gt;&gt; I will restore. I'm going to restore. I'm going to keep all the promise. The Holy Ghost promise. I will restore. [Music] And I will restore. Resto. I will restore. Say the Lord. &gt;&gt; I die. &gt;&gt; I will resto my promise. &gt;&gt; I believe it. I receive it. I will restore. Thus said the Lord. I will restore. Bless the Lord. I will restore the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that chorus once more as they're having their seats. I will restore [Applause] the Lord. I will restore [Music] the Lord. I will say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Takes the human element right out of it, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; He said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; Not, "I'll give you 50% and I'll take 50%." &gt;&gt; No, he said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're going to invite our brother Biscll to come. Our pastor Amen. How many would like our pastor to take his liberty tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel that just preach what's on his heart. Amen. We don't want to, you know, Well, I'll give the rest of it to you on Sunday. We just like both barrels. How would you like that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. I would too. Amen. As our pastor comes, let's sing together. I believe he's coming back like he said. 359. I believe he's coming back like he said. I believe the trumpet's going to sound so loud. It'll resurrect the dead. Oh my god. [Music] [Music] Oh my god. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Oh, heat, heat. Amen. God bless you. Nice to hear your singing. Nice to hear the worship, the prayer, brother Ernie. We appreciate that. And uh above all things now, the most important thing is the word. &gt;&gt; So much we could be saying. We uh happy to be kind of back in the house of God. How many enjoyed Sunday? &gt;&gt; Our brother brother Gido and the congregation uh gave a very gracious gift for the work for the work in Siberia to our brother Giddo. It was uh $6,137. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. I asked our brother Gido to inform us from time to time uh just what it was that we were able to share in. I always like to know what we're doing, you know, and I said, if you're able to bring, you know, some of these young children that have become young men, young women, bring them to a convention or uh whatever need they may have or some widow that uh needs food or whatever and and especially the the children in the orphanage. I thought it was really remarkable. Something that uh I too appreciate. It's it's been such a uh combined effort by quite a few people. Uh some of that offering actually was from uh sent over from men of vision because there's a cost to transfer money $25 $30 at a time. So rather than send over a small or smaller amount or when you get a check, you don't want to take that kind of funds off. So they just combined it with with ours. And uh but the the most of it I can say came from the church here. Uh and you know what's really wonderful is that there's no pull. You don't have to have any gimmicks. You don't have to play any games. You just say, you know, here it is. Here's the brother and he's presented. He hasn't even presented any need. He just said what is happening and do we want to be a part and then then you respond. It's always been that way and uh how I appreciate the congregation. Appreciate you. And I also want to thank you just while you're still standing for your prayers while we were in in China. I said a little bit about it last Sunday. Those of you that weren't here, I won't repeat everything. I will just say that uh spending some time with brother Murphy and knowing that brother Tony had been there to uh quite a number of the places and now brother Murphy is going to some of the other cities and I know that they're in close contact all together he and brother Tony and now don't get confused when I talk about the other brother Tony which is Murphy's brother in China and uh pray for them especially they they are at they are at a decision time right now and They accept this as as truth. They know it's correct. You have to remember they don't have a church to go to. They don't have any fellowship. They don't have she doesn't have another sister and he doesn't have another brother. They don't have any other believers right in the area. There's a man that's moved there. Uh perhaps you know brother Tony from Singh. He just moved to Beijing. It's the only other brother that we know of. But now this brings me to another important point and that is the congregation here and when you have ministry and you when you're singing and when you're worshiping you just cannot imagine what that means to people such as Tony and Elen and others as they're able to stream or ar the archive services and sit there and hear it and be part of a place where they did sit and you just uh you need to really be in their situation and to realize now that uh there's people all over that nation that are able um especially in China, you know, I know it's many other places, but I think it's so marvelous that the internet services are able to go and we have a bit of a project in mind and if you if God will lay it on your heart to pray about it. Uh I asked brother Murphy, what is really a need as you've gone around to these places and you're you are you know you're part of this culture, you understand it like no one else. What do you find is really needful? And he said they need some method of being taught uh of how the message what the message actually was sent for what you know because they just hear of a message coming but they cannot overlay it like we do in in the time and and this is the end time and all of these things and they really need to have something. So, and I began to discuss with him the, you know, I made a banner years ago and took the Old Testament, the New Testament, the seven church ages, and all of these things, and we talked about developing that. And and uh so we're we're praying about something and making a a disc available because then you can just take a ma ma a master disc over there and they can duplicate them over there with no problem. And that would be very very valuable to them. So, we're we're we need to pray about these things. I believe that God blesses a church and a congregation and a people. He blesses you, your families, and you that work and you that give. He He blesses us as a congregation when we identify and see these needs and say, you know, I'll do what I can because little is much when God is in it. Amen. So, it's not some great big glamorous thing, but little is much. Whatever it is, be it small or be it great, uh it it's all great in God's hand. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless our loaves and fishes. &gt;&gt; God bless you for standing. Turn to Timothy if you would. First Timothy and turn if you would please to chapter 6 the 12th verse. fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life where unto thou art called also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. Would you read together that verse with me? Fight the good fight of faith. They hold on eternal life where unto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. We'll bow our heads. Dear gracious heavenly father, we can say our father, you are our father. You have done and are doing and will continue to do so many many things innumerable. We cannot count them. We cannot even grasp, oh God, the greatness of your mercy, your longsuffering. Father, uh we are we are the recipients of such benefits that have come from you freely day after day. I pray you'll forgive us when we have failed to thank you for it. But tonight, we come and say, "Thank you, Lord, for all of these things that you've done and are doing. Thank you for salvation. Thank you for eternal life and the healing of the bodies. Oh God, thinking just now of Sister Marge Miller. Lord, how is she just continually on our hearts, her name on our lips, God? And father, we're we're praying that either you will receive her into your bosom or you'll return her back to our hearts, Lord. And will your will be done, oh God. Your will be done in the name of Jesus Christ. Glorify yourself, Lord. However you please to do it, but we leave her in your loving arms, oh God. And strengthen the family and encourage them, each one, oh God. And pray, Father, now you'll give us utterance. Lord, I pray you'll anoint my lips and my mind and you'll anoint the people, Father, and you'll give us such a blessed oneness, oh Lord, an atmosphere that you love to dwell in. &gt;&gt; We'll thank you in the name of Jesus Christ, our savior. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. While I was away, I couldn't shake this phrase off my mind. And I began studying it even while we were in China. Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life. Lay hold on eternal life. And I thought, you know, uh I was thinking of the overcoming and the circumstances that a person encounters in life. And it's important. It's not it's not beginning the race, friends. It's running to the end. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "They that endure to the end." And I've lived quite a long time and and served Christ and and seen thousands of believers. And as time has gone on, I've seen a lot of people start. Uh but I've seen a whole lot less keep running. And so it's not who starts, but it's who keeps on running. And I would sooner have somebody plot along than have a jack rabbit, you know, start out of the blocks and and play out in the first few hundred yards. I just sooner have the turtle that just keeps going on and on and on and on and and nothing changes. He just keeps going on. He's got a hard shell. Nothing really bothers him, you know. And if he stops, he just needs a little fire under him. &gt;&gt; Get him going again. I was thinking of of this scripture, fight the good fight of faith. And we don't usually associate the word good with the word fight. Paul uses it twice. And he calls it a good fight. And I I I I was interested in that. What kind of fight is a good fight? &gt;&gt; What kind of fight is it can you term as being really a good fight? And he he said, "I have I have fought a good fight." He said, "I have finished my course and I have kept the faith." I just want to see what he was saying about that. And the good that he's using here that it's an excellent fight. It is a surpassing. It's useful. It's a suitable fight. This is a commendable fight and it's an admirable fight. This isn't something you feel disgraced about when you're done. You know, if you lose your temper and you do something or you react in a certain way or you have some kind of fight, be it verbal or whatever more, you can't walk away from it and feel good about it. But this fight Paul's talking about, it's a good fight. &gt;&gt; And and you and you'll feel good about it. You'll feel good about every victory. And we don't often hear about a good fight, but this one's a good fight. &gt;&gt; It's an admirable fight. It's a very worthy fight. And this fight uh we can see with the word fight. I just I want to set the tenor of it. It is to strive or to labor fervently to enter a contest to contend. And Apostle Paul his whole, you can see his whole manner of writing, he had some fire &gt;&gt; in him, &gt;&gt; right? you see had some fire and he knew well something about uh uh you know competition running the race and some of this language actually has reference to what takes place in the arena in the great sports and the great uh competitions and it is to contend with adversaries this fight to contend to struggle to struggle with difficulties and dangers it's Not just persons we're talking about. We're talking about circumstances. We're talking about things that come upon us, enter our lives, all kinds of things, not necessarily bad. Sometimes good things take people. And we're going to talk about that a little later on. Fight the good fight. And then this word fight also comes from another root word which has mostly to do with a race or a place of assembly. We're right here in an assembly. a place of of gathering, especially an assembly that is meant to see games. And friends, while he's using a word and the Greeks understood it because the Olympics started with the Greeks and all the rest of it, but I can say the greatest the game of life is happening right here. &gt;&gt; This is the game of life. This is the real game that we're in. And it's not a play thing. It's a real one. the place of contest in this arena called the as far as I'm concerned this arena called the whole world the whole earth and this stadium that God has given us and where he decided he would put the bride on display &gt;&gt; it's any kind of struggle or contest and we can see that the nature and character of apostle Paul is very evident in his letters He's in a race. He's in a race to win. He's in a fight. And he's in a fight to overcome. And Paul is saying that he's giving us an example. That is to be and when you have something someone says, "This is an example. These are my footsteps. Follow in them." Then we then we want to press ourselves towards that example. an example of something that's it's a measuring stick as it were and we can keep measuring ourselves to that kind. If we start feeling uh laxidasical or wearied or wearied with the race or slowing down right away you need to measure yourself with Paul's example that was not the kind of example you know in brother Brandham's life I I always marvel at this because of course uh uh of my age now and I don't want to talk about that every service but uh here brother Brandham started talking when he was in his late 40s. I'm an old man now. I thought, my goodness, if I could just be that age, I'd be so happy. And then uh you know, he was about 52 and he said, uh I'm an old man and an old warrior and I fought many battles and many hard battles. And he talks on and on about that. And and uh it wasn't his age, it was the fact that he had fought hard. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He fought hard. He preached hard. He carried many burdens and resisted such resistance, such opposition, and yet was faithful to hue to the line and to bring the word and to leave us something that is a measuring stick so we can keep measuring ourselves by that message. I'm so thankful it wasn't compromised, that he laid it out there for us. Aren't you thankful? And so we have that even as a uh an example for us. And because this word to fight has to do with has to do not to follow but it actually infers to lead you know not to initiate a fight but to lead to to uh uh to be a leader. He Paul does not take the position of pour little water here boys, pour a little water there. He he takes the position of follow me. &gt;&gt; That kind of a fighter. It was in that that phrase actually comes from in the greatest battle ever fought in that message. Brother Brandham said at one time uh one time I was just he said little Jeffersonville fire department down here and uh uh I don't know it's Falls Place I guess it is P F A U S caught on fire and they called Jeffersonville which is small perhaps I don't know whether it's a volunteer fire department standing down there and the captain walking around saying spurt a little water here spurt a little water over here. Then the Clarkson, the Clarksville rather, uh, fire department came. Same thing. Spurt a little water here, spurt a little water there. He said, "And they call Louisville, the city, and here come trained men." He said, "Brother, as soon as that engine stopped, who was at the top of the ladder?" Says, "The captain." &gt;&gt; And when the ladder went up, he went up with it. Glory. &gt;&gt; He He was leading. &gt;&gt; See, he was ready to fight the fire. &gt;&gt; He was ready to lead and show the other boys the way, the other men the way. And he says, "And when he struck the window, he grabbed his axe and and threw it through the window and said, "Come on, boys." He said, "The fire was out in a few minutes." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, it's how you approach something. &gt;&gt; How you approach these things and how you look upon these things. And Apostle Paul could then say, "Be ye followers of me even as I am of Christ." Now, I just want you to follow real close. I'm going to take a real sharp turn here in a few minutes. And the power of transformation. Now, first messenger, now the last messenger says, "But my dear friends, I'm not long. I'm not young like you all this morning, but I'm old and I've been through many hard battles. And by going through those hard battles brings you where you are this morning. &gt;&gt; He said, you see, I'm sure you understand. And then I highlighted this. God has put me through it. That my life might open up a way to say this is it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That my life might open up a way so I can say this is it. This is the way. These are the footsteps. &gt;&gt; Not ashamed to say walk in them. &gt;&gt; Walk in those footsteps. This is the record. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He says this is it. And then he says, "And then and then you all run over the road. You all you run over the road." What road? The road the testimony that was left. You run over the road. But before me, he said, there were someone opened up the way for me. And and he says, "And we open up the road for one another." &gt;&gt; I think that was so beautifully put. But he's saying, you know, and and this was this was in ' 65. He he's going to be gone soon. He says, I I've I've fought a hard battle. I fought a hard fight. What kind of fight? You know what kind of fight it is? We we may talk about, you know, hard scars and all of those things, but what about the what about the man? And I talked to the man who actually saw the check. And this was when money was worth something. That rich man down in California that delivered that had that check delivered and had FBI men come to his door to identify him to make sure it got to the right person and $1.5 million because his wife had been healed from cancer. Brother Brandham described that whole event, that whole experience. He was standing at the door and they said, "Uh, we want to speak with William Brham." He said, "I'm William Brandham." They said, "Do you have you have proof of your identification?" He took out and showed them his identification. I believe it was his driver's license and so on. And and he says, "Has something happened? Is something wrong?" He said, "I thought maybe something had happened to Billy Paul. Has something happened? You know, something terrible happened?" And they said, "No, no, we just have to make sure that we know that we're talking to the right person." They said, "Do you know a Mr. Soandso?" And Brother Brandham said, "Yes, I remember him." He said, "His wife was healed from cancer in California in one of my meetings." They said, "That's exactly right." They said, "And he has sent you," and they had the papers there, sent you $1.5 million. Oh, he said, "I couldn't accept that." They said, "You don't have to. it's already given to you. He said, "But I wouldn't know what to do with it." He says, he says, "I'd go crazy trying to, you know, figure out what to do with a million half dollars." They said, "Well," he said, "I couldn't accept that." He said, "Well, you don't have to. It's already in an account in the bank here. All you have to do is go there and and identify yourself. It's already been transferred to you to your bank." He said, he said, "You take it back. you take it all back and tell the man that I thank him very very much but he said I just couldn't accept that I say he won a great victory &gt;&gt; he won a great victory right there so it's not just you know hard grinding circumstantial things that it can come in so many ways but I believe that he won a great victory at that moment and Paul often uses the terms that indicates that he was well familiar with commitment and a physical cost of the of of the of the uh contest. He said, "Know ye not that they which run in a race, they run all, but one receiveth the prize. So run." He wasn't saying it to you if he wasn't doing it himself. This was a full-time job. Run that ye may obtain. In Philippians uh 3:14, I pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. and uh numbers. Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome it." Now, that is the spirit of the Bible. &gt;&gt; And that always has been the spirit of the scriptures, and that's still the spirit of the scriptures. We're able. &gt;&gt; And anyone that says anything different than that isn't speaking the language of the Bible. We're able. You are able. You need to say, "I am able." I don't care what the conditions are. I don't care what the circumstances are. I am able to overcome. &gt;&gt; Be it good, be it bad, be it something else. Uh be it physical, be it be it whatever, I'm able &gt;&gt; cuz God wants me to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we don't have a great uh abundance of written record of the life of Jesus Christ in his early youth and through uh his years from his birth to 30 years old. There's not very much written about him, but brother Brandham says that Joseph was a perfect type of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I want to take some things from the life of Joseph and perhaps even just tonight lay a foundation. The Lord willing, if the Lord wills, I will carry on on Sunday. But if you'd like to take your Bibles, please, and turn to Genesis 37, because I will be making reference, we're not going to read large portions, but I will be making reference to uh a number of scriptures as we go through. And and the prophet speaks of Joseph in this way in the message Israel and Egypt. He said, "Now watch. Election, election in Abraham, justification in Isaac, grace in Jacob, and perfection in Joseph." He said, "There's not one thing recorded against Joseph." There's not one thing recorded against Joseph. He said, "That's the perfection. The Bible tells us just in the second verse here we can say even read read verse one. And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan. And these are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren. And the lad was with the sons of Bila, and with the sons of Zilpa, his father's wives. And Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. So we have now Joseph being 17. And I thought soon as I read that, I thought of so many of the young men and the young ladies and things that God has been doing. And this should have a special meaning for you because now we don't we don't have we can't go back and say now Jesus being 17 and starting to detail his life and and and so on and what he went through we have no idea. But Joseph being 17 and he starts now to detail his life and it is a a remarkable remarkable life. remember not one thing against him, a perfect type of Jesus Christ. He knew nothing about that. He was reflecting a shadow of the life of Jesus Christ. And we must not lose sight that we are here living an expression of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He without the Holy Spirit and we have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He had nothing to look back to. He didn't have books to study. He didn't have preachers to preach to him. He didn't have everything that we have to to encourage us and to strengthen us and to fellowship along the way. And perhaps also I could say he didn't have many of the things that you and I have to struggle with. But he had plenty of things to struggle with. And I believe that the principles which applied for him still apply today. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart that the same principles apply. Brother Brandham said about Joseph, I was taking the life of Joseph. Now just if this if this meant something to brother Brandham, I wonder if it can't mean something to you and I. And he said, I was just reading his life and you know Abraham was election and Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac and which was justification and Isaac begat Jacob which was grace and he said but Jacob begat Joseph which was perfection not one thing against him. And he said, "I seen his life." And he thought about his life. And he thanked God that there was such a life as Joseph's that was recorded in the scripture. And he said he went into his closet and he just closed the door and he began to weep thanking God for Joseph's life. I would say here on a Wednesday evening, if that can so uh be absorbed and taken in and the Holy Spirit move upon a prophet messenger over a man's life in the scripture, we who have received the message, we ought to be able to say tonight that same life, let it impact me. &gt;&gt; Let me absorb. Let me let it penetrate my being. Let it not just be some words and a story and an account, but let me be gripped by it also. And I want to say that Paul said, "Fight the good fight of faith." I'm saying to you this evening, I'm taking Joseph's life and saying he fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; He fought a good fight. And he had to fight all the way, but he fought a very good fight. &gt;&gt; He fight He fought an admirable fight. a very useful fight because here we are all these thousands of years down the road and we are being benefited and I say thank God for Joseph &gt;&gt; and the life that he lived &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says of Joseph, says Joseph was spiritual. You know friends, it's not easy being spiritual. Because to be spiritual, you're misunderstood. to be spiritual. Not only misunderstood, but people identify you as maybe trying to be something above, oh, you know, you're too good, you're too holy if you're spiritual. Now, spiritual isn't something that you put on. Spiritual is something that you possess as a gift from God. I want you to take this very, very closely. spiritual. It is to be higher than man but inferior to God. We're less than God is in that in that sense, but we're higher than the average person, higher than man's interest. We're not interested in in man's world, man's accomplishment, man's interest. Because being spiritual, you you have a different kind of an appetite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says of him, of Joseph, look at Joseph, the perfect one. He said we could spend weeks on him. Look, hated of his brothers, loved of his father, he was a spiritual man, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's why being spiritual and he couldn't help that. He goes on to say uh of Joseph, he said, "When I read that," and here's here's what I was describing just earlier, and I'll put it in in Brother Brandham's own words. He said, "When I read that about Joseph being a perfect type of Christ," he said, "when I read that, I just got to crying one day in my little old hotel room and I went over to the closet where I had my clothes hanging and pulled the door together and I said, "God, I want to thank you for a man like Joseph who once lived on the earth, a man in flesh like I am a man that could believe you and take your word. &gt;&gt; You know sometime in prayer quite often especially if I find myself in a difficult time I go back and and and pick out someone in the scripture say he was just like me. He had to live just like me. He had to endure you know circumstances. He had to eat food. He had to grow. He had to work or whatever. He had responsibilities. Maybe he had a family, had children or had friends or colleagues or associates or whatever more. It was like me. All it is is a little span of time between him and me. But his God, the God that he sought to serve is the same God I'm serving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if God honored him, Brother Brandham says, just look back and see if God honored something back there. He honored faith. He honored a certain character. Honored a certain prayer. He'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says uh he said he was hated of his brethren. And I want you to catch this. He couldn't help being spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be dwelling on that now for a little bit. He couldn't help being spiritual. I want to make a very very uh quick statement and make it clear. Spiritual is not something you learn. &gt;&gt; Spiritual is not something you put on. Spiritual is not something you acquire. &gt;&gt; Spiritual is something that is actually divinely given you by God and you can't help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact is you have nothing to do with it. It's something that God has put in a person. A spiritual person has a a a different outlook. They have different desires. They have different uh uh they approach things differently, but they can't help it. They just can't help it. Now, it's not it's not a kink in a person's nature. Said, "Well, that's just the way I am. That's not I'm not talking about that. That's not spiritual to me." spiritual. Uh you'll have a whole lot better grasp of it as we go on, but he said he couldn't help being spiritual. He saw visions. Now, maybe you've never seen a vision, but he also dreamed dreams. You perhaps could dream a dream. When you dream a dream, please tell me how you're going to help that. &gt;&gt; You have a good dream, you have a bad dream. Whatever the dream is, can you change it? Can you do anything about it? you're helpless &gt;&gt; because it's in another dimension. It's in another realm. And that's the kind of phrase I apply. You can't help that. &gt;&gt; That's where spiritual, the spiritual that I'm referring to. That's where that happens. Spiritual is not having a certain kind of an atmosphere here in the church or certain kind of atmosphere in your home. We can say, well, that's a, you know, spiritual home. But that's not the spiritual I'm talking about. I'm talking about the spiritual that you have. No, you have no hand in it whatsoever. It's something that God does. &gt;&gt; I want that to be superimposed in your mind for this service tonight. God does it. God puts a certain gift, a certain talent, and you can't help it. &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of it. No matter what you would do to try to get rid of it, you can't get rid of it because it's there. It's you. &gt;&gt; It's something that God has given. So the spiritual part that I'm speaking of, it has nothing to do with a person's conviction or the way they think or anything along that line, whether something is right or whether it's wrong. That's not the spiritual part that I'm talking. I'm I'm not talking about uh a person saying, "Well, that's just me. it, you know, even though it might be a good uh characteristic, I'm not talking about good characteristics as opposed to uh characteristics that aren't that good. Now, in in and let me just lay this down now in God testifying of his gifts in that message, brother Brandham speaks. He says, "Now to see visions," he said, "I couldn't help that." See, don't don't let that go over your head just because you say, "Well, we've never seen visions. How does that apply?" Just just hold it in your mind, please. He said, "No one nobody never laid hands on me and said, now you have the gift of visions." He said, "It wasn't that I merited it. God ordained it to be so. And then I find that is so." Then I come out here in the name of the Lord after he had commissioned me to do so to try to help you to believe God. How many understands that now? He didn't have anything to do with it. God dropped that thing uh that upon him and it was divine. That was spiritual. And then he comes out and operates and functions in that uh in that uh I will say in that office of a prophet. And God was doing that to help you as believers to believe. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Putting a man in a place where he had no control. Now he said, "Now here's a man." This was in we would see Jesus in Grass Valley. In fact, as I I know the pastor that was probably here at this time, Brother Watson was his name in Grass Valley, California. He said, "Here's a man, a total stranger. Don't know him. Never seen him in my life. He might be eat up with cancer. He might have domestic troubles, financial. I don't know what's wrong with him. He's standing here just a man." Now, imagine what's a man what's going through his heart. He's a man like you men and women are stood before him like you women. And he said uh and now if the Holy Spirit will reveal to me and he said that little lady now he turns from the man he says that little lady sitting right back over here towards where I'm pointing my finger suffering with that eczema. He said if you'll believe with all your heart you believe it lady with all your heart. little gay-headed woman with glasses on got she she suffers from eczema. She was standing there and sitting there rather thinking about what was wrong with her praying in her heart. And now if that's right and you believe that God will make you well stand up on your feet. What did she touch? I ask you what did she touch? She's 20 yards from me. She touched the high priest and the high priest is here. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Don't you see? Don't doubt it. Believe it. Have faith. And now he turns to the man. He says, "Now, I couldn't help that. &gt;&gt; That was spiritual. I couldn't help that." There was nothing he could do to change that circumstance. talking to a man and then turns and talks to a woman and speaks to her and tells her exactly now God did that. That light moved from him to her and he couldn't help it. He had to follow that. He couldn't even help what he was saying. He had to say what he said and then come back and tell the man, "I couldn't help that. He said, "It's just I watch a light and it just went from me and I seen it hanging over there and I seen the little lady come up before me and she kept coming before me here and see it was a woman instead of a man. They had a man in front of him and I couldn't help that. I just had to speak what I was saying in the messages in the message images of Christ. I want to establish just two or three because I'm coming down to where we live in just a moment. Here's a woman sitting here praying. She's a warrior. Now, now I'm reading these, but I want to I want you to think real real deep. In the realm of the divine, there is no time. &gt;&gt; What I read now is just as real and just as effective at this moment as it was 50 years ago, 20 years ago, or 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; That's why we can read the Psalms and they're eternal. &gt;&gt; We can read the word of God and it's eternal because God's eternal. We read the prayers of the saints and it's eternal. We can read a prayer of of a of a believer and and there's that is not time locked. &gt;&gt; It's eternal &gt;&gt; because it's it's it's in God. &gt;&gt; And and and so now he's saying here's a woman sitting here praying. She's a warrior. I know her, but I can't help cuz the lights hanging over her. He knew her. So often he would say, "We're strangers. We're strangers. We're strangers. We don't know each other. We've never met each other. But now it's it's the opposite. He He knows this woman. And now he's saying, "But I can't help it." &gt;&gt; It isn't that I can't help knowing her. He couldn't help what was happening, &gt;&gt; even though he didn't know her. Now, now this is spiritual. Joseph was spiritual. He saw dreams. He had visions. He couldn't help it. And he was hated because of it. And it's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. Here here the prophet they loved the prophet for you know for the the supernatural and the miraculous and at the same time it was a bittersweet experience because they also hated him for being spiritual &gt;&gt; exactly as it was with Joseph. He was disliked because this gift separated him from all others. This wasn't something like some of the other great evangelist. There was nothing like it. It is like it was with Jesus when he was here. It wasn't as though there was eight or 10 people that were kind of similar. No, &gt;&gt; he was in a world by himself. &gt;&gt; He was in completely in a world by himself. And when the messenger comes and he has to reveal that same one, that's why it was it was on another planet. It was in another dimension. There wasn't anything even like it. and people coming around saying, you know, somebody over here or somebody up there has got a backachche and somebody over here has got a some trouble with their knee. That that that I wouldn't say anything uh derogatory about it, but that has nothing to do with what we're talking about. has nothing to do with the message we're talking about or what God did to this messenger because this was sent to reveal and make known the works of Jesus Christ once again before the people so that you could have such a unshakable assurance and con be so thoroughly convinced [Music] &gt;&gt; he says I I I can't help that because he knows her and he said that's Miss Bruce Bruce. Now he says, "Now, Miss Bruce, I don't know a thing about what's wrong with you. You were healed of cancer one time, but that but that uh but right there at that door, the first time I ever saw told you you were standing in that door and the Holy Spirit told me something that nobody knew besides you and the doctor." That's right, isn't it? And do you believe he can tell me what's wrong now? I know you, but I don't know what's your trouble. I have no idea because you're healed of the cancer, but I can't help that light hanging over you. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. &gt;&gt; Now, this is something that is beyond us. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. &gt;&gt; That light didn't disappear with the prophet's body. &gt;&gt; That light didn't go back into the heavens. That light has stayed with the word. And I can't help that. &gt;&gt; And out from that light, out from that glorious light has come the word. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour has been spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it came by your way and I can't help that. And you can't help that. &gt;&gt; It came by your way and that was a divine act of almighty God. And you can't help that. And then there was something within you that said, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; And you couldn't help that. &gt;&gt; Even though your mind said, "Ah, I got all kinds of questions. I got all kinds of reasonings. I I I could question that. I could think about that. I could reason this. And I got friends and I got family and and they say I'm crazy or something. I shouldn't even be looking at that." But something was inside. And something was inside pulling you that was spiritual. and you couldn't help it. &gt;&gt; I looked down into your faces and the testimonies just uh raced through my mind. And when even when I spoke to some of you and and the first message time the first time the message came to you, I thought there's no way. There's no way this person's going to believe that. Sister Bobby, that's what I thought about you. Sorry. I said no way this woman's going to believe this. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I say, glory to God. That's spiritual. And you had that in you. You had that in you. That was something that come from God. Nobody could lay hands on you and give it to you. It wasn't a gift. It wasn't trained into you. It wasn't preached into you. It wasn't prayed into you. You possessed it &gt;&gt; from God and you couldn't help it. And I'm so glad tonight I can say that to you. You couldn't help it. &gt;&gt; You had no power over it. You maybe even tried to suppress it. You tried to lay it aside. I'll forget this. &gt;&gt; You couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; You just couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could end the service right here. I feel I've that that's really where I was coming to, but I'm not going to stop. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't help saying it. &gt;&gt; There were things he didn't want to say. &gt;&gt; He said he began to talk about families and marital problems. He said, "It kills me to say this. I've got family here." But he had to say it anyway. And I'm glad he said it. Hallelujah. And when we heard it, there was something inside divinely given by almighty God said, I believe that. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; How is it? One person reads a book and this person reads the next book and one thing says this is garbage. Next person says this is priceless. &gt;&gt; This is marvelous. &gt;&gt; One says that's total confusion. And for the other person says it just settled all the confusion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that? It's because one is spiritual and the other one is not spiritual. Hallelujah. Spiritual is something that come from God. You can get it no other way. And you can't help it. Oh, I love that phrase. You can't help it. You possess it. You have it. And there isn't anything you did to get it. You weren't trained into it. God gave it to you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand saw visions. Joseph dreamed dreams. But you had a light that went on inside. You heard a word and a light illuminated you inside and you couldn't help it. They couldn't help seeing it. He couldn't help speaking it. And you couldn't help believing it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Tell you what, I could do a dance. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; In fellowship. He said, "What's the matter with me?" Here's brother Brandham. Now, you going to listen to this? What's the matter with me? I asked my wife the other day. He says, "Am I a mad man?" Can you imagine? Maybe you never run across that before. Brother Bram saying to his wife, "What's the matter? Am I a madman?" He said, "I can't help saying those things." &gt;&gt; Now, you can see the kind of warfare, the kind of warfare, but he overcame. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't succumb &gt;&gt; to this his own thoughts. Oh, you think he wanted to be thought of people like that? His own his whole character. He said, "I love people." He didn't want them to think bad of him. And here the thing that was sputtering out of his mouth, people's going to think he's a mad man to the point say, "Am I a mad man? Something wrong with me? &gt;&gt; People will call you, you're crazy. &gt;&gt; You've gone off the deep end. &gt;&gt; You're nuts. You are insane. &gt;&gt; That's wild. That's weird. And all the other phrases and all you can say, I'm sorry. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's something from within. I can't help it. Can you help it? &gt;&gt; No, I can't help it. We can't help it. &gt;&gt; Why did you believe? You may not even know why you believed &gt;&gt; but you can say I can't help but believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said and right after this in the same he said this afternoon when he said I'm a am I a mad man? He said I can't help saying it. He said there's an impulse within me that drives it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can't help that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't help the impulse that's within you that caused you when when the word came by your way. You can't help the impulse. Something within you laying out. I talked to one brother. He's on the other side right now. And he had been in the Catholic church. He'd given his life. He ever even went down to do mission work down in Borneo. was on a ship on a Catholic uh uh ship to help the people and he was just giving himself he was trying to get away from alcoholism and he was just giving himself brother Amy how he fought and how he struggled. And then one day the message was just introduced to him, just brought to him very very casually I guess and you know about the message and so on and so forth. And and uh he said he said I could have he said I could have punched a thousand holes through it. He said there just all kinds of things theologically that he could have just found all kinds of fault with it. But he said there just something in him said it's the truth. Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the impulse. &gt;&gt; That's the spiritual part. That's something he never learned. That's something he wasn't educated into. That had nothing to do with the church. Nothing to do with this church or any other church. It's an impulse inside. That is that came from God as much as the vision came from God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; That come from God. and he gave his life to Christ in light of this word and called his mom over on Vancouver Island and told her that he had received Christ now and he had he you know and and and he says I'm free from alcohol and she says no says call me in 6 months and he come to me and he almost didn't overcome he'd been just on top you know oh this new life and how marvelous it was and Oh, he was just walking on cloud nine and he wanted to tell everybody and so he went and told his mom. Joseph had to go and tell his father, "I saw a dream. &gt;&gt; I saw a dream about the mo about the moon and the stars and 11 the moon and the sun and 11 stars and they were all bowing to me." His father rebuked him. But the Bible says his father also observed the saying. His father went away and said, 'You know, I wonder what that means. Amy, he's on cloud nine, calls his mom. He says, I'm I'm free from alcohol. I gave my life to Christ. Ah, call me in 6 months. And he come back to me and his chin is dragging on the ground and she doesn't believe me. He said, you know, she couldn't share his joy at all. In fact, she was angry. And now he's finding something outside of the Catholic church. So he says, "What do I do?" I said, "Call her in 6 months." So he says, "Okay." So he he went away and and then he came back to me 6 months later and he says, "It's now 6 months." I said, "Give her another call." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he called her up. "Hi, mom." He said, "It's 6 months and it's still I'm still free." She says, "Ah." She didn't want to have any do. He came back. He was discouraged. He says, "I call her and I waited six months. Now what do I do?" He said, "Wait a year. Call her after a year." Okay. Said, "Hallelujah. I tell you what, we were able to put him in a in a his body in the ground. His soul went into into the very presence of Jesus Christ many, many years later. And that impulse that was within that was spiritual. That's something that come from God. Didn't come from the Catholic Church. Didn't come from this church, but it come from Christ. Come from God. It was there. and his mind could punch a thousand holes in it, but his soul believed it because there was something spiritual there. &gt;&gt; Couldn't help it, friends. &gt;&gt; Couldn't help it. And he said he was in this motel. Oh my goodness. Uh he said, "I was in this mo motel and I'm staying where I'm staying." And there was a bunch of people coming in drunk and women and grandmothers wearing shorts and dressed immorally and drinking and smoking. And I thought, God, why should I speak to my sisters in the way that I do and not wanting to say those things, but why should I do that? And look at here, still struggling at why should I say that? And he said just as sweetly, not an audible voice, but something inside me said, "I don't want my children looking like that." And there you are. He said, "You're different people." When I see when I heard it in my heart, he said, "I don't want my children." He said, "That me good, my children." He said, "I love the church, and that's what Christ died for. Now the woman at the well, you know how many times that brother Brandham uses that? Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. When that woman saw that gift, that her own need revealed. Nobody had to teach her. She didn't go through any course to find out this was a prophet. She didn't go through any course. And I was listening to a tape yesterday and I was really affected by it and I I don't remember hearing brother Brandham take such pains to lay out the ministry in this end time his ministry the ministry that you have been birthed under. And he went to such pains he went all through the scripture and it was so quiet. It was so quiet and you could see the people. This is in 1964 and you see the people really struggling with it. He just laying out that son of man, the revealing of the son of man, the Elohim in flesh coming to Abraham and turning his back. And I could see he was setting the stage. Oh God, what comes at the end of this one is going to be something dramatic. And uh he he begins to call the people. He called just 10 of them up. And as he's speaking to these people, then you could say, "Oh, they all were rejoicing. Oh, you could hear the whole building all rejoicing. You know, you got stomach trouble, just keep on going and believing. and you got something wrong with you. You keep on going believing and the people are all enthused and says you still smoke cigarettes and that's why you got that stomach trouble that nicotine draining down into your stomach. He says that's why you got that stomach trouble. He said I renounce those cigarettes in the name of Jesus Christ. Just keep walking. and oh the people I thought you know when here he spent a whole sermon to lay out out of the scriptures the prophet's ministry in the end time and they don't believe it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and then he began to demonstrate and reveal the secret of their heart and oh then they all go rejoicing over that but I thought of the woman at the well and when her heart was revealed &gt;&gt; Amen That's when she said, "You're a prophet." &gt;&gt; I thought how different that woman was from all those Pentecostal ministers here. They were missing it completely. And she caught it. &gt;&gt; A Samaritan woman at that same sign. And then she said, "I know when the Messiah comes. He'll tell us all things." And a few moments later, he said, "I that speak to thee am he." Nobody taught her to drop her water bucket and run into the city. She didn't learn that in Sunday school. She had something spiritual within her said the Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something spiritual. It wasn't she had to see something or have some dramatic thing happened. In fact is they got all excited and there was a great rejoicing and so on when they saw it demonstrated in the prophet's ministry. But when G when when Jesus demonstrated to that Samaritan, she felt silent. You've had five husbands. The one you have now is not your husband. Says, "Sir, you're a prophet." The Samaritans say we should worship here and we should worship there. The Jews say we should worship there. There's a man sitting here in the congregation and because of circumstances in his life, he wasn't able to keep work. Very, very difficult circumstances. And God found him in his pit of despair and he heard the prophet's message. And when he first came to the little log church, he was didn't feel worthy. He'd come in when no one was there and get some tapes and go out. And one day he came home and he was very discouraged. He was married then and I believe had a child and he'd just been I think released from another job. I don't know all the details. He came in and the sofa was sitting there and he sat in a chair and before when he came in he doesn't know why but he went into a closet and he put on a white shirt in the closet and came back out and sat in the chair. A tape was on but he doesn't know what tape it was. it just somewhere in the tape and he just pushed it on. And after that he said to me sometime later, Brother Brandham spoke to me through a tape because this brother who's sitting here looking at me now said, "I must not have the Holy Ghost if I can't provide for my wife." And I need a job. Brother David, I know you don't want to do this, but I want you to come up here. Would you do that for me? God's timeless. &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear it. The Holy Ghost for a job, too. You believe that God will give you the Holy Ghost and give you the job? Now, reach your hand up right here. Sitting there with the white shirt on. All right. I never seen anyone in my life. That's exactly what he was thinking. If that's right, wave your hand like this. Now, don't you see the word of God discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is named yesterday. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And right after that, &gt;&gt; how many years ago, Brother David? &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; 21 years ago. Right after that, he got a good job working for Finning Tractor, and that's where he still is today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Brother David, you want to tell us what that was like when you stepped in there? I I related it, but I couldn't tell like you did. How were you feeling when you came out to speak right up to this microphone? &gt;&gt; Um, I think I just sat down and uh, yeah, Brother Edward's right. We were kind of in despair. Hadn't we hadn't been able to pay the rent for about four or five months. Luckily, we had somebody who was patient and uh yeah, so I I just sat in the chair, punched on a tape, been out all morning, got up every morning, went out looking for something to do, and uh Brother Bam started talking and uh you know, it was like he was just talking right to me. I looked at Violet and and she looked at me and both of our eyes were kind of, you know, we just so we just sat there. But here's the part that that uh is really hard to understand and and and cannot really be explained, I think. Then that happened and I thought, "Wow, Brother Brandon was talking to me. I know it." and and uh but something happened about two weeks later that I've never been able to to explain and and I punched on a tape again, but this time I was in a much deeper uh you know listening and I I put on the tape and it was like uh Brother Bam just you know kind of covered me over and he prayed for me. And then after he prayed for me, uh, like brother Ed said, I, you know, things have gotten a lot better. The Lord is really good. &gt;&gt; Everything changed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everything changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. That is spiritual &gt;&gt; and that he couldn't help. He couldn't help it. He couldn't help walking in putting on a white shirt. &gt;&gt; Couldn't help it. Couldn't help sitting in a chair instead of the sofa. He had to be sitting in the chair. Yeah. You sitting there in the chair, the white shirt. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't help but believe it. &gt;&gt; And because of that, he couldn't help but get the job that he has. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the devil tried to take him, tried to take this testimony away. tried to lay him in a casket too early for life and God raised him up again. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. How often should we thank God for it? We should never forget it. &gt;&gt; It never gets old. It's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And when he was laying in that hospital in Langley and had to look to see if the quilts or the blankets were moving to see if he was still alive, uh he'd walked on it was a Wednesday just like this. And we got a call and he walked into he walked into the clinic, the doctor's clinic, and he said to Sister Violet, "Take him up to the emergency immediately." And I won't go much further. I went in after the Wednesday service, walked in, said he's in ICU, and I see you. I walked into ICU and looked like he was in a casket and tubes in his throat and and a nurse sitting there taking watching the monitors and Sister Violet. I said, "What happened?" He said, "I don't know. What did the doctor say?" He says, "Haven't said anything." I went out of there so heavy-hearted and she said the doctors are calling a meeting in the morning and he was up for an operation for berscitis in his shoulder cuz he's a spray painter and he was in such pain and he gotten very discouraged and I saw him right in the hallway. I can point right to it just outside behind the camera there. I I saw him go by and I wanted to say something to him. I needed to start the meeting. I can see he was very very downcast, very very discouraged. And I wanted to say something to him before I got back to him. He was laying in the hospital right near death. And in the morning, sister I couldn't be there. I said to brother Tom, can you please be there to this meeting and brother Tom is there and sister Violet says to the doctor, "Is this going to delay his operation which is coming up?" He says, "Mrs. laws. The only positive thing I can say is that your husband lived through the night. Those were the words and I can't tell you where it was and I'll remember it on into eternity. And God said these words to me. Tell David laws. He shall stand in the company of the saints and give glory to God. &gt;&gt; He was as unconscious as he could be. He was unconscious there in the hospital. He was unconscious all night and the next day. And I went there. His mother and father gathered there with Sister Violet, not knowing when he'd take his last breath. I walked into the hospital and Violet came out and I was talking with the parents and when she came out I went in and they had a had that chrome railing halfway down the bed and I stepped up beside him and the nurse was right on sitting on a stool and she was watching the monitor and making some notes and I said how is he said we're just taking a day at a time and I walked looked around behind her and put my hand on the railing and David opened his eyes. A little faint smile. Hi, brother Ed. I said, how are you, brother David? He said, I guess the devil came in for the knockout punch. I said, but he couldn't knock you out, could he, David? He smiled again. Said, no, I guess he couldn't. He said, "I've been wanting to talk to you, Brother Ed." He said, "I've I've really been I've been having going through a hard time." I said, "I know, Brother David. I saw you in the foyer of the church, and I saw you were so discouraged." But I said, "That isn't really why I'm here right now. I don't want to wear you out." Well, he said, "I really been wanting to talk to you, and I I said, we'll do that sometime, but I said, God sent me here, and I have a message for you. you shall stand in the company of the saints and give glory to God. &gt;&gt; And all I can say is he went from there to St. Paul's and back again. They couldn't do anything. And and many of you know the account. It's a marvelous account. No one has survived with the disease that he had unless they lost limbs or whatever more. And the disease that he had was eating up five of his major organs in his body, including his lungs and his heart. And God, God, God, supernatural God. This is his work. And he couldn't help it. And I couldn't help it. And we did nothing for it. God did it. And I say to God be the glory. Great things he hath done. So loved he the world that he gave us his son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we have. That's our father. Hallelujah. And he's the same tonight as he is yesterday or 2,000 years ago or when brother David was there. And he can speak to you. And I trust he's spoken to you in this service this night, this evening. That's why we're here. There's the same God. Hallelujah. that spoke to the woman at the well. Oh, he's the same God. I so thank him. And I want you to go home tonight with a little phrase on your lips. I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. I couldn't help believing it. I just couldn't help I can't help believing this message. I can't help being committed. We can't help being a spiritual people. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; My dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is in your glorious and matchless name that I come and the people are here to give glory to you. We say you are the same yesterday, today and forever. And oh God, our father, you so love the world that you have done these glorious things. And when we give testimonies, our brother David has again this evening. Lord, your name is praised and we give you the praise. No man shall take any credit. We could do nothing. This is a spiritual work. Something divine that you send down on the wings of a snow white dove. We give you praise. We give you glory. Hallelujah. We exalt you. We say continue your mighty work, Lord. Continue these glorious things. And may the people as they hear the word, hear the messages, may they in the same simplicity our brother David and sister Violet have done. You have so blessed them, oh God. And you've blessed them immensely with their sons now, Lord, serving you. May they come to know the God of their father and mother, Lord, in that supernatural way. I ask, Father, that you'll be gracious to us. We need to see more. We desire more. We hunger after righteousness, oh God, do so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. We give you praise and glory. We thank you. To God be the glory. Let us just sing it together. To God be the glory. Great things he hath done. Don't be the world that he gave us his son who yielded his life blood atonement for sin and opened the life gate that all may go in. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the earth hear his voice. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people rejoice. Oh, come to the father through Jesus the son and give him the glory. Great things he has done. Great perfect redemption.

Glor to the father to Jesus the son and give him the glory he had done and give him the glory he has and give him the glory great things he had done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Wonder, brother Tony, if you'd come and dismiss us in prayer. Thank you for your patience this evening. And the Lord willing, we'll continue on on Sunday. Would that be all right? I want you to think about these things. When you come into the door Sunday morning, just say, "I couldn't help it. Here I am again." just can't help it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll be praying for you, Brother John. Brother John is going to be speaking into a combined uh meeting in Ginthal, Saskatchewan. A number of churches are coming together. They're going to have Friday, Saturday, and two on Sunday. We're praying for you, Brother John. God bless you, Brother Tony. Would you please? Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, how we so enjoyed the word tonight, reminding us of who we are, Lord, and where we have come from, another dimension, another world, Lord, dropping down into time to express your word, Father. Lord Jesus, how naturally supernatural we are. And Father, as we would go from this place, Lord, may these words burn deeply in our hearts. Lord, when the natural flesh man would war with the spirit within, Lord, may you give us the strength of your spirit to Lord crucify our flesh daily to put that man back into the grave and Lord Jesus to put that spiritual Lord nature and life into into a visible form into a a demonstration Lord over this carnal man over this natural world. Oh God, though creation is groaning for the manifestation of this supernatural race of which who we are. Oh God, may you anoint our faith. And may we go out of here, Lord, with victory in our hearts and in our minds, realizing we can't help be what we are. Lord, we want to yield to you and we want to surrender our lives. Lord Jesus, may you strengthen the man of God, strengthen Brother Ed, Lord, increase his understanding, open up the word to him that as we would come back again at the appointed time that Lord Jesus, we could feast on these things and be strengthened again. Be with brother John, Lord Jesus, anoint him, be with him in the services in Saskatchewan. And Lord, for the weekend of meetings down in Seattle, Lord, we pray for them as well and the believers. And Lord, for each and everyone that's here and by way of extended audience, bless us all. And may we take this word and anointing with us now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God.
