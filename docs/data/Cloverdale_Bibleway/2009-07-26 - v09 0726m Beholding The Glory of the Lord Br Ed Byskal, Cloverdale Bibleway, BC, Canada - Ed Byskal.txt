Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's, Brother John, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer this morning. Amen. Heavenly Father, we come into your house this morning, this house of praise and worship. We lift up our hands, God. We lift up our hearts. We lift up our lives. We invite your Holy Spirit to come and take control of this service, Lord. May your anointing break every yoke. May every sin and unbelief, every shackle, every carnal reasoning, every thought of even ourselves or any life, may it be brought under your control. Oh Lord, let the king of heaven and his queen meet today in a divine encounter. May you break down the strongholds of the enemy as we cry out your name, Jesus. Lord, heavenly father, would you come in your word, come in your presence, come in your power, Lord, we need you. We confess our need. We humble ourselves to one another and to you. We repent of our sins. We repent of our unbelief. We repent of anything that would hinder. Help us not to grieve your Holy Spirit. Send angels, oh God. Send your Holy Spirit to this meeting, Jesus. We cry out to you, Lord. We invite you, Jesus. Help us to get into a channel where all things are possible. Lord, where nothing would hinder you. You are the supreme one. You are the one we turn our face to. You are the one we honor. You are the one we adore. You are the one, Lord Jesus Christ. Come down today, Lord, in your presence. May you take each man and woman, boy and girl, under your divine care. May you heal the sick, Lord, and deliver the bound. May you pour in your Holy Spirit, Jesus. Send a great healing, Lord. Healing arise in your wings of faith, God. and may every individual reach and touch the hem of your garment. I know we would be made whole. I know there's miracles waiting to happen. I know there's a spirit ready to be released on your people. If we could just humble ourselves and pray and seek, Lord, and turn toward your holy place, then you would hear from heaven and you would heal our land. Would you anoint this meeting, God, with men and women of faith and courage, Lord, that Satan would be so bound and darkness that shackles and unbelief, Lord, would drop at the very presence of Jesus Christ. Your bride is waiting, Lord. We're longing for you. Let there be a breakthrough, Lord, as we even prepare for this summer camp, Lord, and what you would have for our young people, for our children, for our assembly, Lord. May nothing hinder or cause there to be a diversion, but may the Holy Spirit break through and clarity and freedom and liberty. May even this service today be, Lord, a continuation of the move of the Holy Ghost. Let a revival break out in our hearts. Let there be a liberty in your presence, God, as we worship you. Come down today and meet every need, every request, every desire. May you be special today as we invite you again, Jesus, for your glory and for your honor. We wait upon you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. We thank you already for what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; We wait, Lord. We desire to see you, God, come walking up and down these aisles, oh God. We want to touch you again, Jesus. We thank you for what you're doing, God. Move in our hearts, move in our souls, move in our lives, God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] man. You can have your seats. We want to welcome everyone who's here this morning and uh it's getting close to camp time starts next week and so we have a number of visitors who are with us and we want to take the time to uh especially welcome you into the assembly here. We want to welcome brother Aladdin and Sister Emanuela Zerich. I hope that's right. I'm not sure how to pronounce a C with a little funny squiggle over it. But um but we're happy to have brother Aladdin and Sister Emanuel here from Serbia. If you could stand wherever you are so we know who you are. Amen. God bless you. We're happy to have you here. And we also have brother Mark and Sister Tina Stany. They're not strangers and their family here. We get you to stand from down in Arizona. God bless you. Happy to have you here. And also we have um some visitors from Norway. Uh we have sister Anita Meyer visiting from Norway with her daughter. And also we have uh brother Andreas and brother Celus Roland from Alisand in Norway. We get you to stand up. Amen. God bless you. And if we missed anyone else who visiting with us, we're real happy to have you here. and uh trust you feel at home in God's presence this morning. Amen. Um we just one announcement. There's going to be a quick meeting for camp counselors immediately after the service in the fellowship room. So right after the service, all the counselors, if you could meet right after uh service, we're going to be turning to the word at this time and brother Ed's going to be taking the prayer requests and as he comes, let's sing together. My Jesus, I love thee. It's number 802 on the screen. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. for thee all the faulties of sin I resign. [Music] My gracious redeemer, my savior are thou. If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. I love thee because I love thee because thou has love me [Music] and purchase my part on Calary tree. Oh, I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow. If ever I love thee, my Jesus. [Music] The last verse in mentions in manions of glory and endless [Music] delight. I ever adore thee, Lord in heaven so bright. And I'll sing with the glittering [Music] crown of my brow. If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. [Music] All that I have and all that I have, all I shall ever be. Oh, it cannot repay the love debt I owe. I surrender to thee. All that I am and all that I am, all I shall ever be. Oh, can I repay the love of death? I surrender to thee. I love you, Lord. And I lift my voice to worship [Applause] you. Oh my soul, rejoice. Take joy my king. Hear what you hear, Lord. Let it be a sweet, sweet, sweet sound in your ear. Oh, I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice [Music] to worship. Oh my soul, rejoice. Oh, take joy. Take joy my king. [Music] Let it be a sweet sweet sound. [Music] And we're going to go to prayer at this time. As we go to uh brother Ed, just one prayer request we want to make mention. There's a lady by the name of Joan Wood, 58 years old. Um someone brother Andrew Novakowski knows he's got cancer and uh doesn't have long to live. And just asking we pray for her this morning for the biscuit. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Another good day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In his presence, the supernatural is happening and we need some supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a lot of supernatural. &gt;&gt; I'm sure there are those here that are needy and we're going to have prayer. And uh uh just before I pray, I want to make mention that we we're going to pray as a congregation for brother Ed Nicaroo. And brother Ed, I'm going to have you come down in just a moment. Uh the uh the doctors can't seem to find out just what is uh what is happening in his body. And as I waited on God and we had prayer yesterday and then I just held it in my heart, Brother Ed, through the day and I thought and the words came to me, this devil can hide from the doctors, but he can't hide from God. &gt;&gt; And we believe that God's going to deliver our brother uh from this affliction. It's as though if you know what arthritis is in a joint, it's like arthritis has consumed his entire body, muscles and bones and everything. And they think, well, it may be a side effect of some medication. And brother Brandham says, you said cancer, that's the name that you give it. But he said it's a devil. &gt;&gt; And that's what we believe. That's what this congregation believes. It is a devil that takes opportunity and uses whatever means he can. And uh I I asked Joanne to come to the piano because I want to sing blessed assurance Jesus is mine with all of the he was the fullness of the attributes of God. And this is one of my favorite songs if not the favorite. This is my story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my song. And I'm here this morning to give him praise. &gt;&gt; Praising the Savior &gt;&gt; all the day long. &gt;&gt; That's what we're living for. &gt;&gt; That's what he redeemed us for. &gt;&gt; And we're not our own. &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price. Is that not so? &gt;&gt; You are not your own. You're not here just to receive some blessing. We're here to give blessing. &gt;&gt; We're here to contribute to the body of Jesus Christ. And I believe that it's our responsibility to uh gather ourselves together to muster all the faith. The angels of God are here &gt;&gt; that's what he said &gt;&gt; to energize your faith &gt;&gt; under the direction of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We give ourselves to him now completely and freely that he might come and accomplish. I don't want to just see us, you know, attempt something, but let it be done &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, please? And I'd like to sing the first verse. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. And all of those of you that are visiting, so happy to have you and see you here. Amen. And to know that the God of this nation is the God of your nation. He's the God of the message, the God of Elijah is present with us. Amen. All right, let's join together now. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Blessed asssurance, [Music] Jesus is mine. Oh, [Music] the glory divine [Music] air of salvation and purchase of God and born of his spirit. And what he &gt;&gt; you lift it up to him now. This is my story. [Music] This is my soul. [Music] My savior [Music] all the day long. This is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day. I wonder, brother Ed Naruk, would you come down as we sing the chorus again? This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all day long. This is my soul. [Music] This is my song. I'm praising my Sior. All the we'll bow our heads in prayer. Going to ask brother John, brother Tom if you please come. Brother Ernie, you'll join us. Thank you, Father. Is any afflicted? Let him pray. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Our brother is terribly afflicted. &gt;&gt; Is any sick? Let him call." And he's been brought down to this state of sickness. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to anoint me with oil. I believe in the scripture. I believe in following every word to the letter &gt;&gt; and God is going to deliver our brother. I anoint you, brother Ed, &gt;&gt; according to the word of God, according to the scriptures, according to the promise. God has made you a promise. Father, we're coming. We're coming on the basis of your promise. This devil has hid from the doctors. This devil has hid from the instruments. This devil has hid from the medication. But this devil cannot hide from the antidote to Calvary. This devil cannot hide from the discernment of the Holy Spirit. Satan, you are exposed and you must leave this body. Come out in the name of Jesus Christ. And may our brother Ed be delivered. Lord, as he stands here on this spot, let the virtue of the resurrected Christ begin now to sir through his body and move the pain out of these muscles. Move the pain out of these joints and bones. Move the pain, oh God. And I pray you'll put a song of confession in his mouth. And that he will be filled with rejoicing. He will be filled with, oh God, with joy unspeakable and full of glory. We thank you for Calvary. We thank you for the words that were ever uttered. It is finished. Lord, I pray for all that may be in need physically and spiritually in this building today. Oh God, come forth. I pray and meet every need. Oh Lord, the request that has been written, Father, I pray that you'll meet the request. I ask, oh God, you'll send the Holy Spirit that came on the day of Pentecost and made that spirit fill and refill. Oh God, to overflowing every one of your children, your vessels, we are here. I pray you'll now anoint your word, oh God. Anoint us to hear and receive. Anoint us to speak, oh God. Each one as we stand at our post of duty, anoint us, I pray, arrest. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many want to raise their hands and say, "Anoint me aresh, oh God. Fill me aresh, oh God. Take this time. I surrender it to you. I surrender my vessel to you. We sanctify ourselves, oh God. Sanctify us, oh God, I pray. In the name of Jesus Christ, and for your glory. Hallelujah. And we thank you for this healing upon our brother Ed. Oh God, the enemy's defeated brother Ed in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The messenger said now thank him for it. We thank you for it. Oh God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus. How wonderful you are. Thank you father. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; This is my story. &gt;&gt; I can't ever get tired of Calvary. &gt;&gt; I can't ever get tired of redemption. &gt;&gt; All a day long. All a day long. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. And thank you, musicians. While we were gone for a few days, we visited uh some of the believers up in Hudson Hope and probably you wouldn't know, but there's uh four believers up there now. One sister just from the Philippines just arrived and she took a position from Hong Kong, not knowing where in the world Hudson Hope was. She took a position there to uh be a nanny or take care of a home. And here she's two blocks from another sister. And she's the only sister in Hudson Hope, Sister Lillian Meyers, and been craving and desiring some fellowship for a number of years. And God sends somebody from Hong Kong, two two blocks from her house. I say, "Isn't God wonderful?" &gt;&gt; I think God has a sense of humor as well, doesn't he? He just does things in such a such a unique wonderful way. So, we were able to be with them and Sister Lillian called them called her. Her name is Sister Myra. And she came over to the house. She didn't know that we were there. She just said, "Come on over for coffee." So, she walks in the door and here's uh Sister Ruth and I sitting there and she almost she almost collapsed because all she's seen is the videos of the streaming. she's seen the meetings on on streaming and and then there's another brother there, brother Gary uh Steiner and he's he's uh way back before there was any any streaming he was getting videos and he saved those videos and he's got stacks of them. I mean stacks of them. I've never seen so many videos in my life in one place and he hands them out or whatever more, but he and his wife and his wife passed away and went to be with the Lord a lot of years ago and it just, you know, God's got some wonderful people tucked away. &gt;&gt; He just seems to keep them to himself and and it's so nice to be with them. Really wonderful. Well, we're happy that you're all here and uh Brother Alladan and his wife, God bless you, Brother Alladan. I know that they've greeted you, but I wonder if I have Brother Alladed stand if you would please. Brother Alladan, this is his first time to be here in Canada, right? And this is a brother that received the message many years ago when Yugoslavia was still Yugoslavia before it broke up into many different countries and provinces. And uh brother Aladan, he knows to do only really one thing and that's work. And he works for this message. He just translates. He hasn't hardly got time to earn a living. He just so busy working and he's translated messages and duplicated them and sent them. We had a little building fact is brother Bob Lock I remember well that you you gave an offering a substantial offering to buy a building over there in Subetita which is right on the Hungarian border. And that work never really got started there. and we felt bad and and the building stayed empty and it was used for different things and so on but never really established into work. Well, I want want the congregation here to know because others gave, but especially you, Brother Bob, that that building was eventually sold and we had a hard time selling it because it was a very old, very old stone building. And uh but it was right in the heart of a university city and I walked the streets and there were just hundreds and hundreds of young people and my art heart actually pained. I thought, "Oh, God, if I could just be here and speak the language, I'm I'm sure that something would start. You know what that's like? You just you you it's like you get in the racetrack and you're you want to you want the gate to open so you can get out." And that's how I was feeling. Well, that it, you know, God's ways are not our ways. And that building finally sold and brother Milo suggested, why don't we use the money they needed for a printing press? And so the money from there, brother Bob bought a printing press and brother uh Alladen is printing messages and sending them all over and sending them to the hub and they're being downloaded on the hub. And I just want to say on behalf of God's work, on behalf of the kingdom of God, on behalf of the congregation has never met you before, brother Alladen, keep up the good work and God bless you. We're going to find out a lot of things when we get to the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to stand with me and I'll have you turn to 2 Corinthians the 3 chapter. We're going to begin reading from the 11th verse. And while you're turning in your Bible, uh, I'm going to ask one more thing of you if you would please. I have been holding the camp and the meetings. Brother Donnie Reagan, his wife is actually having surgery, gallbladder surgery on the 30th, and he's he's leaving about four or five days later. And he said, you know, it's really the last thing in the world he wants to do is leave his wife just immediately after surgery. But he said if you really feel that I should come uh I will come. And I said I really feel you should come uh for sure. And uh so I am holding these meetings up and I would like to ask you to join with me and to take time out and when God brings it to your mind if you take five minutes or take an hour or miss a meal say I'm going to I'm going to pray earnestly that God will do exceedingly abundantly above all we could ask or think. not some away time in the future, but during these meetings and that God will so direct our brother Donnie Reagan that he'll have that direct mind of God and it'll come and minister to us. Do you believe that? Amen. I want to be ministered to. I'm going to come there with expectation and we want to be able to say whatever you say Lord &gt;&gt; I will do it. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to come with that with that kind of uh attitude. So I would ask you to remember remember the meetings and brother Donnie and prayer especially for those of you that don't know we had 44 that were out from our assembly out from our assembly that want to come to the and be in the camp. And uh they asked what should we do and I said do everything in your power to make room. Put them anywhere. put them everywhere. We'd want to make room. And finally, there wasn't 44. There was 50. And then I just learned this morning that is just for the senior camp. If we include the juniors, there's 60 additional people or young people that are coming. And mothers and fathers are coming as well. And I see that some have already come. And it's wonderful to have you. And we ask you to come. Those of you that are visiting, come with great expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need God, friends. &gt;&gt; We don't need program. We need God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before we read, we'll pray once again. Oh, God, you are the God that Abraham worshiped, the God of Abraham. You are the God that Isaac worshiped. You're the God of Isaac. You are the God that Jacob worshiped. You are the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; You visited each of these men. You spoke to them. And then you called your first prophet and brought him before a pillar of fire in a burning bush and spoke and said, "I'm the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." Oh, you're the God of the foundation. You're the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. And you brought him forth. You are the father that sent the Holy Spirit. You are the very God who is a living God. You have eyes to see and ears to hear and a mouth to speak. Speak, oh God, and we will hear. You are the one who's called us. You have sent this message in this hour because we needed it desperately. And now may it become a living word. Not in our ears only, not in our mind only, but down into the region of the soul, &gt;&gt; changing and transforming in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Corinthians 3 chapter and I would like to start at verse 11. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remainth is glorious. Seeing then that we have such a hope, we use great plainness of speech, and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, and that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that uh which is abolished. But their minds were blinded. For until this day remainth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Notice where the veil is. Nevertheless, when it, that's the heart, shall turn to the Lord, Malachi 4, and the veil and the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. There is what? &gt;&gt; Liberty. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. You may be seated. Now I have a number of scriptures and I want to uh bring them to you on the on the screen so you will be able to uh follow along uh in the thought today. Beholding the glory of the Lord is the title of the message I I wish to speak to you about. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. We all with open face, that is a unveiled face. In other words, there's nothing to afflict or to hinder our vision. This is all in this one verse. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. Now, we're going to be looking at a few more scriptures in just a moment, but uh the thought that I would like to direct your mind to is when a person holds something in view, when they hold something in focus, don't not meaning about reading a book just now, but it it could be that. But people today have goals. They have objectives in life. A lot of uh young people you have just graduated and others are in a certain kind of profession or job. And regardless of what it is, we have a certain goal. You mothers are raising a family. You have desires. You are observing your children. You see certain talents or skills that might be there. And and so you want to direct their energy. You want to direct them in a godly way. And so you have a goal. I can tell you one thing. You cannot have that goal for five minutes. You've got to have that goal as a constant objective in front of you. And then as you have hold that in front of you, now I speak personally for yourself as an individual. You keep moving. Brother Brown talked about healing. You keep that that perfect image in front of you &gt;&gt; and then you keep mov Why was he saying that is because there's transforming power something activates your faith &gt;&gt; and you hold it right in front of you. It's not based on feeling. You hold it in front of you and you move in that direction and there is a transforming power within the word itself. It's not anything that you generate. We all we can do is be obedient to the word and then and then as we're obedient to the word then it's up to God &gt;&gt; to do the rest. &gt;&gt; It's not up to you and I. We can't bring it about. &gt;&gt; For example, let's talk about a resurrection. What can you do on behalf of a resurrection? What can you do on behalf of uh a rapture? What can you do on behalf of the change of the body? You physically you can't do anything but spiritually you can do one thing and you must do this one thing. You must hold that objective in front of you. You must hold that goal in front of you. And I will I I would like to just show you how this is so uh pronounced in the scripture. While we look, Paul said, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. And to look, he's saying, while we look not, but we do look at the things which are are unseen, and we are to observe it, to contemplate it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To mark it, &gt;&gt; Amen. make it as a mark &gt;&gt; uh to fix one eyes upon to direct one's attention to and having regard for a thing. &gt;&gt; Now I just want to stop there. One thing in brother Brandham's life I can tell you he had he had all through his ministry he had very very deep the deepest respect for the call of God on his life. &gt;&gt; Do I need to say that again? &gt;&gt; He had the deepest of respect for the call of God upon his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He could never be uh uh thwarted or turned from or distracted from the fact what the angel of the Lord said to him. If you can get the people to believe, nothing will stand before your prayers. How many times they say it? Hundreds of times. Why? Because it was always the same. Now, if God put a call on his life, I'm here today to ask you, what about the call on your life? &gt;&gt; What about the call of God? You're sitting here. You are a witness to the fact that uh even by your presence, God moved on me. God spoke to me. God did something. I'm here. I'm here. And I want you to go back to that. I want you to go back to that original. Say, "God did it." &gt;&gt; I got thinking about the people that came from uh so many different places. I got thinking about their the their the the moving and the logistics of and the and the trouble they went through and the tearing they went through, the separation they went through that because because of a call of God on their life. I want you to go back to that because that same God that gave a call originally, that is the same God that still has a plan. &gt;&gt; He's got a he's got a path for you to walk. &gt;&gt; He's got another footstep for you to step into. And we never want to lose sight of that. God has an objective. I want you to be able to say today, God, let me see that objective. &gt;&gt; Let me fix my eyes upon it. &gt;&gt; And the it to look is to the distant mark looked at the goal or the end that one has in view. That's why the apostle Paul said, I press what? Toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. I'm pressing towards that. I'm not allowing anything to be in my way. Paul said in Timothy, and without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifest in the flesh. And I have a reason for bringing this word manifest out in the next number of scriptures is because you may not see what you want to see in your life, but if you behold and and be given granted by grace a from God the ability to see. Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes, for they see." &gt;&gt; And blessed are your ears, for they hear. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes," he's saying, "There's a lot of eyes that don't see what you're seeing. And there's a lot of ears that don't hear what you're hearing, but blessed are your eyes, and blessed are your ears, for they see." I say, "God, be merciful to us that our eyes don't become uh our ears don't become dull and our eyes don't become shaded over or veiled over with anything. Keep my vision clear." &gt;&gt; God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received up into glory. Manifest. God was manifest. God appeared. God declared plainly. God showed oneself. God came into view. God made known. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; That's what God has done. God was manifest. Not everybody sees it, but God was manifest. And we can lose. We can we can so easily lose because uh Satan is so full of all the using every kind of device and every kind of distraction every thing that's that he has at his disposal in this day to get people brother Brandham talks about a glare. People becomes blinded because of a glare. They get blinded because of worldliness. They get blinded because of all that the world throws up in front of them and oh oh maybe we should be doing this maybe we should be going that going that way that let's let's make absolutely certain that nothing is allowed to dim our vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the congregation be able to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it steps on your toes, just say, "Ouch, God, help me." Because there's no use just, you know, we're not we're not here filling in time. We're here to see the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So to manifest the life was manifested, the apostle said, "And we have seen it." For the life was manifested, John said, was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us. We have seen it is uh properly to stare at. Oh, I want the people. I'm gonna I'm gonna be laborious this morning if you will allow me. &gt;&gt; I want you because I feel that in a congregation this size, Satan throws so many things in front of you that we get staring at other things instead of staring at the objective. &gt;&gt; You know what it is to to be stared at? Have you ever come into a place and people dropped what they were doing or they stopped what they were doing? &gt;&gt; My wife and her sister up up in the north went into a a a farmer's store, quite a large store, and people sit at the coffee table and and they and they talk there by the hour. think sister Cindy Bergen where your mom worked for so many years. And so my wife and and her sister walked into this store and and sat down. I mean, when do you see two women, you know, with long dresses on as it were and and as conservative as they are and their long hair and so on and walk in and it's just like everybody around just kind of stopped. Oh, where'd these people drop in from? and and and you know, some people don't like to stare, but others don't mind staring. And these folks didn't mind staring. They just stopped and they just looked. And then they talked to somebody else and then both of them would look. Then they might have a sip of coffee and then the whole table would look and they said, "As long as they were there, they just stared at them." Well, when you get stared at, you can feel almost uncomfortable. But we as believers according to the scripture and the scriptures I want to give don't be ashamed to stare at at the manifestation of God in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's going to be the theme in this service. God has become very evident and God has vindicated him. Those are words we use vindicated himself. God has proven himself. God has become visible. God has become very plain. &gt;&gt; God has spoken &gt;&gt; and we must never tire of looking at that manifestation &gt;&gt; even in your weakness, &gt;&gt; even in your failure. Say, you know, Satan, he wants you to he wants you to become distracted and look at your weakness or look at your failure. And you want to tell him, &gt;&gt; Satan, that's not what I'm looking at. He wants you to look at the doctor's report. He wants you to look at the medical uh all devices. He wants you to look to the medication. And I'm not saying that you shouldn't take it. I'm saying that's not your objective. &gt;&gt; That is not your answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's another objective. And if you look to the right thing and focus on the right thing, there will be a transformation that'll take place and you will become what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To see, to properly stare at, to take heed, to see with the mind, to perceive, to become acquainted with by experience. It's not just something that's not mind over matters, not something in your mind, but you actually experience it. And there's a note a notation here. This word gives prominence to the discerning mind when the physical side recedes. This word denotes perception in general resulting principally from vision. So we want to say I I love this part and that's why I wanted to have you read it. When the physical side recedes, oh this flesh needs to recede. Amen. &gt;&gt; All this human reasoning &gt;&gt; needs to recede. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All this human effort needs to recede. And let the Holy Spirit come with his objective &gt;&gt; in your life in the church in the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We beheld his glory. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. First John said again, that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, and we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. Jesus said, "Those of you young people who've had brother Biscll's sign in your Bible, you'll find this verse, John 14:21. My father was quite a a letter writer and he wrote me because we were parted as a family uh for a lot of years. my sister who's here, she would be in one place and I'd be in another place. But my father wrote, he wrote beautiful handwriting. And it's one time, I don't remember any other scriptures he may have referred me to, but I was in my teens and I remember this time. And whenever he wanted to really catch my attention, he would say Edward. And he wrote Edward, he said, "Always ask God to reveal himself to you." And he gave this scripture, "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, &gt;&gt; and I will love him." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could you ever could you ever tire of hearing that? &gt;&gt; And I will love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And will manifest myself to him. I could close this service right now and if you could take that as a theme and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. &gt;&gt; Take the whole world &gt;&gt; but give me that. &gt;&gt; Take all the glamour. &gt;&gt; Take all the excitement. take everything the world has, but just let me keep that as my focus and I will love him. &gt;&gt; And I will manifest myself to him. Oh. Oh, what a glorious what glorious words. Let that be an objective before me. All I want to see is that manifestation and have eyes to see it and a mind to discern it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you this, you can never be the same person &gt;&gt; if he manifests himself to you &gt;&gt; and you keep your focus. You just view that manifestation. You view and we'll speak a little further. You speak, you view this manifestation. You view it and you hold it and you make it a part of the very fiber of your life. Just your thought focused on that will bring about changes in your life. Those of you that have raised children, you know yourself, you have to keep an objective before them. You have to keep speaking to them. You need to keep encouraging them. If you have a good instructor or a teacher whatever more educator then needs it needs to keep before the class and before the people who they are and what they are and before a congregation. I believe that a preacher is delinquent if he doesn't say to the congregation who they are in Christ. There's no one in the world like the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't care what anybody says h about you as an individual. But once God has laid his hand on you, once he has called you, you are my son, &gt;&gt; you are my daughter, &gt;&gt; and I will love you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The whole world can pass off this scene. &gt;&gt; Then what difference does it make? &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't ever let Satan cheapen that. &gt;&gt; And I would never let it take it. I would never allow to become too common. &gt;&gt; I'd sooner be called a simple person. I'd sooner be called a simple man and see God in simplicity. &gt;&gt; I will manifest myself to him. John said also 1 John 3 and8 in part for this purpose the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. Manifested once again similar to manifest to appear or to show oneself to make visible or known what has been hidden or unknown. That's why the seals had to be opened. There were things that had been hidden and unknown. Can we ever weary? I don't think that I think that it's a mistake if we just, you know, get certain phrases. Oh, the seals are open. Well, that's that's not just what we want to hear. We want to hear what is it that was open. &gt;&gt; What is it that was manifested? &gt;&gt; What is it? And brother Brandham actually gives details some of these things. to manifest whether by words or deeds or in any other way and to make known by teaching, to expose, to view, to be plainly recognized, thoroughly understood who and what one is. God wants to be thoroughly understood, &gt;&gt; who he is &gt;&gt; and what he's doing in this time. Brother Brandham relates in a very complimentary way uh the great servant of God, Brother Billy Graham. And he says he heard him and he admired him for his courage and he said he'll go into a city and have 30,000 converts. And then he comes back a year later and he can't find 30. And he said, "It's you lazy preachers that sit there with your feet upon the desk." And he began to chastise them for their lack of working with the 30,000. Brother Brandham, he just took it a little bit further and he said, "If I could get to my brother or speak," he said, "I'd like to," he he mentioned the Apostle Paul. He said, "But I'd like to go back and and and tell him what the Apostle Paul did." The Apostle Paul went into a city and got one convert. &gt;&gt; But he said he established that one in the word, in the message of the hour. He established him. And then when he came back a year later, there was 30. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening in China right now. And one gets established in the word of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, you wouldn't be where you are today if you just float along on on uh on, you know, the the blessings. We love the blessings, but it's not the blessings that we're seeking. I'm seeking the lifechanging value of the word of God. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm seeking that element of the word of God that transforms a man from a sinner to a saint and from a saint to a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To establish and and don't think that these things don't speak very very deep to me. I feel a great responsibility that we don't just have a service but that the word is preached in such a way so that people are established. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't take you just into the negative things or I've heard people speak about the mess that's in the message. You don't get anywhere &gt;&gt; if you just take a child and you just say you did this wrong or you did that wrong. What's the matter with you? You stupid child. You can't even tie your shoelaces, right? You'll never never learn, never come any place. You have to tell them who they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the ability they have &gt;&gt; and who they are in Christ. &gt;&gt; In fact is I'll tell you in spite of the wrong you are obligated to look to the right. &gt;&gt; You're obligated to look to the finished work. Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't look at the failures. A lot of people looked at the failures of Jesus Christ and where are they? &gt;&gt; But there were others who confessed when Jesus said, "Who do men say that I am?" &gt;&gt; That's not the question. Brother Brandham said, "The question is who do you say I am?" &gt;&gt; What do you say? What do you say this word is? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What do you say this message is? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; For this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil which we just went over. Now you can turn in your Bible if you would to Revelation the first chapter. Is it all right with you if I just take my time? And in verse eight, I'm not I'm not referring to all the scriptures. I would like to but uh we'll just read from verse 8. Now it's the same one that was manifested and John wrote a good deal about him. But now John is John is being introduced to him in a different way and he's saying I'm alpha and omega the beginning and the ending say the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty. I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and in patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seeest write in a book. Notice that please. What thou sayest, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamus, and unto Thotyra, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the Son of Man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Clothed with a garment down to the foot, and gird about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And when I saw him, when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, "Fear not. I am the first and the last." John, that'll be the end of our reading there for the moment. John had saw him many times but he didn't see him in this fashion. He was now seeing something very very different. And the Lord Jesus said to him what you see right in a book. This is not going to be like John one in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. This is going to be somewhat different. What you see now, this is a different vision. This is a different view. And this is a different manifestation. And I want you to write this in a book and send it to the seven churches. And being turned, he said, and being turned, I I saw. Write the things which you've seen. The things which John wrote was sent now to these seven churches. Written messages. Written messages sent to seven churches. And I think that it's very important that we we see you know we we hear now these messages which John saw. This account which John saw was written in a book. And then seven angels or seven messengers to those churches picked up the revelation of what he saw and spoke it to the people in their time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that was done specifically. So that word that was spoken for their time, God also had raised a people that was made to hear that word. and an elect in every age and they received it and when they heard it then they begin to see. So it went from what John saw then God said what you see write it and what was written messengers spoke it &gt;&gt; and when the messenger spoke it the people elected in that day they heard it and by hearing it they saw him again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the process. &gt;&gt; That's what God intends. God doesn't intend you just hear a message or you hear the seven seals are open or all of these things and all of these little phrases and so on. God intends you to see a manifestation of that person. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, &gt;&gt; when you see him, &gt;&gt; you'll never be the same. He says he was manifested for this purpose. Listen to me very close. For this purpose, God's word speaking now. For this purpose was he manifested to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The power is in the manifestation. If you see him manifested, what was the work of the devil? His cunning in Eden was the first thing to take the word of God and twist it just a wee bit and cause Eve, the mother, the daughter of God to disbelieve it. And everything we see on the streets, the institution, every hospital, every graveyard happened there. &gt;&gt; That amen was far too weak. That's right. &gt;&gt; Every every graveyard &gt;&gt; was there. I've got loved ones. You have loved ones. They're there because Eve disbelieved. &gt;&gt; The hospitals are filled to overflowing and you can't hardly get in an emergency ward because of what Eve did that day. &gt;&gt; Every one of them &gt;&gt; happened there. &gt;&gt; But that's what he came to destroy. &gt;&gt; He came to destroy your unbelief. He came to destroy your doubt. He came to destroy your question and the thing that would derail you. He came to destroy it. &gt;&gt; And it's not that you just put your arms up and say, "Oh, God, come and do it." No, he's saying you look at the right thing and I will do it. &gt;&gt; You keep the objective in front of you. You look at this manifestation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's my challenge to you today. I'm not just preaching. I'm preaching something that I actually I pondered so deeply. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we are changed as we look with an open face. &gt;&gt; Unveiled &gt;&gt; face, not some facade. We're not putting on some fancy facade. Oh, I go to Cloverdale Bible way or I go here or I do this or I'm a believer. No, we don't put on some facade. We just look right there. &gt;&gt; But when we do, you know what I did? I went into the mirror. &gt;&gt; I went to the mirror. I said, "You are a son of God." &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ went to Calvary for you. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ said, "I will manifest myself to you." &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ said, "I love you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could go there and say, "You dirty rat. You're a failure to begin with." And where would that get you? &gt;&gt; Where would that get you? That won't get you anywhere. But when you can look there and say, "I've seen the manifestation and I look there and I have said several times over and over yesterday and through today and the day before." I said, "God, there's a lot of things I don't know." I even read the scripture. There's a lot of things I don't know. But I know one thing. &gt;&gt; You manifested yourself &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; You proved yourself. It never gets stale to me. It never gets old to me when I see that the secrets of the hearts have been revealed. I listen to the messengers preaching on pardon &gt;&gt; and when he he comes and he just speaks about the denominations and how you know why he's speaking about the denominations and against the denominations organized religion not because the churches are wrong. He said he said that the Baptist or Presbyterians a Methodist Pentecost or whatever. He said but but it has separated the brethren &gt;&gt; and I'm here to unite the brethren. &gt;&gt; And he said that the traditions have veiled the people. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, friends, this comes much closer to home. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said after a generation, two generations or so, we've now been maybe four or five generations that are here with our children and they simply hear about a prophet and they hear this is what he said and they hear this is how you should live and this is how you should dress. They haven't got any experience. Why? They only do it. This is how we take communion. We do we wash feet because why do you wash feet? Well, I I was raised that way. That's the way we we do it in the home. It become a tradition to you. &gt;&gt; And he said of prophets in the Old Testament and when they got to the New Testament, they had made a tradition out of their life. &gt;&gt; Oh, Sunset Mountain and what happened there and so on so forth. Listen friends, unless unless the manifestation of this hour is a living reality in your soul, you don't know why you're doing it. and and and that and that's a it'll become a curse to you, not a blessing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It must not become a tradition because the tradition will veil you. The tradition will put a cloud over your vision. You won't be able to see what you're supposed to see when it just becomes a tradition. And I'm sad sad to say that the message has become a tradition to multitudes of people. And I would like to say I would like to see before God that any trace of tradition could vanish out of this congregation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We don't want it as a tradition. &gt;&gt; We don't want to come here to church because it's a tradition 10:30 on Sunday morning. We want to come because we're hungry and we believe in God. We believe in the Holy Spirit speaking through the man of God. That's why we're here. And if we're here as a tradition, you're better off not to be here. &gt;&gt; We're not here because of a tradition. &gt;&gt; We're here because we hunger for God. &gt;&gt; We hunger for the realities of God. &gt;&gt; They made a tradition out of the message. &gt;&gt; Pentecost was real, but they made a tradition out of it. The work of grace under Wesley was real, but they made a tradition under it and made a &gt;&gt; disgrace. &gt;&gt; I said, "What do we have? What did you manifest?" I see how God manifested and made real his Godhead. And the confusion has disappeared and vanished when we were confused and wondered and we didn't know. And man, I respected and people that you have as friends perhaps consumed with what the Godhead is or don't know what the Godhead is. Don't ever lose the cherished place in your heart that you have that God has manifested himself to you and made himself clear. He came into view and you see him so clear and you wonder why others can't see it, but you see it so clear. That's the manifestation. &gt;&gt; That's what you're treasure. [Music] You know, there's multitudes don't understand the serpent seed. People on the peripheral on the fringes of the message, they don't understand the serpent seed. I can tell you if you're here. I'll never never forget the day brother Bam just put his arm over my shoulder and said, "Brother Eddie, this only comes by revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You pray and I'll pray for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will reveal it to you. I tell you what, friends, here today, all these years later, it is a treasure to me &gt;&gt; that God manifested himself &gt;&gt; on a personal way. I want you to be able to go back today. I don't care how simple it is, and I don't care when it was in your life. I don't care how far back, but go back to that time and say, "That was such a treasured moment." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And look on that manifestation and and stare at it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't ever become tired or weary of it. Stare at it. &gt;&gt; That was one time. And there's another time. And there's another time. And then you'll find yourself staring at the resurrection, &gt;&gt; staring at the rapture, staring at the change of the body. and you'll go to the mirror one day or tomorrow morning and say, "You're going to change. &gt;&gt; You're going to change in your atoms because my Lord Jesus said so." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you'll look at yourself in a different way. Brother Brandon said one of the last services he preached, I think modern events made clear by prophecy, he told he told the people and the women and and all of those gracious people that had him at that time, mostly I think Pentecostal people. And he said, "Look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Go and look in the mirror of God's word." &gt;&gt; And when I look into the mirror of God's word, the message of the hour, and see what he said about the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh friend, you have to help me. &gt;&gt; I just feel so consumed. &gt;&gt; When they when John the Baptist came out, &gt;&gt; some some were saying they're looking at the same man. &gt;&gt; Some said he's a teacher. &gt;&gt; Some say he's a rabbi. He's a great man. &gt;&gt; John saw the same man, &gt;&gt; his cousin in the flesh. One day he looked at him, he saw something different. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; He looked at a man and saw a lamb. &gt;&gt; And he wanted everyone to see this is the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; This is the sacrifice of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he uttered those glorious words. Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb &gt;&gt; of God &gt;&gt; that taketh away &gt;&gt; the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, behold. &gt;&gt; Pilate said, "Behold the man." &gt;&gt; But I choose John's words. Behold the lamb. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And here we are 2,000 plus years later. &gt;&gt; And I can never and you must never weary &gt;&gt; of looking at that manifestation. &gt;&gt; It's not just Jesus of Galilee walking down the banks of the Jordan, but you're looking at the manifestation of God. What was in God's mind? He's sending him to his the word is coming to the prophet and revealing and manifesting himself as a lamb of God. And I want to say to you today, John saw the right thing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And today we had multitudes and tens of thousands of preachers that could see that and would speak about that. But thank God for a messenger that came, an eagle messenger with different eyesight and say, "Behold the bridegroom." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He read the same Bible, everybody read, &gt;&gt; but he saw something different. &gt;&gt; And as the message went on and progressed, &gt;&gt; he even indicated, he said, now and the angel came, the one came to the came to John and said, "Come hither, I will show thee a lamb's &gt;&gt; wife." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not a girlfriend, &gt;&gt; not a fiance. I'll show you the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; We've had in the last two, three weeks, we've had some young women come here and be united to their fiance. And then the words are spoken. I pronounce you &gt;&gt; husband and wife. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you know what that says? That says she goes home to his house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when we had a messenger say, "You are the lamb's wife." &gt;&gt; That was a sign sealed and delivered. We go home to his house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "What do you see, Brother Ed? I see a I see a home. &gt;&gt; I see a place that's been made prepared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see a home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see my husband's home. &gt;&gt; I see his home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's my home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's my home. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want to go home? &gt;&gt; He manifested himself to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; And some of you are here that that devil tries to make you doubt, &gt;&gt; that you're going home, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He tries to make you doubt that you're good enough. &gt;&gt; He tries to tell you that you're not bride. &gt;&gt; He gets you down to a low point and says you're not good enough. Look at and he's he's excellent to point at. Look at all this frailty. Look at this weakness. Look at what you did there. Look what you thought there. You need to go to the mirror. &gt;&gt; You need to look into the glass &gt;&gt; and you need to confess. &gt;&gt; I'm the one he purchased at Calvary. &gt;&gt; I'm the one he went to prepare a place for. &gt;&gt; I'm the one he even came and manifested himself in this time. [Applause] He manifested himself. Friends, all that vindication, listen, I'm not just preaching. I'm telling you, I'm making announcement. All that vindication and you have tapes and you have all kinds of access. And when he calls people up and begins to tell them the secrets of their heart, &gt;&gt; do you know what I want you to say? &gt;&gt; He did that for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was manifested for me. &gt;&gt; God. That wasn't William Brandon. That was God manifesting himself. He manifested himself for me. &gt;&gt; He manifested himself so I could stare at it. &gt;&gt; I got to fix my vision on it. &gt;&gt; It's become a personal thing. &gt;&gt; And something that happened 40 years ago, I bring it right now today current. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if next time you listen to it and you see that gift of God that was sent, you say, "He did that for me." &gt;&gt; And you keep staring at that and looking at that &gt;&gt; and it'll change. &gt;&gt; Things that you see are wrong in your life, needing, needy, God will repair that and fix that for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Came to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The last enemy to be destroyed is &gt;&gt; Say it again. Yes. &gt;&gt; He came to destroy that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He manifested himself in this time to kind of reconfirm to you to just say it again. Here I am, children. I'm saying it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I came to destroy &gt;&gt; the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to release you from the bonds to free you from the chains as a prisoner to be loosed. He said in the revelation of Jesus Christ series unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. He said the word washed there actually in the Greek means to loose. &gt;&gt; He loosed us. &gt;&gt; We were tied to the earth &gt;&gt; by our sins. &gt;&gt; But he loosed us. &gt;&gt; He just didn't use some snips and leave you partially tied. He loosed you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When that sweep comes over you, there'll be nothing to hinder you. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "We couldn't see, couldn't hear, had no conception of heaven or nothing. &gt;&gt; But when the blood came down, it cut the line and we got loosed." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus, who is the image of the invisible God when he was here on earth, he said that he that hath seen me hath seen the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, ' If you had known me, you should have known my father also, and from henceforth you know him and have seen him. And Philip said unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that hath seen me &gt;&gt; hath seen the father. &gt;&gt; And how sayest thou show us the father? &gt;&gt; You see friends, you know, we we see things and we have our concept of them and and all all the people that are here, including myself, we've had our various experiences A lot of people have experiences, but it doesn't result in a new birth. &gt;&gt; But we've had our various experiences within the confines or within the scope of the message. And if anyone walked up to Philip and said, "Phillip, do you know Jesus Christ? Do you know do you know why he came?" Well, yeah, of course. Do you know what's happening? Well, I think I do. I just walking right with him. I'm just staying right with him. Why are you with him? Because I believe him. When he speaks, I listen. I respect everything. I love him with everything I have. I am everything I can possibly be. Then it came to this time. If you'd known me, if you had Janosco actually known, if you had true perception of me, you should have known my father also. And from henceforth, now he doesn't leave it in a negative term. He turns it to the positive. And from henceforth, you know him and you've seen him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Philip's puzzled. Philillip's filled with a question quandry. Lord, show us the father &gt;&gt; and that will satisfy us. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Have I been with you so long and yet you've not known me?" Well, Philip probably in his heart was dismayed at that of course I know you. Then he adds, "And he that has seen me, he's seen the father. And how sayest thou show us the father? So some s is a teacher. Some saw him as a rabbi. Some saw him as a great great miracle worker. Some saw him as a prophet. Others saw him as Christ the anointed one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But even then, what do you see in the message? I see in the message Luke 17:30. This is the revealing of the son of man. I see Malachi 4:5 and 6. The hearts have been turned back. My heart's been turned back. This is Christ. This is the word. I'm following this word. But do we see all of it? And I want to just jar you a little bit. I want to jar you a wee bit. I don't think as believers and I've traveled a great deal and I see where they're at and I see this congregation and I'm very much in tune with your lives. I think there's something of his manifestation sincerely is from brother Biscll to you that we're missing. It is. &gt;&gt; I really think &gt;&gt; we're missing something. So say, "Oh, don't leave us hanging, Brother Ed. What What is the answer?" The answer to me is, and this is what the Holy Spirit's been dealing with me about. We need to identify. Don't forget now when I say the manifestation, the manifestation. We we got it from the receivers's end. But listen to me close now. I want you to take it from the givers's end. Almighty God, brother Ernie. God for these hundreds of billions of years waited for a moment. I'm going to show myself in a certain way because I want to become visible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to become seen. &gt;&gt; I want the people to look on me. I want to become so evident. I want them to stare. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I appear and they stare at it, a power will emanate out from that &gt;&gt; receiving that will change and transform them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says into the same image. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when people look on him and they find fault with Christ, they can never come into the image. No one who found fault with him, even to Pilate who said, "I find no fault in this man." &gt;&gt; But yet he was persuaded by the people influenced to send him to the scourging and to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Right? this congregation. You need less to be taken up with your daily life, &gt;&gt; your daily plans, &gt;&gt; and your daily affairs. And you need to give time, quality time to focusing on the manifestation, how he manifested himself in action and also in word. &gt;&gt; I was so blessed. I have the unveiling of God here. I read this book continually, this message, not because it's just some words or a book that somebody has to read, but it unveils the author and the plan. &gt;&gt; It unveils the author of this this holy word of God. &gt;&gt; It unveils him and it lets me know that God has pulled the he's pulled the veil off. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's pulled the veil of the traditions away &gt;&gt; and and every once in a while, you know, we're human and we're we're given over to little traditions we learned as we were brought up as children. And those of you that were born in Christian homes and those of you that have been born in the message, let me say to you with all love and yet all concern, don't let the message become a tradition to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, this is the way we do it or this is the way we worship or this is the way we have a meeting. I say, God, come and shake our nest. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said to my wife, I said, "Dear, if I knew I could lay hands on the translators of every language in the world, I'd do everything I could to fund the translation of this message." &gt;&gt; You know why? I don't just call it a hub. I don't call it just a translator. When I read such words as I read in here and I can scarcely get through a paragraph before I have it all marked, it becomes so precious because it makes the author known to me. &gt;&gt; I see him manifested. I see the manifestation of God in the message and I I want to stare at it. &gt;&gt; Young people, &gt;&gt; stare at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold the man. &gt;&gt; Behold the revelation of the son of man. His hair is in plain view &gt;&gt; and he did it for you. &gt;&gt; Personally did it for you. &gt;&gt; So that you could go to the mirror &gt;&gt; and I hope a lot of you do &gt;&gt; go to the mirror this afternoon or tomorrow morning. look in there not to merely wash your face or to shave you brothers, but to look in the mirror and say this one, &gt;&gt; God, you manifested yourself. &gt;&gt; You manifested yourself. You even sent a messenger in this day. You sent the whole message. You to so that you could come into plain view. You descended. You came with the message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now listen real close please. I'm not done. &gt;&gt; When he manifested himself, he manifested himself. And I'll just give it to you the way brother Brandon says in the in the unveiling of God said he manifested himself. He showed himself in a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For Moses age. &gt;&gt; He manifested himself then in the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. for that age. &gt;&gt; Don't let your doctrine get in the way. Now, then he manifested himself by coming down on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit so he could dwell in people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, God above. In the New Testament, God with &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now in the age of Christ, God in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just stop there. God in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Then I call on you to go to the mirror. And if you have the courage, &gt;&gt; say, "I'm looking at one that God is in." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God was manifest. &gt;&gt; So that I could point at you and say, "God is in you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can tell you someone else will be in attendance right away. And it'll be the serpent. It'll be Satan, the devil. And he will say all kinds of other things. Ah, you have this and ah, you do this and ah, you've thought that. And ah, you've had this feeling. Say, "Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; I'm saying what God says. God is in me." &gt;&gt; God is in this person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason &gt;&gt; he manifested himself differently and I'm I'm Please, is it all right if I take a little bit more time? The reason why he manifested himself differently he says in one place for dispensation claims. Then brother Brown says he said I I'm I'm a man and I'm a husband and then I had a child and I became a father and then my son had a child and I became a grandfather. Now when I was 16, I couldn't be that age and time &gt;&gt; had to bring him to had to mature him &gt;&gt; to the place where he could be a husband. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now watch it close. Then could be a father. &gt;&gt; That's right. and have a daughter, Rebecca, Sarah, and be a grandfather. &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "My daughter has not got claims on me." &gt;&gt; So, listen close now. I want you to put it together. When he manifest himself, he manifests himself in a certain way, in a certain age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A certain way. He didn't manifest himself in William Brandham's uh uh in his type of ministry in Luther's time. It wasn't the time or the place and the people, the elect were not there for that message. &gt;&gt; So he he manifested himself in different times. He manifest himself if he wanted you to see him as he walked the shores and to hear uh to hear the prophet uh John the Baptist say, "Behold the lamb of God." If he had intended you to be there for that manifestation, you'd have been standing there. &gt;&gt; He would have had you there. &gt;&gt; He's not a god of confusion. He has you here because this is your time. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? And this is your manifestation. &gt;&gt; This was manifest to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; This was manifest to bring a change in your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was manifest if you died to bring you out of the ground in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; This was manifest for the purpose of taking you to his house. &gt;&gt; And so he manifest himself in a certain way so that the people of that time would have claim on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only did he have a claim on you, he came for dispensational claims. &gt;&gt; He didn't come now just as the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; He came now as a bridegroom. &gt;&gt; To get a wife. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be a confusing God if here he came as a bridegroom? There is no wife. &gt;&gt; The denominations couldn't produce a wife. So God had to send that messenger and speak, "Come out from among them and be ye separate," says the Lord. And you know what happened? They came out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. And &gt;&gt; I can look in the mirror and say, "You came out." &gt;&gt; I can also looked in the mirror and say, "You were kicked out." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "My daughter has not got claims on me as a wife. My grandchild does not have claims on me as a son or a daughter because they're a granddaughter." That's the way he was as father and as son and in the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those were different eras. And I want you to be able to go home today and ponder this very deep. He manifested himself for the purpose of laying a claim. &gt;&gt; When you look in the mirror, I want you also to be able to say something else. &gt;&gt; You have been claimed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have been seized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You are a claimed one. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can also look in the mirror and say, "And you have rights." &gt;&gt; You have certain rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Children can go to their parents and say, "Mom, dad, &gt;&gt; I have a certain need, &gt;&gt; a certain thing." And they respond in kind because they are your children. They are your offspring. You can look in the mirror and you should. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, "I've identified the mass the manifestation of God in this hour." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I manifested. How come? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It grips me. &gt;&gt; The word &gt;&gt; speaks to me. &gt;&gt; The word lays hold upon me. &gt;&gt; The word has claimed me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What can you say up there in the balcony? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word has claimed you. &gt;&gt; If that's not the case, &gt;&gt; don't surrender your eyes to sleep &gt;&gt; tonight until you know that in your heart and soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have been claimed. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to confuse it with a lot of words, but in my simplicity, I just thought today, one of the wife's main claims is that I go home with my husband. Amen. &gt;&gt; I go to his house. &gt;&gt; Look in the mirror and say you you are going to his house. &gt;&gt; You are the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That ought to do something. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; there just too many things to say. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; to you unmarried to you ladies, young ladies that are eligible of age and don't have a husband, let me tell you, you have one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a most wonderful husband. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; No earthly husband can love you like he will love you. That's right. &gt;&gt; No husband can care for you and feel what you feel like he can and like he does. And husbands, as I'm one, we make promises and not always able to keep them. We have good intentions, but we're not always able to keep them even though we want to. But I have one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you keep every promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he said, "Brother Larry, and to all you that listen to my voice and on the internet, I go away, but I will come and I'll receive you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes me want to shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It makes me want to sing praises to him. &gt;&gt; You've never seen a man like my husband. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, here's this piece of flesh. Here's this body. Whatever you can use it for, if it can get you just a a little bit more glory and praise and worship. I asked him this morning, Lord, praying for our brother Ed Naroo, not that he'll just have an able body, but that you'll be glorified. &gt;&gt; May you be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't give us just a great meeting to have a meeting, but that you'll be glorified. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of it all &gt;&gt; and so much more &gt;&gt; I could go on, but I'm not going to go on. I want you to leave here today really thinking over deep. I don't want this to be another service and I would really have felt I failed. &gt;&gt; But I want you all of you young people to work to you. Don't let the message ever become a tradition. &gt;&gt; Those you that have been in the way a long time, don't ever let it to be a tradition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're even inclined that way or if you you know feel is just becoming a tradition, go and see what the prophet said about traditions and I tell you he tore them to shreds. &gt;&gt; It's an enemy to us. It'll it's a veil over our eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone gets up and sings or someone gets up and preaches or brother or sister that's next to you. God give me eyes to see. Say, "Oh, I want to see Jesus. Lord, let me see Jesus." And Jesus would say, "Have I been so long with you?" &gt;&gt; And you haven't seen Jesus. &gt;&gt; Look beside you. &gt;&gt; Look around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But But I see this and I see that and I see so much. Have it been so long with you and have you not seen me? What did the manif What did the word What did the manifested word say? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, he was closing now. He was in a pillar of fire form for that day to catch and bring those people out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came in the form of flesh. &gt;&gt; He had to go to Calvary and take the body to be a sacrifice. Had to come in that form. Then he came in the form of spirit so he could he could be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of the one of the greatest tactics of the devil would be to distract you so that you didn't see him in yourself &gt;&gt; and you didn't see him in your brother or sister. That'll be the greatest victory for him. &gt;&gt; But now here's what the messenger said. Listen as I close. He's now in another form. &gt;&gt; Called a bride form. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit had to cultivate, had to form all through these centuries, had to form a bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the word kept forming and molding the bride because he was going to come according to the scripture according to Revelation 10. He was going to descend not just to give us some new church or new ideas or new this not to give us some new tradition to give us and show us this is your husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I bought you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what she does? the bride would be veiled. And in the marriage ceremony of the east, the bride is veiled. Then when she meets her husband, she takes the veil from her face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lays the veil on his shoulder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he assumes responsibility for her &gt;&gt; dispensation claims. He came because she was there. He came because she was mature. She was eligible. He came and received her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And revealed himself, appeared, manifested. &gt;&gt; Fo made himself visible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And some saw it and said cult. &gt;&gt; Some saw it and said strange people. &gt;&gt; Some saw it and said all kinds of things. But some saw it said, "I see the perfect one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I see my lover. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see my husband." &gt;&gt; He's come to claim me. &gt;&gt; And so now I come to the scripture that I opened with. But we all we all by the way internet people wherever you are in the world listening we all not with veiled face with open face. the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's this time we all with open face beholding as in a glass. What is it we behold? Oh, it's not we're beholding this corrupt piece of flesh, trying to make it look better, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's not the point. trying to draw on the world to make ourselves more acceptable or more appealing or more beautiful. That's that's the world. &gt;&gt; We all with open face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking in a glass beholding, not a glance, staring at the glory of God. See what the messenger said. I tell you friends, what what was sent to us in this time was nothing short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; I say to you, we have seen &gt;&gt; his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not all seen it. Many would look at it and say, "What's wonderful about that? &gt;&gt; What's wonderful about Calvary? What's wonderful about this man bleeding out his last breaths? What's wonderful about this crown of thorns? What's wonderful about this rib showing through this body? What's wonderful? But God looked upon it. &gt;&gt; My beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. &gt;&gt; The purchase of the earth. The earth is being purchased. God saw the blood going down. God was claiming the earth back to his original purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we need eyesight. Not man's eyesight. You need the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might want to join me and say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; give me, &gt;&gt; give me the vision. &gt;&gt; Give me the kind of sight I need to have in this time. &gt;&gt; God, open my eyes." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I may see what you have for us. &gt;&gt; We behold his glory. &gt;&gt; And here's the big one, friends. And are changed. &gt;&gt; I want you to have this so indelibly marked on your mind. I'd like to go to every one of your seats. And say this in your ear. He does not say in our chains depending on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's not saying our change if &gt;&gt; says you are changed into the image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we behold him. &gt;&gt; The only thing you do is just look at the right thing. &gt;&gt; And you keep looking at it. You keep looking at it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I see this brother standing many times because his heart rings &gt;&gt; with the word of God. Just keep looking at it, my brother. &gt;&gt; Just keep beholding it. &gt;&gt; Behold that manifestation. This is what thrills me. &gt;&gt; This is what thrills me. Everything I can identify how he manifested himself. This is what thrills me because I know I know I I I felt so pressed this morning. Convey this to the people. Get it to the people that they must look. Just look. Just look and live. Look upon this manifestation. You don't have to generate anything. You don't have to bring the spirit down. He's already here. &gt;&gt; I can't quit. I got just one more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was a whole segment of the message this morning, but I haven't got time to get to it, but I'll just drop it in. Brother Brandham, he's dwelling on what it is we're seeing and the God in different forms. And then he goes to Elisha at Dothan. And the Syrian armies were sent &gt;&gt; to capture him &gt;&gt; because every time Syria tried to take the Israel and the king of Israel, they were there. They weren't there. They were disappeared. And the king called all of his servants and said, "Who here is for the king of Israel?" And one little servant stood up and said, "Sir, your honor, no one here is a traitor, they have a prophet down there." &gt;&gt; And that prophet tells him what you think in your bed chamber. &gt;&gt; And this king says, "Go get him." And the Bible says he sent a host, &gt;&gt; a host of horsemen and chariots and get this prophet and bring him here. I need a prophet like that. &gt;&gt; And his servant woke up in the morning and said, "What shall we do, man of God? What shall we do? We're surrounded. &gt;&gt; Armies are everywhere. Chariots and horsemen are everywhere. What shall we do? Elijah said, "Open the young man's eyes." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when his eyes were opened, he saw the hills full &gt;&gt; of chariots of fire. &gt;&gt; The hills didn't change. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The scenery didn't change. That's right. &gt;&gt; His seeing. And the brother Brandham said he changed his seeing. &gt;&gt; He only changed his seeing. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, this was my message to you today. I pray that God will almighty &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; sweep through Cloverdale Bible Way &gt;&gt; and change the seeing of the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The pulpit doesn't have to change. The building doesn't have to change. The people that you're sitting with don't have to change. It's your seeing that needs to change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; let me see the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; in his people &gt;&gt; in bride form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; open my eyes that I may see. &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Change my seeing Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say &gt;&gt; this is my prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; change my seeing. &gt;&gt; Let me see. &gt;&gt; Let me see Jesus what you see. &gt;&gt; Let me see the people as you see them. &gt;&gt; Let me see the blood as you see them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me see the bride as you see them. &gt;&gt; Let me see my brothers and sisters as you see them. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shall we all rise? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Father, &gt;&gt; father eternal God &gt;&gt; that has sent forth Jesus Christ not only as the lamb and the redeemer. We see these attributes that have come how glorious they are. You were a healer and they were sick because they needed to be healed. You were a savior and there were lost that needed to be saved. And today, Lord, in this day, we need now today, oh God, to see you in your fullness. &gt;&gt; To see you in the consummation of the age, to see you, oh God, that you've come on the scene to call the dead from the graves as the resurrection was in in Matthew 27. There must be indeed another resurrection. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we are viewing the manifestation of the one &gt;&gt; who came with a shout, who came with a voice &gt;&gt; and the trumpet of God. &gt;&gt; Here we are in this hour, in this great hour. Lord, we're not here to miss it. We're here to participate in it. We're here to be part of it. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; we let us sanctify. And we do sanctify ourselves that we might hear you that we might see you that we might know you whom to know is life eternal. &gt;&gt; Father, thy will I pray be done. &gt;&gt; Thy perfect will &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could just sing I don't have the number. Open my eyes that I may see uh truth thou hast for me. Glimpses of truth thou hast for me. I pray earnestly. I'm asking God. I came to the pulpit today with great desire in my heart that God will minister to you precious people. each one and we may we may have within our minds that this is my need or this is my need. I can tell you the answer to every need is to see to see what he wants you to see. And if you look at that and look on him, your answer is certain. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So let's sing this prayerfully. Open my eyes that I may see. Open my eyes that I may see glimpses of truth. Thou hast for me. Place in my hand the wonder that shall unclass and set me free. Silently bell I wait for thee. Be my God I will to see. Open my eyes [Music] if I verse three. Please open my mouth. Open my mouth and let me gladly truth everywhere. Oh my [Music] love with my children. to share silently now. I wait for thee. Raise my heart. Thy will to see. Open my eyes and illuminate. [Music] If I I want to sing a verse or two also of it is well with my soul. And if I could redirect your vision a wee bit this morning or perhaps turn it completely, I'd like to turn your vision from being so completely consumed or occupied with this passing world because it's going to pass away. We have to deal with it. We have to work. We have these burdens. We have those things. But we need to keep our eyes fixed, friends, upon a goal. I don't want to I don't want to diminish the message this morning. We need this desperately. &gt;&gt; This congregation needs it desperately. Believers today need it desperately. [Music] &gt;&gt; Not that it means anything to you. I was supposed to be in Edmonton this morning and preach and I felt I needed to be here &gt;&gt; and this was the message and quite frankly I was 90% probably 75 80 90% through with another message. I felt certain I was to speak that message and midweek this last week just God just turned it right corners and dropped this in preach this and I can tell you friends I didn't probably get any more than halfway through. I tell you in the name of the Lord this message is for this congregation this morning. And if you're here visiting it's for you. If you're on the internet streaming, if you happen to get on by accident, it's not an accident. &gt;&gt; This message is for all who heard it today. We need our vision turned, our eyes turned off of this onto him, not him of history, him of the resurrected Christ of this day, who's glorified himself. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just heard this last week the about the author of this song, When Peace Like a River. I guess many of you know it. Someone sent us a DVD and we saw a little bit of his life. This man became a wealthy man in Chicago and they had four daughters and a son and his baby son was taken in scarlet fever I believe it was and died as an infant and broke his heart. It was his only son. And then I believe he was actually away and the great fire of Chicago which burned a big part of the city. He had vast holdings of real estate and his holdings were lost in this massive fire and he became almost like a penniless man. he lost all of his wealth and then he was a great friend of uh I believe Dwight Moody or one of the great ministers of the past and a great supporter and there were meetings taking place in England and he decided that he and his whole family would go and he booked a he booked a a cruise on a on a big ship and just before they were to go he was called for some very very important meetings that he couldn't miss and he had to go and attend to these meetings a very important I think it had something to do with the loss of his property and so he he was insistent that his wife and children go and that the ship that they were on was broadsided by another ship and it sunk in 12 minutes and he lost he lost his four beautiful daughters all upgrowing women now. And his wife was found sometime later clinging to a some debris and they flew her to England and uh and she wrote a note to her husband and just said saved alone. [Music] And the commentator was saying it's just it's impossible to comprehend the grief and the depths of sorrow and disappointment. But he said his anchor was steadfast. &gt;&gt; Loss of all five children almost his wife and lost his entire livelihood and his possessions. [Music] And he penned these words. When peace like a river attendeth my soul, when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot, thou has taught me to say, &gt;&gt; it is well, it is well with my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friends, it makes me feel small. I intend to see this man. I intend to shake his hand. I tend to tell him this song was one of the great anthems of our church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it sound it rung true to the lives of the people. Is it your anthem? &gt;&gt; Does it have something special for you? Let's sing it together, please. Life of attend my way. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] is well with my soul.

[Music] &gt;&gt; These words cost a man, his family. I can't imagine it. Cost him almost everything. And I hope this doesn't sound out of place, but I'm thankful that he gave a song to the world that we can identify with. And I pray God, give each of you as we enter this week of camp, give you a true vision. Just say, God, give me your sight. Give me your vision. Give me your eyesight. Anoint my eyes with eyesight. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you and God bless you. Thank you for your prayers and thank you for being so attentive this morning. Really appreciate it. Brother Tom, would you come? I don't Did they make that announcement for the counselors just after right there? quickly after we dismiss if I can meet everybody in the fellowship room that will be counselors this year at the Bible way camp and we'll have a quick meeting and we'll send you on your way. Let's pray. Lord, [Music] how often have been our prayers over the years? Show us the Father, &gt;&gt; and this would suffice us, Lord, to see your glory, to see your unveiling, to see the manifestation of your word within our lives. That's what we crave for. That's what we long for. [Music] As I heard this morning, Lord, we've got one claim left. We want to go home with you. &gt;&gt; Let not your heart be troubled, for I've gone to prepare a place for you, Lord. What a place that is. What a blessed hope. What a blessed promise. And that's what we live for, Lord, to put on this rapture change. And we've heard the shout, Lord. We're hearing the voice of the resurrection. Lord, we want that great trump to sound. catch this waiting bride away. And Lord, any wrongs, make them right within our lives, Lord. But we could humble ourselves before the throne of grace and say, "Lord, have your divine will and way within all of our lives, with on all our hearts." Lord, we want to look into this glorious mirror and say, "Mirror, mirror of your word, Lord. We want to become what we hear." And we just pray, God, that you'll open our eyes to see more of your glory, our ears to hear what the spirit would say. Lord, we want to get caught up with you, with this word, with this unveiling, with this immorphy of God that we might display this bride form that you have called us to display. We've heard a blessed word, Lord. May we not lose it with conversation, but may we be like Mary pondering this word of God. And that, Father, that as we ponder it and meditate on it, Lord, this is why you've sent it that it would manifest and change our very lives. Go with us, Lord. And as we've been praying for this camp, for our young people, for our children, that they could get caught up in the spirit of revelation that might they might know you in the power of your resurrection. We pray for every counselor, Lord. We pray for the meetings. We pray, God, you will give us the mind of Christ. We thank you for this gathering this morning. We thank you for a pastor this morning. We thank you for a man of God that can hear from the throne of grace and thunder forth the thought of God. We pray you'll strengthen him, Lord. And may this word change us. Go with your people. And Brother Lance will be ministering in Seattle. Anoint the man of God. We pray. Brother DDA is recovering from his operation. Strengthen him, we ask. Lord, be with your children as we will be with one another this afternoon. May you be glorified in all that we say and do. Go with your children now. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. Greet one another. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Happy [Music] New Year. Hey, hey, hey. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Do you care? [Music] Hey, hey, hey. [Music]
