[1:16] on Sunday which was the next day after
[1:22] the soldier boy had been called out I
[1:25] was once again on the platform and they
[1:30] had a prayer line and in that prayer
[1:34] line came a woman
[1:36] well well-known to us she was a very
[1:40] dear friend of my parents and I knew her
[1:44] very well her name was sister Clint her
[1:49] husband they didn't have any children
[1:51] that I know of her husband was a very
[1:54] stout man and I don't know what he what
[1:58] he actually did for a living but I
[2:00] believe you worked in the agricultural
[2:02] department from what we have found out
[2:04] since and so she came up and she just
[2:09] standing and brother branham says now
[2:14] here is a lady and he begins to speak
[2:17] and he said you're very nervous he said
[2:23] and you have other complications other
[2:25] problems you have I think a spiritual
[2:29] problem as well and it begins to talk -
[2:32] he said yes you are very nervous he said
[2:36] I see you standing by a window when the
[2:40] Sun was setting and you're rubbing your
[2:45] hands and then he stops and he's
[2:50] speaking to her but he's also speaking
[2:53] to the congregation speaking to people
[2:57] like myself he's saying now and this it
[3:02] means so much to us now
[3:05] he said no who could do that what man
[3:10] could tell you where you were standing
[3:13] and what you were praying and he said
[3:16] and then you prayed that God would help
[3:20] you to get a prayer card and when that
[3:22] prayer card was given to you you were so
[3:25] happy very happy that you'd received a
[3:29] prayer card and he asked you know how
[3:34] how could a man know that he wanted the
[3:36] people to see that that was God and the
[3:40] Prophet the Prophet ministry for profit
[3:43] is a spokesman for God it was not just a
[3:47] gift of discernment it was not that but
[3:50] a lot of my friends were tended to
[3:54] believe that it was just maybe a gift of
[3:56] a word of knowledge or something it
[3:58] wasn't that he was in both worlds he was
[4:02] in another dimension and he told her
[4:04] where she was standing what her prayer
[4:07] was and how her reaction when she got
[4:11] the prayer card and then he said now he
[4:18] said lay it we'll just talk to the lady
[4:21] and he said you have something else no
[4:24] this is what was so striking to me said
[4:28] you have something else that's on your
[4:30] heart you're praying for a friend a man
[4:35] that's dying with cancer and they do not
[4:39] live and I noticed he said they do not
[4:43] live because it was him and his wife he
[4:46] said they do not live here
[4:48] they live in Fort st. John and I knew
[4:52] Fort Saint John was just 50 miles of the
[4:56] Alaskan Highway
[4:57] what brother branham did not know is we
[5:01] were going up the highway I was taking
[5:04] him early the next morning Monday
[5:06] morning up the highway and brother
[5:10] Branham was preaching on show us the
[5:13] father I thought it was so remarkable
[5:18] he was actually showing the people the
[5:21] father said who could tell you where you
[5:25] were standing when you prayed
[5:28] no one will Almighty God and that you're
[5:32] praying for a friend and he said these
[5:36] he's dying with cancer yes he said he's
[5:40] a sinner and he's dying with cancer
[5:45] mentioned it twice and he said only
[5:50] believe just believe that seemed to be
[5:53] the key he said take that handkerchief
[5:58] that you have and give it to him and
[6:01] he'll be well I guess she never did get
[6:05] it to him this was the end of May he
[6:08] passed away July the 6th of 1961 but of
[6:14] course I didn't know that we found that
[6:17] out many years later but the next day
[6:23] I'm in the car and you have to
[6:25] understand I had a lot of questions
[6:30] about brother Branham about his doctor
[6:34] and about his ministry but there was one
[6:38] thing that I knew that is the angel of
[6:41] the Lord was in attendance with him at
[6:44] the platform and now we were having a
[6:47] just profound effect upon me and other
[6:52] ministers and he said
[6:56] he said as we drove down the highway we
[7:01] started coming to the town of fort st.
[7:03] John which laid up to the right hand of
[7:06] the highway and there was an entrance
[7:09] into Fort st. John when the US Army cut
[7:13] just through the farmland the farmhouse
[7:17] was just up to the right maybe a hundred
[7:20] eight hundred and fifty yards and I had
[7:22] noticed that house so many times in my
[7:25] youth and childhood and just a big old
[7:29] white farmhouse and as brother branham
[7:33] as we he slowed down for the speed limit
[7:38] and were just driving slowly he said
[7:43] there was a woman that came in the
[7:46] prayer line yesterday praying for a man
[7:48] from Fort st. John Oh
[7:51] I said brother branham she's a very good
[7:55] friend of my parents her name is sister
[7:58] Flint and I know her well and and I knew
[8:01] her I was there on the platform and she
[8:05] was standing there and he was telling
[8:08] her these things now here we are driving
[8:11] and the house is just over here to my
[8:14] right and he said he'd just serious he
[8:19] he it was in a different frame of mind
[8:22] you'd say and he just said as we were
[8:27] driving past the hope was going by so he
[8:30] swung his arm this way and pointed
[8:32] behind my head he said the man is in
[8:35] that house well I was shocked I was
[8:41] startled but I didn't know that the man
[8:43] was in that house I didn't know his name
[8:45] or anything and we we continued on the
[8:51] road up to Fort Nelson and beyond up to
[8:55] brother bud southwest place brother bud
[8:59] Southworth was just a new new Christian
[9:03] he had been saved in my church
[9:08] about a year before I was so anxious to
[9:11] acquaint him with spiritual things he
[9:15] was just uh he was raised horses and he
[9:19] rolled in in the rodeos and things and
[9:24] so he didn't know anything he didn't
[9:26] know Genesis from Revelation he just
[9:29] didn't know the Bible so I wonder
[9:31] acquaint him with what a prophet was I
[9:34] said when we went by that house I said
[9:39] brother branham pointed to it and said
[9:41] the man is in that house I said you know
[9:44] sister Clint she was on the platform
[9:46] praying for him and and by the South
[9:51] wake my friend he said oh I know him he
[9:55] said his name is Ed Thomas I've known
[9:58] him ever since I've been over eight
[9:59] years old and so now I had it on the
[10:03] platform on the highway and with brother
[10:08] South wait this was all within 24 hours
[10:12] it was like just a divine intervention
[10:17] of God saying I will cause you to
[10:20] believe I will bring it right in front
[10:24] of you I will bring it it was so
[10:27] arranged I just could not doubt it I
[10:30] guess it was the grace of God to me that
[10:36] was anchoring my faith and I just
[10:39] couldn't there was one day and the next
[10:42] day and the next day and I do not know
[10:45] whether it was in that particular
[10:47] service or brother branham spoke and all
[10:53] of the service was not taped apparently
[10:56] but anyway I was standing and I'll never
[10:59] forget this I was standing on the
[11:01] platform right beside me on my right
[11:05] hand side was standing brother Paul
[11:08] cornish the pastor in the church in
[11:12] Grand Prairie and he was he was just
[11:15] standing here as a very
[11:17] taller than I was here very dignified
[11:21] very scholarly and a man that didn't
[11:26] show a lot of emotion but he was
[11:29] standing there and brother Brendan was
[11:31] facing not facing us he had his back to
[11:35] us and to the prayer line was going down
[11:38] the wall this time and up this way and
[11:43] why were just standing there brother
[11:46] branham I can't explain this this is so
[11:49] strange
[11:49] but he just lifted his head this way and
[11:52] cried out the boilbee all right
[11:56] and a force went by me it was like a
[12:01] wind but it wasn't a wind it was just a
[12:05] power of force just went by me but I was
[12:08] conscious of it and I was bewildered I
[12:11] don't know what's happening the boy will
[12:13] be all right and Paul cornish brother
[12:17] Paul cornish collapses over and is in
[12:23] convulsing tears and I don't know what's
[12:27] happening here he's the voice the force
[12:30] is also unusual while he's just talking
[12:33] to somebody in front of him and and and
[12:38] here's brother Paul Cornish what do you
[12:42] do when somebody's you know crying and
[12:44] kill volsce I didn't know whether to
[12:45] pray with him or what to do
[12:47] then he straightened up after he
[12:51] collected himself he nudged me and he
[12:55] said brother Eddie he said you see down
[12:58] the prayer line towards the end he said
[13:01] young lad that's standing there he said
[13:05] that's my son and he's up for a serious
[13:08] operation next week and to have to have
[13:14] those kind of things I I just became
[13:16] aware of another realm I became aware of
[13:19] another place another dimension this man
[13:24] was not just ministering to the people
[13:26] but it was like he was he was in contact
[13:30] with another world the boy will be
[13:32] alright and he just continues on and I I
[13:37] don't know anything of the lad what
[13:40] happened after that but I that was just
[13:43] a very very strange and very unusual
[13:47] event for me
