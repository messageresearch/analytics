[3:48] and not wonder if he is going to stand
[3:50] here with us this evening. For we know
[3:52] with an assurityity that he is here.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Why don't we turn the screen to 266.
[3:58] Come to my soul, precious Jesus. Is it
[4:01] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[4:03] evening? Want to greet each and every
[4:04] one of you that have come this evening
[4:06] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:08] Those on the internet hookup, we trust
[4:10] that you'll be blessed by the service
[4:12] this evening. Who knows what the Lord
[4:14] has in store tonight? Just an ordinary
[4:16] service on a Wednesday night? I don't
[4:18] believe it. Not an ounce. Our God is a
[4:22] supernatural God.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; We might be a natural people, but we're
[4:25] just supernatural beings, like brother
[4:27] Ernie will say,
[4:29] having a natural experience.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thought when you can
[4:36] just catch it just for a second that
[4:39] you're eternal.
[4:41] Hold on to it because it'll go away just
[4:43] as quick as it shows up. We can hold on
[4:46] to it though. I believe it.
[4:48] Let's sing it together.
[5:00] Come to my soul.
[5:02] Oh, come to my soul.
[5:06] Precious Jesus,
[5:09] my Lord.
[5:11] Oh, hear me, oh Savior
[5:16] divine.
[5:18] He's the divine one.
[5:20] Open
[5:22] the fountain
[5:25] and cleanse me,
[5:28] Lord, and give me a heart
[5:34] like thine. Let's all stand on our feet
[5:36] and sing it as an anthem. Oh, won't you
[5:38] come to my soul,
[5:42] precious Jesus,
[5:45] my Lord,
[5:48] hear me, oh Savior.
[5:55] [Music]
[5:57] Open
[5:58] that fountain
[6:01] and bless me,
[6:04] Lord, and give me, oh, a heart
[6:10] like thine. Oh, won't you come to my
[6:13] soul? Come to my soul,
[6:18] precious Jesus,
[6:21] my Lord.
[6:24] Hear me, oh Savior
[6:28] divine,
[6:32] and open
[6:34] the fountain
[6:37] and bless me,
[6:40] Lord.
[6:42] Give me a heart
[6:46] like thine.
[6:48] [Music]
[6:53] I don't want nothing here to hinder me.
[7:01] Amen. Would you desire that nothing
[7:03] hinder you tonight from entering into
[7:05] his courts? Praise and thanksgiving on
[7:08] your lips. Amen. How many would just
[7:10] pray as we sing this song? Lord, don't
[7:13] let me hinder this service. And if we
[7:16] individually can do that, commit it to
[7:18] the Lord. I believe that he'll have his
[7:20] perfect will and his perfect way.
[7:26] I don't want
[7:29] nothing here to hinder me.
[7:35] For some is blessed.
[7:40] I want to see.
[7:44] It makes no difference
[7:47] on the cross
[7:49] or how heavy
[7:52] the cross.
[7:54] I don't want
[7:56] nothing here to hinder me.
[8:01] [Music]
[8:02] Oh, I don't want
[8:05] nothing here to hinder me.
[8:12] For someday his blessed face I want to
[8:17] see.
[8:20] It makes no difference what the cross
[8:25] or how heavy
[8:28] the cross.
[8:30] I don't want
[8:32] nothing here to hinder me. Let's all
[8:36] just lay it at his feet as we sing it
[8:38] again. I don't want
[8:41] nothing here to hinder me.
[8:46] [Music]
[8:48] for someday. His blessed face I want to
[8:53] see.
[8:54] [Applause]
[8:56] It makes no difference
[8:59] what the cost. Oh, how heavy
[9:03] the cross.
[9:06] I don't want
[9:08] nothing here to hinder me.
[9:14] For the more that I surrender,
[9:20] the lighter
[9:23] my Lord,
[9:24] [Music]
[9:26] the more that I release my care, the
[9:32] more you take control,
[9:37] the more that I can humble myself,
[9:43] the Lord, you lift me up.
[9:47] Every day I live. Oh Lord, I love you
[9:53] more.
[9:58] Oh, the more that I surrender. You want
[10:03] to surrender, Father?
[10:05] Lord, your yoke is easy and your burden
[10:08] is light. The more that I release my
[10:13] cares,
[10:15] the more you take control.
[10:19] Oh, the more that I can humble myself,
[10:26] the more you lift me up.
[10:30] Every day I live.
[10:34] Lord, I love you more.
[10:38] What a great reality as we sing it
[10:40] again. Oh, the more that I surrender.
[10:47] The lighter
[10:49] my Lord,
[10:52] the more that I
[10:57] know the more he takes control.
[11:02] Oh, the more that I can humble myself,
[11:08] the more you lift me up.
[11:12] Every day I live,
[11:16] Lord. I love you, Lord.
[11:23] Hallelujah.
[11:25] Hallelujah. Lord, if we could just grasp
[11:28] just that one reality this evening that
[11:30] if we would just surrender, we would
[11:33] just surrender,
[11:35] Lord, and humble ourselves
[11:37] to what you would have for us this
[11:39] evening. Father,
[11:42] we desire to hear from your throne of
[11:44] grace once more.
[11:46] Hallelujah.
[11:48] Hallelujah. Let's sing number 301 on the
[11:52] screen.
[11:53] He has forgiven me. Keep sing
[12:03] for
[12:05] me. Oh my sins
[12:08] have been washed
[12:10] from his family.
[12:14] By the blood of the lamb
[12:19] of Calary.
[12:22] I know that he
[12:26] hasn't forgiven you tonight. Oh, can you
[12:28] just lift your hands and sing it?
[12:31] He
[12:33] has
[12:35] forgive
[12:37] me.
[12:39] I see how he was from his
[12:49] [Music]
[12:51] [Applause]
[12:54] [Music]
[12:59] fore.
[13:02] I know that he Yes, he has

[13:40] presence.
[13:42] Hallelujah. What a blessed What a
[13:45] blessed opportunity it is to stand in
[13:47] your presence, Lord.
[13:50] Hallelujah.
[13:51] [Music]
[13:52] Hallelujah.
[13:54] [Music]
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your wonderful name, Lord
[13:57] Jesus.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; May you be high and lifted up, Father.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to your wonderful name, Lord.
[14:06] Lord, we know that you dwell in the
[14:08] praises of your people, Father.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to stand here this
[14:12] evening, Lord, crying back to you,
[14:15] Father. The one who has redeemed us, the
[14:18] one who has brought us out.
[14:21] Lord, certainly we aren't sad. Certainly
[14:23] we aren't downcast in our position. For
[14:27] Lord, we are being brought back to that
[14:29] perfect Eden beauty once again.
[14:32] Hallelujah.
[14:34] Hallelujah. What a blessed thought,
[14:36] Lord. What a blessed hope you have given
[14:39] us, Father.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How we love you, Father. How
[14:46] we love your appearing, Lord.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; How we love your dealings, Lord Jesus.
[14:51] How that you would even come down this
[14:53] evening, speak to us, Lord, even lift to
[14:57] ear as you spoke to your prophets of
[14:59] old. Father,
[15:01] Lord, you have given us a pastor whom
[15:03] you said you would speak to, whom you
[15:06] said would be able to deliver the words
[15:08] of life to us once more. That you would
[15:11] dwell not just with us, Lord, but even
[15:14] in us to the end of the world.
[15:18] Hallelu
[15:21] Hallelujah.
[15:23] What a blessed savior we have. Blessed
[15:26] redeemer.
[15:28] All is at rest
[15:31] and the life seems full of turmoil.
[15:37] Sure, the boat that Peter was standing
[15:38] on and the other disciples was a great
[15:41] turmoil,
[15:43] but Peter said, "Lord, bid me to come."
[15:46] All the other disciples may be standing
[15:48] back a little bit. What is Peter
[15:50] thinking?
[15:52] Would you be one tonight? Lord, bid me
[15:54] to come. Bid me to step out of the boat,
[15:57] Lord. I think if we could each come to
[16:00] that place in our experience.
[16:03] Lord, I'm tired of standing back amongst
[16:05] the other 12 and just kind of blending
[16:07] in. Let me step out.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Let me reach out and touch the hem of
[16:11] your garment this evening. Let me be the
[16:13] one that can touch you on behalf of the
[16:16] prayer requests that are being read
[16:17] tonight.
[16:20] With that in mind, we want to go to
[16:21] prayer this evening. We've got several
[16:23] requests to let you know about. I'm
[16:26] going to ask brother Ernie. Brother
[16:28] Ernie, if you'd come and lead us in
[16:29] prayer, take these requests before the
[16:32] throne of grace.
[16:35] We've got a request from Brother Roy,
[16:36] Sister Judy, and family. It's quite
[16:39] lengthy and I haven't read it, so I'm
[16:41] just going to try and read the the
[16:44] entire request to you. Please pray for
[16:47] my sister Joy Nelson and family. This
[16:50] morning, she received a call from
[16:51] Jamaica informing her that her husband
[16:53] Earl passed away suddenly.
[16:56] We don't know if the details We don't
[16:58] know of the details at present. He left
[17:00] for Jamaica a few days ago to inquire
[17:03] about his dad's sudden passing and to
[17:05] make necessary arrangements. The family
[17:07] planned to leave next week and go and
[17:09] was informed about the tragedy. Please
[17:12] pray that the Lord will give my sister
[17:14] strength, comfort, and peace
[17:17] and his protecting hands will lead her.
[17:20] May the Lord have his divine will and
[17:22] way. God bless.
[17:25] We want to remember that need tonight.
[17:28] Sister Lori has a request that we pray
[17:30] for a complete healing for Sister
[17:33] Leverne Clemens
[17:35] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[17:37] Claiming it and believing. Want to
[17:39] remember
[17:40] a request for Jean. She's been diagnosed
[17:43] with kidney cancer that has spread to
[17:46] her lungs.
[17:48] Sister Rachel Russell request that we
[17:50] pray for her mom. She is at home with a
[17:52] heart problem and the flu.
[17:57] Another request to pray for a man named
[17:59] Kenneth Carroll. He's battling cancer
[18:02] paralyzation.
[18:05] It's from Brother Mark. Amen. If you
[18:07] have a need on your heart tonight, maybe
[18:09] you didn't make it to write it down on a
[18:11] piece of paper, but the very one that
[18:14] knows the thoughts of our hearts,
[18:17] the intents of our hearts is here this
[18:19] evening. I believe if you raise your
[18:21] hand in faith believing tonight, he'll
[18:24] honor your request as we go to prayer.
[18:26] Brother Ernie,
[18:28] [Music]
[18:32] &gt;&gt; let's bow our heads.
[18:43] Father, we come together as a body
[18:46] tonight,
[18:48] Lord, a people that you have called into
[18:51] an eternal reality.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are transdimensional travelers.
[18:57] We live in this natural world, but Lord,
[19:00] we're most at home when we are in the
[19:01] presence of God. Knowing that there are
[19:04] supernatural beings all around us, oh
[19:06] God, and knowing that when the body of
[19:10] Christ comes together, each one with
[19:13] their lick of fire, Lord God, all things
[19:16] are possible, Lord.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; God, we we desire to come into that
[19:20] unity of the faith, Lord, where not a
[19:22] single not a single one of the enemy,
[19:24] Lord, would have any effect upon this
[19:27] body, Lord. They would run from the
[19:29] presence of God.
[19:32] Father, we have these grave requests
[19:35] that have been put before us, but Lord,
[19:38] we have the confidence that you have
[19:41] given your bride a peace that passes all
[19:43] understanding and a peace that comes in
[19:46] the midst of the storm. And Lord, not
[19:48] one of these needs that is here present
[19:52] took you by surprise, Lord. And Lord,
[19:55] you have given us a confidence that when
[19:57] we pray that you hear us. And Lord, that
[20:00] you answer every prayer.
[20:03] And Lord, we're lifting up brother
[20:05] Royy's family. Oh God. Lord, for the
[20:08] sudden departure of this family member
[20:11] over in Jamaica, God. Lord, I pray that
[20:14] as the family gathers, I pray that you
[20:16] would be in their midst. I pray the
[20:18] right words would be spoken. I pray Lord
[20:21] that it would bring them face to face
[20:22] with the reality Lord that that we are
[20:26] but transient beings here on this earth
[20:29] Lord. We're here today and gone
[20:31] tomorrow. And Lord, it can come just in
[20:33] a heartbeat. So Lord, we pray that you'd
[20:36] bless brother Roy and Sister Judy, Lord,
[20:39] that however they communicate with their
[20:41] family, oh God, that they would have the
[20:43] right words to say to ease their hearts,
[20:46] oh God. Lord, we pray for Sister Leverne
[20:49] tonight that you would give her a
[20:51] complete healing, oh God. Lord, such a
[20:54] faithful sister with always with a joy
[20:56] in her heart and always with a a radiant
[20:59] countenance, oh Father. Lord, we thank
[21:01] you for for for women of God like this,
[21:04] oh God. Women that know how to get in
[21:06] the prayer closet, Lord. And now, Lord,
[21:08] we want to get in our prayer closet,
[21:10] Lord, and want to lift her up. And Lord,
[21:13] for Sister Rachel's mom, we pray that
[21:15] you would minister to her. We pray that
[21:17] you would just move into that room where
[21:19] she is right now. No doubt, Father, she
[21:22] is knowing that the the saints will be
[21:24] praying for her. Let her receive it,
[21:27] Lord. Let her receive that channel of
[21:29] inspiration and revelation, Lord, that
[21:31] by your stripes, she is healed.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; And Lord, for this this man, uh, Kenneth
[21:37] Carol battling cancer and paralyzation.
[21:41] Oh, God, I pray that that you would just
[21:43] neutralize the spread of this disease. I
[21:46] pray that you would annihilate it, Lord.
[21:49] If the man is not a Christian, Lord, I
[21:51] pray that he would call out to God for
[21:53] salvation of his soul, oh God. And Lord,
[21:56] for the healing of his body, Lord, we
[21:58] lift them up. We believe that you can do
[22:00] all things. We've seen you do it so many
[22:03] times before, Father.
[22:07] [Music]
[22:11] And Father, for
[22:15] for Jean, who has been diagnosed with
[22:18] kidney cancer that has spread to her
[22:20] lungs. Lord, we don't know if this is a
[22:24] believer or an unbeliever. We don't know
[22:26] if it's one of the body of Christ. But
[22:29] Lord, a petition has come to us. And
[22:33] Lord, as your your body of Christ, Lord,
[22:36] with a spirit like Abraham had on him to
[22:39] do everything that he could to redeem
[22:41] the foolish virgin. And Lord, when he
[22:44] did all that he could, Melzdc met him
[22:47] and fed him bread and wine. So Lord, we
[22:49] have that same desire, oh God, to reach
[22:51] out to one and all. Lord, maybe they
[22:54] might not be the bride, but maybe
[22:55] something that is said or something that
[22:57] is put into their hands would give them
[22:59] faith, would give them understanding,
[23:01] would give them a knowledge when future
[23:04] events take place, oh God, that they
[23:06] would not step into the place where they
[23:08] would take the mark of the beast, but
[23:10] they would stand fast for the faith that
[23:12] has been imparted to them. Lord, she has
[23:15] sent her prayer request to the right
[23:17] place, Lord. And we know that you are
[23:19] ready, willing, and able, oh God, to
[23:21] hear and to answer every petition. And
[23:24] now, Lord, for for the man of God that
[23:26] would come and stand behind the sacred
[23:28] desk. We pray, Lord, that you would give
[23:30] him an anointing, a liberty, a freedom,
[23:33] oh God, to enter right into that that
[23:35] channel that you that you have placed
[23:37] his heart in. Let him deliver the word,
[23:40] Father, with a holy a holy anointing.
[23:43] and let we be ready to receive it, Lord,
[23:46] and to to act upon it and let the word
[23:49] become manifest in our life. We ask all
[23:51] these blessings in your precious name,
[23:54] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[23:58] Amen. God bless you saints. As you have
[24:00] your seats, want to
[24:04] have the choir come and get ready.
[24:05] They've got a special force this
[24:07] evening.
[24:08] As they come, we want to just greet each
[24:10] and every one of you again. the name of
[24:12] our Lord Jesus Christ. Those on the
[24:14] internet hook up with us to say God
[24:16] bless you to you as well. Perhaps we can
[24:19] sing
[24:21] uh number 427.
[24:24] He's alive and well.
[24:27] Amen. Is he alive and well in your heart
[24:30] tonight? Amen. Doesn't it give you a
[24:32] great joy to be in the sanctuary of his
[24:34] people? I wasn't able to be here on
[24:36] Sunday. We were down in Seattle
[24:37] following a wedding and the service is
[24:39] down there. So, we were streaming Sunday
[24:42] morning. We missed being here and to
[24:45] walk into the sanctuary this evening. It
[24:47] was
[24:49] very nice to be here and to see all of
[24:51] your faces. Let's just sing it together.
[24:55] He's alive
[24:57] and well, living in me
[25:02] to tell the world
[25:06] that he is the same.
[25:12] He's the same yesterday,
[25:16] today,
[25:18] and forever.
[25:21] Jesus is alive
[25:24] and well. Let's sing it again.
[25:28] He's alive
[25:30] and well
[25:33] [Applause]
[25:34] to
[25:36] the world.
[25:39] And he is the same.
[25:44] He's the same yesterday,
[25:48] today.
[25:50] and forever.
[25:53] Jesus is alive
[25:57] and
[25:59] [Music]
[26:03] I've had this song on my heart probably
[26:06] since uh just after camp and we're
[26:08] finally getting to it. But um I was just
[26:12] thinking about Jesus walked into the
[26:14] temple and he took the scroll from
[26:16] Isaiah and he read his allotted portion
[26:19] and he said, "This day the scriptur is
[26:21] fulfilled in your ears." We're going to
[26:23] sing, I will restore, sayeth the Lord, a
[26:25] song we've done here before, but I was
[26:28] just thinking what God did for us and
[26:30] our young people at camp. And I'm just
[26:33] thankful that he said he would restore
[26:37] and and this is the time that he's
[26:39] fulfilling that in our lives and in our
[26:42] congregation.
[26:44] And one of the lines of the chorus says
[26:47] Jehovah promised the Holy Ghost promise.
[26:50] And that's for us as well in this
[26:51] season. So I just hope this song is an
[26:54] encouragement to the young people and to
[26:56] everybody here. Just enter in as we
[26:58] sing. And um I pray that it'll be a
[27:00] blessing.
[27:09] [Music]
[27:19] [Music]
[27:26] bright.
[27:28] [Music]
[27:30] Now, do you remember
[27:35] way back to your former rain
[27:41] where you
[27:46] Oh, you stood in position
[27:51] having dominion and all things under
[27:54] your feet.
[27:57] Oh, but you're f
[28:01] Yes, you did. You fell from that
[28:05] fellowship
[28:07] and you wonder, "Lord, where I went
[28:12] wrong."
[28:13] [Music]
[28:14] So you cry and you cry and you cry out.
[28:20] You thirst for that latter rain.
[28:24] And then you fight for the power again.
[28:33] You see the palmer worm came in your
[28:37] life.
[28:39] Then the candle worm came in your life.
[28:46] Then the caterpillar and
[28:50] the saint. But God promised.
[28:54] Yes, he promised. I will restore
[29:01] the Lord.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; You chase him
[29:09] and believe it.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; My God,
[29:14] &gt;&gt; it's a holy promise.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[29:22] [Music]
[29:25] I will restore
[29:28] the Lord.
[29:30] [Music]
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Now power
[29:36] shall come from on high
[29:40] after the Holy Ghost. It comes upon you
[29:46] and you shall be witnesses
[29:49] [Music]
[29:52] unto me throughout this world.
[29:56] Oh my glory all men shall behold
[30:02] for I shall come.
[30:06] Oh yes, I have. Unto you as the former
[30:11] rain,
[30:13] and as the latter rain, to you shall I
[30:17] come, and all men shall know
[30:24] that you have the evidence.
[30:29] Oh, that my Jesus, he rose from the
[30:33] dead.
[30:37] And in your own
[30:44] God will visit you there.
[30:50] For you are meant to be mighty.
[30:56] [Applause]
[31:06] It's the holy
[31:11] I'm going to keep my word.
[31:16] I cannot
[31:23] restore
[31:25] the Lord. I will restore
[31:29] myself.
[31:32] And in your own atmosphere
[31:45] meant to be a mighty churchy mighty
[31:54] pro.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[32:00] I'm going to restore.
[32:05] I'm going to keep
[32:08] all the promise. The Holy Ghost promise.
[32:14] I will restore.
[32:18] [Music]
[32:20] And I will restore.
[32:23] Resto.
[32:27] I will restore.
[32:30] Say the Lord.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; I die.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; I will resto
[32:40] my
[32:42] promise.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I receive it.
[32:46] I will restore.
[32:50] Thus said the Lord.
[32:53] I will restore.
[32:56] Bless the Lord.
[32:59] I will restore
[33:04] the Lord.
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that chorus once more as
[33:15] they're having their seats.
[33:18] I will restore
[33:21] [Applause]
[33:22] the Lord.
[33:24] I will restore
[33:29] [Music]
[33:41] the Lord.
[33:43] I will
[33:47] say the Lord.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Takes the human element right out of it,
[33:54] doesn't it?
[33:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will restore."
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Not, "I'll give you 50% and I'll take
[33:59] 50%."
[34:01] &gt;&gt; No, he said, "I will restore."
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're going to invite
[34:04] our brother Biscll to come. Our pastor
[34:07] Amen. How many would like our pastor to
[34:09] take his liberty tonight?
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel that just preach what's on
[34:14] his heart. Amen. We don't want to, you
[34:17] know, Well, I'll give the rest of it to
[34:19] you on Sunday. We just like both
[34:20] barrels. How would you like that
[34:22] tonight?
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would too. Amen. As our pastor
[34:26] comes, let's sing together. I believe
[34:28] he's coming back like he said. 359.
[34:34] I believe he's coming back like he said.
[34:43] I believe the trumpet's going to sound
[34:46] so loud. It'll resurrect
[34:49] the dead.
[34:52] Oh my
[34:54] god.
[34:56] [Music]
[35:05] [Music]
[35:20] Oh
[35:23] my
[35:26] god.
[35:28] [Music]
[35:49] Yeah. Heat.
[36:00] Yeah.
[36:03] Heat.
[36:06] [Music]
[36:15] Oh,
[36:39] heat, heat.
[36:52] Amen.
[36:53] God bless you. Nice to hear your
[36:56] singing. Nice to hear the worship, the
[36:58] prayer, brother Ernie. We appreciate
[37:00] that. And uh above all things now, the
[37:04] most important thing is the word.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; So much we could be saying. We uh
[37:12] happy to be kind of back in the house of
[37:15] God.
[37:17] How many enjoyed Sunday?
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Our brother
[37:21] brother Gido
[37:23] and the congregation uh gave a very
[37:27] gracious gift for the work for the work
[37:30] in Siberia to our brother Giddo. It was
[37:34] uh $6,137.
[37:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[37:46] I asked our brother Gido to inform us
[37:49] from time to time uh just what it was
[37:53] that we were able to share in. I always
[37:55] like to know what we're doing, you know,
[37:58] and I said, if you're able to bring, you
[38:00] know, some of these young children that
[38:02] have become young men, young women,
[38:04] bring them to a convention or uh
[38:07] whatever need they may have or some
[38:10] widow that uh needs food or whatever and
[38:14] and especially the the children in the
[38:17] orphanage. I thought it was really
[38:19] remarkable.
[38:20] Something that uh I too
[38:24] appreciate. It's it's been such a uh
[38:27] combined effort by quite a few people.
[38:30] Uh some of that offering actually was
[38:33] from uh sent over from men of vision
[38:37] because there's a cost to transfer money
[38:40] $25 $30 at a time. So rather than send
[38:43] over a small or smaller amount or when
[38:46] you get a check, you don't want to take
[38:48] that kind of funds off. So they just
[38:50] combined it with with ours. And uh but
[38:54] the the most of it I can say came from
[38:56] the church here. Uh and
[39:00] you know what's really wonderful is that
[39:01] there's no pull. You don't have to have
[39:04] any gimmicks. You don't have to play any
[39:07] games. You just say, you know, here it
[39:09] is. Here's the brother and he's
[39:11] presented. He hasn't even presented any
[39:13] need. He just said what is happening and
[39:16] do we want to be a part and then then
[39:18] you respond. It's always been that way
[39:21] and uh how I appreciate the
[39:23] congregation. Appreciate you. And I also
[39:26] want to thank you just while you're
[39:27] still standing for your prayers while we
[39:30] were in in China. I said a little bit
[39:33] about it last Sunday. Those of you that
[39:34] weren't here, I won't repeat everything.
[39:36] I will just say that uh spending some
[39:39] time with brother Murphy and knowing
[39:41] that brother Tony had been there to uh
[39:44] quite a number of the places and now
[39:46] brother Murphy is going to some of the
[39:48] other cities and I know that they're in
[39:49] close contact all together he and
[39:52] brother Tony and now don't get confused
[39:54] when I talk about the other brother Tony
[39:55] which is Murphy's brother in China and
[39:59] uh pray for them especially they they
[40:02] are at they are at a decision time right
[40:04] now and They accept this as as truth.
[40:09] They know it's correct. You have to
[40:10] remember they don't have a church to go
[40:12] to. They don't have any fellowship. They
[40:15] don't have she doesn't have another
[40:17] sister and he doesn't have another
[40:19] brother. They don't have any other
[40:22] believers right in the area. There's a
[40:23] man that's moved there. Uh perhaps you
[40:25] know brother Tony from Singh. He just
[40:27] moved to Beijing. It's the only other
[40:29] brother that we know of. But now this
[40:32] brings me to another important point and
[40:34] that is the congregation here and when
[40:37] you have ministry and you when you're
[40:40] singing and when you're worshiping you
[40:42] just cannot imagine
[40:45] what that means to people such as Tony
[40:48] and Elen and others as they're able to
[40:51] stream or ar the archive services and
[40:54] sit there and hear it and be part of a
[40:57] place where they did sit and you just uh
[41:02] you need to really be in their situation
[41:05] and to realize now that uh there's
[41:09] people all over that nation that are
[41:12] able um especially in China, you know, I
[41:15] know it's many other places, but I think
[41:17] it's so marvelous that the internet
[41:19] services are able to go and we have a
[41:22] bit of a project in mind and if you if
[41:25] God will lay it on your heart to pray
[41:27] about it. Uh I asked brother Murphy,
[41:30] what is really a need as you've gone
[41:32] around to these places and you're you
[41:34] are you know you're part of this
[41:36] culture, you understand it like no one
[41:38] else. What do you find is really
[41:41] needful? And he said they need some
[41:45] method of being taught uh of how the
[41:49] message what the message actually was
[41:52] sent for what you know because they just
[41:54] hear of a message coming but they cannot
[41:57] overlay it like we do in in the time and
[42:01] and this is the end time and all of
[42:03] these things and they really need to
[42:06] have something. So, and I began to
[42:08] discuss with him the, you know, I made a
[42:11] banner years ago and took the Old
[42:13] Testament, the New Testament, the seven
[42:14] church ages, and all of these things,
[42:16] and we talked about developing that. And
[42:20] and uh so we're we're praying about
[42:22] something and making a a disc available
[42:25] because then you can just take a ma ma a
[42:27] master disc over there and they can
[42:28] duplicate them over there with no
[42:30] problem. And that would be very very
[42:32] valuable to them. So, we're we're we
[42:34] need to pray about these things. I
[42:36] believe that God blesses a church and a
[42:38] congregation and a people. He blesses
[42:41] you, your families, and you that work
[42:43] and you that give. He He blesses us as a
[42:46] congregation when we identify and see
[42:49] these needs and say, you know, I'll do
[42:51] what I can because little is much when
[42:54] God is in it. Amen. So, it's not some
[42:57] great big glamorous thing, but little is
[42:59] much. Whatever it is, be it small or be
[43:02] it great, uh it it's all great in God's
[43:06] hand. Isn't that right?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless our loaves and
[43:10] fishes.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you for standing. Turn to
[43:15] Timothy if you would. First Timothy
[43:28] and turn if you would please to chapter
[43:30] 6
[43:36] the 12th verse.
[43:50] fight the good fight of faith.
[43:53] Lay hold on eternal life where unto thou
[43:56] art called also called and hast
[43:59] professed a good profession before many
[44:03] witnesses. Would you read together that
[44:05] verse with me? Fight the good fight of
[44:09] faith. They hold on eternal life where
[44:13] unto thou art also called and hast
[44:16] professed a good profession before many
[44:20] witnesses. We'll bow our heads.
[44:23] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[44:26] we can say our father, you are our
[44:30] father. You have done and are doing and
[44:35] will continue to do so many many things
[44:39] innumerable. We cannot count them. We
[44:42] cannot even grasp, oh God, the greatness
[44:46] of your mercy, your longsuffering.
[44:50] Father, uh we are we are the recipients
[44:53] of such benefits that have come from you
[44:55] freely day after day. I pray you'll
[44:58] forgive us when we have failed to thank
[45:00] you for it. But tonight, we come and
[45:02] say, "Thank you, Lord, for all of these
[45:05] things that you've done and are doing.
[45:07] Thank you for salvation. Thank you for
[45:10] eternal life and the healing of the
[45:13] bodies. Oh God, thinking just now of
[45:15] Sister Marge Miller. Lord, how is she
[45:17] just continually on our hearts, her name
[45:20] on our lips, God? And father, we're
[45:23] we're praying that either you will
[45:24] receive her into your bosom or you'll
[45:26] return her back to our hearts, Lord. And
[45:29] will your will be done, oh God. Your
[45:31] will be done in the name of Jesus
[45:34] Christ. Glorify yourself, Lord. However
[45:38] you please to do it, but we leave her in
[45:41] your loving arms, oh God. And strengthen
[45:44] the family and encourage them, each one,
[45:46] oh God. And pray, Father, now you'll
[45:48] give us utterance. Lord, I pray you'll
[45:51] anoint my lips and my mind and you'll
[45:54] anoint the people, Father, and you'll
[45:56] give us such a blessed oneness, oh Lord,
[46:00] an atmosphere that you love to dwell in.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; We'll thank you in the name of Jesus
[46:06] Christ, our savior. Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[46:14] While I was away, I couldn't shake this
[46:19] phrase off my mind. And I began studying
[46:23] it even while we were in China.
[46:26] Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold
[46:30] on eternal life.
[46:32] Lay hold
[46:35] on eternal life. And I thought, you
[46:39] know, uh
[46:41] I was thinking of the overcoming and the
[46:45] circumstances that a person encounters
[46:49] in life. And it's important. It's not
[46:52] it's not beginning the race, friends.
[46:55] It's running to the end.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "They that endure to the
[47:00] end." And I've lived quite a long time
[47:03] and and served Christ and and seen
[47:07] thousands of believers. And as time has
[47:11] gone on, I've seen a lot of people
[47:13] start. Uh but I've seen a whole lot less
[47:16] keep running. And so it's not who
[47:19] starts, but it's who keeps on running.
[47:23] And I would sooner have somebody plot
[47:25] along than have a jack rabbit, you know,
[47:28] start out of the blocks and and play out
[47:30] in the first few hundred yards. I just
[47:33] sooner have the turtle that just keeps
[47:35] going on and on and on and on and and
[47:39] nothing changes. He just keeps going on.
[47:41] He's got a hard shell. Nothing really
[47:43] bothers him, you know. And if he stops,
[47:45] he just needs a little fire under him.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Get him going again.
[47:52] I was thinking of of this scripture,
[47:56] fight the good fight of faith. And we
[47:57] don't usually associate
[48:01] the word good with the word fight.
[48:05] Paul uses it twice. And he calls it a
[48:08] good fight. And I I I I was interested
[48:11] in that. What kind of fight is a good
[48:13] fight?
[48:15] &gt;&gt; What kind of fight is it can you term as
[48:17] being really a good fight? And he he
[48:21] said, "I have I have fought a good
[48:22] fight." He said, "I have finished my
[48:25] course and I have kept the faith." I
[48:28] just want to see what he was saying
[48:30] about that. And the good that he's using
[48:32] here that it's an excellent fight. It is
[48:36] a surpassing. It's useful. It's a
[48:40] suitable fight. This is a commendable
[48:42] fight and it's an admirable fight. This
[48:45] isn't something you feel disgraced about
[48:47] when you're done. You know, if you lose
[48:49] your temper and you do something or you
[48:51] react in a certain way or you have some
[48:53] kind of fight, be it verbal or whatever
[48:55] more, you can't walk away from it and
[48:58] feel good about it. But this fight
[49:00] Paul's talking about, it's a good fight.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And and you and you'll feel good about
[49:04] it. You'll feel good about every
[49:06] victory. And we don't often hear about a
[49:09] good fight, but this one's a good fight.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; It's an admirable fight. It's a very
[49:15] worthy fight.
[49:17] And this fight
[49:20] uh we can see with the word fight. I
[49:24] just I want to set the tenor of it. It
[49:27] is to strive or to labor fervently
[49:32] to enter a contest
[49:35] to contend.
[49:37] And Apostle Paul his whole, you can see
[49:41] his whole manner of writing,
[49:44] he had some fire
[49:46] &gt;&gt; in him,
[49:47] &gt;&gt; right? you see had some fire and he knew
[49:50] well something about
[49:53] uh uh you know competition
[49:56] running the race and some of this
[49:58] language actually has reference to what
[50:01] takes place in the arena in the great
[50:04] sports and the great uh competitions
[50:08] and it is to contend with adversaries
[50:11] this fight to contend to struggle to
[50:14] struggle with difficulties and dangers
[50:17] it's Not just persons we're talking
[50:19] about. We're talking about
[50:20] circumstances. We're talking about
[50:22] things that come upon us, enter our
[50:25] lives, all kinds of things, not
[50:27] necessarily bad. Sometimes good things
[50:30] take people. And we're going to talk
[50:33] about that a little later on. Fight the
[50:35] good fight. And then this word fight
[50:38] also comes from another root word which
[50:41] has mostly to do with a race or a place
[50:43] of assembly. We're right here in an
[50:46] assembly. a place of of gathering,
[50:49] especially an assembly that is meant to
[50:51] see games. And friends, while he's using
[50:54] a word and the Greeks understood it
[50:56] because the Olympics started with the
[50:57] Greeks and all the rest of it, but I can
[50:59] say the greatest the game of life is
[51:02] happening right here.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; This is the game of life. This is the
[51:06] real game that we're in. And it's not a
[51:09] play thing. It's a real one. the place
[51:12] of contest in this arena called the as
[51:16] far as I'm concerned this arena called
[51:18] the whole world the whole earth and this
[51:21] stadium that God has given us and where
[51:24] he decided he would put the bride on
[51:26] display
[51:30] &gt;&gt; it's any kind of struggle or contest and
[51:33] we can see that the nature and character
[51:36] of apostle Paul is very evident in his
[51:40] letters
[51:42] He's in a race. He's in a race to win.
[51:46] He's in a fight. And he's in a fight to
[51:48] overcome. And Paul is saying that he's
[51:51] giving us an example. That is to be and
[51:55] when you have something someone says,
[51:57] "This is an example. These are my
[51:59] footsteps. Follow in them." Then we then
[52:03] we want to press ourselves towards that
[52:06] example. an example of something that's
[52:09] it's a measuring stick as it were and we
[52:11] can keep measuring ourselves to that
[52:14] kind. If we start feeling uh laxidasical
[52:17] or wearied or wearied with the race or
[52:21] slowing down right away you need to
[52:22] measure yourself with Paul's example
[52:25] that was not the kind of example you
[52:28] know in brother Brandham's life I I
[52:31] always marvel at this because of course
[52:34] uh uh of my age now and I don't want to
[52:36] talk about that every service but uh
[52:39] here brother Brandham started talking
[52:41] when he was in his late 40s. I'm an old
[52:43] man now. I thought, my goodness, if I
[52:46] could just be that age, I'd be so happy.
[52:49] And then uh you know, he was about 52
[52:52] and he said, uh I'm an old man and an
[52:55] old warrior and I fought many battles
[52:57] and many hard battles. And he talks on
[53:00] and on about that. And and uh it wasn't
[53:04] his age, it was the fact that he had
[53:07] fought hard.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; He fought hard. He preached hard. He
[53:13] carried many burdens and resisted such
[53:16] resistance, such opposition, and yet was
[53:19] faithful to hue to the line and to bring
[53:23] the word and to leave us something that
[53:26] is a measuring stick so we can keep
[53:28] measuring ourselves by that message. I'm
[53:31] so thankful it wasn't compromised, that
[53:34] he laid it out there for us. Aren't you
[53:36] thankful?
[53:39] And so we have that even as a uh an
[53:43] example for us.
[53:47] And because this word to fight has to do
[53:50] with has to do not to follow but it
[53:53] actually infers to lead
[53:57] you know not to initiate a fight but to
[53:59] lead to to uh uh to be a leader. He Paul
[54:04] does not take the position of pour
[54:07] little water here boys, pour a little
[54:09] water there. He he takes the position of
[54:12] follow me.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; That kind of a fighter.
[54:20] It was in that that phrase actually
[54:22] comes from in the greatest battle ever
[54:24] fought in that message. Brother Brandham
[54:27] said at one time
[54:30] uh one time I was just he said little
[54:33] Jeffersonville fire department down here
[54:36] and uh uh I don't know it's Falls Place
[54:39] I guess it is P F A U S caught on fire
[54:44] and they called Jeffersonville which is
[54:46] small perhaps I don't know whether it's
[54:47] a volunteer fire department standing
[54:50] down there and the captain walking
[54:52] around saying spurt a little water here
[54:55] spurt a little water over here. Then the
[54:58] Clarkson, the Clarksville rather, uh,
[55:01] fire department came. Same thing. Spurt
[55:04] a little water here, spurt a little
[55:05] water there. He said, "And they call
[55:08] Louisville, the city, and here come
[55:11] trained men." He said, "Brother, as soon
[55:13] as that engine stopped, who was at the
[55:16] top of the ladder?" Says, "The captain."
[55:19] &gt;&gt; And when the ladder went up, he went up
[55:21] with it.
[55:23] Glory.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; He He was leading.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; See, he was ready to fight the fire.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; He was ready to lead and show the other
[55:32] boys the way, the other men the way. And
[55:33] he says, "And when he struck the window,
[55:36] he grabbed his axe and and threw it
[55:38] through the window and said, "Come on,
[55:40] boys." He said, "The fire was out in a
[55:42] few minutes."
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; So, it's how you approach something.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; How you approach these things and how
[55:49] you look upon these things. And Apostle
[55:51] Paul could then say, "Be ye followers of
[55:54] me even as I am of Christ." Now, I just
[55:57] want you to follow real close. I'm going
[55:59] to take a real sharp turn here in a few
[56:00] minutes.
[56:03] And the power of transformation.
[56:06] Now, first messenger, now the last
[56:09] messenger says, "But my dear friends,
[56:12] I'm not long. I'm not young like you all
[56:15] this morning, but I'm old and I've been
[56:19] through many hard battles. And by going
[56:22] through those
[56:24] hard battles brings you where you are
[56:27] this morning.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; He said, you see, I'm sure you
[56:32] understand. And then I highlighted this.
[56:35] God has put me through it. That my life
[56:40] might open up a way
[56:42] to say this is it.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; That my life might open up a way so I
[56:49] can say this is it. This is the way.
[56:52] These are the footsteps.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Not ashamed to say walk in them.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Walk in those footsteps. This is the
[57:01] record.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; He says this is it. And then he says,
[57:05] "And then and then you all run over the
[57:09] road. You all you run over the road."
[57:12] What road? The road the testimony that
[57:14] was left. You run over the road. But
[57:17] before me, he said, there were someone
[57:20] opened up the way for me.
[57:24] And and he says, "And we open up the
[57:26] road for one another."
[57:28] &gt;&gt; I think that was so beautifully put. But
[57:30] he's saying, you know, and and this was
[57:32] this was in ' 65. He he's going to be
[57:35] gone soon. He says, I I've I've fought a
[57:39] hard battle. I fought a hard fight. What
[57:41] kind of fight? You know what kind of
[57:44] fight it is?
[57:46] We we may talk about, you know, hard
[57:48] scars and all of those things, but what
[57:52] about the what about the man? And I
[57:53] talked to the man who actually
[57:57] saw the check.
[58:00] And this was when money was worth
[58:01] something.
[58:03] That rich man down in California that
[58:05] delivered that had that check delivered
[58:07] and had FBI men come to his door to
[58:10] identify him to make sure it got to the
[58:11] right person and $1.5 million
[58:16] because his wife had been healed from
[58:18] cancer. Brother Brandham described that
[58:20] whole event, that whole experience. He
[58:23] was standing at the door and they said,
[58:26] "Uh, we want to speak with William
[58:28] Brham." He said, "I'm William Brandham."
[58:30] They said, "Do you have you have proof
[58:32] of your identification?" He took out and
[58:34] showed them his identification. I
[58:36] believe it was his driver's license and
[58:38] so on. And and he says, "Has something
[58:40] happened? Is something wrong?" He said,
[58:42] "I thought maybe something had happened
[58:43] to Billy Paul. Has something happened?
[58:46] You know, something terrible happened?"
[58:47] And they said, "No, no, we just have to
[58:48] make sure that we know that we're
[58:50] talking to the right person." They said,
[58:52] "Do you know a Mr. Soandso?" And Brother
[58:54] Brandham said, "Yes, I remember him." He
[58:57] said, "His wife was healed from cancer
[58:59] in California in one of my meetings."
[59:02] They said, "That's exactly right." They
[59:04] said, "And he has sent you," and they
[59:06] had the papers there, sent you $1.5
[59:09] million.
[59:11] Oh, he said, "I couldn't accept that."
[59:13] They said, "You don't have to. it's
[59:15] already given to you. He said, "But I
[59:18] wouldn't know what to do with it." He
[59:19] says, he says, "I'd go crazy trying to,
[59:22] you know, figure out what to do with a
[59:24] million half dollars." They said,
[59:26] "Well," he said, "I couldn't accept
[59:27] that." He said, "Well, you don't have
[59:29] to. It's already in an account in the
[59:31] bank here. All you have to do is go
[59:33] there and and identify yourself. It's
[59:35] already been transferred to you to your
[59:38] bank." He said, he said, "You take it
[59:40] back. you take it all back and tell the
[59:43] man that I thank him very very much but
[59:45] he said I just couldn't accept that I
[59:47] say he won a great victory
[59:49] &gt;&gt; he won a great victory right there so
[59:52] it's not just you know hard grinding
[59:54] circumstantial things that it can come
[59:56] in so many ways but I believe that he
[59:59] won a great victory at that moment and
[1:00:01] Paul often uses the terms that indicates
[1:00:04] that he was well familiar with
[1:00:06] commitment and a physical cost of the of
[1:00:10] of the of the uh contest. He said, "Know
[1:00:13] ye not that they which run in a race,
[1:00:15] they run all, but one receiveth the
[1:00:18] prize. So run." He wasn't saying it to
[1:00:21] you if he wasn't doing it himself. This
[1:00:24] was a full-time job. Run that ye may
[1:00:27] obtain. In Philippians uh 3:14, I
[1:00:30] pressed toward the mark for the prize of
[1:00:33] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[1:00:36] and uh numbers. Caleb stilled the people
[1:00:40] before Moses and said, "Let us go up at
[1:00:43] once and possess it, for we are well
[1:00:45] able to overcome it." Now, that is the
[1:00:48] spirit of the Bible.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And that always has been the spirit of
[1:00:52] the scriptures, and that's still the
[1:00:54] spirit of the scriptures. We're able.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And anyone that says anything different
[1:00:59] than that isn't speaking the language of
[1:01:01] the Bible. We're able. You are able. You
[1:01:05] need to say, "I am able." I don't care
[1:01:08] what the conditions are. I don't care
[1:01:09] what the circumstances are. I am able to
[1:01:12] overcome.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Be it good, be it bad, be it something
[1:01:17] else. Uh be it physical, be it be it
[1:01:20] whatever, I'm able
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; cuz God wants me to be an overcomer.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:28] Now we don't have a great uh abundance
[1:01:33] of written record of the life of Jesus
[1:01:36] Christ in his early youth and through uh
[1:01:41] his years from his birth to 30 years
[1:01:45] old. There's not very much written about
[1:01:47] him, but brother Brandham says that
[1:01:50] Joseph
[1:01:52] was a perfect type of Christ. Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And so I want to take some things from
[1:01:58] the life of Joseph
[1:02:00] and perhaps even just tonight lay a
[1:02:03] foundation. The Lord willing, if the
[1:02:05] Lord wills, I will carry on on Sunday.
[1:02:07] But if you'd like to take your Bibles,
[1:02:10] please, and turn to Genesis 37,
[1:02:14] because I will be making reference,
[1:02:16] we're not going to read large portions,
[1:02:18] but I will be making reference to uh a
[1:02:22] number of scriptures as we go through.
[1:02:26] And and the prophet speaks of Joseph in
[1:02:29] this way in the message Israel and
[1:02:32] Egypt. He said, "Now watch. Election,
[1:02:37] election in Abraham,
[1:02:40] justification in Isaac,
[1:02:44] grace in Jacob,
[1:02:46] and perfection in Joseph." He said,
[1:02:49] "There's not one thing recorded against
[1:02:53] Joseph."
[1:02:55] There's not one thing recorded against
[1:02:58] Joseph. He said, "That's the perfection.
[1:03:07] The Bible tells us just in the second
[1:03:11] verse here we can say even read read
[1:03:13] verse one. And Jacob dwelt in the land
[1:03:16] wherein his father was a stranger in the
[1:03:19] land of Canaan. And these are the
[1:03:22] generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17
[1:03:26] years old was feeding the flock with his
[1:03:29] brethren. And the lad was with the sons
[1:03:33] of Bila, and with the sons of Zilpa, his
[1:03:37] father's wives. And Joseph brought unto
[1:03:41] his father their evil report. So we have
[1:03:45] now Joseph being 17. And I thought soon
[1:03:49] as I read that, I thought of so many of
[1:03:52] the young men and the young ladies and
[1:03:54] things that God has been doing. And this
[1:03:57] should have a special meaning for you
[1:04:01] because now we don't we don't have we
[1:04:04] can't go back and say now Jesus being 17
[1:04:07] and starting to detail his life and and
[1:04:10] and so on and what he went through we
[1:04:13] have no idea. But Joseph being 17 and he
[1:04:17] starts now to detail his life and it is
[1:04:21] a a remarkable remarkable life. remember
[1:04:24] not one thing against him, a perfect
[1:04:28] type of Jesus Christ. He knew nothing
[1:04:30] about that. He was reflecting a shadow
[1:04:34] of the life of Jesus Christ. And we must
[1:04:37] not lose sight that we are here living
[1:04:40] an expression of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; He without the Holy Spirit and we have
[1:04:46] the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He had nothing to look back to. He
[1:04:51] didn't have books to study. He didn't
[1:04:54] have preachers to preach to him. He
[1:04:56] didn't have everything that we have to
[1:04:59] to encourage us and to strengthen us and
[1:05:02] to fellowship along the way. And perhaps
[1:05:05] also I could say he didn't have many of
[1:05:07] the things that you and I have to
[1:05:09] struggle with. But he had plenty of
[1:05:11] things to struggle with. And I believe
[1:05:13] that the principles which applied for
[1:05:16] him still apply today.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart
[1:05:24] that the same principles apply.
[1:05:28] Brother Brandham said about Joseph,
[1:05:32] I was taking the life of Joseph. Now
[1:05:35] just if this if this meant something to
[1:05:38] brother Brandham, I wonder if it can't
[1:05:40] mean something to you and I.
[1:05:43] And he said, I was just reading his life
[1:05:47] and you know Abraham was election and
[1:05:49] Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac and which
[1:05:52] was justification and Isaac begat Jacob
[1:05:54] which was grace and he said but Jacob
[1:05:58] begat Joseph which was perfection not
[1:06:01] one thing against him. And he said, "I
[1:06:03] seen his life." And he thought about his
[1:06:05] life. And he thanked God that there was
[1:06:09] such a life as Joseph's that was
[1:06:12] recorded in the scripture. And he said
[1:06:14] he went into his closet and he just
[1:06:17] closed the door and he began to weep
[1:06:20] thanking God for Joseph's life.
[1:06:24] I would say here on a Wednesday evening,
[1:06:26] if that can so uh be absorbed and taken
[1:06:30] in and the Holy Spirit move upon a
[1:06:32] prophet messenger over a man's life in
[1:06:35] the scripture, we who have received the
[1:06:37] message, we ought to be able to say
[1:06:39] tonight that same life, let it impact
[1:06:42] me.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Let me absorb. Let me let it penetrate
[1:06:47] my being. Let it not just be some words
[1:06:50] and a story and an account, but let me
[1:06:53] be gripped by it also. And I want to say
[1:06:56] that Paul said, "Fight the good fight of
[1:07:00] faith." I'm saying to you this evening,
[1:07:02] I'm taking Joseph's life and saying he
[1:07:05] fought a good fight.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; He fought a good fight. And he had to
[1:07:11] fight all the way, but he fought a very
[1:07:14] good fight.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; He fight He fought an admirable fight.
[1:07:18] a very useful fight because here we are
[1:07:21] all these thousands of years down the
[1:07:23] road and we are being benefited and I
[1:07:26] say thank God for Joseph
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; and the life that he lived
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] Brother Brandham says of Joseph,
[1:07:44] says Joseph was spiritual.
[1:07:48] You know friends,
[1:07:50] it's not easy being spiritual.
[1:07:54] Because to be spiritual, you're
[1:07:56] misunderstood.
[1:07:59] to be spiritual.
[1:08:02] Not only misunderstood, but people
[1:08:04] identify you as maybe trying to be
[1:08:06] something above, oh, you know, you're
[1:08:10] too good, you're too holy
[1:08:13] if you're spiritual. Now, spiritual
[1:08:16] isn't something that you put on.
[1:08:19] Spiritual is something that you possess
[1:08:22] as a gift from God.
[1:08:25] I want you to take this very, very
[1:08:27] closely. spiritual.
[1:08:30] It is to be higher than man but inferior
[1:08:34] to God. We're less than God is in that
[1:08:38] in that sense, but we're higher than the
[1:08:41] average person, higher than man's
[1:08:44] interest. We're not interested in in
[1:08:46] man's world, man's accomplishment, man's
[1:08:49] interest. Because being spiritual, you
[1:08:51] you have a different kind of an
[1:08:53] appetite.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] He says of him, of Joseph, look at
[1:09:00] Joseph, the perfect one. He said we
[1:09:04] could spend weeks on him. Look, hated of
[1:09:07] his brothers, loved of his father, he
[1:09:12] was a spiritual man,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; That's why being spiritual
[1:09:17] and he couldn't help that.
[1:09:20] He goes on to say
[1:09:24] uh of Joseph,
[1:09:27] he said, "When I read that," and here's
[1:09:31] here's what I was describing just
[1:09:32] earlier, and I'll put it in in Brother
[1:09:33] Brandham's own words. He said, "When I
[1:09:35] read that about Joseph being a perfect
[1:09:38] type of Christ," he said, "when I read
[1:09:39] that, I just got to crying one day in my
[1:09:43] little old hotel room and I went over to
[1:09:46] the closet where I had my clothes
[1:09:48] hanging and pulled the door together and
[1:09:51] I said, "God,
[1:09:54] I want to thank you for a man like
[1:09:56] Joseph who once lived on the earth, a
[1:10:00] man in flesh like I am a man that could
[1:10:05] believe you and take your word.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:10:12] sometime in prayer quite often
[1:10:14] especially if I find myself in a
[1:10:16] difficult time I go back and and and
[1:10:20] pick out someone in the scripture say he
[1:10:23] was just like me. He had to live just
[1:10:26] like me. He had to endure you know
[1:10:29] circumstances. He had to eat food. He
[1:10:31] had to grow. He had to work or whatever.
[1:10:34] He had responsibilities. Maybe he had a
[1:10:35] family, had children or had friends or
[1:10:38] colleagues or associates or whatever
[1:10:40] more. It was like me. All it is is a
[1:10:42] little span of time between him and me.
[1:10:45] But his God, the God that he sought to
[1:10:47] serve is the same God I'm serving.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if God honored him,
[1:10:52] Brother Brandham says, just look back
[1:10:54] and see if God honored something back
[1:10:56] there. He honored faith. He honored a
[1:10:58] certain character. Honored a certain
[1:11:00] prayer. He'll do it again.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] And he says uh
[1:11:09] he said he was hated of his brethren.
[1:11:12] And I want you to catch this. He
[1:11:14] couldn't help
[1:11:16] being spiritual.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be dwelling on that now for
[1:11:20] a little bit. He couldn't help being
[1:11:23] spiritual. I want to make a very very uh
[1:11:27] quick statement and make it clear.
[1:11:30] Spiritual is not something you learn.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Spiritual is not something you put on.
[1:11:36] Spiritual is not something you acquire.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Spiritual is something that is actually
[1:11:42] divinely given you by God and you can't
[1:11:45] help it.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; In fact is you have nothing to do with
[1:11:48] it. It's something that God has put in a
[1:11:51] person. A spiritual person has a a a
[1:11:55] different outlook. They have different
[1:11:58] desires. They have different uh uh they
[1:12:02] approach things differently, but they
[1:12:04] can't help it. They just can't help it.
[1:12:06] Now, it's not it's not a kink in a
[1:12:08] person's nature. Said, "Well, that's
[1:12:11] just the way I am. That's not I'm not
[1:12:14] talking about that. That's not spiritual
[1:12:15] to me." spiritual. Uh you'll have a
[1:12:18] whole lot better grasp of it as we go
[1:12:20] on, but he said he couldn't help being
[1:12:22] spiritual. He saw visions. Now, maybe
[1:12:25] you've never seen a vision, but he also
[1:12:29] dreamed dreams.
[1:12:31] You perhaps could dream a dream. When
[1:12:33] you dream a dream, please tell me how
[1:12:36] you're going to help that.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; You have a good dream, you have a bad
[1:12:40] dream. Whatever the dream is, can you
[1:12:43] change it? Can you do anything about it?
[1:12:45] you're helpless
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; because it's in another dimension. It's
[1:12:50] in another realm. And that's the kind of
[1:12:52] phrase I apply. You can't help that.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; That's where spiritual, the spiritual
[1:12:58] that I'm referring to. That's where that
[1:13:00] happens. Spiritual is not having a
[1:13:02] certain kind of an atmosphere here in
[1:13:04] the church or certain kind of atmosphere
[1:13:06] in your home. We can say, well, that's
[1:13:08] a, you know, spiritual home. But that's
[1:13:09] not the spiritual I'm talking about. I'm
[1:13:11] talking about the spiritual that you
[1:13:13] have. No, you have no hand in it
[1:13:16] whatsoever. It's something that God
[1:13:19] does.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I want that to be superimposed in your
[1:13:22] mind for this service tonight. God does
[1:13:25] it. God puts a certain gift, a certain
[1:13:28] talent, and you can't help it.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of it. No matter what
[1:13:32] you would do to try to get rid of it,
[1:13:33] you can't get rid of it because it's
[1:13:35] there. It's you.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; It's something that God has given.
[1:13:40] So the spiritual part
[1:13:44] that I'm speaking of, it has nothing to
[1:13:47] do with a person's conviction or the way
[1:13:49] they think or anything along that line,
[1:13:52] whether something is right or whether
[1:13:54] it's wrong. That's not the spiritual
[1:13:56] part that I'm talking. I'm I'm not
[1:13:58] talking about uh a person saying, "Well,
[1:14:01] that's just me. it, you know, even
[1:14:04] though it might be a good uh
[1:14:05] characteristic, I'm not talking about
[1:14:07] good characteristics as opposed to uh
[1:14:10] characteristics that aren't that good.
[1:14:12] Now,
[1:14:14] in in and let me just lay this down now
[1:14:17] in God testifying of his gifts in that
[1:14:20] message,
[1:14:22] brother Brandham speaks. He says, "Now
[1:14:24] to see visions,"
[1:14:26] he said, "I couldn't help that."
[1:14:30] See, don't don't let that go over your
[1:14:32] head just because you say, "Well, we've
[1:14:33] never seen visions. How does that
[1:14:34] apply?" Just just hold it in your mind,
[1:14:36] please. He said, "No one nobody never
[1:14:40] laid hands on me and said, now you have
[1:14:42] the gift of visions." He said, "It
[1:14:45] wasn't that I merited it. God ordained
[1:14:49] it to be so. And then I find that is
[1:14:53] so." Then I come out here in the name of
[1:14:56] the Lord after he had commissioned me to
[1:14:59] do so to try to help you to believe God.
[1:15:02] How many understands that now? He didn't
[1:15:04] have anything to do with it. God dropped
[1:15:07] that thing uh that upon him and it was
[1:15:11] divine. That was spiritual. And then he
[1:15:15] comes out and operates and functions in
[1:15:19] that uh in that uh I will say in that
[1:15:22] office of a prophet. And God was doing
[1:15:25] that to help you as believers to
[1:15:28] believe.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Putting a man in a place where he had no
[1:15:32] control.
[1:15:35] Now he said, "Now here's a man." This
[1:15:38] was in we would see Jesus in Grass
[1:15:40] Valley. In fact, as I I know the pastor
[1:15:43] that was probably here at this time,
[1:15:46] Brother Watson was his name in Grass
[1:15:48] Valley, California. He said, "Here's a
[1:15:50] man, a total stranger. Don't know him.
[1:15:54] Never seen him in my life. He might be
[1:15:56] eat up with cancer. He might have
[1:15:59] domestic troubles, financial. I don't
[1:16:02] know what's wrong with him. He's
[1:16:03] standing here just a man." Now, imagine
[1:16:06] what's a man what's going through his
[1:16:08] heart. He's a man like you men and women
[1:16:11] are stood before him like you women. And
[1:16:13] he said uh and now if the Holy Spirit
[1:16:16] will reveal to me and he said that
[1:16:18] little lady now he turns from the man he
[1:16:20] says that little lady sitting right back
[1:16:23] over here towards where I'm pointing my
[1:16:26] finger suffering with that eczema.
[1:16:29] He said if you'll believe with all your
[1:16:31] heart you believe it lady with all your
[1:16:34] heart. little gay-headed woman with
[1:16:36] glasses on got she she suffers from
[1:16:39] eczema. She was standing there and
[1:16:43] sitting there rather thinking about what
[1:16:45] was wrong with her praying in her heart.
[1:16:49] And now if that's right and you believe
[1:16:51] that God will make you well stand up on
[1:16:53] your feet. What did she touch? I ask you
[1:16:56] what did she touch? She's 20 yards from
[1:16:59] me. She touched the high priest and the
[1:17:01] high priest is here. He's the same
[1:17:03] yesterday, today, and forever. Don't you
[1:17:05] see? Don't doubt it. Believe it. Have
[1:17:07] faith. And now he turns to the man. He
[1:17:09] says, "Now, I couldn't help that.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That was spiritual.
[1:17:18] I couldn't help that." There was nothing
[1:17:21] he could do to change that circumstance.
[1:17:26] talking to a man and then turns and
[1:17:30] talks to a woman and speaks to her and
[1:17:33] tells her exactly now
[1:17:36] God did that. That light moved from him
[1:17:40] to her and he couldn't help it. He had
[1:17:43] to follow that. He couldn't even help
[1:17:46] what he was saying. He had to say what
[1:17:48] he said and then come back and tell the
[1:17:52] man, "I couldn't help that.
[1:17:58] He said, "It's just I watch a light and
[1:18:02] it just went from me and I seen it
[1:18:05] hanging over there and I seen the little
[1:18:08] lady come up before me and she kept
[1:18:10] coming before me here and see it was a
[1:18:13] woman instead of a man. They had a man
[1:18:16] in front of him
[1:18:18] and I couldn't help that. I just had to
[1:18:20] speak what I was saying
[1:18:24] in the messages in the message images of
[1:18:26] Christ. I want to establish just two or
[1:18:28] three because I'm coming down to where
[1:18:31] we live in just a moment. Here's a woman
[1:18:34] sitting here praying.
[1:18:36] She's a warrior. Now,
[1:18:39] now I'm reading these, but I want to I
[1:18:43] want you to think real real deep. In the
[1:18:46] realm of the divine, there is no time.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; What I read now is just as real and just
[1:18:54] as effective at this moment as it was 50
[1:18:58] years ago, 20 years ago, or 2,000 years
[1:19:00] ago.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; That's why we can read the Psalms and
[1:19:04] they're eternal.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; We can read the word of God and it's
[1:19:08] eternal because God's eternal. We read
[1:19:10] the prayers of the saints and it's
[1:19:12] eternal. We can read a prayer of of a of
[1:19:15] a believer and and there's that is not
[1:19:19] time locked.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's eternal
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; because it's it's it's in God.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And and and so now he's saying here's a
[1:19:29] woman sitting here praying. She's a
[1:19:31] warrior.
[1:19:33] I know her, but I can't help cuz the
[1:19:37] lights hanging over her. He knew her. So
[1:19:40] often he would say, "We're strangers.
[1:19:42] We're strangers. We're strangers. We
[1:19:44] don't know each other. We've never met
[1:19:46] each other. But now it's it's the
[1:19:48] opposite. He He knows this woman. And
[1:19:50] now he's saying, "But I can't help it."
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; It isn't that I can't help knowing her.
[1:19:55] He couldn't help what was happening,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; even though he didn't know her. Now, now
[1:19:59] this is spiritual. Joseph was spiritual.
[1:20:02] He saw dreams. He had visions. He
[1:20:05] couldn't help it. And he was hated
[1:20:07] because of it. And it's an amazing
[1:20:09] thing. It's an amazing thing. Here here
[1:20:12] the prophet they loved the prophet for
[1:20:15] you know for the the supernatural and
[1:20:17] the miraculous and at the same time it
[1:20:19] was a bittersweet experience because
[1:20:21] they also hated him for being spiritual
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; exactly as it was with Joseph. He was
[1:20:27] disliked because this gift separated him
[1:20:32] from all others. This wasn't something
[1:20:35] like some of the other great evangelist.
[1:20:37] There was nothing like it. It is like it
[1:20:40] was with Jesus when he was here. It
[1:20:42] wasn't as though there was eight or 10
[1:20:44] people that were kind of similar. No,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; he was in a world by himself.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; He was in completely in a world by
[1:20:51] himself. And when the messenger comes
[1:20:52] and he has to reveal that same one,
[1:20:55] that's why it was it was on another
[1:20:57] planet. It was in another dimension.
[1:21:00] There wasn't anything even like it. and
[1:21:03] people coming around saying, you know,
[1:21:04] somebody over here or somebody up there
[1:21:05] has got a backachche and somebody over
[1:21:07] here has got a some trouble with their
[1:21:08] knee. That that that I wouldn't say
[1:21:11] anything uh derogatory about it, but
[1:21:13] that has nothing to do with what we're
[1:21:15] talking about. has nothing to do with
[1:21:17] the message we're talking about or what
[1:21:19] God did to this messenger because this
[1:21:22] was sent to reveal and make known the
[1:21:25] works of Jesus Christ once again before
[1:21:27] the people so that you could have such a
[1:21:30] unshakable assurance and con be so
[1:21:33] thoroughly convinced
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; he says I
[1:21:40] I I can't help that because he knows her
[1:21:44] and he said that's Miss Bruce Bruce.
[1:21:47] Now he says, "Now, Miss Bruce, I don't
[1:21:50] know a thing about what's wrong with
[1:21:51] you. You were healed of cancer one time,
[1:21:56] but that but that uh but right there at
[1:21:59] that door, the first time I ever saw
[1:22:02] told you you were standing in that door
[1:22:04] and the Holy Spirit told me something
[1:22:06] that nobody knew besides you and the
[1:22:09] doctor." That's right, isn't it? And do
[1:22:12] you believe he can tell me what's wrong
[1:22:14] now? I know you, but I don't know what's
[1:22:17] your trouble. I have no idea because
[1:22:21] you're healed of the cancer, but I can't
[1:22:24] help that light hanging over you.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I can't help it.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Now, this is something that is beyond
[1:22:31] us.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; I can't help it.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; That light didn't disappear with the
[1:22:37] prophet's body.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That light didn't go back into the
[1:22:41] heavens. That light has stayed with the
[1:22:44] word.
[1:22:45] And I can't help that.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And out from that light, out from that
[1:22:51] glorious light has come the word.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour has been spoken.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And it came by your way and I can't help
[1:23:04] that. And you can't help that.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; It came by your way and that was a
[1:23:09] divine act of almighty God. And you
[1:23:12] can't help that. And then there was
[1:23:15] something within you that said, "I
[1:23:18] believe that."
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And you couldn't help that.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Even though your mind said, "Ah, I got
[1:23:25] all kinds of questions. I got all kinds
[1:23:27] of reasonings. I I I could question
[1:23:29] that. I could think about that. I could
[1:23:31] reason this. And I got friends and I got
[1:23:33] family and and they say I'm crazy or
[1:23:36] something. I shouldn't even be looking
[1:23:37] at that." But something was inside. And
[1:23:39] something was inside pulling you that
[1:23:41] was spiritual.
[1:23:44] and you couldn't help it.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I looked down into your faces and the
[1:23:49] testimonies just uh raced through my
[1:23:51] mind. And when even when I spoke to some
[1:23:54] of you and and the first message time
[1:23:56] the first time the message came to you,
[1:23:58] I thought there's no way. There's no way
[1:24:01] this person's going to believe that.
[1:24:03] Sister Bobby, that's what I thought
[1:24:04] about you. Sorry. I said no way this
[1:24:09] woman's going to believe this.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah.
[1:24:12] Hallelujah. I say, glory to God. That's
[1:24:16] spiritual.
[1:24:18] And you had that in you. You had that in
[1:24:21] you. That was something that come from
[1:24:23] God. Nobody could lay hands on you and
[1:24:26] give it to you. It wasn't a gift. It
[1:24:28] wasn't trained into you. It wasn't
[1:24:30] preached into you. It wasn't prayed into
[1:24:33] you. You possessed it
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; from God
[1:24:37] and you couldn't help it. And I'm so
[1:24:40] glad tonight I can say that to you. You
[1:24:42] couldn't help it.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; You had no power over it. You maybe even
[1:24:47] tried to suppress it. You tried to lay
[1:24:50] it aside. I'll forget this.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; You couldn't do it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; You just couldn't do it.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; I could end the service right here. I
[1:25:03] feel I've that that's really where I was
[1:25:06] coming to, but I'm not going to stop.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't help saying
[1:25:13] it.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; There were things he didn't want to say.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; He said he began to talk about families
[1:25:21] and marital problems. He said, "It kills
[1:25:23] me to say this. I've got family here."
[1:25:26] But he had to say it anyway. And I'm
[1:25:29] glad he said it.
[1:25:31] Hallelujah. And when we heard it, there
[1:25:35] was something inside divinely given by
[1:25:38] almighty God said, I believe that.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; How is it? One person reads a book and
[1:25:47] this person reads the next book and one
[1:25:49] thing says this is garbage. Next person
[1:25:52] says this is priceless.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; This is marvelous.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; One says that's total confusion. And for
[1:26:00] the other person says it just settled
[1:26:02] all the confusion.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; What's the difference between that? It's
[1:26:08] because one is spiritual and the other
[1:26:11] one is not spiritual.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah. Spiritual is something that
[1:26:17] come from God. You can get it no other
[1:26:20] way. And you can't help it. Oh, I love
[1:26:23] that phrase. You can't help it. You
[1:26:25] possess it. You have it. And there isn't
[1:26:27] anything you did to get it. You weren't
[1:26:30] trained into it. God gave it to you.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand saw visions. Joseph
[1:26:38] dreamed dreams.
[1:26:40] But you had a light that went on inside.
[1:26:44] You heard a word and a light illuminated
[1:26:47] you inside and you couldn't help it.
[1:26:50] They couldn't help seeing it. He
[1:26:52] couldn't help speaking it. And you
[1:26:53] couldn't help believing it.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Tell you what, I could do
[1:26:59] a dance.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; In fellowship.
[1:27:12] He said, "What's the matter with me?"
[1:27:15] Here's brother Brandham. Now, you going
[1:27:16] to listen to this? What's the matter
[1:27:18] with me? I asked my wife the other day.
[1:27:19] He says, "Am I a mad man?"
[1:27:22] Can you imagine? Maybe you never run
[1:27:24] across that before. Brother Bram saying
[1:27:26] to his wife, "What's the matter? Am I a
[1:27:29] madman?" He said, "I can't help saying
[1:27:31] those things."
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Now, you can see the kind of warfare,
[1:27:36] the kind of warfare, but he overcame.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't succumb
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; to this his own thoughts. Oh, you think
[1:27:49] he wanted to be thought of people like
[1:27:51] that? His own his whole character. He
[1:27:54] said, "I love people." He didn't want
[1:27:57] them to think bad of him. And here the
[1:27:59] thing that was sputtering out of his
[1:28:02] mouth, people's going to think he's a
[1:28:04] mad man to the point say, "Am I a mad
[1:28:07] man?
[1:28:08] Something wrong with me?
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; People will call you, you're crazy.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; You've gone off the deep end.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You're nuts.
[1:28:23] You are insane.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's wild. That's weird. And all the
[1:28:28] other phrases and all you can say, I'm
[1:28:31] sorry. I can't help it.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; I can't help it.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's something from within.
[1:28:38] I can't help it. Can you help it?
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; No, I can't help it. We can't help it.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Why did you believe?
[1:28:47] You may not even know why you believed
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; but you can say I can't help but
[1:28:51] believe.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; He said and right after this in the same
[1:29:00] he said this afternoon when he said I'm
[1:29:02] a am I a mad man? He said I can't help
[1:29:04] saying it. He said there's an impulse
[1:29:06] within me that drives it.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; And I can't help that. Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You can't help the impulse that's within
[1:29:15] you that caused you when when the word
[1:29:19] came by your way. You can't help the
[1:29:21] impulse. Something within you laying
[1:29:24] out. I talked to one brother. He's on
[1:29:26] the other side right now.
[1:29:30] And he had been in the Catholic church.
[1:29:33] He'd given his life. He ever even went
[1:29:36] down to do mission work down in Borneo.
[1:29:38] was on a ship on a Catholic uh uh ship
[1:29:43] to help the people and he was just
[1:29:45] giving himself he was trying to get away
[1:29:47] from alcoholism and he was just giving
[1:29:50] himself
[1:29:52] brother Amy
[1:29:56] how he fought and how he struggled. And
[1:29:58] then one day the message was just
[1:30:01] introduced to him, just brought to him
[1:30:03] very very casually I guess and you know
[1:30:05] about the message and so on and so
[1:30:07] forth. And and uh he said he said I
[1:30:11] could have he said I could have punched
[1:30:13] a thousand holes through it. He said
[1:30:16] there just all kinds of things
[1:30:18] theologically that he could have just
[1:30:20] found all kinds of fault with it. But he
[1:30:23] said there just something in him said
[1:30:26] it's the truth. Right.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; That's the impulse.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; That's the spiritual part. That's
[1:30:32] something he never learned. That's
[1:30:34] something he wasn't educated into. That
[1:30:37] had nothing to do with the church.
[1:30:38] Nothing to do with this church or any
[1:30:39] other church. It's an impulse inside.
[1:30:42] That is that came from God as much as
[1:30:44] the vision came from God.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; That come from God.
[1:30:53] and he gave his life to Christ in light
[1:30:55] of this word and called his mom over on
[1:30:58] Vancouver Island and told her that he
[1:31:01] had received Christ now and he had he
[1:31:03] you know and and and he says I'm free
[1:31:05] from alcohol and she says no says call
[1:31:09] me in 6 months
[1:31:13] and he come to me and he almost didn't
[1:31:15] overcome he'd been just on top you know
[1:31:18] oh this new life and how marvelous it
[1:31:21] was and Oh, he was just walking on cloud
[1:31:24] nine and he wanted to tell everybody and
[1:31:27] so he went and told his mom. Joseph had
[1:31:29] to go and tell his father, "I saw a
[1:31:31] dream.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; I saw a dream about the mo about the
[1:31:36] moon and the stars and 11 the moon and
[1:31:39] the sun and 11 stars and they were all
[1:31:41] bowing to me." His father rebuked him.
[1:31:47] But the Bible says his father also
[1:31:48] observed the saying. His father went
[1:31:51] away and said, 'You know, I wonder what
[1:31:53] that means.
[1:31:55] Amy, he's on cloud nine, calls his mom.
[1:31:57] He says, I'm I'm free from alcohol. I
[1:32:00] gave my life to Christ. Ah, call me in 6
[1:32:03] months. And he come back to me and his
[1:32:05] chin is dragging on the ground and she
[1:32:08] doesn't believe me. He said, you know,
[1:32:10] she couldn't share his joy at all. In
[1:32:11] fact, she was angry.
[1:32:14] And now he's finding something outside
[1:32:16] of the Catholic church. So he says,
[1:32:19] "What do I do?" I said, "Call her in 6
[1:32:21] months."
[1:32:24] So he says, "Okay." So he he went away
[1:32:27] and and then he came back to me 6 months
[1:32:29] later and he says, "It's now 6 months."
[1:32:31] I said, "Give her another call."
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; So he called her up. "Hi, mom." He said,
[1:32:36] "It's 6 months and it's still I'm still
[1:32:39] free." She says, "Ah." She didn't want
[1:32:40] to have any do. He came back. He was
[1:32:42] discouraged. He says, "I call her and I
[1:32:45] waited six months. Now what do I do?" He
[1:32:46] said, "Wait a year. Call her after a
[1:32:49] year." Okay. Said, "Hallelujah. I tell
[1:32:53] you what, we were able to put him in a
[1:32:56] in a his body in the ground. His soul
[1:32:59] went into into the very presence of
[1:33:01] Jesus Christ many, many years later. And
[1:33:03] that impulse that was within that was
[1:33:07] spiritual. That's something that come
[1:33:08] from God. Didn't come from the Catholic
[1:33:10] Church. Didn't come from this church,
[1:33:11] but it come from Christ. Come from God.
[1:33:14] It was there. and his mind could punch a
[1:33:17] thousand holes in it, but his soul
[1:33:19] believed it because there was something
[1:33:21] spiritual there.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Couldn't help it, friends.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Couldn't help it.
[1:33:30] And he said he was in this motel.
[1:33:33] Oh my goodness.
[1:33:35] Uh he said, "I was in this mo motel and
[1:33:38] I'm staying where I'm staying." And
[1:33:40] there was a bunch of people coming in
[1:33:42] drunk and women and grandmothers wearing
[1:33:44] shorts and dressed immorally and
[1:33:46] drinking and smoking. And I thought,
[1:33:48] God,
[1:33:50] why should I speak to my sisters in the
[1:33:52] way that I do and not wanting to say
[1:33:54] those things, but why should I do that?
[1:33:57] And look at here, still struggling at
[1:33:58] why should I say that? And he said just
[1:34:01] as sweetly, not an audible voice, but
[1:34:05] something inside me said, "I don't want
[1:34:08] my children looking like that." And
[1:34:11] there you are. He said, "You're
[1:34:12] different people." When I see when I
[1:34:15] heard it in my heart, he said, "I don't
[1:34:18] want my children." He said, "That me
[1:34:20] good, my children." He said, "I love the
[1:34:24] church, and that's what Christ died for.
[1:34:32] Now the woman at the well, you know how
[1:34:35] many times that brother Brandham uses
[1:34:37] that? Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:34:39] of times.
[1:34:43] When that woman saw that
[1:34:46] gift, that her own need revealed.
[1:34:52] Nobody had to teach her. She didn't go
[1:34:55] through any course to find out this was
[1:34:58] a prophet.
[1:35:01] She didn't go through any course. And I
[1:35:04] was listening to a tape yesterday
[1:35:08] and I was really affected by it and I I
[1:35:12] don't remember hearing brother Brandham
[1:35:15] take such pains to lay out the ministry
[1:35:19] in this end time his ministry the
[1:35:22] ministry that you have been birthed
[1:35:24] under. And he went to such pains he went
[1:35:27] all through the scripture
[1:35:29] and it was so quiet. It was so quiet and
[1:35:34] you could see the people. This is in
[1:35:36] 1964 and you see the people really
[1:35:38] struggling with it. He just laying out
[1:35:41] that son of man, the revealing of the
[1:35:43] son of man, the Elohim in flesh coming
[1:35:46] to Abraham and turning his back. And I
[1:35:48] could see he was setting the stage. Oh
[1:35:51] God, what comes at the end of this one
[1:35:54] is going to be something dramatic.
[1:35:57] And uh
[1:36:03] he he begins to
[1:36:08] call the people. He called just 10 of
[1:36:09] them up.
[1:36:14] And as he's speaking to these people,
[1:36:16] then you could say, "Oh, they all were
[1:36:18] rejoicing. Oh, you could hear the whole
[1:36:20] building all rejoicing. You know, you
[1:36:22] got stomach trouble, just keep on going
[1:36:24] and believing. and you got something
[1:36:26] wrong with you. You keep on going
[1:36:28] believing and the people are all
[1:36:29] enthused and says you still smoke
[1:36:31] cigarettes and that's why you got that
[1:36:33] stomach trouble that nicotine draining
[1:36:35] down into your stomach. He says that's
[1:36:36] why you got that stomach trouble. He
[1:36:38] said I renounce those cigarettes in the
[1:36:40] name of Jesus Christ. Just keep walking.
[1:36:42] and oh the people I thought you know
[1:36:46] when
[1:36:48] here he spent a whole sermon to lay out
[1:36:52] out of the scriptures
[1:36:54] the prophet's ministry in the end time
[1:36:57] and they don't believe it
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; right
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; and then he began to demonstrate and
[1:37:02] reveal the secret of their heart and oh
[1:37:04] then they all go rejoicing over that but
[1:37:06] I thought of the woman at the well
[1:37:09] and when her heart was revealed
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen That's when she said, "You're a
[1:37:14] prophet."
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I thought how different that woman was
[1:37:18] from all those Pentecostal ministers
[1:37:21] here. They were missing it completely.
[1:37:24] And she caught it.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; A Samaritan woman at that same sign. And
[1:37:29] then she said, "I know when the Messiah
[1:37:32] comes. He'll tell us all things." And a
[1:37:34] few moments later, he said, "I that
[1:37:37] speak to thee am he." Nobody taught her
[1:37:41] to drop her water bucket and run into
[1:37:43] the city. She didn't learn that in
[1:37:46] Sunday school. She had something
[1:37:48] spiritual within her said the Christ.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something spiritual. It
[1:37:56] wasn't she had to see something or have
[1:37:58] some dramatic thing happened. In fact is
[1:38:01] they got all excited and there was a
[1:38:03] great rejoicing and so on when they saw
[1:38:05] it demonstrated in the prophet's
[1:38:06] ministry. But when G when when Jesus
[1:38:09] demonstrated to that Samaritan, she felt
[1:38:11] silent.
[1:38:14] You've had five husbands. The one you
[1:38:16] have now is not your husband.
[1:38:19] Says, "Sir,
[1:38:21] you're a prophet."
[1:38:26] The Samaritans say we should worship
[1:38:28] here and we should worship there. The
[1:38:30] Jews say we should worship there.
[1:38:38] There's a man sitting here in the
[1:38:41] congregation
[1:38:48] and because of circumstances in his
[1:38:50] life,
[1:38:52] he wasn't able to keep work.
[1:38:57] Very, very difficult circumstances.
[1:39:00] And God found him
[1:39:03] in his pit of despair
[1:39:06] and he heard the prophet's message.
[1:39:10] And when he first came to the little log
[1:39:13] church,
[1:39:15] he was didn't feel worthy. He'd come in
[1:39:18] when no one was there and get some tapes
[1:39:20] and go out.
[1:39:24] And one day
[1:39:27] he came home and he was very
[1:39:29] discouraged.
[1:39:31] He was married then
[1:39:34] and I believe had a child
[1:39:38] and he'd just been I think released from
[1:39:40] another job. I don't know all the
[1:39:42] details. He came in and the sofa was
[1:39:45] sitting there
[1:39:48] and he sat in a chair
[1:39:51] and before when he came in
[1:39:54] he doesn't know why but he went into a
[1:39:56] closet
[1:39:58] and he put on a white shirt in the
[1:40:01] closet and came back out and sat in the
[1:40:05] chair.
[1:40:07] A tape was on but he doesn't know what
[1:40:09] tape it was.
[1:40:11] it just somewhere in the tape
[1:40:14] and he just pushed it on.
[1:40:18] And after that he said to me sometime
[1:40:22] later, Brother Brandham spoke to me
[1:40:26] through a tape
[1:40:29] because this brother who's sitting here
[1:40:31] looking at me now said, "I must not have
[1:40:35] the Holy Ghost if I can't provide for my
[1:40:38] wife."
[1:40:40] And I need a job.
[1:40:50] Brother David, I know you don't want to
[1:40:52] do this, but I want you to come up here.
[1:40:55] Would you do that for me?
[1:41:08] God's timeless.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear it.
[1:41:23] The Holy Ghost for a job, too. You
[1:41:25] believe that God will give you the Holy
[1:41:27] Ghost and give you the job? Now, reach
[1:41:28] your hand up right here. Sitting there
[1:41:29] with the white shirt on. All right. I
[1:41:31] never seen anyone in my life. That's
[1:41:32] exactly what he was thinking. If that's
[1:41:33] right, wave your hand like this. Now,
[1:41:35] don't you see the word of God discerns
[1:41:37] the thoughts and intents of the heart?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is named yesterday.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; And right after that,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; how many years ago, Brother David?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; 21.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; 21 years ago. Right after that, he got a
[1:41:55] good job working for Finning Tractor,
[1:41:58] and that's where he still is today.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:13] Brother David, you want to tell us what
[1:42:16] that was like when you stepped in there?
[1:42:17] I I related it, but I couldn't tell like
[1:42:20] you did. How were you feeling when you
[1:42:22] came out to speak right up to this
[1:42:24] microphone?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Um, I think I just sat down and uh,
[1:42:30] yeah, Brother Edward's right. We were
[1:42:32] kind of in despair. Hadn't we hadn't
[1:42:34] been able to pay the rent for about four
[1:42:36] or five months. Luckily, we had somebody
[1:42:39] who was patient
[1:42:41] and uh yeah, so I I just sat in the
[1:42:43] chair, punched on a tape, been out all
[1:42:46] morning, got up every morning, went out
[1:42:47] looking for something to do, and uh
[1:42:50] Brother Bam started talking
[1:42:53] and uh you know, it was like he was just
[1:42:56] talking right to me. I looked at Violet
[1:42:58] and and she looked at me and both of our
[1:43:00] eyes were kind of, you know, we just so
[1:43:04] we just sat there. But here's the part
[1:43:07] that that uh is really hard to
[1:43:10] understand and and and cannot really be
[1:43:12] explained, I think. Then that happened
[1:43:17] and I thought, "Wow, Brother Brandon was
[1:43:20] talking to me. I know it." and and uh
[1:43:24] but something happened about two weeks
[1:43:26] later that I've never been able to to
[1:43:30] explain and and I punched on a tape
[1:43:32] again, but this time I was in a much
[1:43:34] deeper
[1:43:36] uh you know listening and I I put on the
[1:43:40] tape and it was like
[1:43:42] uh Brother Bam just you know kind of
[1:43:45] covered me over and he prayed for me.
[1:43:49] And then after he prayed for me,
[1:43:52] uh, like brother Ed said, I, you know,
[1:43:54] things have gotten a lot better.
[1:43:57] The Lord is really good.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Everything changed.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everything changed.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] Hallelujah.
[1:44:08] Praise God.
[1:44:12] That is spiritual
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; and that he couldn't help. He couldn't
[1:44:18] help it. He couldn't help walking in
[1:44:20] putting on a white shirt.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Couldn't help it. Couldn't help sitting
[1:44:25] in a chair instead of the sofa. He had
[1:44:27] to be sitting in the chair. Yeah. You
[1:44:29] sitting there in the chair, the white
[1:44:31] shirt.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't help but believe it.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And because of that, he couldn't help
[1:44:36] but get the job that he has. Hallelujah.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And the devil tried to take him, tried
[1:44:42] to take this testimony away. tried to
[1:44:44] lay him in a casket too early for life
[1:44:47] and God raised him up again. Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:58] How often should we thank God for it? We
[1:45:00] should never forget it.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; It never gets old. It's the same
[1:45:04] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:45:08] And when he was laying in that hospital
[1:45:09] in Langley and had to look to see if the
[1:45:12] quilts or the blankets were moving to
[1:45:14] see if he was still alive, uh he'd
[1:45:17] walked on it was a Wednesday just like
[1:45:19] this. And we got a call and he walked
[1:45:21] into he walked into the clinic, the
[1:45:24] doctor's clinic, and he said to Sister
[1:45:26] Violet, "Take him up to the emergency
[1:45:28] immediately." And I won't go much
[1:45:30] further. I went in after the Wednesday
[1:45:32] service, walked in, said he's in ICU,
[1:45:34] and I see you.
[1:45:36] I walked into ICU
[1:45:39] and looked like he was in a casket
[1:45:41] and tubes in his throat and and a nurse
[1:45:45] sitting there taking watching the
[1:45:47] monitors and Sister Violet. I said,
[1:45:50] "What happened?" He said, "I don't know.
[1:45:53] What did the doctor say?" He says,
[1:45:54] "Haven't said anything."
[1:45:57] I went out of there so heavy-hearted
[1:46:01] and she said the doctors are calling a
[1:46:03] meeting in the morning and he was up for
[1:46:05] an operation for berscitis in his
[1:46:07] shoulder cuz he's a spray painter and he
[1:46:10] was in such pain and he gotten very
[1:46:12] discouraged and I saw him right in the
[1:46:14] hallway. I can point right to it just
[1:46:16] outside behind the camera there. I I saw
[1:46:18] him go by and I wanted to say something
[1:46:20] to him. I needed to start the meeting. I
[1:46:22] can see he was very very downcast,
[1:46:25] very very discouraged. And I wanted to
[1:46:28] say something to him before I got back
[1:46:30] to him. He was laying in the hospital
[1:46:33] right near death. And in the morning,
[1:46:36] sister I couldn't be there. I said to
[1:46:38] brother Tom, can you please be there to
[1:46:40] this meeting and brother Tom is there
[1:46:42] and sister Violet says to the doctor,
[1:46:44] "Is this going to delay his operation
[1:46:47] which is coming up?" He says, "Mrs.
[1:46:50] laws. The only positive thing I can say
[1:46:53] is that your husband lived through the
[1:46:54] night.
[1:46:56] Those were the words
[1:47:00] and I can't tell you where it was
[1:47:04] and I'll remember it on into eternity.
[1:47:10] And God said these words to me. Tell
[1:47:14] David laws.
[1:47:16] He shall stand in the company of the
[1:47:18] saints and give glory to God.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; He was as unconscious as he could be. He
[1:47:26] was unconscious there in the hospital.
[1:47:28] He was unconscious all night and the
[1:47:30] next day. And I went there. His mother
[1:47:32] and father gathered there with Sister
[1:47:35] Violet, not knowing when he'd take his
[1:47:37] last breath.
[1:47:38] I walked into the hospital and Violet
[1:47:42] came out and I was talking with the
[1:47:43] parents and when she came out I went in
[1:47:47] and they had a had that chrome railing
[1:47:50] halfway down the bed and I stepped up
[1:47:53] beside him and the nurse was right on
[1:47:55] sitting on a stool and she was watching
[1:47:57] the monitor and making some notes and I
[1:48:00] said
[1:48:02] how is he said we're just taking a day
[1:48:04] at a time
[1:48:06] and I walked looked around behind her
[1:48:09] and put my hand on the railing
[1:48:12] and David opened his eyes.
[1:48:16] A little faint smile. Hi, brother Ed.
[1:48:21] I said, how are you, brother David?
[1:48:24] He said, I guess the devil came in for
[1:48:26] the knockout punch.
[1:48:28] I said, but he couldn't knock you out,
[1:48:30] could he, David? He smiled again. Said,
[1:48:34] no, I guess he couldn't. He said, "I've
[1:48:36] been wanting to talk to you, Brother
[1:48:38] Ed." He said, "I've I've really been
[1:48:39] I've been having going through a hard
[1:48:41] time." I said, "I know, Brother David. I
[1:48:43] saw you in the foyer of the church, and
[1:48:45] I saw you were so discouraged." But I
[1:48:47] said, "That isn't really why I'm here
[1:48:49] right now. I don't want to wear you
[1:48:50] out." Well, he said, "I really been
[1:48:52] wanting to talk to you, and I I said,
[1:48:54] we'll do that sometime, but I said, God
[1:48:57] sent me here, and I have a message for
[1:48:59] you.
[1:49:01] you shall stand in the company of the
[1:49:04] saints and give glory to God.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; And all I can say is he went from there
[1:49:12] to St. Paul's and back again. They
[1:49:14] couldn't do anything. And and many of
[1:49:16] you know the account. It's a marvelous
[1:49:19] account. No one has survived with the
[1:49:21] disease that he had
[1:49:24] unless they lost limbs or whatever more.
[1:49:26] And the disease that he had was eating
[1:49:28] up five of his major organs in his body,
[1:49:30] including his lungs and his heart. And
[1:49:34] God, God,
[1:49:37] God, supernatural God.
[1:49:42] This is his work. And he couldn't help
[1:49:46] it. And I couldn't help it. And we did
[1:49:49] nothing for it. God did it. And I say to
[1:49:52] God be the glory. Great things he hath
[1:49:55] done. So loved he the world that he gave
[1:49:58] us his son.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we have. That's
[1:50:03] our father. Hallelujah. And he's the
[1:50:06] same tonight as he is yesterday or 2,000
[1:50:09] years ago or when brother David was
[1:50:12] there. And he can speak to you. And I
[1:50:14] trust he's spoken to you in this service
[1:50:16] this night, this evening. That's why
[1:50:18] we're here. There's the same God.
[1:50:21] Hallelujah. that spoke to the woman at
[1:50:23] the well. Oh, he's the same God.
[1:50:27] I so thank him. And I want you to go
[1:50:29] home tonight with a little phrase on
[1:50:31] your lips. I couldn't help it. I
[1:50:34] couldn't help it. I couldn't help
[1:50:36] believing it. I just couldn't help I
[1:50:38] can't help believing this message. I
[1:50:40] can't help being committed. We can't
[1:50:42] help being a spiritual people.
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Amen.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; My dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It
[1:50:56] is in your glorious and matchless name
[1:50:58] that I come and the people are here to
[1:51:01] give glory to you. We say you are the
[1:51:04] same yesterday, today and forever. And
[1:51:06] oh God, our father, you so love the
[1:51:08] world that you have done these glorious
[1:51:11] things. And when we give testimonies,
[1:51:13] our brother David has again this
[1:51:15] evening. Lord, your name is praised and
[1:51:18] we give you the praise. No man shall
[1:51:20] take any credit. We could do nothing.
[1:51:23] This is a spiritual work. Something
[1:51:25] divine that you send down on the wings
[1:51:29] of a snow white dove. We give you
[1:51:32] praise. We give you glory. Hallelujah.
[1:51:36] We exalt you. We say continue your
[1:51:39] mighty work, Lord. Continue these
[1:51:41] glorious things. And may the people as
[1:51:44] they hear the word, hear the messages,
[1:51:46] may they in the same simplicity our
[1:51:48] brother David and sister Violet have
[1:51:50] done. You have so blessed them, oh God.
[1:51:54] And you've blessed them immensely with
[1:51:55] their sons now, Lord, serving you. May
[1:51:58] they come to know the God of their
[1:52:00] father and mother, Lord, in that
[1:52:02] supernatural way.
[1:52:05] I ask, Father, that you'll be gracious
[1:52:07] to us. We need to see more. We desire
[1:52:11] more. We hunger after righteousness, oh
[1:52:15] God, do so I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:52:18] Christ.
[1:52:20] We give you praise and glory.
[1:52:23] We thank you.
[1:52:26] To God be the glory. Let us just sing it
[1:52:28] together.
[1:52:30] To God
[1:52:33] be the glory. Great things he hath done.
[1:52:39] Don't be the world that he gave us his
[1:52:46] son who yielded
[1:52:49] his life blood atonement for sin and
[1:52:56] opened the life gate that all may go in.
[1:53:03] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let
[1:53:07] the earth hear his voice. Praise the
[1:53:11] Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people

[1:53:32] has done.
[1:53:34] Great perfect redemption.

[1:53:53] could truly be
[1:53:57] that moment from Jesus. our heart.

[1:56:47] dropping down into time to express your
[1:56:49] word, Father. Lord Jesus, how naturally
[1:56:53] supernatural we are. And Father, as we
[1:56:55] would go from this place, Lord, may

[1:57:08] to Lord crucify our flesh daily to put
[1:57:11] that man back into the grave and Lord

[1:57:17] and life into into a visible form into a

[1:57:37] and in our minds, realizing we can't
[1:57:40] help be what we are. Lord, we want to
[1:57:42] yield to you and we want to surrender
[1:57:44] our lives. Lord Jesus, may you
