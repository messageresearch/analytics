[21:55] Oh,
[21:58] come.
[22:00] I'm listening, Lord.
[22:02] [Music]
[22:05] And I I wish for
[22:11] God might
[22:20] [Music]
[22:24] come by.
[22:27] [Music]
[22:31] I am
[22:40] [Music]
[22:45] Lord.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Someone's pray Lord. Someone's pray
[22:53] [Music]
[22:58] my Lord.
[23:03] If you come this morning, Lord,
[23:07] someone
[23:08] Great.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:22] Lord,
[23:25] come
[23:27] here.
[23:28] [Music]
[23:32] Oh Lord,
[23:35] come
[23:37] here.
[23:37] [Music]
[23:42] Hallelujah.
[23:44] Amen.
[23:47] Got a number of prayer requests here
[23:48] this morning. I'm going to ask for
[23:49] brother Tom. It's good to have brother
[23:51] Tom, sister Joanne, brother Ken, and
[23:54] sister Linda back with us.
[23:57] And uh so I'm going to ask brother Tom
[23:58] to come and open the service in a word
[24:00] of prayer. There's a request for brother
[24:01] Louise that we remember brother Hugo Ve
[24:04] Vega. He's a pastor in Chile. He has
[24:07] diabetes and his health is not good and
[24:10] feeling very tired and just need a touch
[24:12] from God. Um
[24:15] there's u
[24:17] [Music]
[24:19] request from brother Chris that we pray
[24:22] the people who gave their heart to God
[24:24] on the street last night in Bellingham.
[24:26] Pray the Lord would keep and strengthen
[24:28] them. Star Brown and Sundance Brown I
[24:31] guess are their names. So I want to
[24:32] remember them in prayer this morning.
[24:34] There's a request from Sister Bev
[24:36] Charman. We pray for Sarah Lawler. She's
[24:39] been in the hospital since last Tuesday
[24:42] with a ruptured appendix. And our
[24:44] brother Gil Ashdown has two requests.
[24:47] One that we pray for a coworker uh who
[24:49] has requested prayer for her
[24:51] mother-in-law who has had a hip
[24:52] replacement, has had to have blood
[24:54] transfusions. Name's Darlene Taves. Also
[24:58] pray uh that for brother Gil's cousin
[25:02] who's very ill with a stomach condition.
[25:04] The doctors are unable to do anything
[25:05] more for her. Her name is Mavis Date and
[25:09] she knows that we're going to be praying
[25:10] for her this morning. Man, if you've got
[25:12] a need this morning, just lift it before
[25:14] the Lord. If you're listening in on the
[25:15] internet or the phone hookup and needed
[25:18] a touch from our God, you just lift
[25:20] before him as we go to prayer. Brother
[25:21] Tom,
[25:25] let's pray.
[25:27] [Music]
[25:29] Father, a very appropriate song as we've
[25:31] been singing. Someone's praying, Lord,
[25:34] come by here.
[25:37] But Lord, there's another stanza that
[25:39] goes, I am needy, Lord,
[25:42] come by here. And Father, I believe
[25:45] there's many needs that have need to be
[25:48] met this morning.
[25:50] And so Lord, with uplifted voice,
[25:53] uplifted hands, looking to you, the lamb
[25:57] of God, our redeemer, our savior, our
[26:01] husband, our bridegroom, our friend. You
[26:04] are our everything. You are all in all.
[26:06] And this morning, Lord, we unite our
[26:08] voices together saying we are a needy
[26:11] people. Needy of a God to come amongst
[26:13] us. Needy of a God to raise us up in
[26:15] heavenly places. needy of a God that can
[26:18] touch us, that can heal us, that can
[26:21] save us, that can deliver us, Lord. And
[26:24] so, Lord, we reach out to you by faith
[26:26] and say, "Come by here, my Lord. Come by
[26:29] here." As I lay my hands upon these
[26:32] requests as Brother Rod has spoken them,
[26:34] we pray, God, you'll come by their way,
[26:38] meeting their needs, how we've heard of
[26:40] great reports. have we been away and how
[26:42] God has moved and how God has delivered.
[26:45] All we say is once more. Lord, let the
[26:48] fire fall amongst us. Lord, let us not
[26:50] get into a lethargy. Let us not take
[26:53] this meeting as a common thing. But
[26:56] Lord, let us be worshippers.
[26:58] Lord, as Elijah did at evening time, he
[27:00] rebuilt the altar. He said, "Lord, I've
[27:03] done all according to thy word. Let the
[27:06] fire fall." I say, "Let the fire fall
[27:08] this morning, Lord. We've done all
[27:10] according to your word. Your prophet
[27:12] said when those doors open, we'll be
[27:14] there. When the minister stands, Lord,
[27:16] we pray that you'll come by his way.
[27:19] Anoint him. Speak through him, Lord. And
[27:23] let the fire fall one more time. And so,
[27:26] Lord, we're asking that you will move
[27:27] amongst us supernaturally in the hearts
[27:31] of every believer this morning. We love
[27:34] you. We love your presence. We love your
[27:37] people. And we say, "Father God, here am
[27:40] I. Speak to me. Speak to every heart and
[27:43] speak to every life." Lord, this is the
[27:46] Lord's day and we give it to you. We've
[27:48] come, Lord, desiring to hear from the
[27:51] throne of grace. Would you break every
[27:54] wall, everyone that is bound, loose the
[27:57] prisoners. Let the chains fall. Let the
[28:00] children of God have victory this
[28:02] morning. Lord, let them open their
[28:04] mouths and worship a God of their
[28:06] salvation. Lord, you're worthy of all
[28:08] praise, all glory, and honor. We're not
[28:10] doing this as a form, Lord.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; We're doing this because of a love
[28:14] service to you. So, we're asking now,
[28:17] vindicate your word within the hearts of
[28:20] your children and speak to us now. We
[28:23] pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:31] You may be seated.
[28:35] [Music]
[28:52] We're uh want to welcome everyone who's
[28:55] visiting with us. We're happy to have
[28:57] each and every one of you here this
[28:59] morning. Um someone's no stranger here.

[29:06] Tucson, Arizona, formerly Allison
[29:08] Nygard.

[29:13] we're happy to have you here, sister.
[29:15] And uh
[29:17] also we have brother um Tamboui.
[29:21] Tamboui. I'm probably getting it all
[29:23] wrong. From uh Toronto. I don't think
[29:26] we've met our brother before. Why don't
[29:28] we get you to stand up? There you are.
[29:30] God bless you. Happy to have you here
[29:32] with us, brother.
[29:34] And uh from down in uh Phoenix, our
[29:38] brother Lucas Rubiki, who's visiting
[29:40] with us. And uh I don't know if Lucas
[29:42] has brother Lucas been up here before.
[29:43] Why don't you stand up, brother Lucas,
[29:45] so everybody sees who you are? Happy to
[29:46] have you here with us.
[29:50] Uh testimony. Sister Hannah Fzen wants
[29:54] to thank to all who prayed uh for the
[29:57] recovery of her Bible. She found it safe
[29:59] and sound. So, we're thankful for that.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] Uh, we've got a group of sisters who are
[30:06] going to come and bless us with a song
[30:07] this morning. Maybe they could come.
[30:09] And, uh, while they're coming, let's
[30:12] sing Light of the World, You Step Down
[30:14] into Darkness.
[30:16] And we're here this morning to worship.
[30:21] Light of the world, you step down into
[30:26] darkness.
[30:29] Open my eyes and me.

[30:44] spend with you.
[30:47] Here I am to worship. Here I am to

[31:00] You're all together love.
[31:04] All together worthy,
[31:07] alltogether
[31:08] wonderful
[31:10] to thee.
[31:13] Here I am to worship.
[31:17] Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say
[31:22] that you're my God.
[31:26] You're all together love,
[31:30] all together worthy,
[31:33] all together wonderful
[31:36] to me.
[31:39] [Music]
[31:46] [Music]
[32:01] [Music]
[32:23] There's a pressure building
[32:26] underneath our wings,
[32:31] preparing
[32:33] a people to
[32:36] fly home.
[32:39] And I feel this difference in the air.
[32:47] Yet his spirit
[32:50] whispers to
[32:52] my soul
[32:55] that with patience I must still press to
[33:00] the go.
[33:02] [Music]
[33:04] be steady.
[33:06] It will strengthen me to know.
[33:10] I've got to be in condition
[33:14] to
[33:16] go home.
[33:19] So I surrender
[33:22] to the fire that brings me change.
[33:27] Holding loose
[33:30] all that I possess
[33:35] in this season.
[33:38] I find rest.
[33:49] Soon the last mourn will dawn on the
[33:52] sands of time.
[33:54] [Music]
[33:57] We will stack our weapons on the banks
[34:00] of heaven
[34:02] shore.
[34:05] But for now, we must polish our sword
[34:11] again, advancing onward.
[34:15] Even as the sun goes down,
[34:20] embrace the heat of battle.
[34:23] Taking back our ground
[34:28] till the captain says you've conquered.
[34:31] Train your armor for a crown.
[34:36] I've got to be in condition
[34:40] to
[34:41] go home.
[34:43] [Music]
[34:44] So I surrender
[34:47] to the fire that brings me change.

[35:21] I will take your hand across the table.
[35:26] There
[35:29] we cry tears of joy for the harvest our
[35:33] laborers
[35:35] reap
[35:37] and the pain and heartache we carried on
[35:41] the earth.
[35:43] Alone they seem a friend now as we kneel
[35:48] before the throne.
[35:52] They served a purpose
[35:55] to ready me for home.
[35:59] I rejoice in the testing
[36:03] for I will overcome.
[36:07] I'm about to be the nation
[36:10] to you.
[36:15] So I surrender
[36:18] to the fire that brings me change.
[36:22] Holy
[36:24] loose.
[36:26] All that I possess
[36:31] in this season
[36:34] are my rest.
[36:38] I've got to be conditioned
[36:41] to
[36:42] go home.
[36:45] So I surrender
[36:48] to the fire that brings me change.
[36:54] Oh, they lose
[36:56] all that I possess
[37:01] in this season.
[37:04] I find rest
[37:09] only lose
[37:12] all that I possess.

[38:53] Sister Resa
[38:56] [Music]
[39:20] When I first began to walk with the
[39:25] Lord,
[39:26] I did not
[39:29] trust
[39:30] him.
[39:33] how he longed for me to understand
[39:40] that I could.
[39:45] And so through the valleys
[39:50] he led me
[39:53] afraid as I could be
[39:58] till I felt his loving arms
[40:04] embrace
[40:07] me.
[40:12] See, I've been through enough to know
[40:15] that he'll be enough for
[40:19] me.
[40:21] [Music]
[40:24] He's come through too many times that
[40:29] puts my mind at ease.
[40:37] I'll stake my very life. He's going to
[40:42] take care of me.
[40:48] See, I've been through enough to know
[40:52] he'll be enough for me.
[40:59] Oh, how could I ever doubt a God whose
[41:06] hands hold the universe?
[41:12] How could I ever
[41:16] question his
[41:18] ability?
[41:20] [Music]
[41:24] There's no place that I can go where he
[41:29] doesn't know the things that trouble me.
[41:36] He's always aware
[41:39] of where I am.
[41:42] and what I need.
[41:49] See, I've been through enough to know
[41:52] that he'll be enough for me.
[42:01] He's come through too many times that
[42:05] puts my mind at ease.
[42:12] And I'll stick my very life that he's
[42:17] going to take care of me.
[42:24] See, I've been through enough to know
[42:28] he'll be enough for me.
[42:36] I believe now after all these years he's
[42:42] been so faithful. He's proven to be
[42:45] true.
[42:47] Never more will I doubt or question why.
[42:53] But I've seen him work before and I know
[42:57] what my God can do.
[43:02] See, I've been through enough to know
[43:05] that he'll be enough for me.
[43:14] He has come through too many times that

[43:54] going to take care of me.
[44:01] See, I've been through enough to know
[44:05] he'll be enough for me.
[44:13] Yes, I've been through enough to know
[44:18] he'll be enough for
[44:22] me.

[47:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Even more than we have need of. Praise
[47:49] the Lord.
[47:52] I'm going to go directly to the word.
[47:56] Have you turn in your Bibles to Romans
[47:59] the 6th chapter.
[48:01] And while you're turning, I'm going to
[48:04] say,
[48:06] see, brother John Stall, God bless you.
[48:10] And Sister Melody and the family is
[48:13] going to be moving up to Fort McMurray.
[48:16] We're going to miss you. We're going to
[48:19] miss you. And I know the children in the
[48:21] school will and the young people will
[48:23] miss your children.
[48:26] But we are wishing you well. and we're
[48:30] wishing you God's continued presence.
[48:33] Uh, and please stay in touch with us
[48:36] often. I know, brother John, you have my
[48:39] email.
[48:40] You can't burn it out. So, just email me
[48:44] and keep us informed. Let us know how
[48:46] things we just pray God's blessings will
[48:48] be on you and you'll be a a testimony.
[48:55] I can tell you as a young man,
[48:59] brother John had a great burden for his
[49:01] family, for his parents
[49:04] and uh we prayed together many times.
[49:07] We spoke many times and brother John,
[49:11] sister Sarah Stall,
[49:14] and the rest of their family are here, I
[49:17] would say, largely because of brother
[49:19] John's prayers. And remember, brother
[49:21] John, the God who answered those prayers
[49:24] still answers prayer.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we say, God bless you. God
[49:28] bless you, Sister Melody, as you seek to
[49:33] bring up the children and be at the home
[49:36] with them and both of you as a couple
[49:39] and rear them up in the admonition of
[49:41] the Lord. You won't have the same body
[49:43] of people here, but sometimes when you
[49:45] have to stand alone makes you stronger.
[49:48] So God bless you.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; I want to read some scriptures
[49:55] starting with the 12th chapter.
[49:58] In fact is um the sixth chapter the 12th
[50:02] verse is what I'm wanting to say.
[50:12] Let not sin therefore reign in your
[50:15] mortal body,
[50:18] that ye should obey it in the
[50:23] law, in the lust thereof.
[50:27] Neither yield ye your members as
[50:30] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,
[50:33] but yield yourselves unto God, as those
[50:37] that are alive from the dead,
[50:40] and your members as instruments of
[50:42] righteousness unto God. For sin shall
[50:45] not have dominion over you. For you are
[50:48] not under the law, but under grace. What
[50:50] then shall we sin? because we are not
[50:53] under the law, but under grace, God
[50:56] forbid. Know ye not that to whom you
[50:59] yield yourselves servants to obey, his
[51:03] servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether
[51:06] of sin unto death or of righteousness,
[51:09] of obedience unto righteousness.
[51:12] But God be thanked that ye were the
[51:15] servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from
[51:17] the heart the form of doctrine which was
[51:20] delivered you. Being then made free from
[51:24] sin, ye become the servants of
[51:26] righteousness.
[51:28] I speak after the manner of men
[51:31] because of the infirmity of your flesh.
[51:34] For as you have yielded your members
[51:37] servants to uncleanness and to iniquity
[51:40] unto iniquity, even so now yield your
[51:45] members servants of righteousness unto
[51:48] holiness. In Romans 12, if you'll just
[51:51] turn over a page or two, Romans 12,
[51:54] we'll just read verses one and two.
[51:59] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[52:02] the mercies of God, that you present
[52:05] your bodies a living sacrifice,
[52:08] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[52:11] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[52:14] to this world, but be ye transformed by
[52:17] the renewing of your mind, that ye may
[52:20] prove what is that good and acceptable
[52:24] and perfect will of God.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Our
[52:31] most loving
[52:33] righteous heavenly father for your grace
[52:37] that has been poured out. How can we say
[52:40] thank you? There isn't sufficient words
[52:42] in the language. We don't have
[52:45] sufficient time on this earth. There
[52:48] isn't enough spokespersons to say it,
[52:51] Lord. And if we would fill the very
[52:53] atmosphere with praises and worship for
[52:56] your grace, yet we would not be able to
[52:59] exhaust what's in our hearts today. We
[53:02] truly want to say thank you, Lord.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And we know that you will grasp, oh God,
[53:07] in your great heart and mind what it is
[53:09] we truly mean. Thank you for redemption.
[53:12] Thank you for the sacrifice of Jesus
[53:14] Christ. Thank you for deliverance, oh
[53:16] God. Thank you for crushing the
[53:18] serpent's head. Thank you for the Holy
[53:21] Spirit that has sealed us into the
[53:23] kingdom of God. And I pray those that
[53:25] have not yet been sealed will be sealed.
[53:28] You are the baptizer. I pray those that
[53:30] are not healed will be healed. Oh God, I
[53:33] pray that all manner of marvels will be
[53:36] done in the name of Jesus Christ that
[53:39] his name may be praised. Bless us
[53:41] together. Anoint us, oh God. anoint me
[53:44] as I stand at my post of duty in the
[53:46] people to hear the word and then when
[53:48] they dis disperse from this place that
[53:51] that seed will bring forth much fruit in
[53:54] Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. You
[53:57] may be seated. You might want to hold
[53:59] your Bibles open while you have your
[54:01] seats
[54:03] because uh I want to just look at that
[54:06] uh the verse we just read the first
[54:09] verse of u Romans 6. Our first verse
[54:12] that we read was was the 12th verse.
[54:16] I would like you to notice
[54:19] carefully.
[54:21] It starts out, let not
[54:25] sin therefore reign in your mortal
[54:28] bodies, indicating immediately that
[54:31] there's a a personal
[54:34] a personal
[54:36] uh this is a personal decision. Let not
[54:41] now Paul would not be saying that if you
[54:44] couldn't do anything about it. So he's
[54:46] saying let not sin therefore reign in
[54:50] your mortal body that you should obey uh
[54:54] it in the lust thereof. And to reign is
[54:58] to have uh to exercise kingly power. So
[55:02] you have the power within your own self
[55:07] given of God to make certain that
[55:10] unbelief because sin is unbelief to make
[55:14] certain that unbelief doesn't have
[55:16] rulership
[55:18] in your in your life in your body and uh
[55:21] and this is important and that you
[55:23] should you do have the power on the
[55:25] other hand also to obey in to obey God
[55:30] rather than to obey unright
[55:32] righteousness and it goes on to say
[55:34] neither neither or neither yield ye your
[55:39] members 13th verse. So yielding because
[55:44] it comes up twice here neither yield
[55:47] your members as instruments of
[55:49] unrighteousness your members is going to
[55:52] be very important. This is the this is
[55:54] actually the theme of the entire service
[55:56] is right here. Don't neither yield ye
[55:59] your members as instruments of
[56:01] unrighteousness unto sin, but yield your
[56:05] members unto God. And so yielding is a
[56:08] deliberate act of the individual. And
[56:12] you have the power to yield to
[56:15] righteousness or to yield to
[56:17] unrighteousness and to and to present or
[56:20] to yield your members as it says in uh
[56:25] in uh uh in the first verse there. Now
[56:29] he says also in the 16th verse, know ye
[56:32] not that to whom you yield your uh
[56:36] yourselves servants to obey, his
[56:39] servants you are to obey. So to whoever
[56:41] you yield, whichever power you yield to,
[56:44] that's the one that you'll be subjected
[56:46] to. And but the yielding part is
[56:49] strictly it is it's clear from all of
[56:52] these scriptures that yielding is an act
[56:55] within our own power of choice. We can
[56:58] yield or we cannot yield. And we can
[57:02] yield to unbelief. We can yield to our
[57:05] desires. We can yield to sin. Or we can
[57:08] yield to God. We can yield to the Holy
[57:10] Spirit. I think of the prophet of God
[57:13] how he spoke of in in respect to the
[57:17] ministry that he had and and and the
[57:21] magnitude of that ministry, but it
[57:23] really focused right back down to a a
[57:25] very small word, yielding. Said, "I just
[57:29] yield myself." Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; So we see this great,
[57:34] incredible,
[57:36] indescribable power and contact with God
[57:39] in this ministry. Said, "Oh my, that
[57:42] just baffles me." But he'd bring it
[57:43] right down to that one word. I just
[57:45] yield.
[57:47] And I got thinking today or while I was
[57:50] studying, I should say this last week,
[57:52] the power that rests within the church
[57:55] of the living God just by yielding to
[57:59] the Holy Spirit of God. What might even
[58:02] take place this morning if each member
[58:05] just said, "I I am here. I'm not here
[58:08] just to hear somebody speak. I'm not
[58:10] here just to see someone else. I have
[58:12] come here to yield my members to the
[58:16] moving of the spirit of God.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; To yield
[58:23] is to give something up
[58:27] to somebody else or to concede. That is
[58:31] to yield. To give something up to move
[58:34] or to bend under pressure or with the
[58:37] application of force. When uh when a
[58:40] person yields to the Holy Spirit, I can
[58:43] tell you, you'll do holy things.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; When you yield to the Holy Spirit,
[58:48] you'll yield you live a holy life.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; When you yield to the Holy Spirit, you
[58:53] can only do what the Holy Spirit does.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You believe that? And so we do not have
[59:00] to yield or allow ourselves to be caught
[59:05] in a compromising
[59:07] position or a compromising place by
[59:11] presenting ourselves inappropriately.
[59:14] Now I'd like you to notice something.
[59:16] The word yield which is used several
[59:19] times in the sixth chapter of Romans is
[59:23] the identical word the same word that is
[59:26] used in Romans 12. I beseech you
[59:29] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[59:32] that you present your bodies. It is
[59:35] exactly the same because as soon as a
[59:37] person presents themselves you are
[59:40] already in the state of yielding.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. And I've
[59:46] been thinking really pondering that and
[59:48] it's a massive subject and I don't know
[59:50] how far along I'll get. But as soon as
[59:52] you present yourself,
[59:54] however you present yourself, you're
[59:57] already in the mode of yielding. So when
[1:00:00] we come here this morning, perhaps you
[1:00:03] didn't consider your as presenting
[1:00:06] yourself, but in a way you have. You've
[1:00:08] come in here and you present yourself as
[1:00:11] a Christian. You present yourself as a
[1:00:14] believer of the message. You present
[1:00:16] yourself, I'm a brother. I'm a sister in
[1:00:19] Christ. You present yourself, I'm a
[1:00:21] young person. I'm a young man or a young
[1:00:23] lady. Uh we present ourselves to one
[1:00:26] another in the congregation. But what we
[1:00:29] really want to do even beyond that, we
[1:00:31] want to come in here and the and the
[1:00:34] consciousness that should be uh uh
[1:00:37] focused that should really be uh
[1:00:40] enveloping our mind is I have come here
[1:00:43] to present myself members to God.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And to do what would be pleasing to him.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; First I present my ears to hear the
[1:00:54] word. I present my eyes to see that
[1:00:58] which is pleasing to God. I present
[1:01:00] myself to God, my members.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; We presented our our mouths and lips to
[1:01:07] worship earlier and I will be coming on
[1:01:09] that in a little further on in the
[1:01:12] message. And so we do not have to I want
[1:01:14] to make the statement again. We do not
[1:01:16] have to yield or allow ourselves
[1:01:20] to be caught in a compromised position
[1:01:24] to by presenting ourselves in an
[1:01:27] inappropriate way. Now, you've heard and
[1:01:29] I've heard and maybe you've said and
[1:01:30] perhaps I've said some, "The devil made
[1:01:32] me do it."
[1:01:35] Well, Brother Bram said that the devil
[1:01:36] didn't make us do it.
[1:01:39] He said in hearing, receiving, and
[1:01:40] acting, he talked about Noah and the
[1:01:43] word of God was revealed to him.
[1:01:47] Even though there had never been rain,
[1:01:49] it had been revealed to him that there
[1:01:51] would be rain. And he says, "What if he
[1:01:54] had just uh taken like that the the
[1:01:57] first scoffer that came by?" Because
[1:02:00] they certainly did scoff at him, and
[1:02:02] said, the first scoffer that came by
[1:02:03] said, "Well, look at that old holy
[1:02:06] roller." He said he'd have throw the
[1:02:09] whole thing up and said my let's quit.
[1:02:13] He said that's the way people do when
[1:02:15] you say I got started
[1:02:18] and the devil made me go back.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He said the devil didn't do it. You did
[1:02:24] it yourself.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; See, the devil didn't make us go back.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't make us backslide. You
[1:02:31] went back.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; See, and the devil doesn't make us stop.
[1:02:35] Oh, he he will come and with all of his
[1:02:39] forces and do everything that he can,
[1:02:41] but you don't have to yield to it. You
[1:02:43] don't have to give into it. You can
[1:02:45] resist him. And I know that he's been on
[1:02:48] all of our cases.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; If he hasn't, he wouldn't be a good
[1:02:52] devil.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Is there such a thing?" Well,
[1:02:55] the Bible says he's an adversary. And I
[1:02:57] believe he's a good adversary. That's
[1:02:59] one thing he is. But you don't have to
[1:03:01] yield to it.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to give into it.
[1:03:04] So he said, "Uh, you did it yourself."
[1:03:07] He said, "Everyone that comes to God has
[1:03:10] got to has got to be tempted and tried.
[1:03:14] They certainly do. A real believer has
[1:03:17] heard the word of God. He recognized it
[1:03:20] to be the word of God. He will he will
[1:03:24] act on it."
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:29] He said, "But uh" and then he goes on in
[1:03:32] the breach. He said a seal talking about
[1:03:36] being sealed by the Holy Spirit. A seal
[1:03:38] signifies security to its destination.
[1:03:44] This is not our destination.
[1:03:47] Bible way is not our destination. Your
[1:03:50] house this afternoon is not your
[1:03:52] destination or any trip you take your
[1:03:55] destination
[1:03:57] believe me must be must be your eternal
[1:04:01] home. your eternal residence. That's all
[1:04:04] we're living here for. And some of us
[1:04:06] may live uh a shorter term than others.
[1:04:08] And some of us may not get through the
[1:04:10] day.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Like brother Brown says, in five
[1:04:14] minutes, you know, we could be a corpse
[1:04:17] in five minutes. We could all be in
[1:04:19] glory.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; That that's our destination.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That is our destination.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So he said we're sealed to our
[1:04:28] destination. And woe unto that guy that
[1:04:31] would try to break that seal. And the
[1:04:34] Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken, but
[1:04:37] some will try. And he says, "You all
[1:04:40] have heard me say that the people said
[1:04:42] the devil made me do this."
[1:04:45] No. No. He said, "The devil didn't do
[1:04:47] it. You just weren't sealed in." So then
[1:04:50] because you because when you're sealed
[1:04:53] in, he's sealed out.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I like that. when he's sealed in. When
[1:04:59] you're sealed in, he's sealed out.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Little story I heard, and I've said it
[1:05:09] here before, so I think it'll be all
[1:05:11] right to make a light moment, but it is
[1:05:14] really bears a truth. They said someone
[1:05:17] was walking down the sidewalk and right
[1:05:20] in front of the church, the devil was
[1:05:22] sitting on the curb and he was crying.
[1:05:26] And they said, "What in the world would
[1:05:27] you be crying for?" He said, "They're
[1:05:31] blaming me for things in there that I
[1:05:33] haven't even got a chance to do yet."
[1:05:37] And you've heard it so often. No, the
[1:05:39] devil me. Oh, the devil is this. And
[1:05:41] because of the devil, and the devil's on
[1:05:42] my case, let me tell you something. You
[1:05:45] don't have to yield to him.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; You don't have to yield to him. And if
[1:05:48] you don't yield to him, he's powerless.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even the devil himself can't
[1:05:55] break the seal.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Make sure we're sealed in.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Anybody that you young people get uh
[1:06:04] driver's license, one of the things that
[1:06:06] you will be tested on, you'll come to a
[1:06:09] certain sign. It'll be a certain design
[1:06:12] and you know, you know what it says to
[1:06:14] stop and you know what it says to do
[1:06:16] some of the other obey some of the other
[1:06:19] signs. But one of the signs will be to
[1:06:21] yield and it'll only be an emblem. You
[1:06:24] have to yield. That means that there's
[1:06:27] something else on its way. There's
[1:06:29] there's something else that's possibly
[1:06:31] coming and you need to give way to that
[1:06:35] that may be coming. And I say when we
[1:06:38] are gathering here in the house of God,
[1:06:40] we're not gathering here just as a
[1:06:43] ceremony. We're not gathering here just
[1:06:45] to put in some time on Sunday. We're
[1:06:48] gathering here because there's a power
[1:06:50] on its way. Hallelujah. And God promised
[1:06:54] where two or three are gathered, there I
[1:06:58] am in the midst of them. So it's not my
[1:07:00] will, your will, my likes, your likes.
[1:07:03] It's what he wants.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I wonder if we can all
[1:07:07] agree together with a a hearty amen.
[1:07:10] Whatever the Lord's will is, that's what
[1:07:12] we want. Let that power influence that
[1:07:16] persuasion of the Holy Spirit of Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ come and be the dominant force in
[1:07:22] this meeting.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thy will be done
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:33] And so the word that Paul uses
[1:07:37] to yield
[1:07:41] is to stand by
[1:07:45] or to place beside to stand by one or to
[1:07:49] place beside
[1:07:50] but now I I'm I'm going to emphasize
[1:07:54] this throughout the service but it is to
[1:07:57] present
[1:07:59] to stand by to be near but also So to
[1:08:02] present oneself, it is to place a person
[1:08:07] or a thing at one's disposal. To yield,
[1:08:12] as we've come to the house of God this
[1:08:14] morning and as we continue to live our
[1:08:17] Christian life, to yield and never
[1:08:19] forget it, please present h present
[1:08:24] yourself to another to be near them to
[1:08:27] draw near to them and present yourself
[1:08:30] to their disposal. Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Whether to unrighteousness or to
[1:08:35] righteousness, either way works the
[1:08:38] same. And whoever you yield to, that's
[1:08:41] you'll be their servant.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; To place a person or thing at one's
[1:08:48] disposal,
[1:08:50] to present a person for another to see
[1:08:54] and to question.
[1:08:57] actually, oh there's so much going
[1:08:58] through my mind, but actually the the
[1:09:02] bride of Jesus Christ has been put on
[1:09:05] display.
[1:09:07] God has actually presenting the bride.
[1:09:11] Now, we're not only presented to to to
[1:09:13] Christ, but we've been also risen here
[1:09:17] in this s generation and presented to
[1:09:20] the world because God will judge the
[1:09:23] world by the word that is being lived
[1:09:26] out in the body of Jesus Christ. That's
[1:09:29] good.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; In Acts, the scripture says of Jesus, to
[1:09:36] whom also he showed himself alive after
[1:09:40] his passion. See, now he presented
[1:09:43] himself. Jesus Christ, after his
[1:09:47] resurrection, after his passion and his
[1:09:50] suffering, now he's resurrected. Isn't
[1:09:54] this the most marvelous moment in
[1:09:56] history?
[1:09:58] Christ God who walked in flesh now has
[1:10:03] risen and the spirit of God has raised
[1:10:06] him from the dead. He didn't go to the
[1:10:09] governments of the world. He didn't go
[1:10:11] to the Sanhedrin. He didn't and the
[1:10:13] scripture says to whom to whom there was
[1:10:17] just a certain ones to whom he showed
[1:10:21] himself. In other words, there he is.
[1:10:23] This magnificent
[1:10:25] uh uh completion of redemption has
[1:10:29] happened. And now who's he going to
[1:10:31] present himself to? He's actually going
[1:10:33] to present himself. And he presented
[1:10:35] himself to this one, to the ladies,
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; to the to on the way to Emmas. He's
[1:10:42] presenting himself. Here I am. I'm
[1:10:44] alive. I'm resurrected. Death is death
[1:10:47] is defeated. I'm here.
[1:10:51] To whom? And I say, "Oh God, of those
[1:10:54] billions of people that are on the face
[1:10:56] of the earth today, the same Jesus
[1:10:59] Christ still." To whom, oh, who it is,
[1:11:02] who is it, Lord, that you're
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; you're manifesting yourself? Who is it
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; that you're making yourself known? Who
[1:11:10] is it you're presenting yourself to?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; We are privileged people.
[1:11:16] I trust that you can sense and do sense
[1:11:21] that it's none other than Jesus Christ.
[1:11:24] And remember, he was missed then, almost
[1:11:27] missed, but he continued with them until
[1:11:29] they recognized who he was.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; He showed himself alive after his
[1:11:34] passion by many infallible proofs, being
[1:11:38] seen of them
[1:11:41] 40 days. Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Not being seen of everybody, being seen
[1:11:45] of them.
[1:11:47] You know, this is an exclusive club.
[1:11:50] A lot of people don't like that, but it
[1:11:52] is an exclusive club. It doesn't exclude
[1:11:56] necessarily. We are not excluded. We're
[1:11:59] not excluding anybody. But you can only
[1:12:02] come in by a birth. You can only come in
[1:12:05] by a revelation. And that is sovereign
[1:12:08] of almighty God.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; We don't have any choosing over that.
[1:12:12] God. It's elective love is what it is.
[1:12:17] Now to yield also
[1:12:20] as I said earlier to stand beside or to
[1:12:23] stand near
[1:12:25] but it's also further to stand by for
[1:12:28] the purpose to help or to suck to be at
[1:12:33] one's aid and that is why Jesus when he
[1:12:36] was getting ready to depart he said to
[1:12:39] the disciples I will pray the father and
[1:12:42] he shall give you another comforter and
[1:12:46] And and the word for yield begins with p
[1:12:51] a r i or par perah
[1:12:55] and that is the one is beside. He is one
[1:12:58] that is your aid. And and the word for
[1:13:01] the comforter is pariclete one that
[1:13:05] moves beside you one that comes near to
[1:13:08] you. And so he said I'll pray the father
[1:13:12] and he shall give you another comforter.
[1:13:14] I've been beside you, but now here's
[1:13:16] another one. He's going to be beside
[1:13:18] you. I'm leaving. And if I don't go, he
[1:13:21] can't come.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; But he will be your comforter. He will
[1:13:26] be your advocate.
[1:13:28] He is summoned to be your aid.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; He's summoned to be beside you. Listen,
[1:13:36] friends, God has summoned.
[1:13:39] He's caused his Holy Spirit to come and
[1:13:42] be near to you.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Not distant, but near to you,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; to stand near to you.
[1:13:52] He's one that pleads another's case, an
[1:13:55] intercessor
[1:13:57] before a judge or a counsel or a
[1:13:59] defense. And that's why Paul said also
[1:14:02] in Romans 8:34, "Who is he that
[1:14:05] condemnth? It is Christ that died. Who
[1:14:08] is it that condemns? Who's got a
[1:14:10] pointing finger of condemnation? It's
[1:14:12] Christ that died. Yay. Rather, that is
[1:14:15] risen again.
[1:14:17] Who is even at the right hand of God. Do
[1:14:20] you believe that?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; You believe he's at the right hand of
[1:14:23] God.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Who also maketh intercession. Not just
[1:14:26] standing there. He's making
[1:14:28] intercessions for us.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Right now, this morning, he hasn't left.
[1:14:36] He hasn't departed. He's there making
[1:14:38] intercession for us. And the very spirit
[1:14:41] of God is not only with us but in us. He
[1:14:44] has been brought near to us. Not one
[1:14:47] that's far. He's a paraclete brought
[1:14:49] close to us as an advocate, as your
[1:14:52] counsel.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To advise you. But now if we
[1:14:57] don't yield to him, then
[1:15:01] he isn't able to defend us. We need to
[1:15:04] yield be yielding to the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit at your side. I thought
[1:15:14] this was really I was blessed when I
[1:15:16] wrote this down. The Holy Spirit at your
[1:15:19] side and Jesus Christ at the right hand
[1:15:24] of the Majesty on high making
[1:15:26] intercession for you. How can you lose?
[1:15:30] I that's a winning that's a winning
[1:15:33] case, isn't it?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; To yield in the spiritual sense is
[1:15:42] usually considered as giving a favorable
[1:15:45] response to the Holy Spirit in a
[1:15:48] service. That's what we think of it most
[1:15:51] often to be in agreement in our heart
[1:15:54] and soul with what God is doing or
[1:15:56] saying. That's been I think that has
[1:15:59] been
[1:16:00] probably the most common understanding
[1:16:02] to yield. Well, just you know and I
[1:16:05] think I want to take the mystery out of
[1:16:06] it for a lot of people because some say,
[1:16:10] "Well, how do I yield? How do I yield?
[1:16:14] What is it I'm to yield to? Is something
[1:16:17] happening right now in the service? Am I
[1:16:19] supposed to yield?" Well, I believe that
[1:16:21] yielding
[1:16:23] involves
[1:16:25] a
[1:16:27] uh whatever seems to be the order of the
[1:16:32] service. I believe that we should be
[1:16:35] attentive.
[1:16:37] I believe we should be deeply
[1:16:38] respectful.
[1:16:40] And I'm going to go into those if you
[1:16:42] will just bear with me and give me your
[1:16:44] time as I uh lay this foundation.
[1:16:51] Now, in the Old Testament, you can write
[1:16:55] it down, but I'd like you just I'm just
[1:16:57] going to read the verse in Leviticus 1
[1:16:58] and5.
[1:17:01] It says, "And he shall kill the bullock
[1:17:05] before the Lord, and the priests,
[1:17:08] Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood
[1:17:14] and sprinkle the blood around upon the
[1:17:16] altar and by the door of the tabernacle
[1:17:19] of the congregation." Now, I'm just
[1:17:21] building this thought.
[1:17:24] You shall do this. You shall take the
[1:17:26] bullock before the Lord and the Aaron's
[1:17:28] sons shall bring the blood. And the word
[1:17:31] bring is they shall present the blood.
[1:17:34] Now, it wasn't just that, oh well, I
[1:17:36] think I'll take it in this kind of a
[1:17:38] canister. I'll take it in this kind of a
[1:17:40] container. God had a set program and as
[1:17:44] they moved in that program, they shall
[1:17:47] kill a bullock. It wasn't another
[1:17:49] animal. It was a bullock.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; So, as they began, they're already
[1:17:53] yielding.
[1:17:56] See what I mean?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; They have nothing to present until they
[1:17:59] begin to yield. But they're already
[1:18:01] yielding. They're taking a certain
[1:18:02] animal. Has to be a certain kind of an
[1:18:04] animal. Has to be killed a certain way.
[1:18:06] And certain ones have to take the blood.
[1:18:08] And Aaron does this and his sons do
[1:18:10] that. And then they will bring that in.
[1:18:11] And of course when when they have
[1:18:13] yielded and done these things and then
[1:18:15] they presented the blood to God, of
[1:18:17] course it was acceptable.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; And the people had all kinds of
[1:18:21] failings.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; We all do. People had all kinds of
[1:18:25] things hanging on them, but when they
[1:18:28] followed through with those things and
[1:18:31] presented it to God, their sins were
[1:18:33] covered.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have, we've heard a
[1:18:37] certain uh message, we've heard a
[1:18:39] certain word, we heard a certain things
[1:18:41] that we need to do. And as we yield to
[1:18:44] that, we come before God and what a
[1:18:47] glorious thing. Say, I could just do do
[1:18:50] a few things in approaching to God. And
[1:18:52] God says, "If I repent,
[1:18:55] turn around, have a change of mind, and
[1:18:58] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:19:01] I shall receive the Holy Spirit."
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful conclusion for a little
[1:19:06] bit of obedience.
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; What a marvelous benefit
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; for a little bit of obedience.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And when you're ob obeying, you're
[1:19:19] yielding.
[1:19:27] Neither yield or present your members.
[1:19:32] A member,
[1:19:36] this may sound very elementary, but a
[1:19:38] member can be a limb of your body,
[1:19:42] a member of the human body.
[1:19:47] So neither yield your members. I'm
[1:19:49] yielding my members now to you and
[1:19:53] yielding them to God.
[1:19:56] And if I didn't feel that I was yielding
[1:19:58] them to the Holy Spirit, I wouldn't be
[1:20:00] here. As one morning, I'd sooner be at
[1:20:03] home and be resting. But I felt I had
[1:20:06] this on my heart. I was even asked, "Do
[1:20:09] you really feel you want to preach?" I
[1:20:10] said, "Yeah, I do because I have
[1:20:13] something on my heart.
[1:20:17] I'm yielding my lips.
[1:20:20] I'm yielding my mouth. I'm yielding my
[1:20:23] tongue. I'm yielding my mind. I'm
[1:20:26] yielding my energy. I'm yielding
[1:20:28] whatever I can to God at this time that
[1:20:32] he may deliver
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; whatever he wants the people to hear
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; as an instrument. And the instrument can
[1:20:40] be a weapon or any tool for preparing a
[1:20:44] thing. And I believe we're preparing
[1:20:46] something. We're preparing a people for
[1:20:49] a rapture. I'm preparing you for what
[1:20:52] battle you may have tomorrow or what you
[1:20:54] may face yet this afternoon. We're
[1:20:56] getting ready.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; We're hearing the word.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; We're being alerted. We're being taught.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must never underestimate
[1:21:05] the power of it. You hear it, it drops
[1:21:08] into your heart.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and the Holy Spirit will
[1:21:11] bring it to your attention by
[1:21:14] remembrance when you need it.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the plan of God. And so we
[1:21:18] yield our members as instruments. I want
[1:21:22] you to notice an instrument can be a
[1:21:24] weapon for good. It can be a weapon also
[1:21:26] for evil.
[1:21:29] David said in the Psalms, "My soul is
[1:21:32] among lions,
[1:21:34] and I lie even among them that are set
[1:21:38] on fire, even the sons of men whose
[1:21:41] teeth are spears and arrows, and their
[1:21:45] tongue a sharp sword." So he had people
[1:21:49] around him whose mouth was fixed to do
[1:21:53] him damage, and their tongue was like a
[1:21:56] sword. He said, "They're around them. I
[1:21:58] sleep amongst them. They're around me."
[1:22:01] He said in Psalm 64, "Who wet who wet wh
[1:22:06] their tongue like a sword and bend their
[1:22:10] bows to shoot their arrows even bitter
[1:22:13] words." That was David's experience. A
[1:22:15] man after God's own heart. I can tell
[1:22:18] you those fellas didn't get much of
[1:22:20] reward. They didn't get any reward from
[1:22:22] God.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; This was God's friend.
[1:22:26] But just because we're sons and
[1:22:28] daughters of God doesn't mean that
[1:22:30] someone won't whip their sword
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; and have their teeth sharpened and to
[1:22:36] grind out words that are painful on you.
[1:22:40] Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; But it's good. God doesn't God doesn't
[1:22:45] promise us a life of ease as such. And
[1:22:48] if someone, you know, if someone uh
[1:22:50] yields themselves that way, so be it.
[1:22:54] That's their reward.
[1:22:59] In Proverbs, it says, "There is that
[1:23:03] speaketh like the piercings of a sword,
[1:23:07] but the tongue of the wise is health."
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Every one of you that are here,
[1:23:17] we have that instrument called a tongue.
[1:23:21] Oh my.
[1:23:24] And it can set a world on fire.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; James says so much about it. Here's the
[1:23:30] word of God. Even so the tongue
[1:23:34] is a little member and boasteth great
[1:23:38] things. Behold, how great a matter a
[1:23:41] little fire kindleth.
[1:23:44] And the tongue is a fire a world of
[1:23:48] iniquity.
[1:23:50] So is the tongue among our members that
[1:23:53] it defileth the whole body and setth on
[1:23:56] fire the course of nature and is set on
[1:24:00] fire of hell. I say one thing to this
[1:24:03] waiting congregation today. If there's
[1:24:05] any member of our body that should be
[1:24:09] yielded and presented to God, it's this
[1:24:11] one right here.
[1:24:14] And we ought to dedicate ourselves and
[1:24:16] say, I am going to yield my tongue to
[1:24:20] the Holy Spirit.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; It is a weapon. It's an instrument. And
[1:24:25] it's can be a powerful weapon. I can
[1:24:27] build up or I can tear down. I can speak
[1:24:31] victory. I can speak defeat. I can I can
[1:24:34] energize people with faith or I can
[1:24:36] bring doubt. I can bring a sunshine upon
[1:24:40] their life. Or I can bring a cloud.
[1:24:42] Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can encourage or I can
[1:24:45] criticize whatever. And I say we need to
[1:24:48] yield the tongue to the Holy Spirit.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Now, presenting oneself
[1:24:59] is to place a person
[1:25:03] or a thing at one's disposal. That was
[1:25:05] yielding
[1:25:07] or presenting. yielding or presenting,
[1:25:10] same word,
[1:25:12] presenting oneself.
[1:25:16] We've had a number of brothers here in
[1:25:18] the congregation that have been in the
[1:25:21] Marines. And the Marines is a, you know,
[1:25:25] very, very
[1:25:27] uh well-known, proud, and I don't say
[1:25:30] that in a bad way. They're very, very,
[1:25:33] they go through very strict training.
[1:25:37] And uh I was just talking to brother
[1:25:38] Dalton while he was here visiting and he
[1:25:41] was talking about the boys in Iraq
[1:25:44] and in the compound that he lives I
[1:25:46] think it's 12 miles square something
[1:25:48] like that
[1:25:50] and he said in that heat which is in
[1:25:53] Celsius over 40° and maybe like 120
[1:25:56] degrees outside he said those boys those
[1:26:00] soldiers those Marines with full pack
[1:26:04] and he said the kind of the kind of
[1:26:06] suits and the outfits they have are
[1:26:08] almost air airtight, he said. And they
[1:26:12] go with full pack perhaps with 90 pounds
[1:26:15] or maybe more, I don't know. And he says
[1:26:17] they run for five miles. They'll run
[1:26:22] around the perimeter of that thing. And
[1:26:24] he says, "Come back." He said, "I don't
[1:26:26] even know how they can begin to do it. I
[1:26:28] don't He said, "I can hardly move in
[1:26:29] that kind of heat, but they have to get
[1:26:31] out there and they have to they have to
[1:26:34] do that cuz they're Marines. They're US
[1:26:37] Marines." Now, they didn't get that way.
[1:26:40] They were some raw recruits
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; like some of you young fellows that are
[1:26:45] here. I'm glad I'm away. I'm glad I I
[1:26:47] got God just arranged. I tell you what,
[1:26:49] I know that things are absolutely
[1:26:51] divine. God just had me birth just I was
[1:26:53] just too early for one war and too late
[1:26:55] for the next one.
[1:26:58] I said, "Praise the Lord."
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; But you go, I've seen pictures of those
[1:27:05] Marines and just when they're standing
[1:27:08] there, you know, their Adam's apple kind
[1:27:09] of protruding out, young guy, two, three
[1:27:11] hairs on it, you know, and just standing
[1:27:13] there and just as green and raw as can
[1:27:16] be, and standing there, boy, they don't
[1:27:18] know what's coming. They don't know
[1:27:20] what's coming. And that sergeant that
[1:27:22] looks so nice, they don't know he's got
[1:27:25] a heavy voice, a lot heavier than mine.
[1:27:27] He's going to be screaming at them in a
[1:27:29] few minutes and telling them what to do
[1:27:31] and telling them what for and everything
[1:27:33] else and and they're presenting
[1:27:35] themselves. And I can tell you their
[1:27:38] life's just about to change
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; because they're already soon as they
[1:27:43] soon as they joined up or soon as they
[1:27:46] accepted say, "I want to be in the
[1:27:47] Marines." Yeah.
[1:27:51] And they stood there. You know what they
[1:27:52] you know what that first act was?
[1:27:54] Yielding.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; They presented themselves and they began
[1:27:59] to yield. And from that moment on, they
[1:28:03] didn't have any thought.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; They couldn't have any decision who they
[1:28:07] wanted to stand beside.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; They didn't have any decision where
[1:28:11] they're sleeping or what they wear.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; You wear that.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And this is the weapon you carry. and
[1:28:19] this is where you're going to serve and
[1:28:21] this is what you're going to do and this
[1:28:24] is and and this is your food. This is
[1:28:26] what you're going to eat and don't say
[1:28:28] anything about it.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; You're in the Marines now.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Eat those dead dry crackers or whatever
[1:28:33] it is. It's good for you. Whatever. I
[1:28:36] don't know. You know, I do know cuz when
[1:28:38] I was on and living in the US Army
[1:28:41] camps, uh I we had some of those
[1:28:43] raations.
[1:28:45] They called them dog biscuits.
[1:28:48] And I'll tell you what, they were indeed
[1:28:51] they were, you know, well, I won't say
[1:28:54] any more about that, but I didn't find
[1:28:56] anything. I never ate a Kration or never
[1:28:59] ate one of those rations where I wanted
[1:29:01] to go back and have another bite. Never
[1:29:04] once.
[1:29:05] Dried eggs and powdered milk.
[1:29:10] Yuck and yuck.
[1:29:12] It's all I can say. It was just
[1:29:14] terrible. Absolutely terrible. I don't
[1:29:16] know why an army that you know a
[1:29:18] government wants to have an army. Why
[1:29:19] don't feed the boys on good food? But I
[1:29:22] guess it's all part of the program. But
[1:29:24] when you present yourself to the
[1:29:26] Marines, when you present yourself to
[1:29:28] God, you essentially lose your identity.
[1:29:31] God's going to tell you who your brother
[1:29:33] is. God's going to tell you who your
[1:29:34] sister is. God's going to tell you who
[1:29:36] you fellowship with. God's going to tell
[1:29:38] you who you shake hands with. God's
[1:29:40] going to tell you everything. God's
[1:29:42] going to tell you what you eat and he's
[1:29:43] going to tell you what you don't eat.
[1:29:45] God's going to tell you how to dress and
[1:29:47] how not to dress. He's going to give you
[1:29:49] the outfit. Can you say amen?
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Because you presented yourself and said,
[1:29:56] I feel something moving. I feel uh a
[1:29:59] conviction and you present. Do you
[1:30:01] desire this? Yes, I do. I have to
[1:30:03] desire. At that moment, you're yielding.
[1:30:06] And from that time on, he's the he's the
[1:30:09] captain of the host. Hallelujah. He
[1:30:12] tells us how to walk. He tells us how to
[1:30:14] march. He tells us where to live. He
[1:30:16] tells us how far to go and where we
[1:30:18] can't go. Can we say amen?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; You getting my point now? And you must
[1:30:25] surrender your personal views.
[1:30:29] I say, "You know what, Sergeant? I grew
[1:30:32] up in the wilderness. This how I use a
[1:30:34] gun." He say, "Forget it. We're going to
[1:30:37] tell you how to hold a gun." Well, I I
[1:30:40] think we ought to have a bigger bullet
[1:30:42] or a smaller bullet. He says, "Shut up.
[1:30:44] You don't have anything to say about
[1:30:46] this." Isn't that right, Brother Derek?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Is that about the way it is? You didn't
[1:30:51] have any choice of what size of gun or
[1:30:53] bullet or anything else. They tell you
[1:30:56] what you're going to God tells you.
[1:30:58] There will be certain scriptures.
[1:31:00] There'll be certain things that'll be
[1:31:02] real to one person, not real to you. But
[1:31:04] God gives you the ammunition.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going to fight. He
[1:31:08] knows what you're going to face and
[1:31:10] he'll give you what you have need of.
[1:31:12] And there is no temptation.
[1:31:15] There is nothing that can overcome the
[1:31:18] believer.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll give you the
[1:31:20] equipment.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; He's the one who's called you into this.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you must surrender up your
[1:31:30] personal views, your likes, your
[1:31:33] dislikes, your personal preferences to
[1:31:36] the rigor of Marine training. If you're
[1:31:39] going to be a real soldier, you're
[1:31:42] required to live under the strictest of
[1:31:45] schedule and obey all orders.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; All orders.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] to work alongside and in perfect harmony
[1:31:58] with the other Marines. I'm sure they
[1:32:00] have all kinds of character uh uh you
[1:32:04] know conflicts and personality
[1:32:07] conflicts. If that's in the Marines
[1:32:11] and we're in the army of God,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; we cannot tolerate they can't tolerate
[1:32:18] it for just a a warfare to to do what? I
[1:32:22] don't know. We're in a warfare against
[1:32:25] the powers of darkness.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And we deny and defy any enemy that
[1:32:33] tries to do anything to hinder the
[1:32:36] people of God from reaching their
[1:32:38] objective.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I say victory in Jesus.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't die to see me defeated. He
[1:32:49] didn't die to see you graveling on the
[1:32:51] ground. He died that you can have
[1:32:53] victory in your life.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And you are victorious and you will be
[1:33:02] victorious if you're not victorious.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Another thing in the Marines, I've never
[1:33:07] been to the Marines, but any of you
[1:33:09] fellas that have been, you can come and
[1:33:10] tell me, correct me if I'm wrong,
[1:33:14] but I've been around enough of you.
[1:33:19] You have to respect every officer.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; You forget to salute. I don't care
[1:33:28] whether he's a corporal or a sergeant or
[1:33:30] what he is. You forget to salute. Listen
[1:33:32] here, boy. You salute when I walk by.
[1:33:35] Yes, sir.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Right now,
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; not well. Hi there.
[1:33:44] Hi, Sarge. How are you today?
[1:33:48] Smarten up. You click your heels. You
[1:33:51] snap to attention because you've been
[1:33:54] trained to do that.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; How did all that happen? Oh, one day you
[1:33:59] walked in as green as a grass of Wyoming
[1:34:03] in your old clothes and they say, "Go in
[1:34:05] there, take all those clothes off, get a
[1:34:07] bath, and have a shave and cut your
[1:34:10] hair, and we'll look after you from here
[1:34:12] on out." You're a Marine, and you just
[1:34:14] gave yourself to it.
[1:34:16] But if you didn't give yourself to it,
[1:34:18] you'd never be that fighting man out in
[1:34:20] the front lines. And I say, my brother,
[1:34:22] my sister, when we came and we gave
[1:34:25] ourselves, we presented ourselves to
[1:34:27] God, we we didn't come here for a
[1:34:29] picnic.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; We didn't come here for that kind of a
[1:34:32] thing. We came here to be a soldier.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I can't stand anything that's a
[1:34:38] wishy-washy dish rag and no stamina, no
[1:34:42] background, no convictions. I said, "Ah,
[1:34:44] forget it. Give me men and women to
[1:34:47] stand for the truth.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Those of you that
[1:34:58] you're not in any army or service of
[1:35:01] that kind, but you studied for a prof a
[1:35:04] profession,
[1:35:06] you maybe thought it over and said,
[1:35:07] "This is kind of thing. I'll give myself
[1:35:10] to this profession. I'll give myself to
[1:35:12] this business or whatever more or to
[1:35:14] this job and you presented yourself.
[1:35:19] Bunch you here are bus drivers and
[1:35:21] different different kinds of work. You
[1:35:24] presented yourself
[1:35:27] and now they tell you they begin to tell
[1:35:30] you what to do, what your schedule is
[1:35:34] and so on so forth. And there's degrees
[1:35:36] of of uh the amount of control. But you
[1:35:40] must give yourself you presented
[1:35:42] yourself. Then you give of your time.
[1:35:45] You surrender up your family time. You
[1:35:48] surrender up private and pleasure time.
[1:35:50] You surrender up in many cases God's
[1:35:53] time. But it all started with yielding.
[1:35:56] You had to yield and present yourself.
[1:35:59] You presented yourself. And that's my
[1:36:01] whole lesson this morning. You presented
[1:36:03] yourself. And that is a form of
[1:36:06] yielding. The same word in the Bible.
[1:36:09] I'm just emphasizing it not because I
[1:36:11] think you're dull mentally, but because
[1:36:13] I want to really establish it. As
[1:36:16] believers, we present our bodies, the
[1:36:20] Bible says, a living sacrifice.
[1:36:24] Now, sacrifice doesn't give a pleasant
[1:36:28] connotation. Sacrifice is something that
[1:36:31] is expended.
[1:36:33] We are to give ourselves, yield
[1:36:36] ourselves, present ourselves to God. As
[1:36:39] far as I'm concerned, and I'll say it
[1:36:41] flat out, just coming here to church on
[1:36:43] Wednesday and on Sunday, that's not
[1:36:45] that's has nothing to do with presenting
[1:36:47] our bodies.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; I believe we present our bodies to God
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; as a living sacrifice
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; every hour of the day,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; every day of the week.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We present ourselves and by
[1:37:04] presenting ourselves, we are already
[1:37:07] commencement to yielding ourselves.
[1:37:11] God called for Moses and Joshua to
[1:37:13] present themselves. Now, I'm coming on
[1:37:15] more onto a spiritual side.
[1:37:19] And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:37:22] "Behold, thy days approach that thou
[1:37:24] must die. call Joshua and present
[1:37:27] yourselves in the tabernacle of the
[1:37:30] congregation that I may give him a
[1:37:33] charge. There is a there is a purpose to
[1:37:35] this. You come and present yourselves.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And soon as they did, Moses called
[1:37:40] Joshua. We're called of God. We're to go
[1:37:43] into the tabernacle and into the
[1:37:45] congregation that I may give him a
[1:37:48] charge. And Moses and Joshua went and
[1:37:51] presented themselves in the tabernacle
[1:37:53] of the congregation. To present
[1:37:56] themselves, once again, as I said, is to
[1:37:58] stand or to present oneselves.
[1:38:02] Present your bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:38:07] And God also called Moses, when all
[1:38:10] Israel is come to appear before the Lord
[1:38:13] thy God, in the place which he shall
[1:38:16] choose, which God shall choose.
[1:38:19] Thou shalt read this law before all
[1:38:23] Israel in their hearing. There's a plan.
[1:38:26] There's a program that God has set out.
[1:38:30] You shall come. You shall present
[1:38:32] yourselves. But once the people have
[1:38:34] presented themselves, thou shalt declare
[1:38:37] the word of God to the people, that's my
[1:38:40] solemn responsibility this morning.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; When the people come, you haven't just
[1:38:46] come to attend a service. You've come
[1:38:48] now and presented yourself before God.
[1:38:50] And now it's God's duty and it's my
[1:38:53] charge or any minister standing here. It
[1:38:55] is his duty to declare the word of God.
[1:38:59] And then it's the people's duty to take
[1:39:02] that and yield themselves to that.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the really the way
[1:39:07] it's supposed to operate.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Gather the people together. God said to
[1:39:14] Moses, "Men and women and children." I'm
[1:39:18] glad we're here. Men and women and
[1:39:20] children. Let the people say, "Amen."
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Men and women and children. All say
[1:39:25] amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; We are here. gather them together
[1:39:31] and thy stranger that is within thy
[1:39:33] gates that they may hear and that they
[1:39:37] may learn and fear the Lord your God and
[1:39:41] observe to do all the words of his law.
[1:39:43] You go back to the just back when I was
[1:39:46] demonstrating uh of the soldier and the
[1:39:49] marines. That's what he does. He comes
[1:39:51] and presents himself. And you present
[1:39:53] yourself and the first thing you're
[1:39:54] going to do, you're going to hear
[1:39:56] something. And where you're going to
[1:39:58] obey it and you're going to learn some
[1:40:01] things that you never knew before.
[1:40:03] You're going to learn how to conduct
[1:40:04] yourself. You're going to learn how to
[1:40:05] respect yourself. You're going to learn
[1:40:07] how to respect your officers. You're
[1:40:09] going to learn how to how to uh h how to
[1:40:11] handle equipment you've never handled
[1:40:13] before. I've never driven a tank. You're
[1:40:15] going to learn.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to fly a jet. You're
[1:40:19] going to learn. See, and you give
[1:40:21] yourself to it because you stood there
[1:40:23] one day and presented yourself. And then
[1:40:26] finally, when that program comes to an
[1:40:28] end, you're a a select few of the entire
[1:40:32] people, but you have a charge. Protect
[1:40:34] the country. Protect your government and
[1:40:37] and you're loyal and you're gallant and
[1:40:40] you're brave. It takes a lot for a young
[1:40:43] man, young woman to say, "I'm here to
[1:40:45] protect my country, and if it costs my
[1:40:47] life, so be it. And thousands of them
[1:40:50] say it and many thousands have given
[1:40:53] their lives for it. They they've said
[1:40:55] that and I think that's an honorable
[1:40:56] thing that they've had to do that. They
[1:40:58] But it all started one day as a green
[1:41:01] green recruit standing there. One day we
[1:41:04] were that green recruit.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; One day we may have been at an altar.
[1:41:08] One day it might have been it might have
[1:41:10] been in camp. It might have been some
[1:41:11] other place. What are we doing now?
[1:41:13] We're getting trained up. We're hearing
[1:41:15] we're hearing some officers. We're
[1:41:17] hearing some that have been through a
[1:41:18] few wars.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To make the way to show you
[1:41:22] how to defend yourself. And I'll tell
[1:41:24] you, there's no army like the army of
[1:41:26] the Lord.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:35] Not only present yourself, but thou
[1:41:38] shalt read this law before the people,
[1:41:41] that they may hear, and that they may
[1:41:44] learn, and that they may fear the Lord
[1:41:46] your God, and observe to do all the
[1:41:49] words of the law.
[1:41:51] I just want to start now
[1:41:55] with presenting ourselves.
[1:41:58] And I'll just begin with presenting our
[1:42:02] lips, our tongue
[1:42:05] and our mouth to praise and worship.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Sometime I observe, I don't want to be
[1:42:11] negative, but sometime I observed in
[1:42:13] people are really caught in worship. And
[1:42:16] there's a percentage of the people that
[1:42:19] they have no they have no understanding
[1:42:22] and no concept whatsoever that I've come
[1:42:24] here to worship.
[1:42:26] And they have no concept that these lips
[1:42:29] belong to God.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; My mom and dad didn't give me these
[1:42:35] lips. God gave them to me.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; God gave me the tongue. God gave me the
[1:42:38] life. God gave me this brain. Whatever
[1:42:41] whatever level of intelligence we have
[1:42:43] and it doesn't take a whole lot. And the
[1:42:45] scripture says, and here's a number of
[1:42:47] them just quickly. There are so many.
[1:42:50] Because thy loving kindness is better
[1:42:53] than life. How many will agree with
[1:42:55] that?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Because thy loving kindness is better
[1:42:58] than life. Thy loving kindness is better
[1:43:01] than life. The next praise is my lips
[1:43:04] shall praise thee.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; And it's not just the odd amen here and
[1:43:10] there. My lips shall praise thee because
[1:43:12] your loving kindness is better than
[1:43:14] life. I don't know how to sing. Well,
[1:43:17] just make a sound.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, praise be to God
[1:43:22] because your loving kindness is better
[1:43:24] than life.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I I I've never done that."
[1:43:31] Start doing it.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; You won't scare me. Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; David said again, "My soul shall be
[1:43:43] satisfied as with marrow and fatness,
[1:43:46] and my mouth shall praise thee with
[1:43:48] joyful lips. My mouth shall praise thee
[1:43:51] with joyful lips." Hallelujah.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; That's not somebody been baptized in
[1:43:57] grapefruit juice.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; It's not somebody who's all soured up.
[1:44:02] This is somebody who's rejoicing in the
[1:44:04] things that God has done. They got their
[1:44:07] focus on the right on the right things.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; They're thinking on the right things.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Is this the word of God?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Because I love in kindness. It's better
[1:44:16] than life. My lips shall praise you.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe the people of God
[1:44:22] need to praise God.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; And if there's ever any people
[1:44:28] that ought to praise him, it's the
[1:44:30] believers of this message. You are a
[1:44:32] privileged people of the whole earth.
[1:44:34] The prophet said, "You're the Exodus
[1:44:36] people."
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Paul says in Hebrews, "By him,
[1:44:49] therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:44:51] praise." The sacrifice of praise to God.
[1:44:54] The sacrifice indicates that maybe you
[1:44:56] don't want to do it. You don't feel like
[1:44:59] doing it. you you had a bad morning
[1:45:03] and Satan really tried to get on your
[1:45:06] case this morning. Don't let him rob
[1:45:10] your Lord of what belongs to him.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I made up a certain way. I
[1:45:18] made up quiet." Well, you can thank your
[1:45:20] mother and father for that, but you've
[1:45:22] been made up another way from God
[1:45:24] himself.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And don't go by your first natural
[1:45:27] birth. go by your spiritual birth and my
[1:45:30] soul says I want to thank God.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I want to worship you.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't boast if I were you that you
[1:45:54] managed to get out of this meeting
[1:45:55] without saying praise the Lord.
[1:45:59] That wouldn't be a good record.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I say something started to move in my
[1:46:04] heart
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; and I just begin to realize I need to
[1:46:08] surrender my members to God.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; I need to even offer the sacrifice of
[1:46:13] praise.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; You don't feel like it, but you do it
[1:46:17] anyway. You offer the sacrifice of
[1:46:19] praise.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You'll do him an honor.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:46:26] Wonderful.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; My mouth shall speak the praise of the
[1:46:29] Lord and let all flesh bless his holy
[1:46:32] name. Hello flesh.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Hello flesh. Let all flesh bless his
[1:46:38] holy name.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna have the musicians here in a
[1:46:48] few minutes if I don't watch out. Glory
[1:46:51] to God.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; My mouth shall speak the praise of the
[1:46:54] Lord. Ezra at a at a certain time and at
[1:46:58] the evening sacrifice I rose up from my
[1:47:00] heaviness. Hello. I rose up from my
[1:47:03] heaviness. Somebody's here is heavy. I
[1:47:05] rose up from my heaviness.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And having rent my garment
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; in humility, I rent my garment and my
[1:47:13] mantle. I fell on my knees and I spread
[1:47:17] out my hands unto the Lord my God. Why
[1:47:21] did he do that? Because it was
[1:47:22] indicative of what was going on inside.
[1:47:25] I fell on my knees and I spread out my
[1:47:28] hands to my God. There's nothing wrong
[1:47:31] with raising up your hands at my God. I
[1:47:35] give you praise.
[1:47:37] Hallelujah. I'll fall on my knees at an
[1:47:40] appropriate moment. I lift up my hands
[1:47:43] unto the Lord. I worship him.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And if you don't want to do it, let me
[1:47:55] take your reward. I'll do it again.
[1:47:56] Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Who is like unto our God? There is none.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; He's the author of life, the author,
[1:48:06] finisher of my faith. He's the author of
[1:48:08] salvation. Hallelujah. He's the giver of
[1:48:11] every good gift. He give me life. He
[1:48:14] give me breath. He give us friends. He
[1:48:16] give us one another. Hallelujah. He gave
[1:48:18] us a message. He sent the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:21] Hallelujah to God.
[1:48:27] Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; David said, "My hands also will I lift
[1:48:35] up unto thy commandments.
[1:48:39] I'll lift up my hands as to your
[1:48:41] commandments
[1:48:44] which I have loved
[1:48:46] and I will meditate in their statutes.
[1:48:50] He said, "Let my prayer be set forth
[1:48:52] before thee as incense and the lifting
[1:48:56] up of my hands as the evening
[1:48:59] sacrifice."
[1:49:01] Oh, let my prayers be as incense and let
[1:49:04] my hands be lifted up at the evening
[1:49:06] sacrifice.
[1:49:10] telling what's going on in the heart.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I stretch forth my hands unto thee,
[1:49:24] David said, and my soul thirsteth after
[1:49:26] thee as a thirsty land.
[1:49:32] Look at what people surrender themselves
[1:49:34] to
[1:49:36] in the world.
[1:49:38] how unreservedly they give themselves
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; and all of their energy and all of their
[1:49:44] training and all of their sports
[1:49:46] activity and and the people in the
[1:49:48] stands. I mean, if you go to see an NBA
[1:49:51] uh ball game or uh a football game or uh
[1:49:55] one of these other sports games, the
[1:49:57] people, they don't just sit there and
[1:49:58] say, "Well, you know, well, you know,
[1:50:00] well, you know, made a touchdown."
[1:50:05] They're they're yelling and screaming
[1:50:07] and come out of there with no voice and
[1:50:10] and over what?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Over a pig skin full of air.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; It's just unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[1:50:20] And here we gather and we have eternal
[1:50:23] life. I I'm not going to pump you up.
[1:50:25] You got to have that in you. I'll lift
[1:50:27] up my hands to God. I'll give glory to
[1:50:30] God.
[1:50:32] Let Let the redeemed say so.
[1:50:36] Hallelujah. Let the redeemed say so.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I need a musician.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; I need a musician. I need somebody at
[1:50:54] the piano.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. If anybody ask you who I
[1:51:01] am, tell them I'm redeemed.
[1:51:04] Glory to God.
[1:51:07] I got to sing a song.
[1:51:09] I got to tell the world.
[1:51:12] We got to tell the people on the
[1:51:14] internet and whoever may hear this
[1:51:17] service, I'm redeemed. I'm redeemed.
[1:51:21] I'm saved by the blood of the lamb. I'll
[1:51:24] lift up my hands as a sacrifice to God.
[1:51:28] I'm redeemed.
[1:51:30] Hallelujah.

[1:52:03] I am redeemed. Make it as a confession
[1:52:07] now. Oh, I am redeemed

[1:55:33] please. And let the musicians just stay
[1:55:34] where they are.
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:42] There was a man by the name of Cornelius
[1:55:44] in the New Testament.
[1:55:46] He was a gentile
[1:55:50] and uh he called for Peter. God spoke to
[1:55:55] him said send for one Peter. Peter came
[1:56:00] and the Bible says that Cornelius fell
[1:56:03] down at Peter's feet and worshiped him.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Now to worship the man is not right.
[1:56:10] It's wrong. However, his action
[1:56:12] expressed his deep respect for what he
[1:56:15] was expecting from the messenger of God.
[1:56:17] And Peter said to him and as Peter was
[1:56:19] coming, Cornelius met him and fell down
[1:56:21] at his feet and worshiped him. And Peter
[1:56:23] said, "I'm a man also. Don't worship
[1:56:26] me." But Cornelius and all of his house
[1:56:30] were saved.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd say that it it it it
[1:56:35] represented something in him. And John,
[1:56:38] the apostle John, when he began to see
[1:56:41] the things that the angel was showing
[1:56:44] him in Revelation 22:8, "And I, John,
[1:56:48] saw these things and I heard them. And
[1:56:50] when I heard them, I fell down to
[1:56:53] worship before the feet of the angel
[1:56:56] that showed me these things. And the
[1:56:57] angel said, "See thou do it not, for I'm
[1:56:59] of thy brethren the prophets,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and I keep the sayings of these books."
[1:57:03] But it showed how overcome John had
[1:57:06] become from what he was seeing and the
[1:57:09] atmosphere he was in. My brother, my
[1:57:11] sister, we need to come to the house of
[1:57:13] God expecting more than we ever had
[1:57:16] before. expecting expecting something
[1:57:19] more than we've seen. How do we limit
[1:57:22] God? Don't limit God. All things are
[1:57:25] possible.
[1:57:26] Glory to God. When I when I hear the
[1:57:29] supernatural, when I hear Sister Debbie
[1:57:32] Lowry's uh examination and the MRI and
[1:57:35] not being able to find the aneurysm, I
[1:57:38] just say, "It's just another one. Just
[1:57:40] another one. Why not? Why not? Why
[1:57:43] should we have another one? supernatural
[1:57:46] things happening. We all should expect
[1:57:48] it.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; I say it with everything that's in me.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; With everything that's in me. I believe
[1:58:00] it with all my heart.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; We present ourselves. We present
[1:58:04] ourselves in conversation. Yes.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; When we begin to speak to somebody, we
[1:58:10] need to measure our words because our
[1:58:12] our conduct and the way we present
[1:58:14] ourselves in conversation.
[1:58:18] Paul said to Timothy, "Let no man
[1:58:21] despise thy youth, but be thou an
[1:58:23] example of the believers in word, in
[1:58:25] conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
[1:58:28] faith, in purity. Be thou an example to
[1:58:32] the believers."
[1:58:34] He's a young man, but it's for all of
[1:58:36] us. Be an example in word.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; In conversation,
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; in charity, that is in love, in spirit,
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; pure spirit, in faith, and in purity,
[1:58:51] till I come. Give attendance to reading,
[1:58:54] to exhortation, and to doctrine.
[1:58:57] Hallelujah. In other words, you've been
[1:58:59] called into the army of the Lord. You've
[1:59:02] been called into this great family. You
[1:59:04] give yourself to reading, to
[1:59:06] exhortation, to prayer, and and and be
[1:59:09] an example. Don't let another one drag
[1:59:12] you down. S be an example.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; You know something? I'm so glad that we
[1:59:16] as believers have the message that we
[1:59:18] have so that we can live the standard
[1:59:20] that God has given us to live.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; It to me, it's a great privilege. It's a
[1:59:25] great privilege that God has endowed us
[1:59:27] with that he he has entrusted us with to
[1:59:31] be the example of this generation.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Just wait a moment now.
[1:59:40] Says, "How can I overcome? Just give me
[1:59:42] about another 10 minutes. I'm going to
[1:59:44] just beat it down." Says, "Now don't
[1:59:46] struggle." He said, "Now him that
[1:59:48] willth," it's not him that wth or him
[1:59:50] that runth, but God. He said just let
[1:59:53] God just yield yourself in him. Now this
[1:59:57] isn't how I can overcome. And three
[1:59:58] times he says it and walk on with a
[2:00:01] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[2:00:03] has promised he's able to perform. Not
[2:00:05] joining one denomination or another. Not
[2:00:07] even joining this church or some other
[2:00:09] church and running this that or the
[2:00:10] other but and trying this. He said just
[2:00:13] yield yourself to God and walk with him
[2:00:16] peaceful, quiet, not interrupted. Just
[2:00:19] keep on walking with him. That's right.
[2:00:21] You just yield to him. And you can't
[2:00:24] yield. The first thing of yielding is
[2:00:26] presenting yourself.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; When you walk in these doors at the next
[2:00:29] service, which is tonight,
[2:00:32] when you walk in the meeting, say, "I've
[2:00:35] come here to present myself
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; to God."
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; And in so doing, I'm already yielding
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; to the spirit of God.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And whatever you shall direct in this
[2:00:47] meeting, here I am, Lord.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do? What kind
[2:00:51] of an example would you have me to be?
[2:00:59] There was a brother that had actually
[2:01:00] had a breakdown. Sound like a nervous
[2:01:02] breakdown. And brother Brandham had just
[2:01:04] talked to him. You know what he told a
[2:01:05] man that just had a nervous breakdown?
[2:01:07] Just yield to God.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; That was a solution. You say, "I'm at
[2:01:12] the end of myself. I'm just at the end
[2:01:13] of my wits. I just don't know what I'm
[2:01:15] going to do. I feel like I'm coming
[2:01:16] apart." Yield.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Just yield to God. Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; In appearance, in our appearance, in our
[2:01:25] conduct, our appearance,
[2:01:29] a woman has been entrusted with a sacred
[2:01:33] trust for life and redemption.
[2:01:36] Characteristics that must not be broken
[2:01:38] or violated.
[2:01:40] By yielding to the spirit of Eden, she's
[2:01:43] enticed to present or yield her members
[2:01:47] to the direction of that spirit, which
[2:01:50] in turn causes her to be defiled.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Now, that was a big statement. But now,
[2:01:56] here's what brother Brandham has said.
[2:01:58] She has now I'm talking about presenting
[2:02:00] themselves because I couldn't even begin
[2:02:02] to get to it.
[2:02:04] You know, when Jesus was here, he said
[2:02:08] these words and some here I was just
[2:02:10] speaking to the other night. You'll
[2:02:11] recall that's why it was on my mind
[2:02:16] when Jesus was asked concerning marriage
[2:02:19] and divorce and so on. says and then he
[2:02:22] he said but I say unto you
[2:02:26] said for the saving for the cause of
[2:02:28] fornication but divorce was granted on a
[2:02:31] on on aa case of fornication which was
[2:02:35] premarital sexual relationship. Brother
[2:02:38] Brandham says Jesus said then but I say
[2:02:41] unto you he that lookth on a woman to
[2:02:44] lust after her hath committed adultery
[2:02:46] with her in her in his heart already. So
[2:02:49] when Jesus was here, he essentially
[2:02:51] condemned the entire mankind because
[2:02:54] throughout the man's lifetime, he's
[2:02:56] going to commit that kind of a that kind
[2:02:57] of a transgression for sure. But the
[2:03:01] women were dressing appropriately at
[2:03:03] that time. The women did not dress as
[2:03:05] they dress today. They all had their
[2:03:07] long gowns and so on. And you can read
[2:03:08] in the Bible, you can hear you can read
[2:03:10] of a a a widow's garment and you can
[2:03:13] read of a harlot's garment, but that's
[2:03:15] all that's about all you read about.
[2:03:18] But in this day, then it's the same
[2:03:20] Jesus Christ coming in this time,
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; revealing himself and speaking his words
[2:03:26] through his messengergers's mouth.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; And so now he takes it a step further.
[2:03:31] And I want to say I want to be very very
[2:03:34] uh uh listening very closely now. So now
[2:03:37] he says he says and he quotes the same
[2:03:40] scripture. If a man looks on a woman to
[2:03:41] lust after he has committed adultery
[2:03:43] with her in his heart, that's what God
[2:03:46] sees,
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:48] But he says, "But if you presented
[2:03:51] yourself,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; if you presented yourself,"
[2:03:57] he says, "you'll be the guilty,
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; You'll be guilty." And and and and
[2:04:03] I begin to realize
[2:04:08] when a person, man or woman, but this is
[2:04:11] a woman's age and it's a woman's nation.
[2:04:16] And now sisters, you just listen
[2:04:17] closely. When a a a woman begins to
[2:04:21] present herself, say, "I'm putting on a
[2:04:22] certain garment and whatever more."
[2:04:25] But who are you presenting that to?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; You see, who are you presenting it? And
[2:04:33] you are already in the stage of
[2:04:35] yielding.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Already beginning to yield. Says, "I'll
[2:04:40] put on this and say, well, what is it?"
[2:04:43] that. Well, brother Bram talked about uh
[2:04:45] and too many times for me to even get
[2:04:47] into being poured in
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; and when you look in a mirror, just
[2:04:52] stand in the mirror and just say, "Do I
[2:04:53] look like I'm poured into this?"
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; And if it looks like you're poured into
[2:04:57] it, then I would discard it.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't take a whole lot of
[2:05:02] intelligence.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, is that on your
[2:05:04] subject?" That's absolutely on my
[2:05:06] subject because because God has sent a
[2:05:09] word to protect you
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; from committing some horrible sins and
[2:05:14] transgressions and say, "Well, you know,
[2:05:16] I wasn't told or I have such so much
[2:05:18] trouble." Everybody, especially the
[2:05:20] women, I feel so sorry because they go
[2:05:21] to the go to the uh racks in the stores
[2:05:24] and whatever more and this is all they
[2:05:26] have. All they have is some tops that
[2:05:28] are like socks. They're like just skin
[2:05:31] tight things and so on. and and uh uh
[2:05:34] pretty well uh sleeveless. You know,
[2:05:37] another word that Brother Bram uses, he
[2:05:40] uses the word strip tease. And I thought
[2:05:42] I would look into that. And this is what
[2:05:45] the strip tease, this is what the word
[2:05:47] means,
[2:05:49] a gradual,
[2:05:51] graceful
[2:05:53] disroing
[2:05:55] of a female performer.
[2:05:59] And of course, the streets are full of
[2:06:00] it today.
[2:06:01] It's been gradual. Brother Brandham
[2:06:04] talked about Clarabo. I showed her a
[2:06:05] picture up here some time ago. A very
[2:06:08] very early uh woman that Satan used and
[2:06:14] and he actually said it kind of started
[2:06:16] with Clara Bo.
[2:06:19] Uh he said and they had a song and it
[2:06:23] was uh
[2:06:25] uh the song was uh something about you
[2:06:29] know show your knees giries or something
[2:06:32] like that. It's a famous song
[2:06:35] and brother Brandham says he talked
[2:06:37] about censorship
[2:06:39] but he says but that was the first one
[2:06:41] they let through. And I thought that was
[2:06:44] so amazing. That was the first one that
[2:06:46] they let through.
[2:06:48] And I I I went onto the internet and I
[2:06:50] found a a woman's a really a putter
[2:06:53] forward of feminist things and she
[2:06:57] revers refers right back to that and
[2:07:01] talks about that's where it started.
[2:07:04] And here a prophet of God is telling us
[2:07:06] that's where it started.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; So
[2:07:10] will you give me some time while I just
[2:07:12] read? I'm talking about yielding
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; and there this is what happens
[2:07:18] now. I'm not talking about godly godly
[2:07:21] sisters. There's a sister that's not
[2:07:23] here.
[2:07:25] And uh I've always thought a sister Jen
[2:07:28] Johnson, they're away on vacation.
[2:07:30] Sister Jen Johnson, a young lady amongst
[2:07:33] us. She's always dressed so admirable,
[2:07:37] so Christian-like, and always I always
[2:07:40] thought that. I thought one day I'd even
[2:07:42] say something, but I didn't want to
[2:07:44] embarrass her, and so I never did say
[2:07:46] it. There's others do as well. But I
[2:07:49] feel sorry for our young ladies that
[2:07:52] have to go and be subjected,
[2:07:56] and I mean subjected. And now listen to
[2:07:59] me. That's been a whole army, the hordes
[2:08:02] of hell.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want one of those designers
[2:08:08] that designed the very clothes that is
[2:08:10] hanging on the rack to have dinner with
[2:08:12] you today.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want You talk about
[2:08:17] perverted. You talk about
[2:08:19] demonpossessed.
[2:08:21] You talk about designing things and
[2:08:24] Satan himself is just he he's he's
[2:08:27] engineering that because he wants you to
[2:08:30] yield your member,
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; members of your body that God has given
[2:08:38] for womanhood,
[2:08:40] for motherhood, but he wants to throw it
[2:08:43] out
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; to the gaze of every lustful demon in
[2:08:47] hell and every man in the country.
[2:08:52] And here's God's great soldier, warrior,
[2:08:55] or prophet trying to warn his people.
[2:08:59] Don't come and stand before God as an
[2:09:02] adulteress. And that word is there to
[2:09:04] protect you.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; That word is there to actually uh to to
[2:09:08] actually deliver you.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; And I know a incredible struggle. It is
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; incredible struggle.
[2:09:18] Let me just read some, please.
[2:09:24] And you know, I didn't really want to
[2:09:26] speak this morning because of my I'm
[2:09:28] just not really well, but I felt so
[2:09:31] pressed. So, I want you to know I really
[2:09:33] felt urged with this.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; In invisible union, he says she has a
[2:09:37] sacred trust, a virtue committed to her
[2:09:40] by her Lord, a certain virtue. All
[2:09:44] sisters, you have a sacred trust, a
[2:09:47] certain virtue committed to you by her,
[2:09:51] Lord, a certain virtue. Nothing else
[2:09:53] holds it but a woman. That's right. He
[2:09:56] said, "And that's committed to her by
[2:09:58] God. And she must not defile that
[2:10:01] virtue. Even if she does something
[2:10:03] wrong, she must confess that to her
[2:10:05] husband before he takes her and make it
[2:10:08] right." Continuing on in paragraph 14,
[2:10:12] notice now he says she has a sacred
[2:10:14] trust of virtue that's been given to
[2:10:16] her, trusted to her by the Lord. God
[2:10:19] gave her that virtue just as it was in
[2:10:22] the Garden of Eden. She can say yes or
[2:10:25] no. She has a sacred trust of womanhood
[2:10:29] committed to her and she must not break
[2:10:32] the womanhood. He says I'm speaking of
[2:10:34] here. He says, "And is her conduct, her
[2:10:38] character around men, not letting every
[2:10:40] man look on these screens and see how
[2:10:44] these movie stars and kissing and
[2:10:46] hugging and slopping over around uh over
[2:10:49] these women." He said, "A woman does
[2:10:51] that is of a bad character. She might be
[2:10:54] virtuous otherwise, but see in her heart
[2:10:57] when those glands, he talks about sex
[2:10:58] glands in the lips and a man kiss a
[2:11:01] woman, he's actually potentially
[2:11:02] committing adultery." And then invisible
[2:11:04] union of the bride again. Uh he says,
[2:11:07] "Now we find out that she has been given
[2:11:10] this sacred trust that she must not
[2:11:12] break of womanhood. Uh have her
[2:11:15] character, raise her children, be
[2:11:16] honorable to her husband." And nowadays
[2:11:19] they pay no more uh not a bit of
[2:11:21] attention to it than anything in the
[2:11:24] world. And he swore by himself. I'm
[2:11:27] reading a number of quotes here I want
[2:11:29] to just get done. He said, "There's a
[2:11:31] lot of women here, and the woman is a
[2:11:34] marvelous thing. If God could have give
[2:11:36] a man anything better than a woman, he'd
[2:11:39] have done so." But he he gave a woman.
[2:11:42] See, show you what's in my heart. Before
[2:11:45] I came to the pulpit today, and I wasn't
[2:11:47] thinking about these particular things,
[2:11:49] but I thought, well, you know, you
[2:11:52] arrive at certain stations in your life,
[2:11:54] and I thank God for my wife.
[2:11:58] I thank God for my wife. Every man
[2:12:01] that's got a godly wife ought to thank
[2:12:03] God for her. That's a gift that's been
[2:12:05] sent directly from the throne of God.
[2:12:07] You thank God for that kind of a woman.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the godly women of this
[2:12:13] congregation. I thank God for you young
[2:12:16] people that that uh display yourself in
[2:12:19] a godly manner. And if God is speaking
[2:12:21] you through the message this morning,
[2:12:23] just say, "Here I am, Lord."
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:30] He said, "There's a lot of women here."
[2:12:34] And he was speaking in Jeffersonville.
[2:12:37] And the woman's marvelous thing. He goes
[2:12:38] on, he said, "But this is a woman's
[2:12:41] world. She's running." Can you believe
[2:12:44] this is 1954?
[2:12:47] That was the year I was married. And if
[2:12:50] you'd have told me then it was a woman's
[2:12:52] world, I couldn't have hardly believed
[2:12:54] it. But here he is speaking speaking
[2:12:58] with a uh with a prophet's character.
[2:13:01] He's speaking ahead of his time. He said
[2:13:04] it's a woman's world. She's running the
[2:13:06] whole thing.
[2:13:10] Not you house mothers here, but I mean
[2:13:13] out in the world. And he said, "Let some
[2:13:15] little strip tease out in Hollywood,
[2:13:18] excuse me,
[2:13:20] out in Hollywood start to cut her hair
[2:13:23] some way." not just cut her hair, but
[2:13:25] cut her hair some way and watch all the
[2:13:29] girls cut their hair the same way. Or
[2:13:32] they start some fad in dress and watch
[2:13:34] all the girls do the same thing.
[2:13:37] Christians and all so-called That's
[2:13:40] right. It's a woman's world. Now, I just
[2:13:42] want to I want to say something here.
[2:13:44] It's not a major part of the message,
[2:13:46] but it's an important part of the
[2:13:47] message that
[2:13:50] you you go to the shop, you go to the
[2:13:52] store, whatever. You don't know where
[2:13:53] that originated. But most of that stuff
[2:13:56] in there, I'm talking about the whole
[2:13:58] cosmetic industry. I'm talking about
[2:14:00] what you use for your hair, it all
[2:14:02] started in Hollywood.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Some woman in Hollywood, she'll do her
[2:14:06] hair a certain kinky way and all the
[2:14:08] rest of it, and pretty soon you just see
[2:14:09] it everywhere.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; But you need to know just where did it
[2:14:12] start? Well, what should I be? What
[2:14:14] should I be, brother Bisc? What should I
[2:14:16] be? Just just be the way God made you.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Just just thank God that God made you
[2:14:21] the way that you are and be nice and be
[2:14:23] pretty and and and so on. But when you
[2:14:25] go to present yourself, you have to be
[2:14:28] very very careful and under God be, you
[2:14:31] know, ask God to give you a whole sense
[2:14:34] of of intelligence about spiritual
[2:14:37] things. And when you when you stand
[2:14:39] before the mirror, men and women, we
[2:14:42] need to know we're not here to get
[2:14:44] muscles to impress somebody.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to get and work
[2:14:48] out and going to get muscle bound here
[2:14:51] so we can go down the street and display
[2:14:53] our members.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; So some woman look at that
[2:15:00] say, "Oh,
[2:15:02] you know,
[2:15:05] what a hunk." That's about all it is.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Just a hunk
[2:15:11] as far as God sees. God just sees worms
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; going through that body.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "You see some
[2:15:19] attractive woman walking down the
[2:15:21] street." He says, "Just remember in 24
[2:15:23] hours be worms just going through her
[2:15:26] body.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Skin worms."
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; It's in the body. They don't inject them
[2:15:35] in, but they'll eat it up.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; For a word is protecting word.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, they some some
[2:15:48] woman will do something and she's some
[2:15:50] new star. She wears a certain kind of a
[2:15:52] garment
[2:15:54] at some stage of her life, whatever it
[2:15:56] might be, and the next thing you know,
[2:15:58] it's plastered all over the papers,
[2:16:00] plastered all over the magazines. It's
[2:16:02] at the cash counter where you shop. It's
[2:16:04] right there. They got all those, you
[2:16:06] know, the People magazine and the
[2:16:08] starlets and all all the rest of people,
[2:16:10] all fallen stars.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; And but they're there. What are they
[2:16:14] there for? Catch your eye. Look, say,
[2:16:16] "Oh, that that hairdo." You know what I
[2:16:19] mean? And then uh you know a Max Factor
[2:16:22] or somebody else will produce a certain
[2:16:24] kind of gel so you can get it kinkedked
[2:16:26] up a certain kind of a way and get and
[2:16:28] then I see I see the fellas today.
[2:16:31] Excuse me. I'm not being critical but I
[2:16:32] see the fellas today and I thought man I
[2:16:34] wish I had a good fast lawn mower so I
[2:16:36] could cut that top off and then just
[2:16:38] really straighten his hair out. See you
[2:16:40] know all up there you know I mean they
[2:16:43] must work to make it that messy.
[2:16:47] They must really work at it. How do you
[2:16:50] How do you make it that messy?
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing. I thought, "This
[2:16:54] guy just crawled out of a log. He'd been
[2:16:57] there all winter.
[2:17:00] Poor man. I should give him my comb.
[2:17:02] Maybe he like to comb his hair." No.
[2:17:04] Might be a little bit humorous, but
[2:17:06] that's what it is.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; What made the poor soul do that?
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody else did it.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Some idol did it. And so he's doing it
[2:17:17] and he's just following along.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe we're just oldfashioned.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; But give me the oldfashioned way.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; The strip tees in Hollywood becomes the
[2:17:36] strip tease on the street, in the
[2:17:38] workplace, in the school, and in the
[2:17:41] church.
[2:17:42] That's what happens because that's where
[2:17:44] it started. It started there. It went
[2:17:47] into the stores and into the shops,
[2:17:48] ended up on the street. It's in the
[2:17:50] home. It's in the school. And that's the
[2:17:52] thing. And that's all that's all you
[2:17:54] have. You just see what's around you.
[2:17:56] And when you go there to buy, there
[2:17:57] isn't hardly anything you can buy.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, men don't have that
[2:18:01] struggle so much. But I'll just give you
[2:18:04] I'll give you Do you want a little
[2:18:05] exercise? Go down to Willoughbrook here
[2:18:08] and walk the entire place or go down to
[2:18:11] Bellisfair. I haven't been Bellisar for
[2:18:13] years, but go down and you go down to
[2:18:15] these big shopping centers. I think
[2:18:17] there's 255 stores or something in a
[2:18:19] Willoughbrook. Just walk down there and
[2:18:21] count how many ladies shops there are
[2:18:23] and how many men's shops there are. And
[2:18:26] by the time you're done, you'll be
[2:18:27] thankful your men are even dressed.
[2:18:32] That we actually found a store to shop
[2:18:33] in.
[2:18:35] There's maybe two or three. And there's
[2:18:37] dozens of women's shops.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; And what is it? Oh, it's the latest
[2:18:40] this. It's the latest color. It's the
[2:18:41] latest something else. The latest
[2:18:42] something else. And I'll tell you what,
[2:18:44] it's been designed by demons.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's just the simplicity of it. And
[2:18:49] then and then what it is, you can be
[2:18:52] sure as as as the prophet spoke it, it's
[2:18:54] been the gradual
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; disroing
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; of her body
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; until I'm ashamed to take men that come
[2:19:04] from overseas ministers to some of our
[2:19:06] restaurants. They have good food but
[2:19:08] dreadful waitresses.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; And the ladies are lovely, young,
[2:19:13] beautiful women. But Satan has enticed
[2:19:16] them
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; and they have yielded to expose their
[2:19:20] members and stand before God as
[2:19:23] prostitutes.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; And you're able to hear, you and I are
[2:19:28] able to hear a word that will bring us
[2:19:31] from that and protect us from that. And
[2:19:34] that is why we should open our lips and
[2:19:36] open our mouth and say, "Thank God that
[2:19:38] you've kept me from that. Thank God for
[2:19:41] the word that you've given me." What a
[2:19:43] protection it is.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:47] [Music]
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of it, both men and
[2:19:58] women.
[2:20:01] And I'm closing in just a moment. In
[2:20:04] serpent seat, he said, "So look here. If
[2:20:08] their grandmother was a chorus girl
[2:20:11] and her mother was a flapper,
[2:20:14] what's she today? A rock and roll strip
[2:20:17] tease.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; What's her ch What's her children going
[2:20:20] to be?
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Does God do that?" Yes,
[2:20:24] sir. God visits the iniquity of the
[2:20:28] children, the generation even to 14
[2:20:31] generations. This thing didn't start
[2:20:33] here.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; It it started a long time ago. And and
[2:20:37] you see what what some of those women
[2:20:40] back there, listen, some of these some
[2:20:42] of these uh women, they don't even don't
[2:20:44] even know what they're going to I wish I
[2:20:46] had something here. I forgot to get it
[2:20:48] printed for you.
[2:20:50] But some this one woman wrote about
[2:20:53] Clarabo and she mentioned another woman
[2:20:55] and she said and this woman had and this
[2:20:58] girl said had lovely thick long braids,
[2:21:02] blond braids. And she said to her,
[2:21:05] "Daddy, I'm going to cut my hair. I'm
[2:21:07] going to cut this off." That was just at
[2:21:08] the beginning. And this is way back in
[2:21:11] the very early 1900s. I'm going to cut
[2:21:13] my hair. He said, "Don't you dare." And
[2:21:16] this woman was this woman was writing
[2:21:19] about another woman and she said, "But
[2:21:21] this this other girl said,"I going to
[2:21:23] cut my hair." And she went and cut her
[2:21:25] hair. And her daddy just said, "Well,
[2:21:26] that's cute." That's all he said. And
[2:21:28] and she was expecting a great big ruckus
[2:21:30] in the home over because she had
[2:21:32] beautiful, beautiful long hair. And then
[2:21:35] and then they began to talk about the
[2:21:36] song of Clarabo and and you know, uh,
[2:21:39] roll them up girlies. Roll them up and
[2:21:41] show your pretty little knees. And uh
[2:21:44] your daddy and your mommy will say
[2:21:45] something, but you just say, "Haha."
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's the words to the song. Your
[2:21:50] mother and dad will say uh something
[2:21:52] against it and but you just say, "Haha."
[2:21:55] Ain't that amazing? A prophet will say,
[2:21:57] "That's the spirit of the age."
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of America. Haha.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I had you standing up rejoicing
[2:22:08] a few minutes ago.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; But you ought to rejoice of this, too.
[2:22:12] This is a great protection.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; A great protection.
[2:22:18] And he said, "What's her children going
[2:22:20] to be?" And then just a little further
[2:22:23] in in serpent seed, he said, "What was
[2:22:25] the seed of the serpent?" He said,
[2:22:26] "Adulter." You follow it? Adultery with
[2:22:28] Eve. What happened to that? What brought
[2:22:31] that forth? What is it tonight? He said,
[2:22:34] "Uh, they used to censor songs
[2:22:37] before they'd let them be sung on the
[2:22:39] radio." And the first one come out was
[2:22:42] that roll them. Roll them girlies. Roll
[2:22:45] them. Show your pretty knees and all of
[2:22:48] that. Laugh at Paw and Ma and give them
[2:22:51] a haha.
[2:22:54] Laugh at M and Pa because they're the
[2:22:56] ones that didn't want it. They're the
[2:22:58] ones that were trying to stand against
[2:23:00] it. And give them a haha.
[2:23:03] He said that's the first one that they
[2:23:06] let slip through.
[2:23:08] You think we didn't have a prophet
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; and you can go back, you can go on the
[2:23:13] internet and you can get those people
[2:23:15] that write on those things and they will
[2:23:17] pin it right back to that very time
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; and to these same women
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; and he says where do you think the guy
[2:23:28] is tonight that wrote that song?
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; He's dead. What do you think of Clarabo
[2:23:36] who come out the first one said she said
[2:23:39] and and this curve this uh phrase the
[2:23:42] dangerous curves
[2:23:45] and the strip tease that sent thousands
[2:23:48] of souls to hell. Where do you think she
[2:23:50] is tonight?
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; She's been dead for a long time. Where's
[2:23:54] she at when that body of hers laying
[2:23:57] yonder, cankered in the dust, and the
[2:24:00] worms and the maggots has eat through it
[2:24:02] and her soul lays yonder before a just
[2:24:05] God. I say praise be to God
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; that set us a word,
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; set us a standard.
[2:24:14] Hallelujah. I feel like let my lips
[2:24:17] rejoice and praise him for the
[2:24:20] protection of the word. My brother, my
[2:24:22] sister, just think what it is. And I I
[2:24:25] have a little bit of a sense. I have a
[2:24:27] little bit of a conscience standing in
[2:24:29] the presence of of of brother Brandham.
[2:24:31] And that angel of the Lord came there. I
[2:24:33] tell you the first thought that went
[2:24:35] through my mind, I am naked.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; There is nothing I can hide.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hide me, rock of ages.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me be hidden.
[2:24:48] Yes,
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; you young people especially, I felt it
[2:24:51] so much on my heart.
[2:24:54] Let it be known to you that God is
[2:24:57] giving us this kind of word that you
[2:24:58] will yield yourself the the moment the
[2:25:01] moment you begin to uh uh present
[2:25:04] yourself.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; That is the first stage of yielding.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; And so then you're yielding to the
[2:25:10] spirit that even designed the thing men
[2:25:13] and women both all kinds of things. I
[2:25:16] take very very great care when I
[2:25:18] personally go shopping. I find men my
[2:25:21] age. I think that they've got their
[2:25:22] second childhood too early, prematurely.
[2:25:25] They're wanting to act like they're 15
[2:25:27] or 16 or 18 or 20 once again.
[2:25:32] Oh, what an age we're living in. Thank
[2:25:34] God for deliverance.
[2:25:42] Now,
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; I know this is going to come sideways to
[2:25:43] you. Our
[2:25:52] Lord Jesus,
[2:25:54] he prophesied and he said, "In the day
[2:25:56] when you see Sodom and Gomorrah again,
[2:26:01] that'll be the day that I will come and
[2:26:02] reveal myself."
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; And I think of the vessel that he chose
[2:26:08] to reveal himself in. You know, brother
[2:26:11] Brandon was a handsome man.
[2:26:14] You know, a very handsome man.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; I say he was striking
[2:26:21] and he had black wavy curly hair before
[2:26:25] he lost it. And he didn't lose it
[2:26:27] naturally. He told me about losing it.
[2:26:30] He could have sued the man. He lost it
[2:26:32] through a barber, but he lost his hair
[2:26:35] early. All fell out in just a short
[2:26:37] time. He was a very handsome man.
[2:26:41] in his young life and to hear him speak
[2:26:44] straight the way that he did in the age
[2:26:47] that he was in.
[2:26:50] I tell you what, friends.
[2:26:52] And then and then I'm closing now. And
[2:26:55] then God in his great intelligence said,
[2:26:59] I want to present myself.
[2:27:02] I want to present myself to a people.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:07] and the way I will present myself,
[2:27:12] they'll see something
[2:27:14] that induces them to yield.
[2:27:18] And here come a little man
[2:27:21] and his humility
[2:27:23] was so
[2:27:26] it was so great.
[2:27:29] His humility.
[2:27:31] He come said, "Good evening friends."
[2:27:36] and speak so kindly to the people and
[2:27:39] and and knowing the man knowing that in
[2:27:42] a few moments the very pillar of fire
[2:27:45] that was back with Moses 4,000 years ago
[2:27:48] in a bush is going to be right beside
[2:27:49] him
[2:27:51] and yet to just be that humble and speak
[2:27:54] to the people. But you know why he had
[2:27:56] to be that way? Because he had to
[2:27:57] present he had to present Jesus Christ
[2:28:02] to the to a certain group of people. And
[2:28:04] now you that are here today, let me say
[2:28:07] in closing,
[2:28:10] I can't I cannot estimate. I cannot
[2:28:14] grasp
[2:28:15] even though I try the grace and the love
[2:28:19] of God that there were multitudes and
[2:28:21] multitudes that heard it and it didn't
[2:28:24] attract them. There was nothing that
[2:28:27] brought a yielding of them. There was
[2:28:30] nothing that appealed to them. But there
[2:28:32] was a few. There was one here and one
[2:28:34] there. And you one here and one there.
[2:28:36] You've gathered here into quite a group
[2:28:38] of people tonight. We have something in
[2:28:40] common.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; We have something in common. You young
[2:28:44] fellows that are here, you young ladies
[2:28:46] and the congregation that is here, you
[2:28:47] in the balcony, we have something in
[2:28:49] common. You were attracted by the same
[2:28:52] thing I was attracted to. You were
[2:28:54] attracted to the same thing the one next
[2:28:56] to you. You children and young people
[2:28:57] have been born in the message. And one
[2:28:59] day God came by your way. But let it be
[2:29:02] known that you were attracted to
[2:29:03] something and you say, "What was I
[2:29:05] attracted to?" You're attracted to one
[2:29:06] who came and presented himself to you.
[2:29:08] Here I am.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; And that is why I tell you what, I break
[2:29:15] down.
[2:29:17] I break down just hearing
[2:29:21] a woman standing there
[2:29:24] and and brother Brandon then he turns
[2:29:32] Isn't he lovely?
[2:29:35] When he said those words,
[2:29:38] it was like as though he had just
[2:29:40] stepped out of his presence.
[2:29:42] It was just like he just stepped out of
[2:29:44] his presence like the Lord Jesus right
[2:29:45] there. Like he just been seeing him and
[2:29:48] he had to now turn to this woman and you
[2:29:50] know and it seemed like he couldn't say
[2:29:51] anything else. He says, "Isn't he
[2:29:54] lovely?" Amen.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, when when
[2:29:59] Jesus presented himself to me in a
[2:30:02] vessel that could have that kind of a
[2:30:04] relationship, I thirst and I hunger
[2:30:07] after that kind of relationship. And I
[2:30:09] don't want to settle for anything less.
[2:30:10] And it's for you.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; It's for you. It's for you young people.
[2:30:14] It's for you that might have said, "I
[2:30:16] feel so dry." But I'll tell you what,
[2:30:18] he's very lovely and he's right near us
[2:30:20] and he's looking for a response from
[2:30:22] you. You just want to respond with your
[2:30:24] heart and you say, "What can I do?" The
[2:30:26] first thing you can do, you can give
[2:30:27] your lips and say, "I'll praise him.
[2:30:29] I'll give my tongue. I'll give you
[2:30:31] praise. I'm going to lift my hands. I'm
[2:30:34] going to exalt you. And Lord Jesus, I'm
[2:30:36] I'm not going to be ashamed to fall on
[2:30:38] my knees and tell you I love you. And
[2:30:40] I'm not ashamed of my voice. I'm going
[2:30:42] to let others hear it because you
[2:30:44] presented yourself to me. And and now
[2:30:47] I've yielded to you. And I surrender up
[2:30:49] my members." I wonder if we can stand. I
[2:30:52] give you all that I am, all that I ever
[2:30:54] can be. Oh God, I give it to you. I
[2:30:57] surrender my members. Would you do that
[2:30:59] this morning in a in a total surrender
[2:31:01] to him? All that I All that I am.
[2:31:05] [Music]
[2:31:11] All that I am.
[2:31:16] All
[2:31:17] I shall ever
[2:31:20] be.
[2:31:25] We cannot
[2:31:32] [Applause]
[2:31:34] [Music]
[2:31:38] surrender
[2:31:39] to thee
[2:31:43] today.
[2:31:45] All that I am.
[2:31:50] All
[2:31:53] [Music]
[2:31:56] I shall ever
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:09] love that I
[2:32:16] surrender
[2:32:17] to thee. All he wants is me.
[2:32:26] All
[2:32:28] he wants
[2:32:30] is
[2:32:31] [Music]
[2:32:40] will

[2:32:49] height.
[2:32:53] power.

[2:32:56] he wants
[2:32:59] is all
[2:33:01] I need.
[2:33:04] All he wants
[2:33:08] is

[2:33:17] Unreservedly every member
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:30] not just a part.
[2:33:34] He wants all
[2:33:37] my heart.

[2:33:43] is all
[2:33:46] I need.
[2:33:49] All
[2:33:50] he wants
[2:33:53] is
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed.
[2:33:57] [Music]
[2:33:59] My dear friends, brothers and sisters,
[2:34:01] as I
[2:34:03] spoke this morning, I'm praying that God
[2:34:06] will just take the words and suit it
[2:34:10] right to your heart. Don't worry about
[2:34:12] the questions. Well, what should I do?
[2:34:14] Just just yield. just yield. If you'll
[2:34:18] yield and say, "Here I am, Lord."
[2:34:21] And I pray that the Holy Spirit will now
[2:34:24] just brood. I've done my part, and now I
[2:34:28] know that he'll do his part. And all
[2:34:31] he's asking and all he's wanting is just
[2:34:33] us to draw nearer to him. And let let
[2:34:37] the word, if there's been a a real
[2:34:40] conviction there, just surrender to it.
[2:34:42] Say, "Oh, God."
[2:34:45] You that perhaps have never practiced to
[2:34:48] open your mouth and to praise God.
[2:34:51] Believe me, it's a big part of the
[2:34:53] scriptures.
[2:34:55] Give him thanks. We give you thanks,
[2:34:58] Lord. We lift you up, oh God. Father,
[2:35:03] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[2:35:07] God of the prophets,
[2:35:10] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:35:13] God of Israel, God of the apostles, and
[2:35:17] you're the God who visited us in this
[2:35:19] time. You are that living God. You stood
[2:35:22] by the prophet of God, Lord, and how you
[2:35:26] trusted him. how we appreciate the
[2:35:29] messengergers's
[2:35:31] un undying and undaunted and
[2:35:34] uncompromising way. Oh God, we thank you
[2:35:37] for the word that you have sent.
[2:35:40] And Lord, I thank you especially for the
[2:35:43] people that have responded to it at at
[2:35:47] in a different way. You spoke in to one
[2:35:50] in one way, you spoke to another. You've
[2:35:52] brought in families. And here we stand
[2:35:54] today standing redeemed.
[2:35:58] We're standing here, Lord, to live a
[2:36:00] life that's glorious
[2:36:02] before the world, before our associates,
[2:36:06] before our friends, before our peers.
[2:36:09] And I'm asking that you'll keep the
[2:36:10] fires, oh God, of the Holy Spirit
[2:36:14] burning with a brilliant flame. And may
[2:36:16] the lives be so quickened from service
[2:36:20] to service. I even ask that tonight, oh
[2:36:23] God, you will take, Father, and just
[2:36:25] grace this day with a mighty visitation.
[2:36:28] And Father, for whatever you would do
[2:36:30] throughout as a result of this service,
[2:36:32] throughout the day, let the people
[2:36:34] ponder and let them just be so thankful
[2:36:37] that you come by our way, Lord, service
[2:36:40] after service. And now, Lord, I pray
[2:36:43] that you will dismiss us with your grace
[2:36:46] and send us from this place with joy and
[2:36:50] thanksgiving in our heart. We give you
[2:36:52] praise now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:36:55] Amen. I I would like to as you're just

[2:40:44] Jesus name. Greet one another. Be sure
[2:40:47] and greet brother John and sister
[2:40:49] Melody. And give them a good farewell
[2:40:53] hug. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
