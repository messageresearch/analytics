[10:03] felt like a shattered and broken vessel?
[10:07] Aren't you thankful that the potter

[10:21] Not just put us back together in our old
[10:23] condition, but put us back together in

[10:30] a real vessel. That's what I'm looking
[10:33] at this morning. real vessels that God
[10:35] has touched. Amen. Brother Kyle Morton,
[10:38] would you come this morning, Brother
[10:40] Kyle, and open the service in a word of
[10:42] prayer? We're gonna have brother Andrew
[10:44] so graciously is going to take our offer
[10:47] to sing that song again this morning.
[10:51] So, if he's gets ready just after we
[10:53] pray and take up the offering, we'll
[10:55] have brother Andrew sing and then we're
[10:57] going to turn the service as quickly as
[10:58] I as we can to our pastor this morning.
[11:01] Trust that you've come expecting. I know
[11:03] I have just trusting that the Lord would
[11:05] minister to us once again through his
[11:08] servant. We want to read a quick uh
[11:11] continued prayer request but a testimony
[11:13] on behalf of Sister Eleanor Drake for
[11:15] all of your prayers for brother John
[11:17] Drake. Please continue to pray for
[11:19] brother John that a complete healing
[11:21] take place. God is working on John's
[11:24] behalf and may his perfect will be
[11:26] accomplished in this situation. And so
[11:28] we want to continue to remember brother
[11:30] John Drake and the family there. If you
[11:34] have a need upon your heart, why don't
[11:35] you lift it before the Lord as we go to
[11:37] prayer this morning? Brother Kyle.
[11:40] [Music]
[11:44] Lord Jesus, we love you. We're so
[11:46] thankful to be here again this day,
[11:47] Lord. To come from Victoria, Seattle
[11:50] locally, Lord Jesus. Maybe some guests
[11:53] in our midst, too, Lord. And we're
[11:55] thankful to be here, Lord Jesus. Help us
[11:57] make use of the opportunity, Lord, to
[11:59] once more come and to sit at your feet,
[12:01] Lord. Father, we can sit at your feet
[12:03] when we're at home and when we're at
[12:05] work, but when we come together with
[12:07] brothers and sisters, there's such
[12:08] something extra special about it, Lord.
[12:10] So, may you help our hearts and help our
[12:12] minds just come, Lord, and increase our
[12:14] expectation and our faith even now,
[12:16] Lord. Do a supernatural work in our
[12:18] hearts, Lord. We don't want to muster up
[12:20] our own spirituality. We want you to
[12:22] come and take control, Lord. Take
[12:24] charge, God. There's needs and there's
[12:26] burdens, Lord. And there's circumstances
[12:27] that we all face. But you're more than
[12:29] able, Lord.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Help us not sherk and and shrink, Lord,
[12:33] from things that seem tough, knowing
[12:35] nothing's too hard for you, Lord.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing in our lives, nothing in our
[12:38] bodies is too hard for you, Lord. Let
[12:41] the faith begin to multiply and grow.
[12:43] Even now, Lord, where all those things
[12:45] look so small, Lord Jesus, as we worship
[12:47] you and as the word comes forth, Lord,
[12:50] let those troubles and problems and
[12:51] trials just begin smaller and smaller.
[12:53] Lord, you're so good. Lord Jesus, we
[12:56] love you. Heavenly Father,
[12:58] &gt;&gt; oh God, we want you to be glorified this
[13:00] day, Lord Jesus. We're excited. May you
[13:02] take control of Brother Ed, Brother Tom,
[13:04] Lord, and the deacons, and the different
[13:06] uh ones who'll be participating for the
[13:08] communion service this evening, Lord.
[13:10] Oh, Father, we're so thankful that you
[13:12] allowed us again to come here. And Lord,
[13:15] I was just thinking as I was walking up
[13:16] here, Lord, even when we're not
[13:18] faithful, you're still faithful, Lord
[13:19] Jesus. We love you, Lord. Just take
[13:22] control. We pray. We're excited. Lord,
[13:25] oh Jesus, bless your holy name. We love
[13:28] you, Father. There's none like you,
[13:29] Lord. Continue to move in our families,
[13:32] Lord Jesus. Surprise us, God. Oh,
[13:35] Father, let your spirit ripple out
[13:36] through the neighborhood, Lord. Touch
[13:38] our wayward loved ones. We pray, Father.
[13:41] Oh, God. You can do anything, Lord. We
[13:44] love you, Lord. Even as we pray, Lord,
[13:46] things happen, Lord Jesus. Even when we
[13:48] go to open up our mouth, Lord, things
[13:50] come out we didn't expect, God.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, there's none like you, Father.
[13:54] You stand alone, Lord. You haven't
[13:56] diminished in glory. Your power.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, have your way. We pray.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, have your way today, Lord.
[14:03] We're committed to you in Jesus name.
[14:05] Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. As you
[14:09] have your seats and the deacons receive
[14:11] the tithes and offerings this morning,
[14:13] we can sing together. Hold to God's
[14:15] unchanging hand.
[14:17] Just as musicians are getting ready for
[14:20] the special, we'll sing this. And we
[14:21] certainly want to greet those that are
[14:23] on the telephone hookup and the internet
[14:25] this morning. Say, "God bless you to
[14:26] you." Amen. It's a good day. Amen.
[14:30] Looking forward to the communion service
[14:32] this evening. We're going to start at
[14:33] 4:00 sharp, Lord willing. Just looking
[14:36] forward to a real wonderful time. Let's
[14:38] sing this together.

[19:13] would reach down his hand
[19:18] and do this for me.
[19:24] For me.
[19:26] I'm so unworthy
[19:30] to live
[19:32] and offer

[25:48] Gracious and loving heavenly father,
[25:51] we are gathered here to hear words from
[25:54] you. We want to hear heavenly things.
[25:59] Uh we pray that you will send a divine
[26:03] uncction upon the people upon the
[26:06] speaker.
[26:08] We pray father in the name of Jesus
[26:11] Christ that you will elevate us in
[26:13] revelation into heavenly places in
[26:16] Christ Jesus the believer's position. We
[26:20] all have an individual position. We have
[26:22] a place and we pray that you'll move us
[26:25] into that place. I pray that you will so
[26:28] quieten the people that there will not
[26:30] be distractions or movement. I pray,
[26:33] Father, that you will take charge of the
[26:36] service for your glory. May it glorify
[26:40] you. This is the only thing we desire.
[26:44] And Lord, we know that there has been
[26:45] prayer already made. And I'm praying for
[26:48] Sister Heidi Neighbor, oh God, that you
[26:51] will strengthen her. I pray, oh God, you
[26:54] will remove the pain and suffering and
[26:57] that you'll give her a speedy recovery
[27:00] in the name of Jesus Christ. We just ask
[27:03] your blessings now upon this day, upon
[27:06] the uh communion this evening. Pray,
[27:10] Father, you'll prepare our hearts in
[27:13] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[27:16] Amen.
[27:21] going to be a little different service
[27:23] this morning and
[27:25] uh I want to ask you to uh
[27:30] not look upon it as another preaching
[27:33] service as such but I want you to be
[27:35] able to absorb things that I personally
[27:38] have absorbed and has been a great
[27:40] blessing more than blessing has been a
[27:43] strength has been a guiding light I
[27:47] would think in my own life and in the
[27:50] lives of others. And these are things
[27:52] that are uh that are have been laid out
[27:56] for us in the word of God. And you know
[27:59] the message the prophet of God said one
[28:02] place that the Bible have become a new
[28:04] book.
[28:06] And uh I pray that it'll become a new
[28:09] book to us.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Uh in spite of what you've seen in the
[28:12] past, may it become greater and greater.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe you can do that?
[28:19] And I particularly want to try to convey
[28:23] uh without losing you, I want to look at
[28:26] the aspect of God's
[28:31] uh
[28:32] the being of God and and how incapable
[28:36] we are to understand or grasp him
[28:39] because of some things that the prophet
[28:42] has said very clearly. Said he's he's so
[28:45] great he'd be too mysterious. So when I
[28:48] get on that side, don't don't just
[28:50] become quiet, but absorb those absorb
[28:54] the phrases.
[28:56] Uh I'll I'll uh I'll read a scripture
[29:02] in Ephesians uh first chapter 9, 10, and
[29:06] 11. And then I'll let you sit down. But
[29:08] keep your Bibles handy, please. You'll
[29:11] need your Bibles.
[29:19] And then right after this scripture,
[29:20] we'll have those first slides. I'll be
[29:23] ready with that, please.
[29:38] Verse 9, Ephesians 1.
[29:42] having made known unto us the mystery of
[29:44] his will, according to his good
[29:48] pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[29:51] himself.
[29:52] And I would I'm going to stress some
[29:55] phrases as we go along,
[29:58] having made known unto us the mystery of
[30:01] his will,
[30:03] but it's according to his good pleasure,
[30:06] which he hath purposed in himself. Amen.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; As God has purposed these things and I
[30:12] want to speak to you on the purpose of
[30:14] God will stand
[30:17] &gt;&gt; not because of anything we do but it
[30:19] will stand. God the creator of heavens
[30:23] and earth and all things that are
[30:25] therein. The creator of the universes,
[30:28] the galaxies, the God that fills all
[30:31] time and space. And we've gone way
[30:33] beyond anything we can grasp by now. But
[30:38] that God is who we're dealing with. And
[30:42] that's the God I want to speak about.
[30:45] Next verse. That in the dispensation of
[30:48] the fullness of times he might gather
[30:51] together in one all things in Christ.
[30:54] Notice he'll gather all things in
[30:58] Christ, both which are in heaven and
[31:02] which are in earth, even in him.
[31:05] In whom also we have obtained an
[31:08] inheritance,
[31:09] being predestinated according to the
[31:12] purpose of him who workketh all things
[31:15] after the counsel of his own will.
[31:19] You may be seated.
[31:29] Now I I feel that uh in in in some of
[31:32] the quote and some of the things that
[31:35] we're going to read, I personally would
[31:38] like to convey to you this that I feel
[31:41] that there are certain keys. You know,
[31:44] you can't get into a room if if it's
[31:47] locked and you don't have the right key.
[31:50] I believe that the prophet has given us
[31:53] some keys and in in the message Christ
[31:56] is the mystery of God revealed. There's
[31:58] much in there that
[32:01] it's not a book. It's not just some
[32:03] words. It's not just some phrases, but
[32:06] it is something that God is seeking to
[32:08] convey to us. And I I trust that I will
[32:12] be able to convey at least some things.
[32:15] And you as individuals will pick up
[32:18] whatever God will make real to you.
[32:21] Uh,
[32:27] and now I I'm reading some of the things
[32:30] which brother Brandham said prior to
[32:33] actually speaking this message. And now
[32:35] be as patient as you can for I feel that
[32:40] in this here if God will help me will
[32:44] reveal and bring into your mind all
[32:48] these other things that I have talked on
[32:51] all through the days of the tabernacle.
[32:54] All through the days of the tabernacle.
[32:58] why I have said what I have said and why
[33:02] I have done what I have done. This is
[33:06] why
[33:08] that kind of sets the stage, doesn't it?
[33:11] &gt;&gt; And he goes immediately to the scripture
[33:13] and I'll just read two of them. He goes
[33:15] to the scripture and you can read it
[33:17] when you return home if you would.
[33:21] It is Colossians 1:15
[33:25] I think to 29
[33:27] to the end of the chapter. And I'm just
[33:30] going to read the first two verses
[33:32] because this is why.
[33:35] Who is the image
[33:37] of the invisible God,
[33:40] the firstborn of every creature? So now
[33:44] we have already introduced an invisible
[33:46] God.
[33:48] That's difficult perhaps for us humans.
[33:51] We depend upon our v visible world. But
[33:55] he is the image of the invisible god,
[33:59] the firstborn
[34:02] of every creature.
[34:04] We are some creatures. So he's the
[34:06] firstborn of every creature. Not born
[34:11] just as we were born, but for eternal
[34:14] life. For by him were all things
[34:17] created.
[34:20] I'm sorry.
[34:27] For by him were all things created that
[34:29] are in heaven and that are in earth,
[34:34] visible and invisible,
[34:36] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[34:40] principalities
[34:42] or powers. All things were created by
[34:45] him and for him.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; The key, one of the keys that we will be
[35:00] covering in the in the service, the key
[35:02] to better understand God and the scope
[35:07] of his plan and purpose.
[35:10] We all have an individual life to live
[35:12] and we all have questions about you know
[35:15] what am I doing where am I going what is
[35:18] this all about
[35:20] and uh so this will help us I trust
[35:26] a better understanding
[35:30] of God a better understanding of God by
[35:34] acknowledging
[35:36] that he is and I quote too great to ever
[35:41] be revealed to people because it would
[35:44] be too mysterious.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; So now here's a we talk about a prophet
[35:50] he and and people trying to maybe I
[35:54] identify what he said and place it and
[35:57] all the rest of it. This is a God that
[36:00] can't be understood.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; The human mind cannot grasp him. And
[36:06] it's and the and the sooner we
[36:07] acknowledge that God is too great for
[36:10] this little teaspoon of ashes,
[36:13] the better off we'll be. And yet that
[36:16] God has certain desires and we'll be
[36:20] coming to that. So this service I feel
[36:22] is very very important.
[36:25] Very important.
[36:31] God as the creator
[36:34] possesses innumerable
[36:38] attributes
[36:41] attributes to be God for there was a
[36:44] time he wasn't God because God is an
[36:46] object to be worshiped I'll be coming
[36:48] over the repeating some of these things
[36:51] as we go he had these attributes in him
[36:55] to be God
[36:57] he had attributes to be God and to to be
[37:01] worshiped.
[37:03] He had attributes to be a father.
[37:07] Nothing had he hadn't given he hadn't
[37:11] been a father but he had attribute to be
[37:13] a father
[37:16] and to be a son
[37:19] to be a savior but there was nothing
[37:21] lost to be a healer but there was no one
[37:24] sick. He had all those attributes in
[37:28] him. Here's this great being that fills
[37:30] all time and space.
[37:33] Never had a beginning, never had an end.
[37:36] So, we're not trying to pinpoint at c
[37:38] certain junction in time. He he he's
[37:41] timeless.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; So, this great uh being that can't be
[37:47] grasped, can't be understood, but can be
[37:50] believed.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; He can be believed.
[37:55] And so uh he and he is a creator and he
[37:59] possesses he he just possesses a
[38:02] majestic magnitude of of attributes
[38:07] that's in him.
[38:17] But he made himself of no reputation
[38:22] and took upon him the form of a servant.
[38:25] This is speaking of Jesus Christ.
[38:28] And was made in the likeness of men.
[38:32] Philippians 2:7.
[38:34] The first thing was, and this is now I'm
[38:36] going to much of this is out of Christ,
[38:39] the mystery of God revealed. The first
[38:42] thing was that God wanted to reveal
[38:44] himself
[38:46] to the people before there was any
[38:50] people.
[38:51] There was no people. I added that there
[38:55] was no people before the foundation of
[38:57] the world. Before there was, brother
[38:59] Bram says before there was a molecule,
[39:01] before there was an atom, before there
[39:03] was anything, there was God.
[39:06] And uh he but he wanted the first thing
[39:09] he wanted to re that's one of his
[39:12] attributes. He wanted to reveal himself
[39:15] &gt;&gt; to people but there was no people.
[39:20] He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah.
[39:25] He couldn't do it as the as a great
[39:28] Jehovah God who covered all space,
[39:32] time, and eternity. These are prophet's
[39:36] words. He could not.
[39:42] But what he wanted to do
[39:46] But what he wanted to do, and here's the
[39:49] phrase that I have never been able to
[39:52] fully absorb, and this is the first time
[39:54] I really am trying to bring it to you.
[39:58] What he wanted to do, he loved
[40:02] fatherhood.
[40:06] And these two phrases I think to me are
[40:09] a key to the message, the entire
[40:12] message. Are you listening?
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And the only way
[40:21] I've underlined only and the only way
[40:25] he could express it was to become a son
[40:29] of man.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Now that will open up the whole message.
[40:33] That's the only way he here's this great
[40:37] being. Uh just try to turn your
[40:41] imagination loose.
[40:44] God,
[40:45] no beginning, no end.
[40:49] That's why I understand I understand
[40:51] when people call it a force, but he's
[40:53] more than a force. He's a being.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; He's a person.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Prophet says he lives in a house, not a
[41:00] house like we have. He lives in the and
[41:03] he covers all time and space. The space
[41:05] between you and I are vibrating with the
[41:08] attributes of God.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; He's ready to forgive the sinner. He's
[41:13] ready to heal the sick. He's ready to do
[41:16] anything. His attributes are available
[41:19] and they can never diminish. He has
[41:21] mercy for the worst sinner.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; He's got deliverance for the worst the
[41:27] worst person, the person that's most
[41:29] bound.
[41:31] The person that's mentally imbalanced,
[41:33] he can balance that.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to put him a 100
[41:42] million light years away. He's present.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; That's another one of his his
[41:48] characteristics. God, he's present.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; But he loved
[41:56] I want you to go back to this and I'll
[41:58] be repeating it. He loved
[42:01] fatherhood.
[42:03] Oh, he just loved fatherhood
[42:07] to be a father
[42:09] in the great mind of God
[42:12] because he said his thoughts were
[42:14] attributes.
[42:17] So obviously God thought
[42:20] oh to be a father
[42:24] and then the prophet says the only way
[42:27] he could be a father is to become a son
[42:32] of man.
[42:39] That's the reason Jesus kept saying
[42:43] the son of man. See, there didn't they
[42:46] didn't know what he was talking about.
[42:49] Many of them.
[42:51] He says, "But now you get it.
[42:55] The people of this message are
[42:56] different. Different. We're not people
[42:58] of 2,000 years ago. Now you get it."
[43:06] So, I'll leave you with those and then
[43:09] we want to continue on.
[43:13] according to the eternal purpose which
[43:16] he purposed in Christ.
[43:19] Notice now every time we say Christ,
[43:23] we're speaking of Christ.
[43:26] God loved fatherhood and the only way he
[43:29] could be a father was to become a son of
[43:31] man. That the son, a son of man had to
[43:35] be birthed, be born.
[43:39] And the the scripture says that he
[43:41] purposed it. He hath purposed it. And
[43:43] purpose
[43:45] purpose in the scripture is to set
[43:47] something forth. Setting it forth.
[43:51] Placing it in view.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just to become a son of
[43:55] man, but had to be in view. Had to
[43:57] expose it
[43:58] &gt;&gt; to the people.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; I trust that today you will get a better
[44:04] picture of things.
[44:06] And uh
[44:08] in the Old Testament they even used the
[44:11] they had the showbread in the Old
[44:13] Testament and it was set in in in rows
[44:16] the loaves of bread but it was it was
[44:20] represented the tribes of Israel and
[44:23] they and but it was set forth and to to
[44:27] view it. So they use that they call that
[44:29] the purpose but the scripture referring
[44:32] to us is the we are set forth.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; God set his messenger forth. God set
[44:42] Jesus forth. It was not it was nothing
[44:46] done in a corner. He said this is not
[44:48] done in a corner. This is done on the
[44:50] plain view. That's the way God has
[44:52] always done things.
[44:55] So the children of Israel
[44:58] uh were those that God had chosen for
[45:00] his purpose in the earth and uh purposes
[45:05] as I said a moment ago to set forth or
[45:08] to place before to be looked at or to
[45:11] expose to view. So the purpose of God,
[45:15] the setting forth of what God hath held
[45:18] in his mind before there were creatures
[45:22] on the earth, God had purposed not only
[45:25] did he have this to be a father, but he
[45:28] wanted it to be in view.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; He wanted to express it.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; And that incidentally, that happens to
[45:34] be the struggle between evil and good,
[45:37] &gt;&gt; between Satan and God is Satan wants to
[45:40] express himself. And if you go out on
[45:43] the streets, you'll see plenty of
[45:44] expression of it.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Now, if you like to take your Bibles, I
[45:50] want to read from Romans the 8th chapter
[46:00] and we start at the 16th verse, please.
[46:16] You can take that slide off now if you
[46:18] don't mind.
[46:21] Starting with verse 16. The spirit
[46:23] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[46:26] that we are the children of God. Now
[46:30] we've gone further and I will come back
[46:32] to this. We are we are the children of
[46:35] God. Well, how did that happen? We we
[46:38] we've come from a great span back where
[46:41] God loved fatherhood
[46:43] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to be a father. And the
[46:46] only way he could be a father is to
[46:49] through a son of man. That that was the
[46:51] only way there had to be a son of man.
[46:54] The son of man. And that Jesus referred
[46:58] to him. Now we've got children. And so
[47:01] we're going to fill up some of these
[47:02] spaces. I please don't don't let me lose
[47:05] you.
[47:07] Uh and if children if we're children if
[47:10] children then hes of God and joint hes
[47:14] with Christ.
[47:16] If so be that we suffer with him then we
[47:19] may also be glorified together. For I
[47:22] reckon that the sufferings of this
[47:24] present time are not worthy to be
[47:27] compared with the glory that should be
[47:30] revealed in us. And incidentally, you
[47:32] might say, well, why are we reading
[47:34] that? Well, you know, perhaps some of
[47:37] the people that are here are suffering.
[47:40] We suffer different things. We have
[47:43] pressures. We have decisions. We have
[47:47] difficulties. We have poverty. We have
[47:51] all kinds of we have sorrow. Uh I just
[47:54] walked into the office today to find out
[47:57] one of the sisters very very close to us
[48:00] in the eastern United States that has
[48:02] given to the missions for perhaps 30 or
[48:05] 35 years that I you know brother Michael
[48:09] just walked in. Did you know that sister
[48:11] passed away? I said, "No, I haven't
[48:15] heard. I know her niece real real well
[48:17] and I've known her and her sisters all
[48:20] these years and she's she's suddenly
[48:22] gone and uh she gave an offering last
[48:26] month and she's gone. We haven't even
[48:29] had a chance to send a letter to her.
[48:32] Life is somebody's sorrowing.
[48:35] Good believers are sorrowing but not as
[48:38] others without hope. But that's why
[48:40] we're speaking this scripture.
[48:43] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[48:45] present time are not worthy to be
[48:48] compared with the glory which shall be
[48:50] revealed in us. For the earnest
[48:53] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[48:55] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[48:58] For the creature was made subject to
[49:00] vanity, not willingly.
[49:03] We weren't made to v subject to vanity
[49:06] willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[49:10] subjected the same in hope because the
[49:13] creature itself also shall be delivered
[49:16] from the bondage of corruption into the
[49:19] glorious liberty of the children of God.
[49:23] Children of God weren't made to die.
[49:26] Children of God were made to live.
[49:29] For we know that the whole creation
[49:32] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[49:34] until now. And not only they, but
[49:38] ourselves also, which have the first
[49:40] fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves
[49:43] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[49:46] adoption to the redemption of our body.
[49:50] So God has not intended that these
[49:52] bodies will will uh uh you know just
[49:56] vanish into nothing.
[49:59] And we know that all things work
[50:01] together for good, for good to them that
[50:04] love God, to them who are the called
[50:07] according to his purpose. For whom he
[50:10] did forno, he also did predestinate to
[50:14] be conformed to the image of his son,
[50:17] that he might be the firstborn among
[50:19] many brethren.
[50:22] you know, brother Brandham, uh, just to
[50:24] have your attention for a few moments,
[50:27] brother Brandham several times, and this
[50:29] is the first time I've ever looked at
[50:30] it, he just asked the question, who is
[50:33] God?
[50:37] And he preaches a message on who is God?
[50:41] And I think that you know uh let me say
[50:45] that people all over the earth all over
[50:48] the earth doesn't makes no difference of
[50:51] what part of the world they're in. They
[50:53] will worship something and they have
[50:56] some concept of God. The Jews have it,
[51:00] the Muslims have it. Uh the Asians have
[51:03] it. Uh the Sikhs have it. The Hindus
[51:07] have it. The Buddhists have it. They all
[51:09] have a concept and everybody's got their
[51:12] idea of what God and what they should be
[51:14] doing and some sing and some pray and
[51:18] some pray this way and some do it
[51:20] another way and and it's a must with it
[51:22] would be absolutely anathema to change
[51:25] that
[51:28] &gt;&gt; and we hear it but we become almost numb
[51:30] to it
[51:32] &gt;&gt; and those hundreds and hundreds of
[51:34] people got trampled a few days ago in in
[51:36] in at in Mecca uh uh you know going uh
[51:41] going in a in a great formation of
[51:44] worship and and and uh and we will pray
[51:47] and cast out devils. And these people
[51:49] are sincere by the millions and they're
[51:52] throwing stones at a wall to cast out
[51:55] devils.
[51:57] That is their idea. And it be absolutely
[52:00] I mean you'd be worthy of death to to
[52:04] counter that.
[52:06] They live by that. They die by that.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; That's their And I think of now this God
[52:13] &gt;&gt; who fills all time and space. He must
[52:15] look upon us humans and think
[52:19] &gt;&gt; if he has a head to shake,
[52:23] what are they doing?
[52:25] You know, they're all troubled about
[52:27] this little thing and that little thing.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Blessed are Blessed are ye when you can
[52:32] believe. Yes.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you when you can identify
[52:37] &gt;&gt; and and and God sends a prophet in the
[52:40] land and he and hears all these people
[52:42] and they sing certain choruses and
[52:44] worship and wave their hand and clap
[52:46] their hands and do all kinds of things
[52:48] and motions and so on and so forth and
[52:50] and people are sitting there and said,
[52:52] "Well, I don't really care for that and
[52:54] I I'm not that way." And so this is God.
[52:59] He looks on the all these little
[53:01] trinkets that people do the religiosity
[53:04] and so on. Listen friends, we're not in
[53:06] a religion.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; It either has to be pure religion or
[53:11] this either has to be truth or and the
[53:13] prophet said if it's God then let him
[53:16] come and declare himself. And that's the
[53:19] kind of God.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And who is this Melzdc? He says, "If
[53:23] this is God, let God if if if this is
[53:27] God, let that God come forth.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Let him come forth now." That's why I'm
[53:33] standing here. If he didn't come forth,
[53:35] I I would have very little confidence in
[53:38] this message. But he come forth.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And one place the prophet said, and I'll
[53:45] be reading some of these, but I don't
[53:47] want to bewilder you. And yet on the
[53:50] other hand it can be overwhelming.
[53:53] But sometimes we need to have our
[53:55] conscience
[53:56] &gt;&gt; pricricked
[53:59] &gt;&gt; and we need to really take take stock of
[54:03] what it is that we believe and why do we
[54:05] do it? Why do we come to church?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Is well this is where we come to church.
[54:11] I said to my wife driving here I said
[54:13] how many times have we driven this road
[54:15] to come to church?
[54:17] say, "What do we come here for?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Is this is this, you know, to meet one
[54:22] another?" Surely not.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Is it just to sing certain kind of songs
[54:27] or we're going to come here this evening
[54:29] and have the Lord's table? Not because
[54:31] we did it before. We're not going to
[54:34] wash feet because well, this is what the
[54:36] prophet said and is what we do. That's
[54:38] part of it. But that's not all of it.
[54:40] Has to be something that is within an
[54:42] individual and s conviction and a
[54:46] reality.
[54:51] So he said
[54:53] he said who is God
[54:56] and I say most humans have some concept
[54:59] of God
[55:01] in the palmer locust cankerorm
[55:03] caterpillar message he said
[55:06] the fatherhood
[55:09] when God dwelt alone he's describing God
[55:13] the fatherhood when God dwelt alone
[55:18] He said, "And who do you say this is?"
[55:21] He was in the beginning by himself, God
[55:24] dwelt alone with his thoughts.
[55:29] In who is this Melzdc? He said, "In the
[55:31] beginning, God dwelt alone with his
[55:34] attributes."
[55:37] This is your God.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; This is who a prophet said he was.
[55:42] He dwelt alone with his attributes. I
[55:44] need to start there.
[55:48] In the spoken words, the original seed,
[55:49] he said, "And and if it is the word of
[55:53] God, God is absolutely honorbound,
[55:58] the God of who is the fountain of all
[56:01] honor, who is the beginning of all
[56:04] honor, who is the source of all honor,
[56:08] who is the source of all truth, has got
[56:11] to stand by what he said."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; If he's the fountain of all of these
[56:16] things
[56:18] and is if this isn't God's word,
[56:22] then who is God?
[56:25] Where is God?
[56:27] Or is there a God?
[56:30] A prophet said that. I'm not just saying
[56:32] that. He he he he bewildered the people
[56:37] &gt;&gt; by asking those kind of questions. Then
[56:39] who is God and where is God? And is
[56:41] there a God?
[56:48] Then in this is who is this mech or this
[56:50] day the scriptures fulfilled if you
[56:53] preach anything and this is where he
[56:54] spoke to brother Mitchell who you've
[56:59] seen the interview I trust I interviewed
[57:01] him at a television station in Rowan Oak
[57:05] West Virginia if you preach anything and
[57:09] it's the gospel truth this is just
[57:10] before he called brother Mitchell out of
[57:12] the audience who had never seen him and
[57:15] he had never been in a meeting. And he
[57:18] had a tumor the size of a man's fist in
[57:21] his lung. And the mining companies had
[57:25] sent him to three hospitals because they
[57:28] didn't know what his what uh what
[57:31] responsibility they would have if he
[57:35] should perish and die. He worked in a
[57:38] coal mine.
[57:40] And he says, and this is what brother
[57:42] Brandham says just prior to it, and if
[57:44] you preach anything and it's the gospel
[57:47] truth, then God is obligated to
[57:49] vindicate that. Is that true? He said,
[57:53] so we want to say yes.
[57:56] Now, if that be so, let the God that
[58:00] wrote the word,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; let the God that made the prophecy, let
[58:07] God, who is God of the word, come forth
[58:11] and prove that he is still God.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; I can assure you the Pope has never said
[58:15] that.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; I can assure you that the prespitators
[58:20] and bishops and so on have never said
[58:22] that. But here's someone with a seventh
[58:25] grade education because it has nothing
[58:27] to do with his education. Let the God
[58:29] who is God, let God, if he be God, let
[58:33] him come and prove that he is God. And
[58:36] he did exactly that. And I'm here to
[58:38] testify
[58:39] he did exactly that.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And when he, you can listen to it on
[58:43] tape yourself. And he says what he calls
[58:46] out brother Mitchell, he says, and he he
[58:49] actually stresses it. He said, "You have
[58:51] been a mine worker." Do you know why he
[58:54] said that? He never went back to being a
[58:56] mind worker.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; I challenge you. You need to listen to
[59:00] it. You need to hear it on tape.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; You have been a mind worker. Do you know
[59:05] what he became? A pastor of a church.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Three things.
[59:18] Since there has been man, there has been
[59:20] a hunger in man's heart to find out
[59:25] all of you where you came from
[59:30] and what's his reason of being here.
[59:34] Why are you here? So, I'm here because I
[59:36] have a family. I'm here because I'm
[59:38] married. I'm here because I'm a young
[59:39] person. Why are you here?
[59:43] What is this all about?
[59:46] They said, 'Well, I I'm here. I'm living
[59:48] my billions are living their time out
[59:53] and they're dropped like flies.
[59:57] Just go to the earth.
[1:00:00] Graveyards are full. You say, "Oh,
[1:00:02] Brother Bisc, we didn't come to hear
[1:00:04] that." Well, you better. That's what
[1:00:05] you're going to hear.
[1:00:08] If we don't have hope beyond six feet in
[1:00:10] the ground, we're very, very destitute
[1:00:12] people.
[1:00:14] We don't want to be povertystricken of
[1:00:16] faith.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; We want to be rich in faith.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; But we want to have something to
[1:00:22] believe.
[1:00:25] He says, "So these three things, where
[1:00:27] he came from and what's his reason of
[1:00:30] being here and where he's going, these
[1:00:33] are the things that man
[1:00:41] I have quite a number of people of the
[1:00:44] seek religion not far from me and I've
[1:00:47] read some of their material, not their
[1:00:49] official material, but their they go to
[1:00:52] worship in the seek temples.
[1:00:54] and they have the final revelation.
[1:00:57] I thought, isn't that amazing? I'm
[1:00:59] sitting up here on the hill and I think
[1:01:01] I have it and they're down there in the
[1:01:04] blueberry fields and they have it
[1:01:07] and I'm quite convinced and they're
[1:01:09] quite convinced. Is there anything wrong
[1:01:11] with that?
[1:01:14] You know, and you're quite convinced.
[1:01:16] We want to be certain, don't we?
[1:01:23] And there's only one who can answer
[1:01:25] that, and that's the one who brought him
[1:01:28] here.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; The only one who can answer that. You
[1:01:32] say, "Well, my mother and father brought
[1:01:34] me here." I'm sorry. That's not the
[1:01:36] coming I'm talking about.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; What brought you here?
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; What brought you to have the hunger to
[1:01:45] sit here?
[1:01:53] Who do you say this is?
[1:01:56] That's the way he was. He was in the
[1:01:58] beginning by himself and God dwelt alone
[1:02:00] with his thoughts. He'll never do that
[1:02:03] again.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Because his thoughts are being made
[1:02:08] manifest.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, manifest. They're being
[1:02:12] made uh they're coming into view. And
[1:02:16] that's why we are right here this day.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; I don't think it's good enough to say,
[1:02:24] "Well, Brother Brandham said that."
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I say he's speaking about a group of
[1:02:29] people and that's why we're here
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; because God had thoughts and they were
[1:02:34] going to be manifest and that's why
[1:02:36] we're here. He's making a declaration.
[1:02:39] That's why I I want to say that friends,
[1:02:42] if if we're if I'm just here to preach,
[1:02:44] that's a huge mistake. But that's why
[1:02:46] I'm here because God had a thought one
[1:02:49] day.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And in that thought, he thought of a
[1:02:54] certain person, a certain individual,
[1:02:57] and I include myself in that group of
[1:02:59] people. I must do so because he is the
[1:03:02] one who who allowed me to hear his voice
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; and to make this book. we call the Bible
[1:03:10] a living a living thing.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; It's a living book.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And I even asked myself while I was
[1:03:17] studying this message, it's hard for me
[1:03:19] to get it out in a hour or two. I've
[1:03:22] been at least two weeks in this message,
[1:03:26] agonizing how how to bring it to you
[1:03:30] because I even asked myself uh all these
[1:03:33] questions first. Ask myself all of these
[1:03:36] questions.
[1:03:38] You know what am I here for? What are we
[1:03:41] what are we doing? What's our purpose?
[1:03:43] And the prophet says
[1:03:46] one can answer that. And that's the one
[1:03:48] who brought him here. I made that very
[1:03:50] personal. That's the one the one who
[1:03:52] brought me here. He's the only one who
[1:03:54] can answer that. And man has always
[1:03:57] wanted to see God. And that's the way he
[1:03:59] was. He was in the beginning by himself.
[1:04:01] And he dwelt alone with his thoughts.
[1:04:04] And he'll never do that again because
[1:04:07] his thoughts are being made manifest.
[1:04:09] And that's why we are here this day is
[1:04:13] God fellowshipping with his thoughts
[1:04:16] being made manifest.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; The prophet said uh God had a purpose
[1:04:26] and a hidden Now I'm going to start if
[1:04:28] you don't mind I'm going to start
[1:04:29] preaching.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] God had a purpose and a hidden mystery.
[1:04:37] Many attributes. For those of you the
[1:04:40] lovers of the message,
[1:04:43] I want you to be alert now.
[1:04:46] Many attributes of God
[1:04:49] were sealed up
[1:04:52] in this great eternal mysterious God.
[1:04:56] They were sealed.
[1:05:01] One that fills all time and space is so
[1:05:05] far beyond human understanding.
[1:05:08] In the message identified Christ of all
[1:05:11] ages, but in this great God Elohim, his
[1:05:14] attributes
[1:05:16] there were there was attributes in there
[1:05:19] to be God.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's what I said earlier. There was
[1:05:23] attributes to be God.
[1:05:25] I I want you to envision this
[1:05:29] great being and I must stress it because
[1:05:32] I want you to go and ponder this. I want
[1:05:35] you to pray and ask God to make it
[1:05:39] known. Who can understand God? How can I
[1:05:41] understand you God unless you come and
[1:05:44] visit me in a personal way and make me
[1:05:46] to understand is I even ask God to uh
[1:05:50] expand my thoughts,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; expand my mind. Let me grasp things. I
[1:05:56] don't want to be so earthly bound that I
[1:05:59] can't grasp eternal things.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; There was attributes to be father
[1:06:15] that was in him.
[1:06:17] Attributes to be son.
[1:06:22] attributes to be savior, attributes to
[1:06:25] be healer. All of these attributes was
[1:06:28] in God. And if you've ever got eternal
[1:06:31] life, you were in God's attributes
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; because you got eternal life. If you've
[1:06:39] ever had eternal life, you were in God's
[1:06:42] attributes then.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why a prophet
[1:06:47] could say, "That's why we're here."
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] That's why we're having fellowship not
[1:06:52] just with one another. We're having
[1:06:54] fellowship with this eternal God, this
[1:06:57] mysterious God that no one perhaps can
[1:07:01] understand. I'm having fellowship with
[1:07:03] him. How do I know it? It's a reality to
[1:07:06] me. Well, say, "Well, all kinds of
[1:07:08] people have realities, but I can tell
[1:07:11] you one thing.
[1:07:13] Let me just
[1:07:16] nail this down. And I want you to hear
[1:07:19] it real good.
[1:07:21] There are very few people on the earth,
[1:07:24] very, very few that have a prophet that
[1:07:29] have been vindicated
[1:07:31] that could say, "Let the God who is God
[1:07:34] come forth." Now,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; unless you find someone else saying
[1:07:38] that, you better hang on to this till
[1:07:40] that comes
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; because I can I can declare to you,
[1:07:46] you're not going to hear it
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; You're not going to hear it from a whole
[1:07:51] bunch of quarters. You're not going to
[1:07:53] hear it from a whole bunch of churches.
[1:07:56] You won't hear it. I can't say it, but I
[1:07:58] can say I believe what God has sent.
[1:08:02] Like the disciples said, I believe what
[1:08:04] Jesus was and Jesus is.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And now he says, all we are today, all
[1:08:15] we are today is the display of his
[1:08:19] attributes.
[1:08:21] That's all we are, brethren.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; That's all you are.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You might say, I'm this is my father.
[1:08:30] this is my heritage and this is my roots
[1:08:32] and all just I just forget it. It's just
[1:08:35] trinkets.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; It's just something that happened down
[1:08:37] here.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; You were birthed into a family and you
[1:08:41] spoke a certain language and you had
[1:08:44] certain characteristics and and those
[1:08:46] things those things are important for
[1:08:50] time but not as far as eternity is
[1:08:52] concerned. We don't care where you come
[1:08:55] from. We don't care what color your skin
[1:08:58] is. We don't care anything about your
[1:09:01] character or traditions. What we care is
[1:09:03] that God called you.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; And God declared, "I had you in my
[1:09:08] thinking.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; I thought of you."
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have all kinds of frailty
[1:09:14] and weaknesses, but God is saying, I
[1:09:17] thought of you, and I know everything
[1:09:19] about you, and I know your suffering,
[1:09:22] and I know all the pain, and I know all
[1:09:24] the pressures you go through. I
[1:09:26] understand everything. I'm God.
[1:09:29] Remember, I'm God.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And today we're the display of his
[1:09:38] attributes.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be repetitious,
[1:09:48] but he goes on to say how
[1:09:52] because of the English word that means
[1:09:54] an object of worship and so on. It says,
[1:09:56] "And in him was attributes. It was
[1:09:59] attributes to be God.
[1:10:02] Then his attributes to be a father,
[1:10:04] attributes to be a son, attributes to be
[1:10:08] a savior." You may think I'm repeating
[1:10:10] myself. I'm not. These are different
[1:10:12] different quotes. And often the prophet
[1:10:14] of God says something slightly
[1:10:17] different. Attributes to be a healer.
[1:10:20] All these attributes was in him. These
[1:10:24] things that has unfolded
[1:10:26] since then are just his attributes being
[1:10:30] made manifest. So he says anything
[1:10:32] that's unfolded since then is just his
[1:10:34] attributes being made manifest.
[1:11:03] I want slide one now please.
[1:11:23] The first thing
[1:11:25] that he made, prophet God says that he
[1:11:28] made angels.
[1:11:31] Now this is uh
[1:11:35] please go down to slide six if you don't
[1:11:38] mind.
[1:11:41] It's this is my fault, not the brothers
[1:11:43] up there.
[1:11:49] First thing he made angels and then they
[1:11:51] worshiped him and
[1:11:54] that made him go
[1:11:57] and
[1:11:58] he started from there.
[1:12:06] They're looking for it and I'm looking
[1:12:08] for it.
[1:12:11] There we are.
[1:12:14] We're on the same track.
[1:12:16] He made angels and then they worshiped
[1:12:19] him and that made him go
[1:12:23] and he started from there. That's why I
[1:12:26] made it separate.
[1:12:28] Is what the messenger has said
[1:12:31] when angels began to worship him. That
[1:12:34] was before there was even a molecule in
[1:12:37] the earth.
[1:12:39] There was nothing. It was all darkness.
[1:12:42] There wasn't no sun. nor no moon, no
[1:12:46] stars, no nothing. Then he was God. As
[1:12:52] he asked Job, "Where was you when I laid
[1:12:56] the foundation of the world? See, when
[1:12:58] the morning stars sang together, the
[1:13:01] sons of God shouted for joy." Now, where
[1:13:04] were you? That was back before the
[1:13:06] earth.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, it's not enough for us
[1:13:10] to be here in a church in Cloverdale
[1:13:12] Bible way. I'm pointing you. You were
[1:13:14] back there.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life now, you were
[1:13:18] back there. Then
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; you were in God. You're in his
[1:13:22] attributes. And when he desired to be a
[1:13:24] father,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He had more in mind than just Jesus as
[1:13:31] the son of man. He had in mind, I want a
[1:13:34] family.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's why he said to Isaiah, where's my
[1:13:38] house?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Where's my household? Where's my people?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Where's my family?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; That's why we started out in our
[1:13:48] scripture reading. Now we're the
[1:13:50] children of God.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; If you just point to your father and
[1:13:59] mother on earth, how wonderful that is.
[1:14:01] How wonderful that we have godly parents
[1:14:03] or whatever more that brought us here.
[1:14:06] But friends, that is not even in the
[1:14:09] picture. It is those are instruments
[1:14:11] that God used to bring you here so that
[1:14:14] one day you will hear the voice of God
[1:14:17] in the inner being in the inner self.
[1:14:20] And you and and I'm here now to declare
[1:14:23] to you on the basis that God sent a
[1:14:26] prophet to say you were in his
[1:14:28] attribute. You were part of that back
[1:14:30] then. Before there was a sun, before
[1:14:33] there was a moon, before there was any
[1:14:35] molecule, any atom, before there was
[1:14:38] even structure on the earth to bring
[1:14:41] forth your body, you were in God. If you
[1:14:44] weren't, you'll never be there.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Now, God had a purpose.
[1:14:57] had a purpose. And if he had a purpose,
[1:14:59] that means he's going to bring something
[1:15:01] to view.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; You're not just here to be a housewife
[1:15:06] or a plumber or a carpenter
[1:15:09] or businessman or whatever it is you
[1:15:11] are. You're not here for that. You're
[1:15:14] you're here because God in his purpose
[1:15:17] wanted to bring you into view.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to see it.
[1:15:24] Somebody's going to see it. If you lived
[1:15:27] your entire life and someone saw God
[1:15:31] once in you,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; you've been successful.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You've been successful. You've been
[1:15:38] faithful.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And I saw once
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; the God,
[1:15:44] eternal God in you. And God laid a
[1:15:47] record down in someone's pathway. This
[1:15:51] is what I'm like. This is the kind of
[1:15:54] life I give. This is what it's all
[1:15:56] about.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Then you've had a purpose in life
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and you've been successful.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; And so now God had a purpose and a
[1:16:09] hidden a hidden sealed
[1:16:13] mystery.
[1:16:14] And that's what I want. He said, I
[1:16:16] that's what I want to speak to the
[1:16:18] church this morning. the hidden mystery
[1:16:20] of God that he had in his mind before
[1:16:23] the world ever began and how that it's
[1:16:26] unfolded itself right down to this
[1:16:30] present hour that we're living. Oh,
[1:16:34] isn't this marvelous? He didn't have to
[1:16:36] have a crowd of people to unfold it
[1:16:38] down. It has unfolded itself down.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; If you're a believer, the word of God is
[1:16:45] actually active in you. Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God that has
[1:16:50] transforming power. You're not
[1:16:52] transforming in it. You're not act
[1:16:55] you're not the active force of
[1:16:56] transforming. I I got to change myself.
[1:17:00] Give yourself over to God. Let him
[1:17:02] transform you.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; It has unfolded itself down.
[1:17:09] It's not dependent upon the efforts of
[1:17:12] man
[1:17:15] to the present hour that we're living
[1:17:17] in.
[1:17:18] Then you will understand clearly.
[1:17:22] You see on I believe what is going to be
[1:17:25] done.
[1:17:28] The first thing was that God wanted to
[1:17:31] reveal himself to the people.
[1:17:37] He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God
[1:17:40] who covered all space, time, and
[1:17:43] eternity. He could not. He's too great
[1:17:46] to ever be revealed to people because it
[1:17:48] would be too mysterious. How could that
[1:17:51] great being that never did begin? And
[1:17:54] then after you went beyond the cycle of
[1:17:57] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:18:00] trillions of years of light space and on
[1:18:03] out into the infinite into the eternity
[1:18:06] in a great preacher that was all that
[1:18:08] and still is. Does this sound like
[1:18:11] someone who had seven great education in
[1:18:14] Kentucky? I declare not. This is someone
[1:18:17] who's connected with all wisdom and the
[1:18:20] fairy fountain.
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:23] This is someone speaking on behalf of
[1:18:25] the creator
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; so that we humans could have some kind
[1:18:28] of understanding
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; so that even if we lose our mind lose
[1:18:34] our thoughts so we can't grasp it all we
[1:18:38] can uh we can come to the conclusion it
[1:18:40] is so glorious
[1:18:43] I believe it
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; there's something within me that
[1:18:47] responds to that
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; then you're hearing his voice
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; and you have a capacity to grasp his
[1:18:55] voice.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And that even was in his mind. I'll
[1:18:59] speak, I'll declare things they don't
[1:19:02] understand. I'll speak it, but they'll
[1:19:04] believe it because it comes from the
[1:19:06] word of God. It comes from a vindicated
[1:19:09] messenger. And they've identified that
[1:19:11] that messenger does the same things that
[1:19:14] Jesus did.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; I think so marvelous. It was a woman at
[1:19:20] the well. How he he could do such a
[1:19:23] simple thing as tell her her life, tell
[1:19:26] her a few details of her life,
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; The one you're with is not your husband,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You've had five.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; He he didn't go into the details, but
[1:19:38] just think about having five
[1:19:41] partners in life, five husbands. Didn't
[1:19:44] work out.
[1:19:46] Think about the agony that that think
[1:19:48] about what she went through. He didn't
[1:19:51] detail all that and say, "My, you've
[1:19:53] gone through such a hard time and I I
[1:19:56] feel so sorry for you and I I I'm I'm
[1:20:00] got the truth and I got compassion. I
[1:20:02] can show you a better way." No, he just
[1:20:04] said, "You've had five and the one
[1:20:06] you're with is not your husband." She
[1:20:08] flashed. She had something that
[1:20:10] connected with that. She did. She
[1:20:13] couldn't understand how that was coming
[1:20:14] to her. How did he find that out? She
[1:20:17] didn't have that kind of uh
[1:20:19] understanding, but she said, "You're the
[1:20:21] Messiah. You're a prophet of God."
[1:20:26] She said, "I know when the Messiah
[1:20:28] comes, he'll tell us all things. I that
[1:20:31] speak to thee am he." A man standing
[1:20:34] there asking for a drink of water
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; and said that he would give her to drink
[1:20:42] and hasn't even got a bucket.
[1:20:45] I hasn't got a rope to lay it down to
[1:20:49] get some water. Are you greater than
[1:20:52] Jacob? No, she forgot all of that now.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; And the prophet makes such a statement.
[1:20:58] She didn't when she was heart was
[1:21:01] revealed and at this sign of Messiah,
[1:21:04] she did not say Belub.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; That's what the world said. That's what
[1:21:10] so many said. Theologians said bells
[1:21:12] above.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Religious people said bells above.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; But when this pro woman who is a failure
[1:21:23] in life, a failure in marriages, when
[1:21:26] she heard it, oh, there was something in
[1:21:30] her. And he was not prepared. The
[1:21:33] attribute of God wasn't saying you're a
[1:21:36] failure, you're a mess. the attribute of
[1:21:40] God. When she said, he said, "I that
[1:21:46] speak to thee am he." She dropped her
[1:21:49] water bucket, ran into the city, come
[1:21:52] see a man that told me all that ever I
[1:21:54] did. He never told her all that ever she
[1:21:57] did. He told her just what she needed to
[1:21:59] hear.
[1:22:03] That's right.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And then in this day, I I'm reading a
[1:22:08] message.
[1:22:10] I didn't know
[1:22:13] uh it had a message here. The mighty God
[1:22:16] unveiled before us.
[1:22:19] It was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
[1:22:22] 1964.
[1:22:24] I was supposed to be in that meeting.
[1:22:26] And the president of the full gospel
[1:22:28] businessman of Toronto
[1:22:31] asked me to go and be with him. And even
[1:22:35] he did invite me to be his vice
[1:22:38] president
[1:22:39] in Toronto, the Christian businessman. I
[1:22:42] knew him quite well. I knew him very
[1:22:44] well, in fact. So, I'm reading it I'm
[1:22:47] reading it different.
[1:22:50] I'm reading it as though,
[1:22:53] yeah, I I I could have been there. And
[1:22:57] when he came back, he was heartsick.
[1:23:00] He said they had their testimonies of
[1:23:02] all their successes and money making and
[1:23:06] they had all of these things and they
[1:23:08] squeeze it right on to the end and give
[1:23:10] brother about 10 minutes. And I went to
[1:23:12] the back of the book. He doesn't even
[1:23:14] call any.
[1:23:15] They don't even see the sign.
[1:23:19] 1964
[1:23:21] just using to gather a crowd of people
[1:23:24] using his name.
[1:23:26] But here you are. You're we're not here
[1:23:28] because of that.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And he gone beyond the cycle of
[1:23:36] trillions and trillions of light space.
[1:23:39] Scientific words actually scientific
[1:23:42] verbiage.
[1:23:44] These are the these are the words
[1:23:46] scientists use.
[1:23:52] But what he wanted to do now I'm back to
[1:23:55] where I was earlier
[1:23:57] and as I said I have Have we got a
[1:24:00] little time?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; He loved Don't ever forget this phrase.
[1:24:06] That's why you're here. He loved
[1:24:07] fatherhood
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; for he was a father.
[1:24:13] Says and a prophet saying he was a
[1:24:14] father but he hadn't been a father yet.
[1:24:18] And the only way that he could express
[1:24:21] it
[1:24:23] was to become a son of man.
[1:24:26] And in this day that you're living, he
[1:24:30] took a redeemed son
[1:24:33] of man to reveal the son of man
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; that God was speaking about.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's the reason Jesus kept saying the
[1:24:45] son of man. He wanted to express
[1:24:47] himself. That was his one of his great
[1:24:50] three-fold purposes was to express
[1:24:53] himself to identify himself with human
[1:24:56] beings to reveal himself in Christ
[1:24:59] because that was the son that was going
[1:25:01] to everything had to flow from him. And
[1:25:03] that's why it says by him were all
[1:25:05] things made that was made and without
[1:25:07] him was nothing made that was made.
[1:25:20] Are you all right
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; for another few moments?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:34] A father is one.
[1:25:36] There's nobody here. But what had a
[1:25:38] father?
[1:25:42] Maybe you didn't know who your father
[1:25:43] is, but everybody's had a father.
[1:25:51] Hello.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You actually came by someone's seed.
[1:25:58] But this messenger said this and he said
[1:26:01] it right at the end of his ministry and
[1:26:04] he begins to talk about the genes. And
[1:26:07] you hear so much about the genes today.
[1:26:10] Brother Brandham, I've said this before,
[1:26:12] I want to say it again in this
[1:26:13] atmosphere.
[1:26:15] Brother Brandham referred to the gene
[1:26:19] about 20 times that I can find
[1:26:23] in his entire ministry.
[1:26:27] once in 1964,
[1:26:31] 20 times in 1965,
[1:26:35] and 18 of those times
[1:26:38] in the last four services.
[1:26:41] And he's saying, and you want to go and
[1:26:43] read that
[1:26:45] 18 times because he's saying, "As
[1:26:50] you were in a genie, your father, as you
[1:26:53] were in a genie, your father, your
[1:26:54] grandfather, so were you in the loins of
[1:26:58] God."
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Is that poetic license or is that a
[1:27:02] reality?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, that eternal
[1:27:06] life was in the loins of God at that
[1:27:09] time.
[1:27:11] And God has brought you here. Your
[1:27:14] mother and father were they they were
[1:27:17] the instruments that give you human
[1:27:18] birth, human life. But God is the
[1:27:21] instrument. God is the one who has
[1:27:24] ordained eternal life.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; And that's why a messenger says if you
[1:27:28] ever had eternal life, you always had
[1:27:31] it.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't believe in pre-existence.
[1:27:34] You always had it.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou if thou canst believe.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:27:52] he was the only begotten son of almighty
[1:27:54] God. We are sons by adoption through
[1:27:58] him.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's why everything is through Christ
[1:28:01] in Christ. But he is the only begotten
[1:28:05] son of God. Adam was a son.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to listen very close.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Adam was a son.
[1:28:14] He was He was God's creative son.
[1:28:19] But this was his only begotten son.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; God's begotten son in power to
[1:28:27] transform. He says Adam was his first
[1:28:30] created son.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus was his only begotten son. See, he
[1:28:36] was begotten by a woman.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; But Adam was right straight from the
[1:28:42] hand of God in creation.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Now listen real close.
[1:28:49] This is a great blessing to me.
[1:28:52] Jesus was his begotten son, but it
[1:28:55] wasn't so from the beginning.
[1:28:58] His begotten son. And God was in Jesus
[1:29:01] reconciling the world to himself because
[1:29:04] he said, "It's not me that doeth the
[1:29:06] works.
[1:29:09] It's my father that dwelleth in me. He
[1:29:12] doeth the works."
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God quoted that very,
[1:29:16] very scripture
[1:29:18] because it had exactly the same
[1:29:19] reference. It's not me that doeth the
[1:29:21] works. It's my father that dwelleth in
[1:29:24] me that doeth the works.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to deal with that.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] That's how close God came to us.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And then that was to convey that God is
[1:29:39] in his people. Jesus was saying, "The
[1:29:42] Father will be in me and I will be in
[1:29:44] you."
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Listen friends,
[1:29:49] that's what we've got to get. We've got
[1:29:51] to we've got to understand that
[1:29:56] if I asked you, was that deity God? Was
[1:29:59] that deity in Jesus Christ?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; You'd readily say yes.
[1:30:05] And now what happens to that deity? Does
[1:30:07] it kind of get lost in the transition
[1:30:10] from Christ to you?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] If you're afraid to say hallelujah, I'll
[1:30:21] say hallelujah for you.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; When God's attribute of fatherhood, now
[1:30:31] I spent a long time.
[1:30:34] Stay with me real close now. When God's
[1:30:37] attribute,
[1:30:39] he loved fatherhood.
[1:30:42] When that finally
[1:30:45] came to fruition
[1:30:48] and Jesus was begotten,
[1:30:52] son of God, born of a woman because sin
[1:30:55] came that way. If you dispense with the
[1:30:59] serpent seed, you've dispenseed with the
[1:31:01] whole meaning of the gospel.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Sin came that way. And Jesus the remedy
[1:31:09] came that way. Hallelujah.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; And when he was issued into the world,
[1:31:14] the Bible says, "And suddenly,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; there was a multitude of heavenly host
[1:31:21] of heavenly hosts praising God and
[1:31:25] saying, "Glory to God in the highest.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; On earth, peace and good will to men."
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The world at large hasn't
[1:31:36] got it. But there's a group of people
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; that this was speaking for. Angels spoke
[1:31:42] on behalf of us that would believe.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, blessed art thou.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Try hard to believe it.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Don't just have a flash in the pan. Say,
[1:31:57] "Oh, that was a wonderful service." That
[1:31:59] isn't what I want. I want you to believe
[1:32:01] what he has spoken,
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; what God has said.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; When this son, when Adam was birthed,
[1:32:10] right directly from the hand of God,
[1:32:12] there was no host of angels,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; no one was praising God. Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; But when this babe
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; born in blood
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; from a mother's womb,
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; a little girl that believes that even be
[1:32:31] it unto me according to your word. Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And now a prophet comes in this times
[1:32:38] and says the the words of the prophets,
[1:32:41] the words of the prophets, the virgin
[1:32:43] shall conceived hooked and lodged into
[1:32:46] her womb when she believed it.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; If the words of the prophets would hook
[1:32:52] into her womb, wouldn't the words of
[1:32:55] this prophet hook into your heart?
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Don't be too dull now. be on the edge of
[1:33:05] your seat and say, "Oh, speak it,
[1:33:06] preacher. Speak it. Speak it. I want to
[1:33:10] believe it. I want to hear it. I need to
[1:33:13] hear it."
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; You've spent a long time. You've put a
[1:33:18] lot of You've put a lot of emphasis on
[1:33:20] this foundation. Now say it.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Let it hook into my heart.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Let it anchor in my soul.
[1:33:32] Let this transforming power, let this
[1:33:35] attribute of the Almighty
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; come down
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; manifest itself here.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Don't look at this little fella behind
[1:33:46] the pulpit. It has nothing to do with
[1:33:48] it. It's the one that's beside you. It's
[1:33:51] a God Almighty.
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, he either sent a prophet
[1:33:57] or he didn't send a prophet.
[1:33:59] This prophet's either vindicated or he's
[1:34:02] not vindicated. If he is vindicated,
[1:34:04] where is God? Who is God?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; What's saying
[1:34:16] when God had completed his creation of
[1:34:18] Adam, there was no angelic host
[1:34:24] singing glory to God in the highest.
[1:34:27] But now he had a begotten son
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; by which he would bring many sons to
[1:34:31] glory in Hebrews 2:10. For it became him
[1:34:36] became him for whom are all things and
[1:34:39] by whom are all things which is Jesus
[1:34:42] Christ in bringing many sons to glory.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; No wonder the angels cried out. No
[1:34:51] wonder heaven couldn't contain itself.
[1:34:55] No wonder all the angels that have
[1:34:57] worshiped him now burst forth.
[1:35:00] They perhaps they never saw it, but they
[1:35:03] realized they couldn't contain
[1:35:05] themselves. Glory to God in the highest
[1:35:08] on earth peace and good will towards
[1:35:11] men. Now a begotten son was born. Sin's
[1:35:15] question was answered. The devil was
[1:35:18] unveiled and uncovered. The devil, he
[1:35:21] was completely uh uh made powerless. And
[1:35:26] now sons of God and daughters of God
[1:35:29] would be gathered to the father.
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:35] the answer to the attribute
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; in bringing many sons under glory to
[1:35:47] make the captain of their faith, captain
[1:35:50] of their salvation perfect through
[1:35:52] sufferings.
[1:35:54] And then Jesus
[1:35:56] quoted the scripture
[1:35:58] and again in Hebrews 12:13 I mean 23 and
[1:36:03] 14. And again I will put my trust in
[1:36:05] him. And again behold I in the children
[1:36:10] which God hath given me.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; For as much then as the children are
[1:36:15] partakers of flesh and blood. Hello.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; As much as
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; exactly as the children are partakers of
[1:36:29] flesh and blood
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and you have it. That's the way you were
[1:36:33] born.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; You've got that circulatory system of
[1:36:38] blood in you. And it says, "For as much
[1:36:41] as the children are partakers in of
[1:36:43] flesh and blood, he also himself
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; took part of the same."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He had to become flesh and blood. And
[1:36:53] now he had now the father, the answer to
[1:36:56] the attribute of the eternal God. Now he
[1:36:59] had an answer to it. And the angels
[1:37:02] burst forth. And it says he had to
[1:37:05] partake of the same that through death
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; he might destroy him that had the power
[1:37:12] of death. That is the devil.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; No wonder the angel sang there was war
[1:37:21] in heaven one day.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And a third of the population of heaven
[1:37:26] uh was taken out down and cast to the
[1:37:30] earth. And here they are.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; You feel their presence every day.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Every day, this demon
[1:37:39] and all of his angels are hounding you
[1:37:42] and trying to get you to doubt and
[1:37:45] disbelieve. I say he came in the flesh,
[1:37:49] the begotten son of God, and destroyed
[1:37:52] the works of the devil.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And I believe that.
[1:38:02] You have a right to the mind of God.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; You have a right to the word of God.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You have a right to the attributes of
[1:38:10] God. They belong to you.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I am a son of God. I am a
[1:38:16] daughter of the living God. I came from
[1:38:19] eternity and I will go back to eternity.
[1:38:22] I possess eternal life."
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Will you say that? I possess eternal
[1:38:29] life.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. I possess eternal
[1:38:32] life.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; He took part of the same that he might
[1:38:50] destroy the works of the devil. who
[1:38:52] being the brightness of his glory and
[1:38:55] the express image I'm coming to that now
[1:38:59] the express image of his person and
[1:39:02] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:39:06] power
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; when he had himself purged our sins
[1:39:11] hello
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; purged your sins
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; sat down at the right hand of the
[1:39:21] Majesty on high
[1:39:24] and the express image
[1:39:27] I'm coming home
[1:39:29] the express image
[1:39:32] is used of Christ but it's used of this
[1:39:35] is this what it means
[1:39:37] the express image is the engraving tool
[1:39:42] sharp engraving or carving
[1:39:46] it's the mark
[1:39:48] stamped on
[1:39:51] or an impression
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; pressed
[1:39:56] the exact expression or image of a
[1:39:59] person or a thing. Precise reproduction
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; in every respect.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; The stamped image.
[1:40:14] Is that easy? No, it's not all. He
[1:40:17] through sufferings.
[1:40:19] He learned obedience by the things that
[1:40:21] he suffered. Not that he had to learn to
[1:40:24] be obedient, but by the things he
[1:40:27] suffered, he proved he was obedient.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing could deter him. In the church
[1:40:39] age book, the prophet said, "I wonder if
[1:40:42] we are sufficiently
[1:40:44] impressed
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; with the word
[1:40:48] in our midst.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; It's not that the word isn't here. It is
[1:40:52] not that the stamp isn't here. Are we
[1:40:55] allowing the pressure
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; of the press of the stamp? Say, "Oh,
[1:41:00] this is so hard." Say, "Pour it on,
[1:41:03] Lord.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Pour it on. Nothing can deter me.
[1:41:08] Nothing can take me down." The God of
[1:41:11] eternity, the God of the universe, the
[1:41:14] God that fills all time and space. You
[1:41:17] think that these little things that we
[1:41:18] have are going to deter him or change
[1:41:22] his mind about his will whom he has will
[1:41:26] and he has purposed already purposed it.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; The express image
[1:41:41] it comes from another word called graph.
[1:41:46] The first word is character.
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:55] This book here
[1:41:57] happens to be a big selection of
[1:42:01] characters.
[1:42:12] Is that English?
[1:42:15] That's English, isn't it? English
[1:42:17] characters. Some may have it in
[1:42:21] Arabic, some may have it in Hindu,
[1:42:25] some may have it in Chuba,
[1:42:29] some may have it in
[1:42:31] Chinese.
[1:42:34] That's why we're busy making it.
[1:42:37] And then a person, many person, and this
[1:42:40] is what it says.
[1:42:42] The letter
[1:42:44] killth.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; The letter can actually kill or destroy.
[1:42:51] But the spirit who wrote this, the
[1:42:53] author, if you have the author
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; and then you read a certain thing and it
[1:43:00] starts to
[1:43:02] a sharp tool
[1:43:04] starts to engrave. Oh.
[1:43:08] Oh.
[1:43:09] and through he became obedient to the
[1:43:11] things that he suffered.
[1:43:14] It's not easy always to be a Christian.
[1:43:17] It's not always easy to be a believer
[1:43:19] and people say
[1:43:22] and they turn aside and walk away from
[1:43:24] you but it's a sharp tool the very word
[1:43:28] it's a character and grapho it is it is
[1:43:31] what is written it is the graphics it's
[1:43:34] the characters in the graphics and and
[1:43:36] and this is the this is the Bible but I
[1:43:40] can tell you and I say without
[1:43:41] hesitation without apology the message
[1:43:45] which reveals this
[1:43:47] the message which makes this alive.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And when I when I read it, I'm so glad
[1:43:53] that someone put it into language that I
[1:43:55] understand.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; And I've looked into the faces of people
[1:43:59] in other countries, particularly when I
[1:44:02] was in Africa, Brother Daniel, and years
[1:44:05] ago, and and they looked at my face and
[1:44:09] they said, "Oh, you have it on tapes and
[1:44:12] you have it on books."
[1:44:14] Oh, I I wish we had it.
[1:44:18] That's why I have such a passion.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; It has never left me. Amen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Whether a man wants to cast it down,
[1:44:27] whether he wants to put it in a waste
[1:44:29] basket, or we drive into a gas station
[1:44:32] in Cape Town, South Africa, and and and
[1:44:35] a a a man who's serving uh a black man
[1:44:39] is serving fuel. He's sitting on a
[1:44:42] little stool reading a message book. I
[1:44:44] said, "Good. That's good book." He said,
[1:44:47] "Yes." I said, "Where'd you get it?" He
[1:44:49] said, "In the Someone threw it out of
[1:44:51] their car into a waste bucket." And so I
[1:44:53] picked it out of the waste bucket and
[1:44:55] I'm reading it. I say hallelujah.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; However God wants to get it,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; but there's characters,
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; sharp characters. Sometime we read it
[1:45:06] and say, "Oh, I'm a woman." That's just
[1:45:09] s that's so hard to take. And next man
[1:45:11] says, "I'm a man and I'm a I'm a young
[1:45:13] person." And oh, that is so hard to
[1:45:16] take.
[1:45:17] Let that sharp instrument
[1:45:20] character.
[1:45:22] And that is exactly what the scripture
[1:45:23] is saying. He was a perfect image, the
[1:45:27] express image of the son of God. He
[1:45:30] didn't come that way by accident.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't come that way just by going
[1:45:36] the easy route.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; And that was why when God spoke to him
[1:45:40] through a prophecy uh in in a French
[1:45:44] language said because you have chosen
[1:45:46] the harder way.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You think it was easy? No, it wasn't
[1:45:50] easy. Everybody chose a harder way.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I'll just I want to finish in a few
[1:46:05] minutes.
[1:46:14] I would just say dear friends, don't go
[1:46:16] out of this service and ever look on the
[1:46:19] message the same.
[1:46:22] Don't ever look on the word of God the
[1:46:24] same.
[1:46:28] Look for the that part that character
[1:46:32] that will develop character
[1:46:35] by the sharp tool.
[1:46:40] And I might say, you know what, it
[1:46:42] doesn't just have to come across the
[1:46:43] pulpit. No, it doesn't have to.
[1:46:48] The seed in you
[1:46:51] has a compelling force.
[1:46:54] And that compelling force is such that
[1:46:56] you cannot give it up.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; You've tried to walk away from it.
[1:47:00] You've said, "I this is too hard. I'll
[1:47:03] turn aside." You just can't turn aside.
[1:47:06] There's something within you that
[1:47:08] maintains the heat, the pressure.
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:23] And today,
[1:47:26] brother Brandham speaks of I want to
[1:47:28] speak of the son of man. 17 Luke 17:30.
[1:47:34] He said he had to fulfill the rest of
[1:47:36] it.
[1:47:38] Oh, hello
[1:47:40] dear friends
[1:47:43] beloved believers.
[1:47:46] Here we are. We're no different. You're
[1:47:48] no different at all than the believers
[1:47:50] that the Bible is written about. You're
[1:47:53] no different at all than the believers
[1:47:55] that are in the book of Acts. You're no
[1:47:57] different at all than the believers that
[1:47:59] suffered and died in the persecution.
[1:48:03] And we still may have that.
[1:48:06] I have a I have an email here which I
[1:48:09] can't read for you. And brother Tim is
[1:48:12] wondering what how much we can say.
[1:48:16] See this here?
[1:48:18] That is the testimony of the Catholic
[1:48:20] priest
[1:48:22] that came out of Uganda. I received it
[1:48:25] yesterday.
[1:48:28] You might like to have read it, but I
[1:48:31] can't let you read it. But I can tell
[1:48:34] you that he's in hiding just now,
[1:48:38] and we would like to get him to Kenya if
[1:48:41] possible
[1:48:42] just to have him removed.
[1:48:48] He was poisoned
[1:48:50] by the church
[1:48:53] and they had to call doctors doctors and
[1:48:56] when the doctor left he left his cell
[1:48:58] phone
[1:49:00] and that's how he was able to use the
[1:49:02] cell phone and get the pastor.
[1:49:13] I can't give you any details.
[1:49:16] really.
[1:49:17] I was born in a Catholic home.
[1:49:20] My relatives are still Catholics.
[1:49:24] My father was a alter boy at the at the
[1:49:27] Catholic church.
[1:49:30] And he would stand and look at the Bible
[1:49:34] on the shelf, but they were not the
[1:49:36] people were not allowed to read it. And
[1:49:39] he yearned so much to read that book.
[1:49:43] And one day behind the horses when they
[1:49:46] were turning over the furrow of a plow,
[1:49:50] something he said just came and just
[1:49:52] struck him in his chest and he fell to
[1:49:55] his knees in the fresh dirt, threw his
[1:49:57] hands to the air, and he said, "Oh God,
[1:49:59] if there is a God, alder boy,
[1:50:03] if there is a God, if you'll ever let me
[1:50:05] know that I can be forgiven and have my
[1:50:09] guilt, be forgiven my guilt, I'll I'll
[1:50:12] accept deputy. That very day, a few
[1:50:15] years later, he was invited into a home.
[1:50:19] I'm making this very brief.
[1:50:22] And he had seen two girls walking on the
[1:50:24] street, walking across the street in
[1:50:27] front of our little clapboard house in
[1:50:29] northern Saskatchewan. And those girls,
[1:50:32] you girls that may be young girls, young
[1:50:34] fellows,
[1:50:35] you never know this. And he saw these
[1:50:38] two girls and he looked on them. He
[1:50:39] said, "They look like angels if I could
[1:50:41] only have what they have."
[1:50:44] And a lady contacted him and said, "I
[1:50:46] understand do some carpenter work. I
[1:50:48] need some shelves built in my kitchen."
[1:50:51] He went over to the house, a little wee
[1:50:52] town of about 150 people. He went over
[1:50:55] to the house. When he walked in, there
[1:50:56] was the two girls.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; And she told him what kind of shelf
[1:51:01] she'd like to have built. And uh after
[1:51:04] after a few minutes, he was ready to go.
[1:51:06] And she said, "Mr. Biscll, have you ever
[1:51:08] been saved?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; He said, I don't know what that means.
[1:51:12] She said, that means your your sins can
[1:51:14] be forgiven. Oh, he said, if I could
[1:51:17] only know that my sins would be
[1:51:18] forgiven.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; And she said, we having church in a
[1:51:22] little in a house here. It was the early
[1:51:25] early flames of Pentecost was reaching
[1:51:28] northern British northern Saskatchewan.
[1:51:31] And he said, if you come, we have a
[1:51:33] service there Sunday. He said he related
[1:51:36] what happened as he plowed behind the
[1:51:38] horses and he told her. He said, "I
[1:51:40] promised God the day I would hear it, I
[1:51:42] would be I would accept him that very
[1:51:44] day." And I guess they slid out a couple
[1:51:47] of kitchen chairs. All I can tell you, I
[1:51:50] was about four years old and my father
[1:51:54] got up a transformed
[1:51:57] man. Totally transformed.
[1:52:00] Everything left him. The drink left him.
[1:52:03] The cigarettes left him if he smoked. I
[1:52:05] never saw him smoke, but he did they did
[1:52:08] make their own home brew and everything
[1:52:11] left him. He was a good dancer. He never
[1:52:15] ever had any struggle with anything. It
[1:52:17] was gone.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; That's a transforming power.
[1:52:22] My mother,
[1:52:24] staunch,
[1:52:25] staunch Catholic woman.
[1:52:28] And divorce or separation was unheard
[1:52:32] of.
[1:52:34] And my father went up to the attic in
[1:52:36] our little woodhouse and prayed for five
[1:52:40] weeks.
[1:52:41] And my mother was gloriously saved.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And according to my father, she was
[1:52:49] poisoned.
[1:52:51] She died at 32.
[1:52:56] Town nurse who was her friend from the
[1:52:59] Catholic community
[1:53:02] administered the medication.
[1:53:05] The pharmacist said that he would send
[1:53:07] the town nurse over. I've never related
[1:53:10] this to you. Just you know, we don't
[1:53:13] have to talk about history. We don't
[1:53:16] have to talk about 68 million. I lost my
[1:53:19] mother at 32 years old and a few years
[1:53:22] later because my father spent his entire
[1:53:25] herit inheritance and send tracks of
[1:53:28] converted nuns and converted priests.
[1:53:31] And this this this that I have we
[1:53:34] received yesterday involves some of the
[1:53:36] same things and converted Catholic
[1:53:39] priests and converted nuns and how they
[1:53:42] got converted and how the gospel came to
[1:53:45] them. Hallelujah. And I was working at a
[1:53:48] store at a Dawson home furnishings owned
[1:53:51] by two rigid rigid uh Lutheran men and
[1:53:58] we would talk about spiritual things
[1:54:00] often. They knew me. I knew them very
[1:54:02] very well and I was working for them. I
[1:54:06] came to store I came to the store one
[1:54:09] morning to work and they said
[1:54:13] one of one of the Catholic priests in
[1:54:15] the city visited us last night
[1:54:19] because my father had scattered these to
[1:54:22] every household
[1:54:24] and every farm. He spent his entire
[1:54:26] inheritance
[1:54:29] and the country went up like an atomic
[1:54:31] bomb.
[1:54:33] A woman called my stepmother.
[1:54:37] She breathing on the phone.
[1:54:39] She said, "I'd like to speak to Fred
[1:54:41] Biscll."
[1:54:43] My mother was very stepmother was very,
[1:54:45] very quiet. She said, "He's not in just
[1:54:48] now." She said,
[1:54:51] "I'd like to burn that pig."
[1:54:56] We're not going back in history, folks.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; You're looking at Ed Biscll. It cost me
[1:55:01] my mom.
[1:55:05] And my mom turned a little had nausea on
[1:55:08] her stomach
[1:55:11] and I stood in the doorway of the of the
[1:55:14] bedroom and a doctor was looking in her
[1:55:17] eyes
[1:55:18] and he said, "I'll just I'll prescribe
[1:55:20] some medication for her to hold food on
[1:55:23] her stomach and I believe she'll be
[1:55:25] fine."
[1:55:28] And my father went to the pharmacist who
[1:55:30] is also Catholic.
[1:55:36] And while he's mixing, they mix the
[1:55:38] medications in those days many times.
[1:55:41] And he's mixing the medication.
[1:55:44] And he said to my father,
[1:55:46] I I'll have the town nurse come over
[1:55:49] this evening and administer the
[1:55:51] medication.
[1:55:53] And my father said, "Oh, uh, he was just
[1:55:55] a simple man from the farm. He said, uh,
[1:55:57] the doctor didn't say anything about the
[1:55:59] town nurse having to come." No, he said,
[1:56:01] "I'll have to send the town nurse over
[1:56:05] and I'll send her this evening." And she
[1:56:06] came over. That town nurse happened to
[1:56:08] be my mother's dearest friend
[1:56:12] back from the farming community.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Both staunch Catholics
[1:56:20] and she came over that night and
[1:56:21] administered the medication. My mother
[1:56:23] never woke up. She was unconscious in
[1:56:26] the morning and they raced her by
[1:56:29] ambulance to the hospital, Catholic
[1:56:31] hospital
[1:56:33] and she was dead the next morning.
[1:56:39] That's brother Bis story.
[1:56:42] Do I believe this man's story? I guess I
[1:56:44] do.
[1:56:49] Somehow they can have all of their robes
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; and all of their tradition and all of
[1:56:56] their wonderful things and all of their
[1:56:59] wealth and all of their power,
[1:57:01] but in the heart,
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; what kind of book do they read
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; to produce that kind of a thing?
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; And they persecuted the church. And the
[1:57:11] prophet of God says it's the archeneemy
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; of the believers of the saints of God.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to know I know what I'm
[1:57:20] talking about.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I was raised without a mother.
[1:57:31] I don't want your sympathy. I want you
[1:57:33] to believe the truth.
[1:57:38] And this message has the capacity to
[1:57:40] attract a lot of persecution.
[1:57:44] And you think, I lost my friends. Oh,
[1:57:47] forget it.
[1:57:50] I think I'm having a hard time. I say,
[1:57:52] forget it.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; We don't know what persecution is.
[1:57:58] And I didn't tell you when the priest
[1:58:02] had visited my employers and said,
[1:58:05] "Until Mr. Biscll is gone, there's 2,000
[1:58:09] Catholics in this city and not no one
[1:58:12] will patronize Dawson Home Furnishings
[1:58:15] until he's gone."
[1:58:18] And the next morning,
[1:58:21] they told me they'd been visited. What
[1:58:24] had been said? We would like you to put
[1:58:26] an ad, a quarter page ad in the paper.
[1:58:29] We will pay for it and disassociate
[1:58:32] yourself from what your father's
[1:58:35] distributing. I said, I may not use the
[1:58:39] same method that he's used using, but I
[1:58:44] cannot deny the things that are in the
[1:58:47] packages.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; And I said, I won't put you under the
[1:58:50] pressure
[1:58:52] of laying me off or firing me. I will
[1:58:55] leave. I left and I came down to the
[1:58:58] native Indians.
[1:59:00] That's my story.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I want to say this.
[1:59:23] You were made.
[1:59:26] You were made for these words.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Not what I'm preaching. You were made
[1:59:30] for this message.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; You were actually made for it in God's
[1:59:35] mind. He had you formed.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; He had you with certain associates. He
[1:59:40] had you living beside somebody. He had
[1:59:42] you working beside somebody. He had you
[1:59:45] going to church beside somebody. He gave
[1:59:48] you an invitation. God gave you an
[1:59:50] invitation. God in that person gave you
[1:59:52] an invitation.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; You read a book, you read the scripture,
[1:59:58] something and then it quickened you.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the prophet of God
[2:00:02] never tried to convince me about the
[2:00:04] message ever.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; He read Malachi. He he quoted Malachi 4.
[2:00:09] And I just said, "Of course."
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; He quoted four scriptures on false
[2:00:14] anointed ones. I said, "Of course. Why
[2:00:17] in the world couldn't I see that?
[2:00:20] He quoted scripture,
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; but the scripture in his mouth became a
[2:00:24] different book.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to say to you
[2:00:28] tonight. That's not a figment of my
[2:00:30] imagination. That's absolutely the
[2:00:32] truth. When you hear the words out of
[2:00:34] the mouth of Jesus Christ or one of his
[2:00:37] servants, it will sound different than
[2:00:39] if you just read it yourself. Or you may
[2:00:42] read it yourself if the Holy Spirit
[2:00:44] quickens it to you.
[2:00:49] And then I want to conclude simply by
[2:00:51] saying this and I'm going to be done.
[2:00:53] I'm sorry to hold you.
[2:01:07] I have a scripture I want to read.
[2:01:15] My my
[2:01:18] I shortened up I shortened up what I
[2:01:22] have to say.
[2:01:27] But there's a scripture
[2:01:32] my my my
[2:01:35] there's a scripture in Revelation
[2:01:39] and the scripture tells us
[2:01:43] and I heard is it where are you
[2:01:46] listening
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; just when I close and as I heard is it
[2:01:50] where a voice of a great multitude and
[2:01:54] as the voice of many waters and as the
[2:01:57] voice of mighty thunderings saying
[2:02:00] hallelujah
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; for the Lord God omnipotent reignth
[2:02:05] that's what I'm talking about
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; let us be glad
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; let us rejoice
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; and give honor to him
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; for the marriage of the lamb has come
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; there was no such thing when Eve was
[2:02:24] brought to Adam and the same God came
[2:02:27] down and took her out from Adam and
[2:02:31] brought the woman to the man. Nobody
[2:02:33] sang.
[2:02:35] Nobody rejoiced. No multitude rejoiced.
[2:02:39] But when this multitude, when this group
[2:02:42] of people, and you will hear it for
[2:02:45] yourself.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Roy, when we come to
[2:02:48] the marriage supper, there's going to be
[2:02:51] singing.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; It won't depend on you. There's going to
[2:02:55] be shouting.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; The Lord God omnipotent reignth.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; His attributes,
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; his attributes are coming.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; The begotten son and his wife are being
[2:03:14] united.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Have I gone over the end? Well, I tell
[2:03:24] you what, friends. To me, it's just so
[2:03:26] wonderful. It's just so wonderful. The
[2:03:30] purpose of God. What are we doing here?
[2:03:32] It's part of the purpose of God. I don't
[2:03:35] know the fullness of it. I don't know
[2:03:36] what's going to happen the next five
[2:03:38] minutes. Maybe we'll all be out of here.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe it?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:52] And just so that you'll know,
[2:03:55] he was made the perfect image,
[2:03:59] but this might surprise you.
[2:04:02] And Jesus said unto him,
[2:04:05] speaking to Satan, do you know that
[2:04:08] Satan tried to take the word?
[2:04:11] He tried to take it and use it. He tried
[2:04:14] to take the carving tool
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; and use it on the word himself.
[2:04:20] He tried to improve Jesus Christ. He
[2:04:23] said, "Fall down. It's written."
[2:04:28] That's what he said. It is written. And
[2:04:31] Jesus answered him, said to him, "It is
[2:04:34] written again, thou shalt not tempt the
[2:04:36] Lord thy God."
[2:04:40] And then Jesus said, "Get hence, Satan,
[2:04:43] for it is written, "Thou shalt worship
[2:04:45] the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
[2:04:48] thou serve." You You might think that
[2:04:50] that's just back there. No, sir. It's
[2:04:53] right now today. He'll use every kind of
[2:04:56] economic tactic to get us to bow down to
[2:04:59] our our profession or bow down to
[2:05:03] whatever and and and rob us and steal
[2:05:06] from us.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; You might think I better get away from
[2:05:11] that. No, I'm going to pour it on.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; You must remain the master of your
[2:05:17] economics,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; the master of your education,
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; the master of your worship.
[2:05:24] Can you say amen to it?
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; And there may be a time where you have
[2:05:31] to say, Satan, it is written,
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; get hence.
[2:05:37] [Music]
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; For this is he whom it is written,
[2:05:42] Behold, I send my messenger,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; and said unto them, it is written, my
[2:05:46] house shall be called a house of prayer.
[2:05:49] The son of man goeth as it is written of
[2:05:51] him and woe unto the man by whom the son
[2:05:54] of man is betrayed.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "For it is written, I will
[2:05:58] smite the shepherd and the sheep of the
[2:06:01] flock shall be scattered." Do you think
[2:06:03] the shepherd enjoyed the smiting? No.
[2:06:05] But it was written
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; and the sharp tool was there and he
[2:06:10] said, "Here I am. I will not run from my
[2:06:13] responsibility
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; of being the shepherd of the flock." Oh,
[2:06:18] glory to our great shepherd.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Thus it is written, and
[2:06:22] thus it behooved Christ to suffer." And
[2:06:24] we say, "Amen."
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; At is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a
[2:06:28] stumbling stone, and the seals came."
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it was written,
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; and thus it shall be.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Are you tired of it? But as written, eye
[2:06:43] hath not seen, nor ear hath heard.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Neither hath it entered into the heart
[2:06:48] of man. Hello man,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; raise your hands.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; It's not entered into our hearts the
[2:06:54] things that God has prepared prepared
[2:06:57] for them that love him.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Then said I, lo, I come in the volume of
[2:07:03] the book. It is written of me. And we
[2:07:06] want to say, "Lo, I come in the volume
[2:07:10] of this word of God for this hour.
[2:07:13] Hallelujah. I will shy away from none of
[2:07:15] it. For it is written of me, I'm a
[2:07:18] believer.
[2:07:27] And it is written.
[2:07:31] I'm closing now.
[2:07:33] It is written.
[2:07:36] I will put my laws
[2:07:39] into their mind.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; I will write them on their hearts
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; and I will be their God
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; and they shall be my people. And I say,
[2:07:54] "It is written,
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; and thus it shall be."
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Will you stand to your feet, please?
[2:08:09] Wonder if we could have the musicians.
[2:08:15] Not going to keep you because we our
[2:08:17] service is at 4:00.
[2:08:20] the saints, you that have come from
[2:08:21] Seattle, how I appreciate you coming
[2:08:24] from the Seattle Tacoma Reon area.
[2:08:32] I want to thank you for your prayers
[2:08:33] that have prayed for me during this week
[2:08:38] and I have certainly
[2:08:40] given my best to this message
[2:08:44] and I trust that you will go away from
[2:08:47] this place thinking about how great is
[2:08:50] my God.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; How great is his name?
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:58] Heavenly Father,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; we love you.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; I say that we love you because I include
[2:09:06] myself with this body of people, with
[2:09:10] those that are perhaps streaming.
[2:09:13] And I pray and ask that there will be
[2:09:15] such a divine presence that you will so
[2:09:19] present yourself with your children that
[2:09:22] they may indeed have that comfort of
[2:09:24] your nearness that they may know God
[2:09:28] that you understand. and for those that
[2:09:31] are going through a difficult time, for
[2:09:34] those that may be at a time in sorrow.
[2:09:36] And I pray for our beloved brother in
[2:09:39] Uganda.
[2:09:41] Oh God, make a way where there is no
[2:09:44] way. I pray that you'll come on his
[2:09:46] behalf. Father, let him know that you
[2:09:49] are the protector of the sheep.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; You will not allow anything undo and
[2:09:56] unwarranted to come to him. And yet you
[2:09:59] do not protect us from every hardship.
[2:10:02] We we that are going through hardships.
[2:10:05] I pray that you'll give grace. Grace
[2:10:08] more abundantly that we may be joyful
[2:10:11] and happy
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; in the hardship. Oh God, whatever it is,
[2:10:15] we're not here to escape hardship. We're
[2:10:18] here to face it and confront it and say
[2:10:21] with the songwriter, I'm going through
[2:10:23] Jesus. I'm going through. Oh, we bless
[2:10:27] your holy name. Thank you for this time
[2:10:29] we've had together. Thank you for your
[2:10:31] word. Thank you for the truth of your
[2:10:33] message, oh God, and how you've
[2:10:35] confirmed it to us. Jesus, be glorified,
[2:10:38] I pray in your holy name.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing. How great is our
[2:10:46] God.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:12:19] will oh God a different tempo and if you
[2:12:24] just would like to
[2:12:26] consecrate yourself as I did as I I was
[2:12:29] singing this at home I want to do thy
[2:12:32] will oh Lord
[2:12:37] thy will
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:43] I want you.
[2:12:46] I will

[2:12:54] Take me.
[2:12:56] Take me.
[2:12:58] Oh
[2:12:59] me and make me. I want to do.
[2:13:04] I will.
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:09] I'd like to before we sing it once
[2:13:11] again. I'd like you to look at the words
[2:13:13] on the on the screen, please. And will
[2:13:16] you read them with me? I want to do thy
[2:13:20] will, oh Lord. I want to do thy will, oh
[2:13:26] Lord. Take me, break me, mold me, and
[2:13:32] make me. I want to do thy will. Is that
[2:13:37] your desire? Take me. That's why I sing
[2:13:41] it now. That's why I'm giving it to you.
[2:13:42] Take me, break me, mold me, and make me.
[2:13:48] I want to do thy will, oh God. Just once
[2:13:51] more and then we're going to be
[2:13:52] dismissed. I want to do
[2:13:56] thy will,
[2:13:58] oh Lord.
[2:14:03] I want to do.
[2:14:06] I will
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:13] take me.
[2:14:15] Break me
[2:14:17] [Music]
[2:14:20] and make me. I want to do
[2:14:24] my
[2:14:30] understanding.
[2:14:32] Some of you may be asking and wondering
[2:14:34] within your own heart
[2:14:38] things that brother Brand Brother Biscll
[2:14:40] said today I've never heard before
[2:14:43] why did he hold that back so long.
[2:14:47] Well, I tell you what, friend.
[2:14:50] There just a lot of things,
[2:14:53] a lot of things that you just hold back.
[2:14:57] Then there may come a right moment and
[2:15:00] today was the right moment for the
[2:15:02] testimony I gave that little segment of
[2:15:05] my life.
[2:15:07] Friends,
[2:15:08] we're not we're not preaching sermons.
[2:15:12] These are realities.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; This message is a reality and it has the
[2:15:17] answer.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; It has the answer for our lives.
[2:15:23] We'll pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you
[2:15:26] for this kind
[2:15:28] audience,
[2:15:30] respectful,
[2:15:32] listening,
[2:15:34] hearing, absorbing,
[2:15:36] taking it and internalizing your word.
[2:15:41] Lord Jesus, I pray for every brother and
[2:15:45] sister in this building as we're
[2:15:48] preparing for Lord's table. I pray that
[2:15:53] you will dismiss us now with your grace.
[2:15:57] Lord Jesus, as you walked with the
[2:15:58] disciples, you ended your message. You
[2:16:02] ended your parable, whatever it was,
[2:16:06] then the people went and pondered. I'm
[2:16:09] asking that the Holy Spirit which we
[2:16:12] have received cause us to think about
[2:16:15] these things to ponder them and our
[2:16:18] pondering will cause us to open our
[2:16:20] hearts to you and say, "Oh Lord, I want
[2:16:23] to do thy will. Oh God, take me, Lord,
[2:16:28] break me, mold me, and make me. I want
[2:16:31] to do thy will. Bless the people I pray
[2:16:35] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[2:16:37] Amen. Amen. I want to just say you're
[2:16:41] dismissed and thank you for being
[2:16:42] patient with me. It took a little time
[2:16:45] to lay the foundation. Shake hands with
[2:16:47] one another and bid them God's speed and
[2:16:49] we'll see you at 4:00. Lord,
[2:16:52] God bless you.
