I'm going to ask our brother Tim Dodd if he would just come open the service for us in a word of prayer. We have a testimony. We want to give glory to God. We prayed for our brother Jorge Flores in Argentina who had a stroke. He is already in the process of healing and was even able to speak on the phone this past week. They want to thank us for our prayers and send greetings. Amen. We just pray for a complete healing for our brother Jorge. Brother Tom Freys asked that we'd remember his sister-in-law Helina Frey. Yesterday she asked for prayer. She has found out she has cancer for the second time and has given up hope. Even started smoking again. And we just ask that God would grant her salvation, deliverance from smoking and her healing. Amen. There's something on your heart that you just like to raise before the Lord as our brother Tim would come. Amen. Just let it be known with an upraised hand. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, when has there been an age where a people could sing with all their hearts, "It's already done. The battle is over. The book has been redeemed. The lamb has claimed his bride. Or the people have responded to the call. Lord, we're rejoicing in what you've done. Lord, we're not looking forward or looking back. We're in the presence of the living God. Lord, we're living in your realities at this moment. And we know you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, your redemptive blessings are here this morning. We thank you for what you did for the brother in Chile. Lord, thank you for the touch. Lord, we know he's a wonderful brother and we just give you praise and honor and glory for the change that you did in his mortal body. In a moment of need, you came on the scene and provided. And Lord, there might be many this morning, oh God, that have the same need or a a need in their bodies. Lord, touch them even now, Lord. We pray as your word goes forth, may the virtue flow from your word into the lives as is necessary this morning. Whatever the need might be, it might not be physical. It might be financial. It might be spiritual. It might be emotional. Lord, there's different levels. But Lord, may you pour out your spirit to the meeting of each and every situation. We believe it. We claim it. And Lord, we remember this woman, oh God, from the Frey family in need, Lord, this morning. Lord, I I read the request. Father, I remember one day that there was a blind man called Bararddmus sitting by the side of the road and he be to cry out, "Oh, thou son of David, have mercy on me." Lord, this woman's not a believer. But Lord, we're crying out on her behalf. Oh, son of man, have mercy on her. Lord, reach down to where she is this morning. She's in need. Lord, have mercy on her. We pray. Maybe there be somebody this morning that feels that way in their own lives. Oh Lord, have mercy on me this morning. We're crying out to you and we believe as a predestinated seed touched your heart 2,000 years ago and stopped you and received a blessing. May your virtue be met to every need this morning. We pray. We're so thankful to have brother Ed back, brother Biscoll back with us, Lord. We thank you for him. We ask that you'll anoint him, strengthen him, use him this morning for our benefit. You know our hearts. You know our expectations, our needs. Bless him, Lord. We pray. Bless every exercise of this service. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] Amen.

Why don't they come and get ready? And as they're coming, why don't we sing Greater than all greater than all my sin. Oh, greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me. Is the grace that still sets me free. Lord to praise him and I above I'm walking in this light and I cannot fall for it's greater than all. The love that I see it once more is greater than all.

I cannot fall for it's greater than all. The blood I will sing. I know the blood supply of life. Oh, and I know the light of life. I'm walking in goodness of life. And I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb. [Music] [Music] Lord, I'm trying to find the words to say. how much I really love you, Lord. And I'm trying to find the words to say how much I really care. But it seems like words are not enough to express this love. I feel you're wonderful. So wonderful, Lord. You're wonderful in every single way. More beautiful than words could ever say. Lord, I love you and all I want is more of you. You're wonderful. You're beautiful and I'm so in love with you. You were there for me when no one's there to comfort and protect me. And you gave me strength to keep resting on when all my strength is gone. You died for me upon the cross. You drive away my fears and doubts. What would I do without you? Lord, you're wonderful in every single way. More beautiful than words could ever say. Lord, I love you and all I want is more of you. You're wonderful. You're beautiful. And I'm so in love with you. When I see your grace and mercy and the love that you outore, I just can't help but love you, Lord, more and more.

We're going to invite our brother Ed to come take the baby dedication. Gina and brother Eugene Vanenko are going to come. And as they come, why don't we just sing my Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine. Number 802 is our brother. Oh my Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. For thee all the bies of sin resound my gracious redeemer. Oh my savior art thou. If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. I love thee because Oh, I love thee because thou hast first love me and merces my Oh, [Music] I love your [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Amen. God bless you, brother Eugene. Brother Kenny, said Regina. God bless you. Well, we've added another one to the family of God. Amen. Um, brother Eugene and sister Gina have brought their son and uh to be uh not only dedicated but and I know they don't bring him to a man to a person or to a church but I know that they're doing this because it is in the scripture and they brought them to the Lord Jesus Christ and he and he said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not. &gt;&gt; I asked brother Eugene in an email. I said, "Give me his names and give me why you called him these names." And I was touched by that, uh, Brother Eugene. And I'm going to say just a little bit about it. They've named their son first Paul being humble or small and he said uh the name Paul is after my grandfather who was a minister of a small Pentecostal church. As a little boy I knew him to be a perfect example of a Christian man. And even in time of communism, people respected him for his Christian stand. So the first I was affected by the fact that brother Eugene was influenced and affected as a little boy and your son will be a little boy in not too many years. The second name they called him Vladimir to rule with greatness. And he said, "The name Vladimir is after my father whom once again I noted I look up to as the best Christian that I know because I see his life, his everyday life and he lives for Christ." And the third name was after yourself if Guinea wellborn. If Guinea is after me as I try to be the best Christian that I can. And I want him to grow up to be a Christian no matter what he becomes in life as long as he is a Christian. And I took those three uh brother Eugene and I thought uh here's a a man and I'll come to you in a moment Jana but here's a a young man and he's naming his son and he thinks of what affected him when he was a boy then what is affecting him now as a man a young married man I respected my grandfather for his Christians stand even under difficulties and persecution and I respected my father. I respect him now. I see his everyday life and he's a Christian. My grandfather's a Christian. My father's a Christian and I seek to be influenced and live the kind of lives that they live. And so I say to you, Brother Eugene, keep the heritage going. Okay. Let it live on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If time should go on and this son should raise and be a young man and marry and have a child, may he be able to stand where you're standing &gt;&gt; and say, "And my father, left an example for me." &gt;&gt; The grandparents of these this child, both grandparents are believers. on Sister Gina's side and brother Eugene's side and we're so thankful for their godly lives. And I was thinking as a mother, Sister Gina, how you, the prophet said, you no doubt will hold your son's hand when he maybe takes his first step. And you will certainly be holding his hands and guiding him as he takes his first steps. But it won't end there. I want to ask you that you shall walk and both of you shall walk so he can see your footsteps and say, "I'm not ashamed of their footsteps. I'm not ashamed of the way they conducted their lives and and and teach him that the things you're bringing them here to the house of God to be dedicated. Bring them to the house of God." You don't even know when they're so small and such infants, yet they they come under the atmosphere. They feel the presence of God and they're moved by it. And then you need to go home and teach them what it is they felt and what that presence of God is like. And he said, "Your life," the prophet said, "your life will impress your children and have influence on your children by the example that you set before them." So may God direct you in such a way as my prayer. And my prayer is that, and I even type my prayer before I take your boy and pray for him, is that he will be molded by the presence of the Holy Spirit. and that the and that the preaching of the word in the house of God that his life will be molded by that and that you as his parents will teach him how to put into practice the godly things that he hears in the services. Amen. We're going to dedicate what shall I call him. Eugene Vladimir Paul. Paul. God bless Paul. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I hold this gem that you have dropped down and given to our sister Gina and brother Eugene, their first son. They've called him Paul. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that there'll be just a part of the Apostle Paul that'll be upon him. I pray oh God that that inheritance and and characteristics of his grandfather and his father Lord Jesus will be imparted to him by the Holy Spirit. I dedicate him now to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that Paul Vladimir will live for Christ and may his life be a testimony oh God for you. I pray, oh father, in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll keep him in good health and give him long life if our Lord Jesus shall continue and allow that. And I pray you'll bless sister Gina, father, as she holds him in the home, as she feeds him, as she directs his life. I pray, oh God, that you'll bless this couple. Bless them with divine wisdom in a very wicked generation. And may their light be a place of home, Father, and then in their home of light, oh God. And that light will prevail in their son's life. In the name of Jesus Christ, for the glory of God, I pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you, Sister Gina. Hallelujah. Praise God. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers. My wife and I were away on some rest time and we enjoyed it very much. Well, we're doing a lot of uh we have a full day. We've got baby dedications. We have baptisms. We have the preaching of the word. We have Lord's supper. and foot washing. And isn't this wonderful? Hallelujah. And by the time we're done a time like that, somebody should be getting saved. We we've had that happen also. Looking down, Sister Debbie Gier, she came in on a day like this. I think we her we baptized her husband, believe it was. We had Lord's table and we had foot washing. By the time we were done all that, I went back to talk to her and her eyes were her eyes were just red with tears, all almost bloodshot. I could see then uh she was done. &gt;&gt; And about two weeks after that, we had her in the tank as well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Says, "Rejoice with them that rejoice." And so we have uh our brother brother Hughes message and sister Sylvia have just are celebrating their 50 one days of marriage 51st anniversary &gt;&gt; uh to the day. Amen. Brother Hugh has said that they were joined together in the presence of God as husband and wife and such was his love for us that he blessed us with five beautiful daughters. Uh I thought I did well at three but five beautiful daughters and they in turn blessed them with nine grandchildren. And there was a time, he said, in the darkest of nights when the storms of life almost sunk this ship. But the good Lord, who is mighty in battle in our darkest hour, placed his right foot on the prow of the boat. And to the winds of the strife and contention in our lives, he simply commanded them to cease. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can rejoice with them that rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Peace." And to the waves of man's foolishness and strife, he commanded them to be still. That's very lovely. Brother Hugh, without his sovereign hand in our lives, that which God had joined together, we would have been torn aunder. But to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. &gt;&gt; Let this be a testimony not only here, but to all those that may be streaming in whatever country. And friends, I'm happy again to be able to say today we hear from all over the world. We heard from Malawi in the last we heard from Singapore in the last few days. And we're just so delighted that this service today we can reach out with our rejoicing and with our testimony whether it be Norway or any place in Europe or our friends in Switzerland. How we love to we've established this hasn't been overnight, friends, but this has been for a long time. And as they as the camera uh you know uh spans or the congregation uh we go to many many places and they say where's brother so and so and where's sister so and so and they they've listened so intently they hear the names and different ones introduced or spoken to and and we'll probably hear how's brother Hugh and Sister Sylvia someday and we'll just say just fine and brother Hugh is finished we love you and our deeply appreciative of your kindness and especially of your prayers. Amen. &gt;&gt; This last last few days, uh, we've had one of us, one of our people leave, not of this church, but did come to this church for quite a long time. Brother Harp Senior, Brother Dalton Harp Senior, has gone to be in the presence of the Lord. And so, he's rejoicing. So, we're not going to be sad about it, but we're remembering the family, the entire family. And I have I had one picture and then brother Frank Prader had the service just this morning. So, this is uh just in the last uh few hours, last couple two, three hours. And for those of you that remember our brother Dalton, uh, Dalton Harp Senior, his son Dalton and Teresa, their family went here for years. And, uh, they're down in Arkansas. Also, Brother Harp Senior, and his wife, Sister Mary, they were attending here for years and are at brother Frank Prader's church. So, I thought I would just show a couple of these slides. Uh this is as of this morning and uh passed on September 13th. So this is the 16th. There they are as a young family, lovely, handsome family. And Sister Debbie and brother Mark Lowry. Sister Debbiey's a daughter. She's standing there, the tallest one. This is the life he loved. He even looked like that when he was playing a guitar. How many enjoyed his singing while he was here? Amen. I'm That's me baptizing him in a horse trough. So I thought that that is in keeping. And I baptized six and uh and several of them were quite a bit over six foot. And I studied the end of that tank and I said to them, I said, "You fellas better bend your knees a little bit while I put you down. I don't want to strike your head on the end of this tank." Uh, and I finished Brother Harp Senior and I had finished I think six of them and uh baptized. The water was cold incidentally. And then then there came a minister and his brother J. shepherd and he was dressed in one of the nicest powder blue suits that I've seen. It was uh had a vest, a four-piece suit or three-piece suit, and he had his old vested and he was just as prim. He was ready for the pullpit. He said, "I want to be baptized." I had already changed. So, they run in. I had to put my wet clothes on again and come out. And I saw him in that beautiful powder blue suit. It was just too pretty to put in that water. And I said I said, "Well, do you have some baptismal clothes?" He said, "Just like this." I said, "Well, do you have something to change into?" He said, "Just baptize me." I tell you, he was urgent. So I stepped in my wet clothes and he stepped in his beautiful powder blue suit and I baptized him in his suit. I don't know how much it shrunk after that but anyway he didn't care and I didn't care. Hallelujah. And the testimony kept rolling on. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's uh brother Dalton with his two sons and gr and step and son-in-law. Oh, I should say brother Mark Lowry. There he is in one of his favorite poses. And I guess that's with them, too. I don't recognize him. That brother Prader is over here. Second from Brother Mark. And there they are at their 50th wedding anniversary also in 205. God bless our brother Harp and you remember the family in prayer. They're going to miss him. He's got uh a lot of grandchildren and and great grandchildren. So, we're so thankful. Are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just stand to our feet? And before we open the scriptures, let's just pray. Nice to see you all here and saints from Seattle, Tacoma coming for the communion tonight. We're thankful, Father. how indebted we are and how thankful we are. Oh God, we just are rejoicing in your salvation. We're rejoicing in the deliverance. We're rejoicing in the victory over all the powers of the enemy. Oh God, we're mindful of the day that you redeemed us and you called us out of our life of doubt and unbelief and sin and how you have set us free and set us in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Oh God, and we're rejoicing today that we can be gathered together in this time of fellowship. I pray that the sweet Holy Spirit will come and just bind our hearts in a wonderful, wonderful bond of love and peace. And I ask, Father, that you will give great liberty to your word now and give great revelation to our hearts that we might understand something more of this great eternal God. Oh, how great is our God and how marvelous are your ways past finding out. I pray that you will anoint father my my voice and anoint oh god my mind and the hearts of the people in the name of Jesus Christ. Let your word be as it is a living word &gt;&gt; healing wording &gt;&gt; delivering word and I pray that the supernatural will be in attendance with us father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to break from the normal. Do you mind that? &gt;&gt; I've been singing a song to myself and uh I think you know it, Elena. I was there when Jesus saved me. I was there when he saved me. Under the life he gave me. He took away my heavy burden. How many know it? We've sung it here many times. [Music] The very one my free. Oh, he took away my heavy burden and he gave me peace with him. Tried to take me down to me down. I was there when halfway and I guess I ought to know. I was there when Jesus saved me. The very moment he forgave me. Think about it. He took away my heavy burden and he gave me peace with him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan tries to make me doubt it. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to shout it. shouting. &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; And I guess my heart ought to know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just felt I had that breakth [Music] on a Sunday morning. You weren't expecting that. But I've been singing that. I was there &gt;&gt; when it happened. &gt;&gt; No use anybody arguing about it. I was there. They're too late. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You like that, don't you? &gt;&gt; I was there when Jesus saved me. The very moment he forgave me, he took away my heavy burden and he gave me peace within me. I'm sorry. I ought to know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That should give us a good start. &gt;&gt; I want you to turn in the Bible, please, to Ephesians, the 5th chapter, and we're going to read three verses there. verses 14- 16. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. &gt;&gt; And those are the words I want you to remember in this service this morning. Remember redeeming the time because the days are evil. Please turn back to Psalms the 90th chapter and we'll read a few verses starting with verse 4 down through verse 12. For a thousand years in thy sight, or but as yesterday, when it is passed, and as a watch in the night, thou carest them away as with a flood. They are asleep. In the morning they are like grass, which groweth up. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up. In the evening it is cut down, and witherth. For we are consumed in thy by thine anger, and by thy wrath. Are we troubled? Thou hast set our iniquities before thee. Our secret sins are in the light of thy countenance. For all thy days are passed away in thy wrath. We spend our years as a tale that is told. The days of our years are three score years and 10. And if by reason of strength they be four score years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow. For it is soon cut off, and we fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine anger, even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. So the scripture says our our years are three score years and 10 and if by reason of strength they be four score years yet is their strength and labor and sorrow. And we're I I'm very pleased today that we have someone who God has given a lot more strength to and that's our brother Henry Hayes Senior. Our brother Henry Hayes right back here in the middle section I believe. I believe he's been given extra strength to about 93 years, isn't it? Is that about it? &gt;&gt; 94. &gt;&gt; 95. And standing there, do I hear 96? Hallelujah. I believe our brother Hayes should have a hand. I baptized brother Hayes in this tank &gt;&gt; and here he is this morning. God bless you all as you have your seats. &gt;&gt; I'll need to have your full attention. I hope I am able to say something that you can take away from here. I've been pondering this service for uh probably three weeks and I spent a good deal of the time away while I was away because I couldn't shake it and I couldn't get away from it. And furthermore, it's challenging. You know, we have a we have a a great eternal God who we as humans sometimes we are always, you know, we are we are so inclined to put him into a box and to try to bring him into this realm and you can't do that because he'll never he's eternal. &gt;&gt; So, I'm I'm going to challenge your mind and your thoughts today. And I want you to apply it to be able to apply it into your own lives. I'm I've entitled this message something I've never spoken on or tried to approach quite like this. But what is time? Begin to ask myself the question, what is time? And I thought another title I'd like to have given it is living in the now for the moment. And I read what some scientists have said and but brother Brandham he talked about uh I don't know whether he was speaking about Einstein. I was looking for the quote, but he spoke about, you know, the scientists and the those that delve into the beginnings of the earth and the big bang theory and all of this evolution and so on. But he was speaking about Einstein, I believe it was, and he just said that they what they were missing was the supernatural aspect. said that scientists had broken into God's laboratory, but they've just missed the supernatural aspect. If you take the equation, if you take God out of the equation, then the equation won't won't make any sense. &gt;&gt; And so that's why they're still trying to find that speck, that smallest of uh a particle. And they keep coming up with they find they think they found the god particle. And then if they can find the smallest, most minute, most invisible almost to the naked eye. It would be invisible to the naked eye. They have hopes that they would be able to understand the universe. Well, if they just read the Bible, they could understand the universe. &gt;&gt; But somehow it's not within their being to to just believe. &gt;&gt; And and yet they want other people to believe what you don't see. So, well, I can't see a quark, but but it's there because we can determine that, you know, light curves and what whatever more. I'd like to I'd like to suggest to you also that brother Brennham was tied into science in a big way, in a major way. And I've got a number of quotes. So, I'm going to go I I want to first just give you I have some things some slides here as well. And uh I want to have you read some with me. This is just how it came to me and I wanted to start the service with this. God the creator created the heavens and the earth and all things therein. Remember that's the only thing that Satan couldn't do. That's critical at this point. God the creator created this profusion of life and things which Satan could not do. Concluding his creation with one in his own likeness, Adam, putting him into time space. And that phrase time space is one that brother Brham used. It's a very scientific phrase and scientists and physicists use it and brother Brandham has used it many times starting very very early in his ministry. God allowed the fall of creation. He knew there would be a fall. He allowed the fall of creation to display his power and attributes of redemption. He created time as we know it as seasons in which he would manifest his great being that through the revelation of himself, his will and plan to ultimately destroy Satan, his enemy and the d the and the destroyer of his creation. And here's a quote I want to I'm giving you these two to begin with. Now this great chain of perfection, this is in the message perfection. Now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space. One of the times he uses it. Time came because of Sam. I'd like you all to say that with me. Time came because of sin. That is that is critical to my message this morning. What is time? Why is there time or is there time? Scientists some of the some of the senior scientists in the world believe believe and it's true. I believe it's true. There is no time. God created or brought about time so that his creature who he created could have something to relate to night and day &gt;&gt; and so on and so we'll go into it quite deeply because of sin he said let's draw a picture of time let's see a perfect circle forever, forever. And then all of all at once, sin dropped in and put a little hickey. Brother Bren had his wife call it a hickey or a little drop in that chain. That chain was a perfect circle. And so it comes down. Now, eternity continues on, but it's not in its perfect condition. There's a little gap comes down and breaks over this way. goes out this way. And God had to do that because Satan had caused it. And it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and the perfection and for the purging of the lost. That God by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hickey or gap back into the perfect circle. And then she rolls on just the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. We read, "We've had years now. There hasn't been so much done. Notice now all the references to time. We've had years now. There hasn't been too much done. But I truly believe that we're entering into the greatest time this world has ever seen. I certainly believe that there's coming a time that it's at hand now of God going to make himself manifested. the greatest he's ever done in all ages. I want to suggest to you that as Christians, as believers, we don't really have time as such. What they are is seasons of God's manifestation. He determines within his own great being. He'll manifest himself a certain way. He'll do certain things for a certain season. Then you can't bring it back. It's gone. So we say, well, that ended, you know, in in 1865. That's our calculation. It just all it was with God. He ceased that movement. He ceased that that he Jesus had seven messengers in his hand. So he sends one out. And we say, well, it's a certain time. All it is with God, he determines that in his great plan. Now it now it comes that he wants to reveal himself a certain way. So he sends a certain message and a certain group believes it and a certain group doesn't believe it and they go their ways and some are in cemeteries and and others are in a great host of witnesses someplace and then comes another message and then comes another one. Then come what is it? it. They are events of the eternal God just revealing himself in a continuation of creation &gt;&gt; in bringing back the perfection &gt;&gt; of that which fell. &gt;&gt; And I and and I will bring it to you in and I'm going to be repeating myself. I really believe that this season or what scientists are trying to determine is time and what is time and what was the origin and if we could only figure out the origin. I believe that everything that we know of and see as a as humanity and creation. I believe that God created this little orb called the earth with a profusion of life and creation &gt;&gt; to demonstrate to Satan, his archeneemy who had been cast to the earth that he can't do that. &gt;&gt; This is one thing you've always lusted to do and this is one thing you can't do. You were son of the morning and you were you were one of the leading angels, but you you lusted after and desired and were lifted up in pride. And here's something you can't do. And he creates all the things and the living creatures and the oceans are full of all kinds of creatures and all kinds of creatures on the earth and animals and so on so forth and ends up with his son, one like himself. And this is something Satan you can't do. And God knew that Satan was going to come and the fall was going to come. And so the second thing I believe that he intended to do is that he in in this season of manifestation, this series of seasons of manifestation of himself. I it's it's irrelevant to me how many thousands of years or millions of years or whatever it takes, but God was going to final finally come to the great climactic event of destroying his enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and this little hickey or this little drop in the perfect circle of eternity is going to come back up. And during this time and all of these seasons of events are only seasons of redemption. &gt;&gt; And in each one there's a group of people that believes it. &gt;&gt; They believe the prophets. &gt;&gt; They believed in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And some doubted and they went their way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And all the messages of the messengers come. And and then the last one has to be a prophet. Why? Because the word of God, the word which was Christ has to come to him &gt;&gt; in a certain way. &gt;&gt; I want you to pray, "God, give me a spirit of revelation &gt;&gt; this morning. Not tomorrow. Today, now. He says this is the ending up of the time and time will be no more one of these days. Uh we come out of eternity stepped into a little time space here and stepped out of time back into eternity. Uh we was before there was a world. Then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now. And now in here we've had our savior come in here in this life in this world. We've had our savior come here to the earth. God himself made himself manifested. That's one of the seasons. You didn't live in the time Jesus was here on earth. We would have liked to, many of us. God chose that you should not live here when he was here on earth. God chose that you would live in another season. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, if I'd only lived then, I'd have I'd have done this or I'd have done that." No, you'd have done exactly what you're doing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he made himself manifested to us and give us the hope of everlasting life, eternal life. I'll come on to well maybe I'll just carry on here a little bit. Time is a very precious commodity. You have been given a very small portion of it to manage. Every person is given the same amount to spend each day. It cannot be rolled over into the next day or added uh onto the end of one's life. It is spent entirely in that 24-hour period. &gt;&gt; Some people spend their time attaining wealth or fame, and many seek pleasure or fulfillment in other activities. And there are those who spend much time cultivating closer, deeper relationships with family and friends. And most of us spend a good deal of our allotted time in discharging our responsibilities and just dealing with daily life. And still others waste the precious time they have that they've been given and wonder how and why their lives have passed them by. There's volumes that have been written about time management and even spiritual time management. You have been sent here for a season and for a specific purpose. I'm going to turn your thoughts with God's help and I want to be able to bring you to the point is when the spirit of God moves or God speaks that is a instant that's given to you and when it's gone you cannot bring it back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandaman speaking and when the angel of the Lord is right there, imagine the angel of the Lord, the pillar of fire, whatever you want to call him, right there at the platform manifesting himself and directly speaking to an individual in the congregation. And that God has not changed. &gt;&gt; He's exactly the same. I'm not him and you are not those people. But this God that I speak of is exactly the same God. He cannot change. He has not diminished in any one of his attributes. He's got as much mercy, as much power, as much supernatural here today as he has at any time. And whether he does something or doesn't do something, that's up to him. &gt;&gt; But one thing is absolutely critical is if the spirit of God or the voice of God is heard to you. I want to announce to you, you won't hear it the same in about two or three hours &gt;&gt; because it is right at that moment. And even brother Brand speaking to an individual and he says, "Oh God, she's going to miss it. &gt;&gt; What is she missing?" She's missing that instant &gt;&gt; in time that God has given to an individual and God knew it was going to happen. knew that person was going to be there, but they're whe whether they're so consumed with their condition or their circumstances or whatever it might be. And I want to say to this congregation, all that will ever hear this service and all who are streaming even now, don't miss your moment. &gt;&gt; Seize your moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the message countdown, he said if everything if everything serves God's purpose, it's got a resurrection. But if if only if but it can only rise if it serves God's purpose. &gt;&gt; But you can't keep anything in the ground that serves God's purpose that comes forth to testify of a resurrection. Why do we bring a resurrection in? Because resurrection is a continuation. &gt;&gt; Amen. this life in even even sin itself. He called that just a hickey. That's just a drop down in the cycle of perfection. &gt;&gt; In remembering the Lord, he said, "And if a man serves God's purpose, if we here serve God's purpose, there is a resurrection just as sure as anything. &gt;&gt; Only thing you have to do is God's just waiting on time, &gt;&gt; just like he is now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You think you're sitting in a Sunday morning service, but I have news for you. We happen to be sitting in a season of God's manifesting of himself. &gt;&gt; And we either will catch it or miss it. &gt;&gt; One or the two. &gt;&gt; In the message paradox, he said, "I believe in paradoxes. I believe in them with all of my heart." We said it's it's a paradox when all the smart men there was in the world and God put the key to the kingdom in the hands of one that was considered the ignorant and the unlearned and God put the hands uh put the key in the hands of those that were unlearned and ignorant put the key of the kingdom of God in their hands &gt;&gt; and bypassed the wise and the intelligent. He said, "And what's the most important thing in the world?" Here he's asking, and I would like, if brother Brandon was standing here asking you, I'm only echoing his voice. What is the most important thing in the world? &gt;&gt; The world you live in, the world you've been educated for, the skills you've learned, the the schooling you've had, the education you've received, everything that you have experienced, and the experience that you have gained. But what is the most important thing in the world? He said, "Is God's church?" &gt;&gt; That was a weak amen. &gt;&gt; For a question and an answer that the prophet has given to his own question. It's is God's church. God made the earth. &gt;&gt; That's pretty allencompassing, isn't it? God made the earth. He made it for a purpose &gt;&gt; to take a church out of it, &gt;&gt; a bride. And that's the most important important job in the world. &gt;&gt; So I don't care what it is that we're doing or what status we have in life or how humble or how high or whatever more. The most important thing in the world is the church. &gt;&gt; Number two, God made the earth. That's a pretty big statement, isn't it? He made the earth for the purpose of bringing out a church or a bride. And that's the most important job in the world. I'm giving these brief statements here not to preach a service to say things that may be uh that may anchor in somebody's heart &gt;&gt; and that will change the direction of your life &gt;&gt; that you'll go out of this service and say that's different. I've got to look at life different. I have to look at myself different. &gt;&gt; I have to look at the time that I've been given. &gt;&gt; Teach me, oh God, to number my days. The Bible has a great deal to say about our days spent here upon the earth and how they are spent and how they end. And God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him. He said, "God has put us here on the earth for a reason." &gt;&gt; So I announce to you, I feel that I am announcing, making some announcements. God has placed you. You, every one of you on the earth. God placed you here. &gt;&gt; Your mother and father didn't place you here. God placed you here. &gt;&gt; We just dedicated a little boy. God placed him here. &gt;&gt; He only used the parents to bring him. &gt;&gt; God sent you here. I need to make that. I need to emphasize that. You you you may have a family name, but God sent you here. &gt;&gt; You may have come from a certain background, a certain ethnic group, but God sent you here &gt;&gt; in this season &gt;&gt; at this time to use the number of days that he has allotted to you. And they have been allotted. And I read where the prophet said, "If a person is sick, God, the doctor may give you some medicine. And he may give you some uh uh antibiotics. He may give you something he said which is actually some poison into your system to kill the the germs and not too much otherwise it would kill you. Said that just to kill the germs and through that your life may be extended. But he made the announcement. He said he he said if if if your time is up there isn't amount any amount of medicine that will keep you here. And he said, "And if your time is not up, there's nothing in the world that can take you out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. God sent you here." &gt;&gt; This might be a simple message, friends, but it's going to be a mind shaker. God sent you here. &gt;&gt; And this isn't something that you just need to be enthused about now. It's something you need to go out these doors. You need to you need to mark it down in your calendar. Put it down in your book. Write it and inscribe it in the heart of your mind by the Holy Spirit. God sent me. &gt;&gt; Every day you need to rise saying God sent me here. &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with my mother, father, my heritage, my background. God sent me here and he gave me my parents to perhaps uh in his great mind that I would have certain characteristics and certain abilities and certain something and I made a certain way. God made me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even Peter and the apostles, brother Brown talks about James the prayer warrior. And Peter is as as rambunctious as Peter was. And you know, he was the one to step out of the boat and he was the one who drew his sword and he's going to kill this high uh high priest, the servant of the high priest. He's going to cut and he cut off his ear. He was going to do these things that God never took that out of him. &gt;&gt; He wanted that in him. All he did was index it around till it came under the control of the Holy Ghost and said under the control of Peter. And when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, it was Peter that stood up cuz he still had to have that nature. Hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Cuz he had been given the keys to the kingdom. He needed that nature. God gave you a certain nature. You might be more of a quiet person. He God gave it to you that way. And don't try. That's why brother Brandham says, "Don't try to be somebody else. Just be who you are. But surrender it all to God and God will use it for his kingdom. Someone else might preach the gospel all of the years. You might just be a quiet, quiet one on the sidelines say, "Nobody knows me. Nobody sees me." Whatever more. You may win one soul to Christ. &gt;&gt; If you live for Christ, you will be a testimony and win one soul for Christ. He doesn't say that that the servant of the Lord must be successful. Says he must be faithful. &gt;&gt; We must be faithful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has put us here on the earth for a reason. And that reason that he has put us here for, we are responsible to him for that reason. You're not responsible to the church. You're not responsible to me. You're not responsible to anybody. You're responsible to God for that reason. And if God put you here to be to be an example to someone else, then you're responsible to them. &gt;&gt; If God as parents has given you children, you're responsible to the children. You brought them into the world. Now you have a responsibility to them to live a certain kind of life to teach them in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He says, "And then if our life is on the earth here, then we should go to the one who put us here." Now, this is where I feel that many in this congregation, that's what we need to do. What I'm going to read now, then we need to go to the one who put us here. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've gone to your parents or you've gone to somebody you admired and said, "What do you think I ought to do?" God is saying you need to go to the one who put you here. And after this service, you know, God put you here. We need to go to God and and who put us here. And Lord, what would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; It may not be just at the way circumstances fall that that's what you do. Say, "Well, I do this because of this, this, this." You know, God doesn't say, "Well, I will create the circumstances and then you will, you know, go according to the circumstances." No, we go to him and we ask him, "What would you have me to do? What must I do? Why am I here?" &gt;&gt; And if it's to be a housewife, there's many here that are. If it's to be a housewife, a dishwasher, if it's to be whatever, whatever God wants you to do, then you do that the very best that you know how to do it. No matter how little it is, you must do it. &gt;&gt; And that ought to resolve things for us. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, there's no big eyes or small U's in this economy. and to whom we would go. He said, "And if we could sat down and take an inventory and ask the question of why are we here, how come that we ever come to this earth and what brought us here and where is our eternal destination going to be?" &gt;&gt; I haven't just selected certain things, friends. I pondered these very, very deeply. This generation is mentally consumed and occupied because Satan has filled this earth with in Satan's Eden. He's filled it with everything and especially this fits us all time. Who's got too much time? No, we don't have enough time. The kids in school don't have enough time. Everybody's all in a in a great big fluster. And my wife has a favorite phrase. Says, "I haven't got time." I said, "We're retired. That's all we have is time." So, I wanted to do it, but I just don't have enough time. And that's gone all over the world, dear. So, of course, you've never said that. Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; I want to preach to real people today. &gt;&gt; We just don't have enough time. &gt;&gt; We're under time constraint and time dict. So I started asking what is time? And I was happy to find some scientists that actually started to agree. They said time's an illusion. &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as time. &gt;&gt; I said amen. That's going to be my doctrine. &gt;&gt; By the time I'm done preaching, you're going to know that I don't I believe there's no time &gt;&gt; and you're going to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope those 10 people are here when I'm done. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I say again, God created time as we know it for our purpose and for his own purpose rather to deal with sin and destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you scripture now. &gt;&gt; To destroy and to destroy him that had the power of death. Hebrews 2:14. You can write it down, but just listen while I read it to you, please. For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh. Now, children come into the family at a certain season, at a certain time. And he says, the children are partakers of flesh and blood. He also himself likewise took part of the same. He had to come and at a certain time he was born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And took part of flesh and blood that through death he might destroy him &gt;&gt; who had the power of death. &gt;&gt; So this is not the destroying of bad things. This is destroying of the author of bad things. &gt;&gt; God created time. The prophet said it. The Bible tells it. We'll come to it. God created time. Space time. Science can't figure it out. They say it must be an illusion. And you'll think about that in a few moments a lot deeper. But I say God created it. I was saying this in some messages even months perhaps some years ago and I couldn't quite support it but I was throwing it out to the people. I believe that God made time created time to destroy the devil &gt;&gt; and then then this scripture comes as such a such a quickening I was so quickened to it that he might destroy him &gt;&gt; who had the power of death. So if you destroy him who has the power of death, guess what? Death goes and he goes. &gt;&gt; And what is that? That's nothing less than the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested where it is or when it is. He's doomed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And by the same God and by the same creator, I and you and everyone who is given the faith to believe, we have eternal life. We've just dipped down into this hickey called a trial. &gt;&gt; We're just here for a little trial season. And he said it's the word. &gt;&gt; It's to prove his word is faithful and true. And God's going to put it in the devil's face one of these days. You thought you could get them. You could not get them. I ordained them. I predestinated them to eternal life. This hickey is going to end now. And you're going to your place and I am done with you now. You will never stand beside the throne in heaven again. I cast you to the earth and then I did my creation on the earth. It was the womb for my seed. &gt;&gt; And he he said and and God said and he created two great lights. &gt;&gt; God said let there be light. Why did he say that? So that one would control the day and one would control the night. Amen. &gt;&gt; And everything that we have here as humans, we have it. We have a scale to relate things to say, "Oh, that is 10 ft away by from by what measurement?" Oh, no, it's not 10. It's it's 3 m. Oh, you're going to go out and you're going to step in your car and you're going to drive down the road 50 kilometers an hour. By what scale? Well, by the speed of motion across the ground. The only thing so we weigh we weigh things in pounds and kilos etc. Everything is in a relationship. &gt;&gt; But time is is scaled. The scale for time is motion. &gt;&gt; So we say, well, he's going 60 kilometers or he's going 60 miles an hour down the road. That's 60. He's going a certain distance motion in one hour. And that hour relates directly to the sun and the movement of the earth. The movement of the earth in its rotation in relationship to the sun. That's how come we have an hour. &gt;&gt; This light will be for days and for time. So now we have a relationship &gt;&gt; and you're going to live a certain length of time. And God says, "Teach me to number my days." Listen folks, I'm giving some announcements today. You only have so many. &gt;&gt; And we can live just to grind our way through life. Say, "Well, I'm going to get an education." That's fine. And it doesn't matter whether you're a housewife, a dishwasher, a plumber, or a carpenter, or uh a scientist or a teacher or whatever more. You do it for an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; I'm here in a certain season to manifest that a God sent a certain word &gt;&gt; at this time to tell us that we're at a certain point in the word of God. &gt;&gt; I've been sent here to live out my portion of the word so that the world will know it's not just the end and bad things are happening and what's happening to this world. But a person lives in this world says, "You know what? I think he knows where he's going. &gt;&gt; I think his head is screwed on straight. Excuse my terminology. I think this guy has got it. He's got it together. &gt;&gt; Why is he saying that? Because believers are different. &gt;&gt; Believers are different. I held one slide back which was brother Harp with his siblings, his two brothers and his sister. I can tell you if I didn't know if I didn't know the man's name or I never met him, I could identify instantly the believer. &gt;&gt; Why? He's got it together. &gt;&gt; He knows who he is. &gt;&gt; He's got it. It's all over his face. It's all over his whole being. I don't even have to hear a word. I just look at him and say, "He knows where he's going." &gt;&gt; He's a different kind of a person. He's a different creature. He's got it together. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? In the falling apart of the world, you'll need to really try to stay with the structure. I labored very very much and for very very many hours and days to structure this so that I hope it will stay clear in your mind and I try not to interrupt myself too much. in the falling part of the world. He says, "The one who created the heaven and the earth expresses himself back through his creation." &gt;&gt; What he has, what he is in his program. &gt;&gt; God has a program. &gt;&gt; Friends, these are very deep statements. They're not mine. There are prophet statements who tapped into eternity all the time. &gt;&gt; The one who created the heaven and the earth. Don't let this sound so big. You mean the very the very air you're going to breathe is part of this creation. The grass you walk on, the water you drink, everything is part of this creation. And you are part of this creation. And you have to say as I am saying, why are we here? And why has God given us this span of time? And then what is time? &gt;&gt; And God has said in his word that we need to teach us to number our days. And he said further, we need to redeem the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in redeeming the time, it goes a little bit. I'd like to put this down. To redeem the time is to secure to redeem it is to secure the season for yourself. That's what the dagot says. Secure this season for yourself. &gt;&gt; So I'm living here 2012. So what? What's 2012? Doesn't exist. It's an illusion. Your own scientists say it's an illusion. Amen. &gt;&gt; In contempt for the faith, he said, "For if he was God's expression," speaking of Jesus Christ, he asked the people, "Do you believe that?" God was expressing his attitude towards his fallen creation through the Lord Jesus Christ. He expressed himself that way. And in the message, I am the resurrection. And then I'm going to just change direction for a moment. In the message, I am the I am the resurrection and the life. He says, "And God the great creator who's expressed himself through all of his creation." God the creator who has expressed himself through all of his creation. Hello folks. &gt;&gt; Are you part of his creation? &gt;&gt; Are you part of his creation? You say, "Well, Brother Ed, that's a foolish statement." No, it's not a foolish statement because we may put our hand up and say, "I'm a part of his creation." And walk out these doors and live like we're disconnected from it. &gt;&gt; I want to go on from there. If you really believe you're part of his creation, then you were sent here by him for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we need to ask ourselves, am I serving that purpose? &gt;&gt; Am I working? What am I working for? What am I living for? What am I doing? Am I just seeking to make life easier here? Are we just getting things better here? Or am I just going on day after day after day? Or am I living here to be a to be uh do I have a divine purpose and a divine direction in this life? And hey, it doesn't it doesn't have to be some great big achievement. It's not that. You just live every day. &gt;&gt; And somebody who's standing beside you knows, &gt;&gt; uh we we sat on the plane. There's a couple in front of us. And I said to my wife after we just getting ready to land in Bellingham, I said, "There's a nice couple." I said, "I've been watching them. I've been watching her because just foot in front of me. I said, "They're nice." You know, I I like them. They look like a real good solid couple. And uh I said, you know, she's got her hair drawn back and a big bread up here and so on. I don't know. They might be here. We told them where we were. And uh and I said, "They're nice couple." When we got off the plane, we were the kind of the last one just at the baggage, not the baggage counter, but where they give you the bags off the plane was small, so they take your carry-on. So, we're there at the carry-on cart. And uh so I said, "Well, are you folks home?" And he said, "Well, well, she is. I'm not." Oh. I said, "Well, well," she says, "Yeah." She says, "I I live here, but he he works up in Alaska." Oh my goodness. So we had a little conversation, you know, just real real quick. And so I said, 'Well, then you live in Bellingham. No, he says, 'I live in Lynon.' I said, ' Okay.' And uh I says, 'Well, my wife, I said, she's she's half Canadian, half American. And he says, well, yeah, my wife, she was uh she wasn't born here either. I says, "Oh, I slapped him on the shoulder. I said, 'What do you have to do? Come up to Canada, get a wife?" "No, no, no." She says, "I'm not Canadian. And I'm said, I was born in Switzerland and but my parents were missionaries and we lived in South Africa. Oh. I said, 'Well, isn't that interesting? I said, I'm a pastor. Oh, they said, what what church? And I said, Cloverdale Bible Way. And they said, what's the name? Cloverdale Bible Way. And uh I said, we're we're just up in in Canada. And uh so a moment or two later, you know, just a couple moments later, his wife was from Lyndon. So he and he was interested. I so we got talking about Sitka, Alaska, where he is and why he's up there and he's electrician. And so we're just having, you know, a little conversation. So he said, "Where's your church?" And she said, "It's in Siri." So we knew right away they'd heard about us. They're a nice couple. Real nice couple. So, they've been they've been affected by the gospel. I can tell they've been affected by the gospel. At whatever degree you you receive it, I I believe it's fine. But believers of this message have been affected, &gt;&gt; by another power, &gt;&gt; by another spirit. &gt;&gt; You can't hide it. &gt;&gt; It's just evident. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People know it right away. And I say, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you have been brought here for this season. And we are in the season of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a privilege. &gt;&gt; We are in a season of the redemption, the conclusion of redemption. We're here to see the windup. &gt;&gt; Give me another few minutes, would you? &gt;&gt; Okay. creation as of time as we know it. And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years." In the 16th verse, and God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night, and he made the stars also. And so because of that, we have hours and weeks and days and months and years, but don't mean a thing. &gt;&gt; Only for us while we're here. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So everything is in relationship to that. And we have a scale that we can relate the events to. Events that God brings into being. We say, "Well, that happened 13 years ago or as brother Hugh Messi says, 51 years ago today. We were united in marriage." Well, that's all in relationship. You say, "Well, why is that important?" It's very important, friends. Very important. Because I am convinced And you don't want to be one of the ones I'm speaking about now. There are many who have been touched by the message, who've heard of the message, who have read what God himself did &gt;&gt; through a prophet &gt;&gt; to the people. And you are also witnesses &gt;&gt; of what God has done in this season. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there are multitudes. And as I travel, I see that it's like a a wave that can consume the people to such a degree that they lose sight. &gt;&gt; They lose sight of what their purpose is &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; Why am I here? And they lose sight. And the spirit of God comes in. I was listening. Do you have a little time? Amen. &gt;&gt; I listened to a service and I can give it to you now. I listened to a service years ago and the air was so tight and the service was so tight I could do nothing but have just compassion and oh it's one of those service you don't hardly want to sit in. And brother Brandham just hewed to the line and came down and oh my and you can see that there's no response to the people and and and then and then he starts and he does something very unusual. He doesn't usually have a long altar call but he starts calling for people to come. Is there someone and he spoke on influence? And he he said, "Is there someone that would need Christ if you need Jesus Christ?" And they're thinking, "When the coal of fire touch the prophet, making him as clean could be." Is there someone is someone want to give their heart to Christ? you're here without Christ and you know you should be saved. And he went on and plead no one. He said, 'Well, if everyone must be saved. Is there anyone that's a backslider? Are is anyone here a backslider? He carries on. No, you just come forward and we'll pray for you. There's nobody. Carries on. They're singing and playing. says, "Is there anyone here that needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Would you like to come down to the front? Anyone needing the baptism?" No one comes. No one comes. No one comes. Finally, one man comes. Said, "God bless this humble brother. May he be another Isaiah." and he's down to the front and then he says something along this order now. He said, "You've done the most horriblest thing that you could have ever done in your life." That was that moment. &gt;&gt; They did not recognize that voice. And then God through his servant begins to call out calls out a man. Nobody up before him on the platform calls out a man. And he said, "You, sir." And he begins to reveal the secret of his heart. He said, "And your name is Mr. Blackwood, and this is what's wrong with you." And then another person and another woman and he called tells Mr. Blackwood where he lives. And then this woman and another woman by name and another woman by name and another woman by name calls out four of them by name. and then others just what what what they're what what what is they're there for and what and the secret of their heart to begin unveiling one after the other after the other across that audience. Now, who wants the Holy Ghost and they flooded down and packed the altar and packed the sides of the building and the aisles and he says this and you'll find it. He said, "I did this to show you that I spoke the truth, &gt;&gt; they wouldn't come to the truth, &gt;&gt; but they would come because they people have been called out. So, they came as a result of the gift." &gt;&gt; And you know what he fed end up saying? I did this to show you you've been deceived. Right. &gt;&gt; And the deception was that they would come to something that emotionally pulled them &gt;&gt; but would not come to the preaching of the word &gt;&gt; and they missed their moment. &gt;&gt; When the word is preached &gt;&gt; and something is tingling down inside, seize the moment [Applause] cuz it's not going to happen tomorrow. It's not going to happen in the shopping mall. It's not going to happen at school. It's not going to happen on the job site. You want to seize the moment. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "God, help me seize the moment." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, God's spirit speaking to me." Reach out. &gt;&gt; Seize that moment. It's not my moment. It's your moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're the one that changes the service. &gt;&gt; You're the one that turns it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, we've been called under. We want to seize the moment. When we talk about this message, we're not talking about some little idol thing. We're talking about the greatest thing that God did &gt;&gt; during civilization &gt;&gt; of humanity. It's hard for us to recognize. may be hard for us to identify or hard for us to confess. We are living in the greatest manifestation that God ever did upon the earth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And we ought to rise to it &gt;&gt; and say, "What a moment &gt;&gt; that God has called me to be here. &gt;&gt; What an hour. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. &gt;&gt; What an honor. Oh father, &gt;&gt; you who sent me here &gt;&gt; for a divine purpose, &gt;&gt; I will not waste idly the time you have given. &gt;&gt; I will not waste the energy that you have put into this body. &gt;&gt; I will use it for your glory. &gt;&gt; Whether I'm a housewife or a worker or a student or whatever I am, you can live for Christ. &gt;&gt; Live such a testimony. I've said quite a bit about science and I don't want to take up too much more time, but scientists have much to say about time. The the Bible has much to say about it and brother Brandham said much about it as well. And they have said there's many questions about the nature of time and what is time and what causes time. So they say time is an emergent concept and there there is an underlying process of motion and forces from which time emerges and what we perceive of time is mostly an illusion. Now listen closely. Number one, our memory creates the illusion of the past. That's as science has described it. We all have a past. Conscious perception of events gives us the feeling of the present. And the future is a metal construct, something we construct, patterned on our memory experience of the of the past. It's our future. You know what science was missing? Jesus Christ. the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; Past, &gt;&gt; present &gt;&gt; to science, it's an illusion. &gt;&gt; But if you have Jesus Christ in your past, &gt;&gt; that's as real as it is now. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have Jesus Christ and today they have said that the past is a series of you know things that are in our memory and the future is in our anticipation. And all listen to me closely. All you actually have is called an infatismal. Scientists have called it infatismal. Now &gt;&gt; you have this moment. &gt;&gt; Say, well, you know, I don't feel I don't feel like reaching out. I don't feel really moved. You don't need to feel it. You just need to sit down and think about it real deep. My greatest decisions don't come in a moment of excitement. &gt;&gt; I sit at home or I go away and I ponder. What's life all about? What's this ministry all about? And I know I'm going to see him. And I even tell you some of my private prayers while I was away. Lord, when my time comes, receive me in peace. &gt;&gt; I know what's going to happen. And I know I'm not going to go to as believers, we're not going to go and die as a dog and be buried in some grave. I began to let my life and my my whole mind go over my life. Then you begin to thank God. I thank God. And you know what I respond? I don't I don't rejoice over the times that I ignored his voice. &gt;&gt; I grieve over that. &gt;&gt; But I rejoice over the times I obeyed his voice &gt;&gt; because what I did at that time and what you're doing and what we do here in this church and what we want to continue to do and and I'm giving you everything that's in my heart as my last service. sees the moment &gt;&gt; cuz it's the only time you have &gt;&gt; you do not have to be filled with some excitement or enthusiasm. All you have to do is sit and quietly think this is my time. I will not let it bypass. I am going to stand and I'm going to dedicate all that I am because the enthusiasm may leave you and it will leave you in the next few moments. But when you say, "I am done. I'm done with my waste." Or, "I am done with the the casual attitude that I've had. I'm finished." &gt;&gt; Satan is trying to rob me of my reward. &gt;&gt; And I am now rising against it. &gt;&gt; And I changed my course by God's grace. &gt;&gt; And I am finished with the enemy. I'm finished with this waste &gt;&gt; of my energy. &gt;&gt; I have been called as a son and daughter of the creator of heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; And he has sent me here with a divine purpose and by his grace I shall fill this race. &gt;&gt; Seize the moment. I'm not talking about another moment. I'm not talking about after church. I'm talking about this moment. &gt;&gt; Say, I sense the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; I sense the voice of God talking to me. Seize the moment. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't let it bypass you. &gt;&gt; Say, well, enter. He say, how do I seize the moment? Enter into it. Oh, God, don't let this bypass me now. I'm here to receive it. I'm here. Whatever I need to do. Whatever I need to do, oh God. But keep speaking. Speak on. [Music] &gt;&gt; Some of you been struggling. You're struggling with the world or struggling with the enemy, struggling with Satan. You need to change that now. &gt;&gt; Seize a moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; See some of you young people. I remember going to church when I was younger than you fellas and I used to sing a song as a little boy and they'd have me stand up and sing in church or in a meeting. Oh, there's honey in the rock, my brother. There's honey in the rock for you. Leave your sins for the blood to cover. There's honey in the rock for you. How old were you, brother Ed? I was about four and a half. And I sang it then and I can still sing it today &gt;&gt; because it's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; And I found there was honey in a rock as a boy. And that's why Eugene, your words meant something to me because I was studying this subject. I looked to my grandfather when I was a lad, when I was just a boy, and I said, "Thank God." He didn't know anything about the message, but he seized the hour. He seized the moment. Even under the communism and under the persecution, there was men who stood &gt;&gt; and would not be moved for God. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This this world that you're living in, you're going to go to your home. This world you're living in, this Bible says, shall wax worse &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Worse. &gt;&gt; And what? Worse. &gt;&gt; Do you kids hear that? And worse. &gt;&gt; Not better or worse. Not because I'm saying it. That's what this says it. &gt;&gt; He who created all things, he knows what the future's going to be. It's going to get worse and worse. &gt;&gt; I want to show you this next. Here's a diagram. Can we turn the lights down just a wee bit? Here's a diagram that scientists, a leading scientist by the name of McTagert. They proposed that the passage of time is is an illusion suggesting that only the present is real. You say, "Well, tomorrow I'm going to do this or tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow." You don't have any tomorrow. You don't know about tomorrow. You can only anticipate tomorrow. I'm going to do this. And then you project that because you you pulling from your memory. That's how you do it. Tomorrow I'm going to get in my car tomorrow. You only know that because you got in your car before, but it's an illusion. you anticipate it and we don't we don't want to take anybody's expectations away but this is what science has said that the past here we have the past and here we have the future but here this little moment this little red arrow right up the middle that's you in church Today you have this moment. This is the only moment that's actually real. And what's last week in the last service in the last camp and that's why things at camp and special meetings and everything because people sit and they kind of you know the way it was back there and you kind of draw that back. Sorry folks that was that moment. &gt;&gt; This is another one. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can dream all you want and you can think and you can anticipate and you can try and you know to have that once again I'm sorry that's is gone &gt;&gt; and as as time goes on as we know it as as this motion of life continues that goes further into the past &gt;&gt; and the present and the and and the and the present you're living at just now but the future this afternoon is is moving up to us and this will go further into the past. &gt;&gt; Now, in God's economy, if we do what we're supposed to do at this moment, and if we have a future, if we have tonight, and we have the communion, and we have the Lord's table, that can even be that much more blessed because we say, "Oh, I'm going to seize this moment. &gt;&gt; I got this moment. I can wash our sister's feet. I got this moment. I can wash this brother's feet. I got this moment that God has given me to to be even as Jesus as Jesus has said, uh, if you do these things, happy are you? Oh, and I have this moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody here may say, well, my preacher, my minister or someone on the internet, my preacher, our church doesn't do that. We're not interested what anybody's church does. We're not interested what anybody that's why we're not interested in what anybody thinks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, now you'll maybe realize why I spoke certain services." I hinge everything on that vindication. &gt;&gt; And here we have in the in in the message influence in Tulair. Tulair, California is that service. And if you want to read it and it comes to the end, you want to hear it even better. Hear it. And it comes to the end of the service. And then and and can you imagine? Can you imagine where this generation has gone? Elijah and Jesus Christ, the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; standing in front of those people &gt;&gt; and can't move them. And they came two 300 100 150 200 came and packed the altar. What did they get, brother Ed? I don't know. I I'm not too sure what they got. They should have seized the moment. &gt;&gt; They should have been able to say earlier, never a man's fake like this man. But there's women there who cut their hair and they resisted it cuz they cut. Can you imagine making hair that important &gt;&gt; and letting that stand in the way? &gt;&gt; Friends, are you with me? Am I &gt;&gt; We have this moment They've said just as a matter of explanation, I'm going to finish in just a couple few minutes. Now, they've likened the future to or the the past to recorded messages. We've already recorded it. I have a reason for saying this. It's already recorded and we got it on a recording someplace. And the future's like a blank tape or blank CD. And we're going to put that in infotismal needle there on the CD to catch the moment and record it and it goes into the past cuz now we've recorded it's gone back your life. There's a needle in your life &gt;&gt; and you are recording. And Jesus Christ whose yesterday, today, and forever has said that our lives are recorded in heaven. &gt;&gt; Everything's recorded. Oh my friends, I could start now and start preaching. How wonderful it was that we have a a playing head that recorded everything, but we also have a a perfect delete button. &gt;&gt; We have a perfect redemption &gt;&gt; because the purpose the purpose of our lives here. Please get it. I'm this as deep as I can get with my my thoughts to you. But the purpose of the purpose of all these events from the beginning to the very end is a series and God put lights in the heavens light for the sun. So we have hours, days, weeks, years, etc., etc. But God keeps it by this is the era, season of this manifestation. Then there's another one. And during this time, he raises up people that can manifest what he has determined shall be manifested in that season. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm telling you friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in opposition to every demon power that would be opposed, Satan hates the expression of Jesus Christ. He hates to see his enemy expressed in his power. &gt;&gt; And God set you here so that you could demonstrate it. &gt;&gt; Don't live like some weak need so-called Christian. We're more than that. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; We're not here to wallow around in Leodysia. We're here to say, "My vision is clear. My call is clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My dedication is clear. &gt;&gt; I've given myself entirely to this word. &gt;&gt; I'm not Elijah. I'm not a prophet or a son of a prophet. But I have a prophet's message. &gt;&gt; And you have the same message. You can live it as you can live it as God has called you to live it. And you shall do so because God will not be God's program will not be foiled. It will not be distracted. It will not be derailed. He's going to achieve his purpose. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends what's deepened my soul. We're not called here just to go to church on Sunday or just to go to church on Wednesday. We're called here to live this life in such a way I'm going to going to just finish with this. There's a man in the Bible. I think brother John Andy's has mentioned him. I'm not too sure. Somebody has. Maybe brother Tom Shamgar he's there's only one little scripture of him can I take this moment have your attention there's just one scripture of him doesn't say much about him but it says this and after him was Shamgar the son of Anith who slew the Philistines 600 men with an ox go an ox cross goat as a stick and he delivered he also delivered Israel. That's the verse about him. Brother Brandham he says the Philistines were coming and stealing their grain and leaving the children of Israel povertystricken. And Shamgar was a judge, but he was just an ordinary man. He says, "And here Shamgar," he says, "Let's see him now. He's probably standing in his barn." And, uh, he says, uh, he's had a pretty good crop this year. And the and the grain is the grainery is full in the barn. And he's happy. He's thanking God for the crop they had. And he hears thump thump thump thump thump thump. And hear the clang of the of the shields. Thump thump. 600 men coming or maybe more. And he's got a little family says little ragged kids around him. He's thinking, "Here they come again. Here they come. But he says he didn't have time to go and learn how. &gt;&gt; He says it almost every time. He didn't have time to go and get practiced up. &gt;&gt; He didn't have time to learn how to be a warrior. &gt;&gt; Some of you say, "Well, I I some of you younger people might say, "Well, when I get a little older, when I when I'm finished this, when I'm finished that, there are there are times in God's economy there isn't time Right. &gt;&gt; Says he didn't have time. He looked around and here they're coming and he looked around and all there was was an ox gold. He says a a stick with a maybe a brass end on it and and they might use it to push the dirt out from between the discs or the implement in the field. And he took that. He didn't have time, but he says, "I'm a Jew. &gt;&gt; I'm circumcised. I'm one of God's children. &gt;&gt; He didn't he he didn't say I'm a king and I'm a preacher and I'm a prophet or I'm something else. He's like one of you. &gt;&gt; That's who I am. &gt;&gt; I'm a mother. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; I'm a father. &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; I heard this message. We don't go down say, "Well, maybe I'm not where I ought to be." That's not that's not the point here. The enemy is coming. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, friend. The enemy comes to church. &gt;&gt; And he'd like you to miss this moment. &gt;&gt; And you got a little preacher up here saying, "Size a moment. I don't care how old you are. I don't care how young you are. Don't lose this minute. &gt;&gt; This is the only time you have. &gt;&gt; You don't have tomorrow. &gt;&gt; You certainly don't have yesterday. and you haven't got next Sunday's meeting. What do you have? You have this moment. This moment's being recorded. You might be called on say, "Well, I need to do something I never did before." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That'd be perfectly fine. Oh, God. I'm not going to let this moment go. &gt;&gt; You're speaking to me. You spoken in my heart. Things cannot continue as they have. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to say that? Things must not continue as they have. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. &gt;&gt; It's a Shamgar. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said he wanted to meet him. He what a bold little fellow. And he took that ox code and he just began to beat. He didn't know how. He only knew one thing. He knew who he was. I'm a Jew. I'm circumcised. He says, "I'm the the God of Abraham is my God. The God of Isaac is my God and I stand there." &gt;&gt; I say to this congregation, in the name of Jesus Christ, I don't intend to preach this message again here, but I say seize a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, Shamgar sees the moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say to every person here as a testimony and everyone on the internet that should hear this service, whatever your dilemma is, whatever you're faced with, &gt;&gt; God wants you to get your vision and your eyes off of it &gt;&gt; and get your eyes off of the problem and get your eyes onto the promise &gt;&gt; and you go out of here and say, "This is what God has said." &gt;&gt; Amen. And whether I live or die, this is what I will believe. &gt;&gt; And God has furthermore, he has sent and confirmed it over and over and over. And I say, Father, you did so much more than you needed to do. &gt;&gt; You did so much more. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they believe? I don't know. Why weren't they moved? Why didn't they seize the moment? &gt;&gt; This has the answer. This vindicated word has the answer. &gt;&gt; I say all glory to be the name of Jesus Christ. All hail King Jesus. All hail Emmanuel. Come brother Ryan and help me sing. Let's stand to our feet. And I don't care if you break from the ritual. I'm not interested in any ritual. I'm interested in I'm not interested even in closing this service the way we would always close it. There's a baptismal, isn't there, brother John and brother do brother Tom, maybe you and the people want to be baptized. What a moment. &gt;&gt; What a moment to seize those that are going to be baptized. What an atmosphere. Dear friends and believers, we have this moment and I think we ought to reach out. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've never raised your hand, but I think you ought to maybe raised your hand. At least listen to your heart and do what your heart is saying for you to do. Pray the kind of prayer your heart is saying. Hallelujah. Let it become a voice. Oh God, Father, I'm bringing this congregation before you. I'm bringing this service before you while we're here in this moment and we have this uh this little sliver of time to make this service, Lord, may it conclude the way you want it to conclude. May the individuals whose lives need to be touched, let them be touched. Oh God, I pray Father that you'll take control of the life of the service of the word of all the moments of this closing of the service and those that are going into the water to be baptized. Oh God, let your Holy Spirit fill them. Let them rise in a resurrection of newness of life in the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'd like to encourage you. Are you listening to your heart? What is the spirit of God saying to you? Would you like to say, "Yes, Lord." Lord, &gt;&gt; yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. [Music] They would change that. Speak my lord. When uh fire of touch the prophet. When the cool of fire touched the prophet making him as pure as pure can be. Then the voice of God said, "Go for us." Then he answered, "Here are my friend. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be equipped to answer thee. Sleep my Lord. See my Lord. Sing me and I will answer. Lord. &gt;&gt; Soon the time of reaping will be over. towards the harvest. May the Lord harvest smile upon us. May we hear his blessed child well done. How many want to hear that? &gt;&gt; Speak my lord. &gt;&gt; Speak my lord. Let us worship him now. Sweet man, I'll be answering. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord send me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing the chorus once more. [Music] And I sense that perhaps there are those that are saying, "Brother Ed, I'm just wondering how do I seize the moment? This is how." For every person that somewhere along in the service, you heard the voice of God speaking, maybe a still small voice speaking deep within. Then what you need to do, you just lift your hands and say, "Speak on, Lord. Speak on. Speak on. Don't don't cease. Don't stop. My heart is open. My ears are open. My soul is open. My heart is open. God, my mind is open. Speak on, Lord. Speak on. Speak on." Just lift your hands to him. And we'll sing it. We will sing it just quietly and prayerfully once again. Speak my Lord. speak my Lord and then you just let your voice, let your words, let your mouth be open. Don't be ashamed of him. Don't be ashamed of him. If that's him speaking to you, don't be ashamed. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. What is it that you'd have me to do? What would you have me to change? Oh, God. How many here? How many here will raise their hand and they sense that God has been speaking to them? I just have my hands up. I'm not looking around. Let let us sing it once again, brother Ryan, as a prayer. Now, everyone, speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll answer. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak and I will answer. [Music] &gt;&gt; With our hands still raised, our hearts open. Heavenly Father, I want to before this congregation of people, I want to thank you for having spoken to my own heart during the last days and the last few weeks, speaking in my own home, oh God, and I and my wife having opportunity to speak about the things that are so deep upon our hearts. I thank you, oh God, for every time you have moved in the past. But Lord Jesus, we're not living in the past. We're living in the now. I'm living in this very moment, oh God. And I just so desire or so hunger, Lord. I hunger for these people. I hunger that you will be such a reality to them. I pray, oh God, in the name, blessed name of my Lord Jesus Christ, I love thee, Lord. I love thee. I love you with all my soul. Oh God, may you be such a reality to these people. I pray, Father, let your presence fill her bosom, fill her heart, fill her life, fill her car, oh God, fill her home, Father, prevent it. Protect us against the spirit of this age. Protect us against the lukewarmness. Protect us against the world. Protect us, oh God. Let this congregation live as soldiers, true soldiers of the cross of Jesus Christ. I commit them to you. Thank you for their kind attention. In Jesus name. In Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. Sorry, brother Tom. &gt;&gt; I want to live away. He wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love [Music] till there's just no more. rise together. [Music] Amen. That song has a significance to the very reason why we're standing here because I believe a couple, brother Mike Hoffer, Sister Ela Hoffer, they're seizing their opportunity. &gt;&gt; This is their time. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to let it go by another week. They didn't want to go back to South Dakota. They knew that they had to be together in the baptism, in the waters of baptism, &gt;&gt; knowing that God has done a great work within brother Mike's heart. Sister Elaine just rededicating her life as a family. I say, "Let's just seize the opportunity." And that's why we're in the in the baptismal thing. I thought, "What a perfect message, Brother Mike. &gt;&gt; What a perfect message. &gt;&gt; They weren't going to let a Sunday go by. I want to be identified in his death, burial, and resurrection. &gt;&gt; I want to be baptized before I take communion. &gt;&gt; I need God within my home. &gt;&gt; Brother Mike, you said something that touched me very deeply. You said you want to live that kind of life that you heard that prophet speak. &gt;&gt; I want to live that kind of life that he heard the prophet speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; And my mind immediately went to invisible union. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says this, the anointed word of God being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of God with the predestinated germ in him for his hour. He'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in heaven. &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God, brother Mike. There is that germ within you &gt;&gt; at this particular season that God was going to interrupt your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said the real genuine eagles hear my sheep know my voice and a stranger they'll not follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram goes on to say, and this is the part that I love. You saw a being you wanted to be like, &gt;&gt; a deep calling to a deep. &gt;&gt; He said, "Those hundred-year-old messages didn't do nothing for me in the colony. &gt;&gt; But when I heard a prophet minister, that's the kind of life I want." &gt;&gt; That is a gene calling out to God, seeing a being he wanted to be like. And you say, "Well, how do I get to be like that being?" You repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Brother Mike. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you will be like that being by coming by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Sister Elaine, by your desire also of following in the word of God with your husband, rededicating your life to Jesus Christ. We will baptize you both in the name above all names. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, brother might the thing that you desired. Amen. Won't you just step forward here? Let's turn around this way. Would you like to say anything? Too nervous. &gt;&gt; Too nervous. All right. Our dear heavenly father, just sitting in a room just a few days ago and hearing brother Mike declaring Lord his love for you and how that you've turned his heart around that could only be the Holy Ghost himself speaking to a predestinated seed. I pray father as he has desired the very life of Jesus Christ that you will baptize him with the Holy Ghost and fire that Lord wherever you would lead his footsteps Lord that he would have the fire of God burning within his bones that he will testify that his life Lord will testify of the very presence of Jesus Christ the living word Lord we commit him into your divine care now in Jesus name and brother Tonight by your confession that Jesus Christ is your personal savior, I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. What a marvelous thing it is, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you would take a husband and wife together to walk down this path of life. Lord, &gt;&gt; and sister Elaine, Lord, has spoken, Lord, she has a love for you. Always has. But &gt;&gt; God, I just pray now that as she is being baptized this morning in water that you would baptize her with the fire of the Holy Ghost. Yes, &gt;&gt; truly indeed. I can baptize her with water, but there's one greater than I. Let the dove come down and let the spirit of God consume her. Let her life, Lord, &gt;&gt; be blessed with your presence live in her. I pray, Sister Elaine, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your personal savior. I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] talked about seizing the opportunity. We have one more. &gt;&gt; Flow through me. Glory. Holy Spirit. I to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my name. [Music] We have brother David Fzen here and he actually I actually had it wrote down here. Brother David, the next baptism, we will seize the opportunity. &gt;&gt; I thought that was remarkable. &gt;&gt; And when I walked into church this morning, I said, "There will be a baptismal service this morning. Let's just seize this opportunity." &gt;&gt; And brother David was baptized as a young boy. And you know, we just want to put the we want to put the devil on the run. &gt;&gt; And it's been plaguing him for years the way that he was baptized. And so he just said, "I need to put it to rest, brother Tom. I need to stand in the waters of baptism. I want to go on with God and I want to put the devil and doubt behind me. &gt;&gt; Well, here's our time. God bless brother David for his boldness to stand before the people of God and to be identified with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother David, you have a great desire to walk with God. Satan has plagued your mind these many years. But to put you at rest to know that there is a way that seems maybe right unto man. That's the way of death. But there is the right way, the correct way, God's way, the word way. And I know that's the way that you desire to walk. And so by your confession that Jesus Christ has been and is your personal savior, we baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; You might as well smile with me. The devil's defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, our God is victorious. Hallelujah. He's so wonderful. Amen. I'm going to appeal to uh everyone in the congregation. We've u we we sent out the faith challenge report and we've gotten a a number back. People that moved and have got and I know especially like all you young people that are there's probably a hundred. Brother John told me about a hundred at the service Friday night. And I know that you must know somebody. You might know one, you might know two people you've met uh someplace wherever, another young person. They probably in all likelihood did not get a Faith John's report. This report is so outstanding. I just got a email from Singapore. I got an email from a brother and in fact is he's going to be ministering here. There's no service Wednesday. He'll be ministering Friday and Sunday, both services. And that's brother Joseph Hammed from Murphy'sboro. And he told me when he just saw those things, he said sent me an email. He says, "I'm in awe, just in awe at what is taking place and the people there that are working with brother Ivan, Brother Murphy's back now, and Sister Tracy and and other young people. We have three three of them. Sister Mary and two more came and are in the school, international students. We're so thankful. God bless them. But uh but you young people, I don't want to get away off of my thought. If you would just come forward and say, I have two or three people. I can send one of those two and I will take them and I'll just send it myself. You know the address and you send them. You can get them at the office. And I I I'd be I'd feel very very bad if there wasn't at least 30, 40, 50 people that would want to get a couple and send it to people that you know in all likelihood have not received it. And they ought to hear it. They shouldn't they hear that people that sat right here or brother Ivan, sister Aeneth has gone back to be with them because he can't he just can't he's so burdened he just can't get home. And they are correcting and changing and making this Bible will be the most accurate Bible China has ever had in their history. and you have a chance to just send out the notice that this is what's happening before you send it. If you haven't read it from back back to front, front to back, get it and read it and then send it out to some people. And I'm I'm appealing to you now because we've sent it out and a bunch have been returned and so we have extras now. And I know that there are people that have not heard and they want to hear. They want to be a part of it. God bless you. Let's stand and let's just sing. Blessed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love. &gt;&gt; Do you feel that way? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And we'll see you this evening. Lord willing for four or five:00 and then we'll have the Lord's table. Greet hand greet. Shake hands with one another as we sing blessed be the tithe that binds. Our hearts in Christ love the fellowship of men is light to have above before our father's throne. [Music] We hold our heart and prayers. Our fears, our hope, our want, our comforts, and our prayers. God bless you. You sat down. I'm dismissing you in Jesus name. You're all dismissed. We'll see you this evening. God bless you. [Music]
