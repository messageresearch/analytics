[5:33] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[5:38] And oh
[5:40] preious is that glow
[5:44] that makes me white as snow.
[5:50] [Music]
[5:54] I know nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[5:59] for my pardon. And for my pardon, this I
[6:05] see through nothing but the blood of
[6:10] Jesus
[6:12] for my cleansing with my plea.
[6:17] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[6:23] And all precious is now
[6:28] that makes me white as

[7:43] Nothing

[8:16] makes me white as snow.
[8:21] There is no other found. I know nothing
[8:27] but the blood of Jesus.
[8:34] Hallelujah.
[8:35] That blood still atones for us today. It
[8:38] has never lost its power. Praise our
[8:40] God. Amen. Can we sing? There's a
[8:42] fountain open in the house of David.
[8:44] Amen. We're going to prepare to go to
[8:46] prayer at this time. We do have a couple
[8:48] testimonies that we want to remember.
[8:50] Before we do, brother Jason and Sister
[8:52] Sammy have written in that a couple
[8:54] weeks ago we prayed for our neighbor's
[8:55] daughter who fell out of a second story
[8:57] window. She was lifellighted to Seattle
[9:00] with a hole in her head. And after
[9:01] surgery and 46 stitches and many tests,
[9:04] the doctors couldn't even determine that
[9:06] she had a concussion. They said it was a
[9:07] miracle. Praise God. Amen. There's power
[9:10] in prayer. Praise the Lord.
[9:16] Amen.
[9:17] Also, our brother Nathan Hilderbrand
[9:19] just wants to express his thanks to the
[9:20] saints of God for all their prayers and
[9:22] support recently on behalf of Sister
[9:23] Deborah. We give thanks to God for his
[9:26] abundant grace and mercy reflected
[9:27] through his people. Sister Deborah is
[9:29] getting stronger every day. The prayer
[9:31] of faith shall save the sick and the
[9:32] Lord shall raise thee up. Amen. God
[9:34] bless you, brother Nathan. Continue to
[9:36] remember sister Deborah. And why don't
[9:38] we sing this? I'm gonna ask our brother
[9:39] Tim Dodd to come. Do have one request
[9:41] from our brother Sterling. Just to
[9:42] remember a couple men that he has been
[9:44] witnessing to and a Christian man named
[9:47] Brian. Both of who have received tracks
[9:49] about the message. Just asking that God
[9:51] will show mercy and open their eyes.
[9:53] Amen. To the truth of the hour.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love this song. There is a
[9:58] fountain open in the house of David to
[10:00] you who would believe. Are we believers
[10:02] this morning? Amen. And I trust that God
[10:04] will grant it to you according to your
[10:06] faith.
[10:08] There is a fountain
[10:12] that's open in the house
[10:18] of
[10:21] you
[10:24] will
[10:27] be.
[10:31] And there are streams
[10:35] of grace that's flowing down
[10:41] from Cal.
[10:44] [Music]
[10:51] &gt;&gt; There is a mountain.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; There is a mountain.
[10:57] And it's all in
[11:01] the house
[11:03] of David
[11:06] to you
[11:09] [Music]
[11:21] falling down
[11:24] from Calary.
[11:27] Just come
[11:30] now
[11:32] receive once more. There's a fountain
[11:35] open. There is a mountain
[11:40] [Music]
[11:46] of
[11:47] [Music]
[11:53] We
[11:56] are streaming
[12:00] the praise flowing
[12:04] [Music]
[12:06] from Cal.
[12:10] [Music]
[12:12] now and
[12:14] receive.
[12:17] Amen.
[12:24] And let's bow our heads together.
[12:27] If you're a believer this morning, if
[12:29] you're just a believer, the song said,
[12:32] "The fountain is open to those who
[12:34] believe." Amen.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just raise your hand as a
[12:37] sign? Lord, I'm a believer.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm coming to the fountain this
[12:42] morning.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[12:47] Lord, we're so thankful that there are
[12:49] streams of grace
[12:52] that have flowed from Calvary, oh God,
[12:56] that we might come and receive once
[12:58] again this morning. Lord,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; we might receive for ourselves, Lord.
[13:04] for our needs, for our burdens. Oh God,
[13:08] we might receive for our loved ones.
[13:10] Father, we might receive for those that
[13:15] have need of them this morning. Oh God,
[13:17] we truly are a needy people. But because
[13:20] you knew that we were needy, Lord, you
[13:23] said you're the God that meets all of
[13:25] our needs according to your riches and
[13:28] glory. You're the one that heals all of
[13:30] our sicknesses and diseases. We've heard
[13:34] the testimonies this morning, Father.
[13:36] How do you touch the little girl who
[13:38] fell from the window? Just an innocent
[13:41] child, Lord. And you came on the on the
[13:44] scene. A stream of grace flowed from
[13:46] Calvary for her, Lord. And she received
[13:50] as the saints lifted her up before you,
[13:52] oh God. We thank you for that, Lord. We
[13:55] thank you for so many answers to prayer.
[13:58] We thank you for your moving in the
[13:59] Hildebrand home. We thank you, Father,
[14:02] for your moving yesterday in the wedding
[14:04] and amongst us, Lord. And so many things
[14:08] you've done, Lord, in the midst of your
[14:09] people. We give praise to the name of
[14:13] Jesus Christ. That name above every
[14:16] name.
[14:17] And
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Father, we remember those that are away
[14:20] from us. Brother Tom and the needs that
[14:22] are there in Africa, Lord. Brother
[14:24] Michael's with him, Lord. Others are
[14:27] away on for different reasons. Some
[14:29] might be on vacation traveling. Others
[14:32] might be working in different areas. We
[14:34] remember them, Lord. Lord, we don't like
[14:37] to be away from our families, our loved
[14:39] ones, but sometimes it's required of us.
[14:41] Father, remember them, Lord, we pray.
[14:44] Give them each one safe journeys home.
[14:47] And Lord, we remember the service this
[14:50] morning.
[14:51] Father, we're here in your midst.
[14:55] You're the same yesterday, today, and
[14:56] forever.
[14:59] You have not left your children, Lord.
[15:02] Lord, you are right here because two or
[15:04] three are gathered in your name. We have
[15:06] come with expectation, Lord. We have
[15:09] come with desires in our hearts.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; We have come, Father, not to look at
[15:14] someone sitting next to us, but we've
[15:16] come to meet with you, Lord.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, come and meet with us. We invite
[15:20] you speak through brother Bisco once
[15:23] again, Lord.
[15:25] Lord, we we do not count those things in
[15:27] the past
[15:29] as being sufficient. Lord, we want more
[15:31] this morning.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; We want to be drawn closer to you. We
[15:35] want you to wash us in the water of the
[15:37] word this morning. Cleanse us with that
[15:41] fountain that flows from on high. Lord,
[15:44] be with the remainder of the service as
[15:46] we even take up an offering. Father,
[15:50] money is not something that is of big
[15:54] consequence to you, Lord, but it is a
[15:56] form of our worship that we might take
[15:59] of the substance that you blessed us
[16:01] with and give it unto you. Lord, we
[16:05] pray, Lord, that you will bless it. And
[16:07] Lord, that you will multiply it to the
[16:09] need that you have of it. Lord, we
[16:12] realize, Father, it will never express
[16:14] how much we appreciate you. But Lord, we
[16:17] give it willfully and cheerfully unto
[16:20] you, Father, as we commit this service
[16:23] into your hands in the name of our Lord
[16:25] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats as we take
[16:34] up the morning offering.
[16:37] Amen. What do we sing? Isn't he
[16:38] wonderful? Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my
[16:41] Lord wonderful?
[16:43] Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[16:49] Wonderful.

[18:16] times. Maybe Sister Sharon, Sister

[18:19] come get ready for your special as we
[18:20] sing it a couple more times. Isn't he

[19:12] porn in God's word. Isn't Jesus my love?
[19:19] So wonderful.
[20:05] I was in an endless cycle of life. I did
[20:10] not know what to do.
[20:15] Every time I would try to change my
[20:19] ways, I would fall right back again.
[20:25] Then I came to a point where I had to
[20:29] say that that's it.
[20:32] I'm through.
[20:34] Lord, to you all my life I willingly
[20:39] give. I'm ready.
[20:42] [Music]
[20:44] I'll lay down my life. I'll carry my
[20:48] cross. And I'll live for you. No matter

[21:32] [Applause]
[21:33] Maybe you are confused and scared in
[21:37] your heart and you don't know what comes
[21:41] next.
[21:43] Well, it's your turn to realize
[21:47] you can live this life
[21:51] alone.
[21:53] So just give everything completely to
[21:57] him. Don't you worry. Just be still and
[22:02] lay down your life and carry your cross
[22:07] and live for Christ no matter the cost.
[22:12] He'll take you through fire to come
[22:15] forth his goal. Surrender it all. He'll
[22:20] take control
[22:22] as you start over.
[22:26] As you start over.
[22:31] As you start over.
[22:36] As you start over.

[22:51] [Music]
[22:52] I don't have much, but take my life.
[22:57] It's the best that I can give to you.

[24:29] a heavy burden. Once shackled
[24:33] by a heavy
[24:36] burden.
[24:39] Oh beneath the load of guilt
[24:44] and shame.

[25:01] the same.
[25:04] For he touched me.

[25:27] and now I know
[25:32] he touched me
[25:36] and made
[25:38] me whole. Since I met. Oh, and since I
[25:44] met his blessing.
[25:51] And since he cleans
[25:55] me, oh Lord.

[27:57] and made
[28:00] me whole.
[28:03] Hallelujah.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to turn the service
[28:06] to our pastor. I did forget one
[28:07] announcement. I'm sorry for my brother
[28:09] Richard. Uh due to the fact that we
[28:11] still need two Sunday school teachers to
[28:13] step forward, Sunday school will be
[28:15] delayed in starting this year until
[28:17] further notice. So, if you felt it on
[28:19] your heart at all, maybe you should pray
[28:20] about a little bit. Sunday school might
[28:22] be waiting on you. And maybe we just
[28:24] need a couple more teachers and just see
[28:25] our brother Richard about that. And
[28:27] let's sing that chorus once more as we
[28:28] turn the service to our pastor.
[28:31] He touched me.
[28:34] Oh,
[28:36] he touched me.
[28:41] And oh
[28:43] the joy that floods my soul.
[28:49] I know something
[28:52] has happened.
[28:55] And now I know
[29:00] he touched me
[29:03] and made
[29:05] me whole.
[29:09] [Music]
[29:12] God bless you.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Wonderful day.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:18] Amen. We had a mighty wind yesterday,
[29:20] but we desire a mighty wind today.
[29:24] And a mighty wind that came in on the
[29:26] day of Pentecost. I'm I've just got a
[29:29] few comments to make before we will turn
[29:31] to the word and then uh we'll remain and
[29:34] I would like to sing that song. Open
[29:36] mine eyes that I may see.
[29:39] Uh
[29:40] we we're happy to have brother Milco
[29:43] back from Serbia and uh I had an email
[29:47] from brother Craig Bur. Uh he we
[29:51] actually have pictures but I won't take
[29:53] time this morning because I just have
[29:55] too many things to speak about uh that
[29:59] brother Milco brought back from Serbia.
[30:02] But uh I just thought I I just want to
[30:07] say a word about what brother Craig Bur
[30:09] had said. Uh
[30:13] he said, "I just wanted to touch base
[30:15] with you and let you know that I've
[30:17] returned home and I'm now with my church
[30:19] and family again. I want to say a very
[30:23] uh heartfelt thank you for sending
[30:25] brother Milco to assist us on our trip.
[30:27] He was so valuable to us in so many
[30:30] ways. He took very good care of us and I
[30:33] must say that I learned so many things
[30:35] from him. He shared many experiences
[30:38] with us that I found very enlightening.
[30:41] And then he went on to say further, I
[30:44] was also very impressed with brother
[30:46] Jonathan Larga.
[30:49] Uh and many of you know brother Jonathan
[30:52] Larga uh whose father was one of the
[30:56] first converts uh over in the former
[31:00] Yugoslavia which is and they live in
[31:02] Croatia. But he said I was very
[31:05] impressed with him. Jonathan I'm very
[31:07] impressed with him and his family and
[31:09] his mother. His father died as a young
[31:12] man and Jonathan just raised up in his
[31:15] teens and stepped into his dad's place
[31:19] and he just said he shared details with
[31:22] us about his Facebook outreach. His
[31:25] Facebook outreach is simply that he has
[31:27] brother Brandham on Facebook as uh uh as
[31:33] as not as a person as such but as a
[31:39] oh the word just escapes me just now but
[31:42] that pe a profile of brother Brandham
[31:45] and he's had hundreds of thousands of
[31:48] inquiries from all over the world and
[31:51] and brother Bour just said it was that
[31:54] the effects and what he is doing on
[31:57] Facebook was literally staggering and
[32:00] that he has written a complete program
[32:03] for the same thing to be run in the
[32:06] United States but he didn't have the
[32:09] sufficient funds or the or the uh people
[32:13] to run it but he said I think that we
[32:16] can handle that from us in our church
[32:19] and we're having a Skype conference
[32:22] today that was yesterday and I was tied
[32:25] up with the in the wedding and uh and uh
[32:29] uh and the reception later on. So there
[32:32] were just a lot of things happening. But
[32:34] he said uh we we have the young men and
[32:38] young ladies, young people within our
[32:41] congregation, he said, "And I believe we
[32:43] can handle the whole thing." Uh and
[32:46] it'll be just it would be staggering for
[32:49] you to know. And it's not even the
[32:51] hundreds of thousands. It's even
[32:53] millions that they have handled. And
[32:56] it's not enough for us to just look
[32:58] stareyed and say, "Well, you know,
[33:00] that's over there." No, it's it's what
[33:02] can I do?
[33:03] &gt;&gt; That's the that's the challenge. What
[33:05] can I do in this late hour? And
[33:07] everybody can do something.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Everybody is, you know, just whether
[33:12] we're hospitable or whether we're we
[33:14] just a giving people. That's what we are
[33:16] to be. We're a giving people. We're so
[33:20] thankful for that. And thank you,
[33:22] brother Milco, for the uh good report
[33:24] and we'll be able to see more about
[33:26] these things a little later on.
[33:30] Uh I also uh had a email from brother
[33:34] Tom and uh he said I just received that
[33:38] this uh last night and he said I'm
[33:41] taking the last and final service today
[33:44] which will be Sunday at their time. It
[33:48] certainly has been very busy, but I must
[33:51] say a very rewarding experience, one
[33:54] that I will hold very dear. And your
[33:56] words of wisdom before I left have been
[33:59] very profound. I just I just felt so
[34:03] uh led, I guess I should say, and we
[34:06] just sat down, you know, and I said, I
[34:09] have a few words to say about about the
[34:12] meetings in Kinshasa.
[34:15] And uh he said it was just so so so
[34:19] fetting. But he he concluded by saying I
[34:23] can really see now what a jewel we have
[34:27] in brother Richard. That's brother Dioa.
[34:30] He's a he is a tremendous man of God and
[34:34] his love for you also runs very deep.
[34:37] Please greet the saints for me. So on
[34:40] behalf of brother Tom and and brother
[34:42] Michael, you have uh greetings and
[34:45] they're uh they're coming back wore out
[34:50] and that's good. We don't want them to
[34:52] come back, you know, all fresh and
[34:54] having had a having had a vacation.
[35:00] I remember I was in Johannesburg. had
[35:02] been I think it was our fifth year in
[35:04] Johannesburg and someone had just come
[35:06] over and they said well we just had them
[35:09] downtown etc etc and I said just a
[35:12] second I've been here 5 years I haven't
[35:14] seen downtown Johannesburg yet you know
[35:17] we're we're we're not here to see the
[35:20] sites we're here to do work and do labor
[35:23] and uh so God sees our hearts and
[35:26] there's nothing wrong with going
[35:27] downtown where we have nothing
[35:33] All right. Uh,
[35:38] I'll have you stand and brother Ryan,
[35:40] I'd like to sing. Open mine eyes that I
[35:43] may see. Glimpses of truth thou hast for
[35:46] me.
[35:53] Open
[35:54] my eyes that I can see.
[36:01] Graces of truth
[36:05] thou hast for me.
[36:09] Grace in my hand the wonderful
[36:15] king
[36:17] that shall
[36:21] set me free.
[36:26] Hallelujah.
[36:29] I wait for thee.
[36:33] Ready my God, th I will to see.
[36:41] Open my eyes
[36:45] to you and me.
[36:49] Spirit
[36:52] divine
[36:55] open my eyes
[36:57] open my
[37:02] [Music]
[37:12] Yes.
[37:17] [Music]
[37:29] This we pray father
[37:32] in the beloved name of Jesus Christ.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Word made flesh
[37:40] &gt;&gt; walked amongst us and is here with us.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; This is your promise. This is your word.
[37:48] And we pray now, Father, that you'll
[37:50] just allow the Holy Spirit to have free
[37:54] uh free course within the service, the
[37:57] preeminence. We pray that you'll be
[37:59] glorified, lifted up, take control. Help
[38:03] us, Lord, to relax. Help us to be calm.
[38:07] Help us to just yield ourselves to the
[38:11] will and the mind and the voice of the
[38:14] Holy Ghost in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[38:19] Amen.
[38:22] I want to just remark about the wedding
[38:24] yesterday and uh how thankful I was even
[38:28] though we had the big windstorm and the
[38:30] lights went out and all the rest of it.
[38:33] I did mention in the uh reception just
[38:36] briefly, but I noticed that the skylight
[38:39] is up right up here and uh the wind is
[38:43] howling outside and the lights have gone
[38:45] out and uh I thought, well, and then I
[38:49] noticed the sun started to shine right
[38:52] down there and the brethren pulled the
[38:54] curtains and light came in and I
[38:57] thought, "This is not bad."
[38:59] And so God shut off man's ingenuity and
[39:03] man's light and shone down himself.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And I thought brother John did a
[39:09] wonderful job.
[39:12] Uh you know some of it from notes and
[39:14] probably some from memory.
[39:17] I can well imagine. I can well imagine
[39:20] what that said. But anyway the the main
[39:23] purpose of the service was to get a
[39:25] couple united
[39:26] &gt;&gt; and that happened. And then I I just
[39:29] happened to mention the Walner family,
[39:32] but I also want to mention Sister Helen
[39:37] Walner, whose maiden name was Dick, and
[39:40] her family was there. And Sister Anna,
[39:43] her sister sang, that was Anna Bondi.
[39:47] And for those of you that know, that's
[39:48] her sister. And then her brothers got
[39:51] up, four of them, and sang a quartet, I
[39:54] believe it was. And that's all Sister
[39:56] Helen's family. And without without her
[40:00] contribution, there wouldn't been a
[40:02] wedding. So, we're thankful for that.
[40:04] And God bless you, brother and sister,
[40:06] Esther Hson, for all the work and labors
[40:09] that you've done. And and your guests
[40:11] that have come also, some from South
[40:14] Africa and some from the States, and
[40:16] we're so thankful to make uh make their
[40:19] acquaintance and shake their hand. Once
[40:21] again, well, we're going to read some
[40:23] scripture,
[40:26] but uh uh would you mind standing while
[40:30] I before we read? I have some comments
[40:33] to make. Some
[40:36] some subjects are very very difficult to
[40:38] approach and this is probably one of
[40:40] them.
[40:42] Um I want to speak on the invitation
[40:46] come and see
[40:49] and how that come and see the invitation
[40:52] is actually in two parts. It's the come
[40:55] part
[40:57] and the see part seeing.
[41:01] Multitudes followed Moses.
[41:04] They came but they didn't see who it was
[41:07] that they were actually following until
[41:10] Moses came down from the mountain with
[41:12] the word
[41:14] and then they left
[41:16] and Jesus came in the early part of his
[41:19] ministry and it was all come oh this
[41:23] young prophet from Nazareth and oh they
[41:27] thought maybe he's a maybe he's Elias or
[41:30] Jeremiah or Isaiah or one of the
[41:32] prophets that's all very complimentary.
[41:35] But when he finally said, "I and my
[41:37] father are one." That was it. Except you
[41:40] eat my flesh and drink my blood, you
[41:42] have no life in you. Oh, said, "Can you
[41:45] imagine what a doctor or medical people
[41:47] thought of that?" And people left. And
[41:50] the Bible says finally he was left with
[41:53] just a 12.
[41:55] He said that's when he said to Peter,
[41:58] "What who do men say that I am? or
[42:01] you're one of the prophets or you're
[42:03] this that or the other thing. He was a
[42:06] great rabbi. He was a great teacher.
[42:08] Whatever. But he said, "But who do you
[42:10] say I am?" He he made a statement which
[42:13] we've repeat all the time. But don't
[42:15] forget had never been said before.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; This was the first time.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[42:23] living God.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; And that had never been said before.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Blessed art thou." that
[42:30] was
[42:32] many people left
[42:34] and because they hadn't seen then I want
[42:36] to take you to and tie together the
[42:40] opening of the seals because a sealed
[42:43] book
[42:45] all down through the church ages we've
[42:47] had a sealed book and they came not that
[42:50] they were lost or anything but they came
[42:52] they came by the millions all during
[42:56] that time and God allowed that and they
[43:00] believed the word for their age or for
[43:03] their time. I also want to show from the
[43:06] scripture that God changes his form. And
[43:11] then I want to bring it down to the
[43:12] resurrection postresurrection
[43:15] in Luke 24, which is one of brother
[43:19] Brandham's last scriptures that he would
[43:21] read. And he calls it a prophecy.
[43:25] a prophecy made clear. Uh, modern events
[43:30] made clear. You have to hang on to that.
[43:33] You said, "Well, I've heard you say
[43:34] that. I haven't said it enough times."
[43:37] Modern events, events, what you're going
[43:41] through now, made clear by the prophecy.
[43:45] So, we need to look back at the
[43:47] prophecy, study the prophecy, ponder the
[43:50] prophecy. How, and that's what we'll do
[43:52] some this morning again. and and and see
[43:56] uh what was happening. And what was
[43:58] really happening is those disciples
[44:01] after the resurrection, they had come,
[44:04] they had followed, they went through the
[44:07] difficult time. They went through the
[44:08] falling away. They went through when
[44:10] everybody they hung on when they
[44:12] couldn't understand.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Can you identify with
[44:16] that? They hung on when they couldn't
[44:18] understand. They hung on because they
[44:20] couldn't let go.
[44:24] And Jesus in another form
[44:28] stayed with them till they could see
[44:30] him.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the seeing part
[44:36] &gt;&gt; and that's the critical part.
[44:40] So I firmly believe from the scriptures
[44:44] that Jesus Christ is lingering
[44:48] or desiring
[44:51] desiring to make himself known to his
[44:53] elect,
[44:55] the redeemed. Yet a little while in the
[44:58] world see me no more, seeth me no more,
[45:02] but you see me. Because I live, you
[45:05] shall live also. And in the message, the
[45:08] rising of the sun, prophet God said, he
[45:11] quotes that, "Because I live, you shall
[45:14] live also." Speaking to his wife,
[45:17] "Because I live, you live also." What a
[45:20] resurrection that that that was. And
[45:23] what a resurrection this is
[45:25] &gt;&gt; to be quickened from the dead. To be
[45:28] made alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[45:31] quickening power. He was waved to them.
[45:36] The word which was was waved back then
[45:40] back then on that day of Pentecost. The
[45:43] word made manifest now and as I say it
[45:49] is waved again for the last day.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; So in my my pre these are my
[45:58] pre-comments. It is supremely important
[46:01] that we, you both of us connect the
[46:05] scripture text that I want to refer to
[46:08] which is Revelation 6 which is the
[46:10] opening of the seals together with Luke
[46:13] 24
[46:16] it to connect that in the opening of the
[46:20] seals is the invitation to come and see.
[46:23] Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; When you open something, it's something
[46:29] to be seen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; As long as it's closed, you can come to
[46:33] a closed book, but it doesn't mean that
[46:36] you will see until God ordains and
[46:40] allows this is open. This is to be open
[46:43] now. And then when the and and when the
[46:45] lamb took the book and opened the first
[46:47] seal, the the the the living creature
[46:51] said such beast as the living creature
[46:53] said, "Come and see."
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Who's he inviting?
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Us.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; That's who he's inviting.
[47:04] That in Luke 24, the post-resurrection
[47:06] is the record
[47:09] of those that did come. They did come.
[47:13] That's why they were there the first
[47:14] part of the invitation, but lost sight
[47:16] of him for a short time in the
[47:19] transition or the change, the time of
[47:21] change. And friends, we're not here just
[47:24] having church this morning. We actually
[47:26] happen to be in a season of change.
[47:29] Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; The time when disciples are called upon
[47:36] to live out a prophecy that others in
[47:39] another age or a season will be called
[47:42] upon to fulfill. And there here we are.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; It is supremely important that we catch
[47:48] or see in the prophecies being fulfilled
[47:52] that we are there again.
[47:55] Uh the important thing for us at this
[47:58] point is not to be caught up with the
[48:01] Caiaphas crowd
[48:03] &gt;&gt; or the Judas and denying group or those
[48:06] that become weary and walk away.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That's not our that's not what we're
[48:12] here for. I'm not just here to, you
[48:14] know, to in to reach out necessarily to
[48:17] that. We are not called to beckon or
[48:20] preach them all back. Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; We are called to preach Christ and
[48:25] manifest his life in a way that those
[48:28] who can't let go or leave him will see
[48:32] him.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; That's what we're called to do. That's
[48:36] what it says. Preach Christ.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, as I laid and pondered these
[48:41] things which have been pondering for
[48:43] many days,
[48:45] his presence just came unexpectedly.
[48:49] And uh I found that I was I was
[48:53] pondering things that the prophet of God
[48:55] said. He said now he said if I can I'm
[48:58] not a preacher.
[49:00] I'm not a preacher. I can't preach like
[49:02] these men men of God preach. But he said
[49:05] I just try to yield myself
[49:09] &gt;&gt; relax myself
[49:11] quieten himself. And I just think
[49:15] what incredible
[49:17] what incredible. I began to think of the
[49:20] times that uh I was present and I'm
[49:24] conscious that with the passing of
[49:26] brother Perry Green and Brother Doug
[49:28] Mccuse and others of these men uh
[49:32] there's not many of my era left and I
[49:37] thought of the times if I'd only known
[49:40] or saw what I should have seen I'd have
[49:44] packed a recorder I would have packed a
[49:47] a video camera, I would have recorded
[49:49] these things for you. But now, all I can
[49:52] do is speak it
[49:54] &gt;&gt; and you'll be there to receive it and
[49:56] the Holy Spirit will witness it to you.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; So, we're not called
[50:03] to try to
[50:06] solve all the problems of people. We're
[50:08] not called to try to answer everybody's
[50:11] question,
[50:12] but we're here to tell you that this
[50:15] revealed word has the answer. Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; This revealed word is none other. I can
[50:20] declare it with un with unsophisticated
[50:24] perhaps a conversation or words, but
[50:27] this revealed word is none other than
[50:29] the person of Jesus Christ. And if you
[50:32] can just get to see him.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'll seek to
[50:39] try to minister.
[50:41] And just before we come to the
[50:42] scripture,
[50:44] in the last last last
[50:47] service that brother Brown preached
[50:50] publicly,
[50:52] he says, "I have a message I feel from
[50:55] God.
[50:57] It's a little odd to some people and I
[51:00] can't help being
[51:02] no more." He breaks. I just got to be
[51:06] what I am. I don't mean to be different.
[51:09] It's just that I'm living at a changing
[51:12] time.
[51:14] And I'd like to impose that upon you.
[51:18] You happen to be
[51:21] in a changing time.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Things are changing.
[51:26] And we're we're not concerned about the
[51:28] world and its condition. We know it's
[51:30] falling apart. We've been told that.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; We're not worried about all kinds of
[51:35] things and everybody's opinion and all
[51:37] that. We're not interested in it.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; We're interested in one thing. That this
[51:42] Jesus Christ
[51:43] &gt;&gt; who walked with his disciples in Luke
[51:46] 24, the prophecy
[51:49] &gt;&gt; saying it out and then sending a prophet
[51:51] in the end time. You know why I think
[51:53] that record that that that time is only
[51:56] that's only recorded once where where
[51:59] it's called Cleopus and his friend. It's
[52:03] only and it was recorded and I believe
[52:06] recorded in such detail in Luke's gospel
[52:10] so that it could be picked up
[52:13] &gt;&gt; by Jesus Christ again
[52:16] using using an h a son of man a son of
[52:21] man don't get it wrong a son of man to
[52:23] reveal the son of man and now now come
[52:27] the time where he wanted to say now I
[52:29] want to reveal another aspect of myself.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And that's why this has been left here
[52:36] because people have to hear they are the
[52:40] ones that are being called
[52:42] &gt;&gt; to live this out to experience this.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; And friends, the reason I'm so ardent or
[52:48] fervent about it is because it wasn't
[52:51] simple. It wasn't just we, you know,
[52:53] come to church and we do all the things,
[52:55] etc., etc., And we have uh we have our
[52:58] you know our our music and our uh
[53:01] preaching and the song service and the
[53:03] prayers and everything else. And I just
[53:06] want to I just want to caution you
[53:08] before we read the scripture.
[53:11] Brother Brandham says in this last
[53:14] service
[53:16] he said as long as you're building the
[53:18] wall one straight way it's all fine. The
[53:23] brick layers can and I feel like I'm
[53:25] probably a brick layer in the ministry.
[53:29] The brick layers can go right down the
[53:32] row. But when you have to turn the
[53:34] corner,
[53:36] that's where the time and we're not
[53:40] building a wall. We're building a house.
[53:44] You see? So these turns has come and we
[53:48] just want to pray for grace. Oh God,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just be a church goer. I
[53:53] want to be able to turn a corner.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, he turned a corner."
[53:57] Yeah, that's fine. Now, now it's our
[53:59] turn.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; We may have to turn a corner.
[54:04] Do you understand what I'm saying?
[54:07] It's down here. It's spoken. It's in
[54:09] word form. And now I pray that God will
[54:12] just help us.
[54:14] I'm going to read if you'd like to turn
[54:16] with me please to u revelation the 6th
[54:20] chapter.
[54:24] Thank you for standing. I'll be standing
[54:26] quite a while late yet.
[54:36] Verse one. And I saw when the lamb
[54:39] opened one of the seals and I heard as
[54:42] it where the noise of thunder,
[54:46] one of the four beasts, and that was
[54:48] there's two
[54:51] beasts are referred to twice in the book
[54:53] of Revelation. And one is a wild untamed
[54:57] creature, but the other one is a a
[54:59] living creature
[55:01] &gt;&gt; that has active life. And it's in always
[55:05] in the good sense. one of the four
[55:07] beasts, saying, "Come and see." And I
[55:10] saw, and behold, a white horse, and he
[55:12] that sat on him had a bow,
[55:15] and a crown was given unto him, and he
[55:18] had a bow, but no arrows. And he went
[55:20] forth conquering and to conquer. And
[55:23] when he had opened the second seal, I
[55:25] heard the second beast say, "Come and
[55:27] see." And there went out another horse
[55:29] that was red, and power was given to him
[55:33] uh that sat upon uh that sat thereon to
[55:37] take peace from the earth, and that they
[55:39] should kill one another. And there has
[55:42] there was given unto him a great sword.
[55:45] And when he had opened the third seal, I
[55:47] heard the third beast say, "Come and
[55:49] see." And I beheld, and lo, a black
[55:52] horse, and he that sat on him had a pair
[55:55] of balances in his hand. And I heard a
[55:57] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[55:59] say, "A measure of wheat for a for a
[56:01] penny, and three measures of barley for
[56:04] a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil
[56:06] and the wine." And when he had opened
[56:08] the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
[56:11] the fourth beast say, "Come and see."
[56:14] Thank you for standing. You may be
[56:16] seated. And I will I will have you
[56:19] follow me on the screen for one one or
[56:22] two slides.
[56:40] in the second seal
[56:42] are these words. So you'll read it with
[56:45] me now. A mysterious thing. Now when the
[56:48] beast told John just come and see and he
[56:52] didn't see what it was he just saw a
[56:56] symbol. Please
[56:59] mark that down in your minds because if
[57:02] you don't get that you don't you won't
[57:04] get you won't get anything f further. He
[57:08] just saw a symbol. And that symbol, the
[57:11] reason it was he said, "Come see." But
[57:16] he saw a symbol that was to symbolize it
[57:19] to the church in a way that they would
[57:23] watch until it came to the last age.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; It was spoken in a symbol. So people
[57:33] have always been very very keen and
[57:35] they've watched the symbol. It was to
[57:38] symbolize it to the church in a way that
[57:40] they would watch until it came to the
[57:42] last age and then the seal would be
[57:45] opened now and everyone understands that
[57:48] now the seals would be open.
[57:53] A symbol is something is anything that
[57:57] stands for or represents something else.
[58:01] In a story, a character
[58:05] uh uh an action, an object or an animal
[58:09] can be symbolic. Often these symbols
[58:12] stand for something abstract like a
[58:14] force of nature, a condition of the
[58:17] world or an idea. So, brother Venom is
[58:21] saying they saw it in a symbol form.
[58:24] That's the way John saw it and that's
[58:26] what he wrote in the scripture. That has
[58:29] been wrote in the scripture so that the
[58:32] church would uh hold that and see that
[58:36] until the last time until and and the
[58:39] reason he's saying the last age because
[58:41] in the last age the seal is opened and
[58:44] then it's told what it is. Yeah,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; I'm I don't want to get into it because
[58:48] I don't want to uh uh stray away from my
[58:53] my my subject.
[58:55] So now the the four times it is said the
[58:59] first four seals each time the living
[59:04] creature says come and see.
[59:07] Now, it's not only an invitation, but
[59:09] that encompasses the invitation. Come,
[59:13] and I can show you all down through the
[59:15] ages, multitudes came at the first part.
[59:21] Churches were established, people saw
[59:24] things, and doctrines were established,
[59:27] and creeds were established, and
[59:30] traditions were established. And many of
[59:33] you out there have all come from that.
[59:36] you've experienced that said, "Well, I
[59:38] was a Catholic. Well, I was a hu this or
[59:41] I was that. I was a Pentecostal. I was
[59:43] something else. I was a Luther and I was
[59:45] something else." And all of those have
[59:47] been established from and each one of
[59:50] them read the same symbol and have a
[59:52] different answer. It was absolutely
[59:54] essential that God bring an absolute
[59:58] &gt;&gt; in the end time. Otherwise, we have
[1:00:00] nothing to put our feet upon where no
[1:00:03] grounds, no absolute. And then not only
[1:00:06] to say it's an absolute, but to declare
[1:00:08] what it is. This this this horse one
[1:00:11] riding the white horse. He's everything
[1:00:14] from the Holy Spirit to the devil.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he's the devil.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; He comes riding with deception. But uh
[1:00:25] but but then the other power that that
[1:00:28] rode out, the other power that God
[1:00:30] raised up, and he raises up one in every
[1:00:33] age to combat
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; that power.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And what God sends is always more than
[1:00:41] adequate
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; for what Satan sends out.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And so friends, it doesn't matter what
[1:00:46] he's doing. We're not interested in his
[1:00:49] scheme because we have his scheme
[1:00:51] numbered.
[1:00:54] Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So who is giving the invitation?
[1:00:59] The beast the living creature says come
[1:01:02] and see.
[1:01:04] And in the I don't have to give you
[1:01:06] meaning because uh the living creature
[1:01:10] is this
[1:01:12] to live
[1:01:14] to breathe to be among the living not
[1:01:17] lifeless not dead.
[1:01:20] So when you see the beast says come and
[1:01:23] see this is what the scripture this is
[1:01:26] the meaning of that to have true life
[1:01:30] and worthy of the name active blessed
[1:01:34] endless in the kingdom of God. It
[1:01:37] represents living water having vital
[1:01:40] power in itself and exerting the same
[1:01:43] upon the soul to be full of vigor to be
[1:01:47] fresh strong efficient and active and
[1:01:52] powerful. Now, aren't aren't those all
[1:01:55] sound good?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what that is.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; So, where is the where we can say, well,
[1:02:03] that that's fine. That's a nice
[1:02:05] representation. But where is it? Well, I
[1:02:07] can tell you friends that
[1:02:10] I don't need to excite you.
[1:02:12] It's enough to declare that God has said
[1:02:15] that.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; But then we have to have a a a voice
[1:02:20] that can uh not only declare it but
[1:02:24] represent it and identify it and say
[1:02:27] here it is. See this here. See there it
[1:02:30] is. And you can see it in the world and
[1:02:32] see see it all within the church world
[1:02:35] and denominations. But now here's it's
[1:02:38] not enough to find out just what's
[1:02:39] wrong.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; You have to have an answer
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; for the people to believe in someplace
[1:02:45] to anchor their faith.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; So Jesus spoke in parables
[1:02:53] which are somewhat like a symbol. Jesus
[1:02:56] spoke in parables, but he spoke in
[1:02:58] parables in such a way that the
[1:02:59] scripture says, "And the scribes and
[1:03:03] Pharisees, especially the Pharisees,
[1:03:05] perceived that he spoke of them
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; because a parable is like an analogy.
[1:03:15] It's it's it's descriptive of something
[1:03:19] taking place." And they perceive that he
[1:03:22] spake of them. Same thing today.
[1:03:26] Exactly the same thing.
[1:03:29] And in the first seal, it says it
[1:03:31] thundered as soon as the lamb struck
[1:03:33] back the seal. And what did it reveal?
[1:03:37] And this is what's Please, I wanted to
[1:03:40] make a slide of this, but I I didn't
[1:03:42] have a chance. The first seal. Now,
[1:03:45] here's a prophet taking that same verse
[1:03:48] we read.
[1:03:49] It thundered as soon as the lamb struck
[1:03:52] back the seal. And what did it reveal?
[1:03:56] Not all of itself.
[1:03:58] First, it was with God.
[1:04:02] Next, it's in a symbol.
[1:04:06] Then, it's revealed three things. It's
[1:04:10] coming forth from
[1:04:13] the throne.
[1:04:15] First, it can't be seen, heard, or
[1:04:19] nothing.
[1:04:21] It's sealed up.
[1:04:24] You can't see who the author is in a
[1:04:29] sealed book.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; You getting my point?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying it and perhaps
[1:04:35] it takes someone in the ministry to just
[1:04:38] take that's why I ponder spend so much
[1:04:41] time. First, it's a symbol.
[1:04:45] See, first he said it's with God. God
[1:04:49] has it.
[1:04:50] Then it's given and it's in a symbol
[1:04:53] form and the prophet says it's in a
[1:04:55] symbol form all through the church ages
[1:04:58] so it can be symbolized to the people
[1:05:01] and they they they ponder it and they
[1:05:03] think about it and and all kinds of
[1:05:05] doctrines. I I heard someone was on had
[1:05:08] a radio broadcast same time we had a
[1:05:10] radio broadcast. He opened the seven
[1:05:12] seals.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; You don't even know his name. I uh I
[1:05:16] know his name but I won't mention it
[1:05:18] just now. Uh uh. Where'd it go? Nowhere.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Now here comes someone with a seventh
[1:05:26] grade education out of Kentucky and
[1:05:28] preaches the opening of the seals. And
[1:05:30] where's it gone? All over the earth.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; In many, many languages.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because because it was so perfect.
[1:05:39] No. No. It wasn't because it was so nice
[1:05:41] and and set out just nice. It was a a
[1:05:45] gripping because it the Holy Spirit was
[1:05:47] there to reveal it to the people. The
[1:05:51] believing heart when it fell into a
[1:05:53] believing heart,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; it it people saw
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; saw something.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I know what I say when I say saw
[1:06:05] something.
[1:06:07] So now
[1:06:09] it was just it was just a a a symbol, he
[1:06:14] said. So it thundered. It it was sealed
[1:06:18] up. The lamb's the lamb's blood paid the
[1:06:22] price. It thundered when he spoke it
[1:06:25] out. And when he did, now don't lose.
[1:06:28] Don't lose your thought when I speak of
[1:06:32] the symbols. It thundered. That's a
[1:06:34] symbol. the lamb. It's a symbol. He's
[1:06:38] not that form. I'm gonna please if you
[1:06:41] you'll have to really pinch your
[1:06:42] conscience.
[1:06:44] It thundered. And when he spoke it out
[1:06:46] and when he did, a white horse rider
[1:06:49] started out. He said, "And it still was
[1:06:51] a symbol."
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a symbol. All of those are
[1:06:55] symbols.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; So, one says, "Oh, the white horse rider
[1:06:58] is the Holy Ghost." And well, I I I I'm
[1:07:01] sorry. I just need to have a a prophet,
[1:07:03] please. Yeah,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; one who can be vindicated maybe on a
[1:07:09] completely different scale, something
[1:07:11] that I can understand. Somebody hears in
[1:07:13] front of him and they're sick. I
[1:07:16] understand that. That's not a symbol.
[1:07:18] They're sick. Uh they're crippled or
[1:07:21] there's something and and and he stands
[1:07:23] there and says, uh
[1:07:26] he's one one real outstanding a lady's
[1:07:29] there and he says, "You've been examined
[1:07:31] by doctors, etc., and they couldn't find
[1:07:34] out what's wrong.
[1:07:37] And he says, and he said, "Can I?" And
[1:07:41] he whispers, "Can I tell the people?"
[1:07:44] Because he didn't want to embarrass her.
[1:07:47] He says, "When you were a child, you
[1:07:50] fell down a well."
[1:07:53] Where do you get that?
[1:07:55] When you were a child, that's why I'm
[1:07:57] standing here.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; That's not a symbol. That's a That's a
[1:08:02] woman standing there and and and and and
[1:08:05] it goes to the world and it's on tape
[1:08:07] and it's public.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And you fell down a well and loosened
[1:08:11] your organs and they've never been able
[1:08:14] to find out what's wrong. That's not a
[1:08:17] symbol, friends. That's reality. And to
[1:08:20] have a woman say, "That's the truth."
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we're not following
[1:08:26] some fables.
[1:08:29] We're not following some interpretation
[1:08:31] of symbols.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; We're following something that's been
[1:08:34] proven with clear evidence,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; something that you can understand. I can
[1:08:40] understand. It's not mysterious. It's
[1:08:42] reality.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It's something worth being excited
[1:08:46] about. Finally, you found truth.
[1:08:49] [Music]
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Finally, you found a mouth.
[1:08:54] Truth. And if he says truth and it's not
[1:08:57] a symbol there, then he can take the
[1:08:59] symbols of this
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; and declare it to us.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Now he said, now watch, he said it would
[1:09:13] be known in the last day, but it comes
[1:09:16] forth in a church symbol. Do you
[1:09:18] understand it, church? It comes forth in
[1:09:21] a symbol of a church that they know
[1:09:24] there is a seal, but just what it is
[1:09:28] yet, they don't know because it's a
[1:09:30] white horse rider. And it is only I'm
[1:09:33] only using as an example. And it it only
[1:09:36] is to be revealed in the last day when
[1:09:39] the actual seal is broken. Broken to
[1:09:42] who? Not to Christ, but to the church.
[1:09:47] Notice now. Oh my, that just makes me
[1:09:50] tremble. I hope that the church truly
[1:09:53] understands it. You people, I'm going to
[1:09:56] call you bride that you'll understand
[1:09:59] it.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Change the whole atmosphere.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; You accept that? Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; A voice is a thunder.
[1:10:18] The voice came from where? From the
[1:10:21] throne where the lamb had just left his
[1:10:26] as intercessor.
[1:10:28] Now he's standing here to take his
[1:10:30] position and his claims.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; The voice shook the ground. There was a
[1:10:35] thunder.
[1:10:37] The voice shook the foundations of your
[1:10:40] old religions and beliefs.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; The voice each of the four beasts all
[1:10:46] said, "Come and see." And that's my
[1:10:50] message today. Come. And that's why
[1:10:53] you're here. That's why you're sitting
[1:10:56] in this congregation. Come
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; and see.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; It's not sufficient just to come. it and
[1:11:05] and there is something there for us as
[1:11:07] individuals, you that may be here as
[1:11:11] visitors for the first time. I I don't
[1:11:13] know perhaps those friends that have
[1:11:15] stayed over from the from the wedding.
[1:11:18] But I want you to know that this
[1:11:20] building and this uh society or this uh
[1:11:24] this church is not here just to
[1:11:27] entertain or to have the formality.
[1:11:30] We're not going in a straight line just
[1:11:33] building another wall. That's not the
[1:11:36] program. The program is there's someone
[1:11:39] to say.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Someone spoke.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Someone thundered. They put it in a
[1:11:45] thunder back there. It's not a thunder
[1:11:47] anymore. It's a voice that's been
[1:11:49] spoken.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And it's not just a book that's been
[1:11:53] written. There's an author behind it.
[1:11:56] There's an author. It's the same Christ,
[1:11:59] same Jesus Christ yesterday and today
[1:12:03] and forever. He'll be the same again.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave some out here because
[1:12:12] I want to I want to get to some what I
[1:12:16] consider very important. I was very very
[1:12:18] touched.
[1:12:25] Not only did these
[1:12:28] riders, this is symbolic now, not only
[1:12:30] did the horse riders ride out and power
[1:12:33] and take peace from the earth and all of
[1:12:35] these things,
[1:12:37] but this voice that was crying out, come
[1:12:40] and see. There was an anointing because
[1:12:43] those living those living creatures was
[1:12:47] like an anointing that would come down
[1:12:49] upon the people to combat.
[1:12:53] And I I I h I I have that. He said, 'Now
[1:12:56] we'll prove to you by the history of the
[1:12:58] church and by the opening of the seals
[1:13:01] and the powers that let loose and watch
[1:13:04] exactly the church responding to the
[1:13:07] anointing and they couldn't do anything.
[1:13:10] He said in one place he said uh you he
[1:13:14] quotes the scripture don't hurt the oil
[1:13:16] and the wine. That's the uh that is the
[1:13:20] stimulation. Listen friends, their
[1:13:22] stimulation with preaching, their
[1:13:24] stimulation with believing the word.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; They didn't care. Speaking of the
[1:13:30] believers back there, they didn't care
[1:13:32] because the spirit of the church in that
[1:13:35] day was sacrifice. It was the time of
[1:13:38] the ox. There was different ages, lion,
[1:13:43] the ox, and the labor and and so on. And
[1:13:48] he said they didn't care because the
[1:13:50] spirit of the church in that day was
[1:13:52] sacrifice
[1:13:54] labor. And they walked up just as freely
[1:13:57] as they could walk anointed with the
[1:14:00] true spirit of God of that age. But now
[1:14:04] we're in another age.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And this is what's really heavy upon my
[1:14:09] heart. I don't want to speak to you. I
[1:14:11] don't want to just preach to you. I want
[1:14:13] to rather make an announcement to you.
[1:14:19] It might not mean as much to you as it
[1:14:22] does to me and I trust I could convey
[1:14:25] it.
[1:14:26] I believe that
[1:14:31] I'm identified that we are identified
[1:14:35] with the people in Luke 24
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; because I take it from the I take it
[1:14:42] from the statements. What a resurrection
[1:14:44] that was.
[1:14:46] That was their time,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't easy.
[1:14:52] The ladies did what ladies do. They went
[1:14:54] home and they made spices.
[1:14:56] That was their concern. And make spices.
[1:15:00] He's already changed form.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; They had to have
[1:15:08] will you? I'm going to risk being
[1:15:10] considered kind of off up here for a
[1:15:12] moment. I'm going to take that risk.
[1:15:15] The ladies prepared spices and that's
[1:15:18] what they do.
[1:15:20] And here's the apostles. They're men.
[1:15:24] They got, you know, men do what men do.
[1:15:27] Men are in control and they do things.
[1:15:30] And but they're fearful now because
[1:15:33] their leader has died. And this is a
[1:15:37] very, very dim, sad time,
[1:15:41] wretchedly sad time. and and and the
[1:15:45] whole group has fallen apart.
[1:15:49] You've heard me say it before, but I
[1:15:50] want it to be such a reality. And the
[1:15:53] treasurer has committed suicide
[1:15:56] and the political system has come
[1:15:59] against him and the religious system has
[1:16:00] come against what we believe and we had
[1:16:03] believed that he would be the one that
[1:16:05] would deliver us from this Roman hand.
[1:16:09] They were looking for some political
[1:16:12] deliverance and things and it doesn't
[1:16:14] always turn out the way we anticipate
[1:16:17] it.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; It doesn't always happen the way we have
[1:16:21] it figured out. And you know, I I'm I'm
[1:16:26] reaching way out here. Some of our
[1:16:28] problem is a carryover from the church
[1:16:31] world.
[1:16:35] And I believe that our our anticipation
[1:16:38] and our expectation is tainted
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and it could be it could be that it dims
[1:16:49] our our vision
[1:16:54] and they were expecting something else.
[1:16:57] But now he had actually changed. And so
[1:17:00] the women the women just like sisters
[1:17:02] like you, what are you concerned about?
[1:17:05] Well, we're concerned about, you know,
[1:17:06] what people eat and we'll have a lunch
[1:17:09] and we'll have whatever more and we'll
[1:17:11] have a reception or we'll have, you
[1:17:13] know, we're taken up with things. This
[1:17:15] is what this is what happens in the
[1:17:17] church. This is what we do. We feel
[1:17:19] responsible to do certain things. And
[1:17:22] what we do, what our custom is here, we
[1:17:24] anoint the body with spices. And so
[1:17:27] we'll go home and prepare the spices and
[1:17:30] and then they come and then you know
[1:17:33] then they're thinking about woman
[1:17:35] things. Who's going to roll the stone
[1:17:37] away? Now what are you thinking? You're
[1:17:39] talking about the resurrection. And the
[1:17:40] prophet says what a resurrection that
[1:17:42] that was.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But what a resurrection this is.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? Things that
[1:17:50] aren't real. No, he's talking about
[1:17:52] reality.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Saying that's a prophecy. Who's
[1:17:56] fulfilling it?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; When is it going to be fulfilled?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Who's going to roll the stone away? And
[1:18:04] they come and the stones rolled away.
[1:18:08] So they come and they
[1:18:13] look in in there and they see a young
[1:18:16] man. The Bible says one place they see a
[1:18:19] young man and he's in a long garment.
[1:18:22] And he says, "Who who do you seek?
[1:18:26] Oh, he said, "I know that you seek Jesus
[1:18:28] of Nazareth. He's not here."
[1:18:31] And he said, "Remember when he said to
[1:18:33] you,
[1:18:36] and
[1:18:38] listen close now, first time I've I
[1:18:41] encountered it in a in a message this
[1:18:44] last week." And Brother Brandham says
[1:18:46] the angels were there when he he said
[1:18:50] when they they said, "Remember how he
[1:18:52] said to you?" He said they were there
[1:18:55] when he said that.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; He said the angels are around the
[1:19:01] believers.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And if that's true, then I have to say
[1:19:06] unequivocally that the angels of God are
[1:19:10] present in this building. This building
[1:19:13] isn't here to entertain people. This
[1:19:15] building isn't here just to preach
[1:19:17] services. This building isn't here just
[1:19:19] to fill some some need in your life.
[1:19:22] This building is here so that you can
[1:19:24] come to see Jesus Christ, the author of
[1:19:27] this message.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; He's the author of it.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; That's why it's here.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, you can miss
[1:19:40] a lot of things in life. Don't miss
[1:19:42] this.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Don't miss this one.
[1:19:48] Yes Lord.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:19:52] this is go and tell his disciples.
[1:19:55] So they ran and told the disciples and
[1:19:59] Peter and John. Two of them ran. John
[1:20:02] was a faster. He outran Peter and he
[1:20:06] looked in the tomb, but he didn't go in.
[1:20:10] I'm I'm I'm stressing this now. And then
[1:20:13] Peter went in. And then John went in.
[1:20:16] And Peter went in and he saw the linen
[1:20:19] cloth that was around his head is
[1:20:21] wrapped up separate from the other linen
[1:20:24] clothes. And I was at a Jewish wedding
[1:20:26] not too long ago. And my family was
[1:20:29] there, a very dear friend, Orthodox Jew.
[1:20:32] And with them, they, you know, they
[1:20:34] don't inbomb them. They want them to
[1:20:36] return to the dust as quickly as
[1:20:38] possible.
[1:20:41] Just hold that.
[1:20:44] And they wrap. They wrap. It doesn't
[1:20:46] matter whether the man is a popper or a
[1:20:50] billionaire.
[1:20:51] The family, the men of the family wash
[1:20:54] the body and wrap them in linen and it
[1:20:58] put into a plain box,
[1:21:01] a plain wooden box, and buried as
[1:21:04] quickly as possible. And the family, I
[1:21:07] was standing there as they poured the
[1:21:09] dirt on it. This is in this is in United
[1:21:13] States of America. This is in Los
[1:21:15] Angeles. This is in a highass cemetery,
[1:21:19] but you're buried as same as Jesus was
[1:21:22] buried into a tomb with linen. He was
[1:21:26] wrapped in linen and put in this box.
[1:21:33] I asked a funeral director over here. I
[1:21:36] said, "Is the cost any different if they
[1:21:38] don't have to embomb somebody?" No, I
[1:21:41] said it's pretty much the same. That's a
[1:21:44] racket.
[1:21:46] Excuse me. It's a racket. And brother
[1:21:48] Brandham says, "I feel," he says, "I was
[1:21:51] thinking about a corpse." He said, "I
[1:21:53] feel sorry. I feel sorry for the corpse.
[1:21:57] He's dead." And then he goes, they take
[1:22:00] him to a morg. He said, "I feel sorry
[1:22:02] for him." They take him to a morg and
[1:22:05] pump him full of fluid to make sure he
[1:22:07] stays dead.
[1:22:09] He said, he said, "Then these churches,"
[1:22:12] he said, "they receive," he said, "these
[1:22:14] cold formal morgs,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; they take someone who's dead and pump
[1:22:19] him full of doctrine and make sure he
[1:22:21] stays dead."
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; I say, "Thank God for some truth."
[1:22:27] [Applause]
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Said to brother Chris Price, you know,
[1:22:31] brother Chris Price, nobody can forget
[1:22:33] him. 6'10", I think he is. He I was
[1:22:37] talking to him and just talking about
[1:22:39] the message to him and he said, "I just
[1:22:42] want to come up there." He says, "And
[1:22:43] you just put the needle in my vein and
[1:22:46] just keep feeding it to me."
[1:22:49] That's the way he put it.
[1:22:52] Hallelujah. I just want truth to be
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] So the disciples then they ran.
[1:23:05] I'm glad.
[1:23:09] Now this is where
[1:23:12] if you consider this is kind of off
[1:23:14] track. Just put it to me because I enjoy
[1:23:18] it. I'm glad that somebody in this day
[1:23:22] outran me
[1:23:24] and ran to the tomb.
[1:23:27] And we had a prophet in this day
[1:23:30] look and see. He went into the darkness
[1:23:33] of Leodya
[1:23:35] and they went into the tomb and said,
[1:23:38] "He's not here.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; He's not here." Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; And Cleopus and his friend are walking
[1:23:47] with him. Now we're getting into we're
[1:23:49] going from Revelation 6. Now we're back
[1:23:52] to Luke 24 and also Mark 16 and also
[1:23:58] John about 20. And he's walking and
[1:24:01] they're walking with him and now he's a
[1:24:05] different form. In Moses' time, he was a
[1:24:08] pillar of fire and a burning bush and he
[1:24:12] was a cloud by day and a fire by night.
[1:24:16] And then all through the scriptures, uh,
[1:24:18] some saw him as a man. And then they
[1:24:21] didn't even realize that they'd seen
[1:24:23] God. And they said, "We're going to die
[1:24:25] because we've seen God." And they saw
[1:24:28] him as a man. Some saw a prophet uh the
[1:24:31] the woman who who didn't have a child
[1:24:34] saw a man of God and she said to her
[1:24:37] husband, "Can't we just build a place
[1:24:39] for this man of God?" And they didn't
[1:24:42] know what they were doing. And and to
[1:24:44] her it was a man of God. Didn't know he
[1:24:46] was Elijah. And they built a place and
[1:24:49] it was a woman. So she was interested in
[1:24:51] water and a pitcher and a little table
[1:24:54] and a bed where he could lay down and
[1:24:56] rest. And after that, she didn't know
[1:24:58] what she was doing. God simply looked
[1:25:02] upon that and said, "That's it.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bless you."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Prophet says, "Call the woman. What can
[1:25:09] we do for her?" Says, "Everything's
[1:25:11] fine. I'm here with my people and I'm at
[1:25:14] peace and I really don't need anything."
[1:25:17] And Gahesy says, "She hasn't got a
[1:25:20] child.
[1:25:21] She hasn't got a baby.
[1:25:25] You'll have a child. you'll embrace a
[1:25:27] child
[1:25:31] and 12 years later the child dies
[1:25:35] and and then she knows where to go and
[1:25:38] she gets a child a second time. What is
[1:25:40] that? That's a blessing of God.
[1:25:42] Let me say something to you friends. I'm
[1:25:44] getting very very personal.
[1:25:48] From the very day you weren't here, many
[1:25:50] of you weren't here. I saw Sister Violet
[1:25:54] Laws and she was here in the house.
[1:25:59] There you are, Sister Violet.
[1:26:01] But the one thing and I I I I my heart
[1:26:05] is touched, but I I I just knew that
[1:26:08] something was on the tapes.
[1:26:10] Something's in that voice that these
[1:26:13] young people that these young men, they
[1:26:16] need.
[1:26:18] And that was the beginning.
[1:26:23] Then we wanted to put it on the radio
[1:26:27] and went went for about nine years on
[1:26:29] the radio.
[1:26:31] Went into Africa. New people from South
[1:26:33] Africa. People from down there told me
[1:26:37] that they were they were they were there
[1:26:40] when brother Brandham's passport was
[1:26:43] stamped. He could not preach. Billy
[1:26:44] Paul's was stamped in case he used that
[1:26:46] passport or whatever. and uh and and he
[1:26:50] said there and I've seen the little 8 mm
[1:26:52] film. He said uh at the airport I but I
[1:26:55] believe Africa will hear my voice again.
[1:27:03] And the people said a brother said do
[1:27:06] you think you can get on the radio? And
[1:27:08] we got on the radio on Swazi music
[1:27:11] radio, 100,000 watts covered an area
[1:27:13] inhabited by 87 million people and and
[1:27:18] brothers there told me that they fell on
[1:27:20] the floor when I heard brother
[1:27:22] Brandham's voice coming over in Africa
[1:27:24] hearing his voice once again. You could
[1:27:27] just see that spirit of Elijah and and
[1:27:30] right after that a big Pentecostal
[1:27:33] movement sent out a magazine which was
[1:27:35] their magazine. And they sent out this
[1:27:37] magazine and I read the headlines myself
[1:27:39] says where is Elijah
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; and here they just had rejected him. All
[1:27:45] I'm telling you here a little group in
[1:27:48] the house and then we went into a log
[1:27:50] church. I'm not talking about us. I'm
[1:27:52] talking about him and this word. That's
[1:27:54] what I'm talking about. And and just
[1:27:59] tens of thou we didn't have didn't have
[1:28:00] any consideration of the cost. What is
[1:28:03] the cost? It wasn't the cost. was this
[1:28:06] message need to go out.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; God has to look after the cost.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And it was it was huge.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; It was huge, folks. I didn't I didn't
[1:28:16] even know it at the time, but it was
[1:28:18] huge. It was about $70,000 a year. I'm
[1:28:22] not here to talk about finance. I'm here
[1:28:24] just to tell you what happened. But do
[1:28:26] you know that we never ever needed to
[1:28:29] pump? never had to ask for funds, never
[1:28:33] had to take it from the people because
[1:28:36] God always provided it. I don't know
[1:28:38] where it came from. Just came pouring in
[1:28:40] and we got to build another place. So,
[1:28:42] we built a log church and that was
[1:28:44] packed out and came into this church and
[1:28:46] packed out. And today, even today, you
[1:28:49] can ask our our our brothers, we don't
[1:28:51] pump for it. We take an offering which
[1:28:53] is considered uh that's what we're
[1:28:56] instructed to do. just receive an
[1:28:58] offering from the people. But I all I
[1:29:01] want to say is God Almighty, if this is
[1:29:04] his word, he prospers it.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't I I I hesitated about
[1:29:15] this this morning because I didn't want
[1:29:17] you I didn't want to be misunderstood.
[1:29:20] Brother Milo here has traveled over
[1:29:22] about 30 years. He traveled to hundreds
[1:29:24] of places probably with me or many many
[1:29:27] maybe that's an exaggeration but many
[1:29:29] many trips and and and and it was very
[1:29:32] very necessary but he was one of two
[1:29:34] people that got lifetime free travel or
[1:29:39] next to free on the airlines and was
[1:29:42] able to come. So consequently took the
[1:29:45] prophet's message into Yugoslavia when
[1:29:49] it was absolutely rigid. who couldn't do
[1:29:51] so. And and and I was standing right
[1:29:54] there when the officer uh went like this
[1:29:58] thought we couldn't speak speak their
[1:30:01] language. So he just went like this. He
[1:30:02] wanted our suitcases open. Brother
[1:30:04] Milo's suitcase is sitting here to
[1:30:07] declare that this is the truth. He and
[1:30:09] this is the truth. Brother Milco, you
[1:30:12] raised your hand. And it was full of
[1:30:13] tapes.
[1:30:15] His suitcase was absolutely full of
[1:30:17] tapes. That wasn't only a no no. that
[1:30:20] was worth a prison sentence.
[1:30:23] And the man I opened up my case and I
[1:30:26] got my shirts and all the suit and
[1:30:28] things and and he opens up his case and
[1:30:30] it's all tapes and the man just goes
[1:30:32] like this. So we folded up our suitcase.
[1:30:35] Brother Milo looked at me right in front
[1:30:37] of right in front of him and said to me
[1:30:39] he didn't he all he saw was shirts.
[1:30:42] That's exactly what he said. All he saw
[1:30:44] was shirts. I don't know what he saw.
[1:30:46] All I know is he didn't see the tapes.
[1:30:49] Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; You know, the believers over there took
[1:30:55] up a little offering. Just believers
[1:30:56] like yourself took up an offering and
[1:30:58] and and wanted to get some u the church
[1:31:02] agents or something printed and uh and
[1:31:04] they slipped it into a video into a
[1:31:07] video package. And because because the
[1:31:10] brother knew he was going to be examined
[1:31:12] by the police and saw the police come on
[1:31:14] and start to come through the uh train
[1:31:17] cars and he thought I have to get rid of
[1:31:19] this. So he tried to figure out where
[1:31:22] where they were and threw that $4,000
[1:31:26] that came from this church in US money,
[1:31:30] stuck in a video box and threw it out
[1:31:33] the window into the grass and went back
[1:31:36] the next day with a sythe trying to find
[1:31:39] where it was and found that box
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; with the money in it.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Who loves this message more than us? God
[1:31:48] loves it.
[1:31:49] God loves his word.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And now this is where I want to come to
[1:31:56] the one thing that is and you go home
[1:31:58] and read and ponder Luke 24. And I found
[1:32:02] another place in 1958 where brother
[1:32:05] Brandham refers to that as a prophecy.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I take that very very serious.
[1:32:14] I feel that I have been a part of
[1:32:18] a part of the fulfillment that we are a
[1:32:22] part of the fulfillment.
[1:32:24] What a resurrection this is. And and if
[1:32:26] we're expecting and I hear I hear it
[1:32:30] preached. Brother John mentions it quite
[1:32:33] often, the body change.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; And we don't want that just to be a
[1:32:39] phrase
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; for you to hear
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; and to repeat. a body change. But I can
[1:32:45] tell you something that this message
[1:32:49] says in different ways. There'll be a
[1:32:52] sweep. What kind of a sweep? I don't
[1:32:55] know. But there'll be a sweep that'll
[1:32:58] come over us. He says another place
[1:33:01] there'll be a change in the atoms.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I can say this to you and I will say it
[1:33:07] without apology. I believe that it is
[1:33:11] essential. You've heard this. You've
[1:33:13] heard the statement get into the word or
[1:33:15] get into the message or get into I want
[1:33:17] to say it at a different at a different
[1:33:19] level. I would ask you to take it and
[1:33:24] ponder it and go into the scripture and
[1:33:28] ponder it and read Luke 24 if you would
[1:33:32] and ponder it and recall that this is a
[1:33:36] prophecy and I'm in here someplace
[1:33:40] because really what was happening he's
[1:33:43] changing his mask he's changing his form
[1:33:48] from flesh
[1:33:50] to be a spirit.
[1:33:53] He's changing his form. And Apostle Paul
[1:33:57] saw him and he says this, "I I I was on
[1:34:01] my way to Damascus and I saw a great
[1:34:02] light
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; and I heard a voice."
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Now, he Now, he wasn't just It wasn't
[1:34:10] what Mary saw in the garden. It wasn't
[1:34:15] Maybe I'm bewildering you, but it's
[1:34:17] it'll be good. it'll be productive.
[1:34:19] We don't know. We're not trying to
[1:34:21] isolate and say or define this is going
[1:34:24] to be what you're going to see. This is
[1:34:26] what going to be your form. But the
[1:34:28] Bible does say that the dead in Christ
[1:34:31] shall rise first.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And we were that are alive and remain
[1:34:38] shall be caught up together with them.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; That is the scripture. Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; That is a scripture that God loves.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Furthermore, it's a scripture
[1:34:51] that will be the ultimate victory
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; over death.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; People have died have died for
[1:35:00] centuries, for thousands of years.
[1:35:02] People have died. But there's going to
[1:35:04] be a time that there's going to be some
[1:35:07] that are going to cheat death.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; They're going to ride victorious over
[1:35:12] death. Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Whether I do, I don't know. I trust I
[1:35:17] will. But there's going to be people
[1:35:18] that are going to cheat death.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; You have a possibility.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Orin,
[1:35:33] you brothers,
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; you families, you sisters.
[1:35:37] I'm getting right down to where you
[1:35:39] live. We have an opportunity.
[1:35:41] It's been said, "What is this message
[1:35:43] all about? If this message isn't about
[1:35:46] that, is this message about another
[1:35:48] another church or just some things that
[1:35:50] we believe?" I say, "No,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; that's not really what it is."
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; You're nice and quiet.
[1:36:13] I want to say something else to you
[1:36:19] every time. Now, it's no mystery.
[1:36:23] Uh what Satan has rode out with. Oh,
[1:36:27] he's rode out with technology and he's
[1:36:29] rode out with soft living and he's
[1:36:32] rolled out with economics that puts a
[1:36:33] lot of pressure. There isn't anybody
[1:36:35] here that hasn't got some economic
[1:36:37] pressure.
[1:36:40] One way or another, you got some
[1:36:42] economic pressure.
[1:36:46] That's part of life.
[1:36:51] These things tend to
[1:36:55] uh you know dim our vision.
[1:37:00] We become involved
[1:37:02] and the burdens of life who hasn't got
[1:37:04] burdens
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; the burdens of life become they weigh
[1:37:10] way we way down. I can I can take you to
[1:37:13] the scripture says that we get weary.
[1:37:20] can become very very weary
[1:37:24] with life
[1:37:26] and it tends to dim our vision and then
[1:37:28] we start getting you know we're where
[1:37:32] our our conversation or we become uh
[1:37:36] engaged everything that we're engaged in
[1:37:38] is you know about our work or about our
[1:37:41] what we're doing and so on and so forth
[1:37:44] and to and I laid down yesterday
[1:37:48] and as I laid there and I begin to think
[1:37:51] of
[1:37:53] the greatness of God
[1:37:57] and God became so great and I thought of
[1:38:00] the constellations and I thought of the
[1:38:02] heavens and the heavens that declare his
[1:38:05] glory and the more I thought about him
[1:38:08] friends I'm standing here speaking to
[1:38:10] you I got feeling smaller and smaller
[1:38:14] and I begin to think about you know what
[1:38:16] I think and what someone else thinks and
[1:38:18] all these tinkly little things and I
[1:38:20] thought, what does that mean to God?
[1:38:22] Nothing.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. And we become so
[1:38:27] taken up with it and so involved with it
[1:38:30] and and then that he thinks this and
[1:38:32] they think that and some opinion over
[1:38:35] here and something over there. Listen
[1:38:37] friends,
[1:38:39] we we're getting out of focus.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; We're getting out of focus. Don't get
[1:38:43] out of focus.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Keep your eye on the goal.
[1:38:49] Keep your eye on the prize.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; What is our prize? You say, "Oh, God,
[1:38:55] you you you've got a change. You've got
[1:38:57] a there's a possibility. There is a
[1:39:00] possibility that I can actually
[1:39:02] experience this change. There's a
[1:39:04] possibility that I will see the
[1:39:06] resurrected ones. There's a possibility.
[1:39:08] To me, that's everything.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; To me, that's everything in life.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; We can live. We can work you boys, you
[1:39:20] young ladies. We can, you know, we can
[1:39:22] have our homes and get married and all
[1:39:24] of these things and and and that can
[1:39:27] occupy us and we can just think, oh, if
[1:39:30] this could only happen or that could
[1:39:31] only happen. Let me tell you something
[1:39:33] from someone who's got some years gone.
[1:39:38] It'll go by just like that.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And you will remember these words.
[1:39:42] You'll find yourself at the other end of
[1:39:44] the spectrum looking around and saying,
[1:39:49] "Well, that's gone by fast."
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; What's the next 10 years like?
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Just like the last 10.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; That's what it's like.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; The next 10 is just like the last 10.
[1:40:06] Unless you say, "Here,
[1:40:08] I'm going to I'm I'm going to change
[1:40:12] I'm here in this meeting and I am
[1:40:14] preaching that we will observe the
[1:40:19] signs.
[1:40:21] I'll give you two signs.
[1:40:25] the sign of Messiah
[1:40:29] and the prophet said that you've seen it
[1:40:33] and the sign of the resurrection
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; and we have seen that
[1:40:39] this prophet you perhaps didn't
[1:40:41] understand this prophet went into the
[1:40:43] dooms
[1:40:45] and into the gloom
[1:40:48] of this dark Leodysian age
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; and and came out to the public and said,
[1:40:55] "He's not there.
[1:40:58] He's not in that. He's not in the world
[1:41:00] council of churches. He's not in the
[1:41:03] great denominational institutions. He's
[1:41:06] not in their schools. It's fine. He's
[1:41:09] not in that hospital system. It's fine
[1:41:12] that they're there for that." And he and
[1:41:14] he can speak so nicely. And he speaks
[1:41:16] about the doctors so so caring and so
[1:41:20] compassionate and speaks about them in
[1:41:22] such a lovely way. But that's not the
[1:41:25] anchor and that's not where the believer
[1:41:29] has his his goal and his prize fixed.
[1:41:33] Friends,
[1:41:34] we must gather here to become enthused
[1:41:38] and to become excited about this purpose
[1:41:42] and this goal.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And I I I I think of the the disciples
[1:41:54] even in their dismal despair
[1:41:58] with nowhere to turn
[1:42:00] and talking to
[1:42:04] hello church
[1:42:06] talking directly to Jesus Christ in
[1:42:08] another form
[1:42:11] I I I I don't want to be misunderstood
[1:42:13] I'm just staggering around because I
[1:42:16] don't want to be misunderstood
[1:42:18] but brother Brandham said so many times
[1:42:22] you'll never be closer to God than where
[1:42:26] you're standing right now.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And you have to understand he's not
[1:42:32] saying that he's God. He's not even
[1:42:34] saying he's the Messiah. But that which
[1:42:38] he that person that was with him, that
[1:42:41] one he was revealing was the Messiah.
[1:42:44] That one that's why he could say, "You
[1:42:46] hear my voice, but it's not me
[1:42:48] speaking." You've got to hear those
[1:42:50] things. You've got to you've you must
[1:42:52] receive those things and believe those
[1:42:54] things. That that that that was not for
[1:42:58] him. That was for us.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; That was for you and for me. That's him
[1:43:03] walking he walking with me. And
[1:43:06] yesterday I I just found tears.
[1:43:09] Uh not that that's important, but they
[1:43:12] were going out of my eyes and down my
[1:43:15] face. I thought if I had only if I could
[1:43:19] only have known. But now I want to
[1:43:22] stress it to the people that I love and
[1:43:27] the people that I know love this
[1:43:30] message. I want to stress it.
[1:43:33] Brother Bisll may not be here forever to
[1:43:36] tell you that, but I want to stress that
[1:43:39] you have this opportunity. This is what
[1:43:41] you've been called to. And I can tell
[1:43:44] you one thing with full assurance. You
[1:43:47] live for this message. You live your
[1:43:49] life for others. And you will not have
[1:43:52] anything to be concerned about. God will
[1:43:54] be in control of your life. God will
[1:43:57] make the decisions for you. Even when
[1:43:59] you're trying to do the very best you
[1:44:01] can, you'll find that God works in the
[1:44:04] background. You and you'll turn around.
[1:44:07] You'll turn around as I have done many
[1:44:08] times. And I've spent many hours with my
[1:44:11] wife now saying we didn't realize that
[1:44:14] this is the way it was going to be. We
[1:44:16] didn't realize that God was in control
[1:44:18] here. We were worrying and concerned
[1:44:20] about certain things, but ultimately God
[1:44:23] is in control.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; life may not be easy. Life is harder for
[1:44:35] some than for others.
[1:44:39] Some have
[1:44:40] life is is hard for them and we have
[1:44:43] compassion for that. But on the other
[1:44:46] hand,
[1:44:48] some through the waters and some through
[1:44:50] the flood.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But all through the blood.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; We don't know. And if life is not easy
[1:45:00] for you,
[1:45:02] the
[1:45:04] the best way, the clearest way that I
[1:45:06] can say it for you is if you keep your
[1:45:09] eyes on him,
[1:45:12] your problems will be painless.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I was glad that somebody
[1:45:26] ran before me.
[1:45:29] I'm glad, friends, that someone ran
[1:45:32] before me. I'm glad I'm certainly glad
[1:45:35] that there was someone who went to the
[1:45:38] tomb back there at the prophecy, went to
[1:45:40] the tomb, found he wasn't there. I'm
[1:45:43] glad that that resurrection took place.
[1:45:45] I'm glad he's alive. I'm glad that the
[1:45:48] disciples even they could find out and
[1:45:50] then they became apostles
[1:45:53] mighty apostles being told by the ladies
[1:45:58] that he's not there and then going there
[1:46:01] themselves finding he's not there.
[1:46:10] You know, one of my concerns,
[1:46:15] it's a very real concern,
[1:46:19] and if if this was even my last service,
[1:46:22] I would want to say this.
[1:46:25] Don't let this message
[1:46:28] and this church ever become just a place
[1:46:33] where we come and have a church on
[1:46:36] Sunday and a church on Wednesday and
[1:46:40] that we just do then you're just
[1:46:41] building a wall. You're just laying
[1:46:44] bricks in a straight line. Say I am
[1:46:48] there with full expectation that the
[1:46:51] Holy Spirit is going to continue the
[1:46:54] change in my life and not not just
[1:46:57] something fictitious or something
[1:46:59] imaginary but a reality a real change.
[1:47:02] I'm going to be in a position and and
[1:47:05] I'm awaiting a sweep. I'm awaiting I I'm
[1:47:10] I'm I'm one here to be a fulfillment of
[1:47:13] that prophecy. I'm here. It was laid out
[1:47:16] as a prophecy. A prophet came and
[1:47:19] identified that scripture and he said to
[1:47:21] me, "This is a prophecy and I am here to
[1:47:24] be a fulfillment of that prophecy."
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be worthwhile? That's what
[1:47:30] life is worthwhile. And then when you
[1:47:33] come to the end or you or or years down
[1:47:35] the road, you turn around, if it hasn't
[1:47:37] happened, that's fine. My father's
[1:47:40] eternal. Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; He could do it in my lifetime if he
[1:47:44] wished to. If he didn't do it in my
[1:47:46] lifetime, that's his business.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] and the events made clear.
[1:48:12] He said, "Let's go back a few minutes
[1:48:14] and let's listen to the words quoted
[1:48:16] from himself."
[1:48:18] Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:48:22] was quoting, "Hello, congregation.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Say what you wish to say after this
[1:48:28] service." But Jesus kept quoting the
[1:48:31] scripture to them. Quoting the scripture
[1:48:34] to them, giving them examples
[1:48:38] until they could see who it was that was
[1:48:41] talking.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:43] I pray before God that across this
[1:48:46] pulpit and in your private life you'll
[1:48:49] hear him talking to you,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; giving scripture to you. That's my
[1:48:54] that's my responsibility to point out
[1:48:58] and I'm I'm steering you to Luke the
[1:49:00] 24th chapter and Mark's 16th chapter
[1:49:04] where he was changing form and he is
[1:49:08] changing form and he's here to change
[1:49:11] your form. You're not going to remain
[1:49:15] just in this human form in this weekend
[1:49:19] destined. There isn't a man or woman
[1:49:21] here. There isn't a child here. But what
[1:49:23] they're going at it getting older at a
[1:49:26] very fast pace. But we are not destined
[1:49:29] to merely get older according to the
[1:49:32] word of God. We're destined for eternal
[1:49:35] life, which we are possessors of that
[1:49:38] life. Even at this time, we now possess
[1:49:42] it. But God wants to reveal to us what's
[1:49:46] in us. And Jesus said, Jesus said, "The
[1:49:50] world will see me no more." But you
[1:49:53] shall see me
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; because I'll be in you.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said some shocking
[1:50:00] things. He spoke about the Islam and the
[1:50:02] Muhammad Muhammad belief. And he said uh
[1:50:07] I've been to the I've been to Muhammad's
[1:50:09] tomb. He said they changed the horses.
[1:50:12] The horse guards are every four hours
[1:50:15] waiting for him to resurrect. He said
[1:50:18] our Lord's tomb is empty.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Muhammad is still there. But our Lord's
[1:50:22] tomb is empty. But they said they they
[1:50:26] can make any claim the Christian can
[1:50:28] make. The Christian says, "Well, he's
[1:50:30] risen." And they said, "Well, prove it."
[1:50:32] Well, he lives in our heart. They said
[1:50:34] they they can say the same thing. He
[1:50:36] lives in our heart. But the prophet took
[1:50:39] another step.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Your prophet
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; who gave these examples who had did
[1:50:45] everything to direct you to this word.
[1:50:47] He took another step. And he he goes
[1:50:50] beyond
[1:50:53] show us the father.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Would you like to see the father?
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; And I feel it's a great responsibility
[1:51:00] upon the ministry upon us as ministers
[1:51:04] to bring you to a place where somehow
[1:51:07] faith can reach out. I feel that if if
[1:51:10] we fail that perhaps I fail but where
[1:51:13] faith can reach out because if I believe
[1:51:17] everything that has been spoken I have
[1:51:19] to believe that the angels are here I
[1:51:22] have to believe that Jesus Christ is
[1:51:24] resurrected and is here and I believe
[1:51:26] he's walking with us and he's trying to
[1:51:29] tell us not because I'm speaking but
[1:51:31] he's trying to say something extra into
[1:51:33] your heart and tell you that I am here.
[1:51:36] It's me. It's me as the author, the
[1:51:39] creator of heavens and earth, the giver
[1:51:42] of every good gift. It's me that's here.
[1:51:44] You're not to be concerned and worried
[1:51:46] about every little thing. Just listen to
[1:51:49] my voice. Listen to the guidance that
[1:51:51] he'll speak to your own heart. Not
[1:51:53] necessarily what the preacher will say,
[1:51:55] but what he speaks to your own heart.
[1:51:57] That you'll live by that. You'll live by
[1:51:59] that conviction. You'll live by that
[1:52:02] consecration. I can tell you one thing.
[1:52:04] We need a baptism of dedication, a
[1:52:07] baptism of consecration.
[1:52:10] Hallelujah. We need that this message
[1:52:12] will take a hold of us and and and
[1:52:15] literally consume everything else that's
[1:52:17] around us until the world and all the
[1:52:21] education and all the money and all the
[1:52:24] burdens and all the pressures just
[1:52:26] become tinkling tinsel that have become
[1:52:29] meaningless things. It just must not
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; obscure
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; our vision
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; and occupy us.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; I see gifted
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; young men, gifted, talented,
[1:52:48] and I don't apologize to say be a giver.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Give your life.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Don't be one that just receives what can
[1:52:58] I get out of it. You say, "What can I
[1:53:00] give? What can I do for this word? What
[1:53:04] can I do for this Christ?" When you talk
[1:53:06] about the message, I'm talking about a
[1:53:08] person. What can I do for him?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; What can I do for this glorious word?
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to embarrass
[1:53:21] anyone.
[1:53:28] I said this once to brother Milo.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; We would go to Yugoslavia and and excuse
[1:53:36] me, brother Mila, but you'd get, you
[1:53:38] know, quite excited and enthused. You're
[1:53:42] back home and with your people and you
[1:53:44] get emotionally involved and getting the
[1:53:47] word to them is such a joy.
[1:53:51] And I said, "My forefathers come from
[1:53:55] Ukraine.
[1:53:58] I've been to India.
[1:54:01] I've been to South Africa. I've been to
[1:54:02] Malawi. I've been to Zimbabwe.
[1:54:05] I've been to Congo.
[1:54:08] I've been to all these places about 45
[1:54:11] countries. And I went for years and
[1:54:13] years and never got to the Ukraine.
[1:54:15] Never even got where my forefathers
[1:54:17] were. But the burden was when I looked
[1:54:20] into their eyes and I I looked into the
[1:54:23] eyes of some of the brothers from Africa
[1:54:25] and they said uh uh oh if we could only
[1:54:29] have the message in our language
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and I I just could not stand to look
[1:54:35] there. I came back. I broke down. I
[1:54:38] spoke to people such as sister Glattis
[1:54:40] Dao who became who who even built the
[1:54:44] building in Africa and rather in India
[1:54:47] for the printing of the message uh that
[1:54:50] it could be printed and we start
[1:54:51] printing in in one in in one language
[1:54:54] and then another language and then they
[1:54:56] said 2,000's not enough so we put it to
[1:54:59] 5,000 then we need 7,000 in this
[1:55:02] language and another language and t
[1:55:04] Tamil and Telugu and and all of these
[1:55:07] different languages. meages and God just
[1:55:09] kept pouring in, pouring in. And I sat
[1:55:12] back. I said, "God loves this message.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; God loves it.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; He's paying the bills.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Is there no end to it?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; This thing is unstoppable.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; And friends, when you say, "Man, I'm
[1:55:30] burdened for I'm burdened for it. I'm
[1:55:32] burdened in such a way. I wonder that
[1:55:34] when I can't do it, who's going to pick
[1:55:36] up the mantle? Who's going to pick it up
[1:55:39] and say, "We're going to do something."
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know what, but even if I get
[1:55:44] even if I reach one, even if I'm able to
[1:55:46] testify to one, even if I'm able, some
[1:55:49] of you here can
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; can translate.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I wish I could.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I wish I could do it. I would certainly
[1:56:00] do it.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] I would certainly see that there were I
[1:56:08] I'd do as brother Murphy did.
[1:56:11] Brother Timothy Timothy Ma when he first
[1:56:15] came
[1:56:17] and he and it was burning out our our
[1:56:19] printing our photocopier in the office.
[1:56:22] I don't hardly know him. What are you
[1:56:25] doing here? I'm I'm printing out a
[1:56:27] message. I'm printing out uh uh I'm
[1:56:31] printing out choosing of a bride. I'm
[1:56:33] printing it out both in Vietnamese and
[1:56:34] in English at the same time because they
[1:56:37] love to see that there's English there.
[1:56:39] And I just said, "God bless you. Burn a
[1:56:41] thing out. I don't care." Hallelujah.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Burn it out.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm preaching like this because
[1:56:48] I'm a preacher." Not a chance.
[1:56:51] Not a chance.
[1:56:53] I said, "Even if if somehow God doesn't
[1:56:57] pay the bills, God will provide another
[1:56:59] way."
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; God will provide a way. You think we
[1:57:05] talk about flowery things. Oh, the He
[1:57:08] owns a cattle on a thousand hills. Yes,
[1:57:11] he does. But he also gave me a pair of
[1:57:13] hands that I can work. He gave me a
[1:57:15] brain that I can think about. We don't
[1:57:17] have to stumble along in life.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:22] Hallelujah.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God. He's the source
[1:57:26] of all wisdom.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I might as well say it the way it is.
[1:57:39] I won't say this again.
[1:57:43] You can ask Sister Biscll after the
[1:57:45] meeting if this is correct.
[1:57:48] I'm trying to lay importance. I'm trying
[1:57:50] to lay glory upon him.
[1:57:54] I'm trying to tell you
[1:57:58] to perhaps you need to forget
[1:58:01] what your ambitions are
[1:58:04] and let them at least
[1:58:07] take a different place in your life.
[1:58:10] Say, "My first ambition is in life. I
[1:58:15] need to provide for my family." If
[1:58:17] you're a man, I need to care for my
[1:58:20] children. If you're a woman, uh, young
[1:58:22] ladies,
[1:58:26] you can kick me out of here after this.
[1:58:28] You won't have to won't have any
[1:58:30] trouble.
[1:58:32] But I would learn how to be a mother.
[1:58:36] I'd learn how to s sew clothes.
[1:58:39] I'd learn how to feed people.
[1:58:42] I'd learn how to care for people.
[1:58:46] And if you're worried about caring for
[1:58:48] somebody,
[1:58:50] maybe some of us seniors might need a
[1:58:52] hand
[1:58:55] and doing things for others.
[1:58:58] And you young men,
[1:59:01] you got good strong body. Don't just
[1:59:03] think exercising your brain. exercise
[1:59:06] your your
[1:59:09] physique and your muscle and your living
[1:59:12] and and and and and
[1:59:15] count on doing something
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; for the church
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; for the people of God.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Count on doing something.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; I actually know people and their entire
[1:59:27] vision and the entire mission is to
[1:59:30] support the work of God. Amen.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; We we're blasted on uh we're blasted on
[1:59:35] the internet. I pray God forgive the
[1:59:37] poor person,
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; a woman or whoever it is. God forgive
[1:59:41] them.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; If they only knew the truth.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Have you people ever been Have you ever
[1:59:48] been overladen or burdened down
[1:59:51] financially? Have has it ever happened?
[1:59:54] Not in the 35 or 38 years of this church
[1:59:58] have we ever done that because we don't
[2:00:00] believe in it. Have we ever tried to
[2:00:02] build the people for money? Never have
[2:00:05] tried to do that.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; In fact is when I was going to the
[2:00:11] native Indian people, they didn't hardly
[2:00:13] have enough food to feed my family. I'm
[2:00:16] telling you this because I'm telling you
[2:00:17] the truth.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you personal experience.
[2:00:23] I'm driving home from a Sunday service
[2:00:26] in my car on Lamson Road in Victoria
[2:00:33] and I actually jerk the car over and
[2:00:35] pull off to the side of the road. The
[2:00:36] Holy Spirit spoke in such clear tones.
[2:00:43] We didn't have anything.
[2:00:45] We're barely making barely barely
[2:00:49] living.
[2:00:50] And I said,
[2:00:54] "We're coming into some money. We're
[2:00:57] coming into a lot of money."
[2:01:00] I said, "And it has nothing to do with
[2:01:02] your father."
[2:01:04] Isn't that what I said, dear
[2:01:06] Sister Bisll?
[2:01:08] Is that what I said?
[2:01:11] I said, "I don't know how. I don't know
[2:01:13] anything more about it." And we drove
[2:01:15] away and never discussed it after that.
[2:01:20] God gave me a job.
[2:01:22] God gave me a job. One that maybe you
[2:01:26] might not even like is in the basement
[2:01:29] of an old rotten building. And when I
[2:01:32] went home at night, I couldn't feel my
[2:01:34] legs from my knees down. I'm not telling
[2:01:36] you a story. I'm telling you something
[2:01:38] that happened.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you about life.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; I'm the minister here today. I'm I'm
[2:01:44] telling you about reality. And I'm
[2:01:46] telling you about God. God knew I
[2:01:48] couldn't feel my legs. God knew that I
[2:01:50] got congestion and I'd come home and I
[2:01:53] couldn't hardly I after 30 days I quit.
[2:01:56] And I go to the man said, "I'm
[2:01:58] quitting." He said, "Well, I'd hope you
[2:02:00] wouldn't we kind of like what you're
[2:02:01] doing a British man." And I said, "I I
[2:02:05] can't I can't work in this basement any
[2:02:07] longer." I What? Why? What? What is I
[2:02:10] doing? Trying to get rich? You got to be
[2:02:13] kidding. I'm trying to feed my family.
[2:02:17] trying to feed my daughters who are
[2:02:19] sitting here. That's what I was trying
[2:02:21] to do. Why? Because that's what the word
[2:02:23] of God says.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; That's my responsibility. I wasn't
[2:02:28] trying to become rich. I was trying to
[2:02:30] feed my family.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; And I was barely doing that.
[2:02:38] I did janitor work.
[2:02:42] The minister had a janitor business. I
[2:02:45] washed people's floors. I washed their
[2:02:48] bathrooms. I washed their windows.
[2:02:51] That's this man. These two hands did
[2:02:53] that. I've never told you that before.
[2:02:59] And a man come down the stairs into that
[2:03:01] place before I got to leave.
[2:03:07] And he's looking around and I was just
[2:03:08] whistling and and the Holy Spirit said
[2:03:11] to me, "That's Mr. Roberts.
[2:03:15] I'd never seen him in my life. That's
[2:03:18] the president of the company. And after
[2:03:20] a few minutes, I walked over to him.
[2:03:24] I said, "Can I help you, sir?" He said,
[2:03:26] "I guess you don't know who I am." I
[2:03:28] said, "I think you're Mr. Roberts." He
[2:03:30] said, "That's exactly right." He said,
[2:03:32] "We're having a meeting, a staff
[2:03:34] meeting, and I'm going to cut this
[2:03:36] relatively short. We're having a staff
[2:03:39] meeting at 5:00 upstairs in the office.
[2:03:42] like you to be there. I understand
[2:03:43] you're doing a good job. I said, "Well,
[2:03:45] if the people are happy, that's fine."
[2:03:48] Most of the people in that company
[2:03:49] didn't even know my name. I was the kid
[2:03:51] downstairs. I was 25 or 26 years old. I
[2:03:55] was the kid downstairs. They didn't know
[2:03:57] my name. One or two did.
[2:04:00] I went up to the office. They said,
[2:04:02] "We're bidding on this big thing.
[2:04:06] Bidding on this huge liquidation.
[2:04:09] It was so large it took five months to
[2:04:11] sell out. Five months.
[2:04:14] It happened to be very, very, very
[2:04:16] expensive clothing.
[2:04:19] My wife's dad taught me something about
[2:04:21] cloth and clothing. And I, you know
[2:04:24] what?
[2:04:26] You talk about God. I was the only one
[2:04:28] that knew anything about clothing.
[2:04:31] In the first week, I was made manager of
[2:04:33] the sale.
[2:04:37] And the first second day, the president
[2:04:39] walked over and slipped $100 in my
[2:04:42] pocket.
[2:04:44] And the next day, he came over and
[2:04:45] slipped another hundred in my pocket.
[2:04:48] Was that a lot of money? Well, it was
[2:04:50] quite a bit of money then, but that
[2:04:51] wasn't what God was saying. And I I
[2:04:54] forgot all about that. I wasn't paying
[2:04:56] any attention to it. Just working hard,
[2:04:58] working long, doing all I can because I
[2:05:01] have a family and because I want to go
[2:05:03] to the native Indians and I always was
[2:05:05] supporting myself. I got one offering
[2:05:07] from someone up in northern Canada for
[2:05:10] $5. They sent me $5. That was it. I
[2:05:14] pastored the church for a long time and
[2:05:16] they sent me $5.
[2:05:20] That's just the way it was. That was
[2:05:22] life.
[2:05:26] All I can tell you, within two weeks, I
[2:05:30] was made manager of this entire sale and
[2:05:32] I was there five months selling it out
[2:05:34] in Vancouver. in here. I can take you to
[2:05:36] 744 Richard Street where I sold it out
[2:05:39] and we had robberies and we had
[2:05:41] everything else happen and so on. But I
[2:05:44] had the I had the attorney of that
[2:05:46] company say to me, "Our company made
[2:05:48] more money on this deal than we made
[2:05:51] since we were since we were uh since we
[2:05:54] were in a corporation in 1902
[2:05:59] to that time 1961."
[2:06:03] And I had I had a I had made a con
[2:06:07] contact
[2:06:08] I should say brother Brandham made a
[2:06:10] contact with me in 1961.
[2:06:14] I have Billy Paul's letter in my study.
[2:06:18] Incidentally, I'm going to invite some
[2:06:20] of you young men to my home.
[2:06:25] I'm going to show you some of these
[2:06:26] things.
[2:06:32] I want you to see them.
[2:06:37] And Billy Paul, they they gotten my
[2:06:39] letter
[2:06:41] which I wrote a year and a half before.
[2:06:45] Just a few days ago, I had East Indian
[2:06:47] man in my home. He's 30.
[2:06:52] He said to me, "He's very, very
[2:06:53] successful here in this area.
[2:06:56] 30 years old, handsome,
[2:06:58] very fine.
[2:07:01] Jesus looked on a young man and loved
[2:07:03] him. I looked on this young man, I
[2:07:05] thought, what a fine young man you are.
[2:07:10] He said,
[2:07:12] I have an appointment, but Mr. Biscali
[2:07:14] said, "Can you please?" He said, "I I
[2:07:16] see how you handle things, how you
[2:07:18] conduct things. Can you please give me
[2:07:20] some words of wisdom?"
[2:07:23] I said, "Well,
[2:07:26] it'll be
[2:07:28] I really need more time than this." And
[2:07:31] I looked around. There's a little
[2:07:32] picture
[2:07:34] of Brother Brandham holding his Bible.
[2:07:37] Little picture of his home where he was
[2:07:39] born,
[2:07:41] holding his Bible. And I've shown it to
[2:07:44] a lot of people. I've said he is he
[2:07:47] looks just like that when he's under
[2:07:49] vision, under heavy anointing. His eyes
[2:07:53] are deep set
[2:07:55] and it was written by the full gospel
[2:07:57] businessman and I grabbed that picture
[2:08:00] behind glass and I held it up to this
[2:08:03] young man and I took it out which I
[2:08:07] don't often do and I took it out from
[2:08:09] the glass and it's written on there to
[2:08:12] brother Eddie. And as I open up the
[2:08:16] cover
[2:08:17] first I held it to him. I said, ' Do you
[2:08:20] see this? I said, ' Do you see this
[2:08:22] emblem up here? The full gospel
[2:08:25] Christian businessmen. I said, these are
[2:08:28] the elite wealthy businessmen in
[2:08:32] America. I said, I want you to see what
[2:08:35] they said. And I opened it up and it has
[2:08:39] an arrow. Brother Bram drew an arrow
[2:08:41] down and on the bottom it says this.
[2:08:45] By the editor, are you listening?
[2:08:48] In Bible days, there were prophets and
[2:08:51] seers of God, but none of them were
[2:08:55] greater than that of William Brham, who
[2:08:58] in the name of who is a prophet and seer
[2:09:00] of God and who in the name of Jesus has
[2:09:03] raised the dead. And I said, you read it
[2:09:06] and looked at it and read it. My said,
[2:09:10] raise the dead. I said, that's right.
[2:09:13] And doctor certificates to show that
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; they were raised from the dead. I said,
[2:09:18] "I met this man."
[2:09:21] And I told him how I wrote the letter.
[2:09:23] And a year and a half later, I resigned
[2:09:26] the church and I moved down here
[2:09:30] to a place I never knew and went up and
[2:09:33] going to the native Indians. And I said,
[2:09:35] "Three weeks after I moved here, I got a
[2:09:37] letter from him, from Billy Paul. Then I
[2:09:41] got a a phone call. Then I got a letter
[2:09:44] and I said he probably gets a 100,000
[2:09:46] letters a month and I said when I was
[2:09:49] writing it I said he'll never find this.
[2:09:53] And this young East Indian man said to
[2:09:56] me
[2:09:57] and I said I got a phone call from him.
[2:10:00] He said that was God.
[2:10:03] And I just ignored what he said and I
[2:10:06] carried on and he stopped again and he
[2:10:09] said that was God that he answered your
[2:10:13] letter.
[2:10:14] And I can tell you friends, he was
[2:10:16] smitten. Those were more than 10 words
[2:10:19] or a few words of wisdom that I could
[2:10:21] give him. He realized
[2:10:25] as he looked at that picture and read
[2:10:27] that little phrase, a man who's never
[2:10:30] ever heard of the message could say that
[2:10:33] was God.
[2:10:35] I hope to get to speak to him a little
[2:10:38] bit further.
[2:10:40] But I'll tell you what, congregation,
[2:10:43] you belong here to Bible way, you come
[2:10:45] here to church, I want to tell you
[2:10:47] something. This was founded by that God.
[2:10:52] This isn't something that some man
[2:10:54] dreamed up.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; This isn't something that some man had
[2:10:57] to pump the people or or try to, you
[2:11:01] know, get numbers or whatever more in
[2:11:04] spite of the enemy who tried to tear it
[2:11:05] to pieces. I said, "Oh, God, you're the
[2:11:08] preserver.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; You preserved us.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; You preserved my life. You preserved our
[2:11:14] home. You preserved this congregation.
[2:11:17] You preserved your lives. And all I say
[2:11:19] to you friends, the success is not being
[2:11:22] associated with the church or associated
[2:11:24] with the message. The success is what
[2:11:27] you do with your life in connection with
[2:11:30] his his revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, this message
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; I'll stop talking about myself just now.
[2:11:40] I want to talk about brother Dioa just
[2:11:43] for a moment. Have we got a few minutes?
[2:11:48] Brother Dioa, they they told me that
[2:11:50] when I was I was there, they said that
[2:11:53] uh Congo is the third poorest country on
[2:11:57] the globe and it has been first most
[2:12:01] poverty in Congo. And I I didn't know
[2:12:06] all I could see was presses running
[2:12:10] and the message being printed. And I
[2:12:13] said, "How many how many messages that
[2:12:16] year?" They printed 10.2
[2:12:18] million.
[2:12:21] I said, "Where do you get your finance?
[2:12:23] Where do you Is it from the diamond
[2:12:25] industry or where I I'm trying to put
[2:12:27] things together?" "No, no, no." He said,
[2:12:30] "Even the children in Sunday school,
[2:12:33] give a give a few cents to print a
[2:12:36] message book." That was that man's
[2:12:38] answer. That that was printing 10.2 2
[2:12:42] million messages sending it to 57
[2:12:46] nations, French-speaking nations across
[2:12:49] across the earth. Brother Dio had never
[2:12:52] asked us for a penny.
[2:12:56] We wanted to help. We wanted to do
[2:12:59] something. He never asked for a penny. I
[2:13:02] saw here's a man. He just loves this
[2:13:05] message. You know what the difference
[2:13:07] is, friends? It comes down to my service
[2:13:10] today. come and see.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; He walked with him till he saw him.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; And you can do that. I challenge you in
[2:13:20] the name of Jesus Christ. You walk with
[2:13:22] the author of this message. You walk
[2:13:25] with the author and the Bible will
[2:13:28] become an open book to you.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You walk with him and then you'll see
[2:13:34] him and you'll feel his heartbeat. And
[2:13:38] there's nothing on earth that can
[2:13:39] replace that. nothing on earth.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you and thank you for bearing
[2:13:46] with me.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:13:55] Our Lord Jesus,
[2:13:57] my last words are
[2:14:00] to these people
[2:14:02] that there's nothing that can take their
[2:14:04] place.
[2:14:08] And I want to say to you, Lord Jesus, in
[2:14:10] front of this group of people,
[2:14:14] not so much the words that I felt to
[2:14:17] speak,
[2:14:19] but to convey
[2:14:22] the presence somehow, oh God,
[2:14:25] it can't be duplicated.
[2:14:27] I wouldn't try to generate that. But
[2:14:31] your presence and I hear your I hear
[2:14:33] your messenger say, I just try to yield.
[2:14:37] I just try to surrender myself and I
[2:14:40] say, "Oh God, help us to find that same
[2:14:43] channel. Help us. Help me, Lord, to just
[2:14:47] surrender myself. Help me, oh God, just
[2:14:50] to yield." And Father, I pray for a
[2:14:54] clear sight. I pray for the people, this
[2:14:58] people, and those that are perhaps
[2:15:00] streaming the service. Lord, let them
[2:15:04] not only come, but let them see.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Let them have a clear vision of who it
[2:15:09] is that we're following.
[2:15:12] Oh God, for you're the one who has said,
[2:15:16] "As I live, so shall you live. Behold, I
[2:15:20] live, you shall live also." And your
[2:15:24] messenger said, speaking to his wife,
[2:15:26] "Oh God, we did not choose this. You
[2:15:30] brought it our way. We have not chosen.
[2:15:33] You found each one that is here sitting
[2:15:36] in the pews today. You found them
[2:15:40] wherever they are. Whatever state they
[2:15:42] were in, whatever country they were in,
[2:15:45] you found them. Some are here who have
[2:15:48] suffered atrocities, who have suffered
[2:15:51] such poverty, which have suffered great
[2:15:54] difficulty. You saw them, Lord. You did
[2:15:57] not keep us and hide us from all of
[2:16:00] those things. You've not promised us
[2:16:02] that we would have a necessarily an easy
[2:16:04] way, but you protected them. Oh God, in
[2:16:08] the name of Jesus Christ, please glorify
[2:16:11] yourself. Take these lives, whatever
[2:16:14] there is left of it. Oh God, use it for
[2:16:17] your glory. Oh God, let the Holy Spirit
[2:16:21] challenge someone else. Oh father, take
[2:16:24] these young men I see here sitting here
[2:16:28] looking earnestly. Father, take them and
[2:16:30] let the Holy Spirit take something of
[2:16:33] this service and challenge their lives.
[2:16:36] Oh God, challenge them to a life of
[2:16:39] giving. Challenge them to a life of
[2:16:41] labor. Challenge them, oh God, I pray
[2:16:45] that they might say within themselves, I
[2:16:47] have strength. I have ability. I have
[2:16:50] certain things and I will lay it down at
[2:16:52] your feet. Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus,
[2:16:57] I pray you'll take this work in this
[2:16:59] congregation and use it for your glory.
[2:17:03] Use us, oh God. Use us,
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Use me, Jesus. Use us, I pray
[2:17:14] for your glory.
[2:17:17] Amen.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:27] Do you know that song Jesus use me?
[2:17:30] Please Lord, don't refuse me. Surely
[2:17:32] there's a work that I can do.
[2:17:36] How many know the song Jesus use me?
[2:17:38] Yes. Yes. All right, let's stand for a
[2:17:41] second.
[2:17:51] Surely
[2:17:54] there
[2:17:58] can do
[2:18:09] my will to
[2:18:15] be great
[2:18:18] for you.
[2:18:20] Jesus
[2:18:25] hears me.
[2:18:34] There is a word that I can do
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:45] is humble
[2:18:49] my will to crumble
[2:18:54] on the cross
[2:18:58] for you.
[2:19:02] While you're standing,
[2:19:06] I want you to repeat these words. Help
[2:19:08] my will to crumble.
[2:19:10] Will you say that with me? Help my will
[2:19:13] to crumble.
[2:19:16] Do you meant it?
[2:19:18] You mean it?
[2:19:22] Someday on the other side,
[2:19:25] you're going to say, "Brother Ed,
[2:19:28] thank you for that service.
[2:19:31] Thank you for that service. It helped it
[2:19:34] helped me to come to a
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; a focus in my life.
[2:19:41] Help my will to crumble.
[2:19:45] Help my will to crumble.
[2:19:49] Though the cost be great, I'll work for
[2:19:51] you. Oh Jesus.
[2:19:56] [Music]
[2:19:59] Oh Lord.
[2:20:02] [Music]
[2:20:04] Surely
[2:20:06] the word that I can use.
[2:20:15] He
[2:20:17] is humble.
[2:20:20] Have my will to come
[2:20:28] be
[2:20:31] for you.
[2:20:34] We're going to sing it another time or
[2:20:36] two, but I'm praying that this one who
[2:20:40] walked with Cleopus
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:48] will step in right beside you.
[2:20:54] and walk with you out of this building
[2:20:59] and that he'll stay and stick so close
[2:21:05] and that you can pour out all of your
[2:21:08] heart and your grief
[2:21:10] and all of your disappointment
[2:21:13] and say, "This isn't what I expected."
[2:21:17] You just keep talking to him. And the
[2:21:19] prophet of God said this, "If you'll
[2:21:21] talk about him, that's when he appears."
[2:21:26] And I want to encourage you, you talk
[2:21:28] about him.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Don't talk about anything else. Don't
[2:21:32] talk about one another. Don't talk about
[2:21:34] your likes, your dislikes. Talk about
[2:21:36] him
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; and he'll appear.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; He said he will appear.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; That makes life worthwhile.
[2:21:46] That means everything.
[2:21:49] I assure you in the name of Jesus
[2:21:51] Christ, the day will come when you need
[2:21:54] to hold someone's hand. You want to make
[2:21:57] sure it's his. Any hand here on earth is
[2:21:59] going to slip out of your out of your
[2:22:01] grasp and out of your reach. You want to
[2:22:04] make sure that you're able to hold his
[2:22:06] hand. I've held you in life. I've held
[2:22:09] you in trouble. I've held you in the
[2:22:11] good times and in the bad times. I found
[2:22:14] you're always there. and I believe in
[2:22:16] you with all my soul.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Sing it again, please.
[2:22:30] [Music]
[2:22:34] Lord, don't refuse me.
[2:22:40] Great
[2:22:43] work that I can do.
[2:22:52] He will always
[2:22:57] help my will to crumble
[2:23:04] that cause
[2:23:07] the earth for you.
[2:23:12] I thank God for you.
[2:23:15] I thank God for you as a believer, as a
[2:23:18] Christian.
[2:23:20] I thank God for your
[2:23:23] life, each one of you. Brother Darren, I
[2:23:27] thank God for your
[2:23:30] tireless labor.
[2:23:34] I look on this note also the message hub
[2:23:37] update was just one on time to introduce
[2:23:43] to inform the believers in the
[2:23:45] introduction of the last camp service.
[2:23:49] Brother Darren, it was just in time at
[2:23:52] the last camp service that both
[2:23:55] Croatian,
[2:23:58] Serbian,
[2:24:00] and Slovakian languages are added to the
[2:24:03] latest website of messagehub
[2:24:06] application.
[2:24:08] This is a great thing for the believers
[2:24:10] in our country. For the first time, they
[2:24:12] pull a pull a prophet's message out of
[2:24:15] the sky and print it down. Listen
[2:24:18] friends, I'm not just taking up your
[2:24:20] time. I'm saying this is glorious.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; It's right here sitting on a on a pew in
[2:24:27] this congregation just now. Is it
[2:24:30] something unique? Have I ever spoken to
[2:24:31] brother Darren about it? Never have
[2:24:35] between him and God.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; God's a rewarder.
[2:24:40] [Music]
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; So, well, I can't do that. I can't
[2:24:44] either. That doesn't mean I can't do
[2:24:47] something for God.
[2:24:51] It might be humble.
[2:24:54] God bless you.
[2:24:56] God bless you.
[2:24:58] [Music]
[2:25:00] Might say, "I'm weary."
[2:25:03] I said, "But I'm not tired of
[2:25:04] challenging you.
[2:25:10] [Music]
[2:25:30] Maybe I'd like to
[2:25:33] while we sing it once more time. One
[2:25:35] more time.
[2:25:40] Jesus, use me.
[2:25:43] Jesus, use me. I pray for this as a
[2:25:47] congregation
[2:25:49] that Jesus would use you.
[2:25:53] Hallelujah.
[2:25:57] Father, in the name of Jesus, as we come
[2:25:59] to the end of this service, we must
[2:26:02] close because
[2:26:05] Brother Tim, Sister Sarah must make
[2:26:08] their way down to Seattle and others may
[2:26:10] wish to go. But oh God, I pray that
[2:26:15] you'll take these words and take some
[2:26:18] statements and anchor them into the
[2:26:20] hearts of the people that make them make
[2:26:23] the statements unshakable,
[2:26:26] Lord. And perhaps they will find a place
[2:26:28] where they may just even remain if they
[2:26:30] wish to and bow down before you and say,
[2:26:34] "Oh Jesus, Jesus, use me. Whatever
[2:26:39] you'll do, let me use my energy and let
[2:26:42] me use, oh God, what you put into my
[2:26:45] hands and what you've put into my brain,
[2:26:48] help me to use it for your glory. Oh
[2:26:51] God, in this dark time, help me to be a
[2:26:53] light. Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:26:56] Christ, I pray your blessings upon this
[2:27:01] people, upon each individual
[2:27:04] according as their faith and belief is.
[2:27:07] Lord, I pray that as they as they walk
[2:27:09] out of this building,
[2:27:12] when they do, that you will walk with
[2:27:14] them. That they will only have a desire
[2:27:17] for a conversation with you. They will
[2:27:20] speak to you and realize
[2:27:23] that you are a living Christ, the same
[2:27:26] yesterday and today and forever.
[2:27:31] I ask your pe your peace to be upon
[2:27:35] them.
[2:27:36] May they depart
[2:27:39] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:27:44] Oh Jesus.
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:51] Oh Lord, don't resist me.
[2:27:59] the word that I can do.
[2:28:08] He always
[2:28:12] [Music]
[2:28:13] help my will to crumble
[2:28:20] the costly rain
[2:28:24] for you.
[2:28:28] As you stand here, you may
[2:28:31] wonder where where are miracles
[2:28:33] happening.
[2:28:34] I'll tell you as a minister, as a
[2:28:37] pastor, I tell you there's a mighty
[2:28:39] mighty there's been a mighty breath of
[2:28:41] God,
[2:28:43] brother Jean,
[2:28:46] nice to see you.
[2:28:48] I bless you.
[2:28:53] We had a wedding yesterday.
[2:28:56] Brother John Waldner,
[2:28:58] one of you just look up at me. Father
[2:29:01] John, you were sitting here
[2:29:05] some months ago, long time ago, not too
[2:29:08] ter long ago.
[2:29:11] Your face was a glow with the glory of
[2:29:13] God.
[2:29:14] I didn't know who you were.
[2:29:17] [Music]
[2:29:18] And I leaned over so I could get a
[2:29:20] better look at you.
[2:29:24] is what going on in a normal service.
[2:29:28] And I said to myself, I think that is
[2:29:31] Mike and Helen Walder's son.
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:35] And the glory of God was on here. And I
[2:29:37] didn't know what what was happening.
[2:29:41] Found God. But as I said to you
[2:29:44] yesterday, your father was struck by the
[2:29:47] Holy Spirit
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; as he walked in the streets of Vancouver
[2:29:52] in the darkest of time.
[2:29:55] But God smoked his heart. And I see that
[2:29:58] God reignited
[2:30:01] things within the whole family. and
[2:30:06] Sister Helen, Brother Mike, it was a
[2:30:08] blessed time to sit at the table with
[2:30:11] you yesterday. And I was so glad that
[2:30:14] the Holy Spirit had an opportunity to
[2:30:18] somehow get a hold of your son's heart
[2:30:22] and then to stand there. I'm saying
[2:30:25] standing here the lights are out and
[2:30:28] you're shining a light so brother John
[2:30:30] can continue with the wedding uniting
[2:30:33] your your sister to her husband.
[2:30:38] Oh my friends, it's not just an empty
[2:30:41] wedding service. Sister Biscll said to
[2:30:44] me, I see John holding that light there.
[2:30:48] He's not too far from the pullpit. I
[2:30:50] said, that's exactly right. I say God
[2:30:54] anoints men and women. God anoint us for
[2:30:58] our purpose here on earth.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Your purpose is not just to come to
[2:31:02] church next Sunday or next Wednesday.
[2:31:05] It's far beyond that.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, brother
[2:31:09] Matthew Redell. It just came back from
[2:31:12] Ohio from the state fair. They said they
[2:31:15] looked at what was happening at the
[2:31:17] Lynen fair said we want to do that. He
[2:31:20] went there to help them and to organize
[2:31:22] the people. And I say, God bless the
[2:31:25] more people can pour out. Brother
[2:31:28] Murphy's in China and Tom's in the Congo
[2:31:31] and
[2:31:33] Michael is there and brethren are going.
[2:31:36] Brother Tim's been asked someplace and
[2:31:39] all I say is let's burn ourselves out.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. for the kingdom of God.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen?
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Let me burn my life out. Jesus,
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; use me.
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:32:08] Just obey the Lord. You're dismissed in
[2:32:10] Jesus name.
[2:32:12] [Music]
[2:32:19] [Music]
