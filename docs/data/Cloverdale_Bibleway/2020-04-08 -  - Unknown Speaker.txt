TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one day my father he was about 18 at the time and he was plowing a field in Saskatchewan he was plowing behind the horses and the furrow he was walking in the fresh furrow and he doesn't know what happened but it was he said there was like a wind I would say like a forest like I experienced within brother branham's ministry but this force struck him and he fell to his knees you know in the fresh furrow and he threw up his hands to God and he prayed and he cried out he said O God if there is a God I was an altar boy in the church but he cried out o God if there is a God if you ever show me how I can be free from my guilt my sin I'll accept you that very day my father farmed for a short time near his father's farm and it wasn't working out he didn't feel cut out to farm so they moved he and his young wife and young family I was only about 2 years old and they moved up to a small village only about 150 people I think a village called whitefox Saskatchewan and it was there I'll just make this a little more brief but it was there that my father encountered a family with two daughters with two girls he had seen these girls walk across the street a little gravel street in the town and he saw in their faces they'd look just like angels he thought oh my if I could only have what they have so there was a craving in his heart for reality for deliverance from sin and unbelief and so on and he wanted something more than religion of course a lady in the town heard that he could do some carpenter work so she would needed some shelving or cupboards in her kitchen and had him come over and look at what she wanted done when he was in the house he'd noticed there's the two girls and as he was getting ready to go the lady asked him if he had ever been saved and he said well I don't know what that means she said that means you can be free from your sin oh he said if I could only be free from my sin she said well we're having meetings in a home on Sunday if you'd care to come and she and he said I had promised God years ago if I ever could be free from my guilt I would accepted that very day and as I understand the account she just they knelt at two chairs in that kitchen of that home were those two girls were and my father was he got up a totally transformed person he lived for Christ all of his life and he a matter of fact it was then my mother passed away suddenly when I was only six and a half years old I was in grade two at school and very godly man I think he was probably an old farmer but it was very godly man and I was called out of the room and my sister was standing with him and he said that Jesus had taken my mother to heaven and this was this was the beginning and the end of many things it was it's a very very difficult and very sad story my sister and I we went through from one housekeeper to another to another about four different housekeepers and we had time we were alone and my father was working in alfalfa plant cleaning the bags and so on and we would try to make something to eat and go up there and then my father heard of a lot of work that was taking place in Dawson Creek and the building of the Alaskan Highway just prior to that my father had remarried a very fine Christian woman but she was a completely opposite of what my mother my mother was a very very loving mother and not that this one wasn't but we weren't her children and she was very quiet my mother was outgoing and very you know just very outgoing and this woman was an allele and was her name and she was just a very quiet woman so anyhow our life was completely rearranged and my father went over about a thousand miles west to Dawson Creek and up the Alaskan Highway he was there were camps built all over the highway and you have to understand that the Alaskan highway was a war project the Japanese were invading up the Aleutian Islands had already taken over two of the islands and there's even I understand there's documentaries where the Japanese had taken a 280 tu a two island and that was the thrust if they took Alaska and then northern Canada was really not defended and then if they got down to the 48 states it would it would risk Japan was fighting and they had seized much of Asia and now into China as well Singapore and Hong Kong they'd taken all of that and now if they took they were powerful force and if they came down into the 48 states of mainland America so Canada and the United States joined together and the u.s. built the highway and Canada agreed to maintain it forever and then there would be a land route to get heavy equipment tanks and war equipment into Alaska to defendant that's the purpose of the Alaskan Highway and there were tens of thousands of people and contractors and civilians that were involved in that and so my father moved up there and he was at Mile 4:58 he wrote back and communicated with my stepmother to pack everything up and to come out and we arrived in Dawson Creek at the end of May I won't say perhaps the first of May because my sister whose birthday is May the 6th she had her birthday on the train coming from Edmonton - into Dawson Creek and while we were there this has all happened and you know after my mother passed away everything is just in a turmoil everything fell apart and then I found myself I was sent out to a farm 45 miles out of town across the lady peace River or was a tugboat and a little ferry and two people that I didn't know and my the last string I had on earth was my sister and she was she was taken to a place and because the pastor's wife had been arranged to find a place for the two children and my mother already had work up their last good Highway so I didn't have a mother I didn't have a stepmother I didn't have a sister and one was sent one place one is sent another place and I was shifted I never had a home all my all my youth and growing up yours I never had my own room never had my own bed and I moved 17 times from them until the time I was 15 so it was a it's a difficult time of my life but I've been asked what prepared you for the mission work and for this gospel it was those years I learned that what the wilderness was little did I realized that years later I would have God's prophet up there and he loved that area and it was wilderness and that's all I knew really so my father them in 1949 he felt to move to southern British Columbia and on the way down he would stop because here but he would have such a experience with God and was interested in anything that God was doing in fact is he stopped in the meetings and he had heard that William Branham was going to be in Vernon British Columbia and that is where my contact I began with him in fact is I have a letter I should perhaps just read this letter just a portion of this is my father's account of the meetings in Vernon we found this I think after my father passed away in his Saints and he's writing a minister and he's writing about the news of our beloved brother Branham passing away he said came as a with a shocking surprise to me the loss of him cannot be estimated in words now he is resting in peace but his work is going on and his memory is cherished in the hearts of thousands in the world but he was writing about the meeting in Vernon British Columbia that was my first time [Music] finally he said brother Branham looked at a poorly clad mother with a crippled child in her arms he asked that the way be made for this poor mother to come forward never had I ever seen such a bundle of twisted bones thought this was a totally impossible case brother Branham took the child in his arms and lifted it up for the people to see it there were tears and moans and sobs heard all around the place then he said people do you see how the demons have twisted the whole body of this child and are holding it bound I will not let this child go until all these demons are cast out and the child is perfectly whole with great Authority he commanded the demons to come to come out of Oh in Jesus name after several commands that demons came out and before the eyes of that great crowd the bones were made straight his arms legs neck and back all became straight and the child lifted himself up with a smile on its face you should have heard there's the arena or the arena ring with the praises of thousands as they saw the mighty miracles of God done in the name of Jesus Christ praise God forever now that's my father's unsolicited but he did not know what was happening to me I was just with a series of young fellows that's where I first met Billy Paul when fight and we were in our teens and I was I was caught by this that brother branham was a man had had talked to an angel and an angel had come to him and told him he would take a ministry of healing now I was familiar with Sunday School with church I knew the Bible spoke of angels I had never ever laid eyes on a person who had talked to God in that way he talked to her an angel of God and so I was anxious to see him come out and he came out said good evening people good evening friends and he began to speak and after two or three days I felt I've got to get down where I shouldn't say this I'm I have no interest in being up in the hind the bleachers anymore I didn't have any more interest in just being with the fellows and I got a seat I don't know how to this day I got a seat right on the aisle one chair just closed two or three rolls from the front and in that service I can't tell you what was spoken I can't tell you of anyone else but there was a girl and I would say the girl was probably around 10 to 12 years old she had ringlets down to her shoulders and kind of a full faced girl but her eyes were just white balls and I noticed right up I was that close to the platform I just right in the corner of the eye I see just a little part a little part of the ball the ball of the eye the edge of the eye and the other eye I could see nothing just white and I was as far as I was concerned and and she was totally blind brother branham laid his hands on her and he prayed a prayer and I thought in my young heart I thought well I've heard about you know these things now now here's something I can actually see I can see this and I was anxious to see someone healed because I had so many experiences in churches and so on where people were prayed for for internal sicknesses and you're healed but now is something I could see visibly and brother Branham prayed the second time and she was the same and he prayed the third time fourth time fifth time and he keep looking at her and she was the same brother Brown prays six times and he did something I have never and prayed a prayer I've never heard before and he took and put his arms around her like that and just kind of held her to his bosom and he said Satan an angel from God and delivered this gift to me and told me that nothing would stand before my prayers not even cancer if I could get the people to believe he said the people are here and they believe and I charge you in the name of the Living God to lose her and let her go at that time he did not look at her anymore he just turned her it took her by the shoulders and turned her to the audience and I was just two three rows away I think I was in the third row and I looked up and her eyes were as straight as mine and then he lifted her up like this and the cries of the people I didn't know that my mother and dad or my stepmother and dad were in today where they were in the building but that was my experience this was my father's experience and and I could even see the tears form in her eyes as she looked at the bright lights she wasn't accustomed to the bright lights and she looking at the bright lights and there and then he put her down and and that anchored in my heart at 14 years old you [Applause] [Music] you
