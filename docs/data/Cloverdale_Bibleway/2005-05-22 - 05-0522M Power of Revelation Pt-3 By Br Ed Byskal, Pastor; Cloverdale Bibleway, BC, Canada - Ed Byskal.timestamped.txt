[15:22] Amen. In this presence, we're going to
[15:23] go to prayer. Ask her, brother Joe
[15:26] Walner. Brother Joe, if you would come,
[15:29] open the service in a word of prayer. We
[15:30] have a wonderful testimony from our
[15:32] sister Muriel Hansen. She says, "Thank
[15:34] you to everyone who prayed for my
[15:35] eyesight. I found out last week my
[15:38] vision is almost completely restored and
[15:40] I'm very thankful to God. So I want to
[15:42] thank the Lord for that.
[15:46] And a testimony
[15:49] from brother Ashley says thanks to
[15:51] brothers and sisters for praying when I
[15:53] when in hospital I'm completely well. He
[15:56] wants to thank the Lord for that.
[15:58] Hallelujah. And also brother Frank
[16:00] Fletcher. I wish to thank all the saints
[16:03] for their prayers and wonderful help in
[16:05] getting better from the operation
[16:07] especially the healing hand of the Lord
[16:09] Jesus. May the Lord bless you all who
[16:12] show such love. So he wants a great
[16:15] thanks to you. We have a prayer request
[16:17] here from her sister Yola Navocski.
[16:21] She has written down here, please pray
[16:23] for a sister in Poland who had a heart
[16:26] attack and doctors have given her about
[16:28] four months to live without a bypass.
[16:30] So, I just want to ask that the Lord
[16:32] would move on the scene there. If you
[16:33] have a need on your heart and it just
[16:36] wasn't pinned down, but it's something
[16:38] you just want to hand over to the Lord,
[16:39] just raise your hand as we go to prayer.
[16:41] Brother Joe,
[16:44] [Music]
[16:47] bow our heads and our hearts this
[16:49] morning.
[16:51] Heavenly Father, we bow in your holy
[16:53] presence once more this morning. Father,
[16:55] thanking you for your goodness, grace,
[16:57] and your love and mercy towards us.
[16:59] Father, we thank you for caring for us,
[17:01] Father, watching over us and blessing
[17:02] and giving us the grace and the strength
[17:04] that we need from day to day. Father,
[17:07] Lord, we've come to your house, Father,
[17:09] this morning to offer our worship, our
[17:12] thanksgiving, and our prayers to thee,
[17:13] oh God. Father, we just ask that you
[17:16] will continue to be with us and give us
[17:18] ears to hear this morning, hearts to
[17:20] receive. Father, Lord, what the spirit
[17:22] will speak to us, Father. Oh God, Lord,
[17:25] we're just so thankful that we can come
[17:27] before thee with our petitions. Oh God,
[17:29] Lord, we can ask of thee, Father, and we
[17:31] can expect, Father, and knowing that you
[17:34] promise. You're the one that made the
[17:36] promise, Father. It's not up to us to
[17:38] make it happen, Father, but it's up to
[17:40] us to believe, Father, to have the
[17:43] faith, Father, in the finished work of
[17:45] Calvary, Father, what you have promised
[17:46] and provided for us, dear Lord Jesus.
[17:49] Thinking about the sister, Lord Jesus,
[17:51] in Poland, dear God. Father, Lord, won't
[17:53] you reach out, Father, this morning, oh
[17:55] God. Father, just mend that heart, oh
[17:58] God. And Father, give our sister the joy
[18:00] of the Lord, Father, and the and what
[18:02] you have promised her, Father, help,
[18:04] Father. Dear Lord Jesus, we hold her up
[18:07] this morning and ask you, oh God, that
[18:09] you'll remember her this morning.
[18:10] Father, be with each and every one of
[18:12] us, Father, this morning as we receive
[18:15] your word. Father, bless our precious
[18:16] brother Ed as he comes behind the pulpit
[18:18] tonight. Father, give his body the grace
[18:21] and the strength that he needs, Father,
[18:22] to deliver what's on his heart. Father,
[18:24] I pray that you bless the man of God,
[18:26] Father, this morning, Father, speak
[18:28] through him, Father, that and and that
[18:31] we may pull, Father, upon the word,
[18:32] Father, this morning, and you give and
[18:35] deliver to us what we have need us,
[18:37] Father. We commit your people this
[18:39] morning, Father, into your hand, Father,
[18:40] into your loving care, Father. Bless the
[18:43] song service also. We pray, Father. Lord
[18:46] God, bless your people around the world,
[18:47] those that are listening in, Father.
[18:49] Father, may they may they glean, Father,
[18:52] this morning, Father, what they have
[18:53] need of, Father. Bless them abundantly,
[18:56] Father. Lord, those that can't be here,
[18:58] Father, this morning, Father, be with
[19:00] them also, we pray. Bless those that are
[19:02] sick and afflicted. Thank you for those
[19:04] that you've already healed and the
[19:06] mighty testimonies we've heard, Father.
[19:08] What a blessing it is, Father, to know
[19:10] that you're still here and answer
[19:11] prayers, Father. Lord, we commit this
[19:13] service to you now in your wonderful,
[19:15] lovely name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[19:23] Amen. Thank you, brother Joe. You may

[19:32] into his presence. I trust you feel him
[19:36] amongst us. Amen. If you're visiting
[19:38] with us, I know we've got many visitors.
[19:40] We want to say welcome. Trust you feel
[19:43] at home. Uh brother Jeremy and his
[19:45] family have a song for us as they come
[19:47] and get ready. Why don't we sing number

[21:21] I am what I am because of his grace. For
[21:27] once spotless lamb died in my place. All
[21:31] my sins are forgiven. My past is erased.

[21:52] my sins are forgiven. My past is erased.
[21:58] I am what I am. Because of his grace.
[22:03] [Music]
[22:06] &gt;&gt; I could stand here and tell you what I
[22:10] used to be. I could tell of the change
[22:14] that's come over me. But the Lord shed
[22:17] his grace when he died on the tree. So
[22:22] I'll let the blood Jesus shed before me.
[22:28] I am what I am because of his grace. For
[22:33] once spotless lamb died in my place. All
[22:38] my sins are forgiven. My past is erased.
[22:43] I am what I am because of his grace.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; I was lost and undone. Now I'm found and
[22:55] fulfilled. God traded his son for my
[22:59] shame and my guilt. Now I'm his child.
[23:04] No longer sin slave. His mercy has made
[23:08] me what I am today.
[23:13] I am what I am because of his grace. For
[23:18] once spotless lamb died in my place. All
[23:23] my sins are forgiven. My past is erased.
[23:28] I am what I am because of his grace.

[23:41] wedding gown. Place my life in his
[23:44] hands, and he won't let me down.
[23:48] Faithful and true, without spot or
[23:52] stain. What I am today was always in his
[23:57] plan.
[23:59] I am what I am because of his race. For
[24:05] once spotless lamb died in my place. All
[24:09] my sins are forgiven. My past is erased.
[24:14] I am what I am because of his grace.
[24:21] I am what I am because of his grace. for
[24:26] one spotless land. Died in my place.
[24:32] All my sins are forgiven. My past is
[24:36] erased.
[24:38] I am what I am. I'm safe by grace. I am
[24:44] what I am. My past is erased.
[24:50] I am what I am because of his grace.
[24:57] I'm saved by grace.
[25:01] [Music]
[25:04] [Applause]
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You glad you're saved by grace?
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Ed's going to come now
[25:14] and bring the word, why don't we turn to
[25:16] 55 on the screen. Thy loving kindness is
[25:19] better than life.
[25:22] Thy loving kindness
[25:28] is better than life.
[25:32] Thy loving kindness
[25:37] is better than life.
[25:42] Silence shall praise thee.
[25:46] Thus will I bless thee.
[25:51] I will lift up my hands in thy name.
[26:00] I lift my hands, Lord,
[26:04] unto thy name.
[26:08] Oh, I lift my hands, Lord,
[26:13] unto thy name.
[26:17] My lips shall praise thee.
[26:22] Bless my lie.
[26:26] Oh, I will lift up my hands in thy thy
[26:33] loving kindness.
[26:35] Thy loving kindness
[26:40] is better than life.
[26:44] Thy loving my name
[26:48] is better than life.
[26:52] Oh my lips shall praise
[26:57] the light.
[27:02] I will lift up my hands in thy name.
[27:10] I'll lift my hands all
[27:15] unto thy name.
[27:17] [Music]
[27:19] I'll lift my hands
[27:23] unto thy name.
[27:27] My lips shall praise thee.
[27:36] I will lift up my hands.
[27:42] Let me lift my hand. Oh, I lift my hands
[27:49] up.
[27:54] I lift my hands up
[27:58] until I
[28:00] [Music]
[28:03] shall praise
[28:08] I bless thee.
[28:12] I will lift up my hands in thy name.
[28:19] Why don't we just stand? I lift my
[28:22] hands, Lord,
[28:25] unto thy name.
[28:30] Oh, we're here to glorify you, Lord.
[28:33] We're here to praise you. Unto
[28:37] the name my lips shall praise you.
[28:43] Thus will I bless thee.
[28:48] I will lift up my hands in thy name.
[28:54] [Music]
[28:58] Hallelujah. People lift up their hands
[29:00] and clap and do all kinds of uh outward
[29:04] emotion things for all kinds of things
[29:06] in the world, but they don't have near
[29:09] what we have to be excited about.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Our Lord does things in such strange
[29:19] ways we can't possibly grasp it.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; When he healed the blind man, he said,
[29:27] the disciples said, and we need to say
[29:29] it often, who has sinned,
[29:32] &gt;&gt; this man or his parents?
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Neither. Not this man or his parents,
[29:38] but that God may be glorified. The name
[29:41] of God might be glorified. We have a
[29:43] hard time understanding that. But you
[29:45] may have gone through perhaps some
[29:47] difficulty. You may be going through one
[29:49] right now. You might say, "What's wrong
[29:51] with me?" Isn't that's not the problem.
[29:54] It isn't something that's wrong. In most
[29:56] cases, it isn't something that's wrong.
[29:58] It's that God may be glorified and
[30:00] you're just to hold steadfast, unmovable
[30:03] in the things of in the things that God
[30:06] has taught you, and that will that will
[30:08] serve you well. Amen. Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I have some nice things to share
[30:13] with you, but I will do so perhaps later
[30:16] on in the service. Uh, however, uh, I
[30:20] had some wonderful private time with
[30:22] Rabbi Richmond. And, uh, just a very,
[30:25] very excellent time getting deeper and
[30:29] deeper into the message.
[30:32] Amen. It was really, really fine. I
[30:37] wanted to also let you know that uh
[30:39] Jonathan Bergen and Sister Sarah
[30:41] Dingwall were married yesterday and uh
[30:44] there was just a lovely wedding and a
[30:47] reception afterward. There was probably
[30:50] 35 or 40 people from the church and I
[30:53] would imagine most of them are still up
[30:55] there. Brother Tom is preaching at
[30:58] brother Harold Hillbrand's today and uh
[31:01] quite a number will be in a different
[31:03] churches that are in Edmonton. So,
[31:07] uh, we were we, uh, just had a real
[31:11] happy time. Amen. I felt at the closing
[31:15] of the reception, they asked me to say
[31:17] something more, and I said, "Well, no, I
[31:18] said everything at the service, and they
[31:21] already had it down in the the little uh
[31:26] order of the reception." So, Michael
[31:29] White came and and uh
[31:33] said, "They got you down to say
[31:35] something else." And I said, 'Well, I've
[31:37] said all I'm going to say, really. They
[31:39] said, "Well, they already have you down
[31:40] there." The Lord just kind of touched my
[31:43] heart in the afternoon. We didn't have
[31:45] that much time, maybe a couple of hours
[31:47] at the most. And it was just like a
[31:50] voice within said, "Challenge
[31:54] these young people of Edmonton.
[31:57] challenge them to be something above the
[32:00] normal, something above the average. And
[32:03] I can say that does well. I said, I'd
[32:05] like to say that to everybody in the
[32:07] message. Anybody can be average. Anybody
[32:10] can just be the normal, but to step
[32:13] above the average. And I took the
[32:16] scripture where Apostle Paul said to
[32:18] Timothy, "Let no man despise thy youth,
[32:20] but be thou." I said that wasn't an
[32:23] option that this mighty apostle Paul was
[32:28] saying you be an example.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, he talked about
[32:33] apost apostle Paul and I bear in my body
[32:36] the marks and he said no doubt Timothy
[32:40] looked with admiration on those marks.
[32:43] So Timothy wasn't just taking this
[32:45] lightly when Apostle Paul was saying
[32:48] this was one that Timothy had looked on
[32:50] and admired and saw the marks of the
[32:52] gospel and the marks of the suffering.
[32:54] Then Apostle Paul saying now you be an
[32:56] example. Don't let anybody despise your
[32:59] youth in purity in conversation in be an
[33:04] example to all. I say that's good for
[33:06] every one of us. Be an example so you
[33:08] could turn around and say I'd like
[33:09] somebody you may follow in my footsteps.
[33:12] That's really what a father, a mother,
[33:14] that's what everyone wants to do
[33:16] regardless of what position we have, a
[33:19] brother and sister. And so I felt to
[33:21] challenge Jonathan and Sarah as well. I
[33:23] said, "You have a you have a home that
[33:26] is so a godly place and a place where
[33:31] you can know that you're being an
[33:33] example to others." Amen.
[33:36] You know, the young people, I'll just
[33:37] say to you, there's a lot of lot of fine
[33:39] young people, a lot of lovely young
[33:40] people. There's a lot of, you know,
[33:41] there's a lot of homes, there's a lot of
[33:43] believers, a lot of churches, there's a
[33:45] lot of everything. We haven't got any
[33:47] scarcity.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; But we have a scarcity of that which is
[33:50] just above.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Not many mighty are called. Not many
[33:54] noble, but there are some.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glad that you're here to
[34:00] hear the word today and giving response
[34:02] to it. I'll have you turn in your Bibles
[34:04] to John the 12th chapter and we're going
[34:07] to begin reading at the uh 20 uh 20th
[34:11] verse.
[34:13] Thank you musicians and brother Jason
[34:17] Brother John Andes will be speaking
[34:18] tonight and so we're expecting a good
[34:21] day.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; You'll be praying for me. I was up about
[34:27] 4:30 your time to get here to this
[34:29] service, but I wanted to be here and
[34:30] preach this morning.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Starting with John the 12th chapter
[34:39] and verse 20.
[34:43] And there were certain Greeks among them
[34:46] that came up to the came up to worship
[34:48] at the feast. And the same came
[34:51] therefore to Philillip which was of
[34:53] Bethesda, Bethada rather, of Galilee,
[34:57] and desired him, saying, "Sir, we would
[35:00] see Jesus." Philillip cometh and tellth
[35:04] Andrew, and again Andrew and Philillip,
[35:06] tell Jesus. And Jesus answered them,
[35:09] saying, The hour is come, and the Son of
[35:13] Man should be glorified. Verily, verily,
[35:16] I say unto you, except a corn of wheat
[35:19] fall into the ground and die, it abideth
[35:22] alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth
[35:26] much fruit. He that loveth his life
[35:28] shall lose it. And he that hateth his
[35:31] life in this world shall keep it uh he
[35:34] that hateth his life in this world shall
[35:36] keep it unto life eternal. If any man
[35:39] serve me, let him follow me. And where
[35:42] where I am, there shall also my servant
[35:45] be. If any man serve me, him will my
[35:49] father honor. Now is my soul troubled.
[35:52] And what shall I say? Father, save me
[35:54] from this hour. But for this cause came
[35:58] I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy
[36:01] name. Then came there a voice from
[36:04] heaven, saying, I have both glorified it
[36:08] and will glorify it again. And the
[36:12] people therefore that stood by and heard
[36:14] it said that it thundered. Others said,
[36:18] an angel spake to him. Jesus answered
[36:22] and said, "This voice came not because
[36:25] of me, but for your sakes. Now is the
[36:29] judgment of the world of this world. Now
[36:33] shall the prince of this world be cast
[36:36] out and I if I be lifted up from the
[36:39] earth will draw all men unto me.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; With our heads bowed a moment in prayer.
[36:47] Almighty God, Father
[36:50] and author of life, author of this book
[36:54] we hold in our hands. We believe, oh
[36:57] God, this is nothing less than the
[36:59] infallible word of God. We believe that
[37:02] one word taken away from it or one word
[37:05] added, oh God, is uh is a sin against
[37:09] you. We pray today that you will take
[37:11] what is contained herein and reveal to
[37:15] us, Lord. Reveal to us the contents. No
[37:18] one knows the contents but the author.
[37:21] We pray you'll send your spirit. send it
[37:24] upon the people and into the people.
[37:27] Some here perhaps don't know what it is
[37:28] to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Fill
[37:32] them with the Holy Spirit. Come down, oh
[37:35] God, amongst us. Do the impossible, I
[37:38] pray. Let the cleansing flame and the
[37:42] purging power, let the washing of the
[37:44] water by the word, oh God, do its work
[37:47] amongst us now. We will thank you and
[37:50] praise you. Give utterance now Lord to
[37:53] my lips I pray and give hearing ears to
[37:56] the people in the name of Jesus Christ.
[37:59] Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[38:08] Now I
[38:11] approached uh this subject just briefly
[38:14] last Sunday and I'm going to just see
[38:16] how far we get along today. But I would
[38:20] like you to really give me your
[38:22] undivided attention. Don't be distracted
[38:24] and let's not have any more movement
[38:26] than is absolutely necessary.
[38:29] The question that the Greeks asked,
[38:35] sir, we would see Jesus.
[38:39] And the Bible says, now just to set the
[38:42] scene, the Bible says that these Greeks,
[38:48] they had come up to worship because the
[38:52] feast of Passover was a just coming at
[38:56] uh coming at hand. It was just a a few
[38:58] days before the feast of Passover. These
[39:01] people, these Greeks were worshippers of
[39:04] God, Jehovah God. And they came to
[39:08] worship to Jerusalem. And the Bible says
[39:12] that having come to Jerusalem, they
[39:15] desired to see Jesus and even got in in
[39:19] touch with the disciples and the
[39:21] disciples carried the request to Jesus.
[39:23] Now I get the scene. So now they want to
[39:26] see him. That is the question. And Jesus
[39:30] answered and saying the first thing he
[39:34] said, "The hour is come." Now he's
[39:38] talking about a season. He's he's going
[39:41] to inform and bring his disciples into
[39:45] an understanding. The hour has come. So
[39:49] now a season has arrived. And they may
[39:52] have, you know, been startled. No doubt
[39:54] where. These Greeks want to see you.
[39:56] These are worshippers that have come.
[39:58] They've gathered to Jerusalem. They've
[40:00] come for the Passover. They've come for
[40:02] the great feast. They only worship the
[40:05] God of Israel. And they've come here to
[40:07] worship. And they want to see you. They
[40:09] want to see Jesus. And so the hour, he
[40:11] says, the hour has come.
[40:14] That the Son of Man should be glorified.
[40:18] And I say unto you, except a corn of
[40:20] wheat fall into the ground and die, it
[40:24] abideth alone. But if it die, it
[40:27] bringeth forth much fruit. Now, you see,
[40:30] really
[40:31] what we're looking at is this, that the
[40:35] life
[40:37] of God that was being manifested in
[40:40] Jesus Christ was really a mystery.
[40:44] It was a mystery because uh even though
[40:48] the people and many many of them looked
[40:51] upon Jesus physically they never
[40:56] never got the revelation. That's why
[40:58] Jesus said who do men say that I am but
[41:01] who do you say that I am? And Peter said
[41:04] thou art the Christ. I've been speaking
[41:05] on the power of revelation and that's
[41:07] what I continue on because then when
[41:10] Peter said thou art the Christ the son
[41:11] of God Jesus said blessed art thou Simon
[41:15] Barjonah flesh and blood hath not reveal
[41:18] this unto thee but my father which is in
[41:20] heaven and I say unto you upon this rock
[41:23] this is a powerful foundation you can't
[41:26] take this lightly upon this rock I will
[41:29] build my church and the gates of hell
[41:32] shall not prevail against it will not
[41:36] prevail against the revelation of who
[41:38] Jesus Christ is at the current moment
[41:42] &gt;&gt; at this time not in history not who he
[41:45] was but who he is that's the revelation
[41:48] of who he is and that was the mystery it
[41:52] was a mystery to them it was a mystery
[41:54] to the most of the people but Andrew and
[41:57] and Philillip of course they knew who he
[42:00] was so they came to him saying these
[42:02] people want to see you. They want to
[42:04] know who you are. He said the hour's
[42:07] come and the son of man will be must be
[42:10] glorified will be glorified and except a
[42:14] corn of wheat. So now the thing was uh
[42:17] Jesus Christ was the word in flesh and
[42:21] the let's just put it this way the life
[42:24] that God was manifesting a little at a
[42:28] time unfolding a little at a time but it
[42:30] was essentially sealed.
[42:33] I want you to catch that. It was
[42:35] essentially sealed in Christ Jesus.
[42:39] that life would not really be released
[42:43] until he had suffered,
[42:47] died, and was buried, risen again, and
[42:52] then that life would be released if it's
[42:54] expedient for you that that I leave,
[42:58] that I go, for if I do not go, the Holy
[43:02] Spirit will not come. The comforter will
[43:04] not come unless that comforter, unless
[43:07] that Holy Ghost came. That life that was
[43:10] in Christ would not be released and he
[43:14] would not be glorified because he must
[43:16] be glorified amongst his saints. In
[43:19] fact, as the scripture says that the
[43:21] wife, the woman is the glory of the man
[43:24] and the church is the glory of Christ.
[43:27] He he that life that was sealed in him
[43:30] had to be released and once it was
[43:33] released he would be glorified and that
[43:35] is why he said uh the voice came and
[43:38] said I have both glorified it and will
[43:41] glorify it again because there was a
[43:43] glorifi he was being glorified in his
[43:45] saints then and would be glorified in
[43:47] brother Brandham at the in the seals in
[43:49] the seals book he comes at the beginning
[43:52] of the seals and and reads the scripture
[43:55] out of revelation and and then refers
[43:57] back to this one. When the voice
[43:59] thundered out, I have glorified it. And
[44:02] some said, an angel spake to him. And
[44:04] others said, it thundered. And Jesus
[44:07] said what it was. Jesus articulated what
[44:10] the words. The people heard the sound.
[44:12] They knew something supernatural. Oh,
[44:14] something is happening. Something's
[44:16] happened. Something an angel spoke to
[44:17] him. Another one says, "No, it was a
[44:19] thunder." They were confused and neither
[44:21] one of them were right. It was the voice
[44:23] of Almighty God saying that I have I
[44:26] have glorified it and will glorify it
[44:29] again. And Jesus told them what the
[44:32] voice articulated.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; The same as it was with the Apostle Paul
[44:36] when he when the voice spoke out and the
[44:39] people didn't they heard the sound but
[44:41] they didn't know what it said. But
[44:42] within the sound was the articulation of
[44:45] of the of the words. Saul Saul why
[44:48] persecutest thou me? That was only for
[44:50] Saul to hear. The others didn't hear it.
[44:53] They only heard a sound. There was a
[44:56] blast. And in this day, there was a
[44:58] message. We can call it a blast. And a
[45:01] lot of people say that's a sound. My
[45:04] what a screaming voice. What a sound. We
[45:06] don't understand it. Oh, it's just a
[45:07] bunch of judgment. It's just a bunch of
[45:09] this. It's contradictory. Uh, you know,
[45:11] it says one thing and then he says
[45:13] another thing and so it's just a sound.
[45:15] It's an angel. It's a thunder. It's
[45:16] this. It's that. It's something else.
[45:18] But to those to whom God would reveal
[45:21] himself, it's Christ speaking to his
[45:24] bride.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; And that happens to be a very different
[45:27] thing. We're we're not unduly enthused,
[45:30] friends. We're not unduly enthused. In
[45:33] fact, we're not enthused enough
[45:35] &gt;&gt; about what is taking place.
[45:38] And so Jesus was saying that except a
[45:41] corn and wheat fall into the ground, but
[45:44] let me say to you, but when it falls
[45:46] into the ground at its ordained time,
[45:50] it begins, it bursts forth with life.
[45:54] And there's nothing in a devil's world.
[45:58] There's nothing that can stop it. There
[46:01] is no government. There is no
[46:02] discouragement. There's no sickness.
[46:05] There's no nothing that can stop that
[46:07] life.
[46:09] People can speak against it. You can get
[46:11] all kinds of criticism. You can get all
[46:13] kinds of persecution. It can be
[46:15] physical. It can be mental. It can be
[46:17] this kind of abuse or that kind of
[46:19] abuse. They can say what they want. But
[46:22] they cannot stop that life.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cannot stop it. I can tell
[46:28] you whatever you're going through today
[46:30] or whatever you may go through tomorrow,
[46:32] nothing can stop that life. I don't care
[46:35] whether it's your whether the young
[46:37] people in school or the men in the
[46:39] workplace or the women with the children
[46:41] or whatever it might be. It cannot stop
[46:44] that life.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Cannot
[46:49] under any condition.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; You know,
[46:55] as you drive along the highways,
[46:58] you'll see uh signs occasionally and
[47:01] they say something like this.
[47:04] dangerous
[47:06] uh dangerous materials
[47:10] route.
[47:11] That is where trucks
[47:14] who are hauling dangerous materials.
[47:18] They must go a certain direction
[47:21] because they have sealed containers.
[47:25] and those sealed containers in the event
[47:27] there was an accident of some kind and
[47:30] then they would begin to seep or leak
[47:32] out some of the dangerous materials or
[47:35] gas or whatever more. They'd have to
[47:38] evacuate a vast area and of course it
[47:40] has happened. There was a tragic
[47:42] accident just north in Edmonton just the
[47:44] night we arrived. It was really tragic
[47:47] where a tanker truck tried to buy tried
[47:50] to pass a a a bus and the bus there had
[47:53] been an accident and the bus had stopped
[47:56] and the cars were turning and going back
[47:58] and so the bus backed up and got its
[48:01] wheels stuck just off the pavement and
[48:03] it was trying to maneuver and so some of
[48:06] the people actually got off the bus and
[48:08] this tanker truck was coming down the
[48:11] road. Several cars had pulled out past
[48:13] the bus saw it. But somehow the tanker
[48:14] truck, I understand, saw at the last
[48:17] moment and pulled out, but he had a pup
[48:19] trailer on behind and the trailer came
[48:21] right slamming into the bus and killed
[48:24] four people instantly. The bus
[48:26] apparently flipped over on some people
[48:28] that were standing on the side of the
[48:30] road. Thought they were safe. Of course,
[48:33] it's really tragic. Over 20ome people,
[48:35] they said it's the worst accident in
[48:37] Alberta in over about 25 years. and the
[48:40] queen and her husband who were just
[48:42] visiting sent condolences to the family
[48:45] and all the rest of it. But they have
[48:47] certain they have certain routes,
[48:51] certain highway designated
[48:54] where where sealed containers of
[48:58] dangerous materials must be taken. Well,
[49:01] I I tell you man does his best. We knew
[49:05] nothing of that not very many years ago
[49:07] because there was not transporting of
[49:09] such dangerous chemicals and materials.
[49:12] But in this day, we have a lot of that.
[49:15] And we'll find it right here in this
[49:17] whole area here in the Pacific
[49:18] Northwest. You'll find it. I'm talking
[49:21] about another material. It's it's
[49:23] dangerous to some people,
[49:26] &gt;&gt; but it's not dangerous to others. It's a
[49:28] lifegiving. It's a life force. A life
[49:32] force. It's not a religion. It has
[49:35] nothing to do with Cloverdale Bible Way.
[49:37] It has nothing to do with the name of
[49:38] any other church. It is a life force of
[49:42] almighty God, the creator of heavens and
[49:45] earth. And he has sealed, he has sealed
[49:49] a part of his own being, a part of his
[49:51] own life into other vessels of clay.
[49:55] This is his. And you are sealed by the
[49:58] Holy Ghost. And God only lets out what
[50:01] he wants to let out. He only reveals
[50:03] what he wants to reveal. He only reveals
[50:06] when he wants to reveal and he only
[50:08] reveals to whom he wants to reveal.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; It is dangerous also. It's dangerous for
[50:18] some. It's dangerous for those who mock.
[50:21] It's dangerous for those who
[50:23] misunderstand. It's dangerous for those
[50:25] who reject. It's dangerous for the
[50:27] world. Because the same water that saved
[50:30] Noah was the same water that destroyed
[50:32] the unbeliever.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus Christ with all of his
[50:36] love and compassion that saved and paid
[50:39] the price for the penalty of the world.
[50:42] But for those that disbelieved, it was
[50:44] judgment upon them.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; And I've seen it.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; I've seen it over and over again.
[50:52] And so Jesus is saying here
[50:57] in this season,
[50:59] the season that it is to be released.
[51:01] And so you you see the scene now you
[51:04] just if you catch the scene here, it
[51:07] replicates now in in in our time. And so
[51:11] now
[51:13] he is not only saying it's not only that
[51:15] a life is sealed within himself which is
[51:19] the seed and he's saying except a corn
[51:21] wheat or kernel of wheat fall into the
[51:24] ground it abides alone. Why does it
[51:25] abide alone? Cuz the life is sealed in
[51:28] it. But if it if it falls into the
[51:30] ground now there's another there's
[51:34] there's something that I want to
[51:35] compound here. Brother Brandham says
[51:40] that that seed can be in the earth.
[51:44] But at the time when the sun, the s u n
[51:49] moves near to the earth and warms the
[51:53] earth, that life that's in the seed
[51:56] bursts out and the seed dies, but the
[52:00] life comes forth. And now the earth, the
[52:04] earth as we know it as a as a planet
[52:08] had been marvelously
[52:11] marvelously visited by the soom.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Not the su but the soom. There he was
[52:20] standing on the earth as it was as it
[52:23] were warming the earth bringing the
[52:26] bringing the people into a a knowledge
[52:29] that God had sent the lamb as a savior
[52:33] to the world. Oh friends, I hope you can
[52:36] catch what I am seeing. And the earth
[52:39] was being warmed. A season had come. He
[52:42] said the hour is here.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another time. The
[52:47] hour has come when God when the I will
[52:50] be glorified. Hallelujah. What a day.
[52:54] There never been a day like that day.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; There had been prophets and kings and
[52:58] Solomon's and and Davids and all the
[53:01] rest, but there never been a day like
[53:02] that day. And here he was. The earth was
[53:05] being warmed by the presence of the son
[53:08] of God.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; But it had something had to happen. This
[53:12] wasn't sufficient. This wasn't complete.
[53:16] like a man without his wife. It wasn't
[53:19] complete. He said
[53:21] a voice said, "I have glorified it and
[53:24] I'll glorify it again." And so Jesus in
[53:27] his answer is actually adding mystery to
[53:30] mystery.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; So we'd see Jesus except a corner of
[53:34] wheat fall into the ground, it abides
[53:37] alone. And so even the the life that was
[53:41] sealed in that seed is going to go into
[53:44] the ground. and and there's no way of
[53:47] them knowing. They can't begin to
[53:49] comprehend how is he going to be
[53:51] glorified. And this is the season. And
[53:54] so the life that was in him,
[53:57] the life that you are sitting here
[53:59] today, whatever degree of spiritual life
[54:02] that you have, claim to have, or ever
[54:06] will have was in him right then.
[54:12] And he's saying simply unless this seed
[54:16] goes through this process it will not be
[54:19] released
[54:20] &gt;&gt; there. It has to be released. But my
[54:23] message is once it's released there is
[54:26] no power
[54:28] &gt;&gt; no power
[54:29] &gt;&gt; in hell
[54:31] &gt;&gt; or on earth
[54:33] &gt;&gt; that can stop the life
[54:35] &gt;&gt; that God ordained to come forth.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And my precious children, I will say to
[54:43] you, many of you, most of you have been
[54:47] birthed into the kingdom of God under
[54:50] the knowledge of this message and many
[54:52] under my own ministry. I feel to
[54:54] announce to you today, you are children
[54:57] of this revelation.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; You're children of this life force.
[55:02] You're children because of this release.
[55:04] And if it had not been released, you
[55:06] would not be here. But because it is
[55:09] released, there's nothing that can stop
[55:11] you.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can hinder you from
[55:15] coming to your ultimate ultimate
[55:17] destination.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And what God has ordained for you in the
[55:23] maturity of Jesus Christ, there is no
[55:26] power.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care. I look down into you into
[55:29] the faces of the young people. There's
[55:30] no school teacher.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; There's no peers. There's no friends.
[55:35] There's no workmen that work with you
[55:36] people. There is no associate that
[55:38] you've ever had. There's no man or woman
[55:41] or husband or wife that can ever stop
[55:43] you from arriving to your destination.
[55:47] Hallelujah.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; There's no failure. There's no reversal.
[55:51] There's no financial disaster. There's
[55:54] nothing that can hinder you from coming
[55:56] to your destination.
[55:58] Hallelujah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And why do I say that? Because I can
[56:02] announce to you, thus sayeth the Lord,
[56:04] the life has been released.
[56:08] Hallelujah.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; The word, the scripture and the season
[56:15] had to come together.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Even the disciples in their I will say
[56:21] in their natural love and affection for
[56:23] Christ. Peter especially trying to
[56:27] prevent Christ going through this
[56:30] suffering.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Not for you to go to this death. not for
[56:35] you to be uh to to be accused of these
[56:39] uh Pharisees and these religious order
[56:42] hypocrites they are. It's not for you to
[56:45] become subjected to them. It's not for
[56:47] you to suffer under a Roman rule and a
[56:50] Roman sentence. It's not for you. You
[56:53] must escape this. But he says, "How then
[56:56] will the scriptures be fulfilled?" And
[56:59] so when the scripture and the time come
[57:02] into the same cycle, nothing can stop
[57:05] the life from being released.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the word of God.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Hasn't got anything to do with you or
[57:14] me.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with any other man or
[57:18] person. It has to do when the scripture
[57:22] that has been pro the prophecy and the
[57:25] season come together and are lined up
[57:29] then something's going to happen.
[57:32] Whatever God ordained is going to take
[57:35] place. And God ordained that this one,
[57:38] this word in flesh called Jesus Christ
[57:42] that he is going to he is going to come
[57:45] and be judged of man and suffer the
[57:48] death and die the death and be raised
[57:52] again. And my precious friends, it's not
[57:56] because we have a church established or
[57:59] churches all over the place and millions
[58:02] of people calling the name of Jesus
[58:04] Christ. But I can assure you one thing
[58:07] that if the people miss, it's not a
[58:09] matter of the mechanics. It's a matter
[58:12] of the dynamics of the life that is
[58:15] released from the seed at its season.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; But if it's not revealed to a person,
[58:21] they're not participants of it.
[58:23] but to you and that's why I spoke last
[58:26] Sunday
[58:28] lest we take for granted
[58:31] lest we underestimate
[58:33] lest we do not regard what is happening
[58:36] in our time can happen you can be born
[58:39] with a golden spoon in your mouth but
[58:41] you want to appreciate it
[58:43] &gt;&gt; and you've been born with a lot more
[58:45] than a golden spoon in your mouth you've
[58:47] been born with the fullness of the word
[58:50] being unfolded you've been birthed
[58:52] birthed in a you've been birthed in a
[58:54] season when the word's been released.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:06] Jesus said, "The hour has come the Son
[59:08] of Man should be glorified.
[59:11] Except a corn and wheat fall into the
[59:13] ground and die, it abides alone. But if
[59:15] it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
[59:17] Now is my soul troubled."
[59:20] I'm just giving certain phrases. Father,
[59:23] shall I say, Father, save me from this
[59:25] hour? For this cause came I under this
[59:27] hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then
[59:30] came a voice from heaven saying, I have
[59:32] both glorified it and will glorify it
[59:35] again.
[59:37] I went
[59:39] and I was looking at
[59:41] I thought it was s we would see Jesus.
[59:44] It might be show us the father. But here
[59:48] comes
[59:49] here comes brother Brandham with that
[59:51] kind of a statement. Show us the father
[59:53] or sers we would see Jesus. It's very
[59:58] very early in the ministry
[1:00:02] in Chicago or one of the major cities
[1:00:08] and the man a man comes before him, the
[1:00:11] first first person
[1:00:13] and he speaks to him for just a few
[1:00:15] moments
[1:00:16] and he begins to tell that man
[1:00:22] who he was. believe he said you're a
[1:00:25] minister
[1:00:27] and you're not from this city and you're
[1:00:29] from another city and this is the name
[1:00:32] of that city and furthermore this is
[1:00:35] your name and they call you this I
[1:00:38] believe it was Harry
[1:00:41] and you live on such and such a street
[1:00:45] and at such and such an address
[1:00:48] as I read that
[1:00:51] in in harmony in keeping with what I was
[1:00:54] reading and studying. I thought, "Oh,
[1:00:58] God,
[1:01:00] the dumbest people on earth should have
[1:01:03] at least realized something's happening
[1:01:07] that has never happened in human
[1:01:09] history." Amen. Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; When did a man
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; tell me when did a man stand in front of
[1:01:16] people and said your name is such and
[1:01:18] such and you come from another city and
[1:01:21] that city is this name up in this state
[1:01:24] and furthermore you're a preacher and
[1:01:27] furthermore you live on this street and
[1:01:29] you live at this number. Do you know
[1:01:31] what the people should have said at
[1:01:33] least?
[1:01:35] I'll tell you. I'll put it in my
[1:01:36] language today.
[1:01:38] Something that's been sealed is starting
[1:01:41] to seep out.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Something that has been sealed
[1:01:46] absolutely
[1:01:48] I won't say airtight, but I'll say
[1:01:51] wisdom tight. No amount of wisdom could
[1:01:54] discover it.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; No amount of theology could find it. No
[1:01:58] amount of education, no amount of
[1:02:00] smartness, no amount of skill, no amount
[1:02:02] of power, no amount of money, nothing
[1:02:04] could discover this. And so God took the
[1:02:08] ignorant of of the world and brought it
[1:02:11] in front of the intellectuals and the
[1:02:14] educated and the theologians and begin
[1:02:17] to give evidence something that's been
[1:02:19] stealed is being released.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; They should have caught it.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's being released. And they they not
[1:02:29] only should have caught it, but they
[1:02:30] were students of the word. They should
[1:02:32] have been able to at least say
[1:02:35] that
[1:02:37] is identical to what the Lord Jesus did.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And if they'd have got that, if they
[1:02:45] would have just regarded that and said,
[1:02:47] "God, we don't know what's happening.
[1:02:51] We're not sure what's happening, but
[1:02:53] we're sure of one thing. You are the
[1:02:56] author of it."
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what this mouth speaks when it
[1:03:02] speaks truth of his address and truth of
[1:03:05] his city and truth of his state and
[1:03:07] truth of his occupation and truth
[1:03:09] concerning his wife and truth concerning
[1:03:11] the secret of his heart. Surely we can
[1:03:13] say what comes from that mouth will be
[1:03:15] the truth.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to say amen to that?
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Not at all. You believe it, don't you?
[1:03:23] Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; How do people miss that?
[1:03:30] How do they miss that at that time?
[1:03:33] And we don't have to go back there. We
[1:03:35] want to make sure that we don't miss
[1:03:37] what is unfolding now.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to make sure. We
[1:03:41] want to make sure that we're right in
[1:03:43] the channel now.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] And Jesus said, "This voice came not
[1:03:56] because of me, but for your sakes." You
[1:03:59] know,
[1:04:02] the words of Jesus
[1:04:05] are so baffling. Sometime
[1:04:09] they didn't understand before the voice
[1:04:12] spoke and after the voice spoke and they
[1:04:16] said it thundered.
[1:04:18] Uh, an angel spoke to him and he said,
[1:04:23] "This voice didn't come from me. It came
[1:04:25] for you." That was amazing. He He told
[1:04:27] him, "It came for them and they're the
[1:04:28] ones that didn't understand it."
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. If you just
[1:04:35] read these few verses, you'll have to
[1:04:37] come to one conclusion that the things
[1:04:40] of God are only revealed by God himself.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You cannot discover them any other way.
[1:04:46] You can't put just some figures
[1:04:48] together, two and two automatically make
[1:04:50] four. That just isn't the way it works.
[1:04:52] It has to be It might look that it might
[1:04:54] look as though this can never come
[1:04:56] together. It might look as though this
[1:04:57] is the most mysterious thing, but when
[1:04:59] God reveals it to it just becomes so
[1:05:03] simple. It's so clear.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:10] I'm going to bring this down to a
[1:05:11] practical
[1:05:15] practical terms before the service is
[1:05:17] over, Lord willing.
[1:05:22] We hear the word revelation. Revelation,
[1:05:24] revelation, revelation to some is the
[1:05:26] name of the book, the last book of the
[1:05:28] old of the New Testament.
[1:05:32] And to those of us in the message, we
[1:05:34] hear revelation all the time. And I've
[1:05:35] heard of people that had such glorious
[1:05:37] revelations and today they're not
[1:05:38] walking, I would say, in fellowship with
[1:05:41] Christ at all. I haven't got I I'm not
[1:05:45] I'm not swept off my feet by someone
[1:05:47] talking about the grand or glorious
[1:05:49] revelation they have. But a revelation,
[1:05:52] I would just make a couple of
[1:05:54] statements.
[1:05:56] If you have a revelation of Christ in
[1:05:59] this message, you will live the kind of
[1:06:02] life that that word speaks of and
[1:06:05] produces
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; a revelation
[1:06:10] also. It it is it so compounds the words
[1:06:14] of Jesus and that of our precious
[1:06:17] brother Brandham when he speaks of the
[1:06:19] sun coming near the earth when it moves
[1:06:21] near the earth in the springtime. the
[1:06:23] sun. The su n moves near the earth,
[1:06:27] warms the earth and the seeds
[1:06:31] burst out their sealed life and it comes
[1:06:34] up and we see a profusion of it
[1:06:38] everywhere at this time of the year. So,
[1:06:41] revelation also means coming.
[1:06:45] It speaks of coming because the sun is
[1:06:48] coming closer to the earth.
[1:06:52] And when we speak of the word of God and
[1:06:55] people speak of the second coming of
[1:06:57] Jesus Christ, we're in that coming in
[1:07:01] that the sun has moved close to the
[1:07:04] earth. The son moved so close that he
[1:07:07] came veiled in a prophet's ministry.
[1:07:11] Understand now, brother Brandham have no
[1:07:14] ministry outside of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Neither do you. Neither do I. We have
[1:07:20] nothing outside of him. And so when we
[1:07:23] speak a prophet, it is the it is Jesus
[1:07:26] Christ himself in his own office. But
[1:07:30] now in this time of the reason, we can
[1:07:31] say also and I'm giving it in different
[1:07:33] language. We can say this never happened
[1:07:35] for all of these centuries of time. Why
[1:07:37] didn't it happen? Because the S N had
[1:07:41] not moved that close to the earth. But
[1:07:44] now he was moving close to the earth.
[1:07:46] What for? To warm
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; the earth such as we see here. To warm
[1:07:52] the seed and to soften the earth and the
[1:07:56] frozen, cold, formal
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; lives that we were living in needed to
[1:08:02] be warmed by the son of God in the
[1:08:05] revelation of himself. and it warmed the
[1:08:08] earth and the seed that was in you
[1:08:10] bushed forth
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; and a life was released. And I announce
[1:08:16] again, I'm going to say it over and over
[1:08:18] because it's a theme. Nothing,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; nothing, hear me, nothing in heaven or
[1:08:24] hell or any other place can stop that
[1:08:27] seed and that life from coming to its
[1:08:30] ultimate goal.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; to God.
[1:08:37] God be praised.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And so revelation is his coming.
[1:08:43] Revelation is also an appearing.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; He appeared.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of the ministry to
[1:08:50] appear
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; before the people
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; to make it so vivid.
[1:08:58] Revelation is the disclosure of truth
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; that was previously hidden.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; So it's a coming
[1:09:06] It's a disclosure of the truth and it's
[1:09:10] also an appearing.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; One last statement.
[1:09:15] Revelation
[1:09:18] is used to describe events
[1:09:22] or things or persons that hitherto or up
[1:09:26] till now have been withdrawn from view
[1:09:32] and are made visible to all by a
[1:09:36] manifestation.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the ministry of you.
[1:09:39] Take all of those those all are
[1:09:42] encompassed in the ministry of brother
[1:09:45] Brandham.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] And I say all of that not to give you
[1:09:53] information about his ministry. I give I
[1:09:55] say all of that to let you know that it
[1:09:58] was God releasing
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; something that had been sealed. And in
[1:10:04] that release, the very act of releasing
[1:10:07] it was going to act on the earth, act on
[1:10:11] the vessels, and you were stumbling
[1:10:14] around somewhere in your life, in your
[1:10:17] lost condition, or maybe you weren't
[1:10:20] even born yet, but in the mind of God,
[1:10:22] you would come forth and you're going to
[1:10:25] come in contact with this revelation,
[1:10:28] with this appearing, with this coming,
[1:10:30] with this disclosure of truth. And
[1:10:33] that's why nothing else satisfied you.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; All the catechisms and all the other
[1:10:39] doctrinal things that you and traits and
[1:10:42] and all kinds of legalism that you were
[1:10:44] tied in had nothing. You're just going
[1:10:46] through the motions. But one day,
[1:10:48] hallelujah. One day here came an
[1:10:52] appearing. You saw something different.
[1:10:54] One day the s u n
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; drew close to you the s o n
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; and warmed and touched you so deep
[1:11:04] nothing had ever touched you like that
[1:11:06] and a life came forth
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; it was released upon you and you are
[1:11:12] birthed you are children of this release
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and that's why the seals the
[1:11:19] seven seals that which had been sealed
[1:11:22] seal it up John Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Seal it up. Don't declare it.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Seal it up until a time. And he was
[1:11:31] holding it. Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Within the great galaxies of his
[1:11:36] spiritual work, holding it until a
[1:11:39] certain time. And whether it would be
[1:11:42] all these thousands of years, but then
[1:11:44] the time would come and we could say
[1:11:46] like Jesus said, "The hour has come."
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say to you today, friends,
[1:11:53] the hour has come and the hour is here
[1:11:56] of the release.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And this release is going to culminate
[1:12:04] in the ultimate release.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Because that life that you have can no
[1:12:09] more be held in this physical body than
[1:12:11] the than the grave could hold the body
[1:12:13] of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Yeah.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you today is a declaration.
[1:12:21] Your physical frame can't hold what God
[1:12:24] has put in there.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; It's meant for a release.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; And the ultimate release is this old
[1:12:30] cage is going to drop to the ground and
[1:12:33] you're going to rise out of here.
[1:12:35] Hallelujah. You'll be changed in a
[1:12:37] moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:12:46] I spoke to Rod's father, Mr. Bergen,
[1:12:49] last night. I wanted to hear from his
[1:12:52] own lips and I heard his experience.
[1:12:56] I believe God does these things. I
[1:12:58] believe absolutely it was of God. They
[1:13:01] lost their daughter. She died here not
[1:13:04] very long ago, Rod's sister.
[1:13:08] And uh
[1:13:11] he told me yesterday he said there was a
[1:13:14] horrible emptiness within me. Nothing
[1:13:19] nothing could seem to fill that huge
[1:13:22] void. And he just kept describing as an
[1:13:25] emptiness. There was just a emptiness
[1:13:29] after his daughter had passed away
[1:13:33] and it was raining.
[1:13:36] But he it came to his mind to go and see
[1:13:39] her husband
[1:13:41] because he was wondering how he's coping
[1:13:43] with the loss of his wife and have
[1:13:46] children.
[1:13:49] She was a piano teacher also. Brother
[1:13:51] Ryan,
[1:13:53] gifted woman. We knew her well since a
[1:13:56] child.
[1:13:58] And the church here was praying for her.
[1:14:01] And so Dad Bergen got in his car
[1:14:06] and he went to drive to their place
[1:14:08] which is not far here from the church
[1:14:11] and he came around a curve I think in a
[1:14:12] culde-sac
[1:14:15] and he said he drove there was a woman
[1:14:17] standing there and had her arms folded
[1:14:19] like this.
[1:14:21] You know also it was amazing
[1:14:24] brother Rickart and brother Marco's
[1:14:26] grandfather
[1:14:28] whose trustee in the church of brother
[1:14:31] Ret sister Linda Maritza's dad
[1:14:35] also passed beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:38] and when he did he told us clearly he
[1:14:40] said I had I had my arms folded
[1:14:43] and he said the others the nurses were
[1:14:45] busy going around and and his wife was
[1:14:48] patting him on the face and he had
[1:14:51] already passed and he was standing there
[1:14:53] with his arms folded and thought, "What
[1:14:55] is the problem?
[1:14:58] I'm in full control. Everything is
[1:15:01] fine." He told me, "If this is death,"
[1:15:03] he said, "It's just nothing. There's
[1:15:05] nothing to it." If that is death.
[1:15:09] Dad Bergen drove around this culde-sac
[1:15:13] and there was his daughter standing in a
[1:15:16] dress with her arms folded like this.
[1:15:22] And he said, "I have to speak to her."
[1:15:27] And he looked down
[1:15:29] to roll the window down
[1:15:32] and looked up and she was gone.
[1:15:35] He pulled right up beside her and
[1:15:37] stopped.
[1:15:39] He said, "The thing that happened is
[1:15:41] that huge void and emptiness
[1:15:45] as of that instant passed
[1:15:48] and has never returned.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; It took that experience. I would say God
[1:15:53] did that for him
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; to let him know." But I used brother
[1:15:57] Bradam's words for him. I said, "God
[1:15:59] allowed you to look beyond the curtain
[1:16:02] of time." He said, "That's exactly
[1:16:04] right."
[1:16:05] He allowed me to look beyond the curtain
[1:16:07] of time.
[1:16:09] The life that God has released in this
[1:16:12] age, it's not like any other age,
[1:16:15] friends. This is rapture age. This is
[1:16:17] bride age. This is a different season. I
[1:16:20] need you to be aware. I need you all, I
[1:16:23] need the young people to be taught, to
[1:16:25] be learned that this is not the same.
[1:16:27] This is not another religion. This is
[1:16:30] not just some other, you know, new
[1:16:31] things that have come. This is not just
[1:16:33] a few truths that have been revealed.
[1:16:35] That's not what it is. This is the le
[1:16:38] the the seals which were on Christ
[1:16:40] himself as as he was sealed right then.
[1:16:43] We don't see Jesus. Those Greeks, the
[1:16:46] only way the Greeks could ever get to
[1:16:48] see Jesus was for him to go to the cross
[1:16:51] and go to the tomb and come out and the
[1:16:54] Holy Spirit come down on the day of
[1:16:57] Pentecost. And then the church was born
[1:17:00] under the release of the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:03] And then the Jews heard and saw who
[1:17:06] Jesus was.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; That's the only way they could see it.
[1:17:12] He was actually telling them how they
[1:17:14] were going to see him. But it was still
[1:17:17] a mystery.
[1:17:18] See, I can tell you that even though
[1:17:22] everything that God has sealed up for
[1:17:25] 2,000 years has been released and a
[1:17:28] vindicated prophet's mouth has declared
[1:17:31] it, yet it remains a mystery. But not
[1:17:35] not to those to whom it's been revealed
[1:17:37] or to those who have been initiated
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; into the mystery. Something's a mystery.
[1:17:46] you know, we've got a number of clubs in
[1:17:48] in uh societies and so on. And we
[1:17:51] understand there's secret societies and
[1:17:54] I don't know they've got you know the
[1:17:55] different ones in the masons and
[1:18:00] uh you know different lodges and they
[1:18:02] have initiation rights that you have to
[1:18:05] go through and some are called very
[1:18:06] secret
[1:18:08] and they have rights and once in a while
[1:18:10] there's whispers coming out about the
[1:18:12] strange rights that they have because
[1:18:15] that is the initiation rights and that's
[1:18:17] where the word mystery in the Greek
[1:18:20] comes from mystery has to do with being
[1:18:23] initiated because if you're not
[1:18:25] initiated. The mystery is those who have
[1:18:28] been you've been initiated.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; You have been initiated.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You've gone through the justification,
[1:18:37] the process, the sanctification, the
[1:18:40] sealing of the Holy Spirit. You're
[1:18:42] initiated
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; into a select elect group of people.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; It's not my doing. It's not this church.
[1:18:50] It's God's church.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; It's God's elect.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; We couldn't make You couldn't make
[1:18:55] somebody elect no matter how much you
[1:18:57] loved them, how much you prayed, how
[1:18:59] much you did anything. It's the
[1:19:01] predestinated love of almighty God. And
[1:19:04] by his elective love,
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; He elects his own.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; This is his doing.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; We say this is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:19:16] marvelous in our eyes.
[1:19:20] Appreciate it.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; You ought to thank him every day for it.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Thank Thank you, God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And that's how they saw him.
[1:19:40] The scripture speaks
[1:19:44] Jesus said glorify
[1:19:48] the hours come that the son of man
[1:19:50] should be glorified.
[1:19:52] Paul and Thessalonians said when he
[1:19:56] shall come to be glorified in his
[1:19:59] saints. Now the the the the coming that
[1:20:02] the denominations think of he's going to
[1:20:04] come you know just bang flash boom
[1:20:08] everything's all over and it's no how
[1:20:11] could he be come and be glorified in the
[1:20:12] saints this coming when he shall come
[1:20:15] he's speaking of the future when he
[1:20:17] shall come to be glorified in his saints
[1:20:20] there's going to be uh he he's going to
[1:20:22] move near the earth which has already
[1:20:24] happened he has moved near the earth
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; this is in his coming
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; and to be admired by all them that
[1:20:36] believe.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; What happens to the unbeliever? They
[1:20:40] don't admire it.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; They reject it.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; I guess this would be all right. Brother
[1:20:46] Don, if I mentioned, sent me a an email.
[1:20:50] the brothers, they get around and I
[1:20:52] guess kick a soccer ball on some
[1:20:54] evenings
[1:20:55] and they've been using the
[1:20:58] school lot across here and it's kind of
[1:21:00] taken up a lot of the time. So, uh
[1:21:03] there's a a ball soccer field and so on
[1:21:08] just up on 64th here a couple blocks up
[1:21:11] and I guess it belongs to the Baptist
[1:21:13] church and school. So they were out
[1:21:15] there kicking the ball around and the
[1:21:17] man came out and said
[1:21:19] uh we have to ask you to leave. So they
[1:21:23] said, "Well, is it uh you know uh is
[1:21:26] there a member of the deacon board or is
[1:21:29] there could we see the pastor?" He said,
[1:21:31] "We don't have a pastor right now, but
[1:21:34] I'm a member of the deacon board and I
[1:21:36] have to ask you to leave." and they
[1:21:38] said, "Well, we understand that, you
[1:21:40] know, there's insurance
[1:21:42] uh concerns and we we let you know that
[1:21:46] we are we are covered. Our our group is
[1:21:48] covered by insurance." No, he said,
[1:21:50] "It's not an insurance concern. It's
[1:21:52] what you believe
[1:21:55] and we have to ask you to leave." So, he
[1:21:58] couldn't even kick a ball on the grass
[1:22:00] field because of what you believe.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right, Brother Jim.
[1:22:04] Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] Hallelujah. Beware when all men speak
[1:22:09] well of you.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; But when you have a reproach for what
[1:22:13] you believe, says you should rejoice.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in rejoicing?
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; When all men speak evil of you, rejoice.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You don't get down in the mouth when
[1:22:27] they don't understand. You rejoice.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:35] I'm waiting on you.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I understand brother Tom was preaching
[1:22:40] in in Seattle and he got kind of wound
[1:22:43] up and said to the people,
[1:22:46] "You ought to stand and praise God." And
[1:22:48] the whole congregation stood up and
[1:22:50] praised God. He didn't quite Well, he
[1:22:52] said, "Well, he wasn't quite expecting
[1:22:54] that. So, I guess the preacher ought to
[1:22:56] say what he means and means what he
[1:22:57] says."
[1:22:59] They all stood up. But when I say you
[1:23:01] ought to rejoice, you just go right
[1:23:02] ahead.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Get off of my yard. Get off
[1:23:07] of my field. Get whatever more cuz you
[1:23:09] don't believe what we believe. Bel
[1:23:11] believe.
[1:23:12] My goodness.
[1:23:19] Now Jesus said or rather Paul said in
[1:23:22] Timothy
[1:23:23] and without controversy
[1:23:26] great is the mystery of godliness. In
[1:23:30] other words if it's a great mystery it's
[1:23:33] impossible
[1:23:35] for those that are not initiated
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; haven't gone through the process
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; to understand and even the disciples
[1:23:44] couldn't understand this process. uh uh
[1:23:47] Jesus they the gentlemen have come the
[1:23:49] Greeks have come sir we would see Jesus
[1:23:52] except the corn of wheat fall into the
[1:23:53] ground he's going into a mysterious
[1:23:55] process
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; and abide it abideth alone I'll abide
[1:24:00] alone is what he's saying but if it fall
[1:24:02] into the ground it'll bring forth much
[1:24:05] fruit
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't understand it because
[1:24:08] they hadn't been initiated yet but on
[1:24:09] the day of Pentecost they became
[1:24:11] initiated
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and the life that was in
[1:24:13] Christ became sealed in them and then
[1:24:15] they und understood what he was talking
[1:24:17] about.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And the gospel of the kingdom went to
[1:24:22] all the region and did go to indeed the
[1:24:24] Greeks. You go to read in the in the
[1:24:25] book of Acts and you'll find out the
[1:24:27] Greeks heard and saw Jesus Christ.
[1:24:40] We have a inquiry
[1:24:43] from a minister
[1:24:46] and he's never heard
[1:24:49] about this message and never heard about
[1:24:51] the prophet
[1:24:53] and he thought that surely if there was
[1:24:56] such a great work that had happened in
[1:24:58] the earth that he would have heard about
[1:25:00] it. But you know, had their leaders done
[1:25:03] what they should have done,
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; they would have heard,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; there'd have been millions more that
[1:25:08] would have heard.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; But great is the mystery
[1:25:12] of godliness. God was manifest in the
[1:25:16] flesh and justified in the spirit, seen
[1:25:19] of angels, preached unto the Gentiles,
[1:25:21] believed on in the world, and received
[1:25:23] up into glory. And it's a scripture
[1:25:26] which was used many, many times. And
[1:25:28] brother Brandham used this language and
[1:25:30] I love it. God came to the earth in the
[1:25:33] form of man and unfolded himself,
[1:25:37] stretched his tent.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Think of it. God stretched his tent, but
[1:25:44] the people didn't know who was in the
[1:25:46] tent.
[1:25:49] from being Jehovah God to become man
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; to stand and stand the shame and the
[1:25:57] curse
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; and be not afraid. He said God changed
[1:26:00] his cast
[1:26:02] from a spirit and stretched his tent to
[1:26:05] become us. And this is where brother
[1:26:08] Donnie Reagan got the phrase, he became
[1:26:11] me so that I through his grace could
[1:26:12] become him. Here he stretched his tent,
[1:26:15] he become us. that we through his grace
[1:26:19] might become him. Maybe you didn't know
[1:26:21] that's where those words came from.
[1:26:26] Beginning and ending of the gentile
[1:26:28] dispensation. Notice the title,
[1:26:30] beginning and ending of the gentile
[1:26:32] dispensation. You need to notice the
[1:26:34] script the the very titles of the
[1:26:37] messages that he used. He said, "What is
[1:26:40] it the mystery of God?" What is the
[1:26:43] mystery of God? Remember the mystery,
[1:26:46] anything that's a mystery cannot be
[1:26:49] known unless someone has initiated into
[1:26:53] the group into the uh we say the elect
[1:26:58] body or the club or the society. They've
[1:27:01] got to be initiated. In other words,
[1:27:04] they need to go through the same
[1:27:06] process. And when they go through the
[1:27:09] same process, then they know what the
[1:27:12] mystery is all about. They know what's
[1:27:14] on the inside. They're in on the inside
[1:27:16] of things. And now, Brother Brandham is
[1:27:19] saying, taking it from the scripture,
[1:27:20] what is it? The mystery of God. What is
[1:27:23] the mystery of God? God in you.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And how will they see Jesus? How will
[1:27:29] they know God? How are people going to
[1:27:31] know God unless they're initiated
[1:27:33] through the same process and go through
[1:27:36] the same process and receive the same
[1:27:38] revelation that you have received from
[1:27:41] the divine Holy Spirit.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Hear me friends.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; They'll never be able to see it.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus and maybe they
[1:27:52] think that you know well uh you know God
[1:27:55] did something or he healed me or I was
[1:27:57] able to stop my drugs or whatever more.
[1:27:59] All kinds of people are are delivered
[1:28:01] from those things without ever knowing.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Everyone that Jesus healed certainly
[1:28:07] didn't come to know him.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; After he even healed, he came back and
[1:28:12] and asked and the man says, "Who is it?"
[1:28:15] He said, "Dust thou believe on the son
[1:28:16] of man?" He said, "Who is the son of
[1:28:18] man?" Here's a man already been healed.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Miracles aren't new and miracles are no
[1:28:25] evidence that a person is spiritual.
[1:28:28] nothing at all.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Understand it?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; But when you when you have a revelation,
[1:28:34] then you know that the son has come
[1:28:36] close to the earth. When you have a
[1:28:38] revelation, you know that he has come.
[1:28:40] When you have a revelation, you know
[1:28:42] that he has appeared. When you have a
[1:28:44] revelation, then you know that something
[1:28:46] has been told you that has been hidden
[1:28:48] and undisclosed up to this time, but now
[1:28:51] it's made known.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; And when you know that, then you walk
[1:28:56] different.
[1:28:57] You can say something's been released.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; I'm born into a different household. I'm
[1:29:04] born a privileged child.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; I'm born as a child of this revelation.
[1:29:09] I'm born into a different kind of a
[1:29:12] family, a society.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; I've been empowered.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; My father has a huge bank account. I've
[1:29:21] been empowered and he's given me the
[1:29:23] authority to sign a check.
[1:29:28] And whatsoever you desire when you pray,
[1:29:31] believe that you have it and you shall
[1:29:34] have it. That's according to the
[1:29:35] scripture.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] That's the mystery of God in you. The
[1:29:47] hope of glory shining forth the baptism
[1:29:50] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:55] Now, and who is this MelzDC?
[1:29:58] Listen close. I think I've laid
[1:30:00] sufficient foundation.
[1:30:05] He talks about the sculptor hides a
[1:30:07] mask, puts a mask over his masterpiece.
[1:30:12] And he says, "All these things
[1:30:16] has been hid
[1:30:18] and is supposed to be revealed in this
[1:30:20] age."
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And now the Bible says that they would
[1:30:24] be revealed in the latter times.
[1:30:28] Listen very closely. They would be
[1:30:30] revealed
[1:30:32] because I'm carrying on. I'm not just
[1:30:34] saying has it been revealed. That's not
[1:30:37] just the point. The point is
[1:30:40] how does that affect me?
[1:30:43] Now what happens? It's been revealed.
[1:30:45] Yes. Oh, glory to God. I see it. My life
[1:30:48] is different. All kinds of things have
[1:30:50] happened. My family, my whatever more.
[1:30:52] Oh, it's been glorious.
[1:30:56] But now what? Oh, now we run into log
[1:31:00] jams. We run into disappointments. We
[1:31:03] run into things that we hear near and
[1:31:06] far and all kinds of things come our
[1:31:08] way. And maybe our plans are decimated.
[1:31:11] Oh, we thought this was going to happen.
[1:31:13] Oh, I thought it was going to be all a
[1:31:14] millennium when I came into the message.
[1:31:16] No. When you come into the promised
[1:31:17] land, the brother Brandham says that's
[1:31:19] when war starts.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Just read what happens. That's when war
[1:31:23] starts. Is war supposed to change you?
[1:31:25] No.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; You think I'm just preaching?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you absolute instruction. If
[1:31:33] this was my last message on earth, this
[1:31:35] is what I'd want you to hear. If you're
[1:31:37] defeated, if you become defeated
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; in a certain battle, are you to stop? Of
[1:31:42] course not.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; That's just when you get up
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Glory to God.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I'll have a greater victory the next
[1:31:51] time.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; This enemy, this very enemy, you can
[1:31:56] read it in the scripture. The very enemy
[1:31:58] that defeated Israel, Israel rose up
[1:32:00] again and destroyed them."
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] Oh my goodness, friends.
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I feel like a man of war.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; There's nothing on earth, I don't care
[1:32:14] what it is, nothing on earth can
[1:32:17] overcome the power that's been released
[1:32:19] upon the people. I'm so glad that I can
[1:32:23] say at this stage of my life, with so
[1:32:26] much of my life already passed, I'm so
[1:32:28] glad that I can say to the young when I
[1:32:30] was your age, I was serving him. Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And nothing has changed. I'm so glad
[1:32:36] that brother Brandham could say, "This
[1:32:37] is the same gospel I preached when I was
[1:32:39] just a boy."
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He never changed it. This
[1:32:43] God doesn't change.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; You think I'm too excited,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; friends? I tell you, I can dance all
[1:32:50] over this platform. I have such liberty
[1:32:52] in the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy. I'm so thrilled
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; with what God has done.
[1:33:08] It did me good. I didn't say anything to
[1:33:11] anyone else. I kept it as a secret. I
[1:33:13] didn't even say it to my wife. But I say
[1:33:15] it to you today
[1:33:18] when the Holy Spirit just spoke in my
[1:33:19] heart and said, "Challenge
[1:33:22] these people and especially these young
[1:33:24] people. challenge them to rise above
[1:33:27] just a normal average. All kinds of
[1:33:31] young couples, all kinds of brides and
[1:33:32] all kinds of grooms, lovely clothed and
[1:33:35] dressed in all of their array. All kinds
[1:33:37] of them come to the platform. I even
[1:33:39] said to John Sarah, perhaps even today,
[1:33:42] but not many will even last,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; let alone rise above the average. All
[1:33:47] kinds of them. We're not into just
[1:33:49] average church, average life, average
[1:33:52] home, average everything. This is an
[1:33:55] elect group.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Not because I said so, but because of
[1:33:59] what has been released.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Because the seals have been released.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, not because I just spoke
[1:34:07] that. Some might be offended in that.
[1:34:09] But not because I just spoke that, but
[1:34:11] because I can assure you that God
[1:34:15] Almighty has released things in this
[1:34:18] word that have been hidden all these
[1:34:20] years. And there is a, this is my theme,
[1:34:23] there is a power in that release.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; There's a power in the release.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; I can tell you what. If a tanker truck
[1:34:35] rolled over here at our corner and burst
[1:34:37] open and all kinds of costic and and
[1:34:41] dangerous fumes coming out of there,
[1:34:43] you'd have the police force and our
[1:34:45] brethren. You'd have ambulances and
[1:34:47] you'd have everything roaring in here
[1:34:48] with lights ablaze and evacuating us
[1:34:52] because there'd been a dangerous thing
[1:34:54] happen. That's that's you wouldn't have
[1:34:56] any choice about it. So get out.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I'm telling you that
[1:35:01] the life has been released and I'm
[1:35:03] saying get in.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Get in.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Get in where this life is. Get in where
[1:35:11] Satan can't come. Get in where he's
[1:35:13] sealed out and you're sealed in. You
[1:35:16] might say, "Is there such a place?"
[1:35:17] Absolutely.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you on the authority of
[1:35:21] God's word, I'm sealed in.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I couldn't even speak like this if I
[1:35:25] wasn't sealed in.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; And the devil is sealed out. And the
[1:35:28] doubt is sealed out. Hallelujah. To
[1:35:31] claude.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; It just rolls off my back like just so
[1:35:35] much water off the duck's back. All
[1:35:37] kinds of things. I stood before those
[1:35:40] people just with a few closing comments
[1:35:44] with the love but the urgency of the
[1:35:46] Holy Spirit and my voice trembling
[1:35:49] because not because I was emotionally
[1:35:51] moved but I was being so moved and
[1:35:54] challenged within my own heart
[1:35:57] and I looked around. There's my wife of
[1:36:00] 51 years and another few days sitting
[1:36:03] beside me
[1:36:05] and there was a grandson in the party
[1:36:10] and his wife sitting over there and
[1:36:13] their child and a granddaughter and her
[1:36:17] husband and their children and I looked
[1:36:20] around.
[1:36:22] What grace
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; do you think for a minute I would be the
[1:36:26] worst hypocrite on earth if I didn't
[1:36:28] stand before those precious young ladies
[1:36:30] and those precious young men and was
[1:36:32] able to say walk where I have walked
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; believe this word and you'll never be
[1:36:40] discouraged. You'll never, as the
[1:36:42] scripture says, you'll never be ashamed.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:51] I'm glad I can go back into any city
[1:36:53] I've ever lived. Brother Roy, Brother
[1:36:56] Bob, any city.
[1:36:58] I can speak to anybody in that city and
[1:37:01] I don't have to be ashamed of the gospel
[1:37:03] of Jesus Christ. We have nothing to be
[1:37:06] ashamed of. And you that feed upon this
[1:37:08] word, you'll have nothing to be ashamed
[1:37:10] of. And one day when you stand in the
[1:37:13] presence of God and this flesh is
[1:37:15] dropped aside, you won't be ashamed. The
[1:37:18] scripture says you won't be ashamed.
[1:37:22] That's what's been released upon you.
[1:37:24] That's what you have received. You will
[1:37:27] not be ashamed.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Can you just feature
[1:37:31] for a moment of coming and standing in
[1:37:34] the presence of the almighty holy God
[1:37:38] knowing
[1:37:40] you have believed on him whom he hath
[1:37:42] sent and you're not ashamed.
[1:37:46] I say thanks be to God.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's what's been released upon us.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; That's what's been released not of our
[1:37:55] goodness.
[1:37:57] Nothing that you have done or could do
[1:37:58] or I have done.
[1:38:01] You will not be ashamed.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret
[1:38:09] following every word
[1:38:11] that he has sent and believing it.
[1:38:15] And I'm going to close with this. I want
[1:38:16] to make a message. I'm not even hardly
[1:38:18] started in my service.
[1:38:24] But I would like to
[1:38:27] I'd like to encourage you say, "What do
[1:38:29] I do?"
[1:38:32] I took the
[1:38:34] I excused myself a little bit and took
[1:38:37] the opportunity.
[1:38:41] I didn't ask John and Sarah's consent
[1:38:44] but
[1:38:46] I said John
[1:38:49] you have achieved
[1:38:52] you have accepted some real challenges
[1:38:56] and a lot of people here probably don't
[1:38:57] know but it was I think it was announced
[1:39:02] probably here at church but he he wrote
[1:39:05] his master's in accounting at the age of
[1:39:08] 22
[1:39:10] and and received received his master's
[1:39:12] degree at 22 years old. And so I just
[1:39:15] said, "You're not afraid of challenges."
[1:39:19] And she has received some bachelor
[1:39:21] degree.
[1:39:23] As young as they are, I said, "You're
[1:39:24] not afraid of challenges."
[1:39:26] But I said, "Now, here's a challenge,
[1:39:30] and I don't want you to forget it, and I
[1:39:31] want you to take this scripture, and I
[1:39:33] want you to pin it on your fridge, and I
[1:39:34] want you to put it on your desk.
[1:39:36] Jonathan,
[1:39:37] be thou an example to the believers. Not
[1:39:43] to the unbelievers, but to the believers
[1:39:45] in godliness,
[1:39:47] in purity, in conversation.
[1:39:50] Be an example. Anybody can just live an
[1:39:53] average, but be thou an example.
[1:39:58] And it's a real challenge to us in this
[1:40:00] day that we're in. It's a real challenge
[1:40:03] because everything there is out there
[1:40:05] wants to reduce you down
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; and make you feel very average.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; We're not average.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, friends. It's not average.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; It's far beyond that. If I'm going to
[1:40:21] believe this, then I have to tell you
[1:40:27] a glorious church
[1:40:30] without spot or without wrinkle.
[1:40:34] You'll never do that on your own. It's
[1:40:36] it's him that's already done it. He's
[1:40:38] declared it. And so, what can you do
[1:40:41] practically?
[1:40:42] This is what you can do. And you'll
[1:40:45] never regret it.
[1:40:47] I would suggest you take the message
[1:40:48] that God has sent.
[1:40:54] Are you with me?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to look for the I'm going to
[1:41:08] look for the
[1:41:11] uh the the time that Brother Bram spoke
[1:41:13] to this man, and I want to read it for
[1:41:14] you.
[1:41:18] But excuse me now, but try to catch my
[1:41:21] heart.
[1:41:23] I ask myself,
[1:41:26] how does a man
[1:41:29] come into such favor with God?
[1:41:33] I would be so thrilled, Brother Roger.
[1:41:36] I'd be so thrilled, friends, if God
[1:41:39] would allow me that kind of privilege
[1:41:41] and that kind of favor just once in my
[1:41:43] life.
[1:41:46] to stand and be able to minister to a
[1:41:49] man or a woman
[1:41:52] and to just have such prophetical
[1:41:55] insight that raise their faith right up
[1:41:58] and stand right there in front and see
[1:42:01] maybe a cancer or see some marvelous
[1:42:05] transformation take place in their life
[1:42:07] if you could just seem to find that
[1:42:09] favor just once but you know it wasn't
[1:42:12] his doing
[1:42:14] it isn't anything that he did. God
[1:42:17] ordained, "I'm going to do this and you
[1:42:19] have nothing to say. You never drink or
[1:42:21] smoke or defile your body in any way.
[1:42:24] For when you're older, I have a work for
[1:42:25] you to do." And a young man who tried to
[1:42:28] drink and tried to smoke and God
[1:42:30] wouldn't allow it.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; I guess you folks know I led the woman
[1:42:37] who tried to get him to smoke to Christ.
[1:42:40] I've told you about it.
[1:42:42] I have her tape. It'll never be
[1:42:45] released, but we taped her testimony.
[1:42:49] And she took a picture that a lot of the
[1:42:50] believers have and they don't understand
[1:42:52] where it came from. It brother Brandham
[1:42:54] sent it to her and she pulled it out of
[1:42:56] her purse
[1:42:58] and held it. It was cut in a heart shape
[1:43:03] from Bill.
[1:43:06] She said, "I still love him."
[1:43:10] I said, "Do you know what he was?
[1:43:13] Did you know he was a prophet of God?"
[1:43:14] "No, she didn't." And we spoke to her
[1:43:17] about the ministry.
[1:43:19] She came into the service and I asked
[1:43:22] her if she'd like to receive this Jesus
[1:43:24] Christ that Brother Brandon preached.
[1:43:27] She said she would. He was able for me.
[1:43:30] She says, "I was the one that tried to
[1:43:31] get him to smoke
[1:43:36] and he wouldn't do it." What a
[1:43:38] remarkable thing to ever dream that
[1:43:41] coming from where I came from that I
[1:43:43] would sit in Florida with my wife in a
[1:43:46] chair and talk to the woman that brother
[1:43:48] Pam talked about a young girl trying to
[1:43:51] get him to smoke. I can tell you
[1:43:54] friends, this is what I'm saying as I'm
[1:43:56] closing.
[1:43:58] When I hear if I could just have it
[1:44:00] once, it would mean so much. We'll never
[1:44:03] experience that kind of a thing to that
[1:44:06] degree. It was for one man. It was a
[1:44:08] one-man ministry. But the next thing
[1:44:11] that we can do is fall under the favor
[1:44:15] of the God that was so pleased with that
[1:44:20] life and with what was spoken. I feel as
[1:44:24] though if I'm under the umbrella, if I'm
[1:44:26] under the banner of what God did and the
[1:44:30] vessel.
[1:44:33] Can I just treat you like a class for
[1:44:35] just a moment?
[1:44:41] Try to view God
[1:44:44] who he is and what he is and the being
[1:44:46] he is and the power he has and the
[1:44:48] holiness and all. Try to view him for a
[1:44:50] moment and in that mind he says I'm
[1:44:53] going to hold some things. I'm going to
[1:44:54] hold I'm going to keep it a secret. It's
[1:44:56] going to be hidden. I'm going to seal it
[1:45:00] and no nobody Lucifer won't find out.
[1:45:04] None of his archangels will find out.
[1:45:07] None of the angels that fell with him
[1:45:09] will ever find out. I'm going to hold
[1:45:11] them.
[1:45:13] And yet prophets came and God anointed
[1:45:16] them for a season, for a certain time.
[1:45:17] And they could see that there was
[1:45:19] something. Oh, and Peter said they even
[1:45:22] they looked they desired to look into
[1:45:24] the things that they were seeing. And
[1:45:27] God held some things that the apostles
[1:45:29] never saw and the great early church
[1:45:32] never saw. And the martyrs knew there
[1:45:36] was something that was so real and so
[1:45:38] marvelous that it was a joy to go and be
[1:45:41] burnt
[1:45:43] in the martyrdom. There was something
[1:45:44] that was so glorious. It was so real to
[1:45:46] them. And God kept holding the secret,
[1:45:49] holding the secret and holding the
[1:45:50] secret. And finally
[1:45:52] come the time, the season, and the son,
[1:45:57] the soom is going to come near to the
[1:46:00] earth. So near. And he's going to come,
[1:46:02] brother DDA,
[1:46:04] into a humble vessel, an adopted, saved,
[1:46:08] and adopted son and going to take and
[1:46:11] bypass his mind and speak out of his
[1:46:14] mouth those things that have been sealed
[1:46:16] in the mind of God from the foundation
[1:46:18] and before the foundation of the earth
[1:46:21] is going to speak it. And that word is
[1:46:22] going to go out, be blasted out. And
[1:46:25] some will say it thundered. And others
[1:46:27] say, "No, it was must have been an
[1:46:28] angel. It must have been something
[1:46:29] else." or or we think that he's a crazy
[1:46:31] man or whatever more but there's a group
[1:46:33] of people that their heart got warmed
[1:46:36] and said this is something special I
[1:46:38] don't understand it but I identify
[1:46:42] myself with the God that could do these
[1:46:44] things and the God that has spoken these
[1:46:46] things and the God that knows all these
[1:46:49] secrets that God knows my secret
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; and God
[1:46:59] I identif ify myself
[1:47:03] because I feel and believe with
[1:47:05] everything that's in me that you spoke
[1:47:08] these things
[1:47:10] and I might not be capable of any great
[1:47:12] work or any great achievement but the
[1:47:16] very least I can do is say I believe
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart
[1:47:24] and whether you send me any special
[1:47:27] vindication or whether you send me any
[1:47:29] special assurance. That's not necessary.
[1:47:32] You don't have to do anything special
[1:47:34] for me. You don't have to give me any
[1:47:35] special gift. You don't have to do any
[1:47:37] special. You don't have to give me any
[1:47:38] special blessing. I want to tell you, I
[1:47:40] believe what you have said.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And I say to you, you're blessed.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You're blessed. And you're children.
[1:47:49] You're children of You've been birthed
[1:47:52] of what has been released in this
[1:47:54] season.
[1:47:57] And that makes you very different
[1:48:01] people.
[1:48:04] The apostles and the disciples
[1:48:07] were birthed under what God was
[1:48:09] releasing at that season. And that's
[1:48:12] what made them who they were. A very
[1:48:15] special group of people. And the world
[1:48:17] knew they were different. The world knew
[1:48:19] they were odd. Like the little maid when
[1:48:22] Peter was standing warming his hands.
[1:48:23] Aren't you one of them?
[1:48:26] Your speech betrays you. You speak like
[1:48:28] a believer. You have a different
[1:48:30] language.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I say rejoice.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And again, I say rejoice.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; That God has been so merciful and so
[1:48:43] graceful to us.
[1:48:45] Hallelujah.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you people.
[1:48:50] God bless us.
[1:48:54] I want to thank him. I want to come
[1:48:56] before his throne with thanksgiving.
[1:49:00] Oh father,
[1:49:04] what grace is this
[1:49:07] marvelous grace
[1:49:10] of our risen Lord and our blessed Lord.
[1:49:13] marvelous grace that you've shown to us.
[1:49:17] Oh God, to those that may be streaming
[1:49:20] right now in in Switzerland, in Norway.
[1:49:22] Greetings to them in New Zealand and in
[1:49:26] Europe and Germany and Netherlands and
[1:49:28] wherever, Lord. And down in Zimbabwe and
[1:49:30] in Congo
[1:49:32] to the others who are just with us at
[1:49:34] this time, heart to heart and attribute
[1:49:38] to attribute.
[1:49:40] Oh God, we stand under this glorious
[1:49:43] banner of the revelation of Jesus
[1:49:46] Christ. Truly the son of man has been
[1:49:49] revealed. You have been revealed.
[1:49:53] And now Lord, I want to offer
[1:49:57] thanks from the depths of my soul
[1:50:00] for those this group of people that you
[1:50:03] have allowed and privileged
[1:50:07] myself to walk with and for us to walk
[1:50:09] together.
[1:50:12] Oh, how glorious, how marvelous it is.
[1:50:15] And Lord, I pray that you will keep
[1:50:17] making yourself more known.
[1:50:21] We hunger after you. We hunger and
[1:50:24] thirst after righteousness.
[1:50:27] I pray, Father, that you'll take and
[1:50:29] quicken this body of people.
[1:50:32] That you'll allow the cleansing flame
[1:50:34] and fire of the Holy Spirit.
[1:50:37] Remove anything that would be a
[1:50:39] hindrance to you, Lord, in our lives.
[1:50:42] And I pray you'll move us, oh God, into
[1:50:44] such a place of daily communion with
[1:50:46] you. I pray that the events of the world
[1:50:49] and of those things of our daily lives
[1:50:51] and our daily activities will not
[1:50:53] prevent us. Don't allow us to be caught
[1:50:56] up, oh God, with just this this passing
[1:50:59] day, this passing world, this passing
[1:51:02] age. Don't allow us to be caught up in
[1:51:04] it, oh God. May we be caught up in you.
[1:51:08] I pray that we will have such a
[1:51:11] marvelous relationship
[1:51:14] with you, the living word.
[1:51:17] Oh, glorious Christ,
[1:51:20] glorious Christ,
[1:51:22] we thank you.
[1:51:24] I ask your blessings now in Jesus
[1:51:28] Christ's name.
[1:51:31] Amen.
[1:51:34] Amen.
[1:51:37] I wonder if we could sing, Brother Ryan.
[1:51:39] Beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ.
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:45] Beautiful
[1:51:47] Christ.
[1:51:50] Beautiful
[1:51:53] Christ.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just worship him now?
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; My life
[1:52:01] is he
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:06] beautiful.
[1:52:13] of Christ,
[1:52:17] mine
[1:52:19] ever more he shall be. Let's sing it
[1:52:23] again as we stand to our feet.
[1:52:28] Beautiful
[1:52:30] Christ.
[1:52:33] Beautiful
[1:52:36] Christ.
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:40] My eyes.
[1:52:49] Beautiful
[1:52:52] cry.
[1:52:54] Beautiful
[1:52:57] Christ
[1:53:00] my
[1:53:02] ever more he shall be.
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:12] I want to have the congregation
[1:53:16] join with me once again in worship of
[1:53:18] this these phrases this songwriter has
[1:53:22] written.
[1:53:25] I would like every mouth to be open with
[1:53:28] praise if you would.
[1:53:31] Certainly not for me.
[1:53:34] And I let you know it is directly to
[1:53:37] him.
[1:53:38] Don't withhold what's due to him
[1:53:42] and say it and sing it as you would in
[1:53:46] honor
[1:53:47] of this glorious Christ and see what he
[1:53:49] shall do.
[1:53:52] And if you have a particular need this
[1:53:55] morning, I can tell you right where you
[1:53:57] are. Whether you're present in the
[1:54:00] sanctuary or not present, maybe you're
[1:54:02] in some other place at some other part
[1:54:04] of the world. I believe and I declare to
[1:54:08] you that he will come near as you enter
[1:54:12] into a relationship of worship. As you
[1:54:14] just begin to honor him, to respect him,
[1:54:18] and to worship him, his presence will
[1:54:21] come near to you. And your prophet said
[1:54:24] in his presence, the supernatural is
[1:54:28] happening. You don't have to buy it. You
[1:54:31] don't have to do some big thing. All you
[1:54:33] have to do is just seek to come into his
[1:54:36] presence.
[1:54:38] Seek to have this favor with him.
[1:54:44] Father,
[1:54:46] help these people now. I pray
[1:54:49] to enter into this secret chamber, this
[1:54:52] special place.
[1:54:54] I ask that you'll come so near.
[1:54:58] Their hearts will be so filled and
[1:55:00] they'll just want to start to burst open
[1:55:03] until their mouth begins to express, oh
[1:55:05] God, what their soul is experiencing.
[1:55:08] Grant it, Lord. Granted I pray in Jesus
[1:55:12] Christ's name.
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:18] Beautiful
[1:55:20] Christ.

[2:05:24] Brother David was in the university in
[2:05:26] Melbourne on Melbourne, Australia.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Coast,
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; huh?
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Gold coast.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Near Melbourne.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Close to Brisbane.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Brisbane.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Brisbane.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Brisbane. Okay. I always keep saying
[2:05:36] Melbourne. Brisbane. Australia. But it's
[2:05:39] in Australia anyway.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; You were what, 15?
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. 16.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; In the university.
[2:05:50] in university at 15 years old.
[2:05:53] Mom and dad in in Africa and he was in
[2:05:56] Brisbane
[2:05:58] and said every time he'd come here
[2:06:02] got to do something, wouldn't he? Then
[2:06:05] he get back there and you know it's just
[2:06:07] uh the world and education, all the rest
[2:06:10] of it. I just felt to have him pray this
[2:06:13] morning and to bring him before you and
[2:06:15] let you know. Pray for David because he
[2:06:18] has he'd have a good future.
[2:06:22] But he's he's laid that on the altar.
[2:06:25] Said, "I'd like to just be a blessing to
[2:06:26] the bride of Jesus Christ. He could go
[2:06:28] places in the world. He has the
[2:06:30] intelligence to go someplace, but he
[2:06:33] decided to lay it on the altar." I say,
[2:06:36] "God will bless you, David. Amen. We'll
[2:06:38] remember you in prayer." And every time
[2:06:39] he's come forward for prayer, it's not
[2:06:41] because, you know, it's some problem or
[2:06:44] something else. I always want to be
[2:06:46] filled with the Holy Spirit. I just want
[2:06:48] to get closer to God. And I tell you
[2:06:50] what, God saw you do it every time,
[2:06:52] Brother David. Amen. God bless you.
[2:06:55] Amen. Shake hands with one another,
[2:06:57] greet one another, and we'll see you
