Why don't we sing There is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. as our brother Mike is preparing. Amen. We just want to continue right on with the worship. Amen.

[Music] Lord, there is none like you. No one else. No one else can touch my heart like you do. And I could serve &gt;&gt; for all eternity, Lord, and find that there is none like you. There is none. There is none like you. [Music] Oh, no one else can touch my heart like you do. Like you serve for all eternity. Lord, oh, and find that there is none like. Amen. Sing it once more in worship. For there is none, there is none like you. No one else. No one else can touch my heart like you do. [Music] Oh, and I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find that there is none like you. [Music] little bit of a confession to make. It's hard to get up here. And the more you're out, the harder it is. I was coming down this back hallway here last last Sunday. I just thought I sing a song and uh it didn't transpire and brother Michael Andes I just said to tell tell Ryan that uh you know I'll have one ready in the next week or so. And so on Wednesday, uh, um, Brother Derek pointed over like that. Brother Mike, we got that song ready. And, uh, Brother Ken reminded me as I'm going down the hall here, he says, man, you had a shot fired. Are you ready yet? I don't know how he missed me, but it wasn't my turn. Anyway, I just uh [Music] pray you be blessed and [Music] pressing through this world of darkness, a pilgrim in its place. I dare not stop a single moment. Weary of the pace, striving ever onward, upward, I rest upon my knees to thank him for his guiding hand and pray, Lord, strengthen me. Looking back, I see the cross where he paid the price for sin. Just ahead, the amber light. His voice calls from within. You're not asked to set the pace or blaze uncharted land. Just stay in line and follow course. My footprints in the sand. Many I fear have altered course since starting on this way. Turned aside by cares of life or pleasures of the day. Keep me Lord that I lear not though temptors seek to sway. Draw me ever onward upward as I press this rugged way. Looking back, I see the cross where he paid the price for sin. Just ahead, the amber light. His voice calls from within. You're not asked to set the pace or blaze uncharted land to stay in line and follow close my footprints in the sand. You're not as to set the pace or blaze uncharted land. Just stay in line and follow close my footprints in the sand. Just stay in line and follow close my footprints in the sand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Mike. Amen. We're going to sing When I See the Blood. We're going to invite our brother Chris and sister Held a Christ friend to come have a family dedication. Amen. Maybe as they come, why don't we just sing this, we'll turn the service to our brother Tom for the dedication. When I see the blood. When I see the blood. When I see the blood, I will pass. I will pass over you. When I see the blood. Oh, when I see the blood. Oh, when I I see the blood. And I see the pass over you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus is coming. All will be there. eats justly his duty blood of the lamb and I will pass will pass over you. Oh, when I see the blood, when I see the blood, when I see the blood, I will pass. I will pass over you. [Music] Brother Chris and sister Hilda Celikum are standing here with their family and I thought it was very appropriate that we would sing a little chorus like that for the family. We not only have a baby dedication, Josiah, but we also have a family dedication of the Celicums. And I and I believe that's very appropriate uh for a dad's wish and desire for his children, for his wife, and for his children. How many believe that we're in an Exodus hour? &gt;&gt; So, this is very appropriate, isn't it? &gt;&gt; God dealing with dad, God dealing with the family, realizing that there will be a lamp for a home. And God has given a great revelation to brother Chris. And by that revelation, he's brought his family under the blood. &gt;&gt; What a protection that is, brother Chris. &gt;&gt; What a protection that is. But in his arms is their new addition to this great family, Josiah. And Josiah means Jehovah that heals. But standing here are two also fine young men. And we have Jonathan and Joshua. And Jonathan is 14 years old and means Jehovah has given. And the next son is Joshua. Jehovah is salvation. &gt;&gt; And the third son has come and the name is Jehovah Heals. So I I I I see uh a tremendous pattern here &gt;&gt; that Jehovah's given salvation &gt;&gt; and he's the healer of the family &gt;&gt; body, spirit, and soul. Brother Chris Josiah, the Bible says here in 2 Kings 23 and 25 said there were no king before him that turned to the Lord with all his heart &gt;&gt; and with all his soul and all his might according to all the laws of Moses. Neither after him arose there any like him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. healing Jehovah or healer. Brother Bram said in the midst of shalom, brother Chris, sister Hilda, he said, "I don't know." He said, "I don't know how he's going to do it, but his spoken word will be a vindicated when the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings." And the healing part, there will not be a physical healing as you think as somebody's got a sickness, but it will be taken away from them. That's what he's doing now. Jehovah, our healer. But the whole creation will change. This mortal will put on immortality and old age will jump into youth. Where did brother Brandham say that? He said in the message shalom. We have a protection under the blood. A daddy has put the blood on the door. He's put it over his family. Jesus Christ, the bleeding lamb. Revelation 5 has come forward. And brother Chris has taken that revelation and put it over his family and has desired then the very life of that word to be his protection, to be his strength, to be his salvation, to be his healing. &gt;&gt; For God has given you a lamb. &gt;&gt; May God bless your home, Brother Chris. Brother Chris, the moment that Brother Chris has received this message, there's always two kinds of people. There's the givers and there's the takers. Well, I want to say to you in the presence of God that this man's a giver. &gt;&gt; He's been giving to the church, given his life, he's given his family. He's given his all. &gt;&gt; May God bless this home. &gt;&gt; God bless this child. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our dear precious heavenly father, when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. credling within my arms a life that you have blessed our dear brother Chris and sister he pray for this child &gt;&gt; that God that he would jump from this body into a new body &gt;&gt; that will be his promise Lord &gt;&gt; that father as he's raised under the sound of the gospel may he be a tribute may he be a compliment may he be a blessing to the family. And Father, I'm praying for this child that you will keep your hand upon him &gt;&gt; from a very young age and that Jehovah that heals, our Jesus Christ, our healer, will ever guide and keep protect Lord. Keep your hand upon him and may he be blessed in this home as his mother and father will be used to speak of that name. That name above all names, our lovely Lord Jesus. Bless this child as we dedicate him now to you in this little dedication service. Lord, may there be a wall of fire around him &gt;&gt; keeping him under the very presence of Jesus Christ. bless this child now in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May you join with me now as we dedicate the family. And when I see the blood, brother Chris stands here with sister Hilda, their sons, Lord Jonathan, Joshua, now Josiah. May the circle never be broken. &gt;&gt; May this family, Lord, serve you with all their mind, all their soul, all their strength. Lord, &gt;&gt; may the grace of God go before them always, Lord. May they be their credit to the gospel. May the glory of God rest upon them, Lord, as they have come this morning to be dedicated, not just as a a little baby here, but as a family. &gt;&gt; May it be a tribute to the gospel. May your glory be seen upon them. &gt;&gt; And Father, as those that will come into their presence, whether it be in their home, &gt;&gt; by their way, may they sense the very glory of God. Would you use them to further the kingdom? Lord, as you bless Brother Chris, grant to him wisdom and leadership, Lord, and Sister Hilda, as you draw her closer to you, the boys. May you blanket them with your presence. We dedicate this family now to you for the glory of God. Bless them in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Is it true? Amen. We're going to invite the choir to come and sing for us just before brother Biscll comes. As they come, why don't we sing All to Jesus, I surrender. Amen. As a choir, why don't you come make yourselves ready? Oh, all to Jesus [Music] I surrender all to him. I freely give. Oh, and I will ever love and trust him in his presence. Daily live. Oh, I surrender all. [Music] Yes, I surrender all [Music] to thee, my blessed savior. I surrender. &gt;&gt; Let's sing the second verse nausea prayer. Oh to Jesus. All to Jesus for I surrender as holy as is me I un worthy pleasures all forsake. Lord save me. Take me Jesus. Take me now for I surrender. I surrender all to you. I surrender all. Yes. All to thee. My blessed Savior died. Surrender. Sing it again. I surrender all. Oh, I surrender. I surrender all. I surrender all. All Lord, all to thee my my blessed Savior. I surrender all. is going to sing a song that I've enjoyed since I was just a teenager. Always wanted to do this on my heart the last few weeks called Holy Is Your Name. The words are very simple. We're going to have them on the screen for you. And I just invite you to enter in and sing along with us as we just prepare our hearts for the receiving of the word this morning. [Music] I love you, Lord, [Music] with all of my heart. I love you Lord [Music] with all of my soul. Let all that is within me cry holy is your name. and all that is within me cry holy is your name.

Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't he worthy? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Choir. [Music] Praise his name. Wonderful Lord Jesus. How appropriate. We're so thankful for the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Last week, I don't know what it meant to you, but I just felt from the morning before the service even to have brother Mike Gier come up and pray. And I think brother Michael you didn't expect that the Holy Spirit would just you know start brew moving and breathing over the whole congregation and the marvelous thing about it is that is that was the scripture and I and they sung a new song. See, when he took the book, then they sung a new song. &gt;&gt; And that indeed was a new song. I don't believe you've ever done that before, Brother Michael. That wasn't you. It was God, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, and the sound in the auditorium was just uh something that put chills down your back. And I tell you what, you know, when we give ourselves and yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit, and the thing is, you might do something unusual. We don't do it unusual to be unusual. &gt;&gt; We do it because he's worthy. &gt;&gt; He's absolutely worthy of anything that you can offer him today. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Well, I certainly enjoyed the song and the worship and the dedication. So, we're going to just have you join with me in prayer once more and then we'll go to the word. How lovely you are, Lord Jesus. How lovely you are. There isn't enough words in our vocabulary. We could say with the songwriter, oh for a thousand tongues, then even a thousand tongues would be inadequate to speak of your glory, your majesty. Lord, these puny, insignificant minds that we have today. They need to be illuminated. And I pray you'll expand the boundaries of our thought. I pray that you'll cut all the ties to this natural material world. I pray that you will cause us, oh God, to truly rise into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. May we peer into the beyond, oh God. May we peer into our eternal home, Father. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, that you'll take absolute control of the service. And as we have felt your presence in your nearness, now I pray you'll anoint me, oh God, to say what needs to be said. I pray that the hearers, Lord, will be quickened by the spirit of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate ourselves to you now. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you, musicians. If you would turn in your Bibles, please, I'd like to read from the Old Testament in the book of Ruth, 2 chapter, and we'll read from verse 8 to 12. And we'll read some verses out of Revelation 5 as well. And this is the third part and perhaps the last part of the lamb takes the book and speaks. So we'll read from Ruth, the book of Ruth first, chapter 2, verse 8. Then said Boaz unto Ruth, "Hearest thou not, my daughter. Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens. and let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them. Have I not charged the young men, that they shall not touch thee? And when thou art a thirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have have drawn. Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath it hath fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband, and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come to unto a people which thou kneest not here to far. The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the Lord of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings thou art come to trust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read then in Revelation the 5th chapter also, please. Uh we'll read the first nine verses. And I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders sth unto me, weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, these are four living creatures, four living ones. And in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation. God bless you as you have your seats. The reason for reading these two scriptures is because they both relate to the same event and in the breach which is just the breach which is just prior to the seals. Now I'd like I said last Sunday or last Wednesday and I really I won't be coming to this subject I don't believe again. So I would like I would like to deposit in you things that you can really ponder and think about. First I would just ask you do you believe your name was in the book? &gt;&gt; That's an important question. And if it if your name was in the book, then God has already sent this messenger who's come and gone uh to declare uh and to bring you the word that will provide you the life that was written in the book. &gt;&gt; And that literally is the very thing that called you. You felt called. You felt drawn when you heard this message or this call or whatever title you want to give it. You felt that pull. You felt that drawing. That was because the lamb was claiming you &gt;&gt; and confirming, I have bought you and you're not your own. &gt;&gt; You belong to me. And now the book of life become the lamb's book of life. the fifth chapter of uh Revelation and the book of Ruth both they are transitional they are trans transitional events that are happening and I want to make that a little more clear now because I I I I decided I would start right off with waters that I'm swimming in and I just uh I want to just present it to you in the seals. Brother Brandham preaches the breach and then launches into the seals first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh and had questions and answers between the sixth and the seventh and the seventh seal. Then there's a junction also between the sixth and seventh seal in the Bible which is the seventh chapter and the 144 calling of the 144,000 and then the eighth chapter of Revelation simply starts out and says that and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Now, brother Brandham, excuse me, he says there are times when it almost would appear as though the seventh seal isn't opened. Uh, I would say that I believe that it's open because we know things about it now that we never knew in the past. &gt;&gt; But perhaps not completely fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And so we can say then he would say, well, we know it's not open. And in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He said God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knowed nothing about it. Even the angels didn't understand it. See, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under our seventh mystery, when the seventh seal was opened, there was silence. Jesus, when he was on earth, they wanted to know when he would come. And he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen. See God has all of this to himself. It's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbidden to write it. see the coming of the Lord. That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet or how he will come and when he will come. It's a good thing that he doesn't. Now, it might sound like a conflicting uh paragraph, but it's not really if you think that we know we we didn't know previously that the seventh seal is referring to his coming. So that you know but it is it is a process and it's the process that we don't understand. Excuse me. Now there's silence between Malachi and Matthew &gt;&gt; 400 years. &gt;&gt; That's silence. &gt;&gt; So we could say there's silence between the Old Testament and the New Testament. There's silence between. Why there's silence, we don't know. God's kept that to himself. But it is transitional because the next thing that's going to happen from Malachi over to Matthew is Elijah's going to be on the scene who's the forerunner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can say it's silence, but it's not inactivity. &gt;&gt; And that's an important statement. God can be silent, but it doesn't mean nothing's happening. The most important things can be happening in silence. &gt;&gt; We make a lot of racket doing something and and brother Brandham says one place and God draws up maybe billions of tons of water in total silence just with the sun shining on the earth &gt;&gt; and he just draws up all this water from the oceans and everything. It's a huge thing. We're glad he does. We get some rain. Maybe we're not so glad. But anyway, we got a lot here. Uh so it doesn't mean there's inactivity. So there's silence in the opening of the seventh seal doesn't mean nothing's happening. Oh well, there's silence. So, you know, I guess there's nothing happening. No, the probably the most important things in the in the world are happening. And so the transition from law to grace, &gt;&gt; what a great thing that was. the transition from Malachi to John the Baptist in a short short ministry but his concluded it's a transition here comes John the Baptist and people start getting baptized never were baptized before and he introduces and he he says behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world what kind of a transition is that that's in his first coming but who knew he was coming in the in the time that he was being uh formed in the womb of of Mary the Virgin and then being birthed and lived for another 30 years and another three and a half years and uh only a handful of people knew who he was and only a only a very few had the revelation of truly who he was. So some saw him as a prophet, some saw him as a good man, some saw him as a great teacher, some saw him as a carpenter's son, and they had all a whole array of things about him and they had not I would say that whatever that was, God kept that sealed and they still didn't realize who he was. Just a handful of people. Now I was I have been really looking into uh into the book of Ruth. I've been reading it and reading it because in the in the uh in the message of the breach, brother Brandham goes back to the book of Ruth because that is where Boaz was doing the redemptive work and I was very curious and interested and I just kept pouring over it and pouring over it and pouring over it and reading it prayerfully and when I just seem to you come to a log jam but I don't stop at that. I just keep looking to God to see uh because when you have a prophet turning to it, you know that there's something there. So, I wanted to see the first things that Boaz said to Ruth. And as he moved forward towards his redemptive work before he took her to be his wife, I want to see what was what precluded that. And then so we have it prior to him taking her and when he actually took her. I I compare that because it's perfect to comparing it to when the lamb took the book because it was your name that was in the book and you were destined to become his wife &gt;&gt; and he took the book and Boaz took Ruth and both are the same thing. He didn't. When he took Ruth, he turned her that watch the transition. He turned her from a Moabitete to an Israelite. &gt;&gt; When he took her, he turned her from a widow to a married woman. &gt;&gt; When he took her, he took her from a barren a barren woman to one who was pregnantated with his seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't suppose anyone probably realized and I found it very very interesting as far as the scriptures concerned. I'm certain that's not the last words that Boaz spoke to her. But in the scripture, it is the typing of the redemption work. And and and Boaz does not speak to her or in in the record of the Bible. I'm speaking in the record after he took her to wife. From there it's silence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is the coming Christ is coming &gt;&gt; from uh from the redemptive work which is being reflected in Boaz to the king. &gt;&gt; Revelation the fifth chapter is going that's why it's a closed book in revelation five. It's going from the redemption, he's redeeming you, me. He's also obtaining himself a wife. There's a transition. And through the bride of Jesus Christ because that's the conclusion of his his act as the redeemer. And then he comes now on the scene as king. &gt;&gt; And he goes to the Jews as king. So we are living in if you believe the scripture and believe what the prophet has said we are in a transition period &gt;&gt; and where we are in the transition period we do not know alto together but I can tell you there will be a time it'll be the last service preached as far as this message is concerned but will not be the last service they will continue on having services continuing on having altar calls continuing on singing and choir such as we had Today we'll all they'll all be we won't I trust we won't I'm saying that in faith but they'll still go on worshiping and still go on and the prophet said thinking they're getting saved. &gt;&gt; So that is that is after that's way far in the transition period and and you have to understand we are not going to have the Jesus that is so much uh put forward in the religious world. I think the religious world has missed the mark completely &gt;&gt; and they missed it certainly when they turned down the very messenger God sent to them. &gt;&gt; So it's a transition period and uh and there's good reason why God is silent about it. Now you know some marvelous things take place. When I said that there's silence, it doesn't mean that nothing's happening. Now, I hope you understand uh you mothers that have had children and you mothers and fathers when your wife has got that little infant within her and they'll go down to the hospital and with the technology they have today, they can put headphones on you. And I I had never experienced it before until it was uh with uh brother Marco and Sharon. And Sharon has these three children within her. And we went down to children's hospital. They put headphones on us. And here are these little creatures. It just so incredible. And they put and they put the move the instrument over one and they know exactly where to move it. They're watching the monitor and move it over the other and I'm hearing kath and I can scarcely believe that that little thing can make that much noise. But soon as I take the headphones off it's total silence. &gt;&gt; But something's happening. &gt;&gt; Something's actually happening. &gt;&gt; And there is and and then there's the next one. and they measure exactly the amount and the intensity of it and the frequency of it and everything else. You talk about things going on. &gt;&gt; So you might think in the kingdom of God, well, we're going to church and we're here in Bible way and we're going to have a preach or we're going to have someone preach and so on so forth. Let me tell you something, friends. In the realm, there's a whole lot more going on than what you're hearing. It might just be a kathump kathump kathump to you, but something's forming. &gt;&gt; Something's happening. &gt;&gt; And he's going from redemption from redeemer to king. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you, though we may fail in a lot of areas, that will never fail. &gt;&gt; He's gone. He's on his way. That's why the messenger came. He sent this messenger to announce to you &gt;&gt; that he's going from redeemer to king. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, that's kind of a start where I feel to feel to perhaps go. So, I'm interested in what the lamb says and I will perhaps speak a little bit more about that uh uh this morning in this final message. So now Boaz as the kinsman redeemer of no Naomi got Ruth uh as a gentile bride. Now to some of you this is very very elementary but then there's uh uh perhaps people who have heard it for the first time or people on the internet that are streaming or young people that are are hearing it maybe at a time now that means more to them. Now, brother Ben Brandham said about this uh book, he said it's the abstract title deed to eternal life and your name and all that your name represents was in that book. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The record of life by your natural birth because that is the book of life and which what it signifies and this him taking the book signifies the removal of all that you inherited by your natural birth. &gt;&gt; Now in the invisible union you've heard this before and just please I'm not going to say forgive me but I I'm I'm going to say I feel inspired. I'm not speaking from notes of Wednesday or from notes of last Sunday or previous notes. I go all pouring over it and prayerfully what God would have for this meeting for this time &gt;&gt; and for those of you that are here. So he said now your old book and you want to say my old book is gone with your old union. Thank God we had an old union that's gone. and your name has been transferred. And I say, "Thank God our name has been transferred." He said, "Do you mean to tell me that my old book?" And he breaks it. He said, "God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness." And I want to say, "Praise be to God." That there's a part of our life and he knew exactly what to put in the sea of his forgetfulness. And if you want to hang on to it, that's up to you. But I would say that's your worst mistake. &gt;&gt; We I'm thank people. What's the sea of God's forgetfulness? Quite frankly, I don't care &gt;&gt; as long as he says it's in the sea of his forgetfulness. That's what's important to us today. &gt;&gt; It's in the sea of his forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before God. I'm glad it's not just a preacher saying that. I'm glad it's someone who declared the power of God, the pillar of fire in attendance with it. I like to have the supernatural in attendance, knowing that the supernatural was with him and he could say, "You stand perfectly before God." That does something for us. &gt;&gt; Your name is now in the new book, not the book of life, &gt;&gt; but the lamb's book of life. And that is why he said also this is the most sublime act the most sublime act that your sins and everything you inherited all the weaknesses frailties and idiosyncrasies and complexes and everything that you inherited all the iniquity knowing and he said knowing to do right and not to do it all iniquity. The fact that he could take that and remove that and put it in the sea of your his for his forgetfulness to me that is remarkable and that has to be the most sublime act. Not the book of life but the lamb's book of life. What the lamb redeemed not the old book of your old your natural union but your new bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. your marriage certificate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold." &gt;&gt; Not your natural germ that was in your forefathers, but your true eternal germ. &gt;&gt; I'm claiming that. &gt;&gt; I'm claiming that everything that we look at, we see ourselves uh you know in as humans. We see ourselves as humans. We all have our weaknesses and frailties and whatever more. But I'm so thankful whether we see the whether we see the evidence and the full evidence. We say, "Well, I'm I'm saved. You know, I quit drinking or quit smoking and quit this and quit that and all the rest of it." There's a lot of good people in the world. There's a lot of people that don't do those things. And that's not the evidence we're looking for. We're looking for a life that lives above &gt;&gt; the life of this world &gt;&gt; and that is our possession. He said in the breach, excuse me, please. The abstract title deed to eternal life means it it your life is searched all the way back to its beginning. &gt;&gt; And it didn't begin with Adam. It began with our heavenly parent, &gt;&gt; our father which are in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when sin has been confessed, he said it searched all the way back. And when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ, it gives an abstract right straight back to the creator again. &gt;&gt; That's where it went back to &gt;&gt; to the creator. What was in the creator's mind when he saw on down in centuries? You say, "Well, it's a long time." No, it's not a long time. To God, a thousand years as a day, and even with with God, there is no time. He's eternal. There's no beginning. There's no end with God. You maybe can't grasp that, but that is the truth. I can't grasp that. There's no beginning or end with God. And so God, your life has come straight back to him. You, he is the, he's the author of your life. And what he intended for you and I is not the life that we have here now. That's why he's going to destroy the enemy. He's going to take every sin that is imposed upon his children. And the prophet said he's going to nail that right back on the author of sin, who Satan himself You say, "Well, do you want to sin?" No, I don't want to sin. I don't want to have unbelief. I don't want these things. If you were asked, "Do you want to go uh and and live on earth? Do you want to fight your way? Do you want to battle your way through life and all of its burdens and all of its things and and and you want to struggle with the flesh?" You'd say, "No, preserve me from that. I don't want that." But he didn't ask you about that. God sent you here in the midst of the even now. God sent you here in this Leodysian age in this very vile, dark, wicked age. He sent you here, but he didn't send you here and then leave you powerless. And I'm going to be coming to it. He gave us power &gt;&gt; to live in this life &gt;&gt; and to be victorious. and the things that we fail in and the things that Satan imposes upon us. God knows that and that he's not your enemy only. He's God's enemy. &gt;&gt; And God's going to take his enemy and the thing that his enemy did to his children and he's going to make him responsible for the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Now, you need to accept that. Now, there's three different species around the throne. We read Revelation 5. There's three different species. That is a quote out of the Revelation series. And the first at this throne is four living creatures. Outside of that is 24 elders sitting on their thrones. And around this this great host of angels around the throne. He said there everyone different one from the other there is angels, elders and living creatures. Now for for you that are accustomed to studies and as accustomed to studying and your school of halls of learning and so on, there's three species around this throne and and and now this scene is very very important to you because you're involved. &gt;&gt; You are very much involved. This happened God didn't do this for himself. He did this for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So these and in the in the book of revelation which is a book of symbols. It's filled with symbols. There are two uh there are there is the word which in the English is beasts and you'll find it several times. There's four beasts and then it'll say beasts. And there's two different words in the Greek for beasts. And one is like a wild animal, untameable. You cannot tame it. It's a wild beast and it always represents the evil part. The other is zoo. Z O N or Z O N which is a living creature. And that always is on the on the on the sight of God. So and and the reason why the word beast is used is because the beast in the scripture always represents power. &gt;&gt; So it's a power whether God gives you power. &gt;&gt; Or it's a power whether Satan exercises power. &gt;&gt; So one is a power of darkness and the other is the power of light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. ones of power. And as civilization has moved all through the centuries, Satan has through civilization and developing up to Satan's Eden, he has moved in with all kinds of uh uh, you know, been waves of of change and things that have happened all through, you know, we've had uh we've had this kind of revolution and this kind of war and struggles and all of these things. And don't say they aren't powers. They are powers, &gt;&gt; but they're evil powers &gt;&gt; because they brought slavery and calamity and bondage and all kinds of hideous things happening right now while you're sitting here peacefully. There's people rioting by the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands because they're wanting to achieve freedom or democracy or something. Sure. &gt;&gt; And there was uh you know the time of the Renaissance and then we've had the time of the Inquisition and multitudes and here we have uh uh Second World War. Many of you have, you know, you've read about it. Some of you have perhaps lived through it. I understand and this is uh I understand by by the uh not scientific but the actual statistics that there was 54 million almost the double population of of Canada 54 million perished in that war. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; And what did it achieve? Well, industrialization. But what did it really achieve? 54 million people, folks. &gt;&gt; That's almost in Well, it is. It's incomprehensible. &gt;&gt; And these are powers. And the prophet said it was a birth pain. &gt;&gt; But these are powers that have been imposed upon humanity &gt;&gt; and incredible things have taken place. And then the dark ages over a thousand years. You know, I think it would wake us up if we just each one were pitched into the dark ages for about a week. &gt;&gt; We'd know what we're talking about, what the preacher is talking about this morning. If you just had one week in the dark ages, you'd come here this morning alert. &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Ah, thank God I'm free of the dark ages." &gt;&gt; If you just had one week of it. And during the dark ages and now the prophet of God and and we know clearly that it was a great move of Satan to always remember one thing. Satan has an enemy too. And his enemy is God. &gt;&gt; And he's against &gt;&gt; everything that's righteous and holy. And he's he's trying to stamp it out, &gt;&gt; trying to make it difficult for people. You might think, "Oh, I don't want to be in the dark ages." Let me tell you something. You're in a more difficult age. &gt;&gt; You're going to try to That didn't work. So, he's going to work something else. &gt;&gt; He's going to work ease. &gt;&gt; Make it so pleasant. &gt;&gt; Anything that your flesh wants, &gt;&gt; he'll have a new food on the market. He'll have a new something. He'll have a new toy. He'll have something. And he'll just keep you on the treadmill because, you know, I got to get this and I got to get that. And for some, for some it's money, and for some it's education, and for some it's uh, you know, pleasure. And for some, it's something else. But he's got the whole the whole world as it were, gripped by that uh uh spirit of this age. And the prophet said that this age spiritually is and the and the Lord Jesus spoke of it wretched, &gt;&gt; naked, &gt;&gt; blind, &gt;&gt; and don't know it. &gt;&gt; So they're deceived. What can be worse than that? &gt;&gt; And here God, he's not going to leave his chosen or his elect. And if we are that, I pray by his grace we are. He's not going to leave us here powerless. He's not going to leave us here blind. He's going to give us insight &gt;&gt; so you can see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we making some headway? &gt;&gt; So the four living creatures, he said the different definitions of these beasts here looking back into the original one is the animal in the Greek and like wild animals and this other one is living creatures. So now a beast represents power as I said a few moments ago and down through time which I just reiterated. Now I'd like to read what he says in the sixth seal. He said we find those beasts. Now he refers to the there's four horse riders and the first came out on a uh a red horse I believe then a black horse and a pale horse. We have the uh uh we have four horse riders and he calls them and the Bible calls them beasts. We find those beasts or horse riders how they rode each one. One sent out on his ministry in political powers uniting religious powers and political powers together. And in case you think that that is just something that we slide over lightly, there are untold hundreds of millions of people in various religions. And if they do not believe in Jesus Christ and the sacrifice of Christ, that religion has deceived them. [Music] political powers uniting religious powers and political powers together. He says, "And we find out, we find out God sent his power to combat it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we're in kind of a study, and I'm not going to be uh concerned about your response, but I I want I I pray that you'll really let this anchor down very deep. And do not put this is not history. This is present tense. And these things are active in your world with your friends, your family, and perhaps some that are even here or those listening to the voice. And and for those of you, it might surprise you. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that see these services, some live. And within within one week of the archive, there's probably at least another 300 locations that will hear this in the next week. And within two weeks up around maybe around 400 plus locations that are hearing this service and and it's not imposed on anybody. If they want to hear it, fine. But it goes to show there are people who are hungry. And I get emails I get emails from maybe Central America or one from Europe or or wherever more and uh and we're just happy if we can be a blessing to them. So we say God bless them. &gt;&gt; But there are people that are hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said we find these beasts or these horse riders. They rode out each time and they increased friends. They increased the last horse rider which was a pale horse rider is it and it's death the rider is death. We live in a very crucial time &gt;&gt; and we need to preach and preach as as straight and as honest and be as sincere as possible because we are seeking to save people from this present evil age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says about from this phrase, we find out God sent out his power to combat that. I'm saying this to you today because I'm well aware there's some that have received this power and some have not received this power. I say to you sincerely, if you have not received it, you will not survive spiritually. &gt;&gt; You must be endued with what God sent to combat the age or you'll never combat it. &gt;&gt; Impossible. &gt;&gt; You cannot combat it with your own thoughts or your own works or your own reasoning or this is the way I see it. I'm not interested in how anybody sees it. I'm interested in what a vindicated messenger said about it. [Music] &gt;&gt; I address you young men say, "Well, I'm young and I that doesn't mean anything." Young men fall just as harder harder than someone else. &gt;&gt; Young ladies, I'm I'm I'm, you know, I've got my youth. I've got my beauty. I've got this. I've got that. I've got my education. Doesn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; You'll fall just as hard and maybe harder. because you'll end up wounded and end up, you know, in whatever you do, take the heed of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Take the call of God now. &gt;&gt; And if you have any question that you have received this power to combat the age, you'll just be sucked in. And you say, "Well, I don't feel it. I don't sense it." Do you know why? The spirit of this age is deception. &gt;&gt; You're not going to feel it. you maybe won't even awaken to it. You'll just be lulled on down through this generation say everything's a-ok. Okay, that's what they thought. We're rich and we're increased with goods and I've got this and we've got our friends and we've got our fellowship. We've got our church and that's all you need. [Music] &gt;&gt; But he said we find out that God sent out his power to combat it. Why do I repeat this? I'm repeating it because you need it. &gt;&gt; I need it. And then he asked this. How could man do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them? &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, I wept when I begin to read that &gt;&gt; because I too was young. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I was the age of these young men. And all through even through the teens, I remember same devil &gt;&gt; back then as there is now. &gt;&gt; And I I recall, you know, why don't you do this? And I'd say, yeah, why don't I do that? &gt;&gt; And then I'd ask myself, well, you know what? I really don't I'm really not interested. &gt;&gt; Somehow it's just not in me. &gt;&gt; I I'm not interested in that. But I had other interests. And what is it? How can you do anything else &gt;&gt; than that which the spirit of God has put on you or pushing you in that direction? &gt;&gt; And oh, how I thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it doesn't just come, you know, on a on a golden platter. But if I were you and I would persuade anybody here today under the sound of my voice that you become urgent with it and you become sincere with it. Say, "Oh God, I give myself. Release that power upon me. [Music] &gt;&gt; How can they do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them?" And I said, "How can we do anything else then? Uh than besides the power of God that has been released to us." In the fifth seal, he spoke about the martyrs down through the ages who suffered terribly. We could speak about them and I have read and it's it's just so brutal. It's just incredible. He said how how they they suffered terribly. But what were they? He asked the question. He said they were under the inspiration of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And I say we don't need it any less in this day. &gt;&gt; They went to the They went to the stake and were burned. They went to the wild beast and were torn aunder. They they suffered all kinds of hideous things and we don't have that. But the soft age that we're in can be even more deceptive than that age. &gt;&gt; That age was either bend or be broken. &gt;&gt; Deny it or die. &gt;&gt; And it was a clear-cut decision. And sometimes that would be easier &gt;&gt; if somebody came in here today and said, "You deny this message. Deny this gospel, deny this Christ, or I'm going to shoot you. I'd say fire away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fire away. &gt;&gt; I have no fear of that whatsoever. &gt;&gt; But this age that you're in, this age is a subtle age. This age is a serpent age. &gt;&gt; Really, a serpent age. He's just working it and and and weaving his way through every part of society. every part is hardly a clean thing. &gt;&gt; You can't look at a newspaper because there's segments of it that's unclean. &gt;&gt; Maybe you just want to get the news. There's no such a thing as just getting the news &gt;&gt; because they've got everything. It's it's it's a merge. It's homogenized. So, you can't separate it. &gt;&gt; It's a wicked age. &gt;&gt; You go to your school or you go to your entertainment or you go to your sports. What some of the sports there's there's nothing sinful with the sport, but it becomes sinful [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; down through the ages. It says they were under the inspiration of the spirit of God, the power. And don't forget this church. It's not me saying it. He said it. I want to say to you, listen to him. Just let me echo the prophet's words for a moment. And don't forget this church and you brethren on tape. I want you to examine this. How could man do anything else besides the power of God that had been released had been released upon them? And this message, friends, is not word only, but it is actually a power. And that's what I've been seeking to preach to you and bring to you that there's an essence &gt;&gt; within the word, within the message, within the letter, reading between the lines, getting something more than just the face value of it. &gt;&gt; There is a power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a married man. I'm glad it's not just a certificate on the wall. I'm glad there's something that sustains us when things get rough &gt;&gt; and things will get rough. &gt;&gt; I'm glad as a church and as a body of people. Let me tell you friends, I don't care what you see or what you hear. The bride of Jesus Christ is the chosen elected bloodbought body of Jesus Christ wherever they are. And it's not my choosing. It's his choosing. He's already done it. &gt;&gt; And I accept that. &gt;&gt; I love that. He loves it. I love it. &gt;&gt; These four living creatures are protectors. And you never get this, never get this outside of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Never get it. And watch now clearly. And after you know person does some uh does some study and does some prayer and so on so forth and over the years but in the revelation series he goes back and he says now I'm going right to Genesis excuse me when Adam sinned and he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubams and a flaming sword which turned every way. See the four beasts. There's only four ways you can go. East, north, west, and south. These cherubams had a flaming sword at the gate of the garden to keep the way of the tree of life. Soon as they had fallen, there was protectors to keep not just the tree of life, but the way of the tree of life. Adam lost his way. Didn't know how to do things. Didn't know how to achieve. Didn't know how to order his sunship. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You can have the most talented person, but perhaps they won't know what to do. You can give someone uh uh some people, I guess they win the lottery or something, and I often think, do they know what to do with it? Uh some people are gifted gifted people but they don't know exactly what to do with their gift and uh uh so now Adam lost his sunship and he says the four beasts they turned every way or the four these were cherubams then uh I have a I have a slide here if we can I'd like to show slide 10 if I could Please. This is the This is the tabernacle in the middle. And we could spend some time on it, but we won't. The outer court, the inner court, and then the holy of holies and the pillar of fire over it. But the but the 12 But the children of Israel are divided into 12 tribes. And there are uh on on each side they're divided. And I have the I have the names here. Said you'll notice Dan is the head of three tribes. Jude is the head of three tribes. Reuben is the head of three tribes. And Ephraim is the head of three tribes. Has 12 tribes of Israel. See each one of their banner. Now, they had each one of those those tribes, the head of each tribe had a banner. And the banner of Judah was a lion. The banner of Reuben was man, the banner of Ephraim, an ox, and the banner of Dan was an eagle. And that's exactly the tribes of Israel camped around guarding this earthly guards of the right to the ark. &gt;&gt; This is the ark and these tribes are around it. God is representing that he's always now we've moved all the way from Eden where there's flaming cherubams protecting the way of the tree of life which was the word. And now God has chosen one man. We don't understand that God chose one man, Abram and changed his name to Abraham. Says, "I'm going to give you a son and out from him came the patriarchs and out from him came this lineage right here." And then and he gives he gives the commandments on a tablet of stone and that's in the Holy of Holies in an ark. And there's the mercy seat. And there's the little ark, which is just a little box. And the tablets of stone are there. And that's written by the finger of God. And these tribes, what God is showing all down through this and just it's so beautiful. He's showing that the word will always be protected. &gt;&gt; The purity will always be protected. &gt;&gt; The power of it will always be protected. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then that word, the Bible says the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; He's not satisfied just to have it in in tablets of stone. He wants to write it and he's determined to write it in the very fleshly tablets of the heart of his people that he will call every age. &gt;&gt; All right, you can take that off just for now. And finally, here comes Jesus Christ, the word in flesh. And God surrounds him with the record of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. &gt;&gt; And Matthew takes, you've heard me say it here before, but Matthew takes the record and the lineage of Jesus in his kingly line. Jesus Christ, the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of Abraham, the son of David. That's his kingly line. And that was because he was anointed. &gt;&gt; He was un he was under the power and the influence to write of him as king. &gt;&gt; So that was lying. &gt;&gt; You read to you read into Mark. Listen, you know, he starts out even Luke starts different. But you read Mark, the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the son, as it is written in the prophets, behold, I send my messenger, starts right off in in service and labor and ministry. Because Mark was anointed with the sacrifice and the ox, &gt;&gt; the labor. &gt;&gt; Luke, some say he was Luke the physician. I do not know. But he takes the lineage of Jesus Christ through the human lineage because he's anointed with the man, the spirit of the man. And John, he is the spirit of the eagle &gt;&gt; in the beginning. &gt;&gt; In the beginning &gt;&gt; was the word and the word was with God. He goes way back, not when, you know, this lineage started or this lineage started or his service on earth. He goes back to the beginning. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John protectors of the word. The life coming into the church at Pentecost. And they were the protectors as it were of what was to take place in the book of Acts. in the revelation series again the four gospels are the framework to back Pentecost Mark Matthew Mark Luke and John he said them four guards come and was writing and writing everything that they seen coming to pass telling it just like it is how it is going to happen and what was going to take place they were the they were the framework now in Revelation 4 7. Maybe you might want to turn to that in your Bible rather than just have me read it. Read verse six. This is what John saw in heaven. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beasts. There's a four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion. The second beast like a calf. And the third beast had a face of a man. And the fourth fourth beast was uh like a flying eagle. And uh in the revelation series he said remember God's four guards of the ark or the mercy seat. John saw how many? Four. He seen four. Four living creatures. And four is the number of the earth. Four is an earthly number. Now follow this very closely please. It's a number of earth. A number of deliverance. deliverance. He said, "Now keep that in your mind." Deliverance. There was three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. The but the fourth one come, it was deliverance. &gt;&gt; Lazarus was in the grave three days, but when the fourth one come, he was delivered. &gt;&gt; Four is God's number of deliverance. So it showed that these beings must have been something about the earth. In other words, they were connected to what was happening on earth. &gt;&gt; And now in the in the book of Revelation, now as we've read, are you with me? &gt;&gt; Just pinch your conscience a moment. Now around in the throne is four living creatures. Those that's not just something symbolic back there. They symbolize uh anointings. They symbolize powers that God has sent. And you're either under one of them or not. &gt;&gt; And the one the last one was flying eagle. &gt;&gt; The last one is an eagle because the fourth is spells deliverance. &gt;&gt; And if there ever was an age that needs to be delivered, we need to be delivered from the from the sentence of corruption. &gt;&gt; We need to be delivered. And the prophet comes. Now, here comes a vindicated messenger telling us this is the time that the Adams will change in human bodies. Why is he saying that? Because he's he's under the inspiration of the fourth power. He's under a prophet inspiration speaking to a generation of people that God is determined to deliver from the grip of death. &gt;&gt; You can either have it &gt;&gt; or deny it. And you can go to a grave if you want. I want a resurrection. &gt;&gt; And the fourth. And now we've gone in just a few moments. We've gone all the way from Genesis when they're protecting the way of the tree of the life. And now we have a messenger saying those cherubams, &gt;&gt; those cherubams, you know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Those same cherubams. He said, now do you believe him? &gt;&gt; Do you believe him? He said they are here now &gt;&gt; driving driving you &gt;&gt; to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Not keeping you from it but driving you to it. I say, "Oh God, let that power &gt;&gt; grip every soul with under the sound of my voice." &gt;&gt; That's the power to give deliverance &gt;&gt; from Satan's Eden. deliverance from this present evil age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they've been all the way all the way. It was back there. You say, "Well, oh, I'd love to been back in the days of Jesus." That was, and I'm not belittling that was simply Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. We want to go beyond that. &gt;&gt; We want to go beyond their record. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that we're in this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when we're under another inspiration, &gt;&gt; we're under another power. &gt;&gt; And that power, friends, has been sent for you to protect that life that's in you. And that's one thing as it was with Job. Oh, Job. All the things that Job went through and Satan came and says, "Yeah, but you're protecting him if you just let me get at him." And God gave him release. And then finally, he still couldn't be broken. Then then Satan came back to God and say you let me touch his body. A man will give up anything for his body. And he and he afflicted him and stripped him of everything. Stripped him of his respect. Stripped him of his position. Stripped him of his wealth. Stripped him of his family. And then finally with a body full of sores and boils and sitting on an ash heap, he still wouldn't deny God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And after he hath tried me, I'll come forth as pure gold. And his wife tried to get him to deny God. And he would not deny God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God prevented Satan from He said, "But you cannot touch his life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God may God may allow Satan to pull you through a knot hole. He may bring you through some very difficult times. But there's one thing that I can declare on the authority of God's holy word. He cannot touch your life. &gt;&gt; That gene that came from God is protected &gt;&gt; and there's no power that can get to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We can say yes. There's three Hebrew children and the fourth one was deliverance. Lazarus was in the grave three days and the fourth one was deliverance. And we can say and there was three p there was three powers sent uh all through the 2,000 years of this gospel of grace. But when the fourth one came, there's deliverance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to preach it, folks. There's deliverance for this body. &gt;&gt; There's deliverance for this there's deliverance from death. It's been spoken. I'm going to continue to preach it. There has to be a people that will declare it. &gt;&gt; This is what my father has said. [Music] &gt;&gt; Listen to the Apostle Paul. We shall not all sleep. &gt;&gt; There's somebody that's not going to sleep. &gt;&gt; I would like you to be able to claim that for yourself. &gt;&gt; I'm still claiming it. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye &gt;&gt; at the last trump. &gt;&gt; We're not going to coast our way into that. We're going to fight our way into it. &gt;&gt; But the power has been released. And we say, I say with the prophet's words, what can we do? How can we do anything else? &gt;&gt; That's been what's been released on us. Hallelujah. Amen. Once again in the fifth seal, brother Brent makes a reference to Apostle Paul and he said, "I know that after my departing that wolves are coming to enter in among you, brethren, teaching perverse things and it'll it'll draw you away." And the scripture, the actual scripture, for I know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you and not sparing the flock. He said, "Look at that stern little old apostle standing there, his his backbeat full of stripes, his eyes watering, but he could see farther than the telescope, claiming out there yonder that they can see 120 million light years of space, but he could look plum into eternity." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't that do something for you, friends? He says, "The martyrs down through the ages and they suffered terribly." I'm I'm reading it again. And they were under the inspiration of the spirit of God. I'm saying this because I'm not just here to preach a service. I'm making a declaration. There's nothing that Satan can throw at the bride of Jesus Christ, but what she will be victorious over it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it be suffering, whether he tries suffering, or whether he try all the pleasures of life and the easy the easy road, there'll be something within the believer that'll deny it and turn away from it. &gt;&gt; And as was sung this morning by the choir and the singers, we want to surrender all. He said if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them. He says and now we'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose. He said and watch exactly the church. Hello church. He said, "The church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do anything else." Saying the same thing, but he's saying it another way. &gt;&gt; The church responded. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I declare to you the anointing of this age has been abundantly poured out. &gt;&gt; And I urge you to respond to it. &gt;&gt; Say, "How can I respond to it?" Just open your heart and say, "God, pour it in. &gt;&gt; God, here I stand and here I am. Pour it in. &gt;&gt; Pour the strength within me. &gt;&gt; Pour the expression of Jesus Christ. I want to live this word. &gt;&gt; We cannot do it on our own. Pour it in. &gt;&gt; Here I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "First was the lion that roared in the pure adulterated word." That was the first that came in the first age book of Acts. And the second was the ox, and that was the beast of burden. And it also was a sacrificial beast. And they willingly walked up there and died. You have perhaps read of some. I have read of some. And some of them are truly so gripping that makes a person feel that we don't we don't endure anything. Harley says they didn't care because the spirit of the church in that day was sacrifice labor and they walked up just as freely as they could walk anointed with the true spirit of God of that age. How many here have heard or read about I believe it was five missionaries that went down to South America. They landed a little plane. It was the Ala Indians and they were all slain. &gt;&gt; How many have read about that? Heard about it? Good number. Well, the wife the wife a wife of one of those five her and her father made a trip to Alaska and they stopped in Dawson Creek and she spoke in my church and told and I spent some time with her. It was very very remarkable and since then she's become very well known. But I spent time with her. But the thing was her husband and the others that were there, they knew it was very dangerous. They knew that their life may be taken, but they freely gave themselves to it. And they were determined to bring the gospel to these men. And this woman and another one of the wives after their husbands were slain right there on the shore on the on the sandbar of a river, they went back there. They went directly back there and gave their lives and started getting the scripture in their language. And some of them got converted and they had they have had they've started in a remarkable work. Those those women they gave themselves because they wanted to they they knew that that was the mission that their husbands that was their passion. That was their entire life and they sacrificed their life to reach these people that had not heard of the gospel of Jesus Christ and they turned around and gave themselves for it. and they were and they were very much blessed in their work. &gt;&gt; That's not, you know, that's not centuries ago. That's in recent recent time. So I'm saying there are still people that, you know, give a lot of sacrifice. We have quite a few people here at part of the church from originally from Congo. The last two ministers that were martyed were martyed in Congo and they were two Pentecostal ministers. And you know how long ago that was? Just 1962. I was in Toronto and those two men were hacked and and and the one was pleading the one was pleading nothing against the Congalles people. These were these were rebels and renegades that were armed. And one was pleading, "Take me, not him. Please take me, not him." Cuz they were just going to take take him. And he he was so uh so persistent. So they they hacked them both. Both of them died with machetes. That was just 1962. God has always had and just think of it, the seals hadn't even come. There were people who were following brother Brandham's ministry at that time. But since then, since that time, a message has broke on the earth, friends. And I'm going to speak very very plainly. I'm I'm not going to uh shy away from anything. When this message struck my heart and my soul, I felt first here in Cloverdale. I felt here's this whole movement called the hippie movement, flower power, and they found out that that movement didn't satisfy. They found out it it was a dead end. And they had they had they had cast off the the monetary life of their parents, the life of ease of their parents because their parents had come out of hardship. And now the industrial age had come on and they were making money and having buying a boat and buying this. And the hippie movement came said we don't want that. We're we're tired of that. We don't want and we're not interested in this education. We're not interested in authority. We're not interested in law. We're not interested. We just want to live a happy happy life. Happy hippie life. And that came and you know just everybody just using uh the next person's you know we'll sing in the sunshine and we'll laugh every day and all of these songs that became popular at that time because they didn't want to become attached. So we just know everybody by their first name and we kind of you know eight or 10 all throw their funds together and rent a great big house and all the rest of it. But then I drove down the highway. I'm just telling you exactly how things happen. I drove down some of these highways and I'd see big stones painted on. I saw several times and painted in great big blazing great big bold letters. Jesus help us now. That was like a dart to my heart. I was doing okay. I had a business that God was prospering. I I could have forgot the world. Then I'd say another stone. Jesus, help us now. And God was telling me, you have the answer that you got tapes. You've got a message. You have an answer. &gt;&gt; And you know that that's what they need. And then the rest is all history that we opened up the Bible way Cloverdale Bible Way house for one purpose to find somebody that was out of that whole movement and they could live there by themselves live there rather as their family and and perhaps I see David McAdams from the Tri Cities. Brother Roger Smith and Emily came I don't know if you knew them. They came right from that place and they were a couple. They'd been the whole they'd gone through the whole thing. They've been into drugs and the whole works. I said, "There's a house here. You can live in it." And and and we turned it into a boy's house and then a boy's house. And then another little place we had and that became a boy's house. Another place became a girl's house. Another place became another boy's house. And I'll tell you what, it was a ragged bunch of people. But that was the birth. And this man here was one that's why he tells his testimony. he come in and and brother Ken Ardal was another one. I won't say that they were in that hippie thing, but they were in the probably the the kind of the final stages of it, but they they knew that, you know, education wasn't it. Education's necessary. Get all you can, have success, have your promotions, earn all you can, give all you can. do do whatever you can, but it will not satisfy that alone. &gt;&gt; And I I just said, you listen to those tapes. You get down, get locked into those tapes. I want to say to this church, there might be a lot of people that can't give you right advice, but what's on those tapes will never turn you away. &gt;&gt; What's on that message will never never do you damage. &gt;&gt; I declare to you, it will strengthen you. You'll get insight you won't get any other place. &gt;&gt; And if you just get a hold of that and immerse yourself in that and you want to say, "Well, you know, it's not real to me and I'm I'm I'm this thing hasn't been re," you need to get into the right source. &gt;&gt; And don't think coming here just Sunday and listening to a sermon is the answer. You need to hear those messages. And once you open your heart to that, &gt;&gt; you'll be a different person. &gt;&gt; You'll be different person in 6 months. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that was the spirit that God released &gt;&gt; upon this age. &gt;&gt; And I say that without shame, without apology, and without hesitation. I would urge everybody under the sound of my voice. It'll never do you any damage. It'll do you good. &gt;&gt; It's the heavenly spirit of almighty God &gt;&gt; that he poured out. It is your protection &gt;&gt; that is the last of the protectors. And that protection that came in this time by a prophet voice is also number four deliverance. [Applause] The smartest people we have on earth can't figure out the presidents and the premers and the kings and whatever they are. They can't figure their way out out of wallowing in this economic chaos that we're in. &gt;&gt; We're going to be in a couple days in in in Europe and where they have the the euro. They don't even know if the euro is a dollar is a monetary uh uh instrument is going to exist. &gt;&gt; They want it to. &gt;&gt; America wants it. Friends, they can't figure their way out of the dilemma. And the biggest dilemma in this the biggest dilemma on this earth is what Israel and the Palestinians and 160 million Arabs around them what they will settle for. And you think that all this uprising you know be it Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and on and then continues to erupt. Isn't it amazing &gt;&gt; that it is those very nations that have such opposition to Israeli statethood? &gt;&gt; Why? Because God allows that &gt;&gt; to be a distraction. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And what does Israel has less to worry about when they're fighting amongst themselves? &gt;&gt; And if you read this Bible, it will tell you that it's not me shouting this out. It's this says that Ishmael will be a wild man &gt;&gt; and he'll have every man against his brother &gt;&gt; and that's exactly what they're doing. &gt;&gt; It's every man. It's the fulfillment of this. &gt;&gt; This Bible says this would happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then what hour are we living in? &gt;&gt; What is the time that we're living in? &gt;&gt; We're right there. Okay, I'm going to close right quick. &gt;&gt; The power that's released upon us. I want to just talk about that for just a moment. The power that's been released upon you, not will be, has been. &gt;&gt; And this is what this is what God is expecting of people when they hear about it. He presents it to them. Don't turn it down. Don't take it casual. Don't say, "Well, I'll, you know, I will when I can or when I have time or whatever more." God's not interested in that. When he presents it to you, that's his time. &gt;&gt; And you want to get locked into his time. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham just uses little simple things. Please don't miss this, but he talks about a eagle. He'll see the storm clouds coming and he soarses way above it. I've seen it myself. I've seen them I've seen them just soar and hit a certain wave uh certain uh wind and it just disappear in a few seconds and soar way above the thunder clouds and the storm clouds. If you got any eyes, we got a lot of storm clouds around us. &gt;&gt; We have storm clouds. &gt;&gt; I have heaviness in my heart because of the storm clouds. &gt;&gt; There's people in this church that struggle. &gt;&gt; Things are difficult &gt;&gt; and I feel for them. &gt;&gt; They're facing difficult times. workwise and the economy. Some are facing sickness. As we sit here, we have very dear friends and relatives that are staring death in the face. Don't say we don't need a power. &gt;&gt; We need the power of this one. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I would say most everybody here is connected to somebody who has not yet got the assurance of eternal life. &gt;&gt; And I want to declare without apology, we have the answer. &gt;&gt; We have the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; And they need to be delivered. &gt;&gt; I look out across this congregation. I know that you have you have children, you have brothers, you have sisters, I have grandchildren, and they need to be delivered. They need to be delivered. We're very late in the hour, friends. &gt;&gt; We need to be If we've been earnest, let's be more earnest. &gt;&gt; If we prayed, let's pray more earnestly. [Applause] Can I have about another five 10 minutes? I know I've been quite long, but just give me another few minutes. I'm interested. I'm very very interested what took place between Ruth and Boaz because I told you at the very beginning I was going I wanted to I wanted to kind of turn my my thoughts towards what did Boaz say? And he said to he said to Ruth this I'll just give me a moment here. And these were his first words to her. Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them. Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? Oh, I'm sorry. And and Boaz said unto Ruth, "Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens." In other words, he's saying also, I want you to listen to me. I want you to hear me. And I I began to go and I wanted to I wanted to find out what uh what what the message came to us. And in the deity of Jesus Christ and a prophet says, "And I tell you today, friend, hear my word." There is a drawing power not from the church, not from the pastor, but from glory. And this baptism of the Holy Ghost moving down in that life channel to draw up a church. What is it? It's the power of God, the access to his life, Zoe. &gt;&gt; And he made it very simple. He said, "Hear my word." Amen. &gt;&gt; In choosing of a bride, at the end of it, he said, "I've stretched out further tonight on this than I have at any other anything else, any other time before the public because I've had a great a great freedom in these meetings." He said, "If you believe me to be God's prophet, you listen to what I've told you. If there's one little tinkle of feeling in your hearts, and I'm sounding, I'm echoing that. If there's one little tinkle of of feeling in your heart, and he said, you go to God right now and you do it, &gt;&gt; that cannot get any simpler and you do it, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, if you'll honor that, &gt;&gt; you'll receive the benefit of it. &gt;&gt; Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go after them. Why? Because that's how she was going to be sustained. That was her life. You stay in this field. &gt;&gt; You stay in this field and you'll experience redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's all right. I'm still coming to the good part. &gt;&gt; And I'm bouncing back and forth. And when he took the book, the four beasts, all four anointings all through the ages, and the four and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, and every one of them having harps and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of the saints, and they sung a new song. Brother Mike Gier when he when he prayed and he finished praying coming to the end of his prayer and something came upon him and he broke and then the audience and it it was a sound. It was a unplanned sound. It was an unplanned worship and it was uncontrollable worship. Wasn't something where I said, you know, worship the Lord. This was something that was uncontrollable. And furthermore, I'm I've never talked to him about it, but I can say under the witness that I had, he couldn't stop it. &gt;&gt; You couldn't have stopped it, Brother Mike. And there a time or two, you know, kind of you wanted to maybe slacken it off, but then it just came with another surge. &gt;&gt; And I knew what I felt. I got in my car and my wife said that what happened to brother Mike Gier. That was actually just exactly what happened in the scripture. And soon as they took the book and a realization that this was this was the redemption taking place. Soon as they realized that then they just let loose and they couldn't help themselves and they fell down. And the Bible tells us, "And Boaz said to Ruth, and Boaz said to Ruth, you'll stay here and you'll you'll stay with my maidens and you'll glean." And he gave extra extra corn for her. And the Bible says, "And she fell on her face." That's what the four living creatures. Now she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him, "Why have I found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?" Friends, this is not a story. This is a woman &gt;&gt; that fell down before another man on her face. &gt;&gt; Why have I found grace in thy sight? There isn't anything that you and I could do to to overemphasize &gt;&gt; our our respect and our obesence to God himself. Oh God. I tell you what, friends. I found myself in places in life and to get down and pray wasn't sufficient. And you're at a point, you're at a time, you reach something and you end up on your face. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you end your end up prostrate. &gt;&gt; Full body length prostrate. &gt;&gt; You're not there for twominut prayer. You're not there for five minute prayer. You're there as long you're there until there's a release and you know you've touched God. &gt;&gt; And you listen to me friends. Some of you young people need to find that spot. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the best news you could ever hear. &gt;&gt; Some of you need to find that spot. &gt;&gt; I can see that the that the deception and the and the enemy and his cunning ways to come and and you we get satisfied with life and don't do it. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going down the easy way. Don't do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; What should I do, brother Ed? Find your spot. &gt;&gt; Find a place at his feet. &gt;&gt; Ask him to cover you with his curt. &gt;&gt; Get down and say, "What mercy, what grace is this?" &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I've been born into it." You've been there. It's not because of any good that you've done that you have Christian parents or or the church that you have. You need to have a personal experience with God. I will never apologize for this. &gt;&gt; I'll never apologize for this, friends. This is the greatest favor I could do you. You find that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when she realized what grace this was, maybe you have never experienced before understanding the grace of God in this generation that God would pour out upon you, upon us unworthy creatures. the power the power to to be to to uh uh to miss uh the corruption that's in this world. I'm so glad. I'm so thankful I'm not subjected to his darts. &gt;&gt; We're not subjected to his wicked ways. &gt;&gt; I say in the name of Jesus Christ that the power of hell be broken. [Applause] [Music] You can go and take this home if you would. &gt;&gt; Take this home with you. And she and I'm closing with this. And you've perhaps heard me speak it before. When Boaz came, when Boaz came and came right to the point, he had the wherewithal, he had the wealth. He was sufficient to to redeem her. He said, "But there's someone who's closer. There's a kinsman who's nearer to you." &gt;&gt; And you have one that's nearer to you, too, because you were first born in a natural birth. Right? &gt;&gt; And you were born with a human nature. &gt;&gt; You were born with whatever you were born with. &gt;&gt; And I've been I've been preaching upon this, but now I'm coming to a conclusion. This is the last service on it. You were born with whatever you inherited from your human lineage. Maybe not from your parents, grandparents, on down the line. We were born with it. I say to you in the name of the Lord, don't allow anything don't allow anything that's come down the line to prevent you from giving your whole being &gt;&gt; to the to the word of this hour. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to it completely and you'll never you'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; Don't allow anything to stand in your way. &gt;&gt; And there was a nearer kinsman. But notice now and and Boaz said if you can you redeem Naomi which was an Old Testament figure can you redeem her? Said yes because under the Old Testament was only the blood of bulls and goats. And they could have continued to do that. He said notice he said if you are going to redeem Naomi you also have to redeem Ruth the Moabitis. &gt;&gt; And he said I can't do that. I might mar my own inheritance. The truth was he didn't have the wherewithal to change her. &gt;&gt; He didn't have the wherewithal to change her from a moabitete to an Israelite. He didn't have the power to change and and and that would have to follow into the into the New Testament. He didn't have the power to transform a sinner to a Christian to a saint. &gt;&gt; I can't do it. And boy says, then I will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. then I will. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he did. &gt;&gt; There's a song uh there's a song we can have the musicians come and it's a I just want to read a couple of the verses. I know in whom I've believed. I know not why God's wondrous grace to me he hath made known, nor why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me for his own. I don't understand at all is what the songwriter sang, but I know in whom I've believed. And then another verse, I know not how the spirit moves, convincing men of sin, revealing Jesus through the word, creating faith in him. I don't know how it all works, but I know it does work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me, please? I realize that, you know, a lot of the I just wanted to make these statements to you and have you be able to think about them and let you know how serious and sincere I am about it. I just feel that we need some examples. [Music] I know that we appeal often to our young people, but you are the you're really the answer to a lot of things within this congregation. And you need to step forward. You don't need to slack off. You need to step forward. Is it okay if I talk to you this way? &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll is calling for you to step forward. Not not just one or two as a whole group. Say, "Well, I don't I don't really feel like it. And what do I do?" And so on. I'm not interested in what you feel like. I'm interested in in in saying to you that this is the hour that is that is necessary. This is more than just a social gathering. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to gather socially. We're here and and I want I want you to become uh examples to others. &gt;&gt; Say, "What would you like to see?" I'd like to see the body of believers of this congregation become so fervent for God. &gt;&gt; Can you become more too fervent? I don't think so. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for what I have seen. I'm thankful for the witnessing that's gone on. I'm so thankful, Brother Matthew Redell, for taking some leadership and and gathering people together and going out on the streets. I'm thankful for that. I want to I would like to see uh uh I would like to see young men and young ladies, you especially when you get up into your mid into your late teens, the world has so much to offer you, but it's not good. It's not good. And so are are you hearing me? [Music] &gt;&gt; Bar none. I'm not I'm not just speaking this to a few. I speak this to the congregation as a whole, but largely to the young people, young men, young ladies. And I I I see the reason I say this is because I see that everything that Satan has, he throws it out to the feet of the young people &gt;&gt; really to they're not out after people my age or middle age or whatever more. They're, you know, they try to sell you life insurance or something, but we're talking about young people. Have fun and everything's just a great big hilarious time and and friends, it's not that way. you get on down the road, you'll find you need this power that God has released upon the church. You need this power. You thank God for this service. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in having just a big habool of time. You know, I'm in interested in conveying something to you. So when you walk out these doors, you'll say, I'm going to do something substantial. I'm going to make a turnaround. Yes, brother Biscll, it's been true. The enemy has just been wearing on me. Somebody's wore down. Somebody is uh uh you know got friends. Let me deal with this friend thing for just a moment. A real friend is someone that is a Holy Ghost friend. &gt;&gt; And outside of a Holy Ghost friend, they're not a Holy Ghost friend. &gt;&gt; I've had too many experiences. That's why I stand here sometimes silent. I had a close [Music] family member of mine [Music] and she was attractive and I could see the the world was getting a hold of her and she was caught up with her beauty and I stopped her on the street in a large city early in the morning when everyone's just going every direction to work and men in their briefcases lying every direction. And so I just said, "We're standing right on the corner of the street." And I wasn't I wasn't making much success getting through to her. I said, "You see all these people? Do you see all these men?" I said, "There's probably all kinds of them would take you and sleep with you tonight and violate your body and they kick you in the ditch the next morning." That's what that means. In other words, you need to wake up. Let me You might say, "Well, that is kind of crass." Let me tell you something. That's mild compared to what Satan has in mind for you. [Music] That's mild compared to what Satan's got in planned for you. &gt;&gt; You fellas to go go you go Satan's way. I'll just tell you something. There'll be a day you'll remember these words I'm speaking and you'll regret it. &gt;&gt; You'll regret going Satan's way. &gt;&gt; The way of the transgressor is &gt;&gt; hard. Say it again. Hard. &gt;&gt; The wages of sin is &gt;&gt; death. And when God poured out the kind of anointing he has in this age to give you life &gt;&gt; and to escape that, &gt;&gt; then we cannot take that lightly. &gt;&gt; We want to be you want to be able to fall on your knees and say, "What grace is this?" &gt;&gt; That you'd allow me to escape this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right. I'll put you on the line. know not why God's wonderous comes to me he has made known nor why worthy Christ for is that he is able to [Music] hold my How the spirit of sus. [Music] which I will be until we sing as we sing the last two verses. Brother David McAdam, you desired prayer this morning. We're going to pray with you if you make your way forward. I've known brother David McAdam for a long time. And this is the first time he's been, I believe, in this church. And he comes from the Tri Cities in Washington area and had a serious accident many years ago. And we want to pray for our brother David. He's he'd been in a lot of pain, tremendous pain, and he just decided he didn't want to be on these all these painkillers so on. And you'd feel the same way. And so I'd like brother Andes if you'd come, brother Tom, brother Ernie, and Brother David has heard you, Brother Ernie, and heard almost all the ministry here and he's been very affected by it. And we know who we've believed in, Brother David. God bless you. We'll sing the next verse, please. I know what a good or reserve for me. We wait for golden days before his face. I see. I know. I believe and ever say that he is able to keep which I will [Music] &gt;&gt; brother Ryan would you sing only believe please let's sing as a congregation only believe and if you just direct your faith this way if you would please the whole congregation direct your faith if you would towards our brother David if you would only be [Music] holy all things are possible Oh, holy de. [Music] Oh God, &gt;&gt; oh God. Oh God, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, holy &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus is our brother David. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just speaks to you now and said heal me Lord. We say, Lord Jesus, we agree with his words. &gt;&gt; And we agree with what you spoke on Calvary. You said, "It is finished." You're the one that paid the full price. &gt;&gt; You're the one, oh God, that left nothing undone. &gt;&gt; You knew in every footstep that he would ever take. &gt;&gt; You knew what he would endure through life. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you have been his companion. You've been his friend. You have been the one, oh God, that has looked after him, watched after, watched over him. And now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we agree the brethren and lay hands upon our brother that you will take and remove the pain that he's been suffering in his body. Oh God, as a result of this accident years ago and now, Father, I pray that he will be delivered by the mighty deliverer by the redeemer. God, this is not the life that you intended for him, the one you have written in the book. Father, I pray, oh God, that he may experience the complete deliverance from it, Father, and may the pain dissipate from his body in Jesus Christ's name and for your glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We agree together. &gt;&gt; We agree together. &gt;&gt; And we'll give you all the glory. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are are [Music] Lord I Lord I [Music] all things are possible. [Music] God bless you. I trust the word wasn't too direct and yet I wanted real direct. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads together. And now, Father, these are your people. These are your children. And I'm asking, oh God, that blessings will be poured out upon them. I pray that you'll bless their homes, bless their circle of friends, bless them, oh God, with an influence. May the Holy Spirit influence them. Each one as we give ourselves to you. And as the songs were sung earlier in the worship, I surrender all. Oh God, I think of the spirit that came upon that gentile moabitis Ruth and how she fell. Oh God, out of no one was asking her to do that, but out of her own spirit realizing how privileged she was, how what a benefit had come her way and what grace is this. And we say, "Oh God, what amazing grace that caught our spirit, caught our soul while it was in its free fall. You caught it and took a hold of it. Oh God, how we thank you for redemption. We thank you, Lord Jesus. I want to thank you in public. I want to thank you. I thank you for reaching out your hand and taking the record of my life. Oh God, I thank you for taking, oh God, the book into your hand and redeeming it in as your prophet said and taking it within yourself. And now we want to declare we have a love, such a love for you, Lord. I pray that you will go with the people as they are dismissed being the only service that we have today. May they have an afternoon, Father, of fellowship around your word. I pray that you'll bless, oh God, especially as I directed many of my comments today to the young men and the young women of this congregation. Father, I pray that they will do business with you. Perhaps go back to their rooms and kneel at their bed and pray through until they feel, oh God, that you have come and answered them. Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, I resist every enemy. I resist every spirit that would try to seduce and and to bring them down, oh God, or to cause them to seek an easier way. Lord, I pray that they will do as your prophet messenger did when he was spoken to and you you he you gave to him. You spoke to him and said, "Because you've chosen the harder way, but it's my way." Lord, we're here tonight. I wanted this afternoon to go your way. Lord Jesus, we're not interested in what pleases man, but we're interested in what pleases you. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I commit the words that have been spoken to you and the people that are present now. I ask, Father, that their hearts will turn to you more completely, more fully, more surrendered, Jesus, for all of us. Call us, woo over us. I pray by your Holy Spirit's drawing in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus. Lord we thank you Lord. [Music] Or we could just sing may Lord I lift your name your holy name [Music] all your want to praise your holy name Jehovah. God, [Music] the great [Music] [Music] my God Let's [Music] just conclude in worship. Lord Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. My God. [Music] Isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; I'd like you to greet one another. And when you do, have a resolve within your own heart. You're going to be an influence to influence others. I would like to invite [Music] you into this wonderful wonderful release of the Holy Spirit. I'd like to invite you to become a participant. If you haven't experienced the power of God, friends, I just want to say to you as a testimony, I probably experienced a release of the Holy Spirit even over the last few months that has been a surprise. It's been a shock to me. Said, "Oh God." And that's why I speak with such ferveny because I love him so much. ought to have one more time, &gt;&gt; one more opportunity to persuade somebody &gt;&gt; to give their all to him. &gt;&gt; I want to shake hands with you on the other side. And I want to be able to hear. Thank you, brother Ed. Thank you for that service. Thank you for crying out with all the energy that God will give you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some have said to me, you're speaking like you're a 40 or 50 year old man. It's not that so much. I guess there's just something within me. Oh God, if I could just take a hold of you and carry you to that place. And God, I know that there's some needs and whatever you do, I don't want this to be just an emotional moment, but I want you to go from here and do business with God. You find a place where you're alone with God. Find yourself a place where you just say, "God, turn me into a fanatic." It'll be so fervent for you. Can you say amen for me? God bless you. Greet one another. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music]
