TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] we lived in Victoria and I got a call from my brother saying that my dad had had a massive heart attack the main artery to his heart had ruptured out and he was just hanging on a thread and in those days they had oxygen tents were they put them over you so my husband called the doctor in Dawson Creek and the doctor said you'd better send her up so it was about a two-hour flight I guess up to Dawson so I went up and I was only able to stand by his bed for 10 minutes and and a day and not not speak to him he couldn't speak of course and I was there for two or three days and then I had to come back because we were now preparing for brother branham's meetings I was very burdened for him my heart was very happy and we went into the Alberni meetings with that on my heart wanting to speak to brother Brown him and ask him to pray for him but I didn't have a chance because I was playing the piano and then we came down to Victoria and had the meetings there and the meetings closed and brother Ed was speaking to brother Branham and just saying goodbye to him and we stood outside the motel and it was evening late evening and they were just saying goodbye in a very casual way and then he just turned and said oh by the way sister Pisco your father will be all right and from then on he recovered and I think he was about 64 when he had that attack and from then on he had no trouble with his heart not one man and he lived just a month from 85 and he passed away just from old age no trouble with his heart whatsoever and when brother Branham said he'll be alright he was alright and he said he confessed he said I know I'm saved in Alberni I was in the meetings there when brother Brown was there and hearing him call out the native Indian people that I knew and I knew their situations I don't know if he told about this one brother his name was Mike and he was sitting right up probably the second row from the front and everybody knew about an older man who was from a little fishing village called a howzit he had been an invalid just laying on a cot for years and and brother branham said to this brother Mike you're praying for this man and he's an invalid and he's in a hospital not far from here in a city called Nanaimo well brother ad knew that this brother was from a howzit so in his mind he said no this brother is not in Nanaimo he's in a howzit and another brother on the platform said no this brother is not in Nanaimo he's in Alberni in a hospital and afterwards they found out yes he had been moved that very day up to the Indian hospital in Nanaimo and brother Branham had said he's in denial brother Robert Johnson took brother branham out in his boat this is in the Alberni area and it was out on the Alberni canal and brother Johnson and his wife were unable to have children and they had prayed about having a child and as they were going along in the boat suddenly they thought they had hit a log what they call a dead head it's a floating log just below the surface very dangerous to two boats if they hit that and and brother branham said to brother Johnson you thought you'd you thought you hit a dead head that was the presence of the Lord letting you know that he's going to give you and your wife a child we lived with the native people included we stayed in their house I wouldn't even want to tell you the conditions of things that we saw but you know that's the way it is you know when you when you won't don't want to put your elbows on the table because they're you know they're gonna stick there you know and little kids running around without diapers or anything else you know and there's no plumbing there's no running water there's at one in one house we stayed in theirs they gave us the room with the bed and up one corner of the room goes a stairway that goes upstairs and between the steps it's all open so they gave us the room of the curtain across the door so we get into the bed and at every step there's a little kid looking through the you know through the stairs yeah and there was 18 of us in that house yeah so but I don't know you look back on that and I love those people I want to I like to go back yeah and we saw some wonderful things take place we saw we know one woman that at one point drunk crawling on her hands and knees along the muddy path to the to get to her house you know and then the next thing we saw her she's just wonderfully saved and transformed you just you just rejoice over those things yeah the change that you see in these people only God can do it drunks one brother we know he he got on the ferry to Victoria and go to he was drunk when he got on the ferry over to from point A to point B drunk when he came back drunk when he walked to his house on the reserve and as the little kid comes up to him and says daddy listen to what I heard today for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and that man was saved transformed right there from that scripture a wonderful believer so it's good [Music] you [Music]
