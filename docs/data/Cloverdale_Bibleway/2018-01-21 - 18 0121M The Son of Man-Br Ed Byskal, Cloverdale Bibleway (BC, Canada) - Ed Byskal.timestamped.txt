[13:44] and his assembly. Many needs [music] to
[13:47] br
[13:50] behalf. So, we want to remember them as
[13:52] a congregation [music] this morning.
[13:54] If you have a need upon your heart, just
[13:56] desire that the Lord would touch you
[13:58] this [music] morning. I do have a
[14:01] there's a gray Acura [music]
[14:04] out in the parking lot. It's a BC plate.
[14:06] If you have a gray Acura, please [music]
[14:08] step outside and see one of the deacons
[14:10] if you could.
[14:12] Amen. Brother Kyle, God bless you this
[14:15] morning.
[14:20] Precious [music] Lord Jesus, we're so
[14:22] thankful that you are our God and we are
[14:24] your people. We're your children, Lord.
[14:26] Just happy, Lord, that [music] we're not
[14:27] a passing thought. But Lord, we're on
[14:29] the forefront of your mind. We're on the
[14:31] forefront of your heart. Lord Jesus,
[14:33] you're aware of all the areas of our
[14:35] life, Father. Even the private areas,
[14:36] nobody sees what deep down we're
[14:38] thinking, Lord, but you see, and you
[14:40] care, Lord. You have a plan. [music]
[14:42] You're going to work all things together
[14:43] for good, Lord Jesus. So, I just pray
[14:45] let faith begin to grow just as the sun
[14:47] and the warmth would cause flowers to
[14:50] open up, Lord. Let our hearts be able to
[14:52] open up and grow, [music] rise towards
[14:54] you, Lord Jesus, knowing that you're
[14:55] going to speak to us this morning. Just
[14:57] pray you'd use Brother Ed, Lord. Just
[14:59] help them just have freedom and liberty,
[15:01] Lord. He doesn't got to Lord. This isn't
[15:03] We don't want to just have a force a
[15:05] convention. [clears throat] Lord, we
[15:06] just want you to speak. [music] Father,
[15:08] when you spoke when you were here on
[15:09] earth, Lord, sometimes people were just
[15:11] so quiet, just grasping what you were
[15:13] saying to them, Lord [music] Jesus. So,
[15:15] I just pray you'd have your way this
[15:17] morning, Lord, in whatever way you want
[15:18] to accomplish it, Father. just [music]
[15:20] let brother Ed feel so strong and well
[15:22] and just liberty, Lord Jesus, that you
[15:24] can unbburden his heart to us. Lord,
[15:26] we're not in a rush, Father. We can just
[15:28] come and sit and hear what the word
[15:30] would have to say. Lord, every burden we
[15:32] just cast before [music] you, Lord, for
[15:34] you care for us. For the Dutch Scott,
[15:36] Lord Jesus, the Saints down in Atlanta,
[15:38] you see them, Lord, and the their
[15:39] burdens, Lord Jesus. I just pray you'd
[15:42] give us faith, Lord, to cast all our
[15:44] cares upon you, for you care for us,
[15:46] Lord Jesus. [music] The prophet said,
[15:48] "Present our token with our prayers,
[15:49] Lord." So, we're thankful, Lord, that
[15:51] you saved our lives. Gave us the Holy
[15:53] Spirit, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we don't
[15:55] got to be timid to [music] bring our
[15:56] requests before you, Lord. We're not
[15:58] bringing our fruit before you, Lord
[16:00] Jesus. But, Lord, we're thankful for
[16:01] what you [music] did for us at Calvary.
[16:03] You changed our lives, Lord. We'll never
[16:05] be worthy enough, Lord. We'll never be
[16:07] good enough, Lord, to ask you anything,
[16:08] [music] but Lord, you've made us worthy
[16:10] for what you've done for us, Lord. We
[16:12] thank you, Father. Help our eyes not
[16:14] always be upon [music] us, but be upon
[16:15] you, Lord, the chief shepherd and bishop
[16:18] of our souls. We're all the sheep of
[16:20] your pasture, Lord Jesus. [music]
[16:22] Thy rod and thy staff. They still
[16:24] comfort us, Lord, in this technology
[16:26] [music] age, Lord. Your rod and your
[16:28] staff is good enough, Father. We thank
[16:30] you, Lord. Let your voice speak to your
[16:31] sheep, Lord Jesus. Help us trust you,
[16:34] Father, through the deserts and through
[16:36] the grasslands. We just trust you, Lord.
[16:38] We love you. Every brother and sister
[16:40] here, you care about, Father, those who
[16:42] are maybe even now, Lord, just hiding,
[16:45] Lord. They're scared. You care, Lord. We
[16:47] [music] thank you, Father. We commit
[16:49] this whole service to you, Lord. May you
[16:51] be just receive glory and honor, Lord.

[27:46] Uh each of you, I can't name you, but he
[27:49] names you.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; He has your name. And he knew everybody
[27:53] that's going to be here where you're
[27:54] going to sit.
[27:57] and uh I I prayed specifically
[28:01] in that direction because [snorts]
[28:04] because uh uh of what I'm going to speak
[28:07] on and I can't you can't cover it. You
[28:11] know I want to approach a subject where
[28:14] prophet of God said don't ask me I can't
[28:18] explain it
[28:20] and if he can't explain it and Jesus
[28:23] couldn't explain it
[28:25] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it
[28:27] &gt;&gt; and we can't explain it and sometimes we
[28:30] have to come to a place where we accept
[28:33] that
[28:35] &gt;&gt; without getting lax or lazy we say well
[28:38] I I just believe it Right.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I believe it exactly,
[28:43] but I believe it. My heart says, "Amen."
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; I remember a brother that came in
[28:53] [clears throat]
[28:54] uh into the message some years ago and
[28:57] uh he's passed away now. He wasn't real
[28:59] elderly, but he passed away. Brother
[29:02] Brother Amy Mulan.
[29:05] And uh he said he was an alcoholic
[29:09] and they tried everything.
[29:11] He tried he was a very very devout
[29:14] Catholic and they tried he tried
[29:17] everything. The family tried everything.
[29:19] He tried every program there was and he
[29:22] couldn't defeat his alcoholism.
[29:26] and uh his brother
[29:28] on the island came to the message from
[29:32] our radio broadcast
[29:35] and uh and uh and his brother, brother
[29:38] Amy, was delivered
[29:42] from alcohol.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; You remember him, Sister Violet?
[29:47] And he told me, he said, he said, "I'm
[29:50] just so amazed." He said, "I'm so
[29:52] amazed." He said, "I've tried
[29:54] everything. I even went down to the
[29:56] South Pacific to the islands and gave my
[29:59] life as a missionary and I thought
[30:02] surely I'll be delivered. I joined the
[30:04] choir in the Catholic church. I did
[30:07] everything. He said I couldn't overcome
[30:10] this. And then he said I I I just came
[30:12] to the knowledge of the message. He
[30:14] didn't know the message or understand it
[30:16] or all the things and he delivered.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; He thought wow. and he phoned his mother
[30:23] on the in Victoria
[30:26] and he said, "I'm delivered. I'm free."
[30:29] Oh yeah. She said, "We've heard that
[30:31] before.
[30:33] We've heard that before." Then he came
[30:34] to me. He says, "I'm so disappointed."
[30:36] He said, "My mother doesn't believe me."
[30:39] And uh he said, "What should I do?"
[30:43] I said, "Just leave it for 6 months."
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[30:47] &gt;&gt; So after 6 months, he called her. He
[30:49] says, "Hey, Mom. I'm delivered." Still
[30:52] delivered. She says, "Ah, I I've heard
[30:55] that before." You know, she expected him
[30:58] to fall off the wagon. So, I he said,
[31:01] "What should I do?" He came to me so
[31:03] disappointed. I said, "Wait for a year."
[31:06] So, he waited for a year and called him.
[31:09] And I'll tell you his his steadfastness
[31:12] and I have a message on that which I
[31:14] won't speak but his steadfastness
[31:17] overcame their unbelief.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; And you want to remember that
[31:24] &gt;&gt; your steadfastness
[31:26] &gt;&gt; can overcome. Light is stronger than
[31:28] darkness.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; God is stronger than the angels that
[31:32] fell.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; You he that's in you is stronger than
[31:38] Satan.
[31:41] stronger than any unbelief or any doubt
[31:43] or any shadow.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; You want to remember that always.
[31:48] And uh God is greater than any question
[31:51] that this human mind can gender up.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; And why is this and why is that? And
[31:58] he's greater.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; And that's sometimes where we have to
[32:02] come to believe.
[32:04] And I want to thank also those that have
[32:07] prayed
[32:09] uh prayed for me. We want to remember
[32:11] brother Harold Hillbrand. Brother John
[32:14] Andes was just up there uh preaching for
[32:17] them.
[32:19] And uh Brother Harold is very very weak
[32:22] in his body and we want to remember him
[32:25] in prayer.
[32:27] Brother Tom and Michael are in Texas,
[32:31] Dallas, Texas, actually at Bedford with
[32:34] Brother David McGary. And we are
[32:37] thankful for that. And I guess you have
[32:40] been moved. Have you, Brother Kyle?
[32:43] You're resident now of Duncan, British
[32:45] Columbia.
[32:48] God bless you.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; I have many friends over there. Cowatin
[32:53] and up the island.
[32:56] I trust they'll make contact with you.
[32:59] We'll do everything we can.
[33:04] Um,
[33:06] those of you that were in the service
[33:08] when brother David uh, brother Aaron
[33:10] McGary was here and he spoke on uh,
[33:15] unashamed,
[33:17] if you haven't heard it, and I did hear
[33:20] it. I was sitting in my chair. If I
[33:24] looked a wee bit stunned, I was
[33:26] [clears throat]
[33:29] uh he talked very fast,
[33:32] but every one of his sentences are a
[33:35] statement,
[33:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:37] &gt;&gt; And it was very powerful and very
[33:39] wonderful and I would uh I would
[33:42] recommend you hear it again. And I heard
[33:43] it again yesterday
[33:46] because also I was already
[33:49] uh studying and I was preparing for this
[33:52] service today which I would like to
[33:55] speak on the son of man.
[33:58] And because that is Jesus Christ,
[34:02] uh who can
[34:04] who can
[34:06] in a speech or who can in a message or
[34:09] who can in a sermon get around that
[34:11] subject?
[34:13] and
[34:15] he uh he said some words and I I I want
[34:19] to
[34:21] I want to convey to you today you know
[34:24] just some of the things how uh perhaps I
[34:28] personally approach things
[34:30] uh one of the things as I as I read the
[34:33] message I don't ever just read the
[34:35] message to read a sermon
[34:38] that isn't why I I want to
[34:42] sometimes See, you know, why did he
[34:44] approach this at this time?
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; In this ministry, I wonder how many
[34:50] times he approached it.
[34:54] And so I was wondering, I have never
[34:55] spoke on the messianic sign or the sign
[34:59] of Messiah.
[35:01] And we know that brother David said,
[35:04] brother uh Aaron said something very
[35:06] very interesting. He said the sign
[35:10] attracted the people
[35:12] &gt;&gt; and that is true. I lived in that era
[35:16] and the revelation of the son of man
[35:20] scattered them
[35:21] &gt;&gt; and that is very true.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; So the sign of Messiah attracted the
[35:26] people and I saw them in the thousands
[35:29] and tens of thousands and then the
[35:32] revelation of him
[35:35] scattered the people.
[35:37] But that never deterred
[35:39] the prophet of God. Whether there were
[35:42] whether there was 20, 30,000 or 300,000,
[35:48] he would preach it. If there was 30,
[35:51] &gt;&gt; yes,
[35:52] &gt;&gt; he would preach it.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; And that's what's that's when it's
[35:56] really wonderful.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:00] Uh [clears throat]
[36:02] so I was curious to know how many times
[36:06] and when did brother Brham speak on the
[36:11] sign of Messiah or the messianic sign.
[36:15] He said the world is looking for a
[36:17] messiah. Russia would like a messiah.
[36:20] Everybody wants a messiah to get them
[36:22] out of their maybe their economic
[36:24] dilemma or their military dilemma or
[36:27] whatever more.
[36:29] Uh he anyway he preached on the
[36:31] messianic sign. He mentioned it once in
[36:35] 1956
[36:38] and he preached that was the first time
[36:41] he said Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[36:44] today and forever.
[36:46] He preaches and he uses the term the
[36:49] messianic sign.
[36:51] He used it once in 1958.
[36:56] Where is he? King of the Jews.
[37:00] He used it twice
[37:03] in 1961. That was the first time I took
[37:06] him for a rest. And and both messages
[37:10] were, "Sir, we would see Jesus."
[37:14] And one of them he said, "Would you like
[37:16] to see him?"
[37:19] &gt;&gt; I can't do that.
[37:22] But he knew that the one that sent him
[37:26] would stand by him and perform the sign
[37:31] of revealing the secrets of the hearts
[37:33] of the people.
[37:35] And so he did it twice in 1961 and and
[37:38] both of them were in services as sers we
[37:41] would see Jesus
[37:43] then once in 1962.
[37:46] Is this the sign of the end sers? That
[37:50] was the last service of 1962
[37:54] before the seals would be opened in
[37:56] 1963.
[37:58] And then he spoke it once in 1963. Jesus
[38:02] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[38:04] forever.
[38:06] Spoke it 13 times in 1964.
[38:13] And those services are identification.
[38:17] A greater than Solomon is here now.
[38:22] The identification of Jesus Christ in
[38:24] all ages.
[38:27] Scriptural sign of the time.
[38:31] And three times the presence of God
[38:35] unrecognized. Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; And then once in Who is Jesus?
[38:42] Once the last time in ' 64, the mighty
[38:46] God unveiled
[38:52] the sign of Messiah, Messianic sign.
[38:56] And once in 1965, who is this Melzdc?
[39:02] And each one of those is
[39:05] he uses the phrase a messianic sign. So
[39:08] buried somewhere in there
[39:12] is uh so brother Kobus, you send your
[39:16] report once a week and I read it every
[39:18] week
[39:20] about how many sentences and how many
[39:23] books and how many messages and how many
[39:25] languages
[39:27] and uh
[39:30] uh working with our brother Tim Dodd
[39:34] and I would say that the fact that
[39:37] there's another two or 300 sentences
[39:41] that have been translated almost every
[39:43] week and sometimes six and 700.
[39:46] I think of the people that are able to
[39:49] read this in those languages in Chaluba
[39:53] and and different languages of Africa
[39:57] and the world and how wonderful and how
[40:00] glorious it is. Who who are we? Who
[40:03] who's this church? What are we that God
[40:06] should allow us to take the Chinese
[40:09] Bible?
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; And who are we that God would bring a
[40:14] person by on his way to the other side
[40:18] of Canada, Brother Murphy and Sister
[40:20] Tracy, young couple, just married,
[40:25] no children as yet. And here they stop
[40:28] here and are baptized in this tank in
[40:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[40:36] 18 years later,
[40:39] &gt;&gt; uh it's believers.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:43] like you people here
[40:45] that say
[40:48] uh you know that's why everybody has
[40:52] their own particular nature and the
[40:55] Chinese people
[40:57] have a work ethics and have a certain
[41:01] nature to be precise.
[41:04] So they wrote down
[41:07] that's not what our Bible says. They
[41:10] wrote it down
[41:12] and made a reference and then another
[41:14] time wrote it down, they made a diary of
[41:16] it. A few years went by, they said,
[41:19] "Well, what are we going to do?" And the
[41:22] first time I heard translate the Bible,
[41:25] I just said, "That's massive."
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; That's impossible.
[41:31] But who are we? Who who is who is this
[41:34] church? I don't care how many people we
[41:36] have. Who who are we that God would from
[41:40] the eternities would see in the end time
[41:44] I want this massive nation
[41:49] to have an accurate they deserve to have
[41:51] an accurate Bible.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; They don't deserve to have a Bible that
[41:57] doesn't say these three are one.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; They deserve to have it. And then who's
[42:04] going to do it?
[42:07] And then brother Brandham never went
[42:11] to China.
[42:13] And I thought this is incredible
[42:18] that God would even allow us or permit
[42:20] us or allow us to handle it and bring
[42:24] somebody by who has it in his heart.
[42:27] This has to happen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[42:30] &gt;&gt; friends. This isn't beams of light and
[42:36] this isn't uh voices out of the
[42:39] eternities. This is just in the hearts
[42:41] of people.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; We we got to do this. Amen.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And I have never apologized to my wife
[42:48] as many times as I have in the last 2 or
[42:52] 3 years
[42:54] for dragging her
[42:56] because she's typing from her little
[43:00] calendar where we've traveled. And that
[43:02] almost discourages me
[43:05] because I realize that, you know, I was
[43:09] away from the local congregation. when I
[43:12] was away from my family and a few times
[43:16] a few times, you know, holidays and all
[43:18] the rest of it
[43:20] and and and yet I'm in the mountains
[43:22] with the prophet of God and he just he
[43:25] stops and takes his hat off. He says,
[43:28] "It's our anniversary."
[43:33] Well, God bless God bless his wife. No
[43:36] wonder he spoke about it the way he did.
[43:38] He said, "It's our anniversary." He just
[43:40] bowed his head for a moment. [laughter]
[43:45] Who Who are we to be able to take a
[43:48] message that God confirmed?
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; And the angel of God said, "I'll be with
[43:54] you."
[43:55] &gt;&gt; And then we're able to testify and say,
[43:59] "I know the same God that delivered Amy
[44:02] Mulan. I know the same God that spoke to
[44:05] me. Can I explain everything?" No, I
[44:07] can't explain everything.
[44:10] And that's what brother Amy said to me.
[44:13] He said,
[44:15] he said, "My mind, theologically,
[44:18] I could find a thousand things, you
[44:22] know, wrong. I could debate it in my
[44:25] mind, but he said, I couldn't debate it.
[44:27] It worked."
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:29] &gt;&gt; It worked. [laughter]
[44:31] &gt;&gt; He was delivered. Take that, Satan. I'm
[44:34] delivered.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:38] So, is it all right if we approach it
[44:41] that way?
[44:43] &gt;&gt; I'll have you stand and we're going to
[44:44] read some scripture out of Matthew's
[44:46] Gospel, 16th chapter.
[45:01] I'll read from the 13th uh verse down to
[45:06] the I'm sorry from the 13th verse. Yes.
[45:10] Down to verse 17.
[45:15] And just before we read, we'll just ask
[45:17] him
[45:19] to be present with us. Lord Jesus,
[45:24] we are going to read of you.
[45:27] We're going to read certain words that
[45:29] you spoke
[45:31] and a question that you asked at that
[45:34] time. And I pray that today
[45:37] [crying]
[45:37] it will be a reality to each one. May we
[45:40] put ourselves there.
[45:43] May we put ourselves in the place that
[45:45] you are speaking
[45:47] and may we hear your voice as brother
[45:49] Kyle prayed.
[45:51] Father, I will thank you for allowing us
[45:56] to be able to just say something,
[45:59] scatter out the word,
[46:01] &gt;&gt; and it would speak to this individual,
[46:04] that individual. Perhaps it's for the
[46:07] future days. I do not know. Perhaps it's
[46:10] for something that's already transpired
[46:13] in their lives. But we are here as your
[46:16] children. We are here under the
[46:19] leadership of the Holy Spirit. And I
[46:22] pray that you will speak to the people
[46:26] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] Starting at the 13th verse, when Jesus
[46:34] came into the coast of Cesaria,
[46:36] Philippi,
[46:38] he asked his disciples, saying, and
[46:40] here's the question,
[46:43] whom
[46:45] do men say that I, the son of man, am?
[46:50] And they say, now remember, if you
[46:52] would, these disciples have already seen
[46:56] miracles.
[46:57] These disciples have already heard the
[47:00] voice of Jesus Christ.
[47:03] These disciples have ate with him.
[47:07] These disciples have heard his voice and
[47:10] they have spoken with him and they have
[47:14] questions as well as we do. And Jesus
[47:18] didn't answer them all.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; But he said what he needed to say. And
[47:23] this was one of the things.
[47:26] And they could have said, "Well, we walk
[47:28] with you. We eat with you. We we've
[47:30] slept in the same building.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; We've seen you tired. We've seen you
[47:35] weary. We've seen you prospire when
[47:39] you're hot.
[47:43] We We've seen you when
[47:46] you know, you've you've done things that
[47:48] we question perhaps if they were honest.
[47:51] Yeah,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; you were talking to a Samaritan woman at
[47:54] the well and that's a no no for us Jews.
[47:58] We would never talk to a Samaritan
[48:01] woman. But you were talking and not only
[48:03] that, some of us knew of her life and
[48:07] she was very ill-famed woman and then
[48:12] you're the son of God.
[48:15] So he said, "Who do men say that I am?"
[48:19] And they would go on, we go on the 14th
[48:21] verse. And they said, "Some say that
[48:24] thou art John the Baptist,
[48:27] some Elias, and others Jeremas
[48:31] or one of the prophets?" And he sith
[48:33] unto them, "But whom do whom say ye or
[48:39] whom say you that I am?" And Simon Peter
[48:44] answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[48:47] the Son of the living God." And Jesus
[48:50] answered and said unto him, "Blessed art
[48:54] thou, Simon Barjonah, or son of Jonah,
[48:57] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[49:01] unto thee, but my father which is in
[49:04] heaven." And do remember just before we
[49:06] sat down that Jesus was standing there
[49:10] in flesh and blood also.
[49:13] It wasn't his flesh and blood
[49:15] &gt;&gt; that revealed it to him.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; But my father which is in heaven. Do you
[49:19] accept that?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; I thought of you people that are on the
[49:23] balcony on this side from the
[49:25] Philippines and other places. And God
[49:27] bless you. I'm glad that you're here
[49:30] today.
[49:32] Amen.
[49:33] You may have your seats.
[49:43] I'll be showing some slides later on,
[49:45] but I'd like to just continue on with my
[49:48] thought. [clears throat]
[49:52] One of the and here's the focal thought.
[49:55] I'm just going to move out from this
[50:02] your attention now.
[50:05] the son of man, the the mystery around
[50:08] and what is mysterious isn't because we
[50:11] create a mystery, it is a mystery.
[50:14] uh the fact that Jesus was conceived
[50:19] of the Holy Ghost
[50:23] and born of a virgin.
[50:26] The that would take that would take a
[50:31] certain amount of acceptance without
[50:34] understanding.
[50:36] I don't understand how the Holy Ghost
[50:40] caused a virgin to conceive.
[50:44] How did that happen?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; You cannot physically tell me how that
[50:48] happened. You cannot scientifically tell
[50:51] me how that happened. But we're here
[50:53] today because we believe it happened.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Why do we believe it? Well, because I I
[51:00] know that he's living.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; I know that he can speak
[51:05] &gt;&gt; to the heart beyond my emotions. It
[51:08] doesn't require my emotions to I know
[51:11] that Satan can duplicate a lot of those
[51:13] things and make people believe. Oh,
[51:16] they're saved. Oh, you cried. You shed
[51:18] tears at the altar. Uh sinners do that
[51:22] and saved people do that. Redeemed the
[51:24] elect do that and the non-elect.
[51:26] Unbelievers do it.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; That doesn't prove anything. But we have
[51:31] heard him speak and we have had him do
[51:34] things uh supernatural things.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was conceived of the Holy Ghost
[51:41] and yet born of a virgin.
[51:44] That's a mystery. But that's he became
[51:48] the son of man. So he's called a son of
[51:52] man.
[51:53] He's born of a woman like you were born.
[51:56] We're all born of our mothers. And he
[52:00] was born of the Virgin Mary,
[52:04] but he is not of the seed of Joseph.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Just hold that. So he says, "Now, who do
[52:12] men say that I am? Who who do you say
[52:14] that I am?" Now he's talking to people
[52:18] like us believers.
[52:21] We We believe you're you we believe that
[52:25] you are the one that has sent. We
[52:27] believe you're the Messiah. We believe
[52:29] you're the anointed one.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; But there was uh
[52:35] there's something
[52:37] about that that I want to try to convey
[52:42] because Jesus also said before he passed
[52:46] and left us, he said this when you see
[52:49] the days of Sodom
[52:52] &gt;&gt; and we do.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you see the days of Noah,
[52:58] global trading,
[53:00] building, buys,
[53:03] planting, all of these things happening,
[53:05] just an economic furer
[53:09] &gt;&gt; happening.
[53:11] When you see that, even thus shall it be
[53:15] when the son of man is revealed.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So it is the revealing of him.
[53:23] It's not just mentally saying, "Well,
[53:25] uh, oh, that makes sense. Serpent seed
[53:28] makes sense. One God makes sense. That
[53:30] that's that's not what he's wanting to
[53:32] find out. But who do you say
[53:35] &gt;&gt; that I am?"
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Well, you are the anointed one. You've
[53:40] taken a darkened mind. You've taken a
[53:43] bound life. I've done everything. I've
[53:46] been in churches and churches and
[53:49] believed this and that and everything.
[53:52] But this is this is different. And you
[53:54] know why it's really different? Because
[53:57] it goes beyond your knowing.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Goes beyond your understanding. You run
[54:03] out of mental space.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And the reason I can talk about this is
[54:07] because I've been in the way for quite a
[54:10] few years and I pondered this for a lot
[54:12] of years.
[54:14] And when I say to you that that a
[54:18] gathering like this, this is not a
[54:20] church. Oh yes, it's a church as far as
[54:23] the people are concerned. It's a church
[54:25] like the Baptist church or the
[54:28] Pentecostal church or the Catholic
[54:30] church or some other church. It's a
[54:32] that's the you're talking about the
[54:34] building. And you're not even talking
[54:37] about the people. We have to talk about
[54:40] what this God
[54:45] who's revealing himself, this son of man
[54:49] that has come to the individuals and
[54:51] made you who you are.
[54:54] And and so we have we have
[54:58] if I'm going to be a little bit slow
[55:01] just now deliberate. We have a
[55:04] precalvary
[55:07] before the Calvary before the cross.
[55:11] We have Jesus. He's not gone to suffer
[55:13] yet. He's not shed his blood yet. He's
[55:16] not paid the sacrifice for sin yet. But
[55:19] he's asking them, "Who do you say that I
[55:22] am?"
[55:24] And then he said,
[55:27] he said, "Now a time will come and there
[55:29] will be another day and it'll be a day
[55:31] of there will be a global situation like
[55:34] it'll be like unto Sodom and it'll be
[55:36] like unto
[55:38] the time of Noah."
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; At the time of the flood when all of
[55:42] those conditions were happening. And and
[55:45] when you see that, that's this day.
[55:48] That's the sign.
[55:50] That's the day it'll be like when the
[55:52] son of man is revealed.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the problem
[55:58] in our time
[56:00] &gt;&gt; because you
[56:03] have been somehow you've been attracted
[56:05] or you've been in a home or you somehow
[56:08] God almighty God. And I'll I want to
[56:12] address that
[56:14] uh the way the prophet of God and you'll
[56:16] see how I I I will just tell you friend
[56:19] because I think you believe me.
[56:22] I sometimes read as I have and I will
[56:25] read for you some of the most startling
[56:29] things and I dissect it word by word
[56:33] and I'll say
[56:35] who can say that?
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Who can describe that? Yes.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; In one moment, in one moment, this
[56:43] prophet of God who you who we know as a
[56:47] brother William Brandham,
[56:50] we're not debating my daddy's greater
[56:52] than your daddy. It has nothing. This is
[56:55] greater than the denomination.
[56:57] I can understand why he just tore them
[57:00] to shreds.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Because they have lied to the people.
[57:04] Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; They have made the people to believe
[57:07] that if you have this or if you believe
[57:10] this history or if you believe of this
[57:13] the our background, we are the church.
[57:17] Oh, you're dust and ashes.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; True.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And people hold people in in in some
[57:26] kind of theory.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God comes along and
[57:29] says, "That's adulterous.
[57:32] That's a spiritual adultery
[57:35] &gt;&gt; as soon as you've denominated and now
[57:37] you have something a structure for the
[57:39] people to believe in. And then Satan
[57:42] comes right in who's the author of it
[57:44] all. And he gives the he gives those
[57:46] people come in. They have the same
[57:48] emotions. They sing and they they get so
[57:53] happy and they clap their hands and they
[57:56] go through all the motions that you go
[57:58] through.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:01] And they have all the experiences
[58:04] perhaps that you have physically in the
[58:08] emotional realm, in the spirit realm. He
[58:10] can come so close. You have a memory.
[58:14] You have a conscience.
[58:16] You have a uh affection
[58:20] and have all of those things that are so
[58:23] close to you. And Satan can uses those
[58:27] to duplicate
[58:29] what people experience in their church
[58:34] &gt;&gt; and somehow feel well I I felt the
[58:37] spirit. No, no, you felt your own
[58:40] emotions.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; You felt your own self. You just got
[58:44] inspired. Well, I repented of my sins.
[58:47] No, no, no. You just got sorry for bad
[58:51] things you did.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You understand me? Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And then and then it gets it gets uh so
[58:59] that it duplicates or attempts to
[59:02] duplicate
[59:04] this the spiritual the actual spiritual
[59:07] thing that God does when he convicts a
[59:10] person and they say yes Lord I come. Yes
[59:14] Lord I surrender. There's a genuine side
[59:17] but it's kind of mysterious. You say
[59:19] well how can you how can you tell? Well,
[59:23] it's it goes into that part we can't
[59:26] explain.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Who is this son of man
[59:33] that has talked to you? Who is this?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; It's it I can tell you that it's a lot
[59:39] more than you can figure out.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; It's a lot more than just coming to a
[59:45] place where you hear about it. And it's
[59:48] a lot more than just quotes.
[59:51] It's a lot more than just things that
[59:53] you hear because it is the one who spoke
[59:56] that is actually coming personally to
[59:59] you
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; personally to you.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; So you excuse me as I read
[1:00:07] in a message Christ is the mystery of
[1:00:09] God revealed. [clears throat]
[1:00:12] There's a phrase, notice
[1:00:15] this is at the time that the son of man
[1:00:18] would be revealed,
[1:00:21] the revealing of the son of man. So I
[1:00:25] want to say to you genuine believers
[1:00:28] and that's why you're here
[1:00:33] and perhaps God wants to
[1:00:36] speak very deeply to you and I wanted to
[1:00:38] speak to the sheep.
[1:00:42] It is in the re as as brother Aaron
[1:00:45] McGuri said, it is at the time of the
[1:00:47] revealing.
[1:00:49] That's the difficulty. And I'll tell you
[1:00:52] why it's a difficulty. That's why I'm
[1:00:53] standing here today is because don't try
[1:00:55] to figure it out. Don't try to get it
[1:00:59] all just sorted out in your mind because
[1:01:03] you can't do that. And that's why that's
[1:01:05] why brother Brandham said, "Don't ask
[1:01:07] me. Don't please don't ask me to explain
[1:01:11] it. I can't explain it.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; And in the unveiling of God, in the
[1:01:16] unveiling of God,
[1:01:18] and I had not noticed before, in fact,
[1:01:21] as I have all of the all the I I I
[1:01:25] labored over this for many many many
[1:01:28] hours and many days, and for some weeks,
[1:01:31] I have been pondering this subject.
[1:01:36] And uh it's in the revealing
[1:01:39] of the son of man.
[1:01:41] If you get real tired, I'll have you
[1:01:43] just stand and we'll
[1:01:46] relax a little bit and sit back down. Is
[1:01:48] that all right?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. The son of man
[1:02:03] precalvary.
[1:02:06] What the people could not comprehend was
[1:02:10] the son of man was actually made the son
[1:02:15] of god.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; The word was made flesh. Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible even says of Jesus that he
[1:02:25] became
[1:02:26] he became
[1:02:29] uh [clears throat]
[1:02:31] perfected
[1:02:33] by the things that he suffered. He was a
[1:02:36] man. He suffered things.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; He experienced things. He wept.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; He knew what that was. Yeah,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; he had all of that as the son of man.
[1:02:51] And there was a part of it that he could
[1:02:53] not convey even to the disciples
[1:02:58] in the in the unveiling of God. He said
[1:03:01] there were the multitudes there
[1:03:04] and you can read it in the scripture.
[1:03:05] The multitudes were there. And then he
[1:03:08] he he's not speaking the sermon on the
[1:03:10] mount. Now, he's further on down saying,
[1:03:14] and I'm going to make some statements.
[1:03:20] He said, "Except you eat my flesh and
[1:03:23] drink my blood."
[1:03:25] Now, I will quote brother Brandham. He
[1:03:27] says, "He never explained it."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Why? It couldn't be explained.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; There was no way for a human to
[1:03:38] understand it. But humanly they were
[1:03:41] able to sort it out and say, we've read
[1:03:44] in the Torah, we've read in the Bible
[1:03:48] where it says, "Thou shalt not, it's a
[1:03:52] blasphemous thing to eat the flesh of a
[1:03:55] man or drink his blood."
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes on to say, and
[1:03:59] I'm so glad that God directed him in
[1:04:02] such a way. He goes on to say, he wants
[1:04:05] us to be cannibals. He wants us to be
[1:04:07] vampires.
[1:04:09] because that's the conclusion they would
[1:04:11] come to
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; just from a cultured educated mind.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; It's not a cultured educated mind that
[1:04:20] figures out the supernatural things.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's faith
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; that you can't see and you can't feel
[1:04:26] and you can't handle faith. What is
[1:04:29] faith? You just believe it.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; They have things in science that science
[1:04:33] runs out of space. The bumblebee is not
[1:04:36] supposed to fly, but he does well. at
[1:04:39] flying. His body is too big for his
[1:04:41] wings, but he he flies very well. And uh
[1:04:44] and we just believe it.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Well, we we've we've seen it happen. I
[1:04:49] can't figure it out. Science can't
[1:04:51] figure it out.
[1:04:54] Why does the Why do Why does the cow eat
[1:04:57] green grass and give white milk? I don't
[1:04:59] know. What is the process? I don't know.
[1:05:02] I don't intend to ever know. But it's
[1:05:04] not going to stop me from pouring milk
[1:05:06] on my porridge in the morning. Amen.
[1:05:08] Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; I still will do that. Why? Because I
[1:05:11] just accept it. There are things in this
[1:05:13] life we just accept it.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; We just believe it.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And there are simple things.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; You know what? It's just ugly not to
[1:05:22] accept it.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; It's nasty just not to accept it. We
[1:05:28] just accept it. All kinds of things in
[1:05:31] this life we don't understand. I I'm not
[1:05:35] uh even the brightest of minds, whether
[1:05:38] it be Stephen Hawking or whether it be
[1:05:41] Einstein himself,
[1:05:44] they've run out of space.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; They can't explain things. And we and uh
[1:05:50] so that's just the way it is. But precal
[1:05:56] on that side of Calvary
[1:05:59] there was an aspect of the son of man
[1:06:01] that was
[1:06:03] difficult to say the least and post
[1:06:07] Calvary after Calvary in this day in the
[1:06:11] revealing of the son of man and you say
[1:06:13] why are you laboring I'm laboring over
[1:06:16] this because
[1:06:18] that is one of the major problems within
[1:06:21] in the message
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; is [clears throat] the is the son of
[1:06:25] man. And I'd like to announce to them
[1:06:28] and to all that are streaming and to all
[1:06:31] that you may speak to, you will never
[1:06:33] fully understand it. You must fully
[1:06:37] believe it.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And then you just understand it. And it
[1:06:42] becomes so real to you.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to you.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot let go of it. Right.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew those disciples couldn't
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; couldn't understand it. And then he goes
[1:06:58] into the unveiling of God. In the
[1:07:00] unveiling of God, I'm so thankful for
[1:07:02] it. It's in the opening pages.
[1:07:06] And please don't become too weary with
[1:07:08] me. I want to take my time with this.
[1:07:10] But in the opening pages, he said, you
[1:07:12] know, except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:07:14] my blood. and and and he said, "What
[1:07:16] would an educated person, a medically
[1:07:19] scientific person, what would they say
[1:07:21] of that? He wants us to be a vampire or
[1:07:24] cannibal." That's what he's teaching.
[1:07:25] He's teaching those things. So they
[1:07:28] said, "And that and the multitudes
[1:07:30] flocked away from him."
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Then he had 70 which
[1:07:36] he had called
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; to the ministry. and 70 which he had
[1:07:41] called and chosen and sent them out
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; to carry the message
[1:07:48] and uh
[1:07:51] they couldn't understand it either
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; and then he he took them a step further.
[1:07:56] What was the next step he took them to?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; You see the son of man ascend up to him.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. When you see the son of man ascend
[1:08:02] up
[1:08:04] where he was before.
[1:08:07] And they said, "Well, we we've seen the
[1:08:10] cradle where he where he was rocked in.
[1:08:13] We know when he was a baby. We know when
[1:08:15] he was a child. His father's here. His
[1:08:17] mother's here." And they thought it was
[1:08:20] his father.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; They didn't understand and weren't able
[1:08:23] to believe the son of man. His father
[1:08:25] was not Joseph. But they and I have the
[1:08:28] scriptures right here. And it it uh
[1:08:35] where they he spoke of the it's also in
[1:08:38] Matthew
[1:08:45] uh
[1:08:49] and they all this is rather in Luke 4:22
[1:08:53] and all bear him witness and wondered at
[1:08:56] the gracious words which were proceeded
[1:08:59] out of his mouth and they said, "Is not
[1:09:03] this Joseph's son?"
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That's what was commonly believed. Is
[1:09:09] not this Joseph's son? Big mistake,
[1:09:13] folks.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Big mistake. You've already bypassed the
[1:09:17] son of man.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; You're you're gone into, you know, some
[1:09:22] physical. Does it make sense with your
[1:09:23] mind? Yeah. Yeah, it makes good sense.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; But a huge mistake. You can never come
[1:09:31] to the revelation of the son of man.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible, I should say the
[1:09:38] prophet of God says he was left with the
[1:09:40] 70. And [clears throat] they couldn't
[1:09:42] explain because we've seen where he was.
[1:09:46] We've and that is why I don't make a big
[1:09:48] emphasis on I'm being honest now about
[1:09:52] where the sword came into brother
[1:09:54] Brandham's hand and the sunset mountain
[1:09:57] and and the rock and all of these
[1:09:59] places. Jesus never took anybody back to
[1:10:02] where he was born. He never took anybody
[1:10:05] back to to the grave that he raised and
[1:10:09] to show them the tomb was empty. They
[1:10:11] went there actually because of their the
[1:10:14] women wanted to anoint his body with
[1:10:17] spices
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; and the tomb was empty and they're the
[1:10:22] ones that saw the angels etc. They're
[1:10:25] the ones that had to come back to the
[1:10:27] apostles.
[1:10:29] So I'm I'm I'm sorry folks and yet I'm
[1:10:32] not sorry.
[1:10:34] They had to come back. The ladies had to
[1:10:36] come back to the apostles who were
[1:10:38] barred up in a room because of their
[1:10:41] fear. And the prophet of God now
[1:10:43] explains that he said he was left then
[1:10:45] with 12 and the 70 left.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Now he's left with 12. He says, "And one
[1:10:51] of them is a devil."
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I I don't I don't want to I
[1:10:58] I don't want to join that group." Didn't
[1:11:00] you just hear what their treasurer did?
[1:11:02] He went and hung himself.
[1:11:04] He did. Oh yeah. I don't want nothing to
[1:11:07] do with that. No, you don't want to have
[1:11:09] anything to do with that group.
[1:11:12] And the others, they don't they don't
[1:11:14] know. They can't explain it either. And
[1:11:18] Peter even cursed and said he's not a
[1:11:22] part. They said, "But your language
[1:11:24] betrays you."
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; These people talk about a bride and they
[1:11:30] talk about things that others don't talk
[1:11:32] about. Yeah, we do have a language that
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; is rather rare.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And we do talk about things that we
[1:11:42] don't understand. But we don't talk
[1:11:45] about things we don't believe. We
[1:11:47] believe it.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; We believe there will be a rapture.
[1:11:50] Absolutely believe it. I believe he that
[1:11:53] put cells in this body are is the same
[1:11:56] one that can tell them and instruct them
[1:11:58] to do what they want to do. And you're
[1:12:00] looking at a speaker now. I I I listened
[1:12:03] to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
[1:12:06] when they were interviewing a short time
[1:12:08] ago, not a short time, a few few short
[1:12:10] years ago, they were interviewing a a a
[1:12:14] very well-educated a leading medical
[1:12:19] uh doctor or professor, I don't know
[1:12:23] which. And they were asking him and they
[1:12:25] were talking about cancer. And he said
[1:12:28] the cells in the body, the human cell
[1:12:31] and they and brother Brandon was talking
[1:12:33] about the cells in the 1950 and one goes
[1:12:35] wild and there's a bruise and one goes
[1:12:39] wild and he describes it he describes it
[1:12:42] better than the doctors. But he he says
[1:12:46] something that he has a connection to
[1:12:49] the author and the creator
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; that the medical guy hasn't got. And so
[1:12:56] he says
[1:12:59] cells in the body are time locked
[1:13:04] and they at a certain point they stop
[1:13:06] replicating themselves. He said why do
[1:13:10] they do that? He said we don't know
[1:13:13] there they have a time sense. He said,
[1:13:17] "Where they stop replicating themselves
[1:13:19] and they just start dying
[1:13:21] and you're aging."
[1:13:26] Really?
[1:13:27] Yeah. And and and the one that was in u
[1:13:33] in you know asking him the questions
[1:13:37] says why did they do that? He said, "We
[1:13:39] don't know, but there's a certain time
[1:13:42] and that they have a time lock in them
[1:13:44] and they just start deteriorating."
[1:13:49] And then he describes cancer. And then
[1:13:51] they asked him, "What do you what do you
[1:13:54] foresee in the future?" He said, "Well,
[1:13:56] what would you think about I don't
[1:13:58] know." He said, "But it's quite possible
[1:14:01] they may have bloodless operations
[1:14:05] with no blood."
[1:14:08] And oh, how he couldn't he couldn't
[1:14:11] explain that, but he said that they
[1:14:13] might do that. Well, it might be. Maybe
[1:14:15] maybe he was talking about the laser.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Laser shaving and laser cuts and so on
[1:14:23] so forth, which they do today.
[1:14:26] But here's a here here's a man that he
[1:14:29] couldn't just tell why. So we say now so
[1:14:33] it won't it won't fright you if I say
[1:14:36] well we believe things that we can't
[1:14:37] explain
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; and so Jesus now through the prophet of
[1:14:43] God Jesus is telling us
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; now I get I don't I don't want you to
[1:14:52] misunderstand that
[1:14:54] but Jesus is telling us we needed to
[1:14:57] hear it
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; we needed to hear this message.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; We needed to hear things that he told us
[1:15:05] through a human's mouth.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And some people could see.
[1:15:12] Well, I'm going to give you a very
[1:15:13] personal testimony just now. Brother
[1:15:16] Brandham said to me, he said,
[1:15:19] "Brother Organbrite
[1:15:22] and some of the brothers want to take
[1:15:25] him
[1:15:26] uh to the Kodiak Islands in Alaska where
[1:15:30] the giant bears are and so on because
[1:15:33] they only could see him as as a hunter.
[1:15:38] And what was in my heart was to give him
[1:15:40] arrest
[1:15:42] whether he shot anything or that that is
[1:15:44] irrelevant. They just wanted to give him
[1:15:46] a rest. The woman in the Bible,
[1:15:50] she said she didn't notice Elijah or
[1:15:53] Elias. She just saw a holy man. She
[1:15:56] said, "This holy man that walks by," she
[1:15:59] said to her husband, "Can we not give
[1:16:02] him a could we not make a little room
[1:16:04] here in the
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; in the basement?" And maybe uh yes,
[1:16:09] it'll cost us a little bit, but couldn't
[1:16:11] we have a room and have a bed for him to
[1:16:13] lay down on?
[1:16:15] a picture of water and something. What
[1:16:18] is she talking about? Great mysteries.
[1:16:20] No, this is just things that women do
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; and it was in her realm.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And they said, uh, well, so they created
[1:16:28] that it was a prophet of God.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; She didn't know it was the prophet of
[1:16:33] God. I didn't know it was a prophet of
[1:16:35] God. I didn't know about Malachi 4. I
[1:16:39] hadn't put that together yet. But as
[1:16:42] soon as he spoke it out of his mouth, I
[1:16:44] said, "Of course.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Of course."
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Everything I've seen. Now, that
[1:16:49] interprets everything I've ever seen
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; in his life and in his ministry. Of
[1:16:54] course.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Of the 12 that he
[1:17:00] was left with, and one destroyed
[1:17:03] himself, became the son of predition."
[1:17:07] And he said and the other 11
[1:17:10] he said they could not understand it and
[1:17:13] they could not explain it. So that is
[1:17:16] why I'm going very slow because I want
[1:17:19] I'm I want to announce to you that you
[1:17:23] believe something you cannot fully
[1:17:26] explain or understand. So don't even
[1:17:29] try.
[1:17:31] He says, "And if you do, if if if
[1:17:34] there's a hungry heart like the woman at
[1:17:37] the well, she was a a failure in life,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; but she needed the answer that the son
[1:17:47] of man had."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And there may be somebody here today,
[1:17:52] young or old, I'm not going to appeal to
[1:17:54] anybody
[1:17:56] or beg you to come forward. I'm not
[1:17:58] going to do that. But I am going to say
[1:18:02] you will need to believe something that
[1:18:04] goes beyond
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; your teaspoon of ashes up here.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It has to go beyond figuring things out.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; It has to go beyond your time zone into
[1:18:17] some plague that faith lays a hold of
[1:18:19] it.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Faith is something that just happens. It
[1:18:24] you just see it and it becomes so clear.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And so now we're on this side of Calvary
[1:18:36] where
[1:18:38] the the the there's a mysterious part of
[1:18:42] the Son of Man. And I want to explain
[1:18:43] that just a little bit. Is that all
[1:18:45] right?
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And this comes right down to your
[1:18:50] address.
[1:18:57] on this side of Calvary.
[1:19:00] One of the difficulties
[1:19:02] and I hear the brothers preaching and I
[1:19:06] see God seeking to drive it down to tell
[1:19:10] you who you are.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to believe
[1:19:16] that he was something that he couldn't
[1:19:18] prove.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Right. He couldn't prove he was virgin
[1:19:24] born.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; He couldn't prove he was conceived of
[1:19:28] the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; He couldn't prove that. And
[1:19:33] incidentally, if you have a real
[1:19:36] mature mind,
[1:19:39] he came from the other side of the womb.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And broke the veil coming out.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; She was virgin
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; and he was conceived of the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And was birthed. He couldn't prove any
[1:20:06] of that,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; but he believed it.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; He believed it. Jesus, your savior,
[1:20:13] believed some things he couldn't
[1:20:15] explain. Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And he didn't try to explain it. And you
[1:20:20] can't explain it and I can't explain it,
[1:20:24] but I believe it.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I believe he's the virgin born son
[1:20:28] [snorts] of the living God.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And when when Peter said to him, "Thou
[1:20:34] art the Christ, the son of the living
[1:20:37] God." Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Blessed art thou,
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Simon Barjonah,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; you want to be blessed of the Father."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; We believe these things. Yes. And I
[1:20:51] believe that God sent a vessel in this
[1:20:55] end time.
[1:21:01] And and folks,
[1:21:03] you have the privilege. You have the
[1:21:05] opportunity.
[1:21:08] You wouldn't want the Lord Jesus to come
[1:21:10] and stand in my suit and say, "Didn't
[1:21:14] you hear what I said?" Well, I I I Lord,
[1:21:17] I didn't know it was you that was saying
[1:21:19] it. I thought it was William Brandon
[1:21:20] that was saying it. No, no, it was me.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you know it's the same question I
[1:21:26] asked Peter? I ask, "Who do men say that
[1:21:29] I am?"
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Well, some say you're this and some say
[1:21:33] you're that and some say you're
[1:21:34] something else.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; But who do you say it?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; It's not what other people say, it's
[1:21:40] what you say. It's not what some other
[1:21:42] church says. It's what you say.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; What is your confession?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And your confession will be will be
[1:21:52] something beyond your human
[1:21:54] understanding. It will be. SAY, WHY DO I
[1:21:57] BELIEVE THIS? I DON'T KNOW WHY I believe
[1:21:59] it, but I do believe it.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I believe it because he has done things
[1:22:05] for me. He's picked me up. He's made me
[1:22:08] INTO A PERSON I COULDN'T BE any other
[1:22:11] way.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And that's the crux of the message. And
[1:22:19] that's why your prophet spoke the
[1:22:23] message. Who do you say this is?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I'm reading that message right now. So I
[1:22:34] want to know what does he say?
[1:22:37] I'm not asking what does he say?
[1:22:41] What did that son of man,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; this Lord Jesus Christ say?
[1:22:48] Uh my wife may is here and she may not
[1:22:52] know but
[1:22:55] she said I'm trying to get that message
[1:22:57] that you spoke the other angel.
[1:23:01] How many have heard that
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:06] in 1978?
[1:23:11] And my wife says to me in the last two
[1:23:13] days she said I don't think you even
[1:23:15] know what you said there.
[1:23:19] and she just hung her head and she said
[1:23:24] that message.
[1:23:26] I said, "Well, I remember
[1:23:29] speaking
[1:23:30] saying Moses went to the wilderness. He
[1:23:34] went to the wilderness a failure. He
[1:23:36] went to the wilderness a murderer that
[1:23:39] you wouldn't want to follow. You
[1:23:41] wouldn't want to say, "Well, this is our
[1:23:42] prophet that we follow." And others
[1:23:45] would say, "Oh, I know that he's accused
[1:23:48] of murdering an Egyptian."
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:23:54] That's your Bible.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; That's your word of God.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; This is the true book of the word of
[1:24:02] God.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what it says.
[1:24:06] Now, friends, I just I don't want us to
[1:24:08] be hypocritical.
[1:24:11] We want to be honest with oursel. say,
[1:24:13] "Would I follow him?"
[1:24:16] Well, God called the people that
[1:24:18] followed him his people.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And God has called the people that
[1:24:23] follow this message his elect.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; His elect lady,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; the almighty God. Let Let me just I'm
[1:24:33] going to bypass a couple of things here
[1:24:36] and and do you mind if I
[1:24:44] This is one of the most profound.
[1:24:50] We may call it a quote. It's beyond a
[1:24:52] quote.
[1:24:54] And I want you to just take your time,
[1:24:56] please, and absorb it.
[1:25:02] Now a prophet he's talking about his his
[1:25:05] purpose God's purpose
[1:25:09] and he says
[1:25:11] we want to find out
[1:25:14] what this three-fold
[1:25:17] purpose
[1:25:19] the first thing was that God wanted to
[1:25:24] reveal himself I'm talking about a God
[1:25:29] well I'll let him explain it. He says he
[1:25:32] couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God.
[1:25:35] He wanted to reveal himself. He wanted
[1:25:38] to make himself known.
[1:25:41] That was one of the things that was in
[1:25:42] him.
[1:25:44] And he says the great Jehovah God, he
[1:25:47] could not do it as a great Jehovah God
[1:25:51] who covered all space,
[1:25:55] all time, and eternity. He could not.
[1:25:59] Now, let's just stop there. If you want
[1:26:02] to figure something out, figure that one
[1:26:03] out.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; A being that covers all space and all
[1:26:07] time and all eternity.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, all you
[1:26:14] brilliant educated ones, give me the
[1:26:18] answer to that.
[1:26:21] You didn't want to hear this message,
[1:26:22] did you?
[1:26:26] He said he was too great to ever be
[1:26:28] revealed
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; to people
[1:26:32] because it would be too mysterious.
[1:26:38] How could that great being and I've
[1:26:40] thought about this now you're listening
[1:26:42] to me over the last few months. I've
[1:26:47] given I've given myself I've just
[1:26:49] pondered
[1:26:51] and I talk to him all the time and I
[1:26:54] recommend that you do that.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; I recommend that you talk to him.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Talk to the God
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; that you haven't seen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Talk to the God you can't figure out.
[1:27:08] talk to the God that's beyond the wisest
[1:27:12] of men and the wisest of theologians.
[1:27:16] I've got thick Bible encyclopedias
[1:27:21] and I tell you, I just get sick to my
[1:27:23] stomach reading and them trying to
[1:27:26] explain the Son of Man. I quit.
[1:27:31] I didn't read very very much. And you
[1:27:33] know what they said? This is where I
[1:27:36] stopped in the late 1960s. In the late
[1:27:39] 1960s,
[1:27:43] I was already late 1960s. The seals been
[1:27:47] open. The church ages have been preached
[1:27:49] and and God ascended and and REVEALED
[1:27:52] AND JESUS CHRIST REVEALED HIMSELF.
[1:27:54] Either that or Luke 17:30. Take it out
[1:27:57] of your Bible. But he's already revealed
[1:27:59] himself. Right.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And he says in the late 1960s the great
[1:28:04] scholars and the theologians and I I I
[1:28:08] was going down below zero by the time I
[1:28:12] got to that point.
[1:28:14] But the great this is and then I I I
[1:28:16] listened to what they had to say and
[1:28:18] they said in the late 1960s
[1:28:21] they determined that it was too
[1:28:24] contradictory
[1:28:26] to have the title of the son of man. Up
[1:28:30] to that time they had associated the
[1:28:32] title of the son of man and had
[1:28:35] interpreted it to be messianic or to be
[1:28:39] uh connected with the messiah uh because
[1:28:42] it would be too uh too contradictory
[1:28:47] to associate that title with the with
[1:28:50] the so in the 1960s they decided they
[1:28:53] wouldn't do that anymore and I just
[1:28:55] wrote them off then
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; because I thought Well, in the 1960s, we
[1:29:01] already had a prophet who couldn't
[1:29:03] explain couldn't explain it himself and
[1:29:06] and and says it. And and I'm I'm going
[1:29:09] to read you what a what a uh
[1:29:13] someone from Kentucky.
[1:29:16] That was the flesh man.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; But the son of man didn't start in
[1:29:20] Kentucky.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; He started his revealing.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. the revealing of himself in this
[1:29:28] end time.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; But the son of man is the son of
[1:29:33] [snorts] God,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And maybe I'll just drop this in.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was asked a question
[1:29:40] 1964.
[1:29:41] You all listening?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; They said, "Brother Brenham,
[1:29:47] some people say that the pillar fire is
[1:29:51] the son of man or that you are the son
[1:29:53] of man."
[1:29:56] And uh
[1:29:59] and and I've believed that the pillar
[1:30:01] fire is the son of man.
[1:30:04] And he says uh well that's a very good
[1:30:07] question.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; that's a very good question.
[1:30:13] He said, "Now I am a son of man,
[1:30:17] but I could not be the son of man." He
[1:30:20] said, "Jesus Christ was the son of man,
[1:30:24] the son of God."
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And the son of David.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "I couldn't be that."
[1:30:30] [laughter]
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Right. [panting]
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be the son of God and the
[1:30:35] son of David and the son of the son of
[1:30:39] David and the son of man. He couldn't be
[1:30:41] all of those. But he said it was a good
[1:30:44] question.
[1:30:46] He says, "I am a son of man." And this
[1:30:49] is the mysterious part.
[1:30:52] Revealing the son of man.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; And and that's where we run out of
[1:30:58] space. Don't try to figure that one out.
[1:31:01] And then someone says, "Well, I can read
[1:31:03] the quote, so I'm better than you." No,
[1:31:05] no, no, no.
[1:31:07] Let's just
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; figure this one out.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; How could that great being
[1:31:15] that never did begin?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:19] that after you went beyond the cycle of
[1:31:24] a hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:31:29] trillions of years of light space
[1:31:33] and on out into the infinite
[1:31:37] into the eternity
[1:31:39] and a great creature that was all that
[1:31:44] and still is.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Now, if we if we don't go any further,
[1:31:54] we've run out of
[1:31:57] all the aggregate all the collective
[1:32:00] wisdom of humanity.
[1:32:03] It's just a bunch of dust and ashes,
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; It's not going to But that doesn't do
[1:32:08] away with the son of man.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Now, listen closely, please.
[1:32:18] But what he wanted to do,
[1:32:22] what he wanted to do,
[1:32:27] he loved fatherhood.
[1:32:32] I I want you to just get this because
[1:32:34] you'll get into brother Biscll's
[1:32:38] heart and mind if that's worth anything.
[1:32:42] But what he wanted to do
[1:32:45] now he's in the past.
[1:32:48] He's way back. Who knows where
[1:32:52] maybe trillions and trillions of light
[1:32:54] years. I don't know.
[1:32:57] He wanted
[1:33:00] he loves fatherhood
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to make himself known
[1:33:06] to people.
[1:33:08] Listen
[1:33:11] folks,
[1:33:14] this being,
[1:33:16] this kind of God that you call father
[1:33:21] wanted to reveal himself to you.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And in order to do that and then he goes
[1:33:29] on,
[1:33:30] now this to me is absolute evidence of a
[1:33:34] prophet.
[1:33:37] what he wanted to do. Are you listening?
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; He loved in this being. Now, now we have
[1:33:48] somebody standing here on earth
[1:33:51] preaching a service
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; and you and I with whatever intelligence
[1:33:56] we have, we can read it.
[1:33:59] He says, "And what he wanted to do,
[1:34:03] and then he breaks off,
[1:34:06] he said he loved, still in the past, he
[1:34:10] loved fatherhood."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Here's this great being, eternal being.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; That you call your father.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can do that is
[1:34:23] because he loved fatherhood.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:34:27] and he wanted to be a father.
[1:34:32] Aren't you glad?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; There isn't a theologian in the world
[1:34:36] that can tell you that
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; and without any expense to yourself.
[1:34:43] You're invited.
[1:34:45] You're invited by this God. I want to
[1:34:49] show you who I am.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; G. And when I do, he knows we won't be
[1:34:56] able to comprehend it. He won't we won't
[1:34:59] be able to explain it, but he wants to
[1:35:02] make himself known. And the prophet of
[1:35:04] God says, "And he was he was past tense.
[1:35:10] He was a father.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; He loved fatherhood and he was a
[1:35:16] father." He goes and reaches into the
[1:35:18] very attributes and characteristics of
[1:35:22] God telling you and I in a plain simple
[1:35:26] language he loved fatherhood
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; because he was
[1:35:32] a father
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; and then now I'll loaded and the only
[1:35:40] way.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Would you say that with me please? only
[1:35:45] way. Would you say it once more, please?
[1:35:48] Only way. And the only way that he could
[1:35:53] express it, that's what he wanted to do.
[1:35:56] The only way that he could express it
[1:36:01] was to become
[1:36:03] a son of man.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; One that you call, oh, the Lord Jesus.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:36:13] [gasps and sighs] You may call him Lord
[1:36:14] Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus.
[1:36:17] But when you would when you speak of
[1:36:19] him, think of this word. The He's the
[1:36:22] only way.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; It's the only way that this eternal God
[1:36:28] could come down
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; and come into a body.
[1:36:36] He had to conceive
[1:36:38] a woman. And now we have a simple
[1:36:41] prophet of God come out of your nation
[1:36:44] of America
[1:36:46] out of Kentucky and speak things
[1:36:50] that would be unlawful
[1:36:53] almost to say,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; right? But he speaks things and he
[1:36:57] explains to us and he says the words of
[1:37:00] the prophets in the Old Testament. He
[1:37:03] said their words anchored into the womb
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; of Mary
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; and brought forth Jesus Christ.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; AND WE CANNOT JUST SIT here glibly and
[1:37:16] and uh uh nonchalantly and oh Lord Jesus
[1:37:21] I love you. OH YOU JUST HAVE TO LOVE
[1:37:23] JESUS. FORGET IT, FRIENDS. Most of the
[1:37:25] PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
[1:37:27] HE IS.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; He's the expression of of the almighty
[1:37:33] one.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; This eternal God
[1:37:39] said, you go back trillions and
[1:37:41] trillions and trillions of light years,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; and he still is.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; He's all of that. And he still is.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the one he wanted to
[1:37:53] come down here to 183 06
[1:37:59] 186 street. He wanted to come down to
[1:38:01] Cloverdale.
[1:38:07] Call you brother John.
[1:38:11] Tell the people.
[1:38:13] Call your brother Tim.
[1:38:16] Yeah, we experience things
[1:38:22] and his arch enemy
[1:38:24] would love dearly to destroy you,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Destroy your family or destroy your
[1:38:32] personal self. But God says this God I'm
[1:38:37] speaking about says thus far and no
[1:38:40] further.
[1:38:41] [applause]
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] Who shall fear? And no wonder the
[1:38:47] apostle Paul and brother Aaron Mcgiri so
[1:38:50] eloquently spoke of the Apostle Paul
[1:38:52] could say, "Who will separate us from
[1:38:55] the love of God?"
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:39:01] God.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; WHO CAN ATTACK this kind of God?
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Light is greater than darkness.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Faith is greater than unbelief.
[1:39:13] In one place, the prophet of God says,
[1:39:15] "You may not believe, but we'll do it
[1:39:19] anyway.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It'll happen anyway."
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Because the faith that he had was
[1:39:28] greater than the darkness. I know. I sat
[1:39:32] with questions.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; I sat with questions and and my
[1:39:38] understanding of the scripture. And Adam
[1:39:40] knew his wife and she conceived and bore
[1:39:43] a son and she called HIS NAME CAIN. FOR
[1:39:45] I received a man from the Lord and I
[1:39:48] spoke that and he said that's exactly
[1:39:51] the truth,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; How could you say that?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's my defense.
[1:39:58] And he blew my defense away by agreeing
[1:40:01] with me.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; But you need to read the next verse.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And she again bore his brother Abel.
[1:40:09] Right.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And they were twins.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Soon as he said they were twins, he said
[1:40:14] they've always been twins.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I saw twins all through the scripture.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; So Isaac and Ishmael and Jacob and Esau.
[1:40:23] And then he went on. He says and Jesus
[1:40:25] and Judas.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And he said said people think three died
[1:40:30] at Calvary. He said there was actually
[1:40:31] four.
[1:40:34] He put his hand up like this. said Jesus
[1:40:38] the son of man took one to heaven and
[1:40:42] Judas the son of predition took one to
[1:40:45] hell.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Who could do that?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Who could say that? And he says, "And
[1:40:53] now antich Christ and Antichrist,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; they're still twins.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And every revival bears twins.
[1:41:04] Am
[1:41:06] I running across some things that you
[1:41:08] have found in the various messages?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; I trust so
[1:41:15] I'm I'm doing what I promised not to do
[1:41:18] this morning. Is it quarter 12? Is that
[1:41:22] what it is?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:41:27] [snorts] No, my watch has been stopping.
[1:41:32] I just wanted to make sure it hadn't
[1:41:33] stopped.
[1:41:37] I believe, friends, and I'm only on page
[1:41:40] one, but I I believe that it's
[1:41:42] imperative.
[1:41:46] I believe that it is urgent [sighs]
[1:41:50] and uh
[1:41:54] I'm going to go to a
[1:41:57] certain phrase.
[1:42:01] that brother Brham made.
[1:42:11] He was asked a question
[1:42:14] on baptism
[1:42:18] and he said
[1:42:24] for you that are teachers at BCA.
[1:42:31] He said, "Let me give you,"
[1:42:36] he said, "let me just give you a keynote
[1:42:39] on that."
[1:42:42] after he had read several pages or spoke
[1:42:46] several pages on the baptism and
[1:42:49] explaining it to this person how that
[1:42:53] Peter did not disobey the Lord Jesus in
[1:42:56] Matthew 28 and and Luke uh I'm sorry
[1:43:00] Acts 2 does not contravene well you you
[1:43:04] just know all of that but this is what
[1:43:06] he said about it he said now I'll just
[1:43:09] give you a keynote on That
[1:43:13] a note is key note is a key note
[1:43:19] comes from the playing of a note before
[1:43:21] singing.
[1:43:23] Hello brother Ryan. You hit a note
[1:43:27] before singing and the note played
[1:43:31] determines
[1:43:33] the key in which the song will be
[1:43:36] performed. Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; A keynote in public speaking is a talk
[1:43:44] that establishes a main underlying
[1:43:47] theme.
[1:43:49] At political or industrial conventions
[1:43:52] or at academic conferences, the keynote
[1:43:57] address
[1:43:58] or keynote speech is delivered to set
[1:44:02] the underlying tone and summarize the
[1:44:06] core message
[1:44:08] or most important revelation of the
[1:44:11] event.
[1:44:12] And so now, brother Brandham in 19 I
[1:44:15] think 57, he's answering a question or
[1:44:18] 1964, he's answering a question on
[1:44:21] baptism.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:44:26] But as you go down, you know where he
[1:44:28] goes? He goes into the scripture and
[1:44:31] says, "Who do men say that I am?" Right.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[1:44:37] he says
[1:44:39] Abel had a revelation that it was blood.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Nobody told him that,
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; but he believed that
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; and nobody told him. He said Cain did
[1:44:54] not tell him
[1:44:57] about himself. He didn't he didn't tell
[1:45:00] Cain. Cain did not tell Abel. He didn't
[1:45:03] get it from Cain. He got it from God. He
[1:45:08] knew it was blood. It had to be blood.
[1:45:11] Listen to me, friends. You say, "Oh,
[1:45:13] well, I believe that." You You don't
[1:45:16] even have your thing yourself to thank
[1:45:18] for that. You have one to thank and that
[1:45:21] is that God your father would send his
[1:45:25] Holy Spirit to you at some place at some
[1:45:29] time through your parents or through a
[1:45:32] pastor or through a minister to say one
[1:45:35] word to you and you anchored it and the
[1:45:38] Holy Ghost anchored it in your heart and
[1:45:42] would not have let it go and it could
[1:45:45] not it it it
[1:45:47] you just could not be shaken from it.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; That to me and the prophet says that's
[1:45:54] revelation. That was his keynote. He
[1:45:56] says, "Let me give you a keynote." And
[1:45:59] his keynote is whether it was baptism,
[1:46:02] it's a revelation. Whether it's the
[1:46:04] godhead, it's a revelation. And I can
[1:46:07] tell you one thing for certain before I
[1:46:10] finish here. To understand
[1:46:14] the son of man is simply to say I
[1:46:18] believe that
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; I can't explain why I believe it
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; and I cannot detail it and I can't
[1:46:26] satisfy someone else's inquiring mind
[1:46:29] but I believe that
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; somebody asked him he says I got a wife
[1:46:37] or I got a husband or whatever it was
[1:46:39] that was a marital thing says they don't
[1:46:41] believe it. And I how can I how can I He
[1:46:46] wanted to know how he could cast the
[1:46:48] devils out and how he could get her to
[1:46:50] believe it or get him to believe it. And
[1:46:53] he said it was a woman. It was a woman
[1:46:56] and and he said to the man, "Buy her a
[1:46:59] box of chocolates." True. [laughter]
[1:47:04] [panting]
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; You may wonder why we're smiling because
[1:47:08] that's the kind of advice
[1:47:11] uh sometimes we need.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Because the keynote was
[1:47:17] it has to be a revelation.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And then he said to one individual he
[1:47:23] said just make them thirsty.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; You just live. And what if I die and
[1:47:30] they're still well? That's fine. Die and
[1:47:32] leave them thirsty,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; but leave them thirsting for the water
[1:47:36] of life
[1:47:38] until the woman at the well said, "Ever
[1:47:41] give me this water." That's who Brother
[1:47:44] Benham was talking about. He made her SO
[1:47:46] THIRSTY. SAID, "SIR, give me this
[1:47:49] water."
[1:47:52] Hallelujah.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; And you notice, please just notice and
[1:47:57] I'll close.
[1:48:00] He asked her that a very simple
[1:48:03] question. Out of this bosom of one that
[1:48:06] came from the father,
[1:48:09] out of the bosom of man of Galilee,
[1:48:14] his brethren are here. The people said
[1:48:17] his mother and father are here. Yeah,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; we know where he come. We know the cra
[1:48:22] cradle he was he was rocked in. We know
[1:48:25] the place where he was born. We have all
[1:48:29] of those things.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; No, that's that wouldn't make him out of
[1:48:34] the bosom of the father
[1:48:36] is one the man's side became weary
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; and he sat down at the well.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus of Nazareth was weary.
[1:48:48] Right?
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And he sat down. Here comes a woman
[1:48:52] who's in a disastrous state.
[1:48:55] You wouldn't want her for your neighbor.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; She's had five husbands,
[1:49:03] five
[1:49:05] failures, and now she's living with the
[1:49:08] sixth one.
[1:49:13] And the God of eternity, you're [snorts]
[1:49:16] very, very quiet. And I'm glad you are.
[1:49:19] Do you know this God?
[1:49:24] Do you know him?
[1:49:30] You have to know somebody you can't
[1:49:31] explain.
[1:49:37] He's not done with the woman. He just as
[1:49:39] says, "Give me a drink."
[1:49:45] And right away she responds at the same
[1:49:48] level, earthly, physical, body level.
[1:49:54] But you you are you are made of three
[1:49:57] body, spirit, and soul.
[1:50:02] And he's at at the body. He says, "Give
[1:50:04] me to drink." And she responds at the
[1:50:08] same level. She said, see, maybe the way
[1:50:12] he's dressed, she said, "You're a Jew.
[1:50:15] I'm a Samaritan.
[1:50:17] We don't have dealings one with another.
[1:50:22] He said, 'If you knew who I was,
[1:50:26] you would ask me
[1:50:28] and I'd give you a drink
[1:50:31] that you'd neither come here to
[1:50:34] draw water.
[1:50:37] She says, "Where will you get this water
[1:50:41] as well as deep?" and you don't you
[1:50:43] don't have any rope or you don't have
[1:50:45] anything with you to draw water. Where
[1:50:48] will you get this water?
[1:50:50] He said it'll be in you
[1:50:53] a well of living water.
[1:50:57] Said, "Sir,
[1:50:59] just stay with me a moment." Sir, give
[1:51:02] me this water.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know your situation. And I don't
[1:51:08] know exactly
[1:51:10] your experience, but
[1:51:13] every believer needs this water.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; You need to know that you have that well
[1:51:19] of water within you.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "You won't come here to bring
[1:51:25] water or get water or drink."
[1:51:28] And then she turns and he says, "Go and
[1:51:31] get your husband."
[1:51:34] Now, that was a messianic sign.
[1:51:38] And he displayed that and she knew
[1:51:45] this was more than just a Jew looking to
[1:51:48] me.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Said, "Sir,
[1:51:52] I perceive you're a prophet."
[1:51:55] That moves me, but that's still not far
[1:51:58] enough.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; It moved her and she became religious.
[1:52:05] And that's where everyone gets
[1:52:06] religious. So, oh well, you know, I know
[1:52:09] that you you must
[1:52:14] you Jews say that we should worship in
[1:52:16] Jerusalem and we say you must worship in
[1:52:19] this mountain and she didn't know. She
[1:52:21] didn't have an absolute,
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; And maybe before you were baptized, you
[1:52:27] didn't have an absolute. And maybe you
[1:52:29] still don't know who was talking to you.
[1:52:33] and she still doesn't know who's talking
[1:52:35] to her,
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Said, "I I know when the Messiah comes,
[1:52:44] he'll tell us all things."
[1:52:47] And the same mouth that said, "Give me
[1:52:50] to drink now says something different."
[1:52:55] He says, "I that speak to thee am he."
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:00] She didn't have to try and figure out
[1:53:02] where he was born or who his mother was
[1:53:04] or who his father was.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; She She knew, right? And the prophet of
[1:53:09] God tells us what happened, the light
[1:53:12] struck the seed.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you as believers, at
[1:53:18] some point in your life, the light
[1:53:20] struck the seed.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; And you CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. IT'S JUST
[1:53:25] SOMETHING that happens.
[1:53:28] I see some of you young people here.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; I was about 18
[1:53:37] when the light struck the seed.
[1:53:41] And I don't know why.
[1:53:44] And my wife, you can ask her if you
[1:53:46] dare, if you wish to,
[1:53:49] but as a young person,
[1:53:52] there was no message.
[1:53:55] And I would read parts of this Bible
[1:54:00] and I would weep until tears from my
[1:54:02] eyes would fall on the pages
[1:54:07] and I would say
[1:54:09] I don't know why but I just love the
[1:54:11] word of God.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Young people,
[1:54:19] you can like you can know the person.
[1:54:24] You can know the author of this book.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; You can love him. He'll He'll talk to
[1:54:29] you. He loves young people.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; He loves young people.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; He loves families.
[1:54:39] You that are fathers, he talk to you.
[1:54:44] He has something to say. He has a He has
[1:54:46] a special interest in you. Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:54:53] it just breaks me out because I just
[1:54:55] desire so much that you come to know
[1:54:58] him.
[1:55:02] He's been such a friend
[1:55:05] to me.
[1:55:08] And if I never speak again, I want you
[1:55:11] to know he's the dearest friend you
[1:55:15] could ever have.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; And he wants you a lot more than you
[1:55:22] even need or want him.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And this woman said, "That's when the
[1:55:35] light struck the seed." The prophet of
[1:55:37] God said, "That's when the light struck
[1:55:38] the seed."
[1:55:40] And she just knew. She dropped her water
[1:55:44] bucket,
[1:55:45] ran into the city, and started to say,
[1:55:48] "COME AND SEE A MAN."
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; A man,
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; She wasn't worried about where he was
[1:56:01] born or where he lived or where he was
[1:56:04] educated.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. It goes
[1:56:07] beyond. And that's what I want to say to
[1:56:09] this congregation. understand what to
[1:56:11] say to the people in the balconies.
[1:56:15] We believe something that goes beyond
[1:56:17] this human intelligence.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; THIS HUMAN INTELLIGENCE WILL GET you
[1:56:23] absolutely nowhere.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; You could BE THE GREATEST SUCCESS IN THE
[1:56:28] WORLD AND go to hell,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; go to a sinner's grave. My God.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being kind of crude,
[1:56:40] but there's one place
[1:56:42] where everyone
[1:56:44] is on that same ground
[1:56:47] and that's on the slab in the funeral
[1:56:50] home,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:53] They're not interested how what kind of
[1:56:55] a success or what kind of knowledge you
[1:56:57] have or what your PhD or your doctor
[1:57:01] divinity or anything. Those things that
[1:57:03] all the scholars and the theologians,
[1:57:06] one thing for sure, you're all on the
[1:57:08] same level
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; on a cold slab in the funeral home.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And then someone gets up and tries to
[1:57:16] say a eulogy and they say all nice
[1:57:18] things. Isn't it amazing how everybody
[1:57:21] wants to go to heaven on that side, but
[1:57:24] they don't want to go on this side? They
[1:57:27] want to just satisfy the flesh and enjoy
[1:57:30] the world and and have all of the
[1:57:32] entertainment and all the all the games
[1:57:35] OR WHATEVER MORE. WHY DO YOU WANT things
[1:57:37] on this side that you don't want on the
[1:57:40] other side?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; I can tell you, friends.
[1:57:44] I can tell you.
[1:57:46] I tell you because you believe me.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; When you lay on a hospital bed and you
[1:57:54] don't know whether you're going to come
[1:57:55] out that same day,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; You don't know whether you're going to
[1:58:00] live. You don't know whether you're
[1:58:01] going to see your daughters or family
[1:58:04] again.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; I was so happy.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; So happy. Those of you that have been
[1:58:11] here
[1:58:13] and you've known a bit of what we've
[1:58:15] gone through,
[1:58:17] I don't talk about it. It's not worth
[1:58:19] it.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; But one thing I was able to look up
[1:58:25] and I just felt like this piece of wood,
[1:58:30] well, if I don't come out,
[1:58:33] all I can say
[1:58:36] is the record's already been written.
[1:58:40] It is what it is.
[1:58:45] And I don't feel any regret or sadness
[1:58:48] in my heart.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs]
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; And I don't feel any animosity. I don't
[1:58:54] I don't feel there's anything there
[1:58:57] isn't anything I could think of that I
[1:58:58] needed or wanted to make right. [sighs]
[1:59:02] And I say to you as my friends,
[1:59:06] [sighs] whether it's good or whether
[1:59:08] it's right, that's what you want to be
[1:59:10] able to say.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to rush in and try and make
[1:59:14] things right at the last minute.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to pray for a miracle the
[1:59:18] last minute.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Said if that's what it is, that's what
[1:59:22] it is.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you.
[1:59:42] I don't think I need to.
[1:59:48] I could take a couple of minutes and
[1:59:49] just have you read these slides with me.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Would you like to do that?
[1:59:57] And if you want any notes, we could
[1:59:59] print the slides out for you if you
[2:00:01] wanted to. You'd have to see Brother
[2:00:03] Aaron Hardy.
[2:00:12] I'll just be very brief and quick with
[2:00:14] this.
[2:00:20] Speaking of the woman at the well, he
[2:00:22] was trying to catch her spirit. And when
[2:00:24] he found where her trouble was, he said,
[2:00:27] "Go get your husband." She said, "I
[2:00:30] don't have any husband." He said,
[2:00:31] "That's right. You caught five."
[2:00:35] She said, "Sir, I perceive that you are
[2:00:37] a prophet. Now, we know that when the
[2:00:40] Messiah cometh, he will tell us these
[2:00:43] things." But she didn't know who he was.
[2:00:48] Now, what is the sign of the Messiah
[2:00:51] then? Those works. She said, "You must
[2:00:54] be a prophet because I know when Messiah
[2:00:57] cometh, he will do these things." But
[2:00:59] she couldn't understand who he was. He
[2:01:03] said, "I am he that speaks to thee."
[2:01:07] Now, if that was the sign of Messiah in
[2:01:09] that day, and he's risen from the dead,
[2:01:13] it's got to be the sign of Messiah
[2:01:16] today. Amen.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Is that clear?
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; It's the It's the messianic sign today.
[2:01:22] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel said, "Can any good thing come
[2:01:27] out of Nazareth?" He said, "You come and
[2:01:30] see." When he saw him coming, Jesus
[2:01:33] looked at him. He was going to perform
[2:01:36] his messianic sign on him.
[2:01:40] He said, "Behold, I am a Behold an
[2:01:43] Israelite in whom there's no guile." You
[2:01:45] know, friends,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; this
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching. I'm talking to the
[2:01:53] sheep, brother Kyle.
[2:01:57] This Messiah talked to you.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Same one that talked to Nathaniel
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; has talked to you.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; You've heard him.
[2:02:11] He saw some quality in you. Behold, an
[2:02:15] Israelite in whom is no guile.
[2:02:19] He said, "When you know me, when did you
[2:02:22] know me, Rabbi?" That astonished him. He
[2:02:26] looked up and said, "Rabbi, you're the
[2:02:28] son of God."
[2:02:31] He told him
[2:02:33] who he was and who his father was. Now,
[2:02:37] Nathaniel, you know that the Messiah is
[2:02:40] to be a God-scent prophet.
[2:02:44] God is to be in
[2:02:47] in the Messiah because he's to be a king
[2:02:50] of the prophets, but he's to give us the
[2:02:53] messianic sign according to the
[2:02:55] scriptures. And if this man would do
[2:02:58] this, wouldn't you believe he was a
[2:03:00] prophet?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Now, the Jews to receive a Messiah, he
[2:03:05] had to have a messianic sign because of
[2:03:08] Deuteronomy
[2:03:09] 18:15. Just listen to this. proves what
[2:03:13] the Messiah would be. And if what he
[2:03:17] showed them was the sign he was a
[2:03:19] Messiah, that will remain through all
[2:03:22] generations there is to come as long as
[2:03:26] there's a person to receive it. That is
[2:03:29] why prophet of God in 1956 would say
[2:03:33] Jesus Christ starting the first time he
[2:03:35] used it. Jesus Christ the same
[2:03:38] yesterday, today, and forever. And then
[2:03:41] preached
[2:03:42] that he's identified in all ages.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Paul was the first messenger. And what
[2:03:50] did he do? Declared war on the Orthodox
[2:03:53] Church for not believing the messianic
[2:03:57] sign that Jesus had produced to them.
[2:04:00] Remember Paul came come to the end of
[2:04:04] the age came at the end of the age and
[2:04:08] all messengers come at the end of the
[2:04:10] age. It's at the end time when these
[2:04:13] things are brought forth.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Now here we are just past it. So where
[2:04:18] are we?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; If he was standing here and you were
[2:04:25] sick, you would say, "Jesus healed me."
[2:04:27] Yes,
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; he would say, "I've already done it when
[2:04:30] I died at Calvary." But now he could he
[2:04:33] could prove that he was Jesus by showing
[2:04:36] you the messianic sign
[2:04:39] that he was Jesus. And he promised to do
[2:04:44] it. There is just no loophole for the
[2:04:48] devil to get away,
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; isn't it?
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; He is, as he is concerned. Isn't he
[2:04:55] wonderful?
[2:04:56] And I I I I want to end on that. There's
[2:05:00] just there's no loophole for the devil.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; I think that's a good place for us to
[2:05:06] stop.
[2:05:07] God bless you. Would you like to stand?
[2:05:15] And brother Derek, if you would come up
[2:05:18] please and just
[2:05:21] sing a song and close the people
[2:05:27] just just bow with me in prayer. Would
[2:05:28] you please?
[2:05:32] Lovely Lord Jesus,
[2:05:36] how we love you.
[2:05:40] a lovely one.
[2:05:42] We ask you Lord Jesus to come amongst
[2:05:46] us.
[2:05:49] While we cannot go to you, [snorts]
[2:05:52] would you please come?
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Would you please speak, oh Lord?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; And I believe you have already spoken.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; I see the attentive look of the people
[2:06:03] on the faces of the people.
[2:06:06] And I believe that you have talked with
[2:06:08] them.
[2:06:10] There are things that you have spoken
[2:06:14] to me personally and you've spoken to
[2:06:16] each person personally
[2:06:19] and they can never ever shake that out
[2:06:22] of their hearts. [snorts] It's been
[2:06:24] anchored there by a divine act of
[2:06:27] revelation. It's something you do. It's
[2:06:30] beyond human understanding. We can't
[2:06:33] even explain why are we here and what
[2:06:36] have you got us here to do. But we just
[2:06:38] keep moving forward, Lord, because we
[2:06:41] believe that one day we'll take a step
[2:06:43] and it'll all be a new world. It'll be a
[2:06:46] whole new dimension. It'll be a whole
[2:06:48] new time and we'll have gone through a
[2:06:51] body change and not even being able to
[2:06:53] explain it or reveal it to others. Oh
[2:06:57] God, how I thank you for this body of
[2:06:59] people. I thank you that we have this
[2:07:01] church we can gather in. I thank you for
[2:07:04] the message and the messenger that
[2:07:05] you've sent. And I pray, Father, that we
[2:07:08] will each one have this experience in
[2:07:11] Jesus name. Bless the people I pray.
[2:07:14] Amen. Amen. I'd like to sing that
[2:07:16] chorus, Brother Derek. He came to me.
[2:07:18] Could we please?
[2:07:21] [music]
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; He came to me.
[2:07:30] [music] He came [singing] to me.
[2:07:37] When I could not come
[2:07:39] [music and singing]
[2:07:41] to where he was,
[2:07:44] he came to me.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's why he died
[2:07:56] on
[2:08:00] [music]
[2:08:02] when I [singing] could not come
[2:08:06] to where he was. He came to me.
[2:08:11] [music and singing]
[2:08:14] He came [music]
[2:08:16] to me.
[2:08:20] He [singing] came
[2:08:22] to me. Oh, thank you [music] to me.
[2:08:27] When I could [singing]
[2:08:28] not come
[2:08:31] to [music] where he was, he came to me.
[2:08:39] [music]
[2:08:40] That's why he died
[2:08:45] on Calary
[2:08:49] [music]
[2:08:52] when I [singing] could come
[2:08:56] to where he was. [music]
[2:08:58] He came to me. [singing]
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Before we sing one last time, let me say
[2:09:05] to this congregation,
[2:09:07] thank you Jesus. [music]
[2:09:10] for coming to me.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Would you like to say that? Would you
[2:09:15] like to join?
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, for coming to me.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; When I couldn't come to you, you came to
[2:09:23] me.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; You found me in my degradation and you
[2:09:28] found me in my unbelief and you found me
[2:09:31] in my bondage. You found me in my sin.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; But you came to me.
[2:09:38] He came to me. [music and singing]
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, he came
[2:09:46] to me [music]
[2:09:50] when I could not come [singing]
[2:09:54] to [music] anyone.
[2:09:57] He came
[2:09:59] to me.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; That's why [singing]
[2:10:05] he died
[2:10:09] [music]
[2:10:09] on Calary. [singing]
[2:10:14] [music]
[2:10:16] When I [singing] could not come
[2:10:20] to where [music] he was, he came to me.
[2:10:25] [singing]
[2:10:28] For he came to [music] me.
[2:10:34] He [singing] came
[2:10:37] to me [music]
