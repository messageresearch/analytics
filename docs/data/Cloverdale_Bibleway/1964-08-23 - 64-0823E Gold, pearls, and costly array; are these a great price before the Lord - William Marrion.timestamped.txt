[0:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[0:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[0:03] sound the mystery of God should be
[0:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[0:08] servants the
[0:10] prophets
[0:11] now uh brother Brandon questions should
[0:16] a Christian woman
[0:19] wear simple jewelry as necklaces or
[0:24] pearls
[0:26] well a sister I know this means a lot to
[0:29] you and it means a lot for me for you to
[0:31] place your confidence I tell you the
[0:34] truth now remember the Bible said when
[0:38] you
[0:39] Adorn do not adorn with with costly
[0:42] jewels and pearls and all kinds of
[0:45] wearing of jewelry but let that be the
[0:48] adorning of a peace and quiet Meek
[0:50] Spirit which I just quoted which is a
[0:51] great price before the Lord now I don't
[0:54] mean by that sister that if you had a
[0:57] pen this is me not the Lord if you had a
[1:00] pen that you wanted to wear or a little
[1:02] necklace your husband give you or maybe
[1:05] your something like that that you wore
[1:07] now to me I don't think that's bad now
[1:10] that's just me I remember I make myself
[1:13] clear that's my opinion but I think it's
[1:16] the approach to it it's the way you do
[1:19] it see it's the motive behind it and
[1:23] when you see it's getting a hold of you
[1:24] then leave the thing
[1:26] alone but I think if you wore your
[1:28] wedding ring I know you Nazarene people
[1:31] it used to be that you wouldn't even
[1:32] baptize a woman with a wedding ring on
[1:34] see I don't believe that it's necessary
[1:37] in the Bible they wore wedding rings on
[1:39] it was a tablet they called it around
[1:40] their head nine pieces of coin in it but
[1:43] I to show they were married now I think
[1:46] that's all right if women want to dress
[1:49] and and make themselves uh look decent
[1:52] clean ladylike well I think there's not
[1:54] a thing to that to me but when you get
[1:57] to go to put that thing into making a
[1:59] little Pride then you're wrong it's your
[2:03] attitude do you women remember here not
[2:06] long ago they had what they call Scandal
[2:07] skirts I think they're coming out again
[2:09] or they got wor be they're scandalist
[2:11] now instead of Scandal but they used to
[2:13] have a play back not long ago they had
[2:16] the girls young women and of course the
[2:19] old ones do it too cuz they're all want
[2:20] to be young I don't mean you sisters I
[2:22] mean the women of the world and they'
[2:24] cut their their skirt up high about a
[2:27] foot high every time then wear some kind
[2:29] of underne garment looked pretty and
[2:31] when they would make a step it would
[2:33] show this underneath garment with lace
[2:35] and Frills or whatever it was on it
[2:37] which you know um there's a a girl come
[2:41] to me which is a dunker girl had just
[2:43] received the Holy Ghost she belonged to
[2:45] Assemblies of God and that was in Fort
[2:46] Wayne Indiana where I was married at and
[2:49] she come to me a fine little lady and
[2:51] she said brother brandom I want to ask
[2:54] you a question I said all right sister
[2:56] what is it she said do you think it's
[2:58] wrong for a girl to Christian girl to
[2:59] wear a scandal skirt I said sister this
[3:03] is one thing I I just can't understand
[3:05] what is a scandal skirt and she told me
[3:07] what it was I he said it shows the
[3:10] underskirt I said what what is in a
[3:15] woman that would make her want to show
[3:17] her underneath clothes to some
[3:20] man what would what what business has a
[3:23] Christian girl got doing a thing like
[3:27] that could you imagine
[3:30] a Christian now look a man there's not
[3:34] much to him when it comes to a
[3:37] body and he if he went half naked it
[3:42] would there would be no Scandal to it
[3:44] not holding for man but the you know
[3:46] that what kind of a woman would be
[3:48] tempted by a man with his shirt off and
[3:50] shorts on or whatever he had the big old
[3:53] Burly looking thing it looks sloppy and
[3:56] sickly ey horrible see these men out
[3:59] here at I think it' make a woman Bonnet
[4:02] to look at such a thing and she had but
[4:05] now you take a woman in putter like that
[4:08] that's a different Temple you understand
[4:13] all right but I think as far as a
[4:14] necklace or now if you go to load
[4:17] yourself up like you went through the
[4:18] 10- cent store down here with a magnet
[4:20] on you I I think excuse that I didn't
[4:23] mean to say that like that but that
[4:25] that's wrong
