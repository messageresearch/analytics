[43:35] what we came here for right
[43:43] didn't turn to john
[43:44] he said that's great mother mike but
[43:46] which book
[43:48] john 17.
[44:04] i want to start at verse 15. this is
[44:06] jesus prayer
[44:08] if we go back into verse
[44:11] earlier in the verses
[44:13] jesus is saying i pray for them
[44:15] that's for you amen
[44:18] he says for i've given unto them the
[44:20] words which thou gavest me they have
[44:22] received them and i have known surely
[44:24] that i come out from thee and jesus
[44:26] is praying in the garden
[44:28] but i want to start at verse 15.
[44:31] he says i pray not that thou should just
[44:33] take them out of the world but the thou
[44:35] should just keep them from evil
[44:37] amen
[44:38] my
[44:39] that should that should do it right
[44:41] there
[44:42] he prayed for you lord keep them from
[44:44] evil you know you could have many people
[44:46] pray you could have a lot of ministers
[44:47] pray a lot but he prayed for you amen
[44:49] that's that's mighty comforting to me
[44:51] lord you prayed for me that i'd be kept
[44:53] from evil they are not of the world even
[44:55] as i am not of the world
[44:57] sanctify them
[44:59] through thy truth
[45:01] thy word
[45:02] is truth amen thy word is truth just
[45:06] hold on to that as thou has sent me into
[45:08] the world even so have i also sent them
[45:12] into the world amen sanctify them verse
[45:14] 17 through thy truth thy word
[45:17] is truth amen you may have your seats
[45:19] this morning
[45:21] i'm going to read just a couple more
[45:23] scriptures
[45:28] i just want to speak on a little subject
[45:30] this morning psalms 100 and verse 5 says
[45:33] for the lord is good and his mercies is
[45:36] everlasting and his truth endureth to
[45:38] all generations
[45:40] for the only sister hope in my it's good
[45:42] to see you god bless you this morning
[45:45] 117 verse 2 says for is merciful
[45:48] kindness is great toward us and the
[45:50] truth of the lord endureth
[45:53] forever amen
[45:55] 145 18 the lord is nigh and to all them
[45:57] that call upon him to all
[45:59] that call upon him
[46:02] in truth
[46:04] in truth so there's a bit of a caveat
[46:06] there
[46:07] the lord is nigh unto them that call
[46:09] upon him to all that call upon him in
[46:12] truth that's pretty vital
[46:14] psalms 119 30 says i have chosen
[46:18] the way
[46:19] of truth
[46:21] thy judgments
[46:22] have i laid before me
[46:25] take a little title maybe this morning
[46:28] it's hard to get a title but i'm gonna
[46:29] speak on the battle for truth
[46:33] and uh
[46:34] because it's something that is
[46:35] definitely on an onslaught in our time
[46:37] and day
[46:38] truth anybody weary this morning
[46:42] you are well the chuckle tells me such
[46:44] [Laughter]
[46:46] you're tired
[46:48] you're a little worn out
[46:51] no
[46:52] you're like ready to go
[46:54] okay
[46:56] all right
[46:58] you made it through another week yeah
[47:01] i did it
[47:03] all right
[47:04] well you're in a battle i hate to break
[47:06] it to you that's why you're tired this
[47:08] morning you've been waging it haven't
[47:09] you
[47:10] yeah in a battle you need about 5 000
[47:12] calories a day of intake
[47:14] to handle the battle every day that's
[47:16] what a soldier they say you know that's
[47:17] nowadays i don't know how they figured
[47:19] that out of what they required many many
[47:20] moons ago but apparently it's about that
[47:23] plus minus some calories that's probably
[47:25] about two to three times more than you
[47:26] should actually be taking so don't
[47:29] maybe not do that naturally
[47:30] [Laughter]
[47:32] quite unless you plan to wield something
[47:35] much heavier than your pen or the
[47:37] keyboard
[47:40] right
[47:41] but indeed on the front line someone
[47:44] that was fighting i can't even imagine
[47:45] the amount of output they required when
[47:48] they were wielding sword and shield and
[47:50] javelins and such my goodness pick up
[47:52] one of them swords ever and pretty much
[47:54] drop my shoulder on the floor they're
[47:56] heavy all right so they needed some
[47:58] serious input some serious intake right
[48:00] to keep them going and you've expended
[48:02] this week spiritually fighting
[48:04] and then that's why and so i wasn't
[48:05] asking you a trick question you're like
[48:07] yeah but i'm like no i'm wide awake and
[48:08] chipper on sunday morning
[48:10] it wasn't being a trick i was i was
[48:12] expecting someone to be like i'm worn
[48:13] out flat out well yes i understand amen
[48:17] so depending on the intensity but
[48:18] there's some
[48:19] i just looked as we were just looking to
[48:21] start the service and just
[48:24] lay a bit of a
[48:25] tiniest foundation but there's some
[48:27] pretty intense battles over the years
[48:28] you know and some serious casualties
[48:30] that have gone along with them it's
[48:32] incredible i didn't i just all got
[48:34] overwhelmed with even trying to add some
[48:35] numbers on how many people have have
[48:37] gone through wars and combat and and and
[48:40] have output and
[48:41] back in
[48:42] the
[48:44] 13th century or so there was a sacking
[48:46] of baghdad they say there's about two
[48:47] million casualties in that war and then
[48:50] in world war two and one there's
[48:52] different wars the
[48:54] bruzolov in 1916 a general one of the
[48:57] costliest battles 1.6 million there's
[48:59] another battle in world war ii with the
[49:01] battle of
[49:02] niper's d-n-i-e i wasn't saying that
[49:04] right but there was about a 1.5 million
[49:07] and stalingrad and psalm and ichigo and
[49:10] barbarossa oh my goodness just over and
[49:12] over battle upon battle upon battle
[49:17] terrible casualties
[49:19] but i was pondering my goodness how the
[49:21] how the world has waged but nothing
[49:24] nothing
[49:25] nothing compares to the battle
[49:28] for truth and the casualties that have
[49:32] been
[49:33] incurred in this battle my as satan
[49:35] fought
[49:36] so it's normal to be fatigued in the
[49:38] battle you're in
[49:39] quite normal as you're worn out and so
[49:42] then i ask
[49:43] how many spiritual calories did you
[49:45] consume this week
[49:48] that's no trick question either
[49:50] right because if we are waging
[49:52] you've got to input amen you've got to
[49:54] swing god input so i sure hope and
[49:56] praise the lord maybe just if that's all
[49:58] you get i maybe i need to
[50:01] increase my spiritual calorie intake and
[50:04] man we track it well i had this and this
[50:06] this day and how many calories exactly
[50:08] is that oh that's only 40 calories well
[50:10] i can have a lot of those amen you know
[50:13] we don't need a calorie count
[50:14] spiritually it's quite all right to
[50:16] overindulge
[50:18] amen so let's let's do that lord may we
[50:21] over indulge spiritually in your word
[50:24] amen
[50:25] man brother brahms is now it's always
[50:27] been war never joined the church or come
[50:29] into the church to come to a picnic i
[50:32] believe i've read this quote before we
[50:33] must realize we are coming to a
[50:34] battleground i never come for people to
[50:36] pat me on the back so if you came to
[50:38] church
[50:39] for someone to pat you on the back you
[50:40] came for the wrong reason brother
[50:41] branham you're a wonderful person no sir
[50:43] he says i come here with a shield on i
[50:46] need don't need a shield for that as in
[50:48] the padding on the back i come with a
[50:49] helmet and the armor and i came into
[50:52] church this morning i walked down the
[50:53] hallway and what did i see sitting on
[50:56] the table there who was in that sunday
[50:58] school class
[51:00] brother victor who's in your class
[51:04] say the louder for me
[51:07] nines and tens who's in the who's the
[51:08] nines and tens who's in who's about a
[51:10] victor's class what was sitting on the
[51:11] table
[51:13] someone can yell it out to me
[51:15] armor
[51:16] indeed so you might take a little bit
[51:18] from this morning seriously my brother
[51:19] victor was in the channel well amen
[51:22] that's what we believe the lord does
[51:24] amen but abram says so i come with a
[51:27] helmet and the armor i come to fight
[51:30] fight every inch of the ground he says
[51:33] what is it i don't care how much you
[51:34] fight in the material things you're
[51:36] going he goes it won't mean one little
[51:39] thing one thing he says it'll shake but
[51:42] there's one fight that you can get into
[51:44] and gain ground that you've never been
[51:45] taken that can never be taken away from
[51:48] you that's the gospel sound of the
[51:50] trumpet of god's word amen that's the
[51:54] fight we're in this morning the gospel
[51:56] the trumpet sound over trumpet sound
[51:57] brother branham speaks about the
[51:59] trumpets and the scriptures and he said
[52:00] the trumpet sounded it was a it meant
[52:03] war
[52:05] it meant war
[52:06] and he says you notice through the ages
[52:08] there was a trumpet sounded a seal loose
[52:10] he goes that trumpet means war if it
[52:13] don't give a scriptural sound what about
[52:15] it amen so he said when that first
[52:17] trumpet sounded the first seal tore
[52:18] loose paul was the first messenger and
[52:20] we found what did he do
[52:23] he declared war
[52:24] my i thought that was my i i just
[52:27] pondered that for a little bit here paul
[52:29] he made a declaration of war what did he
[52:32] do he says now a declaration war is
[52:34] actually a formal act to declare war you
[52:36] know you can't do this it's just not
[52:38] willy-nilly you know some terrorists
[52:40] they like to think they're doing that
[52:41] but that's just
[52:42] you know that's not a full declaration
[52:44] of war it's a formal act by which a
[52:46] state or country whichever goes to war
[52:48] against another the declaration it's a
[52:50] performative speech act or the signing
[52:54] of a document
[52:56] i think paul performed a performative
[52:59] speech act as he tore through
[53:02] the different cities as he went through
[53:04] the different places and he started to
[53:05] declare war on the enemy
[53:08] amen a war for truth and then he went to
[53:11] mars hill and spoke to the different
[53:13] ones there of the unknown god and he
[53:15] started to declare the gospel of jesus
[53:17] christ that jesus christ has come the
[53:20] messiah and he's raised from the dead
[53:22] and that's what he started to declare
[53:24] that was the beginning of war
[53:26] amen he started to that was the trumpet
[53:28] sounded
[53:29] he went into corinth and he started he
[53:32] still tried he pressed he said he
[53:33] testified to the jews of jesus jesus was
[53:36] christ and they opposed themselves and
[53:38] blasphemed and he shook his raiment says
[53:40] your blood be upon your own heads i am
[53:42] clean and he henceforth he said i will
[53:43] go to the gentiles and so he strove and
[53:46] he strove because it's battle and the
[53:48] lord said to him be not afraid but speak
[53:50] and hold not thy peace
[53:53] amen that still applies
[53:55] oh not thy peace so paul knowing the
[53:56] scriptures knowing that jesus was the
[53:58] messiah he started blasting but iran
[54:00] says the synagogues
[54:02] from place to place scriptures and put
[54:04] out every one of them till he finally
[54:05] shook the dust and turned to the
[54:06] gentiles he goes what was it it was the
[54:08] sounding of a trumpet as an angel
[54:10] messenger standing there with the word
[54:14] what did we just read in the beginning
[54:15] thy word
[54:17] is truth there he was standing and
[54:19] blasting the truth amen and then brother
[54:22] branham goes goes and then irenaeus went
[54:24] down and saint martin and different and
[54:26] luther and all of them started blasting
[54:28] the ages he said saint martin blasted
[54:30] his age the fifth messenger luther
[54:32] blasted the catholic church john wesley
[54:34] raised up blasted the anglican church
[54:37] and there was a continual blasting and a
[54:39] trumpet sounding battles on the war was
[54:42] declared back there and we're still
[54:44] fighting it today truth will march on
[54:47] amen and that's what we must do today is
[54:49] continue to fight the battle for truth
[54:56] he said he blasted
[54:58] and he goes now he goes we're looking
[55:00] for a prophet
[55:01] to come to blast this age and turn them
[55:04] back from their iniquity
[55:06] but i'm saying this is is this the sign
[55:08] of the end sir and he goes notice the
[55:11] seven angel was to blast the laodicean
[55:13] rich church i am rich increased with
[55:16] goods i need nothing you're miserable
[55:17] you're wretched you're poor blind and
[55:19] naked as you know the scripture oh god
[55:21] he says
[55:22] send us a fearless prophet
[55:25] my with thus saith the lord that the
[55:27] vindicated word of god will move through
[55:29] it and prove that he's sent from god why
[55:32] how did people sit there in that day and
[55:34] age and not recognize the word of the
[55:37] hour here he's speaking oh god send us a
[55:39] fearless prophet
[55:42] here he was speaking notice now he says
[55:45] the seventh angel will finish all the
[55:47] mysteries that's been lost in the
[55:49] battles before
[55:52] for the truth
[55:54] and so here's something was lost
[55:56] luther raised up he didn't have all the
[55:58] truth he said
[56:00] wesley raised up he didn't have it now
[56:02] watch there's a lot of truth lost out
[56:05] there
[56:06] he says why where others compromised on
[56:09] truth
[56:11] but the seventh angel don't compromise
[56:14] amen compromise to accept standards that
[56:17] are lower
[56:18] lower than is desirable then the seventh
[56:21] angel he says will not compromise he
[56:24] won't on nothing he gathers up the loose
[56:26] ends gathers them up at the sounding of
[56:29] the mystery of god should be finished
[56:31] god sent him all the hidden mysteries
[56:34] was finished when it was revealed to him
[56:36] amen so where are we at today
[56:40] where are we at this moment
[56:42] at this moment at the hidden minute if
[56:43] these are hidden ministries the man
[56:45] brother bram says would be a prophet and
[56:47] in the battle for truth
[56:49] them ends have been lost but god said
[56:52] they'd be restored in this last day
[56:55] amen what a time we living in amen they
[56:58] were they didn't have it all in luther's
[57:00] day they didn't have it all in wesley's
[57:02] day but god sent a prophet
[57:04] uncompromising prophet to speak and
[57:06] bring all those loose ends in that
[57:08] battle for truth and say here it all is
[57:11] all every aspect is back and revealed to
[57:14] the people of this day
[57:15] i will restore saith the lord amen
[57:18] my
[57:20] and in an age of the full unveiling of
[57:22] all truth
[57:25] the full word of god
[57:28] thy word is truth
[57:31] look at the world we live in
[57:33] totally
[57:35] void
[57:36] of truth
[57:40] what is truth
[57:42] oh yeah that rings a bell pilate said
[57:44] that right brother ken
[57:46] you're somewhere here it goes way back
[57:48] long time ago what is truth remember
[57:50] that from a skit
[57:51] truth
[57:53] my goodness more misrepresentations
[57:55] these days more fake news these days or
[57:57] is it fake
[57:58] is it really just them trying to take
[58:00] the true off i mean my goodness you can
[58:02] get real
[58:03] real uh pulled into all these things
[58:04] well facebook pulled that down or
[58:06] twitter pulled you off because no you're
[58:08] not you're not speaking the truth well
[58:09] are you speaking the truth or did they
[58:11] not want the truth out where are we
[58:12] right now they're scrambled
[58:16] well i follow cnn
[58:18] you know i've no no cnn's doesn't god
[58:20] it's the fox fox news got it okay who's
[58:23] got truth
[58:27] well i i curate my own sets of truth and
[58:30] i have my own twitter following that i
[58:32] follow
[58:33] that's my truth okay
[58:37] or my government or my teacher or my
[58:39] prof my friend
[58:41] who
[58:42] has it
[58:43] who has truth these days
[58:45] people are looking for it
[58:47] they're looking for it
[58:50] truth in the old testament when you look
[58:52] at the word
[58:54] comes
[58:55] very frequently as the scripture in
[58:56] deuteronomy says deuteronomy 32 he says
[58:58] he is the rock
[59:00] his work is perfect
[59:01] for his ways art for all his ways our
[59:04] judgment a god of truth
[59:06] and without iniquity just and right
[59:10] is he amen it was firm it was stable
[59:13] truth in the old testament was sureness
[59:14] reliability and security it was a
[59:17] continuance of faithfulness a
[59:18] reliableness it was the god of truth
[59:21] something you could be firm and stand on
[59:23] and know that he's just and he's secure
[59:26] and he's faithful that's our god
[59:29] and i can tell you
[59:31] in this world
[59:32] if truth is firm and stable
[59:34] the status of the world clearly shows it
[59:36] lacks it because there's nothing of the
[59:37] sort as far as stability and that's what
[59:40] they're looking for
[59:42] searching for truth oh my
[59:45] john 18 says pilate as i referenced you
[59:47] know pilates had christ standing before
[59:50] him
[59:52] jesus said to him thou sayest that i am
[59:55] a king to this end was i born and for
[59:57] this cause can i into the world that i
[59:58] should bear witness unto the truth
[1:00:00] everyone that is the truth heareth my
[1:00:02] voice
[1:00:03] and pilate said on him what is truth
[1:00:06] and when he said this now we can
[1:00:08] remember
[1:00:09] him asking the question you can conjure
[1:00:11] in your mind how you think he asked the
[1:00:13] question was he like what is truth
[1:00:16] what is truth what is truth
[1:00:18] how did he say it
[1:00:20] we we try and imagine what he said
[1:00:24] but you know what the next part of the
[1:00:26] verse is
[1:00:29] when he said this he went out again
[1:00:33] so he actually wasn't really staying
[1:00:35] planning to get a response actually
[1:00:39] he said he said what is truth and then
[1:00:41] i'm out i'm going back out again it was
[1:00:43] he wasn't asking in a way that he was
[1:00:44] looking for a response if he just went
[1:00:46] out again after that what is truth
[1:00:48] almost you could say maybe he was
[1:00:50] cynical i don't know what he was going
[1:00:52] through and he obviously was was longing
[1:00:54] for truth but not enough that in front
[1:00:55] of him was truth and he wasn't even
[1:00:58] gonna hear a response he was just gonna
[1:01:00] turn around and headed out the door
[1:01:02] and i pray tonight anybody that's saying
[1:01:04] you know i'm searching for truth too
[1:01:05] don't turn around and walk out the door
[1:01:08] when truth a living god thy word is
[1:01:10] truth the word of god jesus christ
[1:01:12] unveiled before us is truth and he's
[1:01:15] here to present himself again don't be a
[1:01:18] pilot and just turn around and head on
[1:01:19] out
[1:01:24] my some
[1:01:26] truth to them is is controlled it's for
[1:01:28] elite
[1:01:29] some of them is subjective
[1:01:32] it's a world of preference and opinion
[1:01:35] you know even way back some of you might
[1:01:37] even remember and i was
[1:01:38] poking into the words what is truth
[1:01:41] an old song from some old singer that
[1:01:44] many of you would maybe even know who i
[1:01:45] will not name
[1:01:47] but he said yeah
[1:01:49] he spoke wrote a verse the young man
[1:01:50] speaking in the square he's trying to
[1:01:52] tell somebody he cares
[1:01:54] yeah the ones that are calling wild are
[1:01:56] going to be leaders in a little while
[1:01:57] this old world is awakened to a newborn
[1:01:59] day and i promise that it'll be their
[1:02:01] way you better help the voice of youth
[1:02:04] find
[1:02:05] what is truth
[1:02:07] they were searching
[1:02:09] this was in the 70s
[1:02:10] what is truth the youth then were
[1:02:12] searching for truth and it's still the
[1:02:14] cry today
[1:02:16] cry today has not diminished but i can
[1:02:18] tell you the din and the sound of war
[1:02:20] against truth has increased
[1:02:23] that hasn't waned
[1:02:24] that hasn't waned he's tried to obstruct
[1:02:26] satan to obstruct and hinder whatever he
[1:02:29] can to attempt the defeat of truth
[1:02:32] amen but i'm going to just tell you a
[1:02:34] little secret and
[1:02:36] truth
[1:02:37] i could just skip to the very end truth
[1:02:39] will march on
[1:02:41] hate to break you satan but truth will
[1:02:43] march on it doesn't matter history has
[1:02:45] actually already told you through the
[1:02:47] years and the ages as each messenger in
[1:02:49] each church has stood the test of time
[1:02:51] truth never backed down it never was
[1:02:54] defeated and it will continue to march
[1:02:56] on
[1:03:00] so now i'll just close up my notes and
[1:03:02] say amen well dismissed
[1:03:06] amen no
[1:03:08] i want to declare the day john 14 jesus
[1:03:11] said and if i go to prepare a place for
[1:03:13] you i will come again and receive unto
[1:03:14] myself that where i am there ye may be
[1:03:16] also and whether i go ye know the way
[1:03:19] and the way you know thomas said oh lord
[1:03:22] we know not wither thou goest jesus
[1:03:25] continued to say to him he says i am the
[1:03:27] way
[1:03:28] we know the verse
[1:03:30] truth
[1:03:32] i am the way
[1:03:33] the truth and the life
[1:03:36] no man cometh unto me under the father
[1:03:38] but by me amen he
[1:03:41] is truth i don't really care what the
[1:03:43] philosophical day
[1:03:44] day is and all the different aspects
[1:03:46] that they want to call truth but i'm
[1:03:48] just going to tell you this morning
[1:03:50] he is truth
[1:03:52] christ is truth
[1:03:53] he's the only thing that is firm and
[1:03:55] stable and enduring and eternal and you
[1:03:58] want to put your anchor into it's him
[1:04:03] sanctify them through thy word as we as
[1:04:05] we read earlier thy word
[1:04:07] the word of god is truth and abideth
[1:04:10] forever first peter 1 23 being born
[1:04:13] again not of corrupt corruptable seed
[1:04:15] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:04:18] which liveth and abideth forever amen
[1:04:21] the word of god truth it cannot be
[1:04:24] broken as another scripture states for
[1:04:26] it's christ christ and the word are the
[1:04:28] same and they are truth and they are
[1:04:30] life amen
[1:04:34] the truth of christ and the truth of the
[1:04:36] bible are the very same thing one in the
[1:04:39] same in the beginning was the word and
[1:04:41] the word is with god as we know in john
[1:04:42] 1 in the word became flesh amen
[1:04:46] truth became flesh
[1:04:50] define it how you want you can go into
[1:04:52] all the dictionaries and truth oh it's
[1:04:54] the real facts it's this it defines that
[1:04:56] it's in accordance with reality or
[1:04:58] reality is a true situation that really
[1:05:00] exists i don't know there's three
[1:05:01] different theories on really what truth
[1:05:02] is and there's the concordance theory
[1:05:04] and there's this area i'm telling you
[1:05:05] there's only one theory and not even say
[1:05:07] theory there's one fact
[1:05:10] jesus christ it's truth
[1:05:16] he's the only one
[1:05:20] now in ephesians i'm just going to take
[1:05:22] a little side step
[1:05:25] everything is meant to deceive you
[1:05:27] of truth or to stabilize your path
[1:05:30] that's what this
[1:05:31] the our enemy and you know scripture
[1:05:33] says
[1:05:34] stand therefore this is number one now
[1:05:36] in ephesians six which i'm sure our nine
[1:05:39] and tens probably heard this morning
[1:05:41] verse 14 or 13 says take the whole armor
[1:05:44] of god they may be able to withstand the
[1:05:46] evil day having to done all to stand
[1:05:48] stand and it says number one having your
[1:05:50] loins
[1:05:52] gert
[1:05:53] about
[1:05:54] with what
[1:05:55] with truth amen
[1:05:57] that's the very first thing paul
[1:05:59] actually says
[1:06:00] out of all the armor that you could done
[1:06:03] he actually tells you get on a belt of
[1:06:06] truth
[1:06:07] gird your loins with truth that's number
[1:06:09] one
[1:06:10] rightly so because it's christ
[1:06:13] gird your loins
[1:06:15] you say well what exactly does that mean
[1:06:17] well your loins happen to be the belt
[1:06:20] section of your body and if you want to
[1:06:22] actually look at back on a soldier when
[1:06:24] a soldier had to put on his armor he
[1:06:26] first put on his belt now don't think of
[1:06:29] my strapping little fancy leatherette
[1:06:32] belt here it was no fashion statement as
[1:06:35] an as a soldier well i might get my belt
[1:06:38] on is it black or blue does it match my
[1:06:40] pants no it didn't work that way
[1:06:42] there was no belt that was it'll send
[1:06:44] little strapling here is it braided or
[1:06:45] is it solid is that real genuine leather
[1:06:47] who really cared it was actually a piece
[1:06:49] of his armor that was pretty thick
[1:06:51] actually who's ever worked they put that
[1:06:53] big old lumbar kind of strapping support
[1:06:55] on anybody ever done that you know a
[1:06:56] lumbar belt the lumbar support why do
[1:06:59] you do that
[1:07:00] well it sounds like because i have a bad
[1:07:01] back no
[1:07:03] so you actually have support
[1:07:06] and that's what the belt was for a
[1:07:08] soldier it was actually the first part
[1:07:09] of support of the armor that everything
[1:07:11] actually worked and affixed to and and
[1:07:13] attached together and it kind of was
[1:07:15] that central part of the core of your
[1:07:18] armor
[1:07:19] without that your everything would start
[1:07:21] flapping around your your breastplate
[1:07:23] would just kind of not be there it it
[1:07:25] you know you know everything else
[1:07:26] attached to your sword where are you
[1:07:27] gonna put your sword
[1:07:28] anybody attached anything to a belt
[1:07:30] before without the belt you had nowhere
[1:07:31] to go it was an important part of your
[1:07:34] armor the belt of truth or gird your
[1:07:37] loins with truth is what the scripture
[1:07:39] says amen
[1:07:41] why because it was actually it's the
[1:07:43] core
[1:07:44] it's the central area
[1:07:47] if your core isn't christ
[1:07:51] who works out here
[1:07:53] okay
[1:07:55] you might all need to go and start
[1:07:56] working on your core
[1:07:58] without strong core
[1:08:00] you're weak you've got no support your
[1:08:02] back is going to hurt
[1:08:04] you're going to have you're not going to
[1:08:05] have a good aging process a good strong
[1:08:08] core allows you to walk strong and firm
[1:08:10] it's core it's core muscles you become
[1:08:12] flabby and
[1:08:14] there's nothing there you try and pick
[1:08:15] up a garbage can you're out because you
[1:08:16] don't have a good strong core you might
[1:08:18] need to do plank for a few minutes a day
[1:08:20] you want to strengthen the core and
[1:08:21] that's what that was it was the core
[1:08:23] aspect of your armor which is christ
[1:08:26] it's your core it's your source of
[1:08:28] strength if you don't have a strong core
[1:08:30] in the word of god you're going to be
[1:08:31] weak against the enemy that's why paul's
[1:08:34] saying girl up your loins with truth
[1:08:36] with the word of god with jesus christ
[1:08:38] because he's going to be your source
[1:08:40] that everything else connects to
[1:08:47] amen
[1:08:50] don't everybody go home and start core
[1:08:52] exercises
[1:08:55] i was thinking you know when actually
[1:08:56] the loins
[1:08:58] it's actually also it refers to the
[1:09:00] creative part of a human being
[1:09:04] and paul is adequately saying
[1:09:06] gird it up with faith with truth
[1:09:09] protect that creative aspect
[1:09:11] that god gave you
[1:09:13] not naturally spiritually speaking
[1:09:15] spiritually we as creators
[1:09:18] man god gave the ability to create but
[1:09:21] abram says atmosphere
[1:09:23] we go out and work we create things we
[1:09:26] create relationships we use our words
[1:09:28] and we are creating
[1:09:30] we're creating bonds we're creating an
[1:09:32] atmosphere around us we're creating he's
[1:09:34] saying gird up your loins with truth
[1:09:36] because you want to create an atmosphere
[1:09:38] with truth with christ as the center
[1:09:41] gird up your loins with truth you want
[1:09:43] to create a relationship with truth as
[1:09:45] the center focus what does the scripture
[1:09:47] say
[1:09:48] do not be unequally yoked
[1:09:51] that's truth that's the word of god gird
[1:09:54] up your relationships gird up what you
[1:09:57] are creating in life with truth may it
[1:09:59] be sheltered and surrounded by the word
[1:10:02] of god or you're going to deviate
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:06] and be weak and defeated
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:11] and so satan has fought against truth
[1:10:16] the very beginning of time
[1:10:18] and he's defined to find a tactic
[1:10:20] which we all know and we'll just we'll
[1:10:21] go through a little bit
[1:10:23] and rehearse
[1:10:25] because he's used the same tactic for
[1:10:26] thousands of years
[1:10:28] and so it isn't going to change much so
[1:10:30] we should probably be very
[1:10:32] very very adept at recognizing it
[1:10:35] right it's not like he's changing every
[1:10:36] day
[1:10:37] the core of it's the same
[1:10:39] deception
[1:10:42] now the serpent
[1:10:44] was subtle was more subtle than any
[1:10:46] beast of the field
[1:10:48] which the lord god had made and he said
[1:10:50] unto the woman yay
[1:10:52] hath god said
[1:10:54] ye shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:10:56] garden
[1:10:57] question
[1:11:00] i believe that's the first question
[1:11:02] actually even recorded in scripture
[1:11:05] the serpent
[1:11:07] that old devil
[1:11:09] says
[1:11:10] as god said
[1:11:13] you should should not eat
[1:11:15] and he presents the first dilemma
[1:11:18] here's his tactic
[1:11:20] he presents the first dilemma the first
[1:11:22] attack against truth
[1:11:25] here he is now saying hmm
[1:11:27] there's not been a question before
[1:11:29] just answers to everything but this
[1:11:31] phrase it created now it created doubt
[1:11:33] because now he's posed it
[1:11:35] all right
[1:11:37] and so now this genomic force has now
[1:11:39] entered into this world of human life
[1:11:41] and now god what god had said now he
[1:11:44] just look at he planted
[1:11:46] this this seed that wait a second
[1:11:51] god said this but you know
[1:11:55] had did he did he say that really was it
[1:11:57] that how he said it or
[1:12:00] maybe we should now just question god's
[1:12:02] judgment on this
[1:12:08] you know
[1:12:10] maybe there's something wrong
[1:12:11] maybe maybe
[1:12:15] did god really tell you that exactly
[1:12:17] that way have god said
[1:12:20] it's a question
[1:12:21] and he's now suddenly asking eve to make
[1:12:23] a judgment on what god said well
[1:12:27] uh yeah let me think about
[1:12:29] uh you know why would he do that why
[1:12:31] would he place this restriction on you
[1:12:35] god said you should eat it not eat of
[1:12:37] every tree why would he be so narrow
[1:12:41] why why would he limit you but doesn't
[1:12:44] god want you to be free
[1:12:47] why did god say have god said
[1:12:49] come on
[1:12:50] this is the tactic of the enemy put it
[1:12:52] into your world
[1:12:54] this is where it started
[1:12:56] isn't god for free will
[1:12:58] i mean
[1:12:59] isn't he pro-choice
[1:13:02] god's for freedom hath god said you
[1:13:05] should not eat of every tree why why
[1:13:10] my goodness i mean surely he wants you
[1:13:12] to feel good and whatever brings you
[1:13:14] pleasure or joy or satisfaction why is
[1:13:18] he limiting you to did you know every
[1:13:20] tree he said not to eat of every tree
[1:13:23] ow
[1:13:24] look at how he posed that
[1:13:26] no god said
[1:13:28] one
[1:13:31] it was not every tree but satan was
[1:13:34] posing it like you know having on god
[1:13:35] said to eat of every tree of the garden
[1:13:37] no no that's not actually what he said
[1:13:41] but here
[1:13:43] it's like he's making it very big and
[1:13:44] expensive
[1:13:46] and so he's skewing it
[1:13:48] just a little bit just
[1:13:50] framing it a little it's his tactic
[1:13:52] saints
[1:13:56] and this subtle suggestion that god
[1:13:57] tampers with free our freedoms and he
[1:13:59] restricts us and he's narrow and he's
[1:14:01] taking away our rights and and that's
[1:14:03] what he just wants to feed you so when
[1:14:06] he fed eve he's fed you the same thing
[1:14:12] it's an attack on truth
[1:14:15] and this is how it works
[1:14:17] just a little question he starts to put
[1:14:19] in there oh my now he would actually
[1:14:22] that's unkind of him to do that
[1:14:25] restricting you
[1:14:27] maybe that's even that's actually sounds
[1:14:29] even cruel
[1:14:32] spinning
[1:14:33] half god said this
[1:14:35] and he plants these seeds and thoughts
[1:14:38] in the mines
[1:14:41] you know it's almost like
[1:14:43] wow eve
[1:14:45] you know hath god said to do this you
[1:14:47] can't even do that but you know
[1:14:49] you know i'm for choice and freedom
[1:14:53] i've got a better way for you
[1:14:57] you know we can open things up a little
[1:14:59] more
[1:15:02] and here it starts that little bit of
[1:15:04] doubt and question
[1:15:06] in eve's mind
[1:15:08] and open the door
[1:15:10] it just needs to plant that little bit
[1:15:12] of doubt
[1:15:13] and let it spiral on because then
[1:15:16] what it did was the next step
[1:15:18] was to lay the next part
[1:15:20] which was actually
[1:15:22] the lie
[1:15:24] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:15:26] ye shall not surely die
[1:15:29] so she swallowed the doubt she swallowed
[1:15:31] the quest well yeah and she started to
[1:15:33] question god's judgment maybe in her
[1:15:35] mind on well why did he do that why did
[1:15:37] he say that you start to to question and
[1:15:40] now put in your own opinion on the
[1:15:42] matter
[1:15:43] well you know yeah that is that but you
[1:15:45] know my way might be a better way or you
[1:15:47] know that seems a little absurd that's
[1:15:49] not really in accordance with the
[1:15:50] culture of our day i mean why would why
[1:15:52] would we be restricted like that yeah
[1:15:54] yeah see
[1:15:55] that won't die
[1:15:58] and so it is the it's the start of the
[1:16:00] next part which he then you're able to
[1:16:02] swallow the lie
[1:16:04] and which is what happened
[1:16:07] for god doth know them the day eat
[1:16:08] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:16:10] and you shall be as gods
[1:16:15] really
[1:16:16] really what happened is satan serpent
[1:16:19] said to eve
[1:16:20] that god's a liar and he didn't tell you
[1:16:22] the truth
[1:16:24] is that essentially what he said
[1:16:26] he won't die god's a liar
[1:16:30] you're like how did eve get there
[1:16:33] how did you get from walking with god in
[1:16:35] the cool of the evening and communing
[1:16:37] with him with adam and eve and god
[1:16:38] coming down in the evening and speaking
[1:16:40] with them him as brother brandon talks
[1:16:42] about putting them to bed and all of
[1:16:44] that and
[1:16:45] how do you get from there to well you
[1:16:47] know he's a liar
[1:16:49] because that's what she swallowed
[1:16:51] he won't die oh okay well he must be
[1:16:53] lying
[1:16:55] incredible
[1:16:56] it's a slippery slope
[1:16:58] gird up your loin saints with the word
[1:17:00] of god because that's what she stepped
[1:17:02] away from and got away from the
[1:17:04] protection of the word and she should
[1:17:05] have pointed back and just said with
[1:17:07] affirmative yeah god did say that and
[1:17:09] i'm following it every bit
[1:17:12] that's what should have happened but
[1:17:13] it's the question it's that little bit
[1:17:15] of doubt that starts to ring and it
[1:17:17] plants it in your head and you start to
[1:17:18] let the nest as butter brown said starts
[1:17:20] to to build itself out as you start to
[1:17:22] ponder well yeah maybe that maybe that
[1:17:25] is a baby off a bit there i don't have a
[1:17:27] better idea on that or or somebody
[1:17:29] else's idea is better than that
[1:17:31] it's just the same trickery it's the
[1:17:33] same deception and you're falling into
[1:17:35] the same situation that eve did that
[1:17:37] turned the whole world upside down
[1:17:39] beware
[1:17:43] god's word is not flawed
[1:17:46] it's not narrow
[1:17:53] but abram says
[1:17:56] eve was easily persuaded by satan from
[1:17:57] the word of god and she leaned on her
[1:17:59] own understanding
[1:18:00] because satan projected something to her
[1:18:02] which wasn't to her real understanding
[1:18:04] of god but she had something else told
[1:18:07] her by the enemy satan and she believed
[1:18:09] it and plunged the human race to death
[1:18:12] my he says look he goes now
[1:18:16] says the same as now too many people who
[1:18:19] rely on their own understanding
[1:18:21] their dogmas and their creeds and so
[1:18:22] forth claiming the word of god is not
[1:18:24] altogether true that some of it is
[1:18:26] inspired and some of it is not how can
[1:18:28] you have faith in a bible if part of it
[1:18:30] is inspired and part of it is not it's
[1:18:33] either all true or all not don't be
[1:18:35] picking and choosing there's no picking
[1:18:37] and choosing on nothing it's either all
[1:18:38] truth or all false
[1:18:41] i think it was spurgeon that said i
[1:18:43] don't have the full quote but he said
[1:18:45] about discerning he said it's pretty
[1:18:46] easy and i'm paraphrasing to to uh to
[1:18:49] discern between right and wrong or true
[1:18:51] and false or right and right and wrong
[1:18:54] but it's pretty hard it gets a little it
[1:18:55] needs a discernment of god to discern
[1:18:57] between right and almost right
[1:19:01] right and almost right it's easy to
[1:19:04] figure out the other ones it was black
[1:19:05] and white i got that one but what about
[1:19:06] almost right what about 99
[1:19:08] right and one percent wrong figure that
[1:19:10] one out you need truth you need the word
[1:19:12] of god that is the only thing that will
[1:19:14] discern it for the word of god is the
[1:19:16] discerner of the thoughts and tense of
[1:19:18] the hearts even dividing unto the soul
[1:19:20] and the spirit the word of god truth in
[1:19:22] this day is only coming from this source
[1:19:26] you need that because it's almost right
[1:19:28] and right these days that's where it is
[1:19:30] it is not right and wrong it's almost
[1:19:32] right it looks about right or maybe i
[1:19:34] could do that and it's dead wrong
[1:19:35] actually by the word of god
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:40] god give us uncompromising people not
[1:19:42] just ministers of the gospel but
[1:19:44] children of the living god that will say
[1:19:46] that might look about right but it's
[1:19:48] wrong by the word of god because that's
[1:19:50] the belt that i placed on i've girded
[1:19:52] myself with the truth of god
[1:19:55] hallelujah
[1:20:00] i say may god give you eyesight
[1:20:02] to see the tactics of the enemy that's
[1:20:05] just feeding in that slivered little
[1:20:06] tongue of his
[1:20:08] just to feed into you a little bit um
[1:20:10] what hath god said
[1:20:12] when it's get posed that way in your
[1:20:14] mind just
[1:20:15] put the flags up
[1:20:17] yeah that's a little bit kind of an odd
[1:20:18] statement it should come across like the
[1:20:20] word of god says this amen
[1:20:23] it does say that or you're like the word
[1:20:24] of god says that you're like no one
[1:20:26] doesn't you're dead wrong it'd be like
[1:20:27] that but if something's coming across
[1:20:29] well does it really say that
[1:20:32] oh
[1:20:33] that's the serpent
[1:20:36] i'm just going to say
[1:20:37] that's the serpent watch how he conveys
[1:20:40] it well really is it really you know
[1:20:43] maybe just trim your hair a little bit
[1:20:45] does it really mean that you can't even
[1:20:47] just do a little
[1:20:48] that's the serpent
[1:21:00] where am i lord help me
[1:21:05] now he's used this as i said through
[1:21:07] time
[1:21:08] satan has crafted it as i think i said
[1:21:10] in another service
[1:21:12] unfortunately he has victims about 70 to
[1:21:14] 90 years of time and so they come they
[1:21:17] go and
[1:21:18] but he's crafted over thousands of years
[1:21:20] so he's got it pretty down and so i'm
[1:21:21] trying to make you aware
[1:21:22] of it and so truth though
[1:21:26] he gets it down to where now you can
[1:21:28] kind of continually create maybe your
[1:21:30] own opinion
[1:21:32] of the word of god
[1:21:34] and that's where really the devil really
[1:21:36] wants you is where you come to your own
[1:21:37] version
[1:21:38] of truth
[1:21:40] and that's really what we're living in
[1:21:41] right now
[1:21:42] is indeed the truth has become a bit of
[1:21:44] a relative thing
[1:21:46] truth is relative i'll explain that
[1:21:49] maybe for those that maybe don't it's
[1:21:51] something that's relative if i maybe i
[1:21:53] made uh i went to go buy a car maybe if
[1:21:55] i make 10 bucks an hour
[1:21:57] and uh i wanted to buy a nice fancy car
[1:21:59] that was about 100 grand well
[1:22:02] that's just wickedly expensive
[1:22:04] and probably very very far out of my
[1:22:06] price range and should probably
[1:22:08] come much much lower but if i made about
[1:22:11] 50 million a month
[1:22:12] you know 100 grand for a car is chump
[1:22:15] change it's peanuts
[1:22:17] right i could have about like 50 of them
[1:22:19] because it's relative to my income okay
[1:22:22] the value of it's relative to to what
[1:22:24] i'm doing you say well intelligence can
[1:22:26] even be relative because you know
[1:22:28] someone could say well
[1:22:29] i'm really smart at something and other
[1:22:31] people maybe are not
[1:22:32] well you know i could i could be very
[1:22:35] smart at maybe maybe certain things
[1:22:37] maybe whatever technology whatever you
[1:22:39] say i i know that really well but if i
[1:22:41] stood beside maybe something like bill
[1:22:42] gates or somebody these high flying tech
[1:22:44] guys i pretty much look like the dummy
[1:22:46] right because it's relative
[1:22:48] right and the same thing bill gates
[1:22:50] could stand beside my my wife or
[1:22:52] something that he couldn't cook himself
[1:22:53] out of a out of a paper bag but my wife
[1:22:56] she can
[1:22:58] quite quite well and and so it's
[1:23:00] relative all right
[1:23:02] so that's the truth has become that way
[1:23:05] it's become relative
[1:23:07] you know i kind of just see god my way
[1:23:11] uh-huh
[1:23:14] we all have our own truth
[1:23:16] oh do you
[1:23:18] and so now we have lots of you know
[1:23:20] truth is subjective
[1:23:21] my culture is true and your culture's
[1:23:23] true it's all true
[1:23:25] oh
[1:23:26] okay and we're all okay
[1:23:27] all right truth is in the eye of the
[1:23:29] beholder well that was beauty so someone
[1:23:31] pulled in truth different strokes for
[1:23:33] different folks oh right your strokes
[1:23:35] are just as good as my strokes
[1:23:36] apparently and you have your beliefs and
[1:23:38] i have mine and that's just the end of
[1:23:39] it oh all right
[1:23:41] or maybe just trust your feelings
[1:23:43] oh you know whatever makes you feel good
[1:23:46] go for it that's your truth
[1:23:48] that's where we're at these days i'm a
[1:23:50] smart guy i got degrees across the
[1:23:51] across the window tac-tac-tac i got him
[1:23:53] up in the wall i got a high iq surely i
[1:23:56] should kind of know what truth is
[1:23:58] or maybe i have a high eq
[1:24:00] and i'm really in in touch with my
[1:24:01] emotional side and you know i really
[1:24:03] have sensitivity to different situations
[1:24:05] and i can sense and i can feel my way
[1:24:07] through situations because you know i
[1:24:09] got it
[1:24:10] my truth
[1:24:12] it's relative to me
[1:24:16] not the case saints
[1:24:20] but abraham says the time has come
[1:24:22] or you have to stand on god's word
[1:24:25] stand alone but when the time comes
[1:24:27] stand there there's got to be a time
[1:24:28] when you've got to separate yourself
[1:24:30] between your feelings
[1:24:32] this is for those that stick close to
[1:24:34] feelings
[1:24:36] separate between your feelings
[1:24:38] and your faith
[1:24:39] he says that time
[1:24:41] is tonight
[1:24:43] he said tonight i'll say this morning
[1:24:45] that time is right now feelings betray
[1:24:47] you
[1:24:48] hate to break it to you they're up today
[1:24:50] and they're down tomorrow you follow
[1:24:52] feelings you're following emotions and
[1:24:54] we're human i get it we go through tough
[1:24:55] situation we go through a good situation
[1:24:57] today it's like oh i love this week you
[1:24:59] have a difficult situation ahead of you
[1:25:00] i hate this week it's a drain and that's
[1:25:02] what you follow your feelings and that's
[1:25:04] your true source that's your center
[1:25:06] focus dear goodness that's why it's like
[1:25:08] this and whoo like that and everywhere
[1:25:10] else because the truth is jesus christ
[1:25:13] it doesn't really matter what your
[1:25:14] feelings say what your circumstances say
[1:25:17] it's the word that's true your word is
[1:25:19] your anchor
[1:25:24] jesus never said did you feel it
[1:25:27] but abram says
[1:25:29] did you believe it
[1:25:30] it's by faith not by feeling
[1:25:33] my he says the devil can beat you around
[1:25:35] every stump in the country saying it's
[1:25:38] by your feelings
[1:25:43] i'm not saying because i feel like i'm
[1:25:45] saved i'm saved because god's word
[1:25:48] truth
[1:25:49] says i'm saved
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:52] you're gonna have a good day and a bad
[1:25:53] day
[1:25:54] and you might be up and you might feel
[1:25:55] pretty down but truth says
[1:25:58] truth says you're saved
[1:26:00] amen christ says you're saved who cares
[1:26:02] how bad you feel
[1:26:04] i'm saved by his love divine amen i wish
[1:26:08] i knew the rest of those words of that
[1:26:09] song
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:13] my goodness
[1:26:15] truth lord help us
[1:26:17] make this our absolute
[1:26:19] brother brahman speaks the message
[1:26:20] absolute a few times
[1:26:22] i suggest you listen to it he says my he
[1:26:24] goes in a quote he goes now he goes but
[1:26:26] you're afraid
[1:26:28] your goal by how you feel because you've
[1:26:30] regarded that you've lived by your
[1:26:32] feelings that your whole life has been
[1:26:34] wrapped up in that but you must get away
[1:26:37] from that and act on god's word amen act
[1:26:40] on god's word not what you feel not what
[1:26:42] you see what god said by his word
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:48] we don't truth is not relative this is a
[1:26:50] bit of a news flash for you truth is not
[1:26:52] relative it's unshakable reality
[1:26:54] completely immunized by subjectivity
[1:26:57] it's not subject to your day subject to
[1:26:59] how you feel subject to anything in this
[1:27:01] planet its truth is absolute that's the
[1:27:05] absolute truth
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:12] if you took the idea that truth is
[1:27:14] relative
[1:27:14] you know you know i have my own my own
[1:27:17] anchor post and it's just as good as
[1:27:19] your anchor posts but they're different
[1:27:21] and they're both true and i'll have my
[1:27:23] own idea of how good it is and you just
[1:27:25] stay off of it and and you know leave me
[1:27:27] alone and it's okay you can have your
[1:27:29] own that idea i was like you know

[1:30:45] patience and so he puts us through
[1:30:47] certain things to make us who we ought
[1:30:49] to be but if you're just like well i'm
[1:30:50] going to do what i think is right for me
[1:30:52] well guess what
[1:30:53] you ain't going to become perfection i
[1:30:55] need to break it to you because this
[1:30:56] path of least resistance on our human
[1:30:57] minds and our human desires and so you
[1:31:00] you don't work either
[1:31:06] i'll tell you what else doesn't work
[1:31:09] all religions
[1:31:11] end in heaven
[1:31:12] that don't work neither
[1:31:16] all pathways
[1:31:18] lead to christ all pathways lead to
[1:31:20] heaven
[1:31:22] christianity is so narrow
[1:31:24] so limiting they say
[1:31:27] well there's got to be i'm sorry
[1:31:30] there's got to be something that's true
[1:31:34] something has to be true
[1:31:39] and i love this quote
[1:31:42] better brown says
[1:31:45] i believe we're living in the last day
[1:31:47] i believe that the last day message
[1:31:49] this is the last message this message of
[1:31:51] grace that god has given to his church
[1:31:52] and i believe that at any time christ
[1:31:54] could come that's why i'm here tonight
[1:31:56] he says he says to call every side of
[1:31:58] the world and all that i can do to let
[1:32:01] the people see that he is the true and
[1:32:04] living god just wait now and that he is
[1:32:07] the only door the only religion out of
[1:32:10] thousands of religions in the world
[1:32:13] christian religion is the only one that
[1:32:16] can prove that their founder is still
[1:32:19] alive hallelujah that's jesus christ
[1:32:23] amen it's the only religion that can
[1:32:26] prove he's living and today in you and
[1:32:28] me and god came on the scene i will get
[1:32:31] to it to prove and show down that yes i
[1:32:34] am alive and well living to tell the
[1:32:37] world i'm the same yesterday today and
[1:32:39] forever
[1:32:43] he said nothing to be ashamed of in
[1:32:45] christianity if this isn't the truth
[1:32:47] then i'm through with it if this isn't
[1:32:49] the truth i want it's the biggest error
[1:32:51] the world's ever had but if it is the
[1:32:54] truth then i'm willing to die for it
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:32:58] amen
[1:33:00] my through time there's been moments of
[1:33:02] time when opinions have raised
[1:33:04] themselves up
[1:33:06] let's remember though again it's been a
[1:33:08] battle all through the years all through
[1:33:10] the ages and if we go back in the times
[1:33:12] of israel
[1:33:14] god delivered israel out of egypt showed
[1:33:16] himself mighty
[1:33:18] then there was a mingling
[1:33:20] they started mingling
[1:33:21] with the canaanites and they mingled
[1:33:24] themselves with the different gods
[1:33:26] that became options to them somehow
[1:33:31] and they drifted as did the resolve for
[1:33:33] truth and as we come in judges we know
[1:33:35] that it said there was no king in israel
[1:33:37] but every man did that which was right
[1:33:39] in his own eyes
[1:33:41] nothing new under the sun right
[1:33:43] they did it back then well i got my
[1:33:45] truth you got yours well look at that
[1:33:46] it's right in scripture it happened in
[1:33:47] israel's day think here now after all
[1:33:50] god did my goodness
[1:33:52] after all god did before their very eyes
[1:33:55] that they deemed it was okay to deviate
[1:33:58] my lord help us deviate worse and
[1:34:01] worship some other god here they had
[1:34:03] come back out of egypt all the signs and
[1:34:05] all the mightiness of god right before
[1:34:07] their eyes and here the commandments
[1:34:08] come to them and it says and god spake
[1:34:10] these words saying i am the lord thy god
[1:34:13] which have brought thee out of the land
[1:34:15] of egypt out of the house of bondage
[1:34:17] thou shalt have no other gods before me
[1:34:20] thou shalt not make unto thee a graven
[1:34:22] image or any likeness of anything that
[1:34:24] is in heaven above or that is in the
[1:34:25] earth beneath or that is in the water
[1:34:27] under the earth pretty much encompassed
[1:34:29] everyone did it not or everywhere thou
[1:34:31] shalt not bow down thyself nor serve
[1:34:33] them for i the lord thy god am a jealous
[1:34:36] god visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[1:34:38] unto the children under the third and
[1:34:40] fourth generation this was spoken to
[1:34:42] them by a prophet that they said oh no
[1:34:44] veil your faith it's too much don't have
[1:34:46] god speak to us it's too dead it's too
[1:34:48] incredible and then they said you speak
[1:34:50] moses
[1:34:51] yeah and he did and this is what they
[1:34:53] got
[1:34:55] but then it's like well it became okay
[1:34:59] somehow they left that
[1:35:01] straight from a prophet that was lip to
[1:35:04] ear with god
[1:35:05] and it's like wow
[1:35:07] you know we got our own idea of right
[1:35:08] and wrong
[1:35:10] sound familiar
[1:35:11] way back at the beginning
[1:35:13] sound familiar
[1:35:14] right today
[1:35:16] and so this came to a point
[1:35:18] that it's somewhat climaxed
[1:35:20] we would say in first kings
[1:35:22] when ahab
[1:35:24] who is considered the worst king
[1:35:26] of all of israel
[1:35:28] if you do he comes up quite often which
[1:35:30] because it's scripture and he he did
[1:35:33] evil in the sight of the lord
[1:35:35] and it came to pass
[1:35:37] scripture 31 31
[1:35:39] chapter 16 first kings
[1:35:41] is as if it had been
[1:35:44] a light thing
[1:35:46] think about it as if it had been a light
[1:35:49] thing for him to walk in the sins of
[1:35:52] jeroboam
[1:35:54] it became a light
[1:35:56] thing
[1:35:58] god
[1:35:59] help us
[1:36:00] to never come to that point where it's
[1:36:02] like a light thing to go and walk in the
[1:36:05] evil ways oh it should be a not so light
[1:36:08] it should be a hellfire and brimstone
[1:36:09] thing to even think about deviating from
[1:36:11] the truth of god's word and i'll be like
[1:36:13] well it's okay you know you're going
[1:36:15] through a tough time you can go do that
[1:36:16] no it's not a light thing it's a
[1:36:18] terrible thing you need god and i'm
[1:36:20] praying for you
[1:36:24] i know we need to put honey on it
[1:36:25] sometimes indeed but it's not light
[1:36:29] and they thought it would they thought
[1:36:31] it became a light thing
[1:36:32] to walk in the sins and they reared up
[1:36:34] an altar for baal
[1:36:35] and did more to provoke the lord god of
[1:36:37] israel than and and to anger than all
[1:36:40] the kings of israel that were before him
[1:36:42] hence ahab becoming and being stated as
[1:36:46] one of the worst or the worst and so now
[1:36:47] out of the blue
[1:36:49] in the next chapter elijah steps on the
[1:36:52] scene we know nothing it's just like
[1:36:53] boom
[1:36:55] here i am
[1:36:56] god to his prophet amen you want to
[1:36:59] think it's a light thing i'm sending my
[1:37:01] messenger you want to think it's a light
[1:37:03] thing here comes judgment
[1:37:05] and he says there'll be no rain or do
[1:37:08] for the next three and a half years
[1:37:11] poof gone
[1:37:13] it's like whoa
[1:37:14] no wonder they hated him
[1:37:17] they thought all things are good yeah
[1:37:18] it's all good lighting you know we're
[1:37:20] just gonna do what we want to do you
[1:37:21] know you're you do worship your god i
[1:37:23] wish you're my god i got my opinion you
[1:37:25] got your opinion and then god comes says
[1:37:26] no there's no rain famine's striking
[1:37:28] your land and then he disappears
[1:37:33] incredible
[1:37:35] you know that bale was a god of
[1:37:37] fertility
[1:37:39] god has a sense of humor you know why
[1:37:42] because he actually was called the lord
[1:37:44] of rain and dew
[1:37:47] god's like really you think so there's
[1:37:50] going to be no doer rain
[1:37:51] that's why they hate him because god put
[1:37:53] it right in their face said you're not
[1:37:54] the lord of rain and dew i created the
[1:37:57] rain i created the dew to feed my land
[1:38:00] there's no more of it call on bail all
[1:38:02] you want
[1:38:03] and then elijah walked out
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:06] amen that's my god
[1:38:11] well he was an adaptable god too because
[1:38:13] baal actually kind of went into where
[1:38:15] zeus actually became and then into
[1:38:17] jupiter he just kind of you know just
[1:38:19] he's just whatever the times
[1:38:23] whatever the times well i don't serve
[1:38:25] baal
[1:38:26] you know baal was uh he was actually a
[1:38:28] word they worsh the worship of him was
[1:38:30] in sensuality and there was a moral
[1:38:32] accent done in public in the temple of
[1:38:34] baal
[1:38:35] lots of raucous and riotous such and
[1:38:38] times that they would even sacrifice
[1:38:40] humans this was baal worship
[1:38:42] and it just changes the times it just
[1:38:44] morphed the greeks needed zeus that was
[1:38:46] the old bale the romans needed jupiter
[1:38:48] it's the old pale laodicea needs what it
[1:38:51] needs hollywood it needs this it needs
[1:38:53] that it's just the old bale
[1:38:56] well i don't watch them more a lot you
[1:38:57] know i would never been in the temple of
[1:38:59] baal all that garbage going on well i
[1:39:01] don't know what the world you're
[1:39:02] thinking of but they're watching you
[1:39:04] more relaxed all the time
[1:39:09] bail
[1:39:11] not the device but what's on it
[1:39:13] right let's just bring it to our times
[1:39:15] you look back in israel be like man they
[1:39:17] were so bad
[1:39:19] well here we are today bales has changed
[1:39:21] his name and pretty much multiplied to
[1:39:24] many different areas of of the world
[1:39:28] and so no rainer do you know he's
[1:39:29] actually they worship him uh and he's
[1:39:32] sometimes even depicted as holding a
[1:39:34] lightning bolt
[1:39:36] even more
[1:39:37] aspect that god has a sense of humor as
[1:39:39] we move forward and so in first kings 18
[1:39:41] ahab sent unto the children of israel
[1:39:43] elijah has now come he's told obadiah i
[1:39:45] believe it was says go get ahab we're
[1:39:46] going to have a we're going to have a
[1:39:48] showdown
[1:39:49] it's it's
[1:39:52] game
[1:39:52] on god is tired of it all now
[1:39:56] enough's enough
[1:39:58] and so elijah now gathers all the people
[1:40:00] up on mount carmel and he says now to
[1:40:02] the people and elijah came into them and
[1:40:04] says how long
[1:40:05] halt ye between two opinions
[1:40:09] how long you know they weren't atheists
[1:40:11] it's not that they didn't believe in god
[1:40:13] at all they knew god was real they knew
[1:40:15] jehovah was jehovah but there it's like
[1:40:17] well today it's jehovah and tomorrow
[1:40:19] it's baal and kind of back and forth
[1:40:21] maybe i just try and do both you know
[1:40:23] i'll go to go do this aspect or follow
[1:40:26] god in this way but i really enjoy this
[1:40:28] aspect of my life too so you know i'm
[1:40:29] just kind of torn in the middle and
[1:40:31] creating my own idea create my own truth
[1:40:34] and elijah says how long hulky between
[1:40:37] two opinions
[1:40:41] sitting in the middle
[1:40:44] he says that the god lord be god follow
[1:40:45] him if baal then follow him
[1:40:48] and the people answered him
[1:40:50] not a word
[1:40:51] they're like
[1:40:53] because they were caught
[1:40:55] that's exactly where they were
[1:40:56] and he was just coming right down to the
[1:40:58] pinpoint of it
[1:41:01] don't go in the middle
[1:41:02] there's either right and there's wrong
[1:41:04] so if god be god follow him and if there
[1:41:06] will be god follow him and then i go
[1:41:13] you know what halt means to be in a
[1:41:15] state of uncertainty or doubt between
[1:41:16] alternate courses
[1:41:18] like hmm
[1:41:20] kind of in the middle is this way right
[1:41:21] or that way and so they halt
[1:41:24] between their opinions
[1:41:31] now
[1:41:33] elijah says
[1:41:35] i only remain a prophet of the lord
[1:41:38] but bill's prophets are 450
[1:41:42] and so he tells them to go get their
[1:41:43] bulldogs and
[1:41:45] shows them tells them what they're going
[1:41:46] to do and dress it but put no fire under
[1:41:50] and so they said and if you call on your
[1:41:51] gods and i'll call in the name of the
[1:41:53] lord and the god that answer by fire
[1:41:56] let him be god
[1:41:58] and the people then said something it's
[1:42:00] well spoken
[1:42:02] i said all right
[1:42:04] how many of them actually sat back there
[1:42:06] and like bill doesn't have a chance
[1:42:09] like did they really believe that baal
[1:42:11] was going to come down
[1:42:12] hence the god of lightning bolts in his
[1:42:14] hand and they actually stood back there
[1:42:15] like it's well spoken elijah of course
[1:42:17] it was well spoken because they knew i
[1:42:19] don't even know where these 450 thought
[1:42:21] they were coming from because i could
[1:42:22] tell you that god had never never
[1:42:23] performed once before and somehow they
[1:42:25] thought yeah fire is going to be created
[1:42:27] because he's going to send a lightning
[1:42:29] bolt down
[1:42:30] that's how absurd our own thoughts are
[1:42:32] when we connive and come up with our own
[1:42:34] idea of truth it will never work
[1:42:37] how long and this is where god how long
[1:42:40] halti between two opinions
[1:42:44] mine so the priests of baal they got to
[1:42:47] work and here elijah my goodness i mean
[1:42:50] you can't read this scripture but kind
[1:42:51] of put a half smile on your face you
[1:42:53] know as they and they said they put
[1:42:55] their bullocks there oh baal hear us but
[1:42:58] there was no voice
[1:42:59] and they leaped upon the altar which was
[1:43:02] made and they came past noon so they've
[1:43:03] been doing this for a little while and
[1:43:05] then elijah mocked them
[1:43:06] and he says hey cry loud
[1:43:09] for he's a god
[1:43:10] he should hear you right or maybe he's
[1:43:13] talking
[1:43:14] and he's not paying attention to you he
[1:43:16] said oh he is talking or he's pursuing
[1:43:19] he's got some other business so he's
[1:43:21] pursuing something so you know we call a
[1:43:23] little louder or he maybe he's on a
[1:43:25] journey forgot about you forgot the date
[1:43:27] and you had a really big important time
[1:43:29] and he's like sorry i got other business
[1:43:30] to do and left you all crying aloud for
[1:43:33] with nothing happening
[1:43:34] per adventure maybe he's asleep he's
[1:43:37] ratcheting it up in fact he took a nap
[1:43:39] on you and he doesn't care where's your
[1:43:41] god
[1:43:44] my elijah
[1:43:45] that's what i said you kind of gotta
[1:43:46] have to have a half smile when you read
[1:43:48] that part of the scripture
[1:43:53] i like that about god sometimes he's
[1:43:55] like i'm just going to prove who i am
[1:43:58] i'm just going to set the record here
[1:43:59] for you
[1:44:00] you you thought you could have this
[1:44:02] opinion
[1:44:02] well i'm going to show it to you now and
[1:44:04] they cried aloud and even cut themselves
[1:44:06] in matter with knives and lancets and
[1:44:08] blood gushed out upon them they were
[1:44:09] getting serious
[1:44:12] oh yeah they bet they're serious because
[1:44:13] jezebel was somewhere else and they knew
[1:44:14] something was going to happen and they
[1:44:16] worshiped loud and boisterous and with
[1:44:17] all this emotion you can have a whole
[1:44:19] lot of emotion you can a whole lot of
[1:44:21] boisterousness it doesn't mean nothing
[1:44:23] actually
[1:44:25] it didn't mean nothing here you need the
[1:44:27] life source you can have all the emotion
[1:44:29] you want but make sure it's coming from
[1:44:31] the source of truth
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:35] and so here they are trying to get their
[1:44:37] altar to
[1:44:38] have fire rain down from heaven
[1:44:42] god never vindicates falseness
[1:44:45] and never vindicate a lie
[1:44:47] never
[1:44:49] never
[1:44:51] and if you're looking for vindication
[1:44:52] you step off beating path you step off
[1:44:54] from the word of truth god will never
[1:44:56] stand behind you
[1:44:58] ever once
[1:44:59] and you might think satan might make it
[1:45:00] all the glamorous and everything's all
[1:45:02] going good i mean hey for three and a
[1:45:03] half years these prophets of bill
[1:45:04] thought everything was going fine but at
[1:45:05] some point there ain't nobody standing
[1:45:07] when it really mattered god wasn't
[1:45:09] standing behind them
[1:45:10] they had a zippo
[1:45:12] and so when you deviate from god's word
[1:45:14] you start stepping off on your own
[1:45:15] little little ways god isn't behind you
[1:45:18] not even a little bit
[1:45:21] and maybe sometimes truth hurts
[1:45:25] truth can hurt sometimes and you gotta
[1:45:27] walk yourself back a little bit so i got
[1:45:30] off the pathway of truth
[1:45:32] and it can hurt
[1:45:33] but get back to the right path
[1:45:35] because at that showdown moment you want
[1:45:38] god to vindicate you
[1:45:41] and this is where
[1:45:42] elijah was and it came to pass midday
[1:45:44] they prophesied until the offering of
[1:45:46] the evening sacrifice nothing no answer
[1:45:48] neither voice and elijah said come
[1:45:51] near unto me
[1:45:53] and the people came near
[1:45:55] you can't tell me they were surprised
[1:45:58] and they came near
[1:46:00] and i loved the scripture
[1:46:02] and he repaired the altar of the lord
[1:46:05] that was broken down
[1:46:08] and elijah
[1:46:10] gets down and starts to build and repair
[1:46:12] the altar
[1:46:15] maybe we need to get down and repair the
[1:46:17] altar
[1:46:18] of our lives this is a little off i've
[1:46:20] been way out here and he starts to
[1:46:22] repair and build the altar that was
[1:46:24] broken that's where it began
[1:46:27] right at the beginning right at the
[1:46:28] foundation place
[1:46:32] and he took 12 stones numbers of the
[1:46:34] tribes of the sons of jacob and he
[1:46:37] builds the altar puts the wood in order
[1:46:39] as such in the block and the pieces laid
[1:46:41] them on the wood and then he says fill
[1:46:43] four barrels of water
[1:46:46] pour them all over
[1:46:47] my
[1:46:49] god ain't taking no chance of butter
[1:46:51] brandon actually says
[1:46:53] now to be sure he says there's no faking
[1:46:56] it
[1:46:59] god is going to make sure there ain't no
[1:47:00] fake in this one
[1:47:02] there's no way they're going to be like
[1:47:03] well maybe he's stuck in a little torch
[1:47:05] when we were blinking no no no i'm gonna
[1:47:07] put on four barrels of water ain't no
[1:47:09] little flick of a torch gonna even
[1:47:10] happen you're gonna need some serious
[1:47:12] fire so put four barrels of water and
[1:47:14] i've also built that trench which you
[1:47:16] know he built and filled it up okay
[1:47:18] all these four barrels of water go down
[1:47:20] on there do it a second time
[1:47:22] pity the poor men that are holding the
[1:47:24] barrels
[1:47:25] do it a third time
[1:47:27] they've doused this thing there ain't no
[1:47:29] way that this thing by man is going to
[1:47:31] even flicker
[1:47:36] that's some confidence
[1:47:38] in truth
[1:47:40] elijah had confidence in the word of god
[1:47:42] and that's the same confidence that we
[1:47:44] can have is when i'm standing on the
[1:47:46] word of god it doesn't matter douse it
[1:47:49] with water put whatever you want but
[1:47:51] there ain't no faking it here my god
[1:47:53] will answer by fire
[1:47:55] my goodness 450 priests of bear like oh
[1:47:58] dear
[1:47:59] what's going on now and so here they
[1:48:02] come
[1:48:03] brother braham says he wanted to show
[1:48:05] that god was god because why he had thus
[1:48:08] saith the lord and the water ran about
[1:48:11] the altar and filled the trench and
[1:48:13] elijah said he came here and said lord
[1:48:15] god of abraham isaac and israel let it
[1:48:18] be known this day that thou art god and
[1:48:20] that i am the sorry thy servant and i
[1:48:23] have done all these things at thy word
[1:48:25] hear me o lord
[1:48:26] you want to be founded on truth hear me
[1:48:29] o lord if you are off the truth and you
[1:48:32] scream that out there is no lord that's
[1:48:34] gonna respond to you but he was on the
[1:48:37] word of god he was centered and focused
[1:48:40] and firmly planted on truth and he says
[1:48:42] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:48:45] may know that thou art the lord god and
[1:48:48] thou thou hast turned their heart
[1:48:51] back again
[1:48:52] that sounds like a familiar scripture
[1:48:54] that they'll turn the hearts of the
[1:48:56] children back to their fathers that i
[1:48:59] made that you may turn their heart back
[1:49:01] again who was doing this elijah was
[1:49:04] doing this then the fire of the lord
[1:49:06] fell and he consumed the birth sacrifice
[1:49:09] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:49:12] and licked up the water that was in the
[1:49:14] trench
[1:49:14] hallelujah
[1:49:16] that's my god it was showdown time this
[1:49:19] was no okay karaoke six guns god is
[1:49:22] saying uh-uh i'm gonna lick up the dust
[1:49:24] i'm gonna consume the stones and even
[1:49:26] suck up the water
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:29] just in case you thought i was faking it
[1:49:32] i took it all
[1:49:36] amen
[1:49:38] you know what happened after that
[1:49:39] it was a terrible time to be on the
[1:49:41] other side of the fence it's a terrible
[1:49:43] time to be on false it was a terrible
[1:49:45] time to be a priest of baal because you
[1:49:48] died
[1:49:49] they pursued them i say saints of god
[1:49:52] pursue the enemy
[1:49:54] god may god serve him and if you haven't
[1:49:56] been serving him serve him this morning
[1:49:58] and pursue the priest of baal pursue
[1:50:00] those things and gods that have been
[1:50:02] pulling you off change your opinion in
[1:50:04] fact forget the opinion just turn the
[1:50:06] truth
[1:50:08] [Applause]
[1:50:10] kill them little imp devils that are
[1:50:11] pulling you off of it
[1:50:16] dear lord help me with time
[1:50:18] we'll just wind up now
[1:50:23] i believe this morning
[1:50:25] it's showdown time
[1:50:29] but abram says now
[1:50:30] god sent us some more elijah
[1:50:32] that will not compromise
[1:50:34] someone who will preach truth no matter
[1:50:36] how bad it hurts
[1:50:37] god's got servants in every community
[1:50:39] that won't compromise with the things of
[1:50:41] the world
[1:50:42] god has servants
[1:50:44] in each community
[1:50:45] that won't compromise on the things of
[1:50:47] the world
[1:50:48] he said elijah didn't like the modern
[1:50:50] trend of things so that's scripture
[1:50:54] we're not of this world
[1:50:56] nor do we love the things of this world
[1:50:58] for the love of god would not even be in
[1:51:00] us then
[1:51:01] and elijah didn't like the modern trend
[1:51:04] of things i'm going to type myself
[1:51:06] and pattern after elijah and so if he
[1:51:09] didn't like the modern trend of things
[1:51:10] i'm going to do the same
[1:51:12] modern trend and where it's going i
[1:51:14] don't like it he didn't like it and god
[1:51:16] answered him but with fire and so i need
[1:51:18] that god amen he said so he stood true
[1:51:21] to god and the showdown came
[1:51:23] and the showdown has come again
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:30] jesus said
[1:51:32] then jesus to those jews which believed
[1:51:34] on him if you continue in my word
[1:51:36] and you be my disciples
[1:51:39] he said
[1:51:40] and ye shall know the truth
[1:51:42] and the truth
[1:51:43] christ
[1:51:45] the word
[1:51:46] will set
[1:51:47] you free
[1:51:49] amen
[1:51:51] we need a congregation
[1:51:52] i pray lord that doesn't allow the devil
[1:51:55] to pull the wool over our eyes we've got
[1:51:57] the word of god that can set us free i
[1:52:00] don't care from what maybe say well i'm
[1:52:01] a believer yes i believe everybody here
[1:52:03] i pray to god that you're all believers
[1:52:05] and we're walking on this narrow way
[1:52:07] with the truth of god in our hearts but
[1:52:08] sometimes we might be going we have a
[1:52:10] difficulty maybe there's a little
[1:52:11] complex maybe there's some little fear
[1:52:14] or something and that's that the devil's
[1:52:16] trying to pull that down the truth shall
[1:52:18] set you free and the truth is christ
[1:52:21] jesus himself it's the word of god and
[1:52:23] it's here to free you from even the
[1:52:26] littlest of things
[1:52:27] say well i have this little complex here
[1:52:29] the truth shall set you free lay it down
[1:52:32] before him say oh god i'm done with that
[1:52:34] don't let no devil pull his thoughts on
[1:52:36] me well i could just you could just kind
[1:52:38] of live with this you know no you've
[1:52:39] already then now put your own thought in
[1:52:41] there and that's your own truth it's not
[1:52:43] the truth shall set you free
[1:52:48] truth strips satan from death and hell
[1:52:51] truth sent the word to this day to give
[1:52:53] us a promise that this body shall be
[1:52:55] changed truth sent a word that created
[1:52:58] an expectation in my heart that word put
[1:53:00] an expectation here sent a prophet to
[1:53:02] this day so they could build in me i'm
[1:53:05] ready i'm ready to go i'm gonna be gone
[1:53:07] in a twinkling of an eye that's what
[1:53:09] truth is done
[1:53:16] it's got to come down to a real deal
[1:53:18] saints
[1:53:19] i prayed in my
[1:53:21] little room i said lord
[1:53:23] it's not just zurich this can't be
[1:53:25] services
[1:53:26] just can't be services every week and
[1:53:28] week out
[1:53:29] that's not what we've come to i i don't
[1:53:31] believe it that for even moment in my
[1:53:33] heart
[1:53:34] i'm believing the lord it'll move in
[1:53:36] such a mighty way we come to church and
[1:53:38] say lord
[1:53:39] move in this congregation
[1:53:41] moving the bride around this world
[1:53:43] moving every church i prayed this
[1:53:44] morning i said with the fire of god
[1:53:46] anointing every minister and pastor this
[1:53:48] morning as they deliver the word of god
[1:53:50] to their people because we are hungry
[1:53:52] not just to come to church and sit there
[1:53:54] and hear a good sermon or whatever but i
[1:53:56] want to see the move of god start to
[1:53:58] stir amongst our hearts and it starts to
[1:54:00] move from person to person to person
[1:54:02] someone through the speaking of the word
[1:54:03] they're healed they're delivered that
[1:54:05] i've dealt with this for so long but
[1:54:06] it's gone now why because by faith you
[1:54:09] just take him at his word it's not
[1:54:11] difficult but satan makes it seem
[1:54:13] difficult it's just believe
[1:54:20] i point you back to a prior quote
[1:54:24] brother branham says
[1:54:31] he said christianity is the only
[1:54:33] religion
[1:54:34] that can prove their founders still
[1:54:36] alive
[1:54:39] brother branham
[1:54:40] in a service as we close
[1:54:45] he says i feel led to do something
[1:54:50] he said let's just take the ones that
[1:54:51] don't have prayer cards
[1:54:55] he says well
[1:54:56] and the ones with paragraphs where they
[1:54:57] can get into he says but we'll just take
[1:54:59] the ones
[1:55:02] without he says raise your hands again
[1:55:05] the ones that sick hasn't got a prayer
[1:55:06] card
[1:55:08] oh that's everybody in here
[1:55:10] we don't have a prayer card
[1:55:15] he says here's a showdown
[1:55:19] do you believe i've told you the truth
[1:55:23] do you believe you have spiritual
[1:55:24] discernment
[1:55:26] to know
[1:55:27] that it is the truth
[1:55:29] because you don't have to come up here
[1:55:32] he says now if it comes to healing he
[1:55:34] said
[1:55:35] if he was standing right here with this
[1:55:36] suit on
[1:55:37] he couldn't heal you
[1:55:39] because he's already done it
[1:55:41] he could only prove
[1:55:43] that he was the christ
[1:55:47] how would you know it by the fruit
[1:55:49] and he so he now goes and he goes now
[1:55:51] what did he do and he starts speaking of
[1:55:53] how the messiah proved who he was and
[1:55:55] how he showed peter and john and
[1:55:57] nathanael and he goes that's what they
[1:55:59] were it was the closing of their age
[1:56:00] then he spoke about the samaritans and
[1:56:02] he goes through the sign of the messiah
[1:56:04] which the messiah would tell us all
[1:56:05] things he says i am he and he did not go
[1:56:07] to the gentiles he said for the gentiles
[1:56:09] wasn't looking for him so lord we're
[1:56:11] looking for you
[1:56:14] amen
[1:56:16] do you believe he's here
[1:56:17] he says would you discern it
[1:56:20] i said lord
[1:56:23] i gotta bring it down right here
[1:56:25] do you believe he's here
[1:56:27] could we discern it
[1:56:30] he says i want to turn my back to this
[1:56:31] audience
[1:56:32] and i'll pray
[1:56:34] and he said the holy ghost will prove
[1:56:36] what i said tonight at the closing of
[1:56:38] this message that the same signs that
[1:56:41] jesus said would give to sodom would be
[1:56:43] given to this generations then you
[1:56:45] discern what spirit is here and eisen
[1:56:48] said and now you choose who is god
[1:56:52] this isn't showdown time in elijah's day
[1:56:55] this isn't showdown time in some prior
[1:56:57] age this is our day and i don't believe
[1:57:00] after they had the mount carmel showdown
[1:57:02] and they went to their homes and they
[1:57:03] knew clearly who god was who was it baal
[1:57:06] or was it jehovah they knew exactly who
[1:57:08] was god and their children knew exactly
[1:57:10] who was god and their children's
[1:57:12] children i can tell you knew who was god
[1:57:14] they didn't need a repeat of elijah to
[1:57:16] come back up all right let's go have a
[1:57:18] showdown again and we'll have the altar
[1:57:20] consumed they knew from that moment god
[1:57:22] was god and he didn't have to define
[1:57:24] himself one more time for them it was
[1:57:27] already a fact from that moment
[1:57:30] and i say you choose
[1:57:32] who is god
[1:57:34] lord let's not stop halting from opinion
[1:57:36] to your opinion
[1:57:37] is god god let's serve him
[1:57:43] and now then he starts to discern he
[1:57:44] says this little lady over there the
[1:57:46] light over this woman he just started he
[1:57:48] just finished explaining how many times
[1:57:50] over how what
[1:57:51] how does god define himself how did he
[1:57:53] show himself who he was he was a sign of
[1:57:55] the messiah hum over and over and so
[1:57:57] then now he says the light's over you
[1:57:58] it's circling above her remember he has
[1:58:00] his back turned
[1:58:02] and he says there's now you don't have a
[1:58:03] chance he says you're praying i just see
[1:58:05] there's a dark shadow it's death this
[1:58:08] woman is shadowed to death she's cancer
[1:58:10] you believe god can heal you i said lord
[1:58:12] jesus
[1:58:13] we've got we've got people that have
[1:58:15] cancer
[1:58:16] this is showdown time this is a time
[1:58:18] when god be god i said oh god
[1:58:21] show yourself again let's take you at
[1:58:23] your word tonight this morning hey man
[1:58:26] he says you believe god can heal you
[1:58:27] it's cancer the breasts and the doctors
[1:58:29] he's looking at and he starts saying
[1:58:31] different things he's seen he says oh
[1:58:32] you're a woman preacher that's dust
[1:58:34] saith the lord stand on your feet if
[1:58:36] that's right amen there was an
[1:58:38] acknowledgment you tell me you proved
[1:58:41] that what i'm saying is correct so it
[1:58:42] could be before the whole world one more
[1:58:44] time if god be god serve him if there'll
[1:58:47] be baal serve him and he's showing god
[1:58:50] once again i am god i'm the same one
[1:58:53] that came down with elijah on mount
[1:58:55] carmel i'm still alive today
[1:58:57] christianity those that believe in jesus
[1:59:00] christ it's the only religion that can
[1:59:02] point back and say our god is living
[1:59:08] because he's doing exactly what he said
[1:59:10] he would do
[1:59:12] he says can you discern that the same
[1:59:14] jesus that touched the woman touched his
[1:59:15] garment not me i don't know the woman oh
[1:59:18] i see a lady in a vision she's praying
