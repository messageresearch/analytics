TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Praise the Lord. We want to greet you each and everyone in the name of Jesus Christ. Welcome you to his house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you the tabernacle, the living God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's certainly good to be standing this morning, breathing the air that God's created, enjoying these dimensions that he's given us to live in. Not beyond the curtain of time yet, but looking forward to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn the screen to 24:30. Soon and very soon, we're going to go and be with our Lord forever, eternally. Amen.

I'm coming up on the rough side of the mountain. Holy God, his powerful hand. I'm coming up. Oh, on the right side of the mountain. And I'm doing my best to make it. Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. Amen. Amen. Why don't you turn to somebody standing next to you? Give him a handshake. Say, "God bless you, brother. God bless you, sister. It's good to be in the presence of the Lord this morning." &gt;&gt; Amen. Truly wonderful. We've got a lot of prayer requests this morning. How many thankful for that? Another opportunity for the Lord to show his power and his grace in our midst. We've got testimonies. Praise the Lord. It's a wonderful day to be alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a good perspective of that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Your eyes fixed on Calvary. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thought. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, we want to take the needs before the Lord. But just before we do, why don't we sing Sheltered in the Arms of God, number 253. [Music] So let the storms raise high. Oh they don't bother me for I shall saint within the arms of God. He walks with me and all can harm me [Music] for I shall the arms of God. So let the souls raise high. Oh thank you Jesus.

He was with me and all [Music] for I the arms of God. Hallelujah. Oh, we give you praise this morning, Lord. from the depths of our heart. Lord, we give you thanks, Jesus. Lord, that we can look outside and see the natural sun. Lord, a testimony that you have given us on a day-to-day basis, Father, that your resurrection is alive and well. Father, we want to thank you this morning that we could all be standing here present, Lord, not in one another's presence, Lord, but in your presence, Father. Hallelujah. It thrills our souls, Lord Jesus, to see what you're doing amongst your body, Lord, around the world, as we have seen the testimonies our brother Tony has brought back to us, Lord. Lord, of what you're doing in Asia, Lord, what you're doing down in South America, Father. Lord, we want to look to all those places and see that the mighty hand of God is doing a great sweep in these last days. [Music] Lord, as our brother brought it to our attention to God, &gt;&gt; how much more do we want to do our be faithful in the house of God here in our own place of worship, Lord, in our own backyards, Lord, the word first had to go out of Jerusalem. Father, we want to give you praise this morning that you, Father, would be high and lifted up, Lord, as we will read these prayer requests out before you, Lord. No doubt a brother will come and stand behind this sacred desk and pray over them, Lord, that people will raise their voices, Lord, crying out to you once more that you would come on the scene for these great needs. But Lord, it's because we have a confidence that you are a the God of creation, a God that made this very body that we're standing in. You are more than able to raise it up. &gt;&gt; So Lord, may there be a great multitude of testimonies come back, &gt;&gt; maybe read out once again as a testimony for what you have done. We just commit this service to you now. Have your own way, Lord. is our desire. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. [Music] We've got a testimony from brother Randy and sister Lorie Snow and family like to give honor and praise to our God for all his mercy and goodness to us. A couple of weeks ago, Amanda had a tumor removed from her finger. The surgeon, who is the chief surgeon of the orthopedics at Children's Hospital, was certain that it was cancer. After calling Brother Ed for prayer, we decided to speak the word claiming that this was not cancer and that the doctors would be baffled when it turned out not to be. Friday, we received a call from the oncologist. After receiving the report from the pathologist, which had done several different tests, even additional tests not normally done, the word was given back that the tumor was in fact not cancer, &gt;&gt; but a benign skin tumor. Praise the Lord. We rejoice in the Lord for his coming on the scene to help us once again. Amen. Praise the Lord. They also have an unspoken request that they'd like us to remember in prayer this morning as we go to prayer. Amen. We've got several needs to let you know about this morning. [Music] I don't know why, but I can't call anybody to pray. It's very strange. I guess we're going to have to pray together this morning. We'll have 900 on that side praying and I'll stand up here and pray with you. Amen. We want to remember the Green family. As you know, Brother Albert Green went home to be with the Lord this past January. Today, his wife, Sister Elizabeth Green, suffered a stroke, and at this point, she is paralyzed on her left side and her speech is slurred. The doctors have given her some some new medication which is supposed to lessen the severity of the effects, but they're asking that the saints would pray for her in this time of need. That's sent in by brother Joe Green. We want to remember Sister Hazel Gerald's in Florida. This is from Sister Leverne Clemens. She is having a second surgery to unblock the artery on the other side of her neck. That'll be on March 24th. [Music] We want to remember Sister Cliff and Heather. I believe it's Karpon in Saskatoon. Sister Heather is 5 months pregnant and was told that the baby had spina spina bifida. And we're asking that the saints would pray for her this morning that all would be well. [Music] I can't pronounce this last name, but I believe it's from Gina Marie. I'm asking that the brothers and sisters pray for me and my family. Lived in Congo uh back in 1999. Asked that God would help them and help their family. join them in prayer. Brother Curtis Walman wants us to pray for sister Melissa as she is at home this morning with pneumonia. Ask that the Lord would grant her a healing touch. Amen. I believe that we can enter into the burdens of the needs that we have before us this morning. Lift them up before the throne of grace. Amen. If you have a need upon your own heart, why don't you lift it up before him as we go to prayer with every head bowed and every eye closed, our hearts are borne up before you this morning, Father. Lord, we stand in your august presence, Jesus. Lord, knowing that you are the great creator of heavens and earth and you said there shall be a light in the evening time. Father, we believe that we are standing at the very brink of the coming of the Lord. Father, when you would come and catch your waiting bride away, Lord, there is an action that goes with the waiting portion. Father, Lord, we believe that we are waiting this morning with a great anticipation upon our hearts, Father. Lord, for what you would do even this morning in the very sanctuary of your people, Lord, we've come to a safe place, Father. Lord, we know in the Old Testament that where one would have found a fault with another, Lord, there was a place where they could go and hide. Lord, they could go and bear up their petitions before the judge, the high priest. Lord, we come this morning, Lord, knowing that we have found that sanctuary, that haven of rest this morning. Father, we plead the blood of Jesus Christ this morning, Lord, for these needs that we have read out before you, Father. Surely they were penned down in faith, believing that there would be a body of people that would pray over them, Lord. That hands would be raised, that mouths would be opened, that hearts would be believing this morning, that you, the great God of glory, would look down through the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary that is sufficient for us this morning. that you would have mercy and your grace would be extended once again to a believer in need. Oh God, Lord, we are asking for thine divine will and way in our presence, Lord. Lord, even this morning we think of our pastor, Lord. Lord, surely there is a great burden upon his heart, Lord, for the lost in the many years that he has labored over this pulpit. the many seats that have been filled in this sanctuary this morning. Lord, would you deliver the bound? Would you free, Lord, those that would be in prison this morning? Would you lift up the brokenhearted this morning, Father? Would you raise our eyes, oh God, above the realm of these three dimensions that we're in, Lord? And may we cast our eyes &gt;&gt; into that unseen dimension. We love you this morning, Father. Oh, there's a joy in our hearts, Lord, for what we know that you are doing even now, Lord. Lord, where you are breaking us out of this realm of these tempestuous times that we find ourselves locked in. Lord, Lord, our eyes are being lifted up. Our spirits are being lifted up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, Father, do the unexpected this morning. Lord, each and every one of us, Father, have a great need of a closer walk with you. Truly, it's the desire of our hearts, Lord, to leave this world far behind us, to come into your courts, Lord, to never depart again. Lord, may we walk in the reality of that this morning. We give you praise, Lord, for the baptism that we had on Wednesday night, Father. Lord, for the baptisms that are surely coming today, Lord. Lord, we know that you are still moving, Father. Lord, there is still blood on the mercy seat for one more to come in, Father. Lord, we want to press into that mark of the high calling. We love you, Father. We truly want to give you the praise and the honor and the glory. Be mindful of each and every need this morning, Father. We thank you for being mindful of us, Lord. We commit this time to you now in the name of our precious Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's truly wonderful to us, isn't he? Amen. You may have your seats. We want to welcome all of those that are on the internet hookup with us this morning and on a telephone hookup and those that may see the service in the coming days ahead. We pray that this would be a blessed time &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. As it's going to be a blessed time for us. But the Lord is the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the I am." &gt;&gt; So that means what's good for right now is good for tomorrow. See, you could be joining the service a week from today and it's just as applicable &gt;&gt; as it is right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a special this morning. Um, so if the group will come that's going to be singing for us, we'd certainly appreciate that. We do have one announcement to let you know about. The choir will not have a practice today between services, so you can go and enjoy your full lunch break. How many would love to just stay in the presence of the Lord, ask the Lord to take away our appetites and dismiss us from actually having to hang on to this coat of flesh that we have and maybe just spend a whole day in his presence. Wouldn't that be wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we're speaking it, so it's going to have to come into reality. We may have to get disappointed and not enjoy it today, but I believe there will be a time &gt;&gt; when that's what we'll get to enjoy. Amen. God bless you this morning. [Music] His [Music] heart was broken. Mine was mended. He became sin. Now I am clean. The cross he carried bore my burden. The nails that held him set me free. His life for mine. His life for mine. [Music] How could it ever be that he would die? God's son would die [Music] to save a rich like me. What love divine. He gave his life for mine. [Music] His scars of suffering brought me healing. He spilled his blood to fill my soul. His crown of thorns made me royalty. His sorrow gave me joy and told his life for mine. His life for mine. How could it ever be that he would die? God's son would die to save a rich like what love divine. He gave his life for he was despised and rejected stripped off his garment and oppressed. I am love and accepted and I will his life for his life for [Music] how it be that he would God s [Music] to save our rich like what love divine he gave his life for [Music] Amen. What do we have? Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that special. &gt;&gt; He died for you. &gt;&gt; He died for me. I don't know if we know that song. Why don't we sing? He play We Place You in the Highest Place. We invite Brother Ed to come this morning. Take his liberty. Amen. We have the whole day. It's the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, we place you [Music] in the highest place [Music] &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; You are the great high priest of our confession, Father. &gt;&gt; We place you. &gt;&gt; We place you high above all else. all and we just want to worship this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, just just say to his feet, hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. We place you in the highest place for you. For you high we praise you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh, we we come to you this morning, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. [Music] We bless you in the highest place. Oh, you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] to worship. Let's all stand this morning and raise it as an end of now. Oh, we praise you in the highest place. [Applause] You [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't he marvelous? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; How wonderful you are, Lord. &gt;&gt; Worthy of all of our praise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Worthy. Worthy of all of our praise. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; how privileged we are to come into his presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; He must have something special in store for you. We just open our hearts now. Say, "Here I am, Lord. Just before coming out, I thought, oh God, how great you are. I'm overwhelmed with your greatness and I'm overwhelmed with my insignificance. To think that God could send this little speck of dust called the earth out into the great great universe. And I try to capture in my mind this little piece of nothing that we're standing on. And then who are we? We're just a just a speck on the earth. And how the prophet would say we're walking and treading on the brittle threads of life. Oh God, how great thou art. And to think that he would accept praise from us today. He could have created beings that had never known any darkness, never known the depths of sin and unbelief and hard hearts and stiff necks and a wayward people. He could have created a people that would have just praised him forever. But then he would never been known as a savior and he just had such a such a desire within himself. I must be known as a savior, a redeemer. How great &gt;&gt; to pick up sinners like us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how great he is. &gt;&gt; When we're overwhelmed with our insignificance and we're overwhelmed with our weakness and our frailties, we think how great thou art that you could I thought of that old song. We're not going to sing it, but that God should love a sinner such as I. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let my lips ever be ready to praise his name and magnify him. Mighty deliverer. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We're real thankful. Uh thanking him for what he's doing each day. I know many of you in the church prayed for Sister Amanda Snow. And I don't know is uh Brother Randy, Sister Lori here. I see you back there. All right. I just thought it was just really marvelous. I don't have the email right here, but Sister Amanda had a growth on her hand. And many of you don't know, but Sister Amanda came through leukemia. and then and then uh been free from that and ended up with this growth on their hand going down to Seattle to the best specialist and they've examined it. They want to remove it and so they did remove it. When they removed it, the specialist said he was troubled, perplexed. He said, "We must examine this immediately. going to send it for a biopsy immediately. It I'm very suspicious, he said. Very suspicious. He said, "It's not leukemia and it's not Hodkins, but I'm very suspicious and so I want you back right away." and they sent the uh what they removed to the pathologist and we had prayed and sister Lori and brother Randy and we'd prayed together and they had said we're just going to believe that the doctors will be baffled and that stuck in my heart and so then I made that part of my prayer let them be baffled so they when they said well we don't know what it is but we're very suspicious and they called and they said we're the specialist called brother Randy Sister Lori and said that uh the pathologist has gotten back to her and said I haven't got time to uh time yet to write you the full pathology report but you free to call the Snow family and tell them that it's completely benign. There's nothing there. I say they were baffled and we are amazed &gt;&gt; at God's goodness and his greatness to us. We were saddened this last week and and also shocked to hear that our brother Wolf Ram Hornshade from uh Narramata lost his life. Uh, apparently it's in the newspaper also the province, but he was on his quad and we do not know what happened, but he something they said his quad turned over and uh, Brother Hornshade, he lost his life in that accident and a hiker found him. Apparently it happened on Wednesday and his daughter Claudia from who lives in Germany. She's the last remaining child. They had one other daughter who lost her life also when she was a young girl. And Claudia remains Claudia was here just last year when brother Tomok service for her mother and brother Wolf Ram's wife. And so she has just arrived, I believe, last night and now is is uh making her way to Narramata. And we will be making an announcement as soon as we have the information of where a service may be and what time it is. Um, I think that we as a congregation that was our sister or our daughter, whatever, she's we know nothing of her spiritual state and that's irrelevant right now. We pray that God will be with her and speak to her and I want to have that prayer for Sister Claudia, the group that sang he gave his life for mine. I really appreciated that &gt;&gt; and we're here and God gave his life for her as well &gt;&gt; and we're we're thankful for those of you that had an opportunity in the last few weeks. Brother Wolf Ram was able to be here and mingle with you and have visit with quite a number of people and now he has crossed over and uh so we want to pray for Claudia as well and give thanks for Amanda. We're going to be coming to the word right away. If you would bow with me, I would like to join with you in prayer. our almighty God and father who sent forth Jesus Christ as a redeemer for us. And oh, how we needed him. Oh, how I needed him, Lord. If no one else needed him, how I needed you. And I'm so thankful you remembered us, Lord, and remembered me in our need, Lord, and my need. Lord, I sense uh just a spirit of thankfulness within the people. A holy presence and a holy hush has has hovered over the people. And this presence, your presence seems now to be penetrating us. And we are here, oh God, in your presence, not knowing just exactly what you would do throughout this day. But we want to say we are here and we are prepared to hear your words. We have come as our brother Derek has led us in worship and truly are not only our lips Lord but in our hearts and souls. There is a rising tide of thanksgiving to the almighty God that you have taken us from where we were in such darkness and shadows and chains. And Lord, while I pray, there may still be someone here today, someone on the internet, in their room, or wherever they may be gathered. And there may be there, Lord, with confusion in a state of mind and turmoil, oh God. And someone here may have changed yet around them and bound. We want to announce to them, oh God, that in the name of Jesus Christ, you were you came into the world to not only redeem but to deliver. And we announce, oh God, that Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; And the serpent's head has been crushed. And the Son of Man has been revealed. And the word has been declared and made open. Lord, we thank you for these things. And now, Lord, we stand here in your presence at our post of duty. I want to thank you for what you're doing. And now, anoint us, oh God. Anoint the people to hear. Anoint me to speak and be with us throughout this day in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may take your Bibles if you would please. And I'll have you turn to John's Gospel the third chapter. And we're having baptismal right after the service. Right after the preaching, I should say, not after the service. Part of the service. I tell you, I'm rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Over this baptismal we're having today. I'm so rejoicing, I'm going to do it myself. &gt;&gt; We often have some of the other brothers and do the baptism. Brother Tom does a lot of it. So, we want to get directly to the word. John in the third chapter, we'll start to read it. Verse 25. Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou beest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. And John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven. Ye yourselves bear witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoicth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase but I must decrease. &gt;&gt; And we'll cease reading there. God bless you as you have your seats. Thank you for standing. That is my title to the message. He must increase. You can think about that. He must increase. Now increase is a law of the earth. Increase is an essential part of even our human nature and man's nature. Increase is a law that's in the seed. For God spoke those words that the the life would be in the seed and the seeds were planted in Genesis. We can find all the seeds of everything that you see today. And I believe that we are in a harvest period. We're in a harvest period. &gt;&gt; And we're seeing a lot of things today. And if you look back, they're actually planted in in Genesis. In the creation, God commanded the earth to bring forth. And he said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. It's going to happen. He must increase. &gt;&gt; You might say, well, I feel weak and I feel a failure and I feel this. That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; What what cannot fail is this word. &gt;&gt; It cannot fail. What God has spoken will happen, &gt;&gt; will take place. It will bring forth. And he said, "Let the earth bring forth." And the Hebrew here for this instance is let it sprout. Let it cause to shoot forth. Let it grow. Let it bring forth. And then when God spoke to Adam, he said, "And God blessed them." And this is Genesis 1:22. Eve has not come forth yet, but it says that God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and uh I'm sorry, uh John 1:22, he's speaking to the waters and fill the waters, fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth." And that was so. and this time be fruitful to bear and to branch off. And I'll read the I'll read the scripture that I want to read now in in uh Genesis 1 and also 26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, and the image of God created he them. Male and female created he them. And God blessed them and said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." And this multiply is now to become great, become many, become numerous, to make and enlarge and increase and increase greatly, increase exceedingly multiply. And we know that after the fall, then God addressed Eve. And he said unto the woman, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, and in sorrow thou shalt bring forth. Jesus said the time would come when they would even say, "Blessed are the paps that have not given suck, and the wombs that have not bear." that time would come. I present to you an article and this is from the United Nations I believe statistics. It has just taken 12 years for the world to add this most recent billion people. 12 years. This is the shortest time in world history for a billion people to be added. The United Nations estimated that the world reached the 6 billion mark on October the 12th, 1999. And it was a historic milestone in the growth of the world population. That was a milestone. I have a reason for it. The marking of a world at six billion just at the dawn of a new millennium is a convergence of events that is attracting widespread world attention. During this century, the world increased 1.65 billion people in just this century. I can I can tell you there's been a vast multiplication. And I took I won't go into it now but I took the population from 1900 just in this last century and the population the increase and it was very very dramatic. December the 30th, 205, the US Census Bureau projected the January 1, 206 population of United States will be 297,821,120 175 and that is up 2,713,000 and so on percent from New Year's Day 205. That's been the kind of increase. In January, the United States is expected to register one birth every 8 seconds and one death every 12 seconds. And meanwhile, the net international migration is expected to add one person every 31 seconds. The result is an increase in the total population of one person every 14 seconds in the United States. So every 14 seconds from the time we start this service to the time we end this meeting there will be quite a net increase in the population of United States. And of course that doesn't say anything for the rest of the world. This is a time of increase. It is a time of harvest. And the Bible speaks frequently about the end times, the last days, and many different types of references to this time that we're in, and that things would increase. And I'm I want to think about that increase because I'm not just talking about population. Far be it today. With the increase of mankind, so does everything that man brings with him increases. Sin, sickness, disease, greed, hatred, war, fightings, violence, crime, lust, and on and on. And if man multiplies and populations multiply, it only stands to reason it all multiplies. &gt;&gt; And another thing of course we have today is we have instantaneous media. It happens across the continents and across the seas and we hear about it in seconds. So our so those that perhaps even are not involved, those that are believers, a believer who does not feel at home in this world is bombarded from every direction &gt;&gt; by word of mouth or by telephone and by radio or by media or by your computer and the internet and whatever more. It's just bombarded from every direction. And we can't say it doesn't have an effect because it does have an effect &gt;&gt; and we're living in a harvest time. There's no one else in the history of mankind from Adam and Eve who walked in the garden. No one has had to face what we are facing today. And it's a reality. It's a real world. That's where we live. And these are the conditions. And I felt I needed to say to the congregation, and I probably can't say it all now, but these things are going to increase even beyond today. &gt;&gt; These conditions are going to increase. Now, even in the perfection of Eden, as it was, the serpent, that cunning beast who was inspired and taken control of by Satan himself, who'd been cast from heaven to the earth after war there, and now he's in the earth. He has the audacity to say to Eve in that perfection, you've been given a commandment to multiply, but I can show you how I can tell you what to do with this seed. He said the serpent and the serpent seed, the serpent was twice as smart. Now there she is in that perfection. But he is he is going to instruct her how she can increase her knowledge. And he says the serpent was twice as smart. His seed has always been twice as smart. And today where is your great intellectuals? Your pastor that's gone down and got a lot of intellectual knowledge and he stands up. He's the pastor of the biggest churches there is in the country and so forth like that. Where does the seed of the serpent staying at? Where are they staying at? He said in the smart and intelligent places like that, smart, shrewd scholars. He says there's where he's at. There's where he lays. Not by power, not by might, but by my spirit, sayith the Lord. And in Satan's Eden, he goes on, "Whatever he said would take place, he said it would happen in these last days that he would do certain things and he done it. He has to he has to ask nobody whether it's time or not." He knows what the time is and what the plan is. God knows what the time is, what the plan is. He says, "Now Satan, this deceiver, as spoke of in Matthew 24:24, with so much deceit, and now we find that by his gospel program of knowledge and better education, whose gospel? The Satan's gospel program with more knowledge and better education and higher ethics and civilization and so forth has bewitched the people that wants to serve God. He's bewitched the people who wants to serve God into believing his lie. Eve did not want to do that, but he showed her how it was more wisdom in it. They had been told, "Multiply and bring forth." And he's going to show her where there's more wisdom. He says, "Listen closely now." She didn't know. She didn't know what he was going to tell her. She didn't know, but she wanted to know. She didn't understand, but she wanted to understand. And God told her not to try to understand. How can I understand any of these things? I cannot understand them. I believe them. I don't have to understand them. God is faith not understanding. &gt;&gt; He said we just believe what he said. &gt;&gt; I want to say one of the greatest travesties against mankind that Satan has perpetrated upon the earth is that he has taken this seed. You have to wait and sit quiet now. He's a listen. He has taken this seed to show the church, the woman that how she can and how he can give her more wisdom by handling this seed and how it can be done in a better way and has brought upon the earth. Well, brother Brandham talked about denominationalism for I mean the the church world. I trust that everyone on the internet understands religion is one of the greatest curses &gt;&gt; that has ever befell humanity. &gt;&gt; Wars come out of religion. &gt;&gt; Wars are fought regularly and they're religious wars &gt;&gt; and Satan has done it. &gt;&gt; And what is the whole religious system all based on? They would say they would all take the Bible in hand. But it is the same serpent from Eden that is taken now not the seed of the serpent but this seed to pervert it &gt;&gt; and cause the people to believe a lie &gt;&gt; and be damned by it. I would say that the religious world as a whole is responsible for terrible crimes against humanity. &gt;&gt; The religious wars are of the worst kind. And unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. He said, you will bring forth children. You will bear, bring forth, you will beg, you'll travail of childbirth. It speaks of that. Now the scripture text which I took just hold those things which we've said thus far. He must increase. And John says and I must decrease. He must increase. He must augment. He must become greater. He must he must grow in quantity and in number. Now the bride will be very very few. But in uh if we think of the uh entire scope of the population of the earth, it will be very very few. And you know, I just want to say something to you as believers and perhaps I'd like to speak on this one day. I I'm I feel drawn to do so and with the Lord to give me a release to do so. But you know as as believers uh we may go into a place like it was just down in Phoenix and you go to Tucson and wherever so on. You go overseas in Africa or wherever and say well these folks believe this and these believe that and so on and so forth. But you know, if you took the message and what the and what God actually made revealed and made open in the message, the Godhead has never been understood like the prophet declared it. And if you just said to believers everywhere, how do you see the Godhead? They say it's like the prophet of God brought it. the serpent seed, the baptism, the the the church not going through the tribulation, the rapture, and you take all these major doctrines and you could take and overlay that over I would say probably 99% of the believers and they would say that's what we believe and that's really what we need to say. And some say, well, how's he going to come? Or when's he going to come? Or, you know, how many angels can stand on the head of a pin? And uh, you know, is it in a cloud or is it on a white horse? Or is it this or is we all have our ideas and we all have thoughts about questions which he didn't declare. And then some want to take their own personal little thoughts and make a doctrine on it. And and uh and then the thing finally fritters out and dies. and and uh and and I can I can say it very very clearly many of those things are actually built around a man &gt;&gt; and eventually it passes off the scene because it isn't something that actually came as a revelation from the message itself. It was a personal idea, a personal thought and it was presented maybe in a very very powerful way and and there are men that got powerful ministries and whatever more. But when that is all gone and I want you to think about something prophet of God said when Moses went in behind the veil and got the word he said no other person. He said Moses and Moses alone to try to go back and get that. And what's he doing? getting the revelation and bringing it out to the people. He said, "And there was no one else could go. The prophet and the prophet alone was the one that could go and get it and bring it out and anyone else try to go back and say, I got something. I got something." The penalty was death. It just it thing died out. I'm sorry folks, but it has all kinds of things died out. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I get sometimes email as I did this last week from over and says, "Oh, this certain doctrine is oh, it's just coming up over here." I said, "Just tell them we don't even hear it over here. That thing died 20 years ago." But they always try to find some new territory, you know, to get this going. And was it seven thunders? And I got to Africa, they said, "Is it we we got over here, we want to know, is it seven black thunders or is it seven white thunders?" Is isn't that something? And then all a lot of ministers got around and uh all our they were all black pastors in at Cape Town and asked me, you know, would would you come to a meeting? We want to, you know, ask you some questions and so on. And so we we sat down and those brothers, I love them. My goodness, we had so many meetings with them. And and they said, "We have a question." They said, "No." And they had just heard about some things. And so they said, "Brother Biscll," and they felt a little bit nervous, you know, they said, "Now about the seven thunders, like they were treading on some explosive ground." They said, "What what do you think about the seven thunders?" I said, "Well," I said, "Brother Brandham said what it was." He was asked that very question in the seals. &gt;&gt; They said, "What about the seven thunders?" And he said it is the that's what the seals were all about. &gt;&gt; It was the voices behind the seals. So I said next question. &gt;&gt; Well, they thought this was going to be a discussion for the rest of the day. I was done. And when I just gave that answer, they were done. But they hadn't expected the meeting to end so quickly. You know, and people want to make, you know, this is something very special. And now we only have a very very few. just an elect. Out of the elect becomes they become the very elect. Who doesn't want to be very elect? I want to be very elect. We all want to be very elect. So suddenly we got now a little group within the group. &gt;&gt; But it's not it's not the doctrine of the message itself. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That was just an option. He must increase. He must grow in quantity or number or supply or or multiply and to cause to grow or to cause to become greater. Now I want to go to a quote just out of the out of the uh Leodysian church age message. Brother Brandham said based on the seven visions which he had along with the rapid changes which have swept the world in the last day in the last 50 years. I predict I do not prophesy that these visions will have all come to pass by 1977. And though many feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that Jesus said that no man knoweth the day nor the hour, I still maintain this prediction after 30 years because Jesus did not say no man could know could know the year or the month or week in which his coming was to be completed. So I repeat, I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium. Now, now what he's talking about here is that God God's going to turn from the Gentiles and turn to the Jews. Now let's just take the flip side of the coin. Let's just go back for a moment. This is not the heart of my message at all, but I'm I I I gave this quote because he said along with the rapid changes. In other words, things are not only going to increase, but they're going to accelerate. &gt;&gt; So there's acceleration with the increase that is taking place. &gt;&gt; And so he said, now talking about 1977, the people in the world, they grab that right away. lay hold of that. &gt;&gt; Well, 1977, nothing happened. I'll tell you what, there was prophecies that were fulfilled when uh the scripture speaks of when Jesus would come and Jesus took those prophecies out of Daniel, brought them forward. He said, "When you see the desolation uh that spoken of by Daniel a prophet, then uh don't go back and get your things and flee to the flee to the mountains." What was he talking? Do you think those people after after Jesus was was slain and raised and the disciples already were in the upper room and the Holy Spirit was poured out and all kinds of things were happening? That prophecy was done and finished. It was it is it was already spoken. And then in in 70 AD, here comes Titus and destroys Jerusalem. Do you think that do you think how many Jews do you think in Israel today or across the face of the earth that actually believe that was fulfilled? Not very many. &gt;&gt; They don't believe it was fulfilled, but it was absolutely com fulfilled. And he says, when you see that, when you see that happen, then you'll know these things have come to pass. and they did come to pass. But the Jews who it was actually spoken to do not regard that it has happened. And the world went on. &gt;&gt; Absolutely were. And the key here, which many of you have heard me say it before, I'm going to say it again because there are many that are are probably new here and some that are listening. Brother Phantom says 1977 ought to he said I'm not prophesying but he says considering the rapid changes the acceleration that's taking place it ought to usher in and the word is usher in the millennium and an ushering in the millennium is ushering out the other age it's ushering out a gentile age ushering in the millennium them. I've had a lot of weddings. So, they'll say, "All right, uh, the bride is being ushered in. Where is she? Is she out in the parking lot just getting out of the car? Is she coming now with her attendance to the foyer of the church? Or is she in the foyer of the church? Where is she? Or is she at the door ready to come in? Where is it?" The ushering in is a process. And the prophet said it ought to usher in the millennium. And I would say with the messages which we've received and the and the word preached in its power, the bride is being ushered in &gt;&gt; to the millennium. &gt;&gt; I believe that's happening. &gt;&gt; I feel that's happening. &gt;&gt; I feel that it has been happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we're not being ushered into the millennium, friends, where are we being ushered into? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just one thing, the change of our bodies. And a lot of people, a lot of people believe in the change of the body, but they don't have the rest of the process. The rest of the process is that God would send a forerunner. Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and the terrible day of the Lord. The terrible day is his judgment day. Before the judgment day, a messenger will come. Restore the word back to the people. What for? To call a bride out. Come out from among her. Um come out from among them and be separate, said the Lord. And part of that calling part of that calling is a preparing of people for the change. &gt;&gt; People are expecting the change, but they're not they're not even they're not even willing to accept the preparation. How about the girl just say, "Well, you know, yeah, I'm uh I I've got the potentials to be a bride. Let me just walk in there." No, no. We want you to be ready. You need to get a dress. You need to get your hair fixed. We need to make some arrangements. We need to send out an invitation. We've got to get the people ready. You know, this is a big do. &gt;&gt; But a lot of them just want to go, "No, I just go in the way I am." you know, uh, you know, my preacher preaches something and I I I I believe it and we go to church for an hour and and we're all set. No, no, no, no, not at all. &gt;&gt; Fact is, as as believers of this message, I think we need to hear a lot more word than we're even hearing now. &gt;&gt; The rapid changes in the last few days. Now, we're talking about the rapid changes. Don't get slack, friends. the rapid changes in the last few days of the life of Jesus Christ on earth. Brother Brandham says an inunement. Notice Jesus in the last hour or two of his life. Many many prophecies were fulfilled. Someone said to me, "Brother Brandham, this this has to happen and that has to happen." And I said, "It could happen in an hour." If you'll read the 22nd of Psalm and and then watch his dying hour of the cross, he said, "I forgot how many outstanding prophecies were fulfilled in the last two or three hours of his life. They pierced my hands and my feet. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And so forth, David cried. Well, I I looked into it. There are 10 prophecies concerning the birth of Jesus. 10 prophecies of the Old Testament concerning the birth of Jesus that were fulfilled at the time of his birth. Nine prophecies concerning his nature. There are eight prophecies concerning his entire ministry from the Old Testament that were fulfilled in his entire ministry of three and a half years. There are 29 prophecies that were fulfilled the day he died. &gt;&gt; What are we saying? There can be a few prophecies that are that have to do with us as a bride and as a believer as believers in this end time. There are some there's some prophecies concerning it. But the prophecies are things that people think need to be done could be done in just a few moments. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In fact is between now and this evening's meeting it could all happen. &gt;&gt; We know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; We may not be aware of it happening. And there were those Jews and scholars of the word and men who had studied the Torah and men who that was their whole life from morning till night. And did they know it? Did they know it? They read the psalms. They sang the psalms. And the prophet said they were singing them in the temple when he was hanging on the cross. &gt;&gt; They were singing the prophecies and they were already being fulfilled one after the other just like a triphammer. &gt;&gt; And here they are waiting and they're still waiting. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later they're still waiting. And we can say, "I thought Elijah was supposed to come." Sorry, folks. That's already happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Already happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elijah came. Elisha came. John the Baptist came. William Brandon came. It's the same identical spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. We didn't say he's going to forrun the second coming of Christ. The angel of the Lord said it. &gt;&gt; The voice spoke it. And those who were standing on the riverbank, they heard it. &gt;&gt; We don't have to declare it. We don't have to support it. Thus say the Lord. It has already happened. &gt;&gt; And people waiting for Malachi 4, it's gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's passed off. It's gone into the eternities. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, well, it's going to happen and try to get, you know, and minutely dissect this and put this together in the 1977 and all the rest of it. I tell you what, if a prophet with his record and speaking the truth and said, "I predict, I don't prophesy, I sooner go with his prediction than anybody else figuring out." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then he said he said when there was a blackout on the west coast on the east coast rather and he said and there be more when was the next great one was the n July the seventh month the seventh day I believe it was of July at 1977 the whole east coast blacked off &gt;&gt; and his last message to New York was once more and the time magazine the time magazine Time magazine reports on the July and the front cover is the skyline just black because there's nothing there. There's not a light. The total skyline of New York City. And the that same prophet said there'll be insanity in the streets. And then they have a colored picture pasted in the middle of the hordes of people running like maniacs down the street and smashing the windows and and stealing all the stuff out of the stores and it's total chaos. &gt;&gt; And the prophet and the people are in the meeting. He's preached to New York once more, Lord. &gt;&gt; And when he left, he waved. It was a goodbye. That spirit of God &gt;&gt; that was in him &gt;&gt; knew that was it. &gt;&gt; What does the New York City know about that? Very little. &gt;&gt; But the believers of the message know a great deal about it. &gt;&gt; They catch a little glimpse here and catch a little glimpse there. And I say, "Thank God for the grace of God. Thank God for the vision that we do have. A lot of things maybe we don't know, but there's a lot, but we do know." Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know enough to be alert, &gt;&gt; to be on our toes, to be ready for we know not the hour. Hallelujah. That sweep come over and change the atoms of our bodies. &gt;&gt; How's it going to happen? I don't know and I don't care. &gt;&gt; He said it and it will happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Harvest time is a in gathering time and it's a separating time. Chaff from wheat. This is all an increase time and we have to expect those things. Harvest time is when everything that has been spoken of with the spoken word is in multiplied state. In other words, the words that were spoken have increased. And we could say that the word increased in its intensity in it in its speed, its acceleration. Say things are happening so fast today friends. I doubt if anybody would want to stand up here and say I can comprehend the speed of things that are happening and the technology. We are in the day of knowledge. &gt;&gt; It was Eve in the beginning. that first seed that that serpent offered to give her knowledge and what he gave her was carnal knowledge. And today we have knowledge. Look at the sex industry. Look at the sex industry. If you get down and it's too degraded to speak of over this pulpit, but being propagated, they just broke. My wife told me when they came back, she said, "They just broke some ring cuz I haven't heard it and I don't want to hear about it." But they this child pornography. I tell you what, the world is quickly getting ready for the burning &gt;&gt; and it deserves the burning. &gt;&gt; We're sitting here protected, but these happen to be realities. &gt;&gt; This what taking place and my wife said this huge ring and people all over the world and a good part of it right in Canada, you know, our our fair cities and our church cities and our religious cities. kaibos &gt;&gt; demonic. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. &gt;&gt; And our young people, they're not immune or they're not ignorant of these things. They know these things happen. &gt;&gt; And even down to a child 18 months old. It's a good thing for that man that I'm not God &gt;&gt; cuz he wouldn't have life &gt;&gt; another second &gt;&gt; and he'd go off into some abyss of darkness &gt;&gt; never to be found again. &gt;&gt; We haven't got we haven't got any patience for that kind of thing. But that's the world that that we're in. And things are intensifying and increasing. &gt;&gt; And yes, they find it behind the pulpit. They find it amongst the ministry and amongst the priesthood and all. And Satan knows no barriers. You're not afraid of those walls, not afraid of those doors, not afraid of anything, not afraid of your house. &gt;&gt; He'll invade anywhere. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the covering of the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that we can implement it and we can apply it and it's available to us and we should never never tire or become weary of saying thank God &gt;&gt; for the word that we have received and for the protection that we have in this hour because these things are not going to diminish. You think the law is going to control them? Not a chance. &gt;&gt; You think the police are going to control it or the government going to control it? Not a chance. and that serpent with his brazen uh uh spirit come in. If he'd come into the Eden and speak to the son of God and his wife and approach Eve, the very bride of the son of God, I tell you what, he knows no limits. &gt;&gt; The one that would say, "I will ascend to the throne of God." He knows no limits. And there's a people on the earth in the midst of this accelerated increase that's taking place. There's a people on the earth that's also been spoken by this messenger said that she will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; And I don't just sit back and take that as some light statement. I say that there is there is a the effective there is a uh there is a quality there is a strength that I'm of I'm able as a believer and I have a right to to absorb that strength there's a washing of the water of the word and it is access I can access it &gt;&gt; but if you just live a a lollipop life out there say I go to Cloverdale Bible I don't believe the man yeah send a prophet that won't protect you. But the word that was sent is effective and powerful and will save you from this untoward generation. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. You have to respect it. You have to apply it. You have to absorb it and let it permeate you. And it will do the work. The word will do the work. But you have to make yourself available. &gt;&gt; And there are other things you can do and that is slam the door on the devil. The scripture says resist the devil. That is a permanent active word. Resist him. When now, five minutes from now, an hour from now, today, tomorrow, this week, next week, this year, next year, you resist him. You resist him. And God gives you the fortitude and the spiritual stamina. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; To resist him. But if you don't, &gt;&gt; he's got more ideas. He's a slicker. &gt;&gt; He knows your weak spot. &gt;&gt; He knows how to creep in on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and see the discrepancy. He said, "And we also know and we also know he interpreted in verse 36 to 43." He's referring to a scripture how that this seed matured. And while we're at it, let's just read it also. And he reads some scripture. And here's one of the scriptures. As therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of the world. The Son of Man shall send forth his angels, his messengers, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a fire, a furnace of fire, and there shall be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. I just want to stop here. It's not part of my message as such, but I in my lifetime have heard people argue about whether God's going to send people into hell. And I've had people say, "God's not going to fry people and God's not going to send them into flames and God's not going to do this." And I've had others, you know, they say, "Well, hell is just uh uh hell is just uh you know, it's a place and they're going to it's not eternal." The prophet said it's not eternal. All I know is that's not all Jesus said. He said there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. He's not talking about a Sunday school picnic. &gt;&gt; And then men get all down and start to, you know, get intricate with, you know, what hell is all about. All I can tell you, hell is not where you want to go. &gt;&gt; There is weeping out of the lips of Jesus. There is wailing. What is wailing? Wailing is when there's no words left. &gt;&gt; All the wailing can do is is is give vent and give voice and give a groaning unintelligible groaning for what an agony it's gone through that they've missed God. I can think of the weeping and wailing some of those people and probably most of them are going to remember. You know, I had an opportunity. God actually dealt with me. I heard a service. I was to a youth camp. I was someplace else. I had a mother or father. I had an uncle or a grandpa. Somebody told me and I did not take it. I sat in church and I didn't I didn't take it serious. And here I am. And there's weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth &gt;&gt; cuz I had the opportunity. I say, God, drive it down in our hearts. Now, I'm preaching for all I can this morning. &gt;&gt; We're preaching to save souls &gt;&gt; from that place. &gt;&gt; Yes. And there'll be people who sit back and say, "Well, I believe in predestination. I don't need that." Yeah. There's going to be people, I guarantee you, I guarantee you in the name of the Lord, there's going to be people who's going to be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. Who's going to said, "Well, you know, I what about predestination? And I thought about predestination. I said, "What happens about predestination?" All I know Jesus spent more time talking about hell than he talked about heaven. &gt;&gt; And he talked about hell. And if anybody knew anything about predestination, Jesus knew it better than anybody here or anybody under the sound of my voice or anybody who's ever come into the message, Jesus knew more about predestination. And we're supposed to live according to the mandate and the word that we hear now how I came upon these thoughts. Brother Bram talks about the seed of discrepancy and he says this Jesus give interpretation to the parable. says, "And then I believe that Jesus was speaking this parable in his day, but was meaning it to be at this end of the world or the end of the age, the end of the age." Here's Malachi 4 speaking now. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Which is this day?" &gt;&gt; Hello, folks. You are living in the end of the age, &gt;&gt; the end time &gt;&gt; when all the things that have been prophesied are coming upon the end. Is the clocks going to stop and everybody in the world and all the industry stop? No. It's going to carry right on. &gt;&gt; But the availability of mercy, the availability of the grace of God is not only going to diminish, it's going to be shut off. &gt;&gt; The tap is going to be shut off. God turned from the Jews. Do you think in the last two the two 2,000 years, do you think for a moment I would say the people that has probably done as a nation the most weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth has been the nation of Israel. &gt;&gt; They have suffered in in indescribable &gt;&gt; things. Not only in one country, not only in the last war for 2,000 years they've suffered it. They've been scattered over the earth. They've been well, you know what has happened. And he said, "That's this day." And I believe that this little text tonight is very appropriate for the hour that we're living in because Jesus distinctly said here that the gathering would be at the end of this world. And that's when the end would be the gathering of the wheat and also the gathering of the tears for the burning. And you that are seated here, even if you're younger, you are actually living &gt;&gt; when that gathering is taking place and has taken place. &gt;&gt; And the great organizations have been gathered together, gathered for a burning. &gt;&gt; Someone might say, "What is the burning?" I don't know and I don't care. I don't want to be in it. &gt;&gt; We don't have to get down and get, you know, finickity about what does this mean and what does that mean. It's very clear. It's something to be away from. &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; The seed of discrepancy. And he goes on to say, he says the seed of discrepancy because that's something that multiplies in the end time. Jesus said that the two would be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible. And he goes on to say almost exactly the same. &gt;&gt; It's not as though something's going to be way out there and oh that is you know hey that's not even on the same planet with the believers &gt;&gt; with his believers. That's not that's not what Jesus talking about. It's going to be so close almost exactly the same. And you might say this morning, "Oh, just a second, brother Ed. You're bringing that down to a very fine point." And so it is &gt;&gt; in the harvest time. &gt;&gt; I've seen all kinds of people who've professed this message. &gt;&gt; And here we are with a nice audience of people this morning, a few hundred people. I'm going to tell you and I I I'm not doubting is but I I said this to my wife and I believe it. If we had a severe persecution, a severe persecution come upon this church and some were thrown in prisons and some were beaten and and and uh and you were offered to deny, I can tell you the deacons wouldn't have any trouble seating people &gt;&gt; by the next Sunday. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, don't you have confidence in me?" I do. &gt;&gt; But I remember what happened in Malawi would have about 600 people and they threw they threw about 90 of them in prison. And brother, the pastor, brother Kandogi told me when they came back and got out of prison, there was just a handful of people left &gt;&gt; because when they saw that kind of persecution, they fled. What am I saying this for? You You might be asking, "What are you saying this for?" You better know you're calling an election that it's sure. &gt;&gt; And you're not about to be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that's all right for you, brother Bisco. You're up over the hump and you're there. You got your white hair and all the rest of it." I had I I was stronger probably at 18 than I am today. I was absolutely fanatic. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have a radio in my car. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I ordered a new car and I had a second new car and I refused to have a radio in either one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We never got a newspaper. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; had nothing to do with the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you're here for. &gt;&gt; The further we get from the world, the better we are. &gt;&gt; And he's cunning. He'll come not not just under your door, the crack of the door. He'll come in. He'll do anything he can and he use every medium possible &gt;&gt; to get in. &gt;&gt; I say slam the door on him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Resist him. &gt;&gt; Shut him down. &gt;&gt; You don't only have a right. It's not you. It's not you that has the power. The message that you're absorbing has the power. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't have a whole lot of time, but I'm I want you to turn to second Timothy the uh third chapter. This is a chapter that's well known to us. speaks about the last days. Perilous times will come. But while you're looking at it, I want to read. I want to read from the amplified. And you may have a little difficulty just following along, but listen this closely. But understand this, that in the last days there will set in perilous times of great stress and trouble, hard to deal with and hard to bear and perilous. The word that Paul has used writing to Timothy which he called his son the actual word in the Greek is they are fierce times and they're hard to do to take. They're hard to take to approach. You don't know how to approach it. They're hard to bear. They're troublesome. They're dangerous. They're harsh fierce and savage. And you can just look at me for a moment now. But the second part of this perilous comes from a it's it's a compound word and it comes from a second word which is these are perilous times. Just listen closely now. Hard to deal with sometimes that we have a difficult time approaching something. They're they're troublesome. They're dangerous. They're harsh and they're fierce and they're savage. But that is because the second part of that is because there is a loosening or a slackening. There's a relaxing &gt;&gt; to let down from a higher place to a lower place. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that these days would be like the days of Noah. They prospered in Noah's day. They had he preached 120 years and only got a handful ate souls into the ark. &gt;&gt; What did those people thousands that heard Noah preach? The Bible says they were buying and selling and building and all. It's a time of economic. It's not our fault that things are the way they are. They are that way. We buy and we sell shell and we build and we move and we do all of these things which are a part of of life a part of life. But that is not that is not what guides us. That is not what is to control us. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because I can tell you with a with full assurance that prosperity tends towards relaxation &gt;&gt; and adversity tends towards more strengthening and stamina and determination. &gt;&gt; And so this is part of the last days. There's no preacher, and I certainly am not going to a preacher to stand up and browbeat the people because you're in a time of prosperity. You can't help it. &gt;&gt; But let it be known that that shall not relax you. &gt;&gt; Whether you only have $1,000 or $100 or $10 or a million dollars, none of those figures should have any bearing on your spiritual walk with God. &gt;&gt; It has it's irrelevant. Whatever it is, it must not dictate to you what your spiritual level is. &gt;&gt; But if your business starts to tell you you can't go to church, you don't have time to read the message. You don't hear it. You haven't got time to absorb and sit back and hear the voice of God. That's the time to resist the enemy and say, "Now you're trying to get at me through the very thing God gave me as a gift to provide me with a living. Now you're trying to control it. You're trying to make me its servant. I want you to know that I'm the master here. &gt;&gt; And families are torn up and the husband can't be around. The father's gone. The mother's gone. She's doing whatever. She's doing her studies or she's going places. She's got her clubs and got all the rest of it. And the man is going and the kids don't have the direction they're supposed to have. Are you with me? That's part of this Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And I have a lot of scriptures which I don't have time to give you. The scripture says that God said, "I'll bless you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you will prosper. &gt;&gt; But God never intended that the prosperity was going to call cause you to relax from the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us of David and who could have been more prospered than David. God gave him an everlasting king, kingdom, and a throne. And he dwelt in his luxury, but he cried out to God, "You're you're my breath. You're my life. You're everything. This marble doesn't mean anything to me. All of the glory means the gold means nothing to me. My soul thirsteth after the living God. &gt;&gt; But as a king, he had time to write psalms and to sing and had time to worship and had time to leave the entire mankind a heritage in the Psalms. He had time for that. &gt;&gt; You have to help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's going to be one of the most difficult things. It's harder to bear prosperity than it is to bear adversity. &gt;&gt; It's harder because it is more difficult to keep your balance &gt;&gt; and tell Satan, "Get in the corner. &gt;&gt; Get out of my life. Get out of my business. Get out of my home. I'm going to run things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when all of these things are gone and passed away, and they surely shall, Then where are we? &gt;&gt; We want to be rich in faith, &gt;&gt; rich in God, rich in the word, rich in our witness. We want to do everything we can to spread the gospel of the good news. We're not sitting in a little quiet corner relaxing, you know, and make a better living so I can have more relaxation, etc., etc. We're here to labor for the master from the dawn to setting sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, we'll go back. Let me read a little bit and then I'm going to close because we've got baptism right now. These are hard to deal with, hard to bear. Verse two, for people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered, lovers of money and aroused by an inordinate, greedy desire for wealth, proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters. They will be abusive, blasphemous scoffers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, and profane. They will be without natural a without natural human affection callous and inhuman. I want to stop there. I have never in my life ever in my wildest dream never believed I would ever live and see an age or a day. It was wasn't even in my not my it wasn't in my ability to conceive that I would arrive at a day and have to live in a day when parents can actually forsake and forget their own flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; And turn from them like they didn't even know them. &gt;&gt; I thought, my God. And I read that scripture. I've hung on to that through these years. without natural affection. The seeds were sown and now we have a harvest of it. &gt;&gt; And parents can leave their kids and forget them and as though they never knew them. Brought bring them into the world, their own flesh and their own blood and their own bones and forget the child. I have three daughters and I've actually had to pray, God, help me not to love them too much. I love them so deeply. I've told God, "Heaven's not heaven without them." &gt;&gt; And I have prayed, "If you have to save them and cast me away, But let them have heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's just there. &gt;&gt; You're not having to try to muster that up. &gt;&gt; And then how can that be? And then you have a world where it's increasing, increasing, increasing. People forget their children and couldn't care less about where they go or what happens to them. The seeds were sewn a long time ago. And listen, I have to tell you, it's going to increase. It's going to increase. It's going to get more and more. They will be without natural affection. Callous and inhuman. Relentless. Admitting of no truth. admitting of no truth or appeasement. They will be slanderers, false accusers, troublemakers, intemperant and loose in morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce, haters of good. They will be treacherous betrayers, rash and inflated with self-conceit. They will be lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than rather than lovers of God. For although they hold a form of piety, true religion, and now you can look up once again all of this that I just you think that is too terrible. That is just too vile. That is so wicked. That is so terrible. Those people you you may be thinking about the the gutter down on East Vancouver or wherever it may be in Seattle or these cities. No, it's not there. These people hold a piety of true religion &gt;&gt; and can put on that kind of a front. &gt;&gt; I tell you that the the actors in Hollywood got nothing on these people. And although they hold a form of piety, true religion, they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it. They conduct the their conduct belies the genuiness of the their profession because they profess true Christianity and avoid all such people. Here's the council of the word of God. turn away from them. &gt;&gt; And you even within the ranks of the message, you hear some uh subtle little thing. I tell you, it's so subtle. It's not out where they just say, "Oh, they deny. I don't believe that. I don't believe that." But it comes in just so subtle &gt;&gt; even amongst believers. comes in so subtle and maybe in just a in the way of a question, you know, and and and starts to destabilize your thought and you kind of begin to wonder, yeah, well, you know, maybe, you know, where am I? Where am I at? And so forth. I tell you what, you pick up on that spirit right away. &gt;&gt; You are informed. You're wise enough to know you pick up on that spirit and deny it &gt;&gt; and call it what it is. You say, "Well, the the sister looks like such a fine sister. The brother looks like such a fine brother, but your heart of hearts is witnessing that is sewing a seed of discrepancy. It's sewing a seed of doubt. And that enemy wants to divert me away from the company of the saints from the very place where I get my strength &gt;&gt; and send me off into some uh confusion and some dilemma. Deny him there &gt;&gt; right at that moment. Deny him. I call upon this congregation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to set your sights on the prize. &gt;&gt; Take this whole world. Take all of its prosperity. Take everything. But give me not only Jesus Christ, but give me all that he's promised for this day. &gt;&gt; What would we be availed, friends? What are we availed if we attain all of these things and attain attention and fame and and and all of this things that this this age offers? And does it ever offer a lot? It offers a lot. &gt;&gt; It offers grand things. Is there any sin in the grand thing? No. But there's more caution that must come with the life and the day that we're in. I wouldn't have to preach this in certain places where I've been in Africa, in India, in other places. I wouldn't have to preach this because it wouldn't even apply to them. &gt;&gt; But it does apply to us. &gt;&gt; It's a time when we have to be extremely careful and cautious. Amen. For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weak nurtured and spiritually dwarfed women loaded down with the burden of their sins or unbelief and easily swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses. These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them and they are forever. Let me stop there. I have found men in this day and in the so-called message so weak that their women almost have to teach them. &gt;&gt; Now that really become quiet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have counseledled with women even not so very long ago. said, "I need help because it seems that my husband gives me no spiritual leadership, no spiritual headship, and I and I I I'm getting out of my place. I have to try to counsel him." But the person that doesn't want counseling is the husband because he'd be intimidated. He doesn't want He doesn't want He doesn't want it to be known. Well, I'm let down. I've relaxed. I'm not really I'm not really being the example in the home. &gt;&gt; You're quiet now. &gt;&gt; There ought to be at least 50 60% of the men that could say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What what what does this message teach? It's not onto the women just because they're they're weak women and all the rest of it, but there's a lack of leadership &gt;&gt; and there needs to be leadership. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I'm into it. I might as well say it. &gt;&gt; Then they come and say, "Well, the preacher is not preaching it." No, that's not it. It's not being applied. It's being preached, but it's not being there's no application when it gets home. &gt;&gt; They want the preacher. Bring up the kids. &gt;&gt; Instruct us for our kids. You know, if we got a problem with our teenagers, it's a preacher's fault. No, it's not. There's no place here. Here, this is the word of God. I I don't have one scripture here. I don't have one place in the scripture where I have a mandate to bring up your children. &gt;&gt; You're the one that brought them into the world. And you're the one to instruct them. And you're the one to hear the word as it comes across the pulpit and take it home and apply it. &gt;&gt; That's a parent's job. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this day, we're in a we're in a harvest time &gt;&gt; where parents are letting go of those responsibilities and we must not do it. &gt;&gt; Help me. I'm trying to end. &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak your word on God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We receive it. &gt;&gt; We receive it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Our ears, our heart. It's open. says, "And they are forever getting information but are never able to arrive at a recognition and a knowledge of the truth." I have found him. I'm talking about the message. I'm not talking about denominations now. We don't we we're past that. I have found within the message, people are continually getting more information, more information. It's not information the person needs. It needs to be a revelation within your own soul. &gt;&gt; And a birth and you're done. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going through a hard time. Praise God. We all go through hard times. &gt;&gt; I'm having difficulty. I'm having temptation. The devil's on my case. He's on everybody's case. &gt;&gt; We're not here to whimper. &gt;&gt; We're here to stand up and be a soldier &gt;&gt; and fight this good fight of faith. And God is calling on us as a whole congregation to be exactly that. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word has given us exact details of how a wife and a woman should be, how young people should be, a young lady. We've got exactly &gt;&gt; what we should be doing, &gt;&gt; how to live, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; How to hold ourselves, maintain ourselves. You young ladies, don't become flooy and and uh uh and throw yourself out in in front of young men &gt;&gt; with a tantalizing dress and so on and so forth. And then someone says, "Well, uh uh you know, the sister in your church or this person, they wear a sweater that's too tight or they wear a heel that's too high and so on so forth." They need to listen to the word of God. It's not for me to go up and say your your your sweater's too tight or your heels are too high. You know what the word of God says? &gt;&gt; Just do it. &gt;&gt; And young man, the way that you're supposed to live, &gt;&gt; do it. &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God is calling for you to do. And once it's spoken, there is no excuse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and homes in the way that they should be and it's amazing absolutely amazing to me people if you have a business I've said it before I'm going to say it again I'm going to close if you had a business and you're running into difficulty and you say no just where will I consult who shall I consult with well what do you know yeah here's a fellow and his business has failed three times times and he's gone bankrupt and they've gone into chapter 11. They've gone into chapter 7 and they've gone bankrupt and they've liquidated their stuff and started all up and then they liquidated again and all the rest of I I think I'll go and take counsel from him. You've lost your marbles, friend. Right. &gt;&gt; And there's people just as silly, and I say silly with a reverent word, they will take counsel from somebody or they'll give ear and give allowance for somebody not married, &gt;&gt; don't have a wife, &gt;&gt; never had a child, &gt;&gt; never preached a sermon. &gt;&gt; God has never honored them by giving them a a sheep. &gt;&gt; They have zero witness. And then they'll sit there and open up both ears and hear what they have to say. I'll say, "You're on dangerous ground before God. You're on dangerous ground." &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have enough spiritual intelligence to say, "What has this fellow got to offer me? What has this woman got to offer me?" Zero. Zero. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is God the author of confusion? No. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, then I have I've wasted 40 years of my life more. Could have been having my feet up doing something easier. You think it's easy? People tell think going, you know, you go in a series of meetings. Oh, you only have three meetings in Phoenix. Yeah. And maybe 15 hours of counseling and praying for about 50 people individually, one after the other and instructing them. &gt;&gt; And when you're done, as I said to a few of you, I hardly knew my own name. And I mean that. I was so exhausted. Then you come home and you know you have a nice time in Phoenix. Yeah. Just just praying that God will give you enough strength for the next hour. &gt;&gt; Not enough strength to even go to a restaurant and want to eat. Just take me to a room and roll me over into a bed. This is labor, friends. &gt;&gt; It's a labor. &gt;&gt; If anybody indicates, well, we're here for a job. God have mercy on your soul. &gt;&gt; That's the last thing in the world. It's not a job. It's a burden of your heart. &gt;&gt; Could somebody pay you to be a mother? Pay you to be a father? &gt;&gt; Say that's a disgraceful statement. We're in it because we love &gt;&gt; the people. And I tell you what, friends, I thank you. I thank you for the a gallant the gallant spirit that I have been privileged by God. And that's what I consider. I consider you as a congregation. I'm so privileged that we can walk together &gt;&gt; and this is just a beginning &gt;&gt; because he is going to increase. &gt;&gt; This word that we have received is going to increase. You do not have to infuse good seed with life. It has its own life. &gt;&gt; And it has that life because the author, the creator said, "Bring forth." &gt;&gt; And it's done. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; God said it. You don't have to worry. You absorb the seed. You hear the word. And I tell you what, fellas, whether you're 15 or whether you're 50 or whether you're 70 or whatever age or sisters or home or family or whatever more, the life is in the seed &gt;&gt; and the power is in the seed to bring it forth. It already has it. You don't have to do it. &gt;&gt; It will do it. &gt;&gt; You have to make yourself available and then forget it. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Plant your seeds and forget it. If you go and dig it up and see how it's doing, you'll destroy it. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm having a hard time quitting. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, &gt;&gt; Satan also, he tries to get everybody to dig it up what you just heard. The seed just nicely gets buried and he says, you know, dig it out. Check it out and see. Maybe maybe you didn't see that right. Maybe you didn't hear right. you're always, you know, reviewing and re reassessing and going over it again and well, yeah, well, may maybe this, maybe that. No, bury it and forget it. &gt;&gt; And it's going to bring forth fruit. It's going to bring forth power. It's going to bring forth a washing. When you need a washing, it'll be there and wash you. When you need strength, it'll be there and give you strength. When you need a word, it'll be there and give you a word. &gt;&gt; Let him increase. And the scripture doesn't put the onus on you to make him increase. God didn't say, "I sow the seed, but you make sure it grows and you make sure it comes to a harvest." God didn't say that. God said in his word, he must increase. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he shall increase. &gt;&gt; You just believe it. You you put it in your heart and bury it and let it stay there and it'll bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let those that are going to be baptized go immediately and just be ready to be baptized. And brother Derek, you'll come and if you lead the people, I want to sing. I know in whom I've believed. Not so much for you that are sitting in the seats, but the two people we're going to baptize. We're going to baptize Lyall and Roger and Norin Keer's mother. And we're going to baptize Sister Diane Segman's husband, Claude, brother and sister Dodge's son-in-law. Hallelujah. Sister Sarah's father and Jason's father-in-law. We're going to baptize them. So, brother Derek and that's why I said because both of these have come very very slowly and patiently and you know a little step at a time. A little step at a time but sometime it took years brother Derek it took years. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it took so many years, you know, that every step they came to, they just want to make absolutely sure. And we'll say a little bit more when we get in the tank. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, shall we? Praise the Lord. [Applause] I know not by God's wondrous grace to me he have made known nor by worthy Christ in love redeemed before Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Oh, heat, [Music] heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I heat. [Music] [Music] Heat.

God bless you as you have your seats. [Music] Well, I know that our sister Irene Kemper is not a stranger to most of us here and I'd like to say some words from my heart. I consider it a privilege to baptize her because I believe that God has permitted me to baptize most if not all of her children. And uh the one daughter I did not recognize uh was Colleen. I didn't uh we have brother Roger, brother Lyall, Sister Norin, and Sister Colleen. And I wouldn't doubt that today Mark is leaning over the banister. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh having a sense of greater joy if that's possible and where he is. And I I noticed very early that Sister Keer uh and when I say Sister Keer, I want you to know that two Sundays ago, she came forward and we started a prayer and I said to God in my prayer right at the beginning, I said, "Father, I have called Sister Keer a sister for a long time because I believe that you are going to bring her and she has respected I've seen this respect in her in her heart for the changes that took place and they were dramatic changes and perhaps a mystery to her at the beginning but as she saw these changes take place in her children's lives she had a great respect and that caught my eye and God made the scriptures real to her and as he did she walked in Yes. And if I could relate, may I relate just what took place a few weeks ago regarding the scripture when you went to your church. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh you were uh there was a in the night time a song was coming to you. &gt;&gt; Oh. Uh well, my name was called. &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; My name I heard my name was called. like it says Irene &gt;&gt; in the night time and you actually heard your name called. &gt;&gt; I did. Yeah. &gt;&gt; She heard her name called in the night time &gt;&gt; and I just looked up and and didn't see anybody or and then I just peacefully went back to well I didn't go back to sleep but I was just thinking of this song. I hear you're calling my name in the night. &gt;&gt; Now for those who didn't catch it she heard this song. I &gt;&gt; I just thought you know &gt;&gt; I heard you calling my name. That's a song out of the on out of a song book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In her church had a Catholic church. &gt;&gt; And that morning when I went to church, there have to be Sunday. Yes. &gt;&gt; The Sunday morning I went to church and they sang that song. The same song that was thick enough. &gt;&gt; The choir sang the song that she heard right after she heard her name called and then she hears this song and it's about the song title of the song is &gt;&gt; I hear you calling my name in the night. &gt;&gt; I hear you calling my name in the night. Now folks, God doesn't do things, doesn't he? Do things exact? And then she gets up and goes to church and the choir sings that song. I hear you calling my name in the night. &gt;&gt; And the priest got up and read this scripture. I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, &gt;&gt; like unto me, and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. And if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the word of the Lord, the word of the Lord hath not spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is a thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet that hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him. And I said, uh, when the priest was finished reading that scripture, what did he do? She said, he didn't comment on it at all. just read that scripture and it went straight to her heart for God was certainly calling you in the night. Sister Keer became, I'd say, fully persuaded. And I want to say to you, Sister Irene, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was also able to perform, and I have found you to have become fully persuaded. And Paul said,"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you want to say anything? I just want to just say to everybody for to to thank everybody for all the prayers for me and that I have the that God gave me the courage to do go through with this and I feel in my heart it is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, at this very sacred and lovely moment, we stand in the water. Jesus, you once stood in the water with John. You were baptized. Multitudes came, both men and women. They heard the word. They were stirred as our sister Keer has been stirred. They no doubt looked perhaps some of the members of their family and saw such dramatic things happening and taking place. And the people following this young prophet of Nazareth called Jesus Christ. And as they followed him, he is the word and he increased and they increased. And now, Lord, I know that your Holy Spirit, as we've spoken together, will now come to the word which our sister Keer has believed, and it shall explode into depth of of such richness and such meaning. And Lord, I pray that her fellowship with you will always be sweet. That you'll be her comforter. You'll be her guide all through life, Lord. And in that great gathering time in the rapture, &gt;&gt; we'll be united and joined together. Lord, I pray your blessing upon her life. And now, Father, she has followed you in repentance and now in baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. And you have promised and she shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn sideways this way if you will. Just turn this way. That's fine. Put your hand. That's fine. That's fine. You can hold up. &gt;&gt; Father. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we just take our sister now. Take all fear away. &gt;&gt; Let peace completely permeate her. &gt;&gt; Sister Irene Keer according to how God has spoken to you. I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless her prayed heart. Amen. Well, it's the first time I had my head in the water. &gt;&gt; That's the first time she said she had her head in the water. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you doing, Ken? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; New life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The old man's been buried here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a mass grave right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a chorus, Brother Derek. &gt;&gt; Oh, peace like a river. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Is it up in your heart? [Music] Holy Spirit Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother and sister Dodd's their daughter, Sister Diane. Daughter Sarah. Brother Claude's daughter Sarah. How long has Sister Diane been waiting for this? &gt;&gt; Years. &gt;&gt; Years. &gt;&gt; Years. &gt;&gt; Do you want to say how many? &gt;&gt; Poverty. What? &gt;&gt; Since 75. &gt;&gt; Since 1975. &gt;&gt; I know. They've been here 23 years. And I've been waiting for 23 years. That's why I had the scriptures. Brother Claude became persuaded. And when did God meet you? In the woods. &gt;&gt; Uh 2004. &gt;&gt; 16 months ago. &gt;&gt; 16 months ago. &gt;&gt; 16 months ago. &gt;&gt; 16 months to &gt;&gt; God met him in the woods. Saved him. Delivered him from cigarettes. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother Claude's a wee bit like brother Bud Southwick and he's a man of the wilderness and God met him in the wilderness. God loves his creation for the scripture says for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure were they created. It's no wonder that we enjoy them. Brother Claude and God made himself real to him by giving him a trophy deer. And God made himself real to Bud Southwick when he saw the vision of the caribou and the grizzly right in his own that was his own element. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I've always respected brother Claude and he's never heard me say these things but I've always respected you Claude. Thank you &gt;&gt; for this reason. You've always been a man of principles. You've always been respectable of God and his message. He allowed your wife to come to church, your children. And he's been a hard worker. He works hard in a mill to provide for his family. And I've respect him for God. Honors that. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Definitely. And one day, God called him and delivered him from every chain that Satan tried to hold him by. And I have a quote I want to read for you. Brother Brandham said, "I love the mountains. I love the sunsets. I just stake down and time a horse and take up top of the mountains and stay a couple of days just watching the sunrise and go down." Hearing the eagle scream, "It's good. I'd love to be there." But brother, my heart begins to thump and to beat when I think of unclean, unclean. The evil spirits tore him. And he's singing that song. He said, "All is well when Jesus comes to stay." &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; and that begins to thump in the prophet's heart. He says, "I begin to think of the sick and that call and there's something within me cries and I get down out of those mountains right quick down to the people and I want to identify myself as his servant among his people. Oh, how I love to identify myself with him." Then in regards to that, he comes back among us and identifies himself with us. And today, Brother Claude met God up in the mountains. But now he's here in the tank &gt;&gt; and God is here to identify him with himself. &gt;&gt; Brother Claude, we're going to leave a skeleton of a man down in this water. &gt;&gt; It's going to be the old man. &gt;&gt; No, I don't want him. &gt;&gt; You don't want him? Is there anything you want to say that how God dealt with you and brought you here now? just &gt;&gt; oh he started dealing with me and I just I didn't know what was going on and I mean it started the summer 2004 and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and everything I do I just didn't enjoy it no more right &gt;&gt; so we went hunting and everything and that night couldn't sleep I mean it just kept dealing with me all night long so when I got up that morning to leave camp I just said hey I said I don't understand this I said whatever you want to do if you give me the deer and everything. I will follow you no matter where. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And and then he starts speaking you about baptism. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And about two months ago, I started feel like I should get baptized. So &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; it would come and go and just get stronger and stronger and stronger. So here I am. &gt;&gt; You became persuaded. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that lovely? Our gracious and loving heavenly father, we are standing here Lord with my brother Claude Sigman and how you have so tenderly and we think of the word and the attribute of your longsuffering year after year you'd speak to him and you deal with him and you'd hear prayers made Lord his wife prayed and his mother and father-in-law prayed and we prayed Lord that one day you'd make yourself known to him and We're standing here today, Lord, because you have said repent every one of you in the name of Jes and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray that you will infuse him &gt;&gt; with your spirit and cause him to be a mighty witness for you as he lives this new life in Jesus Christ. We thank you now. Amen. Put your hands together. Brother Claude, I now baptize you on the basis of your confession in Jesus Christ and what he has done for you. I baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother. Bless you. Bless you. Amen. The glorious and his wonderful love. We'll give the glory to Jesus and tell his wonderful glory to Jesus. Oh, his wonderful love will give the glory to Jesus and tell his wonderful love. &gt;&gt; That's who we want to give the glory to. &gt;&gt; I think we know it all by heart. Amen. [Music] I'll be just almost in India. Amen. Well, God bless you. Saints for having communion uh service next Sunday night. And I know that's a special time. So, the brothers that are on shift work, if you want to make yourself available for that evening, that will be wonderful. Will you pray for me this evening? &gt;&gt; We're in a lot of trouble. [Music] Second Timothy 3 and 1 &gt;&gt; plus amplified. [Music] &gt;&gt; Well, that makes a preacher pretty nervous, folks. &gt;&gt; But the Lord has a mind, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; We want to catch the mind of the Holy Spirit. I know that you're believers. I know you'll pull on the word of God where, you know, I mean, there's this is a big Bible. There's a lot of words in this Bible. And I believe the Holy Spirit has a mind and and I thought it was a tremendous word we heard this morning. So be praying for me this evening and we want to thank the Lord for these ones that he's added to the kingdom. Sister Camper, Brother Claude, God bless these warriors. May God use them for the kingdom. Let's pray. [Music] Lord, we are lovers of your word. We see in this age there are sign seekers. But I believe I'm with a people Lord that are word seekers. We desire the unveiling of God. We desire with a great desire within us to see the body of Christ to see that word become manifest within our lives. And so, Father, we're just asking now that as these precious souls have now come to the waters of baptism, would you baptize them with the Holy Ghost and fire? May Lord God, you consume their lives. And we are so thankful for their walk with God and how you've led our dear sister and our our dear brother Claude Sigman. We just pray that you will lead them faithfully in the days ahead. And Lord Jesus, we're praying for brother Dier. He'll be taking a service this evening. Maybe weary and body how Satan has attacked him this week. We pray that you will so inspire him. Use him mightily. May God the word of God come in power and demonstration. And may it be such a tremendous meeting in Seattle. And Father, remember us this evening. Father, we're just asking that you will take a little thought that you've laid upon my heart. I pray you'll inspire the speaker and the hearer. And Lord, we'll give you all the glory in Jesus name. Amen. We'll give the glory to Jesus and tell his wonderful love. We'll give you the glory to Jesus and tell of his wonderful love. [Music] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Mhm. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
