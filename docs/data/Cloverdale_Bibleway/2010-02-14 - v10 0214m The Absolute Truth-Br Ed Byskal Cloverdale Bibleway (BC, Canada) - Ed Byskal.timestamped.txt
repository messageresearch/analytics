[2:32] Father, that's our desire this morning
[2:34] is for your presence to move among us
[2:37] this morning, Lord. And Father, it's so
[2:40] easy to tell when you come among us,
[2:41] Father, because the sick are healed.
[2:45] Those that are bound are delivered. The
[2:47] backsliders are drawn closer to you,
[2:50] Lord Jesus. That's our desire this
[2:53] morning, Lord. Father, is to come into a
[2:56] presence of the living God, Lord, and
[2:59] have our lives changed, Lord Jesus.
[3:02] We thank you for your presence this
[3:04] morning. And Lord, we want to make much
[3:07] of your presence, Lord, and tell you how
[3:10] much we love you, Lord Jesus. And how
[3:13] much we thank you, Lord, for your
[3:14] guiding hand and for your mercy and your
[3:17] grace, Lord Jesus. We love you this
[3:20] morning, Lord Jesus.
[3:22] We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[3:25] Hallelujah. Let's sing that chorus.
[3:27] Consume me Lord with the fire of your
[3:30] spirit. You know what struck me this
[3:32] morning?
[3:34] How many sacrifices of praise will will
[3:36] go up towards the Lord today? And how
[3:40] many will be received from him? It's one
[3:42] thing to offer a sacrifice. It's another
[3:45] for him to receive it. And that's our
[3:46] desire this morning is that our hearts
[3:49] would be so sincere before him that he
[3:52] would come and consume the sacrifice and
[3:54] live in our praise that he would be
[3:56] glorified this morning. Let's sing it
[3:59] together.
[4:01] Come to

[8:07] prayer this morning. I just have one
[8:09] prayer request as for uh my wife Hedi.
[8:13] Her sister Susan is in the advanced
[8:15] stage of cancer. She's been around three
[8:17] times with treatment and she really
[8:19] needs a touch from the Lord this morning
[8:21] and she asked that we would remember her
[8:23] in prayer.
[8:25] And you know, we're not afraid of that
[8:26] demon cancer.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; We've stared it straight in the eye.
[8:32] We've stared it straight in the eye and
[8:35] to be honest, been afraid. And then
[8:37] Jesus came.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus comes, there's nothing to
[8:40] be afraid of anymore.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Alex, come open the
[8:44] service in a word of prayer.

[32:51] these people have.
[32:54] Well, first I got an email from them
[32:56] just a few days ago
[32:58] and they said we're down here in
[33:00] Sacramento and we we've come from the
[33:03] from the Soviet Union or they've been
[33:06] there four or five years
[33:08] and uh you know just I could just sense
[33:12] some kind of a little hunger for so I
[33:15] answered them right away and and then uh
[33:19] came back another answer and and before
[33:21] I could get that one answered they said
[33:23] we're going to drive up for service. So,
[33:27] here's some folks come from Sacramento.
[33:30] Been driving a long time.
[33:34] I don't know just how far that would be,
[33:36] Brother West, but it's a long ways.
[33:38] Probably be 15 or more hours, I suppose.
[33:44] So, we want to just say God bless them.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll greet them in just a few
[33:50] moments. Uh
[33:54] well, we they've came up to the meeting
[33:56] and this is brother Adam and sister
[33:59] Sarah
[34:01] Graham's last Sunday with us. They're
[34:04] going to they're they're not going to
[34:06] desert us. They're just going to take a
[34:09] recess
[34:11] down in Boisee, Idaho.
[34:14] And uh uh they're going to be with
[34:16] Brother Paul and Sister Jerry Hale and
[34:19] their church. And uh brother brother
[34:23] uh Adam is going to work with brother
[34:26] Paul. He's he's got a quite a farm
[34:29] industry and business there which he's
[34:31] been in for quite a few years. And uh
[34:35] brother Adam is going to help him. He
[34:37] needs he needs a good man. And Adam's a
[34:40] good man. Brother Adam,
[34:43] why don't you come up here and say a
[34:45] word of greeting to these people? You
[34:49] can't just leave us without saying
[34:50] something. Don't you all agree?
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:03] We were over at Brother Adam and Sister
[35:05] Sarah's the other night and here's boxes
[35:07] piled all over the place and she fixed
[35:09] up a big dinner and I said, "Why don't
[35:10] you let us take you out for for dinner
[35:13] instead of having us here when she's
[35:15] doing all that work?" But Adam, well,
[35:17] you know, he's got a good wife. And I
[35:18] can say, Sister Sarah's been just,
[35:21] you've been an ideal sister in Christ
[35:24] and just a quiet spirited
[35:27] uh I'm saying that to you now,
[35:32] sister with a real quiet spirit and and
[35:35] a real example of a believer. Brother
[35:37] Adam.
[35:39] Amen.
[35:41] God bless you.
[35:44] G give us reason for your
[35:50] God bless you.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Um
[35:53] &gt;&gt; boy, I was
[35:54] &gt;&gt; really hoping he wasn't going to do this
[35:56] to me. Um
[36:00] uh it's humbling to stand before you all
[36:03] and
[36:05] it's been good to be here.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. for
[36:10] 14 years and um
[36:14] being under brother Biscll's ministry
[36:16] and the other ministers here, we've
[36:19] uh we've grown exponentially
[36:22] um
[36:24] had some failings and
[36:27] but we've had a lot of good results and
[36:30] um unfortunately our pathway seems to be
[36:34] separating at this time and um
[36:38] Um, but we look forward to our new
[36:41] direction that the Lord's given us and
[36:43] um, just to go into a smaller group of
[36:47] believers. There's it's a very small
[36:50] group. It would wouldn't even take up
[36:52] this little side over here. So,
[36:55] we're excited about going there and just
[36:58] putting our shoulder the wheel with
[37:00] brother Paul. And we've really
[37:02] appreciated his ministry and his life
[37:04] and his influence on me. and um believe
[37:08] we'll be able to learn a lot and gain a
[37:11] lot from his experience.
[37:14] Um
[37:16] what can I say? We just we haven't got
[37:18] the chance to fellowship with everybody
[37:20] here but many of you and um
[37:25] we just love you all and we appreciate
[37:27] you. And of course we'll be streaming a
[37:30] lot of the services too, you know, when
[37:32] we can and just um so stay in your
[37:35] places. So, we've heard it how, you
[37:38] know, people abroad want to see where
[37:40] you're at and um well, I guess we're
[37:42] going to experience it. So, make sure
[37:45] you're there on the front row and uh
[37:47] make sure you're smiling for us. And
[37:50] anyway, God bless you. Pray for us.
[37:53] We'll we'll be praying for you. And know
[37:55] in the times that we live in,
[37:58] things are difficult, but God said he
[38:01] wouldn't put any more on us than we
[38:03] could handle. And um
[38:06] &gt;&gt; more than handle, we we're more than
[38:08] overcomers.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; And um we just appreciate you. Love you.
[38:14] God bless you.
[38:16] [Music]
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to we'll miss you,
[38:26] Brother Adam, Sister Sarah, and your
[38:28] little ones. And uh I told brother Adam
[38:32] he'll probably be here in August because
[38:35] I I can't see a missing camp being here
[38:38] and and uh they're planning on that. At
[38:42] least I'm planning on that.
[38:45] Amen. A good Washingtonian.
[38:49] I guess that we could say it that way.
[38:51] Have to come back once in a while for
[38:53] this fresh Pacific air.
[38:56] Amen. Well, is as is brother Yuri and
[39:00] sister your wife in Sister I wonder if
[39:03] we could have you stand
[39:05] Valentina and brother Yuri and their
[39:07] four uh four children.
[39:11] God bless you.
[39:16] Thank you so much. Well, when you see
[39:19] them, you can shake hands with them and
[39:22] make them welcome. and the other people
[39:24] here that speak the Russian language and
[39:27] there are several here they're be happy
[39:30] to meet you also we'll see you after the
[39:33] service
[39:36] amen
[39:39] isn't he wonderful
[39:42] &gt;&gt; perhaps we could stand and I'd like to
[39:45] sing a verse of that song uh we just
[39:48] finished singing my hope is in the Lord
[39:51] I think it's the last verse
[39:53] Yeah. Do you have a mic there? Okay.
[40:00] mercies
[40:04] with every
[40:06] [Music]
[40:09] to the sin in his brokenness
[40:13] [Music]
[40:17] to offer healing and forgive
[40:24] and those who trust in him
[40:28] will find their Heat. Heat. Heat.
[40:40] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[40:50] Oh,
[40:52] is it
[40:56] forever more?
[41:00] [Music]
[41:03] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[41:06] Just bow with me in prayer, would you
[41:08] please?
[41:10] Our precious Lord Jesus, how thankful we
[41:14] are we have your name that has been
[41:17] given. the name that's above every name.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; And we can approach the almighty God,
[41:23] creator of heaven and earth in that holy
[41:26] and righteous name. Oh, in that name
[41:29] there's salvation. In that name there is
[41:32] rest and peace and there is comfort. Oh
[41:36] God, in that name is power to lift those
[41:40] that may be encumbered and bound and
[41:42] burdened down. Lift up, oh God, the
[41:45] fallen, I pray. and let your word come
[41:49] and minister today. I pray. Lord, we
[41:52] thank you for our sister Valentina,
[41:54] brother Yuri, and their children that
[41:57] you have brought them safely these many,
[41:59] many miles. Oh God, bless them
[42:02] abundantly. Father, in the day of
[42:05] fellowship that they're able to have,
[42:07] bless your people as we've gathered
[42:10] together, oh God. Bless your children
[42:12] wherever they are gathered, oh God. And
[42:15] may they be fed with the true word of
[42:18] God. We are here for that purpose, Lord.
[42:21] We're here with that single purpose in
[42:23] mind that we might be fed, strengthened,
[42:26] edified, and built up in the inner man.
[42:31] Oh God, enrichen us, I pray. Teach us,
[42:35] oh father, out of the great truths that
[42:38] have been unveiled in this hour. Lord,
[42:41] as I stand here, I stand, Father,
[42:45] with no ability within uh myself. And I
[42:50] pray as your prophet has prayed that he
[42:52] may move out of the way and be set aside
[42:56] and that you would come forward. And
[42:59] we've asked this already in prayer in
[43:01] the study. And I pray that you will
[43:03] glorify yourself. Make yourself
[43:06] manifest, oh God. Do those things which
[43:09] will get glory to your name. Show forth
[43:12] your power, I pray. Fill those that need
[43:15] to be filled with your spirit, oh God.
[43:19] Deliver those that are bound.
[43:22] Heal those that are sick. I pray that
[43:25] you will bring redemption and salvation
[43:28] to any that may not know you as yet.
[43:31] Draw them. Draw them.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; We thank you, oh God, for bringing our
[43:37] brother Kim home and for making his trip
[43:39] a successful journey. So much to do and
[43:43] you needed to give him wisdom, oh God.
[43:45] Oh, the Holy Ghost with the gift of
[43:48] wisdom, Father, still available to the
[43:51] believer. And now, Lord, I pray you'll
[43:54] just move us, move us into a higher
[43:56] plane
[43:58] &gt;&gt; and prepare us, oh God, in this rapture
[44:01] age that we are in Jesus name. Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[44:08] Please take your Bibles and turn if you
[44:10] would to John's Gospel, the 8th chapter.
[44:17] We're going to begin reading at the 30th
[44:19] verse.
[44:21] And I would ask that you would be just
[44:24] as reverend and keep your thoughts
[44:27] focused because we uh sometime we
[44:32] approach subjects that
[44:36] go beyond beyond the minister and this
[44:38] is certainly one of them. And uh uh but
[44:42] we just like to bring some things that
[44:45] the Lord has made real to us. Amen.
[44:49] Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful time Friday night.
[44:51] Our brother
[44:53] after the prayer time and brother Daniel
[44:58] from down Tacoma, he gave his gave a
[45:01] testimony at least part of a testimony
[45:04] and he took it from when he was just a a
[45:06] young person. We didn't know what he was
[45:08] going to say, of course, but he took it
[45:09] from when he was just a child, perhaps
[45:12] six, seven, eight years old until he was
[45:15] 16 and had such a desire for God. And I
[45:19] was very, very touched. He said that his
[45:22] mother, his father was a Catholic, his
[45:24] mother was not a Catholic. She became a
[45:27] believer in this message and she was the
[45:29] only one of the family that did. And he
[45:32] said that she would read him stories
[45:36] of out of the Bible. He says, "And he
[45:40] learned to love God."
[45:42] He just fell in love with God.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; From hearing those stories from his
[45:47] mother. I want to say to you sisters,
[45:50] don't ever weary.
[45:53] Don't ever be wearied with telling your
[45:56] children
[45:58] about God, about the living God in the
[46:02] scripture. And we really enjoyed that,
[46:05] brother Daniel. And so, God bless you.
[46:08] All right, we'll read together now. I'm
[46:11] starting with the 30th verse. And as he
[46:13] spake these words, many believed on him.
[46:17] Then said Jesus to those Jews which
[46:20] believed on him, if you continue in my
[46:23] word, then are you my disciples indeed.
[46:28] Notice that the discipleship disciplehip
[46:31] depended on if they continued in his
[46:33] word.
[46:35] And you shall know the truth and the
[46:37] truth shall make you free. They answered
[46:40] unto him. They answered him, "We be
[46:44] Abraham's seed, and we're never in
[46:46] bondage to any man. How sayest thou, ye
[46:50] shall be made free?" Jesus answered
[46:53] them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[46:56] whosoever committh sin is the servant of
[46:58] sin, and the servant abideth not in the
[47:01] house forever, but the son abideth
[47:04] uh abideth ever. If the Son therefore
[47:08] shall make you free, you shall be free
[47:10] indeed. I know that you are Abraham's
[47:13] seed, but you seek to kill me, because
[47:16] my word hath no place in you. I speak
[47:20] that which I have seen with my father,
[47:23] and you do that which you have seen with
[47:25] your father.
[47:27] They answered and said unto him, Abraham
[47:29] is our father. Jesus saith unto them, if
[47:32] you were Abraham's children, you would
[47:34] do the works of Abraham. But now you
[47:36] seek to kill me in a man that hath told
[47:39] you the truth which I have heard of God.
[47:42] This did not Abraham. You do the deeds
[47:45] of your father. Then said they to him,
[47:48] we be not born of fornication. We have
[47:51] one father, even God. Excuse me. Jesus
[47:55] said unto them, if God were your father,
[47:57] ye would love me. For I proceeded forth
[48:00] and came from God, neither came I of
[48:04] myself, but he sent me. You do not. Why
[48:09] do you not understand my speech? Even
[48:11] because you cannot hear my word. Ye are
[48:14] of your father, the devil, and the lust
[48:17] of your father you will do. He was a
[48:20] murderer from the beginning, and abode
[48:22] not in the truth, because there is no
[48:25] truth in him. When he when he speaketh a
[48:28] lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a
[48:32] liar and the father of it. May God bless
[48:36] his word. You may have your seats.
[48:49] Really uh some powerful statements here.
[48:52] I want to take from the words of our
[48:53] Lord Jesus and things which uh the
[48:58] prophet of God has spoken. But Jesus
[49:01] said uh that in verse 31
[49:04] he said to those Jews because it said
[49:06] that many believed on him. So then he
[49:09] said to them if you continue in my word
[49:13] and to continue is to remain
[49:16] and to dwell.
[49:19] So if you continue, it's not just a
[49:21] visit in the message. It is something
[49:25] that is becomes now a part of your life.
[49:28] You are there and you have taken it.
[49:30] You're going to dwell with it. You're
[49:32] going to endure. And uh it also has a
[49:36] reference to the state or condition of a
[49:39] person to remain as one and not to
[49:42] become another or different. And uh and
[49:45] you that have been believers, you no
[49:48] doubt have experienced where where uh
[49:52] those have come uh they have received
[49:55] Christ, have come to the knowledge of
[49:56] the message, but over a period of time
[49:59] they change become something that's very
[50:03] very different from what they were when
[50:05] they received Christ. I think that the
[50:08] the program of God is that we uh come to
[50:12] the knowledge of the revelation of
[50:15] Christ in his word and then that
[50:18] revelation should simply increase get
[50:22] more wonderful more glorious should just
[50:25] have an effect on us and we should be
[50:28] transformed by that transforming power
[50:32] &gt;&gt; of the revealing of Jesus Christ. That's
[50:34] the program. That's the program. We
[50:38] don't come into the knowledge of of
[50:40] Christ and the knowledge of the word and
[50:42] then become more worldly. That's not the
[50:46] program.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; We don't come in with the fire and zeal
[50:50] of God and then cool off. That's not the
[50:53] program. It may not be the same uh you
[50:57] know, we may not be exactly the same in
[51:00] in our zeal for God. It may be something
[51:03] else that we are doing or it may be
[51:05] different. Uh as time goes on our
[51:08] children may be just babies at one point
[51:11] then later on they're teenagers but your
[51:14] desire never changes for God. You teach
[51:18] your children. You teach and you teach
[51:21] your uh your uh uh adult children and
[51:24] you are a brother and and a sister in
[51:27] Christ to those that sit beside you. And
[51:30] you were not only filled with the spirit
[51:32] at one time but remain filled with the
[51:35] spirit so that you can affect others. We
[51:38] are to be to edify the body of Christ.
[51:41] That's what he said. Continue. If you
[51:44] continue then indeed you are my my
[51:47] children. So then my disciples. So we're
[51:51] not to change. And then he said and you
[51:54] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[51:57] make you free. How important is truth?
[52:01] And here's where I will uh certainly uh
[52:06] get into swimming water for myself and
[52:09] perhaps not be able to uh express
[52:13] adequately
[52:15] really what's what I see and feel. But
[52:20] truth is something that is so vital.
[52:23] I've titled the message absolute truth.
[52:29] And uh
[52:35] it's important that we have just a a a
[52:38] thought of what the scripture is. And in
[52:40] in the Old Testament when they spoke of
[52:43] truth, they spoke of something that was
[52:45] firm and stability.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; That was truth. Firmness and stability.
[52:53] So just have that in your mind.
[52:56] Truth is infallible.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Truth is incapable of making a mistake.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Truth cannot fail.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Truth is supreme.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Truth is un unadulterated.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Truth is pure
[53:14] &gt;&gt; and truth is perfect.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; So all of these things are they're
[53:19] almost in the stratosphere as far as our
[53:22] human thinking is. something that's
[53:24] firm. This this world is not firm.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Nothing around us is firm or stable.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's going to be
[53:34] announced tomorrow.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; We don't know what's going to happen in
[53:37] the world tomorrow. Today we may be
[53:40] relatively at peace and and you know
[53:43] have enough to eat and everything else
[53:44] and tomorrow the the bottom can fall
[53:47] out. We say well we've had an economic
[53:49] collapse. It can still collapse more.
[53:52] Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; We don't know what's going to happen. We
[53:55] don't have any idea. And I am absolutely
[53:58] certain of one thing. Someone who tries
[54:00] to stay a breast of what is taking place
[54:02] just so I can, you know, have a have an
[54:05] understanding in the light of what the
[54:07] prophet has spoken about this age that
[54:10] we are in. I can tell you for myself, I
[54:13] don't believe anybody has a handle on
[54:15] it.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Do you agree? Yes.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Not the prime minister of our not the
[54:21] president of the United States, not any
[54:24] leader of the world, whether it's the G8
[54:27] or the G20 or however many they gather
[54:30] around and they just had a a huge
[54:32] conference over in in in Europe and and
[54:36] they want to make some decision on the
[54:38] environment and etc. They couldn't even
[54:41] come to the first decision.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; All the leaders of the world couldn't
[54:46] even come to the first decision.
[54:47] couldn't even decide how to do it.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Here we have Haiti on our hands and uh
[54:54] uh uh million a million or more people
[54:57] without a tart. Brother Andre Pati just
[55:00] emailed us a couple of days ago and and
[55:03] he's coming back now and they put a a
[55:06] committee together and here this people
[55:09] has been a month without food and
[55:12] without shelter and and uh the a million
[55:16] people living under tarps and now the
[55:18] rainy season comes and and I mean
[55:21] there's no no possibility even of the
[55:24] basic cleanliness. Listen friends, we're
[55:28] here. We got our homes, whatever we
[55:29] have, but it's not very many, not too
[55:32] many hours by plane. And there's
[55:35] believers there, several thousand of
[55:37] them. And we thank God we only have a
[55:40] record of 18 believers that went and
[55:42] they don't say they were killed. They
[55:43] said they went to be with the Lord,
[55:45] which is exactly true.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; That's the That's the truth. They went
[55:50] to be with the Lord. 18 out of several
[55:52] thousand believers. And brother Pat was
[55:55] gathered with about 4,500 in two or
[55:58] three different places. 4,500 believers.
[56:01] And God has spared them. And we have one
[56:04] testimony after another after another.
[56:06] It would take us too much time this
[56:08] morning of buildings collapsing. And and
[56:10] and do you know that they had a whole
[56:12] group of people and the pastor was
[56:15] speaking and the people were worshiping
[56:17] and the whole building began to collapse
[56:19] and he and he just instructed the
[56:21] people, "Keep worshiping. keep
[56:23] worshiping. And the people kept
[56:25] worshiping and the building fell down
[56:27] around them and slowly they brought they
[56:30] managed to get everybody out. I don't
[56:32] know how many were in there. And you
[56:33] know what the word they used? Not a
[56:36] scratch.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Not a scratch.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, God is a living God.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; God protects his own.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; God does things right. And I am so so
[56:50] thankful for that. And yet here we have
[56:53] all the world uh you know community
[56:56] rushed down with all kinds of supplies
[57:01] to for the people and they can't quite
[57:05] figure out the system to get it to the
[57:08] people and that is you have it was just
[57:12] so amazing. Here was the airport was
[57:16] absolutely jammed with aircraft and uh
[57:20] and supplies piled high and medical
[57:24] supplies and just off the tarmac was a
[57:27] was a hospital, improvised hospital and
[57:31] people wounded and people needing
[57:33] amputations and every kind of thing. And
[57:36] they couldn't get the supplies from
[57:37] walking distance from the tarmac to that
[57:40] little hospital. Isn't this bizarre?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; You talk about not being able to put
[57:46] things together, not being able to come
[57:48] with a correct kind of decision, and
[57:50] we're not talking about that. This just
[57:52] is a small focus, but it's all
[57:55] throughout the world this way.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; People are starving that don't need to
[58:00] starve.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; People are in need that don't need to be
[58:03] in need. And then we have countries like
[58:06] we have here where we have too much.
[58:09] We may even think we're in need, but
[58:11] even in our need, we have too much
[58:14] compared to others. Can you say amen to
[58:17] that?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; We have things too easy. We have things
[58:20] too grand, you know, compared to others
[58:22] in the world. And yet you you want to do
[58:25] something and you can't even find a
[58:27] channel because there's no channel
[58:29] provided. It's so difficult. So
[58:31] difficult.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And so now I think of this world that
[58:36] we're in. I will say this, there's very
[58:39] little truth
[58:41] out there.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Very little that's true. Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Now, when you think of the original
[58:48] creation, I'll come into this a little
[58:50] later on, but the original creation
[58:56] is true
[58:59] &gt;&gt; in the fact that God said, "Let every
[59:03] seed bring forth after its own kind."
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And the pansy comes up and you know
[59:11] what? It's a pansy
[59:13] &gt;&gt; and the seed falls in the ground and the
[59:16] next year it's still a pansy. The next
[59:18] year it's not a carrot.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; It's not something else.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's what the that's what they were
[59:25] referring to when they say when we
[59:28] become a believer, we're not to become
[59:30] something else.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; When we become a believer, it isn't that
[59:35] we become later on a theologian.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; We should remain a believer. Yes,
[59:42] &gt;&gt; we come in in the fervor and zeal of the
[59:45] Holy Ghost. It isn't that we just settle
[59:48] back and we're at ease in Zion. That's
[59:50] not the program.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Let every seed bring forth after its own
[59:56] kind. And so, every seed we find is true
[1:00:00] to itself.
[1:00:02] the life that's in the seed is true to
[1:00:05] what was spoken bring forth after its
[1:00:09] own kind. And so the animal kingdom and
[1:00:14] uh the creatures of the sea, they bring
[1:00:17] forth after their own kind. And we're
[1:00:19] not surprised at that. But now the
[1:00:22] scripture
[1:00:24] says this, and I'd like you to notice
[1:00:27] because it's going to verse 32 says,
[1:00:30] "And you shall know the truth,
[1:00:34] and the truth shall make you free."
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Not something that's diluted, not
[1:00:43] something that's perverted, not
[1:00:45] something that's like the truth, but the
[1:00:48] truth. Not something that perhaps sounds
[1:00:50] like the truth because you can have
[1:00:53] people use the same jargon, the same
[1:00:56] phrases, but the truth
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; shall make you free.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; And then in verse 36,
[1:01:07] Jesus said,
[1:01:09] "If the son," now it's not you shall
[1:01:12] know the truth and the truth shall make
[1:01:14] you free. But now he's he's redefined it
[1:01:17] a wee bit. If the Son, because he's the
[1:01:20] one that's truth,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; if the Son therefore shall make you
[1:01:25] free, you shall be free indeed.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; So, it's if the Son shall make you free.
[1:01:35] You know, all of God's word is true.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; All of God's word is true.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; And we could say it another way as to
[1:01:45] say it in the prophet's words. God's
[1:01:48] word in its entirety is true.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; The entire the entire
[1:01:55] uh the whole composite word of God is
[1:01:59] true.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with that.
[1:02:03] However,
[1:02:04] one of the foundation truths of the
[1:02:07] prophet's message is that it is the word
[1:02:11] in its season.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; So we could say Christ in its season.
[1:02:17] Christ in his season. The word in its
[1:02:20] season is what's true because you could
[1:02:24] quote some scripture and that's that's
[1:02:26] why brother Brandham says that Moses
[1:02:29] could not use Noah's message. He could
[1:02:33] not say we'll build an ark and float the
[1:02:35] people down the Nile River. It wouldn't
[1:02:38] work because it was not the message for
[1:02:41] his season.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; It was not the word for his season. And
[1:02:46] neither could Christ uh use Moses'
[1:02:49] message. And so we could say, but was
[1:02:53] not the word the truth in Noah's time?
[1:02:56] Absolutely. And so it is it remains
[1:02:59] truth, but it's not applicable.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work for you because we're
[1:03:06] not in Noah's time or Moses time or the
[1:03:08] patriarch's time. We are in this season
[1:03:12] that we're in. And so the truth it must
[1:03:14] be qualified
[1:03:16] that the whole word of God is truth but
[1:03:19] it's not all truth for you uh in that
[1:03:24] comprehensive way because it was truth
[1:03:27] for the people in their time and there
[1:03:30] is a there is a portion of this word
[1:03:34] that is true for us in this time and so
[1:03:39] how do we identify truth if it's the
[1:03:42] truth truth that sets a person free. And
[1:03:45] my people people may say, "Well, I'm not
[1:03:48] bound. I'm not." You see, that's what
[1:03:50] this that's what the Pharisees felt.
[1:03:52] Those that had believed on him. And then
[1:03:54] Jesus said to them, "You shall know the
[1:03:57] truth, and the truth shall make you
[1:03:58] free." They said, "We're not in bondage.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; We're not in bondage. We've never been
[1:04:03] in bondage to any man."
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And they believed it.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And so they said, "We're not in
[1:04:10] bondage." And you notice that when
[1:04:13] uh when they when they spoke to him,
[1:04:16] they answered him. Notice their answer
[1:04:18] very I wished I had this on the screen
[1:04:21] for you, but I didn't have sufficient
[1:04:23] time. They answered him, "We be
[1:04:25] Abraham's seed,"
[1:04:28] which they were, and were never in
[1:04:31] bondage to any man. How sayest thou, you
[1:04:35] shall be made free? Notice now when they
[1:04:38] said, "How sayest thou, you shall be
[1:04:40] made free." Uh um you shall be made
[1:04:44] free. They didn't ask about the truth.
[1:04:48] They didn't say, "Well, what is it
[1:04:50] that's truth?" So the subject was not
[1:04:53] the truth. The subject that they wanted
[1:04:56] to debate with him was we're not in
[1:04:58] bondage. We're not free. We can prove
[1:05:01] that we're not in bondage. We're free.
[1:05:03] We can do what we wish. we worship the
[1:05:05] way we want and so on. But that wasn't
[1:05:07] the point. The Jesus was saying to them,
[1:05:10] the subject matter, the crux of the
[1:05:12] matter was you shall know the truth
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; and the truth shall make you free. So
[1:05:17] they were jumping to the conclusion said
[1:05:19] we're already free but they were not
[1:05:22] free. And so it's possible to be in
[1:05:25] bondage and still believe that one is
[1:05:28] free.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; So then we want to say we're going to be
[1:05:32] free. what am I going to be free from?
[1:05:35] There may be even something today that
[1:05:38] uh you have even as a believer. A
[1:05:41] believer can have something in their
[1:05:42] life. They can have fears.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just speak about some
[1:05:46] things just for a moment. I'm just
[1:05:48] throwing a few things out. They can have
[1:05:50] fears.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; They can have questions or doubts.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And God wants to dispel those.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by a preacher per se, but by
[1:06:01] the word of truth.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; The truth is what makes a person free.
[1:06:07] Oh, it's wonderful to hear the truth.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; And we'll come to it in a few moments.
[1:06:13] How can we know this mighty subject of
[1:06:16] truth?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; How will we be able to identify what's
[1:06:21] going to make us free? How can we
[1:06:23] identify it?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Even as believers, you know,
[1:06:27] we have things that we bear
[1:06:29] unnecessarily.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; We have burdens we bear unnecessarily.
[1:06:35] We have fears. We perhaps have
[1:06:38] sicknesses. So God may allow us
[1:06:40] sickness. But on the other hand, we may
[1:06:43] have it simply because we are not
[1:06:45] reaching out for it.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. We we don't
[1:06:50] want to have a congregation where Satan
[1:06:52] pulls the wool over our eyes or over
[1:06:55] anybody's eyes. I say you do not have to
[1:06:59] live under his oppression. You don't
[1:07:01] have to live under his depression. You
[1:07:04] don't have to live under his disease and
[1:07:06] sickness. You do not have to be
[1:07:09] tormented by him. You do not have to
[1:07:11] have complexes from him. You don't have
[1:07:14] to have anything that comes out of his
[1:07:16] kingdom. for the truth will make you
[1:07:18] free from it.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to just I'd like you just
[1:07:26] to please really hang on to my words
[1:07:29] this morning because I uh I'm under a
[1:07:33] certain strain to bring it to you.
[1:07:38] The first thing, anything that anyone
[1:07:42] has or may experience
[1:07:45] outside of the kingdom of God
[1:07:49] is a result of a lie.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; A lie that Satan spoke through the
[1:07:58] serpent
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; to Eve. Anything
[1:08:03] that you may experience of this world
[1:08:07] or that Satan would try to impose upon
[1:08:10] you has come because of the lie in Eden,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; the first lie. And that is why Jesus who
[1:08:20] was full of grace and truth came out of
[1:08:23] the bosom of God. And we could say as
[1:08:27] God spoke to the serpent and said that
[1:08:30] the woman's seed will bruise your head.
[1:08:34] You'll bruise his heel, but he'll bruise
[1:08:37] your head. And if you look in the
[1:08:38] Hebrew, it says he'll crush his head.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; So the truth has crushed his head.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; We say Jesus hung on Calvary. I'll say
[1:08:48] the truth hung on Calvary
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; to dispose of and to do away with the
[1:08:54] lie of Eden.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; He was going to eradicate
[1:09:01] and we can't be his children and and
[1:09:04] still be under the influence that
[1:09:06] somehow we have to bear under the s
[1:09:09] under the Satan's lie. We don't have to.
[1:09:12] That's why Jesus came and we can say the
[1:09:15] truth hung on Calvary. We can say the
[1:09:18] truth stripped him of death, hell, and
[1:09:20] the grave. The keys. The truth did that
[1:09:24] not for himself. He didn't have to do it
[1:09:26] for himself. He did it for you
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; and he did it for me.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And so therefore, if the son will make
[1:09:37] you free,
[1:09:39] it was Christ in Moses back there.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] Jesus said, "Abraham rejoiced to He saw
[1:09:48] my day and he rejoiced to see my day."
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It was Christ back there.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; It was Christ in Joseph.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It was the son. And what did Joseph do?
[1:10:02] What did what did he what did the son do
[1:10:05] in those people when he was revealed to
[1:10:08] those people? There was a deliverance.
[1:10:12] There was a a a movement. There was
[1:10:15] something of reality that took place. It
[1:10:18] wasn't true that the it was not of truth
[1:10:21] that the people should be in bondage to
[1:10:24] Egypt. So, it was truth that removed
[1:10:27] them out of there. Truth is a powerful
[1:10:30] thing, friends.
[1:10:36] So he said that th this is another day
[1:10:40] in the message the identified Christ of
[1:10:43] all ages. He said what would it what
[1:10:46] would it have done? Now I know that this
[1:10:48] is elementary for me many of you but
[1:10:51] just follow me please. But what good
[1:10:53] would it have done Moses to come with
[1:10:56] Noah's message? What good would it have
[1:10:59] done John the Baptist to come with Moses
[1:11:02] message? So we could say, "Was not
[1:11:05] Moses' message truth?"
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Or would we tear all that portion out of
[1:11:10] the Bible?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; No. Because it was truth, but it was
[1:11:13] truth for them.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Not that it's not truth when you read it
[1:11:18] today. We read it, but it's a historical
[1:11:22] thing for us.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; And that is why people who said, uh,
[1:11:27] I've had people say, "I live by the Ten
[1:11:29] Commandments." Oh, that's a big lie.
[1:11:32] Right?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody's living by the Ten Commandments.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. The Ten Commandments
[1:11:37] came to show you you were a sinner.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; That's why they came.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; The Ten Commandments came as a policeman
[1:11:44] to throw you in jail and to give you a
[1:11:47] guilty conscience. Nobody's living by
[1:11:49] the Ten Commandments.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:11:57] John the Baptist could not come with
[1:11:59] Moses message.
[1:12:01] Not because it wasn't truth. It was
[1:12:03] truth for them back then, but it wasn't
[1:12:05] truth for John the Baptist day. And they
[1:12:10] said, "Brother Vandom saying, we haven't
[1:12:12] got Sanki's message." Many of you may
[1:12:14] not know Sanki. He was a great singer.
[1:12:18] We haven't got Moody's message. The
[1:12:20] Moody Bible Institute came from Moody's
[1:12:24] ministry.
[1:12:25] We've got the message of this hour.
[1:12:29] So he wasn't saying Sanki was false and
[1:12:31] Moody was false. He was just saying we
[1:12:33] haven't got their truth.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Their truth won't work for us.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; We have the message of this day.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet is saying friends
[1:12:43] that there is a truth
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; today.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And the truth isn't because we come to
[1:12:49] Bible way or go to any other message
[1:12:51] church. That doesn't make it truth and
[1:12:54] that doesn't make us true. Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond that.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; We have to know. We have to be able to
[1:13:04] identify what is the truth.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:13:12] "We've got the message of this hour.
[1:13:17] We haven't got Luther's message or
[1:13:20] Wesley's message."
[1:13:22] They were all right.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. But this is another day.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; This is another promise
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; and this is another church age.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; So this church age simply cannot
[1:13:37] function or the the the tactic and the
[1:13:42] warfare that Satan will conduct upon the
[1:13:45] people of this day. We cannot be free
[1:13:48] from it. We cannot overcome him with
[1:13:51] some mere history
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; that John the Baptist had or Luther had.
[1:13:56] That's why those churches go into
[1:13:58] bondage because there is not truth of
[1:14:02] this hour to set them free.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; He said Jesus Christ the same yesterday.
[1:14:10] What was my message the other day? Today
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; today
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; today and forever.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're not we're not concerned
[1:14:20] as we're sitting here about the forever
[1:14:22] part. And we're certainly not concerned
[1:14:24] with yesterday's part. That was for
[1:14:26] Luther's part, Wesley's part. We're
[1:14:29] concerned about the today part.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That we that we can identify
[1:14:34] truth
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; and we can say this is my portion.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And this truth I don't have to take the
[1:14:41] truth and make wind it up and make it
[1:14:44] work. This truth will make me free.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I sell that truth will
[1:14:50] transform you.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Say, be free from what
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; we want to be free. One thing I want to
[1:14:56] be free from is this old clay carcass.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And truth will make you free.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Truth will change your body.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; If a prophet hadn't said it that you'll
[1:15:07] feel a sweep over you, we couldn't be in
[1:15:09] expectation. But truth has put us into
[1:15:12] expectation.
[1:15:13] And it's the truth. You won't change
[1:15:15] your body. Truth will change your body.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And those that are asleep in the grave,
[1:15:22] don't forget they died in the faith.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Truth will free them from the grave.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; They certainly need to be set free.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And we sitting here today, we need to be
[1:15:35] free from this old carcass. We need to
[1:15:38] be free from our old our own our own
[1:15:42] thoughts and the restrictions and the
[1:15:44] feathers of them. Oh God, I pray you'll
[1:15:47] take uh take the by the Holy Spirit and
[1:15:51] and defeat Satan in the battleground of
[1:15:55] our minds.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; If I ask for hands to be shown, there's
[1:16:00] a good number of you. I know it is you.
[1:16:02] I know it is true that there's a good
[1:16:04] number sitting right here in this
[1:16:05] congregation that that Satan wars in
[1:16:09] your mind.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; There's a battle goes on in your mind.
[1:16:14] But the God that I serve and the God
[1:16:17] that brought you into this message wants
[1:16:20] you to be free from that warfare.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; We have a battle, but we should fight
[1:16:26] the battle. Take the word of truth,
[1:16:28] defeat him, and then you're free from
[1:16:31] it.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be free from it.
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:36] That's why people go into drugs and they
[1:16:39] go into alcohol and they go into
[1:16:41] pleasures of sin and they go into just
[1:16:43] pleasures that may not be sinful as such
[1:16:46] but they go into pleasures. People are
[1:16:48] consumed with the Olympics and and and
[1:16:50] and I tell you what it's a huge huge
[1:16:53] thing now. It's just a Vancouver is a
[1:16:55] big party place.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; True. Right.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; I was saddened said in the newspaper
[1:17:04] that all the people that have come and
[1:17:07] especially international reporters from
[1:17:10] all countries of the world all the and
[1:17:13] dignitaries and former presidents and
[1:17:16] vice presidents and whatever more are
[1:17:19] here. It was much bigger than I thought
[1:17:21] it was going to be because we don't
[1:17:23] follow it that much. But they said they
[1:17:25] found that Vancouver
[1:17:27] is gay friendly,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Vancouver is pot friendly.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Vancouver was something else friendly.
[1:17:39] And I thought I would to God that they
[1:17:43] could have said Vancouver is God
[1:17:45] conscious.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Vancouver is God friendly,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; but it's a godless place.
[1:17:54] San Francisco, Los Angeles, these West
[1:17:57] Coast nations are godless places. It is
[1:18:01] so all over the world.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; But it just seems that we're conscious
[1:18:05] of it.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:18:10] truth has so told me. Truth has said
[1:18:13] that God's going to destroy this world.
[1:18:20] And I felt so compelled here in the last
[1:18:24] meeting or two, don't be found where
[1:18:27] that very good friend of ours, I and my
[1:18:30] wife used to be our pianist when I
[1:18:32] pastored in Dawson Creek, a Pentecostal
[1:18:35] pastor's wife. But when she heard of the
[1:18:38] earthquake in San Francisco, she was on
[1:18:41] the phone immediately. Why didn't she
[1:18:43] call some other Pentecostal pastor? No,
[1:18:46] she called me.
[1:18:48] What did brother Brandham say about the
[1:18:50] earthquake? Did he say, "I heard he said
[1:18:52] there was going to be three." Now she's
[1:18:54] trying to draw on what God's vindicated
[1:18:57] prophet has said because deep in her
[1:19:00] heart of hearts, she knew that was the
[1:19:02] source
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; and she knew that ministry was true.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And so she wanted to draw on it right
[1:19:09] away in the hour of need. I can tell
[1:19:11] you, don't wait till then.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; It'll be way too late then.
[1:19:16] We want to be walking in the fullness of
[1:19:18] it now.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here, friends, so
[1:19:21] we might gain some understanding of what
[1:19:25] God wants us to know. Not yesterday or
[1:19:27] forever, but today.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Help me out.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "How astounding it is." Listen
[1:19:37] to the prophet saying, "How astounding
[1:19:39] it is how blind people can get in the
[1:19:43] age. But it's got to be that way.
[1:19:47] Lukewarm in this age. The Bible said
[1:19:50] that they'd be spewed out of his mouth
[1:19:53] in this leodyian age.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Aren't you rejoicing today? Thank God
[1:19:59] that what I hear out of the very mouth
[1:20:01] of my bridegroom is his words of
[1:20:04] instruction, is his words of
[1:20:06] enlightenment, and I'm not being spewed
[1:20:09] out of his mouth.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; I am in Christ. That's what he said.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; But as many as he loves, he chastens and
[1:20:18] rebukes.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; He spoke it would be this way in the day
[1:20:21] of this day and age. And in the rapture
[1:20:23] message, he said, "Flesh and blood never
[1:20:28] reveal this to you."
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I say that to all of us that are here
[1:20:32] and within the sound of my voice and
[1:20:35] those that are on the internet
[1:20:36] streaming, flesh and blood has not
[1:20:39] revealed this to you.
[1:20:42] and let us rejoice over that.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; But he said, "But my father
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; uh which is in heaven has revealed this
[1:20:49] to you." He has revealed this to you.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; It isn't something you learn through
[1:20:54] going to a church or even just reading
[1:20:57] some book because you had have to do
[1:20:58] more than listen to a tape or read a
[1:21:01] book.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It'll have to be the father
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; that reveals what you're reading
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; because otherwise you might put it back
[1:21:15] 40 years ago or we read about, you know,
[1:21:17] what Jesus did and put it back 2,000
[1:21:20] years ago. No, there is a message for
[1:21:23] this hour. There's a word for this
[1:21:26] season.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; There's a word for this people.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here in service
[1:21:31] this morning. And he says, "Upon this
[1:21:33] rock, I'll build my church." And brother
[1:21:36] Brandham injects here the revelation of
[1:21:39] the word in its season.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; That's what he'll do. That's how he
[1:21:44] builds his church. It's the revelation
[1:21:47] of the word in its season.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, I don't want to just preach
[1:21:52] a message this morning. I want you to I
[1:21:55] want to ignite something in your soul.
[1:21:57] Oh God, I want you to become desperate.
[1:22:01] Oh God, reveal what I need right in this
[1:22:04] season.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Reveal what is my portion
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; in this season today
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; what I need today. We don't know what
[1:22:13] we're going to face tomorrow.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; But God wants to give you today
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; what you'll need tomorrow.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And God
[1:22:23] proves
[1:22:25] that it's his word.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; By vindicating. So I asked Pilate said,
[1:22:32] "What is truth?"
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; He like the Pharisees, he didn't really
[1:22:36] want to know either
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; because when he said, "What is truth?"
[1:22:40] Then the Bible says, "And then he walked
[1:22:42] and left."
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't even wait for an answer.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about this, please.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Here is the supreme
[1:22:54] authority
[1:22:56] of the government order of that day. The
[1:23:00] supreme authority. And governments are
[1:23:03] supposed to function on the truth.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And he was there to determine why is
[1:23:10] this man being condemned to be
[1:23:13] crucified?
[1:23:14] And he's struggling. And his wife has a
[1:23:16] dream, but he's struggling. And he's
[1:23:19] saying to them, I don't find any fault
[1:23:21] in this man. I don't find anything
[1:23:23] worthy of death in this man.
[1:23:26] And they're saying, "Crucify him.
[1:23:29] Crucify him."
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; And he's being persuaded. And then he
[1:23:36] said to Jesus, "Are you a king?" He
[1:23:38] said, "For this purpose came I enter the
[1:23:40] world."
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And Pilate went back out and said,
[1:23:46] "Shall I crucify your king?"
[1:23:49] And they said, "We have no king but
[1:23:51] Caesar."
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And they put they put fear into him
[1:23:56] because they said, you know, if you let
[1:23:59] him go,
[1:24:02] who's one who's declaring to be a king
[1:24:05] or the people want to make a king, you
[1:24:07] can't be a friend of Caesar.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; There'll be a problem, a political
[1:24:12] problem. and he submitted to their will
[1:24:15] and to his fear and whatever more and
[1:24:18] let Christ made a decision,
[1:24:22] a false decision,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; a decision from darkness. But God knew
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; they were going to make that decision.
[1:24:30] That was all in the program of God.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; But still, and I find it such a paradox.
[1:24:35] The man who's supposed to have truth,
[1:24:37] the man who's sitting in the highest
[1:24:40] position of government is supposed to
[1:24:42] make a decision. He's a he's in the
[1:24:45] judicial system, but he makes a he makes
[1:24:49] a a decision based on falsehood,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; based on what the people are saying. And
[1:24:55] they even brought in false witnesses.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And so he makes a decision based on
[1:25:01] false witnesses, even against his own
[1:25:03] conviction.
[1:25:07] So now
[1:25:10] I have been speaking these last series
[1:25:12] of services and I've even heard it I've
[1:25:15] gotten it from emails. I've gotten it
[1:25:17] from some of you that have spoken to me
[1:25:21] that there seems to be a certain
[1:25:23] emphasis
[1:25:25] seems to be a certain channel, a certain
[1:25:27] direction and there is and I can sum it
[1:25:30] up by saying this
[1:25:33] that what I've been stressing
[1:25:35] and what I've been emphasizing because I
[1:25:37] feel it. It's something it's not
[1:25:38] something I'm trying to teach people,
[1:25:41] but it's something that I've experienced
[1:25:44] within myself and I trust that others
[1:25:46] can lay hold of it. I'm emphasizing the
[1:25:49] importance of the message as being our
[1:25:52] absolute.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to I want to deal with
[1:25:58] something here.
[1:26:01] I've heard ministers and they've said it
[1:26:03] to me and I've heard it over the pulpits
[1:26:07] and they said
[1:26:09] this is our absolute.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Not the message but this word of God is
[1:26:14] our absolute. And I can say amen to
[1:26:16] that. But then I have another question.
[1:26:20] Why is he saying this is our absolute?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And most of the time there's a second
[1:26:26] ulterior motive. is because he has a
[1:26:29] personal he has a personal doctrine he
[1:26:32] wants to bring forward that is not in
[1:26:34] harmony with the message.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; So he's wanting to take his own
[1:26:39] interpretation of the word and present
[1:26:41] it to the people as being the truth
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; over and above what the prophet of God
[1:26:48] has said.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; But I cannot accept that. And the reason
[1:26:52] why I can say that the message is is the
[1:26:55] absolute because
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; as brother Brandham said, did the angel
[1:27:00] tell you that? Did the angel say that?
[1:27:03] He said if the angel said anything that
[1:27:06] was contrary to the word of God, I would
[1:27:09] not believe the angel.
[1:27:12] So in that this is the absolute but the
[1:27:15] message is the absolute revelation of
[1:27:17] this word
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; and the message will not stray away from
[1:27:23] this word.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; If you find something in the message
[1:27:26] that's outside of the word of God,
[1:27:29] you've got the wrong understanding.
[1:27:31] [Applause]
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; I want to deal with that. Amen.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Because I've I've experienced it. I've
[1:27:44] seen it. It's troubled me. And I
[1:27:46] wouldn't want anybody to,
[1:27:49] you know, to see that and stumble over
[1:27:51] it because, oh, is it the message is the
[1:27:52] absolute or is it the word of God that's
[1:27:54] the absolute? The word of God is the
[1:27:56] absolute. And the message is the
[1:27:58] absolute revelation of the word of God.
[1:28:02] for our season.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; God did not send the messenger now to
[1:28:08] give us a great understanding of
[1:28:11] everything that Moses did cuz that's not
[1:28:14] our season
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; and that's not his commission. He's a
[1:28:18] seventh church age messenger to the
[1:28:21] Leodysian church age
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and the Lord Jesus speaking to him
[1:28:28] speaking to the messenger of the last
[1:28:31] church age and it would be it would be
[1:28:34] to brother Brandham. This is a this is a
[1:28:37] scripture to him.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] And under the angel of the church of the
[1:28:49] Leodysans, write these things saith the
[1:28:53] amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; And the faithful
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; and true witness.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying to him,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; what you are going to hear
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; is the true witness.
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Not something different, but this is the
[1:29:10] truth of the word of God.
[1:29:13] Amen.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Is it making clear being clear to you?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; So now listen close because I'm going to
[1:29:25] tie it down as tight as I can
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; in a perfect message, perfect faith. He
[1:29:30] said he manifests his word
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; to show that it is his word.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; So he manifested how with supernatural
[1:29:41] happenings. with supernatural things. We
[1:29:44] say, "Well, the world, Pentecost, all
[1:29:47] kinds, Catholics get healing, have
[1:29:49] supernatural things." But that that sign
[1:29:52] doesn't have a voice.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; The supernatural sign, the manifestation
[1:29:58] must have a voice and that voice must
[1:30:01] unveil the word of God. Yes.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; So even people within the message say,
[1:30:07] "Well, we must be true because we have
[1:30:10] this sign or we have this
[1:30:11] manifestation." That doesn't prove
[1:30:13] anything.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; When the prophet of God come, and I'm
[1:30:18] going to give you now some very, very
[1:30:20] strong quotes.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And he said that he manifest his word to
[1:30:25] show that it is his word. In other
[1:30:27] words, even the manifestation that God
[1:30:31] causes to happen, the supernatural that
[1:30:34] God causes to happen, he does that to
[1:30:37] prove that what is spoken is his word.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; He said a scripture fulfillment to prove
[1:30:45] that it is.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now you believe it when you
[1:30:48] pass by,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; will you?" And he was asking the people
[1:30:51] to pass by and when hands were laid on
[1:30:53] them. So he said the word that God is
[1:30:56] vindicating, this is my statement now.
[1:30:58] The word that God is vindicating or
[1:31:00] proving now,
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; today,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; if you will hear his voice,
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; the voice of the sign,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; the sign has a voice.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Now, the Apostle Paul said these words,
[1:31:16] and I'm staying on this subject.
[1:31:19] study to show thyself approved unto God.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; A workman that needeth needeth not to be
[1:31:26] ashamed,
[1:31:28] rightly dividing
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; the word of what?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Truth. In other words, the word of truth
[1:31:36] can be wrongly divided.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; It's still the word of truth. But it's
[1:31:43] not being divided correctly.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; And so it's important that we see now
[1:31:47] what does this mean? dividing the word
[1:31:49] of truth. To divide it is to cut
[1:31:51] straight
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; to hue to the line
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; to proceed on a straight path.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; It's not this way and then that way and
[1:32:01] this way,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; oh, help me.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Because I I I need to draw from some
[1:32:09] things and
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; and sometimes I question whether I
[1:32:12] should or not. But I I had I had a tape
[1:32:16] from a man, a minister, this message
[1:32:21] and he's not ministering today and I
[1:32:22] just have to say, "Excuse me, but thank
[1:32:24] God he's not ministering
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; because he had a tape on." He said, "Now
[1:32:29] this tape is to correct what I said last
[1:32:31] week." In other what I said last week
[1:32:34] was wrong. I admire him for doing that.
[1:32:37] But then persuade a bunch of people that
[1:32:40] that was correct and that was like a
[1:32:42] thus sayeth the Lord and then come a
[1:32:44] week or two later and say, "Well, forget
[1:32:46] that and now believe this." What
[1:32:48] confidence are the people going to have
[1:32:50] that what he's saying now is the truth.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And that is why it's so important. That
[1:32:55] is why if I hear a man quoting from the
[1:32:57] message and supporting uh spiritual
[1:33:00] truth, you want to pay attention to it
[1:33:03] because we're taking the messenger word
[1:33:05] of the hour. To me, it's Elijah that was
[1:33:08] sent.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; It's a seventh messenger that was sent.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; It's Revelation 10:7 that's speaking.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; It's Revelation 3:14:15.
[1:33:18] It is Christ who's standing on the
[1:33:20] outside saying, knocking, trying to come
[1:33:23] in. He's the one who's speaking.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not William Brandom
[1:33:28] speaking. It is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:31] himself using him as a vessel. I've been
[1:33:35] stressing that friends because I've been
[1:33:37] so troubled when people hear what he
[1:33:40] said and then lay it aside or disregard
[1:33:43] it. And that though that's not so
[1:33:45] important because right now we have to
[1:33:47] tend to this. Listen to me friends.
[1:33:49] You've got to be able to support your
[1:33:51] life by the life of the word of God.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said that if the life
[1:33:58] of uh uh Da Vinci was in him that he'd
[1:34:01] do great painting. If the life of Bach
[1:34:05] was in him, he would write symphonies.
[1:34:07] And if the life of Jesus Christ is in
[1:34:09] you, you will do what? The word of God,
[1:34:12] you'll live this kind of a life,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; not another life.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; We are being injected.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. By the message of this hour, we're
[1:34:21] being injected through the hearing of
[1:34:24] the word down into the channel of the
[1:34:26] soul. We're being inoculated with the
[1:34:29] very life of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Not another, but his life
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; rightly dividing.
[1:34:42] And dividing is not only to cut straight
[1:34:44] or to proceed on a straight path. It's
[1:34:47] to hold a straight course.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that this messenger
[1:34:52] held a straight course.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; A million and a half dollars given to
[1:34:56] him.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Which he would not accept because it he
[1:35:01] said, "For me to receive that," he said,
[1:35:04] "I'd go crazy." He told me, "I just go
[1:35:06] crazy." He said, "I'm not I'm not made
[1:35:08] to handle that kind of money." He said,
[1:35:10] "I just, you know, I have my ministry
[1:35:12] and I have a little little office and so
[1:35:15] on.
[1:35:17] and the popularity
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; and the great denominational system that
[1:35:22] said, "We'd like you to represent us and
[1:35:25] you will never have to worry again
[1:35:28] about the paying for your meetings and
[1:35:31] the expenses. Your financial woes and
[1:35:35] concerns are finished."
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Said, "You'll have to make, we'd ask you
[1:35:40] to make two or three minor changes."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What are they? What do you
[1:35:45] consider a minor change? Well, they
[1:35:48] said, "Well, uh, baptism in the name of
[1:35:50] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:53] and the oneness of the Godhead." He
[1:35:55] said, "You consider that
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; a minor change?"
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:36:03] Satan, friends, he will use the same
[1:36:04] tactic on us.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; He tries to make something that has been
[1:36:09] declared to us as kind of unimportant.
[1:36:12] Well, yeah, it's there. Yeah, you know,
[1:36:13] it is the word of God. Well, yeah, you
[1:36:15] know, the prophet of God said it, but
[1:36:17] but you know, it's just not that
[1:36:19] significant.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; It is.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; It is significant.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Rightly dividing is to teach the truth
[1:36:38] directly.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. and correctly.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; But it comes from a more comprehensive a
[1:36:45] word with a more comprehensive meaning
[1:36:48] and it is to cut but not just to cut but
[1:36:51] it is exact as it were. And the word
[1:36:54] they used is to keep hacking
[1:36:58] and brother Brandham uses the word
[1:36:59] chopping.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; And God took his prophets to chop his
[1:37:04] word
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; to chop his people out by his word. And
[1:37:09] quite frankly, some of us needed it to
[1:37:12] be chopped.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Not we as an individual, but the things
[1:37:15] that was hanging on to us. We needed to
[1:37:18] be chopped free.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And it says, "But shun profane and vain
[1:37:26] babblings, for they will increase unto
[1:37:28] more ungodliness, and their word will
[1:37:31] eat as doth a canker of whom is Himanius
[1:37:34] and Felitus." But who concerning the
[1:37:37] truth, now listen once again, who
[1:37:40] concerning the truth have aired,
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; saying the resurrection is passed
[1:37:48] already. Ah, this is very very
[1:37:51] important. I'm coming to now. So the
[1:37:54] truth can be absolute truth, but it must
[1:37:58] not be misplaced.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; The resurrection was truth. Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; It is truth.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; But they're they aired by saying it's
[1:38:09] already passed.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; We've had it in this day.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; We've had it in the message. Well,
[1:38:15] that's all passed. We don't need
[1:38:17] anything to do with it. And I would say,
[1:38:19] and I have had personal conversations. I
[1:38:20] said, "Where do you find that in the
[1:38:22] message?"
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Well, they couldn't really find in the
[1:38:25] message, but they were caught up in a in
[1:38:28] a in incredible revelation. Well, that's
[1:38:31] all passed and this is all finished.
[1:38:33] There's people that send me. You ought
[1:38:35] to see some of the stuff that I'm sent
[1:38:36] here to the office that we're already in
[1:38:39] the millennium.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry. If we're in the
[1:38:42] millennium, I don't think I want to go.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Do you?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; You want just more of this?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; No. The millennium, that's not what the
[1:38:53] prophet said,
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; but they will take this quote and that
[1:38:57] quote, and listen, there's nothing wrong
[1:38:59] with the quotes, but it's how they link
[1:39:01] them together. And by the time they tie
[1:39:03] this quote and that quote and you get to
[1:39:06] the end of their quotes, then you have a
[1:39:08] doctrine
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; that they're trying to put forward. But
[1:39:13] when you when you look at that doctrine,
[1:39:15] you cannot find it in the word of God.
[1:39:19] And you certainly won't find it in the
[1:39:21] message.
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; I've had people say in the message, "No
[1:39:28] more people can get saved." They said it
[1:39:31] to me, no more people can get saved.
[1:39:33] It's all over.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you that there's a good
[1:39:37] number of you that have come in since
[1:39:38] then.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; I have a book in my bookshelf that this
[1:39:45] whole thing's all wrapped up back in the
[1:39:47] they took, you know, the figures number
[1:39:50] 17 and the 17 this and 17 that and they
[1:39:53] worked it up. I don't see brother
[1:39:54] Brandham making anything big out of the
[1:39:56] number 17. But they they had it all
[1:39:58] figured out and it was all over.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Did they ever come and say, you know,
[1:40:05] Brother Biscll,
[1:40:07] I'm sorry.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; I want to repent over that.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Because I'll tell you what brother
[1:40:12] Brandham said. That's a that's a demon
[1:40:15] spirit
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; that tells you that something is going
[1:40:20] to be
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; and it's not there. You won't find it in
[1:40:23] the message,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; but they've taken this this this quote
[1:40:28] and that quote and and a few and even
[1:40:30] some even some sentences of brother Ben,
[1:40:33] they cut them right in half because the
[1:40:35] latter part of the half the latter part
[1:40:36] of the sentence doesn't fit. It may even
[1:40:38] go against what they're trying to bring
[1:40:40] forward. So, they just put the first
[1:40:42] half there. How many of you folks know
[1:40:43] what I'm talking about?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Sure, we're not ignorant. Those are
[1:40:48] Satan's devices to distract you from the
[1:40:52] truth
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; to some man's thoughts.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; I say I deny it.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; If it's not in the message, just deny
[1:41:00] it.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Say this is the way we're going or this
[1:41:03] is the way we worship or this. We want
[1:41:05] to find that in the word of God.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; The resurrection is truth.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But they'd misplaced it.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; And the and Apostle Paul says they've
[1:41:20] aired.
[1:41:22] They've aired concerning the truth,
[1:41:24] saying that the resurrection's already
[1:41:26] passed and it had a result. Listen to
[1:41:29] this. And overthrow the faith of some.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; So it had an effect.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And they were saying the resurre
[1:41:41] resurrection's over. And the people knew
[1:41:43] there had to be a resurrection. It's
[1:41:44] over. Yeah. And and and they had good
[1:41:47] reason to say it. This this isn't long.
[1:41:49] They were walking in the streets of
[1:41:51] Jerusalem. Our people saw them. It
[1:41:53] wasn't only Jesus that raised, but many
[1:41:55] were seen in the streets of Jerusalem.
[1:41:57] The resurrection is passed.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; That's who the resurrection's passed.
[1:42:04] You know what also was the problem?
[1:42:07] They were not the messenger.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Paul was the messenger.
[1:42:12] So they were trying to bring something
[1:42:14] that Paul wasn't saying.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; You know, we all have our opinions.
[1:42:24] Well, opinions are fine. That's okay.
[1:42:28] Doctrines and special revelations, etc.
[1:42:30] that divide in the message, not what the
[1:42:34] prophet said. Then if it's not what the
[1:42:36] prophet said, then just forget it.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Just forget it. Leave it.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with saying I'm going to
[1:42:44] stay with what he said?
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with a quote that he said,
[1:42:50] "Say what the message says. Say what the
[1:42:53] tape says."
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "Why am I putting so much emphasis
[1:42:59] on that?" I'll tell you why right now.
[1:43:02] I'm coming to it.
[1:43:05] Because brother Brandham said,
[1:43:08] and he said it many times, now listen,
[1:43:11] you're here as believers of this
[1:43:13] message.
[1:43:15] Here's the source of this message.
[1:43:18] A vessel that would stand there and say,
[1:43:23] now I've preached,
[1:43:25] if he doesn't come now
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; and prove what I've said
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; as being the truth,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; he said, then you don't believe me.
[1:43:35] Isn't that nice?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I can't say that, but I can say I'm
[1:43:39] hanging on as tight as I can
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; to what he said.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; I've asked all kinds of believers, did
[1:43:47] brother Brandham say that?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Well, no. They can't really find it, but
[1:43:52] this is their conviction. This is their
[1:43:53] opinion. This is so Why don't we stay
[1:43:56] with what he said?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And if you can't find it there, forget
[1:44:00] it. Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I say that
[1:44:05] because that's not him speaking. That's
[1:44:07] Jesus Christ speaking to the bride
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; to give you instruction for the hour
[1:44:12] that you're in.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] [Music]
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; I said earlier that in the original
[1:44:25] creation,
[1:44:27] every seed was to bring forth after its
[1:44:29] own kind. Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; From the plant life, botney life to the
[1:44:34] sea and the creatures of the earth. And
[1:44:37] then God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:44:39] image and in our likeness and every seed
[1:44:43] brought forth after its own kind.
[1:44:46] Whatever is planted, that's what is
[1:44:49] harvested."
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; But then, Brother Brandon puts it
[1:44:52] another way. He puts it cell upon cell.
[1:44:57] Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And now he's coming into something that
[1:45:00] really speaks to our new body and speaks
[1:45:04] to
[1:45:06] our life that we have even right now.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; So he says, "And if you were ordained
[1:45:11] from the beginning of the earth
[1:45:14] to that word,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen."
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; I want everybody's attention. If you
[1:45:20] were ordained
[1:45:22] from the beginning
[1:45:26] to that word, if you were if you were
[1:45:30] ordained to this message, ordained to
[1:45:33] that word,
[1:45:34] every word will come right on top of the
[1:45:39] word.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:41] If you were ordained from the beginning,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; with a seed of God,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; the gene or the germ of God in you,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; every word, because that is word, every
[1:45:53] word of God for this season that you
[1:45:56] need will come on top of that word
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; because it has to build a body
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; in the rapture. He said, "You didn't
[1:46:06] become a human germ from your father and
[1:46:09] then the next thing you become a germ
[1:46:11] from a dog
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; or the next thing from a cat or the next
[1:46:15] thing from a chicken." It was all human
[1:46:19] germs.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; So, this is a powerful spiritual truth.
[1:46:23] The very fact that you're sitting here,
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; you're either sitting here filling a
[1:46:27] seat or you're sitting here because God
[1:46:29] called you. And if God called you, then
[1:46:32] for sure I can say God put a word in you
[1:46:35] from the before the beginning.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And what you're here for is so that
[1:46:39] another cell can come on top of that. So
[1:46:42] that the word of God that has come by
[1:46:45] the messenger will come to that word.
[1:46:48] And word will come upon word until
[1:46:50] you're transformed into the very
[1:46:52] likeness of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:55] And that's why we're called the body of
[1:46:58] Jesus Christ. That's how that body is
[1:47:01] built.
[1:47:04] [Music]
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; He said it's all human germ.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And then he carries on
[1:47:10] and I have this highlighted red and
[1:47:13] yellow.
[1:47:15] And the body of Jesus Christ, the bride
[1:47:18] will be part of his body.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; So now his body is a word body. Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; His body is made up of individuals such
[1:47:29] as you.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet says you are
[1:47:32] word.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; We are word in flesh.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; How do we know
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; that we have the truth? Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I can tell you I would have a big
[1:47:45] problem with the message
[1:47:48] if it didn't have
[1:47:51] the degree,
[1:47:52] the power, the indescribable proof
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; that it was God.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; If I didn't have that messenger standing
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; over and over and over again. If he
[1:48:06] doesn't come and confirm what I've said
[1:48:09] as being the truth, then you forget what
[1:48:12] I've said.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Just go home.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; I like that kind of a preacher.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; I like that kind of a voice.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Because he's saying it doesn't matter
[1:48:25] that all these people been healed. It
[1:48:27] doesn't matter that all these miracles
[1:48:29] have taken place. It takes more than
[1:48:31] miracles. We're not born again by signs
[1:48:34] and wonders. We're born again by the
[1:48:37] incorruptible word of God. So, how do we
[1:48:40] know? Now, that's a nice phrase that I
[1:48:42] can say because it's in the Bible. How
[1:48:43] do you know you're born of the
[1:48:45] incorruptible word of God?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Because you must be able to confess,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; I have received
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; all that he has said.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; All that he has said. Thank you.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when we get right down
[1:49:12] to really where we live, it can be very
[1:49:14] quiet.
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:19] But the sisters
[1:49:21] in the congregation
[1:49:24] need to be able to say, "My husband is
[1:49:28] the head of my home
[1:49:32] and he is the one that is to hear from
[1:49:34] God
[1:49:37] and he is the priest of the home."
[1:49:40] The husbands have to be able to say
[1:49:43] according to that same word, I have
[1:49:46] assumed that responsibility.
[1:49:49] I am the spiritual head of this home.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to say to my children,
[1:49:55] "Walk in father's footsteps."
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And do as your mother and father do.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to say, "I care for my
[1:50:04] people. I care for my family. I care for
[1:50:06] my children." That's the husband's
[1:50:08] responsibility.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Those are Is that in the message?
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; That gets down to where we live, doesn't
[1:50:15] it? And to you children and you young
[1:50:18] people, in order to say, "I'm a believer
[1:50:21] of this message,"
[1:50:23] you have to be able to say, "I honor my
[1:50:25] father and my mother."
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I honor them.
[1:50:31] My dad and I, we disagreed on some
[1:50:34] points.
[1:50:37] We disagreed, but I never never ceased
[1:50:40] to honor him.
[1:50:42] That's my father. That's my dad. I had
[1:50:45] perfect sinners, total unbelievers, come
[1:50:48] up and say, "I wish we had the kind of
[1:50:51] relationship that you have with your
[1:50:54] dad." It isn't that dad said, "Well,
[1:50:57] this is the way it is and that's the way
[1:50:58] it is." And I said, "Yes, father. Yes,
[1:50:59] father. Yes, father." That wasn't the
[1:51:01] relationship. I honored him as father.
[1:51:05] And and and he honored me as son. And we
[1:51:08] had a wonderful, wonderful relationship.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] I made mistakes,
[1:51:16] but I was still his son. He made
[1:51:19] mistakes and he was still my father.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; But whether I made a mistake or he made
[1:51:24] a mistake, it never changed the level of
[1:51:27] honor.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I honored him
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; because that was the only dad I ever had
[1:51:32] and will have on this earth. And I
[1:51:34] honored him.
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean if he said, "Now I came into
[1:51:40] the message." He didn't come into the
[1:51:42] message. I gave him the church age book.
[1:51:45] He didn't rejoice in it as I rejoiced in
[1:51:47] it. That did not change my honor for
[1:51:50] him.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; But we walked different paths.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; But we were we there was no animosity
[1:51:57] between us,
[1:52:00] wonderful, loving relationship.
[1:52:03] And I just thought, well, maybe it's not
[1:52:05] for his age. Maybe maybe God is not
[1:52:08] going to reveal it to him.
[1:52:11] God is sovereign in his revelation.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; I just dropped that in because to let
[1:52:17] you know that we're all human here.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; In the message leadership and
[1:52:28] incidentally, listen close as his last
[1:52:31] message,
[1:52:33] brother's last message.
[1:52:35] He said, ' And when a man has been born
[1:52:37] again by the word of God,
[1:52:41] not by his emotion or having a, you
[1:52:43] know, you know, running to the altar and
[1:52:45] maybe spilling tears on the altar, all
[1:52:47] of that is fine. But when he's been born
[1:52:49] again by the word of God, predestinated
[1:52:53] to eternal life called the elected,
[1:52:56] it'll be word of God on top of word of
[1:52:59] God, word on word. Amen.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; It won't be a man's idea or some other
[1:53:04] doctrine or something else or somebody's
[1:53:06] else's revelation. It'll be word upon
[1:53:09] word. Word upon word.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; That's how the body is built up. So it's
[1:53:14] vindicated, proven word coming for you
[1:53:18] as the word coming upon word. Word upon
[1:53:21] word. The germ that was in you, he said
[1:53:24] in the invisible union, the germ that
[1:53:26] was in you found you.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The germ that was in you at
[1:53:33] the beginning found you.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it wasn't me just finding God,
[1:53:38] but the germ that was in you and in me.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That germ found us.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Are we still all right for time?
[1:53:51] Hallelujah.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:53:59] I thought of a lot about this and I saw
[1:54:00] it a little different because I pondered
[1:54:03] and had to think about it.
[1:54:07] You know, Brother Brandham, he speaks in
[1:54:10] in in different layers.
[1:54:13] He'll talk about one layer and he'll
[1:54:15] talk about natural seed.
[1:54:19] And then he'll talk about what it
[1:54:21] produces.
[1:54:22] Then he'll talk about spiritual seed.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; And he'll talk about what it produces.
[1:54:28] And he just keeps peeling one layer off
[1:54:29] of another off another. That's why I
[1:54:32] said he was talking about the cell in
[1:54:34] the womb of the mother. And he goes over
[1:54:35] and over and over. And he said that, you
[1:54:37] know, it can't be one cell a dog and one
[1:54:39] cell a cat and one cell a human. So he
[1:54:41] goes over and over. Now in in this case
[1:54:45] now he starts talking about the food
[1:54:48] that you and I eat.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; And you go down and I've had to you know
[1:54:54] because I and my wife the age we are and
[1:54:56] everything we we become more conscious.
[1:54:57] I never used to pay attention to the
[1:54:59] labels. I see people reading labels. I
[1:55:02] thought oh my goodness they're wasting
[1:55:03] their time. Now I'm studying the labels.
[1:55:07] How many calories does Oh high in
[1:55:10] cholesterol. Oh is that right? Oh, this
[1:55:12] has got sugar in it. This got three
[1:55:14] teaspoons of sugar. My wife said this
[1:55:16] morning. What?
[1:55:18] I don't believe that.
[1:55:21] Do you know why I didn't believe it? Cuz
[1:55:23] my taste wanted what he was saying I
[1:55:25] shouldn't have.
[1:55:30] So says, "No, if you have it that way,
[1:55:31] it'll be three teaspoons of sugar. You
[1:55:34] can only you can only have one." Brother
[1:55:38] Mike and Sister Debbie, I admire you.
[1:55:41] you you really
[1:55:43] I mean you really took a control of this
[1:55:46] thing and uh and so anyway she says I
[1:55:51] said well you know now I'd already
[1:55:53] studied and I had my studies done pretty
[1:55:55] well but brother Bram talks so much
[1:55:58] about hybrid food
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; and he says I came past a a a field of
[1:56:06] corn I said beautiful
[1:56:10] corn he is all hybrid.
[1:56:12] Said there's no life in it. There's no
[1:56:14] life in it.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Little statement. No life in it.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; We just pump ourselves full, but there's
[1:56:20] no life in it.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And that is why, you know, we get sickly
[1:56:27] and feeling the way because we're eating
[1:56:29] ourselves to death.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Right. That's true.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; And then, you know, we could become
[1:56:34] fanatics and all the rest of that's why
[1:56:36] we bless the food
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; because we haven't got control of all of
[1:56:39] it. Exactly.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; But then he says he he he he came past a
[1:56:44] field and
[1:56:46] it was just original corn
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; and he and and uh it didn't look near as
[1:56:52] nice,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:56:55] But then he talked about this hybrid
[1:56:57] stuff and he says when they try to have
[1:57:02] it produce again, now notice he doesn't
[1:57:05] say it can't produce. He said it can't
[1:57:08] reproduce itself back
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; once it's hybrid and you have a hybrid
[1:57:14] corn from the hybrid corn you can never
[1:57:17] make original corn again.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; It isn't that you know that it won't
[1:57:24] that you eat hybrid stuff and you get
[1:57:26] some strength and live from it. But he
[1:57:28] said that this is what he said and I'll
[1:57:31] give you a quote in a few minutes. He
[1:57:33] said and it was a real revelation to me.
[1:57:36] He said that the he saw the stuff that
[1:57:39] they tried to reproduce and it was all
[1:57:41] dwarf.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; It was dwarfed
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't looking good when they
[1:57:48] were trying to have it produce itself.
[1:57:52] It was all dwarfed. And I thought, and I
[1:57:55] put down my notes, you know, Brother
[1:57:58] Brandham preaches hybrid religion.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; And the people may look fine and nice,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; but inside
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; there's a spiritual dwarf,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; all twisted up
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; because it cannot produce itself. And he
[1:58:16] said, "That's why when they fell into
[1:58:18] denominationalism,
[1:58:20] they never could reproduce themselves
[1:58:22] back again.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; They could never come out of it again."
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "We have things today that did
[1:58:32] not begin in Genesis."
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; So we have things today, your
[1:58:37] supermarket is filled with things today
[1:58:39] that didn't begin in Genesis. He said,
[1:58:43] "Because it's been hybrid,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; and anything hybrid is a phony,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; it's no good. It cannot reproduce
[1:58:51] itself. Anything that's hybrid is
[1:58:54] man-made and cannot bring itself back
[1:58:58] again."
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; And that is why friends
[1:59:01] I am I I I I want to conclude this
[1:59:04] message, but not yet for a few moments.
[1:59:06] It is absolutely critical.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; We cannot hybrid the message. say,
[1:59:11] "Well, the message says this, but you
[1:59:14] know, I think this."
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Well, how are we going to inject what
[1:59:18] you think, I think, somebody else thinks
[1:59:20] into the message? If if God speaks to
[1:59:23] you in a certain way and you're to
[1:59:25] conduct yourself in a certain way, fine.
[1:59:27] As long as you live godly and live
[1:59:29] according to the whole council of the
[1:59:31] word of God. But if if if something
[1:59:34] comes to you that is directing you in
[1:59:36] another way outside of the word of God,
[1:59:40] then I can tell you friends, then it's
[1:59:42] being injected. It becomes hybrid.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; In the end time seed sign.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; You like to just bear with me a moment
[1:59:51] because I'm determined to pound this
[1:59:53] through.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "And that's the way that people
[1:59:58] gets away from the word of God." Oh,
[2:00:01] this is the way people get away from the
[2:00:04] word of God.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Could he possibly be talking even to
[2:00:08] believers? I guess so. How can you get
[2:00:11] away from the word of God if you weren't
[2:00:13] with the word of God?
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; So, he's talking to believers. This is
[2:00:16] how people get away from the word of
[2:00:19] God.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; It becomes a hybrid affair.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; So, they don't throw the word of God
[2:00:25] out.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; They inject something to go with it.
[2:00:32] It must die. It cannot bring forth of
[2:00:35] its own kind of life again. The church
[2:00:38] that will refuse to believe the word of
[2:00:40] God is a hybrid church with dogmas,
[2:00:43] creeds, doctrines that's not scriptural.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; They may have he also said that the lie
[2:00:51] that Satan told Eve in the beginning, do
[2:00:53] you know what he said about that lie?
[2:00:55] 99%
[2:00:57] truth.
[2:00:59] Say amen to that.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; 99%
[2:01:02] truth.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; It was the 1%
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; that brought Satan's Eden that you and I
[2:01:08] are living in.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Think of that 1% because it was injected
[2:01:13] into the truth.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; 99% truth. We don't want 99% truth. I
[2:01:20] want to have a word that God came behind
[2:01:23] and confirmed. And that is why I read I
[2:01:27] read what brother Brandham I read after
[2:01:30] and you want to do that or you want to
[2:01:32] listen afterward where he said if what
[2:01:34] I've spoken is the truth and in in uh uh
[2:01:38] uh this days of scripture fulfilled.
[2:01:42] We've got the if you haven't seen it you
[2:01:44] need to see brother Charlie Mitchell's
[2:01:47] uh message. Incidentally his testimony
[2:01:50] incidentally brothers Charlie Mitchell
[2:01:52] he was dying. He was given about a month
[2:01:54] to live and he had a cancer the size
[2:01:57] tumor the size of a man's fist in his
[2:01:59] lung and he was just standing at the
[2:02:01] back and didn't think he'd even get up
[2:02:03] to the front. Brother Brandham called
[2:02:04] him out and told him exactly what had
[2:02:06] happened and that he had was going to
[2:02:08] have this operation. He has since gone
[2:02:10] on to be with the Lord. He became a
[2:02:12] pastor of a church he worked at. And
[2:02:14] brother Brandham says, "You have," he
[2:02:16] even stresses that you have been a
[2:02:19] minor.
[2:02:20] And that's exactly right. As far as
[2:02:23] brother Mitchell was concerned, he was a
[2:02:25] minor. And here the prophet is actually
[2:02:27] prophesying in that first statement. You
[2:02:30] have been a minor because he never went
[2:02:32] back to be a minor. He became a pastor.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; And just a few few days ago, I
[2:02:39] understand just shortly his son-in-law
[2:02:42] who took over his church, he has passed
[2:02:44] away. So they said, "Pray for the
[2:02:45] church." But in that message, brother
[2:02:48] Brandham says, "Let the God who gave the
[2:02:52] word."
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Let the God who spoke the word,
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; if he is God, let him come now.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger I like to
[2:03:02] hear.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Let him come now. and and and prove that
[2:03:07] he's God.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Just go to your computer, young people,
[2:03:10] and put in a and prove it.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; God proved it.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Or let him come forward and vindicate
[2:03:18] it.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; You put those words in, you'll be
[2:03:21] surprised all through the ministry.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, you say, "Well, that's
[2:03:25] first pull, second pull." Listen, this
[2:03:28] this this vindicates a third pull.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's what authenticated him. That's
[2:03:35] what that was his authentication
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; that he was the one to come with the
[2:03:40] word and that is why we believe that
[2:03:43] word
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; not for the signs and the wonders not
[2:03:46] because Charlie Mitchell was healed but
[2:03:48] because God
[2:03:50] [Applause]
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; came in behind
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; and said you're from this city or you're
[2:03:55] from that place. Never never lose never
[2:03:58] lose your appreciation
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; and thanksgiving
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; that God who didn't have to do it
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; listen did it in your season
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; and folks if I could come right down to
[2:04:15] your seat and speak in your ear I would
[2:04:17] tell you he did it in your season
[2:04:19] because you would need it in this season
[2:04:22] and you would need to know you would
[2:04:24] need to know absolute wrote
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; that this came from God because he said,
[2:04:31] "Who can do that? I can't do that. I'm
[2:04:33] your brother." Who did she touch? Who
[2:04:35] did he touch? Why am I saying this over
[2:04:38] and over and over again? Because God is
[2:04:40] confirming
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; that this is God speaking
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; so that we who believe it would know
[2:04:48] that word is to come. Word upon word
[2:04:51] upon word.
[2:04:53] It is the fact that you're being pulled
[2:04:56] that give proves that you were
[2:04:58] predestinated from the beginning. If you
[2:05:01] weren't predestinated from the
[2:05:02] beginning, that word wouldn't mean
[2:05:04] anything to you.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope I can pound that down. And if
[2:05:09] you come here and hear the word of God
[2:05:10] and say, "That doesn't mean anything to
[2:05:12] me." Well, then
[2:05:15] in all likelihood, there's no seed down
[2:05:17] there.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; But if you can say, "Something gets a
[2:05:20] hold of me. Something speaks to me.
[2:05:22] Maybe you're not as emotional as others.
[2:05:25] Maybe you're not demonstrative as
[2:05:26] others. But there's something down
[2:05:27] inside says, "I believe that."
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; I hear I hear Brother Vanom when he's
[2:05:34] speaking to some of the deepest sinners
[2:05:37] and and people who are so grossly sick.
[2:05:40] But he'll just say, "Do you believe
[2:05:41] that, sister? Do you believe that,
[2:05:43] brother?"
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; And they don't jump up and have a great
[2:05:46] hallelujah, thunder, and lightning time.
[2:05:48] They just say, "Yes." And you know what
[2:05:50] he says? God bless you.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:05:55] and I say to you today,
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; you believe that this message come from
[2:05:59] God?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; I can say God bless you.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You have something inside that's saying
[2:06:08] yes.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, I believe it.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, I receive it.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it, but yes, it is
[2:06:16] for me.
[2:06:18] God bless you.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; And there's something there trying to
[2:06:21] cloud you and keep you back. That's the
[2:06:23] devil.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; And you deny him.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Satan, I rebuke you. I've
[2:06:28] been made for this word.
[2:06:32] [Applause]
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to receive it. That's why I'm
[2:06:37] preaching. I want you to be better. I
[2:06:39] want you to be strengthened.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You tell him he's a liar.
[2:06:54] Some here that I know need to say that
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; right now. You say, "Satan, you're a
[2:06:59] liar.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; You're a liar.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; You're trying to put that question and
[2:07:07] that doubt on me. You're trying to cloud
[2:07:09] my life. I resist you."
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Why do you say it? Because the absolute
[2:07:14] says resist him.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; And it says he will flee from you.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; That's says the word of God.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; You now it'll take a different meaning
[2:07:30] for you after hearing me speak this
[2:07:32] long. You shall know the truth
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; and the truth shall make you free.
[2:07:41] And whom the son Luke 17:30
[2:07:46] whom the revealed son Revelation 10:1
[2:07:49] whom the son that son sets free is free
[2:07:54] indeed.
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; That's his word.
[2:08:02] [Applause]
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:07] [Applause]
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; We sing the song, the original life.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; The original word.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is the original life.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; In the message and you might put a note
[2:08:28] down, condemnation by representation.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; He said everything becomes a hybrid.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; But did you know that it's no good? It
[2:08:38] has no life in it. It cannot reproduce
[2:08:41] itself again.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; You You can't plant hybrid corn. If you
[2:08:45] do, you'll just get a little dwarf field
[2:08:49] because it's been hybrid.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; The world is the field.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; And you're going to walk out of this
[2:08:57] church this morning. You'll find fine
[2:08:59] people as far as their physique is
[2:09:01] concerned, as far as their
[2:09:05] exterior appearance is concerned, you'll
[2:09:08] find perhaps handsome and fine and
[2:09:09] lovely young ladies and families and
[2:09:13] ordinarylooking people. But
[2:09:17] I have I have had occasion and there's
[2:09:20] places in the message where brother
[2:09:23] Brandham begins to speak about the soul
[2:09:27] of the people.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And he begins to describe it said you
[2:09:32] you look in the mirror and see yourself
[2:09:35] the way you are. But he says
[2:09:39] your soul.
[2:09:41] How is your soul?
[2:09:43] I want my soul to be in better shape
[2:09:45] than my body.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; I want my soul to be strong.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Your soul to be strong, friends.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; I said it just brings a a dwarf field
[2:09:59] because it's been hybrid. He said he
[2:10:02] gave another place in the same message.
[2:10:04] He gave the Holy Ghost to the
[2:10:06] Pentecostals back there on the day of
[2:10:09] Pentecost. But that's not for us today.
[2:10:13] He said a hybrid faith condemned by God.
[2:10:17] Hybrid. No good. Stay away from it. For
[2:10:20] it's evil. What he's talking about. He
[2:10:22] wasn't talking about the baptism of the
[2:10:23] Holy Ghost was no good. He was talking
[2:10:25] about what they did with it. What did
[2:10:27] the Pentecostals do with it? They
[2:10:30] denominated. And listen, you know what?
[2:10:32] You know what the messenger said about
[2:10:34] the prophet, about his own life? He
[2:10:36] said, "The prophet comes and then they
[2:10:39] make a tradition
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; out of his life."
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; We're not here to make a tradition out
[2:10:48] of Brother Brandham's life.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; We're here to declare that was the
[2:10:52] highest order that God could send, the
[2:10:55] highest office that he could send. And I
[2:10:58] am prepared to say what came out of his
[2:11:00] mouth
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; was truth.
[2:11:05] Even when my own mind and maybe your own
[2:11:07] thoughts don't agree 100%. You lay them
[2:11:10] aside. But what he spoke is the truth.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Regardless of how you feel,
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; you feel so dry. You feel so far away
[2:11:22] from God. You feel whatever you might
[2:11:25] feel. But if you will agree and confess
[2:11:30] his word, one thing is sure. If it's the
[2:11:33] truth, it will produce a deliverance for
[2:11:36] you.
[2:11:38] [Music]
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; It will produce it.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; God's word can't lie. The truth shall
[2:11:46] make you free.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; And we have so many things. We have so
[2:11:50] many things weighing us down this day.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; So many things
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; we need to be set free from.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be just, you know,
[2:12:00] happy in church. We want to be able to
[2:12:02] go out of here and find out if this
[2:12:03] thing works.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; We got to be another few minutes.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Only one service today.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Listen very very close.
[2:12:22] Brother Brandham makes a statement
[2:12:24] sometime we think we understand it. Like
[2:12:27] I just said about hybrid said it can't
[2:12:29] reproduce itself back. Some think that
[2:12:31] well it can't produce anything. No, it
[2:12:33] produces something but it's dwarfed.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; It's twisted and that hybrid can never
[2:12:38] come back to the to its original.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; But then he says something else. He said
[2:12:45] because I'm thinking of the lie in the
[2:12:46] beginning. This is in my mind and I went
[2:12:50] back to it over these last days over and
[2:12:52] over and over.
[2:12:55] And I know he said that a lie is the
[2:12:59] truth.
[2:13:02] The a lie is the truth misrepresented.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; It's not just a lie that has been
[2:13:14] conjured up and devised. I'll tell him a
[2:13:18] lie. Satan, he's too smart for that.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; A lie. He takes the truth
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; and he just adjusts it
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; and then presents that
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; because the intent is so that you will
[2:13:34] believe a lie.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care how you get the lie. He
[2:13:39] doesn't care what you believe as long as
[2:13:41] you don't believe the truth.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; You want to really think that one over?
[2:13:50] It's the truth misrepresented.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; So it's the truth that's presented, but
[2:13:56] it's misrepresented.
[2:13:58] It's just tainted a wee bit.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; And the intent of tainting it, the
[2:14:08] intent of just injecting something in it
[2:14:13] is to get you to believe a lie.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't care. You might believe
[2:14:18] one lie. I might believe a different
[2:14:20] lie. Someone else believes a different
[2:14:21] lie. But it all came from the same
[2:14:23] source.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; And the source was the truth. 99% truth
[2:14:29] was just an something injected so that
[2:14:32] it could be misrepresented.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Misrepresented is this.
[2:14:47] Is everyone listening?
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; To give an inaccurate
[2:14:55] something inaccurate,
[2:14:58] it's not accurate.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; But it's being presented to you so that
[2:15:07] they don't care or he doesn't care what
[2:15:10] you believe
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; as long as you don't believe the truth.
[2:15:22] 99% truth. The prophet said, you know,
[2:15:27] just just listen real close, friends.
[2:15:29] 99% truth
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; isn't good enough,
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Because it's the 1% that brought on
[2:15:38] Satan's Eden.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; It's the 1% that will keep a person
[2:15:42] still bound. It's the 1% that will allow
[2:15:46] your life to be clouded
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; and to twist you all up. We cannot allow
[2:15:51] 1%.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Say, "How do we know?" Then then this
[2:15:55] gets very serious, Brother Ed. That's
[2:15:57] exactly right. And that is why I poured
[2:15:59] over this service, poured over this
[2:16:01] message. How can I know, Brother Ed, if
[2:16:03] you and I were sitting across the table
[2:16:05] from one another, you'd say, "How can I
[2:16:07] know?" I'd say the only way that I can
[2:16:10] know and the only thing that I can do
[2:16:12] for I, my wife, my home is what did God
[2:16:17] confirm.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; What did God come by? I I'm not
[2:16:21] interested how loud a man preached. I'm
[2:16:24] not I'm not interested in how much he
[2:16:26] thumped or ran back and forth in the
[2:16:28] congregation. I want to know, did God
[2:16:31] come in behind it and confirm this is me
[2:16:35] speaking?
[2:16:37] This isn't this man William Brham. This
[2:16:39] is me speaking. And that is why I hang
[2:16:42] on to that word so close,
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; so tight.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; And when winds would blow and to move us
[2:16:51] off course, you hang. This is my counsel
[2:16:54] to you. If it was my last service, hang
[2:16:57] all the closer to what God confirmed.
[2:17:00] Amen.
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hold to it with all your strength.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Hang right on to it. I can tell one
[2:17:11] thing that is truth.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Are you weary?
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Give me another moment.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Why do you think brother Bradam said to
[2:17:25] these people hundreds of times, is that
[2:17:28] the truth? Is that the truth about
[2:17:31] simple things? We don't know each other.
[2:17:34] Is that the truth?
[2:17:36] You have a you have a a you have
[2:17:40] something wrong with your throat. Is
[2:17:42] that the truth? And often God would
[2:17:45] direct him in such a way so that it
[2:17:49] would actually encourage some who wanted
[2:17:52] to doubt to doubt. Wanted to criticize
[2:17:55] to criticize. It actually opened the
[2:17:57] door for the critics. That's true.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my husband.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; And then he'd say, "So that you might
[2:18:06] know that this is the truth.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; I see you coming,
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; driving in a car
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; and you're not from here. You're from
[2:18:16] Ohio and you're from a town called this
[2:18:19] or something else." We're not caught up.
[2:18:22] We're not trying to duplicate that. That
[2:18:24] is the proof.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because then we don't belittle
[2:18:28] that because that was God.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; That was the creator.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; That was the one who even brought this
[2:18:35] whole earth into existence.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; That was the one who could create
[2:18:39] squirrels.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; That was the one who could create fish
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; in Peter's time.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Cast your net on this side.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; He knew how to catch a whole lot of
[2:18:51] fish.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; I'm saying amen myself cuz I believe it
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; with everything that's in me.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; And then when you know he said it,
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; hang on to that.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; You might say this is a simple message,
[2:19:07] brother Bis. Why are you saying it? You
[2:19:09] know why I'm saying it? Because this
[2:19:10] congregation needs it.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; If you know the prophet of God said it,
[2:19:16] then you hang on to it. It's not what
[2:19:19] somebody said that he said, it's what he
[2:19:21] said that he said.
[2:19:23] and let God's word come to God's word,
[2:19:26] word upon word upon word to build you an
[2:19:30] eternal home that you can go to. Do you
[2:19:32] realize
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; he said that God will call some preacher
[2:19:37] behind the pullpit
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; to preach the message
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; because your body,
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; your body, your eternal hope is calling
[2:19:46] for it.
[2:19:48] Hallelujah.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; The very thing that you're hearing today
[2:19:51] is a result of somebody's eternal hope.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; You might even be sitting here not
[2:19:57] realizing, but your theophony is calling
[2:20:00] for this message. And your theophony is
[2:20:03] saying, "Stay with the word. Stay with
[2:20:06] the word."
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; That's what your theophony is saying.
[2:20:12] Stay with it. Cuz that's what he's made
[2:20:15] up of. That's the real you.
[2:20:19] [Applause]
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:20:28] Glory to God.
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:20:43] [Music]
[2:20:46] Hallelujah.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; There's a million ways.
[2:21:07] There's a million ways to become injured
[2:21:10] or to become crippled or to become blind
[2:21:13] or
[2:21:16] million ways to become afflicted
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; spiritually, mentally.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Million ways to become oppressed and
[2:21:25] depressed.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; It's a million things for you to worry
[2:21:29] about and be concerned about
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; in this life.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; A million things. A million ways.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; There's only one way for you to be free.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Whom the son.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Not whom the history
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; and not whom what we think of him in the
[2:21:49] future, but whom the son, the revealed
[2:21:53] son of God,
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; whom the son sets free,
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; whom this word sets free,
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; shall be free indeed.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; This this truth hung on Calvary. This
[2:22:05] truth crushed your enemy's head.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; I'm announcing to you today that Satan,
[2:22:13] that serpent, the old devil, has been
[2:22:15] defeated and rendered helpless
[2:22:19] by this truth. By this one, truth hung
[2:22:23] on Calvary. It was truth that defeated
[2:22:26] Satan. And if truth defeated him back
[2:22:28] there, it's truth that'll defeat him
[2:22:31] right here.
[2:22:33] I want you to be able to say, Satan,
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the truth.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; I'm a product of the truth.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; I am in the truth for Christ.
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; And you cannot be a participant of
[2:22:51] truth.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. Think of it for a
[2:22:57] moment. When he the truth came,
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; he said he's full of grace and full of
[2:23:03] truth.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; It was truth that came. Why? He had to
[2:23:08] undo
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; the lie.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; In the beginning,
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; he came to undo the lie.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; In the beginning,
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; he came out of the bosom of the father.
[2:23:23] Truth proceeded
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; from God. Jesus didn't need it. You
[2:23:29] needed it.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; You and I need it.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; This generation needs it.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Don't be Don't be distracted. Don't be
[2:23:38] derailed. This is a message for this
[2:23:41] hour and for this season.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; And as I said, if this would be my last
[2:23:45] message, I would say to you,
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; you hang tight. We tighten up closer and
[2:23:51] closer and closer to that word. You see
[2:23:53] people straying or going off on their
[2:23:55] own way or going off on their own die on
[2:23:58] their own desires. You stay right with
[2:24:01] the word.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; And by that I'm not saying and don't be
[2:24:05] mis don't misunderstand me. I'm not
[2:24:07] saying you stay with me. You stay with
[2:24:10] the message
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; of the hour.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:14] [Applause]
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise wonderful name of God
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; I do not believe in being moved
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; because of my loved ones
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; or my family
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; or my children
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; I said in the log church if my children
[2:24:36] refuse to you you believe this message
[2:24:38] and want to follow it anymore I said
[2:24:40] there's the doors
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; I still feel that way
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; when I came into this message friend
[2:24:46] there was none of my family in this
[2:24:48] message.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; None of it. In fact, they all forsook.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; They all stayed away.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; You're quiet.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; That's the message that I believe.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; Not hard, not harsh, not for a moment.
[2:25:07] Loving, caring. But the only the only
[2:25:10] solution the only solution for friends,
[2:25:13] family or whoever is to make sure number
[2:25:16] one that you and I
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; are fixed
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; fixed unmovable
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; upon that word
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; and if you don't have a full revelation
[2:25:29] say God reveal to me
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; that's why this messenger says to us
[2:25:35] says to all of us we'll never be able to
[2:25:38] know what how important revelation is to
[2:25:41] us.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Revelation is life.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; If you are argued into something or
[2:25:48] convinced into something that won't do
[2:25:51] any good because it'll con somebody can
[2:25:53] convince you out of it.
[2:25:55] But when when you have a revelation
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; that is you
[2:26:02] [Applause]
[2:26:08] [Music]
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:20] [Music]
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:26] Just want to see if there's anything I
[2:26:27] should be saying before I close.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe not everybody had asked
[2:26:37] or asks about the truth, wants to
[2:26:39] receive the truth.
[2:26:48] Pilate therefore said unto him, "Art
[2:26:51] thou a king?" Then
[2:26:54] Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I'm a
[2:26:56] king. To this end was I born, and for
[2:27:00] this cause came I into the world, that I
[2:27:03] should bear witness unto the truth.
[2:27:06] Everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[2:27:10] voice."
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that clear? Amen.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that an intelligent man
[2:27:15] as Pilate needed anything further?
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Why would anybody need anything more?
[2:27:22] Are you a king? This is why I came into
[2:27:24] the world. I came into the world to bear
[2:27:26] witness of the truth.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; And everyone who is of the truth, of the
[2:27:31] truth, will hear my voice.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; And Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"
[2:27:36] And when he had said this, he went out
[2:27:38] again unto the Jews
[2:27:41] and said unto them, I find no fault at
[2:27:44] all. Actually, he went out there and and
[2:27:47] and sentenced himself.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; He condemned himself.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; He went back out to the Jews after that
[2:27:55] kind of a statement.
[2:27:59] Isn't it amazing
[2:28:02] that students of the word,
[2:28:08] students of the scripture
[2:28:11] managed to get enough said against him.
[2:28:19] They didn't tell lies about him.
[2:28:24] They just misrepresented what he said.
[2:28:26] Right.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; The truth.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Destroy this temple. In three
[2:28:32] days, I'll raise it up."
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they go back to him and say,
[2:28:38] "What did you mean?"
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? They didn't want to
[2:28:44] know what he meant.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Think about it. They didn't want to know
[2:28:52] what he meant. They wanted to take what
[2:28:54] he said and just misrepresent it.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; And so they said he said that he'll
[2:29:00] destroy this temple and raise it up
[2:29:03] again.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; And the manner in which they said it
[2:29:07] caused the people to disbelieve Christ.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; And so it wasn't lies that really sent
[2:29:16] him to the cross. It was exactly what
[2:29:19] Satan did in Eden. He simply
[2:29:22] misrepresented
[2:29:23] what had been said. And that's why he
[2:29:26] said, "Hath God said?"
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; That's the same. Why should I preach
[2:29:35] this? Because that's what he always
[2:29:37] does. Amen.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Had a young man in Idaho
[2:29:52] right near where you're going, Brother
[2:29:55] Adam, just a few miles, Nampa, Meridian.
[2:30:01] And brother Adam was real shocked to
[2:30:04] find out Boisey was the first city that
[2:30:07] I spoke in. We started doing
[2:30:10] evangelistic work in the states. Boisey,
[2:30:12] the whole Boisee Valley and Nampa and
[2:30:14] Meridian and and Brother Roberts died in
[2:30:18] his 90s. Still a Pentecostal preacher
[2:30:20] down there.
[2:30:23] But all Satan didn't come
[2:30:27] and just say a bunch of lies about
[2:30:30] Christ.
[2:30:32] He he he was willing for 99% truth, but
[2:30:36] he just wanted to cause he wanted it
[2:30:38] either said in such a way or he wanted
[2:30:41] it presented in such a manner so that
[2:30:44] the hearer didn't care if you believed
[2:30:46] one thing and they believe another and
[2:30:48] this one believes and I believe another.
[2:30:50] Doesn't matter what you believe. Just so
[2:30:52] long as you don't believe the truth.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; And so it can be 99. And if you hear
[2:30:59] anything even in this day, you have a
[2:31:01] right to say where did that come from?
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; What is the source? What is the source?
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; I want to go first and find out if
[2:31:10] that's the truth.
[2:31:15] [Music]
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; And you know what really hurts?
[2:31:19] If it's not the truth, you say, "You
[2:31:22] told me something that wasn't the truth.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; Do you think you think that a person's
[2:31:27] ready to repent?" No. They weren't ready
[2:31:30] to repent when they found out the truth.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; They weren't ready to repent.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Judas, he wanted or he attempted to
[2:31:38] repent.
[2:31:41] He wasn't able to.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; So, don't forget, now this isn't what I
[2:31:47] said. You look and say, "That's exactly
[2:31:49] what the prophet said,
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; not once, but over and over. It's the
[2:31:53] truth misrepresented."
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Satan comes to an individual. Now, you
[2:31:59] just hear a little voice and saying,
[2:32:01] "Well, you know, uh I'll talk about
[2:32:05] young people. We're not on your case
[2:32:06] now, but sometime people." Oh, and there
[2:32:09] was this one young boy I was going to
[2:32:11] tell about. He was about 16 and he would
[2:32:13] sit in the back in the meetings and and
[2:32:16] God was dealing with people and young
[2:32:18] people, teenagers were giving their life
[2:32:20] to Christ and surrendering themselves to
[2:32:22] Christ.
[2:32:24] And then they decided to go to a place
[2:32:26] they called it the place of the cross.
[2:32:29] And they would go up there and then
[2:32:31] pray. They just had like a special time
[2:32:33] out in the wilderness much like the
[2:32:36] camp.
[2:32:39] And they were all praying and all these
[2:32:41] young people were just wanting to give
[2:32:43] themselves to Christ, whatever Christ
[2:32:45] wanted. And I saw this young man. He was
[2:32:49] a minister's son. He was this minister
[2:32:51] had just died. It was his son.
[2:32:54] And his name was Benny.
[2:32:56] And I went and I just put my arm around
[2:32:59] him and I said, "Benny, don't you want
[2:33:01] to, you know, don't you want to
[2:33:03] surrender your life to Christ?" I see he
[2:33:04] was in a big struggle
[2:33:07] and he just exploded.
[2:33:10] He said, "They all want me to be a
[2:33:12] preacher. They tell me I'm going to be a
[2:33:14] preacher. I don't want to be a preacher.
[2:33:17] I don't want to be a preacher. I want to
[2:33:19] be a ball player. I want to play second
[2:33:22] baseman."
[2:33:25] I said, "Well, that's okay."
[2:33:28] What?
[2:33:30] Here's a preacher. Here's the guest
[2:33:31] speaker saying, "That's all right. You
[2:33:33] want to be a ball player?
[2:33:36] Great.
[2:33:38] If you want to be a ball player,
[2:33:41] I think he's the one that took over his
[2:33:42] dad's church.
[2:33:45] You know, the thing is the the devil, he
[2:33:48] doesn't care how he does it.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; But he just keep, you know, he'll just
[2:33:53] keep telling. And you know what he tells
[2:33:55] you? Well, you're going to if you if you
[2:33:57] surrender your life to Christ, you can't
[2:33:59] do that. You can't be that. You're going
[2:34:02] to be this. They're going to make you
[2:34:03] this. They're going to make you that.
[2:34:05] That's not the truth.
[2:34:08] God's not going to force you to be
[2:34:09] anything.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; He just wants you to be surrendered to
[2:34:12] him.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; And then the truth does the work.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; The absolute truth.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't forget,
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; brother Biscll,
[2:34:27] you think I I preached this for you?
[2:34:33] I have a wife sitting here. I have a
[2:34:35] family sitting here
[2:34:38] and probably Tom and Joanne streaming.
[2:34:43] I had the man I most respect
[2:34:46] that led me into the ministry and opened
[2:34:48] the doors for the ministry for me and I
[2:34:52] had him make a long trip from Portland,
[2:34:54] Oregon
[2:34:56] and sat in the front room of my house
[2:34:59] and the rest of the family. My wife felt
[2:35:02] like I guess she should stay in the
[2:35:03] kitchen. And this brother wanted to
[2:35:04] speak to me and he sat right beside me
[2:35:07] and let me know in no uncertain terms I
[2:35:10] am here
[2:35:12] to to get you out of this
[2:35:17] to get you out of this doctrine.
[2:35:21] He's very kind
[2:35:24] as far as a life. He just lived in the
[2:35:27] word and lived in prayer.
[2:35:29] He was like a daddy to me. His name was
[2:35:32] Chad. Some of you old-timers know him.
[2:35:37] I said, "Chad,"
[2:35:41] I said, "I have surrendered the life
[2:35:45] of my wife,
[2:35:48] her soul,
[2:35:50] the souls of my three children.
[2:35:54] I've surrendered them to this message
[2:35:58] and my own soul
[2:36:01] and nothing can ever change that.
[2:36:04] That was the last time
[2:36:07] that subject was ever discussed.
[2:36:12] You know what they said?
[2:36:15] His wife said, "Weeping over my wife's
[2:36:17] shoulder, you're the only children we
[2:36:18] have."
[2:36:21] He said on another occasion, "You got
[2:36:23] the best church."
[2:36:25] He said, "I've traveled all over through
[2:36:27] California and all." He said, "You got
[2:36:29] the best church."
[2:36:33] Said that. And yet he would say, "I've
[2:36:36] come to get you out of this."
[2:36:39] But you know, when all was said and
[2:36:40] done, you know what? They requested that
[2:36:44] I take his funeral.
[2:36:47] And that wasn't because I was an enemy.
[2:36:49] I was still a friend,
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; But I took his funeral.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; And I felt it it was a great honor to
[2:36:55] take and speak to his family and tell
[2:36:59] them what we believe.
[2:37:03] Friends, I'm here today because of my
[2:37:06] own soul.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; And far be it from me to try to tell you
[2:37:11] something that I don't believe
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; and that I wouldn't do.
[2:37:17] My friends, beloved friends and brothers
[2:37:19] and sisters in Christ, I've hung my soul
[2:37:23] onto this message.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; And that is why maybe I don't say a lot
[2:37:28] of things and I won't allow my ears to
[2:37:31] be garbage cans for all kinds of rumors
[2:37:34] and stuff and trash. And I say to you
[2:37:38] the same advice. Don't do it.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; Don't do it.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; Just say I'm not here. We can be friends
[2:37:45] and do what I do. Just say as you as I
[2:37:48] said to brother Chad, the dearest of
[2:37:50] friends,
[2:37:52] I have surrendered my whole life, my
[2:37:55] whole soul in this message. And nothing
[2:37:58] can change that.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; I am thoroughly convinced. I am
[2:38:02] thoroughly persuaded.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; And nothing can change that.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; And it'll be over.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; It'll be over.
[2:38:11] I'll fellowship with you, but I'm not
[2:38:13] here because friends,
[2:38:18] whatever you get, and I'm closing now,
[2:38:21] whatever you get, you need to get it
[2:38:23] from the message.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; And that will guide your feet, right?
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; Because a bunch of the stuff and a lot
[2:38:33] of the things that you can hear and if
[2:38:36] you were come to me and say, "Is this
[2:38:38] right?" I I may be able to say that's
[2:38:41] even 99% right.
[2:38:44] But what was the purpose it was told to
[2:38:46] you?
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; Was it told to you to make you more
[2:38:51] stable? Was it told to you so that you
[2:38:55] would be edified in your spiritual life?
[2:38:58] Is that the purpose? What is the
[2:38:59] purpose?
[2:39:01] like a brother standing up and saying
[2:39:03] and I've seen it several times and I've
[2:39:05] had people of the church of their church
[2:39:07] come to me and say he'd say this is the
[2:39:10] absolute
[2:39:11] they say what and they bring it to me
[2:39:13] would you say that this is the absolute
[2:39:15] I say absolutely that's the absolute
[2:39:18] that is the truth
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; but then why is he saying it
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; right
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; if I were saying to you this is God's
[2:39:25] absolute then you'd have a right to say
[2:39:28] that's exactly the truth But why is he
[2:39:31] saying it? Is he saying it because he
[2:39:34] has something else to slip in? Has he
[2:39:37] got something else to, you know, to
[2:39:39] convince us about? Is he trying to bring
[2:39:42] something else to us? That is exactly
[2:39:45] friends, my counsel, my my conviction,
[2:39:49] my experience to you. And it will keep
[2:39:53] it will keep you've got to have we got
[2:39:55] to have some guidelines. And that's
[2:39:57] absolutely the truth. And I close by
[2:39:59] saying, but the message that was sent is
[2:40:02] the season of the word in this hour, in
[2:40:06] this season, and it will reveal Jesus
[2:40:08] Christ. And furthermore, it will it will
[2:40:12] produce Jesus Christ in the individual.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't, then it's not the
[2:40:19] word.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; If the message of the prophet does not
[2:40:22] produce the life of Jesus Christ, then
[2:40:25] it's not the word. If some perverted
[2:40:27] word is bringing out a excuse me, making
[2:40:31] a dwarf
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; believer.
[2:40:35] That's right.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; We want to be
[2:40:44] anything but that.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Wonder if we have musicians come.
[2:40:53] Amen.
[2:41:01] Hallelujah.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a very some very
[2:41:25] popular thoughts today
[2:41:27] and I've heard it and I'm sure you've
[2:41:29] heard it. I just want to be true to
[2:41:31] myself.
[2:41:33] Whatever that means. I want to be true
[2:41:36] to myself.
[2:41:38] Brother Brandham was in one place and he
[2:41:41] was and and I'm just closing now with
[2:41:43] this, but he said
[2:41:47] and this was in Los Angeles, California.
[2:41:52] And he said, 'I'm very happy to be back
[2:41:55] in California again tonight with you
[2:41:57] people again. God bless you. I
[2:42:00] appreciate that. He said, 'I had quite a
[2:42:02] struggle coming this time.
[2:42:05] Please notice
[2:42:08] he, God's messenger, had a struggle. He
[2:42:13] said the struggle was not to come back
[2:42:14] to you, he said, but under the
[2:42:17] circumstances. And the circumstances was
[2:42:19] there was a great evangelist
[2:42:21] that was in the city having meetings.
[2:42:24] And here was here was brother Brandham
[2:42:26] with with uh the ministry that he had
[2:42:30] coming right to the city to a group of
[2:42:32] people right while this other minister
[2:42:34] was having meetings. So he had that
[2:42:36] struggle had a big struggle. You know
[2:42:38] what he says? He said
[2:42:42] but I felt I needed to keep my promise.
[2:42:46] He wanted to be true to his promise.
[2:42:50] And actually, when I started this
[2:42:52] message, I didn't even dream I was going
[2:42:54] where we went this morning.
[2:42:56] I thought about people I wanted to live
[2:42:59] true to my promise. And I thought of us
[2:43:03] living true to the
[2:43:05] word and our our conversion.
[2:43:10] Our How many
[2:43:14] groups and denominations were you
[2:43:15] through, Brother Ernie?
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; Eight.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; How many?
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Eight.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Eight.
[2:43:22] You You see how zealous Brother Ernie
[2:43:24] was is?
[2:43:27] And I'm sure that you were equally as
[2:43:29] zealous in all of them.
[2:43:32] Give yourself to it. You're just as
[2:43:35] positive in all of them.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; I'm sure of that.
[2:43:43] If I thought for a moment,
[2:43:46] If I thought for a moment that there was
[2:43:48] a possibility
[2:43:50] that I would have reason to leave the
[2:43:53] message
[2:43:54] or to forsake it, do you know what I'd
[2:43:57] do? I'd do it immediately.
[2:44:00] I wouldn't be a hypocrite. I wouldn't
[2:44:02] stay any longer.
[2:44:05] Say, "Okay, what have you pinned? What
[2:44:09] have you anchored your your faith to?
[2:44:14] What have you anchored, Brother Ed? Your
[2:44:16] soul.
[2:44:18] Your soul, young men. Your soul,
[2:44:21] brothers and sisters.
[2:44:23] What have we anchored our soul to?
[2:44:30] Well, I say, well, I've anchored my soul
[2:44:32] to the word of God. I'm not being
[2:44:34] philosophical now, but what is the word
[2:44:36] of God?
[2:44:39] You can read all kinds of chapters in
[2:44:41] the Old Testament.
[2:44:44] You can't see that. You can't produce
[2:44:45] that. What is the word of God?
[2:44:48] Said, "Well,
[2:44:51] it's not being sincere. The people up
[2:44:52] the street in the Baptist church, the
[2:44:54] people over here in the free Methodist,
[2:44:56] I can tell you they're every bit as
[2:44:57] sincere as you and I." Right?
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; This is not sincerity.
[2:45:02] So, what is the word of God? Well, I
[2:45:04] wept and I repented. They did, too.
[2:45:09] Well, I've seen I God has spoken to me.
[2:45:11] God spoke to them, too. At least as much
[2:45:14] as you and I say.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; So, what really separates us?
[2:45:22] Well, this is a big step. We have a
[2:45:26] prophet.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's a big step. Okay. Well,
[2:45:32] the Mormons just building a new temple
[2:45:34] up here, they could say, "We've got a
[2:45:36] prophet, too."
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; And the all the all the Muslims could
[2:45:40] say, "We have a prophet."
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; And how many people do you have? Our
[2:45:44] prophet has got 1.3 billion people that
[2:45:48] believe him. Well, we believe our
[2:45:50] prophet's coming back. They say, "We
[2:45:52] believe ours is, too."
[2:45:55] Well, our prophet, we got a whole bunch
[2:45:57] of messages. We got,00 messages. The
[2:45:59] Mormons would say, "Well, we got a book
[2:46:01] as well."
[2:46:06] Then all you'd find out is you got
[2:46:07] something to say. They got something to
[2:46:09] say.
[2:46:14] But here's something you can say.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; That they cannot say.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; No Catholic can say it because no pope
[2:46:21] ever did it. No Mormon could say it
[2:46:24] because none of their apostles or
[2:46:26] bishops or prophets ever said it. Amen.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; That is we have a prophet that stood up.
[2:46:30] Now this is the dividing line. Stood up
[2:46:33] in front of multitudes of people and
[2:46:35] said if God
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; doesn't come now
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; and prove that what I've said is the
[2:46:44] truth then don't believe me.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; That my friends is the dividing line.
[2:46:53] That my friends is what separates you
[2:46:56] and I from all the rest of the world.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; That one thing. And that's why I say
[2:47:00] thank God
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; that you came on the scene and prove who
[2:47:06] was speaking.
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; You proved it
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; and thus our faith is anchored in what
[2:47:13] God proved.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for your keen
[2:47:17] attention. Hallelujah.
[2:47:20] Hallelujah.
[2:47:22] Hallelujah.
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a song here I want to sing.
[2:47:35] Just wait till I find it.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we can sing 616, Brother
[2:47:43] Ryan. Faith of Our Fathers Living Still.
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; Pound that piano and make an anthem out
[2:47:50] of this.
[2:47:52] And let's all stand.
[2:47:57] Let's sing it with the depths of our
[2:47:59] heart.
[2:48:02] Faith of our father
[2:48:06] living
[2:48:07] still
[2:48:09] in spite of judge and fire and sword.
[2:48:16] Oh, our hearts be high with joy
[2:48:23] when we hear that glorious
[2:48:28] word.
[2:48:29] Thought
[2:48:33] holy
[2:48:34] faith
[2:48:36] we will be true to thee till death.
[2:48:43] We are
[2:48:46] in prison.
[2:48:50] We're still in heart and conscious.
[2:49:16] We will be true to thee today.
[2:49:33] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:49:43] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:49:53] Holy
[2:49:56] We will be true to thee till today.
[2:50:09] We will be true to thee till today.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; If you knew you only had one more time
[2:50:18] to sing that, how would you like to sing
[2:50:21] it?
[2:50:23] Praise God.
[2:50:25] Take our
[2:50:28] holy
[2:50:30] name.
[2:50:42] His holy
[2:50:44] name
[2:50:46] we will be true to
[2:50:54] hallelujah.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; Wonder if we can say 279 also little
[2:51:03] course. We worship you. So we'll be able
[2:51:06] to leave the service this morning. We
[2:51:08] worship you. And if you're here
[2:51:13] [Music]
[2:51:15] and you say, "I I know I have not
[2:51:18] experienced the kind of freedom that is
[2:51:22] promised me in the word." There's
[2:51:24] brethren here that will pray with you
[2:51:26] and pray for you. In the name of our
[2:51:29] Lord Jesus Christ, this is a house of
[2:51:32] deliverance.
[2:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; I say this is a house of deliverance.
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; Let the bound hear it. Amen. Amen.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; You can be free for whom the sun sets
[2:51:42] free is free indeed.
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We worship you in
[2:51:49] spirit and in truth.
[2:51:52] We worship
[2:51:54] you
[2:51:57] is
[2:52:00] [Applause]
[2:52:01] true.
[2:52:04] [Music]
[2:52:07] We
[2:52:08] worship
[2:52:10] you
[2:52:12] is
[2:52:15] true.
[2:52:21] We are
[2:52:24] your
[2:52:28] presence.
[2:52:34] We worship you
[2:52:39] in spirit
[2:52:41] and in truth. Just once more sweetly now
[2:52:46] we worship you. We worship
[2:52:49] you.
[2:52:51] [Music]
[2:52:52] is still
[2:52:56] in truth.
[2:53:01] We
[2:53:03] worship
[2:53:04] you.
[2:53:14] [Music]
[2:53:17] heard your word and found your presence.
[2:53:28] We worship you
[2:53:30] [Music]
[2:53:32] in spirit
[2:53:34] and in truth.
[2:53:39] [Music]
[2:53:41] May God bless you
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; as you worship him in spirit and truth.
[2:53:48] Not just in song,
[2:53:50] but tomorrow as you live your life, we
[2:53:53] worship you.
[2:53:54] You go to the place where you work, you
[2:53:56] brothers, those sisters that are having
[2:53:59] to work, I worship you in spirit and in
[2:54:04] truth. And may God grant that to you.
[2:54:07] That's my prayer. Brother John, I would
[2:54:10] ask if you'll ask God's blessing upon
[2:54:12] the people. Would you please?
[2:54:19] Heavenly Father,
[2:54:21] thank you for speaking to us this
[2:54:23] morning. God,
[2:54:26] we believe it was the same spirit that
[2:54:28] was in Jesus
[2:54:30] speaking to his disciples was speaking
[2:54:33] this morning to our lives.
[2:54:36] We believe it was the same spirit of
[2:54:38] truth that spoke through a prophet, the
[2:54:41] seventh angel, and that stood behind the
[2:54:44] pulpit for years and years, and you came
[2:54:47] behind and you vindicated it.
[2:54:50] We believe that same spirit was in this
[2:54:52] meeting this morning, God.
[2:54:55] And Lord, we're not afraid to agree and
[2:54:59] we're not afraid to pray. also if it was
[2:55:03] the spirit of truth that you would come
[2:55:05] behind it and vindicate it within our
[2:55:08] lives.
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; I lift up my hands, Lord. I lift up my
[2:55:12] heart, God. We weren't alive 40, 50
[2:55:16] years ago. That wasn't our season,
[2:55:20] but we are alive today.
[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; And we're asking that your word for this
[2:55:25] season would be manifested within our
[2:55:29] lives. We're not asking for a doctrine,
[2:55:32] a book, some quotes. We're not asking
[2:55:35] for a church building, or for sermons.
[2:55:38] We're asking for your word and the
[2:55:41] spirit of truth that brought it to now
[2:55:43] live it through our lives.
[2:55:46] &gt;&gt; We're not asking you to vindicate us.
[2:55:48] We're asking you to vindicate your word.
[2:55:51] And we've heard your word.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; We believe your word,
[2:55:57] &gt;&gt; Lord. We agree with the word. But now
[2:56:00] we're asking you and we're releasing to
[2:56:02] you and our faith that you would come
[2:56:04] behind your word and do the dynamics
[2:56:07] within our lives. Even at the close of
[2:56:10] this service, we believe that your word
[2:56:12] is true and you sent it out into the
[2:56:15] darkness and the void in Genesis 1 and
[2:56:19] now it's at the end time and you've sent
[2:56:21] forth your word, a mighty voice. It has
[2:56:24] power to put missing limbs back into a
[2:56:27] body. It has power to dissolve cancers
[2:56:31] and to dissolve things within it. The
[2:56:34] bodies that are within this service
[2:56:36] streaming on the internet. We believe if
[2:56:39] someone has not been born again that
[2:56:41] there is power in the word that we heard
[2:56:44] today. The power of the incorruptible
[2:56:47] word of God that a life could be totally
[2:56:50] set free
[2:56:53] &gt;&gt; by the hearing of what we heard today.
[2:56:55] God, we believe it on the same level. We
[2:56:59] believe it on the same level, God, as
[2:57:01] when you spoke it in John, as you spoke
[2:57:04] it 40 years ago, 50 years ago,
[2:57:07] you were in this service today. And
[2:57:11] Lord, we've been listening to the sound
[2:57:13] of your messages to our hearts over the
[2:57:17] years.
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; And it is the same
[2:57:21] &gt;&gt; from a little boy myself being raised in
[2:57:24] the Bratam tabernacle under a prophet's
[2:57:27] message. What I heard today was the same
[2:57:31] voice. It's the word. It's the voice of
[2:57:34] the spirit speaking to our lives. And
[2:57:36] Lord, we're asking you once more to come
[2:57:39] behind it and vindicate it within our
[2:57:41] lives, within our children, within our
[2:57:44] sisters, our brothers, within this
[2:57:47] congregation, within the visitors that
[2:57:49] are here, within those that are on the
[2:57:51] internet. Lord, do a miracle within our
[2:57:54] lives.
[2:57:56] Lord Jesus,
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; what our theophanes are crying for, you
[2:58:02] have spoken it, God. There's not a
[2:58:05] question in our minds that this is the
[2:58:07] absolute truth.
[2:58:10] That is why we're here. That is why we
[2:58:13] listen. That is why we obey, God. And
[2:58:16] our hands are lifted up. Our hearts are
[2:58:19] open, God. This is that which was spoken
[2:58:23] by a prophet's message that there would
[2:58:25] be a people that would receive thus,
[2:58:28] sayeth the Lord, and would go out and
[2:58:30] live this word.
[2:58:34] Then Lord in humility and in simplicity
[2:58:38] we say Lord be it unto us according to
[2:58:42] your word God. Be it unto us according
[2:58:45] to what we've heard God that we are
[2:58:47] living in a bride channel that we can
[2:58:50] get into. And it's not us speaking no
[2:58:52] more. It's not us living no more. It's
[2:58:56] you living with us.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; And we are your body God. And we are
[2:59:01] your people. May there come such a
[2:59:04] vindication individually to our hearts,
[2:59:06] God, as we go from this place today that
[2:59:09] there would be something that would
[2:59:10] stick with us
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; as your word will not return it to you
[2:59:14] void. It has a life of its own.
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you continue to go to our
[2:59:20] homes, in our vehicles. Let it be our
[2:59:23] conversation as the Holy Spirit feeds on
[2:59:26] the word, God. Let it become more real.
[2:59:29] Let it become more evident. and let it
[2:59:31] become more in reality. Jesus,
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; we're not asking for emotion. We're not
[2:59:37] asking for a just a shouting happy time.
[2:59:40] We're asking for the truth that will set
[2:59:44] us free into a new body, into another
[2:59:47] dimension where our theophanes can come.
[2:59:50] Now, as we go this afternoon and as we
[2:59:53] even leave this place and something can
[2:59:55] just echo in our hearts, it is nothing
[2:59:58] but the truth. Stay with the word. Stay
[3:00:01] with the message. Stay in line and help
[3:00:04] us at this end time as your bride and as
[3:00:07] your people to stay in line.
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, go with us now. Father,
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit that spoke it now would
[3:00:16] get inside of us.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; We don't want to ignore it. We don't
[3:00:20] want to miss your presence, God. Is it
[3:00:23] that just brings forth a cooling off and
[3:00:26] a lethargy and a formalism? But let us
[3:00:30] stick a hold of every word of God that
[3:00:32] it that fire in our bones and the
[3:00:34] passion of this life could be very
[3:00:37] evident in our lives. We pray that
[3:00:39] others would say they've been with
[3:00:41] Jesus.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; Go with us now and every need continue
[3:00:45] to manifest and prove your word, God,
[3:00:48] among us. And we'll be looking for that,
[3:00:50] Lord Jesus. We're going to be sensitive
[3:00:52] more and more to that manifestation. Let
[3:00:55] these words, God, not fall on empty
[3:00:58] hearts, but on good ground that it would
[3:01:00] change our lives, God.
[3:01:04] &gt;&gt; Go with us now. Continue to unfold your
[3:01:07] plan in Jesus name.
[3:01:12] Amen.
[3:01:15] [Music]
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's been a good day.
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We we dismiss you in the
[3:01:24] name precious name of Jesus and have a
[3:01:27] wonderful day. What's the rest of it and
[3:01:30] this week and see you Lord willing on
[3:01:32] Wednesday if not before.
[3:01:36] Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
