TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] to the Lord. Let the Lord have his way. Let the Lord have his way in your heart. Every day there's no rest, there's no peace until his way. If your life is resurre [Music] Yes. And there is no peace until his [Music] hand is the Lord. [Music] Amen. trust that each and every one of us this morning and let the Lord have his way &gt;&gt; in our hearts. If he has his way in each of our hearts this morning, then he's going to have his way in the service. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's guaranteed. &gt;&gt; So, we want to submit everything to him. Hebrews 13:15 says, "By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. That is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. So you might say, well, what is a sacrifice of praise? Say it's the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. For with such sacrifices, God is well pleased. &gt;&gt; So if you want to say, I like I want to please God this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's start by using the sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fruit of our lips, giving praise to him. And you might say, well, I don't feel like it, you know. I really had a bad week this week, you know, and and and I'm not the kind of person, you know, that really says the sacrifice is the act of giving up something valued. So, you may value your quietness. I'm just a quiet person. That's the way I am. Right? Giving up something valued for the sake of something having a more pressing claim. &gt;&gt; How many know God has a claim on your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want to give up give up your thoughts. give up your way, you know, your way of thinking. Just let it's be surrendered to God this morning and uh and he'll be pleased with a sacrifice of praise that comes from your lips. Um I'm going to start maybe with uh we'll sing I love you, Lord. And then uh and then I think we're going to have the choir come up, but let's sing this chorus first. Let's just worship him and give him the sacrifice of praise. I love you Lord and I [Music] to worship you. Oh my soul rej. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Rejoice sweet this morning. Say I love you Lord. Oh I love you. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I can't take him to My soul rejoice my king. Amen. Amen. It's a song I've wanted to sing for uh actually look back and it's so it's probably been about five years I wanted to sing this song. So I'm going ask the choir to come up join me. Um and brother Brandham said they finally they hung him on the cross and then God answered from heaven. The sun refused to shine. The moon turned dark. The stars wouldn't show its light. And the son of God died at Calvary. and you look at the sky till a son held had convulsions and went out. They killed him in the city of Jerusalem and buried him in a borrowed tomb. But on Easter morning he come forth. He started climbing. He climbed on beyond the moon and the stars till he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high and his eye is on the sparrow and I know he watches me. Brother Brandham says, "I was with Moses when he went down into Egypt. I was with Moses at the burning bush. He said if you're a Christian, you're identified with them Bible characters. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Said whatever Christians has been, whatever believers has been, every believer now is identified with that same Christian person. Whatever it is, you must be identified. Don't forget that. He said, "And when you do," he said, "If you don't, you've got spiritual am amnesia. You've forgotten who you are." This song kind of uh goes through what it was like for some of the believers at the cross. And uh I'm sure many of us have thought about it, what it was like when he took the Lord. And uh well, I'll just let the song tell the story and maybe you can worship with us as we sing the song. [Music] the Wonder of your cross shall be our meditation. [Music] to gather in that shadow as the sun went down [Music] to weep with those who thought that you were leaving. You were leaving Jesus, the humble king who never wore an earthly crown. [Music] to steal away at night when they took down your body [Music] with love and tears to lay it in a borrowed grave to go with Mary to the place they lead you where they lead you, Jesus. And in the morning, find the stones roll away. [Applause] [Music] The crossful cross. [Music] Oh, what glory, what victory I find. Will I will come to the wonderful cross. Oh, and my whole life I lay down. [Music] where heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness. The sun was dark. The stars refused to give their light. But then the declaration he is risol [Applause] he lives forever. Oh Christ and the victory I find where I will come to that wonderful Wonderful. Oh, and my whole life I lay down. And my wall I lay down. And my whole life I lay down. [Music] Where heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness. The sun went dark. The stars refused to give their light. [Music] But then the he is rises behold dead. Behold it is forever. [Music] [Applause] glory and victory there. I will come to Christ. [Music] down. Oh, the cross. Oh, wonderful cross. Oh, glory. Here I will come to the wonderful cross [Music] [Applause] and my whole life I lay down and my Oh, I I lay down. [Music] Oh, and my whole life I lay down.

Here on a hill far away stood an old rug cross the emblem of suffering and sh. Oh my love that old cross with the Jesus for a Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Let's sing the second verse. Will that all cross? So is my the world has a wonderous attraction for me.

Wonderful cross and my crow. Heat. Heat. I will come to the cross and my [Music] lay down. [Music] Oh, and my whole life I lay down. And my wall I I lay down. Amen. [Music] We're going to go to prayer this time. [Music] Got a testimony from Sister Ruth. For the last several weeks, I have suffered from muscle problems, and it was especially severe before and during the meetings in Missouri. On Wednesday night, I could not sit in the service. So, Brother Ed brought me down for prayer. I could only think of what the scripture said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." On Thursday morning, a wonderful recovery began to take place. I'm thanking Brother Tom and Brother Ed and all the saints who prayed and believed. The promises of the word cannot fail. And all the glory belongs to our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe you've here this morning and you've got a need. I don't know what it is, but the Lord certainly does. Amen. [Music] Sister Lisa St. John has a request this morning to remember her mom. Sister Jean Watkins in prayer. She has an eye surgery tomorrow. She's just praying that God will help her through a 10-day recovery. She'll have to hold her head bent over, eyes down for 10 days, 24 hours a day. She will need God's help to be able to do this. So, let's pray for our sister Jean. How many have a need this morning? They want to be remembered before the Lord. People out on the internet, people at home listening over the home phone hookup. If you've got a need this morning, you just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Let's just go before him at this time. [Music] Father, we're so thankful, Lord, for everything that you've done for us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not worthy of your grace. But Lord, when we you were on the cross, Lord, we were on your mind, Lord. [Music] And Lord, this morning we serve a ri risen God. And we are so thankful, Lord, that you're here this morning. Lord, your promise says that where two or three are gathered together in your name, Lord, do we have many here together this morning, Lord. Amen. And we're believing this morning, Father, for every need, Lord, that's in your presence here this morning for every person, Lord, listening in on the internet, on the phone, Father. Whatever that need would be, Lord, you know the need. You knew it before we asked. Lord, you knew it before they lifted their hands, oh God. And I pray this morning, oh God, you'd meet that need, Lord Jesus, in every life, oh God. Be with our sister Jean as she's going through this surgery. guide the doctor's hands, oh God, and be with her as she's going through this time of recovery, oh God. Lord Jesus, each and every one of us. Lord, may you, Lord, as our brother Ed comes this morning to speak the word, anoint him, oh God. Lord, speak words of life, Lord Jesus, to every brother, every sister, oh God. Lord, each one of us that's here this morning, Lord, may you just come, Lord, and have your will, have your way in our midst this morning. Lord, we love you, oh God. Lord Jesus, we just want to sit at your feet this morning. We're th so thankful that your presence is here with us this morning, Lord Jesus. We're just praying you to have your divine will and way in our midst. And we'll give you all the glory. &gt;&gt; We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can have your seats. [Music] Want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning. Um we've got Esther and Joel Gruner, brother Glenn and Sister Shauna's cousin are visiting with us from the Okonogan. We're happy to have you here with us. And uh also we've got our brother Ed Hammermeister here with us this morning and we're happy to have uh brother Ed here. He's going to be doing some work with the school and uh we're thankful for the gifts the different gifts God has placed in his body. So God bless you, brother Ed. We're thankful that you're here. Um one announcement uh saints uh it says June 13th and 14th. I don't know what days those are. Uh June 13th and 14th, Mount Baker Bible Way family work party. Landscapers and experienced painters are needed, but all are welcome. You can stay for free in the RV stall or cabin of your choice on a first come, first serve basis. So, so get there early. &gt;&gt; Uh meals include a barbecue on Friday evening. uh sign up with brother Jack in the fellowship room today or via email and I assume brother Jack's email is posted somewhere so people will know it but please tell uh let them know if you're going to be there and uh certainly there's been a lot of work going on in the camp and uh we're thankful to see everything that's happening there I know the master of the wind and then we're going to be turning to the word I know the master [Music] I know where he can come. Make the sun shine. I know the master of the we [Music] saints. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I know the master of the wind. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you know him? &gt;&gt; Whom to know is life eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're gathered here today for more than just a Sunday morning service, but we're gathered here because we're pilgrims and strangers, and we're actually on our way to an eternal home. &gt;&gt; So, we're here today to get to a different level, to get to a different place, to get to a different and a higher understanding, I believe, of what we are here for. May God make that a reality to us. I'm so thankful we have this opportunity to assemble such as we are. You may not know uh exactly how to appreciate it, but there surely will come a time in your life when you will really appreciate being able to be here like this. And uh I'm really nice to see you here, Brother Ed. and uh know brother Ed Hammeister is really assisting the school and the plans you may not know but as well as assisting in the ministry up in Edmonton at brother Harold Hillbrand's church brother Edimmeister is also an architect we need them sometime especially when they're largely free thank you brother Ed I don't know if that was free or not but I pitched it in God has really blessed us with some very skilled people in the kingdom of God. The devil hasn't got all of them. Do you know that &gt;&gt; devil hasn't got all of them? &gt;&gt; God's got just exactly what he needs at the time he needs. Which also brings me to uh the June 13th 14th date that was just announced by brother Rod. And uh you brothers that intend to go to the camp, you better try and do it all on the 13th because the 14th is brother Oed's wedding. And I think we need to be here for brother Oed's wedding. So, uh, I didn't really get that full announcement prior to, uh, the service, but I have an announcement about Brother Oed and Sister Anne's wedding, and they they've had to change the, uh, venue for the reception, and that will be uh, the notice will be on the board. They've just had to change that. uh but also he is requesting for those that because they have limited space and they gave out uh uh invitations and for those of you who have received an invitation you need to respond back to brother OED and sister an as quickly as possible because they need to make uh uh they need to make their reservations and the plans for those that are attending. So please, there was only a few that had returned the uh invitation saying that they were going to be there. So all who are going to be at the reception and of course the uh the service, we all want to be here for the wedding service. So we'll be announcing more about the time etc. But that is on June the 14th. I would like you to pray for Sister Anne's parents. Uh they're in Johannesburg. uh and and very very fine well- educated people and they are not allowing them to come to Canada to the wedding if you can believe that. It's just so bizarre. Uh I just don't understand the system anymore. All I can say is what the prophet said it's of the devil. Uh, I just can't understand how, you know, two people and they have their tickets and everything else and they say, "Well, we don't think you're going to come back." Uh, and uh, so they use that as an excuse and they're not able to come. And you can imagine what it is for a father not even able to come and and and see his daughter's wedding and the mother and and and for him to be able to walk down this aisle and give his daughter away. It's uh it's really sad uh you know and and more and more I'm I'm ashamed to have citizenship in a country that has those kind of regulations and don't have enough enough intelligence here to be able to put whatever regulations and I I told them just I'll write a letter we'll we'll post a bond we'll do whatever you want to do to see that these people are on the plane to go home and why a person can't uh see through that. I just don't understand it and I don't want to comment too much on it, but I really am disappointed in that. Uh but and so pray for them. The wedding is going to go on anyway. And uh and then also we want to be remembering brother Dier. Uh I believe brother Dier is ministering for brother uh brother Kelly Hildebrand in in Saskatchewan this weekend. And so remember them. and also brother Dier's father. Let's keep remembering him up. I just would like to see him raised up for the glory of God. Amen. Uh I want to uh say that a great servant of uh our Lord Jesus and a great servant of Christ in this message has gone on to his reward is brother Billy Andrews. And uh brother Billy Andrews uh left us on Friday morning. He had had a heart attack and we see him here. Uh God bless him. He's uh he's got a lot less problems than we have right now. And he was a certainly a great servant of Christ. He uh uh he served the Lord with everything that was in him. actually he had a very very successful evangelistic ministry. He had a large tent uh I saw and was actually at the location in one small city in Tennessee where there was 12,000 people in the tent and gathered there and he was uh during the 50s and the 60s had a very very uh uh wellattended and successful ministry and God used him much in praying for the sick. He heard about heard of the message. He uh uh didn't lay it down as such, but he felt to establish a church what they did uh established just outside of Murphreey'sboro in Tennessee and sponsored the Thanksgiving meetings which many of you here were in those Thanksgiving meetings and I uh I went down and joined with him and spoke those meetings for 19 years. So we have a a very very deep and abiding friendship. Uh we want to remember sister Eloise his wife and the congregation uh of his church and uh we want to thank God for a long life that was spent. I don't know exactly but I think he was uh either 79 80 years old somewhere along that. I can say that he loved the Lord Jesus with all of his heart and he labored boldly for Christ. He preached with uh unwavering faith and strength and uh they're going to have the service. There will be a service tomorrow. I will not be able to attend because it is tomorrow. They're having a viewing tonight and a and a service tomorrow. Brother Ernie Vil Noea will be representing us in the church here going uh to be with them and I we want to remember the family. if you would please. Uh, Brother Andrews is loved and well known also by uh many of the people in brother Joseph Hammed's church and we that they're going to be of course having some uh sorrow in their hearts, but we pray that God will comfort them. I would like to have you uh stand if you would and I would like to just have a a moment of silence as we contemplate a great servant of God that has crossed over and then we're going to have prayer. Dear heavenly father, we know that the life and the breath of all men, women, and all humans is in your hands. And you have seen fit, oh God, to call and call the name of brother Billy Andrews. And as Job said, you will call and he will answer. So you have called, but not only did you call now, you called years ago when he was a young man, and he and his wife heard the call, and they laid down their lives to serve you and to serve your people. And now, Father, his years of many years of labor are over. He labored early in the morning. He labored late in the evening and at night. He would be in prayer, oh God. And he prayed for the sick for hundreds if not thousands of hours. He prayed for the sick. Has saw many, many miracles, some which I know of, oh God. And I want to thank you for his life. Thank you, Father, for this life that has been fruitful. Thank you for this life, oh God, that you sent a light that crossed throughout the area down in the south and the southeast. And I pray, Father, that now, oh God, you'll receive our thanksgiving and my personal thanksgiving for the life of Brother Billy Andrews. And we're asking, oh God, there will be a special resource of comfort that Sister Eloise will be able to draw on. And she will even sense a reality of of the grace of God being poured into her life, Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Spirit for the congregation and those that have responsibility to carry on, oh God. And brother Joseph Hammed and the church there, Lord, and those throughout the community be with brother Ernie, Father, as he is there. And I pray that he'll be able to speak to the family on our behalf and be able, oh God, to let them know that we are standing with them at this time. And pray, Father, you'll bring them through this time more victorious, uh, more victorious and with more maturity and more thanksgiving. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Now we have for some time uh we've needed an increase in our uh number of our deacons and uh that has been perhaps a a year or more. Uh and I'd like to make a confession to the assembly. I know it's not a surprise to um many many of you but I'm very slow. I'm very very slow. I'm slow to do things. I'm slow to get things done. I'm slow to make decisions. I was born in October and I understand that's Libra. And brother uh uh brother Vin told me that's just impossible. I can't do anything about it. I have to weigh things out. So, how long do I weigh things out? I weigh things out till there's hardly anything left to weigh. And uh you have to forgive me. It's just the way I am. And I I've prayed about that and I asked the Lord to help speed me up, but it's just uh sometimes it's just very very difficult. And I I wait and I think that perhaps God who's eternal and I'm an eternal son that I can just wait on and on and he's going to do something. And uh you know what he does? He does do things. And lots of times if you get right in there and you know I just make a big mess of it. But I just let him I sit back and let him. And you know God's wheels grind slow but they grind very fine. and he does get things done and often not on our schedule but he gets things done and sometimes he can move very very quickly and so consequently uh there are the rare moment when I've been able to move very very quickly but the deacons have said well we need more deacons we need more deacons and I waited on God there are two names I couldn't and and part of this is because uh I I wait for his inspiration And then when uh and then even when I a name will come to me in a a life and I watch it and I think about it because we have so many here in the congregation very very qualified people and I I have to tell you this morning that I I also have hesitation to call and even ask a brother to take such a position because I feel that they miss a lot of the their standing they're directing, they're talking to people, etc., and miss much of the meeting. Myself, if I had my choice, I'd sooner be able to come and sit down in the service, and I feel badly about that. But there was two brothers and their names were before me for a few months. And then I spoke with each of them and told them that I would like them to pray about this. And then they've prayed for another two to three weeks. And then that's been another two to three weeks that I let come by to list time. I'd like to just uh bring before the congregation uh brother Billy Fer and brother Sam Stall. And I wonder if those brothers would just come and stand here please if they would uh while I read some scripture. And I also want to say to the congregation that uh it we'll we'll do exactly what the prophet of God said. We let these brothers serve for a few weeks, he said, and see how they like it and see how the congregation likes it. And then if everyone feels comfortable and happy with that and the brethren are happy with that, then we uh gather around them, lay hands upon them and appoint them into this uh into this position. But the scripture says this, uh, Brother Billy and brother Sam, likewise must the deacons be grave, not double tonged, not given to much wine, nor greedy, a filthy lucer, holding the mystery of the faith in pure conscience. And let those uh let these also first be proved. And that's what brother Brandham speaks about these few weeks. He didn't give a specific time, but he said these few weeks, let them be proved. And he said that see how you like it. See how the congregation likes it. Those words he used and just see if you feel comfortable about that. And I would like to say that both of these brothers when I sat with them individually and spoke to them about this taking this responsibility uh they both in their own words said they had been having a desire to do something for God and I just felt that that was God that laid that on their heart. It says, "And let these also first be proved, and let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderous, sober, faithful in all things. Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. And that in the original Greek says they acquire to themselves an honorable station and much confidence in that faith which is in Christ Jesus. Brother Brandham said this just these points. A deacon is a custodian or a guardian in the house of God. Number two, he is one that keeps things in order. Number three, deacons must meet any opposition. And number four, deacons are the policemen in the church. Number five, they keep order with kindliness and friendliness. And then he said after some months and a prayerful time that is my responsibility that I want to know want to let the church know that I was uh very very serious about these things. And then brother Brandham made this is a quote in placing of deacons. Then these men shall serve. And if they feel that they will accept this office, then they will come for a short time to see if they feel that maybe God has called them. And if later they feel that they are disqualified, then they have a right in the next few weeks to resign that the office that someone else could be appointed in their place. Said, but first they must be appointed. That's what we're doing now. and see how they like it and how the congregation likes it. Then if it's all right on both sides, then we make these men ordained deacons. Now he said, "Now, now you have said, let these first be tried and see if they desire this office." And that is what we're doing. I'm just going over that. And in prayer, he said, "God bless these men and may they serve this office with all their hearts, knowing that it is a purchasing through them a great degree in heaven." I thought that was very, very lovely. Someday when the books of heaven shall be closed. May the book of the celestial beings and in the great book of heaven be opened. May their names be 100% before God and the Savior and all the heavenly hosts to be the same as in his kingdom. Bless them Lord. And may they serve his office well in Jesus name. And we thank you for them. I want to have you bow your head if you would. I want to pray with these brethren as they face these next uh these next number of weeks and this position that they have prayed already about earnestly. Dear heavenly father, you know the need that is in your body, the body of Jesus Christ, the bride body of Jesus Christ. And here stands before me, Lord, two men. Our brother Billy Fcher, Brother Sam Stall. Men who have lived, oh God, before you with a good degree of uh sincerity and righteousness, their wives, uh their families. Oh Lord, I pray, dear Lord, that you will look down now upon this scene and that the Holy Spirit shall be in attendance at this moment. I pray that you will bless these brothers as they have solemnly and seriously considered, oh God, their affirmative decision in this regard. And I pray, dear Lord, within the hearts of the congregation, Father, they will realize that there is an order and a way that things are to be done and we seek to follow, Father, the order that you have laid within the congregation. I thank you for the deacons that you have given us, oh Lord, and the officers of the church. And I pray, Father, your blessing upon every member that is seated here today. I ask, oh God, that the Holy Spirit shall shall shall sanction every move and every decision for your glory. And now, Father, your blessings upon these brothers in Jesus Christ's name as they enter into this ministry. We pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you, Brother Sam. God bless you. Amen. God bless you, Brother Billy. Amen. All right, we're going to read some scripture and go right to Are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; All right, you can stand. I wanted Brother Rod to just help me to sing. I'd like to just sing a verse. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. I was singing it this morning. And notice, if you would, the words of this song. My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. for thee all the follyies of sin. That's all the follyies of unbelief. I resign. Let's just put that all out of our heart right now. And at at this moment, I have some serious things to say this morning. And I I believe that God will just make a way and open the door that it will touch our hearts where we There's some spiritual needs here. All of you that may not have it. But let me tell you, there's some spiritual needs in our congregation. And you that have a spiritual need, I want you to be in full expectation that it'll be touched and that you'll make the correct decision based on that. And don't leave it. Don't leave it. You want to be now the way you're going to be when you cross over. And I just said to the Lord this morning, I don't want to have to. And to me, it's a paradox how people will live a a life at a certain level and just expect that all problems and everything is just vanished when I cross over. Let's tend to it now. &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's just sing that verse, please. My Jesus I love thee. I th for thee. I [Applause] gra [Music] I see. I love thee. My Jesus is singing that verse again. My Jesus I know for me [Music] Heat. Heat. I love thee. My Jesus is now. &gt;&gt; That last line is my Jesus is now. Right now. &gt;&gt; If ever I loved you, it's this moment. &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles, please, to Matthew the 15th chapter. We're going to read from verse 21. Then Jesus went thence and departed into the coast of Ty and Sidon. And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, oh Lord, thou son of David. My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she crith after us. And he answered and said, "I am not sent but under the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me. And he answered and said, "It is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs." And she said, "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table." Then Jesus answered and said unto her,"Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto thee even as thy as thou wilt, and her daughter was made whole from that very hour." Mark uh the uh in his gospel, he records the same account. And then uh when Jesus answers her responds to her and says that it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs. And she answered and said unto him, "Yay, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." And he said unto her, "For this saying, go your way." For this saying, go your way. The devil is gone out of your daughter. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible &gt;&gt; for this saying? Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. There are several events in this woman's life uh that come together all at once. And these events coming together in this vortex as aware of her life thrusts her just it it it is like a it's like a launch to her. It thrusts her into the presence of Jesus Christ and the desperation. And I want you to notice that it is the combination of these events and these circumstances in her life that caused her literally to become a part of Christ because her account is told here and this is Christ. This word is Christ. And her account now fell into scripture into holy writ. And this didn't happen just by an accident. God knew this before the foundation of the world and this event happened in such a way all of these circumstances that were perhaps very very difficult to her. I want to spend some time and just belabor that a few moments. Number one, she was at a huge disadvantage because she was a gentile. And Jesus had said, that's why he said, "It's not meat to cast the children's bread or that which is for the Jewish nation or the Jewish people to cast it to the dogs which were Samaritans and Gentiles which were considered heathens." And the Bible says in in Mark's gospel that she was a Greek. She was a Seraphanician, but she was of a Greek descent. And it says so she was at a huge disadvantage at being a gentile. That's number one. In other words, I'm just wanting to say she she didn't have things in her favor. Number two, she had carried the burden for how many years? We don't know. But she carried the burden of having a child, a daughter. The Bible says, grievously vexed of a devil. And uh to be vexed is to be under the power or possessed of a demon. And these are persons that are afflicted with us with especially they could have a it could be a physical disease either bodily or mentally and such as paralysis or blindness or deafness or loss of speech or epilepsy or something. But this girl had a she was seriously vexed. And the Jews believed that demons had entered their bodies and held possession of them. Not only to afflict them physically, but also to dethrone the reason and uh and and and to take away the consciousness of them. and accordingly possessed they they would possess and express their mind and their consciousness through that individual and that's what the Jews believed concerning it. Number three, this woman now recognized she saw someone and recognized in Christ that here was someone who could help her. And number four, she approached him only to be insulted and turned away. [Music] &gt;&gt; And number five, however, she possessed a faith that was beyond offense. She appeared to be beyond offense. She couldn't be offended. And I would say that would be a lesson for almost everyone here. because we're so sensitive, it seems, and so conscious of our own selves uh that we become upset or irritated at how we're handled or how we're responded to. And she couldn't be responded to bad enough. There was no way to offend her. Even the disciples coming to the master, they they had done what they could do. and they coming to him and say, "Send her away for she's troubling us." So, she was a problem and she possessed this kind of a faith. And number six, her steadfast unwavering and persistent faith. And she said to the Lord, "Truth, Lord. It's not meat to cast the children's bread to the dogs." And I don't know. I think it's more. It's got to be more than a story. It has to be more than a scriptural account. &gt;&gt; It has to be more than that. We cannot sit here and feel in this age when we've been so anointed with people's rights. And and believe it or not, don't think that it stops at the doors of the church. It comes into the church. We pack this that I have certain rights. Even though we may not say that, but we have that sense. We have that feeling. We have rights to be treated a certain way. We have rights to be respected a certain way. We have rights to be acknowledged a certain way. But now this woman, she needed something from God. She needed something from Christ. And and uh regardless of how she was treated, she was determined to uh to obtain this. Says the truth, Lord. But yet the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table. And he said, "For this saying." I was going to entitle this title this message this morning for this saying, but I want to expand on that very substantially. I want you to think about this very, very deeply this service this morning. I want to speak on the revelation of the unveiling of God in our life, in your life. The revelation now, Brother Tom sp uh stood to the pulpit here on Wednesday. If you and perhaps number of you were not able to be here on Wednesday, I hope you had a good reason for not being here. It was a milestone message. I I don't often say uh that about brother Tom. I will give commendation about other people's ministry, but sometimes I hesitant on that because I think well people's just saying that because he's my son-in-law. Well, I'm going to push that aside. Say Wednesday was a milestone message &gt;&gt; and if you haven't heard it, you need to hear it. And as soon as he started on Revelation, right while you were still standing waiting to read the scripture, he started on Revelation. And it was right exactly in in the channel that God had been already dealing with me. And my last service was on uh on revelation. So that's why I want you to we have the channel of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I want you to know we have the mind of Christ. I want you to listen very very attentively. We need revelation. And I stood in this pulpit saying to you that I had to ask myself, what have I had that's really a revelation from God? And I had to think back honestly, sincerely. And I have identified a few times, maybe four times, there may be more. But I know that I had a revelation. I had a revelation of God's prophet. Malachi 4 absolute unindisputable revelation from God said, "Did I get up and jump? Did I feel chills? I felt nothing. The word of God just came alive." Of course, it's there. &gt;&gt; Of course, this is the only ministry that fits it. The serpent seed, absolute revelation of the serpent seed saw it from Genesis to Revelation to the book of Revelation. As soon as as soon as God opened it up, just saw it. It just rippled all the way through. Of course, that's why they had circumcision in the Old Testament. That's why it was blood. That's why it had to be Calvary. That's why it had to be a cross. That's why, oh, this is why it was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. It just came as a revelation. &gt;&gt; The Apostle Peter, I want to be very careful so I don't get ahead of myself. So, you pray for me. &gt;&gt; The Apostle Peter and Matthew 16th chapter, don't turn to it. you know it real well. I just want to refer to it. When Jesus said, "Who do men say that I am?" And they said, "Well, Jeremiah, Elias, one of the other prophets, who do you say that I am?" Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, son of the living God." Jesus said, "Blessed art thou, Peter, for flesh and blood hath not hath not revealed this unto you, but my father and upon this rock. And now that the whole foundation fundamental part of the message today is upon this rock I'll build my church. Brother Bram said the rock was not Christ and the rock was not Peter as the Catholics say and not Christ as the Protestants say. It was the revelation of who Christ was. &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ. Now, brother Brandham and and and this is so very very uh these are fundamental powerful statements that I have to make. Christ was that essence of God. He said he came from the bosom of the father. Christ was that which came out from God. &gt;&gt; And this is the difference. This is where the revelation has to come. That and this is the fundamental truth of this service this morning. Where you need revelation, where Peter needed revelation was that which comes out from God, that which comes forth from God is what requires revelation to be able to identify that that came out from God. Peter's revelation was, "Thou art the Christ. You are the Messiah. You are that which has proceeded out from God. You you that's what you are. You're the Christ. Now today, it doesn't require revelation to believe that there's a God. &gt;&gt; I drove past a temple this last week. The Sikhs, and we have many of them here. The Sikhs from India believe in one God. &gt;&gt; The Muslims believe in one God, Allah. Multitudes believe billions of people believe in one God or believe that there is a God or a multiplicity of gods, they believe in God, that's no revelation. &gt;&gt; There's not an iota of revelation with that. But if there is a God and this God that fills all time and space, this God that is God, this God who created all things, this God who brought you and I on the scene, where is he as of this moment, where who who can identify and say this is God? This is the unveiling of God. This has come forth from God. And this is why prophets were essential because they would come to their people and God would send their prophets send his prophets and they would identify the word of God the sayings of God and the people of God and for and and and that's why they were rejected and brought into persecuted into a persecuted place and I'm going to enlarge on that in a few moments. But now this woman that I have read about, she had something within her that required this specific set of circumstances to happen in order for it to come out. She had you you've heard today very very much has spoke about self-discovery. We've got books on self-discovery. thousands of them if not millions on self-discovery. People are what what is it self self trying to discover something about yourself. Uh we have they have places actually geographical locations that you can go and come into a certain uh state of euphoria to try to discover yourself. People leave America and they go to India. They go to Nepal. they go to some uh you know uh place where they can maybe get and rise into some mental state through meditation and try and discover some thing something about themselves. I'm going to make a statement right now. Every person that's seated here and every person that's listening to me on the internet at this moment has within them a resource that they don't know anything about. And God allows circumstances that you don't like. &gt;&gt; He allows trials that you don't invite. &gt;&gt; He allows adversity that you wish you could dismiss. He allows pressures that we wish we could escape. He allows this upon us for the specific purpose that there's something within us that has to rise up to the occasion. And that which rises up is a is a we need a revelation that that is God within us. &gt;&gt; And thus the woman had to be she had to have a demon-possessed child. You may misunderstand that God knew she had a demon-possessed child. God knew this woman had was under under this crushing burden for these years. God knew she perhaps tried many many places to find an answer for this dilemma she had. And and why she may have said year after year, why do I have to live with this? And now she sees a a window of opportunity. Here's a man. He's prayed for the sick. He's healed and raised the dead. Oh, I've heard about these miracles and now I come. This this would be my answer. Oh, thou son of David. &gt;&gt; My child is grievously ill, grievously vexed. Come and heal her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And the disciples, his faithful apostles, get away. We don't have time. Get away. What? What kind of people are you? Be still. Be quiet. Our master hasn't got time for you. She couldn't be stealed. She couldn't stop her crying out. And then to have Christ himself say, "It's not meat for me to give the children's bread to the dogs." I tell you, there's probably very few even here that could master that kind of an insult. &gt;&gt; We read about it. We hear about it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was her. I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your situation. Maybe you got it all mapped out how it should be answered and how God should do it and and how the people should do it and how they should respond and you're not getting that you're you're carrying it by yourself and saying doesn't somebody understand doesn't some but God has you going through that because deep within you is a certain resource and God is going to allow this to to allow you to arrive to a station called desperation. &gt;&gt; You get desperate before God. Oh God, and you'll find some rising up within you. So rising up, it's not coming out of your emotions. It's coming from the seed of God until a faith rose up. Said, "I haven't seen such faith like this." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It took all of that to bring that faith out. &gt;&gt; And when it rose up, &gt;&gt; she wasn't She had no consciousness. I'm coming to the moment of my greatest experience. I'm going to be recorded in the history of the scriptures. There are millions that are going to read about me. She had none of that. She's focused on one thing, her need and my answer. And it must happen. And this is the only one. I don't care what they say. I don't care anything about it. I know that this message has it. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many people go sideways. I don't care what happens in this church or that church or what this person says or where they go. I know it has my answer. &gt;&gt; And you watch it work. &gt;&gt; You watch it happen. &gt;&gt; And I hold you. This woman remains absolutely steadfast, unmovable, unshakable, and she could not be she could not be embarrassed. She could not be insulted sufficiently. She had the she knew that she had a hold of something that was real. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't think that she realized the level of faith that she possessed, but took all of these things. Sometimes we don't see the answer. And I know I'm talking to everybody. So, nobody needs to cower down and say, "Well, he's not. This is for somebody else." Everybody here can can acknowledge that we don't always see the answer &gt;&gt; for what we've prayed for. And yet I would say it may be per chance that the reason that God has not answered you is that there's still something deep within you that needs to rise to the surface. &gt;&gt; You need to go on a journey of self-discovery. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll find out even in the world people the reason why they have all of this uh uh all of the books and all of the volumes and all of the seminars and whatever more on self-discovery is because they know that people can be you can be a better you and and so they work at that level physically speaking. You've heard stories. I've heard stories. I could relate some. I'm not going to take the time. I and I've experienced it myself. When a person comes to a a moment in their life of extreme danger, it's a crisis. And I've had it myself. And I tell you, I had a I had an animal after me. I had an animal who was going to tear me to shreds. And I was just a a lad in my early teens. And I tell you what, I crossed a I I crossed a space of ground and and was over top of a a corral. I'm talking about a corral where they keep wild horses and things in that up several feet high. I was across this I was across this space of ground and over that corral in an absolute instant. And I turned around. I don't know how I got over that corral. It was probably twice my height. I got over that. I'll tell you what person, you know, we use the phrase adrenaline. Well, it whatever it is, but you you find you got a resource in you that you didn't know that you had, but you can sure you you don't you you can't explain it. If you had to explain it right after, you can't explain it, but it was there. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. It actually happened. It actually functioned. And people have done impossible feats. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have lifted things in a matter of crisis because they had to do it. &gt;&gt; And somehow they found the strength. They found the determination. They found whatever it took for that moment. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Hello. We're all human here. &gt;&gt; You've been there. &gt;&gt; That's because you have that resource within you. But now I'm talking spiritually. We discover there comes a there there comes a a spiritual moment or a time in our lives when we find that there's a a a resource of strength or stamina within us. And that's when we become aware I I I'm I've got a channel open. I've got an avenue. I'm tied into something that's beyond me. It's beyond my world. It's beyond my understanding. But I have I can tell you I've gone through crisis, many of them. But there are a few occasions when I found that God dropped in a wisdom. God dropped in a comfort. &gt;&gt; God dropped in a grace. Been times when you were just in an absolute quandry. It hadn't seemed like there was no answer. But in the midst of that, God dropped in an answer. &gt;&gt; And you knew that. You knew that this was the way. &gt;&gt; You knew that. You knew that this was the decision. &gt;&gt; True in a in a thyron church age. a a quote we often refer to, brother Brandis quoting. I will put no another burden upon them. And he says the the word for burden is a weight or the pressure. The pressures of the dark ages was either bend or be broken. Bow or die. It was the Inquisition and the power of the empire that was backing it up. Satanic worship. Be organized. Pay or pay with your life. said, "Each age has has had its pressures." I know we read this often and we let it fall off of our lips, but I want to suggest to you that we need to think about it more deeply. He said, for example, the great burden of this last age is the pressure, the pressure of riches. &gt;&gt; Didn't say the pressure of having riches, but the pressure of riches. soft living and a nervous tensions in a complex age. Those things nervous tension in a complex age that we seem so unfitted to live in. Brother Tom touched on this without using this quote talking about, you know, the pressure of life to to engage in our the pressure on our time. There's no use even talking about it because everybody, &gt;&gt; I don't care where you live, how little you have or where you live and how much you have, you're all all subject to pressure. &gt;&gt; The same pressure. People who have a a a lot of responsibility are under incredible pressure. And those who should have no pressure, they still have a lot of responsibility. And and and they should have no pressure, but there is a lot of pressure. And I know that there is pressure. But on the other hand, God knows the pressure of this age. &gt;&gt; We do have soft living. You're going to go and and ride in a a a car that we trust it's a fine car and adequate to get you home and you're going to go someplace and eat and you're not going to be scraping for something to eat today. You know, we we have there seems to be plenty in this country. We throw away some nations would be delighted to live out of our garbage. Is it true? &gt;&gt; Am I preaching on target? &gt;&gt; That happens to be the It is the pressure of this age. We're not going to escape. You're not going to change the age. &gt;&gt; And I don't care where you are, what job you have, or where you live. You'll not escape the pressure. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's terrible news, Brother Ed. you just might as well take it and settle it because that's what a prophet of God has said. You're not going to escape the pressure. &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't want to hear that this morning, &gt;&gt; but that's what you are hearing. And you know what you should say? What this woman said? Truth. &gt;&gt; Not just a prophet of God said that. The Lord said that. &gt;&gt; Truth. Lord, &gt;&gt; this is an age of pressure. &gt;&gt; Truth. Lord, this is an age of soft living. &gt;&gt; Truth. Lord, this is an age of nervous tension. Truth, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not going to escape it. &gt;&gt; Why does God allow us then to be in such a fix? because you have something within you that God wants developed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the pressure is good for us. If we are believers, the pressure is good for us. The complex situation is good for us. These nervous tensions are good for us. This we have to say that whatever God allows is good for us. And I will not bow. I will not bend under it. I will not be broken under it. I don't have to have a bunch of medication to help me attend to it. I've got the source. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can render this thing not helpless, but I can render it in submission to the will of God in my life. &gt;&gt; It will bring about a positive, not a negative. It's not going to break me. It's going to make me. And you need a revelation to be able to identify what is being unfolded in your life that it's from God. &gt;&gt; Bring it on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You need a revelation that this is of God. &gt;&gt; What is happening and what is being unfolded out of my life? I can take you all through the scripture. I can take you to the centurion. I can take you to the to to the other woman. I can take you to the widow who who made the loaves for Elijah. All of those and the scripture is absolutely abundant with those situations. It was a crisis that brought out from the people. You know, there's a part of our lives that doesn't really require any revelation. doesn't require revelation to come here to church and sit here and doesn't even require revelation to say brother Bram says baptism in the name of the lord Jesus Christ doesn't even require revelation brother told a story I hope you have time &gt;&gt; I'm going take my time. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram told the story no less than 38 times. No less than 38 times. Told the same story of the young man slave from Africa who was brought over. And he told the story of the slave buyer coming to buy the slaves. And as he observed them, he saw one living acting very different from the others. Said, "I want him." So he's lived in certain he his his demeanor, his responses and his activity was such that this buyer wanted him. I want him. No, no. He said, "He's not for sale." He said, 'What makes him so different? And the owner said, 'Well, I wondered about that myself. I found out that he was the son of a king. His father is a king of a tribe across the seas. &gt;&gt; And because he sees that, because he knows that, &gt;&gt; he lives different. It was his knowledge of knowing. He knew that. He knew that he knew he's a son of a king. &gt;&gt; All of his circumstances around him was defying that, saying, "How can you be the son of a king when you're a slave? How can you be that when you're not there? How can you be that when you're across the ocean on another continent and you'll never get back? You'll never see it. you'll never become a king. But nevertheless, because he knew he was a king's son, he lived different. &gt;&gt; His matter, his department, his conduct, the way he the way he moved about, people saw he was different. &gt;&gt; So, a real revelation causes a person. I've been absolutely I've just been boggled in my mind how people will declare their revelation of the message and their revelation in the message and revelation and their life's a disaster. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about where they live personally victoriously. They don't live victoriously. I think I'd sooner have a person with a lot less revelation at least live up to it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Live up to it. &gt;&gt; What makes him live different? He said he conducts himself that way. He knows he's a son of a king and he conducts himself that way. My summary of that is unless we know who we are, we will not live any different. If you know who you are, &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm talking about have a revelation of who you are, you will live different. Now, here's one. Here's something you that are here, you know, we talk about a prophet of God. You that are perhaps visiting, let me tell you, God sent a man with his word, God's word in his mouth. &gt;&gt; And here's what he said to you, to this generation, to this age, to those that would believe. And I'm speaking to you as believers today. And this message is in the the message the deity of Christ. I want you to listen. You're listening very nice. He said, "Let the fundamentalists," that's there are many that are fundamental Christians. We're not talking about fundamentalists, but he said, "Let the fundamentalist, let them people who deny the power of God and say it's wrong." He says, "But that's the same power." Because he knew where he stood. Many times the prophet of God had to say, "I know where I'm standing." Really, what he's saying is that when he know where he's standing and he knows that the angel of the Lord is going to come and he knows that the secrets of the hearts are going to be revealed, he can say with confidence, I know where I'm standing. That also has a second part. Those who were coming up didn't know where they're standing. &gt;&gt; All the preachers sitting behind didn't know where they were standing. But here was one man who knew where he was standing. He knew what he was. He knew what he was called to do and he was moving in that direction. &gt;&gt; And here's what he said. But that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. Not going to have you raise your hand. don't need you to identify yourself, but you ask yourself, do I have the Holy Ghost? And if your uh confession is confirmative, I know that I have the Holy Ghost. I have word for you. I have a thus sayeth the Lord. And the thus sayith the Lord says the same word, the same uh the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people. that's got the Holy Ghost. And he said, "That's right." &gt;&gt; He addresses them, men and women. It's time that we find out who you are. &gt;&gt; The devil's trying to hide you back and tell you that you're some little trod down something. You're not. &gt;&gt; You're sons and daughters of God. That's thus sayaith the Lord. You're sons and daughters of God. Your sons and daughters of God. The deity is not in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; And God has allowed the pressures of this life. Has allowed you to come to this age. If he wanted you to be back in the inquisition, you'd have been there. It was God's choosing that you aren't there. It's God's choosing that you're here today. It's God's choosing that you'll be under this tension and you'll be under this pressure. It won't break you. It will make you. &gt;&gt; You do not need anti-depressants. You do not need some uppers. You do not need some downers. You do not need to be attended to. You need to submit to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the pressure comes, you want to look up and say, "Thank God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's bringing something out of me that I didn't even know I possessed. &gt;&gt; I need a revelation from God so that I can identify and recognize what's coming out of me is God. &gt;&gt; This is God's plan. He said, "I know you think I'm crazy." After he said these words, he said, "I know you think I'm crazy." There was people back then that thought that was crazy. There may be some here this morning or some listening to me that think that this is over overboard. I say, "So, thus sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; And if you want to stumble around in your own reasoning, go your way. Think about it all you want. Turn it around, do whatever. You'll be in the same state that you're in today. &gt;&gt; I sooner go with God's thought. &gt;&gt; This is a way of victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God prevent me. God save me from my own thinking. &gt;&gt; You need to say that. &gt;&gt; God saved me from my own reasoning. God saved me from my own thought. It hasn't got me anywhere anyhow. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know you think I'm crazy, but let me tell you something, brother. When you realize when realize and brother Brandham was standing here as God's servant said, "Let me tell you something, brother. Let me tell you something, sister. When you realize that almighty God lives in you, &gt;&gt; my life I give Zoe, the life of God is in the human being. &gt;&gt; And that is why Satan is so opposed. He'll do everything in the in the channels of the of the mind and in the channels of the of the realm of the spirit, the channels of your memory. Oh, how that wars. Oh, you need to say, "Cast that reasoning down. Cast those memories out. Holy Spirit, come now. Cleanse them out. [Music] &gt;&gt; Cleanse all these things out that have been as such a stumbling block to me, such a hindrance to me. All of these feelings and all this affection that's not of you. Cast it out." &gt;&gt; Why? So that God So that God can rise up. Hallelujah. So that God can be unfolded in you. And as you see God being unfolded in you, you need a revelation. That's God. &gt;&gt; How many people there are? many &gt;&gt; and the circumstances of life afforded them a certain opportunity and a door was open to them and they became they became very very well uh uh not merely educated but they became very competent in a certain field. They never knew that. They never knew that. They didn't know how many parents there are whose whose child came, you know, and and rose up amongst them right in their family and and began to blossom out in something and but certain circumstances, certain people, certain events had to happen. We all have experienced something like that. Linda plays the piano. I remember when her mother would sit and she's going through all of the finger exercises. Drove me crazy. And then she'd cry and and pound her knuckles. Oh, say, "Well, that was a delightful home." &gt;&gt; But my my wife is, as most of you know, she's very persistent. She just get one thing on her mind and there is no other direction. You're going to play the piano and that's all there is to it. So they all had to play the piano. And then Marilyn is coming up. She's playing the piano. Don't go and talk to Marilyn about if you have any question you come and talk to me. But the school contact us and said we want to talk to you about Maryland. So said, you know, we're having a problem and uh we don't know what the problem is. They said, you know, she has a problem and we think that you need to have her, you know, examined. So we took her to a specialist. He examined her. Oh, he said, uh, she's, uh, whatever, amidextrous, this, and that, the other thing. He said uh and they gave her eye test and giving hearing tests. I'm telling you this is before God tell you the absolute truth. Said she'll have hearing aids in both ears by the time she's 10 years old and she'll have to wear glasses and have hearing aids the rest of her life. We went to the little church there and mostly Newfoundland people in Toronto. We didn't know what more more to do. We we said this is impossible. What what's the matter? You know, she seems to be perfectly normal to us and uh uh took her up for prayer just like I brought my wife up Wednesday night and it was a Wednesday night and prayed for her. My wife then took her right back to the same hearing test to the same place to the same physician and her ears were perfect &gt;&gt; and her sight was perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we went we were advised to go to another specialist and this specialist he wired her with 22 wires in her head to give her brain waves. Oh man, you should have seen what that graph did. It just sent it right off the map. He said, "Oh," he said, "You know, are you she can't do things like with her. Are you trying to give her piano lessons?" "Yeah, of course we give her piano lessons." He said, "Forget it." He said, "She's, you know, and there are certain things that you, you know, she's not she's not fit for that. She's not suited to that. Her abilities aren't that. Her abilities are in another direction." And so, you know, he said, "You can't. She hasn't got this kind of coordination with her hand." Well, I said, "You know what? We notice that she does things with the left hand, does things see, I I even got it. she got it from me or I blame her for I blame her for a lot of things that I have. Maybe it worked in reverse. So I start talking about my left hand. I put out my right hand. But she does things with her left hand, cuts with her left hand, then does something with her right hand. And and uh and and now she, you know, we found that there were other abilities and she started her artwork as a very small child and then we found out, you know, she has gifts this way. Fact is she painted the picture of brother Brandham. Now here I am a parent. I I make a confession to you. I thought I had artists in different parts in the states and Canada both say that picture brother Brandham we would like your permission to paint it. And I had one letter from a brother and he wanted to paint it and he was ready to go ahead with painting it. And I thought you know what I have a daughter that's pretty good in art. I'd never made anything out of it. I thought, why don't I let her think about it? Why don't let her pray about it? And after some many, many, many weeks, in fact, as it was in months, since she prayed about it, and she'd like to now have the picture and look at it and that now we have the many of you have the picture. But I can tell you that when she had 22 wires in her head, I had no idea she'd ever paint a picture. You know, you're sitting here and I'm telling you on the authority of God's word, you do not know what's in you and you do not know yet what you will do. And you may be going through some grinding experience at this moment and you don't realize that that's God. You think, "Oh, it's this and it's my job and it's my home situation and it's my in my school. It's my education. It's where I work. It's something ah I just can't stand it." And God is saying, "Good. Just cook. Just let the heat let that heat develop what I want to see develop." And finally, you know, a person cries out and finds out, "Oh, Lord." And and even she said the wrong thing. Oh thou son of David have mercy. Get away from me. And you cry out and the heavens are brass. How many here I will ask for a show of hands. How many here have ever prayed and felt that the heavens were brass. &gt;&gt; Oh lot of brass heavens. &gt;&gt; There was no answer. Don't give up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just say it a different way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you can't say anything else, say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; help me, &gt;&gt; Lord. Just help me. &gt;&gt; I can't sort it out. I can't figure it out. I can't find my way. I know you led me here. I know you have the answer. Help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, I feel more than inspired. I know this is God's word and God's message for this service this morning. And whoever is here, I know it's for you, young and old alike. And I felt it's going to be a very, very special milestone message for some of you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says about believing in God. I said earlier, now I'm going to give some quotes to quickly back it up. He says America. When we found the American Indian, he was worshiping something. The sun, the moon, the nature. Because in him, he's got a human spirit. He's a human being. And he knows he had a maker. So, there was something within the human heart called out to worship. See, that didn't take any revelation. Doesn't take any revelation to walk out and see, oh, the great universe and say, "Isn't this marvelous?" doesn't take a revelation for the scripture even says about about the unbeliever. Paul in the Romans said because that which may be known of God listen closely that which may be known of God is manifest in them. For God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him, the invisible things of him of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made. People look at flowers, they look at trees, they look at nature, they look at the salmon returning home, they we look at all of these things and said, "This is of God. This is God." There's no revelation. &gt;&gt; You understand? That doesn't take any revelation. That's why Muslims can believe in God. Sikhs believe in God. Untold billions of people believe in God. There's God someplace. There's God somewhere and there's something in them. They want to worship something. &gt;&gt; It's no revelation. Until you can identify what God has sent, &gt;&gt; what can we do to do the works of God? Believe on him &gt;&gt; whom God has sent. I'm standing behind the pulpit today and you have a right to say what brought you here. What caused you? How come you're a pastor? How come you're a preacher? You have a right to say that. And then it's incumbent upon you to go back and find out how come this is this way. And then you answer yourself, why am I here? &gt;&gt; Why am I listening? What brought me here? What is the trajectory? What influenced me? Who spoke to me? Say, "Well, a brother spoke to me." But deep down you say, "No, God spoke to me. God revealed it to me. I may not have a lot of revelation, but I know one thing. This word is true. &gt;&gt; I know one thing." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This word is true. See, and then it it took it took some forces, powerful forces to bring that out of you and bring you to where you are today. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was looking down here at Brother Roger Monk and his father. I'm sure they I know them well enough to know they won't be offended with what I say. But Rogers, he was a he's an engineer, sound engineer for the girls records and he's got a very very fine studio downtown and it's probably one of the best engineers that I know uh period all the way up and down the west coast or in Western Canada. But I'm sure that when Mr. Monk senior had him as a boy, didn't realize that was in him. Didn't realize at all. One day he would sit and I I can just tell you I thought I have a fairly good ear for music and the girls will be singing and I've never seen Roger play a piano. I've never seen him I've never seen him tune an instrument. Never seen him play an instrument. I don't know if he does play an instrument. I know one thing. And then these boards to me is just a whole bunch of buttons and wires and stuff. And he says that this board thing must be 15 foot long and he's on a stool that rolls around, you know, back and forth. And he's doing this, doing that. And he just clicks a button in the and he speaks in the in a in the room where the girls are singing. He says, uh, he calls one of the girls name. I believe one time he said Joanne uh just we'll just start singing again cuz just a a a touch that uh right when you started that last line just you know sing that one again and then you know just when they get there and they start singing it again and then he slides it up and and then and the new line comes in he says you got it this time and I sat there and thought what in the world does he know about music? He he I see him working this board, but then when you hear the song, the pitch is just absolutely correct. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure that uh Mr. Monk Senior never realized, you know, one day when his his boy grows up, he's going to have that kind of an ear, but it was something in him. And then and then that's developed over over the years. You you you develop those things. Now, spiritually, Brother Brandham says, "See, I'm not I'm not I'm not home yet. I'm not finished yet." Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Dity is in the human." Now, that's rejected by the world. &gt;&gt; But they would have to also reject the words of Jesus Christ that says, "I will be in you. I will be in the Father and the Father will be in me and I will be in you &gt;&gt; and you will be in me. &gt;&gt; Are we settled with that? &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a lot of our uh uh uh I'm I'm going to address something. There's a lot of our life just our our our natural being that we each have our difficulty with. And others have difficulty with it or they might have a difficulty with another part. When you're in a body of pe believers like this, you know, there are some that you just really really uh what should I say? You just have such harmony with. And then others you don't have the same kind of harmony. And some may rub you the wrong way. Hear me? That may be the very person God sent your direction. Right. True. &gt;&gt; And you cozy up to all those that's real nice for you. I'm feel so comfortable and this is these are people I like to be with and you know we do we have a good there's no personality conflicts etc etc. But maybe it's the personality conflict God sent you and you you wonder how come we're still in the same church &gt;&gt; and God needs you in the church and God needs the other person in the church because and and we we hear little things about you know we've heard things that well we maybe need you know they're shining you up we kind of need to great I'm going to take it a whole lot deeper you need that person you need that kind of pressure you need this kind of association to bring something of God out of your life &gt;&gt; and you start finding that you have a patience and you have an understanding and you have there's something of Christ coming out and you have an appreciation. You have a respect. &gt;&gt; I have something a word for you. Maybe you're having a revelation. &gt;&gt; There's actually God coming out of my life. God is developing some maturity in my life. &gt;&gt; Where I used to have a problem before with this person. I don't have it anymore. Fact is, I kind of like that person. And just keep keep on that same direction. You'll finally have love for them. &gt;&gt; This service won't be complete till some people who have never hugged the next person need to embrace them this morning. &gt;&gt; Well, I had a good amen from some quarters, but not from other quarters. You need to actually embrace them and say, "Thank God for your life. You're just what I need. &gt;&gt; After this service, the other person might say, "Just what did you mean by that?" You see now in the Old Testament and and this this is just so well known to everybody in the message. We know that and Jesus told that how the prophets and the holy men and the righteous of ages gone by, they were rejected. They were rejected. &gt;&gt; Why were they rejected? Well, because their their message, their life, everything about them irritated the people around them. &gt;&gt; And little did they know that that was the very thing they needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was that that that part that we want to write off as maybe personality conflict or they got something that I just, you know, have a difficulty with whatever more. Uh that's the very thing that you need to just say, "God, I know one thing. You sent me here. I know another thing. You've allowed that person into my life. And so I know another thing that you're working out something and I'm going to get the benefit from it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just going to go through this. Jesus said, "Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepelers of the righteous." And when the prophets of God and the righteous when the prophets of God and the righteous were manifesting the anointed word in their lifetime, notice when they were manifesting the word of God in their lifetime. I don't want to lose you. Now I'm come to some of the most important point here. When they manifested the word of God in their lifetime, the holy men, the righteous, the prophets of old, when they manifested the life of God, that was why they were despised. But they had to have a revelation that that which they were speaking, that which they were living was actually God unfolding out of them. And that's why brother Brandham could say these words. So I'll just clinch that. He said, "It's not me they hate, &gt;&gt; it's the message. It's not me that is the irritant. It's what you speak &gt;&gt; or what you live, &gt;&gt; your actions that can become a real irritant just the way you are. And and so consequently, it might even be the place a person works or the place a person studies. And you're the oddball, but you don't know why you're the oddball. Well, let it be known. I'm telling you why you're the oddball. Because the spirit that's in you is of a different spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh my. God, help me. And God help you at this moment. [Music] God has not sent you to this world to be a businessman, &gt;&gt; to be an accountant, &gt;&gt; to be an engineer, &gt;&gt; to be a bus driver, &gt;&gt; or to be a policeman, &gt;&gt; or whatever other occupation you may. That's not why God sent you here. God sent you here to be his son &gt;&gt; and to be his daughter and to have deity living in you. That's why God sent you. &gt;&gt; And this other is just to accommodate to get us through life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if what if what we do in life, I work at a certain job or I have a certain occupation or or whatever it is that I do. If that begins to compromise your spiritual experience, your spiritual life, then you need to you need to do something about it. quite frankly and it's what I believe and you can you can do what you want with it but quite frankly I believe if a if a man a wife has family has children and you stay away from the house of God don't think for a minute that I am putting pressure on people to be here in church you need church a whole lot more than I need you to be here what you're really saying. How many here will actually confess with me and believe with me that we preach a message with our actions? &gt;&gt; Believe that. &gt;&gt; You don't have to say a word. You're just preaching with your actions. &gt;&gt; And so I just become laxidasical or I become disinterested or or I become too busy or I become whatever. I don't care what it is, but your actions and say, "Well, I haven't I haven't got the time. I I got too much pressure. I've got this and I've got that and I can't be this. I can't take my place in the body of Christ. I can't be there for these services. I can't be there. I can't participate in these things. What you're doing is you are preaching a message &gt;&gt; to your children that what I'm doing here at home is more important than the word of God that's going over the pullpit. What I'm doing and and the children, you don't have they don't have to say, "Amen, Dad. We believe that. Amen, Mom." They don't have to say that. You're preaching them a message and they're getting it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they grow up. And you know what? When they grow up, church isn't important anymore. The meetings aren't important. &gt;&gt; The word of God's not important. What you're really saying is that the man that laid on his face and spent those hours waiting on God for a word from God for your family, for your children, for you young men, you young ladies, and all who are here. What you're really saying is that's not as important as what I'm doing and occupied with for my little life. &gt;&gt; That's really what you're saying. And they're getting that message. &gt;&gt; They're absolutely getting that message. I heard some statistics. I don't have it so I'll not attempt to give it to you but I heard of some statistics of the number of young people and children that grow up into adulthood and take a responsible place in the community and in the house of God and in the work of Christ that have come from united homes that have come from broken homes that have come from homes that are broken and the children stayed with the mother or homes that are broken and children stayed with the father and it's absolutely astounding. These are national figures in the United States. It was absolutely astounding the the the figures on on that account and how critical and how important it was that the children even though it is from a broken home that they continue to go to church and continue to be in the house of God. There's nothing saying there's no there's no responsibility that God has to give you some great blessing every time. Listen to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not merely preaching to you. I'm telling you my wife is from a broken home &gt;&gt; from about 11 12 years old and stayed with her daddy and lived across the street. Her daddy's business was across the street from the church. And so she was constantly in the church because she was with the young people and started playing the piano when she was just a girl about 14 years old. And the preacher would be on knocking on her door like at 7 in the morning because they had a live radio broadcast, just a simple live radio broadcast. She'd go with the preacher and she'd play something on the radio and the piano. And do you think that every morning she got up just clicking her heels, oh isn't this wonderful? I'm just glad I can get up at 7:00 and go to the radio station. No, this was a drag. It was just a responsibility. &gt;&gt; And a lot of you young people, you got your mothers and you got your fathers. You wouldn't want to have had my life either. I lived a very, very lonely life. And as you know, my mom passed away when I was six and a half. And I boarded out to a place that had no children, lived in a little log house, little log house. And I remember well walking through the just walking through the trees and I'd hear the partridge flutter their wings and I'd kick the grass and they sent me go and get the cow every day. Have to go and get the cow. You have to forgive me. I thought this old stupid cow bring it in and tie it up in the same old barn all the time. And you think I was clicking my heels over that? I didn't have my sister or she shot sent off to some place and I'm sent off to another place and never got to see him. Month in, month out, month in, month out. When I got older, you think I I thought I thought to myself when I got older, I thought I can do two things. I could come into meetings, I'd be in the house of God, and I'd hear the word of God, and I'd feel the presence of God. And I I just felt like I wanted to I wanted to I wanted to bend in that direction. And I was very aware that I could get bitter. Get bitter. Why? Why do I have to be stripped of this? Why do I have to be out here? Why do I have to be boarded out with people? Boarded in one home. And the woman was stone blind. Stone blind. And uh the bathrooms outside outside toilet with a wire so she could find her way out there. She was the one that cooked for me. Poorer than church mice. Pancakes every morning not cooked in the middle with only molasses to pour on them. Don't talk to me about life. Don't talk to me about hardship. Don't talk to me about loneliness. Don't talk to me about that. I've been there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been there, done that. Not a month, not four months, not six months, not a year is most of my life till at 15 leaving home and starting to work on your own at 15 years old. I'm looking at you. I'm saying I have a memory channel, too. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And I look I let the Holy Spirit blast that out clear. &gt;&gt; And I look up and say, "Oh God, whatever happened, you ordained it. &gt;&gt; I know one thing. Godly led me here. You led me to this truth. You led me to this word. And you led these people to be here. And we need one another. I need them. They need me. I'm going to love them." Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I haven't found that a chore. &gt;&gt; Quite honestly, I don't have enough time with you. &gt;&gt; I dream in my mind of having all the Hutterite people over, all his family over, all the young people over, everything else. Brother John Andy's had all the young people over. Told him, "Oh, we had all these young people over." You know what I did? I envied him. &gt;&gt; I looked at my yard, Brother John, just yesterday, the day before. I thought, "Wouldn't it be wonderful have all the young people over here?" they could do some things and just to have them here in the house. We don't get enough of each other. And I believe that that is the spirit that's going to cause us that I have I have a revelation that that's from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't have enough of each other down here. &gt;&gt; We want to be together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have any trouble thinking I'm going to sit across the table from you at the great wedding supper. I don't have any trouble. I don't have to imagine that. I just think about it. And it's a reality to me. We're going to sit around the table. We're going to enjoy one another. &gt;&gt; When we get invited, as we were just yesterday, I I couldn't hardly I I even though it's a study day for me, Saturdays, I'm studying, I think that I want to be there. I want to be with the saints. I want to be with them. I want to share some things. I want them to share some things. I'm not done. Then there's folks there's some young people we married them maybe months or years or whatever more and we were a service to them. They got married. They're not here today. &gt;&gt; They're maybe not even in sin. They're just not here. We were of service to them. When they wanted us, we had to be there. Then when they don't need us, they're gone. We're history. But then when they get in trouble, they're on the phone cuz you're our pastor and that's our church. We are &gt;&gt; telling to me again. &gt;&gt; And then somebody somebody passed away. Somebody died. And it's like, "Brother Ed, put them in heaven." Well, you didn't even want to be with the saints down here. &gt;&gt; You didn't even want to gather with the saints down. You didn't want to be with the bride down here. How come you want to be with him over there? &gt;&gt; Do you get my message? &gt;&gt; Come on. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for those of you that it's been a burden and you had a struggle and you have that border and you have this long drive from Chilowak or wherever more and you have all of these things so that you could worship and you come from Mary'sville, you folks and I never ever every time I drive through there. drove through just a about a week and a half ago and thought of our dear friends from Mary'sville and I said to my wife, "We ought to stop and see them." And well, on the spur of the moment like this, we didn't know just when we'd be there and we thought better better just carry on. People pay a sacrifice. Come here to the house of God. You think God doesn't see that? He sees that sacrifice. He knows what you go through. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I feel as though, you know, don't ask me to put you in heaven with the bride of Jesus Christ if you didn't want to be with them down here. &gt;&gt; Use every excuse to get away from them. Be away from them. Be too busy from them. Preach a message to your children. It's not worth it. We don't care how much they prayed. We don't care what's going on. We don't care what's preached. It's better if we stay at home. look at a video or do something else. &gt;&gt; You preach them a message &gt;&gt; and God should convict you over that &gt;&gt; at this moment. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Let this congregation at least support me. Those things are the truth. &gt;&gt; And you need to turn around from that. You need to say, "I'm going to take my life serious. I'm going to take my walk with God serious. Whatever do I'm going to lay my life down in a full surrender to Christ. I'm going to be an example to the people. I'm going to be there to shake hands with somebody, to give them an encouraging word, and to be my part in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm closing life. The life that you have, the life that you're living will continue to be a life of self-discovery. And I want to say to this congregation today, I go to the words of God's prophet, you have deity in you. And Satan works at full time 247 to work through this flesh to twist and pervert that life that's in you or to keep it down to keep it suppressed. &gt;&gt; But if you have a revelation, I can't give you this revelation, but if you have a revelation, you're a daughter or son of God, then be it known to you. Be it known to you, not my words, prophet of God's words. You have deity in you and God is going to bring it out. &gt;&gt; He's going to do it one way or another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a very very well-known rock band artist that lives across the street from me and they were having big big parties some time ago, some years ago. The church prayed and and we had to take some steps to have them stop because they were going all night. One more night till 7:00 Sunday morning, then expect me to come here and preach. I said, "You have your party all you want, but 11:00 it shut down." That's what the bylaw says and they struggled with that. finally it was shut down and things happened and and uh so we've had very very little communication just you know maybe acknowledge one another whatever more and but we we've we've lived across the street from each other for 17 years so I know him very very well yesterday I was mowing the day before yesterday I was mowing the lawn and he came and stood right at my curb and just waited and I caught him in the corner of my eye. So I I just shut my I shut my machine off and walked back to him. Hi Robbie, how are you? We shook hands. Think you know who I'm speaking about. And he was he was dead serious. And he thrust out his hand and took my hand, shook it. He said, "Uh, that that that service, your your congregation, the people, that service you had for that O'Brien boy." I said, "Yeah." He said, "I was so impressed." He said, "The the the" and he was trying to describe the atmosphere and he and he began to describe the congregation. He says, "How the people how the how the congregation pulled together and the kind of service, the kind of time they had." and he put his hands together like this and and and and and the strength that the strength of the people and he was trying to express it and then I begin to talk to him begin to tell him of other things and tell him about the media and tell them about other things how how God had used it in different ways. He was so affected and I got to thinking, you know, here's this here here's such a tragedy that took place and so many have have suffered and agonized as a result of it. But be it known, God also knew this. God knew it's going to touch some heart weeks, months later, still continues to touch some heart. But I was thankful I can stand there and say through it all, through it all, we've just lived lived the life of Christ in front of them. That's the testimony that we want. That's the testimonies as a church we want. I don't care what other believers churches even do. &gt;&gt; I'm concerned what this one does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And whatever reaction that we ever have, whatever we ever display from this church, from this congregation, from you as individuals, we want to make sure it's the spirit of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust you've been blessed with the word. I trust that it's a &gt;&gt; through it all. &gt;&gt; I've come to trust in Jesus. Hallelujah. Is it okay, friends? &gt;&gt; I spoke out of my heart this morning, &gt;&gt; and I never quite get done, but I think that you see where I'm at. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The whole key and the whole theme of the service this morning is that you have unlocked, undiscovered, godly resources in you which are are of deity. It's not from your parents. It's from your heavenly parent. You have that in you &gt;&gt; and God is determined to cause that to be developed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's going to allow everything that comes our way, whatever it might be, let's not shun it and let's not let us take it down. I I say in the name of Jesus Christ, don't let anything that comes your way in this world take you down. I've seen some where it's taken them down. You look at it and say, "God knows my life. God has allowed this to happen. God has brought this my way, and through it all, I will overcome." &gt;&gt; That's not just some nice words. &gt;&gt; You've heard me say this before while the musicians are coming. I never forgot this. a young single man listening to an old preacher, probably about my age, and he said, "You know, when you get in trouble and you get into a deep dark hole," he said, "This is what I say to God. God, we are in a big dark hole. You get out, I'll hang on, and we'll both be out." &gt;&gt; And I thought that was good. I've remembered it all my life. But you want to be able to say we, not I got in here. Not that I created my own situation. Don't be found there, but we got into this hole. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through it all. Let's stand as we sing it. [Music] I learn to trust in Jesus. And I trust in God. [Music] I learn to sing that chorus again, please. I trust in Jesus. [Music] [Music] [Music] verse number three says [Music] Where you [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] I learn to depend upon his word. &gt;&gt; In the good times, the bad times. Oh, praise him. And then, Brother John, Brother John Andy's going to have you come and close us in prayer. Amen. Yeah. In our [Music] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Yeah. [Applause] Praise his name. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] I'm going to ask a brother John Andy's to come and pray. We're praying not only not merely to dismiss the service. That's not the main point. I don't know just exactly where your heart is in the state of your heart at this moment. But I am praying as I have already that God would take the words and that you by the Holy Spirit will see God in your life. And you'll see also if there's some obstruction, something that has hindered you, I encourage you, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to dismiss it and to dis dispense with it and to surrender it up and let wash. Let it be washed away by the washing of the water of the word. Amen. Amen. Can the congregation say amen to that? You have let people praying for you. Settle it now with God. Do business with God and let the service be a fruitful fruitful service in the kingdom of God. Brother John, would you pray and pray for the people? I ask. Amen. [Music] Heavenly Father, just in the atmosphere, the close of this meeting, after hearing what you've spoken to us today, we just want to offer ourselves to you again. And let your word come out of our lives exactly what you've sent it out to do, to accomplish in each heart that's here. and all of us praying together that your word would be manifested in our lives according to your will and according to your way and in your time. Father, we've heard from the start of the service about a gentile lady that responded correctly. &gt;&gt; Father, at this end time when it is for the Gentiles and there's a promise that there's a Gentile lady that will respond correctly, We want to respond correctly. We want our hearts to say yes Lord. We are we want to be obedient children. We want to be a submissive wife. Every attribute that is in us. We desire to respond favorably according to your design and your thoughts and all that you would have within us. Let it flower out, Lord Jesus. This isn't just a prayer. &gt;&gt; This is our response to the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; we could wash our feet with our tears and that would be wonderful. We could kiss your face and say, "I do." But Lord, we want to leave the service and go out and do what your desire is for our lives. And Lord, I feel that's the greatest response. Not just an emotion or for this altar to be full of people, but for us after hearing your word to say, I will do what your word has spoken to me. And Lord, Father, may you anoint every life, every man, every woman, all of us together individually to Lord, accomplish what your desire is. And we submit ourselves. We've heard your word. Now live it through our lives, God. Let the uncction of God and the anointing of your spirit be upon every vessel in every life. Even when we leave here, Lord, let the word continue to unfold and be lived out. Cross every tea and dot every eye and complete your design in our lives. Lord, we want to come home to meet with you. And we want to live forever in this atmosphere, but we understand that there's a work for you to do through our lives. And that is no less deity than it was Jesus Christ walking on the shores of Galilee. It is no less Jesus Christ walking in June the 1st, 2008. And we want to recognize that and say amen to the word of God. Flow through our lives, God. And let us see you even in the minor areas of our lives, not just the major, but the minors, that the symphony of your desire could be flowing through each heart that's here. And we pray one for the other. Lord, we pray for every brother and every sister that you, Lord, would just cap off our lives together with a capstone of your desire. and we believe that you're able to do miracles and signs and wonders that follow after the word. So we open up our lives to healings and deliverances and salvation and adoption and all that you have for us. We just believe that you are doing that right now because your word will not return unto you void for it is accomplishing what you sent it out to do in our lives today, God. And I pray that you'd continue this afternoon and in the evening service which we're so happy. And Lord, you've given us so much in this day. You've made it so easy for us. And we just want to respond accordingly and say, Lord, be it unto us according to your word. And we just yield ourselves today. Go with every life and continue your plan in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We dismiss you in Jesus Christ's name. Thank you for being here. Trust you can go away with something and we'll see you this evening. You're God bless you. You're dismissed. Amen. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Come on. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Thank you. Heat. Heat. [Music] I think she [Music] One more [Music] time. [Music] Thank you. Let's [Music] go. [Music] Wonder. [Music]
