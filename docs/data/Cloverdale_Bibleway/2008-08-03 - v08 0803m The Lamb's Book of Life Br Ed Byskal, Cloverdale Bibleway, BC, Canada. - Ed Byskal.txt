Ask your brother David to burn up, Brother Dave to come and open the service in a word of prayer. We've got a number of prayer requests here this morning. And uh we're not going to read them all. We're just going to have our brother Dave lay hands on them. Uh we do have a sis a testimony from sister Patty Pettigill. I believe uh just wants to thank the Lord for their her prayers on her behalf. She was supposed to take uh 6 to 8 weeks to recover from a broken rib, a cracked rib, and uh she's fine now. And she's just thanking the Lord for that. So we want to take these requests before the Lord. Amen. If you've got a need this morning, just look before the Lord as we go to prayer. If you're listening in on the internet, you just lift any request you have. The Lord sees every need even before we ask. Amen, brother David. [Music] Let's bow our heads. Our precious Lord Jesus, it's been so wonderful to be here this morning just lifting our voices to give our Lord and Savior praise and glory.

There is none other worthy, Lord. &gt;&gt; We want the fruit of our lips to give you glory this morning, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; The great things you've done for us, Lord. Just thinking of the songs we're singing, Lord. When we thinking how the things of life are so empty and vain, Father, when we get to the other side, all that's going to matter, Lord, is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, our natural accomplishments, our jobs, our our material possessions, nothing will mean anything on that day when we finally cross over. Lord, help us to keep it all in perspective. Father, this life is but a vapor, Lord, and it's quickly fading, Father. Lord, we thank you to be in your presence. I lay out my hands upon these prayer requests. Those that have penned them down, Lord, they've had faith, Lord, that the prayers of the saints availth much. Lord, we just stand agreeing for every need that my hands are laid upon this morning. We agree with those that have pinned them down. We agree with those that the need is for.

We commit this day, this service, pray you'll have a preeminence, Father. And we pray for our brother Ron Spencer. Just praying that you'll just touch his body, Lord. We know he's having a need in his body from this accident still. Just pray give him stamina. Give him give him wind in his lungs, Lord.

Jeremy [Music] I want to present the life of Christ. It's my aim today. For in his image I want to stand so blameless on that day. [Music] And though this world may criticize, it will never understand [Music] that I can't rest until I be a perfect man. What are you going to present to the Lord at the end of your journey? He's not going to be touched by anything save his testimony. What are you going to present to the Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry. Don't be found in that position where you will be wondering why. [Music] Though this world may offer its pleasure and peace and luxurious life of ease, but it simply cannot continue on for lands just like a breeze. A moment here and a moment gone. Like a flower they fade away. Oh, but I just want to stay right on to that perfect day. [Music] Take rest my soul in no other arms. Save Jesus on today. For he has opened my eyes to see that judgement is on its way. And though 10,000 fall at my side, I will never be tossed aside. [Music] For in the shadow of that mighty rock is where I'll abide. [Music] Oh, what are you going to present to the Lord at the end of your journey? He's not going to be touched by anything save his testimony. Oh, what are you going to present to the Lord? I hope it makes you sigh and cry. Don't be found in that position where you will be wondering why. Lord, take thy word, thy precious word, and anoint it to my soul. Perfect what is lacking in my faith, and make thy servant whole. Drive all fears and all doubts away. For I just want to hear you say, "Receive, receive thy crown, my beloved son. You have overcome. [Applause] Well done. [Music] For what are you going to present to the Lord at the end of your journey? He's not going to be touched by anything save his testimony. Oh, what are you going to present to the Lord? And I hope it makes you sigh and cry. Don't be found in that position where you will be wondering why. [Music] Don't be found in that position where you [Music] will be wondering why. [Music] [Applause] Thank you, brother Jeremy. &gt;&gt; All that really matters is serving him. &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning the word now. I think there's a baby dedication as well. Just as brother Ed comes, let's sing. Open my eyes that I may see glimpses of truth. &gt;&gt; Open my eyes. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Glory. [Music] [Applause] My God. I will see. Oh my. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I hear that I hear voice of [Applause] his and the [Music] wall will disappear. [Music] Sil [Music] [Applause] to [Music] Oh my [Music] Jesus. Silently now. Silently now I wait for [Music] my heart. I will to see. Open my eyes to Mary. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Speak to me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Open our hearts. That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to see you all. And we're so grateful for the for the touch of God upon our souls. &gt;&gt; Those of you that are sitting in the foyer, I trust you'll be able to remain focused. We're sorry we don't have the uh the live streaming to the fellowship room today because so much of the equipment our equipment has gone uh to to the camp for the meetings. And uh we're looking forward to a great time this week. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Before we uh go any further, we I have a baby dedication this morning and we're going to dedicate the child of our brother Randy and sister Sharon Timberlins. Why don't we just sing a verse of a chorus bring them in or Jesus loves the little children. He does love them. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had time to he took time and sometime you know in the message or I listen to some of the messages you have brother Brandon will take so much time &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; dedicating the children &gt;&gt; and I maybe you've had it too we've thought hope he gets over this because I want to get to the message part this was important and so we're really happy to have uh brother Randy school principal, his good wife, and his family. Increasing family, three daughters. You know what that means? [Music] I I I I don't want to make a doctrine out of it, but I've said it so many times that it proves we have a we have a man. And I tell you what, tell you one one thing, brother Randy, from a from a brother who's have three and not only three, but a wife that makes four. &gt;&gt; It shows that God intends the man to learn patience. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus love. Can we sing that? Jesus loves the children of the world. [Music] Oh, Jesus loves the little children. All the children of the world, [Applause] black and white, they are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world. I really felt touched by God when I was just looking to the Lord for this dedication. Brother Randy and sister Sharon have called their child Carara Elise. I think I have that right. And Cara is dear one or beloved one. And Elise is consecrated. And I have found in the Hebrew that is uh my God is a vow. [Music] I thought of Hannah when she brought the child to Eli, brought Samuel, a child. This is a daughter. It's not a son, but it's a daughter. And but they have there's one thing in common between Hannah and Sister Sharon and brother Randy. And this was her statement to Eli. For this child I prayed. &gt;&gt; And I know that that was so in your case. For this child I prayed. And she says, "And the Lord hath given me my petition which I have asked of him." And I was thinking of that and I'd like to convey to the congregation. God heard that prayer and God has heard your prayer. And God gave a child that matched the prayer. Uh I I thought of uh Samuel. God alone is able to determine who and how many needed that child Samuel. David needed him. Saul needed him. &gt;&gt; Israel needed him &gt;&gt; and God needed him. &gt;&gt; And I can say about this child, you prayed for this child. God has answered your prayer. As parents, you needed this child. She's going to contribute something to the family. The siblings, her sisters needed this child. And if the Lord Jesus carries and time goes on, she's going to sit with some other young people and they're going to need this child. That's what I'm going to pray for today. that she would live that kind of a life and perhaps in God's extra measure of grace that God may give her a voice like her mom. She's using it now. It's getting practiced. Maybe she'll have a voice like her mother and move someone and the Holy Spirit could use her &gt;&gt; and someone's burdens will be lifted &gt;&gt; as she would sing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody in the body of Christ will need a child. &gt;&gt; And we know not who needs a child. But I can tell you something else about this child. There's angels of God around the child. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon really taught us. Yes, &gt;&gt; that we need to be careful how we raise our children &gt;&gt; because the angels of God are around them. And that's for all of us that are parents today. &gt;&gt; We need to care for our children as gifts from God. And so I'm going to pray for this child for one more reason. Jesus Christ needs her. And that we know nothing about right now. But Jesus Christ needs her. Needs her for a vessel. Needs her to express something that is given her part. That's her part to express. And I'm going to dedicate her to that cause. Cara Elise. Amen. She doesn't need too many vitamins. May God prosper her soul the same way. Heavenly Father, we pray for this child, Cara Elise. And in the name of Jesus Christ, may the Holy Spirit rest upon her. May she be an instrument, Father, as we are dedicating her to you and giving her to you and her parents, Sister Sharon and Brother Randy standing here, Lord. I pray, oh God, that you'll watch over her. Keep her from the ways of sin. Keep her from the ways of unbelief. Lord, keep her from the bombs and the snares, I pray, and the temptations. Keep her, I pray, Lord, keep her in good health. Watch over her. I now dedicate Carara Elise to you to your service to make her blessing in the home in the name of Jesus Christ. May the Holy Spirit rest upon her. Amen. God bless you, brother Randy. God bless you. Amen. God bless you, Sister Sharon. Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Our brother Mike Cosalino had received a letter from his son who those of you in the congregation know the difficulties that he encountered and uh how God has dealt with him in his in his condition. He's in prison in Japan and he has written and he said this just in part, I know if I had not been back I know if I had been back home I wouldn't have been so close to God or gotten to know the message of our prophet. To be honest, I never took Malachi 45 and 6 serious until God allowed me to be in this situation. and today humbled me. He went on to say, I thank Jesus because through this I am no longer a slave and have a new master which is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And brother uh brother Mike has been providing his son with message books. and he said that there's another man there and they are uh being blessed by the message books together and by the letters that are being sent. So sometimes God has to bring a great difficulty to a person before they come to realization what life is all about, &gt;&gt; what the real issues of life is about. this last week and I'm able to speak uh somewhat more freely this morning because we're not streaming live streaming. If we were live streaming, I wouldn't be able to say what I'm going to say in the next few minutes. But this last week, I don't know what kind of week you had, but some of our some of our brothers and sisters just like a sister just like any sister here and a brother like any brother here only he's a minister on July 31st at 11:00 in the morning. We got an email. Brother Murphy did. And uh brother, I won't give his name or the province, but he was taken away by the police. He was arrested yesterday uh when they were having a service at his home. And his wife called another brother in the south of China and asked us to pray for him. uh they said that he used to be one of the leaders of a three self church and as you know the three self church is is a recognized church in China and it's it's recognized by the government and so they don't have any difficulty but he used to be a leader of in that group and 3 years ago he came he came out of it which really upset the authorities and he's been constantly visited by the three self leaders and they've tried intimidation and even bribery wanting him to come back but he never moved and this is the first time that he was taken away by the police that was July 31st July 31st at 3:23 in the afternoon we have another news a few minutes ago and a sister in their church was taken away. This is another church was taken away by the police. They interrogated her then searched her house and found all the messages that they had just printed uh with their printer and their CDs and they took all the materials back to the police station and the further action is not clear. This is the place that the two old brothers were detained for 10 days last time. Then on August the 1st, the next day, we received another communication and the first brother who was taken away by the police was released this morning. He was having a meeting in another village when the police came uh and took took him away together with the message books that he carried. That's that's when he was taken away. But they asked him uh to either pay a,000 R&B which is their money fine or be locked up for 15 days in detention center which is prison. And uh they told him that he could go home. Basically they they felt assured that he would go home and get the money. And the second day, the police came to his home and asked him if he made up his mind what to do. And he said, "I will go with you to the detention center." They were shocked by what they considered this insensible answer. Because they felt that the fine was really quite sensible, quite reasonable. And then the brother answered, "This is not a matter of money." And actually his son-in-law, this pastor's son-in-law, brought the money so he could pay the fine, but he refused. And they brought the money, but he refused to take it. And he said he would rather go to jail for the sake of the word of God because he had not done anything wrong. Then the police took him back to the police station. When he was there, they had a very lengthy conversation and they commanded him to write a guarantee not to believe this man called William Brandham anymore. So the police know what they're doing. He said, "I never did believe him. I believed the message that God sent him to bring to me." &gt;&gt; I thought that was a wise answer. Then they said, "Why have you why you have all of the books, all of his books, if you don't believe him?" He asked them, "Do you think it's abnormal for a preacher to have some spiritual materials? Who doesn't?" And they couldn't answer. And then they warned him not to go to any other places to have meetings in the future, but only at home. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that sounding like the book of Acts? Brother Murphy adds, "Let's keep praying for our brother and the saints." Uh he said, "The situation is still not clear. The sister has not been released as far as we know. But we know one thing. When God's children standing on his word, then the Lord is obligated to come on the scene in the right time as he did to the Hebrew children. Brother Murphy, these are his words. The Lord never put the fire out but only took the heat out of it. &gt;&gt; The Lord never killed the lions but only closed their mouths. Praise be to his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, we're thankful for that. These are we're not dwelling on history. We're telling you what happened since you sat here last Sunday. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you it's a supernatural gospel. &gt;&gt; We believe in it and we're glad we're part of it. We're glad we're in contact with these people almost on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; We're glad for the message that has gone into China and many, many different places. We'll never forget the work that our brother John Lei here in the church, brother John Sacker, and incidentally, brother John Sacker and brother Ivan who's with us from here are both over there right now. And so just an added note, we need to really pray for them. &gt;&gt; We need to pray for them. You're never out of danger when you're carrying this gospel and this word. And you can you can hear from this. They know what it's all about. I tell you what, the police in China have got a lot of message books. &gt;&gt; I think they took about 150 from us when we were there. So, we're thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Let them have them. &gt;&gt; We print all the message books the police want. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, this week is coming up is a a milestone week for us. And just allow me an extra few minutes before we turn to the word. It's a milestone. It's the first time we've wrenched and wrestled with a place to gather and have a kind of family camp meeting. Our brother Ron Spencer will be arriving on Tuesday. And uh I just want to uh thank you for your prayers, but I want to ask you please for your continued prayers. We don't want just uh a gathering of people. We don't want just an emotional high. We want a supernatural experience. &gt;&gt; We want to see uh men and women, boys and girls, young people that need deliverance. We want to see them delivered. Right. &gt;&gt; We want to see the healing. If homes need healing, may homes be healed. If bodies need healing, may bodies be healed. May the supernatural and I know looking down into your faces today throughout this congregation. There's a there is needs. There's burdens on your heart. And I pray that God will minister to those. I'm praying that God will give words and direct his thoughts to brother Ron. Even I've been praying that this last week. Give him your thoughts. Channel him right in the direction that you want us to have for this time. And I said to you, I think last week, I believe that it is a supernatural thing that God preserved his life. What all he's called on to do, I do not know. But I know one thing. I believe that he was preserved also for these meetings. &gt;&gt; I believe that. And let's pray for those that need to baptism of the Holy Ghost that they will receive that. I mean, I'm talking about a transformed life. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm not talking about some emotional experience. I'm talking about a transformed life. And from that day on, they're changed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? From that day on, they can say, "From that time, it was all different." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to thank this congregation. So so many of you have worked so hard to make it possible and we are we are very very humbled by it and deeply appreciate it. Others have opened their homes for friends and family and some of visitors and brother Ron and his family to stay and I really appreciate that. I just wish I could thank you the way I would like to thank you. So, I say let's keep our minds on God this week and see what God has in store for us. I believe it'll be a supernatural time. I really do. &gt;&gt; When you come to the grounds, you'll you we were there just quickly for a couple of hours yesterday and so many things. is just a different place, a different atmosphere. And uh so we're we're we're just in in expectation and I trust you will come that way. Those of you from the this side of the border now going the other side let you know that you should probably go down early, very early to beat the crowd. Uh one group of our young people was 4 hours yesterday getting across the border. 4 hours. And uh so if you haven't got Nexus, you and you hit it at the wrong time, you're going to be there quite a long time. It' be good to listen to the radio or or find out ahead of time which crossing might be the best one. Let's stand, shall we? And I'd like to just say, "Have thy own way, Lord. Have thy own way, brother. Have thy own way." How many of you can join me in that in one spirit? Have thy own way, Lord. Have thy way, you young people. Are you with me on that? Have your own way, Lord. Not my will, but thine be done. Have they have Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] He lives. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Our loving Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We're so thankful and happy today that we have that name that's been given to us. First spoken on the lips of an angel. Thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins. And here we stand today redeemed. Redeemed by that one. Oh, we're so appreciative this morning, Lord, for what you have done. I pray that you'll move throughout this audience, oh God. Move, we pray, upon every heart. The needs that are here, I pray, Lord, that the Holy Spirit will conquer the need. I pray, oh God, you'll move every heart. Move us into an expectation. Move us into a yieldedness, Lord. Move us into a contact one on one. Each individual person in touch with the almighty God. Father, I pray that you will to take and direct us, Lord. Anoint your word in our into our hearts. I pray, Lord, you will just cause me to say what needs to be said this morning. And may this word, oh God, be something that will establish and build the hearts of the people. I pray, Father, that you will bring a release of the Holy Spirit upon us, oh God. Pray you'll take away the formality. Father, take away the fear of of one another or the whatever it may be that would restrict or hinder. I pray that we will be a yielded people, Lord. Yielded to the Holy Spirit. We're joining in prayer now and we're asking that this shall be done in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to take your Bibles if you would please. We'll turn to the book of Revelation, the 20th chapter. We're going to begin reading at the 11th verse. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead which and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. On into chapter 21. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be his and and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away. &gt;&gt; And the people could say amen to that. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats and stay real attentive now with as little movement as possible. I would appreciate as we approach this word I want to speak on a subject that maybe you have given a good deal of thought about uh as you've read the various messages and seen in the in the word as we've read this morning. I want to speak on the book of life and the lamb's book of life uh in the context of deity and humanity. So the book of life and the lamb's book of life. And in order to set uh set the scene, I'm going to give about three quotes that should uh put all of our thoughts in in in one channel. In the invisible union of the bride, brother Brandham said, excuse me, here it brings into view the two books that that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of the seven church ages. The two books, book of life, one says you can put your name on it and it never comes off. And the other one says that you take his name out of the book of life. That brings it perfectly in view right there. Then on in another place, invisible union, he said, "Oh my, there is your two books. One of them is the book is the lamb's book of life and your name on there is predestinated on there. It can't go because you can no more take that away than nothing because it was foreord ordained to be on there. But the regular book of life, you can take that off at any time. Then in works is faith expressed. He said when you get the book, he's referring to the church age book. You're going to be you're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what I said. The two books of life, it's the same book, &gt;&gt; but the one of them is your natural birth &gt;&gt; and the other one is your spiritual birth. &gt;&gt; In another place, he said the one runs out into the other. &gt;&gt; And then uh he said in another place there's only one book. But so in order for you to follow me in the service this morning, it's as though there's two parts. There is your natural life &gt;&gt; and our deeds are recorded &gt;&gt; and there's our new birth and our spiritual life. &gt;&gt; Right? And so uh in in in the overall subject it it actually comprises your natural life and your spiritual life and I believe every part of it. And so uh in order to understand complete justification because in justification uh in justification is to have all. Now listen to listen to this statement real carefully. Justification as brother Brandham taught it is to have all that we acquired through our natural birth that is not of God or not deity erased &gt;&gt; permanently &gt;&gt; irrevocably erased &gt;&gt; from our book and from the record of our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, where's justification? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If something's going to filter through &gt;&gt; of our old life, &gt;&gt; where are we? &gt;&gt; Where are we standing? &gt;&gt; And that is why he would say when when when sin is confessed, &gt;&gt; it drops into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and it breaks up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the very elements of the ink breaks up &gt;&gt; and can never be found again. &gt;&gt; That's when sin is confessed. And that what I say is taking place from between the two books which is really only one book. But you have your natural life, the book of life. And the book of life for the believer &gt;&gt; becomes the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is there is no sin in that book. Yes. &gt;&gt; So all that the blood washed away from us, all that the blood washed away from us &gt;&gt; can never find its way into the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought that would rejoice your &gt;&gt; glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. in the message investments. No, even though I've been preaching just a little bit slower and perhaps a little bit more laborious, don't don't fail to say sickle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message investments, he said, and I have quite a few quotes just at the first part of the service here. He said, "Notice when this your sins are confessed and your sins are dropped into the bleach of the blood of the son of God, it remits a sin so much that it's put in the sea of God's forgetfulness and can never even be remembered in his sight anymore." &gt;&gt; That's justification. And we need that because I tell you what, you you you know perhaps as well as I do, Satan is relentless &gt;&gt; at trying to bring condemnation. &gt;&gt; He's a master at condemnation. But you can hold this up in front of him. Satan, I have a voice that's more powerful. He's called a prophet of God and a voice of God, the word of God, saying, "Thus says the Lord." That sin can never be remembered again. You might carry some scars, whatever. He might point to the scars, might point to the failures. The sin is gone. The sin can never find its way into the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "And then what that does is make uh that done to make a man a son of God." &gt;&gt; God. God. He said, God puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness, the bleach. The sea of forgetfulness is Christ's blood that was shed for you. And therefore then you and God are father and son by Jesus Christ grace. &gt;&gt; Father God and you are father and son &gt;&gt; by the grace of Jesus Christ. Oh, I love that. Not by anything you have done but by the by his grace. You are sons and daughters of God and a partaker of his blessings and of his power and of his life. His life is in you. For you are a son of God. Oh, if the church could if we could only uh would only to represent that. He says if the church could we would only to represent that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the life uh of every person is recorded in the book of life. The life of every person, every human is recorded in the book of life. And the scriptures which we read describe two classes of people. &gt;&gt; Some that are going to stand before judgment, the great white throne judgment, and those that do not stand before judgment. the we're we're judged here. &gt;&gt; We've allowed the word to judge us now. &gt;&gt; And in a congregation like this, let me say this as your brother. &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here today listening to my voice and the message that God has given me, it would be utter folly. You do yourself the most serious injustice &gt;&gt; if you resisted the opportunity and the offer that God has given. Here's the bleach. Here's the blood. Here's the fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's face. Just confess it. And if you stay and doubt that, there's no hope. &gt;&gt; There's only white throne judgment for you. &gt;&gt; But those that are predestined have been elected with &gt;&gt; and this has been made possible by this scripture. and he came the lamb. When John saw and heard the voice that the lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed to loose the seals and he turned to see the lion and saw a lamb and the lamb didn't just stand there, but the lamb he came. &gt;&gt; Beautiful words. He came. There was action. There was motion. There was motivation. There was plan. There was objective. There was motive. He came. and took the book. &gt;&gt; That's when the book became the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; And in taking the book, he erased all the sin, every mark, every stain. In that one action when he took the book, I said, "Praise God for the to folks. It was the book that and that book had the record of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have the book of all your failures. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. He took my failures. He didn't just take the book. He took my failures. He took my sin. He took those things that would so made me feel so guilty. They're gone. &gt;&gt; He had one action to &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And took it from one and one ran into the other. He said, "All of our deeds in the images of Christ, all of our deeds are recorded on the book of life in works as faith expressed." He said, "But let us have let us have all of our deeds done right because they're in a book, a record that's to be played at the day of judgment." Amen. &gt;&gt; Went on to say in that same message, your name of your first nature, this was actually believe in invisible union. Your name of your first nature. You see, your name really expresses who you are. &gt;&gt; It's not just that you're called to something, you know, Mary or Susie or Bill or John or whatever. That's you might say, "Well, that's my name." No, you're that only represents who you are. You are what you live. &gt;&gt; That's what you are. &gt;&gt; You are what you'll be remembered for. &gt;&gt; When you think of Einstein, &gt;&gt; you don't just think of a man. You think of a great scientist. &gt;&gt; You think of someone who was a a a world leader in his field. &gt;&gt; When you when you think say Beetho Beethoven, you think of music. You think of some uh name some artist when you think when you say the name William Marian Brham right away you think of the message. What are you thinking about? You're thinking what is life? You think what way to straightest time doing? [Music] Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Your name your of your first nature was born and put in a book of life and all your deeds were wrote in it too. Everything you done under that nature was put in the book called the book of life. &gt;&gt; Now he said your old book is gone. &gt;&gt; Your old book is gone with your old union. &gt;&gt; So you were born united to it. &gt;&gt; Said now your old book is gone and your name in your old he said has been transferred. &gt;&gt; He said do you mean to tell me that my old book? He said, "God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness." Your old book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You stand perfectly before God. &gt;&gt; Your name is now on the new book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; On the new book, not in the book of life, but in the Lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; There's a big difference, friends. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the lamb's. He says, "What what the lamb redeemed, not the old book of your natural union, but your new bride." Hallelujah. Glory. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a marriage certificate. &gt;&gt; I got one at home. I couldn't probably find it right. Couldn't lay my hands on it right now. But I got another marriage certificate. It's called the lamb's blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the one that the lamb took. &gt;&gt; Oh, and what what a glorious &gt;&gt; what a glorious thing. What a glorious act. &gt;&gt; And he rose to their mind by claiming them. And in that claiming every sin was covered, every dark stain might come. It can never never be remembered again. &gt;&gt; You got a memory channel, but don't let Satan plug something in you. Keep yourself clear from that. You tell them you have no right to my memory. You have no right to my conscience. &gt;&gt; You have no right to darken my conscience. &gt;&gt; I move you back by the word of God by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This channel of your conscience and your memory belongs to the lamb of God. He bought it. He paid for it. &gt;&gt; So I can have thoughts of him and he came and took the book. &gt;&gt; And I find the word in the in the Greek, he took the book so very very interesting. And here are here are a number of statements that comprise that one word. He took the book. The first one is to take what's his own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a record of a lot of people &gt;&gt; in that book. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My sheep &gt;&gt; hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; My sheep. &gt;&gt; Can you identify yourselves there? &gt;&gt; Right now, you need to say, &gt;&gt; "I either want to hear or I not want to hear." And if deep down in your heart, maybe you're not where you ought to be, but if deep down in your heart, &gt;&gt; deep down in your heart, &gt;&gt; in the very very deep recess, you know you're born to be a child. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, don't wait for this. &gt;&gt; This is the power of the gospel. This is the Holy Spirit. [Music] &gt;&gt; Deny him. Deny that lie. &gt;&gt; Deny Satan. &gt;&gt; If you don't, there'll only be more scars. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; It'll only the the news will only get tighter. &gt;&gt; The chains will only be another another wrap around you. &gt;&gt; I know. I've been there. &gt;&gt; But I also know they've been broken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let him put a damper on your life. &gt;&gt; He came to take his own. &gt;&gt; Not all are his own. &gt;&gt; But to take what is one's own and to take it not just to take it, but to take it to oneself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can see that lamb as it were. He didn't just take the book and say, "Oh, father, I got the book." No, he embraced that book. &gt;&gt; These are mine. They belong to me. &gt;&gt; I'm buying them. &gt;&gt; I love them. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz they came out from him. &gt;&gt; They're part of him. &gt;&gt; That's number one. To claim for oneself. Friends, for those of you that know this message in the in the seals before he breaks into seal number one and on through seven and questions and answers in the bridge, he goes back to Boaz and Ruth who I may touch on this morning yet and says and and because what what is happening there is Ruth is being redeemed. &gt;&gt; What is what is redemption? It is to buy back Amen. &gt;&gt; What belonged to you in the first place? &gt;&gt; Let us reconcile to reconcile to God. Let us reconcile to bring back to United King. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been reconciled to God. &gt;&gt; We have been redeemed by the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do what you want. I'm going to have a glorious you want. I'm going to preach anyhow. I just feel it so burning on my heart. We will redeem. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wo to those that would say not me. &gt;&gt; It's not for me. &gt;&gt; I tell you, hell is is a terrible, terrible place. And the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; Let's say it. &gt;&gt; And it can't be any other way. &gt;&gt; You play with fire, you're going to get burned. You play with sand, you're going to get burned. &gt;&gt; It's going to drag you to a place you don't want to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to say today, this is a glorious road, this highway of holiness. &gt;&gt; And the second thing in the breach, he says he comes forth. What's he talking about? Coming to take the book. He's talking about that very scripture in Revelation 5. He comes forth &gt;&gt; and takes the book of redemption &gt;&gt; to claim his rights of what he did for us. &gt;&gt; Says, "I've got the price." He's Boaz, &gt;&gt; the mighty man of wealth. &gt;&gt; Where's the wealth? It's in his blood. &gt;&gt; No one had blood like that. &gt;&gt; No one could pay the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; No one was shitless. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; By himself &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; he had the He was Boaz, the mighty man of wealth. He took the book and took it to himself. &gt;&gt; It was claiming you. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to go over the edge for some of you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; In in coming in the end time, he came. He descended according to Revelation 10:1. He descended for the purpose. And when he descended, Revelation 10:1, the book is open. &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself. He is that book. He is the word. He's revealing himself to his bride because because a bride in the bridegroom must know him. &gt;&gt; No more secrets. &gt;&gt; This isn't a courtship anymore. This is marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in a marriage with a bunch of secrets. even a marriage that's open &gt;&gt; to one another. &gt;&gt; That's what marriage is all about. &gt;&gt; And he came to be married. &gt;&gt; Had a prophet on earth to do the ceremony. &gt;&gt; That's what the invisible union was all about. I'm not talking in poetic license. That's what happened. &gt;&gt; He conducted the ceremony. &gt;&gt; And the word was there. Christ himself uniting to his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had to have that kind of ministry to unite them together. &gt;&gt; The same ministry he showed 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; And he did it today. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell people's names and reveal a secret in their heart to tickle their ears. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't for those out there. They rejected it. &gt;&gt; They rejected him who did it. &gt;&gt; Like those in the time of Jesus, they received the healing, received the miracles, but in the time of receiving his word, they refused it &gt;&gt; and died. We haven't refused it. We received it &gt;&gt; and we love it. &gt;&gt; It's not it. It's him. &gt;&gt; The word is him. &gt;&gt; And the next thing when he took it, &gt;&gt; it is to associate to associate with oneself as companion. And a companion in the scripture is even as a wife &gt;&gt; who's a partner &gt;&gt; as a companion. And he came to associate. He didn't come just take a book. He came to marry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To marry them as a bride &gt;&gt; and take her to himself. &gt;&gt; As a companion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not just as a friend. This is some kind of loose relationship which they do have here in the world so much today. This kind of we're going to hang loose. This isn't hang loose. This is be tight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Glad you're all here. I'm glad you're saying amen. &gt;&gt; And then when he took the book, it has a third meaning. That is what has been taken will not be let go. &gt;&gt; They will not let it go. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said you have been taken in. &gt;&gt; See, he will not let you go. You hate him. I will not let this go. &gt;&gt; There is no one that can take that book out of his hand. You are included. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Isn't this isn't this complimentary to the scripture &gt;&gt; where it says all that the father hath given me &gt;&gt; will come &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of it. I will lose one of them. &gt;&gt; I will lose a few of them. I will lose none of them. &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. I will lose none of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you say with me? He will not let me go. &gt;&gt; He will not [Applause] love the song. [Applause] [Music] Glory &gt;&gt; to hold to oneself to lay hold upon and take possession of. But the last is the most beautiful to me. To take the book is to take it in order to carry it away. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. Hallelujah. He didn't just take us so we camp down and live through this little short life here in labor, but he took us to carry us away. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if I go away, &gt;&gt; I will come again and receive you out of my shadow. And where I am, there may be carry you away. &gt;&gt; That's what that was all in that motion of taking the book was in his mind was to carry you away, to never let you go, to never s never see us. He wouldn't let his rock in and then Satan come and darken your darken his name by leaving stains on you. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus stands today and says &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say remember when this done when they did this I can't remember it. &gt;&gt; It's not even in my cont. the sins of God. &gt;&gt; I love the language of the promises. It broke it up. &gt;&gt; It broke the sin out. &gt;&gt; It broke the ink out. It broke the elements until it became bleak. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Check that one out. &gt;&gt; If I had all afternoon, I could maybe lead you into that a wee bit. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We'll touch on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Became bleach. &gt;&gt; My sin became bleach. &gt;&gt; That's power. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the breach. He said, he said, "No one could do it. No one could take this book." and he walked right up to the right hand of God and he took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights. That was you claiming you. &gt;&gt; I died for them. &gt;&gt; I'm the kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; I'm the mediator. &gt;&gt; My blood was shed. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen as I &gt;&gt; He says I am the mediator. &gt;&gt; My blood was shed. I have be I have become man &gt;&gt; and I did this in order to get the church back again &gt;&gt; and the one I foresaw from the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; I have purposed it &gt;&gt; I spoke that it would be there &gt;&gt; and nobody was able to take it but I went down and and done it myself I am their kinsman they have become kin folks &gt;&gt; hallelujah I don't know what your family is my family my human family. And don't consider me disrespectful, but it doesn't mean a whole lot. It's my spiritual family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our spiritual family and souls that are in prison. He said, he said, "Now, now we'll uh now people will still come to the altar." It's talking about in souls in prison. &gt;&gt; They can't do anything while they're in prison. &gt;&gt; People will still come to the altar. They'll still cry out, but it won't do no good. &gt;&gt; It'll be calm. It'll be over. There won't be no more. There won't be no mercy. Remember that. &gt;&gt; And the sanctuary becomes smoking. He that's filthy is filthy still. He that's righteous is righteous still. And he that's holy is holy still. He said there's no more mercy when the lamb takes the book. &gt;&gt; That's it. He said that's all of it. And it it looks a whole lot like it could be now. &gt;&gt; This is 63. &gt;&gt; You say and this is a confusion to a lot of people. So, well, oh, no one can come anymore. That's not what he's saying. He said there'll be no more mercy. And he's preaching to people that were rejecting the message right there &gt;&gt; because the the dispensation which had been committed to the prophet messenger was to carry the word from that denominational era into the bride age. &gt;&gt; You follow me? And the mercy did the the administration of it because in a husband wife relationship the administration changes &gt;&gt; in a proper relationship the husband is to be responsible now to carry the affairs of the household. &gt;&gt; That's what the scriptures teach us. The husband is responsible to carry the affairs of the household. I don't care what the reality is in today's 21st century. I don't care about that, you know, and and women have to take the lead and all the rest of it. I don't believe in it. &gt;&gt; The husband's to be responsible. He's to carry the load. He's to take the administration of the home. She has provided. &gt;&gt; I talked to some man. I said, "Do you provide for your family?" Well, I try. I said, "That isn't what I asked. &gt;&gt; I try. I provide for them. &gt;&gt; I may not give them all that they want, but I provide for them. &gt;&gt; You are you message believer? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the administration changes exactly as those you that have heard the the the administration of the son of man, you remember, and I'm just touching on it very very briefly where the Apostle Paul says a dispensation. If you look into the Greek, it's the administration. &gt;&gt; The administration or the dispensation, a dispensation or an administration of the gospel, he said, has been committed unto me. Why? Because it was changing from law to grace. &gt;&gt; And in this day, in the revealing of the son of man, it's changing from grace to judgment, &gt;&gt; from lamb to lamb. You get it? &gt;&gt; It's in that it's in that change over &gt;&gt; and the the mercy that was obtainable accessible in the past was not accessible under the old system anymore. Look where they went. &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, look where the denomination world. Look where Pentecost has gone. Look where these churches that were full gospel. Look where they've gone. It's shameful. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reportment and conduct is a disgrace &gt;&gt; to the gospel. &gt;&gt; Look at the nakedness of the women &gt;&gt; right in the church. &gt;&gt; Look at the disrespect walking into the house of God with shorts and sandals and whatever more. I don't agree with it. &gt;&gt; I think we should be respectful to &gt;&gt; the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't even go and see the premier of the province or the governor of the state that &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glad you agreed cuz I was going to blast it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we should be respectful to the &gt;&gt; what he's done. &gt;&gt; And so the administration has changed. I've used this example in in the United States especially. They call Washington the administration and they're about to change administration in another few months in November in an election and one of the one of the candidates will be voted in as president whether it's McCain or Obama uh Barack Obama and so one of them are going to get in and sure enough soon as they get in President Bush's signature will not have any power the day he's out. &gt;&gt; Why? because he's gone. &gt;&gt; But right now, he has he has authority. He has power with his Republican party to to uh to enact certain things providing he has control. And so they can do certain things with the resources of the land, the oil that is in Texas and the gold that's in Kentucky, if there's any there. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Any of you folks from the States know there's any gold down there? We haven't got a very confident group, have we? &gt;&gt; Well, if there's any gold in Fort Knox, Kentucky anyway, the resources of the of the land, the resources, understand the resources will come and shift under another administration. And to have to have people to try to use a denominational system to gain access to mercy is trying to go to a president that's been voted out of power and say give me a pardon. &gt;&gt; Say you're talking to the wrong guy. That's just George Bush from Texas. &gt;&gt; Is it right? &gt;&gt; Or to go to Mr. Clinton and say, "Oh, I appealed to you old former president and say I have no more power. &gt;&gt; The administration I'm it's in another administration now. That's what the prophet trying to tell us. &gt;&gt; Mercy's gone. &gt;&gt; He trying to tell those people there's no more mercy. You cannot access it anymore. &gt;&gt; But the word that was coming, which is the message of Christ, and he never lost mercy. &gt;&gt; He has as much mercy today as he had yesterday. And that's why the Apostle Paul says an administration or a dispensation has been committed to me because they could get it under the high priest just a few years before. I said you can't anymore. &gt;&gt; You can kill all the lambs you want. But since the since the gospel has come, you can kill the lambs will be killed in vain. &gt;&gt; Can you understand? The very day that Jesus was the very day Jesus died, the prophet said the merc mercy seat &gt;&gt; came into full view. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What happened the year before? They could kill their lambs, &gt;&gt; they could kill a physical lamb from their flock and and God accepted it. &gt;&gt; Didn't wash their sins away, but they had their sins were covered &gt;&gt; because they're obedient to the word. Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; But now when the word himself &gt;&gt; is spoken &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verbatim &gt;&gt; out of the mouth of a messenger. &gt;&gt; That's Christ. &gt;&gt; And you receive reject that there's no mercy. You receive it. You have mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word the word the word the word has the mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mercy seat's not a chair. &gt;&gt; The mercy seat's not a destination or a location. The mercy seat is in Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; When you receive the message, you receive the mercy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; No more mercy when the lamb tastes. Why? because it has shifted &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; completely &gt;&gt; in harvest time said and he called everything what was on that book he said it's a complete book of redemption &gt;&gt; and this is it the book of redemption he redeemed all was in that book but not out of the book &gt;&gt; what was in the book &gt;&gt; he's the book &gt;&gt; all that are in Christ &gt;&gt; were redeemed &gt;&gt; receive mercy &gt;&gt; and those outside of it those who refused used remained in the book of life &gt;&gt; and that's why when the white throne judgment comes the books are open &gt;&gt; and another book is open &gt;&gt; and the people are judged what's in the book &gt;&gt; if you want to be judged for your deeds reject this message &gt;&gt; if you want mercy &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; from the giver of all mercy &gt;&gt; receive it [Applause] &gt;&gt; you're not receiving this church you're not joining this as they receive Christ, &gt;&gt; the revealed word of this day. &gt;&gt; That is him. &gt;&gt; We want to be thankful. &gt;&gt; Not just myself, but whoever ministers behind these pullpits here, ministers the full word of God, the full council of God. You're not going to hear this down the street. &gt;&gt; You're not going to hear this in the church up the road. You're not going to hear it. You want to thank God I'm here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And events made it clear. He says he was the word of God revealed and the whole complete book of redemption. The Bible is God's word foretelling the future events. Then I in invisible union now still trying to watch my time but we only have one service today. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said like John. He said Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, John 14:12, Joel 2:38 &gt;&gt; says those promises is just exactly like John the Baptist identified himself in the scripture. Jesus identified himself. What's the messenger saying? I'm identifying myself. &gt;&gt; Didn't have to say that's me. He said just came and did what those scriptures &gt;&gt; fortold would happen at this time. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30 was the revealing of the son of man. And he came said that's what he did when he was back here. That's what he's doing today. I'll prove it to you. &gt;&gt; This is a proof of it. &gt;&gt; And what did exactly what Jesus did? &gt;&gt; We haven't got time to go into that. He says, "Identified." Jesus identified himself. He says, "But what did they say? Away with such a person." Right. Right. &gt;&gt; John's a wild man. &gt;&gt; The church wasn't able to receive it. Said that's the pattern. &gt;&gt; That's the pattern. &gt;&gt; And so when this message comes, a different change of administration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You young people, you must know what a change of administration is. You know, you you grow up and all the rest of it and things change. And you come under you young ladies and when you get married you come under another headship. &gt;&gt; I got three girls here but they have their own husbands &gt;&gt; and I don't tell them a whole lot of things because they got husbands to tell them. &gt;&gt; They've got a head in the home and the administration changed from dad to husband. Well, &gt;&gt; it all starts real nice. We got some newlyweds right here, Joel and Esther. God bless you, Sister Esther. You're now got a provider. Sister Christine, she's going to find that out pretty soon. &gt;&gt; Can I tell them about your One thing I like about brother Kyle, just one thing, it's a lot of things, but one thing I like about him, he comes, he's got everything figured out. Now, Brother Ed, uh, you know, I'm interested in this young lady. Okay? I don't quite often I don't ask who it is right away. And I want to know what I have to do. Number one is, you know, what do I do first? And number two, number three. Okay? Maybe sometimes there's four and five questions. So as soon as I answer those questions, he takes it. Okay, fine. Goes out, lets me know, I did one, two, and three. I just going to do two, four, and five now and then we'll be done. And come back say, well, I did that. Now what do I do? See, so we let a little time goes by. So a little time went by and said, I need to see you again. Okay, this thing's moving forward. All right, so you don't mind. We're a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Kyle comes in last service and and uh says I I need to know now what do I do? You know cuz we're I said are you moving towards marriage? Yeah. Okay. You need to talk to her dad. Okay. And then what's the next thing? I said well you need to you know talk to the young lady. And I said don't just go up you know hey will you marry me? You know you got to create an atmosphere. Do something a little bit different. So he said he caught some inspiration from that. And I guarantee nobody has done this. What I talking about? I'm talking about this was a shift of administration &gt;&gt; because sister Christine works at Mary's Garden which is right near our house and it's right on the Nickel Mickel River. So, brother Kyle, he goes and buys a boat, a rubber dingy, and he rolls for an hour and a half up the river. And then he climbs up the bank to see if he's near Mary's garden, like his bride to be is working. And he climbs up there and he sees he's pretty close. So, he gets his trusty cell phone and calls the fellow in the shop or in the store and says, "Would you send Christine out to the riverbank?" Because that's right on the field, you see. So she goes out to the river bank and there he is in the dinghy to propose to her [Applause] like that. Brother Kyle, Sister Christine, I know them well enough to be able to say that and that's as far as I'll go with it. But I'll tell you what, Sister Christine, Mary's garden will be a thing of the past. Brother Kyle takes and shifts the administration. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, bride? &gt;&gt; To know that a whole lot of things. Isn't it wonderful to know the mortgage been paid off? &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know that Satan has no more claim on him? &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to know you're not in debt to him anymore? &gt;&gt; The administration changed. Nothing changed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We came to a marriage. We're married here. We're going to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Just give me another few minutes of your attention please. &gt;&gt; So he said also an invisible union. These very scriptures Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, John 14:12, and Joel 2:38. He identified himself. Said, "And that's the pattern. But to the elected of God, to the elected, he said God's calling to the elected. They know it. Calling the virtuous bride. The word for the last day church, the elected lady of our Lord Jesus Christ. The word. If Jesus is the word, then now I'm taking just a little shift. Hang on. If Jesus is the word, then the bride is always part of &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never loses his pattern. &gt;&gt; He always did it the same way. &gt;&gt; He does it again, calling out the virtuous bride in the last days, the lovely Rebecca waiting for her husband. What a beautiful time. And now he says, "Now here comes into view the two books." See, and I just wanted to get that phrase ahead of it. The beautiful scene of Isaac and Rebecca. He says, "And here comes into view the two books, the book of life and the one where your name and then can come off in the book of of of uh the book of the lamb's book of life." He said, "This brings it perfectly into view." He says, "Life is a sacred thing and it's recorded in a book." &gt;&gt; Those were the quotes I read at the beginning, but this is where they lay in the message. Now he said your first husband that had the rule over you was your nature by natural birth. &gt;&gt; If you're here this morning and you're under that administration of that husband, he's a cruel task minister. &gt;&gt; And brother Biscll is your friend. Today I'm not speaking a sermon. I'm telling you you can be free from &gt;&gt; How can I be free, brother Biscll? I can tell you how you can be free. As soon as you turn and point to Calvary, &gt;&gt; in order to be free from that union, that marriage, &gt;&gt; you have to acknowledge and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Because when he died, &gt;&gt; the only way that marriage can be broken is by the death of the husband. &gt;&gt; And Jesus became sin. &gt;&gt; And took your union &gt;&gt; and died. &gt;&gt; Didn't go to sleep. He died. &gt;&gt; And when he died, your husband died with him. If you accept it, &gt;&gt; you got to accept the pardon. You got to accept the divorce. &gt;&gt; He divorced you from that old nature. You want to sit here with that old nature, that's your problem. &gt;&gt; But if you say, "I believe on Jesus Christ. I believe he died and rose." I can say to you, you're free from that old nature. &gt;&gt; You're free from that. &gt;&gt; You accept it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm here today to tell you, you're free &gt;&gt; from that nature that you were born with &gt;&gt; like Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now here's here's where I'm taking a shift. You have to give some thought to this. I have been thinking very very deep on this for some time. the entire body of scripture. See, sometimes I have to ask a question, sometimes deep provoking questions in order to energize your mind to think and to come up with the right answer. But the entire body of scripture is Christ. Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; But in here is the record of men's sins &gt;&gt; and women's sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And horrible crimes, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; that were committed and wars &gt;&gt; and bloodshed &gt;&gt; and death. And the prophet said, "You've got to be able to look at every scripture and read it and see Christ." &gt;&gt; And I know that stumbles a lot of people, &gt;&gt; even sitting here today. How do I read those terrible things and see Christ? I'll tell you why. Because Christ is greater than the thing you're reading. So, I'm reading a terrible sin. Where do I see Christ? You see him as the savior of that state. &gt;&gt; You read about this war. You read about this bloodshed. What do how can I see Christ in it? You see, the prince of peace is greater than the war. &gt;&gt; But it's recorded because it's recorded in a book called the book of life. &gt;&gt; It's recorded in the book. and the book of life. It wasn't only those people's terrible crimes and terrible sins, but it's anything that say on you &gt;&gt; of your past &gt;&gt; or your recent past &gt;&gt; or this morning. &gt;&gt; Soon as something's done wrong, soon as a sin is committed, we say, "Father, &gt;&gt; I didn't mean that. That's not from my heart. I'm sorry for it. Forgive me for it. &gt;&gt; That act asked alone &gt;&gt; on the authority of God's word &gt;&gt; drops that act into the bleach and it is forgotten, forgotten, forgotten and can never be remembered. &gt;&gt; Friends, if it's not, &gt;&gt; how much has fall? How much has flowed through? &gt;&gt; How much are you carrying? So he says that the entire body now he says the word of God the word is God in letter form. &gt;&gt; How do I reconcile everything you read in the Bible? And this is where my title of my message is. And I want you to see your own life. You need to discern between the humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the deity. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Was G Jesus deity? &gt;&gt; Answer me. Was Jesus &gt;&gt; deity? &gt;&gt; Did Jesus say, "I will be in you." Yes. &gt;&gt; Did he say it? &gt;&gt; I will be in you. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Then his deity come into you. &gt;&gt; But you see, we're a conglomeration of both books. &gt;&gt; We're still in a body &gt;&gt; doing things, thinking things, saying things that we don't really want to do. We have that sticky nature and we and we don't want to just shut our eyes and say, "Well, I'm going to pretend it's not there." No, it's there. But there has already been an atonement made. &gt;&gt; There's already been a provision made. &gt;&gt; There's already been a lamb. Stand up. &gt;&gt; There's already been a lamb. Take the books. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They are mine. &gt;&gt; They're my elected children. And I have the price whereby to erase &gt;&gt; the power to erase &gt;&gt; every every trace of sin, every stain &gt;&gt; because they're mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The entire Bible records both the humanity and the deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. This Bible, &gt;&gt; this Bible records both. &gt;&gt; It records, as I've just put in my notes, some terrible deeds, some wars, some sickness. &gt;&gt; People are afflicted and sick. &gt;&gt; And you read that. I challenge you. You read that, you say, "The prophet of God said you should see Christ." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, you read that. Do you see Christ? &gt;&gt; It's awfully hard. One man got interested one of my school chums. We grew up to be young men. Got married and he was in business and he was from a wellto-do family but he became he became uh interested I will say in in my life and so he he told me he says hey he said I started reading the Bible. He says I started from Genesis I started reading the Bible. He says oh they did some terrible things back there. I said, "Yeah, they did." &gt;&gt; It wasn't until many years later then I pick up a message and hear a prophet say, "You need to see the you need to see Christ in every verse." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, I'm human as you well know &gt;&gt; and have a lot of frailties and weaknesses and I never understood clearly that other book until the last two three weeks. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's why you never heard me preach it before. &gt;&gt; I never understood clearly that you not not William Brown, you need to look at every verse &gt;&gt; and see Christ. &gt;&gt; And I was honest with God. I said, I I read these verses and I can't see you. &gt;&gt; And yet I know it is you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's great. &gt;&gt; How can I see you? &gt;&gt; And I just let it set. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not months, years. &gt;&gt; Years. Then in my study, it becomes like in front of you. &gt;&gt; You read about sin, &gt;&gt; but I'm there because I'm the savior. You read about war, but I'm there because I'm the peacemaker. &gt;&gt; You read about sickness because I'm Jehovah Rafa, the healer. &gt;&gt; I'm the solution to everything in the book of life. I'm the solution and the solution. The answer came and took the book of life and made it the lamb's book of life. Friends, &gt;&gt; the lamb has the answer for your sickness. &gt;&gt; The lamb has the answer for the burden you carry. &gt;&gt; The lamb has the answer. And if we don't get the answer right away, even that's an answer. When he's silent, he's still an answer. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; He's still the answer. &gt;&gt; There's no reason, no, there's no reason why we should doubt him. &gt;&gt; He's already proven his case. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the answer. &gt;&gt; Give me just a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; The lamb slain before the foundation of the world. He's the answer to all these things. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the fullness of the word, had the remedy for every sin that plagued humanity. &gt;&gt; Now, we're still moving. You were taken out from him. That's what the scripture indicates. That's what the prophet of God said. You were taken out from him. &gt;&gt; And still we are plagued with these things that hound us, weaknesses and frailties. &gt;&gt; Is there anything about your life that you really dislike? &gt;&gt; True. Come on. &gt;&gt; Be honest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there's things that we actually there's some things that we actually hate &gt;&gt; about ourselves. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, God, give me the power &gt;&gt; and I will be able to." What we're really saying is, "I can mold it better." &gt;&gt; No, he's the He's He's the potter. &gt;&gt; He's the potter. &gt;&gt; He's the potter. &gt;&gt; Let's say I'm the clay. &gt;&gt; I'm the clay. &gt;&gt; I'm the clay. He's the potter. &gt;&gt; I declare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the way it's going to stay. &gt;&gt; But we came out from him. &gt;&gt; This is him. &gt;&gt; And in here was all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; That's hard to see Christ in. &gt;&gt; But he was what I'm telling you. He was greater than the war. &gt;&gt; He's greater than the trouble. &gt;&gt; He's greater than the sickness. And when you came out from him, you still had some of those things. &gt;&gt; You still carry some of those things. You still have conflicts. You still have, you know, maybe upsets. You have things that take place. You say things. You have attitudes. You have things and you don't want them. You don't like them. You say, "How could I come out of Christ and still have those things?" Because it's humanity and deity. &gt;&gt; It's both humanity and deity. And you need to see deity. &gt;&gt; You need to see Christ &gt;&gt; in your own self. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that, friends. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's that's really the that's really the nut of the service. You need you need to say today, God, give me discernment &gt;&gt; so I can see Christ &gt;&gt; in this person, &gt;&gt; Christ in me. And Christ, we need to have discernment between deity and humanity. [Music] All right. &gt;&gt; If you want, I'll say it again. &gt;&gt; You, I, everybody, &gt;&gt; you need &gt;&gt; you need to really uh refine, exercise &gt;&gt; that ability to discern between &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; humanity and deity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know how much that will help you? It'll help you a whole lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll see somebody and they do something that your spirit says, "Ah, that wasn't really Christian. That really wasn't Christian to do that or to say that." But when you have the discernment &gt;&gt; and you discern and say, That's humanity. &gt;&gt; And the Christ that bought him, &gt;&gt; the Christ that bought her has paid for that. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to leave it with him. &gt;&gt; And then when it's your own self, &gt;&gt; hey, come home now. &gt;&gt; I'll come right to your address. &gt;&gt; And we have a slip up. And we do &gt;&gt; in this walk. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I would have a whole lot less to do &gt;&gt; if you have that discernment between humanity &gt;&gt; and deity. &gt;&gt; The next time you fail, and you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The next time you do something that you're actually ashamed of, the next time you say something, this is not an ex. This isn't a backdoor. This isn't an excuse, but it does happen. It's a reality &gt;&gt; and I'm ask I'm now telling you how to deal with it &gt;&gt; and I believe the Holy Spirit is telling you how to deal with it &gt;&gt; and you need to say first I know I am a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I know that. &gt;&gt; And if I am a son or daughter of God that means even though I feel as low as the dust of the earth I have to confess that I have deity abiding within me. And I make that confession. Christ dwells in me. &gt;&gt; Even though everything around me is declaring something different &gt;&gt; and Satan is right there to say, "You're a scoundrel. You're a rat. &gt;&gt; You're a lower. You think you're in the pride you think that you are." And then he just heaps on condemnation. And you start bending and agreeing with that. You're in for a deep hole. &gt;&gt; You're in for a deep dark place. But even if you say that may be true, but I won't agree with you, sir. &gt;&gt; When Satan came to Jesus, he said, "If thou be the son of God," notice he was attacking his sunship. He was attacking his position. He was not saying there is no son of God. He was saying, "If you think you're him, &gt;&gt; that's the way he always comes. If you think you're that son or daughter of God, &gt;&gt; good, &gt;&gt; then do this." And even though he quoted the scripture to Jesus, he didn't even change a word in one place. He quoted it exactly correct. &gt;&gt; Jesus refused to agree with him because the source was wrong. &gt;&gt; So when you fail and you know you fail, you don't need some demon from hell to tell you you failed. &gt;&gt; You don't need Satan as your as as your accomplice or your company to come and tell you that you did wrong. You don't need him. You say, "Satan, get behind me. &gt;&gt; I have one who will speak to me. I have one who will convict me. And I have one who paid the price already." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And you know what you do? &gt;&gt; Listen to me close. Now I'm closing. Instead of continuing to write the old book, You let him who took that book &gt;&gt; erase it out &gt;&gt; by dealing with it. &gt;&gt; I would like this service to be a service of mass erasing &gt;&gt; of your failings and of your wrong and whatever more &gt;&gt; and your confession. &gt;&gt; He bought it. He didn't never let it go. He paid the full price. And I'm going to confess it today. And I'm going to acknowledge him taking it. I'm going to acknowledge his ownership. &gt;&gt; I'm going to acknowledge that he has arrested. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has arrested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He so completely erases it. &gt;&gt; When you think of the things, and I'm just tying it together now as I close. When you think of the When you think of the things that Tamar committed, Right? &gt;&gt; When you think of the things, but God wrote Tamar's iniquity in the word of God &gt;&gt; because he actually took them wrong &gt;&gt; and brought it back in &gt;&gt; to the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; For she brought forth a seed that would bring forth the lion of the tribe of Judah. What did she contribute? &gt;&gt; She contributed to friends. This is deep. &gt;&gt; She contributed to humanity in her act &gt;&gt; which would be considered gross &gt;&gt; sleeping with her father-in-law. &gt;&gt; And bringing forth a child, but she was driven, &gt;&gt; not for sexual act. &gt;&gt; She was driven to fulfill the call of God. &gt;&gt; You say, "How would God do that? How could God get any glory?" All I know is that one came from that lineage called the lamb of the tribe of Judah. And that's who John saw in Revelation 5 standing there. And you cannot separate that from counter's act. &gt;&gt; What is it friend? &gt;&gt; The ink became bleach. &gt;&gt; The ink became bleach. &gt;&gt; Do you understand me? Yeah, &gt;&gt; she did wrong. &gt;&gt; But her wrong actually brought forth the line of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "What do we say to these things?" You know what I tell you? Say nothing. &gt;&gt; You can never figure it out. &gt;&gt; You can never figure it out. You can't even figure out your own life. Why try to figure out everybody else's life? You'll never figure out that because that's grace. Boundless grace. &gt;&gt; That's grace without measure. And if you had a God you could figure out, I don't want him. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I want a God you can't figure out, &gt;&gt; that I can't figure out. A God whose love is beyond me. A God who whose grace is beyond me. &gt;&gt; It's beyond us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't give me law. Give me grace. [Applause] And if a person doesn't want this kind of preaching, you'll live with your doubts. &gt;&gt; You'll live with the weight of your sin. &gt;&gt; You'll live with your condemnation. &gt;&gt; After service like this, don't come to me about your condemnation. This is the answer. &gt;&gt; This is the answer. When the lamb took the book, &gt;&gt; when he took the book, that book became the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why incidentally when you come to this page of the Bible, &gt;&gt; separating the Old Testament from the New. &gt;&gt; You'll find over here where Abraham told a lie, but you never find any record of that lie over here. You'll find on this side where David committed a gross sin. But you'll never find it on this side. It cannot come through the [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We came out from him. &gt;&gt; And we go back to him. &gt;&gt; And he has received us, friends. &gt;&gt; Don't think this is just a church. Don't think this is just a service. Don't think we're just another church of people. That's not it. &gt;&gt; We sit in a church like other people do. But this message is not like any other message. &gt;&gt; This wasn't hacked up in a Bible school. &gt;&gt; Hatched up by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a bright room. &gt;&gt; Not pointing to the failures, the weaknesses of his pride. He's not propagating that. He's not advertising that. He's advertising &gt;&gt; as he did &gt;&gt; with Ruth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; can you give me a moment? &gt;&gt; Reconciled, redeemed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Boaz advertised &gt;&gt; that he was buying Ruth the Moabitis &gt;&gt; woman. Ruth's union to Boaz, which is our union to Christ, concludes the sad story. Oh, I have so much. &gt;&gt; Let me just back up a wee bit, please. &gt;&gt; Let me just back up a wee bit. Scripture tells us that God came and he took Eve out from Adam. And when she came out from Adam, she began to experience humanity and she began to write the book of humanity. And she committed a gross sin first by disbelieving the word of God and then by receiving the seed of the serpent. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says she did. Yes. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham, I wouldn't know this and you wouldn't know it except the prophet says that in one place, Adam then who was portraying Christ, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Went in and took her quickly to himself. &gt;&gt; He didn't hug her. &gt;&gt; He didn't merely kiss her. He gave her his seed &gt;&gt; because he knew that God could not destroy her with his seed. &gt;&gt; So he took her quickly to himself &gt;&gt; and in the fall he redeemed her from the fall because he too was falling. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So while he was in the process of falling, &gt;&gt; he takes hold of her to claim her back to himself. &gt;&gt; Christ had to come down. &gt;&gt; And in his coming down, &gt;&gt; becoming sin &gt;&gt; for you, &gt;&gt; he claimed you in that descension &gt;&gt; and took you quickly to himself. and put his seed, his word in you. &gt;&gt; He knew that God cannot destroy or bring you to judgment &gt;&gt; with his seed in you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same carries on the same pattern, the same story carries on &gt;&gt; when we come to Ruth and Boaz. Are you too tired? Can take another five minutes. &gt;&gt; When we come to Ruth and Boaz and the prophet now in the end time, we we can say brother Benham said, listen, just remember it was Jesus Christ revealing himself. &gt;&gt; So it was Jesus Christ causing him to go back to Ruth's story. &gt;&gt; What is Ruth's story? What is her human part? &gt;&gt; What is her human part? &gt;&gt; Her human part is I'm a widow. &gt;&gt; Her human part is my husband has died &gt;&gt; and I am left childless. &gt;&gt; Her human part and she's writing it but is written in the word of God. That was the that was the order of her life. &gt;&gt; Her human part is I'm povertystricken. Amen. &gt;&gt; Her human bodies were scarcely being kept alive. &gt;&gt; We're going through this world. &gt;&gt; My mother-in-law just said, "Don't call me Naomi anymore. Call me Mara. My life is so bitter." &gt;&gt; That was her human part. That's what was being written in the book of life, the record of her life. &gt;&gt; Until &gt;&gt; Boaz &gt;&gt; interjects her pathway. And this is what you find. This is what he said to her. &gt;&gt; Very brief. Boaz in his redemption. He says to her, his first word, hearest. And that word is obey. Do what I say. Hearest thou not my daughter. Go not. This is when he came to you. He told you right away. Go not into another field. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go hunting in another place. Stay here in my field and you'll find every answer. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying this church, but in this field, in this message, in this field, you'll find every answer. &gt;&gt; Neither go from hence. Do not go from hence. Some of you here have tried another place. You've tried the field of the world. You've tried the field of just uh you know a life that's non-committed. You've tried the field of you tried a sin. You tried pleasures. You try something else. Don't go into that &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It'll be different after this service. &gt;&gt; I call God to witness. &gt;&gt; Don't go into another field &gt;&gt; and don't go from hemps. &gt;&gt; Right? And then he said, "But abide here fast &gt;&gt; by my maidens." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "Let your eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them, but I I have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee." &gt;&gt; When thou art to thirst, go to the vessels and drink of what the young men have drawn. It hath fully been showed me. This is Boaz speaking. This is Christ speaking. It hath been fully showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband. And how thou hast left thy father and thy mother in the land of thy nativity, and are come unto a people which thou knowest not hereto for. And the Lord recompense. Now you see her book &gt;&gt; Amen. stop to be written. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You won't find in here anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm a poor widow. &gt;&gt; There isn't anything worth living for. You won't find it now because bull ass is writing the book. &gt;&gt; Pray with me. &gt;&gt; Bull ass took the pen in hand. Said since I interrupted your life, I'm going to write it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to write something different than you have been. I said this morning, don't write your don't write the story of your life. Let Boaz write it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "The Lord recompense all of your work. Thy work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings thou art come to trust." And Boaz said unto her, "At meal time, come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and drip thy and dip thy morsel into the vinegar." And you know that. &gt;&gt; That was it. That was it. And she goes back to her mother-in-law and says, "Look, she says, "Where you been? I've been in Boaz's field, the Old Testament, was mother-in-law, the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; We won't find it in the New Testament. That's why the prophet had to go back to the Old Testament &gt;&gt; when he's coming to opening the seals. He had to go back &gt;&gt; to go back to the book of Ruth which is the Old Testament which is Naomi Orthodox Church. He had to go there to interpret what was happening. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; And so he's telling us plainly he goes back there to tell us Boaz. And now Boaz takes it and begins to write a different story to her. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she goes to her mother-in-law in the Old Testament and that's where the picture is and says go and find the place where he lay. &gt;&gt; Now prophet come and says find the place where he lay. &gt;&gt; Find the place we laid at Calvary. Find the find the place. Find it. Not a few words. Find the place. &gt;&gt; You ever could see if you could see him this morning. If you could see him becoming savior, if you could just see him for a moment, you'll never forget that vision. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You can just hear him open his mouth. &gt;&gt; Forgive them. &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; You find the place. Ruth doesn't write anything from then on. She's done writing. &gt;&gt; The book of life is finished. Now it's become the redeemer's book. Become Boaz's book. And Boaz and she lays there and and and he he sees this woman there at midnight and he tells her what to do and everything else. And from then on then the women come in and Boaz comes and there's a secret. There's an invisible union &gt;&gt; of the bride and the bridegroom. And it takes another company. Now all the people, the maidens aren't there and the young men aren't there and all the reapers aren't there. Nobody's there. It's just her and him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And there's no more secrets. &gt;&gt; She becomes his wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she conceives &gt;&gt; and brings forth Oed. Hey friends. &gt;&gt; This was the plan of God. &gt;&gt; This was the master plan. &gt;&gt; And we wouldn't know. And here we are, hence many hundreds of years down the road. But how do you know if time should go go on? what's on down the road. And if you don't know, and if there is no more time and we're raptured this afternoon or tomorrow, then in eternity, we'll find out what our life meant and what God called us to do in this day and age. I can tell you it's a short work. &gt;&gt; That God is doing. And he called you for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He called us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if this next week, &gt;&gt; if this next week a soul is born again of the spirit of God and delivered, if one soul here, even a born again child of God, if they were set free this morning and delivered, I would say all the labor has been born. &gt;&gt; Friends, you don't want to write any more of your book. &gt;&gt; You want Boaz, you want the Kent believer to write his portion. Hallelujah. And you know what he will tell you? He will tell you that he's pregnantated you with his seed. &gt;&gt; Number one, he will tell you that you're bringing forth a royal lineage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't even know what you're bringing forth. He will tell you you're bringing forth Jesus Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Would we look down on that for a moment? &gt;&gt; Not for a moment. &gt;&gt; Could I possibly out of this humanity So glad I'm yours, Lord. &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours. &gt;&gt; I say to you, &gt;&gt; drop the pen. Drop the pencil. &gt;&gt; Just say it's over to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to write and give me eyesight &gt;&gt; so I can see &gt;&gt; and discern between &gt;&gt; deity &gt;&gt; and humanity. Right. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. between the book of life and the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Grace, grace, &gt;&gt; marvelous grace. All we can do today is rejoice. Lord, the people have been so encouraging. They have been so respectful. And father, it's not just that, but I feel somehow your word has penetrated, penetrated deep, maybe even deeper than some care to realize, but you have penetrated very deep. You're saying to some who have not when they walked in here did not feel like perhaps a son or a daughter. But you have said to them through your word today, you are my son. You're my daughter. You are my child. Oh God, I'm asking that there be an atmosphere that will take over now in this service. And may we join with the songwriter, mercy regrow my life &gt;&gt; for that is the truth, Lord. and myself in front of these people today. I want to thank you for the degree of mercy that you've extended to myself personally and to others that I have sat down with. Lord, you've extended mercy to this congregation. And in the midst of a very vile and violent and vulgar and evil time, you have brought us and washed us. Oh, I'm so glad we're not so glad we're not part of this world sin. Oh, God. Thank you for that. You've delivered us from it. &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, you'll do your &gt;&gt; do your work that we cannot do any longer. Take over now &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. I pray you'll take over. bring to a full repentance those that need to repent &gt;&gt; and let them know God by the preaching of the word today that if they will simply confess and yield and agree then you will do the rest you're waiting waiting to do this for them Lord I pray for those that may be struggling along the way and having a hard battle I ask oh God that they will see today that everything heaven is worth it all &gt;&gt; eternal eternal life is worth it all. And when this short life is through, you have promised us eternal life, eternal bliss, and eternal joy. In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit the words that have been spoken to you now. Thank you, Father. Continue now by the Holy Spirit. Continue. I pray [Music] like to have you stand and sing with me. Mercy reroll my life. Mercy re my mercy ruled my life. I should have fallen. My soul cast down mercy re my life [Music] mercy [Music] my broke your mind [Music] my [Music] I should have fallen. My soul cast [Music] my life. &gt;&gt; And that is why I love him. And that is why I love him. to him now because he works [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now. as he is. [Music] [Applause] Oh, what a sign for sinners. [Music] My Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; The last line of this chorus says, "What a sight for sinners." I had a whole series of scriptures and I was going to preach this morning. I saw him and as I studied God turned the whole subject around &gt;&gt; but I extended that and I'm closing with this. I want to leave you with this thought. You need desperately to see him in you that [Music] &gt;&gt; you need discernment to determine between the human part &gt;&gt; and that deity part. You must have that deserve that. But thirdly, very important, I read and I had a number of scriptures and the Bible says, "And when they saw him and when he saw them saw him, and when she saw him and I read those and those that received something from him, please let me give you a secret. those that got something from him are those and it it's the same every time. And when I saw him and when she saw him, she fell at his feet &gt;&gt; and she received it. And when he saw him, &gt;&gt; he fell at his feet &gt;&gt; and he received what he asked for. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees saw him and they said, "Who is this?" And they trying to figure him out, trying to reason him up. Don't do that. Don't try and figure the service out this morning. Don't try to figure out the message. Don't try to figure out the grace of God. My my admonishment to you today is see him. &gt;&gt; See him in yourself. Say him in your parents. Say him in your children. Whatever you do, see him in the ministry. Whatever you do, you'll give me the greatest honor today. If you say, "I love brother. I saw Christ." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what I think was that great happening down in Ohio at the meeting &gt;&gt; when a woman after the service I was just speaking on expressing Christ and she's in the back in another room talking to a woman in a wheelchair. The woman in the wheelchair says, "I see Christ in you." Says, "If you see Christ in me, stand up out of that wheelchair and walk." and a woman that hadn't taken a step for two years stood up and walked out of that room and all the way down to the front of the church and worshiped God for I don't know how long a time I wasn't even in the service and it it was after most of people had left. Tell you what, friends, the key to that was the key to that step was that she saw Christ in that moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I need something." Maybe what you need to do first is see Christ in yourself. Separate the humanity from the deity. Seek grace in the next person. See Christ in him in the street. Stop seeing the human part. The human part is failure. The human part will continue to fail. But the deity will never fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you see him, you'll never be the same. &gt;&gt; And that's why I love him. Let's lift it up to him again. And we're going to close now. And I love [Applause] to [Music] be Oh my [Music] [Applause] Christ is finished. [Music] [Applause] Oh for s [Music] my Jesus. Oh, what a sight for sinners. My Jesus brings [Music] [Applause] for sinners my Jesus. &gt;&gt; God willing. Amen. We'll see you all Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a supernatural time. &gt;&gt; I feel it in my heart. I know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; God's promise. Come expecting anything and everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you an expectation? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't think it'd be wrong to say, "Well, let's go and get raptured." What's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; And what are you expecting? Well, I'm expecting rapture. Let's go and get raptured. &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, come and dismiss us in prayer. Would you please &gt;&gt; Hallelujah? [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, what did we see this morning? &gt;&gt; We saw Christ. &gt;&gt; A songwriter once pinned. Beautiful Christ, king of my life is he. And so Lord, as Moses turned aside to see the burning bush. &gt;&gt; That was wonderful. But the glorious part, you saw Moses turn aside. And Father, we have gathered this morning, but you've seen us gathered. And I pray God that your glory would attend our way, Lord, as you did Moses that day. May Lord all we sense is the word, the presence of God. Go with us in a special way. We feel uncctioned this morning by the word of God. Lord, deal with our young people. Deal with our children. Deal with our families. Lord, let the glory of God settle down. We've turned aside to see none other than Jesus Christ, the living word. Go with your children. Bless your servant. strengthen the man of God this morning. Lord God, we're so thankful for the vessel. We pray that that word will continue to thunder forth changing lives by the word of God. Speak to the sinner this morning. May they turn aside and may they say Jesus Christ the living word. Bless your children. Go with us now. We love you. We thank you for your presence. We thank you for your dealings. Go with us now. We pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really feel like God just touching my heart while brother Thomas preaching or praying. There may be somebody here. I'm going to just open up this altar. Those of you that have to leave, you'll leave very quietly, respectfully, and don't speak in the foyer, please. It's nice outside. You go to the fellowship room. But if you somebody here says, you know, I want Boaz. I need Jesus Christ to come and rewrite my life. I need deity to take over. I need deity to dominate my life. I need to yield. I need to surrender. I need to give myself. It's one thing to hear the word. It's another thing to act on it. The Bible says he confirmed his word with signs following. I'd like to see the supernatural take place. I'd like to see sin's chains and bombs dropped to the earth. Like to see men and women, whoever, young people, children, whoever they might be. Going to ask you if you wish to come, we're going to sing Mercy Rewrote my life. And if you want and need and have that need in your life, don't delay another moment. Don't listen to the devil's lie. Tomorrow will not be easier. The camp will not necessarily be easier. Do it while God's voice is speaking. Then I'm going to have brother Dier come and pray a prayer over everyone that's standing and coming to expect from him. And we're going to sing the song once more. And it's good for you. say, "What good does it do for me to step forward or come an alter call is an old-fashioned old-fashioned denominational thing." Brother Brandham had them right up to the end as well. And I feel led to do that. There's nothing holy or sacred, but sometimes people need to move out of the seat, out of your comfort zone where you're sitting. And by acknowledging, I have a need in my life. And I believe that I want to confess and testify that God has spoken to my heart and to my soul. And I want the second thing to be a witness that I have. I'm coming now believing that God's going to meet my need. And I'd like to ask this congregation, how many would be praying with them and for them as well. Let's sing together. Mercy rewrote my life. And if you must go, you got an appointment or something, fine. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Or you may be seated after we sing, whatever you feel led to do. But whatever you do, just mind the Holy Spirit. Maybe you're just going to come and say, "I want to see him. I want to see him in a way. I need to see him. I need him to move and work in my life just now. [Music] Mercy. Mercy re my [Music] should my soul cast down my mercy re my [Music] mercy roll my life. my life. Oh mercy re my should my soul press down [Music] my life. Let's just move up a little closer if you can make room for some more that are coming. Oh mercy re my mercy re my [Music] should my soul [Applause] [Music] mercy Getting ready for prayer now. More are coming. And notice every word of this. All that I have, all that I am, all that I am. &gt;&gt; Prayer is a prayer. &gt;&gt; All that. [Music] [Applause] [Music] All I shall ever be. and the love I surrender to thee. [Music] All that I am. All [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I love that I [Music] surrender to And everyone raise their hand and sing it once again. I am surrender to him. [Applause] [Music] the love that I surrender to thee. &gt;&gt; All that remained in the sanctuary and throughout the building, enter into prayer now. you that are standing in your seats, you enter into prayer. Either pray for yourself or pray for someone standing here. Going to ask our brother Dia to come and pray. I'm asking that he will get into the channel of the Holy Spirit on behalf of the people. You that are ministers and viewers to come down if you would please and just join in and pray with someone. We're going to have a time. We're going to have a time friends before the throne. Oh, and God is so pleased when we surrender to him. So pleased when we surrender to him. And lately you standing in the seat. Touch him. Touch him. Let him touch you. Let him touch you now. Let him come here. Don't hold him back. Don't abuse him. But just say, "Come, Lord Jesus. Touch my heart only the way that you can. No one else can touch me like you do. Just come and touch me, Lord. Oh, touch us from the iniquities. [Music] &gt;&gt; Precious Father, &gt;&gt; we are so grateful to you this morning, Lord, for your inviting presence that is in this place. &gt;&gt; For you have stopped us, oh God, in this hour. Father, how we heard of Jacob wrestling with you and desires not to let you go until you had blessed him until he had seen you face to face. But this morning we feel as though you're the one, Father. We reach down your hand and say, "I will not let you go." You held us beyond the dismiss of prayer for your intent, oh God, and I see your face today. Father, we believe that is your doing. Oh God, we recognize the moment we seize the opportunity. We declared that and we'll leave. Oh God, we have a blessing flowing through our lives. For it is you doing this, oh God, is now the work of men and the great Holy Spirit himself intent to deliver our lives, intent to let himself come into a very precious Lord that we can experience the supernatural and against you. Oh God, break the chains of sin. Break, oh God, every darkness. Remove every molecule of sin.

Bring your liberation, Father. Bring an emancipation. Break, oh God, the chains of darkness that the Holy Ghost give freedom and liberty, oh God, a chance can fall and you better rise as a mighty men of war and break the walls of darkness and wreck the enemy's power that oh God, we can see you moving in a mighty way as we go into this family camp and it might not be a natural family and a heavenly family where the angel of God will descend among and done himself alive and do the exceedingly abundantly. He all can think or even ask today by the help your preeminence delivery [Applause] spirit a genuine baptism of fire that can burn all the trust that can change us oh God into your very image and likeness. Father, we believe that is your desire. That's why you have kept us here. Oh God almighty, we do not want to miss this opportunity. But we have faith in our hearts to believe that you're here to do the supernatural to confirm your word, oh God, that you desire to erase a former book and write a new book of God in every life that is here. Lord, every need, every burden, every prayer, every longing, every desire, oh God, can only be met by you. The lamb of God, the allsufficient one. We commit ourselves unto you. Oh, every soul in that divine presence this day. We ask that you'll just confirm your word with the signs. Oh God, I need healing. Oh God, even if healing, the most important part, Lord, may impart that to them. This gift of life eternal and it be red letter day and it'll never be the same. It will be a new beginning of God, your pastor and father from the foot of God into the last section.
