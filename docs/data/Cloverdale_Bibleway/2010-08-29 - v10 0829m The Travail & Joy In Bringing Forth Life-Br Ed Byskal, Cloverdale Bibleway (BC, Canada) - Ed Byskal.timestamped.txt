[6:33] Hallelujah.
[6:36] Shining through us, Lord. We want to see
[6:39] you in our lives, Father.
[6:42] That when others look upon us, they
[6:45] don't see us, Lord, but they see you
[6:48] living in flesh once again. The word on
[6:51] display, oh God.
[6:54] Not our spirit in control, but your
[6:56] spirit, oh God,
[6:59] is living through us. Take control of
[7:02] these dwelling places this morning. Not
[7:05] this building, Father, but these
[7:07] dwelling places of clay are where we
[7:10] desire to see you take your abode this
[7:13] morning.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:17] Hallelujah.
[7:19] You love the Lord this morning. Amen. We
[7:23] want to greet each and everyone the
[7:25] lovely name of our Lord Jesus. Does he
[7:26] mean more to you today?
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that he does. Amen. We're
[7:32] just going to go to prayer just now. I
[7:34] have brother Ernie come and lead the
[7:37] congregation in prayer this morning. We
[7:40] have a couple of uh requests. We have a
[7:42] testimony from brother John Lei. We'd
[7:44] like to praise the Lord for healing me
[7:47] for two serious medical problems. I was
[7:50] taking two blood pressure medications
[7:52] per day and now am taking none. Praise
[7:55] God.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:59] God bless you, brother John.
[8:02] Amen. God is mindful of every need.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; And he also writes also for the
[8:08] ministering of the word that's bringing
[8:10] the pure word in its due season. Amen.
[8:14] And through the word comes the healing.
[8:17] Amen.
[8:18] Brother Hughes message wants us to pray
[8:20] for Marcia Mosson. She's the wife of a
[8:23] Canadian veteran and she is actually on
[8:25] her way to Sweden for final treatments
[8:27] for cancer asking that the Lord would
[8:30] intervene on her behalf
[8:32] and we've uh many of us have seen a
[8:35] request that's come from Honduras.
[8:37] There's a situation with a little boy
[8:39] there that's been reported to have been
[8:42] kidnapped. He was first believed to be
[8:45] six years old. Now the report is that
[8:47] he's three and a large sum of US money
[8:49] is being requested for his return. But
[8:52] we know a God.
[8:54] Amen. When the prayer of the saints goes
[8:56] up, it doesn't matter if prison bars or
[9:00] what's the circumstance around you. It
[9:02] doesn't matter if it's prisoners that
[9:04] feel like they have a real good reason
[9:05] to keep you. All of a sudden, hearts
[9:08] change, prison walls break down, bars
[9:10] are opened, and the captive
[9:13] &gt;&gt; go free. Amen.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ernie, why don't you come
[9:16] and lead us in prayer this morning? If
[9:19] you have a need upon your heart, just
[9:21] desire to worship the Lord this morning,
[9:23] maybe you don't have a need and you just
[9:24] want to worship our God in spirit and in
[9:27] truth, let's take this opportunity. Call
[9:30] upon his name, Brother Ernie.
[9:32] Let's pray.
[9:34] [Music]
[9:37] Father, we come before you today as as
[9:41] children who have been invited to come
[9:44] to the throne room of grace. We come
[9:47] with humility and sincerity, Lord. But
[9:49] you've also said we can come boldly
[9:52] knowing that you are the high priest of
[9:53] our confession, sitting at the right
[9:56] hand of majesty, waiting to make good
[9:58] every one of the redemptive blessings of
[10:00] the resurrection. And Lord, we have
[10:02] heard testimonies today. We're so
[10:04] thankful for what you have done for our
[10:06] brother John Lelay, Lord, delivering him
[10:09] from the medication, Lord, and for these
[10:11] these two serious uh medical issues,
[10:14] Father. We know that you are Jehovah
[10:17] Rafa, you're Jehovah Gya. And Lord, we
[10:20] just thank you, Lord, for for
[10:22] introducing us to this great
[10:24] supernatural civilization, Lord, for for
[10:27] knowing with with a a clarity and and an
[10:30] assurity, Lord, with an absolute that we
[10:33] are children of the most high God, that
[10:35] we were in your mind. We were in your
[10:37] thoughts before the foundation of the
[10:39] world. And you have a plan for us, Lord,
[10:41] all down through eternity. Lord, we pray
[10:44] for us this uh woman Marcia that brother
[10:48] Hugh has brought to the throne of grace,
[10:50] Lord. Lord, even now as she begins her
[10:53] travels, I pray that you would deal with
[10:56] her soul first of all, Father. And then,
[10:58] Lord, we ask that you would move upon
[11:01] the doctors that'll be treating her,
[11:03] Lord. Father, by the time she gets
[11:05] there, Lord, let let her condition be
[11:09] not as serious as as perhaps they
[11:11] thought it was. And guide their guide
[11:13] their treatment, Lord. But Lord, you can
[11:16] take and you can by the time she gets
[11:17] there, you can make her every widow
[11:19] hole, Father. And Lord, we want to come
[11:23] before you, Lord. There has been much
[11:25] communication back and forth. And we
[11:27] know that saints all over the world have
[11:29] taken this little three-year-old boy
[11:32] who's been kidnapped and is being held
[11:34] ransom. He's a son of a of a message
[11:37] pastor.
[11:39] Lord, I can't even imagine what the
[11:41] family is going through. But Lord, I
[11:43] know that they have faith. I know that
[11:46] they believe that you are the God that
[11:48] can move upon these ones who have done
[11:51] this evil deed, Lord. And you can take
[11:53] their hearts, Lord. As dark and as black
[11:56] as their hearts may be, you can take
[11:58] them, Lord, and you can turn them
[12:00] around. You can let them set this child
[12:03] free. It can be a testimony of your
[12:06] power, a testimony of your faithfulness.
[12:08] Father, we believe that it's going to
[12:11] take place. Father, take this little
[12:13] child, Lord. Envelop him, Lord, even
[12:16] where he is right now. Be with the
[12:18] family, Lord. Be with the congregation.
[12:21] Be with the church. And Lord, now as we
[12:23] turn to the word, Father, we're in deep
[12:26] expectation, great anticipation, Lord,
[12:29] of what you're going to speak to us, we
[12:31] pray that you would take our pastor,
[12:33] Lord, who has labored, Lord, and has
[12:35] waited upon you, Lord. I'm I I'm excited
[12:38] about what's going to take place in this
[12:40] building today. I believe that we're
[12:43] going to we're going to have a
[12:44] supernatural experience. I believe that
[12:47] there's going to be a spiritual
[12:48] transaction take place in this building.
[12:51] I believe the word of God is going to
[12:54] come into the hearts of children. And I
[12:56] believe they're going to be changed.
[12:58] They're going to be transformed. They're
[13:00] going to be renewed and re renovated,
[13:02] Lord, and transformed. Father, Lord, I
[13:05] pray that you would take Brother Ed,
[13:07] lift him up into those realms of glory,
[13:09] oh God. Let him speak what you have had
[13:12] upon his heart. Give him a freedom and a
[13:14] liberty to enter right into that
[13:16] supernatural channel. We ask. And Lord,
[13:19] let us pull upon the word. And we ask
[13:21] all these blessings, Father, knowing
[13:24] that you have heard them, knowing that
[13:26] you answer every prayer. We ask it all
[13:29] in your precious name of our Lord Jesus
[13:31] Christ. Amen.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you each and everyone this
[13:38] morning. You may have your seats.
[13:41] Amen. Thank you for praying. Brother
[13:43] Ernie,
[13:45] the Lord Jesus was touched by the
[13:48] feeling of our infirmities.
[13:50] I maybe hadn't been quite touched the
[13:53] way I did just now when brother Ernie
[13:55] was praying. I have a three-year-old
[13:57] son. And I can't imagine on God's earth
[14:01] what I would do other than just throw up
[14:04] my hands before merciful God
[14:07] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, bring back my son."
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:14] Brother Diversson
[14:16] and Brother Nathan have a special this
[14:19] morning. Maybe they can come and get
[14:20] ready.
[14:24] And brother Diversson's going to be
[14:25] leaving for London, Ontario next Tuesday
[14:27] for school. And he's just wrote in a
[14:31] announcement that he is leaving. He'd
[14:33] like to thank our Lord Jesus Christ for
[14:35] the love and the fellowship that I have
[14:37] experienced while I have been here among
[14:39] you at Cloverdale Bible Way. God be with
[14:42] you. Till we meet again. God bless you.
[14:47] Where's our brother Philip Gersonson and
[14:49] Katie Miller? Sister Katie, God bless
[14:52] you, brother Phillip. There you are.
[14:56] We'd like to thank the Lord for his love
[14:58] and guidance and we are extremely to hap
[15:00] to announce the happy engagement of
[15:03] these two, Philillip and Katie Miller.
[15:06] God bless you.
[15:16] Praise the Lord. And there's a picture.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[15:38] [Music]
[15:54] There's no treasure on earth that can
[15:57] move heaven's heart to purchase my
[16:01] pardon for me.
[16:05] No jewels or gems that I bring could
[16:09] start to pay my penalty.
[16:16] Even silver or gold are offerings to
[16:20] poor to take away guilt. But the truth
[16:24] is, my Lord, that it's only by the blood
[16:33] you poured out for me.
[16:38] It's only by the blood I can stand
[16:43] redeem.
[16:46] All the riches of this world could never
[16:50] be enough to take away one sin.
[16:56] So only by the blood.
[17:02] To the temple they came and the orders
[17:06] run
[17:08] year after year after year.
[17:13] Yet for all of their loss and all I've
[17:17] shared still long true was need
[17:24] to hear you came to us.
[17:27] So one perfect lamb with those on your
[17:30] head, nails in your heart. I listen
[17:36] by the blood.
[17:40] You p up for me.
[17:45] It's only by your blood I can stand
[17:50] redeemed.
[17:53] All the riches of this world could never
[17:57] be enough
[17:58] to take away one sin. It's only by the
[18:04] blood.
[18:09] You've done what nothing an could do.
[18:14] And the song of my soul is Lord, worthy
[18:18] are you.
[18:21] Cuz it's only by the blood.
[18:28] You poured
[18:34] me by the blood. I can stand redeem.
[18:40] All the riches of this world could never
[18:44] be enough to take away sin. Son by the
[18:51] blood.
[18:55] Son by the blood.
[19:00] It's only by the blood.
[19:10] [Applause]
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for that song this
[19:20] morning. Maybe we can just sing the
[19:21] little chorus. I claim the blood
[19:24] Jesus shed on Calvary as we get ready to
[19:26] change the order of the service.
[19:28] [Music]
[19:30] I claim the blood
[19:34] [Music]
[19:35] Jesus shed on Calary.

[19:53] [Music]
[19:55] for all my sins.
[19:59] My sickness
[20:02] and my pain.
[20:06] When I need
[20:11] I claim those precious blessings
[20:18] I cla
[20:21] [Music]
[20:25] through that blood
[20:27] [Music]
[20:30] preious blood
[20:34] were made there does for me
[20:40] for all my sin,
[20:45] my sickness,
[20:47] and my pain.
[20:51] When I need healing,
[20:56] I pray those precious blessings.
[21:03] Just as our pastor comes, Lord, I lift
[21:05] your name. We invite brother Ed to come
[21:08] to the pulpit this morning. Deliver the
[21:11] word that the world may the word may
[21:13] heal the people.
[21:16] Friends, we may not need a healing in
[21:18] our body today, but we need a
[21:21] resurrection.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; And that quickening power needs to lie
[21:24] within you
[21:26] &gt;&gt; because if you don't make it to the
[21:27] rapture and you get buried in the
[21:29] ground, there has to be something. There
[21:31] has to be a life in you that quickens
[21:33] what's lying in the ground. We need to
[21:36] make our deposit today.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me for the rapture if I'm
[21:40] going to be here for the rapture. But if
[21:42] I'm not going to be Lord, I want to rise
[21:45] &gt;&gt; that morning when the trump of the Lord
[21:48] shall sound. Let's sing this together
[21:50] maybe as we stand on our feet. Welcome
[21:52] the word to come and minister to us this
[21:54] morning.
[21:56] Lord, I lift

[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like every phrase.
[24:21] What an opportunity we have this
[24:23] morning. I lift your name.
[24:26] your holy name,
[24:28] &gt;&gt; my comforter,
[24:30] &gt;&gt; and my king. Can you
[24:33] &gt;&gt; agree with all of those words? Amen.
[24:35] Let's just sing it once more.
[24:38] Lord, I lift
[24:41] your name,
[24:44] your holy
[24:48] name.
[24:50] [Music]
[24:52] Heat. Heat.
[24:54] [Music]
[25:02] [Applause]
[25:04] I am
[25:12] my God
[25:17] and
[25:22] if he's not our king, who is our king?
[25:26] Amen.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want a king of this earth. We
[25:30] want the eternal one. Amen.
[25:33] Well, uh I'm going to ask for your
[25:36] undivided attention this morning.
[25:39] And all you young people that have uh
[25:43] hopefully life still ahead of you some
[25:46] years, I want you to especially
[25:49] participate in the service. Listen very
[25:52] very close.
[25:54] And uh I it's going to take perhaps a
[25:57] wee bit a different order this morning,
[25:59] but uh we're going to get to it right
[26:02] away. I just wanted to make mention
[26:04] about the
[26:07] uh young person, a child that's been uh
[26:10] kidnapped and uh there's been
[26:13] considerable communication that has gone
[26:16] around.
[26:17] There's one thing that I would like to
[26:19] urge the uh those that are here. When
[26:22] you're transmitting information back and
[26:25] forth, I would really play down the
[26:27] ransom bit.
[26:30] Don't say much on ransom. That's exactly
[26:32] what the kidnappers want. They want us
[26:35] to be consumed with the ransom part
[26:37] because
[26:39] they they know that the person
[26:43] uh the parents of the child they don't
[26:46] have any money.
[26:48] So they just want to use that as a
[26:50] channel to get through. I've been
[26:53] engaged in it before so I know what I'm
[26:55] talking about. and they just know well
[26:58] they got friends or they got church or
[27:00] they got all bunch of churches in
[27:01] America and they're going to loosen up
[27:04] and take up offerings and give and that
[27:07] only spawns another one.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; And that is why you have nations when
[27:12] there has been kidnappings the nations
[27:14] just declare we're not giving any ransom
[27:16] whatsoever. They say we're going to kill
[27:18] the people. Well, it doesn't matter.
[27:20] we're not giving any ransom because what
[27:22] do they get if they do injury to a child
[27:24] or kill a child or whatever more and
[27:27] they really just call their hand is what
[27:29] they do and we have the case with
[27:32] brother
[27:33] uh because of a printing work in India
[27:35] and they took and hauled up brother
[27:38] Daniel Evans into a tribunal court
[27:42] and sentenced him to three three and a
[27:45] half years of hard labor, excuse me, or
[27:49] $30,000
[27:52] fine.
[27:54] But they said, "We won't take your
[27:55] passport away." Well, you can't be any
[27:58] more blatant than that.
[28:00] They left him with his passport so he
[28:02] could travel to over here and and we did
[28:05] assist him. We assisted him with $17,000
[28:09] to negotiate. But he even went to Delhi
[28:12] and was right before the prime minister
[28:14] of India and they appealed he appealed
[28:18] to them and they said well if we'd have
[28:20] seen it sooner but this was a a a
[28:22] tribunal of three judges and they'd
[28:24] stamped it that it was nonappealable
[28:27] and we did what we could but then we
[28:29] left it. We couldn't do anymore and they
[28:32] resolved it. He didn't go to prison. He
[28:34] didn't spend three and a half years in
[28:36] hard sometime you have to call their
[28:38] hand
[28:39] &gt;&gt; say look at this is what we can do in
[28:41] that case we came forward because we
[28:43] were largely responsible we had we had
[28:46] the printing operation that he was
[28:47] caring for that he was uh uh penalized
[28:51] over because they had passed some laws
[28:54] that a person could not receive funds
[28:56] from uh outside of India
[29:00] that were that were uh from foreign
[29:03] countries or foreign organizations
[29:06] uh unless they had a a certain status
[29:09] within India, they had just passed this
[29:11] law and he didn't know anything about
[29:12] it. And so he that's how that all
[29:15] happened. But uh and so it wasn't a
[29:18] kidnapping as such, but he was
[29:20] essentially put under sentence by the
[29:22] federal government of India and and God
[29:25] intervened. And so I would say on behalf
[29:27] what we should do is major and brother
[29:30] Ernie you seem to be kind of a a central
[29:34] point where a lot of this communication
[29:36] is passing. I would say that if we
[29:38] transmit them we should say that we are
[29:41] we have committed him into the hands and
[29:43] he is under the eyes of the Lord Jesus
[29:45] Christ. And I would bring those men
[29:48] because I can guarantee they're reading
[29:49] what's going on. And I'd put those men
[29:52] under the sentence of Almighty God that
[29:55] God is watching over this child and
[29:57] though those who have him should be very
[29:59] very cautious that they treat him well
[30:02] because Almighty God who we serve has
[30:06] got control of this situation. Amen. And
[30:08] I would bear that out rather than the uh
[30:12] ransom part. And and others of course
[30:15] are we don't have any control of what
[30:17] others do.
[30:20] Brother Thomas back from Serbia.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Uh
[30:25] he's wilted a wee bit, but after you
[30:28] have you're in 10 meetings and preach
[30:30] five and a half of them. How do you
[30:32] preach five and a half services? He told
[30:34] me I took five and a half services.
[30:37] Anyhow,
[30:42] and brother Milo went on from Serbia and
[30:44] he's in Israel right now with the saints
[30:46] in Israel. Isn't that wonderful? And I'm
[30:49] so glad we got a printing a printing
[30:50] station there and they're receiving
[30:52] messages printing all the messages for
[30:54] themselves in Israel. Praise the Lord.
[30:57] When has that happened before? Is it
[30:59] nice to be ahead of the devil?
[31:03] Hallelujah.
[31:05] So we want to pray for him and re
[31:07] remember the believers there. Brother
[31:10] Murphy is leaving a week tomorrow for
[31:13] China. an extended time in China
[31:15] probably
[31:17] I don't know how long. So I I just said
[31:21] don't get handcuffed
[31:23] like the last time. So we're praying
[31:25] Sister Tracy and uh praying for Murphy.
[31:28] He will be speaking this coming
[31:30] Wednesday and you won't want to miss it.
[31:32] I can tell you I've been very very
[31:34] greatly blessed by uh brother Murphy's
[31:36] ministry and several have talked to me
[31:39] in just the last few weeks about his
[31:42] ministry and uh uh uh fact is a brother
[31:47] talked to me yesterday about about
[31:49] brother Murphy coming to Ohio wanting to
[31:52] have him come there. So uh we want to be
[31:56] uh uh remembering that service also. Uh,
[32:03] amen.
[32:05] I can have you turn in your Bibles if
[32:07] you would.
[32:09] Brother Tom, you should just give a
[32:11] greeting, I think, from the people in
[32:12] Serbia. I know that they sent greetings
[32:14] with you before we read the scripture.
[32:19] Greetings from Serbia.
[32:22] I'm sure there'll be streaming this
[32:23] morning. They they said, "Brother Tom,
[32:25] are you going to give a report in Serbia
[32:26] on Sunday morning?" I said, "Well,
[32:28] Brother Biscll serve as a very kind man,
[32:32] and I'm anticipating Brother Biscll
[32:33] taking the Sunday morning service." So,
[32:36] they did. Uh, Brother Yonko Thomas and
[32:38] his wife Anna have sent their love and
[32:40] greetings. Brother Dragonir, Brother
[32:42] Elodan that was here last summer.
[32:43] They've brought their they asked me to
[32:45] convey their love and greetings. And of
[32:48] course, I guess you've heard maybe some
[32:49] of you through the grapevine. I was over
[32:52] there to meet brother Miracle's son. And
[32:55] at the end of the meetings, brother um
[32:58] Daniel was baptized in the name of the
[33:00] Lord Jesus Christ and his wife also. So
[33:03] we had a wonderful time. We had s six
[33:05] baptisms and God moved in a special way.
[33:08] God bless you. We'll give it probably a
[33:09] further report next weekend. God bless
[33:11] you.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; God bless a preacher that can be short-
[33:16] winded.
[33:23] I'm going to have you turn to John the
[33:25] 16th chapter
[33:29] and we'll read
[33:33] from the uh 16th verse down to the 23rd
[33:37] verse.
[33:44] Thank you for your prayers. Uh, I just
[33:48] seem to rely more upon them all the
[33:50] time.
[33:53] Verse 16,
[33:56] a little while and you shall not see me,
[34:01] and again a little while and you shall
[34:03] see me because I go to the Father. Then
[34:06] said some of his disciples among
[34:08] themselves, What is this that he saith
[34:11] unto us, A little while and you shall
[34:14] not see me? and again a little while and
[34:16] you shall see me uh and because I go to
[34:20] the father.
[34:22] They said therefore, what is this that
[34:24] he sth a little while? We cannot tell
[34:27] what he said. Now Jesus knew that they
[34:30] were desirous to ask him and said unto
[34:32] them, do you inquire among yourselves of
[34:35] that I said a little while and you shall
[34:37] not see me and again a little while and
[34:39] you shall see me. Verily, verily, I say
[34:42] unto you, that you shall weep and
[34:44] lament, but the world shall rejoice, and
[34:47] you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow
[34:50] shall be turned into joy. A woman, when
[34:53] she is in travail, hath sorrow, because
[34:56] her hour is come, but as soon as she is
[35:00] delivered of the child, she rememberth
[35:03] no more the anguish for joy that a man
[35:07] is born into the world. And you now
[35:11] therefore have sorrow. See, they didn't
[35:14] understand why they were having sorrow.
[35:15] But now you have sorrow, but I will see
[35:18] you again, and your heart shall rejoice,
[35:21] and your joy no man taketh from you. And
[35:24] in that day you shall ask me nothing.
[35:27] Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[35:29] whatsoever you shall ask the Father in
[35:32] my name, he will give it you.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Let's ask the Lord's blessing. Heavenly
[35:37] Father,
[35:39] we have been pondering. We have been
[35:42] looking to you. We have been in prayer.
[35:45] We have been in study. The people have
[35:48] been hearing the words of your
[35:50] messenger. Uh they have been becoming
[35:53] attuned and in expectation.
[35:55] It's wonderful to look down into their
[35:57] faces and see the peace and the joy of
[36:00] the Holy Spirit. And now, Holy Ghost, we
[36:04] say, take control of every mind and
[36:08] bring it into subjection to the will of
[36:11] Almighty God. And may the words that are
[36:14] to be uttered now, Father, be words that
[36:16] are anointed by the Holy Spirit. And may
[36:19] they come to hearts that are anointed of
[36:22] the Holy Spirit. We commit this service
[36:24] and this day to you that the name of
[36:27] Jesus Christ might be glorified.
[36:31] Amen. And the people said, "Amen."
[36:34] Hallelujah. God bless you. You may be
[36:36] seated.
[36:49] Do you want a little insight just into
[36:51] how sometimes God deals with a a a
[36:55] minister? All right.
[36:58] I will read for you some of my
[37:00] scribblings.
[37:03] This message is called scribblings.
[37:06] No, in a few moments I will get to it.
[37:10] But the essence and the substance of
[37:13] these notes are you'll find in the in
[37:15] the message as we move through it.
[37:18] Eve brought forth two seeds.
[37:23] Cain then Abel.
[37:28] Because of Eden, there was Ishmael and
[37:31] Isaac.
[37:33] Ishmael, like Cain, came first, then
[37:37] Isaac.
[37:39] Egypt came first, then Israel
[37:44] came next.
[37:46] Israel, however, brought forth a son.
[37:51] the travail of Israel, the travail in
[37:53] Egypt, the travail in the wilderness,
[37:57] the travail under Saul, King Saul, the
[38:01] travail under a divided Israel, the
[38:04] travail in Babylon, and the travail
[38:07] under Rome.
[38:11] But Israel brought forth a son.
[38:15] We don't ask for pains of travail. They
[38:19] just come.
[38:22] Satan sweeps in, but God brings on
[38:26] another birth pain. Satan swing swings
[38:30] in, sweeps in and brings a travail upon
[38:33] the people. But it's God that is
[38:36] bringing on the birth pain.
[38:39] We did not ask for war. We did not ask
[38:42] for a first world war. We did not ask
[38:44] for a second world war. We didn't even
[38:46] know what it was at the time except in a
[38:49] an incredible cost of human life until a
[38:53] prophet comes and says that was a birth
[38:55] pain.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And the second one was a harder birth
[38:59] pain. And the third one, he said, "We
[39:02] can't stand a third one. It'll birth
[39:05] us into a new world."
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Today prevail.
[39:13] And I speak of the word when the sun is
[39:16] developing,
[39:19] it arrives to its fullness in a certain
[39:22] season.
[39:23] You women that have born children. When
[39:26] a child comes to birth, you can't stop
[39:32] it.
[39:33] It has to happen.
[39:37] And collectively and through time, God
[39:42] has allowed
[39:44] the son of God to move from one
[39:50] office, one position to another to
[39:52] another, but it's moved through the
[39:54] people.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Collectively, and yet individually, we
[39:59] all participate.
[40:01] Yes.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; So as the son is delivered of the
[40:04] church, she's in travail.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; The pressures of the world.
[40:12] The question is what is causing the
[40:14] travail
[40:16] in sorrow. Thou shalt bring forth thy
[40:19] children. That is individually.
[40:22] The fulfillment and full development of
[40:25] the son the word within the people.
[40:30] the sun must come forth.
[40:34] Nothing can actually with withstand
[40:37] that. And so the intensity of desire
[40:41] within the believer to bring him forth
[40:45] to a place of greater glory.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And what do we do with such an
[40:51] invitation that we've been given at this
[40:54] time?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; That's the message according to
[40:57] Scribble.
[41:03] She rememberth the scripture says when
[41:07] she is in travail
[41:11] she hath sorrow. Now I've just have
[41:14] three slides only so you can follow me
[41:18] with this.
[41:20] A woman
[41:23] a woman. The church is a woman.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; A nation is a woman. that's never in a
[41:29] male gender,
[41:31] a woman.
[41:34] And Jesus is saying these words because
[41:38] he is at the very point of departing
[41:42] from the apostle, from the disciples,
[41:45] and they're filled with sorrow. And he
[41:47] says, "You have sorrow
[41:49] &gt;&gt; because I've said a little while you
[41:52] won't see me anymore, and then a little
[41:54] while you will see me." And they were
[41:56] they were what's he saying? What does he
[41:59] mean? What does this mean? A little
[42:00] while and you won't see me in a little
[42:03] while. We will because they could sense
[42:04] the atmosphere was that he was departing
[42:07] and the atmosphere was I'm going to be
[42:10] under uh judgment. I'm going to be
[42:12] suffering. And they were under the
[42:13] travail and and Rome and uh the iron
[42:17] fist of Rome. And they were looking to
[42:19] him. He's going to free us from this.
[42:23] But it wasn't happening. And so Jesus is
[42:26] telling them now. He's explaining what's
[42:28] happening.
[42:30] When she is in a travail,
[42:33] has sorrow. Why? Because her hour is
[42:39] come. The time has come. The child has
[42:42] to be birthed. Something else has to
[42:44] happen. And it can't it can't uh you you
[42:48] can't do anything about it. You can't
[42:49] withstand it. And so her hour is come.
[42:52] The child is formed. In other words, but
[42:55] as soon as she is delivered of the
[42:58] child, she remembers no more her anguish
[43:00] for the joy of a man is born into the
[43:04] world.
[43:11] When she is in travail,
[43:16] hath sorrow,
[43:18] &gt;&gt; because her hour is come.
[43:21] But as soon as she is delivered of the
[43:24] child,
[43:26] she rememberth no more of the anguish.
[43:28] Amen. of all the children that have been
[43:31] born of you that are mothers.
[43:35] I guarantee you after the child is born
[43:37] and you are embracing that newborn
[43:40] child,
[43:41] you are not
[43:43] looking down and saying, "Oh, the
[43:46] travail you caused, all the pain you
[43:48] caused, all the uh time I was sick,
[43:51] Sister Shelly,
[43:54] we prayed for Sister Shelly, and all
[43:56] this, you know, the morning sickness
[43:58] disappears and all of the stuff." Yeah,
[44:01] you remembered, but it's way back there
[44:03] someplace.
[44:05] You've got the child, you're embracing
[44:06] the child, you're taken up with it. But
[44:09] when the problem was because this is a
[44:12] spiritual thing, they couldn't recognize
[44:15] Christ.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Couldn't recognize the child that
[44:20] something had actually taken place.
[44:23] Now,
[44:27] for a joy that a man is born into the
[44:29] world,
[44:32] Brother Brandham says, and this is where
[44:35] you're going to really need your focus.
[44:39] Have you ever read in the message and
[44:40] you've seen where brother Brandham has
[44:43] kind of stumbled over words and says
[44:45] flusterations and he invents his own
[44:48] words, but you know, it's amazing. We
[44:50] know what he sang and
[44:52] And sometimes you'll get, you know, uh
[44:55] he'll say one thing and mean another and
[44:57] then he'll correct himself and so on. We
[44:59] we've all encountered that. Well,
[45:02] uh this is one quote where I thought
[45:04] that that's what was happening. But it's
[45:07] amazing.
[45:08] He actually was in the very root word.
[45:11] He was in historical
[45:14] uh forming of this word.
[45:17] The Bible said that the effectual
[45:19] fervent that's desperation notice he's
[45:22] desperation effectual fervent prayer of
[45:26] a righteous man avaleth much. When a
[45:29] righteous man, a good man gets in
[45:32] travail or soul travel
[45:35] or travail, either one. I think travel
[45:38] is a better word. When I read that, I
[45:42] thought I can't connect that. What's he
[45:45] meaning? Travel is a better word for
[45:47] travail.
[45:48] Anyway, that's what he said. And travail
[45:50] or travel, either one, which one you
[45:54] want to call it. Either which one you
[45:56] want to call it. But when a soul gets in
[45:59] desperation, in travailing an effectual
[46:03] fervent prayer of a man uh that can show
[46:06] the token, it does something. So I
[46:09] thought I really because I want to speak
[46:11] so much on travail, I want to really uh
[46:15] determine uh as much of the depth of it
[46:18] as I can for uh our benefit. And uh the
[46:23] travail travail simply is in our
[46:26] understanding painfully difficult. It's
[46:29] agony, anguish or the pain of
[46:32] childbirth. But the travail, believe it
[46:35] or not, comes from travel
[46:39] from an old French traveler to the
[46:43] reference of the hardships
[46:45] of journey. And that was key with me
[46:50] because I'm going to be dwelling on that
[46:52] as well. And that came from the old
[46:55] Latin triple air, an instrument of
[46:59] torture. It was actually a threepronged
[47:01] stick uh that uh that was used in in
[47:06] ancient times and and it had the name.
[47:09] So the French have picked it up from the
[47:11] Latin, an instrument of torture to
[47:14] describe the journeys and the travel and
[47:18] and you have to remember that travel
[47:21] back in these times there wasn't Motel
[47:24] 8s along the way or holiday ends or
[47:26] whatever more brother Frank you couldn't
[47:29] just pull in and you know and and go to
[47:31] the Hampton in and come down and have
[47:33] breakfast you know this is Le Oysia
[47:37] &gt;&gt; back then I mean you were grinding it
[47:39] out. There wasn't maybe even water in a
[47:42] lot of places. And let's let's not even
[47:44] try to describe it any further. But
[47:46] that's the way it is. And this is the
[47:48] this is the etmology which is the origin
[47:52] of a word or the part of a word and how
[47:55] it has arrived at its current form and
[47:59] the and meaning. uh an etmology often
[48:03] shows the different forms the word has
[48:06] taken in passing from one language to
[48:09] another and so that is how and now we
[48:11] have a prophet and he says well tra pre
[48:14] travail or travel whichever one I think
[48:16] tra is a better word well it's it's it's
[48:23] the journey and uh that's what I want to
[48:26] dwell on some in in the in the service
[48:29] this morning Now you just hold your
[48:33] time. I'm holding back because I plan to
[48:35] preach in a few minutes.
[48:40] Everyone
[48:42] everyone's life journey is filled with
[48:46] hardships
[48:47] &gt;&gt; along the way.
[48:50] The journey of Jesus Christ throughout
[48:52] the ages has always been associated with
[48:56] travail and hardship. whether it's
[48:59] collectively
[49:01] or individually. And that's why brother
[49:03] Brandon would
[49:05] sing and and sweep into uh uh you know,
[49:09] he was very poetic, but he would he
[49:11] would start with a it's dripping with
[49:14] blood.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's dripping with blood.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; This Holy Ghost gospel, it's dripping
[49:21] with blood.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; The blood of disciples who died for the
[49:25] truth. This Holy Ghost gospel is
[49:28] dripping with blood. In other words,
[49:31] that is a that's a key part of the
[49:34] gospel. It has come at great cost.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And this is a problem with me because we
[49:43] have things nice.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Uh we have automobiles outside. We're
[49:49] sitting in comfort. the air conditioning
[49:51] is doing its part and whoever cares for
[49:54] it and brother Joe Walner and we have
[49:56] everybody in their place and hopefully
[49:58] and we come in here and we're we're
[50:00] comfortable and we we're not accustomed
[50:02] to too much suffering and uh the ads and
[50:06] the newspapers and whatever more is is
[50:08] is filled with and uh the the whole uh
[50:13] medical field is is out there to make
[50:16] sure you don't suffer too much or we
[50:18] lessen the pain as much as possible. And
[50:20] so we're not accustomed. So I've felt
[50:22] you know uh where are we in this whole
[50:25] scene and of course in the coming forth
[50:28] of the gospel there were times and the
[50:31] Bible speaks of it. The Bible speaks of
[50:34] it. They said they said of Jesus also
[50:36] and he's the same yesterday, today and
[50:38] forever. They said he's a good man.
[50:41] And probably your friends many of them
[50:44] say these are good people. These are
[50:46] nice people. These are honest people.
[50:50] They're good neighbors. And so there's
[50:52] that part. But also they also had that
[50:56] idea of Jesus. He's a he's a good
[50:59] person. In fact is there's a scripture
[51:01] which I will give you in a little bit
[51:03] that that's a scripture that really fits
[51:06] brother Brandham to the to a right to
[51:09] the tea. And the Bible says there was
[51:11] great uh there was a great murmuring and
[51:14] dissension amongst the people because
[51:16] some said he's a good man and others
[51:19] said he's deceiving the people. And I
[51:22] can tell you that fits the message
[51:23] perfectly
[51:24] &gt;&gt; because amongst them they'll say you're
[51:26] good people but you're deceiving the
[51:28] people.
[51:34] And Jesus said, "Wherefore, behold, I
[51:37] send unto you prophets and wise men and
[51:41] scribes, and some of them you shall
[51:44] kill, not all, but some of them you
[51:46] shall kill and crucify, and some of them
[51:49] you shall scourge in your synagogues or
[51:52] your churches, and persecute them from
[51:55] city to city. Wherever they go, they'll
[51:57] be under persecution. Be why? Not
[52:00] because they didn't like the way the
[52:02] person looked. Because that's the way uh
[52:05] of of what they were representing.
[52:09] Paul said in Colossians, to whom God
[52:12] would make known what is the riches of
[52:14] the glory of this mystery among the
[52:16] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[52:18] hope of glory. That was the problem.
[52:20] Brother Brandham said, "It's not me they
[52:22] hate. It's the message.
[52:26] The message was the problem.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; When when Samuel was being rejected and
[52:34] he mourned over it and God spoke to him,
[52:37] he said, "It's not you, it's me they've
[52:39] rejected." Amen.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Philippians, "That I might
[52:44] know him and the power of his
[52:46] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[52:48] sufferings being made conformable unto
[52:51] his death, being made conformable unto
[52:54] his death."
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "For even here unto where
[53:00] you called," I like the attention of
[53:02] everybody because I'm saying it to you.
[53:05] I'm echoing Peter's words. for here unto
[53:08] where you called. You're here in the
[53:11] service this morning. You're here in
[53:12] this church. But I want to say to you,
[53:14] you're only here because God has called
[53:16] you. And this is why you're called.
[53:19] Because Christ also suffered.
[53:23] He suffered for us.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Leaving an example that you should
[53:28] follow in his steps.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't go out here and say,
[53:32] "Persecute me."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; No. But there is a pressure.
[53:37] There is travail
[53:39] &gt;&gt; that comes upon you in perhaps a
[53:41] different a more subtle way.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that travail is
[53:49] coming upon you. Excuse me for pointing
[53:51] my finger, but that travail is coming
[53:53] upon you because of what you have
[53:56] believed and because God Almighty by the
[53:59] Holy Ghost is guiding the life of his
[54:03] son through the church and through the
[54:06] bride to bring him to another glorious
[54:10] uh uh place or dispensation or era.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:17] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[54:20] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[54:23] that was set before him, endured the
[54:26] cross, despising the shame, and is sat
[54:29] down at the right hand of the throne of
[54:31] God. For consider him that endured such
[54:35] contradiction of sinners against
[54:37] himself, lest ye also be wearied and
[54:40] faint in your minds." But he said,
[54:43] Apostle Paul speaking to the Hebrews,
[54:45] you have not resisted unto blood,
[54:48] striving against sin. And that's
[54:50] probably where we all are.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; We've had hardships and we've had
[54:54] difficulties and we have felt resistance
[54:56] and we have felt cast off and we've
[54:59] perhaps have felt uh uh unwelcome
[55:03] amongst uh maybe unbelieving people, but
[55:06] we've not resisted unto blood
[55:09] &gt;&gt; as yet. And so we can identify but Paul
[55:12] was also speaking to believers who were
[55:16] and had accepted uh the gospel at that
[55:19] time and we've accepted the gospel in
[55:22] this hour. So I would like to say both
[55:25] believers
[55:26] and unbelievers are exposed or subjected
[55:29] to travail of life's journey. It doesn't
[55:35] just happen in a day or an hour or a
[55:37] week, but it happens in life's journey.
[55:41] And listen now, you that are uh
[55:45] Americans or Canadians or what other
[55:48] nationality you may have, you are
[55:50] identified according to the prophet,
[55:52] you're identified with your nation.
[55:55] You're identified with their glory.
[55:58] You're identified with their shame.
[56:01] You're identified with their victories.
[56:04] You're identified with their struggles.
[56:06] You may not have gone to war, but you're
[56:08] identified with the war. You're
[56:11] identified with the sufferings. And so,
[56:13] collectively uh collectively we are what
[56:17] our nation is collectively. And you
[56:21] contribute something to that nation.
[56:24] even though it is might be a minute
[56:28] infotitional part but they might say
[56:32] well uh uh as the American people are
[56:34] known I've traveled much of the world
[56:37] the American people are identified by
[56:39] generosity
[56:41] they're identified by the friendly south
[56:46] are identified by certain things
[56:49] Canadians are identified as being cold
[56:52] or withdrawn on or formal, but
[56:57] we are what we are. I I'm not a
[56:59] Canadian. I'm a Ukrainian.
[57:03] I'm a Canadian.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; So, we are what we are and we are what
[57:08] we are what our nation is.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; And we're identified whether we like it
[57:13] or not. We're identified with it.
[57:21] Now, although believer and unbeliever
[57:23] both, are you listening?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; They're subjected to or exposed to the
[57:30] travail of life's journey. And I'm going
[57:32] to get into this very deep. So, please
[57:35] just really stay alert if you would
[57:37] don't don't let your mind wander.
[57:40] But the result of the believer, the
[57:42] result, the end result for a believer or
[57:46] an unbeliever is completely in two
[57:48] different worlds.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Totally two different worlds.
[57:53] The wisest man in his time at least,
[57:56] Solomon, he said, "There is a way that
[58:00] seemth right unto a man, but the end
[58:03] thereof is the ways of death." And I can
[58:05] tell you that that man's ways is not
[58:07] easy either. There's a way it seems
[58:09] right to a man. And he goes along. He
[58:12] has his struggles in life, in his
[58:13] journey. He has his struggles, but the
[58:16] end of it is death.
[58:19] Peter said, "Be sober. Be vigilant."
[58:23] Because your adversary, not his
[58:26] adversary, your adversary, the devil, as
[58:29] a roaring line. He's a roaring line this
[58:32] morning while you're sitting here in
[58:34] church. He's a roaring line. Listen to
[58:36] me, friends. He's scheming
[58:39] &gt;&gt; how he can make your life more
[58:40] miserable.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; How he can bring affliction your
[58:45] direction.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; How he can cause sickness to come to you
[58:48] and disease and he's he can be patient.
[58:51] He can cause you he he's got his
[58:53] civilization going and he puts people in
[58:56] coal mines and they breathe in the dust
[58:58] so they end up with cancer and tumors
[59:01] and all kinds of things. He he's
[59:03] developed asbestous and all of those
[59:05] things, man. to take it out of the
[59:06] mountains and and now and then the years
[59:08] later they find out this is a this is a
[59:11] death trap people breathing this stuff
[59:13] in and then we get to you know thank Mr.
[59:16] Ford and all the other people for all
[59:18] the automobiles and then we find out
[59:20] we're we're breathing in all of these
[59:22] gases and we're making ourselves sick
[59:25] and and then we got all this food and
[59:27] it's beautifully packaged and refined
[59:30] and further refined until we eat
[59:32] ourselves to death. But they, you know,
[59:35] they just we we all just gobble it up.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And it's part of Satan's kingdom. And
[59:43] he's patient.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; But his intent, he's a roaring line.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; He's out there to make your life
[59:50] miserable, he's out there, if you're
[59:52] going to, if you're going to win the
[59:54] crown, he's going to try to make you
[59:56] pay.
[59:57] [Applause]
[59:59] &gt;&gt; It's going as a roaring lion. uh walketh
[1:00:02] about seeking whom he he may devour. Let
[1:00:06] you go home today and when you walk in
[1:00:08] the door, I want you to know that this
[1:00:10] scriptur is intact. He's walking around
[1:00:13] your house.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; He's trying to see what he can do to
[1:00:17] make it more difficult to bring travail
[1:00:20] upon you. But what he doesn't know is
[1:00:23] God has placed a seed
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; into the elected body of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:29] and and that elected one is bringing
[1:00:31] forth a life
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; and nothing can restrain that life. It's
[1:00:36] going to come forth
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; in its season
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; and it'll be to the glory of God. But
[1:00:42] Satan will try to make it as he did at
[1:00:44] Calvary.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; He said, and he tells us what to do.
[1:00:49] Resist him.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Resist him. Young men, young ladies,
[1:00:53] resist him. Parents, resist him.
[1:00:56] All who hear my voice, resist him
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; and steadfast in the faith, knowing that
[1:01:03] the same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:01:06] your brethren that are in the world.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; So, some are in the world, some are
[1:01:10] believers, some are unbelievers, but
[1:01:12] they all have the same travail, but the
[1:01:15] travail for the unbeliever is
[1:01:17] meaningless. It doesn't do anything for
[1:01:19] him.
[1:01:21] But the travail, and here's my key point
[1:01:23] that I you must get. The travail
[1:01:27] of the world, the travail of events, the
[1:01:30] travail of all the circumstances,
[1:01:33] whether it's economic, whether it's
[1:01:36] physical, whether it's mental or
[1:01:39] whatever kind of travail, the travail
[1:01:41] for the believer, only presses a person,
[1:01:45] the believer, more until it turns you
[1:01:49] Godward.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Difficulties turn you
[1:01:52] Godward. You begin to search into the
[1:01:55] word and you begin to go into the depths
[1:01:57] of the message and you find your mind on
[1:02:00] God and you find your want to pray and
[1:02:03] you find you want to surrender yourself.
[1:02:06] Isn't it wonderful? The travail of the
[1:02:08] world pushes us God.
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:14] [Applause]
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; You that are sitting and everything's
[1:02:19] just nice and easy. Just wait till your
[1:02:21] time comes.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And it will come.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; And you'll remember brother Ed's words.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; And you won't be like the unbeliever
[1:02:30] says, "Well, I think I'll just go and
[1:02:32] get me a bottle of booze.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; I think I'll just go to a bar." Cuz
[1:02:36] there's nothing in there that desires
[1:02:38] that. As soon as that pressure comes,
[1:02:40] you want to draw closer to God. You want
[1:02:43] to get nearer and you look heavenward.
[1:02:47] Say, "Oh God, I know you brought me
[1:02:48] here, and I know this is for a purpose.
[1:02:51] Work out this purpose in my life, and
[1:02:53] it's the sun that's being formed,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; bringing you to the desired place and
[1:03:01] moment and time.
[1:03:08] Satan is in opposition
[1:03:10] to all that you stand for as a
[1:03:12] believer." Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And so, Apostle Paul said to the
[1:03:16] Thessalonians, and he says to us, "Who
[1:03:18] opposeth and exaltth himself above all
[1:03:21] that is called God."
[1:03:24] This the old serpent, the devil, he's
[1:03:28] filled with pride. He wanted to exalt
[1:03:31] himself. He wanted to exalt himself
[1:03:33] above the stars of God. He wants to and
[1:03:36] will achieve being worshiped by all
[1:03:38] whose names are not in the Lamb's book
[1:03:40] of life.
[1:03:42] And he says, and that this is the one
[1:03:44] that we're resisting.
[1:03:46] He said that he exaltth himself above
[1:03:48] all that is called God or that is
[1:03:50] worshiped so that he is that he as God
[1:03:54] siteth in the temple of God, showing
[1:03:56] himself that he is God.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care what country we're from or
[1:04:02] what our background is. This is what's
[1:04:04] happening in the world.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; This is what's taking place. This is his
[1:04:09] this is his ultimate ambition that he'll
[1:04:12] be recognized as God, re worshiped as
[1:04:14] God, sit in the temple as God and have
[1:04:17] the people deceived that he is God.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the eyes of the word.
[1:04:26] Thank God for the revelation. Thank God
[1:04:28] for his prophet in this generation.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:35] Now, I want to turn to bringing forth.
[1:04:38] We're bringing forth. Everybody's
[1:04:40] bringing forth something. You are
[1:04:42] bringing forth something. I don't care
[1:04:43] who you are.
[1:04:46] You're bringing forth something. You're
[1:04:48] expressing something.
[1:04:51] In the Old Testament, Israel as a nation
[1:04:54] brought forth a Rahab.
[1:04:58] She was a harlot, but brought forth a
[1:05:01] Rahab. and also brought forth a Solomon
[1:05:03] who was a general officer in the Israeli
[1:05:06] army that was invading uh the city. And
[1:05:11] the prophet said in the toolken sea
[1:05:12] Rahab came right back and courted the
[1:05:15] general in the army. And she brought
[1:05:18] forth a famous son.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And that famous son brought forth
[1:05:23] another famous son.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And that son brought forth another
[1:05:27] famous son until the great famous son
[1:05:31] came
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; right back down through Oed and on
[1:05:35] through Jesse and on to David who the
[1:05:38] scripture says was the father of Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ. Not after the flesh but after
[1:05:42] the faith. And Matthew 1:1 says, "The
[1:05:45] book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
[1:05:47] the son of David, the son of Abraham,
[1:05:51] in the unveiling of God, the prophet
[1:05:53] says,"Abraham
[1:05:54] waited 25 years
[1:05:57] on the child."
[1:06:01] Those 25 years, friends, were not filled
[1:06:03] with just delight and joy, and it wasn't
[1:06:05] a a picnic. That's
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; They were hardships.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; But he was waiting for a son. And God
[1:06:13] said so and that settled it. The word
[1:06:16] was there being watered by faith.
[1:06:20] Listen, he had all kinds of things
[1:06:22] happening in the physical realm, but the
[1:06:24] word was there.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; The promise was there
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; being watered by faith.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He believed in the promise that was in
[1:06:32] his heart.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Believing it and it brought forth. It
[1:06:45] brought forth. He didn't bring forth. It
[1:06:47] brought forth.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; The word brought forth
[1:06:51] the results
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; and it brought forth a son.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we are here in this most
[1:07:00] critical, desperate age of all times.
[1:07:04] the most deceptive age even to the point
[1:07:07] that the things that I'm speaking today
[1:07:10] almost seem unattainable or it seems
[1:07:13] that we are almost detached. We can
[1:07:15] speak about the martyrs and it's such a
[1:07:18] different world. We can hardly find any
[1:07:20] association with the martyrs because it
[1:07:23] was deny your faith or or lose your
[1:07:26] head.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And it was a just an instant decision.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And if you were faced with that
[1:07:32] this morning, I believe that for the
[1:07:34] biggest part, most of you would say,
[1:07:37] "Take my head. I won't deny my faith. I
[1:07:41] won't deny my convictions. And in a
[1:07:43] moment, I'll be in glory."
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; But this is a much more subtle
[1:07:49] generation. And we we hardly feel
[1:07:52] connected with it because of we will
[1:07:54] come to the pressures and the travail of
[1:07:56] this age. The in fact is the travail of
[1:07:59] this age is the pressure of soft living.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That's a travail.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; It's a problem for us
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; because it tries to defeat us.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says also now you have it
[1:08:16] brought forth. I've come from Rahab and
[1:08:18] one that famous son brought forth
[1:08:21] another famous son brought forth another
[1:08:22] famous son. That was not them saying, "I
[1:08:26] got to bring forth a famous son."
[1:08:28] Another one saying, "I got to bring
[1:08:29] forth a famous son so he can bring forth
[1:08:31] a famous son." It wasn't them. It was
[1:08:33] just happening.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And God was allowing events in the
[1:08:38] world, events in their time, and events
[1:08:40] in this time to develop and bring forth
[1:08:43] the word to its ordained and
[1:08:46] predestinated place.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; And the best thing you can do to do is
[1:08:52] recognize
[1:08:54] I'm here for a purpose.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And be committed to that purpose.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Be impressed. As I spoke last Sunday, be
[1:09:03] impressed
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; by the word
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; that's amongst us.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; And I believe it was Stephen that was
[1:09:11] preaching. He said, "And when the time
[1:09:13] of the promise drew near,
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; not when the events of your life
[1:09:17] happened and when you came to a certain
[1:09:20] place and when you were educated or you
[1:09:22] finished your you finished your studies
[1:09:24] or or when you achieved a certain place
[1:09:26] in business. It had nothing to do that.
[1:09:29] It was when the time of the promise drew
[1:09:31] near
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; which God had sworn to Abraham, the
[1:09:36] people grew and multiplied in Egypt.
[1:09:38] They didn't know why they were growing
[1:09:40] and multiplying in Egypt. It was the
[1:09:42] word that was causing it.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Moses brought forth.
[1:09:52] Moses often in agony,
[1:09:55] agony of soul, he brought forth a son
[1:09:57] out of Egypt. Out of Egypt have I called
[1:09:59] my son.
[1:10:02] Moses was instrumental in bringing him
[1:10:04] forth in travail of soul. even to the
[1:10:08] place he said to God, "I didn't bring
[1:10:11] all these people. I didn't bring them
[1:10:13] forth."
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; But God said to him, "You brought them
[1:10:17] forth."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "I he he knew what he was
[1:10:21] talking about. He said, "I didn't
[1:10:22] conceive these children."
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; They didn't come out of out of me. I
[1:10:29] didn't conceive them.
[1:10:32] But God would not
[1:10:35] he would not change his program.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And in Exodus, he said is Exodus 3:12.
[1:10:42] And he said, "Certainly I will be with
[1:10:44] thee, and this shall be a token unto
[1:10:46] thee that I have sent thee when thou
[1:10:49] hast brought forth when you have brought
[1:10:52] forth this people out of Egypt. You
[1:10:56] shall serve God upon this mountain."
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It's almost there. I don't have a a
[1:11:02] scripture or anything in the message,
[1:11:04] but it's almost as though Egypt was a
[1:11:06] womb and God just allowed his children
[1:11:10] to develop and get to a certain place
[1:11:13] and then the birth couldn't be stopped.
[1:11:16] It was like the the gates opened up and
[1:11:18] the children issued out of that place.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:25] Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And Moses brought them forth the pangs
[1:11:30] of birth. And Moses heard the people
[1:11:32] weep throughout their families in
[1:11:35] Numbers 11th chapter. Every man in the
[1:11:38] door of his tent. Every man,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; This wasn't a couple people.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Every man in the door of his tent. And
[1:11:47] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:11:49] greatly. Moses also was displeased. And
[1:11:52] Moses said unto the Lord, "Wherefore
[1:11:54] hast thou afflicted thy servant?
[1:11:57] Wherefore have you afflicted me? Why am
[1:12:00] I under such a an agony? And wherefore
[1:12:03] have I found favor in thy sight that
[1:12:06] thou layst the burden of all this people
[1:12:08] upon me? Have I conceived all this
[1:12:11] people? Have I begotten them
[1:12:15] that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry
[1:12:18] them in thy bosom?" and as a nursing
[1:12:21] father beareth a suckling child unto the
[1:12:24] land which thou swearest unto the
[1:12:26] fathers. I didn't conceive them. They
[1:12:29] weren't begotten out of me. How can I
[1:12:32] carry them? And you say to me, carry
[1:12:34] them as a as a father carries a suckling
[1:12:37] child in his bosom and carry them to
[1:12:40] this land.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't he couldn't understand
[1:12:43] everything that was happening. He was
[1:12:45] human like you and I. And we hear and we
[1:12:48] en encounter things and we have
[1:12:50] difficulties in our lives and
[1:12:52] difficulties in our homes and
[1:12:54] difficulties. Maybe you young people
[1:12:55] have difficulties. Listen to brother
[1:12:57] Biscll this morning. It's because you
[1:13:00] have come in contact with the word of
[1:13:02] God and because God puts a seed into
[1:13:05] your soul and you cannot escape this
[1:13:08] call.
[1:13:10] And God doesn't care about the meltdown
[1:13:12] and the economics and all the financial
[1:13:14] things and job or no job or this that or
[1:13:17] the other thing. He's not interested in
[1:13:19] that. He's interested in one thing. I
[1:13:22] have I have charged and given you my
[1:13:24] word and you're going to carry it
[1:13:26] through this generation.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; And when it's all done, the son of God,
[1:13:31] Jesus Christ, will be greater glorified.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; This is your purpose of living. This is
[1:13:38] why you're breathing breath today.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And all these other things are just to
[1:13:44] kind of help us through.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Israel brought forth
[1:13:54] Israel brought forth an Elizabeth and a
[1:13:57] Mary. This is collectively speaking.
[1:13:59] Israel brought them forth.
[1:14:06] It doesn't even say
[1:14:08] it refers to their mother and father
[1:14:12] and who gave them natural life. But
[1:14:15] that's really where it ends.
[1:14:17] You've got your mothers and fathers here
[1:14:20] or someplace in the world. But that
[1:14:22] that's rather incidental.
[1:14:25] The real one is you were born again.
[1:14:29] You received a birth.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Through Jesus Christ.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Israel brought forth an Elizabeth.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth Isaiah 43 43 and
[1:14:43] 4.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; She brought forth Isaiah 40 and3 and
[1:14:49] brought forth Malachi 3 and1.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Israel brought forth Elizabeth. But
[1:14:55] Elizabeth brought forth the scripture.
[1:14:58] She brought forth John the Baptist.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I'm getting excited, friends.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; The nation or the world or the earth or
[1:15:10] your families brought forth. You
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; brought forth as an Elizabeth, but she
[1:15:15] brought forth the scripture.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Behold, I send my messenger
[1:15:20] before thy face. That's what she brought
[1:15:22] forth. Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; She brought forth John the Baptist,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; the voice she brought forth him that
[1:15:31] crith in the wilderness.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Prepare ye the way of the Lord. That's
[1:15:35] what came out of her womb,
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and make straight in the desert a
[1:15:39] highway for my God. Do you folks see
[1:15:42] where I'm going?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Do you see where we're going?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about us right here.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Your nations, your parents, your
[1:15:54] countries brought you forth. But you
[1:15:56] brought forth the word of God.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You've been given the privilege. You
[1:16:01] brought forth
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; this word, a living word.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; In the pangs of death, in the pangs of
[1:16:13] birth,
[1:16:15] Elizabeth brought forth one. Behold, I
[1:16:18] will send you my messenger, and he shall
[1:16:21] prepare the way before me,
[1:16:24] one whom Jesus called Elijah.
[1:16:27] So, Israel brought forth Elizabeth, but
[1:16:30] Elizabeth brought forth Elijah.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Can you accept that?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Among women, there's none born
[1:16:40] of women that hath risen the greater
[1:16:43] than John the Baptist. Notwithstanding,
[1:16:46] he that is least in the kingdom of
[1:16:47] heaven is greater than he. And then he
[1:16:50] went on and ended in Matthew 11:14. And
[1:16:53] if you will receive it, this is Elias or
[1:16:55] Elijah which was for to come.
[1:16:58] Israel brought forth Mary.
[1:17:02] Listen close.
[1:17:09] Mary brought forth Isaiah
[1:17:11] 7 and 14. And therefore the Lord himself
[1:17:15] shall give you a sign.
[1:17:18] Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:17:21] a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel.
[1:17:25] Israel brought forth Mary. Mary brought
[1:17:28] forth Emmanuel.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Mary brought forth the fullness of the
[1:17:31] Godhead bodily. Mary brought forth the
[1:17:34] redeemer that you call the Lord Jesus
[1:17:36] Christ. Mary brought forth your savior.
[1:17:40] God brought it forth through her, but
[1:17:42] she was the instrument. She was the one
[1:17:44] who travailed. And even then, listen to
[1:17:47] this friends. Listen, I was shocked when
[1:17:50] it even came to my thoughts. Even then,
[1:17:52] she was bringing forth God, the fullness
[1:17:55] of God bodily.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; God did not lessen the travail of
[1:17:59] natural birth.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; She still participated in the curse.
[1:18:05] She was bringing forth the one who was
[1:18:07] going to deliver the entire world from
[1:18:10] the curse. But she still had to bear the
[1:18:12] curse.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; In sorrow.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; In sorrow you shall conceive.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; In sorrow you'll bring forth children.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And she had the pain. And God didn't
[1:18:26] lighten the agony
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; of the travail.
[1:18:31] They were under Rome and under taxation.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And when she was heavy with child, ready
[1:18:38] to give birth,
[1:18:41] she experienced what all women
[1:18:43] experience. which is heavy with child.
[1:18:47] The scripture says
[1:18:49] Joseph had to journey from Nazareth
[1:18:54] to Bethlehem
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; 80 miles
[1:18:59] on a donkey
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; with no Hampton ends
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; and no delightful places
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and actually had to journey through
[1:19:07] Samaria which they were enemies with
[1:19:11] Samaria and there's you could be sure
[1:19:13] that they didn't receive any kind
[1:19:15] reception
[1:19:16] from the Samaritans and she's right in
[1:19:19] the moments of bringing forth Emmanuel,
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; just one daughter individually of the
[1:19:28] whole nation of Israel. One woman
[1:19:30] collectively, but look what she was
[1:19:32] doing for the whole nation and the whole
[1:19:35] world.
[1:19:37] My friends,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; my friends and brothers and sisters in
[1:19:42] Christ, you are individuals, but you
[1:19:45] have no concept of what it is you're
[1:19:48] bringing forth.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; God is going to judge this generation by
[1:19:51] your life.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; God is going to judge your neighbors,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; by your life,
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; because he's going to say, "It wasn't
[1:20:00] them. You thought it was Susie. You
[1:20:03] thought it was Mary. You thought it was
[1:20:05] John. You thought it was Bill, but it
[1:20:07] was me.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; He's going to judge the people you work
[1:20:13] by by your life.
[1:20:24] in your womb and bring forth a son and
[1:20:27] shall call his name Jesus.
[1:20:31] And it came to pass in those days that
[1:20:34] there went out a decree
[1:20:37] of Caesar Augustus that all the world
[1:20:39] should be taxed.
[1:20:41] I don't know whether Joseph grumbled
[1:20:44] about it or not.
[1:20:46] The taxation
[1:20:48] coming at such an inopportune time. My
[1:20:52] wife is heavy with child or the woman
[1:20:54] I'm a spouse to and here I've got to go
[1:20:56] out in the public. I haven't even taken
[1:20:59] her to wife yet. She's I'm a spouse to
[1:21:02] her and God has called her my wife and
[1:21:05] I'm taking her out in the public heavy
[1:21:07] with child
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; and God had make this journey
[1:21:13] 80 miles and they say that it took at
[1:21:16] least a week or more.
[1:21:19] No bathrooms,
[1:21:24] no places to comfort zones or comfort
[1:21:27] stations.
[1:21:30] What was happening? The word was coming
[1:21:33] forth in travail.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Not only physical travail, but the
[1:21:38] travail of the exterior, the elements of
[1:21:41] the world.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But all of those pressures. Listen to
[1:21:48] me, friends. All of those pressures were
[1:21:51] only doing one thing. It was bringing
[1:21:53] forth Jesus Christ.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday. He's the
[1:21:59] same in Mary's time. He's the same in
[1:22:02] August the 28th, 2010.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; It's not your little life and the little
[1:22:09] circumstances of your life. It's the
[1:22:12] main purpose you have been sent here and
[1:22:14] called of Almighty God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And there isn't a detail of your life
[1:22:20] that God is unconcerned about or doesn't
[1:22:23] know anything about or can't do anything
[1:22:25] about it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; And I trust that you'll be as committed
[1:22:29] to him
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; as he is to you.
[1:22:35] And Joseph went up from Galilee,
[1:22:39] out of the city of Nazareth, unto Judea,
[1:22:42] unto the city of David, which is called
[1:22:44] Bethlehem, because he was of the house
[1:22:46] and lineage of David,
[1:22:49] to be taxed with Mary, his espoused
[1:22:51] wife, being great with child. And it was
[1:22:54] so that while they were there, the days
[1:22:57] were accomplished.
[1:22:59] She also was a woman, and the woman
[1:23:01] couldn't wait.
[1:23:04] because the hour her hour had come
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; and here she's caught in all of these
[1:23:09] circumstances.
[1:23:11] Uh talk about inconvenient circumstances
[1:23:17] and there's no place in the end and she
[1:23:20] ends up with the animals.
[1:23:25] Don't go home.
[1:23:27] Take your front room and your kitchen
[1:23:29] for granted.
[1:23:33] Even in a day of luxury acc by by their
[1:23:38] standards
[1:23:40] we live in the lap of luxury. We have
[1:23:43] all kinds of things and throw more away
[1:23:45] in our garbage than they had to eat.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; But it's still Jesus Christ.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; At at one time he's considered a good
[1:23:57] man and the next time he's considered a
[1:23:59] deceiver. Some some considered him a
[1:24:01] great teacher. Some people think the
[1:24:03] message, oh, it's great. I've never
[1:24:05] heard anything like it. But they they're
[1:24:07] not committed to it.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Is this service meaning something to
[1:24:13] you?
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And it was while they were there, the
[1:24:20] days were accomplished that she should
[1:24:21] be delivered. and she brought forth her
[1:24:24] firstborn and wrapped him in swaddling
[1:24:26] clothes and laid him in a manger because
[1:24:29] there was no room for them in the end.
[1:24:34] The people cried out for a Messiah. The
[1:24:36] prophet of God said, brother Brandham
[1:24:38] said they cried out for a Messiah and
[1:24:40] God sent him a baby.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; So he says the world then was falling
[1:24:48] apart like it is today. Like it is
[1:24:50] today. Every nation was looking for
[1:24:52] someone to hold them out of this
[1:24:54] tragedy.
[1:24:56] Wouldn't the world love to have Wouldn't
[1:24:58] the countries of the world love to have
[1:25:00] say, "Here I am on the scene and I'll
[1:25:03] lift you out of this terrible economic
[1:25:05] dilemma, 14 million Americans without
[1:25:08] work. We'll put everybody to work."
[1:25:10] Wouldn't that be a messiah? Wouldn't
[1:25:12] they be a hero in a minute? and say you
[1:25:15] people that don't have any
[1:25:18] your economy is down and you people that
[1:25:20] have civil war here I'm on the scene I'm
[1:25:24] going to bring peace between the
[1:25:26] communities. Wouldn't that be something?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He said for someone to hold them out of
[1:25:33] this tragedy that was about to strike
[1:25:36] the world and trying to get get them
[1:25:39] hold them together. The nations were
[1:25:41] looking for something and each nation
[1:25:43] was looking for it, but they looked like
[1:25:45] they didn't want to accept what God sent
[1:25:48] them.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; They were asking for a man, a Messiah
[1:25:54] that would stomp out the rest of the
[1:25:56] nations, and God gave him a baby.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Asking for a general, and God gave him a
[1:26:02] baby.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; But that was God's plan. I'm going to
[1:26:06] bring a baby forth. I'm going to bring a
[1:26:08] son forth. It's going to be in travail
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; from the outside, from the elements,
[1:26:14] from natural life, and from the physical
[1:26:17] yourself,
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; the individual.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Under birth pains, under travail, the
[1:26:25] church brought forth
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; the church brought forth Luther.
[1:26:30] And I tell you friends, if you'd like to
[1:26:33] be in Luther's companion, you'd be
[1:26:35] hightailing it with him on horseback in
[1:26:38] every other way, trying to escape the
[1:26:41] killing of the people because he was
[1:26:44] hated, hated, hated. And the greatest
[1:26:47] power, the pope and the church was after
[1:26:50] his hide.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; But the church, it couldn't wait. That
[1:26:56] messenger had to come forth because it
[1:26:59] was the word of God in the church
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; and it had to burst forth and couldn't
[1:27:07] wait any longer. And Luther had to come
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and his mother travailed in birth. But
[1:27:15] more than that, he travailed because he
[1:27:17] was carrying the son of God.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He was carrying part of the word.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; God give me strength. Amen.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And the word the church brought forth a
[1:27:29] Wesley and the church brought forth a
[1:27:32] Pentecost.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; He says and the and she the church had
[1:27:39] birth painans. He said under Luther the
[1:27:42] church had birth painans. And now we
[1:27:44] know there's seven church ages and seven
[1:27:47] messengers to them. Church ages
[1:27:49] according to Revelation. And now when
[1:27:51] Luther had to come forth, it certainly
[1:27:53] threw the church into birth pains, but
[1:27:56] it brought forth a Luther.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And after it got into trouble again, it
[1:28:02] brought forth a
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Wesley.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And got forth again, and it brought
[1:28:06] forth a Pentecost.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Each of them, the messengers of their
[1:28:10] age, rock back to the word, the message
[1:28:13] of their age.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. According to the Bible. And
[1:28:18] can you imagine read in Revelation 1 and
[1:28:21] there's seven messengers in the right
[1:28:22] hand and that time came it was Jesus
[1:28:25] Christ himself and he knew the different
[1:28:28] station he had to come to age after age
[1:28:31] and when it came to a certain place
[1:28:32] there went the first messenger
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; and then went the second messenger
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; and then went the third messenger and on
[1:28:41] and on until he only has one in his
[1:28:43] hand. Oh, I love this scene. Christ
[1:28:46] Emmanuel himself. One in his hand left
[1:28:50] him and Elijah.
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; It's always been that way.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Him and Elijah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; When he came down to be baptized, it was
[1:29:02] him and Elijah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; When the great multitudes were coming,
[1:29:07] it was him and Elijah was in jail.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; This gospel, don't take it lightly. It's
[1:29:15] still dripping with blood.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And you young people, you young fellas
[1:29:20] and young ladies that maybe don't think
[1:29:21] this is associated with you, God's going
[1:29:23] to actually stand and hold you
[1:29:26] accountable for what you're hearing
[1:29:27] today.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; God trying to get a message to you.
[1:29:40] God
[1:29:42] the Messiah Jesus Christ and Elijah
[1:29:48] and the and the conditions of the world
[1:29:50] were developing
[1:29:52] and uh and the earth's gone into a
[1:29:55] incredible birth pain
[1:29:58] and gas and mustard gas. My wife's daddy
[1:30:03] was in that war. Well, people fell right
[1:30:06] in the trenches beside him and uh and
[1:30:10] when one of his buddies said, "I feel
[1:30:11] it. I'm going to I feel I'm going to get
[1:30:14] it today." And he got killed right
[1:30:15] beside him. And and and her uncle was in
[1:30:19] that war. And those two men came out.
[1:30:23] Her daddy, my wife's daddy, had to come
[1:30:25] out because he was carrying the seed of
[1:30:27] this woman. That was to be my wife
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; and to be an example to many others.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; He could not. God protected. It wasn't
[1:30:35] him. It wasn't his gun or bullets.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; And God protected your parents wherever
[1:30:41] they were to bring you on the scene
[1:30:44] because you're part of the word of God.
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And I want you to recognize who that
[1:30:54] word is. It's Christ. Jesus Christ. the
[1:30:56] same one that was in the womb of Mary.
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; That's who it is.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; with the word
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; that's in our midst. Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "When the people cry out
[1:31:26] for a prophet, God sends them one."
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; God only sends his prophets when the
[1:31:31] people wants a prophet. God sends a sign
[1:31:35] when the people are ready.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; And when God sends a sign and when they
[1:31:39] don't want it, he said, he said, "Then
[1:31:41] they don't want it." He does send a sign
[1:31:43] and then they don't want it. So it's hid
[1:31:45] from the eyes of the wise and the
[1:31:46] prudent but revealed unto babes.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He said in a true sign that's over
[1:31:52] overlooked. Overlooked. A true sign
[1:31:54] that's overlooked. Let the people call
[1:31:56] for a prophet. God will put one on the
[1:31:58] scene. I challenge the nations to do
[1:32:00] that. Fall on your face and call on God
[1:32:03] to send a deliverer and watch what
[1:32:05] happens. But there was something within
[1:32:07] the people that were crying out.
[1:32:10] Pentecost of 1906
[1:32:13] uh and the great Isuza Street revival
[1:32:16] uh was had had broken and and the gospel
[1:32:20] was spreading over the globe.
[1:32:25] But there was something in the people
[1:32:26] because it was it was drifting from the
[1:32:30] genuiness and the power of that early
[1:32:33] Pentecost. It was already drifting and
[1:32:35] there was something in the people. But
[1:32:37] the earth who knew nothing about the
[1:32:39] gospel there, their boys are going to
[1:32:42] war and they're fighting in Europe.
[1:32:45] They're fighting in Russia. They're
[1:32:47] fighting in the Philippines. They're
[1:32:49] fighting in uh down in uh in uh uh not
[1:32:54] Vietnam, but in that in that in that
[1:32:56] area of Indochina, which it was at that
[1:32:58] time. They're fighting. and the Burma
[1:33:01] road was built and the Alaska Highway
[1:33:03] was built and they're fighting uh Japan
[1:33:06] and China just finished war and they're
[1:33:09] the troops are moving now the Japanese
[1:33:11] have are moving up the Illusian Islands
[1:33:14] coming right towards Alaska and Alaska
[1:33:17] has no no defense by way of road and
[1:33:21] there has to be a road built. You want
[1:33:23] to get if you want to see something, you
[1:33:26] young people where brother Ed lived, you
[1:33:29] go, they just had their 50-year
[1:33:31] celebration some time ago and they've
[1:33:33] put out de DVDs of the Alaskan the
[1:33:36] building of the Alaskan Highway. You'll
[1:33:38] see part of the travail troops
[1:33:42] froze to death and uh and the incredible
[1:33:45] expense that America went through to
[1:33:48] build a a land route from Canada to
[1:33:51] Alaska. And it was I thought it was in
[1:33:54] nine months. I've been reading up on it
[1:33:55] a wee bit some time ago. They actually
[1:33:58] put through 1,523
[1:34:02] miles, not kilometers, miles. 1,523
[1:34:08] miles in 7 months.
[1:34:14] Our cities and so on can't build a road
[1:34:16] for 10 miles in seven months.
[1:34:21] But war, why did they do that? Because
[1:34:24] the earth was in a birth pain.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; We might lose Alaska
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and Pearl Harbor's been bombed. And the
[1:34:31] earth is in a You might say, "Well,
[1:34:33] that's history." Listen, that's not what
[1:34:35] the prophet says. He said it's a birth
[1:34:36] pain.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And a birth pain indicates something is
[1:34:41] coming forth from it.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And something is coming forth. Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I think I've been clear and I still have
[1:34:50] more to say,
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; but I want to say to all who have not
[1:34:53] seen those days, there's a new world
[1:34:56] going to be birthed.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; There's a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; And I feel under the responsibility
[1:35:06] to ask you as you're sitting here,
[1:35:10] are you going to be in it?
[1:35:15] Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; It's more real than the one you're in
[1:35:18] today.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And these birth painans are bringing
[1:35:24] forth a new world.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; And this last messenger is a sign of it.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; The first world war is a sign of it. The
[1:35:33] second world war is a sign of it. And
[1:35:35] all the events that have happened since
[1:35:37] are all pointing towards the same thing.
[1:35:40] There's a new heaven and a new earth
[1:35:41] coming. Amen.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to expend my breath
[1:35:45] and my energy to to say to you, are you
[1:35:48] going to be in it?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and election sure.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You're not just going to, you know,
[1:35:56] float into it. You're not going into it
[1:35:58] on mother and dad's coattails. You're
[1:36:00] not going into it because you're
[1:36:02] associated or, you know, brother Biscll
[1:36:04] or Brother Ray or anybody else. You're
[1:36:06] not going in it because of that. You're
[1:36:07] going in it because you've been birthed
[1:36:09] yourself.
[1:36:10] [Applause]
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] you young people and even children
[1:36:16] and experience the same thing.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; The author of creation.
[1:36:33] I hope you can
[1:36:36] don't consider me
[1:36:38] off my rocker.
[1:36:42] I've pointed to these things over the
[1:36:44] years, but now I'm perhaps going to say
[1:36:46] it just a wee bit clearer.
[1:36:51] The author, the people cry out for a
[1:36:53] prophet. The people cry out for a
[1:36:56] messenger. The people cry out for a
[1:36:58] Messiah. And the prophet says, "God
[1:37:00] sends them one,
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; but they don't recognize it." And God
[1:37:05] sends them the sign, but they don't
[1:37:07] recognize the sign.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; The author of creation speaking
[1:37:16] in Revelation.
[1:37:18] He won't turn to it. I'm just going to
[1:37:20] refer to it. I think I have it a little
[1:37:23] further on.
[1:37:32] to our messenger. This was his
[1:37:33] commission.
[1:37:37] And under the angel of the church unto
[1:37:39] William Brandham in other words
[1:37:43] of the Leodysians, write
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; send this letter
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; to this messenger.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; These things saith the amen. I'm the
[1:37:53] amen.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; I'm the so be it. Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I'm the final word.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; This is truth.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet would say, "Is
[1:38:03] that true? Is that true? Is that true?
[1:38:06] Is what I've said is that true?"
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Because it was the spirit of truth.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; It was this one speaking through him.
[1:38:15] And further he goes on to say the
[1:38:17] beginning,
[1:38:19] listen, the beginning of the creation of
[1:38:23] God. Not that he was the first to be
[1:38:26] created as some think. Brother Brandham
[1:38:28] clarifies that. Makes it very very
[1:38:30] clear. But that he was the beginning. He
[1:38:33] was the author of creation.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; And now he's saying to his messenger, I
[1:38:38] am the author.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I'm the beginning and the end. I'm him
[1:38:43] that was dead and am alive. forever
[1:38:45] more. And this is who's speaking to you.
[1:38:48] I'm the alpha and the omega. I am the
[1:38:50] beginning of the creation of God.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; And when he says that, he describes, I
[1:38:57] know your works, etc.
[1:39:00] I will say it's the author of creation
[1:39:03] speaking through the prophet, his
[1:39:05] mouthpiece.
[1:39:07] And that I'm I'm skipping a whole big
[1:39:10] segment of life, what I could describe
[1:39:12] of brother Brandham's life. and and our
[1:39:15] our our
[1:39:17] relationship to it. But he speaks
[1:39:19] through his prophet mouthpiece and
[1:39:22] creates for himself his own bride.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; He's created all things.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; He created by the word of God.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; I can show you in a scripture clearly
[1:39:34] where Jesus Christ
[1:39:37] came
[1:39:39] physically
[1:39:40] into the womb of Mary. But first the
[1:39:45] words and promise of the prophets came
[1:39:48] into her mind and she believed what the
[1:39:52] angel said and she believed the word of
[1:39:55] God. And the prophet says the words of
[1:39:58] the prophets anchored in her womb.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm coming right straight out today
[1:40:03] to say have and I will say it. They have
[1:40:08] they have the words of the prophets and
[1:40:11] the word of this prophet. And the
[1:40:13] promise for this age has anchored into
[1:40:15] the virgin womb of the mind of the bride
[1:40:18] of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; The word, the promise has anchored into
[1:40:24] the womb. And that's that word that's
[1:40:26] going to bring forth.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Let me say it even more plainly. The
[1:40:31] word that is anchored in the virgin womb
[1:40:34] of the mind of the bride of Jesus
[1:40:36] Christ. It is that word that's going to
[1:40:38] bring forth a new heaven and a new
[1:40:41] earth.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; The new heaven and the new earth already
[1:40:45] at this moment is resident in the bride
[1:40:48] of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; It's not something that's going to drop
[1:40:52] from the skies. It's something that's
[1:40:54] already here.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within you.
[1:40:58] The kingdom of God is within you.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And that's a kingdom that's going to
[1:41:03] rule and reign in that time.
[1:41:05] [Applause]
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Now, who are you?
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Now, who is the bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Now, do you recognize who he is?
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Now, do you recognize the son that
[1:41:17] dwells in you?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; The alpha, the omega, the beginning and
[1:41:22] the end, the resurrection himself lives
[1:41:25] in the bride of Jesus Christ. The
[1:41:27] rapture is in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; A new world
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; is in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How can the
[1:41:39] church sit still at such words?
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And they've anchored in the womb.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Already anchored in the womb.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You believe it because you cannot do
[1:41:51] anything else.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And the season has arrived.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says he's standing
[1:42:04] speaking of Christ. He's standing in the
[1:42:06] midst of the church. And as he stands
[1:42:09] there revealing who he is in this last
[1:42:11] age. He calls himself the author of the
[1:42:13] creation of God. This is another
[1:42:16] creation.
[1:42:18] This has to do with the church.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; This is a special designation of
[1:42:23] himself. He is the creator of that
[1:42:27] church.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:42:31] bride.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Now say, God sent his own prophet Elijah
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; on the scene. Elijah, I trust you.
[1:42:37] You're the last one. Prophet says,
[1:42:39] "You're the most faithful spirit
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; of the prophets." The Elijah, he's the
[1:42:44] one that restored. He's the one who
[1:42:46] said, "Oh God, let it be known that I
[1:42:49] have spoken your word and I am your
[1:42:51] servant and send fire down." Fire came
[1:42:54] out of the heavens.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; The same spirit in this time.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is?
[1:43:08] Satan has made this world made it so
[1:43:11] easy
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; that you can just go home and click
[1:43:15] click click and stick something in your
[1:43:18] ear.
[1:43:22] and because of that.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I have any time.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; I'm real busy.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And this one that God himself
[1:43:37] sent to the prophet of God,
[1:43:40] we've got much more time for other
[1:43:41] things of this world. It's a trap.
[1:43:45] It's a travail
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; to take the time by force and and the
[1:43:50] righteous and to take it by force.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; We take it from the enemy.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; You're not going to rob me of this
[1:43:59] voice. You're not going to rob me of
[1:44:00] these promises. They've anchored into my
[1:44:03] soul.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] The bride possesses it already.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; It's already anchored in the womb of
[1:44:19] your mind.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; You can't even get rid of it. God
[1:44:24] anchored it there.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; And before he anchored it there, he took
[1:44:29] out all denominational trash.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; He purged you.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; You trinitarians and you that believed
[1:44:39] all kinds of false stuff. And God
[1:44:41] cleanse you of man because man's seed
[1:44:44] cannot be there with his seed.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And when he cleansed you, he said you're
[1:44:50] virgin.
[1:44:52] [Applause]
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; You're not just forgiven. You're virgin.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put my word
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; into your virgin womb of your mind. And
[1:45:09] I'm going to anchor it there.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; And it's going to bring forth the
[1:45:12] promise
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; of the new heaven
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; and a new earth.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; You're my wife.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; And I flip the finger of unmmerited
[1:45:22] grace. On your finger, the ring.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; And we're going to walk out together in
[1:45:29] a new heaven and a new earth. I'm going
[1:45:31] to renovate this one
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; by the same power that you possess.
[1:45:40] Lord,
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting what I'm saying.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And in this day, the scripture
[1:45:48] fulfilled. In this day, the scriptures
[1:45:50] fulfilled.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Listen to what's fulfilled.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Sunday afternoon, he said, "I got up to
[1:45:56] speak. I was going to take my text on
[1:45:58] birth pains
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; where Jesus said that as a woman in
[1:46:02] travail with a child, she's travailing
[1:46:04] in birth.
[1:46:06] And so I was going to speak from there
[1:46:08] as birth pains, saying that the world is
[1:46:12] in birth pains now. God had his Elijah
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; and was telling him, "Tell the people
[1:46:20] there's birth, the earth is in birth
[1:46:22] pains now." And it wasn't a war. It
[1:46:26] wasn't that millions were getting slain.
[1:46:28] It's a different birth pain. It was
[1:46:31] pains because Satan was putting all of
[1:46:33] his lather and all of his uh you know
[1:46:36] all of his flattering words and trying
[1:46:39] to persuade people and he was convincing
[1:46:42] the Lutheran and the Baptists and the
[1:46:44] Pentecostals and all of them come in and
[1:46:46] saying to the Pentecostals look there
[1:46:48] the Catholics are even speaking in
[1:46:50] tongues. Yeah. Oh. So the the all the
[1:46:53] priests and everyone come in and God's a
[1:46:56] messenger standing behind the pulpit
[1:46:58] with Catholic priests behind him handing
[1:47:00] him a Bible to read out of and they were
[1:47:03] just lathering it all up and sucked them
[1:47:05] all in and the prophet say you're in a
[1:47:07] birth pain
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; and you don't know it.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; You're going to a slaughter
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; and you think you're going to a revival.
[1:47:20] you're going to a slaughter.
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; And his soul bled, his soul hungered,
[1:47:29] his soul craved
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; for a people.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; But God cheered his heart. He saw a
[1:47:37] bride coming.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw a bride coming.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; The one that would be pregnantated by
[1:47:45] the seed.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; The word of God. Thus say the Lord
[1:47:49] coming out of the prophet's mouth
[1:47:51] pregnant her
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I say to you married woman you married
[1:48:00] woman you wife of Jesus Christ
[1:48:04] you're on your way home
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; you're on your way home
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; you're on your way home that's what this
[1:48:12] is all about
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; that's why you're going through what
[1:48:16] you're going through on your way home
[1:48:24] Under every prophet's message,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Israel got a birth pain because these
[1:48:29] prophets would come on the scene.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; After the theologians and clergymen
[1:48:35] would have have the church in all
[1:48:37] organization form
[1:48:40] when the prophets came on the scene,
[1:48:41] thus said the Lord, they shook them
[1:48:44] churches and she had a birth pain. And
[1:48:47] finally she had birth painans plum on up
[1:48:50] until she delivered a son of the gospel
[1:48:54] which was the word himself made flesh.
[1:48:57] And I want to tell you the birth painans
[1:48:58] that the earth had gave birth. It was
[1:49:01] the it was out of the collectively the
[1:49:04] earth gave birth to a son of the gospel
[1:49:08] in this case called a prophet of God. He
[1:49:11] had to come on the scene first with the
[1:49:13] spirit of Elijah on him. It was not it
[1:49:16] it was not just Ella and whatever
[1:49:19] Brandham that gave birth to him. It was
[1:49:21] God himself that caused that seed to
[1:49:24] come on down in America and in one sense
[1:49:28] gave us a prophet. But God gave us a
[1:49:30] prophet. God gave us Elijah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; It was no one else. It was God Almighty.
[1:49:38] Why? Because it was time for Luke 17:30.
[1:49:43] Jesus Christ the son had to be revealed.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; He'd come to He had to He had to be
[1:49:48] issued out.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; He had to come.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Nothing could hold it back.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30
[1:49:58] had been in gestation
[1:50:01] for all of these centuries and and he
[1:50:04] had come to a forming point and he could
[1:50:07] not be held back any longer. and he
[1:50:10] gushed out into the earth
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; with signs and wonders and miracles
[1:50:14] exactly as he did 2,000 years ago.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Say it, Brother Roy.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I know it's registering.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Let the people of the Lord say so.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; The word is anchored in the womb of my
[1:50:35] mind.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:50:41] Hallelujah.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; And this prophet came with this prophet
[1:50:44] came with promises.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Promises.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; And it's those promises that have
[1:50:52] anchored.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; It was not William Bratton speaking. It
[1:50:56] was God himself speaking. It was Jesus
[1:50:59] Christ who commissioned him. You take
[1:51:01] this message
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; and you speak it.
[1:51:06] Amen.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Why do you think it's anchoring in the
[1:51:08] hearts of people? Why do you think it's
[1:51:10] happening and moving so quickly?
[1:51:13] I took about 2, three minutes. I said to
[1:51:16] brother Murphy, you're going to be
[1:51:17] translating. I want you to get the
[1:51:20] direction I'm going. It's a very
[1:51:21] important message.
[1:51:23] And oh, he said, you've already you're
[1:51:25] already preaching to me. He was just
[1:51:27] already getting it within about 3, four
[1:51:29] minutes. I said, uh, what's happening in
[1:51:32] those countries? What's happening in
[1:51:33] Serbia and all those countries? I can
[1:51:35] tell you what brother Tom faced in
[1:51:37] Serbia is a it's light years away from
[1:51:40] what we had many years ago.
[1:51:43] You you're preaching in the Baptist
[1:51:45] church trying to find one trying to find
[1:51:47] one here, trying to find one there. But
[1:51:49] there's an elect body of believers
[1:51:51] today. And why are they a stable bunch
[1:51:53] of believers? Because the word is
[1:51:55] anchored in the virgin womb of their
[1:51:57] mind.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; And that word is specific.
[1:52:02] Amen.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; When the scripture says the virgin shall
[1:52:05] conceive and bring forth a son and the
[1:52:08] prophet said that word, that promise
[1:52:10] anchored in her womb. Don't take that as
[1:52:12] just some poetic thing. It anchored in
[1:52:14] her womb
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; and she brought forth the son
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; because that's what the promise called
[1:52:20] about.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And when the prophet of God comes in
[1:52:23] this day and prepares a bride, wait till
[1:52:26] 1964 and then speaks to us speaks to you
[1:52:29] about future home. That's not for the
[1:52:31] world. They're not going there. You're
[1:52:34] going home, friends. You're going home.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And God sent this messenger to describe
[1:52:43] your home
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; and how to get there and to tell you who
[1:52:47] it is
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; that is in you now.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; We can say it's a promise. I can say
[1:52:55] it's Christ. Help
[1:52:59] me just finish now.
[1:53:10] Now Christ
[1:53:12] when he came on the scene, the Bible
[1:53:14] says, who in the days of his flesh,
[1:53:18] when he had offered up prayers, he did,
[1:53:21] he still does,
[1:53:23] and supplications and strong crying and
[1:53:26] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:53:28] from death. and was heard in that he
[1:53:31] feared.
[1:53:33] That's still Christ today. You still
[1:53:36] have that. We have people and some are
[1:53:38] more given to it than others because the
[1:53:40] spirit has called them to a place of
[1:53:43] prayer and supplication
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and strong tears and crying.
[1:53:50] Why was he having that? Because the
[1:53:52] elements of the world were in direct
[1:53:54] opposition. But it was what was in him
[1:53:56] which was the word that was thrusting
[1:53:58] him forward.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus said, "I must go
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; to Jerusalem."
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And you can say, "I must go to the
[1:54:08] future home. I must go. This world is
[1:54:11] not my home. I'm just a passing through.
[1:54:14] My treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:54:16] beyond the blue." That's what the
[1:54:19] songwriter said because they didn't
[1:54:20] understand it completely. But my
[1:54:22] treasures are laid up just beyond this
[1:54:24] realm.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You can go back to your car and back to
[1:54:28] your home and drive down the black top
[1:54:30] freeway or whatever more, but that's
[1:54:32] just for this moment.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; And those things give you a lot of
[1:54:37] travail.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Some of you in it even now.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; What am I going to study? And where am I
[1:54:47] going from here? And I've just graduated
[1:54:50] and now what happens? And how how do I
[1:54:53] how do I manage? What do I how do I make
[1:54:56] my way through life? That's the travail.
[1:54:59] That's the journey part.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; You're journeying through it, friends.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; But I've been sent here today to tell
[1:55:08] you
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; the travail and your travel.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said travel is a better
[1:55:14] word. Right.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Travel is a better word because it's as
[1:55:20] you travel
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; and you come under from one day to
[1:55:24] another under the pangs. Remember the
[1:55:27] pangs are only there because the sun has
[1:55:31] come to a certain place.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; The development has come to a certain
[1:55:36] condition
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; and it's ready to be issued out. He's
[1:55:40] ready. You say what to the son of David.
[1:55:44] who will reign in the millennium
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; while you are at a marriage supper.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; You're giving birth.
[1:55:59] He has to to reach the glory
[1:56:04] a further glory
[1:56:06] of what his purpose is.
[1:56:09] Let me finish now please.
[1:56:12] Just a moment.
[1:56:16] In choosing of a bride,
[1:56:19] I'll say the promises for this day.
[1:56:22] These are my notes. The promises for
[1:56:24] this day spoken by God's prophet
[1:56:27] messenger have lodged into the womb of
[1:56:30] the mind of the virgin bride and she
[1:56:33] will bring forth. The promise for this
[1:56:36] day was lodged. The travail that we
[1:56:39] experience will bring forth a millennium
[1:56:41] reign
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; with the son of David on the throne.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; In choosing a bride, he said the other
[1:56:48] the others pregnant by the word of God,
[1:56:51] speaking of the bride and will bring
[1:56:53] forth the body, the finished body of
[1:56:56] Jesus Christ.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; The finished body of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I perhaps say it this
[1:57:08] way, friends? There's only seven
[1:57:10] messengers. There's only seven messages.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And God has put the conclusion in you.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; This is not the beginning. This is a
[1:57:23] conclusion. You have the opportunity
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; and I'm your brother. But if you disdain
[1:57:34] it,
[1:57:35] if you think little of it and say,
[1:57:38] "Well, I really don't care. I really
[1:57:41] haven't got time. I think that's too
[1:57:44] deep for me." Don't let it be too deep
[1:57:47] for you.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; You got the concluding message in you.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; You have the You possess a conclusion.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; And the conclusion possesses the
[1:57:56] rapture.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
[1:58:00] be changed. Amen.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Has that lodged in the womb of your
[1:58:03] mind?
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; We'll be changed
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; in a moment. In the twinkling, you can
[1:58:13] say, "My Elijah, my prophet, told me
[1:58:16] about a home I'm going to. He told me
[1:58:19] that the heavens are going to be on
[1:58:21] fire. Apostle Peter told me the heavens
[1:58:24] are going to be on fire." And the
[1:58:26] prophet came and detailed it. He said,
[1:58:28] "All the demons
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; and evil spirits,
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; the one that are walking around your
[1:58:34] home, the one that are walking around
[1:58:36] your life, God is going to burn them up
[1:58:39] in a holy fire.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:58:48] Hallelujah.
[1:58:52] Even so,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus
[1:58:59] Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Even so,
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:59:23] You've heard it
[1:59:25] and I leave you with it.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; May God help you
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; to take this with this seriousness
[1:59:33] that the Holy Spirit has brought it.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; I have much more that I could have said,
[1:59:38] but I feel that this is the end.
[1:59:42] This is as far as I am going to go.
[1:59:50] That wasn't to make you feel good,
[1:59:53] not to make you think more of yourself
[1:59:54] than you ought to.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; But to let you know
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; what it is.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; This is a real The gospel's always been
[2:00:07] real.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; People bored in a real way. Yes.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; You women that have bored children,
[2:00:16] let me just say it to you. Even with
[2:00:17] Emmanuel,
[2:00:19] even with God in the flesh,
[2:00:22] even with the son of the living God
[2:00:24] coming forth, the fullness of the
[2:00:25] Godhead bodily, yet she
[2:00:30] had to ride heavy with child
[2:00:33] and we're journeying. That was her
[2:00:35] journey.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; That was their travail.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:00:40] Don't whimper
[2:00:42] over the little trials we go through.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Rejoice
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; because the son, you're having the pain
[2:00:50] because the son is coming to his
[2:00:53] fullness.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; The travail in the world is upon us
[2:01:00] because the son is desiring to be
[2:01:03] birthed.
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:10] So nice to hear your rejoice.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; I don't need it, but I'm just glad it's
[2:01:15] ringing down deep.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand for a moment?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; And if you feel like you'd like to say
[2:01:27] glory to God,
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; just do so.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; This the house of God.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Feel perfectly liberty. Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Scream, shout, thank him.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Raise your hands.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Clap your hands. Whatever you want to
[2:01:43] do,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; give him glory.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Lord.

[2:07:48] And although
[2:07:49] you know he's a son of the
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; of America, we claimed him too.

[2:07:58] this pack sack. I love that pack sack. I
[2:08:01] love the message that went in it.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; I even said, "Brother John, do you speak
[2:08:06] Chinese?" He said, "Well, I've learned a
[2:08:08] little bit." so he could manage to eat
[2:08:10] and get by and carried those books there
[2:08:13] and stood outside the outside the
[2:08:16] government uh uh government churches and
[2:08:19] handed them out and they all thought it
[2:08:21] was part of the official program
[2:08:24] and now churches are there and people
[2:08:27] and the word is being spread. And I say
[2:08:29] glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. The
[2:08:32] elector are coming in.
[2:08:34] We have a great reward, Brother John.
[2:08:36] You have a great reward. And God has
[2:08:38] done great things for Brother John and
[2:08:40] his body. And we're so glad you're the
[2:08:44] one to pray and ask God's blessing on
[2:08:45] us, Brother John.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:52] I just feel as brother John was praying
[2:10:56] maybe there's someone you want to be man
[2:10:58] woman enough just to say
[2:11:02] I'm not really committed I haven't been
[2:11:04] really committed but God has spoke to me
[2:11:06] this morning
[2:11:08] I'd like this congregation to pray for
[2:11:10] me and as is a man. Jesus hung on the
[2:11:14] cross in full view of everybody. I
[2:11:17] wouldn't say to anybody, close your
[2:11:18] eyes, but just to raise your hand.
[2:11:22] God bless you, sister. God bless you,
[2:11:24] brother. God bless you, sister.

[2:11:36] hearts. God bless you, my brother.

[2:11:43] with the congregation just bow with me.
[2:11:48] Father,
[2:11:49] [Music]
[2:11:50] Father,
[2:11:51] [Music]
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; I knew that you touched hearts, Lord,
[2:11:56] as soon as you said, "Ask for those that
[2:11:59] want to be more committed,
[2:12:01] have not committed themselves
[2:12:03] completely."
[2:12:05] Oh father, I pray that there will be
[2:12:07] that you will you will now achieve what
[2:12:10] it is that you've spoken to them for a
[2:12:12] purpose and you've moved upon them. May
[2:12:14] they not forget it as they go out the
[2:12:16] doors, Lord. But may they even say to
[2:12:17] themselves, Lord, I will be fully
[2:12:21] surrendered. I will be fully committed
[2:12:24] to you, God. I give myself to you like
[2:12:26] the martyrs gave themselves to their
[2:12:29] gave themselves as as as their
[2:12:30] testimony. I give myself to you and I
[2:12:33] confess to you Lord that your promises
[2:12:35] and your word has anchored into the womb
[2:12:37] of my mind and I give myself to those
[2:12:40] promises. I yield myself Lord regardless
[2:12:43] of how how how the how difficult the
[2:12:45] journey is. I give myself to you. Many
[2:12:48] things about tomorrow I don't understand
[2:12:50] but I know that you know it Lord and you
[2:12:52] hold it in your hand. I pray you'll
[2:12:54] touch each one of these lives oh God.
[2:12:55] And as the whole congregation prays, we
[2:12:58] pray, Father, that their lives, everyone
[2:13:02] will be a sacrifice pleasing in your
[2:13:06] sight. And on that day, may they have
[2:13:09] the full assurance at this moment. And
[2:13:11] may they confess it boldly. I will be
[2:13:14] there. I will be seated at that marriage
[2:13:17] table. I You have gone to prepare a
[2:13:20] place for me. For me, for me, not just
[2:13:23] for us, but for me. and I give myself to
[2:13:26] these promises. Lord, bless them. I ask
[2:13:29] in Jesus wonderful name. And may this
[2:13:32] coming week be a glorious week for each
[2:13:34] one, Lord. And prepare us for Wednesday

[2:13:42] bless you. Hallelujah. Isn't he
[2:13:44] wonderful?

[2:13:48] tell them how wonderful he is. We could
[2:13:50] stay here all afternoon.
[2:13:52] It wouldn't be hard for me to sing this
[2:13:53] world is not my home. I'm just a passing
[2:13:55] through. But I know that you need to be
[2:13:59] uh on your way some of you. And wonder
[2:14:03] we could pray for our sister Eene.

[2:14:47] hip. She God delivered her immediately
[2:14:49] and she hasn't had a bit of pain since
[2:14:51] then. She has an infection in her body
[2:14:54] and she's taking medication. The
[2:14:56] medications affecting her body and I
[2:14:58] believe that this can end right here and
[2:15:00] now. Hallelujah. In this atmosphere,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; oh God, we curse this infection. May it

[2:15:15] bride. This is a bloodbought. This is a
[2:15:19] blood washed. This is a Holy Ghost
[2:15:21] fililled saint of the living God. This
[2:15:24] is an elect member of the body of Jesus
[2:15:26] Christ. And Satan, you have no part.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; You have no place in it. Lord, we bring
[2:15:32] a curse upon that infection and call for
[2:15:35] it to dissipate. Disappear out of this
[2:15:39] body. And may she not in be in need of
[2:15:41] any medication but be made every wet
[2:15:45] whole.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name and for the glory for his
[2:15:50] glory alone.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
