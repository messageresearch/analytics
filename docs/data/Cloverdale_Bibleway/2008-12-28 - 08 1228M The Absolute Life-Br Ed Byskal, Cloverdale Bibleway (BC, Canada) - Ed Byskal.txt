Praise your name, Lord. Hallelujah. I'm going to ask brother Ernie Villanoeva, Brother Ernie, if you'd come and just open the service in a word of prayer. If you have a need on your heart, a burden, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. Brother Ernie, let's bow our heads. [Music] Father, we come before the throne of grace today with thankful hearts for the love and grace and mercy that you have shown to us for including us in this great supernatural plan, a predestination, Lord, showing us the wonders of the future of eternity, Lord, and giving us a a clear picture of your blueprint, Father, giving us an and absolute. And thus sayaeth the Lord. Lord, we see the world crumbling all around us. We see what's happening in Israel now. Lord, we we see the the nations beginning to come against Israel to condemn her, Lord. And Lord, these are all signs. We have tomorrow's headlines in our hands today to the voice of a vindicated prophet. And Lord, how blessed we are, how thankful we are for a church and a church family and a ministry, Lord, that feeds us and stimulates that revelation in our hearts. And Lord, we want to also thank you for all those that are visiting with us on the internet, Lord, the the extended family, those are on the phone hookup. We pray Lord that every need that is here in this building in divine presence and also all across the world on the internet. We pray that great faith would rise in their hearts that they would believe that whatever their need is and we all have needs, Father, even if it's a need of more of you. I pray God that today the desires of everyone's heart would be met. And Lord, we pray for the man of God that would come to minister the word. We pray that he would come into an atmosphere that has been bathed with prayer and with with believers that are ready to take their little lick of fire, Lord, and add it to the the fire that that is a minister, the ministers of light, Father. Just just give him a liberty and a freedom and an anointing, Lord, to enter right into the word, not have to battle any spirits, Father. And let us walk from this place, Lord. each one of us be be aware, Lord, that that angels are here in this building ready to minister to us. Lord, how thankful we are for this supernatural life, Lord. It's the only thing in the world that sounds too good to be true. And yet, the glory and the wonder and the majesty of this word will not fully be revealed to us until we step on the other side. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, for those that are here visiting. We welcome them, Lord. We pray for those that are here in need of healing, in need of deliverance, or in need of salvation. Lord, let this be the day those that are holding the token over their family. Lord, let this be the day that great faith would rise in their souls to believe that all the promises of God are yay and amen. And we thank you for all this, all these blessings in your precious and holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] [Music] You may have your seats. And we've got a couple of announcements this morning. I got one from Brother Tony. Says, "And it's good to see Brother Tony, Sister Rebecca here. God bless you. It's good to have you. [Music] Amen. Uh it's going to be the 60th wedding anniversary for brother Ba and Sister Anne Langroot. Uh that'll be on January 10th, 2009 from uh 2:00 to 4:00. All are uh welcome. It's it's in the fellowship hall and there's a signup sheet on the uh on the bulletin board. So just make sure you you sign that and that would help a lot.

And there is a date that will be set for later. So you stay tuned for that. Amen. Sister Elizabeth has a special for us. God bless Elizabeth. [Music] The room grew still as she made her way to Jesus. She stumbled through the tears that made her blind. She felt such pain. Some spoken anger, heard folks whisper, "There's no place here for her kind." Still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until at last she fell before his feet. And though she spoke no words, everything she said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster. [Music] I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's alabaster box. Don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and dry them with my hair. You weren't there the night he found me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his love all around me. And you don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box. I can't forget the way life used to be. I was a prisoner to the sin that held me bound. I spent my days poured my life without measure into a little treasure box. I thought I'd found until the day when Jesus came to me and healed my soul with the wonder of his touch. So now I'm giving back to him all the praise he's worthy of. I've been forgiven. And that's why I love him so much. [Music] I've come to pour my praise on him like all from berries. I love Esther B. Friends don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and ride them with my hair. You weren't there when Jesus found me. me. You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the cost of the oil. No, you don't know the cost of my praise. You don't know the cost of the oil in my alve Master Brianna, [Music] we're going to turn to the word at this time. Our pastor is going to come. As he comes, let's sing number uh 562 on the screen. worthy. Hear the cries of the shadow. From the onset of time for the chains of the street there's no king.

My my so nice to see such a grand audience of people that have come out in this uh well we won't say much about the weather will we &gt;&gt; but I I will say this much I thank God for it you know why kind of quietened everybody &gt;&gt; found yourself a lot less active &gt;&gt; and I think God just wanted that &gt;&gt; so I don't want you getting mauled in the malls &gt;&gt; I just don't want you're tramping all over and doing a whole bunch of, you know, agitation and visitation. Just want you to be quiet at home. And uh I I thought it was wonderful. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why it stayed as long as. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you find that way? &gt;&gt; And then when you haven't had uh you know, haven't been around each other and haven't had fellowship and you miss services for a while and say, "Oh, I'm just here to drink it in." That's exactly the way I feel. Amen. And I'm just going to have you have your seats for a few moments. And we have u uh I guess it's just all right if we take our time today. Like brother Brandham so often says you're just so nice to talk to. He didn't just didn't want to hardly get to the word. Sometimes I just kind of waiting on it, you know. I just came in and I see our sister Jean Watkins here. Uh Sister Lisa's mom and our friends and wish her husband. Brother Eddie was here. Sister Jean, why don't you stand? I'd just like to recognize our dear friends. God bless you. Thankful for the Lord bringing you through what he's brought you through as well. We were praying for you, Sister Jane. God bless you. And uh someone we've been missing for a while, too, is Brotherh Scott Maloney. Where's Brother Scott? I'd like to have you stand, Brother Scott. Brother Scott just graduated from the Academy of the Royal RCMP. So, I guess he's going to follow in dad's footsteps. Is that a good plan, Brother Sean? A big question mark hanging over your head right now. Well, uh, fine young man. And, Brother Scott, we're proud and happy for you. And uh we know fine young men like this come from a good upbringing. And so a lot of credit to mom and dad, sister Janet and brother Shawn. And brother Scott is uh going to be posted up at Burns Lake, Northern British Columbia. And as much as we would like to have had him here, sometimes God overrules our likes and our wishes and even those of mom and dad, uh, friends, church, pastor, he just overrules it. And then all we can do is sit back and say, "All right, Lord. Now what?" You know that his plan and his ways are so far above our ways. And I can tell you for sure that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you you believe that, don't you? &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Some of you may be a little hesitant. I'll say it again. The footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he does all things well. Uh we received an email. I got an email uh of what was just what's just happened in the last last few days. And I uh Brother Derek, brother Dier, and and uh Brother Kim received this email as well, Brother Tony. And uh I I want to show uh we have about three pictures we can show and we'll show this first one. Uh this is uh this is a group in Shishuan province and uh it's a fairly fairly young group. And then there's a we have a picture just of a tribal uh picture that they sent also. Have the next picture please. There's just a tribal gathering and of some kind. I don't have a lot of information. And then there's a small group that's gathered in Shanghai also. There they are. Uh look like some very very fine people. Now we can take that off. And I'd just like to read this uh brother. This is from brother Murphy. You might remember these two brothers that I shared in my last report when I came back about two brothers he spoke of and I'm going to miss I'm going to omit their names and uh they were a seminary one was a seminary student who believed this message two and a half years ago and the other brother is a young man who started to print the message in his own church and help other churches to start their own printing stations. They went to different places after I left in November. And the Lord really blessed their trip. They visited some of the churches that I plan to visit. See, now this just goes back to what I said a moment ago. Brother Murphy had plans and these were places he felt he needed to go and so on and be there. And he says, 'I had planned to visit and didn't have time to do it in my last trip. One of the highlight is when they went to the southwest part of China, there were many minorities uh lived in this province, God gave them an open door to visit one church and in the uh myo tribe, that was the tribe picture you saw. And to their surprise, excuse me, to their surprise, uh, the church leader asked them if they can preach to their more than 600 congregation on Sunday. Those tribal people have their own language, but most of the people speak and understand Mandarin, too. They lived far from the civilization in the mountains and it took days of travel for the brothers to get there. They printed a sackload of messages, message books before they left and also duplicated 600 message DVDs of the recorded voice over messages. Those voice over happen right up here. And one time I told brother Murphy, you will reach more people from this little office than you'll ever reach in your lifetime. And I said, Apostle Paul reached more people from prison writing letters than he ever could have during his missionary journeys, which he had to make as well. That one doesn't take away from the other, but it's where the emphasis was. And he reached more people from prison. In fact is I said to him, Apostle Paul reached even to you and me. &gt;&gt; How thankful I am &gt;&gt; for the letters that Apostle Paul wrote in prison &gt;&gt; and he spanned millennium &gt;&gt; of time and and reached my heart and I'm so thankful for that. And if time shall go on, who knows what God wants to do with this message. So they duplicated these 600 recorded voice over messages. But after they duplicated all the DVDs, they started to get worried because they came to this new these new places without knowing anybody. How are they going to pass out all these DVDs? But by faith, they believe that the Lord is in control. After the preaching, they gave the message books and DVDs as a gift that packed in a little box to the ministers. There was an old minister from another province just happened to be in his church while the two brothers preaching. He came over the next day and wants to listen more. After he heard the brother, he said, he said, "You should write down what you said and print it in a book. It's wonderful." Then it gave the brother a chance to witness to him and he said, "Actually, I don't need to write in a book. It's already wrote in a book." And he pulled out the message and DVD and gave it to him. And the old minister asked them to come to their church and minister soon. Then these two brothers went to another city and that city is brother Ivan's hometown. There are three selfurches. There are three three selfurches in that city and have thousands of members. It's a it's a Christmas time then and as a tradition all those home all those church churches will have a big celebration during Christmas Eve which will draw thousands of people. So these two brothers decide to pass all the their books and DVDs outside the church. They packed up all the books and DVDs in their backpack and started off. That sounds familiar, I'm sure, to brother John Lei. They arrived to one church and stand outside of the gate and started to pass out the books to the people. And as they went in, they almost caused a riot. So many people swarmed and reached out their hands and hollered, "Give me one. Give me one." Soon they passed out about 200 of books and DVDs. This encouraged these brothers. They immediately run to another church which on the other side of the city. But when they arrived there, the church service already started. So they have to wait outside till the service is over. But they soon notice that there are many police and police cars with the lights flashing around the church. And they don't know what they are going to do. But they decide if we already are here we can't back up. So they started they stand beside the gate and wait for the people to come out. And when the service is over all the people started to come out. The two brothers start to hand over books and DVDs to the people. No more than a few books. And there was a security guard with the uniform came toward them and said, "What are you doing? What are you passing?" The brother became very nervous. But before he realized what happened, he suddenly said, "You want to know? Here's the book. Go read it." And the guard took the book and took a and took a look at the book and then looked at him and he said, "Can I help you pass it out? The brother gave him a handful of books and this security guard started to pass it out. Then more guards came over and get the books and started to pass it out and all the books and all the DVDs passed out by no time. [Music] Hallelujah. Praise God. Well, the thing that they feared didn't really come upon them. And brother Murphy says, "These two brothers felt very disappointed after the whole thing was done. They said, "Why did we only duplicate 600 DVDs? We should duplicate at least 6,000." So God has his way. Praise the Lord. Says, "I know thy works. Behold, I've set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it. For thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're going to be hearing from brother Tony. I spoke to brother Tony this morning and asked him to give me a a day when he'll be available in his schedule so we can hear what's taking place in Lebanon and Middle East. See what God is doing. I love the way God works. &gt;&gt; I love the way God does things. Unexpected. Before we turn to the word, I have you stand and I want to sing the anchor holes. Brother [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] my god. [Music] Of course. Once again like to ask you personally, have you been there? &gt;&gt; I've fallen on my knees &gt;&gt; when I faced the raging seas. And when you did, you discovered something. You discovered the anchor holes. It's going to be in line with what we're preaching this morning. The Lord willing. We'll sing it again. Sing it to the Lord. Sing with all your heart. The earth [Music] [Music] is Yeah. Heat. [Music] The ra [Music] I'll have you bow your heads with me as we join together in prayer. Our dear Lord Jesus Christ, our redeemer, our savior, the masterpiece from whom we have been struck. This peace, this bride peace is a part of you, oh God. Father, today we have a sense of such deep thanks and gratitude that for your mercy, your long suffering to us and how you have opened your word, how you have opened the book to us. Lord, for the people that have gathered today, I pray that there will be something that has been said delivered by the Holy Spirit. I pray to the heart to the inside of the inside Lord. Uh we do not want to just have a time when we feel good or when we feel a sense of uh uh just and thanksgiving for being together. That is wonderful. But Lord, we want to partake of your presence. We want to partake of the body word of the son of man. Let us eat that heavenly mana, oh God, that bread that was sent from heaven. And I pray, oh God, by the Holy Spirit, you will remove all formalities. Remove, oh God, any hindrance. I pray in the name of Jesus. Crush every obstacle, oh God, that the Holy Ghost may take control of every life, Father, from the youngest to the eldest. And Lord, as we submit ourselves, as I stand here at the post of duty, pray, oh God, you will take my lips to speak what you would have said. And the ears of the people, may they hear, not only hear, but may the hearts receive, oh father, do an eternal work. as we read of the and speak of the brothers in China and other parts of the world. Oh God, having brother Tony and sister Rebecca back here amongst us, Father, pray that you'll remember those that they have spoken to and witnessed to. Pray, oh God, the life that is within the word itself, the life of the seed. I pray it will just continue to work. Lord, may it be watered. And Lord, Father, I pray that you will take this congregation of people and all, oh God, who are standing with us now in prayer, those that are streaming the service, I pray that you will mightily come into the room where they are and anoint them, each one, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Now, may the word, Lord, may the author of the word come and give us the depth and the meaning of it. I pray for the benefit of your body, the precious bride of Jesus Christ, and to all glory will go to you in Jesus' name. Lovely name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Uh if you'll take your Bibles, please, and turn to First John the first chapter. And then we're going to turn to Luke's gospel, 1 John 1. And we'll start at the first verse. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon in our hands have handled of the word of life. For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us, that which we have seen, and and heard, declare we unto you, that we all that ye also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ. Turn if you would also to Luke the first chapter and I was going to read a number of verses. Well, perhaps we can take time. We've just come through the Christmas season and uh when the these verses have been read uh a great deal, but I want to especially have you notice one verse. We'll start at verse 26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth. to a virgin espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail thou that are highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Then said Mary unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" And the angel answered, and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. Amen. God bless his word and bless you as you have your seats. One thing I want you to remember also Wednesday night the service will begin at 9:00. We have watch night service Wednesday night and we're going to have a wonderful time. I was just wondering been really contemplating the order of the service. We've had a lot of singing and worship in the past and we'll have a number of different ones participating that way. But I felt to have uh the ministering brothers take about 15 minutes each and just say something that is very specific on their hearts. And I heard brother Brandham say the same thing. And I was just contemplating it and I come it's amazing you come and I was listening to a message and he said now he said uh we're going to have a watch night service and I guess we'll be hearing from a number of the ministers and I thought that was just what is exactly was on my mind. So I believe we have the mind of God. I want to bring to you uh something that I've been pondering and sometimes our thoughts are not just real real specific. They're not real clearly defined, but you feel you feel within your spirit, the Holy Spirit. It's like a something evolving, something developing. And sometimes it is it comes to you where there's just more emphasis being laid upon something. And over the past actually I can say over the past number of years I have increasingly become conscious and aware that for myself uh in life and with whatever ministry God allows me to have whatever influence I may have. I wish to influence people. I wish to instruct people. I would like to I feel it increasingly important to counsel people and and here today in my place and office of pastor of this church, I feel I need to emphasize the the the message itself. The we we speak of the message, we quote from the message, but I the the message has rapturing faith in it. &gt;&gt; The message is more important to you than you will ever realize in life. And I want to speak on the absolute life the message has within itself. And I'm sure you perhaps have said or have heard said the message has a life of its own. And that is true. And that life is an absolute life. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached on the absolute but I want to speak on the absolute life. Now the uh the the word absolute it might it might be relative to different people. You see it in a think of it in a different way. But the an absolute is it's total, it's complete, it's unqualified and it's supreme. And we need to really think about that because there are parts I have I have experienced uh even within my own self there are things which have been spoken and said by the messenger and it it it really runs opposite to your whole upbringing. it runs sideways to everything that people stand for in this in this time that we're in. And then and then so there's a tendency within a person to kind of you know uh maybe lessen the importance of that but yet it is important and then you may even you hear something you say oh my and then as time goes on you'll find out that's exactly &gt;&gt; what the messenger said &gt;&gt; and now you wake up to it and you find out because of the things that you experience. But an absolute is also having total power and authority. An absolute is not dependent upon anything else that doesn't depend on anything else or it's not qualified by anything else. It is an absolute within itself. &gt;&gt; There are two phases of of natural human life. There are two phases that re that within a human uh and I'd like to bring that to you like we've just read now that Jesus was born but we also know that Jesus the life of Christ was reflected all through the centuries of the Old Testament. The life of Christ was in Abraham. It was reflected in Isaac. It was reflected. But I will say this, it was not absolute in that it was not complete. It was not unqualified. Those are men, they made mistakes and they they they failed. But yet the life that was in them kept moving on because it had to come to a time when this son would be born. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he was born, then the life, the absolute life became manifested. &gt;&gt; There was no sin found in him. There was no error found in him. Oh, they thought that he did wrong. They thought that he spoke wrong. They perceived that he was weak. They perceived that he was perhaps too mellow. But the life that was being demonstrated was absolute life &gt;&gt; in the natural in the human uh not human but in the in in just natural life that we have around us in with flowers and botany life and whatever more the seed goes into the ground and then it goes through various stages of growth &gt;&gt; and uh and and I'll give some quotes just a in a few moments and it'll come up as a little as a the seed breaks open and the pulp pours out. It doesn't resemble the seed. It's not it doesn't feel like the same substance. Doesn't have the same appearance and and there's nothing that resembles the seed. And yet the life is in it. And then comes the blade. The blade's not the same color. The blade's not the same shape. The blade doesn't have any resemblance to the seed that went in the ground, but it is it is from the seed. So the life is there. It's moving up through the stalk. It comes into the head. It comes into the tassel. It comes into the actual shock that carries the seed and and it begins to look more and more like it, but yet it's not the seed. So the life, excuse me, the life of the seed is in it, but it's not in its absolute form. &gt;&gt; You follow me? It's not absolute yet. But then when the seed that went in the ground is seeded once again in the harvest time, then it becomes absolute because it has now matured to its full. It looks like it, it feels like it, it tastes like it. It is the same. &gt;&gt; We can say it is it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh knoweth it not the message knoweth it not. And if you'll just bear with me, I'm just going to take my time &gt;&gt; and when we run out of time, I'll quit and we'll pick it up uh uh right away. Again, in knoweth it not, he said, brother Brandham said, I was in my father. I was in my grandfather and and and my grandfather's grandfather by seed. I was in that and I was in Christ. You were in Christ from the foundation of the world. He was in his grandfather and his grandfather's grandfather. But the life that God had ordained that would come into the world and be a mouthpiece as a messenger was not in its absolute form. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; It was there. They didn't perhaps even know it. Uh it hadn't become manifest. So we don't know how it's, you know, what animation it's going to have, how it's going to act, what kind of character it is. You were in your great your your great-grandfather's grandfather also. But it was not, it was not absolute till you came on the scene. When you came on the scene, it was manifested. And then he said in Satan's Eden, "Therefore, that was God's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship. When I was in my father, I knew nothing about it. But when I became his son and was born of him, I was a I was an attribute, a part of my father, and you are a part of your father." And as children of God, we are a part of God's attributes that was in him, made flesh like he was made flesh, so we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the earth. And that was God's purpose at the beginning. &gt;&gt; You see, it has to come, the seed has to come a full cycle because that was God's purpose at the beginning. And so when a seed of wheat, as I said a moment ago, is buried in the earth, uh that's part of God's program. But that is not his purpose for that seed. That purpose, the purpose for that seed is so that it will be seed once again. &gt;&gt; And the seed is not air with the shock. Uh just bear with me as I go through two or three more of these quotes. He said, "A stock is not the grain. Neither is the tossel the grain. Neither is the shock the grain, though each each time it matures, it looks more like the grain. The stalk doesn't look like the grain." Then when then what comes forth? The tassel, a little bulb, it looks more like the grain than the blade does. What comes forth next? The shock. It holds the grain and it matures the grain. Said, "Now look back there at the promise that God made to Abraham of thy seed." God said to Abraham, "Thy seed, speaking spiritually." He says, "Any of us know that he was speaking of Christ, not Isaac, through his faith seed. Thy seed shall inherit," you see the promise. and in leadership says the first corn of wheat, the bridegroom, I read these different ones because there's a different something's implied in each of the each of these quotes. The first corn of wheat, the bridegroom, had to fall into the earth in order to rise again. So did the first bride that was born at Pentecost and had to go through the dark ages like any other seed be buried. They had to die. they must do it. But it started sprouting again in Luther in the first reformation. It didn't look like the seed that went in, but it was the light of that day. And the the stalk then went out into the tassel Wesley and from the tsel it went into Pentecost, the shock. See, it's more more and more like the seed. But then when Luke 17:30 came on the scene, &gt;&gt; that looked just like the seed, &gt;&gt; that acted just like the seed, that did just like what the seed did. And furthermore, I'll say it tasted &gt;&gt; the same as the original seed. When I read the word of God and I taste of Christ by revelation by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit reveals what the messenger has spoken, it tastes exactly the same. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It tastes the same. It looks the same because it is the same. &gt;&gt; The life of the grain finally comes up. The Bible says in Mark 4:28, "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself, of herself. First the blade, then the ear, and after that the full corn of the ear." So although the appearance changes from one form to another, yet the life the life itself is an absolute life. Although the appearance changes, the life is an absolute life, but you don't see it in its absolute form. The manifestation may not yet be in its absolute or mature condition. I'm laying all this foundation for a very specific purpose and and it's it's a very very broad subject. The blade is a manifestation of the life. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; but it's not the life &gt;&gt; in its absolute form. We can have all kinds of manifestations and it is a manifestation of the life but it is yet not the absolute &gt;&gt; because uh there are so many things that we as even as believers can experience within the realm and I'm now just touching on another subject I want to come to massive subject I'm still struggling ling to get around it. But there's so much so much of of of our entire generation is just literally permeated with a part of our life which is come from this second realm. We feel things, our emotions, our conscience and our memory and all of those things. So much of it comes from that. If if we if we feel good after a service that oh we're really happy or something else then we think we had a tremendous service. It might be a service where you didn't feel anything was your best service &gt;&gt; because God is not necessarily working in that realm. so much of it and I can I can take you which I I just have to be careful now and draw back but I can tell you that this entire age and we can we can say much of it actually came from the whole Hollywood entertainment thing &gt;&gt; you know we adapt things we we hear it and we see others do it and so we do it and uh and uh uh but it's not necessarily something that is coming from the absolute life I better leave that there. &gt;&gt; And so we don't want to live at that level. &gt;&gt; There's another level. &gt;&gt; It's a deep deep thing that God God just does it. When a man and a woman does business with God, it's something that is a transformation that takes place inside. &gt;&gt; And we're we're new creatures in Christ Jesus. And it doesn't depend on if we feel good, we don't feel good, things go well, they don't go well. Has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; It is a it's a fact that uh that God and man have become one. &gt;&gt; So he said again, the stock is not the grain, neither is the tel the grain. See, it's manifestations, but it's not the grain. If you're spiritual, you'll just get where I'm going. The grain, though, each time it matures, it looks more like the grain. I speak of Christ. Brother Brandon was speaking of Christ and the infallibility of God's word. Said, "Look at Jesus to identify himself as the stone that would never let the promise slip. this stone that would anchor forever and forever God's coveted and promised people. He said, "As long as I am in Christ Jesus, I'm anchored." That's why he's saying the anchor holds. As long as I am in Christ Jesus, as long as I am in the absolute, &gt;&gt; not as long as I'm in some manifestation of the absolute, well, things are going fine. I feel good. My spirits are high. I'm thinking positive. Uh, this has happened. Circumstances are okay. That has nothing to do, &gt;&gt; nothing to do with what I'm talking about. Really, nothing to do with the Bible. &gt;&gt; When God does a work in an individual's life, it's an eternal work. &gt;&gt; The economy isn't going to change it. &gt;&gt; My circumstances aren't going to change it. Nothing can change it. My age doesn't change it. Whether I'm young and I'm strong or whether we're old and feeble or whether we're sick or whether we're healthy, that has nothing to do with what God has done in an individual's life. &gt;&gt; We may have these other things, all of these things. And listen, friends, you know as well as I do, they're passing away. &gt;&gt; It's all passing away. There will be a day that this this building you're sitting in, which we've had glorious times in, it will be nothing but dust and ashes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; These bodies that you are sitting in today are going to be a teaspoon of ashes. Unless it's a change by a by a rapture act, &gt;&gt; it's all passing. &gt;&gt; You know, we want to we want to we want to come to that reality and live in that reality. You have this body for one purpose and that is that so that God can move and push through that that absolute life in you and to bring us to a manifestation that's just like the seed because we become that. &gt;&gt; And Satan is working over time to see that it doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; You must not let the things of this life or of this world affect it in any way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And how can I be sure that I won't affect it? Well, that's what the purpose of this service today is. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet says, "As long as I'm in Christ," he said he he was that anchor place where Jacob's ladder where the promised seed would be. He said he was God's eternal promised seed. He was that sure stone, the perfect foundation that God's truth would be anchored in and all the devils of hell and anything else could never move it. So while the life is moving up through the seed he said in the fundamental foundation he said Adam never had to be sick. He never had to die. He never had to worry. He never had a headache. He never had a fear. Now, I know I've just gone through the one and a half sentences, and I know I've covered everybody in this congregation. He just climbed up into the arms of father and just like a child, everything was his. And whatever he asked, why he just got it? Everything obeyed him because he was God's child. and the child is the heir of all things. Now, I'd like to know if the next few words are absolute. Now, when man fell, when man fell, he lost this. &gt;&gt; And now what he lost in the fall, Christ came as a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Are we still absolute? Is it still an absolute? &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed for us? He gave us everlasting life. He brought us back to eternal fellowship and relationship to God, to be his sons and daughters again, to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall." I say that's the absolute speaking. say the absolute is here. &gt;&gt; In the message absolute, brother Brandham refers to a number of absolutes. One, he says a signal light is an absolute whether it's green or whether it's red. &gt;&gt; And when that light turns red, it means you must stop. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. You need to stop. Not creep forward, but stop. And when it turns red, you can go or green rather. You can go. &gt;&gt; And that's an absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's uh when it changes a person is free by law &gt;&gt; to do it. He said the ship has a anchor and the anchor is an absolute. He says when and when difficulties arise like we have now. He said it is an anchor. It's something that holds holds you something that you're tied to. It's a promise that we have been tied to the word of God. And it's just like the anchor is the absolute to the ship in a time of storm. So we have an anchor and the anchor must be to a promise. &gt;&gt; It must be to this is what you said. &gt;&gt; This is what has been spoken. He says, "A umpire in a ball game is an absolute." There's an absolute in a ball game. It's an umpire. Sometimes we don't like his decision either. And this is very very important. Sometimes we don't like the decision of the empire. Why wouldn't we like it? Because we'd say, "I don't think it was a strike." &gt;&gt; How do you call that? That didn't even go across the plate. Well, that's the way you saw it. &gt;&gt; But one is an absolute. And he says, "That's an absolute to the ball game. But it's that way. Anyhow, the umpire his decision is the final word. And then he one more which I want to refer to because he had quite a number of them. But one is the Supreme Court. He says our Supreme Court is an absolute. It's an absolute. It's the final end of all arguments in this nation. their decision is an absolute in our Supreme Court. He said, "That's right. I Oh, I know sometimes we don't like it." So, he's coming to the same thing again. Sometimes we don't like it, but it's an absolute anyhow. Yes, sir. And then I want to bring it the third thought. He said, "What if we didn't have that? Then what? What if we didn't have the Supreme Court? Then what?" Well, we would be back to the time the time of the judges when everybody did what was right in their own mind. That's the way I see it. &gt;&gt; Well, and you have a right to that. And unfortunately the prophet speaks very very clearly in the church ages that Leodysa the outstanding feature of Leodysia was it was an age of the people's rights. &gt;&gt; This is a very sensitive subject because you have been reared in a whole age when the entire atmosphere is the people's rights. That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; The children have rights. &gt;&gt; Women have rights. And in fact, in some ways, we're thankful for that. We're happy that people have rights because on the one hand the rights have been established by this nation of freedom for our protection. But yet on the other hand those freedoms can extend until they turn around and sting us &gt;&gt; and go and go contrary. While I may not have the ability to describe this the way I would like to, but these rights of the land of America, we say North America, our countries and and the western world have rights and they believe in freedom. But I noticed that these nations that had, for example, communism in them and were held under a stern dictatorship and took all the rights away from the people. I I find it's it's it's it's a well-known fact that they had a whole lot less immorality. &gt;&gt; This congregation should have said, "I would think you're more intelligent than that." &gt;&gt; Had a whole lot more a whole lot more a whole lot less immorality &gt;&gt; until Cruchef, I believe it was, refused to go to a can can show in America cuz he didn't want to see the immorality. &gt;&gt; Freedom. Freedom can if it's allowed to go beyond its benefit becomes becomes a a deterrent. It becomes a a detriment, &gt;&gt; not a not a benefit. &gt;&gt; Is it correct? Amen. &gt;&gt; Moscow is one of the most dangerous cities in the world today and it's filled with and and and controlled they say by mafia &gt;&gt; because the freedoms have come and it has become a violent place &gt;&gt; but it was not that way under communism. So, so now here is the uh paradox that the freedom has breeded all of this sin and corruption and violence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now we have people's rights, individual rights. So we have the rights of uh the rights of of the young people, the rights of children and the rights are put in place so that a child doesn't need to be abused physically and then that protection which is there for their protection. I speak in the presence of men who are enforcers of the law. So I want to try to be as accurate as possible. So it's there for their protection. But then on the other hand, a child, a young person may say, uh, my parents put too much restriction on me. They put too much restraint on me. and they start involving the authorities and it turns to their damage and to their detriment and begins to tear apart a family that is supposed to protect. &gt;&gt; Isn't that so? &gt;&gt; We have very very stringent laws and regulations for the protection of women and wives and I'm thankful we have that. Some have been terribly abused and it's a big thing today. But still that very that very segment of the laws and the regulations if it's used improperly or with an ill it can actually be the very instrument that divides. I've had situations where husbands didn't want wives to leave, but the very law that protect them is the one that sent them away and protected them to go away. I've had I've been involved where I sat across from a a leading leading uh attorney in the city of Vancouver. I said, "This man does not want this home to be broken. This man will do anything in his power. This is a fine husband, a man of integrity, and he doesn't want to lose the family. This man, this attorney, lawyer, reached around and pulled two huge volumes out of his wall cabinet, threw one down, grabbed the other one, threw one down, and said, "These two comprise the laws of British Columbia, and there is not, thank your government," he said. There is not one paragraph in these laws, two volumes like this, not one paragraph that is given on what the husband is wanting to do to hold the family together. And I was stunned to silence. I stood and looked at those two volumes. He said, "Just thank your government." He said, "There's not one law." So now we have what could we say? What am I speaking about? That was the rights of a wife, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Two huge volumes, but there was nothing in there to speak of the rights of the husband who wanted to keep it together. &gt;&gt; That was a woman's rights. And it's unfortunate that we are living in such an age where the criminals have rights. And you know as well as yourself, I might as well say it. I'm saying it publicly. &gt;&gt; In some cases, the criminal has more rights than the victim. &gt;&gt; Victims suffer incredibly, &gt;&gt; but there doesn't seem to be a voice for them. Why? I'll say why in two words. Satan's Eden. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you could raise up an Abraham Lincoln and George Washington in every county and you'll never turn it around. &gt;&gt; You could raise up the great men of the past and they will not turn it around because this is what has been foretold in the scripture. This is the way it's going. This is the way it is. But we as believers want to make sure we're not tainted &gt;&gt; by that. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be in that mentality. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to find the source of our wisdom from an absolute life. &gt;&gt; Even in the last I thank you for your prayers. I thank you for your time. We took some time of rest much much needed rest. But I spent a lot of time meditating and pondering and I just determined the same oldfashioned thought that comes to my mind so very very many times. I don't feel a part of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This world has become an unwelcome place. Increasingly an unwelcome place. I don't think like them. &gt;&gt; This Bible isn't written by them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you want a solution, it can only come from the absolute life. &gt;&gt; And this is what happened. I thought of this world in a in in a such a lost condition and keeping this uh uh Christmas season which is just wrong time of the year and everything else. We understand that. We're not going to get into that. But I thought how many people and I trust that the believers can realize that we are they're remembering a time that's long past says and you shall bring forth a son and his name will be called Jesus. What a marvelous thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've waited all these centuries and finally the life and that's why John said the life was manifested &gt;&gt; and we saw it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we handled it &gt;&gt; how marvelous it is in the springtime when the plants start to come forth. But oh, we wait. We wait till the blossom comes and the and the bloom comes out and and the and we see the flower and all of its radiance and its glory and its color and its shape. Finally, the life has been manifested &gt;&gt; and it's absolute. &gt;&gt; What was in the seed is now manifested. &gt;&gt; We have an absolute. So the Supreme Court's an absolute for the nation. What if we didn't have that? Well, then you would have, as I said, it was in the days of of the of the judges. Caleb's nephew was a judge. Uh uh another one, Yer, he was a judge of Israel. Jeffa judged Israel for six years. Deborah was a prophetess. Elon judged for 10 years. And Samson judged Israel for 20 years. And here's what brother Brandham said about this time. Each one has his own absolute. It's just like it was in the days of the judges. Every man done what was right in his own sight. In the days of judges, every man had his own absolute. Every man had his own absolute. He did just what he wanted to do and that's the way it is. Now, &gt;&gt; I want to just stop there a moment. Here's brother Brandon preaching. You know, brother Brandon preached to several hundred thousand in Durban. Several hundred thousand people actually heard him, but I don't know what that message was that never caught me. He preached in Bombay manifestations. Brother Sydney Jackson said, "Brother Brandon prayed a mass prayer and there was miracles taking place till 2 and 3 in the morning." Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that never caught me. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Bombay. They started to tear the clothes off. Brother Brandham even told me tried to tear pieces off his pants, but that never caught me. Was it a manifestation of the life? Absolutely. But it didn't catch me. I've heard probably several thousands of messages in my lifetime from my childhood till now. I've heard thousands of messages by men, good men. I'm sad to say, I'm really sad to say I heard perhaps 30 or 40 of brother Brandham's in life and I couldn't remember what he said. I probably can remember. You might think what a memory you have. I might be able to remember 10 messages &gt;&gt; that I've heard men preach &gt;&gt; because it never got me. But the message when when the life became manifested and I I saw a life. I see a life. You know, you read a book. I don't just read a book. I see a life. &gt;&gt; I handle the life. &gt;&gt; I feel the life. I feel the throb of the life. It's not a bunch of intellectual stuff to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not something I I'm I find so many that try to find it to see if it fits with what they think. You're in the wrong &gt;&gt; You're in the wrong channel. We're not here to find out if it if what the prophet said fits with what we already think because you're trying to merge the absolute with your reasoning. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. Sorry folks. Doesn't work where you can't you can't you can't blend uh you can't blend the absolute life with some leodysian upbringing. And we've all been brought up in this whole atmosphere. It isn't as though we haven't been tainted. That's why we need to be in the house of God. And let our minds be washed &gt;&gt; from the whole atmosphere of this generation. Let it come across. Let it sting us if it needs to. &gt;&gt; Let it correct us. Say, "Oh God, here I am. &gt;&gt; Cleanse me." Amen. &gt;&gt; If you come here for any other purpose, if you come here because it's a, you know, this Christmas season or a holiday season or whatever more, you're here for the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; If you're here just because you know your friend is here or your parents are here, whatever more, I won't say it's the wrong reason. I'm glad you're here, but you really need to open your heart and say, "Oh, God, wash me from the whole thought of this generation, from the whole atmosphere of it." because it's so contrary to your plan, your program. &gt;&gt; Everybody had their own way of thinking. Brother Brandham said about the spirit of Leo Dea. Now, he says the name Leodya, I I hope you understand. And I'm taking my time and doing it a little different than I normally do. But he said the name Leodysia, the people's rights or justice for the peoples. He said, "Was there ever an age like the 20th century church age that has been that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially?" When the ancients called Leodysia the metropolis, it was looking forward to the one world government that we are now setting up. &gt;&gt; I believe that's an absolute statement. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was saying that long before perhaps they might have just been thinking about this in their bed chamber, but God made it known to a people who would receive it as God's word. He made it known to us. They were setting it up. They were thinking about it back then. They were scheming it back then. We see it happening right now. &gt;&gt; All these conferences which are happening on a regular base. I don't even pay any attention to them. The G7s or the G8s or whatever more, they're going to do what they're going to do. &gt;&gt; They're going to do what God has ordained them to do. &gt;&gt; But let us not as the bride of Jesus Christ get caught in their trap. &gt;&gt; It's not a good thing that's going to happen. that they're setting up right now. As we think of that city being the location of a great church council, we see foreshadowed the ecumenical move taking place today wherein very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together. Indeed, the church and state, religion and politics are coming together. The tears are being bound and the wheat will soon be ready for the corner. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, don't don't anybody here think, "Oh, I know exactly where we're at." You haven't got a clue where we're at. &gt;&gt; You may just feel things moving in a certain direction, but on down the road you find out what what you had determined today wasn't it. We don't want to be there. &gt;&gt; You don't want to say, "Well, I have a right to figure out just exactly where we are." You don't know exactly where we are. I don't know where we are. I do know one thing that the absolute has been manifested and the word has been spoken and it is unfolding and all I want to do I want to be part of the unfolding. &gt;&gt; So even if we take one little step just one little step and another little step we're moving the right direction. That's the main thing. And then he went on to say the city it was a city of earthquakes. Leodia such earthquakes has finally destroyed it. This age will end in God shaking the whole world that has gone off to make love with the old harlot. Oh, &gt;&gt; what powerful words. We have all kinds of predictions in these next few days. There'll be all kinds of predictions of what the future holds. And when we read last year's predictions, &gt;&gt; yeah, uh you'll see how many of them &gt;&gt; were off base. And what the world considers as great, it's not very great. The city was rich and endowed by the wealthy. It was full of culture and science abounded. How like today the churches are rich and the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead. That's why I say don't want to slip into cold dead formal religion. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I far sooner have somebody from the depths of their soul give glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't leave it to the next person to pray for you. When we stand to pray, there ought to be some words in your mouth. &gt;&gt; There ought to be something coming out of your heart saying, "God, I have a desire. I don't care how simple the prayer is, but the whole congregation should be in prayer." I hope I'm not preaching this just for exercise. The whole congregation should be in prayer. Don't do it just because uh we're do it one time, but we ought to hear the word. The absolute has spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "And the worship was beautiful, but cold and dead. Culture and education had taken the place of the spirit-given word. And faith has has been superseded by science." Faith has been superseded by science. That's why we don't see as much as we see. You go to some places and they don't have all the scientific advancement. They don't have everything that perhaps we have medically speaking. And not that we're opposed to that. Thank God for it. If I wasn't well, I'd probably want to go and see what a doctor would have to say about it because I've been able to be uh great help. And and so, Brother Brandham had a wonderful balance about that. But on the other hand, God begins just where man can't go any further. &gt;&gt; That's just where God begins. You may be here and you're beyond or a doctor can't find out and you don't have an answer for it, then we have a place. &gt;&gt; We have an absolute life. an absolute and all the attributes of him are available and can be accessed by the believer. And he says that the culture and education have given place to the spirit given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism. He says, "In every attribute, listen to this statement now. In every attribute, ancient Leodysia is found reborn in the 20th century." And we're in the 21st century. Every attribute. You hear me? &gt;&gt; Every attribute of ancient Leodysa has been reborn. And you have to cope with it. You have to deal with it. There isn't a person in under the sound of my voice that is exempt or immune from the forces of Leodya. We're we're we're not of that. We haven't been born of that. But I can tell you that Satan in Satan's Eden, listen to me now. In Satan's Eden, Satan who who the prophet says is a slicker. He's don't try to tackle him on the word. He knows more about the word than you do. He doesn't have revelation, but he just knows it intellectually. He's He's got all of those things at at at his his access. Don't forget, he was a fallen angel. He knows all about worship. &gt;&gt; He knows all about worship. And he has he has cultiv cultivated and designed a generation to be this one which also the prophet says is the most deceitful of all the most deceiving of all generations. And so Satan has linked together Leodysa and the attributes of Leodysa to make the most deceiving age &gt;&gt; possible. And that's the age that we're in. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying all of this to say, you might say, well, my what a service, uh, Brother Biscol, that you're speaking this morning, and it's it's for a it's for a good purpose. And that purpose is there's only one way. There's only I'm absolutely convinced there's only one way for a believer to escape the effects of this generation and that is by the absolute life that was manifested again in this day and came to us in the form of a message. &gt;&gt; And the end time message still meets end time conditions. &gt;&gt; There's end time more end time conditions than we could ever ever put down in paper. uh we couldn't be able to write and describe it adequately but the end time message has to meet the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that there are situations which you have faced which you have gone through and it looks as though you come to an absolute impass. It seems like there's no answer. And I can say, and you can repeat, well, the end time message meets the end time conditions. And maybe some say here, well, you know, I I tried to do that. I tried to believe that. And and uh nothing happened. What do we do then? Well, I know only one thing to do. Just feel feel the tug and make sure that the anchors in a promise &gt;&gt; and let the let the winds rage. Let the impossibilities come and let everything dash away. But I have an anchor. &gt;&gt; When that wave comes, I feel I feel that anchor. Brother Ernie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I would sooner die. I'd sooner pass off the scene feeling my anchor chain than let it be affected or something to come out of my mouth that that that denied the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Making a register. &gt;&gt; Can I go a few more minutes, please? I can go back in the scripture talking about what the people thought was right. And uh there was a time when Moses, he sent out the spies. This is well known to you. Moses sent out the spies to spy out the land and to come back with the report and find out about the people and find out about the cities. And he gave them specific things that they should come back. And they came back and they gave an evil report. The Bible says, "And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and p possess it, for we are well able to overcome it." And uh and the men that went up with him said, "We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we." And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched uh unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. And there we saw the giants and the sons of Anch which came the giants. And we were we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and we were and so were we in their sight. Now this happened to be they were they were they were stretching and reaching uh their mandate far beyond what Moses told them to do. Moses didn't tell them well you go there and when you see the people tell us how you felt when you saw them. &gt;&gt; Tell us how you think they looked upon you. He didn't ask him to do that. He said, "Do this, this, and this." But they came back and they added a whole lot more to it and said, "Well, this is how we feel." And and and so I want you to notice then and all the congregation. Look at the effect of this. Now, &gt;&gt; it's amazing what a few words &gt;&gt; my wife and I, you don't mind, just a little personal thing. Our dishwasher just ground to a halt. Quit. He says, "Oh, it's not pumping the water out." I said, "There'll be nothing wrong." I said, "You know, just push that. We're going to run through a cycle all the rest of it." And I had the answer. We're going to scrape all this water out. So, we got rid of all the water and just start the thing up again. So, she hits the button and we wait and it goes through the whole cycle. We go there. There's all that water laying in the bottom again. So, you know what you do? You call the right man. So, we called the repair man. Says, "Uh, how long have you had it?" "Oh, we've had it about 18 years." He said, "Forget it. It's not worth it." Said, "By the time I get there and I buy any parts and fix that thing," he said, "It's better you just go and buy a new one." And he said, "It won't be worth it." So, we we go looking for dishwashers. And we look at this one and now there's more makes and more models and more buttons and more stuff and more this and more of that and this one has a fan and this one has a dryer and this one has that and I just stand back and let my wife absorb it. I think that's absolute, isn't it? That women are made to absorb those kind of things, Gary. So I try to understand it and my but she she's you know she knows what she wants. So this is better. That is better. That's better. So we go to another store. Let's go to this store. Let's go to that store. We go another store. And up comes another salesperson. And uh do you handle this mate? Cuz she kind of focused on one said I think that I really like the you know what it has and it has just certain uh things that that that really are good for me. So So we focused on one. We said that's the one. So we go to another store and a lady comes up and said, "Well, did you ever hear of this make?" Oh, yeah. She said, "We used to handle it." Used to. Why don't you handle it now? Said, "I sold one. Sold it to a plumber and he brought it back. You got it. Yeah, you got it. We didn't buy it. We didn't buy it." And we got out in the truck and driving down the road and I said, she said, 'You know, it's amazing how I feel so different about that one now. I said, "Isn't that incredible that just a little sentence from a woman that we don't know? Well, we don't know her at all. And yet that sentence is locked in our minds and has made us complete feel completely different about that thing and we didn't buy it. And I I just took off from that. I said, you know, isn't it amazing how you can hear something about somebody &gt;&gt; and it may not be right. &gt;&gt; It may not even be true. Right? &gt;&gt; And you may find out later that it wasn't true, &gt;&gt; but it still leaves a shadow. &gt;&gt; What a curse. &gt;&gt; But we have rights. We can say what we want. &gt;&gt; This is our right to express ourselves. We're in the land of the free. I was reading what some men and and I I don't know. Everything's a blog today. I think it's a good word, blog. I don't know where the word come from, but anyway, everybody's got a blog. And I I go on to search out something and searching out something about the message that end up with somebody's blog about brother Brandham. So, you said it right. He's wrong on the Trinity and he's wrong on this and he's wrong on the serpent seat and all this and and not one piece of scripture, not one thing from the absolute, but everybody has a right to say what they want to say and to spew all across the world and across the nation and across people. I say, you know what? It's a it's a marvelous miracle that anybody comes to the message &gt;&gt; through all this stuff through all this garbage and here out of all of this trash here comes beautiful lives just blossoming out. &gt;&gt; I think glory to God. I look upon this congregation say how in the world did you even get here? &gt;&gt; I've had people even come to me and say I found out so much bad things about brother Brandham. I find out I I I had to find out there must be something about him &gt;&gt; or there wouldn't be people so opposed to it. &gt;&gt; But everybody has a right say what they want, feel what they want. And it's just amazing. I didn't say this merely to be humorous, but I say this to be truthful. We need to be very careful. I think silence is a bliss. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep what you think about somebody else to yourself. &gt;&gt; Make that make that one of your laws within yourself. &gt;&gt; I would sooner have someone non-communicative than someone say the wrong thing &gt;&gt; because it affects you. &gt;&gt; It affects you. In fact is I'm such a believer in that that when I hear things that I even know has an element of truth, I don't respond. &gt;&gt; I just listen. Mhm. Okay. Well, you don't have the whole story. That might be what I say because uh it's not going to do any good. just not going to do any good. &gt;&gt; But we have rights. We have rights. &gt;&gt; And that that right to express, you know, and say whatever you want to say and spew it to wherever you want to spew it, it's a bad one. &gt;&gt; It's not a good one. &gt;&gt; It doesn't benefit the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; The absolute speaks. says, "Whatsoever things are lovely, &gt;&gt; whatsoever things are of a good report." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are true, a lot of things are true, but they're not lovely. &gt;&gt; A lot of things are true are not of a good report. &gt;&gt; But whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of a good report, think on these things. That's absolute life. &gt;&gt; Good. Did Jesus major on the weaknesses of his disciples? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did they have them? They all had them. &gt;&gt; And who better could have said it &gt;&gt; because what he would have said would have been exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; But you know what? It wasn't all lovely. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus didn't speak it. I'm just going to take a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; So all the congregation at the word of these spies, they lifted up their voice and they cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. Oh my, what an effect this had. Amen. &gt;&gt; What an effect. So now they were anticipating something. Okay, I'll say it. Said, "Bring it down. Bring it home, Brother Ed." Okay, here we are all in anticipation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; I am. Each year that goes by with me, I say, "Oh, God." I think about how Brother Brandham anticipated and desired it and how Brother Daddy Dao and I sat with Sister Glattis Dao and how they desired how she desired the rapture, the change of the body. And I think of all of those ones and then, you know, I can get the thought, well, why should I think that I'm going to make it? Well, I I have a promise. And I'll tell you what, it's not just a it's not just a wishful thought. Uh I I know there are some things that I know very purposefully and I know I know that the message came to prepare people to prepare people for that. &gt;&gt; I know that's why it came and so I'm living in the midst of that message and I can I have every right this is where my rights are. I have my right to anchor my faith into that promise. And if I go by the way of the grave, I go by the grave way of the grave with my anchor in that promise that I am living in the era. I'm living under a message. I'm living under a messenger's announcement. And I have a right to have my anchor there. &gt;&gt; You have a right to have your anchor there. And then things may come, winds may come, all kinds of difficulties may come that will test that. And then you begin to think, "Oh, maybe I can't go in right now." Or or or or something's happening that's going sideways. That is when a person has to be especially careful. Especially careful. I'm speaking like a daddy now. I've I've I've witnessed parents and they oh they were so so joyous, so fulfilled when they had their little family around them and their children were all just in the house of God. And then as time went on, they began to exercise their own rights. And now the son is not sitting there with the dad anymore. And the daughter is not sitting with her mom anymore. And the family unit looks completely different. Okay, maybe you can't change that. You can't physically lay hold of them. You can't do what in your heart you'd like to do to set them there and say, "Listen, you're gonna you're going to come to church because they have their rights to express who they are and be who they are, be do what they want to do." But what should that do to your anchor? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, nothing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; It should not cause your faith to Wayne. It should not cause your enthusiasm to die. It should not cause your flame to become dim. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ought to come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be just as fervent as you ever were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and envision them to be sitting right there beside you. Let your faith reach into the other channel and see them on the other side. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just had a few words with brother Gary. Brother Gary, excuse me, but I appreciate it. And we got talking about I said, "How's your mom and dad?" Well, this is happening. That's happening. But he says, "I know they're going to be there." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's the anchor, brother Gary. &gt;&gt; That's the I see them on the other side because he said it. &gt;&gt; He told me to ask it. He told me to ask largely. He told me to ask and not doubt and I've asked and I'm believing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What's wrong to believe for the impossible? [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget brother Andrew from South Africa was standing here. One of our colored brothers and he stood in the church. I think maybe in the log church. It's amazing. I don't know what he preached on. I can't remember the service at all. But I know one thing he said. He said, "I'm not going to die." And the whole congregation just he felt it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't don't take that away from me. &gt;&gt; That's my faith. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm believing. Don't take it away from me." I said, "God bless you, Brother Andrew. I'm not going to take that away from you. You have every right to say that because your anchor's in the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The absolute life has come. &gt;&gt; And I'll say we say Luke 17:30 and the revelation of the son of man and all these things. I want to put it in another context this morning as I just try to wind up. That was an absolute life. &gt;&gt; People don't like the absolute part of it, but I love the absolute part of it because what would we do without it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Where would we be without it? &gt;&gt; We'd be subjected to everybody's thoughts. &gt;&gt; I have advice all the time. Say, "Well, you need to do this. You need to do that." If I were to ask them for a scripture or something from the absolute, where's your absolute? &gt;&gt; They never thought of an absolute. It's just the way I see it. Quite frankly, I'm not interested how you say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not even interested how I see it. &gt;&gt; I need to say it from the absolute. &gt;&gt; And on the other hand, it's unfortunate, but there'll be times that I have read expressly what the messenger has said to me. It's an absolute for this generation. &gt;&gt; And have people even in this congregation claiming to be believers look at it and doesn't mean anything to them. So, they don't do it or they won't even believe that we ought to do it. And I needed to say today the absolute we have an absolute for the home. &gt;&gt; And I don't care. You say, "Well, this happens, that happens, this that husband and this wife and that thing and the other thing is fine." All right, folks. And many of you have come from homes, but there's an absolute that's been revealed for the structure of a home. And you husbands are heads of home. And you are responsible to lead a spiritual life that your children and your wife can honor and and have have faith and confidence in. And wives likewise have a responsibility by the absolute to be obedient women to and follow their husbands as they follow the Lord. I mean the spirit, we don't want the spirit of this age to afflict &gt;&gt; our sisters. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible spirit. &gt;&gt; I lived in my short life, you know, I was away here could get some of the CNN news and this whole e economic meltdown and things and things were going on and it was a startling thing. Forgive me for this, but I saw quite a bit of newscasts and just trying to keep a breast of what was happening. And you know, all the anchor the anchor almost all the anchor news people are women. &gt;&gt; I said, why aren't they home baking cookies? and the world economics and the anchor on world economics were women. I tell you what friends, you might say and don't think for a moment what's wrong with that. That's very wrong. &gt;&gt; That's completely backwards. &gt;&gt; That's completely backwards. &gt;&gt; That's why the world is in the state that it's in. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And look what brother Brandham said about women police. &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, you have to accept that &gt;&gt; because it's a part of our rights. &gt;&gt; But it's still wrong according to the absolute. &gt;&gt; It just goes completely sideways. But we have we have an order. There is an order &gt;&gt; for a home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's an order for home. And there's no you saying, "Well, what about this or what about that or what about what I've experienced?" I would just say to you, let your anchor, let your anchor be hooked to the promise. Make sure that it's the promise. You young people and children. Oh, listen. I'm not interested what what our nation says your rights are. I'm interested what this says your rights are. And your rights are to honor your father and your mother and listen to them that are godly. And if you have an unsaved father or mother, you pray for them or maybe both of them. I've had lots come to the me. I looked at some pictures of our early days in the early congregation and I can tell you that there were young young men and young women that came to the knowledge of the message and lived so so fervently for Christ. When I when I see those brothers from China, it it's it's not because everything is going great for them. Things may be going completely reverse for them. may be going completely wrong for them, but they're they're out there doing what they can, getting the message out to the people that they're able to get them out to. And I honor that and I respect that. And here in this congregation, we have, you know, this absolute life. Don't don't worry with what I'm saying. This absolute life covers every part &gt;&gt; of every person's life that's in this building. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Every part of our life. It covers every area of our circumstances, whatever they might be. &gt;&gt; And there isn't anyone that has the answer for absolutely everything. There isn't. But the absolute life, even if it Oh, I I I I have to take a few minutes. Even when brother Brandham refers to Mary calling Jesus for her brother Lazarus who was dying and Jesus didn't come, didn't come. They didn't understand that &gt;&gt; and they could have lost confidence in him. Your friend is sick and the master himself does not come. I can assure you if I did that be a lot of folks here really think bad say of when if I ever needed my pastor to come it was now and he didn't come I only put it in that you might say well you're not Jesus Christ and I can say well that's that's correct Jesus knew what he was going to do &gt;&gt; but yet the the feeling of the people didn't change. &gt;&gt; They had a right to feel disappointed. But then Jesus came too late. He's been dead now. And brother Brandham says about he said that she had an Martha had an absolute in him. Even though he's gone, but I know &gt;&gt; whatever you ask She had an absolute. Whatever you ask, God will do it. See, she had an absolute. Even though she didn't know how it was going to happen, &gt;&gt; she didn't know when it was going to happen, but she knew that he was the resurrection and the life. She had an absolute. And that is something that we were I I'm thinking about this new year, friends. Lay aside your own thoughts, your own opinions. Lay that all aside. And especially, I plead with you. Lay aside your own reasonings. And you say, "Okay, now you've told us what to do on that side. What would you recommend we do?" I recommend I recommend with an unqualified statement, absorb yourself in the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just become absorbed with the message. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you now I'm I'm giving you my own personal. I spend a lot of time in the message and I s sometimes sit there and I ask myself now am I reading this because I know I have to study for a message? Am I reading this because I know am I reading these quotes because I need a subject? This will make a great sermon, but is this why I'm reading these quotes? Because that would be the wrong purpose. Sometimes I say, "No, I'm reading these quotes." You say, "Do you talk to yourself?" Yeah, I talk to myself all the time. Why are you reading these quotes? Well, I'm reading these quotes because I want to say I want to see what he said about this. And that's a good reason. I'm reading these quotes because I'm in a certain situation. I want to find out did brother Brandham say anything about this situation. I want to say how he approached it. And sometimes I can't find anything that he said about a specific thing. Maybe I'm going through something or I'm feeling something. I don't find anything exactly like that. Then then okay, what do you do? You feel the tug of the anchor. Say, are you at home in this world? No. Do I like the world's answers? Not a bit. I don't feel a part of the world at all. I Okay, where what am I anchored to? Where's that anchor chain? Give it a good tug. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And I find it's I find it's anchored to a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know that I know that this message dealt with every situation. I may not know the answer. I may not find exactly what the answer is, but I know that the I can say this, the absolute has come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And whatever there is in this coming year, the absolute has the absolute life has been fully manifested. &gt;&gt; I've seen it. &gt;&gt; We've heard it. &gt;&gt; We've tasted of it &gt;&gt; of the word of life. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. I just want to I I just want to take about four or five minutes and then I want to close. For you that are Canadians, I'm I'm just saying it this way because there's a word I want to use that's not maybe as common uh to to other people from other nations. And the word is repatriate. Repatriate is to bring back. And the actual meaning of repatriate is this. To send somebody back to his or her country of birth, the country of which he or she is a citizen or the country from which he or she arrived. Israel happens to be a nation that has since the second world war has really exercised uh the principle of repatriation and that is Jews that have never been in Israel. They may have never been there, but they're in Europe. They're in Russia, they're in United States, and they've had a very, very high rate of success even even up till recently to repatriate their citizens back to Israel, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And part of the program is they pay everything. We pay it because you're a citizen. Even though you've never been here, you are in another country. You've been raised under another under a whole another constitution, but you are a citizen of this country. &gt;&gt; Right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to ever forget &gt;&gt; whatever you have lived, whatever circumstances you find yourself in, however you've been raised, whatever your background is, I can say to you, though you came maybe from Africa, South Africa, Europe or England or Germany or wherever you've come from, God has repatri repatriated you. And we had in a Canadian constitution. Our constitution because we came under the British Commonwealth. Our constitution was in England. The constitution of this nation was in England. And one of our prime ministers, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. It seemed that it he he became obsessed that they needed to whether it was his French background or what it was but he was obsessed that that constitution needs to be here needs to be back in this country. We need to be uh we need to have a degree of independence that it doesn't give us when this constitution our constitution for Canada rests over in England. We need to we need to separate. We need to cut this umbilical cord and we need to become a nation of our own. And it was a huge huge something that will be forever remembered as long as time goes on in the Canadian history when and they called it when our constitution was repatri repatriated from England and brought over here. And that was a that was a huge thing. and every Canadian citizen was uh you know uh understood it in in in their own unique way I I guess I would say but now we have a the spiritual aspect of it and this uh uh I'm coming to the close of my service but when God decided to send not Malachi 3 but Malachi 4 he was repatriate repatriating ing the citizens. &gt;&gt; You've never been to the other side. &gt;&gt; You haven't seen it. You haven't danced on the hills of glory. But that is your real home. And I can tell you as spiritual Jews, spiritual Jews from all over the world, it was never far from their heart or from their mind or from their mouth. Home, Israel, &gt;&gt; we must go back. &gt;&gt; That's there's something within me calling me there. It's all I can think about. It'll be hardship, but I must go back because I'm part of that. I'm part of their I I I'm I'm I'm part of their nation. I'm part that is a part of me. That is my whole life. And they lived for that moment. They saved for that moment. They put away everything they could. And they left everything &gt;&gt; for that moment. &gt;&gt; They even left family. &gt;&gt; They left all their things they may have inherited. I remember speaking to one of the men that I saw who was head of a kibutz. His name was Kaman. And he said, "My father was quite a wealthy man in Austria. And he was part of I was I was one brother of several, I think four, and my my father had a successful tailoring business selling men's clothing." And he said it was uh it was understood that I would I would inherit and and and take over the business. But he said something came over me. That's exactly how he said it. Something came over me in 1939 that I must come back here. And he left everything. He left everything. He left all the wealth that might have come his way. He didn't know that God was directing him and brought him right back. And he he went to a kabutz and spent his life working there. And I was I was privileged on our trip to Israel to meet one of his sons, one of his sons. But he was there had to be an act of repatriation. &gt;&gt; Right. in my mind and I've been pondering this as I close now. God in his mind as he was sending this voice knowing that it's going to be heard throughout the lands in different ways but I'm going to bring them from this land because remember the Canadian Constitution was repatriated that is bringing back what was lost bringing back returning it back to its homeland. There was a there was a an original word which came and it was it's been lost over all these generations. He said, "Listen, let me let me just wind this up. I'm doing my best." He said, "There had to be a Supreme Court. There has to be an absolute. If we didn't have it, what would we do? What would we do if we didn't have it? It had to be returned. what was lost had to come back. What would we do if we didn't have Do I Do I exercise everything that everything that Adam lost? No. I I don't see it personally in my life. But does that mean that I should not as an individual believe what was spoken whether I have it now or whether I have it on the other side is really irrelevant to me. My anchor and my anchor chain is hooked into the promise that everything that was lost by the first Adam has been returned and repatriated back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the second Adam &gt;&gt; absolute &gt;&gt; life &gt;&gt; absolute attributes &gt;&gt; healing. If you're here and you've been uh and you're held down by some kind of a bondage, let it be announced &gt;&gt; under the repatriation of our constitution, that thing doesn't have power over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That sickness doesn't have a right to your body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The constitution has been repatriated. The promises have been returned. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. Finally, the son has been manifested, [Music] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt bring forth a son, &gt;&gt; and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He'll save his people from their sins. And I say to you today on the authority of God's revealed word, the constitution, our constitution, of our nation, our Christian nation has been repatriated. And that's the law I live under. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I give glory to him. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you? I was touched in a special way. But what does it mean to you? You know, all of you that are here, you know, and I know and you've heard it so many times. He took the book. What was it in God's mind when he was showing John and John's looking? John's weeping. No one can take the book. &gt;&gt; Weep not John. The lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. &gt;&gt; Looks to see the lion sees a lamb. &gt;&gt; And you know that that was physically taking place during the prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what took place. Yes. &gt;&gt; What was it? It wasn't brother Brandham reaching and taking his Bible. It was the lamb in his ministry. &gt;&gt; Actually taking taking the book. It wasn't one of our prime ministers of Canada going over and receiving the the Constitution of the United States. It was the lamb himself &gt;&gt; repatriating, taking back the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb. &gt;&gt; And he took the book. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he's doing. He's repatriating, taking it back. And that was in the ministry of the messenger. And you are here, friends, today. Don't let the devil, don't let the atmosphere of this world impose something on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even in the midst of it, Maybe it looks like your circumstances around you spell defeat. Be like the young slave boy. The young man, &gt;&gt; he ate with all the others. &gt;&gt; He had all the circumstances of being a slave. &gt;&gt; But he would not bend to it. &gt;&gt; He held his shoulders back. He put his chest out. He was different because he come from a different land. &gt;&gt; He had a different culture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't whatever you do bow down and become uh become burdened and heavy and overweighted with the circumstances around this world. Deny them. &gt;&gt; I'm from a different country. &gt;&gt; I have a different citizenship. &gt;&gt; I'm under a different constitution. Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember, when the laws and the liberties, &gt;&gt; the laws and the liberties of your land, and we're happy for them, but remember, bear it in mind. Don't forget these words, they all shall pass away. &gt;&gt; And your liberties may change in Washington tomorrow morning. Your liberties in Canada or other parts of the country may change. You may say, "Oh, it's becoming more liberal." Or, "No, it's becoming more tight." Who cares what happens? &gt;&gt; They'll do what they're going to do. &gt;&gt; But your liberties under this constitution that I'm speaking of that was repatriated under Luke 17:30. It was the revealing of the son of man. &gt;&gt; It came back. The life came back. The whole ministry came back. All the attributes have been displayed. They've come back. &gt;&gt; An absolute life. &gt;&gt; We're not sitting here today, oh, just a, oh, how wonderful. Praise the Lord. Getting a good feeling over that. No, it's for you in every daily life, every part of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm so fervent about it, friends. I'm so fervent. I'm having a hard time, but I am closing. So fervent about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is yours. &gt;&gt; It is mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like brother Gier sings, I'll die believing it. &gt;&gt; Or I'll be changed believing it. &gt;&gt; I'll be raptured believing it. But it's what I believe. It's what I want you to believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just don't let anything that comes by your way or anything comes across your path change that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand as we sing once again. We're going to pray first. And I wonder, brother Jason, if I can have you helping me, please. Let's just bow our heads. There may be somebody and whoever you might be here amongst us today said, "Brother Ed, I believe what has been spoken and I believe that this this absolute has come and been spoken on my behalf. I believe it with everything that's within me. And I am standing here today and I want to declare my full agreement and belief and faith in this constitution, this pro this this promise of God. I raise my hands to heaven in defiance of this age and in defiance of all that the world would try to impose upon me. I raise my hands in defiance to every device of the enemy, &gt;&gt; to every lie of Satan, and in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, both of my hands raised up because I want to stand with a testimony tonight, today, this morning, that I am in direct opposition to what the enemy would impose upon this your blood bought. These people, these people, oh God, have been purchased with your own blood. They've been purchased with the most costly uh costly price. And so I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, that every attribute of that life will become in full in full force in every life. Lord, I know there are some here that are suffering physically, oh God. And while that may be considered a minor thing for some, for them that are suffering, it's a very important, a major thing. I we we deny the enemy. We resist the enemy. Oh God, I pray that you'll come to their aid. Do the supernatural. We're calling for a miracle. We're calling for miracles. Will the congregation call with me? We need miracles. Oh God, let these miracles take place. We rejoice, oh God, in this complete power. I pray, Father, that it will be done for the glory of God. Thank you for what you have done. We thank you, Lord, for the glorious things that you have done. And yet, we're looking for more, oh Lord Jesus. Thank you for your word. Thank you for your absolute that you have sent. And now I pray father that as the people ponder and they think and meditate upon these things that you will cause it to be reverberate within them a life oh God the life that has come to seed once again in Jesus name. Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Like to sing that one once again brother. The anchor holds. The anchor hold [Music] [Applause] [Music] my soul. Oh [Music] my god.

I think we either need it, &gt;&gt; will need it, &gt;&gt; have needed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've come through. Have you come through some storms? &gt;&gt; 208 may give us some storms. 209 may give us some more. &gt;&gt; But I have an absolute says we'll crest &gt;&gt; every one of them. &gt;&gt; How many times we've thought of that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have an anchor that keeps the soul. [Music] We have an anchor keeps the soul steadfast and sure while the pillow fastened to the rock that cannot move. grounded perfectly in the Savior. &gt;&gt; Just a moment. How many don't know that song? Oh my. Don't Don't feel bad about raising your hand. I can tell you one thing. Your prophet knew it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just had to say that, did, didn't I? All right. Here's one that he sang. All right, let's sing it again. We have an anchor that keeps the soul. Stay back and show pass to the rock in the heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. That's the love that I'm sending you away with this morning. Be back this afternoon. Brother Tom will be speaking 5:00. We'll just pray. What a delight it is, oh God, for me just to bow with each of these dear ones. How precious they are to you. Father, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll forgive us our errors, our sins, our iniquities. Let the word now just wash us and cleanse us. And we are testifying, Lord, all of these people that have come this morning and have spent this perhaps lengthy service. And we've come, oh God, driven these highways, but we've been desiring that something be anchored in our soul. I pray father that you will make your promises alive. Quicken the minds to them and do all the things that we need done and dis disperse us now from this service Lord with your grace upon our lives in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. We're dismissing you. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your patience. You've been really attentive and I just wanted to get this far with this message. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
